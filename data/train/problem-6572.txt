“As if I need a man or woman to make me happy. Not everyone is lucky enough to find a Tony Stark.” Nat quipped.
And Tony only got one thing from all that chattering she was doing. “You guys are living together now?” he asked in disbelief.
’. Yeah. Great way to start off the date.
Tony was watching Peter fume, a drink now in his hand. The silence grew between them.
“Mind control? Harley that’s insane. That stuff can real mess up your head.” She paused. “Let me guess. Nertha?”
“I will and I love you both.” Anna responded, smiling up at him, before her father let her go. “And thank you again.” She remembered as she and Remy watched him leave the room. They both sighed when he was gone, revealed, happy, content. Then Anna went to relock her room door as she saw her father did earlier and checking that it was properly locked this time. She joined Remy on her bed afterwards as they became a tangled mess of limbs.
Harley thought. He decided though to just let Torunn be, offering to get her a drink from the bar, so he didn’t have be near Jaime any longer. Torunn accepted, telling him what she wanted, and Harley left for the bar.
“Harder than I thought.” The process was tedious but also exciting. Morgan elaborated in detail. Choosing the right home was becoming impossible. She and Nathan would have to just settle on something and work on making renovations as time progressed.
“Whatever. You had a crush on Wanda’s brother.” Amelia chimed in.
I didn't plan for this story and when I was "peer pressured" (for a lack of better words) into writing more than a one shot, I struggled after a minute...
“Well, I made an appointment today for the doctor’s.” Tony informed him and Stephen’s face lit up. He wanted this more than anything else in the world. “It’s just an appointment to see if I have any eggs left and what my options might be otherwise.”
“And Dad’s work is phenomenal. Tremendously good at what he does.” Morgan added. Steve grinned at his daughter. Yeah, she was forever his favorite child. He didn’t ever have to ask her to make him sound good, she just did it on her own.
“I’m dangerous.”
Tony stood before him. He was dressed in a light blue long-sleeved dress shirt with a vest over it that matched his dress pants. Steve was surprised to see him, and he couldn’t ignore how good Tony looked. He was caught staring when Tony spoke up, letting himself into Steve’s apartment.
Tony could accept that, coming from Steve but that still left the question of Loki’s newly discovered pregnancy. When last they saw each other, only over a month ago, there wasn’t any evidence of a pregnancy but he supposed, this was the God of Mischief who possessed more power than he let on. He was probably concealing his pregnancy with a spell or something of the sort. Tony didn’t get to think long about it though once Loki started the ceremony.
Tony’s heart fell out of his mouth. “Baby?” he whispered.
“Okay. I suppose I should finish packing.” Maria realized.
The book he was reading was about the birthing process. To say Steve was scared was an understatement. He was the first man in recorded history to ever get pregnant. There wasn’t any reference material for his specific case and he had voiced this concern to his doctor from the get-go. She had eased his mind and informed him that she’d just carry out a c section on him because to be quite honest, no one was sure how else they’d be getting the baby out.
Then Nathan entered the room looking freshly showered and a plate of food in his hand. Maria kissed Morgan’s forehead and left the two alone. Nathan approached her and sat on her bed. She turned to him and Nathan went about handing her the plate.
Steve’s heart broke. He didn’t want Tony thinking that. Of course, he wanted to be with him. “I do want you Tony. I love you. I love you so much.”
He reached her soon enough. Her back was to him and she sank back into his arms the moment she felt him pressed up against her. “You good?” he questioned, kissing the top of her head.
Pepper cut him off. “Why?”
“Thanks. Wiser words were never spoken.”
When Steve came to, both Sam and Bucky were freaking out over him because Tony was gone and so was Nicky.
. Tony didn’t plan anything extravagant this year and it was crazy to think what had happened on this day a year ago. Steve let the secret slip. Everyone learned that Natasha was the woman that Steve had had the affair with. That changed things and funny enough, for the better.
That ticked Jacob off and within a second he had her pushed up against the closest wall, his right arm pressed firmly against her chest to keep her in place. Nertha was strangely turned on by it all and she licked her lips, noting that Jacob’s lips are only an inch away from her own. She wouldn’t mind spending a night with him.
“Maybe we should take a break.” He decided, pulling his hands away from the hold. Maybe marriage was too much. Maybe they needed to take a moment for themselves by themselves.
Harley looked appalled and burst out into a laugh. “Dad, I assure you, that wasn’t her first time. I mean –”
“Sorry. I haven’t been on a date in a while. Busy with work, you know?” he gestured to Tony. He really did know. He used to be buried in work down in his lab for hours on end until he met Steve. It always felt like he took a moment from his work and the next thing he knew he was pregnant and married. Steve had knocked him up in the first 3 months of being together, proposed when he was 5 months pregnant and married him a few weeks after Harley was born.
“It’s been years, yeah. But you know things never got better after that.” Bruce fixed his glasses, ending the conversation with that last statement and Nat went looking for Tony afterwards.
“I’m so sorry Tony. I got so distracted. I didn’t even realize the time had gone by so much. I slept over at Bucky’s.” He lied perfectly.
The three girls chattered by the lockers in the hall as Nathan, Bruce Banner’s son and Morgan’s boyfriend for the past 6 months, approached them. “Hey” Nathan greeted them, adjusting his glasses before wrapping his arms around Morgan and planting a brief kiss on her cheek.
When Steve stopped by that Sunday morning, Bucky had answered the door in a robe. His hair was a mess – Steve knew just-fucked hair anywhere, his face was red, there were hickeys littering his neck and collarbone and there was a little limp in each step he took. Bucky had to clear his throat before speaking. He was hoarse from screaming no doubt.
“Harls.” There was the nickname again. Harley could melt away from hearing that. No one had ever said it the way she had, his entire life. She had paused her brushing. “You call to inquire about whether or not I have an interest in Jaime.” It was not a question, but Harley answered regardless.
“I have morning breath.” He explained, covering his mouth. Steve howled with laughter, kissing him again and Tony melted away in it.
Torunn giggled and went to her mother once her feet were back on the ground. Sif kissed both her cheeks before hugging her tightly. She looked forward to holidays the most because even though she saw her often through portals, there was nothing greater than being in person. Torunn was her pride and joy, her first born. It was so hard to let her go. “My sweet girl, I’ve missed you so much,”
After that conversation, Steve confided in Tony. He was rightfully scared as he curled up in Tony's side.
He was pleasantly surprised “Thanks. I like you too Torunn.”
“Look. We’ll never be friends. But I do wish you both the best. I just don’t understand your hatred towards me. You got him in the end.”
“Pietro is very attractive.” Torunn said proudly, “and there are only six years between us.” Morgan nodded in agreement.
“Doctor!” A nurse at the hospital shouted when they saw Stephen appear in one of the rooms.
“When we visited Clint and Laura, it sounded like you were against Steve and Tony.”
“I mean…” Wade paused. “I’ve never done it with a guy.” He clarified.
“Just wanted to take a quick shower before we went down for breakfast.” Was shouted back.
Eventually, Steve and Tony worked to cover up for Anna and Remy. But as their other three children decided to play detectives, inquire and drew closer to the truth, they had to confide in Director Fury with everything. He turned out to be surprisingly really understanding and put the case to rest without a second thought. He too was growing weary of dealing with that investigation and the closing statement would be,
“Bye.” Wade said plainly and the trio walked away to Wade’s car.
“I just came down, looking for Harley.” She explained.
Rhodey sat in bed, his back against his bed’s headboard and an episode of his favorite show playing before him when Carol walked through their bedroom door. She was dressed in casual clothes and as far as Rhodey knew she should be just now returning from a mission which usually required her suit. She was heading to their en suite when he caught her attention
"So why did he leave?"
“You should stay away from men like him.” Maria advised, when in truth, Anna had always done quite the opposite.
“Hey mom. I’m just wondering how you are?”
Harley paused, piecing his words together before saying them. “Morgie wants to get out of her crib. I can’t get her out Daddy. Not big enough.”
Steve was standing off to the side as Tony walked around, getting a closer look at the contents of the boxes.
Still, his kids were the ones that stopped by the most reminding their father that life went on, even if he didn’t have their mother in his life anymore. Steve couldn’t plan for this. Who really could? He thought things were going good.
“It’s a shame Harley isn’t here.” Maria realized. She took her own seat and Steve came waltzing into the room, a dish in hand. He brought dessert.
“Are you done yet?” Tony wondered. He was seated on a chair posing while Steve sketched him. He was 16 weeks along with the twins. He’d been pregnant before – Harley was turning 3 in August and Morgan was turning 1 in April – but this pregnancy meant everything was twice as difficult. He’d blown up so much already. He didn’t know how he was doing it but according to their doctor, baby A and baby B were both fine and healthy.
“For now, yeah.” Wade said boldly. Peter blushed. He had to accept. Wade never failed to let him know he wanted kids with him one day as did Peter. They finished up with the dishes when Wade spoke again. “I love you Peter.”
“Hard to tell.” Rhodey mused.
“You were watching me?” Peter wondered, staring back into his eyes.
Steve calmed down a bit and Sam released his arms when he asked him to. “I’m fine Sam.” But Strange wasn’t. He stood with Tony for support as he held his bloody nose. At this point everyone’s attention was on the group – Strange, Tony, Steve and Sam – as they got closer.
“Good luck Tony.” She responded. Then they both got up, shared a hug and Tony was able to go on about the rest of his day.
Harley stared at her mesmerized for a few seconds. “I wanted to ask you something. It’s been running through my mind for weeks.” Torunn hummed and Harley proceeded with his question. “Are you into Aunt Nat’s nephew, Jaime?” Torunn didn’t let him finish her sentence.
“No problem.” Steve watched Tony walk away, only to see him interacting with Strange thereafter. Steve hadn’t realized he was there too. He found Sam sitting at a table by himself after Bucky had just left with Winter to go find a bathroom inside.
“Not even Thor?” Pepper had to ask. She knew how much she had cared for Thor back in the day even if it was years before her time. Carol never failed to stress about the seriousness of that relationship.
Ellie peered up at her father under long lashes. “Very bad words…about you.” Her eyes were apologetic as she pointed at Peter. She pulled the same face Wade always made whenever he was trying to apologize.
They were sitting in their living room, trying to watch a movie when Bruce noticed her lost in her thoughts. He took one of her hands in his and it made her turn her attention to him. “What you are thinking about?”
Harley gasped all dramatic-like. “Jacob Rhodes. You’re still a virgin?” he asked.
“You’re right.” Tony supplied. Steve was stunned. Tony rarely ever listened to him. “Fuck me right here,” he whispered. Yeah. Okay. That made sense now. They had been sleeping together for a few months now and if it was one thing he learned about being with Tony it was that he loved being spontaneous but this might have been the craziest thing yet. He wanted to be fucked right here, right now if the hasty removal of Steve’s shirt was any indication.
"He was awful to Harley. He said horrible things to him, made him feel like he didn't belong with his family. It was just terrible. I confronted him about it and somehow it turned into
“You have a boyfriend.” It wasn’t a question. “Who is he?”
“No. I can cook.” He reminded him, pulling a chair out for Peter. The food looked great. Smelled even better.
Friday provided an answer. “Your mother is putting a Mother’s Day Brunch together.”
“I never intended to ever talk about this with anyone but your mother or your Uncle Bucky for the rest of my life.” He declared, observing everyone’s expressions. Morgan had a hand over her mouth, trying to conceal her shock. Harley was gaping at him in disbelief while Peter visibly shivered from hearing the actual words. “But when Peter overheard me and your mother discussing this at Peggy’s funeral, I figured I should let you all know. And yes, it was Peggy. She took advantage of me and I didn’t know any better.”
“But it’s a good idea Winnie.” Sam assured him and her focus was now on him. Before he scooped up his little girl and put her on Bucky’s lap so they could all be closer.
Torunn looked stunning. She stood before the full-length mirror in her dressing room admiring how well her handmaids had prepared her for her special day and her friends surrounded her. Morgan was busy elsewhere; Cassie Lang was stooping behind her as she fixed her dress’s elaborate train and Lila Barton was adjusting her crown but had yanked a little harder than need be. Torunn groaned as a result of it.
“Yes. Of course.” Tony confessed. “Our daughter had a miscarriage. She needs both her parents right now.” He couldn’t really be upset about that. It was a given.
Tony decided to fess up further. This was one of his good friends after all. She knew him well. “Yeah, that too.”
Nicholas James Rogers came peacefully into the world. He didn’t cry. He didn’t scream and his eyes were closed. Steve panicked when he saw this. He grew frantic of the thought that his son might have not made it. Bucky and Sam, who were by Steve’s side tried to calm him down. He was moving too much in panic and the doctors hadn’t even closed him back up yet. But the doctors rectified that quickly, slapping the baby’s bum and little Nicky let out the most ear-splitting scream. He was alive.
Nathan’s dislike for attention and parties was well-known but it didn’t stop family from coming by and dropping off presents for him.
“I get it,” was all Stephen said before he was sinking into his already stretched hole. Tony gasped, feeling him without a condom for the first time. He nodded as best he could, given that Stephen’s face was an inch away from his and his hands soon found his black and gray hair, yanking at it with each thrust. He was deep. So deep, Tony thought he could feel him in his womb.
“Yes.” He said honestly. He couldn’t lie about that. His mind and his heart wouldn’t let him. Stephen seemed to visibly wince from the confirmation.
“I keep telling you Remy, I don’t want you dating my daughter. Do that and we’d consider the debt repaid.” Steve provided, squeezing his hand so much, mid-handshake, that Remy let out a groan.
Tony couldn’t hold back his tears as he walked down to meet his Steve. They hugged when they were face to face and shared a kiss prior to turning to meet their audience’s eyes. Tony laughed. Everyone was wearing pajamas too.
“I don’t know. Would you like that?” He realized he didn’t know.
“I wouldn’t want to bore you with talk of my kids, doctor”. Tony took a sip from his wine glass. After which their waiter came and took their orders. They handed their menus to the waiter and Stephen took this opportunity to hold Tony’s hands in his own.
“Well, Morgan and I don’t know how to feel about it. And it’s so strange; it has nothing to do with us, but we can’t help thinking about what our mom must have been feeling.” Peter went on. He looked up at Wade. Maybe this was too much information for him to handle.
It was morning and the initial shock had faded away. Morgan was busy circling the room trying to justify why she shouldn't be pregnant in typical Morgan Stark Rogers fashion. And Nathan was there to quash everything that passed her lips.
“Kayla said I conceived early May.
” Steve assured him, taking the hand Tony offered and disappearing down the hall with him. It was crazy to think how much changed after that day and neither one of them had any idea that they’d just met their soulmate.
Everyone was staring at him; Tony especially. “Mom. I know you said you were afraid that would happen to me too because of Wade but –”
Harley walked her back to her room. He wished her a good night and turned to leave her doorway when she planted her lips against his. She was smiling sweetly at him when next their eyes met after the kiss. Harley wasn’t sure of what was happening and Torunn gave him no real time to think before she yanked him into her room, closing the door behind them. He saw her drop her shear dress revealing her curves. Harley couldn’t keep his eyes off her.
“You’re still my baby, Tony. My only baby.” Maria reminded her and Tony could understand. No matter how old his four got they’d still be his babies too.
“Again, how well do we really know her?” Harley reverberated.
Harley noted she was a bit put off by the notion but didn’t think much of it.
Morgan wiped her tears and smiled. “Enough about me. What’s been going on with you two?” She needed a change of subject.
Gamora, Peter Quill and Nebula were fortunate enough to make it Tony’s Christmas party this year. Tony had started the tradition back in 2012, the year the Avengers had broken up and parted ways. The guardians did try to be in attendance each year but saving the galaxy always got in the way. This was their second time around and of course they couldn’t all be in attendance, so they took turns.
In other news. I've decided to be bisexual because girls are hot 😍
“Steve.” He repeated it, his eyes closing.
“I’m sorry. What exactly is it that you do?” he directed his words to Steve.
“Alright. I just never saw the need to.” Jaime admitted, rubbing his arm awkwardly.
“We’ll do another test.” Steve stated as Tony stared at him with teary eyes, still locked in the embrace. Then he looked to his three – that he was certain of – children. “But I need you three,” He pointed them out. “To stop pointing fingers with no solid evidence.” Steve thought they were smarter than that.
“I know,” and they stayed like that until Loki made this grand entrance that caught everyone’s attention.
“It’s going to be okay.” He tried to assure her before Peter and Torunn came bargaining in. They’d heard the scream too. Peter was shocked out of his mind and stood frozen at the doorway. Torunn had her sword in hand; ready to fight at a moment’s notice. She dropped it when she saw the scene before her, running to her friend’s side. Tony let Torunn take Morgan into her arms as he spoke to Friday. He needed to act quickly.
When the line went dead, Jacob found Harley venturing into his room. He noticed there was something a little off about Harley but maybe he was just hangover. He’d spent all night out with Nertha. Harley had become very preoccupied with Nertha as of late; more than the usual.
“It meant nothing, Cassie. Chill.” Amelia explained and Michelle saddened a bit.
“I’ve ran it by him a few times. Your father has selective hearing.” Tony explained. Peter could understand that. Steve only ever heard what he wanted to hear.
“But you are.” Harley countered, pulling back a bit but reaching out to caress her cheeks. “And this is your home. You’re Asgard’s future Queen –”
“Speaking of powers…” Morgan continued on the topic, darting her eyes at Amelia who sat directly across from her. The girls were sitting in a circle. Lila’s empty spot was on Morgan’s left, followed by Torunn, then Michelle, Amelia and then Cassie on Morgan’s right to complete the circle. “How has it been going, working on your powers?”
Tony then watched Steve head back inside and took off to one of the many buffet tables, aiming to get more than just cake. He smiled at the sight. His man looked good walking away and while lost in this train of thought, he hadn’t noticed someone new had joined him on the balcony.
“Maybe she was looking for information on the Hammer case, Mom and Dad did say she could be a target.” Peter spoke up putting the attention on himself. He knew Anna was dying to know what was happening with the case. Harley actually did forget about her being a target.
“Wade is different mom. I promise you. He's a good person. He's kind. He's honest. He's respectful (with me).” He added that last bit as an afterthought. “He's a good guy.” And Peter meant every word.
Tony cut him off when he joined them on the balcony. “You can stay Wade.” And Wade’s face lit up while Steve’s painted a picture of concern. “Just please be good to Peter.” Tony added, wearily.
Steve took a moment to process what was said. Winning Tony's sons over would be harder than he thought. Harley especially.
It was days after New Year’s Eve. 2017 was finally here. Everyone went to their separate homes and school had been reopened. Peter and Morgan were currently in school and Harley and Jacob went back up to MIT; Harley left with a bandage wrapped around the wound on his arm from Clint’s arrow. Clint had found out about him and Lila. He had tried to put an arrow through him. And like Steve had said, no one tried to stop him except for Tony. He couldn’t stand the sight of his precious first born being hurt. Harley was glad Clint managed to only graze him. Steve informed Harley that if Clint wanted to actually hurt him he would have because he never misses.
Steve listened as Tony provided details about the murder. Everyone knew it wasn’t Sharon because she was still in custody when the killing happened. As a matter of fact, she would soon be in prison serving time while her cousin on Peggy’s side of her family got custody of her daughter, Shari Margaret Carter.
“Not yet.” Wade explained and Harley shook his head. He was only joking. “Just waiting on Peter to turn 18.” Which was tomorrow.
“She’s pregnant.” Tony continued. He was in his kitchen attempting to make dinner. Pepper was projected on a screen behind him from his phone and there was cooking video displayed before him.
It was odd. It was strange. It was peculiar. It was down-right weird; Harley being in love. It wasn’t normal and Jacob concluded that he must have been on something or under a spell? He wasn’t sure but he knew the root of the problem and he knew exactly how to fix it.
“I’ll protect you.” Tony provided, dragged him towards the dining area. “Come on.”
“Oh. Who are you?” she wanted to know.
Steve came first. He painted Tony’s insides with his seed and Tony followed soon after letting everything go around the man he loved. Tony pulled off the blindfold himself and they stayed joined together – Steve buried inside him – for what felt like hours. Steve resting his head on Tony’s chest, kissing it occasionally and Tony stroking his hair. Tony was the first to speak.
“Well.” Peter began, gaining everyone’s attention. “I think it will be great having another sibling, having a baby around.” Already wondering what their new sibling would be like.
“I missed you too mother,” Torunn responded. She then turned her attention to Hela, hugging her Aunt before she could deny it. “No Nertha?” she questioned.
“Yeah. I knew.” Peter retracted from the hug. “Mom. I gotta tell you something.”
Carol came by Pepper’s on a day when her two children were out of the house. Calvin was out with friends and as far as Pepper knew Amelia was with her father. Remy. Her feelings towards that man had changed when she noticed a change in her daughter. There was a dark aura surrounding her and Pepper feared Remy wasn’t as good as he claimed to be; it worried her. Amelia had become distant, estranged from her immediate family and there was nothing she could do about it.
By the time, they had the reception that consisted of mostly breakfast and lunch items. The thought was long forgotten especially when the Grandmaster of Sakaar made an appearance, doting over Loki and what he could only assume was their baby.
“Are we ready?” Thor questioned, getting the faint smell of something burning from the air. He chose to ignore it. He could guess quite accurately what had happened judging by Nertha’s disgruntled appearance.
He figured not because he’d gotten with Sharon, even if it was over a year after the official divorce and got her pregnant. He couldn’t possibly be trying to get Tony back.
“Hm?” Tony couldn’t tell what she was getting at.
“Yeah Harls. And would it kill you to clean up after yourself sometimes?” Tony was in complete mom-mode now.
“You don’t mind?”
“It’s my duty.” Torunn explained. But she didn’t want a boyfriend or husband or any suitor. She was confident she was more than capable of ruling Asgard on her own one day. It’s not as if Thor and Sif didn’t know this. Tradition was just tradition. How else would she give Asgard a legitimate heir, one day? Torunn perked up after a moment, Morgan needed positive energy around her.
“Fuck.” He grunted and swallowed each delicious whimper that would pass Tony's lips. Had Tony been any tighter, Steve was sure he'd cum undone, right then and there.
Steve sighed not bothering to give a look through the peephole to see who was there before he opened the door.
“You were planning to break into SHIELD.” He stated. Nat met his eyes. She knew what he might be thinking but she only ever said that as a joke to Morgan.
Harley picked up right there. “She was jealous because that thing I had with Lila last year.” Steve rolled his eyes, recalling clearly the date in question.
“Stephen?” Tony called out. Stephen stopped and turned around. Tony was standing there, his hand extended, palm up with the engagement ring sitting there.
“Really?” Peter questioned.
“Are you on something?” Jacob could only whisper at this point. Harley chuckled.
Morgan watched her mother with a smile on her lips. “Are you happy mama?”
No one was expecting that. Certainly not Steve. Morgan stopped eating feeling herself grow nauseous and dizzy from it all because her father’s girlfriend or whatever Sharon is to him being pregnant was news to her. “Dad?” She looked up at her father with betrayal in her eyes. When was he going to tell her? Did Peter know?
“Hey Pete,” Steve walked in and sat on his bed. “Michelle told me you went to bed early because you weren’t feeling well.” Steve by pure instinct placed the back of his hand on Peter’s forehead. “What’s wrong?”
“It was years ago.” Steve sighed. “So many years ago. I just don’t get it, Tony.” He paused, taking a paper towel from Sam to wipe his fist off. “You forgave Nat but not me.”
“I can have friends.”
Peter and Harley watched them together. "I promise, I'm no golddigger." Steve said in the direction he hoped they were still in. "I'm not leaving your father anytime soon."
“Are you really?” Carol teased. Pepper has been single most of her life. Surely even she gets lonely sometimes. Everyone craves human companionship every now and then. Not Pepper Potts apparently.
“What is?” Sif questioned, when she entered the room and commanded their attention.
“I love you.” Wade stated, a smile gracing his lips as Peter stared up at his scared face. Peter caressed his cheek lovingly – he couldn’t stay mad at Wade and Wade in turn, kissed his exposed throat. “I just want our first time to be special.” Wade explained in a whisper and kissed his lips this time. Peter welcomed it, moaning as Wade’s hands travelled to his rear and it was being groped.
“Stay with me Tony.”
“…eight.” Peter finished.
Steve had taken a seat on their sofa. “How is that going?
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. You can just call me,
“Now Tony’s with someone that actually cares about him and you can’t stand to see him happy if it’s not with you.” Strange continued to provoke him while Steve tried to keep a levelled head. He wanted so desperately to put Strange in his place, but he also didn’t want to cause a scene. Not in front of his kids at least.
“Your honor. How is any of this relevant to the case? What does this really prove?”
“Thanks.” He stated, pulling himself into an upright position so he could get a better look at what Steve had made him for breakfast. He thought he heard a little crackling sound from one of his limps - a sign his age was catching up with him. Steve would have told him, ‘he was being ridiculous’.
Up until a week ago only the Stark-Rogers and Banners knew about Morgan’s miscarriage. Like Tony had told Pepper, they were trying to keep it under wraps. It was such a difficult time for Morgan and Nathan (poor kid took the news hard). It appeared that within the couple of days they had known they were truly pregnant; they’d already grown attached to the baby and formed some type of bond.
“Anna
“We had sex.” Nat finished, gauging his reaction.
“I do your honor.” Nova steps back to her table pulling out a recording. Tony is worrying because they hadn’t planned for whatever it was Steve’s team was doing and Tate tried to stay cool. Nova approaches the judge, motioning to the monitor set up on the side. “If I may…”
Nathan thought for a moment as he always did before saying anything. Morgan valued his opinion greatly. “I don’t think it will ever be like that until they forgive each other. But I get why your mother never could.” Just like everyone else, Nathan knew about what her father did to her mother. “It’s almost unforgiveable. And if he does, who’s to say he won’t do it again?”
“Friday. Call Nathan Banner. Tell him to meet us at the St. Grace hospital.” Tony ordered, watching Morgan cry in Torunn’s hands.
Hela was the first to comment. “Done whoring yourself out for the grandmaster then?”
Anna walked forward and enveloped Peter in a hug. She made sure to keep her skin away from any of his. “Please don’t tell anyone. Especially not mom or dad.”
“I don’t know if it’s because you still love him, or you don’t love me...” Stephen drawled on and Tony knew he couldn’t answer that question if Stephen had asked him that while in a conscious state of mind.
Wade:
At the mention of it, the memory did come back for Morgan. Nathan had updated her all summer about his time with Nat’s family. She had one older sister, Tanya who was married to a guy named Misha Kozlov and they had 3 kids – Ana, Jaime and Levi. “Oh.”
“Your Aunt Pepper set me up with some doctor.”
“Then there are individuals like you who need two partners.” Pepper sighed. It was a little peculiar, the whole polygamous relationship but that was Carol's lifestyle and Rhodey's and Valkyrie's. “That is probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard of in my 44 years of life.” Carol had a little smirk etched on her lips. “Are you three planning a three-person wedding too?”
“If I’m being honest, babe. I don’t like the way T’challa looks at you.” He confessed, looking away from his eyes in the mirror. Bucky turned around to face him.
.” Steve chimed in. “And if that’s all? You can leave now.”
He invited Thor to the table and Steve pulled out a chair for him. Loki was already eating his meal and Maria offered to make Thor a plate as well.
“No underage drinking, tonight?” Torunn’s voice rang clear in Harley’s ears. He found her staring at him. She was propped up against a table, a drink in her hand.
He left the bar and Justin spoke to Gary without taking his eyes off Stephen’s car driving away. “Did you put the elixir in the drink?”
“If she wants to, I guess I can’t do anything about that.” She concluded. This was Amelia’s decision. She hoped no more baby fathers would show up. She could vaguely remember what Calvin’s father looked like. “Thankfully Remy’s only interest is Amelia.”
It was the need-to-know kind of business and Amelia did not need to know. He also didn’t have time to respond even if he wanted to. He was waiting for someone in the comforts of their bedroom.
“He is so precious, Sif.” Hope commented, tickling the little baby’s sides. Magni let out squeals of laughter. “Look at his little chubby cheeks.”
Sam broke his train of thoughts. “Look man, I mean this in the nicest way possible but maybe it’s time you move on from Tony. He seems genuinely happy with Strange.”
Steve’s nostrils flared and his fists tightened. “You son of a bitch.” Then he was punching Strange square in the face. His nose was bloody from just that one hit and Steve didn’t want to stop. Strange didn’t fight back. Tony came rushing over, yanking Steve off Stephen and then to help him up. Sam grabbed a hold of Steve and pulled him back. There was a very visible vein throbbing in the middle of Steve’s forehead.
Sam hummed before clicking his tongue, grabbing another drink from the bar. “You know...Bucky said the same thing.”
“By all means.” Judge Brooks provides.
“Are you, serious right now?” his eyebrows raised but his voice stayed level. Steve knew Tony was the angriest whenever he was the calmest, as he should be. He had every right to be. He’d broken his trust.
“No, I didn’t kill Hammer.”
“To be honest. I didn’t even feel like they were divorced. Dad came by the house all the time. We still had family dinners, still took family trips. It was painless for us, kids. Even though I know it wasn’t for Mom and Dad.” Harley paused. “Bottom line is, we were and still are a family. That never changed even if they split up. And I bet things will be fine for your family too, no matter what your parents end up doing.” Harley hoped it all worked out well. Jacob was an only child. His mom and dad were truly the only family by blood that he had.
Steve knew he was lucky. He’d struck gold when he met Tony. He never stopped winning after that. They spent the rest of the night, drinking and chatting until Steve realized how late it was. He’d told Tony he’d be back in time to put Morgan to bed. She always had a hard time getting to sleep and staying asleep if her dad didn’t put her to bed. So, they all finished their drinks and went their separate ways.
“But not happy for me.” Sif spoke for her. She never would be. She and Thor had dated before Sif. He was going to marry her, make her Queen one day but Carol didn’t want that. She could never be anyone’s Queen. She hadn’t even thought marriage could be an option for her until she met Rhodey and settled down. And Odin, who was King at the time, would never let an outsider sit on the throne alongside Thor. He arranged a marriage with Sif. She was a strong noble warrior and of Asgard. She would do well as Queen. Thor had no choice but to obey his father’s wishes but vowed to Carol that he would end their marriage and give up the throne (Loki or Hela would gladly take it) and be with her once Odin had passed. None of that happened as Sif had gotten pregnant and he would never abandon their child.
Morgan got in her car to go see her father and Anna went home to prepare for a date.
“Hi,” he responded, his hazel eyes weren’t the only thing smiling. They stood there lost in each other’s eyes like two idiots. The sound of the timer going off which Wade had set for his cooking was what brought them back to reality. Wade cleared his throat and hurried to his kitchen to get his food out of the oven. Peter took this time to take in the contents of Wade’s apartment. It was small but quaint. He could see bits of Wade’s personality shining through in each piece of décor.
And Tony entered the room again, providing answer. "Because Steve's blind." Peter and Harley looked at each other in surprise. "He's never really cared about all that stuff and so I'm positive, Steve really loves me."
“Aren’t you minutes away from getting married – to the Goddess of Thunder. Married into a family of Gods for that matter?” Jacob reminded him as Harley grinned at his reflection and occasionally smoothed out his hair.
When he and Bucky got into the car to leave the doctor’s office, he took a picture of the ultrasound and sent it to Tony with a text.
“You got our daughter tested.” He began and Sam’s eyebrows frowned apologetically. He knew he shouldn’t have done that, especially not without telling Bucky but he did anyway. “You went behind my back.” Bucky continued. His voice stayed level so as not to draw Winter’s attention to them. “You didn’t trust me.”
Steve struggles to come up with a reason besides, ‘
Tony’s hands folded over his chest. Peter glared at Wade and it took him a minute to catch on. He found himself trying to right his wrong. “Not that I'm doing that. I would never. Not saying I wouldn't want to. I’d like to, But! Not now. Obviously. At some point. Probably after Peter's birthday in August. You know, the age of consent in the state of New York is 17.”
“So what’s on your mind?” Bucky finally spoke, cutting the sandwiches he was making into 4s and Sam got drinking glasses from the cupboard above their kitchen sink.
Stephen could then make out the streak of white hair as Anna leant closer to him, and finally cut his flesh. She had every intention slit his throat and kill him right then and there.
“So your parents choose a bunch of guys for you and then you have to choose from that?” Amelia asked for clarification. That didn’t sound fair. Torunn hummed in agreement.
"I promise you won't get a cent from our father." Harley began.
business and whoever I choose to date or sleep with is none of
“With our lives, more children are out of the question.” Gamora explained. “And Quill is already a handful.” The two women snickered. Gamora had two children of her own with Quill; a 9-year-old boy called Zoi, and a 5-year-old girl named Toria.
“Thinking about your mom?”
, but I wouldn’t put it pass you.” She baited and Anna lunged at her, pinning her to the ground. Steve then swooped in, pulling Anna back.
Amelia was Pepper’s daughter. Morgan was as close to her as Pepper was and still is to Tony, best friends since birth. She and her brother Calvin were family, like the cousins the Stark-Roger kids never had. Amelia was almost the spitting image of her mother with even brighter red hair and her mother’s calm and collected personality.
“Happy to have avoided that.” Hope chimed in. Christie had no chances of having any powers when both her parents got their powers from their suits and Hope was grateful for that.
“I should mention,” Sif added. “I am almost certain Thor loses portions of his intelligence when he is in the presence of Quill.”
“He says it every day.”
“I don’t understand why you didn’t.” Steve chimed in, arms folded over his chest and his mind racing thinking of another child he didn’t plan for.
“Don’t forget she needs to be home by 10 am tomorrow.” Carmelita finally uttered in full, unadulterated English to Wade. She stooped to Ellie’s level to hug her. “Nos vemos mañana, nena. Te quiero.”
“I was only gone for two months and you live here now?” He asked in disbelief, taking the seat, two stools away from him. Maria then started to make her grandson a plate.
“I know.” He whispered, flying off and narrowly escaping the explosions. He and Rhodey fired back. It was far greater than he had expected and was glad Rhodey had come along.
“She said she considered calling the cops.” Peter explained, shaking his head like that was the most unthinkable thing.
“Well...” Morgan trailed off. Why was she suddenly struggling to find words? Tony observed everyone else at the table. Peter was more focused on his meal, but Anna was staring right back at him.
look at him.” He put emphasis on the ‘you’.
“Grandma’s in the kitchen. Dad’s running late and Mom and Anna were just in here.” Peter informed her, as he looked around and focused on the sounds around him. They could both hear voices coming from a few rooms away. They glanced at each other making sure the other had heard and they headed towards source.
How does birth really work? I don't know.
“Stay with me Tony.”
Remy tilted his head to the side, clearly intrigued by her boldness. “Oh yeah?” he baited, his eyes glowing, and a smirk fixed on his lips. Pepper didn’t make a move. She didn’t back away. There was no way he would try hurting her in her own home. There was no way he would try hurting her overall. She hadn’t done anything but see right through his act and Remy LeBeau was a calculated individual. Hurting her wouldn’t serve a purpose.
Stephen removed the shirt completely. “You need to relax now.” He pressed his lips to Tony’s.
Two weeks later, Tony joined Steve in their kitchen with a box in hand as Steve finished making dinner. He was always the better cook, after all. When Steve opened the box and revealed the positive pregnancy test, there were too many emotions at play, but his excitement outweighed them all. They were going to be parents and though they knew it wouldn’t be easy, they knew they would figure it all out together. And it seemed Steve always had a sixth sense whenever it came to detecting his pregnancies. Always.
“Absolutely not.” Natasha could say with confidence that she didn’t kill Hammer. “I wanted him to rot in prison.” She pulled out her chair and got up, walking towards the kitchen with her almost empty plate and Bruce couldn’t understand why an innocent person would be reacting like that.
The trio - Brook in Steve’s arms and Tony by his side - made their way to the kitchen and dining area that morning, hoping to join the rest of their family for breakfast.
Harley sighed. “You can’t.” He begged her, kissing her lips a moment later.
“So you did kill Hammer.” Morgan chimed in, approaching her parents and younger sister. “You were working with him.”
This was poorly written. I'm sorry. I think i know why.
“Why so? Would you not rather be indulging in sexual activities with a girl at this moment?” She asked. That was more his forte.
“But you’re not in love with me. You don’t love me.” He knew it. He just didn’t want to believe it. Silence followed. Tony kept his eyes trained on his fingers, that he was playing with, subconsciously on his lap. “Then why did you say yes? How did we get this far?” His voice was lower than before. They were engaged, planning to start a family when Tony didn’t even love him.
Peter chuckled while Morgan’s question went unanswered. And Tony leaned in snatching Peter from Steve’s embrace. “And because you’re my last baby Peter. After we lost...” Tony paused. Steve was giving him a knowing look. Should they talk about this? They were airing everything out, right?
Morgan’s door stayed open these days. She had a sketch pad in one hand and a pencil in the other as she sat crossed legged on her bed. She looked better than his mother had described 2 weeks ago when the incident took place. She even looked a little cheerful. And to see her sketching again was a good thing. Morgan was really good at it and had abandoned it years ago. She claimed she had outgrown it.
Tony’s eyes widened and his lips allowed a little gasp to pass between them. “You wouldn’t mind me possibly keeping his baby?”
“All T’challa and I have ever had is a friendship.” Bucky informed him. “And you didn’t believe me. Didn’t trust me.” Bucky added, stepping away from the kitchen island and into the living room area.
And everyone grew quiet. Steve had said that so nonchalantly as if it wasn’t the biggest bombshell ever dropped within their family. Strange stopped nursing his nose and stared in astonishment at Steve. Sam’s face was pure shock. He looked to Bucky. Did he know? He was equally surprised. Clint and Laura were staring at Steve in disbelief. Amelia and Torunn were frozen in place.
Pepper didn’t know for sure if Remy had always been a mutant from birth or if it was something he had recently discovered. She remembered seeing a picture of him at the fertility clinic and though it was over 18 years ago, she was positive he looked nothing like he did back then. But Remy was a mutant and by relation, there was a chance Amelia might be too. In fact, Remy had claimed she was upon their first meeting. He passed a kinetically charged card to her daughter and she wasn’t at all fazed by the gesture instead she channelled the same energy back to the card. When asked what would happen if she didn’t, he threw one towards a road and a huge explosion was the result.
Everyone kept telling her it was going to get better; that she was going to get pass this. And she was trying. She really was but she couldn’t stop the hurt from coming. It was always there. So how? She asked with her eyes. How did he know she was going to get pass this?
Carol grew quiet on the other end, so Jacob continued, “Amelia told me you were staying at her house.” He confessed. That was probably one of her next questions anyways.
Tony was about to give into the idea when they found out he was pregnant again and clear of the danger zone that was the first trimester. Months later and their miracle baby was almost here. Tony let Steve know though that he wasn’t opposed to the idea of still adopting once they figured out this parenting thing.
“Sam texted me. And I figured it was a good a time as any to give you your Mother’s Day gift.” Steve handed over the box. “Happy Mother’s Day.”
“So that means Asgardians too?”
Eventually, Steve pulled himself together and helped Tony wipe away his tears. He kissed his forehead and asked Tony where they’d go from here.
But Stephen wasn’t convinced. “I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to be a part of my child’s life.” He explained, advancing towards the couple. Steve step forward as well, coming face to face with Stephen and shielding Tony behind him.
Maria chuckled. “As do you.”
Harley sighed and eventually got dressed. Steve questioned him immediately after. “What do you think of your mother’s new boyfriend?”
He managed to squeeze more information out of Justin before he was taken into the custody of SHIELD’s intensive and impenetrable prison. He’d learned where his alleged daughter was living – Xavier’s Institute for Higher Learning, a home and school for mutants; he’d learned that Sharon Carter wasn’t carrying Steve’s child but in truth it was Justin’s.
“Well,” he sat up in bed, keeping his eyes on him in the mirror. “I don’t like it here.”
“You can control it though, to some degree. I know.” It wasn’t a question. Xavier had said she could. She knew she could too.
“So you’re stuck with us.”
Tony was red when Stephen set him down. “What was that for?”
“Do you think we have twin-telepathy?” Peter carried on. Tony realized he’d unconsciously tuned out parts of the conversation.
to know I don’t like you.”
Ned and Michelle heard it though and started asking about whose voice they had heard. Peter ignored them.
“Right.” She recalled how Tony felt about that particular situation. “What’s that thing he always says?”
“So believe me when I say it gets better, my little Marie.” Maria dabbed Morgan’s tears away. “It’s not the end of the world honey. Even though I know it feels like that. Please know you have so much love and support around you.” Morgan was smiling through her tears because she knew her grandmother was right. She was going to be okay.
“But who actually killed Hammer? Who pulled the trigger?” Peter asked. That’s all that mattered and what could have been a possible motive. He saw Harley retrieved his phone as it made a notification sound.
“I just don’t want to hurt anyone.”
“Yeah.” They paid for their meals and hugged each other tightly before going their separate ways. Morgan missed living a few doors down from her at the Mansion, but she couldn’t see herself ever living there again. Especially not with Stephen Strange taking up permanent residency.
“Fine.” Stephen kissed him. “Tell me about your day.”
Nathan and Lila watched their parents converse on the porch. Nathan could see Natasha’s eyes on him at one point or another. He had avoided her all summer and though his father thought he was doing so because Morgan had asked that of him, it was simply his choice. He only felt it was right for him to put some space between himself and Natasha. He’d just discovered, along with the majority of his family that she had caused a marriage to come undone and that was something Nathan Banner could not support.
“Oh yeah. I always forget you’re bi.” Morgan remembered. The other girls hadn’t known this.
“Hmm.” Bucky had hummed for a response, patting her shoulder to let her know he was done with her hair. She got up and turned to face her Papa. Bucky shifted her braids over her shoulder, admiring his handiwork – her hair and his gorgeous little girl.
Tony had been staying at Pepper’s for an entire month now. He’d just turned 28 a few days ago. He buried himself into work as much as possible and distracted himself with caring for Harley and Morgan. Harley handled the separation better than Morgan did. He would, on occasion, ask where his father was but Morgan had spent most days chanting ‘dada’. Tony’s solution to the problem was usually some ‘mommy and me’ time or some ‘Morgan and Amelia’ time. The two toddlers were inseparable, and Tony was thankful for her and for Pepper for letting him stay in her home. He didn’t want to stay in his home without Steve. He did, however, intend to move out once he got closer to his due date. His mother had offered to stay with him and aid for as long as he would need her. And Pepper reminded him, she and Amelia were only a short drive away.
Family is so important Tony. We always need people's support and the great thing about it is that we can choose who we call family.
“What’s going on?” Carol could sense that something was off. Pepper wasn’t herself either.
She took a moment to adjust to the feeling. Her eyes stayed closed as he watched her face. He let her set her own pace and not long after she was rolling her hips. She pushed him back, so he lay fully on her bed. He was only able to squeeze her large breasts and take a nipple in his mouth in the moments in which she’d lean forward, making them face to face. Occasionally they’d share a kiss but during their coupling he kept his thumb on her swollen clit, allowing her to come multiple times before he did. Torunn was getting closer to another orgasm when Harley finally let go and came inside her.
Yes there will be a 3rd Chapter :)
“To you Dr Strange.” Justin jested, slapping a hand on his shoulder. Stephen drank the entire thing in one go after which he placed the glass on the bar. He made to leave, when Justin wished him a good night.
“Mom…” Peter was panicking. How was Wade going to react to all this?
“I can’t remember, exactly. We didn’t see her for long before she was taken away, but I imagine she was so beautiful.” Tony sighed, sadly at the memory. “But I still have you three.” He couldn’t be happier for the three children he did have even with all their quirks.
By the end of the ceremony, after no objections – not from Nertha or Lila or any Asgardian, the couple exchanged rings and finally sealed the marriage with a kiss. The minister then presented them to the audience as he had Harley kneel to have his head adorned with his new crown. Moments later, Harley rose again, and he looked out at their audience.
“Slow.” Tony repeated. Well, he was going to at least try to take things slow. They were left smiling stupidly at each other when a thought resurfaced in Tony’s mind. “By the way, we need to talk to Anna.” He added and Steve gave him a knowing look.
In this mess of tears and emotions, the only thing that soothed him was caresses of his 14-week-old baby bump by himself or Steve. His second trimester also brought on the unusual cravings and everyone was left at Tony’s whim to try and keep him happy.
Steve backed away from Stephen, welcoming Maria with a hug. “You look lovely Maria” he paid her the compliment and she returned the favor.
Everyone’s eyes fell on her and Harley. Morgan finally confirmed her suspicions.
Remy knew that wasn’t true. “I’m sure if you spoke with your mother, she’d tell you otherwise.”
Thank you for reading! Reviews, Comments and Kudos are always welcome! 💛✨💙✨❤✨Also I'm so happy to be back! Updates will be more frequent now 😊
Tony whimpered. “Please Steve…please.” Another soft kiss, below his right nipple before he suckled it. He then administered the same love and attention to his left nipple and Tony’s toes curled, more moans leaving his beautiful mouth. Steve reached his lips again and planted a final kiss there – one that became unbreakable as he sank painfully deep and slowly into Tony.
“You’re disappointed.” Morgan concluded. It wasn’t a question. She knew he was.
“Yes. If only Natasha could have that.” Thor supplied, noticing Bruce’s line of sight. Natasha couldn’t have kids and the thought use to haunt her. Bruce even suggested adopting but she always insisted Nathan was enough and he singled him out from the ocean of people, Morgan wrapped around his arm conversing with their friends.
And Amelia almost laughed. She didn’t have a father. She was the product of her mother being inseminated and she let him know that. Amelia wondered though, after she said it if it was true. She’d never doubted it before but parents lying was like a crazy new trend as of late. She would, however, give her mother the benefit of the doubt stating, “You must have the wrong Pepper Potts.”
. Not yet at least.
At that very moment they heard 2-year-old Harley at the door. Steve thanked God they’d locked the door, or their son would have been scarred for life. “Mommy? Daddy?” he called out. “Morgie crying.”
Tony knocked on the door and called out to her. “Morgan. You okay?” There was no response and it caused Tony to worry. He was about to knock on the door again when she finally answered.
floor. He was dressed in dress pants and a half-buttoned shirt. He greeted Tony by pulling him in for a hug. “Hey. You ready to go?”
“I throw a birthday party for them and they disappear.” Tony mumbled and Steve chuckled. “I feel so underappreciated sometimes.” He went on and Steve tried to brighten his mood.
“When I found out I was pregnant I was excited and ashamed of myself. I’d gotten pregnant by a married man.” He looks to Pepper and mouths an “I’m sorry”. “So I hid it from Tony at first but I was also happy because we’d made a life together.” Steve turned to the jury. “If any of you have kids, you know what it’s like. I only got 3 days with my son.” The room stayed quiet as tears threaten to fall from Steve’s eyes.
She knew her parents meant well. She knew in her heart that they still loved each other but her Dad had broken her Mom’s trust all those years ago and things could never be the same again. She did miss that. But for now she would live vicariously through the Banners. She just needed to soak up all this positive family energy a little while longer and that’s why she chose to spend the night.
she thought. The memory always frightened her. She was afraid of ever trying for a baby and going through the same thing again. She didn’t want to confront that pain – physically and emotionally, ever again. “We’re okay.” Morgan decided. That was the past. They were okay now. He admired her, mumbling loving words into her skin as he kissed her neck. “Something else is on your mind.” She noted.
“Hm…” Pepper started. “Any guesses?”
When Wade entered the room with Ellie, the little girl ran over to Peter upon spotting him. He got down to her level and let her hug him. She’d become very fond of Peter.
Everyone gathered for breakfast and then on the 4
“You knew?!” Peter realized.
“You.” He answered, breathlessly and Steve descended only a moment later, sliding of the sofa and kneeling before Tony, between his parted but jeans-cladded legs. “St-Steve–” He stuttered as Steve unbuttoned his pants and pulled down his zipper.
He’d been shot.
“Hm?”
"What is it, you like about my dad?" Harley snarked, once he was seated by Steve.
“What would you like to do?” She asked because it was clear this wasn’t what he was hoping to hear.
Next Chapter: True Beauty
He wanted to say. He refrained from it, however. Wade approached him, staring him down the way he did earlier but with arousal in his eyes. Peter smiled up at him. What was happening? What happened to waiting until he was legal? And why was he second guessing this? He wanted it.
“Yeah.” She said, nodding and smiling at him. “Just happy to have you and Dad.”
“Because you’re still not over Uncle Thor.” Jacob dared say, all too quickly and he regretted instantly. That was a touchy subject. That was a low blow. That was right below the belt. That was uncalled for. He overstepped, on his own mother for that matter and he knew that wouldn’t sit well with Carol. She was always the stricter parent. She didn’t take any crap.
“Thank you, Anna.” Torunn said, getting up so they could share a hug. Harley followed suit. He knew things would look suspicious if he didn’t play nice with his sister and he didn’t need her or anyone else thinking something was going on.
“Apology accepted mommy, but Nathan and I are moving into our new place at the end of the month.” Morgan explained.
“Why is it always him?”
“Half that.” Tony corrected.
Steve didn’t know why he was letting him speak this long, uninterrupted but then Tony’s voice came ringing in his head.
Just like his brother and sister, he was fully aware of why his parents’ relationship ended but he was always rooting for them to get back together because he knew they still loved each other. Tony and Steve made the decision to never hide anything about the nature of their divorce if they wanted it to go as smoothly as possible. They needed their family to stay intact even if they wouldn’t be together anymore.
“Bullshit!” Stephen screamed, shooting up from his seat and frightening Tony in the process. “Why do you still love him?!” Tony did not appreciate all this shouting he was doing but if he wanted the truth, he’d give him the cold hard truth.
“Okay.” Steve’s voice filled the room. “I’ll meet the guy. I’ll give him a chance.”
“That’s wonderful.”
Peter apologized on his behalf. “Sorry Anna. Wade knows no bounds.”
Justin grew angry at his snide remark and released thousands of missiles at both Tony and Rhodey.
Thank you for reading! If you liked it, what was your favourite part?
“Okay. Let’s not forget it takes two to tango.” Rhodey added. “Steve is just as much to blame or more.” He clarified.
“Hey.” Sam sang out, making room between them so Winter could sit. “What’s up sweetie?” he questioned, staring down at her as she cuddled up into her papa’s metal arm which was expectedly warm from the built-in heaters.
“Anna.” He heard Steve say. “Let him go. We’re not killers.”
Winter glanced down and then back at Bucky. Her brown eyes met his and she finally spoke. “I like girls, Papa.” Bucky’s eyes widened a bit. She was 10 years old. He hadn’t thought she’d be attracted to anyone yet. She hadn’t said she liked Prince Azari. That wasn’t the reason she wanted to be Queen initially, so Bucky hadn’t thought she knew what
“Finished yet?” Steve prompted him. He’d said quite a mouthful at this point and it still hadn’t ticked Steve off. Stephen noticed that. What was that one thing that got Steve Rogers so angry and riled up that all he could do was act?
Steve answered the door, Sam Buck and Pepper close behind. The man spoke before Steve could. “Steve Rogers?” he asked, looking over the other three people around him.
Tony tried to pull further away, but Stephen kept him in place with an arm wrapped around his waist. Tony was at a loss for words and very much embarrassed. He was turning a light shade of red. Stephen stayed calm, cool and collected as he always did.
“Yo también te quiero. Bye mama.”
“I asked Amelia what she knew about it. Remy told her it was
“Everything okay?” he asked, once they’d pulled away.
“Come on Tony...”
But Steve wouldn't let him think on that for long as he took Tony’s glass from him and set it down on the coffee table along with his. Then he was scooting closer to Tony and pressing a kiss to his waiting lips, tasting the remaining droplets of his drink. Tony tried to deepen the kiss - it was the usual reaction - but Steve pulled away and found his bare neck next, suckling on the soft skin.
He didn’t want to be there. Mother insisted and once the kids had caught wind of the situation they wanted to attend as well. The service was longer than expected. Peggy’s work at SHIELD and Stark Industries was highlighted. She had lived a full life. Her children said their piece, Maria said a few words about her longest friend and Sharon managed to sneak in a couple words about her pregnancy with Steve somewhere in her speech.
All while Anna nodded and bowed slightly before her brother and new sister-in-law. “Your highnesses.” She stated, before heading in the direction of her sister.
Winter had entered the room again, teacups in hand and Steve and Buck grew quiet. She put one in front of her papa and the other before her Uncle Steve. She put cookies, cakes and other pastries on everyone’s plates and took her seat.
Pietro hugged his sister, pecked her cheek and took William from her arms. The toddler went to him willingly and held onto Pietro as he did to Wanda. Maybe he could have sensed that this was his new mother’s twin.
Steve was a little concerned, but he tried to not have his fear of Tony ruin his joy. He was ecstatic these last few days. His due date was right around the corner. SJ was almost here and everything was ready for him, thanks to Sam and Bucky. With their help he had also figured out names for SJ. Steve was torn between Nicholas and Hayden.
Peter wasn’t happy about it. Tony was faced with the silent treatment for two weeks and now they were at single word answers on Peter’s part. Tony hated when his kids hated him but
“Of course not.” Tony came back into the room, his hands wrapped around his bump. Steve turned the easel to him; he stared at the sketch in awe. His husband was mind-blowingly good, and he wasn’t just saying that because he loved this man. Steve began circling him until he felt Tony’s naked body being pressed up against his bare chest.
“How so?” Carol wondered, popping a chocolate in her mouth.
He didn’t know what time Wade left or when he fell asleep. He just knew he was sitting at the end of his bed, the last time he saw him and he sure wasn’t there now. Instead he had a blanket wrapped around him but he did remember changing into his pajamas on his own accord. Peter checked his phone; he had 4 unread messages from Wade.
“I don’t think you understand how you made me feel.”
Steve was deep in depression, his children assumed. He’d stopped shaving or getting his hair cut. He never left the house and he indulged in as much junk food as possible. The one productive thing Steven Grant Rogers had brought himself to do these days was working on his art, but his pieces were always melancholic. He was unhappy.
“That.” Morgan stated and effectively interrupting her parents’ make out session. “That right there is why our inheritance is decreasing.” Her words made the couple pull apart but had them smiling sweetly at each other. Five children. They’d be parents to five children.
He nodded. “Thank you Kayla.”
“Oldest trick in the book.” Hope chimed in, before asking Wanda how motherhood had been treating her. Gamora and Pepper joined the group again with more food and Wanda answered in detail. The other women gave their own advice when asked.
Tony ignored the mention of Steve’s infidelity. He didn’t want to think of it when he was with Stephen. “So, you’re just chatting yourself up now.”
“I love you guys.” Winter whispered in the middle of the hug.
“It’s not?” Morgan asked in disbelief, looking up at him from the first time since she sat by him. She watched him pull out his ID for confirmation.
“You don’t think I should?” Clint raised an eyebrow.
Even after they were gone, Tony could feel his heart racing at incredible speeds. He called out for Jarvis. “Jarvis what’s happening?”
Tony and Steve ran over. “What’s going on?” Tony asked and he followed Morgan’s eyes as she stared off at Anna still on the other side of the wall and looking out from the hole she’d created.
“I’ve noticed she spends a lot of time on Earth, brother.” Hela added. Leave it to Hela to keep a close eye on everyone. “Almost as much as Nertha,” and Hela glared at her daughter. Nertha scoffed, continuing her meal.
Turning to face him, Tony leaned back on the dresser and watched Steve as well, who was sitting up in bed, sheets covering his lower half, and a sketch pad and pencil in either hand.
Thanks for reading! If you liked it, what was your favourite part?
“Captain America?” Wade questioned, looking at Peter who nodded at him. Peter knew Wade was a fan of his father more so than his mother, but Wade hadn’t known that Steve was the scarier parent.
“I don’t want us to get our hopes up.” Hammer could have been lying. He didn’t want them to get excited and later disappointed.
“Really?” Nertha spoke, innocently. “Hoping to have mindblowingly, God-like sex with me after that compliment?” But she finished the question with a suggestive smirk.
“Go Harley,” Tony commanded sternly. “Under my roof, my rules. How often do you see your only grandparent? Go spend time with her and your siblings.”
“Wait? What?” Peter was overwhelmed.
Chapter 30: Consider The Debt Repaid
Steve soon joined in and in a matter of seconds she was enveloped in the biggest group hug ever.
“Maybe she’s finally gained an interest.” Torunn informed him, trying to justify Anna’s actions. She didn’t want to believe Anna could have lied to her.
“You know I’ll kill for you.
“Dr Stephen Strange, Mrs. Stark.” He stated and shook her hand. Steve wanted so desperately to get Maria as far away from him as possible. “Tony and I are dating.”
On one of the balconies overlooking the room, Sif oversaw everything. She manged to spare a glance at the wedding invitations resting on the table next to her.
“Just no grandchildren please.” Tony begged. “I’m too young for that.” He loved to point out and casual conversations continued among everyone. Torunn and Harley watched them in disbelief.
Morgan cracked a smile. “Thanks.” She wiped away the stray tears. “You nailed the big brother talk.”
“No.” Wade whispered. “I’m never going to let you go. Never again.” And Peter hoped he meant it. He didn’t need another heartache or heartbreak. “I’m so sorry I left.” He finished. His apology was appreciated but it didn’t, however, explain why he left.
“What was it like when you found out your parents were getting a divorce?”
“Right.” Loki brought everyone’s attention to him. “Where were we?” he thought for a second, hoping to direct his next words to Nertha when Thor entered the room; Sif close behind, with the baby bundled up in her arms.
“Okay. I’ll let that slide because I did kind of oversleep,” she confessed and that wasn’t the usual for Morgan Stark Rogers. She never missed a beat. Everything needed to be perfect. She was super uptight, but Tony eased her out of that the day he noticed that his only daughter was turning into a female version of Steve Rogers. She often mimicked everything her father did as a child and Tony being the complete opposite wasn’t having that. She needed a balance but now she was 70% Steve and 30% Tony.
They talked all the way to elevator and Steve had to ask, “Hey. What do you think of Stephen Strange?”
“That’s fine.” She paused for only a second. “You remember Christine from Leah’s baby shower?” Pepper inquired. Tony nods wondering where all this is going. “She has a friend, a Dr Stephen Strange who happens to be single.”
“Huh?” Tony ceased his movements. He was almost out of his pants now and ready to curl up under his bed covers, alone.
“No.” Morgan began. “Tears of joy. I love it mom. I really do. I’m so happy and grateful I have such amazing parents and a really big family with so much love.” Tony lit up at that and pulled her into a hug. “Thank you.”
“Good.” Kayla stated before moving on to talk of their next appointments.
“Think about it a little longer.” Stephen pleaded. “I just want you to be the mother – the only mother – of my children.” Tony rolled his eyes at that. He knew that was a jab at Steve’s baby mama drama. “Even if it’s just one. I just want it with you.”
Peter mentally thanked Michelle for covering for him. “I think I ate too much.” He lied. “I already went to the bathroom already.” Because that would sell his story.
Then Harley finally found his voice in that moment and spoke up. “Did she tell you she had me under mind control at one point?” He said it as if that might change something.
Sif nodded, looking to Gamora next. “You and Quill?”
A thought sparked in Harley’s head and he narrowed his eyebrows before speaking again. “Does Dad know?”
She was fuming, lightning in her eyes before she excused herself and left the room, hoping to calm herself down. Harley soon went after her.
“I do want you. I love you. I love you so much.”
“You’re right.” He had to agree with that. Natasha Banner didn’t sound right. “You can keep your last name.” he resorted. He was ready for anything she would throw at him.
“Why don’t you want to get married?” He questioned, watching as she took the hand from her cheek and kissed his palm.
Torunn grumbled, falling back on her bed.
“I was going to tell you. I just wasn’t expecting it.” Steve sighed. “I’m sorry.”
“I think he’s going to be okay. Torunn seems like a great girl.” Anna said, as a matter-of-factly. Morgan nodded. She had to agree. Harley and Torunn would learn to love each other, if they hadn’t already and they’d be happy together. The two sisters shared a chuckle, but Anna had not forgotten the thing Morgan didn’t want to discuss.
She tried to hide her blush. She could still sense that her fiancée was bothered by other things. What type of future wife would she be if she did not ask about the things that really mattered? “What else troubles you?”
Thanks for reading guys! Y'all are awesome!
“I told your father I didn’t need a guard,” Sif addressed her daughter and Torunn felt so in the dark, like they were completely omitting something. She was this close to asking them what she had missed when her father spoke up again.
Tony snatched them from Stephen. “It’s really none of your business.” That was harsh. Tony knew it but he didn’t need Stephen Strange making him feel even more like shit right now. So, he walked away but Stephen followed.
“I’m not.” She paused. He held one of her hands. “It’s just her.” Rhodey squeezed her palm gently because, yeah he didn’t want to lose his wife to someone else but they could work pass this.
The next day, Steve moved in. It took less time than they anticipated which was due to the fact that Steve didn't have much things, they later learned. 'Of course he didn't', Harley had said to Peter. 'He's just another golddigger with nothing to his name.'
Harley kept quiet. It wouldn’t have been his first thoughts but at least she was taking precautions. “Oh. Cool.” He wanted to talk about last night. Were they going to make this a thing or –?
“I worried I would be nervous, but I am very excited, mother.” And Torunn beamed with said excitement. “I love him.”
“10:29 am.”  Friday announced.
Harley and Jacob had been home for Christmas break for a few days now and Tony treated Harley like he was his favorite person in the world. His first baby was home and he couldn’t be happier.
“Here's your gift Petey,” he hands off the box to Peter.
he thought.
“He just happens to be almost 30.” Tony said calmly. Harley and Morgan already knew of Wade. They just didn’t know he was pushing 30.
“Ah.” Steve murmured. “There’s that separation anxiety.” He knew this was coming. Tony was so close with each of their children in one way or the other. He always made time for them and he always had a difficult time being away from them. Harley was going to be living on Asgard soon, even further away than MIT. Morgan had moved out and even though it was 20 minutes away, for Tony that was still too far. And finally, Peter and Anna were weeks away from being 18. There was no telling where they might go. He really didn’t have any babies anymore, age-wise.
Besides Steve’s apartment, Tony wasn’t oblivious to Steve’s new hair colour and facial hair. He couldn’t resist poking fun at him. “What’s going on with your hair?” He paused, pushing the hair back out of Steve’s face. “And here I thought you were a natural blonde.”
Peter merely glanced at him mumbling a hello before continuing to the next room. He was obviously still upset about what went down that day, a few weeks ago, when Tony met Wade.
“Sure.” Tony responded, sarcastically.
“You’re going to regret humiliating me Tony.” Justin screamed. This was getting out of control, Tony thought. He and Rhodey hadn’t fought in over five years. They were out of practice and out of shape and too old for this. He was through playing games with Justin. He shot a blast from his suit’s back repulsors that were powerful enough to destroy the source of the missiles and take down most of the ceiling and structure of the building.
“We don’t need to have a fight. Let’s settle this properly.” He glanced around at his family. Before they were escorted out of the ball room and into a sitting room nearby as requested by Steve to Thor. Sif ended the reception right there and all the remaining guests left.
The girls giggled as Steve’s brows raised with pure annoyance, but his lips curled up into a half smile, after hearing the words he had said to Peter minutes ago. He subconsciously rested both hands on Tony’s midsection. Tony panicked however, fearing Steve might be able to tell that he was pregnant.
“I’d like to think, we’d do better this time around.” Steve said, seriously.
After they got through the album, they settled into bed and let the TV play in the background. Morgan couldn’t help but share with him what she was feeling, following dinner.
“I wasn’t expecting that.” Tony stated, keeping his eyes on anything but Morgan.
.” He curled the finger.
“Stephen...” Tony drawled. “Why would you ever want a kid? They’re so much work...” He trailed off. “And it doesn’t get any easier when they get older, you know.” He added as a matter-of-factly.
He could feel his own cock suffering between their bodies and his hole being abused with each thrust. He hadn’t even realized he was coming until, Steve released one of his hands and reached down to touch him, he stopped kissed Tony and put his hand at his mouth to taste Tony’s juices.
Tony continued his train of thoughts. “We always just left most things at a need-to-know basis.” Tony paused, looking from Steve to each of their children’s faces. “This isn’t like a big life-changing secret…”
At that point, she pulled herself up and turned to face Bruce. He was smiling at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners behind his glasses. He pushed a stray hair behind her ear. Nat held unto the hand as it rested on the side of his face.
“Yeah.” Tony brushed it off. “What were you going to say?”
“You had already stolen her ex and now you were acting as s step parent to her kid. A 16-year-old step parent.” Michelle jabbed. “At the time at least.” Peter could understand that. He had grown pretty close with Ellie but he wouldn't title it as
“How do you know my name?”
“Hey sweetie.” Tony noticed, her as she entered the room. He acknowledged her and beckoned her over to join him. He got up to hug her, something he couldn’t stop himself from doing every single day. It was his reminder that she really was back in his life. Anna rested her chin in the crook of his clothed shoulder, savouring her mother’s hug. She never thought she’d ever get to know her real parents.
Wade’s next words were for Peter. “Can you stay over tonight?”
Back in their day when they were having kids, abortion was never an option. Nat in particular took offense.
“Yes.” Tony confirmed. “He said he was there at the bar that night. That’s when he planted the chips on you and Nat.” Steve could vaguely remember seeing a blonde that kept looking their way that night. They’d thought he was interested in Bucky, not that he was planning to chip them. Steve wished he had recognized him, but he’d only ever seen Justin once and never committed his face to memory. He wasn’t relevant. Oh, how wrong he was.
“I thought your Dad was dating that blonde lady. Sarah? Shannon?”
Anna gave her a thankful smile and hug. “I’m so glad you’re joining the family, officially.” Torunn couldn’t stop herself from smiling back at her. “Because who can you trust but family?” Anna added, rhetorically before walking away and leaving Torunn with her thoughts.
“Shuri!” she smiled at seeing Peter. They had met when they were younger than Azari and Winter and kept in contact as much as possible over the years. She had no problem admitting when someone was on the same wavelength as herself and admired Peter’s intellect which was no surprise being Tony Stark’s son. They had shared research in the past. She was even in the process of helping him create a brand new spider suit, as a matter of fact; a kind of iron spider suit. Yet another person who knew he was Spiderman but she had figured it out on her own after years of being friends. Shuri just took one look at footage of him saving people in New York and she stared him dead in the face and said, “I have a few ideas for your suit.” And of course Peter denied it but Shuri reminded him, she wasn’t stupid. She was, after all the head of Wakanda’s Science and Information Exchange and pretty darn good at it.
“As are you Mr. Wilson,” Friday & Karen responded simultaneously. When did Karen and Friday start calling people cool anyways? There were just too many questions with Wade. He pulled out a white box from the draw and waltzed over to Peter.
Tony thanked her and their conversation progressed into talk of her life in her new home, following her move the day after graduation – only a week ago. Amid all that Morgan also managed to send a text in her group chat with her siblings.
Steve and Morgan spoke at the same exact moment almost word for word. Harley sighed. “Yes. I know. But I’m changing my life now…” Nertha’s enchantment really put his life into perspective.
He pulled her to the side. “Amelia’s father is here.” He whispered in her ear.
Eventually they decided, as long as they got to throw him a separate party each year, they let Harley be. Essentially, he had two parties each year. This August, however, for his 20
for only a second before they were fixed on Tony's face again.
was yet.
“Why are you here?”
Steve sympathized with him, patting his shoulder. “You never know until you try Buck.”
They were both silent now. Rhodey was still staring at her. Carol didn’t look away. She didn’t move and neither did he.
Nat had noticed a blonde stealing glances at Bucky and pointed it out. “Bucky, I think that guy is checking you out.” Both Steve and Bucky stopped their drinking to see who Nat was referring to. The guy turned away when all three pairs of eyes were on him. Bucky didn’t buy into it. He wasn’t looking for someone, but he knew that anyone would run away once they realized who he was and the track record that he came with.
“– thinking about Wade,” she finished. Peter had been moping around a lot lately.
“Being inside –” Stephen started up again and that set him off. He didn’t need to hear this. He didn’t need to know this. He tried to hold his tongue, clenched his fist and uttered, “Don’t. Don’t you fucking dare.”
“I just don’t see what the problem is. Your parents made up.” Harley carried on.
“You’re dating doctors now?” he took a breath. “Who are you? And what have you done with Anthony Stark Rogers?” The mention of Rogers stung but he had to remember he never got around to changing his name again following the divorce, so legally he was still Anthony Stark Rogers.
“How does everyone know that?” Tony was flabbergasted; tilting his head slightly to the side with his eyebrows frowned. Why did everyone know this? It had only been two weeks since Tony’s first date with Stephen and yes, everything was going great considering their first date. He had just got back from another date last night, as a matter of fact. It was their 5
Steve rolled his eyes. “I just want at least one of my kids to turn out good.” Morgan and Harley were offended. Steve wondered what his daughter with Sharon would end up being like.
“Nope.” Anna popped the ‘p’ then drank from her drink as well. “Dad’s still in the dumps.” She knew her father missed her mother but not so much that it would drive him to depression.
“I don’t know.” He took a deep breath, trying to settle his nerves. “But I love her. I love her so much.”
“But not on Quill. Father says he’s an idiot. And he’s like 40. He’s our parents age.” Torunn reminded her.
Steve watched Vision searching his face for his reaction. He spoke in agreement with Wanda. “Yes. Wanda and I have done plenty of research on babies. We plan to adopt.”
"For fucksake..." Steve trailed off pushing his hair back with one had.
“I think they’ll be fine regardless of who Uncle Tony ends up with because your parents have managed to resolve their issues after so long.” Amelia did her best to assure Morgan because a small part of her was wishing for something similar for her own parents. “I wish my mom would give Remy a chance.” She whispered. She’d always wanted a second parent in her life, living in her home.
The members of the jury mumble in agreement among themselves. Nova closes with that and Steve gives her a half smile.
“Vis and I are thinking about getting a puppy” Wanda stated. She and Vision had been together for only a year now, travelling the world together and falling in love. It was an odd pair but it worked and no one could deny what they felt for each other. Clint smiled at Wanda and Nat sipped her drink quietly.
“I want this.” She informed him, standing between his legs. He pulled himself up and she initiated another kiss. His hands stayed on her naked waist while her hands lingered in his hair.
Morgan let out a whisper in response, staring back at her reflection. “I don’t feel gorgeous.”
“Sorry Mj. Just –”
birthday party to be better than hers. Last year she was a mess, dealing with the aftermath of a miscarriage, dealing with losing a baby, she and Nathan had fallen in love within the short time they had known about him/her. She wondered what that baby would be like, had they survived. It would have made them very young parents, but they knew they were going to be supported. She sighed.
Lila rejoined the circle. Amelia scoffed at her while Michelle chuckled. Lila still appeared flustered.
Paige, now Anna Marie, had been in and out of foster homes for 13 years following her birth. Then her powers became evident which led to Charles Xavier’s discovery of her and he gladly took her into his school where she could be with people just like her. Life for her was for the most part, happy. Even though she’d never felt the love of parents and her powers made it hard for her have proper physical contact with anyone, she had friends and people she could call family and she was happy.
Bucky chuckled, stood and removed his clothes, exposing his naked body and crawled under the covers. Sam, who was equally naked, hardened at the sight of him. “You’re the only chocolate I want baby.”
Nat finally spoke up, coming to sit by Nathan. Bruce followed. No, he wasn’t the pregnant one, but he needed support too. “You guys are okay. Everything happens for a reason.” She whispered to him.
Sam came out of the kitchen, a water bottle with a straw in it in his hand. He handed it to Steve and Steve struggled to swallow. It was going to be a rough week. Sam spoke up afterwards, “Steve, I’m with Bucky on this. You can’t let him get away with attempted murder. We almost lost you and SJ.”
Tony had his mother sit at the head of the table with him on her left. Torunn was on her right, followed by Morgan, Harley and Steve while Anna and then Peter seated next to Tony. Several empty chairs remained around the other end of the table.
Reviews, Comments & Kudos are always welcome! 💙💛❤
“Steve.” Bucky started, kneeling before Steve and holding on of his hands. “I know you don’t want to talk about this.” Steve made a face. He knew what was coming. He’d mentioned it before. “But, you’ve got to press charges.”
“Dad?” Harley whined. “Seriously? I was just joking you know.” He hadn’t had sex in a while. He didn’t do drugs and alcohol was the furthest thing on his mind.
“Steve,” he missed the way Tony said his name. “What are you doing here?”
Steve was coming to the end of his 6
“Are you two actually fucking? Why are you two still sneaking around?”
Steve was baffled. Tony realized what was happening right away. “You heard?” he asked.
“Strange wouldn’t let me see you so I figured, what good would it do for me to visit you afterwards?” Steve informed him. Tony cast his eyes upon Steve again. He hadn’t known that, but he could understand that.
“I don’t understand how he could cheat on you like that. Anyone that could have you should be grateful. They would be the luckiest person alive.”
"So what happened with Peter's father?"
“You’re a part of the X-men?” Peter questioned his newly found twin. It was another family dinner night and the entire family was seated at the table in the Stark Mansion. They’d only gotten Anna back a week ago and everyone was doing their part in making her feel welcomed into her family. That included anyone with the name Rogers or Stark and of course Torunn whom still lived at the Mansion.
Peter took back his seat so he could process the information. “Alright. ’Say it was her who killed Hammer. Does that mean she’s been working with Hammer from the start? Since we were babies?” Peter asked in disbelief. Did that mean their Aunt Nat wasn’t really chipped that one night she had slept with their father? Was that just hers and Hammer’s plan?
P.S. Do any gifs of Steve & Tony having sex exist? 👀
Tony snatched the phone from Peter’s hand, stepping outside of Morgan’s room before responding for Peter. Morgan didn't need to hear this. Peter finally moved from his spot and went to Morgan’s side. “Steve?”
And Tony releases him, scanning the area for bystanders before speaking, “Is this a joke, Steve?” Because it’s really not funny.
“It’s been a long night.” He continued, closing his eyes and getting even more comfortable in bed. “I just want to rest right now.”
Bucky almost lost it. “As he fucking should! He tried to kill you.” Buck sat beside him now, looking Steve dead in the eyes. “He was going to kill you.” He whispered and that was the sad truth.
Peter pulled back to arms-length. Of course, he’d keep her secret. He knew what it was like dating an older guy. Mom and Dad went crazy about Wade. There was no telling what they’d do if they found out about Remy and Anna. Remy was Amelia’s father and their age. Anna was only 17. That wasn’t okay or appropriate at all. But he and Anna were only three months away from their 18th birthday. He could keep quiet until then.
Hela on the other hand, enjoyed being a member of the royal family, a Princess no less. It was what she deserved considering how Odin had pinned them against each other in their fights and squabbles for the throne. He smiled at his older sister when their eyes met from across the room. There was a hint of a smile on her lips with a sulking Nertha by her side.
Tony sighed. “You know I’m your boss, right?” He folded his arms over his chest. He was the boss. The company was his, if he bothered to take over the operations from Stane.
“I don’t believe that.” Pepper concluded.
He had been admitted to the hospital Stephen worked at and as head doctor,
Nat settled down on Bruce’s lap. “Thank you for always backing me up. I love you.”
“Mhm.” Steve hummed for confirmation. He was at Sharon’s shower for a full 10 minutes before he got annoyed with her and left. “It would have also been my wedding anniversary with Tony, today.” It was September 17
“Well...”
When a day passed, and Tony hadn’t woken, Steve begged his kids to go home and get some rest. He promised he’d call them when Tony woke. They left reluctantly.
“Talk to me Tony.” He begged. Tony straightened up, wrapping his arms around Steve. Steve welcomed the embrace, being careful not to squeeze too tightly as he lifted Tony’s feet off the ground.
“What will you do, then brother?” Hela drew closer.
Of course the couple argued that they were ready and no, Peter wasn’t pregnant. That wasn’t why they were
“Baby. You didn’t even look.” Steve sighed, trying to appreciate his own work.
“Don’t. Just don’t,” Tony seemed conflicted with himself as he got up to leave. “Nice chat.”
Tony felt a ‘but’ hanging in the air. “But?” he provided.
“No!” Ned tried to convince him otherwise. “It’s like a group thing.”
Wade was smiling at him and for the third time that morning, he was blushing again. It wouldn’t be such a bad thing to sleep over at Wade’s and Ellie would be there. They wouldn’t do anything with Ellie a door away. They just had less than a month to go – Peter would be 17 soon and it would be perfectly legal for them to…do the deed.
“Wade! You can’t just sneak into my room like that?” Peter began, wondering out loud why Friday or Karen hadn't informed him about Wade's trespassing. He was dressed in regular clothes for the first time with a jacket and oddly enough his Deadpool mask covering his face. How long would he keep that a secret?
“Not right now. No.” He admitted, a glint of deviousness in his eyes while Pepper let out a small gasp. She realized she didn’t know Remy that well but as a woman running half of a billion-dollar company, she knew men like him, powers or not she knew conniving men, well. “Look, she’s old enough to make her own decisions.” He paused, having to refrain himself from using his powers to coax her into ending this retched conversation sooner rather than later. “I’ll admit though, I did try to corrupt her –”
