“You said something along the lines of how you just had to wait a few more days before you moved to Lebanon for ‘
“Yeah,” he answers breathlessly, his hands clammy as they hold the phone tighter, arms wrapping around his spare pillow wishing it was the man’s warm body instead, “Please call me if I don’t, though.”
“Good morning, Dean,” he says fondly looking at the sleepy man as he nuzzles his face into his lap, breathing in the familiar scent.
Taking the backpack off in a fluid motion, Dean drops it against the tree trunk behind him before glancing at the angel, a hopeful look on his face, “
He groans, rubbing his eyes once before he unlocks the door, the read head barging in with no hesitation as she locks it behind her enclosing the both of them inside. The tight space would have been uncomfortable with almost anyone else he knew, but it was Charlie.
Walking into the main room, Sam looked slightly relieved, his eyes widening when they landed on the angel.
“It’s not nothing,” Charlie’s hand comes up to fix his hair gently, Dean closing his eyes at the feeling as he breathes deeply.
“Thanks,” Dean mumbles back, continuing forward, and if Castiel feels Dean lean back slightly into his hand, he doesn’t comment on it.
that makes you feel like running your fingers through it every time you look at it.” Dean groans as the redhead repeats the words he had said one night after a little too much vodka, “And those
“Hey Cas, stop.” Dean places a finger against his pale lips before cupping his face, “It’s fine. I was just scared that something might have happened to you or that you had…” he trails off, “I could hardly function for the next four days until I finally asked Sam about you. That idiot refused to give me any information about you. He believes that everything that happened is his fault because he was the one who introduced us. Thank god for Eileen who then later called me and told me that if I wanted to talk to you, then I should come here tonight.”
“Good morning, Dean,” he says, running his hands down the man’s naked chest before finally coming to rest on his hips, tracing a nonsensical pattern on the warm skin.
“Stop being dramatic,” Charlie replies, stepping back into the bathroom with a black leather jacket that he vaguely remembers buying in a thrift store almost six months ago. Handing it out to Dean, she says, “Put it on.”
“But if you do,” Castiel ignored his comment, “I want you to call me when you are completely sober.”
“Good,” the angel picks up the tray between them, carelessly dropping it on the table with one hand before twisting around to straddle the hunter, less than a hair's breadth between their lips as Castiel says, “I love you so much.”
,” he says into the night, frustration seeping into his bones as he hurls his phone across the rocky ground, regretting it moments later when his brain catches up with his actions, the sound of plastic crashing into the ground loud in the silent night.
“Baby,” Castiel says with patience, having learned early in the relationship that Dean didn't react well when woken up by someone, he continues stroking the man's hair, allowing him to wake up on his own.
“Not until last night when this guy called me at 4 in the morning drunk out of his mind as he finally told me about
“It was pretty boring anyway,” Meg replies, thrusting out a cup filled with what smells like whiskey in his hand. He rolls his eyes, deciding to not call her out on the lie as places the cup on his nightstand before he shrugs off his sweaty clothes and into something more comfortable.
Dean stirred slightly, Castiel’s eyes fixed on his face, unblinking as he commits each and every second to memory, green eyes fluttering open as they meet his, soft smile tugging on his lips mirroring Castiel’s.
he thought, downing his drink in one go. He was going to trust Sam and go through with it. What did he have to lose after all, well except
Sighing softly, Castiel answers with a hint of sadness in his voice, “I had planned so many things for today but first the case took longer than expected and now we are not even home for your birthday and now its raining and I should have known but I forgot to-”
“It’s going to rain soon,” the angel says after a while, “We should head back to the motel before that.”
Sam just nods in response, a few minutes passing before he declares, “I’m taking the next week off to help you pack.”
The human laughs, shaking his head before he picks up one of the paper cups from the tray, inhaling the strong smell before taking a long sip.
She lightly pats his arm, gesturing towards the end of the park with her head, “We can head up to the top of the hill if you want. It would have a much better view and there are a lot less people there.”
“Cas,” Dean cuts him off, “This was the best birthday ever and I won’t change a single thing about it. Understood?”
His brain asks him to just let it go while his heart urges him to pick it up just one more time, if only to hear the deep voice one more time. He hates himself as his thumb swipes across the screen, accepting the call.
Castiel stops tracing the small scar at the corner of Dean’s eye, tilting his head in confusion, “Why?”
Dean doesn’t know how long they stand there like that, wrapped in each other in the middle of the park, and honestly, he doesn’t care. All he cares about is the warm figure pressed against him and the million words about to fall out of his mouth. When they finally step back just enough to look each other in the eye, everything else fading away when the green meets blue, Dean’s head leaning into the rough palms caressing his jaws as a thumb slowly moves against his cheek.
He stares at the man, gaze traveling over his body as he ignores the redhead nudging him from his side. No matter how much Dean tried, he had never been able to forget the feeling of the muscles as they moved under his fingers, warm weight on top of him, pinning him down into the sheets until the small hours of the night. Dean still remembers the strong musky scent surrounding him as he wakes up, light streaming through the blinds and falling on his bare skin as he places the lightest kisses across the man’s exposed neck. He hates how he can still feel himself drowning in all the sensations the other man made him feel, eyes fluttering shut as he lets his control go, letting the gentle currents of the wind lead him away, sure but soft hands coaxing every last feeling out of him until he is left sprawled out naked and defenseless.
Less than half an hour later, he is sitting in the middle of some random persons living room, a half-empty red cup in his hand, his other arm wrapped around Charlie as they converse with a girl named Anna who looks maybe a bit too interested in him to make him feel comfortable around her.
Dean Winchester sits on the bathroom counter, shifting ever so slightly every few seconds, trying to shake off the nerves he was feeling. This would be the first party he would be attending ever since he came out in the middle of the cafeteria two weeks ago in the most embarrassing way. In his defense, it had been a dare from his friend and Dean Winchester never backed out on a dare and so in less than a minute, he was standing on the table shouting about his obsession with western movies and another minute later he was being dragged back by his friends as he tried to beat the shit out of a homophobic asshole.
“You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this,” he murmured, the movement of his lips tickling the tender skin of Deans’ neck.
The words feel searing and Castiel feels like he will drown if they don’t kiss again. So he moves his head with purpose, blindly seeking Dean’s mouth in the dark of the room.
Before he can wrench his hand free, Castiel tightens his grip, “Maybe next time,” he says, his head shaking fondly, “Let’s just stand under the tree and wait for the rain to pass.”
. I already said the words before, but you were too drunk to remember and I just want you to know that I do. You don’t need to-”
He jumps suddenly when a hand grips his wrist before he feels a thumb stroking the inside of his hand, a too-familiar voice whispering millimeters away from his ear.
“Now it is,” she grins at the exasperated look on his face, her eyes widening when they land on something over his shoulder, “Incoming at 6-o’clock.”
“I was going to tell you this weekend after I finalized the house,” he replies, mentally preparing himself for the dreadful conversation that he knew was coming.
“Because you don’t need me the way I need you. You already have Meg.” Dean tries to keep his tone neutral as he says the name.
“Dean,” Sams’ voice pulled him back into the present, “Are you planning to be this moody all night or are you actually going to loosen up a bit.”
Minutes pass before he finally finds the broken device, hitting it against his palm as he tries to switch it on, a steady stream of curses escaping his lips as the cracked screen refuses to light up.
A small noise comes from the phone signaling the end of the message, cutting him off moments before he can-
The hunter turns to look at him, thinking for a second before speaking, “Why do you have to be always right?”
“You don’t just leave a voice message at fucking four-o’clock in the morning mentioning how you are sitting on the edge of a cliff drunk out of your mind and then completely
Almost halfway down the trail, the first few drops fall, a steady shower following soon after as the hunter shares a look with his soon-to-be husband, eyes glinting, “Race you to the car.”
“I’m going to get another drink,” Sam cut him off, “Heaven knows that I need it if I’m going to be stuck here with you and your denial.”
“Yeah,” Castiel answers, rubbing his hands down his arms looking towards the firepit and the bunch of blankets stacked a few feet away, “But let’s get into a blanket before I turn into a popsicle.”
“Let’s go to the kitchen,” Charlie shouts, head tilting towards the doorway to punctuate her sentence.
Dean heard a hushed, “I don’t think this is appropriate.” followed by “Don’t worry, you look absolutely gorgeous.”
His sentence is cut short as the front door opens again, his eyebrows furrowing before he recognized the familiar footsteps on the wooden floor. He sees a head peeking through the gap in his door before the woman enters his bedroom, flinging herself on the mattress without a single word to him, she glances at his brother, “So I guess you found out about Lebanon too.”
“I would have gotten up to make you some coffee, but you just didn’t want to let me go and I honestly didn’t feel like leaving you too.”
Dean had known that the banshee’s pattern was to go after the “most vulnerable” person in the nursing home.  Although he hadn’t foreseen that this would be him, when he first heard the banshee’s screams, he somehow wasn’t surprised.
“We’ll find something tomorrow,” Dean reassured him.  He was hard, and (unfortunately) awake, and he sleepily rubbed himself against Castiel without thinking.  The angel let out a groan that was halfway between pleasure and pain.
The bond between them was too powerful to ignore.  It had started, Dean understood, due to his Mark of Cain.  Amara said, “You’re the one who set me free.  It was destiny.  You bore the Mark.  I am the original Mark.  You and I will be together.”
“And it doesn’t have to change anything, no,” added Castiel.  “Rather, the bond has kept us alive when we otherwise would have passed on.  First, during the Apocalypse.  Our bond was unexpected.  When the other angels felt I was getting too close to you, they forbid me from ever seeing you again.  But when they tortured me and found out about the bond, they decided perhaps I could be used to coerce you to do things.  So long as they kept me under their control, of course.”
“He was compromised,” Castiel said, but it sounded robotic, almost rehearsed.  The angel stood up.  “He came at me.  I killed him in self-defense.”
Castiel tried not to be resentful that Dean hadn’t said “I love you” in return and had instead pretended to be asleep.  (Castiel had rebuilt Dean entirely after Hell and was more than capable of telling whether the man was truly asleep or not.)  He tried not to be resentful that Dean wasn’t able to discuss certain things with him, that he wasn’t willing to try the bottom position during sexual intercourse, and that he was hiding something about the Darkness.
Dean awakened when he felt the bed shift around him.  He felt Castiel’s arms slide out from around him, and he heard the rustling of Castiel’s belongings as he finished packing.  He opened his eyes groggily.  “Are you taking off?”
“Whatever,” said Sam, interrupting Dean’s train of thought.  “We’re almost there, man.  Make a right up here.”
Castiel hadn’t even fought!  There had definitely been an odd moment in the warehouse where he had cowered in fear…
“I’m the one who will have to watch you murder the world,” said Castiel fiercely.  “So if there’s even a small chance we can save you, I won’t let you walk out of this room.”
“Yes, they’re real,” he said.  “And they’re being sold for much lower than they might be, much lower even than I expected.”
“It might take a few weeks, actually,” Castiel said, and when Dean gave a brief frown, Castiel wondered if perhaps he should stay until morning.  Humans were all about balance, after all.  Dean had seemed worried and annoyed that Castiel never left the bunker, but Castiel knew Dean also hated it when Castiel was gone for too long.
“So how are things in Heaven?” Castiel asked Kelvin once they were both seated at a local restaurant.
The sun was dying.  Lucifer, the angels, the demons, and even the witches had fought against Amara and lost, and now God, his beloved father, was dying.  Castiel understood that without God, the Darkness would overwhelm everything.
The only thing Dean knew for sure was that feelings in general were uncomfortable and annoying and best drowned in whiskey, unless he has a solitary night to himself.  It had taken him the better part of a year after Purgatory to admit to himself that he was attracted to Cas.  The two of them certainly didn’t have time to navigate this… this
Castiel scooted off of the mattress and turned over so that he could see the man he loved in the bunker’s dim lighting.  He looked peaceful in sleep.
Castiel could tell that Sam was angry with Dean.  The group stopped at the side of the road on the way back to the bunker so that Castiel could begin the healing.
Castiel maneuvered Dean backward onto his hotel bed carefully, standing backward for a second to look at Dean spread out below him. Dean could feel Castiel’s eyes washing over his body and began to give an irritated retort, but the look in Castiel’s eyes stopped him short - love, heat, and something else, like an otherworldly predator.
“Dean, I’m sorry I deceived you,” he said.  “It was my burden, to kill an innocent child.  I’ve seen nephilim who didn’t understand what they were doing burn down cities, kill off entire civilizations…. I thought it was the only way.
There was something odd in Dean’s voice, Castiel registered.  It was lower, huskier than usual.  He must be responding to the Angel Amore, as Castiel had predicted.  The angel held back a shiver of pleasure.  “I’ve… wanted, yes,” said Castiel slowly.  “Not as… potent… as a human, perhaps, at least… not until now, but I’ve…”
Castiel began to feel as if he were missing something big.  It didn’t happen to him as often as it used to, but occasionally he still felt as though he had missed major concepts in human customs.  “Dean, I don’t understand.”
Dean regretted that now.  He had been scared, then, of himself and his feelings, and what it might mean.  And, in the process, he had hurt Castiel’s feelings.
“Dean, I don’t have a lot of time, so listen,” he said into the payphone.  He missed his wings.  The grace he had stolen gave him his angel powers back, but nothing would bring back his wings.  “The leader of the opposition is an angel named Malachi.”
Cas had already gotten lube from somewhere when Dean was distracted, and Dean felt it – a somewhat wet feeling where he wasn’t used to it, but not altogether bad.  When Castiel’s fingers entered him for the first time, he expected pain, but of course there was none.  The sensitivity around that area seemed to magnify what Castiel was doing with his mouth.  Castiel’s wet heat was meant not as a means to an end, he understood now, but to distract, and this wasn’t so bad.  This was actually-…
“I’m James Carmichael,” said Castiel.  “And this is my husband, Walter Cannon.”  He put his arm on Dean’s shoulder tentatively, imitating Justin and Tyler’s public display of affection.  Dean’s heart seemed to stop in his chest.
“Naomi,” Castiel said.  “An angel.  She’s in charge of Heaven.  She led the angels who got me out of Purgatory.  She’s been… in my head.  And I didn’t even realize, not really… what month is it?  How long have I been in Heaven?”
“I would say that you're lying,” Castiel snapped.  Something like hope rose up in him and he stomped it out quickly.
Even before Cain’s death he had been agitated constantly, biting Sam’s and Castiel’s head off over every little thing.  Really, it was a wonder Castiel had stuck around so long before he had gone to find Cain.  It was a wonder he had come back again, at least for the time being.
Castiel sighed again.  “Dean, when I raised you from Hell, and we formed our bond… it was unsafe for anyone to know about it,
Castiel nodded.  “It would be nice to sleep on a bed for once,” he said, getting into the Impala.  “I never realized how uncomfortable it is for humans to sleep on the ground.”
Castiel closed his eyes, rolled the feeling of jealousy over in his mind a few times, and then realized that Dean was expecting a response.  “Why are you telling me this?”
“That’s better,” Dean said huskily, thrusting forward himself.  Their erections slid against each other, the space between them diminishing, and everything was suddenly hot.  Castiel needed
“You misunderstand me,” said Castiel gently.  “I have put you above my priorities and duties several times,
Dean went, and they switched positions until they laid side by side, facing each other.  Dean’s heart stopped pounding in fear, and he shook off the last vestiges of the horrible nightmare.
“I’m going to go visit Ladyheart’s manager in the morning, and Feathers here is planning to pay a visit to Ladyheart’s bandmate to try to find this mysterious come-back show.”
He snuck into their mansion in Louisiana, where he was confronted with seven gunmen and multiple Stynes.
After the eighth injection, Dean awakened again.  Sam and Castiel were overjoyed to realize that the cure had worked!
Castiel struggled away from Lucifer.  “You wanna play that way?” Lucifer taunted, and punched him repeatedly in the face.  He was fighting all of them at once, and winning.
Dean looked at his watch.  If Crowley had been right about the Angel Amore wearing off after six hours, he had perhaps thirty minutes left.  Perhaps a shower was in order.
Castiel thought about protesting, but the thought was banished when Dean’s mouth found his again.  Dean began tugging on Castiel’s suit, and at that point it became obvious what Dean was trying to do.  The angel snapped his fingers and both of their clothes disappeared, rearranging themselves into piles in the corner.
Life went on, however.  After Purgatory, Dean and Sam had met up with the prophet Kevin Tran, who was currently in possession of the demon tablet.  The demon tablet, when properly translated, had a way to lock demons in Hell forever.  Sam and Dean were searching for both Kevin and the tablet, but it was slow-going.  They had been taking other jobs until they got a lead.
Dean headed to the kitchen to get a beer, and there he spent a melancholy couple of hours drinking beer while looking at pictures of his mother.
Dean was nursing his second glass of whiskey when Little Cas emerged from his room, freshly showered.  “I’m going out, D,” he said.  “I’ll be back by 11.”
Dean changed the subject.  “So what are you gonna do if you find Kelly and, uh, Lucifer Junior?  It is a Nephilim, right?”
It took a full two minutes before either of them bothered to speak.  Finally Dean moved to grab something to wipe off with before Castiel, guessing his intention, held out a towel that had been magically summoned from the bathroom.
Both men had lapsed into a brief silence, watching a man shooting arrows on the screen.  Then at the same time, they said, “Damn, that’s sweet!”
Then Castiel remembered Heaven, the beautiful gardens, the Heavenly Host’s love... he missed it terribly.
Finally, in early April, Dean, Sam, Crowley, and Rowena worked out a decent plan to trap Lucifer, which predictably went almost immediately awry.  Lucifer was simply too powerful for any trap they knew how to set.  Crowley (also predictably) disappeared as soon as things began to go south, and Dean and Sam were left to face Lucifer’s wrath.
“Well, look around,” Metatron said, chuckling.  “You've seen Earth.  You've had a taste of free will.  I’ve got to ask you -- do you like it?  I mean, the way you've flocked off to follow Castiel tells me you need to follow someone.  It's in your DNA.  But Cas -- he's not what you think he is.  He sends angels out to die.  Have you told them about your stolen grace, Castiel?  How it's fading away, and when it burns out, so will you?”
“Joshua?” asked Castiel.  He remembered the angel from the Apocalypse that had explained that God had abandoned them.  Joshua was often called “The Garderner”, but he very rarely got his hands dirty.  “I thought he stepped aside.”
Sam had no response for a second.  Suddenly he seemed to sag, and he reminded Dean of the four-year-old that had beat up a bully on the schoolyard and was certain he’d be in trouble for it.  “It’s Eileen,” he said softly, defensively.  “We’re never exactly gonna have a… conventional life.”
Finally Castiel had finished removing (and folding) his clothing, and he moved toward Dean in the tub.
Lucifer’s obvious hatred for the brothers was another major problem.  God stopped Lucifer from doing his worst, however.  On one occasion, Lucifer tried to kill both brothers, which God prevented effortlessly.
A few hours later, Dean showed up at the door to Castiel’s hotel room.  He seemed slightly agitated, though Castiel was unsure why.
“Nobody, obviously,” Dean snapped.  “There’s no signal with the bunker shut down.  I’m just listening to voicemails.”
Castiel considered, but his eyes turned sad.  “I can’t just…”  He swallowed around a lump in his throat.  “I can’t have just… sex with you, Dean.  I can’t-…”  His voice turned into a choke, and he looked away.
“Oh, c’mon, Dean,” Sam protested as he ran forward to get the suitcases.  “I mean, you guys have been making dove-eyes at each other forev – dude, c’mon, I’m gonna hafta bleach my eyes!”
push forward, fully erect and captivated by Castiel’s wet heat.  It was a tight fit even with the lube and Castiel’s angel powers, and Dean stopped to allow Castiel to get used to the size.
Dean quickened his pace through the hallway, guilt lancing through him sharply.  He knew Lucifer was trying to bait him, and he was determined to get away from the angel before he did something really, really stupid.
only if we don’t manage to kill him with the angel-killing bullets you told me about before he gets that far.”
“Great,” Crowley said sarcastically, excusing himself from the gigantic bed he was sharing with three women.  “It really wasn’t worth disrupting my orgy to tell me that you
Castiel ended the call abruptly with, “Goodbye.  It may be some time before we see one another again.”
Sometimes Benny would put his arm around Dean in a friendly way.  (“I’ve been here before, and you’re in for a treat, Brother,” he said, guiding Dean over to a clump of bushes with leaves that he promised were not only edible, but quite tasty.)
Dean felt as though his stomach had dropped through the floor.  “Look, Cas,” Dean said, standing up finally and facing the angel.  “I know how I feel.  That’s not it.  I don’t…”
“Nah, man, I’m just saying we’ve passed our prime,” said Dean.  “That’s all.  C’mon.  We’ve got vampire mimes to kill, and work to do.”  And he shut the trunk.
Dean had had a great night hustling pool and getting drunk.  When he came back to the Impala in the early morning, it was only to find a very naked blond girl in the back seat with his brother.
It occurred to Dean with a shock that he’d never actually thought about a relationship with Castiel before, at least not in that way.  In his mind, Dean had referred to his attraction to Castiel as “that thing between them.”  Even when he had touched himself to thoughts of Castiel, which had admittedly happened a fair few times, he had never really considered a
Dean rolled his eyes, but he smiled, remembering his revelation in Hell when Castiel had arrived.  He remembered the memories assaulting him, remembered being certain he would never be worthy enough to face Sam again.
“Well...” said Castiel, processing Sam’s words.  “I'm not trying to... play God.  I'm just trying to get my people home.”
Dean saw red.  The Mark of Cain and his own emotions swirled into one big monstrous red cloud.  He would deal with Sam, Cas, and the Book of the Damned later…
Dean tried not to think too much about his friendship with Castiel over the next few hours.  On the one hand, whatever they had was…
Dean was sleeping soundly beside him, his right leg touching Castiel’s left, and there was something very human, very domestic, about waking up beside him.  Was this what other couples did every day?  The last time he had needed to sleep had been over a year ago, after the beast spell, and Castiel realized that he had missed waking up next to Dean.
Castiel’s face turned shocked, then amazed, then finally a wide grin split his face.  “I love you too, Dean,” he said, pulling Dean close to him.
Dean and Castiel took a ride in the impala.  Cas smiled in the passenger seat, and it was so similar to so many years ago that it might have been a memory…
Dagon looked between Castiel and Kelly, who was breathing hard.  “Wow!  You two got so close!  If I hadn’t made it here at the last possible second…”
Castiel lined himself up with Dean and gave a quick thrust, plundering Dean’s mouth with his tongue.
Dean’s hand had stopped moving in his bliss, but it was still wrapped tightly around Castiel’s cock, and he thrusted into it.  Dean spasmed within him, phantom thrusts nailing his prostate teasingly, and Castiel felt his own pleasure coiling as well.
Finally, the two of them walked into a large hallway.  “Right this way,” said a portly looking man.  “Mr…”
“Cas,” Dean said weakly, begging.  “Cas!  I know you're in there.  I know you can hear me.  Cas... It's me.”
“Dean!”  he yelled, running forward to feel for a pulse on the teenager.  He was dead, of course.  “What have you done?  You killed him.”
“What’s wrong?” asked Dean from behind him, concerned.  It was early in the morning, perhaps 4AM, and Castiel’s tossing and turning had awakened him from a dream that was (for once) not about death and Hell.
Talking right now went against everything in Dean’s nature, but he had a bad feeling that he wasn’t going to get another chance.  Still, time stretched on and Dean said nothing.
“I was angry with you, but… I got past it,” Dean said.  “I know you did what you thought you had to.”
“That's not what he was doing,” said Hannah.  “Roll it back.  There.”  Hannah pointed to a girl sitting in a booth at the ice cream shop.  “That was an angel – Esther.  She's one of Metatron's.”
Dean pulled over to the side of the road, still recovering from the shock of Crowley and Castiel appearing in his back seat.  He pulled his gun out, stabbing at the stereo with his elbow to turn off whatever song had come on after “Angel with a Shotgun.”
“Our bond is stronger, more meaningful,” Castiel said, looking proud now.  “And not as easily broken.”
“You know, when I knew Castiel, he was a soldier,” Ishim was saying.  “He was a warrior.  He was an angel's angel.”  Ishim looked at Dean and Sam.  “Now look how far he's fallen.”
Both man and angel were mostly silent, until Sam finally said, “Dean finally told me about everything.”
Despite Castiel’s insistence that he didn’t sleep, the angel had been sleeping even more often than Dean.  Each day, however, he looked more tired and strained.  At times, he began to shudder or convulse.  “I’m drawing on my grace to keep the spell at bay,” he explained to Dean.  “It’s weakening me, but at least I’m still in control.  But it’s not infinite, and my grace can’t heal or replenish while I’m in this condition.  I need to find something-…”
Crowley, apparently, had perverted the spell they had used to put Lucifer back into the cage.  He had wanted to keep Lucifer on a chain to threaten his enemies in Hell.
Once they arrived, T.L. headed to a different corner of the room, but Castiel could still feel the man’s eyes on him.
“Dean!” Cas exclaimed, and it was louder than it would’ve been in Purgatory, and Dean found that he liked it.  Dean wove his hand between the two of them roughly, grabbing their cocks, and trying to control his own ragged breath.
He could see Castiel’s flash of a smile.  The angel’s words continued to bother him, though, even as he drifted back to sleep.
“It saved you again when Naomi had control of my mind,” Castiel said.  “I could not kill you due to our bond.  It was too strong.
For the auction, everyone returned to the seats they had sat in for their dinner.  Prisha and Imanu were back, once again taking up more than half of the space at the table between his large body and her service dog.  Dean no longer minded being close to Castiel, however.  So long as he could keep control of his angel friend, a small part of him wanted to appreciate Castiel’s advances while he still could.
Sam didn’t come back until the next day, and he didn’t say a word to Castiel or Dean about the reason he left.
Dean said again, sharper.  He moved Castiel away from him and took both of his arms, forcing Castiel to look into his eyes.  He took a shuddering breath.  “Man, I’ve waited for this for a long time.  And I don’t know… I don’t know what I want, or how we’re gonna make this work.  But what I do know is that when we get out of here and get you cured of the Angel Amore, if you still want to, just let me know and we can do everything you’re trying to start right now.  Okay?”
He reached out to touch Dean’s hand, and the other man pulled him into his arms.  It was odd – the few times that Castiel had fantasized about a situation like this, Dean always seemed far less sure of himself, far less willing… but perhaps that was the Angel’s Amore.  Dean held him tightly, but he also held his hips far enough away that Castiel couldn’t tell whether or not he was erect, for which he was grateful.  It didn’t matter anyway, because Castiel felt as though his mind had exploded simply from finally being in Dean’s arms.  The song was slow, and Castiel felt Dean brushing his hand along his neck, over his hairline and slightly under his collar.  It felt like that area was on fire.
Then Dean leaned forward so that his lips were touching the shell of Castiel’s ear.  “No, Cas.  It’s always been you.”
Dean turned back just long enough to shoot Castiel a glance of apology.  There would be time for them, later.  Then he climbed into the Impala and drove away.
Dean wasn’t attracted to men, for the simple reason that his father wouldn’t have stood for it.  He occasionally had thoughts about men, but he reassured himself that that didn’t mean that he was gay.  After all, he was (this he knew for sure) extremely attracted to women, and there were quite enough of those to go around.
Still, as Sam repeatedly pointed out, “No one – not you, not Dean – not anybody can tell me what those consequences are!”  More importantly, Castiel failed to see another way to solve the problem.  He didn’t want to kill his friend – he was no longer even sure that he could.  Therefore, he assisted Sam in his plans for the Book of the Damned with renewed energy.
“Sure,” Dean said finally.  Yeah, we could help.  Gotta make sure you don't do anything else stupid.”
Castiel was still worried about whatever was making Dean agitated, but as the evening wore on, he began to relax.  Whatever was making Dean nervous wasn’t a life-or-death situation; the two of them had been through enough of those together for Castiel to identify that this time was different.  He supposed Dean would tell him when he was ready.
When he regained control of himself once again, he was kneeling, covered in blood, and all of the loan sharks were dead.
“So, in the event that I’m gone for more than a month, with no word,” Castiel said, steeling himself resolutely, “you may sleep with other people, free of guilt.”
there – wasn’t used to his charges being awake and self-aware.  God has no power in the Empty… only Jack could have done that.
“Very much,” said Castiel, and finally the angel moved.  Each article of clothing was discarded, painfully slowly, onto a pile on the sink beginning with Castiel’s shoes.
Trigger warning for brief mentions of rape.  This won’t be mentioned for the rest of the fic, don’t worry.  Please don't be angry with me.
Another month passed with no word from Castiel.  Kevin was able to translate the second of the three trials needed to close the gates of Hell, which was to take an innocent soul from Hell and return them to Heaven.  Dean recruited Benny’s help, and Benny sacrificed himself in order for Sam and Dean to successfully complete the trial.
Dean looked further beyond the parking lot.  At the other end of the lot stood a sprawling building.  It was clearly an old building, though it appeared in perfect repair.  It was the only building for as far as the eye could see, and was surrounded on all other sides by lush, manicured landscaping.
And here they were, facing danger side by side, like normal.  It was as he had said earlier – they would “work through their crap” later.
So Castiel had resolved a long time ago that the only thing he would receive from Dean was his friendship.  And this was okay, because, as an angel, Castiel once again had control over both his vessel and his mind, and so he was happy with things as they were.
“Please,” she begs, getting ready to pull the bigger guns out if he refuses, aka the puppy eyes she learned from Sam, “You will look awesome!”
“You need a refill,” the redhead maneuvers her way past the hallway and into the kitchen, which was thankfully less crowded than the living room.
Castiel ducks in to capture his lover’s lips, both of them ignoring the vibrating phone on the table, everything else forgotten as they melt into each other.
Castiel gazes down at the man, his head on his lap as the angel carefully traces an unidentifiable pattern on his face, feather-light touches moving across the freckled skin, his other hand buried in the soft golden strands of the hunter’s hair. His lips mirror the soft curve of a smile on the human’s face, mind captivated by the relaxed features.
“Let’s hurry now,” he said instead, “There is only so long that Sam can keep up with an excited Jack.”
“That dickhead doesn’t deserve a reply after that,” Charlie shrugs, placing the device on the other bed before shuffling up the bed. He just picks up his cup from the table and joins her, leaning back on the wall as he tries to get comfortable, the drink sloshing dangerously with each movement of the mattress.
“Come over after,” Castiel says, more of a question than a statement, “Gabriel won’t be back until tomorrow afternoon,”
“I told you, we could stay in tonight,” he says finally, his voice hoarse, forehead resting against the other mans’.
"I love you too," Dean smiles, his heart bursting in his chest as he crashes their lips together in a bruising kiss.
“Shut up, grumpy man,” Charlie said, stepping aside to let the hunter finally take a look at the angel. And by god, he did look absolutely gorgeous.
The angel froze under Deans’ hands, making the hunter curse inwardly, pure shock written on his face. Dean started to regret his decision to ever come here in the first place. He shouldn’t have listened to Sam or thought that this was a good option. His breath shortened and tears pricked his eyes. He closed them, waiting for the angel to push him back, to call him delusional, to shout at him, reject him. Dread crept under his skin as he waited for his angel, his best friend, and his love to walk away.
The man’s eyes widen at the redheads’ words before he laughs loudly, his voice echoing through the bathroom as someone shouts at them to tone it down, which just makes him laugh louder. “We should get out of here before someone we know finds us,” Dean tells her.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, his gravelly voice making Dean’s stomach flip in ways he didn’t want to think about.
“I thought that it is finally time that I get my head out of my ass and come and claim what’s in front of me,” Deans’ heart was about to burst out of his chest but he kept his eyes focused on the angels’ face, “If you let me, that is.”
Deans’ heart slightly broke on hearing the hesitancy in his voice. Turning to face him, he said, “I don’t have any problem with you joining us. Not now, not ever.”
Dean would sometimes tell him about his childhood, recalling all the times he caused trouble with his brother with fondness as he played with Castiel’s hair, the other times whispering about his fears about how his father would react when he came out.
But he can’t look away no matter how much he wants to. Because he can still feel the phantom touches across his chest from last night, the taste of cheap beer that he hates so much but Dean seems to love, persistent on the tip of his tongue, addictive.
“And you have been with us every step of this long, crazy thrill ride,” said Dean.  “And no matter how crazy it got, you never backed down.”
“What’s he done now?” asked Dean.  Little Cas had been doing very well lately.  He’d been back at Garth’s for the weekend, and, Dean knew, should be arriving at the bunker any minute.
“Have a seat,” Lucifer commanded, and Sam and Dean were both forced to sit on the pews of the abandoned church they had chosen for Lucifer’s trap.
“I think I found the angel trials, but I don't see anything about a nephilim or a cupid's bow or anything like that,” Kevin told Dean and Castiel over the phone.
They were quiet for a while, before Sam started again.  “And he told me about… Hell.  About everything he did… in Hell.”
“Sam’s working on it,” said Dean.  “Of course, he’s hell-bent on finding something that doesn’t mean killing her or her kid.”
Dean thought about it.  “Actually… yeah,” he said.  He waited on the feeling of regret to hit, but, oddly, he just felt
Dean had the sense that he had missed out on something horribly important (although he didn’t know what) by not doing
“Why do you let him talk to you like that?” asked Dean, still burning with anger on Castiel’s behalf.
Castiel grinned when the brothers shot each other looks that clearly said, “He has a point.”  “Cas is back in town!” he said, feeling better than he had in months.
Dean held onto either side of Castiel, though he wasn’t sure whether or not his intention was to keep Castiel from thrusting into his mouth or to make him do so.  In the end, Castiel squirmed and gave tiny thrusts into Dean’s mouth in his own odd compromise.  It wasn’t exactly a pleasant sensation, and certainly not one Dean was used to.  And yet, it quenched some abandoned thirst inside of him to take and be taken.  It didn’t take long, and Dean felt the telltale signs of Castiel’s release.  Dean sucked harder, and took what the angel gave him (which would’ve surprised him, if he’d given it absolutely any thought).
“Make it up!” snapped Crowley.  “You’re good at that.  Tell them you’re a new band, the Losechesters, and you’re
Despite Dean’s claim that he was going to “sleep for four days,” Dean was far from asleep when Castiel checked on him in his bedroom that night.  The door was left open a crack, which Castiel understood by now was a cue that Dean was okay with being disturbed.  He lay on his back on his bed, eyes closed tight, feet crossed, 80’s music blaring loudly from his headphones.
“I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem,” said Dean, and he grabbed Castiel’s arm and twisted.  Then he grabbed him by the lapels and began punching him.
Castiel grabbed Dean’s arm and pushed up his sleeve, searching for the source of the evil energy.  There on his arm was the Mark of Cain.
Even after Sam went to sleep that night, Dean stayed up feeling restless.  He remembered, with an odd squirming in his chest, the time they had spent together in Purgatory.  He remembered the feeling of Castiel’s hand in his as his friend grabbed him to run from leviathan.  He remembered the feeling of Castiel’s beard on his face during one of their few monster-free moments.
All of them had asked if he had talked to Castiel since he’d been to Heaven.  Finally, on the second day, Bobby asked, “Now, Dean, I don’t want to be in your business or anything, but did you and Cas have a bad end or something?  He won’t say much, but it seems awful strange to me that you haven’t talked to him.”
Dean was busy looking at invitation, and the words on the page suddenly made him feel as though his heart were pumping twice as fast.  “This invitation is for Sir Walter Cannon Jr. and his husband, James Carmichael III.”
Something about Cas appeared off, though.  It wasn’t something Dean could easily define.  He seemed… sad, at times, and distracted, at other times.  He knew Castiel had been helping people these past two months, performing acts of angelic kindness for those who deserved it.  He had thought that Cas seemed happy, but perhaps he had been wrong.  Perhaps he should’ve checked in with his friend more often and made sure he was okay.  He’d known that Cas was scared to go back to Heaven, and guilty about everything that had happened before Purgatory.  Still, the angel had been insistent upon his “penance”, and, after all, Castiel had left
“Cas... This isn't you,” Dean said desperately.  “This isn't you…”  And still his vessel attacked Dean.
going to sleep with her, are you?” Sam asked him from across the restaurant table as he and the waitress continued to smile and wave at each other.
Castiel’s first touch to his hole was noticeable only by the small shock of tingling pleasure that shot through his groin.  That was-…
locked with deadbolts, all of them.  My source inside says they’ve got an armed security system as well.  Hurry up, you two, we haven’t got all day.  Here, I’ll speed things along.”
He slowly approached the gateway to Heaven.  The other angels would be angry with him.  He would never again be allowed in Heaven.  But what was him being here really accomplishing?  They weren’t coming up with any good ideas…
Once they were inside Castiel’s office, Sam rounded on Dean.  “Will you stow the baggage, Dean?  Look, we've got a case.  Let's work it.”
“Dean,” he said huskily.  He lowered himself so that he was straddling Dean, but still somehow not touching him except thigh to thigh.  He took one hand and slowly trailed a light touch down Dean’s chest.
Dean extracted himself from behind Castiel and nudged him to roll over so that they could look at each other.  “I don’t know,” Dean said softly when Castiel was facing him.  “Whatever you want to happen, I guess.”
Castiel hoped that Dean and the other angels would give him good news when he and Sam returned to Missouri.  Apparently not, however; he received bad news as soon as he walked through the door.
There was a blinding white light, and Dean thought sure she must have been obliterated.  When the light began to dim, however, Amara was still standing there, seemingly untouched.  She lifted her hand and drew Lucifer effortlessly toward her.  He dropped the Horn of Joshua, and she cupped her hand on his face.  “I think you and I need to have a nice, long chat,” she said.  Lucifer writhed in her grip.
Dean found Castiel working at a Gas N’ Sip.  “I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols,” Dean said, walking up to the Gas N’ Sip counter.
Sam and Cas began a good-natured conversation about the Trans.  Dean ignored both of them, turned on the television, and flipped to his favorite soap opera.
“There’s an alley a block south of where 80 crosses 89,” said Castiel.  “Can you meet me there in 6 hours?”
It took nearly ten minutes to get through security.  Dean felt naked without any weapons and without even his proper ID, and he could tell that Castiel felt the same way.
Sam caught Castiel’s eye a few times during the first few days after the massacre of the loan sharks, silently acknowledging how close Dean and Castiel were sitting, or when they had just completed one of the long periods of wordless communication through staring that had always been so common between them.  Finally, on the fifth day after the massacre, Sam caught both of them coming out of Dean’s room.  Castiel looked at Dean to see how he would handle the situation, but Dean simply shrugged, grinned at his brother, and continued on down the hallway.
He made fun of Castiel when he attempted to obtain information about the deceased by sniffing him.  He ridiculed him for interrogating a witness and possible suspect.  Worst of all, he refused to allow Castiel to remain in the motel room and watch over him during their first night in Oklahoma.
“I could have told you that,” Castiel told him over the phone.  “I saw it in your brother’s memories.  I assumed you knew.”
“Cas,” Dean muttered against Castiel’s mouth.  “It’s been a month and a half.  Where the hell do you think I wanna go?”
“Are you a hunter?” the blond woman interjected.  He had absolutely no doubt that she meant him no harm, and also that she would not be a competitor for Dean’s affections.  She was so
It went on like that, for months.  Dean and Benny fought whatever monster came across their path, sometimes followed by a quick, manly hug.  Occasionally, they would come across a monster (usually a vampire or a werewolf) that didn’t seem interested in fighting.  Sometimes the other monsters they came across were wounded or clearly outmatched, but other times they simply looked at Dean and Benny and then abruptly ran away.  “You’ve got yourself a reputation,” said Benny.  “Most of us want to eat you for breakfast, but a few of us are smart enough to know that’s gonna get us killed.”
, Cas!  You knew what that would mean to me.  What the hell’s wrong with you, man?”  The sad part was that his anger wasn’t pure anger at betrayal… it was hurt, and resignation, as though he thought he somehow deserved this.  His speech wasn’t a defiant monologue about how he didn’t deserve this – more a dare to Castiel to admit that he did.
Dean opened his eyes when Castiel walked in the room as though he could somehow sense the angel’s presence.  The lines in his face seemed to melt away somewhat, and he gave a soft smile.  “Cas,” he said pleasantly, and motioned with his finger for Cas to sit next to him on the bed.  “Shut the door, man.”
With Crowley chained for the moment and Abaddon in the wind, Dean and Sam went in search of Castiel.  With the help of Ezekiel, they managed to save Castiel from a rogue reaper-for-hire named April that was working for the angels.  She had actually managed to kill Castiel, but the brothers arrived just in time and Ezekiel brought Castiel back to life before a reaper could claim him.
Dean looked as bad as Castiel felt.  Castiel had beaten him badly during his last fight against the beast spell.  As he watched Dean apply an ice pack to the bruises on his face, Castiel couldn’t hold back his guilt.  “Dean, I... There aren't words,” he said guiltily.
Castiel gave a dark look of suspicion, and Dean knew that the angel knew exactly what he was doing.  He acquiesced, though.  Once Castiel was on his stomach, Dean traced his fingertips across the angel’s hips and thighs and butt.  He made wide, sweeping curves, massaging Castiel’s butt as he grew closer and closer to the hole.  Dean grabbed some lubricant off of the night stand next to him, and then slowly fit one and then two fingers inside, allowing them to catch on the tight muscle on the way in.  Castiel thrusted once into the mattress, a desperate moan escaping him.
“You got everything you could ever want... or need or... dream,” Bobby said.  “So, I guess the question is... what are you gonna do now, Dean?”
Unfortunately, the angels refused to allow Metatron to leave his cell.  “We both know the only way Metatron helps you is if he's free,” said Hannah.  “And I can't let the scribe out of his cell.  Not again.  He's too dangerous.”
Mostly, he knew something was wrong from Dean’s eyes.  They should’ve been wild and elated after a month in a jail cell.  Instead they were burdened and desperate.
Dean sliced a clean cut on his arm, making sure to catch the blood in the bottle.  Benny looked at it lustfully, too tired and in pain to conceal his desire.
“Dean,” Castiel said crossly, and in response he grabbed Dean’s erection and gave a small tug in the right direction.
“Cas?” Dean asked, looking scared.  Had he done that?  Dean looked awful…  As he came near his friend to heal him, Dean backed away, alarmed.  “No.  Cas!  Cas!”
It explained a lot, Dean thought.  He hadn’t felt quite so motivated to touch Castiel openly since Purgatory, and he certainly hadn’t felt the freedom to do so until tonight.  Perhaps this drink was a blessing in disguise, a sort of social lubricant that might finally bring to light this “thing” that had been growing between them for so long.  He shot Castiel a shy smile.
Dean hooked up with a buxom blond girl on Valentine’s Day.  It hadn’t exactly been a planned hook-up, but he was there, and she was there, and Dean was horny, and it was “Unattached Drifter’s Christmas.”  By now, Sam knew better than to say anything more than teasingly calling him “classy.”  Dean had finally stopped stomping around the bunker and snapping at Sam for every minor transgression, and he assumed that Sam was refraining from asking him about Castiel in order to maintain the bunker’s current peaceful atmosphere.
They thought he was under some sort of spell!  But he had to leave.  He could barely protect Kelly on his own!  The recent deaths of Joshua and Kelvin flashed in front of him.  He could
Dean did.  He told Castiel everything, starting from his confrontation with Amara the previous month when she had still been in Crowley’s care, and ending with the kiss and their recent confrontation.
After that, there was a stroke of luck.  One of the older residents identified that one of the orderlies was wearing her bracelet, one of the things that had been stolen.  They tracked the stolen bracelet back to the owner of the nursing home, Doctor Mahoney.  He was the famed “Black Hole”, and he had been using Fred’s psychokinetic powers to rob the residents of the nursing home.
Castiel was truly touched.  He wasn’t sure if he believed everything they were saying, but he appreciated that they were saying it.  “Thank you,” he said.
It had been nearly a month since he’d last seen Cas, and he privately admitted to himself that he missed the angel.  He’d had no reason to call him back to the bunker, however, at least no valid one.  He didn’t consider “because you’re my friend” to be a “valid” reason.   Though they were friends – undeniably even
He heard the front door slam shut, keys jingling as they are dropped on the kitchen table, the sound of heavy footsteps approaching his room making him sigh. The door to his room opens just as he groans into his pillow, turning towards the wall so that the man can’t see his face, he mumbles, “Can’t we talk about this later?”
“I will be there,” he promises, his fingers leaving ghost touches across the back of Castiel’s hand before he walks off.
Wearing one of Deans’ grey band t-shirt that he had forgotten that he even owned and black jeans that looked suspiciously like Charlies, he looked like he had walked out of a Vogue magazine that Jack loved to buy. He ignored Charlie in favor of raking his eyes over the body that was regularly hidden by the stupid, two sizes big trench coat. As his gaze moved up, his eyes landed on the black collar around the angels’ neck, his mouth ran dry.
“He’s here.” he finally whispers, “I know I should have expected to see him and after almost three years I thought that I was ready to face him but then…”
“Don’t say things like that.” the tears in his eyes fall down his cheeks, “Don’t give me hope that you feel the same way. Don’t-” his voice cracks, “Don’t break me again.”
Or so he thought until a month ago, until one night when he stumbled back into his dorm after a way too long day to find Dean sprawling across his bed, glossy eyes staring at him with a feeling that made his heart stutter and lungs hurt. They hardly talked about what happened that night, or what’s happened ever since then, whispering only with the lights out, wrapped in each other, sometimes naked, sometimes not, never once labeling themselves.
, you take a girl to dinner and a movie a few times, you fuck a little bit, and eventually you have a conversation about, like,
“He does seem angry.  I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...more,” said Castiel.  “I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...”  It hurt that Dean might think that, after all this time.  “Sam, you don't, do you?”
Crowley snapped his fingers, and suddenly both Dean and Castiel were wearing black dress pants and dress shoes along with their flannel tops.  Their previous pants and shoes sat folded on their laps.
Sure enough, Dean was handcuffed to a chair in the warded room in which captives were held.  There was duct tape over his mouth, and his nose was bleeding.  “He put up a fight,” Hannah said in explanation.
Despite his newly acquired fear of leaving home, Castiel was still a celestial being used to roaming the world and fighting for a worthy cause.  Despite his refusal to accompany the brothers on cases, despite his human-like PTSD, he was
“I’m neither a girl, nor a human,” Castiel said.  And apparently his lack of ability to understand human courtships was yet another thing he failed at.
“Castiel, please proceed to the Room for Captives,” Hannah said.  “Dean Winchester killed Tessa, but we have managed to subdue him.”
Three minutes after that, Dean spotted one of the uniformed men open a door across the room.  He could see from beyond the doorway that the newly opened room was full of glass cases.  Another uniformed man joined the first man and blocked both the entrance and the view, however.  Dean nudged Cas, who was finishing a conversation with the larger man.
Twenty minutes later, Castiel and Sam were on the road to Colorado to track Josiah at his last known location.  Dean had stayed behind to talk to some of the friends and associates of the angel who had blown himself up in the ice cream shop.
“Lucifer tried to kill me,” Sam said, sitting next to Dean thoughtfully.  “Then Cas took control.  He said… he said we needed Lucifer, to get you back, because he can’t time travel.”
“Well, Heaven’s new, and all that.  Relatively, anyway.  And sometimes it gets a bit… glitchy.”  Bobby moved uncomfortably.
Castiel felt the warm fluttering that he recognized as love, and the firm strings of their bond.  It was by far the most meaningful gift Dean had ever made for him.  “Thank you, Dean!” he said.  “I’ll listen to it whenever I’m driving.”
Dean was confused.  “Wait.  What?  How?”  Did he mean before they had faced Lucifer?  Or something he had been doing in the week and a half since Castiel last spoke to them?  Something was
people – Chuck the prophet the whole time.  Dean had never had much faith in God or the Holy Trinity, and God (or “Chuck”, as he preferred to be called) did nothing to improve this.  He was less “fiery wrath”, and more “singing obnoxious songs in the shower.”  He was less “divine forgiveness” and more “sitting in the War Room in his underwear eating Chinese food.”
“Cas, forget I asked,” said Dean.  “Sex with you is great.  There’s no reason to bring another person into it.”
He knew immediately that Castiel wasn’t fooled.  “I’d like to stay, actually,” said Castiel.  “But I’ve got a lead on Cain.”
“Exactly!” said Dean roughly.  “But even more than that, is the guilt, and the secrets.  Me and Cas… we’ve been a thing since Purgatory.  Did you know that?”
Castiel pulled up to the valet and retrieved a ticket from the dashboard.  The valet took it without question, but did offer a sneer in the direction of Castiel’s aging truck.  Only after they had retrieved their bags and headed inside did Castiel answer the question.  “Crowley got tired of having to pick me up all the time from wherever I was staying, and then drop me back off at my truck,” Castiel admitted.  “He said it was
“I hitched a ride to Salt Lake City,” Castiel said seriously.  “I have nothing, and my grace is low.  Will you come pick me up?”
Over the following week, Castiel moved back into the bunker.  Between this and the fact that it was Valentine’s Day, Sam decided to leave for a week to manage case in Montana.  Castiel celebrated Valentine’s Day by fucking Dean over the banister next to the chess board.  Dean couldn’t remember ever being happier – Lucifer was back in Hell, Sam was (relatively) safe and happy doing “Sam things”, and he and Castiel were screwing each other on every available surface.  Dean even found the time to cook (he could tell that Cas was thoroughly unimpressed, though he put on a good show of acting like he loved it).
After the beast spell, Castiel had asked Dean, “What are we?”  Unwilling to give them a formal label yet, Dean had replied with these words.  But Dean realized now that he had been incredibly stupid.  Castiel hadn’t asked because he had been unsure of their love or his feelings – he had asked because he wanted to know how to act around Dean, what was going through
Dean looked at his friend and remembered, in that split second, why he had considered Castiel his friend for so long.  The look on Castiel’s face, so desperate to succeed, said it all.  He knew he had messed up, both before Purgatory and after, and was desperate to make it right.
Dean did the mental calculations in his head.  “I can be there at 3AM, I think,” he said.  “Maybe earlier.  Cas… tell me something only the real Castiel would know.”
Once Dean had parked the Impala at a $29-a-Night motel, he felt the pull behind his navel that he recognized as a demon’s form of teleportation.
He felt the anger… it felt like when he was a demon, and he had to kill.  His heart seemed to beat in his ears, and he saw red.
December rolled into January, and Dean and Sam found out that Sam’s imaginary friend from childhood had actually been a zanna, an imaginary creature that helps children.
On the other hand, he wasn’t so far gone as Castiel, and he had several large worries about the consequences of jumping into such a thing.  The first priority was the mission of course.  But after the mission, then what?
Dean didn’t trust her at all.  He surmised that Castiel was still on the run with the angel tablet, and Naomi was attempting some sort of long-winded effort to get Castiel back on her side.  She needn’t have bothered, Dean thought.  He didn’t trust her, and he had more important things to worry about at the moment than his rogue angel friend.
Personally, I think that if Dean and Cas had some sort of relationship behind the scenes, it would almost certainly not have started before Purgatory.  Even if Dean was fully bisexual and willing, Castiel spent Season 4 and 5 being too “holier-than-thou”, Season 6 being too “God-minded”, and Season 7 being too “crazy Cas.”  Then they had an entire year in Purgatory with just each other and Benny and without the expectations of any sort of normal society so… yeah.  That kind of wrote itself.  So I started there.
Sometime during the time he had been speaking with John, a “Heaven chat waiting” light had appeared at the bottom of the screen, and it hadn’t stopped flashing red since that time.  Once Dean had collected himself, he checked the “Heaven chat waiting” list and was astonished to find almost twenty people waiting to talk to him!  Apparently, his mother and Bobby had spread the word.
Castiel shrank backward from Dean, because it was the only way to avoid taking his arm.  With Dean’s words, however, Castiel remembered:
, though he was still painfully hard and his hand still securely in Dean’s.  It wasn’t meant to last, however – as soon as they had moved on from the rod and the staff, Castiel felt his mind drift back to Dean.  He wanted to find a secluded corner and rake his hands through Dean’s hair…
“Okay,” Dean relented, taking the tablet from his bag.  “In that case, if you’re really going to close Heaven, you’ll need access to the angel tablet and the prophet.  He’s at the bunker now.”
These feelings were confirmed when they found a microphone wired under the map table.  The Men of Letters must’ve been listening to their private conversations for
“Doesn’t matter,” said Castiel adjusting himself yet again.  He was relieved that his vessel happened to be wearing underwear that at the very least seemed to allow for some ability to hide his body’s reaction to Dean’s nearness.  He knew this wasn’t something either of them wanted to deal with tonight, especially Dean.  If Dean
After Purgatory, Dean had immediately slipped back into the relationship with Castiel that he had had before Purgatory.  This included rules about touching, and enforcing personal space.  Castiel had shot him a hurt look on the first two or three occasions after Purgatory that he had berated the angel for his lack of personal space, but had said nothing.
wondering whether or not he should invite Castiel over for Christmas, only to find out that Sam already had.  Christmas was never exactly a big affair, but this year they had shelter and food and weren’t surrounded by monsters, and that in itself was something to celebrate.  Castiel and Dean spent an hour
about it, so for tonight I’m going to nail that waitress, and I’m going to put in more than just the tip!”
“Now that,” said Ishim, “Is refreshingly accurate.  But since you brought a couple of extra ‘people’ to our little chitchat, we should go somewhere more private.  I have a safe house nearby.”  He stood up to leave, not even looking at Sam or Dean as he made his exit.
“I do,” said Dean.  “Welcome home, pal.”  He gave Castiel a large, heartfelt kiss, right in front of Sam.  His lips were chapped and he jerked with surprise, then relaxed into Dean’s embrace.
This was different than curing a “normal” demon, because Dean didn’t acquire his demonic nature the normal way.  Rather, the Mark wouldn’t let him die.  When Metatron had killed him, the Mark had resurrected him, with the power of a Knight of Hell.
“Shut up jerk,” said Sam, grinning as he tucked the phone back into his jacket.  “And yes.  Sorry about that.”
“No,” said Dean, still holding the gun on Crowley.  “I’m not making anymore deals.  Not after the Mark of Cain.”
Suddenly the door disappeared, and Dean was left backed into a corner, the wall of the hallway suddenly hard and unyielding.
“I know,” said Little Cas, finally putting on his ugly green trench coat.  “Dad told me.  Sam told me, too.”
“We want you,” replied Kelvin.  “Look, you’ve got more field experience than the next thousand angels combined.”
Dean smiled slightly, though Castiel could already tell that something was deeply wrong.  “Cas,” Dean said.  “Now, look at you, all suited up and back in the game.”
Dean could do the math:  this wasn’t ending well.  He pulled out an angel blade and rushed Ishim, but he felt himself flying backward against the wall.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Castiel and Ishim fighting.
“That’s what he said,” replied Garth.  “But now it’s brown, almost black, and it makes him look even more like his namesake.”
Castiel mouthed at Dean’s neck, inhaling Dean’s smell of apple pie and polish and tasting something distinctly aftershave and
With a sinking heart, Castiel realized that yet again he had no time to speak quiet words with his friend.  Dean, especially, would need to stay far away from him.  If Naomi found Dean, she would be able to use his friend against him.
But Billie was suddenly not so merciful.  “Since I got this…new job, I stand witness to a much larger picture,” she told him.  “Do you know what I see?  You.  And your brother.  You’re important.”
Dean swung, backed into a corner by the Devil, with such little warning that it was a surprise even to him.  His fist collided with Lucifer’s –
Dean was stunned.  “Hold on, hold on!  You seriously think that?  Because none of it -- none of it -- is true.  Listen, man, I know we've had our disagreements, okay?  Hell, I know I've said some junk that set you back on your heels.  But, Sammy...come on…  I’m willing to let this bastard and all the sons of bitches that killed mom walk because of you.  Don't you dare think that there is anything, past or present, that I would put in front of you!  It has never been like that, ever!  I need you to see that.  I'm begging you.”
It was the angels, falling to Earth, and Dean knew that Castiel had failed, too, and he was alone again.
“Yeah, but you had Rowena,” insisted Castiel.  He knew the brothers had been forced to trade her freedom for his own.  “Because of me, you-...”
Castiel moved backward and upward, but Dean barely had a moment to feel the loss before Castiel impaled himself on Dean’s cock, gasping into his mouth.
“Cas?” the hunter groans, eyes squinting as they find the ex-angels blue ones, a lazy smile stretching on his face.
for tonight and by god, she had lived up to her word. The white band t-shirt looked perfect with his black ripped jeans his best friend had blackmailed him into wearing, and the black leather jacket he had donned was definitely completing the whole look.
Dean turns away from the two questioning eyes, his gaze settling upon his bedside table, the silver chain with the angel wings pendant laying on top of the brown wood. He tries to come up with a reasonable answer, his heart ripping itself apart when he pushes down the unnamed feelings until he is numb, “I don’t know.”
Dean smiled at her, walking towards the war room. He felt the angel step to him, their hands brushing, and he inhaled sharply only to curse when he smelled the musky scent of his cologne on the angel. It was getting harder to resist the temptation of devouring the angle right there in the middle of the hallway, and
Instead, he felt a soft touch on his face, calloused hands cupping his jaw, coaxing him to open his eyes. Blue eyes looked into his soul, overwhelmed with surprise, happiness, and love. Dean felt Everything else fade away until it was just the two of them standing there alone in the middle of the floor. He inhaled sharply as the angel stroked his cheek, fingers rubbing the light stubble present.
She coaxed the angel into joining them, probably by bribing him by telling him she would help him finish his garden, and now almost an hour later, they were locked in Deans’ room with no other sign than Castiels’ occasional struggling noises.
Dean groans, hand pulling away Castiel's’ from his lips so he can speak, “I am not beautiful, Cas. I’m hot and-”
“No, I didn’t!” the green-eyed man chuckles, “Anyway, did you finally learn how to cook or breakfast is on me?”
The man crumbled to the floor, resting his head against the gravel as he wraps his arms around his body, trying to stop himself from falling apart, three words escaping from his lips, repeating itself like a prayer.
“Okay,” he prompts the man to continue, shuffling towards him slightly when the air starts to get a bit cold.
“You won’t dare,” he responds as he rolls away, settling next to her as they both stare at the ceiling.
She whispers something into his ear, making him laugh as he shakes his head and Castiel can feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. He finally comprehends the shouting. A single word repeated as more people joined in.
“You do know that he’s going to kill both of us and then Eileen when he finds out that I am still trying to-”
“Yeah,” he rubs his hands before putting them into his jacket, “Let’s go there. We can at least enjoy the fireworks even if we don’t find him.”
“Let’s get you back to your dorm,” she says softly, winding an arm around his waist. He doesn’t hesitate to lean back, gaze strictly planted on the pavement coated with snow in front of him as he blocks out everything he is feeling, blinking away the tears, greeting the numbness that settles.
“Or we can continue and I can make sure to remind you how much I love you since I don't have a birthday gift right now.” Castiel mumbles, hooded eyes staring into Dean's soul.
“Nor do I,” Dean replies, I just… I’m sorry I have no idea what came over me that called you in the middle of the night and I guess you want to go back to sleep and well… I think I should hang up so that-”
What they had was much more fragile than a house of cards, and Castiel would do anything to make sure that they made it. He thought Dean would too, no matter how scared he was.
The name finds its way to his lips, a million emotions following it as he stares back at the man, more than a hundred bodies separating them but closer than they had been in the last three years.
“Yes you are,” the young hunter sounded slightly irritated, “You have been in a state ever since Cas agreed to join us and-”
“Honestly, it is.” she answers with a smile, “But, if it makes you feel better, I realized it because I do know what my brother looks like.”
“Alright,” she sighs, stepping towards the man sitting on the counter, “Close your eyes,” she instructs.
“Hey, It’s not your fault.” the older Winchester turns to look at his brother, a reassuring smile on his face, “Don’t worry about me.”
The redhead gives him a sideways glance, making him sigh. “Everyone loves you and you liking dicks is not going to change that,”
,” Dean breaths out, tightening his grip on the lean man’s body, the tan trench coat bunching under his hands.
“Thanks,” Dean rubs his face, almost running his fingers through his hair before the woman slaps his hand away. Loosening his tie slightly, he opens the door, stepping out, the redhead following him.
Castiel rolls his eyes, leaning down to press his lips against the humans briefly before pulling back, “Happy birthday, darling.”
“We need to stop if we want to leave this room today,” the hunter breaths, leaning back when the ex-angel follows him.
“Anything,” Dean internally groaned as soon as he caught the grin creeping on his best friend’s face, “You want a beer or coke?”
“Dean,” the angel whispered next to his ear, making goosebumps appear down his neck, “Are you sure that this is fine?”
Dean furrows his eyebrows for a moment before his eyes widening as a shy smile tugs his lips, “You remembered?”
“Alright then!” She grabs Gabriel’s forearm, dragging him away from the duo with a hardly concealed wink towards Dean.
“Where are you taking me?” Dean questions, shooting his best smile towards the group of girls he just bumped into.
“Please don’t hang up!” the man’s voice comes through the speaker cutting him off, “I don’t care that it’s the middle of the night and whatever. I just want to talk to you.”
Castiel sits on the edge of the cliff, cold wind rushing into his hair, legs dangling off the drop as he places his phone against his ear, empty beer bottles surrounding him as he looks over the city. He has no idea why he is still trying to reach the man when all his calls have gone straight to voicemail for the past month.
“You all shouldn’t have left because of me,” Castiel finally speaks, his voice sounding strange to his own ears.
Castiel looks at him with a blinding smile, making Dean’s lips tug up in response. Castiel picks up an end of the blanket when he sees him shiver, silently gesturing towards him to come closer so they both can share it. Dean hesitates a second before crawling under the warm quilt, rolling his eyes at the wolf whistles from his friends and doing his best to ignore the way his heart races as he sits next to the guy who has been visiting him in his sleep a lot more nights than Dean would admit, sinking into the warm body next to him, sighing softly when he feels Castiel’s arm wrap around his waist, pulling him closer.
“Yes,” he helps the man sit up, both their bodies leaning against the headboard before Castiel picks up the tray from the table, carefully placing it on the hunter's lap, he looks away awkwardly, “I thought that you would like to start today with breakfast in bed.”
“Good,” the hunter tilts his head up slightly to peck his lips, “Now, I know that this is going to sound very cliché but I always hand this one thing on my bucket list and you can help me tick it off.”
“Okay, I admit I would have tried to convince you to stay but if you really want to move then that is fine with me,” Sam sighs, “I just don’t understand why you-” he pauses as the realization hits him, “It’s because of Ca- It’s because of
“I am not always right,” the angel glances towards the sky, moments passing before he softly says, “I’m sorry.”
“Whatever,” Dean mumbles before he streets the help the angel packs up their lunch, a comfortable silence enveloping them as they work.
“My family is not very interesting,” Castiel starts, Dean listening with rapt attention as the rest of the world fades away.
The man’s eyes leave the woman as he leans over the crowd of people, blue eyes moving around the room until they land on him.
