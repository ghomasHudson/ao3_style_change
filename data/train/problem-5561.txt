“I’m fine.” Tony insisted, “I just haven’t been sleeping great is all, it’s nothing, it doesn’t matter.”
“I’m not sure.” Tony admitted. His head was throbbing and he was feeling dizzy, not to mention his arm, which was agony.
Patting Peter’s shoulder, Happy sat down besides him at the table and the two waited for Bruce to serve the tea and take a seat himself. Peter reached out and snagged a cookie, breaking it in half but not eating it, “He’s not dead, is he?” He blurted out. Having already lost two sets of parents he was far more a aware of the possibility that parents could die than others were.
Clint was tapping his foot on the floor restlessly while Natasha examined her nails with a bored expression on her face as they waited for Fury to arrive.
They remained on the floor in each others arms until the door was knocked, “Uh guys, I hate to disturb the… whatever is going on in there….”
He was outside on the lawn and turned with a frown. “Well it’s about t…” He didn’t finish the rest of the sentence as a repulser blast was fired at him and he only just had a second to dodge it, or he would have gotten the lot to his face!
The Doctor never finished his sentence except with a scream as Tony fired his repulsor hitting the Doctor’s shoulder; as he fire at such close range the blast was powerful enough to nearly take the Doctor’s arm clear off.
On the sand Natasha rolled her eyes as she stretched out to enjoy the sun, “Children.” She said closing her eyes. Sat in the shade Bruce chuckled, making himself comfortable and opened his book.
“Now Rhodey!” Tony yelled, from the air as he blasted at Glaive’s back while Steve beat at his front with the shield,
“Yeah, I’ll need to pick up some After-heat pills too.” Tony said, at Steve’s frown he shrugged, “There is no such thing as too much protection. Besides, you’re, serum enhanced, for all I know your spunk could be super charged and slice through a condom and lay siege to my ovaries!”
“Deadpool saw you and Barnes on the news and decided that you needed help, and so he took Peter hostage at gun point and forced Clint to fly them all here.”
“Sure there is, and I actually enjoy ball gags, especially where there are leather collars and leashes involved!”
“But he can’t be, he’s… there have been no symptoms, he’s not big enough!” Steve protested having gone as white as a sheet.
“Brat, you’re grounded.” Tony grinned as Peter blew a raspberry at his retreating back. Obviously his Son was feeling better, having gotten the worst of his distress out, there would probably be more to come, but they’d made a start on this and Peter knew that he could talk to Tony about it without fear of getting in trouble.
His skin prickled and all the hair suddenly stood up on his flesh making Peter turn with a start to find Bruce fiddling with some equipment behind him. Huh, his senses were really heightened.
For a moment Maya’s eyes met with Tony’s. She silently apologised, silently begged for forgiveness as she bled out, her body falling to the ground as Killian holstered his gun. “So, you’ve got a choice, Tony.” He said pleasantly, as if he hadn’t just committed cold blooded murder, “You can either watch your precious brat die in agony, and then face a similar death yourself. Or, you can choose to use your much talked about brain and solve the final problems with extremis.”
He then saw to his own packing, adding several vest tops he could wear on the beach with his trunks. While he was comfortable with Steve seeing the Arc reactor he wasn’t so comfortable with the rest of the team seeing it. Besides, it wasn’t good to expose such deep scars to the sunlight even with sunscreen.
“I’m not a blushing virgin, Cap, we can share a bed without it being an issue, we don’t even need to put a pillow between us.” He said giving Steve a grin.
Maybe he could get up, slip away into the bathroom and take care of his little problem before Tony woke up.
“Good enough for me.” He said, leaning forward and kissed Zach’s head, “Now, you go and wake your Brother up while I get a start on the pancakes.”
“A compound for the Avengers, a school, a full garage for all our vehicles, labs and workshops, and a full training facility.”
“If Fury doesn’t get here soon I might just have to alleviate my boredom by murdering you in the most imaginative way possible.” She sighed.
“Such a vicious woman.” Tony mused, shifting Zach’s weight, “Now, introductions before we eat. Zach, Peter, these are, Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow, Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye, Bruce Banner AKA Hulk, Thor of Asgard, and Steve Rogers AKA Captain America. Guys, these are my Sons, Peter and Zach.”
“Tony, you need to control your breathing.” Steve said urgently, “I’m sorry, we’ll get him back I promise, please baby, try to calm down.”
“Time to rock and roll!” Deapool exclaimed, charging out of the rubble, swinging his katana blades he decapitated a couple of chitauri as he made his way back to Cull, sliding under him and slashing his legs, a move that would have severed the limbs of a human but only scratched Cull, from the leviathan Peter flipped onto Cull’s shoulders and covered his head in webbing, blinding him and giving Bucky the chance to fire on him. He ran at Cull firing the staff weapon as he went and rammed it through the creature’s chest.
“He’s the strangest Mince Pie I’ve ever seen.” Steve laughed softly, “And the best Christmas present I’ve ever received.”
As soon as he arrived back at the tower Tony was bombarded by his children. Zach leaped at him, wrapping his arms about Tony’s thighs and looked up at him with huge eyes until Tony picked him up into his arms and balanced him on his hip, ignoring the ache in his ribs and his broken arm, he envied Steve his accelerated healing, the Captain was in perfect health now, without even a bruise or a faint scar to tell the tale of what he’d been through, where Tony was bruised, cut up, and suffering the aches of his healing bones.
Snickering Steve ran his forefinger down Tony's forehead and over his nose, "I think that this will take a very long expedition, leaving no land uncharted and no inch unexplored."
As the funeral was in New York Tony had opened up Stark Mansion in Long Island for the reception so he and Peter didn’t have to stay in hotel or hire a place out. It was strange being back in his childhood home, the old place hadn’t seen residents since Jarvis and Ana had died, being back there brought back memories for him, both good and bad. The good being the time he spent with Jarvis and Ana in the kitchen, where he’d “Helped” them cook, making more mess than anything, although Ana always let him lick the bowls of cake batter or icing out when she was done with them. Unfortunately the good memories were drowned out by the bad ones, Howard being belligerent, being drunk, being violent. Maria passed out from Valium and vodka, too many hours spent alone in his room trying frantically to impress his parents and get them to love him.
Rhodey fielded questions and concerns from the military in regards to the War Machine armour, who would maintain it if Tony was out of commission, if their protective gear, communications gear, and other hard wear would be late or simply not arrive since the genius would not be able to see to his deadlines.
Peter had gotten Zach a sticker book that detailed the complete chronology of Dr Who and promised to help him go through it.
Thor was already gone. He had fallen when Asgard had fallen, shortly before Thanos had come to earth.
The Cop blushed and grinned, “Sure honey, I’d be happy to.” He offered Natasha his arm which she happily accepted and began to totter along beside him talking a mile a minute about how she loved uniforms on me and how much it suited him.
Peter had homework to do and so retreated to his room to get on it, Zach engrossed himself in Doctor Who while playing with the cats, leaving Tony to curl up on the sofa with Steve and look over wedding menu options and Cake ideas.
As he finally got free Tony became aware of just how much sand he now had in places he really did not want sand to be and made a hasty retreat to the shower to get washed up. (Stopping in the villa kitchen for a coffee first of course.)
“We should all rest too.” Natasha said, “There is nothing we can do until Friday has information for us, Tony is in the Doctors hands, the best thing we can do is try to rest and then regroup when we’ve had a few hours to recharge.”
As Hydra soldiers poured out of the castle and down the snow covered hills they were met by the Avengers, Clint’s arrows fired with blinding speed, hitting the engines of cars and exploding, making the cars blow with them, getting into the spokes of the bikes and jamming the wheels which sent the drivers flying over the handbars to land in the cold snow and get picked off by Natasha, who was tackling the soldiers that were on foot. This changed when Clint picked off the oppupants of a decent looking jeep, “Wanna ride?” he asked her.
“Quiet boy!” Norman barked at him. He smiled at the Principal, “Boy’s fight.” He said shrugging his shoulders, “The odd scrap in a playground is nothing unusual, why I had scrapped knuckles and a split lip many a time.” He looked to Harry, “We that all my Son had suffered I would written it off as hot-headed youths letting their tempers get the better of them. But it is not just a few bruises, Harry’s nose was broken in two places, he has a cracked cheekbone, and several of his teeth were knocked loose. It will take surgery to repair the damage to his face, meaning my poor boy will have to endure more pain.”
Tony was worryingly quiet the whole way, not even complaining about being carried by Steve, just staring with too large eyes that darted around as if he were afraid of unseen, unheard enemies being close by.
“Do we have a name for this little Prince?” Tony was asked sometime later, after being delivered of the afterbirth and cleaned up some. Time had become meaningless as he’d held his baby Son, nothing else mattered but him.
Despite his lab binges, Tony was in no way prepared for the fact Zach needed feeding every three to four hours and this taking forty minutes, then he’d need burping and shortly there after changing, and often washing because when he shit it went everywhere. So a good two hours could go by before he was back in his crib and sleeping. Tony then fell into bed to try and nap, only to be awoken far too soon for another round of feeding, burping, washing, changing, and resettling.
“We have to stop them.” Ned hissed to MJ, not looking thrilled at the prospect of trying to break the fight up.
The first failed as Tony and Clint glutted themselves on the marzipan and then spent the better part of three hours being sick.
Peter was going to tell them about his becoming enhanced. He’d discussed this in length with his parents and with the team and they had agreed it was something he should do. He needed the support of his friends, while he had support from his family, he needed people his own age who could understand him in ways those older could not, and people he could just kick back and be a kid with.
Zach recovered from his chicken pox after ten days of being miserable. After his initial tantrum he settled down and put up with having oat baths, even though he didn’t like it and vehemently refused to have anything to do with porridge, was swearing off oats for life it seemed.
His assurances brought smiles from all of the team except for Steve, because the Alpha knew, that even when they did find them and made them pay, they couldn’t make things right for Tony, nothing could undo what had been done to him.
“On my mark.” He said to Dumm-E readying his custom made nerf gun, “Three, two, one, Fire!” He let out a battle cry and fired at the other two bots, while DUMM-E fired his extinguisher at them, avocado, two carrots, and a banana were thrown back at them and Butterfingers spun the mop around splattering foam in all directions.
“But I didn’t spot it, because I was too busy blotting everything out with booze just like fucking Howard.” Tony inhaled sharply after he’d said that, Steve freezing up, there was more to that statement, a story there and not a happy one either.
“Sure Cap, we’ll get it sorted now.” Tony said, taking his phone out of his pocket and began to tap at the screen.
“You.” Steve whispered, “Don’t you remember?” Like one would approach a wild animal he carefully grew closer so as not to alarm the man, “Bucky it’s me, it’s Steve, I’m your friend.”
If Flash had been saying this when Peter had first been adopted then it would have made him insecure, but he'd been in Tony's care for several years now, was treated no differently to Zach (Except when age related) and he knew that he was loved by his family.
When they’d arrived back at the compound a year ago things had been tense and difficult and while they didn’t want to the rest of the team had to leave after just a few hours or risk being arrested.
“Not yet, He’s rebooting, that genius rugrat Harley’s watching over him, so I’ll give him a call. Snarky little sod, I like him.” Tony mused, “Do you think his Mother would mind if I kidnapped him when this is over?”
“If their parents agree sure.” Tony said, “They are both very smart so they would totally cut it for the academically gifted.”
Tony’s snort was weak almost despairing. “How will we be?” He asked, “We have us, and a planet of armies more interested in wiping each other out than defending the human race. We got lucky with the Nuke exploding outside of our atmosphere, if it had blown on earth we’d be looking at radiation poisoning and Nukes are the biggest arsenal we have for defence, a defence that is also a suicide, so if the Chitauri come again the chances are we lose, the entire planet looses with us.”
“Oh please don’t encourage this, it makes me feel dirty.” Bruce protested, groaning as Tony grinned at him,
“Fury…” Clint growled looking ready to argue but Natasha placed a restraining hand on his arm and shook her head. Steve stepped forward then, lifting his chin in defiance, his tone brooking no argument.
Even now after weeks in hospital following a life changing injury, Tony looked better to Steve than he had throughout the whole of the nineties, his eyes were clear and bright, he was pale but there was enough colour in his cheeks to be healthy, it was just a lack of daylight that had robbed him of his usual tan, his face didn’t look hollow or drawn, or at least not as badly as he had looked in 95 when a photo had been taken of him stumbling out of a club at three am completely wasted and looking like he hadn’t slept in a month or eaten a decent meal in that time either. With his ribs visible and his pelvis jutting out Tony had looked like a famine victim rather than one of the richest men in America, but what really got Steve’s gall was the photo of Stane at Tony’s side looking so smug he wanted to punch the bastard until his skull shattered beneath his fist.
Tony smiled and greeted both Zach and Peter with hugs and kisses, but his smile didn’t reach his eyes, his face looked wooden, his expression forced and hollow, the emotion behind it didn’t match. His voice was too high pitch, too strained, his laughter sounded more like sobbing, his grins more like grimaces.
“Hey guys, at long last is lasting a little long.” Natasha complained, turning and shooting a Hydra soldier.
Steve chuckled watching Harley struggling to keep up with the bombardment of friend requests on social media and stunned looks every time one of the kids called out his name or shouted out to meet them at lunch.
“Sorry about this.” Steve said, although he didn’t sound overly sorry but that might had something to do with the fact that he was cradling Tony’s thighs which were very pleasant to hold onto. He didn’t have long to appreciate it though as more bullets were fired and suddenly there was a car screeching to a halt in front of them forcing Natasha and Steve to stop running or run right into the car.
The enormous corpse of Hulk would follow her, the colossal beast finally struck down, impaled through the chest, a huge shaft of metal having torn a seven inch hole in his torso, obliterating his heart.
“I believe several cultures begin teaching their children forms of martial arts from about the age of three. There is no reason that Zach couldn’t learn a form of martial arts; and if Steve isn’t comfortable teaching him, then I am sure you can find a school for children his age.”
The sudden rush of flavours from the lamb Rogan Josh brought tears to his eyes and he had take several sips of soda to cool his tongue before continuing to eat, however, once he got past the heat of the spice the found the dish to be delicious and complimented by the rice, the vegetable side dishes, and the nann bread.
“Oh. I never knew my Daddy.” Zach said, “Him died in plane crash before I was borned and Mamma doesn’t talk ‘bout him.”
“I don’t know.” Tony said, he sounded exhausted, he was exhausted, the emotional trauma and the fight had taken all the energy from him, he was staying on his feet through sheer force of will.
Despite Steve's politeness the receptionist remained disinterested, however the middle aged woman showed that at she had a heart. "Please, I can wait, they need to be with their Son."
“Tony! How do you feel about all this?” Christine cried to the rather bewildered Billionaire. He hadn’t expected Steve to reveal so much, certainly not about his sexual orientation and he was rather taken aback by the way that Steve had subtly called his counter part a homophobe in front of the worlds media, which would undoubtedly cause a backlash for the Avengers to deal with.
Tony swiped at his face which was damp with tears; he so wanted to be with Peter right now, he wanted to be with Zach right now, he wanted for them all to be together and for this shit to not be happening.
The voice came from behind them and both men yelped, turning to see the smug looking Black Widow who’d crept up on them without either of them noticing.
“FUCK!” Tony groaned planting his face into the couch with a dramatic groan, “Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck!”
That had finally broken down the last of Tony’s walls. He’d broken down into tears, ended up sobbing in Steve’s arms, all his fears spilling out as he clung to him, crying himself out on Steve’s chest as he rubbed Tony’s back and comforted him, promising him that it would never happen, that everyone had darkness in them, but it was a choice to give in to it, to become evil, not something that happened by inevitability.
Steve snickered, Tony had been trying to get him to do that since he’d first gotten into the chair, which of course, being him, had to have hot rod red wheels and gold plating, he was relieved that Tony was in much brighter spirits and had been getting much more like his old self with every achievement since he’d gotten out of the bed.
Clint had been sleeping at the time and had awoken to something prodding his leg and saying “Exterminate!” as it flashed a blue glowing light at him.
“Thank God for that, though I’ll be happier when Osborn’s ass is in custody, preferably well kicked.”
The realization struck Steve at the same moment and then they were moving, Tony to repair his suit, Steve to find Natasha.
Ivan Vanko wasn’t dead, he was working with Justin no brains Hammer and attacked the Expo. Leaving Zach with Happy, Tony managed to destroy the drones with Rhodey’s help, and Natasha attacked Hammer Industries breaking Vanko’s hold on the War Machine armour since the US Airforce had the idiot idea of letting Hammer near the armour.
Steve opened his mouth to protest but once again Deadpool cut him off before he could say anything, “You can’t hate him!” He cried, with an exaggerated gasp, “He’s Captain Amazing pecs! He’s Cock King of America! He has an ass that everyone, but you and me, is jealous of, but only because we both have amazing asses ourselves, and have I mentioned how much I want to bite those ripe peach-like cheeks?”
He initiated his own download from the servers into an armour that Tony had designed specifically for him. An armour named Vision.
“Maybe you can become a professional skater.” Peter said wiping his mouth which had a chocolate moustache.
“It’s okay.” Steve said, with a smile to Robbie, “It’s always nice to meet a fellow Iron Man fan. You think he’s the best Avenger?”
“Let me look into this first.” Pepper said not wanting anyone to get their hopes up only to have them dashed.
“Incomplete, and the doctor who developed it couldn’t complete it herself, she needed Tony. Killian and she kidnapped Zach, putting Peter in the hospital, and attacked Tony. He injected Zach with the serum which severely endangered his life to put pressure on Tony to complete the serum.”
Again Tony laughed but inside his mind he immediately began to think about a repulsor powered wheelchair, maybe he could design a combat one too, or perhaps he could fit a cradle into an armour to support his body from the waist down, perhaps even make the limbs work while he was in it.
This brought a genuine grin to Tony’s face, “That is very true.” He slipped back into Steve’s embrace, his chin resting on Steve’s shoulder.
Steve snorted and without even thinking about it pulled the Omega into a hug, burying his face into soft dark hair, “Thank you, so much for this.” He said holding Tony close.
Norman Osborn was not a man who enjoyed being woken up in the middle of the night, and even less when it was by police barging into his house and issuing a warrant for his arrest.
Tony cursed at being treated like a damsel but didn’t have time to focus on that as Wanda seized her chance and lashed out at him with her magic. Tony dodged as best he could, running for the far wall to take shelter. He jumped up and gripped the wall with his fingers, silently swearing about not being taller as he scrambled to get up only for Maximoff’s magic to wrap around his waist and bring him flying back onto the ground.
Tony was being pulled into discussions by various business owners and politicians wanting his input on this and that.
“Yeah but we have practice now.” Tony said, “And we can always enlist the others to help us, so we don’t get completely over-run.”
“Nonsense, I am the man with a plan and my strategy never fails.” Steve replied, “We must both try to fight this enchantment with Iron Wills.”
“Okay now, can you stand?” Sam asked him. Mutely Steve nodded, letting Sam help him to his feet, he was proud of himself that he didn’t wobble when he was upon them, but felt terrible when he saw Zach sobbing in Tony’s arms.
As Steve stepped down the school erupted into cheers as everyone began clapping. The bullies and the mean kids were glancing around nervously suddenly aware of how precarious their position was and were not making eye contact with anyone.
“Most pleasing.” Thor agreed eagerly shoving more marshmallows on his stick and thrusting them into the flames, a little too enthusiastically since they caught fire!
After he’d been seen by a Doctor and had Morgan fully checked over, Tony contacted his lawyers and set them to work on getting deals for the avengers. Rhodey and Pepper handled the explanation to the world about the Skrull and how Tony had been in the hands of Hydra for the last eight months and Hydra’s attempts at stealing his and Steve’s baby. With Tony’s insistence they emphasised the Avenger’s involvement in rescuing Tony from the base to give them some positive press.
This Tony was petit, about Five ft Nine inches by Steve’s reckoning, his arms and shoulders were firm with muscle, but he was skinnier than Steve’s Tony had been, too skinny, by the way his jeans and vest were hanging off his shoulders and hips, he’d lost weight recently, leaving him bordering on being gaunt.
“Okay enough, I need to concentrate.” Peter said cutting into Ned’s rant before it got any worse. He stretched out his legs and shook his arms to loosen up then set off at the sprint through the park.
“Oh that is like a freaking possession movie.” Clint groaned, “Any minute now he’s going to be spewing green slime and saying his mother sucks gumphosh!” The last of the sentence was cut off as Natasha’s elbow implanted in his stomach.
“Run!” He shouted to Natasha and Tony as panic broke out with tourists running in all directions and more agents on the way along with museum security.
“..Ad!” Lily greeted making grabby hands for Tony, “..Ad, Ad,” Tony froze, his brown eyes going wide in shock as he realized what she was trying to say was Dad. He looked up from the baby to Steve who’s face mirrored his own expression. Not understanding why the grown-ups weren’t doing what she wanted, Lily whined and squirmed in Steve’s hold, reaching out again for Tony.
“Not much, maybe, but if he were to ally with another team…” Rhodey trailed off as Sam clearly got the idea,
“In normal households people just ask for things, in this one, where Tony Stark is in residence, a full court has to be held, with A seven-year-old as a witness, a cranky Russian Spy as a prosecutor, a defrosted super soldier as a defender, and a deranged Billionaire as judge.” Clint said into the camera.
The rest of her was no easier to look at. Her figure was naturally in decline, her body no longer able to maintain a decent muscle mass, and her determination not to gain weight had resulted in a far too restrictive diet that made her bones far too prominent beneath too thin, over stretched skin, that had been nipped and tucked over and over to the point that there was no give left in her abused flesh which looked to be in danger of splitting it was so tight. Her breasts were practically comical, sitting as high and firm as a twenty-year-olds and were as round as a couple of grapefruits. They were also on display in the far too low cut dress and the woman kept thrusting them at Steve despite his lack of attention or desire.
“While we cannot be certain, it does appear that A.I.M was originally a part of Hydra, their R+D department as it were, but at some point their broke away from Hydra and set up on their own.”
“Looks like we’re all set then.” Tony said, “Jarvis, have we battened down the hatches and plugged up the port holes?”
Steve chuckled and pulled Tony in for a hug, “I think it’s just one of the joys of being a parent.” He said, “Just wait until he gets his first girlfriend, or boyfriend and wants to stay out all night at a party!” Tony groaned and buried his face in Steve’s chest.
“This isn’t your fault you know?” Steve said, “The enhancements, Peter getting hurt, non of it is your fault.”
His stomach was churning, acid heartburn had been plaguing him for days. He felt bloated and fatigued, his back was aching, and all he wanted to do was burry himself in his bed covers and sleep until he felt better.
“You’ll regret that!” He snarled advancing on Tony, but before he could reach the distressed Omega, Vision materialized in the room and seized the Doctor by the throat, crushing it like it was made of cardboard.
“And what do you determine hostiles to be?” Tony asked, “Loki level threats, 911, on those I’d agree with you. But what about run of the mill threats. Bank robbers, grand theft auto, hell what about kids cutting class to go and see a movie?” He shook his head, “Cap’s right, this is too much power. The UN would never support it, hell, the US Government would never get it past the Senate. All of those wankers in Congress aren’t going to want to risk having you lot spying on them while they’re enjoying a quicky in the back of a limo with a prostitute!”
Steve smiled broadly at this while Clint protested with mock offence, “What are the rest of us, chopped liver?”
Peter hadn’t thought about that. On the one hand being publicly acknowledged as a superhero could be cool, but on the other it would bring a lot of unwanted attention and could cause issues for his parents. A horrid twist of guilt settled into his stomach at causing so much trouble.
“It’s boring Pep, it’s words on sheets of paper, that is soooo last century, dealing with it makes my brain disintegrate!” Tony had whined on one such occasion, as Pepper had literally dragged him by his ear to his office to sign the damn papers and not lose himself in his lab.
“They will at least give a good write up.” Tony said, “I guess we’ll just have to wait and see what the rest have to say.”
“You should talk to her.” Steve said, “And be careful. Natasha, Sam, and Clint should be arriving here soon, I’ll let them know what’s happening.” He paused, “I’d join you but Peter…”
“The scholarships are for the academically gifted.” Pepper said, “These kids are getting their education paid for by us and then giving SI five years work post Grad. It’s a business arrangement that benefits both parties.”
Once the place was cleaned up and Zach was occupied with colouring in a picture book and Peter was doing his Geography homework, Tony and Steve gathered Rhodey, Bruce and Thor and told them about the letter and Camp Leheigh.
Before they sat down to eat the team had zoom calls from Sam and from Clint, thanking them for the presents and wishing everyone a happy Christmas.
At first he had thought it was just because he was latching onto him as a subconscious replacement for his lost husband. But as time had gone on, he had realized that this was not the case. There enough differences between this and his Tony, that he knew he was falling for this man as he had for his own Tony.
The tension in the room seemed to increase at this, silence falling until Vision spoke up, “It seems we have a lot to talk about.”
"Now Son, can you tell me your name and date of birth?" The Doctor asked once Peter caught his breath.
Steve stared at Tony as if he’d grown a second head, “How do you come up with these scenarios?” He asked,
He was going back to school everyday now, being dropped off either by Tony or Happy and either getting picked up to come home, or going to spend time with his friends in Queens, an adorable chubby Omega boy by the name of Ned, and a Beta girl by the name of MJ.
Tony explained the decision to keep his actions a secret to Zach as best he could without frightening his Son, who had already been traumatized enough for one lifetime. He explained it in a way of saying how comic book super-heroes kept their identities a secret in order to protect their civilian lives and families, and how The Doctor never actively sort out recognition for what he had done, he left his actions speak for themselves.
“I am not having sex with you in a hospital supply closet!” He hissed thoroughly scandalized by the thought of it, and, to his shame, slightly turned on too.
Steve saw Tony close his eyes and grimace, he clearly hadn’t wanted his children to see that, and who could blame him, no child should see their parent die.
“Uh huh, and the lock on the gate was surprisingly well oiled.” Tony said, “For an abandoned base it’s sure seen a fair bit of activity.” He looked around and tapped his ear piece, “J, you with me buddy?”
“Oh please try.” Tony goaded, “I’d love to see you try and explain to a court how you deserve compensating for the loss of the limb you were using to vivisect my son.”
Before they could head to Rose Hill or Fuck-hell as Tony called it, Tony had to stabilize the extremis in Zach’s body.
“Okay.” Steve said, while he would admit Tony walking in the suit would be incredible he didn’t see how it could change the lives of thousands of people.”
“Tony Stark cannot be held accountable for the actions of others. He didn’t force these people to experiment on his children, he didn’t bring them into his children’s lives, he has simply had to deal with the consequences of their having done so.” Congressman Reynolds said.
Steve had learned a lot about having kids since he had moved into the tower. He had learned that when a kid came into the living room and sat down in front of the TV, the programs on the TV became their choice no matter what, and that generally meant that he was watching Doctor Who, Ninja Turtles, Thunder Cats, or something of that ilk.
Sam came into the bedroom, he stopped dead and his eyebrows shot towards his hair when he saw Tony plastered over Steve slumping quite peacefully.
“Jarvis get Bruce, get a stretcher with a full back brace.” Steve ordered fumbling with his uniform and pulled a tourniquet out of one of the compartments, he pushed it down into the wound on Tony’s back wincing and apologising as Tony whimpered in pain and shuddered beneath him.
Steve glanced up at the images, “What do you want to do?” He asked, “This isn’t just my wedding, its yours too.”
Everyone wanted to know how Harley knew the Avengers and why he was being treated as a friend to them.
Tony was interested to see who Zach took after when it came to height, himself or Obie. Stane had been tall even for an Alpha and so far Zach had been on the higher end for Omega’s so he might favour his father in height.
Just as unspoken of were the back street abortionists, Omegas and Beta Women, already unable to feed the offspring they had sort these people out, desperate to put an end to yet another pregnancy, knowing that there was just no way they could cope with another mouth to feed.
“Oh Jesus!” Bruce cried as he and Thor reached the bottom of the stairwell. Steve didn’t turn around as they approached and got down besides him.
“Or he, she, or they, were in league with A.I.M. Knew when the attack was to take place and when the security systems would be down so they could go into the lab and get the sceptre.” Natasha said, tapping her fingernails on a workbench, glancing at Butterfingers who beeped besides her curiously, looking rather like a curious cat lifting itself onto its back legs, neck craned, and nose sniffing furiously at the air.
One outside the cell Tony kept his head down and tried to avoid waddling even though his pelvis didn’t really give him much choice. He had no idea which way to go, so he just headed down the corridor, ducking his head even more when he passed by guards on his way, he knew it wouldn’t be long before the Doctor was discovered and once that happened the entire base would be in uproar searching for him, so he had to move as fast as he could.
Pepper became his PA in 2000, after Obie got sick of Tony constantly being late or just not showing up to meetings, not returning phone calls, e-mails, and just disappearing into his lab binges. Happy followed soon after, technically as a bodyguard since some idiots still thought that they could make quick money kidnapping Tony despite Howard being long dead and SI having a policy of not negotiating with terrorists. However Tony used him more as a driver and even that was few and far between, but he was part of Tony’s small circle, his family.
“Huh. I guess some things are universal.” Tony said, “But really, you don’t have to do this if you’re not ready.”
While Tony and Zach were getting cleaned up, Steve got the bed ready for them, plumping up the pillows and rolling back the bed covers, brewing tea and getting some hot chocolate for Zach. Peter brought a tablet through to the bedroom along with a pack of playing cards, and a box of cookies to snack on.
“Anything, just a few words.” Tony said, “And sign your name so I can run a check on the hand writing.”
With a tiny clutch bag on the crook of her arm and a tacky bright pink balloon wrapped about a pink enveloped gift card, Natasha tottered on her high heels, wobbling deliberately with a helpless look on her face.
He tried to move, tried to put his hands flat on the ground and push himself up but he didn’t have the strength and the slightest movement sent lightning bolts shooting through his back. Laying still seemed the best option to avoid anymore pain, but he couldn’t breathe like this, he needed to move.
Natasha held her ground impassively staring back at Tony, “They were trying to protect the rest of the world.”
Steve’s eyebrow shot up, “Oh will I.” A worryingly smug smirk then stretched over his lips, “Perhaps you will have to do the same.”
“I think we should drop him into a vat while he’s still breathing.” Clint replied, his voice as cold and emotionless as Natasha’s, “Feet first so he has time to suffer before it kills him.”
While those who did speak of these places said it was only the street walkers who came out after dark and tempted the dock workers and factory workers, the truth was, it was all types of Beta women and Omegas, married or not.
“Are you two alright?” He asked looking them over, he winced when he saw the makeshift splint on Tony’s arm.
“Do I have your approval to begin negotiations with the producers then?” Pepper asked them, she waited until she’d gotten nods and various noises of agreements before she rose to her feet, “Alright, I’ll let the PR department know and get back to my afternoon appointments, and Tony don’t forget we have a board meeting tomorrow at eleven am sharp.”
Still, Tony resolved to talk to Steve about his heat, catching the Alpha as he headed to the kitchen for breakfast after his usual morning run and drew him to one side so they could speak in private.
“Tony.” Steve leaned down and pulled the genius into an embrace, “If I can’t have a baby with you then I don’t want a baby with anyone.”
Hydra never gave them anything like this and Winter was keen to sample all things that tasted “Good” since escaping.
The threat of this made Steve want to fight, but this was not the sort of fight he could win like he did battles against villains. He couldn’t plan a court fight, he had no experience on that, didn’t understand law, he would be defenceless against the system, relying on Lawyers to fight for his family. It made him feel impotent, useless, made him want to go and beat his fists into a punch bag until he’d gotten his frustrations out, and if that was how he was feeling, he could only imagine the turmoil that Tony was suffering as they waited in limbo.
As quietly as he could he got out of bed and got himself dressed in his new suit, slipping the mask over his face. He’d decided to go with a full face mask to hide his head completely that way there was no way he could be ID’d.
As Tony was still shaking like a leaf, he was placed between Thor and Steve so that if is step faltered they could steady him easily. Steve offered to carry him but Tony refused, insisting on walking.
“Sure, I don’t mind.” Peter said shrugged, he’d miss Ned and MJ, but he could see them at break, and anyway it might be Flash and Harry having a different schedule not him.
Frowning, he took the spoon out of his mouth and helped himself to another spoonful of Ben and Jerry’s. “If I can make contact with Jarvis I can find out where the Wings are being stored, then it’ll just be a matter of breaking them out of the facility.” He shrugged, “It’ll piss off the military, but I don’t give a fuck, that’s what Honeybear is for.”
Zach pouted, “Repons… reasons….repsontily sucks!” He declared mangling the words and wiped his nose on his sleeve making Tony cringe.
Okay, maybe that was an exaggeration, but something dressing in comfy clothes and eating comfort food sounded damn good right now.
“Because out PR department have received an interesting proposition.” Pepper replied, rolling her eyes at Clint’s snorting and Tony’ snicker.
“Tony.” Steve breathed throwing himself down and scrabbling at the dirt, everyone followed his lead, shifting away the charred brick and metal, revealing more and more of the armour until finally enough of it was clear for Thor to get his arms about the torso and pull it up and out of the rubble revealing a naked and bloody Peter cradled in the arms completely shielded from the fire.
So between them they explained the situation to Sam, how they had discovered that Hydra had no only survived but was thriving, how Bucky had been found and turned into an assassin for Hydra, that he’d been the one to attack them and apparently had no idea who he was or who Steve was. How they had fought him and escaped barely with their lives and wound up in Sam’s backyard.
Steve didn’t hesitate with his answer, “Germany.” He said recalling Dr Erskine’s words to him about the Nazi’s first invasion being their homeland.
Zach had been pretty sullen and withdrawn for the first few days when they’d gotten home, missing Tony and wanting to go back to Prague, but once school started he was sufficiently distracted by his friends and his lessons and soon perked up again, delightedly telling Tony everything he had done that day.
“He is, thankfully. He’s still in hospital at the moment but we hope he’ll be home soon.” Steve said, “However he is still facing difficulties, as is Zach, as their schools have decided to suspend them because they are enhanced.”
“Gets is from her Dad.” Steve said looking proud at Lily despite the fact the word was not really the best one.
Steve’s brows rose and he gave Tony a helpless look, “I’m not sure.” He said looking at elegant hotel reception rooms, pricey overseas castles, and was that a cruise ship?
Tony liked to sleep as long as possible before his bladder was screaming for release, then he would stagger to the bathroom and stagger to the nearest coffee pot.
He looked up at Tony with big pleading eyes, begging to be allowed to stay. At this point Steve and Peter arrived panting, having run all the way.
“Looks can be deceptive.” The detective said, “Maybe this is karma getting even with him, and I hope I don’t even meet who shot him, I’d rather thank them than arrest them for it!”
“Okay MJ I’m gonna need you to disable to alarms.” He said taking hold of the side of the skylight rim.
“I don’t think you need psychiatry Tony,” He said, taking a seat opposite him, “I don’t think this is mental health.”
“True.” Steve agreed, “But you could take a sabbatical or remote pilot the suit. And I should probably get my erm… stuff checked out, I can’t be sure what the serum did my….”
He’d hoped that at least he’d be able to this for Steve, to at least be able to give him a child, but his stupid body had let him down again, refusing to let him do the one thing that Omega’s were meant to do for their mates.
“Zach, come on.” Tony said trying to coax the little boy out of his cocoon, “I know you’re upset but this won’t change anything.”
Tony choked as he stared at Killian, out of the corner of his eye he saw something that couldn’t be real, it couldn’t be the Iron Man suit minus a gauntlet, but suddenly repulsors were blasting Killians back and they were both flying across the ground.
Natasha scoffed, “Hasn’t this obsession of yours already cause enough harm Stark?” she asked, “This what led to the Ultron disaster is it not?” again Tony flinched at the mention of Ultron and looked away.
Options. He knew that, he did, he could terminate, it wasn’t like he’d been planning this, it wasn’t like he was parent material, but…. For some reason he couldn’t get the image of a pup, his pup out of his head, he imagine holding a tiny infant in his arms, rocking them to sleep, holding their tiny hands as they took their first steps. He imagine baking brownies in the kitchen and getting chocolate in his hair and over his face, imagined playing hide and seek, tag, and dress ups. He imagined himself teaching his Pup about science and technology, working on projects with them in the lab.
“You’re my Son too.” Steve said moving up to sit behind Peter and put his arm about the boy’s shoulders, “You and Zach are my sons, and I love you as my own flesh and blood. Please don’t ever think that our lives would be better without you because it isn’t true, we love you Peter, unconditionally.”
“I am an adult, but I have never claimed to be responsible.” Tony replied, rubbing his aching stomach, his only solace being that Clint was suffering the same as he was.
The Doctor who entered the cell didn’t notice that there was anything wrong at first, Stark was in bed asleep as usual, the only thing different was they the catheter had leaked, again.
“Damn the boy is fast.” Steve muttered leaping down the first flight of stairs and sprinted around the second, jumping down them, and continued on until he reached the bottom of the stairs and ran out into the lobby, just in time to see Zach’s retreating figure through the glass double doors of the hotel.
Fear gripped at Tony’s insides like a giant fist had wrapped around his intestines and begun to squeeze.
“Cryogenics.” Tony said, “They keep him in the freezer, pop him out and send him on a job then shove him back in. He doesn’t age, doesn’t do anything but sleep until he’s needed.” He let out a deep breath, “It must be the super soldier serum keeping him from being brain damaged.” Steve looked at him sharply and he shrugged, “Freezing human tissue is easy, its meat, it freezes like any meat, it’s the thawing someone out that’s the hard part, it results in brain damage, the serum is what protected you and I’d guess what’s protected him.”
“I shall endeavour not to.” Jarvis said, “Even if said family comes with three misbehaving little brothers.” He of course meant Dumm-E, You, and Butterfingers whom Friday was having the joy of taming in Tony and his absences.
Steve wanted to argue, he wanted to refuse. He didn’t want Tony to go through this again at all even if it was one more time, but if he did so then they couldn’t get the readings that they needed and it would either take longer or they would never find a way to neutralize Wanda’s power.
This was different, the Chitauri were still out there, that vast army was still out there, the only thing keeping them for a second invasion was the distance between them and earth, and distances could be travelled, even vast distances, and portals could be opened, like the Bifrost thing Thor had used, like the tesseract had opened, and Loki was still out there, he had the tesseract, he could be doing anything with it, could be getting ready to lead another invasion, a bigger one, and this time maybe they wouldn’t be able to stop him!
Sam made a pained noise and sank back into his chair, pinching the bridge of his nose. It wasn’t the first time he’d heard such a speech, there were just as many homophobes in the military as there were openly gays. Under normal circumstances he may have argued with Rogers, tried to correct him, but this was different to most people. Rogers was from a time when it was still very illegal to be gay, he’d been brought up believing that it was immoral and unnatural to behave in such a way. It wasn’t his fault for believing this, it was just the way it was.
By the time they were done it was time for lunch. Sam and Steve had gone back to the villa and made up sandwiches and wraps, bringing them down with bags of crisps and mini snack cakes.
“You cut my Son?” Tony whispered looking up from staring at Peter’s mutilated body to the demented Doctor behind him.
“Don’t try to move, you need to lay still.” Bruce said, Tony recognized his eyes and flicked his eyes down, seeing him and the others around his bed, Steve was at his side, holding his hand and giving him a gentle smile. His youthful face was lined in worry and Tony wished he could stretch out and sooth those lines away. But his body was effectively pinned to the bed by the casts on his leg and arm.
Curien nodded furiously, “And that is nothing compared to what I will do to you.” Steve growled, “The Nazi’s had some horrific practises and I saw all of them, I’d be more than happy to carry some out on you.”
Steve, and Clint both chose the filet mignon and while the meat was superb there was far too little of it, or the vegetables, Natasha chose the red snapper and donated some of her rice to the two starving men, while Bruce and Tony both had the risotto.
Steve tried to stifle his laugh but really wasn’t successful, alerting Tony and Pepper to his presence in the Tower.
Sharon took them outside of the City, to an underground bunker where non other than Nick Fury was hiding out with Maria Hill.
Pale faced and breathing hard with pain, Clint half sat up and looked over to the others, “How is he?” He asked.
“You don’t have to.” Steve said, “You’ve done so much for me, giving me home, a place to live and feel comfortable, a family again.” He blushed a little, “I mean I know its your family, but, it, I mean.”
“Yeah, I’m researching possible chemical components for making web fluid.” Peter said, “I need it to be highly durable, adhesive, and light.”
But they could cause; Over stimulation of the ovaries resulting in a rupture. Ovarian cysts, phantom pregnancy, heavy post heat bleeding with a large amount of clots.
“I’m okay, be out in a minute.” The rattling on the door stopped and Bucky let out a sigh of relief, quickly he relieved himself and washed his hands, forcing himself not to take the razor even though his hands itched to do so.
Tony groaned as he dragged himself out of his warm comfortable bed and made his way to the bathroom.
Once there they went straight to the train station where Wanda convinced the rail worker to give them first class tickets to Bratislava for free.
As Steve’s posts were read, shared, liked, followed, and gathered more and more attention; Tony took a snap of Steve holding a Stark Tablet and posted it on his account with the caption, “My Hero!”
Zach hummed and cuddled tighter into Tony. They were quiet for a while and Tony thought Zach might have fallen asleep until the little boy spoke again.
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Tony replied. “Scientifically speaking it’s because our bodies stop being able to repair our cells after several decades of life, that being a death of old age. Other’s it’s because of severe injury or illness which the body can’t recover from. As for why this happens, I don’t know, no one does. It’s just the way things are.”
Once enough wood, branches, and vines were acquired, Tony had Zach fetch some flat sided but sharp edged rocks which he had Peter use to sand down to the wood for the planks, which he then set about binding together with the vines and the branches.
Zach hummed and frowned as he thought hard. “I’ll eat yucky greens.” He offered, “And help pack not just get in the boxes.”
“We’re in the middle of nowhere.” Tony said rolling his eyes, “And both boys have seen us nude before, so it really doesn’t matter.”
Had he not been feeling so crappy Tony would have laughed at Jarvis’ snark, but he felt too tired and achy, that was another two things, aching and feeling tired. Just as he had in the early months of his pregnancy with Zach. Damn Hormones.
The lab coat did indeed fit and the voluminous folds of it concealed his bump when he had his hands in the pockets, in one of which he found the locker key. Lastly he took the Doctors shoes and once he had them on he heaved himself back onto his feet and began the arduous task of making his way through the Hydra base.
Spitting blood from his lips and sporting a broken nose and a nasty head injury Steve staggered to his feet and swiftly moved in to disarm the man (No pun) taking the knife and gun from him, which Tony was glad hadn’t been drawn, he then reached up, deflecting the thrashing legs and pulled the mask of the man’s face letting out a gasp of horror when he saw who it was.
Peter was less enthusiastic, he wasn’t at the age where school was fun and something to look forward to, he just missed being with his friends and was happy to be going back so he could spend time with Ned and MJ.
Tony looked to Steve helplessly. The Super soldier looked troubled himself and uncertain of what to say. Neither of them could say that Peter was wrong for defending his friends, they would both do the same to defend theirs, but, Harry was now in hospital, this sort of incident couldn’t happen again.
“Great, if we hit them hard and fast we should be home in time for dinner.” Tony said, “Celebratory burgers on me.”
“Sex isn’t a taboo subject anymore.” Tony said, “The sexual revolution of the sixties saw to that, the invention of the Pill, giving Beta women and Omega’s the freedom to choose whether or not to get pregnant, the legalization of abortion, more contraceptive choices, and the loss of the stigma attached to unmarried mothers have all put pay to the secrecy regarding sex.”
It was something he could do, he could still work for SI, send his designs via email, he could teach the boys himself along with Steve, and they could have food deliveries made monthly. It would be a solution from the scrutiny, but it would leave them isolated, it would deny Peter and Zach the chance to socialize, to have “Normal” childhoods, they would grow up in isolation completely cut off from the rest of the world. That was not what Tony wanted for them, he wanted them to live freely not hidden away like dirty secrets, doing that would be like he was agreeing with the bigots, that Peter and Zach didn’t belong in the regular world, which was completely untrue.
Kindergarten might well be good for him anyway. Tony knew that just because his own school experience had been shit, didn’t mean that Zach’s would be, and anyway, he had never gone to a Pre-school, he’d just been sent to boarding school as soon as he was old enough and dumped in a class of much older children which had prevented him from making friends.
Inside the suit Tony shut his eyes, tears rolling slowly down his ashen cheeks. “My life was ruined a long time ago, Wilson.” He said, in resigned monotone. “I’ve got fuck all left to lose.” He dived for Rogers again, but Romanoff leaped up into the air, lifted by Wanda’s magic, and landed on his back, sinking her widow bites into the suit, shorting out some of the systems and showering Tony in static shocks that left burst veins and superficial burns in their wake.
Steve never got the sentence out as suddenly something heavy landed on the roof of the car caving it in and caused Tony to swerve violently, losing control of the car which spun off the road, going down the embankment before finally coming to a stop against the stone piler of the bridge.
Rhodey was waiting for them outside and was just finishing a call on his phone, “You’re not gonna believe this.” He said,
Wriggling as hard as he could Zach freed himself from under Steve’s arm and crawled out of bed. He scooted down the bed and got onto the floor, making his way to the window and tugging back the curtains so he could see outside.
There was more blood on his clothing, down his front, some on his thighs, smears of it on his face and his neck, some had even dripped down beneath the neck of his clothing and smeared on the skin of his chest.
“I’m sorry sir, but I have two kids here insisting on speaking with the Avengers about your Son, Peter.” The security guard said, “They say he is in danger.”
She looked up, blinking back her own tears which burned her eyes in empathy for what Tony had withstood over the years. He needed someone to care for him, to love him, to accept him for all that he was, flaws, issues, and all. She had thought that she could be the one to do it, had been willing to accept all the flaws and issues, God knows she had already seen them all while working as his long suffering PA. But she had not taken into account Iron Man coming between them, or her own issues about it and the danger Tony placed himself in.
“She found out today.” Tony said, “She thought I might be pregnant, she recognised the symptoms from when I was pregnant with Zach and I had to explain to her, and she said I needed to tell you and she is right, I did, I do, and I’m sorry.”
While they managed to save practically everyone at the expo and arrest Hammer there were two casualties. The legal guardians of a child who’d been wearing an Iron Man mask.
“Great. Thanks for that.” Tony said pinching the bridge of his nose. “Jarvis, get one of the clear bots on it.”
“Dude, TMI!” Clint protested, “What you and our fearless leader get up between the sheets is not a mental image I need.”
Swearing under his breath Howard headed back down to his lab to write up a report on this failure. He’d been sure that this would work, sure he’d gotten the serum right this time. But no, once again he was faced with failure, just as his Son would no doubt prove to be.
“What?” Steve asked taking his hand away from Tony’s mouth and tried not to notice how red and kissable his lips look, all swollen and damp from kissing.
“If it is there then this may be our best chance at getting it back.” Steve said, “And either way, we need to take out that base and give that country a chance to rebuild itself.”
With shaking fingers Tony fumbled with his tie until Steve’s hands closed over his, “Let me,” He said deftly undoing Tony’s tie and taking it off him, next came his shirt and distress contorted Steve’s face as he beheld Tony’s bared torso. Not because of the arc reactor scarring, he’d seen that before, plenty of times when they were a team. It was the prominence of Tony’s bones and his sunken belly that distressed Steve.
Although what he thought that Steve might do, Tony didn’t know. Yet, as he watched Steve settle into the seat of the Stark Jet, he noticed that the super soldier seemed to be on edge himself.
Thanos roared in pain, flinging Mantis off him and tossing the others aside, Tony included, though he kept tight hold of the severed arm and gauntlet. Steve beat at Thanos with his shield, ramming it into the Titan’s face and chest until Thor appeared via the Bifrost with a new weapon and sliced the Titan’s head clean in two.
Steve waited until he was gone from sight then took out his phone and called Pepper, after an exchange of pleasantries he told her why he was calling.
“I’m not gonna let go,” Steve promised straining his muscles, pulling Tony up enough for the Billionaire to get hold of the landing pad, he then wrapped his arms about Tony’s torso and hauled him up and back onto the safety of the pad.
Gently, so he wouldn’t cause the Omega anymore pain than he was already in, Vision took Tony’s hands, holding them carefully and looked deep into Tony’s eyes, “I will find her, they will not take her from this base.”
The Westboro Baptist Church had come out on Rogers side for his views on LGBTQA. But they were among a minority. Only a few random hate groups were on his side, the usual Neo-Nazi dickhead brigade that always sided against LGBTQA. It was kind of funny, in a perverse way, that Steve Rogers, the man who had punched fake Hitler in the face, was now being made a figure head by the Neo-Nazi’s.
Choking on his own tears Peter made an abortive attempt to go to him but Rhodey pulled Peter to his chest and held him tight, Pepper and Happy flanking him as they comforted Peter, letting Sam, Natasha, Clint, and Bruce go to Steve.
He might never have killed in cold blood before but in this case he was going to do it without any difficulty at all.
Both of which had been made with lower fat options, a whisked sponge rather than a Victoria or Madera cake, reduced fat cream cheese icing, and reduced fat cheese on the pizza.
Steve was standing in his workshop, dressed in a skin tight white T-Shirt, teamed up with stone wash jeans, and an unbuttoned shirt. Lily was cradled to his chest, sucking on her thumb and gazing about with her big bright eyes in wonderment.
Tony’s heats had been erratic even before he’d had Zach. Years of being on suppressants, drinking excessively, his poor diet, and drug abuse over the years, and the palladium poisoning had all had an effect on him. While a regular Omega could expect to have three or four heats a year, Tony could have two or he could end up with as many as six. The unpredictability made it difficult for him to plan accordingly.
The teacher laughed, “And we’ve missed you too Zach.” She said, “Now run along to class and I’ll see you later.”
“Oh god, Oh my God, oh God, we’re dead, we’re officially dead, we’re totally and completely dead and going to hell. I’m going to hell, I’m gonna burn in hell!”
As guests they had access to the hotel gym, spa, and swimming pool, they were invited to dine at the restaurant and partake of the cocktail bar, with the price being added to the final bill.
Pepper sat down her papers and braced herself as the questions began, journalists and reporters shouting over one another trying to get their question in first. She answered as many of the questions as she could, having to remind some reporters that with an official investigation going on she couldn’t answer some questions.
“Uh it’s Morgan.” Tony said, “Morgan Heidi Rogers-Stark.” Vision set him down on the bonnet of one of the disabled cars and Steve placed Morgan back into his arms. “This is the outside world Morgan, look, that’s your first look at the sky, there is a reason why its blue and I’ll explain that to you one day, I’ll teach you all about the Ozone, the atmosphere, solar system and how all of it works.”
“You’re not getting cold feet are you?” Pepper quietly asked him as he looked through a row of collarless silk shirts.
Jarvis zoomed into Sokovia, going to a town on the outskirts of which a large castle sat upon the mountainside with woods on either side.
“J, what the fuck?” Tony groaned, rubbing his face and reluctantly shifting from his cocoon of duvet and Steve.
Since escaping Hydra and getting this place they had tried to stay aware of the news that was going on in the world, always ready to run at the first sign of trouble. Well James was, Winter wanted to fight. He always wanted to fight.
Peter sighed, and wondered if he could somehow talk Natasha into slipping a tranquilizer to Ned, it might be the only way to keep him from begging Tony for a ride.
“We can explain everything Mr Stark, I promise!” Came Peter’s voice and Sam resisted the urge to face palm, especially when Deadpool breathed on the glass and began to draw obscene pictures in the condensation.
“She certainly is,” Tony said, unsticking his tongue from the roof of his mouth, “Steve, this is our worlds Birdbrain, Feather head, this is Steve Rogers.”
“Thanks.” Tony murmured, he really wanted to cover up, but he needed to get his side treated and wrapped first.
People would declare him a monster, would demand he be locked up so he couldn’t harm anyone else, others would want to manipulate him, to use his powers for their own purposes. There was even the likelihood of Tony’s competency as a parent being called into question, social serviced may decided to become involved and once those bastards got a foot in the door it was almost impossible to get rid of them again.
“What? Steve! I know they are growing up fast but Peter and Zach are at least two decades away from having kids!” Tony cried, “We’ve got a long way to go before we need to worry about that.” He pushed away from Steve and picked up the tablet he’d placed on the kitchen counter, “Okay J, show me the movies Pete has selected, I want to make sure he’s not trying to get any 18 plus past me. That kid is devious as hell when he wants to be.”
Zach and Peter were very popular at the party, all of the children crowded around them to learn what it was like living with Superheroes and was so jealous that Zach had his own Tardis. After checking with everyone’s parents and having Happy accompany them, Zach was allowed to take the younger children to his bedroom to show them his Tardis and Daleks.
“No.” Tony said with a smile, “There might be some fans present but you are not under any obligation to interact with them and you don’t have to speak to the Paps either. Just say hello, give some smiles and a wave or two, then head up into the building.”
Clint shoved past Natasha and grabbed the Skrull by its shirt, dragging it back and slammed it against the wall. “What does that mean?” He snarled into the creatures face.
Steve looked around in amazement, what Tony described as basic was in fact luxury to anyone else, plush stylish corner suite sofa sat around an antique fire place that had holographic flames which Tony just had to show off to Steve, a huge TV mounted above said fire place, an over stuffed arm chair and puff sat before one of the two towering book cases which at present were empty save for a few artfully placed ornaments.
“The good Doctor here believes that he can manipulate the Infant’s growth so they reach maturity in a matter of months. Think of that, Stark, you’ll have created a new generation of super soldier, in the service of Hydra.”
“I uh, I need to apologise to you.” He said as Tony made his way back around his desk and retook his seat, gesturing for Steve to make use of one of the other chairs before the desk,
Zach nodded still sniffing and rested his head on Tony’s shoulder his previous enthusiasm gone, “Wanna go home Mamma.” He mumbled.
“Enhanced.” It was MJ that spoke and she was speaking quietly and looked nervous herself, “So you’re….uh…”
“After all the help your Son gave me, I think it’s the least I can do.” Tony said truly not caring about the money, he was far more concerned with how Peter and Harley were becoming thick as thieves in the new workshop. “Don’t you two start getting ideas on plotting against me.” he called out to them, “I’ve told you already Pete, college first, world domination after.”
Tony looked Peter over feeling sick to his stomach. Peter was naked and strapped down with metal restraints that were digging into his pale skin, there was a bloody bandage about his right thigh, and horror of horrors a Y incision down his torso that was spilling blood out onto his pale skin and dripping down onto the metal gurney beneath him.
He could recall the feel of Tony’s flesh when his hands had spanned his back, picture the relaxed pose of his face when he slept. Taste his breath and kisses upon his lips. Hear the sound of his cries as they lay together, smell the scent of his aftershave, mixed with coffee, motor oil, and heated metal.
“We have scheduled team training sessions twice to three times a week depending on everyones availability.” Steve explained, he was dressed in a vest that clung to every muscle and a pair of tracksuit bottoms that were so tight they should have been illegal.
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” Steve assured him, kneeling to pull off Tony’s shoes, and lifted his legs up onto the bed, getting Tony to lay down, “Do you need anything?” He asked, his brow creasing at the pallor of Tony’s skin and the look of desolation in his eyes. He’d been running on adrenaline only and now that was used up he had nothing left to sustain him.
Tony glanced around at the equipment, “Gimme a day and a half.” He said, “But as I already told Natasha, it’s going to have to be directly uploaded into Shield’s servers, I can put it on a memory stick but I can’t remotely put it into the servers.”
Not even his favourite double chocolate fudge brownie sundae with extra whipped cream and caramel syrup was enough to distract him from worrying about his Brother. Instead of gobbling it up as he normally would, he swirled his spoon about in the dish and poked at the brownie pieces.
Steve smiled down into Tony’s hair and kissed his head, “It wasn’t Captain America who did that,” He said, “It was just me, Steve Rogers, fiancé and Father.”
Tony frowned; he’d been having these recurring nightmares ever since he’d been in that lab, had been going through one while he’d been unconscious during his surgery and coma. But he’d seen it before then, had seen the nightmare images while he’d still been in the base hadn’t he?
“Lay him down here.” One of the paramedics instructed Steve, guiding him to a stretcher where he carefully lay Peter’s limp form down.
“Yeah baby. Tell Rhodey to tell Sam to fly Matt out on a Quin jet, they’ll get here faster than a conventional plane.”
“We need to find cover.” Steve shouted to Natasha, his pace increased, not to his maximum but enough to match Natasha’s. He flinched as did Natasha and Tony as guns were fired, the bullets not finding their targets but making very aware of how precarious their situation was.
Tony sat on the bank watching and filming their antics, Peter and Zach splashed Steve and tried to push him over, only Peter had the strength to do so, but Steve humoured Zach and let himself be pushed under water.
“Bossman is attempting to make you breakfast in bed, Captain Rogers.” FRIDAY informed him, “I do have the fire department on standby and am ensuring that nothing he concocts will cause death!”
Tony was filmed weight training, both with dumbbells, bell bars, and machines. He was also filmed jogging on the treadmill, using the elliptical machine, and boxing. He used the punch bags and he got into the ring with Steve and Natasha, going several rounds with them.
“Enjoying the show?” Steve asked running his fingers through his hair and moving the scatter pillows before getting into bed.
“Attack!” Came a yell from above and suddenly a rain of wet toilet paper came crashing down on them.
Zachary Stark and Peter Parker Stark will not be interviewed, questioned, harassed, or forced to participate in the making of this documentary.
“You might do, your joints are really old!” Peter teased hugging Tony and ducked under YOU’s claw as he extended his arm towards Tony,
“Okay Mamma, I’ve got to go now, but I’ll be back tomorrow.” Peter said squeezing Tony’s hand, “You have a good sleep, and we’ll see you in a few hours.”
Once they had found the triggers for Zach’s power, they had to teach him to control it and not allow it to control him. This was going to take more time, it wasn’t as simple as turning off a tap, it would take Zach a while to learn to contain the natural instinct to fight, however, part of his martial arts training was to learn self-control so he was already learning this along with mediation, which Bruce also helped him with as he did a lot of mediation himself to try and keep Hulk under control.
“I fucking hate shrinks; I hate them almost as much as I hate the Paps, and whoever it was that sold those fucking photos to the fucking tabloids.”
Tony found himself standing in the spot that Coulson had died looking down at photo’s of Zach and Peter on his phone, wondering how he’d break the news to them.
“Could it be tonsillitis?” Steve asked recalling getting that very often as a boy, “What about measles or mumps?” He was taken aback by Bruce scowl, these were common ailments during his childhood.
“Just give him a few minutes Zach.” Bruce said, he smiled gently at the ashen faced Peter, “He’ll be alright.”
Tony closed his eyes and let out a slow breath, like steam escaping from a boiling pot. “Whatever,” he said, holding up his hands and parting them, “He is your problem, you deal with him.” This was directed at Steve, though Tony did not bother to open his eyes until he had turned around to head back to the common area, or perhaps the workshop.
Tony did feel sorry for Harry. He might be a brat but he didn’t deserve to be uprooted and dumped by his Father. The police had kept the identity of the relative secret to try and protect them and Harry, the boy shouldn’t be made to suffer for what his Father had done, but there would be plenty of people that would take out their grievances on him in Norman’s place.
“Slowly lower him onto the gurney.” A Doctor instructed, her English perfect but accented. “How long has he been unconscious?”
"Yes Sir." The PA said hurrying out of the office, thinking only of his Christmas bonus which was the only thing that made this job worthwhile.
Steve nodded, “That’s plausible and I doubt anyone will argue.” He glanced through the window of Peter’s room to where Zach was enacting the battle for Peter, bouncing on the bed as he dramatically told his story, “What does he think of this?”
“You know, I’ve just gotta ask, if you are so much smaller in body than Supersized America over there, does that mean you’re you know,” He lowered his voice to stage whisper, “Smaller down there too?”
“For blaming you for Ultron.” Steve said, “I thought… well never mind what I thought, I was wrong. Wanda said that she did to you what she did to us, that she made you see… Tony, are you okay?”
“Mamma!” Zach cried out choking on a sob, he coughed and spluttered, gulping in air far too fast. Tears were rolling down his cheeks and evaporating on his skin which was turning red and blistered as the heat seeped out of his body.
“What, Rhodey, permission for what?” Tony asked, his mind already running over the possibilities for their date and cataloguing his wardrobe options and whether or not getting a new suit would be best, if he asked Pepper, (Which he would) she would undoubtedly drag him on a shopping trip which would inevitably lead to him adding to her wardrobe too.
To their credit the Avengers were ready to go within six minutes of Steve calling them to assemble, hurrying onto the Quinjet that was idling on the landing pad.
“Not now Jay.” Tony grunted, struggling to remain coherent as Steve seemed to be fucking his brains right out of him. Steve was beneath him, had Tony shoved up against his wardrobe, Tony’s legs thrown over his shoulders and was testing the flexibility of Tony’s body as he thrust into him.
“Everyone loves Zach,” Tony said rolling his eyes at the thought of his toddler, “He’s impossible not to love. All big eyes and cheeky smiles, everyone melts when they see him.”
“I’ve missed you too.” Steve said getting onto the bed and laying down besides Tony, he ran his hand up Tony’s side and cupped his waist, “You feeling okay, not too tired from all the travelling?”
Steve had just put Lily down for a nap and was planning on doing some training. He’d been on his way to ask Tony if he was up for sparring when he had found him cuddled in Pepper’s arms. At first he had thought he had walked in on them in a delicate moment. But then he had met Pepper’s eyes and seen the worry in them. That, along with the shudders coming from Tony had let him know that it was anything but a compromising situation and convinced him to leave them too it.
Fearing the worst, that he’d soiled himself, Tony looked down and the colour drained from his face when he saw that he was splattered in gunky bloody fluid.
Tony threw the paper across the penthouse and glared at it, smirking when Gingerbread leaped from the sofa and dive bombed the sheets, clawing at them happily.
“Oh, no, well, I guess, but I can’t exactly do that when I’m not seeing anyone. It takes two to make a baby, and being a single parent doesn’t leave much time for dating.” Not that Tony was interested in dating, he’d not thought about it at all since Obie’s death, firstly because he was pregnant and still recovering from Afghanistan, then he had a baby to take care of, the palladium poisoning to deal with, then Peter came along, and the last couple of years had just flown by; Tony had been completely consumed by caring for two children, purchasing land to build the tower, getting the tower built, moving to the tower, and then all the shit with Loki had happened, sex had really been the last thing on his mind.
Unable to resist, Tony fluttered his eyelashes and foppishly lay a hand over his heart, putting on his best Southern Belle voice, “Why Captain, you do know how to sweep a girl off her feet!”
“They are afraid of getting hurt.” He said, “Neither of them has realized that the other feels the same and they are both afraid that if they speak out they will be rejected.”
Once everyone had eaten they took turns taking showers, shaving, and getting their swimwear on. Natasha posed smugly in her bikini that covered just enough skin to be legal in public and smirked at the blushes her curves drew from the men. She also commandeered Clint to smother her fair skin in sunscreen before she doned a sun hat, a pair of sunglasses and flip flops ready to go to the beach.
If the press were not screaming before, they sure as hell were now. Captain America declaring himself homosexual before the whole world had everyone crying out questions and snapping pictures.
Telling MJ and Peter over the weekend had been Steve’s suggestion, as it would give them time to answer any questions and alleviate any doubts that the pair might have before they went back to their respective parents.
Bucky frowned at Steve, looked at his hand and then back again, slowly and awkwardly shaking his hand, “Bucky’s fine.” He murmured, “I…” He broke off as his stomach rumbled loudly making Tony grin,
“Did he just nod off?” Tony asked screwing his face up in disgust. Natasha snarled under her breath and slapped the back of his head.
Giggling, Morgan let go of the couch and took a step away from it, then another and another, she giggled louder as Tony encouraged her on until she reached him and he swept her up into his arms. “Whose Mamma’s clever girl, whose Mamma’s big girl?”
Steve had changed clothes. Gone were the baggy khaki shorts and loose vest from earlier. Now he was wearing a T-Shirt that was at least two sizes too small which hugged everything, left nothing to the imagination, and just begged to be ripped off those rippling muscles that is was clinging to. Then, to make matters worse, Steve was wearing a pair of shorts which were short in every sense of the word. Denim cut offs with holes in them and they were honest to god clinging to his ass and showing off every scandalous inch of Steve’s thick muscular thighs.
Killian glanced at Tony, “She thinks I don’t know.” He said, “She thinks that I am not already well aware that it is not her that I need to finish this project.” He took a gun from inside his jacket and fired at Maya killing her outright, “It’s you.”
Christmas was now fast approaching and the tower was a flurry of activity with members of the team bringing in gifts which they hurriedly took to their rooms to hide away until Christmas day.
“17A,” He whispered looking at the Locker numbers and letters, a contraction hit and he doubled over, biting his bottom lip to keep from crying out. He tasted blood in his mouth as his teeth pierced his lip and tears sprang into his eyes. Not even Palladium poisoning had hurt as much as this!
Part of Tony, the part that was still furious about Siberia, about Rhodey’s injury, about all that had happened wanted to tell Steve it was his own fault, wanted to tell him he’d have to live with the consequences of his actions and put up with the fact he wouldn’t be part of their daughter’s life.
“It is Mamma.” Peter said, “You’re alive, you’ll get better soon and you can come home to us. Jarvis and Friday are already making conversions to the tower, the lab is being made ready, all the desk tops are going to be lowered or have platforms that Friday can raise for you.”
“I’ll burn you alive!” Killian roared at him, he grabbed Tony by the repulsor covered hand and began to heat up the metal, burning Tony’s hand as he did so. “Everything you are I will destroy!” He seethed at the Billionaire, grabbing him about the throat, “Your legacy will be ashes!”
“Whoa, Tony, slow down and breathe.” Steve said, sitting up and wrapping an arm about Tony’s shoulders, “Just take slow, deep breaths, in and out, nice and calm.”
“Ex-Merchant of Death, and who better than to make a case for the building of this weapon to protect the world than a man who has devoted his life to trying to maintain peace?”
Every so often one of the team would get up to stretch their legs, go to the bathroom, go and get more drinks, or go and speak to Pepper or Rhodey on their phones.
“Where’s Zach?” Steve asked again. Bruce’s expression told him everything he needed to know, and he was on his feet in a moment, nearly falling over as his head swam, but he managed to keep his balance. “We need to call the police.” Steve said, “We need to get Clint and Natasha here, Sam too. We need to find him!”
“Yep, nothin’ special here, just bog standard cock and balls, ohh and speaking of balls, your buddy with the metal masturbating hand has a huge fucking pair. I swear I would love to suck on those sugar plums!”
Tony ascended the stairs, taking more bullets and returning fire until he found two bio signatures, one stationary while the other moved around. The stationary signature was burning hotter than the other and the heartrate was through the roof.
“I’m sure this is nothing that pancakes can’t fix.” Steve said patting Zach’s back, the little boy lifted his head and sniffed,
“Hey, Captain Cute-butt, lemme in, the winds getting nippy around the nether regions if you know what I mean!”
For the second time that night Clint was cleaning his sinuses with coffee, Sam appeared to be having a coughing fit, Bruce was biting his bottom lip, and even Grace looked amused.
“Five, four, three…” She smiled as Clint bolted for the nearest door, “Predictably easy as always.” She cheerfully sent the video to Laura, Clint’s wife, it would be the perfect blackmail material for when Clint was trying to get out of doing the washing up. With a bright smile on her face, Natasha heading for room to go and get changed into the beautiful emerald green Gucci gown that Tony had purchased for her.
As much as Tony doubted that there was anything in the research that could help, Tony went through the boxes, watching an old reel of Howard, with a recording from him at the end giving him a riddle to solve.
Steve ignored the conversation, as did Rhodey, the two of them following Clint and Natasha into the cell.
Steve felt a lump form in his throat which he had to swallow past as he nodded his head, “I know,” He whispered, “And we won’t fail. Not this time.”
Peter let out an ooff of air as Zach leaped on top of him, he was ready for bed, had even been put to bed and looked adorable in his Captain America pyjamas, especially with his gravity defying curls going every which way.
“Four,” Tony charged up the repulsors and took aim, “Fi….” He didn’t get to finish as all of the guards holstered their guns and ran, “Pussies.” Tony muttered continuing on through the factory, “Jarvis, give me the layout of this rats maze.”
“No.” Tony said, “Steve and I will go in, you guys can wait outside, keep an eye out for danger, don’t engage unless strictly necessary.”
Steve gave Zach a huge set of brand new colouring pencils, water based paints, chalks, and pastels. He also got him books on introductions to art, drawing paper, and a child’s easel and selection of paint brushes. Zach had seen Steve sketching several times and voiced an interest in learning to do more than make blobby figures or matchstick figures so this had given Steve the perfect idea for a birthday present.
After Tony and Steve made the rounds talking to people, shaking hands, and making polite conversation, they went and took their places at the top table, where they were served a three course meal with a choice of Champagne, white, or red wine.
In the distance sirens could be heard screaming, police, ambulance, and fire department vehicles were rushing to the scene and not a moment too soon as Natasha and two of the workers uncovered a woman who was barely clinging to life. She was badly burned and had crush injuries to her lower body, needed immediate medical treatment if she was to survive.
“Some sort of altercation happened between your Son and Mr Osborn. I am not sure of all the details yet, but Peter was seen by multiple teachers hitting Mr Osborn who has had to go to hospital.” He looked at Peter with a confused and disappointed look which made Peter’s stomach churn, “This behaviour is very unlike your Son, he’s never been involved in such things before.”
“We don’t have exact figures but there is something else.” Natasha said, the view changed and a graph of wave lengths appeared. “Jarvis ran scans of the base and the surrounding area and picked up very unusual readings.”
Wincing Tony dared to look at Pepper who was glaring at him, “Steve doesn’t know I’m having treatment.” He said, “We were going to start trying for baby and I thought I’d get checked out first. My test results came back showing that I’m pretty much screwed without aggressive medical assistance. Steve didn’t want me to suffer through all of this, but I know he really wants a baby, so I decided to get treatment.”
“A documentary crew have asked to get access to you all and film enough footage of your day to day lives to create a two hour long documentary.” Pepper explained. “Now, I know you are not fond of dealing with the media, but this would afford some positive press and exposure. Since the battle of New York a lot of attention had already been placed upon you and that had only grown since the battle in Washington, the Mandarin, and most recently, London.”
Pierce scowled and looked to the blurred faces of the W.S.C personnel on his laptop screen, their identities hidden even while in conference with their own.
“You can’t throw him off the tower, he might land on someone and kill them.” Steve protested, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and pulling him back,
Getting through Manhattan was still difficult, and getting to Stark Tower was even harder but Steve had learned a few tricks in WWII that came in handy in avoiding the police barricades so he was able to pull up outside of Stark Towers and headed into the building, unsurprisingly he was stopped by security before he reached the lift, but once the receptionist had made a phone call to her HR, who’d called Pepper, who in turn had called, (Slapped a distracted Tony upside the head to get his attention) Steve was allowed to go to the Penthouse and given access to Tony’s private garage to park his bike first.
The light fell so it wasn’t directly in Tony’s face and the man stepped closer revealing himself, a mid to late thirties African American, in good shape, wearing an army surplus T-Shirt and boxer shorts with a set of dog tags dangling around his neck. The man frowned as he looked closer at Tony, seeing the injuries he was sporting and recognising him.
This started another argument with the night staff that Steve took away from Tony and Peter, leaving Tony to soothe Peter and gently get him to lower his hands down from his ears.
“It’ll be mute man if you don’t shut up.” Natasha said, “And as for what brings us here. Clint and I have been stood down from active Shield Duty until such time as Fury can get it up and running again. Clearing out Hydra has made things difficult, it could be a long time before Shield is back in business.”
“It’s my Son!” Tony cried shoving Steve’s hand away, “Fuck plans, if anyone gets in my way they die, that’s my plan.”
He was my best friend since as long as I can remember, and when ever those bullies hurt me, he’d stand up to them when I couldn’t, he’d make them back off, or he’d help me make them back off.
Steve's breath hitched at Tony's wickedly skilled fingers and closed his eyes, forcing himself to concentrate so he wouldn't just fall apart. "I believe we may have a raid to begin." He said and without warning flipped Tony over onto his front and pinned him there, getting between his thighs and peeled off his boxers, tossing them to the shore. "We must begin an invasion of enemy territory."
As he did this, Tony sat silently at the counter, his shoulders pulled up and expression pinched. He looked completely exhausted by everything, as if he had given everything and had nothing else left to sustain himself anymore.
Tony snuggled into Steve, letting himself be lifted up into Steve’s powerful arms and carried across his lab to the couch, where Steve sat, with Tony cradled on his lap and in his arms, slowly crying himself out.
“You are acting like you are, being more dramatic than usual.” Pepper rose a challenging eyebrow at him, “Plus suffering an upset stomach.” She said nodding to the bottle of ginger ale in his hand, “Just like when you were pregnant with Zach.”
By the end of the dinner a pressure had built up and Tony had to excuse himself to the bathroom fearing that his stomach upset was about start coming out of the other end, however nearly ten minutes of cramping and moaning afforded him nothing.
She could be proud of him, supportive even, but she did not have the strength to be his girlfriend or wife, and that was her problem, not Tony’s, which was what she had hoped she had gotten through to him.
“I am so very sorry for your loss, Mr Stark.” Vision said, meaning Tony’s parents. “Though I cannot imagine your pain, I can, perhaps empathize with what the loss must feel like.”
“On it Boss,” Friday replied, moments later the gauntlets were on his hands, the chest plate was closing around his torso and the boots were enclosing his feet. The helmet had just come down over his head when a figure came through the portal, shocking Tony into freezing on the spot.
When they both felt like they could breathe again they broke apart but remained with their hands holding each other.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose as Zach hurriedly began to help clean up, “I regret them ever meeting.” He sighed unhappily.
“Just like his Mamma.” Pepper teased. She sighed and sat up straighter, “Well, if you don’t like the psychologist idea then maybe you should let Cap give him some training.”
“You handled yourself well the last twice you’ve gone into battle,” Rhodey said, “And we need all the help we can get, and I’m sure that Tony would be happy to have you on our team.” Vision hummed and inclined his head,
Peter stared at Harry wondering at first if this was a very bad joke, because really, how could his being bitten by a radioactive spider his fault? But as the second past he realized that Harry wasn’t joking quite the opposite, he was deadly serious in blaming Peter for Norman’s recent difficulties.
“Let’s see.” Bruce said making his way over and kneeling down besides Zach to look at what he was pointing at, “Oh, no, that’s a Gibbula Cineraria.” Bruce said, “A sea snail, and look, there’s some Whelks, see the conical shells?”
It took every ounce of strength Steve had in him not to start growling every time and Alpha or a male Beta approached Tony or touched him, all of them seemed to get too close to the Omega for his liking, their hand shakes lingering too long and glances upon his person being too lascivious.
“But if he did that then he’d be denounced, the president and the joint chiefs would see him stripped of rank and dishorably dischared.” Steve said.
Natasha and Clint had been into the hospital to speak with him since Norman’s disappearance, posing as Doctor’s to get past the police guard on the door. They both believed him to be telling the truth, and sadly, while he could give chapter and verse on Norman’s wrong doing, he couldn’t prove involvement with Stern or Ross.
“Do something heroic. Save the world again, then everyone will forget about this and just remember that you are the heroic Captain America, and that Stark is nothing but a liar and a murderer.”
Peter had thrown his arms about Tony and hugged him so tight that Tony had trouble breathing when he’d opened the Stark made play station that not only had hand controls, but also virtual reality viewing and audio. The team had known about this and had gotten him games to play on the gaming system that Peter couldn’t wait to show to Ned.
The Police was already calling an Amber Alert. Dozens of officers were stomping all over the tower, dusting for prints, snapping photos, taking statements.
He let out a heavy sigh and stared at the ceiling trying to take everything in and make sense of it. After three minutes he gave up and got out of bed, falling to the floor to start sit ups, push ups, and squats, he didn’t have his gym gear so he couldn’t go jogging and he didn’t fancy trying to do it in his uniform or the borrowed clothes that Stark… no, that Tony had provided that apparently belonged to Happy Hogan, his driver/bodyguard/kids baby sitter. They were too large on Steve’s slender physique, Happy was not a small man he had very broad shoulders and a thicker waist than Steve, but was not quite as long in the leg or arm, so the trousers and t-shirt sat a little oddly on him, but they were less conspicuous than his uniform so until he went back to his apartment he could make do.
He’d caught his breath by the time the lift reached the third floor and he walked steadily to his Mamma’s room and went right in, finding his Mamma talking with Jarvis and working on something on a tablet.
It had a consciousness, a will of its own. It wasn’t one they could speak with or reason with so far as they could tell, while they could map out the consciousness and show it on a holographic display, they couldn’t communicate with it.
“That deranged lunatic abducted us and forced us to fly here in a Quinjet!” Clint exclaimed pointing a finger at Deadpool, “He had Spidey at gun point and said he’d shoot him if I didn’t fly us all here!”
Hulk grunted and tossed a slab of concrete the size of a bus across the car park, “Birdy go steady, Hulk find Tin Man and Little Spider.” He rumbled out.
“We’ll get you checked out to be certain you are not getting an infection and we’ll get this bed changed and settle you back in.” The Nurse with a kind smile that Tony couldn’t return. He had never felt so humiliated in his life, other people having to clean him like a child, having to put him to bed like a child, he was a grown man, he should be taking care of himself for God sakes!
Norman smirked back at him, “If he is as traumatized as you say then he is indeed a danger to others.” He said to Tony, “Or at least that is an argument I can make,” He glanced at the Principal and school board, “And have my lawyers pursue,” The Principal’s eyes widened and the school board shifted uncomfortably, “Unless….”
“Come on!” He hissed, “We’ve…” His eyes landed on Tony and without hesitating he raised the AK47 he was carrying and fired.
Thor wore a pair of scanty, skin tight swimming trunks that were only just longer than a speedo, he was also carrying a bucket and spade as he had read that making sand castles was a Midgardian tradition when visiting the beach.
“Its so totally awesome you and Mr Stark are letting us stay over all weekend, Mr, I mean Captain America Rogers.”
“I’d rather be inside you.” Tony’s dark eyes light up at the thought and he nodded eagerly. Laying languidly as Steve retrieved the lube and slicked them both up. With his body sated it was easier for him to relax enough for Steve to enter him, though Tony knew he’d be feeling it come the morning as he was stretched and filled with the Super soldier’s girth.
He practised firing the web fluid at walls and the ceiling, using it to climb and to swing from it so he could become comfortably doing so. He then began to shoot it at random objects, when he had his aim down on stationary targets he moved onto moving targets.
Norman Osborn let out a scoff as news reached him via his PA that Peter had regained consciousness and was breathing unassisted with no sign of permanent damage.
Zach scurried behind some large packing crates and paused to catch his breath before he caught sight of a door, biting down on his bottom lip and ran for the door and stood on his tip toes to get the handle, by luck the door wasn’t locked and he was able to get through to what looked to be where the products were packed up ready for shipping.
“Damn.” Tony murmured allowing himself to ogle his fiancé, hmm, just look at those back muscles as he digs into the ground, just look at those buttocks and quads, fuck…. Look at those biceps….,
“Their kissing and making funny noises.” Zach told Thor one time when his parents had taken advantage of the situation and gone to their bedroom. “They must really enjoy cuddling and wrestling.” He added.
MJ snorted with laughter while Ned punched the air at Peter's snark, they were both scolded by the teacher for not paying attention, Flash getting a free pass as usual.
Stripping an unconscious man wasn’t easy, but Tony managed it and swiftly pulled on the Doctor’s plain black shirt with the red Hydra logo on the breast which the lab coat had been hiding. It was too tight and didn’t fit over his bump, riding up and leaving part of his belly exposed, the trousers he couldn’t fasten, there was just not enough material to fit around his bump for that to be possible, but he was able to secure them by tearing material from the hospital gown, which he hooped through the button hole and wrapped about the button then tied the two ends tight, leaving some excess material to fall free over his exposed groin.
Looking like he was chewing glass, Steve nodded tightly, “Don’t go far,” he said, giving Rogers a warning glare which the other man returned in kind, following Tony to the deserted dining area to speak.
With Steve keeping him engaged in conversation and gently nudging him in the ankle with his foot beneath the table, Tony actually ate the meal, instead of ignoring the food and focussing on his phone and sipping the drinks throughout the dinner.
“Someone must have recognized him.” He sighed, handing Lily to Steve and stepped forward towards Bucky, his hands held palms up to show he wasn’t a threat.
So he wouldn’t feel left out, Peter was put in charge of setting the table, a job he took very seriously and even made sure to put name tags on the plates with the crackers so everyone would know where they were sitting.
When Peter awoke again it was to Zach sitting on his stomach grinning at him and holding up a sketch pad with crayon writing on it.
“Hulk smashed Loki into the floor.” Tony said with a shrug, “You do have a video of that don’t you J?” He asked his AI.
“Of course you can sweetie.” Tony said, mentally planning to enrol Zach in skating classes in the new year. He was enjoying his martial arts classes and had made a couple of friends in the class, another activity would give a chance to make more.
The armour was like Tony’s suits but had a solid core instead of a hollow space for a person to be enveloped in. It was dark red and silver, colours that Jarvis himself had chosen and the face plate, rather than the typical Iron Man mask, was moulded to appear like a human face.
It was around midnight when Tony awoke, half buried beneath Steve’s body. The larger man was snoring against his back and his arms were wrapped tightly about his waist, holding Tony close as if he were afraid that he might slip away.
“Hmm, should have known you’d be the type to go on top Stark.” Natasha mused, “Not the type to get pinned down.”
If anyone could keep The Black Widow and the Mind Raping Witch away from him it was Stark. He knew about the Maximoff creature from the news, knew that the Black Widow was in league with her. After escaping Hydra he was never going back to having his mind taken from him and turned into a puppet for someone’s amusement.
“I’ll just stake out Oscorp’s labs and shit, get proof of him doing illegal experiments and stuff and then take it to Mamma and Dad.”
“Fuck you!” This remarkably came from Tony who had pulled himself out of his state of shock and was now glaring Rogers as if he were the lowest form of pond scum he had the displeasure of seeing before him. “You think Howard was too lenient?” he asked in a mocking tone, “He wasn’t lenient, or easy going, he just didn’t give a flying fuck about me unless it was to parade me in front of the cameras for publicity, the rest of the time he couldn’t have cared less if I was breathing or not, and as for discipline? Do you want to the scars from when he took his belt to me when I was five? Do you want to guess how many stitches I needed after he beat me bloody while he was pissed out of skull and fucked off because he hadn’t been able to find your sorry arse in the arctic?” Tony was shaking with rage now, he didn’t seem to notice or care that this was being recorded, or that everything that was happening would be on the internet within the hour, the only thing he could focus on was the Super Solider before him who had finally pushed him into releasing the hurt and frustration that he’d kept bottled up for so long.
The tension on the jet was rife as Clint pushed the engines as fast as they could go. The phone line was still open but Tony wasn’t responding anymore. Steve had heard shouting in German right after Tony had told him that they’d found him and since then nothing.
“You are a kid!” Tony said but not with malice, “You’re only thirteen Pete, we can’t treat you as an adult because you aren’t an adult.”
“Zach, Stellina, please, I need to speak to you.” Tony said, following Zach into his bedroom, when he didn’t see his Son, he got down onto his belly and peer under the bed where he saw Zach curled up and crying.
“My pleasure,” Steve replied, he glanced over Tony’s shoulder, smiling as Dumm-E brought Tony over a cup of water in his coffee mug.
Peter had news too, which he told Tony in a babble of word vomit and blushing cheeks, after some careful deciphering Tony figured that Peter was going with MJ to the prom on an actual date!
“Alright we need to get him to the jet.” He said, “Steve get Natasha to set up an IV with blood and saline, have it ready to go as soon as we arrive. Have Sam plot a course to the nearest hospital capable of dealing with a major gunshot injury.”
He mentally added making Shieldra a thing to his to do list and took out his phone to looking through his overflowing e-mail box, deleting anything that looked boring, for example anything that came from the members of SI Board of directors. His PR liaison, wanting him to do meet and greets with the rich and thoroughly brain dead. Any aspiring politicians wanting to glad hand, and any e-mails from Pepper’s assistant that wasn’t Pepper herself sending an E-mail practically screaming at him to respond.
The second Tony was through the front door his children were on him, nearly knocking him onto his backside as they crowded him, talking ten to the dozen and clinging onto him like they were afraid he’d disappear.
“Easier said.” Sam said unable to keep from glancing at the camera, he was also sitting rather stiffly and looked very self-conscious. Natasha looked a step away from stabbing the film crew!
Steve watched him go and quickly finished his burger in two bites and wiped his hands on a napkin, “You two behave yourselves for a few minutes.” He said getting to his feet, “No blowing anything up or setting anything on fire.”
Steve snorted, as he located eggs, bacon, flour, and milk. Pancakes and bacon for breakfast, he decided. “A single slice of pizza does not qualify as a meal, Tony,” he said, with practised patience, heaven knows his Tony had never eaten properly unless forced to by others, believing that he could survive on coffee and stubbornness alone.
Ned had been impressed and had enthusiastically told Peter so, where MJ played it cool, refusing to show so much enthusiasm.
Ugh life lessons, Peter didn’t even bother to hide rolling his eyes, “You sound like you a quoting one of those PSA Video’s you did.” He said to Steve with a grin, “You know we get subjected to those things in school, including the sex-ed one, have you any idea how embarrassing it is to have your Dad lecturing your class on why Captain America advocates safe sex and duel consent?”
“I see you have noticed Sir’s change in behaviour.” Jarvis pointed out as he drew Steve out into the corridor so speak quietly while Tony spoke with Zach and Peter, helping them both get on with some school work that had been emailed to them.
Tony sniffed and nodded his head, “We will.” He said, “And both Zach and Peter are as much mine as they are yours, you are their Father in all but blood, and with how much I love Peter I know that blood doesn’t matter at all.”
However she knew that if she did so his suffering would be over too fast and she wanted it to last, she wanted him to be completely broken before she put him out of his misery, although, if there was a God, then Stark’s misery would become eternal as he would be destined for hell.
Rhodey grinned at the interaction, it was always heart warming to see Tony interacting with Lily so easily and the baby adored him as much as she did Steve. Not that she wasn’t friendly with everyone, being the sort of baby who enjoyed cuddles and interacting with grown-ups. Which was all the interaction she had at the moment, which did make Rhodey wonder if maybe Tony and Steve would give her a sibling, if they’d ask Pepper to surrogate like had been done in Steve’s reality.
“Yes, well, Stark’s gone public with the fact his pair of whelps are freaks, had his fucking CEO create a tear-jerker tale in which they are the victims of deranged and sadistic scientists who performed illegal experiments on them.” Norman shrugged, “Whether or not they will be pitied as victims or reviled as freaks is up to public opinion.”
Peter wasn’t used to seeing his aunt Pepper anything less than immaculate, seeing her now shaking, with mascara streaks down her cheeks and dark smudges under eyes was frightening.
Right there, in front of half the worlds press, was his “Twin” declaring himself homosexual as if it were something to be proud of!
“My guy in the chair?” Peter repeated. The knot his stomach was tied in was lessening a little a Ned’s seeming easy acceptance, but he was still worried as he waited for MJ to give her response.
“I need to find a way to contact my Father and let him know of Loki’s escape.” Thor said, “Though with the Bifrost gone, I do not know how I will achieve it.” The Thunderer looked more disheartened than Tony had seen him and he felt he had to try and offer Thor some comfort. Reaching out he patted a large bicep.
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes, “Fine J, I’m head back now.” He shut down the holographs and looked to Steve, “And you thought the war was over!”
Steve snorted, well as an adult he might be sick of fast food but the teen in Pete was still loving it no matter how much he was having.
“Oh yay think?” Sam asked as he swept past Clint and swept up four soldiers took them up to about ten feet and then dropped them back down.
When they finished skating Tony treated everyone to hot chocolate and snacks and they sat to watch some semi-professional skaters on the ice.
Tony admitted, though only to himself, and maybe Rhodey, but he had been really, really drunk at that time, and might have smoked more than one joint. That he was insecure about himself. That he tended to think that the negative things that people said about him were true and focused on them, rather than focussing on the good he did and his qualities.
For seven long days and nights Peter remained unconscious and fighting for his life. Then finally as dawn was breaking on the eighth day his eyes opened and he began to cough and splutter around the tube in his throat.
“Really?” Pepper asked, “Will there be much point? It’s been more than twenty years, I don’t think there’ll be much left to find.”
The raft managed to stay intact for ten minutes then it began to break apart and Steve lifted Zach off it carrying him on his shoulders back to the shore to get dinner ready.
“Just a little longer.” He whispered once he could breathe again, forcing himself to keep going, to find the locker.
“And tell them what?” Tony asked, “We’ve no proof Cap, if we go to the cops, the FBI, or CIA, or hell, even the president himself, it’d be our word against the Undersecretary of the WSC, without unequivocal evidence our accusations would be dismissed as hearsay.”
“No problem, I’m kind of psyched to be helping out Captain America and Iron Man,” He paused, “Although, what exactly am I helped you guys with, its not another invasion of those reptile looking things is it?”
“Yes, god yes, I’ve just never really dated anyone.” Steve said, his cheeks heating with embarrassment, “Before the serum no one wanted to date me, after the serum, well there was the war and I didn’t get time to date, I was either on the road with war bonds sales, or in the field. What down time I did have was spent with the Howlies and while there were… some encounters with Omegas and female Beta’s it wasn’t anything that lasted more than a few nights, if you know what I mean.” To Steve’s relief Rhodey just chuckled and nodded,
“We have to Go to Vienna.” He said to Natasha, who rose an eyebrow, “Bucky is there, we have to save him.”
“Bullshit!” Steve stated, making Tony jump a little at the volume of his voice, “From what you’ve said, Ultron was cause by a combination of things, not you alone. They have no right to treat you in such a way, none at all.”
“So here we go, with a breakfast containing 2000 calories.” Clint said setting up the camera before his plate of pancakes, bacon, sausage, egg, and about an ocean of butter and syrup.
“Yeah, pancakes, want a pancake, Pep, they’re really good.” Tony said, grabbing one and biting into it.
Tony felt a painful lump build in his throat, before he even knew what he was doing he had reached out and placed his hand on Steve’s arm, gently squeezing the impressive bicep, “You’re welcome to stay here, as long as you want,”
“How about that place we went to yesterday?” Steve suggested, “The soup there was excellent.” Tony rolled his eyes,
“Jay, access the news feeds, look for violent crimes or road traffic accidents, hell anything where people have been injured in Washington in the past three hours.”
“I don’t like them!” Zach yelled throwing himself into Tony’s arms and burying his face into his chest, “Make them go away, don’t wanna get eaten by Commodore thing!”
“We should dress Cap up in his old uniform and make him to the song and dance.” Tony mused turning his head the other way.
“We know sweetie.” Steve said patting his shoulder, he cleared his throat, “I think it would be best if you show us these ships Director.”
Steve let out a whimper, he was going to die here, he was going to die of blue balls. Now wouldn’t that make a headline? Captain America dies of blue balls!
At that moment Steve saw red. It didn’t matter that this wasn’t his world, that this wasn’t his Tony, all he could see was A Tony Stark hurt and in danger, and a threat before him, and he reacted on instinct to defend his man, punching Rogers in the face and sending him across the floor.
He was still hurt by Tony’s deceit, they would have to talk about it more, but…..maybe, just maybe a child wasn’t out of the question.
Before Tony even knew it was happening, Steve had him in a bridal hold and was carrying him back to the bed, laying him down and kiss him down into the pillows. “Now, where were we?” He asked, making Tony laugh and gasp as Steve began to kiss his way down his chest and belly, heading for his cock, which he swallowed with a practised ease.
“Are you sure you want to risk having another one?” Steve asked. He and Tony were considering asking Pepper to surrogate for them so they could give Lily a sibling. “Keep her out of trouble is a job and half as it is.”
With his speed he was easily able to catch up with him, chasing him into an alley where he had leaped onto the walls and climbed along them, jumping down in front of the mugger and punched him in the face, breaking his nose and dazing him.
Tony got Zach kitted out in his winter clothing before he allowed him out onto the balcony to go and build some snow men (They would go to central park for the snow ball fights as Tony didn’t think it would be safe on the balcony)
“Maybe whoever shot him tried to kill before too.” One of the junior doctors said as she palpitated the abdomen, “Abdomen is distended, suspected bleed in the upper left quadrant, can we lift him please?”
Happily Zach ran about in the snow seemingly impervious to the biting cold as he set about rolling a ball that grew and grew until it was twice as big as himself! He then called for reinforcements to help get the head put on the snow man because he couldn’t reach that high. Peter helped him to get the head up onto the impressively fat base and made sure it was stable, they then got an old knitted scarf from Bruce to put about the Snowman’s neck and an old beanie from Natasha to put on its head. Steve painted some tennis balls black and cut them in half so they could be used to make the eyes and some buttons down the front of the snow man, he also painted some golf balls to be used to make the mouth. Clint provided a bright orange sock stuffed with silver foil to serve as a nose instead of a carrot, and finally spray painted some scrap metal that he cut down into stick arms which Zach stuck into either side of the snowman completing his body.
It also made Steve think of something else, something he had yet to speak about with Tony, but was also on his mind a lot. Deciding to test the waters he asked Peter his opinion.
“We should.” Natasha agreed, “It is possible that he will reunite with the twins though so we could deal with all three in one fell swoop.”
Tony was aching everywhere, from the top of his head to the tips of his toes he was aching. He let out a groan, blinking open sleep sticky eyes he winced at the bright lights of shield medical which were bearing down upon him.
That Howard had seen him as too weak and too inferior and had tried to fix him. Had experimented on him and nearly killed him.
“Intensive care.” Steve whispered, “We can’t go back in until later today, there is an infection risk.”
“With everything that’s going on right now, having another baby is the last thing we need, the last thing I need, I have to focus on Peter and Zach, not getting pregnant again.”
This would have been more than enough for most parents. A healthy baby boy. But Howard Stark was not most parents.
Not all the news crews were pro homosexuality at least, nor all groups for that matter, several of which had taken to making him one of their figureheads, something that made Rogers flush with pride at being though of as righteous and heroic enough to be made into a figurehead again in this modern era.
“Why are you calling me fuckface? Is it because you want me to fuck your face?” Deadpool asked Tony, having all the self-preservation instincts of a blind lemming. Snarling wordlessly Tony hauled Deadpool closer to the edge and Steve hurried handed Lily to Spiderman who gulped loudly at being given a baby to hold, his eye slits going wide when she slapped his masked face and laughed loudly at him.
Tony was tempted, by God he was tempted. To spend a day just relaxing instead of worrying about Thanos, about dealing with the Ex-Avengers, to simply have some fun instead of working.
“Pietro Maximoff has been enhanced with extreme speed.” Jarvis said, “He moves at something close to the speed of light, the tests he under went could not provide an exact speed, but what the data suggested was well above the speed of sound.”
Once the bath was ready Steve carefully placed Tony into the tub and then climbed in after him, laying down in the water and smiling as Tony came to lay over his chest.
“NO!” Steve lunged forward managing to grab hold of Tony by the shoulders as his body began to fall. The momentum brought Steve down onto the ground, landing on his front hard.
Opening his eyes again Tony looked down at himself, or rather at the sand that was now burying him up to his neck.
And several moments of Tony’s wandering hands resulting in both him and Steve disappearing into their private quarters out of sight of the camera.
“Mushy.” Peter said heading for the bathroom while Zach scrambled after him and demanded he hurry up because he was “Bustin!”
“Alright then.” Steve said lifting Zach up easily and balanced him on his hip, “How about we spend the rest of the day with your Mamma after I give Your Aunt Pepper a call and let her and Uncle Rhodey know you are alright?” Zach nodded, beaming as he was set back down on Tony’s bed and quickly snuggled against Tony’s side while Steve drew his phone out and called Pepper to let her know everything was fine.
“Sir considered it, but figured that Thor could return to Asgard when he wishes and so would not require a safe house in a country safe from extradition.”
“Maybe.” Tony said, “I think or I hope there is something beyond death, what that is I don’t know. Personally I’m drawn to the idea of reincarnation, which can theoretically be proven by science.”
“I hope they arrest that wacko Doctor soon and Osborn.” MJ snarled, “Those two should be thrown in Alcatraz!”
Tony supposed he should see that as a blessing, he wouldn’t be bed bound of wheelchair bound for months on end as a normal person would. But he couldn’t see this as a blessing right now, could only see it for what it was.
The memories came back after a few seconds, all of them, Loki, the Chitauri, the strange latter from his future self.
“I didn’t.” MJ replied, “It’s not my fault that boys are so sensitive over their reproductive organs.” She sniffed, “If you losers had to go through periods you wouldn’t complain about your dicks.”
“Don’t worry baby, I’ll make it up to you tonight.” Steve groaned and tried to focus on walking without a limp.
Pepper was right about the headlines, and the interest that had half the worlds press camped out before Stark towers, screaming questions and snapping pictures as Tony sat beside Steve explaining to the world of how he was a different Steven Rogers and how he had come to be in this universe, following the destruction of his own world.
“I just wish they’d leave you alone.” Steve said scowling at them through the tinted window of the limo as it started to pull away from the car park.
His hands shook as he took off his jeans and underpants to put on his trunks, “Get a grip Stark.” He chided himself, “You are just going into a lake, not diving off a cliff.” That brought back memories of the island and Clint taking him over the side of the cliff.
Bucky looked to Sam, “Why isn’t he in an asylum?” Sam glanced at Deadpool who was actually tweeting,
“Dalek attack!” Peter cried starting up the daleks, making Zach shriek and shut the doors so he could defend the Tardis!
Steve tried to catch Peter as he fell to the ground but his own vision was blurring and he stumbled, trying to reach out for Zach, tried to tell the little boy to run, but it was too late, he was falling to the floor and blackness was swallowing him whole.
Curien, despite his fear glared at Tony, “It wasn’t karma it was Osborn, Stark, he did this to me.” He gestured to his abdomen and leg, “And you did this.” He pointed to his missing arm, “I should sue you for that.”
“But not you?” Rhodey asked, not quite ready to give Sam the benefit of the doubt just yet, Sam shook his head.
“Why is this green?” Clint asked holding up a tube of colour corrector, “Seriously, do women wear green face paint?”
Steve and Tony had tried to rally the forces that were left. The Fantastic four were now down to just Reed and Sue. Luke Cage was still standing, just, as was Vision. They allied with the remained X-Men and threw themselves into the final battle. The one that took Tony from Steve’s side.
“He doesn’t have the legs for tights like Steve does.” Tony said teasing both his husband and Peter.
Tony’s eyes were alight now and as he spoke he gestured with almost frenzied energy, “He wants flowers and parades, monuments to the sky with his name on them….Son of a bitch!”
The patient was identified shortly after the police had arrived at the hospital and he had been brought out of surgery to be placed in ICU as he recovered from his injuries.
The bots rolled into their places and Sam and Thor placed coconuts into their claws, “Get ready, take aim, and fire!”
“It must have been frightening for you.” The Host said, “Terrifying in fact, to be for all sense and purposes alone in an alien world.”
“The bacon cheese burger.” Peter said eagerly, his eyes lighting up at the prospect of greasy salty goodness.
Steve and Bruce having a pancake flipping contest with several pancakes ending up stuck on the ceiling made it onto film, as did on of the pancakes coming unstuck and falling straight down onto Clint’s head!
The sound of repulsors setting down alerted Tony as to what Jarvis was referring to and moments later a hole was blasted through the wall and War Machine or rather Iron Patriot, (Tony still hated the name) was peering in at the three former prisoners.
He ran as hard as he could to reach the hospital, his little legs were shaking and he was panting heavily by the time he reached the doors but he didn’t stop, he made himself keep going to the lift and got into it punching the button for the third floor and sagged against the wall as the lift rose up.
Tony picked Zach up and balanced him on his hip so he could talk to him face to face without killing his back.
Tony nodded, “Have you got a heavy duty hammer? I might be able to beat it out some the dents, at least get it to open up properly so I don’t have to contort myself to get in there.”
“Who are you?” Rogers growled, glaring at Steve, who was still taken aback by the attitude here, not to mention Scarlet Witch. In his world she had been a villain, a terrorist in league with her Brother and Hydra. Tony had said that she was turning over a new leaf in this reality, but the similarities between his Wanda Maximoff and this one, did not convince Steve that she was any different.
“More likely the latter,” Tony said, “Romanoff has a lot of contacts she can utilize at times of need, but when it comes to computers and tech, she isn’t skilled enough to be able to pull something like that off.” He sighed and offered her small smile, “I’m sorry they’re being pains. I never meant for you to get dragged into all this.”
Steve grinned down at the impossibly cute little Pup, “It’s just Steve.” He said wrapping his arms about Zach so he was holding him close as he rose to his feet, “Pancakes then.”
Tony forced a smile and shook his head, “I’m just being an over protective parent.” He lied, avoiding looking into Rhodey’s eyes, instead he took the helmet of the War Machine armour and tossed it at the Colonel, “Why don’t you go and take this for a test run huh, pick up some pizza’s. We’ll make this a movie night.”
“I need to call home too.” Tony said, “See how the boys are doing, and how Jarvis is getting on.” His nose wrinkled, “If I’ve been labelled as a terror suspect Pepper is going to be getting a lot more flack off the media, which she is so going to take out on me.”
“If I snore, groan, or kick in my sleep then I don’t care!” Tony blurted trying to ease the tension with humour.
“It is very good to see you are being so positive Mr Stark.” The Moderator said, “But this cannot be easy for you.”
“You’re worried.” Steve said quietly to Tony, as they shared the bathroom, getting themselves washed and ready for the day along with Lily.
This led to questions about how the team was coping with one of the their own having suffered a permanent injury and how Tony’s boys were coping.
Tony jolted awake gasping and stared up the white, strobe lit ceiling above him. He was in a bed, he was laying in a bed and he was warm, the last thing he remembered was being cold, being in the base in Siberia.
Steve looked back down at him as Tony glanced up and his expression had softened, “We can, but you need to talk to me, we need to have communication between us otherwise things will never work.”
“Okay Harley Keener, I need some things, actually I need a lot of things, and you are going to get them for me.”
Well, technically he did, they were dating, but they hadn’t gone any further than kissing yet. Steve was very much a Gentleman, no hands below the waist, only clean cuddles, no groping under the clothes.
Tony, for once, had put his foot down and not given into her demands, no matter how logical they were, and he had somehow managed to juggle work and caring for Zach.
Peter shrugged, he might know that was true, but right now he felt too bad to see any good in what he had done. He was terrified of what public exposure could mean for him and Zach, and even if social services kept their noses out, their lives would never be the same again. People would treat them differently, possibly with fear, parents might refuse to have their kids in their presence.
“You can have him!” Tony grumbled, “Damn traitor, I am disowning him, you hear me Zach, that’s it, for this treachery you are disowned, cast out, I am putting all your toys on ebay and I will buy a chimpanzee from a zoo to replace you with.”
“OHMYGOD!” Ned yelled jumping to his feet, his food falling to the grass as he watched, stunned, as his normally calm and collected friend tackled Harry Osborn to the ground and started punching him in the face.
Steve had just been coming to Tony's lab when the genius ran straight into him, Steve's firm enhanced body didn't move an inch where Tony toppled backwards and would have gone on the floor had it not been for Steve's quick reflexes grabbing him in time.
“We were all very worried though.” Steve said, giving Tony a tremulous smile and the Billionaire squeezed his hand to let him know that he was alright and wasn’t going anywhere.
He shook his head and sank back in his chair, “How am I meant to speak to the world, to the media when I can barely speak to someone in the street?”
The children’s easy acceptance relaxed the tension and everyone sat and ate the take away Shwarma, all too tired and hungry to care what they were eating that much.
“You two go first.” Bruce ordered Natasha, “We have to do this carefully we can’t risk jostling the injury.”
“Can I help?” Steve asked seeing the way Tony’s hands were shaking with stress and the tension in the lines by his eyes. Before Tony could even reply Steve was moving, “I’ll get the bathroom cleaned up for you,” He said, “You get Zach off to bed and then go and sort yourself out, I’ll take care of this.”
“None that was found.” The paramedic said, “The police have been alerted and officers should be present soon.”
“Oh baby, believe me,” Deadpool purred, “You won’t be sexless for very long, now that I am here. In fact, I’m getting really hungry, I think it’s time we made a sandwich, I’ll take a hot Billionaire between two clean sheets and Captain on the side!”
Tomorrow it would geography, the day after that it would be literature and language, then history and then physics, and then the art. The last Steve would be teaching, he had already taught Zach how to shade with pencils but he was going to be teaching him how to use pastels.
“Oh come on you girl, come out of there it freakin stinks in here.” MJ complained giving the stall and thump with her fist, she glared as a couple of boys came into the toilets to make use of the urinals intimidating them so much that they left to go and use the gym toilets instead.
“He found a freaky lab.” MJ said picking up from where Ned left off, “It was full of genetically spliced animals, and I was downloading info from the servers and Peter was checking out another lab when suddenly we lost all communication.”
He’d quietly padded back to his room those times, cuddling up in bed and wish hard for his Mamma to be happy again, and by morning his Mamma had been all smiles again as if nothing had ever happened.
“Not possible right now, Sergeant, and my arm can wait.” Tony said disconnecting the helmet and taking it to the table, “The tools?” He asked Sam. The Sergeant nodded and headed off to get what Tony had asked for.
Zach scowled at her shoving his ice cream away, "Lies." He said sticking out his bottom lip in a pout, "If he were fine, they would be here, they'd take me to the hospital to see Pete."
“There are other worlds Steve,” Reed said, “Ones you can go to, in fact there is one that his practically a mirror to ours. You can warn them of what’s coming, of Thanos. Prevent this happening in that world, and give Lily a chance to grow up,”
Wong and Strange held off Ebony Maw while Tony and Steve fought with Glaive, counting down the minutes until Rhodey fired the weapon vaporizing the ship that they had come in.
Pepper had kept the news quiet for as long as she could, but by the fifth day the news broke and she was left handling the fallout as the paparazzi descended on the hospital, Stark Industries, and everywhere they thought they might be able to get a story.
Steve braced himself, preparing for the end, when Reed dragged him into his lab, talking ten to the dozen as he pulled Steve along, babbling about a portal and somewhere for Steve to go.
Inside the base Strucker ordered a full evacuation of his scientists, ordering them to take everything they had and to get of Sokovia while he sent the soldiers to fight the Avengers, and to protect himself and his best scientists as they made their flight down into the city.
“Great!” Clint cheered as if they weren’t discussing his murder, “See, you two are already bonding, soon you’ll be having sleep overs, and pillow fights, dibs on watching naked pillow fights!” He was too slow to dodge Natasha’s kick and the pillow Tony threw at him bounced off his head.
