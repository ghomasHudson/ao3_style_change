“Gags?” John asked.
Mycroft paused, momentary panic setting in as one thought coursed through his head. Where will I put all of this?
“What’d you bring?” Alice asked as she trailed them into the kitchen.
“He was shot in the thigh,” she replied, straightening his legs and undoing the jacket of Mycroft’s tac suit.
“And her father is a drunk.”
“Apparition,” John responded. “Essentially teleportation, I suppose.”
“Of course.” Mycroft thought for a minute more, but couldn’t bear sitting at home waiting to hear news. “I’m coming. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes.”
“What was that?” a voice sounded from Sherlock’s side. Sherlock ran his eyes up and down the new-comer, soaking in all the information found on the blond-haired boy.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but moved to the other side of Jackie. The rest of the family trooped in, each carrying a bowl or platter with food on it. They assembled in their seats around the table, Alice beside Sherlock, Charlie beside her at the other end of the table, and John and an empty seat on the other side of the table. Greg came in a moment later, putting down the ham and taking his seat.
John had received a text message last night from Mycroft that read “8:00 a.m. Dr. Clark Witter. Wizard and PhD.”
“Ah. And how was school this week?”
“You were about to abduct a baby, and you want to talk to me about normal?”
Liz bit her bottom lip, looking intensely at John. Sherlock came around so he was facing her as well, kneeling down beside John.
“So you think she-“ Sherlock looked over to the body now lying prone on the floor.
Thank you all so much for reading. I think this will be the last chapter, but as you can see this is now part of a series that will expand! Also, my keyboard has been a bit not good and sometimes keys don't work when I hit them so I tried to catch all of them, but there may be some missing letters. Again,if there's anything you want to see, please let me know. Special shout out to Lily, who gave me the idea for this chapter.
“Oh, Liz, it’s okay,” John soothed, reaching down to pick her up from Sherlock’s arms. “I think it’s time we went home.”
“Name?”
“How would you feel about me trying the crop?”
“What can we help you with?” John put his arm protectively around Liz’s shoulders.
“I know,” Greg replied smiling. “Enjoy it while you can.”
“I’m not going to be a kept man,” Greg hissed, pulling closer to Mycroft. “We’re sharing the rent equally.”
“Of course,” Sherlock dove into the nappy bag, eager to show John that he was serious about his commitment. He pulled out the mat and spread it out on the kitchen table, taking out a nappy and wipes, as well as cream.
“How many different shades of pink can one baby produce?” Mycroft asked, exasperated.
Sherlock huffed and slumped his shoulders, slipping into a pout.
“But wouldn’t it feel so much better to be out of your wet clothes?” John asked.
“Red. We have that in common.” John beamed at Sherlock. “Favourite animal?”
“Crime scene, looks like,” Sherlock answered. “Let’s go take a look.”
“Wrap your arms around my neck. There’s a good lad.” Sherlock’s breath slid out shakily from between his lips at the praise. When he was securely attached, John slid his hands under Sherlock knees and scooped him up. John was eminently grateful that Sherlock’s room was on the same level as the sitting room, so it took him only a few moments to get Sherlock into his room. Putting him down on the bed, John sat him on the side of the bed and pulled back the blankets, sliding Sherlock underneath them and tucking the blankets around him. “Sherlock? I’m gonna go now.” John brushed an errant curl off of Sherlock’s forehead.
“Morning,” John greeted softly.
"Copy that, sir." Huffing in frustration at the mission gone awry, Mycroft tucked his gun away and hurried over to the filing cabinet he had spotted by the workbench and opened the middle drawer, having deduced where the information he sought was located. Quickly pulling it out, he folded it and tucked it into its designated pocket on the outside of his upper right forearm. Turning back to the door, he caught sight of the baby on the workbench, face red as her body wracked with sobs.
“Didn’t mean to,” she whispered, seeming to shrink into herself.
“Just playing with blocks,” Greg said. “We’ve discovered knocking down blocks. Look!” Greg quickly piled blocks in front of Jackie and, without hesitating, she reached over and knocked them down. She proceeded to laugh madly, prompting Greg and Mycroft to join in.
“I can’t decide if I feel better or worse that she uses an owl to communicate with her friend,” Sherlock said thoughtfully, watching her retreat upstairs. “On the one hand, it keeps her off the internet and out of harm from online predators but on the other hand, she’s using one of the most outdated means of communication.” Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
“Would you be willing to eat something now?”
Sherlock considered. On the one hand, John was the most bearable dom he had met so far and, if he was being perfectly honest with himself, Sherlock was interested. This dom, this human being, was an enigma; at the same time caring, compassionate, and a thrill-seeker.
Mycroft came rushing into the kitchen. “We have to go right now,” he said, pausing in the doorway before rushing through to the sitting room. Greg stood and followed Mycroft through to the other room.
“John, it’s Sherlock, I’m okay. We’re at your house. We’re both safe. You’re having a nightmare. Please wake up.”
Sherlock looked abashed. “No, and I truly am sorry for that.” He ducked his head, tapping his forehead gently against John’s. John could see there was true shame in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Weirdo,” she spat, stalking off.
Just wanted to let those who are subscribed to this story know that I've made it a series and posted a second story in this universe. Enjoy! :D
“Probably not a bad idea,” John agreed. He stood to fetch his laptop from the desk. When he returned, he noticed that Liz’s eyes were half open.
“Last night. Well, this morning to be exact.”
Greg hesitated for a moment. As much as sleep seemed like a good idea, he didn’t think he’d be able to sleep for the next year, as keyed up as he was. He also had a sudden urge to protect Mycroft and Jackie at whatever cost.
The silence in the flat was broken only by Liz’s small sniffles as she wiped at her tear-stained cheeks.
“Right, I’ll see what I can do,” John said, and with a last nod, he slipped out the door and into the waiting room.
“Is that all?” Greg felt himself go shrill. “I’m not your slave.”
“Hello Mycroft. What brings you here today?”
“About half an hour. They collected evidence around the room but no one has approached the body yet.”
“Yes mother.” By this time they had all finished their dinner.
“Sherlock, grab my arm and hold on tight, yeah?”
“Vegetables are boring,” Sherlock shrugged. John decided not to comment, taking another sip of his cocoa instead. “Washroom,” Sherlock grunted a few minutes later, leaning forward to put his mug on the low table. He moved to shift Liz off his lap, and she dropped her mug in order to wrap her hands in Sherlock’s shirt. The mug fell to the ground with a shatter and a crash, the rest of her cocoa spilling out. They all stared at the mug on the ground for a moment before Liz’s lower lip stuck out and she scrambled away from Sherlock and into the corner of the sofa.
“Bullshit.”
“Why?”
“And where’s David today?” David was his ex, Sarah’s, new husband.
“Probably another few days, a week at most.”
“Yes, I fed her some solids today, that seems to have perked her up a bit.”
"Alright," the woman said, grabbing the baby around the waist and resting her on one hip. The child was still crying, big tears rolling down her already soaked face.
“Goo!” she responded, smiling.
“What a silly man,” Mycroft murmured to Jackie. “Now, what have we here?” he picked up the figure of the cow. “Can you say cow?” he said, pointing the cow at Jackie. “Come on, cow.” Although Jackie was becoming more vocal, there weren’t many words past no and da that she had mastered, and Mycroft was starting to worry that she was falling behind developmentally. Some of the parenting books said that babies could start talking as early as six months and, although he hadn’t known her at six months, Mycroft had a suspicion that she hadn’t been talked to much wherever she had been. He tried to make up for that neglect by speaking to her as often as he could. Other books said that she could be starting her first words at 11 months, which placated him somewhat.
“Indeed,” Mycroft answered, thumbs tapping away at the cell phone he had pulled out of his pocket.
“Hello, you two,” Greg greeted as Mycroft let him into the apartment.
“Whiskey, neat,” he said to the bartender.
“Yes, she’s in a particularly good mood today.”
“Alright, my beautiful man then.”
“We’re okay, everything’s okay, Daddy will protect you,” he murmured, pressing his lips against her head. She quieted quickly under the attention, pushing at Greg’s chest so she could look at him.
"You have no idea," he sighed, a chuckle escaping at the end. "I've only got a graze on my side, but little Jaclynn seems to be running a fever of some sort."
“Okapi and Irish Setter. You?”
When he had finished, Mycroft knelt before Greg. “I’m going to take the clamps off now,” he warned before grabbing them between his fingers and pulling them quickly off. Then, he grabbed Greg by the elbows and hauled him up, pulling him onto the sofa and wrapping him tightly in his arms. “You’re forgiven Greg, you did so well. You are so strong and I am so lucky to have you.” Mycroft held Gregory close as tears streamed slowly out of his closed eyes. Greg didn’t weep this time, just sat as tears washed out of his eyes and down his face. When they cleared Greg pulled slightly away, sitting back on the sofa but allowing Mycroft’s arms to stay wrapped around him.
“I’m sure you are.” She turned back towards the shelves. “So we’ve got these three models, I would recommend this one because it is adjustable and can be turned into a booster car seat as she gets older.” She was pointing at a vibrant red and black model that was mid-sized compared to the others.
“What’s your favourite color?” Sherlock interrupted.
“Alright. Maybe I’ll see you later.” Without waiting for a response, the boy walked away.
“I love the stars,” John said quietly after a moment, gently breaking the silence. Sherlock looked over at him.
“Yeah, I think you’re starting to slip into subspace.”
“John, come look.” John crouched down next to Sherlock. “Clearly bled out, shot twice in the chest. What can you observe?”
“You would be surprised.” Greg paused. “Do you want me to come over?”
Liz looked down, playing with the bits of scrambled egg left on her plate.
“Yes.”
“I know that,” Greg growled, frustrated. “But it won’t stop, Mycroft. Make it stop. Please.” Fisting Mycroft’s shirt, Greg burrowed his face into Mycroft’s chest.
“Witches and wizards get their wands when they turn eleven, right before they go to Hogwarts. That’s the school of witchcraft and wizardry,” Rose said from behind them.
John was floored by the wall of crying he was hit with. It seemed as if every child there was in tears, and some of the teachers as well.
“Brilliant,” he said handing them to Jackie. She grabbed them, jingling them happily. “Yes, that’s fun,” he cooed.
“I’m not done!” Greg shouted. “You wouldn’t know what Marcia said because you were unconscious, Mycroft! And sure, she did say you were okay, but that means shite when you haven’t woken up in hours. Things can go downhill quickly, as I’m sure you know, so don’t you ‘Marcia said’ me.” Greg took a deep breath and let it out. He looked down at Jackie, who had been woken by his shouting but who had miraculously stayed silent. “Sorry you had to see that, Jackie,” he said, gentler than moments before. He wrapped an arm around Jackie’s middle, keeping her steady.
Greg’s felt his back go up. “I’ve been pushing and moving everything all day and I’m tired and you can never make up your mind and I don’t want to and I’m tired.” He was despairingly close to tears.
“Yes, I believe that one will do nicely. We’ll take one of those,” Mycroft said. “And carriers?”
“I suppose,” Sherlock allowed. John looked back towards the sky.
The action starts now, friends.
Mycroft let the next fall. “Two, thank you,” Greg said.
“Everything is going well between us,” Greg responded easily. “Right Mycroft?”
“Here,” came a gentle murmur from beside him, and the bottle of scotch that he had been absently clutching was pried from his hand. A cool glass was pressed into his hand. “Take sips.”
“Have you found the child?”
“Tea?” Sherlock asked once he realized they would be there for a while.
“Thank you,” she whispered, holding it out so that Sherlock could secure it around her neck. He did, careful not to get it tangled in her hair. When it laid on her chest, she rested her hand over it.
“Putting aside how unhealthy that sounds, wouldn’t you want to do what makes me happy? Even if that means never seeing me again?”
“No, generally people tell me to piss off.”
When they pulled up to Bart’s, Mycroft exited the car, grabbing the diaper bag on his way. He hurried into the hospital; when he reached the front desk, he greeted the woman behind the desk with a “Holmes, Sherlock. What room?”
“I’ll give you a ride back to the station since Constable Peters took Horath back to NSY.”
“Promised by who?”
“Would you like to try something different, then?”
Sherlock stared at his brother’s upside down figure. “With John of course. Who else?”
“Hold on, I think there’s a list of different kinds of service down near the bottom… Ah yes, here we go. So, serving as art.”
They found themselves, on that Tuesday morning, standing in front of a brightly coloured building, Liz gripping onto each of their hands.
“Did you at least get the perp?” This was directed at Lestrade.
“You did?” Sherlock asked, frowning.
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s warm lower back, rubbing lightly as he reared back and let the paddle land on Sherlock’s ass. Sherlock rocked forward with the impact and moaned low in his throat at the deep ache that took a moment to sink into his skin. John hit him another two times with the paddle before pausing.
John comes over to give Jackie her pokes, and Mycroft has a tough time seeing her cry.
“Sometimes, yes,” John agreed. They sat in silence for a moment, Liz sucking back tears. “I think cocoa is in order,” John said after a moment. “Sherlock, why don’t we move the both of you up here and I’ll get us all some cocoa.”
“Whatever, bastard,” the man glared at him before stalking away.
*******
Mycroft paused for a moment before conceding. “That may be best. My mind, much as I hate to admit it, is apparently not quite working at it’s normal capacity.”
“Good choice, that one is quite cute,” the saleswoman said. “I’ll just ring these up for you, shall I?”
“Sure,” one of them answered.
“Still, I don’t want kids rooting around in the fireplace, on or off.”
“Okay, just give me a second,” Greg said, crawling over the bed and sitting himself beside Mycroft. “Put your arm around my shoulder.”
“What did you do with your Mummy during the days? Is there anything fun you like to do?”
“If you’re hungry. I should feed Jackie, at any rate.”
“So where are we going?” John asked.
“Yes, you keep playing,” John appeased. “I’m going to go get your pajamas. I’ll be back in a tick. You’ll be alright for a few minutes?”
“Hello John. Mrs. Hudson let you in, I assume?”
“Why is it you like serving so much?” John asked, putting his pen down and running his hand through Sherlock’s hair beside him.
Greg let out a bark of laughter. “An ambassador? And they buy that?”
“I believe so,” Mycroft said, pulling out his phone. “And the car has arrived just in time.” Mycroft led the way to his room and, pushing a bookcase aside, revealed a hidden door.
“Good morning, sleepy,” Greg said when he turned and noticed Mycroft watching him. “I heard her crying and figured it would be alright if I came in and took care of her.”
“I think so, yeah. The reason it has more effect on you, spanking that is, is because when I do it you’re being punished, and need the emotional release, yeah?”
“Alright, here we go.” John took both Sherlock’s hands, lifting so that he was standing. Then, he took the tape off the nappy and removed it, throwing it in the garbage. “Climb in,” John prompted, urging Sherlock into the bath and helping him lower himself. When Sherlock was happily seated in the water, John dumped the toys into the bath. Sherlock scrambled to grab as many mermaids as he could, splashing and making them swim in the water. John grinned at his boy, who was finally happy. John wet a flannel, running it efficiently over Sherlock’s muddy legs and feet. He worked his way up towards Sherlock’s crotch, taking extra care to wipe any excess urine off his thighs. He continued over Sherlock’s chest and back, not too worried about thoroughly cleaning him. He let the water roll of Sherlock’s back, watching the streams trickle down his spine. Sherlock wiggled at the sensation, glaring at John.
“No!” Mycroft said, reaching towards Greg. “No, I… just, it’s a lot.”
A few minutes later Mycroft cleared his throat. “I am done,” he announced.
“Alright, so we’ve agreed on four hours of sleep and two meals a day,” John said decisively. Sherlock sighed but acquiesced. He knew John was only being this stubborn because he cared about his health. “And thank you for taking this seriously, Sherlock. It means a lot to me.”
“Forced masturbation, three point five.”
“I have something important I need to tell you. All of you.” John beckoned the other two men over. Greg had dismissed the rest of his people a few minutes earlier, so it was only the four of them in the flat. “I… I don’t think you need to look for whoever did this.”
“Can you say hi?”
“Why not, it will make it easier to avoid all the oppressive doms in here,” Sherlock sighed. Dropping their glasses on one of the many tables scattered about, they exited through a set of giant doors and onto the terrace lit by twinkling fairy lights.
John walked to the bed, grabbing one of Sherlock’s arms and trying to use it to manoeuver Sherlock off the bed. Sherlock resisted, tugging on his arm and whining.
“Hey Rose, it’s been a while since I’ve been. Can you show us where the children’s books are?”
“Hey Jackie, who’s that?” Greg asked, pointing at Mycroft. Jackie turned her head quickly, following Greg’s finger.
Anthea nodded once more before quietly letting herself out of the flat. Mycroft watched her go before going back to his bedroom, taking Jackie with him and placing her once more on the bed before quickly getting changed into a suit, foregoing the tie. Picking Jackie up once more, Mycroft wrapped her in the muslin, folding the side with the spittle facing out. “We’re going shopping, just for you,” Mycroft whispered as he made his way to the kitchen. Laying her on the table, Mycroft made himself a travel mug of coffee to take along with them. When it was ready, Mycroft picked up Jackie and propped her on his uninjured side, keeping the muslin draped loosely around her. It was an unusually warm summer, so Mycroft wasn’t worried about Jackie getting cold. She was still sniffling and snot was occasionally dripping out of her nose, so Mycroft made sure to tuck a few tissues into his pockets before leaving the flat. The door locked automatically behind him and he quickly got into the elevator and then into the car waiting for him.
“I could ask you the same,” Mycroft said by way of response.
“Do they know that it’s a safe house?”
“About four months,” Greg said, smiling as Mycroft concentrated on Jackie.
“Sounds good to me.”
“Nope. Now, I propose a required five hours of sleep every night and at least two meals and one snack a day.”
“It doesn’t go bad,” Mycroft said by way of explanation.
“I’ve just been appointed Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, actually. You’re still at St. Mungo’s?”
“I will.”
“I’m John,” the boy said, holding out his hand. “John Watson.”
“Have you gotten to use the saline yet?” John asked after a few minutes of silence.
“That will work just fine.” Greg held his had out for it. As the handkerchief and syringe passed from one hand to another, their fingers lingered. “Right. So it’s pretty easy, all you do is depress the bulb part, insert the syringe into the nostril, and then release the bulb, allowing it to fill up with mucous. Once it’s full, just squeeze the mucous onto the handkerchief.” He demonstrated as he explained, squeezing the light green mucous onto the handkerchief. “That part always grosses me out,” he admitted with a low chuckle.
The brothers didn’t talk during the car ride, both lost in thought and trying their best not to fidget. When they finally pulled up to the building, Sherlock reflexively let Mycroft get out first before following. They entered the building and were met by the sight of other young adults crowded into a room, similar to the last time. This time, however, there were less of them, around one hundred and twenty where last time there was two hundred.
“Hello there!” a perky, middle aged woman called from the register. She had grey-blonde hair done up in a high tower and light wrinkle lines around her eyes and mouth. “Can I help you gentlemen?”
“Oh. Yes, I suppose that was somewhat admirable.” Sherlock sat in silence for a second. “So. You’re finding a new flat? With Gregory?” Sherlock looked at Mycroft out of the corner of his eyes and could feel Mycroft’s boring holes into the top of his head.
“Yes, my love, Sherlock will take you to the zoo”.
“I know, but we were both enjoying ourselves so I just kept going.”
“Sherlock….I don’t know what to say. Other than I love you.”
“Of course. We actually finished the story you two had been reading.”
"Do you have the movie on DVD, Rosie? Or is it online?"
“Rosie, you never fail to amaze me. You have seemed to inherited your father’s selflessness.”
The rest of the afternoon was rather uneventful. The two finished watching the movie, but by the end of it Rosie had fallen asleep. All of that dancing must have worn her out. Sherlock decided to just let her nap, even if it meant sitting in an incredibly uncomfortable position. As he sat there, he went to his mind palace in an attempt to solve the latest case Lestrade had left with him. However, in a matter of minutes Sherlock too found himself drifting off. Sherlock never took naps. He barely slept at night, the idea of wasting precious daytime dreaming was preposterous! But, today was different. With Rosie, he wasn’t just a consulting detective...he was a father, and father’s can take naps.
“I was only kidding, Sherlock. You don’t have t-”
Although Sherlock could not see it, his words had created a grin on John’s face. John had always hoped that Sherlock would care for Rosie as a father, but he never expected him to. Sherlock had trouble letting others in and John didn’t want to press his luck. But hearing him speak like this made HIS heart light.
The curious pair left the flat and proceeded to get into a cab. The entire ride Rosie was telling Sherlock about all of the different animals that she wanted to see. At first Sherlock was overwhelmed by her sheer excitement. Normally it was John taking her on day trips. Come to think of it, Sherlock couldn’t think of a time he had ever been with Rosie outside of 221B or picking her up from the bus stop.
“Oookaayyy. Can I pick out my outfit? I know Daddy said he left me some, but I don’t like what he picked.”
Over the course of the day Sherlock and Rosie visited nearly every exhibit. Rosie, like Sherlock, read every sign (to the best of her ability of course) and showed off her animal fact knowledge to every employee should spoke with. When visiting the tigers, Rosie told the zoo volunteer that tigers were the biggest animals in the cat family. The young worker was wonderful with Rosie and told Sherlock that he should be very proud of his daughter.
“Sure Rosie, if you can set it up we can.”
John nearly spit out the sip of coffee he had just taken. “Wha...what? What did you just say?”
John rolls his eyes at Sherlock, who ignores his displeasure. “Rosie, sweetie, you don’t have to answer Sherlock’s riddle.”
“I’ve been practicing really hard! Come watch, come watch”. Rosie basically dragged him into the room, for such a tiny girl she really was quite strong. Sherlock took a seat along the mirrors next to the other parents. The teacher thanked the parents for coming and told them that they should be very proud of their daughters and sons for their hard work! She then turned on the music and the dance began.
Henry raised his eyebrows in surprise, “Well then! This will stay between us” he said with a wide smile. “What would you like, dear? Moose tracks in a cone like aways?”
This was the first time Sherlock had heard this. “Oh really? What happened to being a police detective?” Sherlock teased.
“I love it honey! Let’s put it right up here on the refrigerator”, John says as he takes the drawing from Sherlock. “I want to be able to see it every time I come home.”
Because it was so late, the two decided on brunch. Sherlock whipped up French toast, bacon, and omelets and Rosie made fruit salad and set the table. For such a young girl, she was quite helpful in the kitchen. Perhaps one day she would be a chef.
“Okay, Rosie! I am just finishing up! I will be right down.”
Just as the two plopped down on the couch in exhaustion, they heard the door begin to open. It was John!
“Is THAT what I smell?! I thought it was just my imagination! And look at the house! Everything is immaculate! Gee, I should leave more often!” he teased.
“No, no John. I couldn’t sleep. Rosie is in bed though.”
John most certainly did not mention this. Well...at least. If he had, Sherlock wasn’t paying attention at the time. Dropping Rosie off for dance class was one thing, attending part of her class was another. He was a consulting detective! What would people think?
Rosie was twirling and pirouetting and swaying along to the music. She was smiling, but Sherlock could see the determination in her eyes. At the end of the song, the class bowed and Sherlock applauded as loud as he could. Rosie came running over to him and tackled him in a bear hug.
“John…? Are you awake? Was it a nightmare?”
Sherlock tried not to hide his relief, macaroni was something he felt confident that he could master. “Yes Rosie, I’ll make some right now. Do you want to color? Or just rest?”
“That’s what I was trying to tell you,” Sherlock mutters. “Look at what Rosie made us!” he says, a wide smile breaking across his face as he holds up a drawing.
“Oh Sherlock. It’s only for two nights. I’ll be home soon, okay?”
“Of course I came, Rosie. I promised!”
“Sherlock! I was about to get on a train back home! Are you okay? How is Rosie? Do I need to come home?”
The rest of the morning was a whirlwind. John went upstairs to finish packing. As he was folding his clothes he found himself smiling uncontrollably. He simply just could not stop thinking of Sherlock. His hair, his lips, his eyes. Once his suitcase was full, he lugged it downstairs. For the second time that morning, Sherlock surprised him. As he got to the kitchen his nose was filled with the delicious scent of pancakes.
Rosie smiled and giggled.
As the two sat down to eat Sherlock asked Rosie about school. He realized that although she often spoke of her day with John, he hadn’t really asked her about how she was faring. At the mention of school, Rosie began to speak rapidly of art projects, songs she learned in music class, and how she gets to be the helper of the week starting on Monday. Although at first it was difficult to keep up with everything she was saying, just hearing her so excited made Sherlock smile. It was like when she was talking about dance. Rosie being happy gave him a feeling he had never had before. It felt like a mixture of pride and joy. He made a note to ask John about it, it must be a parent thing.
“Yes, my little bumblebee. Here you go.”
“It’s okay, love. I fell asleep too. I just woke up a little bit ago when your Daddy called. He will be home tomorrow by dinner time.”
“Oh quit it, John. I am just trying to make Rosie happy.”
“Sherlock! Sherlock! You came!”
“John, John, calm down. Please, I can’t really hear you. Rosie and I are just leaving the zoo. Everything is fine. I didn’t realize I had my phone on silent, I meant to turn it back on after otter show.”
“Chocolate?”
“Bumblebee! You were amazing! How did you learn to dance so well?”
Sherlock attends Rosie's dance class!
“SO good! Sorry, I fell asleep so early last night, you didn’t get to read much, huh.”
Rosie beckoned from the second floor, “Sherlock! Will you read me a story?”
“Can I please have some syrup Sherlock?” Rosie corrects.
The thought of John buying a sparkly dance outfit caused Sherlock to chuckle to himself. “Did he? Well your Daddy has very good taste! You look very nice, bumblebee. Put on your jacket, there is a cab waiting for us outside.”
“Daddy...?” Rosie inquires.
Sherlock wasn’t a fan of movies, let alone ones created for children. But the look on Rosie’s face made it hard to say no.
“I love you too.”
“Yes! Will you come see us practice at the end? Daddy always comes for the last 10 minutes.”
“I love you too, Rosie.”
After a wonderful family breakfast, John stands up and heads for the door. “Now Sherlock, I have laid out outfits for Rosie. I labeled them by day. Her pajamas are there too. Read her a story before bed, a children’s story. Don’t forget, she has her dance class tomorrow morning at 11. I will have my phone have with me, please call me if you need me. Are you sure this is okay? It’s not too late to can--”
“I did know that Rosie! Did you know that tigers are the largest animal of the cat family?” For once, outside of a police case Sherlock’s abundance of random information proved helpful. He and Rosie continued to exchange animal facts and he found himself enjoying the cab ride tremendously.
“Shall we go home, love? You can change and then we can do whatever you like.”
“Hello, Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective” he mumbled, still sleepy.
“....John…?”
“I know, love. Please don’t worry. We had fun today, didn’t we Rosie? Actually while you’re at it John, could you text me your recipe for shepherd’s pie?”
“Oh, calm down John. You haven’t heard my riddle yet! Okay, Rosie. If you get this right, we can go to the zoo. What do dogs and trees have in common? Think hard now Rosie, I know you can figure it out”.
“John, I think they owe me. A day off a week isn’t too much to ask for.”
Surprised, John chuckles and leans back down to give Sherlock a peck on the cheek. This whole kissing thing is still really new too. Sherlock has been amazing though. He’s never pressured John and has supported him through everything. Maybe Sherlock is capable of taking care of Rosie for a few days. I mean, he’s gotten much better at remembering to pick her up from the bus stop in the afternoons. And he’s finally convinced him not to hide pieces of evidence in her lunchbox to encourage deductive reasoning skills.
“I am catching the 4 o’clock train tomorrow, I will be home soon. I hope you know that I am expecting dinner to be on the table when I arrive” he teases.
Sherlock awoke to the sound of his alarm. He had set it extra early so that he had time to review that case for Lestrade before Rosie got up. As he sipped his cup of coffee, he paged through the notes. Photos of evidence, autopsy results, the usual. Suddenly, he heard a noise upstairs. He looked at the clock, it was only 8:30. They had about 2 hours before Rosie’s class. After a few moments a sleepy Rosie trudged down the stairs. Like her father, she took a while to truly wake up in the morning.
“Um….well. You don’t like to get dirty. So, a cup?”
“Say hi to Rosie for me. I will see you soon, I love you.”
Defeated, Sherlock puts on a smile and kisses Rosie on the head. “Yes, Rosie. We can go to the zoo….but only if you solve my riddle first.”
“Oh. John, I have to go. Our little bumblebee just woke up. Be safe tomorrow. Okay?”
“Yes please, Henry! Sherlock what will you get?”
“I know you’re lying,” Sherlock murmurs pulling John closer to him.
As he cleared the dishes, Rosie trotted up the steps to get ready for bed. “Don’t forget to brush your teeth!” Sherlock called from the kitchen. When did he become a father figure? Was it this weekend? Or had he slowly been transformed since Rosie came into his life? As much as Sherlock tried to figure out what had happened, he couldn’t. For once, he was stumped.
John startled awake, he tried to sit up but found that he was pinned underneath Sherlock’s arm. In his dream he had been reliving the days of Moriarity, however this time, rather than being used as bait for Sherlock, Rosie had been taken. John hadn’t been having nightmares, now that he was sleeping with Sherlock...but when he did, they felt like reality. His heart was pounding out of his chest and he was still trying to catch his breath. He looked to the clock on the bedside table and read 4:36 am, he still had 2 hours left to sleep. Trying to calm down, John looked at the man sleeping next to him. By day, Sherlock was always put together. Witty, intelligent, and pristine. But by night, his curls were a mess, he drooled in his sleep, and he had a history of hogging the blankets. Although John liked to tease Sherlock about this, he honestly found it rather charming. When Sherlock was asleep, all of his walls came crashing down. He was completely and utterly vulnerable, and John was proud that he was allowed to see behind the facade.
To his surprise, he didn’t find Sherlock alone. Rosie was sitting on his lap, smiling and absently playing with his curls. “Oh! Hi honey! How was your day at school? Did you have fun? What did you learn? Are you making new friends”, John asks as he scoops Rosie into his arms for a bear hug.
Sherlock arrived at the studio and awkwardly walked in. Thankfully, there was a secretary at the desk who assumed that he was there to pick up his daughter. She told him that parents would be allowed to watch the final routine in a few minutes and pointed to a chair that he could sit in while he waited. Sherlock, being, well, Sherlock, sat and tried to not to let on that he was incredibly uncomfortable. A few minutes felt more like a few hours. Thankfully, the door to the dance room opened and Rosie ran into the waiting room to Sherlock.
Before John can even finish his sentence Rosie is already bouncing up and down with excitement, clinging to Sherlock. “Yes! Yes! Yes! He can take me to the zoo!”, Rosie gushes.
“I wouldn’t miss it for anything! Not even a case.”
The rest of the evening was quiet. Rosie had some homework to work on and Sherlock spent some time updating his website. Although John was the blogger, he felt obligated to keep up with his own site too.
After he put Rosie to bed, Sherlock decided the play the violin because he couldn’t sleep. For years Sherlock suffered from insomnia. He didn’t mind it though, his mind was constantly buzzing with cases and he couldn’t solve murders in his sleep. But after meeting John things began to change. He began to go to sleep earlier (mainly because John made a rule that he couldn’t play after 9:00pm) and would even sleep in sometimes on the weekends. Within the last year or so though, Sherlock’s sleep schedule became even more regular. He would never admit it, but going to bed each night next to John was his favourite part of most days. When he couldn’t sleep John would stay up with him. Playing with this hair, rocking him to sleep, and holding him in his arms. Sherlock was playing a melancholy melody. He missed John more than anything and was not looking forward to two lonely nights. As if John could sense his feelings, Sherlock’s phone began to buzz: it was John.
“Oh yay! What are we having for dinner tonight?”
“Maybe, love. How about in a little while? Since we just went.”
“Sure, Rosie. For a little while.”
“Ohh...kay”, John says, trying to convince himself that he wasn’t about to make a colossal mistake. “I guess I will finishing packing then. I’ll head out first thing tomorrow.”
“I didn’t even know he knew how to make these! I don’t think I’ve ever seen him cook before, my lovebug.”
At the zoo, Sherlock’s first task was buying their tickets. Thankfully the girl at the ticketbooth took pity on the overwhelmed man. She gave him a detailed map, schedule of events, and wished him and his daughter a lovely afternoon. Regarding the last comment, Sherlock awkwardly mumbled that she wasn’t his daughter and quickly left before the girl could reply. In retrospect, his reply was perhaps not the best idea. The last thing he needed was to be painted as a creep.
As they walked, Sherlock found himself replaying the first time he visited the shop. It was with John, of course. After a particularly gruesome case John had mentioned getting some ice cream in an effort to cheer themselves up, despite it being only 4 pm. Apparently John used to go there as a child and was appalled that Sherlock had never been despite living only a street away. John chose his favourite, mint chocolate chip, and Sherlock had gone with classic chocolate. As John was eating though, a bit of ice cream stuck to his top lip. It looked like a little mustache and Sherlock wasn’t sure how he should go about telling him. At this point they weren’t a couple. There was some weird tension, but John was always going on dates with women and this utterly confused the detective. Sherlock eventually decided to just point to the ice cream on John’s face, but his timing was horribly off. John had leaned forward to pick up the trash and stand up and Sherlock ended up awkwardly brushing his lip. He tried to play it off, but he was embarrassed beyond belief. John assured him there was nothing to be worried about, he told Sherlock he was overreacting repeatedly to no avail. Even though it really was just a mistake, that simple gesture changed everything. Though it took weeks for John to admit it, he had found Sherlock’s touch electrifying.
As Rosie took out her crayons and construction paper, Sherlock perused the pantry in hopes of finding a box of macaroni. After searching every shelf, he finally found a single box shoved in the back. Elated, he took the box and put a pot of water on the stove. As he waited for the water to boil he began going through the latest case that Lestrade had left with him. A father of two mysteriously disappeared while on a camping trip. Sherlock suspected foul play.
He smiled and replied, “Thank YOU for today.”
Rosie sat on the couch and Sherlock unsure whether to sit next to her or to sit in John's chair. He ultimately chose the couch as there was too much glare otherwise. Sherlock was already convinced that he wouldn't like the movie, but he had promised John that he would be on his best behavior plus he didn't want to upset Rosie. As the movie began he tried to keep an open mind. Within the first few minutes Rosie was singing and dancing along. That alone made the whole ordeal worth it. Although he would never admit it, Sherlock was actually kind of enjoying the story regardless. It may not be intellectually stimulating, but at least Rapunzel was a bit more empowered than the typical Disney princesses. As the movie progressed, Rosie inched closer and closer to Sherlock until she eventually was texting her head on his shoulder. Similar to in the cab the other night, this made his heart soar. He loved Rosie more than he could have ever imagined possible. She was the daughter he never thought he would have.
Sorry this is so late!
At this John looked up, his eyes met Sherlock’s.
“Okay, Sherlock. I like that idea.”
“Hi Rosie, did you enjoy your nap?”
“Did you read to her?”
“Daddy’s away helping Auntie Harriet!” Rosie replied matter-of-factly.
“We missed you though.”
He added the pasta and set a timer for 10 minutes, just what the box said. He poured Rosie a glass of apple juice, made himself a cup of tea, and got two bowls ready. After the alarm buzzed, he took the pot off the stove and told Rosie that she could finish her picture later.
" Oh!! You made us lunch?! You're the best, Sherlock" When she noticed the grilled cheese on her plate and the steaming bowl of tomato soup an enormous grin appeared on her face. "How did you know that I wanted this for lunch!? You didn't even ask!"
“Really, Sherlock. I’m fine. Let’s just sleep.” John pulls the sheets back over to his side and tries to get comfortable. Eventually, he is able to fall back to sleep only to awaken to an empty bed and the sound of his alarm blaring a few hours later.
Rosie sprinted down the steps just as Sherlock was cutting the grilled cheses in half. Diagonally of course. Sherlock had noticed that's how John always cut sandwiches and he secretly loved that quirky habit.
The entire ride over Rosie was singing to herself and practicing her dance moves in her head. Sherlock didn’t quite understand what she was saying, but he loved how excited she was. When they got to the studio he kissed her on the cheek and promised that he would be back so that he could watch the end of the class. He spent the next hour in Scotland Yard cracking cases for Lestrade. He finally solved the case of the missing father (it was murder), he found a stolen painting, and thwarted a bank robbery. Overall, it was a productive afternoon.
He went over to the kitchen and turned on the stove. “Would you like some hash browns too? I think Daddy bought some potatoes.”
John was worried about leaving Rosie with Sherlock for the weekend. But what were his options? His sister Harriet had called and she rarely ever asked for help. Maybe he shouldn’t go...Sherlock isn’t capable of taking care of a child! Although she was now in kindergarten, to John, Rosie would always be his baby. Yes, he will just call up Harriet to cancel and apologise. She’ll understand, she has to.
“Okay, then it’s settled. We can have a family day each week, does that sound okay?”
Then, Rosie said something that caught him entirely off guard.
She went back to devouring her cone. Sherlock was surprised that there was even ice cream left, as it looked like she was wearing the majority of it. Once the two finished their ‘meal’ he got some napkins and helped Rosie clean up the mess. He made a mental note to do the laundry, or John would most certainly learn of their little escapade.
“Yes, bumblebee. Let’s see where they are.”
Sherlock nodded and smiled, “Yes, I suppose you are right, bumblebee. But first, today you have to be a ballerina. While I tidy up, how about you go get ready.”
“What Sherlock? What can be so important that you need to yell?”
John notices the look of panic register in Sherlock’s face. Perhaps Sherlock hadn’t been listening when John told him about Harriet’s call.
This was the first of many parenting decisions Sherlock would be faced with. He didn’t see the harm in her wearing what she wanted so he sent her up to her room to get ready. In the meantime, Sherlock cleaned off the table and threw on a purple button up, it just happened to be one of John’s favorites. As he was finishing up with the dishes, Rosie came running down the stairs.
The two worked together seamlessly. Rosie set the table, Sherlock peeled and sliced the potatoes, Rosie cracked the eggs. Within an hour they had full stomachs and empty plates. “Thank you for all of your help, Rosie!”
Rosie was wearing a sparkly, purple leotard with a little tutu. She was quite the sight. “Do you like my leotard, Sherlock? Daddy got it for me!”
He finished drying the last bowl, shut off the lights, and headed upstairs himself. “Okay Rosie, I will read a story. But only one, okay?”
“Don’t be daft, John. I love Rosie, you know that. She isn’t a burden if that’s what you are implying.”
“I know, I know. I was just teasing, Sherlock. Yes, I can text you my recipe. But you should know that I am going to expect you to start picking up the slack when I get back! Now that I know that you can cook the days of me spending every night in the kitchen are over.”
Sorry for the late upload!
“John?....John!...John?!” an exasperated Sherlock calls from downstairs pulling John from his thoughts.
Tentatively, Sherlock mumbled “She called me Dad today…”
“We love you too. I don’t know why people say mean things about you, Sherlock. You’re a good dad.”
“The zoo? Come on Rosie, you can do better than that”, Sherlock chastises. “Zoos are bor--”
In a rare act of spontaneity Sherlock replied, “how about we have ice cream for dinner?”
Just short and sweet Johnlock! <3
Soon enough it was bedtime. After rinsing off, Rosie got into pajamas and Sherlock tucked her into bed. He didn’t get to read quite as much this night as after just one chapter he looked up to see her sleeping. He quietly turned off the lights, kissed her forehead, and left the room.
She looked up from her show, “Yes please, Sherlock.”
“Oh, well, I am sorry Sherlock. I just, got worried…” he trailed off.
“Yes, bumblebee? We can go to the zoo, but first we need to get dressed.”
“I want us to be a family, John. I realized today that I never do anything with Rosie. When you come home, I want that to change. She’ll be grown up before we know it.”
“I miss you. I know it’s only been a few days, but I am looking forward to you coming back home.”
“Okay, Myc, I’m going to, calm down, it’s okay.” Greg shushed Mycroft as he petted the other’s leg awkwardly, trying to get him to relax a little. It works and Mycroft manages the tiniest of nods to showcase consent.
“Sherlock...I’m a doctor.” John warned as he stared at Sherlock’s adorable pouty lips. He was definitely not thinking about how to shut them up by kissing the Detective.
“She was nervous, how could she not? Melissa was never the type to want physical contact. Her heart was beating wildly as-“ John read, pausing for a second when Sherlock grabbed his spare hand to cuddle with.
“Also, cockblocker is a bad word.” John added in (a little pathetically) before stroking Rosie’s shoulder, “We love you, you know.”
A deep breath.
“Fuck it.” John mumbled as he leaned forward to breath in Sherlock’s scent. (He smelled like berries, something woody and oh so Sherlock)
A full second of silence envelopes the table until John finally comprehended what he said. “OH NO. I DIDN’T MEAN THAT. I MEAN. I’M NOT GAY. NOT THAT YOU WOULDN’T LOOK GOOD. BUT THAT WAS THE POINT. I DON’T KNOW. YOU’RE A GOOD LOOKING FELLA. I DON’T—“
“Well... it’s the same for me.” Sherlock mumbled, using his left hand to capture the John’s hand, intertwining their fingers together. The letter was left on the ground, being the object of nobody’s fascination.
Eyeing John’s hand warily, Sherlock shook his head. He was not a child and refused to be treated as such. He covered his forehead with his hands to try and prevent John from taking his temperature, “I’m not si— “
What I, Mycroft Holmes, like about Gregory Lestrade:
Meanwhile Sherlock was sitting in the opposite chair, just observing John. He was bored. Of course, deducing the hell out of John while he listened could be the answer. For example, once Sherlock deuces John was more of a cat person in front of his then Girlfriend (who owned a dog), they fought wondrously.
Harry pursed her lips and nodded sarcastically before leaning towards a very uncharacteristically silent Sherlock to whisper (very loudly). “He’s only gay for you...you see.”
John didn’t quite know how he got involved in a relationship with Sherlock. He simply remembered Sherlock being very excited and planting a gigantic kiss on his lips. His explanation was, ‘I think we needed that.’
“Sherlock...”
“WHAT THE FUCK-“
Lestrade’s breath stutters to process the words coming out of Mycroft’s mouth. All of a sudden, he pulls out. The tip is barely in Mycroft’s ass, causing Mycroft to to whimper needy. Quickly, he thrusts in deeper, hips pistoning in and out at a much quicker pace.
“Do you...think so? I don’t know. I may have an infatuation with this person but if I want to allow my feelings to grow, I want to know who it is.” Sherlock complained, feeing the weight of the newest letter burn in his pocket.
1. The way he smiled when I first met him, despite the fact that I had essentially berated him on his incompetence.
“Sherlock found the moles, have to go back to work. I’m so sorry that I’m not here. I’ll see you soon. Love, Greg.”
While Sherlock went yammering about the science of attraction, John swallowed his fear. He stared at his chittering roommate, who was pointing out things about different people in the room in rapid fire style. John stared into the strange, beautiful, blue green eyes that he knew so well and took a deep breath.
Speaking of roommates, where was Sherlock? The man had disappeared for an hour and his morgue runs usually take about 30 minutes. (Not that John was counting)
Grabbing his cock in one hand, Lestrade slowly sunk the tip into Mycroft’s tight waiting heat. He sucked in a deep breath as he was met with the overwhelming sensation of Mycroft’s greedy hole clenching onto his cock.
Mycroft had arrived home in a foul mood, slamming the door behind him as he stomped his way up the stairs. The fact that Greg had not been at the door to welcome Mycroft with the usual peppering of kisses and tea seemed to have worsened his mood significantly.
Sherlock sighed from his position under the shady tree, he honestly doesn’t know what to do about it. He hasn’t talked to Irene about it because her responses are totally flawed. She would suggest something like “Find them and snog them.”
Sherlock leaned back in his chair, not knowing whether to feel flattered or harassed. Meanwhile, Harry looked on at her stuttering Brother, infinitely amused.
John stood very still, bent over the phone like a shocked chihuahua, wondering how Harry was able to do that. “How...how did you know?”
“Mycroft, he’s here.” Sherlock’s voice pierced Mycroft’s ear through his business earpiece.
Sherlock’s lips trembled slightly as they tried to tug downwards. “Cab,” he said shakily.
“Alright, well I saw some canned pasta in there and I’ll make enough for both of us.”
“Anyone ready for breakfast?” Greg asked. “Special pancakes for a special morning!”
“Well we can’t very well go to Baker Street at the moment. It’s a little… blown up.” Sherlock smirked at John.
“I don’t deserve your kindness,” Mycroft said, voice breaking around the last word as his mouth pulled downward.
“As I suspected,” she chuckled. “Go grab her and bring her in. I can watch her for a couple hours if you want to take a nap.”
“You know she’s not an experiment you can discard when you get bored, right?”
“Yay!” Greg said, grabbing Jackie’s hands and waving them in the air. This made Jackie fussier and she started to whine. “Okay, okay, Little Miss Grumpy, we’re on our way there.” Greg rubbed her stomach through the carrier. “Just hold on.”
“What? You are.”
“Hugs,” she added after a moment, glancing up briefly at John before looking away.
“Hello Constable Lestrade, D.I. Nolan. I am here to inform you that the government will be taking over the case and your assistance is no longer necessary.”
“Thank you, John,” Mycroft said, closing the door as John turned to catch the elevator.
“Not for another hour, at least.” John came back into the sitting room carrying two steaming mugs of tea. “Him and Lestrade are checking out flats. I think they might settle on one today.” John’s movement stuttered for a moment as he placed the two mugs on the low table in front of the sofa, glancing over at Sherlock.
Sherlock sat up at the wordless tap on the top of his head. Smiling, he watched as John bustled into the kitchen, reaching for his phone that had fallen from between John’s back and the back of the sofa. He tapped happily on his phone until John returned.
“Not to worry,” Greg said easily. “Jackie and I will put the groceries away, and then I think it will be time for a nap.” He smiled at Mycroft.
A curious look came into Liz eyes and she looked over at John and Sherlock, considering them for a moment before nodding and grinning a bit. She scampered over to Sherlock and John, clambering onto the couch so she was curled up between them.
“You can’t expect me to just sit here after you tell me you’re a wizard? And that magic is real?”
“I wouldn’t have had to if you stopped putting yourself in harm’s way,” Mycroft retorted back. Sherlock hummed low in his throat and rested his head back against the pillows.
“It’s okay,” John soothed, reaching down to take the phone from Sherlock’s hand. He replaced the phone with his own hand, towing Sherlock out to the sitting room.
“They’re beautiful, Mycroft,” Greg said, eyes brighter than normal as he looked back down at the gift. “Can I put them on now?” Greg asked.
“I’m not interested, please move on,” Sherlock re-iterated.
“It’s fine,” Greg said, smiling at the lady. “Just a small peck.” Greg rounded on Mycroft from behind the cart, leaving Jackie in the seat. He moved slowly as if approaching a spooked beast. Laying his hand slowly on the side of Mycroft’s face, he drew him down and gently pressed their lips together. The kiss only lasted a couple of seconds and was nothing more than a pressing of their lips. Pulling away, Greg smiled at Mycroft. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?” he asked gently, smiling. Mycroft spluttered for a moment before the chip and pin machine started beeping at him. Clearing his throat, he busied himself with removing the card from the machine and storing it back in his pocket. Greg scooped Jackie out of the cart and accepted the bags from the teller, proceeding out the store. He went quickly to the car and left the bags in it. The local electronics store was right beside the grocery store, which was their next stop.
“Did your baby just call you a cow?”
Greg smiled as he complied, putting all the requested items on the bed as well as a couple of books. “Anything else?”
“Well, that’s why I’m calling. Doctor Watson administered her shots and…”
“I have to go and get changed,” Mycroft interrupted, speaking over Greg. He stood and handed Jackie back to him. The movement woke her up and she started crying. “I only came home to check on her and change my clothes before heading out again.” Turning on his heel, Mycroft ran up the stairs. While he was upstairs, Greg rocked Jackie back and forth, his distress matching hers. He could have sworn that him and Mycroft were getting closer and, after the kiss the other day, he was sure… well, he had really screwed up now. Jackie stopped crying quickly, having only been momentarily shocked.
“How long has your team been here?”
“What?”
“Of course not,” Mycroft assured him. “Why don’t you kneel on the floor?” Greg slid gracefully to his knees, turning so that he was facing Mycroft. “Good boy,” Mycroft purred, running his hands gently through Greg’s hair. “There you go. Deep breaths. Let the tension out of your shoulders.” Greg let Mycroft’s voice wash over him, his words gently rocking him towards subspace. Fingernails started scraping against the back of Greg’s neck, leaving red marks in their wake. In the few times that Mycroft had brought Greg down, he had learned that it took a careful balance of pleasure and pain to get him fully down, unlike Sherlock who needed pure pleasure.
“Really? You didn’t feel an inkling of anything?” Greg asked, dejected.
Mycroft and Greg stood in awkward silence for a moment. “So, you’ll probably be in late tonight then, hey?” Greg asked.
“Yes, but they’ve got roots deep into the government and law enforcement. Hell, it’s how we got our jobs. And I’m always keeping an ear out for rumblings of unpleasant things coming from their side of things. If I ever hear anything too troubling, I will be the first to organize an uprising.”
“Yeah, I can’t blame you there,” John said quietly. “It kind of sucks, the inequality they’ve put on the two different statuses, doesn’t it?”
“What?” John asked, recoiling from the question.
“For you,” she said, handing them each a badge that read ‘Visitor, clearance 1’. “This way,” she continued, turning and stalking off towards the lifts. John and Sherlock followed, Sherlock glancing around and trying not to gape at the large polished hall in which they had landed. A large empty area halfway down the hall was the only blemish in an otherwise gilded, grand hall.
Sherlock’s assailant shoved him up against the wall of the alley, hard enough to hurt. “That was unbelievably stupid,” he hissed.
Shankley’s first two visits to Lester’s den were relatively innocuous, although it was clear the grooming was intensifying. He was offered food and a place to stay and then allowed to go on his way. Shankley was able to report back on the layout of the place and provide a small amount of insight into how Lester’s operation worked based on information he was able to glean during his limited access to the place. However, he had seen no evidence that any young people apart from himself were or ever had been in the building. If Lester really had the missing kids, he was keeping them firmly out of sight.
Greg’s cheeks pinked up a bit, but he gave as good as he got, biting his lip as he let his gaze rove over those areas of exposed skin, eventually stopping at Mycroft’s mouth. Greg licked his lips, and Mycroft’s breath hitched. “Hot,” Greg said with a hitched eyebrow, also not in reference to the tea. At that, it was Mycroft’s turn to blush. He cleared his throat nervously and took another sip of tea to hide his discomfiture.
Irene started at the sudden vehemence, then pressed her lips into a theatrical pout. “Oh, very well,” she sighed. She glanced over at the still-fuming John. “I think you’re in better hands than mine anyway.” She leaned in to whisper in John’s ear. “Take good care of him, doctor.”
. Of all the things I could have said at a time like this—
Sherlock’s sneering correction of, “It’s
"And why not? Why shouldn't I forgive you—"
“Your flatmate? Here? Tonight? In the middle of our date—while I was—what the
” he growled, and Sherlock unceremoniously stripped off every stitch of his remaining clothing, tossing it away. The staircase looked like the aftermath of an artillery barrage in a launderette.
“I must be getting heavy,” Sherlock mumbled after a bit. He tried to shift away, but John clutched him closer with a sound of protest. “Mmm...no. Not yet.”
he shouted. “I figured there’d at least be sound effects.”
“John—” I begin, and reach out to him.
He rocked Sherlock gently as the first sobs took him.
He had really liked Louise.
“Oh, I planned them all,” John said.
“You, er...might want to do something about your hair, too,” John said. “It’s defying gravity at the minute.”
So. The fall, then.
John chortled. “Oh, that’s rich. I came home to a fucking
Sherlock returned some minutes later with his cuppa, still looking aggrieved, and settled into his chair. John worked his way steadily through his three cups of tea and went back to staring through Sherlock, who did his best to ignore the eerie gaze and get on with his work. He made one or two abortive attempts at conversation, only to be shushed with a peremptory, “Thinking!”
The detective made an affronted noise that produced no discernible effect on his companion, who went on sipping serenely, and flounced off to make his own tea. John gave an unseen smirk as he heard the kettle click on.
“Delighted.” Greg smiled sweetly.
Sherlock had to concede that their concern was generally warranted, and while he would sooner shower in batrachotoxin than say so, he was grateful to Mycroft and John for their vigilance, for keeping him right. But John and Mycroft did not know everything. For instance, they did not know that Sherlock Holmes was not the only one to have danger nights. John Watson had them, too.
“Unimaginative,” John added crossing his arms and eyeing Donovan and Anderson. “Not to mention childish.”
A wrinkle appeared between Sherlock’s eyebrows. “Give up dating? Why?”
“Audacious,” Sherlock said.
Greg sipped again, mouth twisting into a sardonic grin. “Hmm...not sure I want to repeat what I said. It might offend your aristocratic sensibilities.”
This was wrong. Sherlock's experience of sexual relationships may have been limited, but one aspect on which he was entirely clear was the concept of consent. John wasn't gay—he had made that abundantly clear many times over the years—and that meant he wasn't interested. Moreover, he had given up dating to focus on the Work, and here Sherlock was repaying him with inappropriate sexual fantasies about him and his (massive, mouthwatering—
By this time, Lestrade had arrived. He greeted Shankley with relief, ascertained that he was unharmed, and began searching for the light switch. A few seconds later, a set of fluorescent tubes flickered to life. “Oh, my God!” Greg exclaimed as the light revealed a long row of ratty mattresses along the far wall. Three of the beds were occupied by young people—two boys and a girl—each of them shackled to the wall with a length of chain. The captives blinked and squinted in the sudden light. Lestrade couldn’t suppress a sigh of relief as he recognized one of them as Nicholas Luddington, the government minister’s son, alive and apparently unharmed.
Sherlock moved to one corner of the room and ran his torch up the seam where the two walls met. “For why this room is so incongruous when compared to the rest of the building. The rest of the place is a tip, but this space is pristine.”
Sherlock froze in disbelief for a moment as the display switched from login to desktop. He had been staring at that damned login screen for so long that it took him a moment to process that it had actually changed. Right.
So for the first while, everything was just about perfect. Then Sherlock caught sight of John Watson’s penis. Things got a bit ridiculous after that.
“John, you can’t leave!”
“You were right,” Greg said, leaning in.
Sherlock’s cock twitched in his pants and he felt some precome spurt out into his underwear. Yes. That.
The two men turned toward Donovan and Anderson and blew a pair of perfectly synchronized raspberries at them before turning and striding away, heads held high. Sherlock’s rumbling chuckle followed them down the corridor.
He squeezed my hand, waiting for me to continue. I swallowed and took a breath. Thinking back, I can no longer recall what I originally intended to say, but it was certainly not what I
“Stop it,
to kill you, Sherlock. What kind of person does that?”
See you tonight.
John swallowed. “I’m afraid, Sherlock,” he rasped, as is his way when in the grip of a strong emotion. “I don’t know how to deal with any of this, with any of what we’ve been through. I...I stopped drinking, you know that, yeah?”
Sherlock left and returned a moment later with the bathroom bin and a fresh liner, and John continued sipping his water as he watched Sherlock arrange the receptacle near the sofa.
“Mm,” Sherlock agreed as he returned to his hacking. “There are a number of factors at play there, not least of which is how many herbal soothers she’s indulged in at any given time.”
“Wha—” the detective began but broke off with a grunt as his back made violent contact with the brickwork for the second time.
John opened his eyes, but a grey mist seemed to swirl before them. Yes, now he remembered—the joys of "time travel." He wasn't on the bathroom floor anymore, that much was clear. There was worn leather beneath his touch. The sofa, then. He brought a hand up to his forehead and removed the cold cloth.
Sherlock raised himself up just enough to gaze down into John’s eyes and smiled radiantly. “So do I,” he said. His eyes dipped down to John’s lips, and John raised up to meet him, bringing their mouths together for a passionate kiss. When it was done, Sherlock put his head back down onto John’s shoulder, nuzzling into his neck, and John rubbed his back with slow, regular strokes as they finished catching their breath.
Momentous?
Sherlock glared and pointed mutely at the shower wall.
“No hard feelings. Should have been expecting it, really,” Sherlock answered as he straightened his Belstaff. He rubbed at the spot on his jaw where Shankley had landed a solid punch. He glanced over at John, who was observing all this with his arms crossed. “Short Scotsmen—stumpy canisters of compressed rage, every one of them.”
"I shall admit no such thing! And don't change the subject." Sherlock fixed him with an assessing look. “So, this has all been a plan of yours.”
Mycroft shrugged, looking down at his plate. “They do...under the right circumstances.”
you want, John? For God’s sake, you’re not making any sense!”
John, for his part, went about his usual routine, working part-time at the surgery, helping Sherlock on cases, cooking dinner, sharing takeaway, helping Sherlock with his brain work, and smoothing things over when Sherlock inevitably deduced people to tears, fury and the occasional homicidal impulse. And through it all he was his usual self—steady, competent, charming and intimidating by turns—and always, always, he had Sherlock’s back. Sherlock was frankly delighted.
THE PIN IS INCORRECT. TRY AGAIN.
been ridiculous, complete rubbish, but... “
“It’s a dish rack. A rack. For dishes. An item commonly found in kitchens and used to drip-dry the washing up. I realize you’re not the most domestic person, Sherlock, but I thought even you knew what—”
Greg stopped chewing in disbelief. “Gymkhana? Seriously? They don’t do takeaway!”
When it finally ended, he stood a moment, eyes shut, gasping, cock still in hand. Knees shaking, he braced himself against the basin as he tried to catch his breath. He groped blindly for the tap and shut it off.
Down in the living room, Sherlock slammed the dildo down onto the side table, threw himself into his chair, and flipped open the laptop. Now, then: to find that video. As soon as the login screen came up, Sherlock briskly tapped in the four digits of John’s PIN.
“Oh, like the fact that the items in these photographs aren’t exactly to scale, are they?”
knew he had been there, and just the idea of trying to look John in the eye with that knowledge in the back of his mind was...squirm-inducing. The very thought made him quail. Maybe he could just curl back up under the covers and avoid John in perpetuity. Good plan, that. Capital.
“Why are you still here?” John asked, hands on hips. “Was it the
Sherlock’s text alert sounded and was ignored, because just then John was in the process of tearing Sherlock’s shirt off and tossing it across the room.
From the moment they had met, Sherlock had known that John had demons. The PTSD and psychosomatic limp Sherlock had deduced were proof of that. Knowledge of John’s flashbacks and nightmares had come later. But only recently had Sherlock begun to fathom just how much damage his “death” had done to his friend, how much it had added to the burden of trauma John already bore. He had saved John’s life by pretending to take his own, but at what cost? Here was more proof of the devastation his actions had wrought. He had had no choice in the matter, and once his initial anger and hurt had passed, John had understood that, but Sherlock had miscalculated badly when it came to anticipating the depth of John’s grief and despair at his loss. He knew what John meant to him, yet he had not seen how much he, in turn, meant to John. There was always something, and emotions had always been a bit of a blind spot for Sherlock. Terra incognita, and strewn with landmines into the bargain. He felt as though he had just blundered into one. He sighed. Would he ever get this right?
That left the lorry driver.
—here Sherlock’s breath hitched—
Sherlock twisted around, startled, but there was no one behind him. Of course—the earpiece. He had forgotten all about it.
One morning, Sherlock awoke to the sound of the bathroom door closing as John prepared to take a shower. The water started up and Sherlock rose, wrapping his bedsheet around him. John usually had his coffee after his shower, but sometimes he did it the other way around. Hoping it would be the latter, Sherlock stumbled into the kitchen in search of caffeine. John, bless him, had left him some coffee in the French press. Sherlock pulled down a mug and filled it, yawning widely. He dumped in his customary three sugars and took his first sip of the black elixir, sighing with satisfaction. His gaze settled on an unfamiliar item in the dish rack. He frowned. That hadn’t been there the night before.
“—let me get my phone, I’ll—”
“What the
“Desire?”
“Of course,” he breathed. “Why would there be only one bulb for this entire cellar?” He approached, staring up at the light, and put a hand up to feel around the edges of the light fixture. “Maybe because—yes! That burst of static we heard, John. What if it wasn’t static at all?” he grinned. “What if it was
John grabbed his duffle bag and sprinted out of the station as soon as the train came to a halt. The sight of a black sedan waiting at the kerb told him all he needed to know. As he approached, the driver emerged, looking grim, and wordlessly handed John a power bank before opening the rear door for him.
Sherlock’s phone rang again and was ignored, because John was reaching into Sherlock’s underwear and wrapping his hand around the silk-over-steel of Sherlock’s hardness, and Sherlock’s breath seemed to vanish along with every thought he’d ever had.
This was met with a dual blank stare from the Holmes brothers.
“As a matter of fact, it was,” John said mildly. He looked Sherlock up and down, taking in not only his state of undress but also the slow blush blooming upward from chest to face as Sherlock realized it too. John licked his lips, unconsciously running a fingertip over the dildo’s frenulum as he cradled the neon-green scrotum in his other hand. “I’ll just...let you get on with it, then, shall I?”
But John wasn’t here, was he?
The second reason for the delay was Fergus Shankley. This little Scottish bastard muscled his way into my fic and demanded to go on an adventure with Sherlock and John. This fic isn't about you, I said. Don't care, he said. It's a fic about wanking, I said. I wank, he said. Didn't need to know that, I said. Still don't care, he said. He sat down and refused to leave until I wrote him in. We argued for a while, but we all know how arguing with a little Scottish bastard usually turns out. So: everyone, meet Fergus Shankley.
I have told him that mind-palace John helped me survive Serbia, and he has told me that after my fall, he saw me in the same way he saw Mary after her death, and that his hallucinations of me were the only thing that kept him from killing himself.
“I heard you when you came. You said my name. What were you doing, Sherlock, hmm? Were you having a garden variety wank, or were you fingering yourself? Were you picturing my
“Pass it to me,” John said.

Sherlock abruptly snapped out of it, sucking in a breath like a diver surfacing from the depths. He blinked some moisture back into his stinging eyes.
Anderson did a jack-in-the-box from behind his desk. “
“Ready?” Sherlock asked John.
"Should you be sitting?" asked Sherlock. "You did just—"
"W-what?"
—aaand there was the whimper, right on schedule.
Mycroft looked astonished.
Sherlock’s gaze snapped back to him, eyes hard. “Then what the hell
“There are just so many creative options,” Shankley said. “But Hobbit? Really? So obvious.”
Sherlock began with the obvious: birth dates. Month/day, then year for John, Harry, Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock himself.
Mycroft smiled. “I would be delighted, Greg, thank you.” Greg smiled in return and handed him a plate and fork of his own.
he broke off as Sherlock fell on him.
“An explanation,” Sherlock answered.
“Maybe it was the sound of something heavy being displaced. A dragging sound.” Sherlock whirled around, coat flaring. “Lestrade! Let me back in. I need to see the cellar again.”
"Better?" I ask.
I have apologised for Reichenbach, and he has apologised for cutting me out of his life.
The resulting row was one for the history books and certainly the loudest her boys had had in Mrs. Hudson’s recollection. While much of the shouting was muffled by walls and floors, the occasional volley came through clearly, including, “Amateur detective, my arse! Professional cockblock, more like.”
“John,” he heard Sherlock murmur, and he felt Sherlock’s other arm come around him, gathering him close. For all the times he had imagined this—dreamed of it—fantasised about it, John was not prepared for the sheer depth of emotion Sherlock’s touch would elicit. Sherlock drew him in even closer, and now they were trembling together, hands still clasped between them. John could feel Sherlock’s heart pounding against the back of his hand, mirroring the thumping of his own. He drew back far enough to look into Sherlock’s eyes, then brought the hand he was clasping up to his mouth and pressed a tender kiss to each long, elegant finger. Sherlock gasped at the sensation. John stroked his thumb over the perfectly manicured nails. Smiling softly, he turned Sherlock’s palm upward until he could see the tips of his fingers, callused from the violin strings. He placed a soft kiss on each fingertip in turn, looking up at Sherlock as he did. Sherlock’s colour was high, his chest heaving.
John cleared the last few steps up to the flat, never breaking stride as he made a beeline for Sherlock and Rosie. At the last second he slowed just enough to avoid jarring the baby and took them both into his arms. He was still breathing hard.
John indicated the glass in his hand. “Maybe a chunder bin, just in case this decides to come back up.”
It fetched up just below the ceiling joists, revealing itself to be a three-sided steel mesh cage capped off with the concrete frame for the faux drain. In all, it was about six feet tall and wide enough to hold one person, or perhaps two if they weren’t overlarge and had no concept of personal space.
“I second that last sentiment,” Mycroft interjected.
“But if this is all a hoax, then who’s behind it?” Greg called after him.
,” he spat, “or shall we shoehorn in another euphemism?”
The words are no sooner out of my mouth than John's eyes widen in horror and he recoils, scrabbling backward and looking as though he's about to be sick.
“Oh. Oh!” Sherlock said as John stepped up to him, reaching up to cup Sherlock’s jaw with one hand, and brought their mouths together. The kiss was soft and slow and almost chaste—both of them acutely aware of the little girl lying asleep just steps away—yet when it was done they both breathed as though they’d been running.
John and I are talking now, more than we have ever done. There was a turning point for us that marked a sea change in our relationship, and it came one night after John awoke from a nightmare and sought me out. He had been dreaming about the well, I think. It's a nightmare we have in common. He stumbled down the stairs into the living room, where I was sitting in my chair. Awake, of course, because sleep and I have never been the best of friends and of late it appears we are not on speaking terms. John came to me, sat himself in his armchair, and ran a weary hand over his face. He leaned forward, elbows on knees. “I can’t do this alone, Sherlock,” he said, so low I could barely hear him.
. But if there is one thing I have learned in the years since Reichenbach (a period John has taken to calling "the shitstorm"), it is that I cannot keep doing what I have always done while expecting a different outcome. I am reliably informed that that is one of the definitions of insanity. And I have had quite enough insanity in my life, thank you kindly. Time to do things differently, I think.
I cried for Mycroft, who had had Eurus's (and my) care thrust upon him at far too young an age and had borne the burden alone all these years, and who was now grappling with our parents' censure and the mental, emotional and physical carnage our sister had wrought. And who didn't have a John Watson to help him.
“Sorry about that, mate,” said Shankley as he hoisted himself to his feet. “Thought it was one of those wankstains comin’ back.”
As the two PCs came scrambling down the stairs, Sherlock and John crammed themselves into the steel cage. It began moving as soon as they were in—weight-activated, apparently. John gripped his gun tighter. There was no way of knowing what awaited them down there, but odds were it was nothing good.
“Increased intracranial pressure. It can happen sometimes when...” he gestured in the direction of the toilet. “If it’s really violent, pressure can build up inside the brain and press on the optic nerve. It’s temporary. I’ll be fine in a few minutes.”
” He somehow managed to resume his frantic snogging of Sherlock while simultaneously backing up the stairs and pulling his own trousers and pants down. Multitasking had always been one of his strong suits. His erection sprang free, and Sherlock’s mouth watered at the sight of that hot, flushed hardness. He reached out to stroke, making John gasp at the touch. John’s knees went weak just as his trousers pooled around his ankles, and he overbalanced, instinctively grabbing onto Sherlock as they tipped over backwards onto the floor at the top of the stairs. Sherlock landed on top of John with a grunt, but any discomfort they may have felt was instantly eclipsed by the glorious sensation of their cocks touching. They both groaned.
