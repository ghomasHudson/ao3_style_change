too much. And somehow you'd magically know what almost too much was, and I'd only be able to think of your cock."
“He can wait his turn. Right now I get you all to myself." Dean claimed Jimmy’s lips in a way that made it clear exactly how serious he was about that. Careful not to pull, he got a solid grip on Jimmy’s hair, and used that to direct things. His kiss wasn't rough exactly. But it certainly wasn't gentle. Jimmy made a sound against his mouth, and arched his whole body up. Dean broke the kiss, but kept his hand where it was.
Dean kissed him, more gentle and sweet this time. "You're not Cas. I need you to know that, before we do this. You can’t just
with no luck. He could dig through paper records just fine, but he’d grown up learning how to find hundred-year-old newspaper articles on microfilm. Not up-to-date information about how to actually cope with shit. He looked back at Sam, admitting defeat. "It's called a 'personal bill of rights.' Like a list with 20 or 30 things on it? Ash had it, in one of his books.”
Dean shut himself in the bathroom and locked the door. Not that it would do anything to stop Cas from opening it if he wanted, he could probably unlock it with his goddamn mind. But it made Dean feel better. Back against it, he slid to the ground to take stock of the situation. He had a blanket, his cellphone, and Jimmy's trench coat. It was pathetic how happy he was about that last one.
“My vessel is pleased with you. And me.” He slipped a leg between Dean’s thighs, and Cas’ cock – Jimmy’s cock – slid up against his. “I am reminded that I can stimulate your cock and your prostate at once. I am reminded I should not phrase it this way.” Then, through very slightly gritted teeth – “He is... teasing me. You are a bad influence.”
Bringing an arm behind him to rest in Jimmy's hair, Dean tried to figure out how to put words to this thing he wanted. He tried, but coherent thought was lost. That was okay. If they wanted him like this, he could do that too. Dean was pretty sure he could do anything right now. Cas hit just the right angle and Dean threw his head back as a silent scream left his throat.
Jimmy shivered underneath Dean. "Wait. Your idea's better. I'll get to feel you too, through him. Cas' whole bondage thing would turn into a
Dean had to agree. He didn't want to think about Jimmy anywhere near Hell. But he was almost to the good bit of the story, and didn't want to get distracted.
"No, I know you're serious about kids, you're always serious about kids. I mean, you're serious about getting married. You're serious about this guy."
a fan of biting. He shifted his attention to the other side for the sake of symmetry. Any job worth doing was worth doing well. Blowjob. Handjob. Italian Job. Didn't matter.
Dean took that as permission to finish off the rest of Jimmy's plate. "You should try food sometime. You liked other stuff you've tried so far. Food’s at least as good as a hot shower, and that was totally worth getting out of bed for."
"The problem is Castiel. Somehow the problem is Castiel. And it's not his... Castiel-ness. You were fine when he - we - were...." Jimmy blushed, and didn't seem able to finish that sentence.
Dean bit his lip. Nodded. Opened his eyes to look at Cas. He must have closed them without noticing. God, the feelings in his chest right now were... big.
Dean was so in love. He'd never been this in love before. He rose up to pull Jimmy to him. They kissed softly, in each other's arms. Not going further. Not needing too.
"Good." Dean kissed Jimmy again. "Anyway, I'm having a really crap day. I wake up in a coffin, and by the time I dig my way out the sun is right on top of me. I'm gross, sweaty, covered in dirt, trying to figure out what's happening. I figure something hinky is going on, because they were supposed to have salted and burned my corpse."
"Cas, if Jimmy were hurt or sick or something, you'd want to know how to help. You’d want to know if it was going to keep getting worse? Even if there wasn’t anything you could do?”
"I think Claire'll want to get to know you,” he said. “The first time around, I get it that she hated your guts. But Jimmy was dying that second time, and if we get him home safe, I think she might say thanks. And we
Dean didn’t want to wake up. His entire body was relaxed, he was cuddled up to something warm. He felt safe and secure and was going back to sleep. Vaguely, he remembered there was something he wanted to be awake for. That could wait. He moved to snuggle more deeply under the covers. What could be so important that he would want to leave this feeling? Nothing. That’s what.
Because as Dean watched, the flight paths the lightning bugs took became straighter and more regular, more geometric than they should have been. Lines of light separated by velvet black, blade-shaped patches.
“Hey, it’s alright.” Dean carded his fingers through Jimmy's hair. “This isn’t hiding. This is talking, opposite of hiding.”
Cas kissed him deeply. A hand stroked down his ribcage, over his hip, and came to rest on his ass - before Cas jerked himself up, annoyed. He needed both hands to work the little thing of lube, and as he flicked open the cap and squirted into his hand, he stared at the bottle like it had offended him.
Dean clutched at Cas' hair, the sheets, the hands on his waist. Anything. Cas had said he wanted to see Dean lose control so he didn’t try to keep from thrusting into Cas' mouth. Anyway, he was helpless not to.
"If I get one of your aliases married to his real name, and I absolutely intend to, then she’ll be your daughter too."
"Dude. You made me cry you were so gentle. You're fantastic. And someday I'm going to want to do it for real. Maybe not soon, but we can work up to it."
"You must forgive yourself," said Castiel. "You must forgive yourself for loving Alastair, in the way that you did. You must forgive yourself for keeping Jimmy from a normal life. You must forgive yourself for
And Dean - Dean had to think. Before Hell he would have said yes to kinky stuff like that in a second.
Dean grinned, "Nice to know I found a guy who appreciates the finer things in life." The eyebrow waggle was unforgivably camp. But Jimmy moved a hand across his temple, and into his hair.
"He looks like he is drugged, in subspace, or both," Ketch said. Cas hummed, and then stretched as much as he could, to give Dean better access to his neck. He smelled delicious. Dean hummed, happy. Someone's hand was on his cock. Someone else kissed his temple. Dean hung between them, desperate to please. That need almost feral in its intensity.
Dean took a moment to just look up at him. "I am so in love with you right now. I can't believe I get to be the first person to do this for you. Means I get to make sure it's done right."
Jimmy was clutching his shoulder in a death-grip, as his whole body contracted. He circled against Dean's fingers with movements so small they were like tremors, and the noises he made were noises of effort, close to sobs.
It was like they both decided to give him a show at the exact same time. Cas got a hand in Ketch's hair and pulled a sound out of him, and Ketch was using this as an excuse to actually touch. His hands were on Cas, on Dean, on the furs sounding them, as he plastered himself tight against Dean's body. This was
Then Jimmy's weight fell against his back, and Dean felt his bare chest. "Okay. That knife thing?" Jimmy nipped Dean’s earlobe. "That is the
, he was back. And there was a pillowcase over his head, for a second anyway. Then Cas was pulling out handfuls of little sample-sized KY lube bottles. Most of them went on the nightstand. But one, he kept in his hand.
The "till death do us part" remained unspoken. For now, it could wait. Cas and Jimmy would have each other when the whole mortality thing caught up with him, but he could make the most of the time they had. Besides, the world was ending. They might all die. Or cease to exist, as Cas put it. But Dean... wasn't in a hurry to leave.
Leaning his head back to rest against Jimmy's shoulder, Dean closed his eyes so he didn't have to see anyone’s face as he confessed.
“You don’t have any power to make me do anything. That’s sexy. So I want to do everything, take my time and enjoy it. You’ve never done this before and I get to give it to you. I guess what I’m saying - can I focus on you right now? Don’t feel like I don’t want you, or like you owe me.” Dean felt sick to his stomach just thinking about that. "This is me being selfish.
Cas brought Dean's hand to his lips, silently kissed the back, then down the fingers. He didn't break the rhythm between his thighs. Dean rolled to get a better vantage point. Pushed Castiel's hair out of his eyes for him.
, let alone him. But at least it was better than being naked, and the shoulders were definitely going to be big enough. Once he put it on, it almost looked like he was wearing some kind of ugly short dress. Giving up on the sleeves, Dean stuck his arms through the neck hole and tied them around the back.
Dean felt tired. Tired like when you ran until your muscles gave out. That was the closest thing he knew to this. A runner's high, but different. "Can you kiss me again?"
looking forward to getting to hold both of them at the same time - or at the same time in separate bodies. Technically Cas was still here. "You know I'm good with this, right?"
"Cas, even if you're fine like this, could you maybe take some pity on Jimmy and wear the towel. Please?" Dean knew he was being paranoid, but now he was worrying that the flames would somehow close around them. Kissing was nice, but they had more important things to focus on. Like whatever the hell was going on between Cas and Sam.
"You’re looking pretty out of it, man. Does Cas even look in the mirror? Or look at you in the mirror? When's the last time you had a shower?"
Cas found a sock under the bed and re-did his shoes, really going overboard with the knots this time. Then he took off the white button-down, put the undershirt on. Realized he had the undershirt on backwards.
Dean wanted to watch, but he also wanted to keep kissing Cas and he couldn't do both. That was the only problem.
." Dean looked up into the dark, quiet night as the reality of it all sank in. "I don't know how Dad ever let us out of his sight."
He wanted to hold Jimmy, provide some physical comfort, but at least Cas was still able to do that. The angel was rolling over his vessel like a wave, pinning him down, giving him all the skin contact possible. Staring into his eyes.
Cas hissed, and pressed into Dean to get more firmly under his hands. But Dean was teasing, and also proving a point, so he moved his fingers away from those sensitive connections, and rubbed farther down.
Cas was hunched in on himself, now totally silent. He swiveled to look at them. Then he grabbed Dean’s shoulders, and there was the sound of wind or wings, and Dean was sprawled on the mattress in the other room. Looking up at Cas was, who was staring down at him.
"Yeah. Thanks for reminding me." That had been the point of this. Just, healing could be really hard work sometimes. He’d forgotten.
There was a sound almost like kissing as Cas sucked his own fingers, experimentally. “Apparently, I need salvia.”
"I want to wrap my lips around your cock and watch you struggle not to lose control as I take you apart with my tongue."
"Good. So good." The hand in Castiel's hair let go of its death grip, to softly caress instead. “Little
And maybe Cas had noticed him freeze, because he carefully reached out and folded a hand over Dean’s shoulder again, like he wasn’t sure he was allowed. "Tell me what I can do for you.”
laughing. At some point, the laughter turned into crying. Great big ugly full bodied sobs, but he was still laughing through it. Dean just held on and let himself cry. Smiling, so much it hurt.
"See, I was focused on this gorgeous guy and whatever Cas did kinda blindsided me." Dean felt stupidly romantic. Also couldn't stop playing with Jimmy's hair.
"You left. I don't understand. I told you, and then you left. I didn't know where you were going, or why. And then you came back and it felt like when he'd let me stay. Like the times I'd pass out part way through from the pain or the... blood loss, and..." Dean got quiet again. Some things Sam didn't need to hear. "And how grateful I was to him for stuff like letting me clean up, and for..." Dean had to force the words out, "times I’d wake up to him offering me a glass of water and reminding me how lucky I am that he doesn’t like to break his toys."
he’d offer to help - but so far Cas was doing a great job. Dean was quietly hoping Jimmy would have to help with the tie.
"I know your family kinda sucks, and mine’s weird too, but I want to keep you around if you want to stay? I gave you a nickname, but if they ever make it legal, could I give you a last name to go with it?"
Dean stretched but didn't open his eyes. He recognized the shape of the man sleeping next to him. “Just had the best dream. Felt real." He turned over, began to kiss down Jimmy's chest. "It could be. If you want." The body under the blankets shifted, and Dean felt a heavy hand on the back of his head.
It definitely wasn't all that surprising, and it wasn't something he wanted to take advantage of, but Cas was
Cas pulled Dean firmer against his chest. His head turned slightly to kiss Dean's ear, and then - hands that could grind diamonds to dust, Jimmy's hands with their manicured nails - curled around his cock.
Dean half expected to see Cas out in the bedroom. He hadn't thought he'd gotten so used to them having separate bodies. Then he found his clothes and his phone, made his way down the stairs and past the crappy sofas and weird exhibitionist window setup. At least he didn't have to worry about any concerned neighbors. Nobody liked whoever lived here. It would have been nice if there was a street sign right next to the house. There wasn't. Dean was starting to regret his choice of no shoes by the time he finally did find one. He looked both ways down the street. No one was watching. And he already looked suspicious as hell, so he sat down on the curb and dialed Sam.
Jimmy kissed Castiel’s hand and then knelt at his side, very still, tucking his head into the curve of his angel’s neck. Cas brought up a hand to touch his hair. Dean wrapped an arm around Jimmy too. Calmer now.
There was a hand resting on the back of his head, grounding and strong. The feeling of Jimmy draped across him provided a warmth that chased away even the memory of cold. Dean could vaguely remember those things, but they had happened a long time ago, to someone else. Everything was so peaceful right now that he would have fallen asleep, if he hadn’t already been dreaming.
"I was just trying to explain. I don't know how to warp the rules. I just know how these dreams usually go."
Dean laughed and wiped his nose one last time before drying his eyes on Cas' clothes. He struggled to find words that wouldn't start him crying again. But before he could, Cas turned his head to kiss a few of the tears away. And Jimmy cheated out a little so Dean was able to see his dick - almost painfully hard and leaking.
“I want…” Dean didn’t know why he was saying this now, but if it went over bad, he could pretend it was a joke. “I want to buy beautiful lingerie and wear it under my clothes so that when you undress me, it feels like unwrapping a present.”
Cas was quiet too, leaning a respectful arm against the window. He brought up a hand to massage his own neck and shoulders, and it was such an unusual gesture that Dean was almost sure it had something to do with Jimmy.
"Breathe, try to relax for me." Dean was smearing additional lube onto his fingers. "Okay. I'm going to take this finger out but I want you to stay relaxed. You're doing a great job. Keep remembering to breathe, and tell me to stop and I'll stay exactly where I am." Careful of the possibility that Jimmy might tense up, Dean slid his finger out, before sliding it back in alongside a second. He went just as slowly as he had the first time around, and didn't just slide straight in. Instead, he rocked his fingers back and forth as he went, pressing against the rim of Jimmy's hole and silently cursing whoever invented flavored lube.
Dean had probably been this hard before. The first time he had sex, maybe. But he wouldn't swear to it.
How could he think about anything with Cas wreaking havoc on his oversensitized body like this? Even his nipples were responding, to nothing more than the temperature of the room.
Dean flopped onto the mattress. Made a noise that sounded pained before shifting enough to get his feet on the bed. Then he starfished out completely, not looking as he slung an arm haphazardly across Jimmy's body, pressing his face against the sheets. Trench coat. More trench coat. Chin. Dean made a muffled noise that conveyed the idea
Dean couldn't help just gazing at this man. "I am going to take such good care of you, baby. Maybe some time I’ll do an intimidating sexy badass thing if you want, but not this time. This time, I want to get to know your body and what you like. I want to make love to you." He kept his voice low and seductive, and was really enjoying the effect it was having on Jimmy. But he wasn't ready to wake up yet."We’ll talk more about all this when we're awake and I’m not worrying about random thoughts showing up and ruining the fun. But first..."
Jimmy bucked into his hands, and without meaning to sort of pulled Dean's head into his lap. "Sorry. That's – not what it feels like - with the other type of orgasm."
He'd... he’d called Alastair a rapist. That wasn't... He hadn’t... It wasn't like that. It was Hell. Things were complicated. He had agreed to everything. He hadn't been forced. It was the best option.
"Your mind surrounds us now. Your body will, soon. Your soul brought us together. You, fragile and human, encompass us."
"I'm scared, baby. I don't want to hurt you. I know what I'm doing, but it's been a while." In the back of his mind Dean was still trying not to think of how many people he’d hurt with these hands. Couldn't even ballpark how many souls he’d tortured. Couldn't undo that. But he could make Jimmy feel good.
“Maybe it’s more that we’ve learned to read each other's minds. Because of the no-respectable-living thing. You know, hustling pool. Impersonating officers of the law. We spent two weeks pretending to be art dealers selling old Dutch masters once. So we’ve got our code words."
"Dammit Dean..." And Jimmy just launched himself across Cas' chest, and took him in his arms. "After enough time has passed that my wife is able to have me legally declared dead, I will take you to Arizona, or Connecticut, or somewhere else gay marriage is legal. And if you still want to marry me then - I will marry you."
He wasn’t nervous. This was just what it felt like when he let himself be insanely, stupidly, head over heels in love.
Every single kiss he laid along the soft skin dragged a new cry out of him, and every one sounded surprised. Dean brought a hand up to caress the area just behind Jimmy's balls. Just getting a feel for things, figuring out the lay of the land. The shower was not the place for this to go much further.
“Cas," said Dean, hoping he was reading the situation right. "Can you bamf us someplace private until the coast is clear and I can go pick up my car? Someplace we can get you cleaned up? Don't know if your angel mojo needs to recharge or what. But…” If he was going to do something about that future, he needed to know
"Don't even joke about that." Dean reluctantly got off of the bed and found one of the bottles of lube. He wanted to laugh. A literal angel stole a bunch of lube and now Dean had a fiancé. It had been a weird couple of days. But then, he'd never really had much of a normal life. In a lot of ways, this was the most normal thing he'd ever done. "Screw walks of shame. Screw anybody who tries to make you feel bad about sex. I want to wake up next to you every morning. That won't change."
Cas pulled himself up a little straighter, then looked across the room to where Sam hovered, guarding the door.
"Who, me?" He tried to look innocent, but the effect was spoiled by the ear-to-ear grin. He'd just disobeyed a direct order and nothing bad had happened. He wasn't even afraid. "I'm still not over the fact I can do this." He didn't feel the need to clarify.
"You think I don't know that?!" Dean said like this somehow explained everything, "I know how this ends. And it's not some demon virus, it's me. I'm going to screw this up."
Cas was on his knees, hand still in Dean’s hair. A half-hard erection brushed over Dean’s cheek. Cas stroked his hair, but didn't move forward.
Jimmy held Dean close against him, and turned the water that surrounded them even hotter. "You don't get to leave us, you know."
Laying there with him, in the dim light, under that familiar coat - Dean felt like maybe he could talk. He still didn't want to, but maybe he could. Jimmy pulled the sheet over their heads into a tent-like situation.
Cas kissed the back of Dean's hand. “I would take care of you as carefully as you did my vessel. There is nothing I would not give you."
Jimmy grabbed the back of Dean's head and kissed him. Dean was glad his own weird upbringing and Sam's anger issues were useful for something.
He could make this right. He could call Sam, tell him he’d been an idiot for saying they should split up. Make it so that nightmare future never happened. Take better care of Cas.
"I thought we had more time before Michael's identity affected you," he said. "You should have experienced this someplace safer. I can… I can bring you home to the bunker now. Both of you," He pinned a look at Ketch. "The spell you are wearing is... clever."
Jimmy just hugged him. "I'd say sorry, but that was very worth it. Anyway, you know I can't stay away for long."
Cas looked in a completely different direction. Nowhere near Dean at all. "I wanted to make you feel safe and then I... did the wrong thing."
"Just talk for now?" This might count as an emergency, Dean wasn't sure. He just knew he didn't want Sam to hang up.
"I feel him as temperature, mostly," said Jimmy, drawing a line along Dean's inner forearm, down to his wrist. "I'm touching when I see him against your skin. But he's also texture. Like - something very dense. Like velvet." Jimmy ran his fingers in a circle against Dean's palm. "Or - vibrations. Like a loose electric wire. But thinner."
"Too late,” said Dean. “Even if he backs out now, I'm already on board. Anything that wants to hurt his family is going through me. Hey. Is Claire going to call you Uncle Sam? Because that would be hilarious."
"We really need to start taking better care of this man. He's barely slept. I don't know when the last time he ate was. And he still hasn't had that shower we promised him. We need to do better, Cas. He never asked for this. He had a life before us..." Dean wasn't sure where he was going with this. It just seemed wrong somehow.
"If you hadn't pulled me out of there when you did? You've seen the inside of my head. It's not prime real estate.” And if Dean was honest with himself he was still tempted, even after all this. "Get out of Hell free. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. You know. Taking crap deals is kind of a family tradition."
"It says that you do wrong and try to do better. That you are weak, and work to be stronger. That is what it is to be human. Compared with you, angels are nothing. Stagnant. I –" Cas turned away from Dean, and instead looked up. “I am allowing myself to think that what has happened to me could be a gift. A way to be more."
"Probably won't need it." Dean tried to think. "If we do, Cas has it. He has pockets. So it'll be there." Dream logic. He was not about to let himself be cockblocked by his own dream.
people I know,” Jimmy and Cas were like two kids hiding in a giant trench coat sometimes. “I wear clothes to show off what I’ve got.” There wasn’t really a way to look sexy while fishing a holster out of his pants, so Dean threw it onto the pile of clothes like the world’s least aerodynamic frisbee. “There. Totally unarmed and defenseless.” Glance back at Jimmy. “As far as you know.”
"I have never done anything like this before," Cas said, passing a thumb over Dean's nipple with the exact amount of attention he was giving everything else. He had a brief look of concern as he sat up, ran a hand down his own chest. "I have never seen this body without clothing."
. I want you inside me. I didn't feel this way before I met you... don't tease me. Don't tease me right now.” And slightly apologetically, "I mean. Slow me down, if you think that’s right. But... you'll do that anyway.”
"Jimmy. God, I didn't even think - let’s say I was talking about Cas. Since now I know you’re not really into the whole dom thing.”
“I don't feel him everywhere, but sometimes... I think I feel him in places? It almost tickles, from the inside out. But more...sideways?"
When Jimmy pulled away, he still stayed close, foreheads touching. "I'm going to get Cas for this next part,” he murmured. “You don't have to say it. I know I'm doing the thing with the hiding. But I don't want to mess this up, I
not into the idea of overstimulation. Not to where I was going to take things. Just wanted to be able to touch you for as long as I could. This.... this is more than enough."
Dean was the picture of calm except for the way he fumbled with the lube with his shaking hands."Baby, I want this. But we have to go slow, alright?"
"Pet, it's no matter. Go back under. Your angel was only reminding me that repeated use of the spell I was using could have side effects."
“You know who I am?" There was heat in Jimmy's voice. "I'm the small town salesman who ran away with his secretary and left his wife and child behind.
Cas stood, in the corner of the room. He was wearing a pair of sweatpants cuffed over about four times.
"He misses the other angels.” He was curled up into Dean's side. "A lot of them were bad and dangerous, but a lot were cool. Watchers. Healers - they've got cupids even. They know all sorts of things. Crazy
"I think I was getting pinned to a bed by someone I can only describe as sex incarnate. And I'm hoping they'll tell me how to make it up to them for laughing."
"If Captain Dirty Talk thinks he can do better, he's welcome to try. I think you did great. You're extremely sexy." Dean closed his eyes and leaned into Cas' touch.
"The whole time I'd know that none of it was real, and that the second I wanted it to stop, we'd stop. We can stop
this. I... I’m - that’s even worse.” Dean was going to have to do better, and he knew it. “Can I have a do over?”
remember humans have to eat.” Dean put a hand to Jimmy’s cheek. “Your facial hair doesn't even grow. And I really like using my mouth on you so I thought... I'm sure they have some plastic wrap or something around here somewhere. And Cas can teleport and stuff so..."
Sam moved his eyes silently back and forth, between Dean and Cas. "Is this a funky town or what?" he said, cautiously.
"Told you he liked you." Dean said, muffled by food. He ignored the look Sam shot him. "This is delicious."
Dean couldn't help it. He cracked up. "Okay, stop with the puns. Got to make sure we understand each other… and I know I just said no more puns, but I can't think of any other way to say this without sounding weird and medical? So uh, you have permission to explore the perimeter? Last one, I swear."
"See, Cas? You've got people now. We’re gonna look out for you. Like family's supposed to. We got you. You’re safe."
"Passed out in a warehouse, remember?” Dean grinned. “No, wait. An angel came to me in a dream and told me where to find him.
Dean tried to kiss every place he remembered Cas marking his ribs, but got distracted playing with Jimmy's nipples. Which were tiny, and cute, and best of all, sensitive. He lightly took one gently between his teeth. Not biting.
"I want to fuck you so badly I can't see straight. I want to get you open on my fingers, and suck you hard while I do it. I want to feel your pretty thighs around my back, pulling me in. Tell me how that makes you feel."
"If it were me, I'd start with telling her about the tattoos, and the salt, and those symbols Sam painted on the windows. And see where you are."
"There's some cars out front but I guess the people just walked away? Never saw anybody. The place is locked of course, so before I can get a drink of water I have to punch out a window. I just spent forty years in Hell, but the newspaper's saying it's only been a couple months. And I know for a fact I got torn to ribbons by some hell hounds, but somehow I'm fine when I look in the mirror? The only difference is I’ve got this handprint that I definitely didn't have before. Like... next time, just give a guy your number, Cas." Dean was quick to correct himself, "Or don't. We're getting married after all."
There were hands on his back. "Oh, making us jealous isn't going to work. You're ours now, and that's all there is to it."
all that stuff, just.... yeah, there's a lot I don't want. What... what kind of things were you thinking?"
like Cas. “He wants you to know. That’s why you have a burn mark. He was trying to fry you, the way he'd kill a demon. But you weren't a demon. He did it anyway."
In that instant, Dean was gone. And in his place there was a creature made entirely of need and pleasure. Arching his back, he moaned. The words were out of his mouth before he had a chance to stop them.
Jimmy scrunched up his face. "I gave you some pretty bad dialog. 'Bet you've never had someone give you their nice fat cock before, huh pretty boy?' That kind of stuff. Also you were wearing the leather jacket."
Sam paused. Jimmy had turned to face him, even though Dean still held him in his arms. “What you’ve got to understand - is Dean spent longer in Hell than he did here. He’s got habits, and ways of thinking about things, and things that remind him of Hell and those things
"You're not even going to get up, are you?" Dean laughed before rolling off the bed, not graceful. Moved his shoes to the foot, and began to shed his outer layer with military efficiency.
“It could, but I'm enjoying the view from here." It wasn't every day you got to watch a literal angel discovering dirty talk. Dean was going to make the most of this. “And speaking of fantasies? Someday, after we've had a chance to talk about it more, I want to kneel at your feet with my hands cuffed behind my back while you make me
Dean kissed him softly on the lips before retreating to the foot of the bed and doing his best Burt Reynolds impression.
Walking out, he made a beeline for the crackers, got in bed, and started eating. Point made, he discarded them in favor of making an ungodly tall Oreo sandwich. They'd gone for the double stuffed kind, which meant that if you did it just right, you could get the center out intact. Dean was really good at it.
"If you want to be as safe as I can make you, wake us. Nothing but Death and God will find its way through the wards I make with the physical world."
"I know this wasn't the plan, but I want your fingers inside me. I feel good this time." Dean turned to kiss what seemed like thin air, but he could have sworn was warmth radiating from his shoulder. He was pretty sure he felt something around that handprint - which shouldn't have been possible, since whatever Cas did had fried those nerve endings. "Was that Cas or do I look stupid?"
want Cas to leave. If Cas left, he was going to have to call someone. Sammy. He was going to have to call Sammy. Dean didn't know if he could forgive Cas if he had to do that. There were some things his little brother shouldn’t know, and what happened with Alastair was top of the list.
"Probably shouldn't be telling you this over the phone, but you remember the Roadhouse?" It was a lifetime ago for Dean, but it had only been a few years for Sam. "I wasn't flirting with Jo. I wasn't interested. Also, she wasn't into
With more than a little regret, he brought a hand to one of Castiel's wrists and moved it away from his ass, to rest at the small of his back. It had been fine, it had been
Jimmy stilled, closed his eyes, took a few calming breaths. Gently, he slid his fingers out of Dean.
Dean decided to let this play out. Meanwhile, he stole a kiss and a plate before Jimmy could react. "Thanks babe."
"Cas is fine. Pretty sure he likes the idea of taking my last name though. Maybe a fake ID? Or a passport, that would be classy. I know, a bunch of passports! Like the Bourne movies!"
Castiel was making intense eye contact. He didn’t usually do that for whole conversations. Normally, he talked facing odd directions and let Dean talk to the side of his head. Which meant he was probably doing it for Dean’s benefit, but this was already not going to be an easy talk. Dean closed his eyes. He wished he could do this sitting next to him, so they could be close but not have to
Jimmy smiled, a big goofy smile. "I'll let him know." He flopped backwards onto the pillows, crossed his arms behind his head, and gazed up at the ceiling."This -" he made a vague hand gesture at the room. "This has been good for us. Our, you know. Relationship."
"Cas, sit. I'll find you something to wear... assuming that's okay with Sam?" His tone dared Sam to say otherwise. Cas might be fine but Jimmy had been seriously freaked out. The least he could do was find the guy a pair of sweatpants that would be way too long on him.
. Lifting his head slightly, Dean claimed his angel’s lips. The kiss didn't start out possessive, or demanding, but certainty was written into every movement of lips and tongue.
"Shh," Dean placed his thumb on Cas’ bottom lip. "Trust me, okay? Can you get this nice and wet for me?"
"No, don't you get it? You've stitched me back together. I don't have to choose between Claire and Castiel anymore. You... gave me both."
"I know. I wasn't doing a bit either. I'm just stuck up here driving." Dean tossed the folded up trench coat at him. "But if you and Cas wanted to fuck in the backseat? Wouldn't complain."
Dean was suddenly very aware of the fact this was Cas. And Cas was shirtless. Straddling him. Dean had thought about this. He'd be lying if he said he hadn’t, but he had expected it to be sexy. Instead, it was breathtaking. Dean could feel how small he was on a cosmic scale and yet Cas was
His dad would know what to do. He'd know how to fix this. But Dad was dead, and Bobby was paralyzed and Sam was in danger and Dean had just lost the only friend he'd had in a long time and now he didn't even have his car.
"No. You're family now. If anything happened to you, we’d salt and burn you properly. You want to leave? You can leave. But you're not allowed to die. If I could swing a Tibetan sky burial, I'd do that if Cas wanted, but I'm not hunting something wearing your face."
"I uh... I might need your help here.” This wasn't easy for Dean to say, but he had to try. "Cas was... I couldn't hurt Cas. This is... We’re getting married. We get to spend the rest of our lives together. We can take things slow. We’ve got time.”
Jimmy smiled, a little wickedly. But in the next moment, it was actually Cas that caught Dean in his arms, and lowered him down to the mattress, one hand heavy on his shoulder. Jimmy was somewhere lower. Dean could feel the lace around his waist riding up, the garters keeping everything in place. He had his view blocked by Cas' kissing, so he couldn't really see.
doing it. Dean's thoughts were muffled. It took work to make them form words. It probably wasn't worth the trouble. He'd rather just float here.
Dean enjoyed the feel of their cocks sliding past one another, separated only by a thin layer of lace. His hands found their way to Jimmy's absolutely
Jimmy bent his head to lay one soft, lingering kiss just inside Dean's thigh, then broke away, and raised his head to look at him. "One more?"
"I'm supposed to be sexy and fun but I’m just broken and gross. And really pissed off, because I want to have sex with my fiance and I can't. Even when I
"They're going to be mad at you. Claire and Amelia. Claire will probably take a while to trust you. But that's okay. She's allowed. And Amelia - is actually easier. We were never, I mean..."
"Shit. I can't fucking do this anymore." He didn't look at Cas. Couldn't deal with the confirmation that he'd been used and thrown away
“I like... some of that,” he said, carefully. “Earlier, in the shower, and after when you dried me off? That was good. I like it when you lead and all I have to do is go along.”
Sam was very much there, leaning against the strange non-entrance entrance with his floofy hair and looking way too pleased with himself.
Ketch cautiously edged closer to them, treating Cas like a big unfriendly cat. Cas tracked him, watching him - but it looked like he was okay with letting him adjust Dean's pillows, and tilt him up so he could drink. Dean downed half of the bottle of water in one go, and Cas watched the muscles in his throat move, as he swallowed.
until he was surrounded by golden points, all moving, all forming intricate petals and tendrils that folded around each other, around Dean and Jimmy, making triangles and angles that were also organic crescents and cascades. The brightest and most intricate petals formed behind Cas’ shoulders, backlighting his face. Now shadowed, it was like Dean could see him from several angles at once. Not all his faces looked alike. Not all of his faces looked human.
Castiel may have slightly smirked. Bending down, he got one arm around Dean, firmly in the center of his back, and lifted. He held Dean slanted, halfway between sitting and lying down, taking all of his weight on a forearm.
"What you want and what he wants line up pretty good. That’s probably why you haven't run into this problem before. I think he's been leaning on you to... help him want things? Let him be allowed to want things? I'm seeing what
He heard typing sounds from the background on Sam's end. “So you were hunting a... naked... kleptomaniac... ghost?”
sexy cadence - "On a scale of one to ten..." Pause for effect. "How confused is Cas right now?" He had to bite his lip to keep from breaking character. He was out of his jacket now, and playing with the hem of his shirt. Probably he should keep it on. It
Part of him was terrified he would wake up back in the cold, in pain and alone. If all of this turned out to be just a really good dream - he wasn’t coming back from that.
Sam sat behind him, still wary. He glanced over Dean's bent head. Looked at Cas in his bathrobe. "Who am I talking to. Cas or Jimmy?"
Distantly, voices. "I don’t know. I don't - he's not making sense at all, he's... begging." A second garbled, artificial voice.
"I'd kill for a pair of sweatpants," Jimmy said to the dark room. He shifted in bed, and turned towards Dean.
"You want some help over there? If you want you can just wear the t-shirt?" Dean would miss the tie, but Cas would keep Jimmy from getting cold, and he could always appreciate the view.
"Hey." Jimmy’s voice. He took a long exhale, and flopped down so his head rested his head in the dip of Dean's shoulder. “Castiel is a little confused right now. But he'll be okay." Kneaded Dean's bicep, a tiny unconscious gesture. "How you doing?"
Cas tried to put a little space between them, but Dean's arms weren't letting him go. So instead, their angel stayed exactly still, in his arms.
Okay. Not dirty talk. That was a relief. They really needed to focus on the basics first. Communication. What felt good, what didn’t. Jimmy could probably help with some of that. This was his body. But then again...
And then - when Dean realized what he’d just said - the air left his lungs in a rush. Like he'd been punched.
"That thing where he was showing off with his telekinesis. You didn't like that. And - oh I'm so dumb."
Dean's hips moved without his permission. "For real? This is - like you say 'I need to do some research’ or whatever, and then you come back with
Dean was struck by a sudden thought. "We have a literal angel here. We could probably get married right now.” He hadn't really thought that through. "That's stupid. Forget I said anything. I'm just happy. Sometimes I say stupid things."
"Hey buddy." He put a hand on Dean’s shoulder, but only made contact for about a second before pulled it back. "Sorry. You were putting on clothes and... "
Dean did he best to seem unaffected. "Look, I get that I'm not the man Dad wanted me to be, I do. But I thought –" He took a deep breath, it didn't help much. "I'm not Dad. I
"No - look, I don't know. We're figuring this out. It's up to him. And whatever we do, we wait until we know it’s safe. I promised I'd get him back to Claire alive, and I meant it."
Then, eventually, the hand left his back, and the shower shut off. And there was a fluffy towel around him. Cas rubbed slow, methodical circles against his shoulders, neck, hair. Against his arms and back. Dean finally let go of his death grip, let himself lean into Cas’ touch, until Cas was supporting all his weight.
Dean nodded. It seemed like wanting wasn't enough lately, but they could try. "I think I mostly want to get going before any more of your extended family show up. I'll call Sam. Find out where we're headed."
Dean was living for the noises Jimmy was making, and the way he was making good on his promise to keep taking. Because nothing else
This was just one of those things. Dean didn't have to understand what it was like to share that sort of connection to know what a big deal this was. He let them have their moment, and just enjoyed that he was allowed to be a part of it. It felt strangely voyeuristic in a way that nothing else had.
"You're so good to me, Daddy." He was pretty sure he sounded ridiculous, but he couldn’t make himself care. He felt like laughing from how goddamn happy he was. "Sorry. I'm just..." More laughter. "Really happy right now. I'll calm down, I swear. I just really friggin' love you guys."
Cas wanted to keep him. Dean wanted that too. He wanted it more than anything. He looped his arms around Cas' waist and snuggled into the embrace.
"It’s good he talks to you about that stuff. It's okay that he doesn't talk to me. I didn't know them. You at least got to meet them. And sure he misses them, even the a-holes. They're still your family. If that ever happened to me I'd-"
"I'll say,” said Jimmy. “Well. I've just had the best sex of my life. I've just had the most amazing orgasm of my life. I know that asking you to marry me was the smartest thing I've ever done. How are you?"
Jimmy was curled up into Cas' body, away from him. Cas reached into the tight unhappy mound, and tilted up his chin. Looked into Jimmy’s eyes, then let him curl back down - this time, with an arm around him.
"Give him." Sam's voice. He was somewhere else. He knew he was stuck but couldn’t escape his head on his own. He managed to surface enough to speak, but not to put any thought into it. Which is why he ended up with, "This sucks."
Jimmy took Dean by the shoulders, and looked at him seriously. Reached over his shoulder, to turn off the water.
Dean knew he should say something good, something important, but the only thing he could think of was - "we're gonna be like a sexy Russian nesting doll."
Dean ran fingernails across Castiel's scalp before bringing his hand to rest, fingers threading through the hair at the back of his neck. "I'm a foolish guy." Dean locked eyes with him, used a feather-light touch to draw his thumb across the soft skin there.
“I accessed the Kansas City Police servers. Those are the only reports I’m seeing that look like our kind of thing?”
"People make mistakes. You tried. That's all anyone can do." This wasn't just about Jimmy. Even if Dean wasn't going to admit that.
It took Dean a second to realize that Hanlon's Razor must be another one of those logic things Sam liked. Not an occult artifact.
. Found Jimmy’s face, and ran a hand down his neck until it got to his tie. “Look, I get the whole not-getting-up thing, but no way you’re not sick of this by now." Dean started to pull at the tie, but he was at an angle and using his non-dominant hand so wasn't making much progress. "You could take your shoes off." His feet hurt just thinking about standing around in dress shoes that long. "Or make Cas do it."
The admission cost him a lot. He felt his face burning. So much for Dean Winchester, Sex God and envy of all. It wasn't
Jimmy had started to kiss down his neck, and was getting a little handsy, feeling up Dean's ass. Cas played the perfect gentleman, running hands along the outside of his thighs, past his hips, up to his waist. So it was sort of funny when he felt Jimmy and Cas briefly clasp hands, against his skin.
turns on, and the TV gets louder and I think I got raised by some freaky-ass tech-necromancer or something."
Dean felt like he was watching everything from slightly further back than he should be. His stomach felt weightless.
his poor, aching and abused cock and started to kiss Dean's chest clean instead - which was very hot, and would have been
"I'm dreaming, aren't I?" Dean had always been able to lucid dream. It was a useful skill. Not all monsters came for you while you were awake. "Are you two real, or did I dream you too?"
"You'd look good in them. Pretty sure you look good in most things. Even that trench coat. But you look damn fine naked too."
He listened to the beautiful slow sound of Dean's calm breathing, and was glad that angels did not sleep.
Dean didn't dignify that with a response. Instead he ground against Cas, hoping the angel would get the message and help him out of the rest of his clothes. As far as dreams went, this one didn't seem all that profound.
Cas stroked Dean's hips before holding them there, solid. He bent down to Dean's cock again, and this time began to kiss teasingly up the shaft, and drop a single kiss right on the head that wasn't nearly enough.
Carefully, like he couldn't really believe he was allowed to touch, Dean brought his hands up and rested them there, thumbs gently massaging his way down from the back of Jimmy's balls until he had a decent handful of ass in both hands. Then he spread him apart to get a good view of what he was working with.
"I want to eat you out. Suck your cock. Open you up. Make love to you. Whatever makes you feel good."
shows up. Blows all the windows in on me. I think he just wanted to say hi, but got kind of excited."
Caught between the two of them like this, Dean felt surrounded by warmth and love. Closing his eyes, he let himself relax so that they supported his weight. Resting his head against Jimmy, leaning back into the comforting weight of Cas, Dean focused entirely on that feeling of safety. The lace moved against his skin and Jimmy and Cas moved around him. The two of them had chosen Dean for some reason, even after everything that had happened in Hell. Too much. Beyond words. But he still tried.
Jimmy took his hands. Looked down at them. Dean could only see his eyelashes, but he suddenly seemed very shy. "For better, for worse," he murmured.
Walking out of the bathroom, he looked like a low budget Carmen Miranda cosplay with the bright red sweatshirt-dress and the towel wrapped around his head. Sam was sitting on the edge of a bed with truly offensive floral sheets which he had mostly turned into a firearm maintenance surface.
He could probably just use the trench coat as a pillow. And pillows were a luxury, so all things considered he had a pretty nice setup going on here. "I'm tired of being used and then treated like crap, you know? Family's great. They don't just friggin abandon you after you tear your heart out for them. I feel like that poor dude at the end of
Dean kissed Jimmy, and the hand playing with his cock moved lower. No rush. He paid attention to every little similarity and difference in the way Cas and Jimmy liked to be touched. And there were differences.
Sitting crossed legged in the middle of the bed, Dean glared at Cas. It was a lot less effective than he would have liked, since he had to use a corner of the blanket to wipe his face. "If you actually plan on staying this time, could you do me a favor?"
Jimmy's hand came up and around to the back of his shoulder, and Dean felt like he could breathe a bit more easily. Pressing close to Cas, he tried to memorize this moment as best he could. Didn't dare ask for more.
He felt Ketch steal a kiss against the back of a shoulder-blade. Then curled closer against his spine, and Cas let him. Dean was pressed between them, and they both had an arm around his waist.
Dean felt his heart melt. He was so hopelessly in love and wasn’t entirely sure when or how it had happened. They'd be okay. It wouldn't be easy, but they would figure things out.
Jimmy sighed happily. "Just tell me how you picture me. Am I talking, not talking? Keeping my hands to myself?"
"More than I trust myself." Warily, cautiously, Jimmy’s head touched Dean's shoulder. "God help me. I trust you."
Dean smiled up at them, and ran his hand appreciatively up strong muscles to get to Ketch's bicep. "Cas takes some getting used to." He was more teasing than reassuring.
was to bask in the afterglow and cuddle Cas. "Maybe that’s not such a great idea? I mean, I'm not exactly out yet. And it doesn't sound like you’re talking just a tiny nibble."
“What, why – Oh, right.” His brain caught up with his mouth. “You didn't know what edging was. Look, I haven't
"I can give them some anti-possession necklaces. I’d feel better about a tattoo, but that’s Lisa’s call." Dean turned, and rested his forehead against Jimmy. Now was the hard part. "It wasn't a demon that took Ben.” He was going to have to
Jimmy’s fingers curled down to Dean's groin one more time. He shifted position, mostly as an excuse to illustrate how hard he was. "You didn't exactly give us a straight answer," he whispered, kissing Dean’s neck. He gave the inside of the thigh he was holding a quick squeeze. Dean gasped, had to bite his lip to keep from accidentally saying "Daddy" again, like a good boy.
I was meaning to tell you. Castiel and I did this experiment earlier, around the time he - well, around the time he was sucking your cock. Turns out, he can absolutely manually relax discrete muscle groups!"
"So good, Dean. Such a good boy. You accept my vessel's body so well." Cas had both of them now, and absentmindedly reached up to touch Jimmy's hair.
want you to kiss me and... what you said. But I don't - " Dean abruptly stopped talking and pulled Cas into a hug. He could feel his ears burning. He was trying to figure out what exactly was bothering him, and felt like he was missing something obvious.
“I guess he could have been making fun of me. That might make more sense. God, I'm an idiot. He had this whole thing planned! Those markings on our ribs." Dean looked at his chest, knowing that somewhere under his skin, it probably said 'property of Castiel.’ He couldn't read that stuff. "Like... it could be worse. He didn't try to castrate me with his teeth or make me call him Daddy, but he wrote on you too. That's just sick. Why'd he have'ta bring you into this?"
"So an idea here? Cas, I'm thinking that it might be good for you to get to know Jimmy's body too? If he’s up for that. I can give you guys your space, or stay. I mean I'd like to stay, but if you don't want me to stay I get it. Only..." Dean trailed off as Cas' eyes went from confused, to the fuzzed-out non-focus of the Cas-Jimmy in-between.
"Never better." And he meant it. He meant it so damn much. His dad had never broken in Hell. And now maybe Dean knew why.
"Did you finger yourself and imagine it was me? I'm betting no, but you were so good to me earlier. Like you knew what you were doing. So either you've done it before, or you've thought about it a lot."
Dean's hands slid down to grab Jimmy's ass instead. "I am definitely going to want to try that sometime. Someday, when you're not the sexiest dream I've ever had. I want to bury myself inside you and kiss the place where you and Cas meet while I fuck you until you come."
Cas was a work of art, his face and chest flushed from sex, his hair sticking up at strange angles. Dean moaned around the cock in his mouth before pulling off to let it slide against the side of his face. He knew what he must look like, as he worshiped between Castiel’s thighs. He had thought Castiel might throw his head back, but no - there he was, eyes on Dean. He was transfixed. Every jolt and shudder from Cas’ body traveled into his own. He could only hold out for so long before taking himself in hand.
Dean opened his eyes again so he could see the look on Cas' face. Calm, comfortable, and focused. Dean was glad he'd told him to wait because it was hard to relax under a look that intense. It took him a few deep breaths before he could get his body to cooperate again.
Slowly, and very deliberately, Cas took the corset from Dean. Hesitated with it a moment. Then folded it away into its box, and slid the box safely under the bed. He laid himself across Dean's chest, head over his heart like he was listening for a pulse.
"Do you think he’d want to try overstimulation? I’m not usually into it but if I can use it to get us a mini makeout session…?"
"He says no and I don't know if it's a 'he can't' or an 'abuse of his power,' but he does say he can make me warmer."
"Thanks." Dean's voice cracked. He curled up even smaller and hid his face again. "Sorry. Keep talking?"
"So if I get this right, this should be intense. But if anything starts feeling bad, or even just weird in a way you don't like, stop me. Okay?"
"Think we should do this more often." Dean was really appreciating the view. "You look sexier like this. Together. It's hot."
Dean's only reply was to fall back against the mattress, and throw an arm over his eyes, face turned skywards as he gave an irritated groan. The muscles of his abs fluttered involuntarily. He laughed.
"Baby, I can do that. That's easy. You're doing such a great job." He really was. Dean was so proud of him. But he thought mentioning that would sound patronizing, so he didn't say anything. Even if he really wanted to.
"It's going to build a lot slower and it might be a bit of a surprise when it hits. It's more of a whole-body thing. So if you feel like you're made of jello afterwards that's totally fine. Don't worry. I'll get you through. Don't worry about me, I've got this, and I've got you."
A fire. A hospital room. His brother screaming from down the hall. A body. A crossroads. Dogs he shouldn't have been able to see. Pain. A knife in his hand. A sunken room with a drain in the floor that was backed up more often than not. A pool of blood that reached his ankles. Burning pain in his shoulder and something with wings and impossible edges hidden in the shape of a man. A box and too much earth. Another body, this one partially eaten. Someone is wearing Sam and a white suit in a garden where nothing can live.
