This time was different. He was broken. The more he injected, the less he felt. The more he faded back into the darkest corner of his mind. He had been here too long.
He came back for Sherlock. However, everything had been turned on its head. Conversations were awkward, short. Sherlock didn't want to interact. John felt as if any movement or conversation would cause the very foundations of his and Sherlock's relationship to collapse. It was tough.
Loneliness. John. He lifted the syringe, ready to inject. Ready for the biggest rush of his body and mind.
"So what? Neither's smoking." He pulled a cigarette out of his sleeve. "Do you have a lighter? Oh, that's right...you don't smoke."
Yet he didn't really want to believe it. Then he decided to come back to Sherlock. To do the best he could to help him, even if he would be hopeless at it. Physical wounds - fine. He knew that. He could do that. Part of the reason why he persuaded himself to come back was because he knew he was very good in that area. He also knew there was more to why he came back, yet he didn't want to admit that quite yet.
Yes, he could patch up Sherlock's wounds. He would. He'd do the best job he could. But he couldn't heal Sherlock's mind, no matter how much he wanted to.
How did he get here? He didn't remember. A slight panic rose up in his throat. It was all wrong, all wrong, too wrong. He stopped suddenly, and stared back into the darkness of the room, remembering. John. John had gone and Sherlock had cared a lot.
But he soon forgot about that. As he gently pushed the door open, he was greeted with a homely, familiar face.
"Sherlock. I'm going to help you. You need to let me. I trust you, you know that. I'm going to help you with your fever and your injuries. But you've got to trust me, too." It became harder for John to find the right words as the expression on Sherlock's face turned from pain and fear to plain confusion. "We'll do it right this time. Me and you, together. I'm such a cock-I thought I'd hurt you by staying. I'm not going to let you down, ever again. Ever. Okay? You mean more to me than that. More than you could ever know."
"I'm feeling that fear again, Sherlock. God, I must be so blind. Come on. I want to start over. Rewind. Please."
As the morning sunlight cast an orange glow across the Baker Street living room, the two men sat across from each other in their respective chairs. It felt natural and good and both were completely at ease. It was a sorrowful morning.
John felt tears run down his cheek, and the only thing that felt natural was to wrap his arms around Sherlock's wiry body. Sherlock returned the gesture.
"...I know. I know. It's hard-"  Sherlock's voice cracked and John immediately wrapped an arm around him.
John couldn't do anything but laugh, not sardonically but out of a blissful confusion. Sherlock Holmes was a mystery, but John realised how lucky they both were to have each other.  They were ready again, to have that life again. Yet now it was different, there would be no chance for either of them to go too off the rails without the other holding them back. They were together, a unit. Just as it should be. It was neat, tidy and clean.
"Oh Christ, Sherlock." He could hear the fear, the rawness of John's throat, "You're not going to do this to me now, not again."
Sherlock gasped violently and opened his eyes. And there he was, John Watson. He ran a gentle hand over Sherlock's face. The touch would usually have repelled Sherlock but this time he closed his eyes and leaned into it, gulping down any emotion. When he opened his eyes again John was still staring.
He shouted out in defeat. He balled his hands into a fist and released them repeatedly before picking at his lips deep in thought. From an outsider's perspective, he was clearly a madman. Quick, frenzied movements with no pattern or real clear reason for these behaviours were visible to anybody how happened to pop in on him. Mrs Hudson was increasingly worried about the detective.
"I do know that. Believe me." Sherlock wiped away a tear, choking out sobs of agony and relief. John held him, and understood completely what those wretched sobs meant.
Sherlock was trying as hard as he could to be an asshole. He hoped the more he was rude and the more he acted ignorant, the more John would just return to how it was before. Before the Fall. Before that.
"No, no. I don't mean it like that. Let me help you." John crouched by the man, now holding his face in both of his hands. "Please."
Sherlock staggered up, outraged. He swung a fist at the man, who quickly dodged and threw a punch back. The fist hit Sherlock straight in the eye. It stung sharp and he could feel the heat around it, swelling up, ugly.
Someone was calling out to him. He knew exactly who it was, but it couldn't be real. He wouldn't let it be.
. He screamed to himself. John understood. He took Sherlock's hand in both of his and pressed his face against it. Relief flooded through them both.
Sherlock frowned, and panic rose in his chest. Is that all he was? A patient? After everything that happened...It hurt him, more than the pain in his head or back. Frustration built up in his chest, anger at himself. Why did he feel so hurt, when he had decided he wasn't good enough for John? This cycle of conflicting feelings had raged and fought within him since he had returned, and it didn't look like it was going to stop any time soon.
"No!" Sherlock jumped up from his chair, jolting at the pain in his back. "No painkillers." He held an arm out to John.
"Please don't do this to me." Sherlock's voice caught in his throat, casting his gaze to the floor. John paused in the doorway, his heart sinking deep down into his stomach.
Sherlock hesitated but nodded. John turned it off immediately and retrieved a candle from the kitchen.
"Yes." Sherlock nodded, indignant. "And you've done a pretty good job. Look," Sherlock stretched his back and patted it, "Hardly felt that."
"I owe you many thanks, John. This is the end of all my past troubles, tears, pain. I owe you a hell of a lot, I realise that now."
"It's fine." Sherlock turned his face away, so he wasn't staring at John's face. The light made his head spin.
"Stop." The playful tone in Sherlock's voice vanished immediately. "I'm not going to talk about it."
John frowned and reached out a hand but didn't touch him; he was ready to support Sherlock if he stumbled, "Sherlock? What's wrong?"
John. Where was he? Sherlock hobbled up off the couch, gritting his teeth at the feeling of being as vulnerable as a little old man. His back ached like hell, but he wasn't ready to discuss that. He doubted he ever would. Just let it go, he told himself. Ignore it. Sherlock fumbled for the light switch, muttering swear words under his breath but eventually managed to flip it on. He nearly jumped ten feet in the air in fright as the light illuminated John's face, who was standing in the doorway.
As he pulled himself up out of bed his whole body ached. Sherlock had been grateful for the lack of nightmares, which he pinned on that warm feeling he had gotten in his belly at John's touch as he drifted off to sleep.
"I need to help, no matter what you think of yourself. Okay?" John took a serious tone he reserved for uncooperative patients.
"Well, you're home now. We are home now, both of us." John spoke softly, tenderly. He was not angry, how could he be? "Wait a minute, wait."
Later that evening, Sherlock awoke with a headache. His weakness which had shown the day before made guilt and shame grow heavy on his shoulders. He blinked in the darkness, trying to readjust his senses to try and make sense of everything which he had been feeling.
"No, John. Please. Just let me-" Sherlock cut himself off with a frustrated sigh and slumped back into his chair. He ran a hand through his hair and clamped a hand over his face as a mask.
Out of the darkness, something grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him violently. He gasped and moaned, but remained in the darkest corner of his mind. Serbia. The smell of sweat and blood, the straining of the metal as it clinked against the bricks. The moans and laughs mixed with the pained grunts and screams. Flesh which had been torn, mangled, whipped and scratched. Nails pulled and teased. Hair pulled. Blood. The whole scene played out in front of him again and again, night after night. The torture hadn't left him. Something grabbed him again, gentler this time. Gentle, but pleading.
Sherlock felt so human now. It hurt him. He didn't deserve this, not John. Sherlock covered his face with his hands and John quaked at the image in front of him, resembling a scared child.
"Right." John's voice was soft and Sherlock's heart melted. "Take these." John pressed two pills into Sherlock's palm and passed him the glass.
. Sherlock took a couple of stumbling steps forward before collapsing by his chair. He couldn't believe it. Sherlock reached a hand out to test his faith, to see if it was really happening. John took it, and it was real. Sherlock felt John's arms around him, lifting up as delicately as possible and placed him in his chair which he immediately fell back into.
Sherlock gave the slightest nod of his head. However, John had notices the strange twist of expression - for a moment, Sherlock breathed heavy, and the pain in his eyes sent a dagger straight to his own heart. Was he having some sort of flashback? John's stomach plummeted.
Over the next few days, John hardly slept himself. Mrs Hudson inquired, sighed, sobbed and eventually cried with happiness as Sherlock began to show signs of his old self. Even Lestrade, on visiting refrained from making jokes, and instead looked pained at the sight of the broken man who occasionally stirred for food or drink. Yet John was encouraged with every day that passed, and by the start of the next week this hope was justified. Sherlock emerged from his room one morning, shaved and clean and groomed and most of all, smiling.
The tension is electric, and John looks furious and miserable. “Oh, believe me, I will. What was that about last night, Sherlock? Since when do you cut me out of your work with Lestrade? That text you sent—that was utter shite, and you know it.”
“So you just daydream while I talk? Very flattering, John.” He tried to sound peeved, but failed utterly, and his hands roaming over John’s arse would have given away the pretence anyway.
Last but not least: I always ask for fic recs in the comment boxes, and haven't done so yet. I've been hesitant about reading pandemic-related fics, for personal reasons; but I'd love to know which pandemic or quarantine fics have been sustaining in this difficult year. An AO3 link is a blessed timesaver if possible.
“I meant no insult, John. You’ve done very well. They may be counting on you communicating something to Sherlock—if they’re not certain he’s alive, they may think that alarming you is the best way to settle that open question.”
bedroom) to pack up his grip. Three to four minutes later he’d stride past the door to the sitting room, pound down the stairs calling “bye” or “later” or some equally off-putting farewell that fairly shouted “don’t ask me anything.”
He looked amused. “I said, I don’t have much of an appetite this evening. I rarely do. Don’t take it personally.”
“Told me what?” Her expression stayed calm but her voice had gone up in pitch: she was nervous. Perhaps Moran made a habit of not telling her things.
Lying on our green sofa, me behind with Sherlock sprawled out in my arms. It’s nineish, Rosie’s upstairs and out like a light; I’m exhausted, heaven knows why, it’s been a quiet kind of home day. If we got anything done at all beyond keeping a two-year-old in a sunny mood and out of trouble, I can’t call it to mind. Odd, really. When did we become
Which was its own kind of complication. Lacking a comfortable cushion of family money, John—unlike Sherlock—actually
With his usual high-intensity focus Sherlock examined the body, its clothing, the rope, the various marks on the floor, snapping out questions to the witless officers and glaring at the slow and uncertain answers. He opened a new mental file and began filling it with every datum and query and hypothesis he could extract from the scene, then asked to speak with the housekeeper.
Performance was everything, Sherlock reminded himself. Feign normalcy. Composure. Control. When he could finally hold a pipette without trembling, shave without cutting himself, text at normal speed—then he might begin to go out again, to NSY, to Barts. The first time would be awkward; everyone would be remembering his last time there, scruffy, shaking and delusional.
The clatter of tea mugs, the gurgle of water filling the kettle distracted John, until he remembered.
Sherlock seemed surprisingly uncomfortable, even uneasy, at the prospect of playing music he still knew so well.

I wasn’t sure how Sherlock would respond to the Italian cop, or for that matter how I would. The more I thought about it, having anyone on secondment from Rome promised to be a gigantic pain in the arse. I expected, I don’t know, some kind of walking caricature warbling opera tunes and complaining about English food.
." All this while stroking his beautiful ribboned back, cupping and stroking his bollocks, loving the high, tight density of them in my palm, circling his gorgeous cock with my fist, feeling him do the same to me, sparks building in my field of vision, a kind of icy-hot shower starting low in my gut and building to an explosion.
Not for the first time I reflected on the peculiar Italian-ness of Italy, cast into sharp relief by my being half-English. Italy was irrevocably different from Anglophone lands. But if there was more sense of a shared purpose in my mother’s country, a collective identity, Italy did have all the virtues of her defects: her own unmistakable advantages. Italy insisted on what was due to the individual; to the beautiful; to the excellent; to the singular; to the here and now. And at the moment, Italy was insisting that the suppliant be helped.
John stared at Sherlock, his eyebrows furrowing and his eyes searching the man for an explanation. Sherlock gave him a little nod and then returned his attention to the woman.
Once the car was parked in the nearby car park, Sherlock rejoined John outside of the hotel and then they headed into the lobby to check in.
John grabbed Sherlock’s arms, removing them from his arse and placed them over Sherlock’s head and then rolled him onto his back. He straddled Sherlock’s body and stared down at the man underneath of him. He bent down and pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s lips. Breathless, Sherlock stared back. John licked his lips.
They kissed for what felt like a frozen moment in time before Sherlock pulled away, looking at John. John smiled and pulled Sherlock in for another kiss, this one lasting less time, but more forceful.
He stared at the blank side wall for a bit before he heard footsteps approach the room. He turned his head at the sound and caught sight of Bond walking with Lestrade both dressed in suits and carrying coffee. He smiled.
Ribbons of white flowed over John's hand as Sherlock tensed and thrust up, riding out the waves of pleasure that washed over him. He arched his back, pushing himself into John’s hand once again before falling back to the bed as if the bones had been taken from his body.
'We have been over this. I know the risks, and I am willing to take them.' Mycroft interrupted. He turned and sat in his desk chair, finally looking up at Anthea. 'I know you're worried about what’s going to happen. But, I have planned this out very carefully.'
Sherlock remained silent, his head resting under his mess of black curly hair on the kitchen table among what looked to be a petri dish of mold. They’d be having words about that at a later date, John mentally noted.
“How about,” he began, “a life for a life. I’ve spared Mister Borrello-- you can only do the same for John. Or I can very easily reverse that decision and place bullet through his frontal lobe” Sherlock knelt down next to Matteo, placing the gun next his temple.
'Really? You're unbelievable sometimes,' John responded. He quickly stood from the table to head toward his room on the second floor. He hadn't made it far when Sherlock called out.
He pulled the keys from his pocket and pressed the button. The Aston Martin’s lights blinked and Q smiled, increasing his pace toward the car and forcing Bond to break into a light jog to keep up. They each opened their doors and got in, a smile beginning to cross Bond’s face.
'It was a different time,' Q said, his voice neutral, but dripping with the smug tone of his first encounter with Bond.
John stared at himself in the mirror and sighed. This was the last thing he had intended to wear to a party, but upon Sherlock's insistence, he gave in. He never saw himself wearing suits. He thought they made him look like he was trying too hard.
“Sergei Potyomokin. The most connected man in Europe at the moment. The boy to his left is Matteo Borrello. He’s highly connected with the Italians and also Sergei’s most trusted friend. Rumours say the two are lovers. I confirm that they are. The man next to Matteo is Lukas Konig, who has connections to the Germans. I’m actually unsure as to what Konig is doing here with the other two.  ”
“We’re heading back London. Mycroft phoned this morning. The case is being taken over by MI6.” He continued to stare ahead, avoiding eye contact with John.
Sherlock turned to face them, bringing the gun to rest at his side. “No. We wouldn’t want that.” He looked at John, a sense of resignation growing in his eyes. Then a light came into them and Sherlock smirked.
“Very good. Here it is. You’re in one of our riverside rooms,” she said, typing rapidly into the computer.”Pavel can take your luggage for you and here are all of your documents. Have a pleasant stay and enjoy your honeymoon."
'But, why would he do that? He likes facts and I know you told him we were, but I assumed Mycroft would just look at me and know that it was all a lie.'
The room began to shake more violently and Sherlock turned to look at Mycroft, Q, and Bond and then down at his own hands. He watched as they flickered and started to become translucent.
It had been a simple comment to his friend, Mike Stamford, in the park about needing a flatmate and then spiral of events had begun. He found himself moving in with one, Sherlock Holmes, rather quickly and soon he was joining Sherlock as they chased after criminals in London on cold, rainy nights. He found himself on crime scenes with the Met looking at cases that appeared unsolvable, and all the while blogging about it for his therapist and the world to read. Then, when he thought he had finally sorted out his life, he was burying his best friend, only to discover he wasn’t actually dead after all.
John tapped his fingers against the side of his leg and then squeezed his hands into tight fists. He took a deep breath and then turned away. 'That's fine,' he said. 'If you don't want to tell me what's wrong, you don't have to. I'm going to bed. I'll see you when I see you.'
“So, what’s the plan?” he whispered in Sherlock’s ear, hoping that the kiss would make their cover a bit more convincing.
He moved back slightly, settling his position more over Sherlock’s knees and then ran his hand over Sherlock’s trousers, feeling the strain of Sherlock’s cock against the fabric. He smirked slightly, and then reached for Sherlock’s belt and began unbuckling it.
After dessert and coffee in the sitting room, which was also very normal, John and Sherlock said their goodbyes to Mycroft and Lestrade and made their way toward the door and the car that awaited them in the drive way.
“I’m afraid, Mister Holmes, I can tell you will not be cooperative and thus you leave me no choice.”
“How can I help you?” the young woman behind the desk asked, moving her short brown hair behind her left ear. Her English was smooth, but tinged with the native Czech.
'I’m sorry,' the blonde doctor said. 'We’re seeing a problem in your head. We can’t release you. We’re going to need to run another test to make sure it isn’t something serious.'
He muttered something briefly in Russian and Lukas pulled the gun away from John’s head. John released Sergei’s arm and moved swiftly to stand next to Sherlock, while Sergei moved to his feet again.
“Will you at least talk to me?” John shouted after Sherlock, taking the stairs to his flat two at a time.
Sherlock stood at the window, parting the curtains only slightly as he did on Baker Street, and  looked out across the river at the clay red rooftops of the city. John turned to watch him.
'Give me that,' John said, grabbing hold of Sherlock’s arm and removing the IV from his arm. 'If you’re not going to wait, at least let an actual doctor do it.'
“Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned off the seat belt sign. You may now gather your belongings and we will begin the departure process.” John closed his eyes and sighed, disappointed at the interruption.
John shook his head and walked into the hallway, returning moments later with Doctor Jones. He waved her toward the bed and she looked at him uncertainly.
John stared at Sherlock's back, biting on his lower lip. Silence hung throughout the room for several minutes before John spoke again.
'Yes, Sir,' Anthea replied. She quickly exited the room and returned with a manila envelope, which she placed on the end of Mycroft’s desk along with a flash drive that she pulled from her skirt pocket. 'All the information you asked for is there.'
Bond watched Lestrade leave and then returned his attention to Q. 'You not return case files? Mister 'please make sure you do your after action report'?'
Doctor Jones looked at John and nodded. She replaced Sherlock’s chart and left the room. Sherlock watched her go and then returned his attention to John.
John smirked and ran his clean hand through Sherlock’s hair. He reached over to the bedside table and grabbed a tissue to clean his hand off. Then he moved closer behind Sherlock, snuggling up and wrapping his arms around him, his half-hard cock pressed against Sherlock’s lower back.
Q stared at him. He searched his head for what happened but found nothing. Bond took a sip of his coffee and his eyes met Q’s.
“I’m not above murder. I’ve taken apart bigger criminal networks than this one. But, if you kill John, I most certainly will kill Mister Borello and I will leave you to suffer at the hands of the British government. I will not give you the same courtesy of death.”
The office was slightly cooler than the rest of the building, but none of its current occupants seemed to notice. Mycroft sat behind his desk, leaning back in his chair slightly, his hands folded across his stomach. He grinned as he watched Sherlock pace back and forth across the room, hands tucked in his pockets, muttering about the botched case. John sat in the chair opposite Mycroft, his back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands folded on his lap.
Sherlock stood up and pulled John up with him as well. Then he nudged John into the aisle. He retrieved their bags from the overhead bin and followed the queue of people exiting the plane, John not far behind looking downtrodden.
'It must,' Harriet said. 'If both timelines had converged, we’d all be disappearing in the same manner as you. There was simply one point, you.'
'This was not at all what I had in mind,' John whispered, brushing his tongue over his lips once again.
'No,' Sherlock responded. He slammed another cabinet door and flopped down into one of the kitchen chairs.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and gently pushed John onto his back. He took his hand and ran it up the length of John’s cock before swirling his palm around the head and then sliding it back down.
Sherlock stood, only briefly making eye contact with John, a look between them that said ‘move’, before he turned the table over. John’s reflexes kicked in immediately as he moved away just before the table hit the ground. Sherlock whirled around and grabbed the gun from Matteo’s hand. He knocked him over the back of the head with it, and Matteo collapsed to the ground in a heap. The girl singing let out a blood curdling scream, dropping the microphone and running toward her friends in the corner of the room who were huddling together.
'No you’re not,' John retorted not looking up from his newspaper. He had seated himself in the visitor's chair across the room and he was still wearing last night's clothing, which meant that John hadn’t left to go home. Not surprising. He would’ve gone home to an empty flat or back to get the last of his stuff from Mary. Of course, this seemed like a better option.
'We were at home discussing the dinner we’d just had with Miss Evans,' he said, looking between John and Doctor Jones.
'You realize what you’re risking?' Anthea said, her voice cold and biting. 'You don’t know what will happen.'
Inside the house, John stared up at the large oil paintings in golden frames that hung on the stark white walls.
'Right, then. Please have the car waiting for me in twenty minutes. No need to call ahead,' Mycroft said.
“It is none of your concern, Mycroft,” Sherlock growled. He flipped his collar up and left, coat billowing behind him.
Sherlock sat on one of the gold fabric-covered chairs, his knees tucked up to his chin with his dressing gown pulled around the rest of his body.
Sherlock took a deep breath and began to pull his hand away, but John wouldn’t let go. He smiled slightly.
The conversation continued with pleasantries and small talk between the two of them while Sherlock continued to look away from John and keep his distance. They talked about Lestrade's latest cases and carefully avoided the subject of Mary and her sudden death. Soon the other guests began to gather round the long table, locating their names on the table cards. Lestrade moved to his assigned seat and dinner was served.
John leaned in and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s once again. Sherlock, then, took hold of John's shoulders and carefully moved them, still engaged in the kiss, through the kitchen toward his bedroom.
John looked up at Sherlock, his breathing heavy and harsh. He grabbed hold of the bedsheets, feeling the smooth cotton between his fingers, and took a deep breath as Sherlock continued his steady thrusting. He felt the stirring of his orgasm growing in his belly and he whimpered slightly as the feeling grew more intense.
Sherlock turned his attention to John. The stare was cold and calculating, and John could feel Sherlock’s annoyance. He turned up the collar on his coat and crossed his arms.
He leaned in and kissed John. It began slowly, a press of lips against one another. Sherlock quickly deepened the kiss. He pulled at John's bottom lip with his teeth and pulled John away from the wall and into his arms.
Sherlock didn’t respond. He continued observing out the window. The people walked about the street below, unaware of the criminals that lurked in the city. He watched as several tourists stopped to take several pictures that would be overexposed of the street signs or of each other.
“Sherlock,” John began, running a hand through Sherlock’s hair, “you mean so much to me. You’re my best friend. I would never choose Mary over you. You’re both important.”
Sherlock pulled the chair out for John and waited for him to sit before sitting himself. John looked around at the other people in attendance, all of whom were still standing around the outer edges of the large dining room talking with one another.
“Don’t play stupid, John. You know exactly what I mean. You’ve got Mary and no matter what we did together last night, you’ll still choose her over me because she’s your wife. Not that I blame you. It is the socially acceptable thing to do….I can’t attach myself to you in that way. Not anymore.” He turned to face John, his eyes slightly damp.
‘Did I take what, Sherlock?’ John asked. He took off his coat and hung it on the hook just inside the door, careful to avoid any of the items on the floor as he stepped inside the flat.
'Why not?' John responded. He took a deep breath and let Sherlock lead him up the stairs and into the house.
Sherlock rolled over and met John’s eyes with a sharp stare. John removed his hand from Sherlock. “I know this is not my fault. I am not the one who fired the shots. I know this very well.”
'Alright,' John said. He pulled his hand back, letting it hang by his side. 'That's still not an answer to the question. Why have you been avoiding me?'
John Watson, a man of medium build with dishwater blonde hair and who considered himself nothing more than average until nearly four years ago, stood on the street outside of 221 Baker Street. He stared up at the large and intimidating black door bearing the numbers, replaying in his mind just how he had happened into this very situation.
He took a deep breath and then reached out, taking Sherlock’s hand and lacing his fingers with his own. Sherlock glanced down at their joined hands and then returned his gaze directly ahead, his expression remaining neutral.
As John entered the flat of 221B, he stopped abruptly, looking around at the more-than-normal chaotic state of the flat. Sofa cushions were overturned, books laid on the floor opened to random pages, and of course, Sherlock Holmes, the dark haired, tall and angled man that he was, was opening up every cabinet in the kitchen.
'You heard me Sherlock Holmes. I didn't realize it until tonight, but there it is. Now what are you going to do about it?'
John looked over at Sherlock and stared. “So, what’s the plan today? Are we tracking Sergei’s next move or--”
'I’ll do my best,' Q responded, doing his best to nudge Bond out the door. Bond took the hint and left, leaving Q alone in his room with nothing but the noises from the hallway, and his thoughts.
John licked his lips and approached carefully. He placed one knee on the bed and hoisted himself up to kneel close to the edge, Sherlock’s back still to him. He stroked a hand down his back, feeling the tension well up under Sherlock’s skin.
The snoring vanished with a snort. 'Sherlock?' John said. 'Sherlock, what’s wrong?'  He leaned forward, rubbing his hands over his face, and eventually setting himself leaning on the edge of the hospital bed.
Sherlock smirked and increased his pace. He reached down, wrapping his long fingers around John's throbbing cock and stroked gently up and down twice, watching as John lost himself over the edge.
Mycroft leaned forward, placing his elbows on his desk. “Thank you, John. I only have one more question and then you may leave.”
Q sighed and looked away from her, his eyes meeting Bond’s. Bond gave him a sympathetic look and Q threw his head back into the pillow with a sigh.
John looked between the two brothers and then he sat back in his chair. He took a drink of his tea, resigning himself to not understand what was happening.
He opened his eyes and quickly surveyed the room as himself. No one was around, but it appeared that his arm was in a sling.  What had happened? He tried to put the pieces back together.

, if he let it slip, and then the thin membrane between The Work and our daughter would entirely dissolve.
His voice was low and a bit husky, as he began to register what I was doing so unhurriedly—nuzzling and nosing his belly, the seams of his thighs, the springy hair around his gorgeously quickening cock. His balls, my God, the feel of them, the scent of him. I wasn’t ever going to get enough of him, so I told him so.
I loved it that he had felt more uninhibited, free to demand, during sex; I wished that during sex, during orgasm, Sherlock could also be more audible and more affectionate, in words and gestures. He still didn’t respond to my tender words and touches in kind, though sometimes he did kiss, and stroke, and smile; he seemed less uncomfortable receiving that kind of intimacy than he had at first.
Soon Sherlock breezed out of the bathroom, dressed for the evening. He pulled up short when he saw Watson, then smiled stiffly. The smile dimmed under Watson’s glower and gruffness. There was no hiding the fact that Watson was deeply jealous, and Sherlock seemed to find it offensive. Whatever Watson came for, he didn’t broach it; whatever Sherlock wished to say, he couldn’t say it in front of me. Just a few minutes later, distracted and abrupt, he hinted me away. I was disappointed, but reluctantly left them to it.
I knew Mycroft would read the two of us like an open book, but I’d no idea that even Lestrade would grin when he saw us come in. Donovan’s eyes widened and then she looked away, lips quirking. So much for our attempt at nonchalance.
But even just walking together in the city was like finally walking without my cane, without a limp. Everything we did or saw or tried to see: no disagreement, and most surprisingly, no petulance or boredom on his part. I’d expected him to flag in his enthusiasm for our time together and start itching for a puzzle. I’d expected him to disappoint me.
“We’ll ring the landlady and release the room. Pick up your gear later.” If John hadn’t left his case neatly packed, he didn’t know the man at all.
One by one I wrote them on the walls of Sherlock’s world, of our flat, on his armour. Yes, even on his coat. On his violin case. On his laptops, on his mobile. On his skin.
When I got in at 3:20 all the lights were out in the hallway and the flat. Well, not surprising after all, the man had to work. (Thought he had to, at any rate.) I could risk a quick shower without waking him, and I didn’t want to get into bed with sweat and smoke and hair gel on me. Once the water got properly hot it felt sublime, and I got out of the shower very reluctantly. I put on an old t-shirt, pyjama bottoms, and dressing gown, and went to sit for awhile. Thought I’d look up Donovan's assailant in NSY’s locked database.
When Sherlock finally speaks again his voice comes out very subdued. “I am so sorry. Truly. I didn’t know, or I never would have said what I did.”
“Such as?” And just like that we were parents again together, best friends together, lovers together.
Sherlock was asking my own questions. If Morstan wasn’t incarcerated, who knows what revenge she might seek? Would we ever be safe?
Suddenly it came to me that mentally deriding the food at a moment like this was a good sign; it meant that some part of me had found something hopeful in what Sherlock was saying. His heart belonged to someone else. Normally that would be a kiss of death. But in fact I could work with it. It meant he
that Sherlock had not made it all up. Hell, he’d been the beneficiary of Sherlock’s rescues a hundred times, wouldn’t have kept his damn
I leaned down and kissed him, kissed him intently and insistently until he relaxed and kissed back. We had dissembled and excluded each other with disastrous results. If we were to carry on the Work—indeed, if we were even to survive long enough to try—we couldn’t afford any incomprehension or misapprehension between us. We were
They waved at him from a distance and he waved back, not terribly enthusiastically. He was target-fixated and wanted no distractions. Once they were safely past he let the sun warm his feet, then put on his clammy socks and wet trainers again.
He tugged at Sherlock’s hand: “Let me show you how wanted you are.” Closing the bedroom door behind them, he moved in to slide the elegant jacket off and grasp Sherlock’s waist.
“The way you sip your tea”: Sherlock tosses John a smiling glance as he steers Molly past them, Ella’s lush alto voice dipping deep for the low notes. “The way your smile just beams”—and suddenly John realises. This has nothing to do with Sherlock's current partner: this is
I move the flat of my hands over his back, relishing the contented “ahhhhh” he sighs, and bend my head to kiss his shoulder, his neck, his ear. I can’t get enough of smelling him. Every bit of skin I can reach, I caress. With every bit of myself. When I’ve memorised all the points of contact, synchronised our breathing, whispered his name and received no answer, I drift into sleep.
If you don't want to see any naked dancing, read this chapter as though it were the last. Ch. 12 is going to shift the rating to Explicit, but I didn't want to tag the fic that way from the outset lest anyone be disappointed that the vast majority of it is decorous fluff
I remember the night I finally called Sherlock on his “high-functioning sociopath” nonsense. I’d long ago made him stop describing himself like that, trotting out a well-rehearsed quotation from a medical journal debunking the categorisation. But he still denied having emotions, until one November night I exploded.
And with all that blood on the pavement—a soul-destroying memory—frankly I needed to feel him safe and sound as much as I wanted him to feel that I
What I’d taken for tension was instead a very welcome arousal. Who knows how long he’d been lying there awake and rigid with desire, trying not to wake me up.
More a gasp than a wince, this time. How had I got him so badly wrong? He certainly did care what other people thought of him, at least if it was me.
The silence from the sofa was complete: I don’t think he cared to get in a shouting-match with me when I was in this temper.
“What are you looking at, John?” Sherlock’s voice was as focused as though he hadn’t just been a million miles away.
He lies down on the sofa, replaying the scene. Lurches between indifference and pain, until he has to admit that the indifference is a forced denial of the pain. He’d expected John to fight for him. John didn’t, doesn’t, care enough to. He’d turned and left without a word or touch.
“I’ve found that the best things in my life have mostly come about because I did ask for them. Pursued them, and... risked, instead of playing it safe and waiting.” Julian’s voice was neutral; his stare was not.
When he finally wept, his chest heaving, I held him and kissed his hair, knowing that if we could survive this at all it would be by letting all of it out at last. His sense of betrayal, his belief that he hadn’t mattered, that his sorrow hadn’t mattered. When he was
I was done losing Sherlock. It was time for us to find each other again. As soon as he was well. As soon as I was sure. I was finally willing to risk everything—except for Rosie. For her sake, I had to be sure. So I waited, and I watched.
“He’s left. The flat’s been packed up and his things put into storage. I’ll be letting it again, once I’ve refreshed the paint and paper and whatnot. Replaced the mantelpiece. He was a
. Morale just starting to sag when John bounds up the steps to the flat, sounding energised and happy. Love when that happens. It happens more often than not, now. He blows through the door with an expression that says that in no time at all he’s going to be kissing me.
I'm glad if you're enjoying the lower angst-level of this goofy fic--thanks for all the lovely comments.
I had another chance, it seemed, to protect him. Which made it particularly worrisome when I started to think someone was following me.
Twenty-eight months after he was buried, he burst onto John’s notice with a painted mustache and a Monty Python-level fake French accent. Forced John’s eyes from Mary’s to himself, pinning him to the seat with a stare that was nine points arrogance, one point uncertainty.
"How was I meant to know? You certainly weren't telling." John tries for acerbic, but really he's too happy to pull it off: Sherlock's evenings weren't what he'd feared, and he's starting to hope he can guess what they
“It has been brought to my attention that Doctor Watson has submitted a request for an exhumation of human remains.”
“Good thing that’s how long we have, then. I’m not going anywhere, and neither are you.” John staggered a bit as he rose, and grinned at finding himself so off-balance.
The next photo was dark, and it took me a few seconds to understand what I was seeing: Sherlock was standing in a crowd in a grand curved hall, staring up at the light pouring down from him. Zanardi was standing at his back, arms wrapped all over him, smiling into his left shoulder. Damn him.
“I know. I do.” Something had washed away with the tears and the words. Some paralysing bitterness he’d grown so used to that it seemed part of his very bones, was gone. He reached for Sherlock’s hand, who looked down at that, and grasped back.
They're nearing perfect equilibrium now, he thinks. Both leading, both following, both pursuing and both being pursued. Whatever else happens, he thinks, he knows now that Sherlock has always cared, even when he tried to deny or disguise or defeat what he felt.
And those few, awkward words made Sherlock feel like he could exhale. It wasn’t just him. It wasn’t.
Because I saw that it hurt him, and I was glad: glad to see him suffering as I’d suffered, thinking himself unimportant to me as I knew I’d been unimportant to him. I wasn’t even aware that this was what it was; it took a shamefully long time to realize that I was punishing him, and how cruel I was being to him, and why. It had taken Ella’s relentless, impassive persistence to help me see what I was doing, what I was feeling.
That’s all for 2045, then. This blog will only update once a month now, if that, and only with news of bees and writing, music and cooking, visits from family and friends, things like that. Or, if the spirit gets very busy and moves me inexorably, I might post a few old cases I never wrote up—particularly if any of the principals should helpfully die and remove the threat of a defamation lawsuit. (That was a joke. No need to school me on English libel laws in the comments box, thanks all the same.)
When the anniversary of the attack came round, in mid-September, I tried not to notice. I didn’t have much memory of it, after all. The perp was behind bars. I shouldn’t make a thing of it. It was a Sunday and I gave myself a good lie-in, daydreamed about August, got up in disgust and showered.
One side of his mouth dipped down in the small smile that was reserved for John. John had not written him off, given up, in these days of silence. He was still waiting. Though perhaps the second text had been an accidental re-send, a finger slip or a technical hitch in the mobile service. John wasn’t being emotional —
“Yeah, that was a genius gift from the sprog. This is what, the ninth one we've had since 2033? Trust you to wear out a bloody
After she was gone, I realized I couldn’t do—anything. Contacting the radio station to ask about that request was a bad idea; I couldn’t risk prompting an indiscreet comment on air. It would even be unwise to ask them
kindly understanding with which she had gently, inexorably, taken John from me. Reminding me, without ever saying it, that I had discarded him first and broken him and could not repossess him now.
This will be how the story almost ends, dear friends. There will still be three ficlets in this series, which will end on Sherlock's birthday.
Leaning down again, Sherlock pauses a hairsbreadth from John’s face, his lips hovering at the corner of John’s mouth in a deliberate echo of that light kiss on the balcony. The clean, salty smell of John's skin and soap go to Sherlock’s head, and he breathes deeply to capture more of it. John turns and kisses him.
John’s smile vanished as he pulled the duvet away and hauled Sherlock and his pillow up from the sofa. Tugged him into the bedroom. There weren’t actually any words suitable for a scenario this unexpected. No, this unprecedented. Holding John’s hand was hardly adequate preparation.
So. That was a thing. Why was John in Killarney? How had he even got there? Whom was he seeing? Once, he’d have had to tease at these puzzles until he had a working hypothesis.
He’d had little enough on him when he was abducted—nothing more valuable than a fake Australian passport, a cheap low-tech flip phone, and a wallet holding a thin sheaf of business cards, post-its, a few Australian dollars, a tiny photograph of John taken in a booth in 2010, a scrap of paper with some musical notation but no staves. Some stamps, as if he were a tourist who meant to send postcards. An ATM card, also in his assumed name of Joshua Benjamin Travers. A condom. Camouflage only, from a vending machine at a highway rest stop in France.
I bracketed the romantic relationship implied by the lyrics. To the friend lost to suicide John could also say “I’ll be seeing you,” surrounded as he was by all my worldly goods in 221B. By the map of our adventures, in the city beyond our door.
running his hands along the lining and feeling Sherlock’s finely muscled form beneath, but now he’ll be happy discarding it and not renewing the acquaintance for the next month at least. Still it’s a beautiful garment and he does owe it some gratitude, so he slows down to savour removing it.
Seems there’s nothing I can do at this moment to put anything right. I’ve been waiting in limbo on my own account; now I’m instructed to wait another week, on his. Hoping he’ll call me when it’s time. Hoping he’ll “need me.”
The only light relief came in the late afternoon when Mycroft and four of his minions came in the back way, through Mrs Hudson’s flat and up two floors to crowd into John's bedroom. The sight of them (especially Mycroft) scuttling upstairs as fast as they could made me smile. But the time dragged.
I had an ulterior motive for waking him. The sight of him earlier, erect and straining, had given me an appetite—and God knows we’d skipped dinner. The light from the bath was enough for my purposes now: I wanted Sherlock sleepy and pliant for the next bit, but I also wanted to see him, ridiculously beautiful as he was.
In fact it isn’t dramatic at all. Some effort to restore normalcy is visible, and a clear bin bag full of grime and newspaper sits by the door. In it I can see two disconcertingly large nests. If those are sparrows’ nests, I don’t want to see a raven’s nest.
, thinks Sherlock, both fastidious and efficient. And greedy: he wants to see John, to see all of him in the light.
All the deaths I’ve seen. All the corpses. Violent deaths, and serene passings. Deaths from carnage, and deaths like sleep. Deaths I’ve fought tooth and nail and scalpel. Deaths I only saw after someone else had done all the fighting.
We told Rosie that we were going to have a wedding in December, and she was excited, mostly I think because she'd got it mixed up in her mind with Christmas. At least, the drawings she made of our prospective wedding contained a suspicious number of elves and reindeer for two middle-aged human males finally tying the knot.
“I don’t remember it all that clearly myself. Just that I made a total mull of it. I was eager to see you, I’d been looking forward for so long. Just kind of forgot how different it would be for you. You weren’t just
came out of nowhere. I had no idea that was even in my subconscious, let alone on the tip of my tongue.
way. They’d seen each other unclothed any number of times for reasons utilitarian or medical or domestic, and if they’d looked, it had been covert. Now there was no need for to be surreptitious: John stared at Sherlock as hungrily and curiously as Sherlock stared at John, then they reached for each other again and began to touch, exploring and caressing, gasping and shivering.
With anyone else that’d have been a bonding moment that ended with a hug. Us—we only ever touched while dancing, and that was bonding enough. But I’d a feeling he was going to do it for me, that I didn’t have to insist. Or beg.
Every caress in the night, every whispered endearment, every growled encouragement, every shattering gasp cemented them into what they always should have been. The barriers he’d erected and reinforced melted away with the doubts—doubts that John left no room for, between his full-throated enthusiasm and his unabashed intensity.
The first photo showed Sherlock alone on a public bench. It was sunny but, to judge by the passersby and his own clothing, cold and breezy. His hair was a ruffled dark halo. His knees were spread a bit, canted higher than his hips, the bench too low for his long legs. Who was he waiting for? He was staring down at his own gloved hands. Not observing, not deducing. I felt an ache under my ribs. So far away.
—No, not Serbia. Before. In Croatia. Sherlock was meant to be getting on an old ferry boat, all diesel stench and cheap white paint peeling over rusted metal plates and bolts, to cross the Adriatic to Italy. He’d been looking forward to Italy. Decent coffee, decent clothes. A decent haircut. But someone had targeted him in his anonymous clothing and greasy mane, his scruffy ginger beard, and he’d never suspected a thing until he felt a bat crash into his skull hard enough to hurt for days, a week.
“Three days. Two would be better.” I was grateful, as Mycroft would know no matter how curt I sounded. He’d been guilty and frightened about me for years now, never at ease unless John and I were on terms. Now he might even be able to take a vacation, though God only knows what
There it is. John’s hand, in his own. John’s other hand on his waist, leading, his expression fond as he looks slightly up. Suddenly it all feels almost overwhelming. He's created a minutely detailed scenario to get John to dance with him—to get John to dance with him
Along the walkway over the tracks and platforms there’s no one to watch them when time stops, when Sherlock surges into John’s space and his stillness. After a moment he pulls back to cup John’s cheeks in his gloved hands, searching that beloved face for every nuance. What he sees makes his heart shift in his chest and his tense mouth crack into a smile. For a moment he can’t speak, watching John and seeing his own elation mirrored there. Then: breathe in. John’s summer scent makes his knees buckle. Breathe John in, nuzzle his temple, ear, hairline. Darker, more intense than the familiar, superficial scent.
Two autumns ago, in those weeks when everything had seemed possible and I had only to recover from being shot, I’d dreamed of shoving my nose into every crevice he would allow me to. I’d been trying to absorb Roberto’s smell in that same immediate, overwhelming fashion. It hadn’t worked. It would never work.
He certainly seemed more Sherlock’s equal, socially and intellectually. Sherlock had had a posh education, whatever use he’d put it to after. It irked John to be sidelined as not quite up to the intellectual rigours of preparing an academic publication, as though he weren’t trained in scientific enquiry himself, for God’s sake.
Obviously it wasn’t the first time these two had talked admiringly about Roberto, though they were both
When I got back to bed I lay down on my back and after awhile Roberto curled around me, on his side, his right arm curving above my head like a question-mark, his left over my waist. His beard was fascinating, soft and scratchy at the same time, and it felt good on my neck and shoulder. In the night it had felt good everywhere, on my nape, wrists, arse, thighs, cock. I had always preferred the clean-shaven look, but my horizons were broadening with every hour I spent with Roberto. Obviously.
Mycroft was a bit later than expected, and that was fine, John and I just sat on the sofa while I caught him up on what I’d been doing while I was in Serbia sporadically over the last two months. The loose affiliation of criminals operating in Belgrade was ruthless but not always effective; they seemed more in competition than in collusion. That gave me a chance to turn one of them.
But if he was to encounter an even remotely plausible romantic entanglement, it wasn’t going to happen in seclusion at Baker Street. He saw no one but takeaway delivery boys, not one of whom had struck him as plausible. From his window he hadn’t observed anyone faintly promising, even from a distance. On the contrary. He was beginning to think the male population on display in central London the most dreary specimens he had ever seen. If he had to do this, he’d have to find someone not actively repulsive. Crime scenes weren’t ideal for the purpose, but getting back into the Work was a start at getting back into the world.
“No. Quite the opposite. I was thinking it’s quiet when Watson tires herself out.” He nods at the little heap of toddler on the blanket, a patch of sunlight on her chubby legs, finally still.
By ten the kids were packing their instruments into their bags and Ash was hugging a surprised John goodbye, urging him to stay longer. He fit in here just the way he had in Baker Street, as though it had all been waiting for him all along. Only occasionally he looked troubled, for no clear reason Sherlock could see.
I close my mouth abruptly as I realise what I’ve just said. And although when I said it I wasn’t in fact referring to John’s long denial of his sexuality, it would sound like a complete provocation. I groan.
Roberto clearly realised the change in Sherlock, who’d stepped away. He looked intently and said, “Can we—go somewhere?”
In temper, if not temperament, we were pretty evenly matched. I’d rarely had a partner that compatible since my injury, in fact. And by his account, he never had. We were actually good partners. We could do a lot without talking, and on the floor at least, he deferred to me.
“In spite of you, I do.” With a jolt I realised I absolutely meant it. I didn’t just like it, I’d started looking forward to it.
That ooze up, rather, like slime, oil, sewage. If the state had only the migrants themselves to channel and help (or refuse to help) we’d never be in such a dire crisis. It’s the jackals, pimps, and vultures, who see human misery as an advantage to themselves, that make the state’s job impossible. They make for a toxic cocktail of human trafficking: perilous sea-crossings in overcrowded vessels unfit to transport even cargo, let alone human beings; smuggling in airless containers by unwitting (—seriously?) lorry drivers; and at the end of it, at best indentured servitude, and at worst, slavery.
ask that, not now, not after all this time. It would sound mortifyingly plaintive. No, the window of opportunity for asking that question without embarrassment on my side or his had closed weeks ago. Early on he’d used body language to forestall any inquiries on my part; more recently he’d gotten more matter-of-fact about the whole thing. But it was clearly not up for discussion. There was a veil of silence around his evening
Still, panic tugged at him as Sherlock made to leave. “How can I reach you? If something goes wrong?”
“Oh, yes. John and I are partners in all our undertakings. Well. I don’t assist him at the surgery. But other than that. Yes, partners. Joined at the hip.” Suddenly he realised what that sounded like, and felt his face go hot.
And neither of them mentioned it, but they kept their hands clasped as they turned and left the cemetery in the dusk.
Our days in John’s Bromley flat were a study in beige. I kept scanning the drapes, upholstery, cushions, “art” on the walls, carpeting (unpleasant), looking for some flash of contrast to the relentless neutrals. The flat was unnaturally empty, nothing left lying on the end tables, no cheerful confusion in the bookshelves. Even the books were bland colours, and all but arranged by size. (Did she buy them in bulk at Ikea?) The occasional note of burgundy, a sober colour in itself, positively blazed next to the four hundred variations on sand, twine, écru, tan, and bone. The horrible suspicion arose that Watson's tastes might be shaped for life.
“You hit a nerve, and I overreacted. I’m just afraid of being—disappointed, unable to do it.” This is surreal. He
He pulls me toward him, his hand on my nape. I feel weak with relief, and a sound escapes me that is unmistakably needy. His voice is calm, fond. “Berk.”
He sat down again, wondering how to hint that John would soon be home for dinner without accidentally suggesting that Julian might join them. He drew a breath and caught Julian’s eye—oh no, the
I was filled with such eagerness, such energy and urgency, I couldn’t have gone back to sleep. But I didn’t want to miss a minute of lying in bed with Sherlock, touching his hair, listening to him breathe. The trust he must feel, to sleep with me. The man who avoided sleeping at all, let alone in the presence of someone else. Was trust an emotion?
That’s fair, isn’t it? You didn’t want it, before you left; you didn’t want it while you were away; you didn’t want it when you came back. If you did, I certainly couldn’t tell. It’s when you saw me with someone else, someone serious, that you finally started to want me, or so you wrote.
Seeing John in the audience had been a deeply unsettling seismic shift. Meeting him the next day and bringing him back to Caherdaniel had felt at first like a protracted goodbye. If it
Weeks later I found out who’d taken him aside and told him he was an idiot if he didn’t give me a chance. Belt and braces, I suppose. It’s always good to have backup.
I stopped his mouth with a kiss, which brought my belly and chest flush against his, making him gasp into my mouth as I plundered his. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to hear him; I just didn’t want to hear him apologise. He wasn’t the only one who wasn’t going to last long; why should he say sorry for that? Feeling him as overwhelmed as I was, was the most fantastic thing I could imagine. And I had a
We don't need to; we can talk through our skin, our sinews, our muscles. The language of his hands is almost translatable into English words, it’s like a conversation, it has the beats and repetitions of an established communication. The familiar patterns give the unexpected moves more effect, make them even more pleasurable.
As he whirls her to a halt Molly looks down at her feet, gorgeous painted toenails peeking out of her open-toed pumps, and says demurely, “
“I’ve never counted on being able to control what the media can discover or uncover, John, not once I came back. Particularly once I joined a band that seems set on performing live. I’ll live here as Will Scott and just hope the charade holds. I’ll tell Ash, but no one else. She might decide to tell Ciaran or Patrick, but that’s up to her.”
“Well, yes. Obviously. I can see why you had to mislead almost everyone else, but not me. You not only made me watch, but you left me there in the dark.
Which, as it happened, was damn little: he’d heard the tail end of a concert in the Glasgow Festival, the “new voices” category. Described only as a “circle of friends from Aviemore.” No help at all, that. Unless—surely no band would call itself A Circle of Friends. Would it?
Will was sobbing, and I could just make out, “We were everything to each other. No kids, hardly any family. She was everything to me.”
Meeting him threw that model into utter disarray, though it took me years to revise it. Even geniuses are remarkably slow to relinquish a cherished hypothesis to accommodate new data. I thought I could take him into my life by forcing my worldview upon him; instead, I had to change my worldview in order to take him into my life.
I love you. After all these years of lying to you and everyone else: I love you. I want you. I want to be with you, and I want you to be with us. You love Rosie already, and she’s the best part of me. I’ve never wanted anything so much, and if you come back to me, to us, I’ll show you that you’re my universe, you and Rosie. If you decide not to stay in Rome, please: give me a chance. I promise you won’t be sorry.
He frustrates me, gently moving his hand—no, both hands now—down to my bollocks, framing them and reaching down to stroke behind them. And though we’re not talking, I groan, a resonant sigh in the tiled bathroom, and he does the thing I love with his teeth and tongue and my ear. The combination of that shivery sensation and his fingertips on my cock is unbearably intense, I’m as hard as a rock by the time his left hand returns to my chest to tease my left nipple.
advanced for her age, and why had I ever thought it was a good idea to send her to school at four-and-a-half?
to bring us over, it was obvious which of them had come up with the location. The collision between John’s taste and Mycroft’s led to unexpected juxtapositions and some accidental comedy, but I was in no mood to judge. Because the hotel was Mycroft’s wedding present; because John so much wanted me to like it; because it wasn’t just luxurious, it was playfully and gracefully so—I was determined to be pleased.
to do to him. And by the time I'm out of words, he's out of calm, out of breath. After that there are no more words for a while, from either of us. Signs. Low groans. Urgent. Tender. Some laughter. He’s the one person I’ve always been able to laugh with, from the beginning, even before and long after I knew that I wanted him in
John always says that not knowing Italian gives him a vision of this land mostly unmediated by the verbal. In those places where only Sicilian is heard, I had almost the same—call it advantage. Colours and contours pressed directly on my visual centers without passing through a grid of language at all, and it was like nothing so much as a mosaic before the image has properly emerged.
The day dragged excruciatingly, like slogging through treacle. I couldn’t concentrate enough to start a new experiment, and there was nothing case-related to take my mind off the bizarre case of John. I knew he loved me. He knew it, too. But waiting outside his closet door for him to figure out that he wouldn’t explode if he walked out of it—that was getting me absolutely nowhere.
for images, since I wouldn't want to put that hotel's metaphorical nose out of joint by implying that it could, in real life, possibly countenance the goings-on in this fic.
before turning in. Elena digs out towels and dressing-gowns for Robbie and Sherlock, and gives them one last thoughtful look before heading along the corridor to her own room.
“Don’t suppose I could interest you in an early night ourselves? I feel done in—and you look it too, if I’m honest.” He kept his voice light, and Sherlock answered in kind.
“No chance I’ll forget. I only have to get through my dances with Molly and I’ll be back for you.” Sherlock leans in, makes his expression communicate intent. Molly is bearing down on them, though, drawing attention as her full skirt flows behind her, and they step apart.
“Agreed. Promise. And now I want us both to stop talking. We have a lot of lost time to make up for. And for the first time since we’ve known each other, we actually have the leisure to do it.” Until Watson wakes, at least.
“I do.” Firmly. “I feel very selfish at the minute: there are things I’ve been aching to know.” As he nodded I burrowed down into his neck, looking for a position where I could hear but not see him, in case his expression revealed something I
I sank back in my chair, sighing. I honestly hadn’t thought of that angle. So perhaps sending Sherlock that message was a colossal mistake after all.
killed himself, which made me feel a lot better about despising him and a whole lot more motivated to start doing it again. He didn’t even care that his little sidekick mourned, did he. I never apologised, and never wanted to.
“I did. I tried. You... wouldn’t listen. You even—well, pushed me away. Until you went away yourself.” My voice sounds strangled now and tight, nothing like his low, calm murmur, so quiet and controlled.
How did this happen? I’d been able to keep Zanardi out of my thoughts—well, neutralised in my thoughts—for the better part of a year. Now the sensation of loss was raw and fresh again and I was ready to kill him. I looked at my sleeping lover and all I saw was the man who had spent a month waking up next to Roberto Zanardi.
It’s hard to prove a negative. But the repeated failures of my enquiries did establish that there was a startling dearth of positive proof that Sherlock had taken his own life. And that there might be indications that he hadn’t even died.
As so often happens with Sherlock, then, I had a choice that wasn’t really a choice. I could press him for confidences he very clearly didn’t want to make, and disturb the otherwise lovely harmony that seemed to be not just prevailing but growing.
I didn’t realise that he was also thinking it was almost time to go home. He mentioned that I must miss Rosie, and I did, of course; but I knew she was fine, checked in on her twice a day. I was cherishing this never-to-be-repeated beginning with Sherlock in this glowing Italian city, where every wall was some shade of yellow, orange, or cinnabar. I didn’t even bring up going home, but on the Tuesday he came back to the hotel with a pastry and plane tickets for the next day.
They toured the various garden spaces tucked into the woods, the hen houses, the lily pond, and spent almost an hour at the hives. John asked intelligent questions and looked pleased with everything.
to closing down a nerve centre of the human trafficking network exploiting Italy’s porous, five-thousand mile coastline. So my guard was up and my tolerance was down when I finally met the loose cannon in person.
John was a fool, then. He’d been a fool all along. To care, certainly; to not suspect a trick. Most of all, to mourn himself nearly into the grave at losing a friendship—a love, even—that was so obviously one-sided.
“Then—” No more words were necessary. I took his face in my hands and kissed him, gently at first and then more fiercely as he braced himself on the arms of my chair and then climbed into my lap and kissed me until we were both breathless.
If anything he looked even more affronted. “You’ve been researching this for how long, now? Without even mentioning it?”
intended, then steps forward and reverses their positions so that the wall is at Sherlock’s back. John’s hands are at his waist and hip, his thigh neatly slotted between Sherlock’s. The rush of lust from cock up to belly is destabilising, and he’s unsteady on his feet, heart pounding and breath short.
The police were already there, of course, had probably arrived before the ambulance, but he’d had the strangest narrowing of focus. Nothing was right, everything out of balance and off-center. He’d called for Lestrade because—why? He tried to remember. He hadn’t really been able to see anything but the victim (
The next song they had planned now felt like too dramatic a downshift, so Ash replaced it with the most heartrending of warhorses. It hit infallibly on every string: famine and emigration, family letters and loss, endurance and hope. He mouthed “Sadist!” at her as he segued in after the guitar introduction and she took up the first line: “Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen and sixty...” and a moan of rapturous pain went up from the audience.
I went to bed (when I could get to a bed) and woke in the morning (when I could actually sleep) thinking
He steers John left to cross the main avenue, chic and far too crowded to walk together, then quickly right into a calmer, smaller street and left again to their hotel. It’s small and comfortable, by no means luxurious, and the cheerful night clerk welcomes them with the warm singsong burr of the local accent. John hands over his documents, and the woman’s matter-of-factness reminds Sherlock that of all people, hotel staff are the least likely to be shocked by two men who patently can’t keep their hands off each other.
) they become impatient and urgent. John slips a thumb into Sherlock’s mouth while lowering the zip of his trousers with his other hand to feel a desperately hard cock, irresistible and so, so responsive. Sherlock’s broken little moan when John's erection meets his own—that’s enough for John to check in.
of it late on February 22nd. It was in a cover envelope with Mycroft’s writing on it. Delivered with his usual dramatic flourish” (I hid a smile) “by a courier I wasn’t even going to open the door to. Just the words ‘eyes only’ irked me to the point that I buried it under my socks and went back to playing.”
Last year when Holmes had done me the service of a lifetime, I’d resented having to be grateful to him. Not this year. No, this year I sent him a floral arrangement the size of a very large dog.
The emcee is chatting casually, a low-key kind of “let’s wrap it up, then” message: one more dance, she says, and then they’ll tally up the evening’s earnings and make a toast, to absent friends. John watches Sherlock rise and stand there, waiting for him to do the same. This time, the last dance—the surprise dance—he holds out his hand and clearly intends for them to walk to the floor hand-in-hand. And why not, thinks John. It’s as certain now as though they had already kissed, already made love, already talked everything out and rehashed it again after. It's clear to them at last, and it may as well be clear to everyone else too.
They leave the floor and John heads for Sherlock, now leading his partner to her table. They smile at each other with an air of complicity that leaves John again secretly thrilled at how kind Sherlock is beneath it all, how he reads people beneath their surfaces. He asks for an introduction, resolving to learn the DCI’s name and retain it. Diana: he won’t pigeonhole her again. He smiles warmly and they leave her to her companions, all earnestly complimenting her on the tango.
“I was what?” He glances down again at the silvery-gold shimmer flashing out from the panels of her black gown.
“I saw that you were in the beginning stages of a text flirtation with a woman who looked like your favourite actress, and that you were thinking of putting our daughter into her care. You were making a momentous decision for contemptible reasons. I was more hurt and disappointed than I can even say.”
I thought without enthusiasm about the cold sheets in my cold room, and stood. John said, deliberately, “Of course, I could budge up.”
He was wrong. It hurt like hell that they preferred each other’s company that day to mine, reduced me to the status of a child-minder or a dog. It was always Mary’s style of humour—the slice-and-dice teasing that left no self-respect standing—but it was never Sherlock’s. Ours.
He was quiet a moment, his expression considering. Then he shook it off and went back to kissing me, a choice I heartily approved. Aleatory and incoherent as my questioning was, it had given me a great deal to think about, for good and ill. For tonight it was enough.
The next afternoon we were back at the airport, and by evening picking up our sleepy child from Sarah and Julian, and our life was starting again.
We were stretched out on the bed, the bed I’d never be able to forget, and Sherlock was trailing the callused fingers of his left hand down my face and chest. I gave a contented shiver, and a sigh, and nodded.
John had stood, come around the table, and practically pulled me up by my elbows to stare into my eyes as he said this. I understood that he wasn’t only thinking of all that we’d suffered at Moriarty’s hands, and Magnussen’s, and Smith’s. He was thinking of Roberto, thinking that it was the distance between us that resulted in my departure for Italy. And my presence in the bed of my first real lover, when John had always, consciously or not, intended to be that man.
He took a moment to consider that. Visualise it, even, back in Baker Street. “I suppose that’s how I think of it. Identity isn’t a fixed constant independent of circumstances, or surroundings, or support systems. The world reflects us back to ourselves and we adapt to what it shows us. Sometimes what we see can be deadly.”
His gift for me was beautiful, if not particularly personal. A pair of butter-soft brown leather gloves lined with fur. I couldn’t stop touching them, and in some odd neural short-circuit it was as if I were stroking his skin, and in the fur lining, his hair, which I knew to be much softer than it looked. How was I ever going to get close to Sherlock again? And if I couldn’t, how was I ever going to get over him?
. Sherlock had all my attention, and the last thing I needed was a fishing expedition from someone who, come to think of it, must have got my number from the school form. I doubted she’d like it if a nurse from her doctor’s office pulled her mobile number from her medical records and texted her with a similar proposition.
Listened to the radio. Programmes are specific to times of day: the sad and the strange in the dark hours; in the working hours, the frenetic and the cheerful.
of it, hit us again as it had our first time in this bed and I swear we were asleep before we had time to think about a wet flannel.
He stepped back and clasped his hands behind his back, waiting. Lestrade began to divide out tasks among his team, his signature good humour somehow as authoritative as another DI’s barked commands might be. When the work was delegated, Sherlock stepped forward again, securing everyone’s attention by lowering the timbre of his voice to its most resonant pitch.
“I’m sorry,” was all he said. “I wish you’d trusted me enough to take me with you. I wish I could dismember whoever did this to you. And I wish I hadn’t thrown you on your back that night.”
Lover: the word is complex, and I’m not sure it will ever apply to him or to me.  He called me things in the night that I was not ready for. He did it again in the morning, when he woke up. Talking about names worked like a screen for the discomfort of finding myself in his bed in a flat I don’t even know.
Your fathers and I were sorry to celebrate Christmas without you this year. Since your grandparents were in Florida, the three of us were alone in the country house—well, along with two hellhounds, a foot of snow, and no electricity. Happily we had made no more ambitious plans for the holiday, as the snow would undoubtedly have put paid to them. The highlight of the weekend may well have been watching the hounds encounter the unfamiliar snowscape; they were suspicious, then bemused, and finally quite frantic with delight. I haven’t laughed so much since the time Sherlock ... well, I should save that anecdote for live delivery.
The tone of his voice was one I knew very well: I use it myself whenever I have to slow my brain down and explain a chain of reasoning about a deduction, and the evidence that led to it. (Do I sound as exasperatedly, determinedly patient as John did now?)
“I’m sorry. I ... should’ve waited, last year. But I was so angry. I wanted to put something irrevocable between us. I didn’t know, then, that you—that the reason you’d come to Baker Street two days earlier was to try to. You know.”
Lestrade called a few times, texted a few more. Every time I saw his name on my phone I felt a flush of incandescent rage. I never picked up, never texted back. The bastard
It’s a low blow, since John had apologised wholeheartedly for accusing Sherlock of killing Mary. But Sherlock’s too angry now to fight fair, and John’s had this coming, oh yes, he has.
His voice was somewhere between disconcerted and laughing, as though he truly hadn’t seen that question coming. My reputation for omniscience was taking a beating. But at least he hadn’t been dating one of the mums from Rosie’s daycare. I didn’t want to mention the hideous Christmas I’d spent, regretting the previous one and resenting John for inviting me to his flat with all of our friends and a new (if imaginary) love interest.
casework: occasional at first, discreet always, and absolutely anonymous. Between periods of routine if varied bee-work, 221B was periodically charged with the manic energy of a top-notch puzzle (Greg knew not to call him in on anything less than a 7). Sherlock Holmes was back, but not unchanged.
He opened the door and stood there in the early morning light, then turned away again. I got up and moved behind him, pulling him tight to my chest, bending my head down over his shoulder, left hand on his scar, right hand on his heart.
“My turn, John! You’ve been dancing with the handsomest man in the room, and I get him now. Sally tells me you’re on with her, and she’s waiting over by the bar. Don’t you dare forget to compliment her on that dress.”
Greg’s eye-roll too rivals Sherlock’s best, but he stands, settling his sleeves and jacket before following Sherlock back out onto the floor. John, as hoped, is propping up the wall and holding a glass of something refreshing—it would decidedly not suit Sherlock’s purpose for him to be bidding on, or bid on by, one of the women here this evening. Quite selfishly he wants John’s attention, his admiration, his time, and
I hated Zanardi. Hated his looks, his height, his Italian background, his cockiness. (That note he’d given Sherlock for me: God
He craned his neck over me and kissed the top of my head. I could get used to that, I thought. He can do that standing in the kitchen, in the shower, over my chair, anytime and anywhere. (Tell him later.)
No, it was his own wife who had killed Sherlock, certainly tried to, and John was so ashamed that he’d never asked forgiveness. Never even apologised. Sherlock had been literally killing himself to save John and John’s only thanks had been to batter him hard enough to leave stitches and scars and broken ribs.
What happened next—John’s head pounded every time he replayed that scene. And he did replay it, by God he did. It took the place of his nightmares of Afghanistan, of Sherlock falling from the roof of Barts Hospital, sprawling shattered on the pavement.
Roberto answered, “IP piracy. It isn’t only fashion and media that get pirated; there’s an astonishing amount of money to be made in pirating drug compounds.”
Patrick stepped back when Sherlock picked up his guitar. That voice: all chocolate brown velvet, saying goodbye to a beloved who refuses to follow.
“What does that even mean, ‘bring her up to be like you?’ Tall, dark, brilliant, and sexy as all hell?”
We decided to invite no more than fifteen guests, and to bring them back to 221B for a buffet of lavish starters that might stand in for dinner. Champagne, of course, and a small cake, but more like Christmas fare than a wedding cake.
A few minutes were taken up with John’s warm compliments on the music, Aislinn’s questions about his journey, and Sherlock’s complete silence on both topics. Then she stood and asked Sherlock, “Are you staying? No worries if ya are, I’ve got a lift back.”
say that. Just tell me as much as you want to, for a bit. We’re both done in, and you have to be fresh for tomorrow night, so.” And indeed John’s voice was drained. His fault, again.
“Well, sure. A long visit after the birth—we can be more helpful than obtrusive, if we stay in the Airbee. Though it’s been a long time since either of us took care of newborns.”
Apparently Sherlock also intended to dish it out, though, since by now he was looming over John, his callused fingertips unbearably arousing first on his nipples, then up to his shoulders and down his sides to explore whatever might be stirring between them. Which seemed to be quite a lot.
When the bell rang again around 5:30 Sherlock moved quickly for the stairs. He only did that for strangers, or special guests. When the door opened next I saw my sister there, and Clara.
My next step in investigating the Incident was to track down media reports, not on Sherlock’s “fraudulence,” but on his death. It was just as well I could start this at the flat, since after the path report I was too heartsick to go out right away.
Our daily texts had tapered off to a few times a week; I was almost always unavailable when he invited me on a case, and I always blamed the lack of childcare. What was holding me back, though, was the fact that Wiggins was still to be found so often at 221B. And Sherlock never texted me first unless it was about his work. —His work. It was our work, once, and as much as I wanted it to be that way again, he seemed if anything to be drifting further out of reach.
It was grueling. John made me tell all the things I never wanted or dared to explain to him. Exactly none of it put me in a flattering light. Especially my own superficiality and hubris, thinking Moriarty wanted to play games with me for a challenge—when all he wanted was to conquer, to kill, to rule a criminal empire.
If he is, shame on me. But I remind myself that we’d both been cutting with each other, and some defensiveness was natural. Mine, strangely enough, has been directed toward Zanardi alone. The bastard had seen what I hadn’t—that is, what I had in Sherlock—and he hadn’t hesitated to take advantage of my blindness, my cowardice. And I’ve been resenting the hell out of him for it, despite trying not to.
When I kissed my dads goodnight, I turned back and looked at them, each in his chair by the fire. Da was holding the big showy one, fiddling with his silky ears while the pup dozed; Ba was deep in conversation with the little wary one. The expression on both my fathers’ faces was the same: pure joy.
and sweated another week, pinging Mycroft regularly for updates on John’s condition. (Still gaunt, haggard.  Still visibly depressed. Still haunting the cemetery. Not dating, thank God. —Oh, that’s bad.)
“Galleria d’Arte Moderna, of course! Twenty-eight paintings, and then thirty-five a few months later!”
Sherlock, loving him for that, agreed: “It’s Ireland, John. Remember that song about Oisin leaving the enchanted land of Tir Na Nog, and returning home and instantly aging three hundred years?”
He wanted to get closer to that somehow. Perhaps it was why he’d encouraged Patrick, or at least not discouraged him.
“You need a good night’s sleep, and so do I. Had a nightmare, and it’ll help knowing you’re here. Don’t take the piss. Just humour me.”
He never lost sight of the fact that I was doing him a favour, either. (Repaying one.) He didn’t act stuffy or haughty. Didn’t get defensive when he botched a step or a move. Didn’t lord it over me when I did, either. After the second practice night we stopped being careful, too. Didn’t mince words or try to keep our tempers.
He did anything but. We were in sync on every level: emotionally, in the expression and experience of loving each other. Talking was harmonious, if sometimes painful and always difficult; and how much we communicated without words, how much came in through skin, through breath. Physically, certainly. My God: every time we made love it was exponentially better than the last time, in the beats and reprises of desire, arousal, fulfillment.
“Of course I did.” He said it impatiently, unabashedly, and accompanied it by one of his best eye-rolls. “I must say, though, it doesn’t
It wasn’t until it became clear that he couldn’t—in bed—that Mary reached the end of her forbearance. One January morning, after yet another time he couldn’t become or remain aroused, couldn’t bear being touched sexually, she took his hand over the breakfast table and said gently that it was over.
“Bold of you assume you’ll be sleeping at all.” Sherlock’s voice was too tentative for real bravado, though.
Shortly before 11, he took Mycroft’s letter from the drawer where he had relegated it the week before. He opened the envelope and took a few seconds to identify the fine writing paper, the lush ink, even the pen his insufferable brother had written with. Status: urgent; eyes only. The uncharacteristic medium for such a message made him curious, but he didn’t want to give Mycroft the moral advantage of reading with eager haste. The cover sheet was succinct yet predictably pompous:
Hm. He could see John’s point, but he could no longer remember a time before he thought John compelling in every conceivable way. What he could remember was the fading, defeated man he’d met in the lab at Bart’s, and—oh.
John trusted the man no further than he could throw him, but he was almost certain that Mycroft was telling the truth. His unease was far more convincing than the grief and remorse he’d put on for John’s last visit.
Five minutes later Mycroft received another text: Moran had been shot while setting up a high-calibre rifle with a heat sensor. They’d found a handgun, too, presumably the murder weapon. I knew better than to fear it would have John’s fingerprints on it.
At last it was Sunday again, after a week that had at least seventeen days. And this time I could listen directly to the broadcast in real time. Didn’t have to wait long, and my legs went to jelly when I heard the song and picked out line 12:
He’s quiet a moment. Then: “I’ve always been afraid to let go, you know, to show you how important you are to me. I’ve always been afraid you’d be ... repelled. Or that you’d ridicule me. Patronise me.”
I wondered if Sherlock might be on the verge of a change. A change that would put paid to our companionable cohabitation, just when it was returning to its previous equilibrium—well, what had seemed to
be true. Indeed, my nearest brush with the miraculous was just the same: in one unexpected moment I found myself desperate for something to not be true. My intolerable freakishness, my wincing dislike of human proximity, my inevitable solitude: when I saw him for the first time I wanted those intransigent facts to melt away. They did, although it took years:
I might not have dared to bring up the sex, but he’d touched on it himself, and I decided I could only try. After all, he hadn’t refused to answer any of my questions yet.
When had John become this diabolical? Was it possible I’d never known him at all? I felt a grin stretching my cheeks, and he added,
“Telling.” Her mouth is close to my ear, but not flirtatiously so—which, given what she’s telling, is not surprising.
“Where what?” says Sherlock, dazed, kissing his way along the side of John’s jawbone, up his cheek to his temple, pausing in his hair.
It seemed we were out of practice talking seriously, or perhaps our hug had given us a change of tone, but within minutes of walking into this room we were already more ourselves than we had been in weeks.
Another turn in the dance but Donovan’s on it, making first a full and then a half-twirl, making it look as though he's guiding her hand as it describes a graceful arc over her head and then comes to rest at her shoulder. Good thing she
He laughed, sounding younger than I’d yet heard him. Pulled back, and said, “Tonight you’re sleeping in a bed.”
He sips his martini—if he has to do these bloody old-fashioned dances to bloody old-fashioned torch songs he’ll drink something of the same vintage—and looks for Sherlock. Never hard to spot him. It’s as though the light gathers round him, people’s stares gather round him, imperious and elegant and somehow thrumming with nervous energy while remaining composedly still.
And it went on like that: once or twice a week he went out and came back glowing, revitalised, optimistic. Freshly showered. And cagey. Exuding physical satisfaction. Sexy? He was always sexy. Something was different about the way he moved, though. He was always confident, controlled, muscled; now he was balletic, as though he was choreographing himself, his own movements.
“You know their uniforms are made by Bilotta?” Even sottovoce, the conversation carried clearly in the resonant space.
Only Donovan had the presence of mind to ask “clearance from whom,” and Mycroft answered, “from me personally, or from my immediate subordinate, Sherlock.”
And whether because John had never heard him sing at all, or because he took to heart the parting in the song, his expression was stricken.
He groans. And just like that we’ve gone from cold and weary and lost to rock-hard and intent. I’m touching him lightly, just brushing my fingertips against his cock, his bollocks, as he pushes his arse back against my groin, then thrusts his hand back between us to grip me hard. I bend my head to kiss his ear, his cheek, his lips, and when we shift in the shower to angle the water to our other, still-icy sides, we’re face-to-face and kissing hungrily. For a warm-up shower this is proving a spectacular success.
He surged up to take my face between his hands and kiss me as though it’d been weeks, years, then eased back to bite gently at my lower lip, slide my own jacket off my shoulders, pull my upper lip between his and tongue at it delicately. He knew that shorted out all my circuits and took every element of planning and control straight out of my hands. I smiled under his mouth and let him unclothe me at his leisure.
I could feel my teeth grinding again in the icy damp as I forced myself not to reply. I had to discover what John was doing with his investigation, and his clear attempt to prod Mycroft into—what? I also had to understand the purpose of the songs he was having played on the air. Did they apply to me, to us? Was it a way of processing grief, or was he broadcasting something specific in the hope or expectation that I would hear them?
“And when you wailed and howled on your violin?” I’m not exaggerating, either—the way he brutalised that instrument sometimes was equaled only by the way it brutalised my ears and brain.
He remembered her being bounced up and down on the choppy seas out to Skellig Michael: hip or no hip she was laughing with delight, shouting with it, grasping at their hands and gasping for breath. (He still didn’t like being on a boat, especially one that small.) Every time she left, though, she took a bit more of them with her. She wasn’t going to last forever.
“But my shoes weren’t there, they’d slid away and I had to go looking under all the seats to find them, and the coach pulled away again and you were gone. It didn’t seem too serious, I knew I could get out at the next stop and you would drive there and pick me up. But I was rattled anyway. I found my shoes, collected my things and got off at the next stop.”
When I wake up, who knows how much later, it’s to Sherlock in a completely different mood. No reserve, no doubt, no disquiet. He seems ... transformed from before.
Well, sod that, as John himself would say. Sherlock has spent years trying to understand what John wants of him, and to be it. And he’s just failed so comprehensively that he can’t bear to contemplate the prospect of remaining in London with his closest friendship in ruins. On this of all days.
Now my own heart was beating slow and sad. If he’d talked about it, I’d have felt as though it were less important. That he did something so uncharacteristic as to actually respect someone else’s privacy, or his own privacy with someone else, made it look horribly like he was more attached to Zanardi than I had started to let myself hope. He warned me off kindly, and I had to remember that despite being impossibly, even comically, invasive himself, he had never failed to respect the privacy of my sex life. I backed off.
And even in that moment of wretched misery, near despair, John’s helplessly fond smile and—yes—another hug, gave him a rush of warmth.
Sherlock smiles serenely. “No, I won’t. I already blocked myself out of all the numbers I didn’t want to dance, and just left a few open for the fundraising. I’m not that comfortable doing ballroom dance with strangers.”
What John said made sense. I’d never looked back on my time with Roberto with nostalgia, or fondness, let alone regret that I ended it. On the contrary. Roberto’s love—need, even—only made me feel intensely uncomfortable and vaguely guilty. I had tried, honestly tried, but the more he wanted me, the less I wanted him; and I ended up feeling as though I’d used him, when it certainly hadn’t started out that way.
—and to normalise for him the idea and the fact of themselves as male partners. The whole Met had been unwitting co-conspirators in this plan, and here John seems perfectly comfortable, amenable, pleased with it. Could it be that he never needed to go to these lengths?
. I wanted to overwrite you. I could never delete you, John. I can delete facts, you know. Events, trivia. Not emotions. Not people, and certainly not you. I wanted to detach the uncontrollable emotions I felt for you, from... you. To redirect them. To care for you no more than you seemed to care for me. I thought the best way to do that was to put someone else in your place. For
While John was shaming me about Sarah, his hands were cupping my face, his fingers moving in my hair. He shifted off of me and onto his back, tugging me on top of him again and beginning to caress my back. Our cocks were trapped between us, my knee between his knees, and his nails stroking my back so softly I almost purred. I did purr. Mortifying. I wondered if this was a new sensation to John, and asked another question I'd been brooding about:
So a few low-stress weeks of early summer were dotted with free concerts at the park or the library. He even looked in on a couple of book signings at Waterstones, at the weekend. And he rediscovered the joys of what his mum to the end of her days stubbornly called the wireless.
