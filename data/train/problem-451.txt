“John. Please look at me.” It’s the crack in his voice when he says “please,” like he needs it more than anything, that makes John look up.
Sherlock inhaled once more before forcing himself upwards, pulling the bedclothes along with him and revealing Hamish burrowed underneath. He kicked himself free of them and slid his arms under the boy, lifting him from the bed and swinging him around to perch on his back.
John looks from Mycroft back to Sherlock. “I have a feeling there’s more?” he asks softly. Sherlock closes his eyes, turning away slightly.
“I was 21, away at university, Euros was nearing her 18th birthday, and Sherlock was just 14. The situation was handled, with minimal damage, and she was moved to a more secure facility. That was over 20 years ago.”
“What time is it?” Sherlock asked the boy, too tired to turn his head for the alarm clock by their bed, and his phone just out of reach beyond it.
“Pardon me, Rangers, but I must steal Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson from you. I hope to see you at the trials tomorrow morning?”
Sherlock huffs as he pushes himself back to his feet, spinning on his heel and going for John. He gets the staff up against John’s jugular, and taps him. “One-one,” he adds smugly.
Sherlock smiles brightly, for a few moments. Then he’s back to the lesson; “We could attempt to work in a dip as well, but honestly I think you’ve got enough to be getting on.”
Sherlock meets him halfway, pushing John gently back to his pillows and placing his forehead against John’s shoulder.
John chuckles, and Sherlock turns back to him. “Better or worse?” he asks, letting the slight British lilt, the one that came and went as it pleased, slip noticeably back into his voice.
John chuckles softly, preparing himself to rise from the bed. His back hadn’t been at its best in the past few years, and some things required more effort than when he was a younger man.
He tries to think back to the last time he felt solid. And that’s when the pain comes. He knows this pain, has felt it before.
“Alright, then,” John says, holding his position and dropping into a defensive stance. “Don’t hold anything back.”
He’s still against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock’s hand on his neck. It feels good, it feels right. Except that it doesn’t, because John shouldn’t have this. He doesn’t deserve Sherlock comforting him, not after…
The blonde offers her hand. “Hello,” she says politely, “I’m Mary. I’m one of the candidates to be your new co-pilot.”
He still feels the warmth of another hand in his. He knows now that it’s reality seeping in. As it does, the pain gets worse. He focuses on it, tries to latch onto it, let it pull him out of the fog.
“Let’s never do that,” Sherlock says desperately as John reaches into his pants, “And let’s stop talking.”
Already he’s been on his own for nearly a year, and he can’t do it anymore. He misses Sherlock with everything inside him, and if he can’t ease that hollow ache, even a little, he won’t last. He can feel it, and it terrifies him that it doesn’t terrify him.
not with you.” He breathes in. Breathes out. It’s not enough. It’ll never be enough. He has to finish regardless.
“Alright,” John says, giving Sherlock a playful pat on his rear, and then pushes himself up and out of the bed. He stands, stretches, finds his balance, and then sets off toward the kitchen downstairs.
Everyone around them is also dressed impeccably. Complex, expensive, colorful gowns surround them, and plenty other suits as well.
John allowed himself a moment to confirm Sherlock’s existence, and to revel in the proximity, the contact of him—something he could never get enough of, even before Sherlock’s ‘fall’.
John contemplates the new information. “But then how do they pilot? That machine’s not built for three, not like that Mach 4 out of China.”
“Ms. Watson, your priority is to protect the city of two billion people at your back—you will not jeopardize that for a vessel that holds ten.”
Sherlock looks John up and down, a very obvious appraisal. He turns slightly toward Mycroft. “I imagined him differently,” he states simply.
He lets it drop to the floor by his feet as Sherlock takes a step forward. He studies them for a moment before slowly reaching out to touch the tips of his fingers to the scar-tissued flesh, patterned to follow his old Jaeger armor.
John tensed, expecting Sherlock to push him off and away at any time—but was instead given Sherlock’s almost-instant response of kissing him back, just as earnestly and just as furiously.
Sherlock lifted a hand, rubbing at his eye and pushing some hair back from his face. “He had to work this morning, pet.”
The solitude of childhood, a fascination with the Kaiju, the strained relations of family—all of this coming from Sherlock.
“Indeed. Our parents made sure she had the best treatment in England, but it wasn’t enough. Every doctor wanted to put her on one medication or another, all of them very intense for adults, let alone an adolescent girl.”
John’s favorite part was the before, the nervous anticipation and the fiery whiz of the small explosive high up into the sky.
“John Watson, as I live and breathe!” he calls out, crossing over to him. He lifts the boy over his head and sets him down on the floor. “Damn, it’s good to see you.”
“Oh, he likes you,” the other woman interjects, “you just make him a bit nervous is all.” She turns to John. “Janine,” she says, offering her hand.
John considers canceling multiple times. He likes Mary, likes her a lot, but he can’t promise things he should be able to. There’s almost nothing guaranteed in his future, and he doesn’t want to give her false expectations.
They’ve been ‘dating’ for six months, but there’s still a part of John he keeps from her. And that’s fine, if only she knew why. She only wants to understand.
“Don’t get cocky, now,” she warns, but they both know that between the two of them, Harry’s the one that should heed her own advice.
“She was, as you can imagine, not the most well behaved patient. As she grew older, she became more violent and manipulative. She began to send letters, mostly addressed to Sherlock, which were…disturbing in nature. We believe she had either colluded with or coerced a member of the staff into sending them, because despite revoking her privilege they still came. Always with a different return address, so we didn’t know what they were until we opened them.”
She cinches the lace tight on her shoe and stands tall. Even with her three years over him, she and John are the same height. Harry grins.
John Watson stirs. His body had learned to rise early during training, and it never seemed to fade. Harriet Watson, however, typically slept like the dead until something loud and obnoxious was blaring in her ears.
After all that time, after two whole years, Sherlock Holmes had the audacity to just walk back into John Watson’s life, as if he hadn’t lied to him for two years. As if he hadn’t left him to think his best friend was dead.
“No problem,” Sherlock mutters, back in motion. He’s passing through the kitchen when he calls, “Now, you do have a tuxedo, correct?”
“Seven and twelve. Had to use the toilet, then looked for Daddy. I think Missus Hudson is still a-sleeping.”
She turns and leaves him there, bleeding on the sidewalk. ”Thank you,” she thinks she hears behind her, but doesn’t turn back. It was probably the wind.
Sherlock huffed at John’s interruption, but continued. “Scott was badly injured on a run four years ago and was no longer able to pilot. He’s one of our brighter engineers on the floor, nowadays.”
She nods. “Yeah, a three team drop in Manila. Good to have you back, mate. Sorry to hear about your sister.”
They hug, clapping each other on the back. “You too, Greg. How are you?” he asks, as they step back.
He sits through his statement at the Yard with quiet unease, the adrenaline all rushed from his system in one go but his guilt still not quite caught up with him. Something’s wrong, he knows it, but he’s so tired he can’t bother to figure out what it is just then.
In only his undershirt, John can tell Sherlock’s tattoos travel far beyond his arms, continuing under the fabric onto his chest and back. His arms in full view, John can see the muscle that hides beneath the ink. Sherlock is fairly fit, while a little on the thin side, John can tell there’s power hidden there.
He charges into the house, remembers vaguely when he came here before. He knows where he’s going, but it doesn’t make him feel any better.
“Angry, detailed, and quite violent, as you can expect. Many of them referred to Redbeard, as well as Euros’ desire to leave treatment and return home, at any cost.”
“Shut up,” John says playfully, pushing Sherlock back onto his elbows and straddling him. “We have something important to finish.”
With a sigh, Sherlock drops back, letting John pick himself up, and then launches in again. The staffs crack with each contact, loud in a room that falls quiet again. Hits are deflected from both parties, and for a moment it seems that they will be stuck there in the interim, no one getting in another hit.
She sits him down on her couch and kisses him breathless. At least, she thinks it’s the kissing that makes him breathless. Once that slows down he clears his throat, ever the gentleman, and asks, “Need help with the coffee?”
Sherlock snatches up his discarded clothes from where he left them beside the mat and charges after his brother.
Mary gives him a small smile before turning to leave, and Sebastian follows. Irene turns to look at Jim, who continues to stare at John with some glint in his eye. John doesn’t like it. John doesn’t like him.
Sometimes, John feels guilty about not being emotionally present in the relationship. Mary doesn’t seem to mind, but it still bothers him. She seems most interested in making sure he’s okay rather than trying to push them forward, and for that he’s grateful. But he still feels like he’s holding her back, keeping her from going out and finding something real for herself, so he tries to make an effort whenever opportunities present themselves, hence dinner.
“Just shut up for a minute, yeah?” It was the most casual-sounding either of them had been in the entire encounter. John dropped his head, for just a moment, never releasing his grip on Sherlock.
“Nice to meet you, Pete,” John says, holding out a hand. Pete shakes it and quickly retreats to his father. “I like your hat.”
He’s reminded of that, that first night with Sherlock. Looking back, it was the first time in a long time that John had felt something, other than a debilitating disconnect with the world around him.
“Forget you going after Smith, I should have been arrested for what I did to you. And I can’t take that back. Nothing I do can ever change the fact that I put my hands on you with the intent to hurt you, really and truly hurt you. As soon as that scalpel was out of your hand, I had crossed a line I
This surprises all of them.  All except Jim Moriarty, the only one of the five who has not contributed to the interaction thus far—other than staring John and Sherlock down like they were about to burst into flames.
Looking back, he can’t quite recall the draw of such delights—until the night he looks at John, after their first chase.
Eventually, when the need for air outweighed the waging war, they separated. Both of them significantly redder than before, with swollen lips and battle scars that seemed insignificant but meant everything—John roughly tore himself away.
Sherlock only lifts his head long enough to pronounce “Just tea,” and then is back in John’s shirt. His hand finds the hem and slides underneath, tracing lazy, intricate nothingness into John’s stomach.
And then John’s lips are on Sherlock’s. John’s hands are in Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock’s hands are around John’s waist, pulling him down with him on the bed.
“Don’t make that face,” she bemoans, disgusted. “John made a face when he saw me, I told him I’d put a hole in it. I’m still tempted to do so,” she teases, her eyes lighting up at the prospect.
They both take a step back, a few steps around, and then start back in at each other again. Blow for blow, they match up; Sherlock blocks when John delivers, John ducks when Sherlock swings. As they fight, Sherlock silently roars. He is quick, and he is light on his feet. He gets in another hit. Two-two.
Surprisingly, John hears a groan from the bunk beside him. “Why d’you have to think so loudly, Johnny?” his sister mutters, arm thrown over her face as if to block him out.
They get off the helicopter and walk to where a young man is waiting, and he immediately hands Mycroft an umbrella. John smirks briefly to himself.
John finds his eyes, finds the raw emotion welling up at the edges, one slow line already sliding down the crease of his nose.
“Sentiment,”John whispers. His fingers curl slightly, inviting, welcoming him. Sherlock nods. He folds his hand into John’s.
It irks John, the look Jim gives Sherlock. He doesn’t quite know why. He can tell Sherlock is actively trying to ignore Jim’s attentions.
Another Holmes. Upon second glance, John begins to see the facial similarities, infinitesimal as they seem.
But very time he looked up at the Marshal and Sherlock, he could see this look in Sherlock’s eye, and a slight lift in his upper lip. John couldn’t decide is he was curious, amused, or annoyed.
Sherlock fixes him with a look, and then shrugs. He turns his back on John and Mycroft. “Is he always like that?” John asks.
“Don’t,” John whispers, their faces only an inch apart. They stared at each other, and it felt like it dragged on for days. “Just—Just don’t. Not now, Sherlock. I’m only a few words away from punching your stupid face, so just…don’t.”
John takes a deep breath. “I get that, Sherlock, I do. When it was me and Harry, I never wanted to do the talking. But I saw what went down in the Drift, you know I did, and we can’t ignore what happened.”
“I beat you, Sherlock! I punched you, I kicked you. I made you bleed. All because of some stupid, misplaced guilt and a nasty fucking temper.”
"And of course I have done, I am perfectly capable of playing a role when req--"  Sherlock stopped talking.  "Wait.  What did you say?"
And, well, John isn't fully responsible for the images that pop to mind at that.  The thing is, the color, it's just so
when he'd woken up.  So what the hell had happened to him, that he was beat up, too hung over to remember what had happened, and still felt
So he sat down at the table and let himself watch, the repetition: photograph lips, drink from coffee cup, photograph results, record the timestamps for the photographs and experimental conditions in the notebook.  He'd never noticed how mobile Sherlock's lips were before, how they could twist and move, the orbicularis oris and the buccinator tensing and relaxing as he went through his process.  His lips were so lovely; not a thought he was having for the first time, but still a revelation, to see them so defined, so strongly colored, as if their mobility was just a trick of the color, and not a natural property.  Sherlock was gleefully excited at the differences between the effects of the types of lids; he flipped back and forth between the two identical-looking photos on his phone, pointing out an area that he said showed a different distribution of pressure.  "Think of how useful this would be when trying to determine a victim or suspect's actions before a crucial moment!  I wonder if we could get more granular with more lids.  John, will they be calling you in tomorrow?  I'd like to extend this study."
Sherlock huffed.  "But it's patently obvious that the cryptokey has been sold by--"  John gave him a look sufficiently evil to cut off that sentence.  "Fine, yes, I understand."
"Um," John said, and glanced down at Sherlock.  Sherlock's expression was curiously blank.  John realized at that moment precisely why he had been so taken aback to find someone who was actually interested in what he did, rather than wary or offended.  And he was going to be damned if he'd tell him otherwise.  "Online dating site, actually."  Sherlock's surprised little smile creeped back into his face, and his eyes crinkled.  An odd kind of giggly affection poured through John.  "Hold your face still," he said chidingly, hoping it wasn't visible to anyone but Sherlock.  "I don't want to bandage this crooked."
They ate tiny Spanish meatballs on toothpicks and bits of squiggly octopus in gochujang and something absurd with kale, decided that the cocktail menu was too obsessed with bitters so just ordered rounds of G&Ts.  “Next time, let’s go somewhere less trendy,” she said, dropping her line peel back in the glass, and his heart beat faster at
With that, therosinlessbow went from being online to offline.  A moment later, John received a text from a London number, reading simply
There was utter silence for a moment.  And then John glanced over at Mary, and they both burst out laughing at the same time, John covering his eyes with his hand and Mary her mouth.  Sherlock—Christ, the great detective Sherlock Holmes—rolled his eyes at all of them.
natural," Sally said.  "Nothing that happens in a ten meter radius of you is natural."  She turned to John.  "Where did you even
He was nodding politely and writing prescriptions when his phone vibrated.  He glanced over, but the text started with SHOPPING LIST so it clearly wasn't urgent.  (Once it had said ARMED GUNMEN.  He doesn't quite remember how he left the surgery that time, only that it had been a fairly brilliant day after that point.)  Once his patient had left, he picked it up to see what His Majesty was ordering.
He'd probably sent one last night when he'd gone out.  And maybe he and therosinlessbow had exchanged numbers, texted each other or something?  That would be someplace to start.
John actually stared at him in open-mouthed shock for a moment.  "That is," he said, "literally the worst pick-up line in the history of sex.  Seriously, Sherlock, have you
: Good.  I think we'll need to change locations; I doubt we'll have luck again in the same area.  There's a pub on Bethnal Green near Chilton Street.  Meet there at 8:45?
not to have to worry about his leg every damn moment--the pain had been a constant presence since he'd been shot, and he was going to enjoy its absence while it lasted.  Come to think of it, where was his cane?  He hadn't tripped over it yet.  He'd need to find it; couldn't guarantee that his leg would still work as well tomorrow morning.  The bathroom was empty, so he locked the door and pulled off his robe.
that was a lot of waxed chests.  And abs.  A lot of abs.  And…well, he was not going to spend too long staring at the arse, it was just impolite.  Even if he did put it on there.
Three hours ago, John might have freaked out at this, but the time spent in Sherlock's company had prepared him for a certain level of oddity.  He crawled in between Sherlock's spread legs and took over the unbuttoning.  "It's a bit early for that."
He catches up with Sherlock just before their hallway, grabs him by the arm, and drags him into his room, pushing the door shut behind them.
“Don’t you dare tell me you deserved it, or that you forgive me, or any of it!” John feels the tremor in his hand burn. He digs his nails into his palm.
But then John punches Sherlock and they're booted onto the street, Sherlock holding bloodied napkins up to his nose and John down the block, fuming and attempting to hail a cab.
The hand not occupied with Sherlock’s own goes to the nape of his neck, rubbing soothing circles against the skin below his hairline. John ignores the way his chest protests. He has just enough morphine left in his system to get him through this, for sure. If not, too bad.
“John,” he says, then looks into the room. “Oh,” he says, “good. The Marshal wants to speak with the both of you in his office.”
“She’s positively glowing,” he boasts, “Only called me an arse twice this morning.” There’s a pause before he adds stiffly, “Marshal Holmes, on deck.”
John experiences many things in the aftermath of Euros, Sherrinford, and Musgrave. The rebuilding of Baker Street, returning it to its former glory. He and Sherlock begin to take cases again. After a long period of tension and a surprisingly emotional apology, Molly returns to being their friend, and resumes her duties as “best godmother ever.”
And then his hand lifted away. John let out a breath he hadn't meant to hold, clenched his fist, and returned it to his side.
Regretfully, hesitantly, John pulls away from Sherlock and stands up, retrieving his shirt and pulling it on as he goes to the door. He looks out the peephole and sees Lestrade.
In all honesty, it almost doesn’t feel real. But John supposes that’s the luster of near-death, near-loss, and post-trauma life. Everything goes back to normal, back to good.
John squeezes his hand, a light pressure, warm. He returns it, leans forward toward their joined hands.
“Good,” Sherlock murmurs, eyes fixed on John. There’s a beat of silence. “Now repeat, but lead with your right foot.”
They have lunch together a few times a week for the next month before they go on a proper dinner date. She asks. He accepts, blushing, feeling a little incompetent but also relieved.
Greg shakes his head. “No, she’s just a friend, I think. Her and Seb went to school together when they were younger.”
Over time, he opens up a little more. But Mary still feels a certain part of it all has been left out.
Sherlock lets John practice at his own pace, allowing room between them for John to occasionally glance down at their feet, and they complete three stretches across the small space of the sitting room.
The chase, the fireworks, all lead in to Sherlock’s favorite moment—the calm after the storm, an eye in the hurricane that is to become their life.
John’s gaze follows. He catches four pilots walking toward them, two men and two women. “And who are they?”
He answers immediately, letting the phone clatter on the dashboard. “John, where are you? Are you alright?”
He gets the rest later on. Euros’ near-drop off the grid until just a few years ago, when a consulting criminal surfaces, and reveals an unhealthy obsession with the youngest Holmes. Even in containment, Euros followed Sherlock’s every move, turned Moriarty into the perfect puzzle, and managed to keep her presence almost negligible. Then when Sherlock’s “suicide assignment” came down the bureaucratic chain, her final problem over two decades in the making began with two words:
The whole thing was Bill's fault.  He had texted John one day when he'd been limping back from physio:
He sighed as he flipped back to the conversation.  Might as well figure out what they'd said, see if it jogged any memories.
The photo was very carefully taken, and showed a hand curved around the neck of a violin.  The arm that cradled the violin was long, white, and bare, lithe with muscle, the hand delicate and long-fingered, arched perfectly to support the weight of the instrument.  Although the violin body was mostly cropped out of the photo, there was the hint of an equally bare, equally pale, equally muscled shoulder underneath it just at the edge of the photo.
"I didn't want to be rude," Sherlock said, but his gasping breaths took the haughtiness out of it, left him sounding almost truthful.  "We're doing this wrong.  You need to lie back."
."  Some part of John realized he was being too truthful, but it was the middle of the night and he was done.  "You can't
"I have no communicable diseases, I assure you," Sherlock said, and took the initial starting photograph of his lips.  John knew he should head to his room to get changed out of his work clothes, should find some chores to do, should just go
The tension in her shoulders disappeared and she sank back into her chair.  “Right? Saves so much bullshit.  And, again, we don’t hate each other, so.”  She glanced at her phone for the time.  “8:30.  My turn to get the bill, yeah?  And then you can help me pick out what two dozen year threes will eat tomorrow.”
John laughed bitterly.  "That's even worse.  Hello, attractive single woman.  Let me buy you a drink, but nothing too expensive, since I'm broke.  I've got a fistful of scar tissue on my shoulder and I limp for no apparent reason.  Shall we go back to yours?  Mine's a miserable bedsit only slightly larger than my quarters in Afghanistan."
John held him closer.  "What percentage of your behavior these past few weeks has been an attempt at seduction?"
John sipped his tea.  "This is like the cigarette ash, isn't it.  You're going to post some mad monograph to your website, explaining minor details that nobody but you is ever going to be able to see, and then you'll use the fact that you've written this ridiculous document to bludgeon the rest of us with our stupidity at any possible opportunity.  Have I about got the gist of it?"
Sherlock recapped the lipstick and dropped it on the side of the sink.  "Familiarity, I suppose.  Mummy always went to the cosmetics section there when she was in town."  He turned and examined John.  "When have you ever been in Space NK?"
The water came to a boil.  He pushed down his confusion, poured the water over his tea bag.  All right.  So, probably not roofied.  Just sore.  And then…well, there was no point being subtle in his own head; he was pretty sure he hadn't been fucked last night, because it had been a while and he'd be feeling it.  The sore thigh muscles, they might suggest that he'd topped, but nothing unequivocal.  He'd woken up in his pants with his clothes in a pile next to the bed, so he hadn't showered, at least not at home.  He didn't smell like come, but he did smell like sweat, like he'd gotten a workout.  So if he'd gotten laid, he'd cleaned up well, but he hadn't taken a shower.
Not-John stared him up and down again, and George stood a little taller to present himself.  Not-John nodded.  “Preliminarily.”
He reached into John's pocket and pulled out his phone.  "Look, I'm putting this app on your phone.  Don't argue with me, and don't try to delete it, which you won't be able to do anyway, you're miserable with technology.  Make a profile at home tonight.  You'll thank me later."
He forced himself to stay in the moment, and not get lost thinking excessively about Sherlock's tongue.  "You realize you've just ruled all women ever as outside the class of civilized persons."
And that was as far as John got, because Sherlock leaned over and pressed his lips against John's.  Softly, mouth closed, lips notched into each other, not even moving, really.  All John could think was
, he thought, every time he saw the color slicked on Sherlock's face, in lip prints on cups, smeared on white towels on the bathroom floor, and they had had a good row about precisely whose job it was to figure out how to get an oil-and-wax based stain off terrycloth, but John had still been thinking the name, over and over again, an infinite loop of sexual agitation.)
John had nearly finished his cup of tea before he made the connection.  "Wait.  Does no interference mean you haven't had anything to eat or drink today?"
No.  Wait.  His eyes refocused on a tall man staring at his phone.  Thin and pale-skinned, yes, and that neck--John remembered that neck.  Since the man wasn't looking up, John took a moment to study him.  Sharp cheekbones, wild hair, eyes that flashed as he scrolled through his phone.  Lovely hands, long-fingered, strong palms.  John could come up with a long list of inappropriate things he might like to do with those hands.  He was odd-looking, but lovely at the same time.  For a moment, he let doubt push against him--what in the world could he possibly see in John?  But he'd messaged him, both times; he'd said John had surprised him like it was the best thing in the world.  So John squared his shoulders and walked up to the beautiful man on his phone.
Bill held up his pint in solidarity.  John clinked it.  They both drank.  The pause that followed could have been awkward, but it wasn’t.  This is what he liked about Bill.
"It's just a penicillium," Sherlock said.  "As long as you don't feel ill, you probably didn't ingest enough to be toxic.  Don't throw it out, I'm measuring it."
The man's eyes kept darting all over John's face, his shoulders, his hands.  "You woke up bruised and sore, knowing you'd gone out with a stranger the night before, and yet when asked to do the same thing again, you chose to do it without asking questions.  Why?"
This was it, John realized.  It wasn't just him who knew something interesting had happened last night.  Maybe he could just bluff through the conversation?  Propose a proper date?
by it.  He wanted to know how that arm moved on the instrument, wanted to know why the violin mattered so much, wanted to know something about the person behind it.  And, quite possibly, to fuck him at the end of the conversation.
Christ.  No one had ever tried to turn John's title sexy before, which struck him now as a terrible lack.  He rubbed his thumbs against the skin just above Sherlock's waistband, where his shirt had come untucked in their tangle.  "I assume there's a bedroom in this place?  Because I think the best way I could show you my style involves you being horizontal."
"  He stuck the magnifier in his pocket.  "It didn't surprise me when the cabbie was put-off, or the people on the street.  I suppose I was giving you all too much credit.  Certainly one should expect nothing but convention and the pointless defense of it from Scotland Yard.  I don't know why people are so horrified by transgressions of the gender binary, it's a pointless cultural convention that men don't wear cosmetics, and while certainly it's unusual--"
John watched him for a moment, and then burst out laughing.  Sherlock looked even more shocked, his lips parted beneath his long fingers, and if that wasn't the most accidentally suggestive thing John had seen in a while.  "You're amazing," he said, still laughing.  "And an idiot.  How did you miss that?  The whole site is full of naked people.
"That's wholly unsanitary," John said as he hung up his coat.  He didn't mention that usually the only people who shared drinks were blood relatives or long-time lovers, because he wasn't entirely ready to hear which category Sherlock considered him analogous too.
Sherlock ignored him to zoom in on the photo.  "Look at the differential impression of the tuberculum labii superioris!  Oh, this is excellent."  He looked over at John then, and broke out in a smile, a wide, happy one with red lips stretched over white teeth.  John couldn't help but smile back.
“Right, Sherlock, you come help,” Mary said, pushing herself up from the couch, gesturing towards the kitchen.
Sherlock hadn't yet acknowledged him, and continued to smoke aristocratically.  His cheeks hollowed when he pulled on the cigarette, and his lips developed fine creases that highlighted how tightly pinched he held them.  He removed the cigarette, dropped it, still smoldering, in the ashtray, exhaled a fine cloud of smoke, and picked up his phone, which was lying next to it.  With utter calm, he photographed his lips.  Then the turned the phone around and began examining the photo.  "Hmm," he said.  "The creases are shallower than in the straw experiment, but are more visible because of the irregular suction.  Interesting."  He made a note in the notebook, which was next to where his phone had been.
this to me," he said, and his voice broke on it.  He closed his eyes and pressed his hand to his mouth to hold in how close he was to breaking, to shouting out
“Sainsbury’s down four streets or so.  I’ll show you,” George said.  The our in reference to her and John was not new, but he supposed it was time to broach it.  “You and John, you seem to manage the co-parenting thing well, then.”
and he didn't have a bloody clue what it was.  This wasn't curiosity, it was necessity.  He needed to know what happened.
"Mmm, obviously," Sherlock said.  "I'm a detective, a consulting detective, it's like being a private detective but less boring.  I'm investigating a string of burglaries, and I've managed to identify the common thread, a major historical restoration firm that has an expanding client base.  The man who is performing the burglaries is a contractor, works in period reproduction fabrics, and uses his visits with the upholstery company as a way of casing houses and identifying valuables that are improperly stored.  He's going to break into one of the houses I mentioned earlier.  We caught him last night trying to get into a first floor flat in Clerkenwell, but he managed to give us the slip, and, in the process, gave you the injuries you noticed this morning.  Your hand-to-hand combat skills are excellent, by the way, not what I was expecting from a trained medical professional.  You'll have to share with me whatever details of your military career aren't classified, though I'll probably be able to deduce some of those as well.  Is that enough for the moment, or would you like to know more?"
had the decency to look embarrassed.  "I did quit.  But, well, I came up to tell this one to stop, and I suppose I got distracted."  She sighed and put her cigarette out.  Sherlock automatically held up a hand next to her, and she used it to balance herself into a standing position.  "I'll let you boys be."
He waved and the man waved back before coming up and seizing his reins. Nodding in comprehension, Gregson allowed Doctor Watson to steer them to safety. Shortly, though it felt longer, they were approaching the small stables kept on the disused farm Holmes and Watson had purchased.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  "It's been a mere six hours.  I don't think you have any cause to be worried at the moment, doctor."
He did not think it was his imagination when he heard a distant laugh of thanks, or saw a flash of twirling shapes amid the darkness outside or suddenly smelled musk, food and ale.
Silent trees stood at a distance watching him, bare of their leaves, but Gregson was undaunted. Life was not dead, merely asleep. Soon enough he would celebrate the winter solstice with his uncle and lover. On the shortest day they would sing and dance, feast on carefully stored provisions and drink. They would recall tales of the coming spring and the blessed sun who would now linger for longer in the heavens. Hope for warmer weather and the passing of winter would be renewed.
Waving away the concern of the stable master, Gregson secured his sparse luggage of one bag to the bridle and mounted. Rose whined in recognition and with a chuckle and a pat Gregson was on his way.
A square-rigged ship, with three masts, deep crimson flags reminding Watson of blood on his surgical blade or staining the sands of Maiwand. She had a large hold, but was not built for speed so vulnerable to pirate hunters. However, this Captain who spoke musically in Spanish whilst his Englishman captor jabbered away in Watson's left ear, had no concern for beyond the bow of his elegant lady stretched a
Once satisfied his lover would be silent for a few seconds, Watson withdrew, face flushed to glare sternly at the source of his trouble. Sherlock blinked slowly, still dazed from their kiss, a loving smile curving his lips.
Quite a vision and one that summed up a former military doctor, now occasional civilian doctor and  nearly full time partner to one consulting detective, who played the violin like a Master, or allowed it to warble if on a line of peculiar thinking.
Holmes, the maniac,  grinned and sprinted off while surprise was still with them. Watson followed with a slashing sweep of the curved blade at the nearby rigging. A moment later there was an ominous creak and men and women were scattering with roars and shrieks.
Visibility was now nearly gone, the sun causing everything to be shifting shades of ivory and white with a pale blue-silver gleam that added an ethereal edge to the world. His garments afforded little protection against the angry elements. Gregson ignored the icy jagged fragments fear underlying his confidence, instead driving his will ahead and projecting calmness to Rose.
A long thin arm gestured towards the tree, which I readily agreed was essentially a large green bush and creating a lovely smell of pine in our sitting room.
Tugging up his scarf so it covered his mouth and cheeks Gregson squinted. The morning sun glittered amongst the ivory curtain causing flashes of white to sparkle and dance in his vision, but he could just espy the path ahead. Faithful and resolute Rose knew the road well and with head bowed continued on at a fast trot.
Had we helped a priest recently? I racked my brains even as I glared at Sherlock who was gasping for laughter.
For now though he rejoiced in their love. Only when sleep threatened him did Gregson make his excuses. His friends wished him a good night and observed his departure intently.
how Watson envisioned his life ending, or indeed, his lovely summer holiday. Evidently he had been remiss in his lecture to Holmes on the proper holiday spirit - taking on a case involving gold doubloons and mysterious islands in the balmy waters off Nassau.
” His annoyed grunt was due to still not finding a scientific explanation for the whole process, which supplied never ending amusement for both Watson and Gregson.
Holly and ivy were ostensibly innocent, yet the rest of his supplies had a flair of being used either in Catholic ritual (his incense for one) or in a more pagan sense, such as his wand and spell book.
"Mmm," Sherlock said, and checked his phone for the time.  "Well, it's a bit late to catch a film, but what do you think about dinner, John?"
"Oh, I don't like him," Mrs. Hudson was saying, shaking her head at the TV.  "Look at his hair."  She tapped the ash from her cigarette into the crystal ashtray on the coffee table.
There was a moment of silence, and then Sherlock's feet stomped off.  John was nearly asleep when the stomping feet came back up the stairs and into his room.  It took a second for him to process the smell of carbon and campfire.
So after the 3rd drift and almost hitting his head once again, John called Sherlock and laid him on the couch, promising to watch over him, not long after keeping eye contact that Sherlock drifted silently into a deep sleep.
"We should get take out, lets go outside? Maybe a night stroll..?" Johns lips twitched slightly in amusement, he'd let this slid, but there was no way in hell that he was going to clean up sherlocks mess
This question seemed to make Doctor Watson's face fall "I don't know....it's been years...I believe my mate might be dead"
Sherlock wouldn't admit it out loud but he was head over heels for his Army Doctor and Captain, maybe it was love at first sight.
It registered to the filming crew that he possibly forgot his lines or was messing around, although Lara still had no idea what was going on, making Martin and the rest of the crew snicker
both john and Sherlock picked up their phones "uh, Sherlock?" John continued to scroll down his phone "why am I getting the emails to your website?"
But for now, John was going to take it and enjoy the moment of the man he would protect from harm and the man he secretly loved
"I was wondering if you'd like to possibly consider....permanently staying in my home- ah! I mean our home! Possibly! Maybe! If you'd like to stay that is!"
For Sherlock it was quite easy to get Passion to open up to him, but when he introduced him to Mycroft, Passion wasn't all that trusting, he would hiss and protest every time Mycroft got near him or Sherlock
Sherlock shot a look to john "John! If you had sense at all, you'd find it...." Sherlock mind made deductions and past over the previous moment ".... fascinating too..."
Creatures dozed under the soil in their winter sleep with plants also resting before flourishing once more. Now he drifted past them, aware of the other animals who slept during the day waiting for night or the day animals which now huddled to hide from the snow storm.
Holmes sighed theatrically, but conceded and restrained himself to carrying Gregson’s bag, ignoring all protests to the contrary. Then he vanished to fuss over the bath while Watson helped him unpack due to his numb fingers. Somehow, Gregson found himself hurried along to a welcoming bath whereupon Watson remained to assist.
The subject matter was not exactly Christmassy in my opinion, though Sherlock’s mind did work in ways marvellous and unknown to even my good self.
Lamps burned on either side of the door and just inside stood a relieved detective. He didn’t speak until they were all inside and the door securely locked. Only then did the detective embrace Gregson.
Gregson had to concur with that declaration so he gave up all fight and enjoyed the deliciously hot water.
Then, from the relentless snow, appeared a man on a horse. Gregson nearly laughed. Doctor Watson! The light was an old-fashioned lamp fastened to his saddle.
Then Sherlock proved he was as fleet of foot as he boasted, and in a flash both men had not merely walked the plank, but raced over it to dive into the deep blue waters.
“Sherlock, my love, while I am glad you support my profession – at least occasionally – a set of surgeon’s tools, even in miniature, is not deemed good taste for a Christmas tree.”
Holmes looked unconvinced. "Once we are back at our holiday home I shall check your shoulder, in case your old wound is playing up."
The painful hold that his companion - well, captor - had on Watson’s arm was an annoyance moreso because he had chosen the arm with his weakened shoulder, still stiff from his wound at Maiwand. Otherwise Watson could have mentioned what a poor grip his captor had on his person, but such criticism surely wasn't polite and indeed, rather detrimental for their future chances for escape.
Ignoring the jeers of the flamboyant clad pirates that surrounded him, Watson casually surveyed the area again.
“Come,” Sherlock touched my wrist, entrapping me with his slender and delicate fingers. The pale digits against my still tanned skin always made me shudder in happiness, as did the sensation of the calloused fingers. I couldn’t help placing my large hand over them and smiling up at the pale flush in Sherlock’s cheeks.
Still…he would have to ride harder if he were to reach his friends before the snow made it impossible to travel – and being trapped outside would not be good. Usually Gregson would have stayed the night in the village in such conditions, but he had brought with him certain supplies he feared to be discovered upon his person.
"You should take better care of your Lady!" Watson shouted, glee pumping through his veins, energising him in his pursuit of Holmes. His clever detective had taken advantage of the chaos Watson had unleashed, briefly detouring to snatch at a pile of glittering treasure, quick as one of his Irregulars.
My incorrigible detective had removed a stunning glass ornament, beauty in its delicate lines and fragile nature. Silver colouring brought life to the decoration, creating shading and highlights as appropriate.
For a moment Watson ignored the multitude of odours, both pleasant and unpleasant unlike, as he closed his eyes temporarily against the glare of the midday sun - not an insignificant prospect in the blazing heat of the Caribbean. Above his head was the creak of rigging, beside him he heard the shift of his companion - boots on wet deck under which the wooden boards groaned slightly as the ship rolled on the waves, small as the waves were at present.
"Ghosts or time slipping? Oh Watson, if only I had time to ask questions. Did you have to throw your punch - as admirable as it was - so soon?"
Formally a hotbed for pirates Watson had believed them to hunted down years ago. He had clearly been mistaken.
Since meeting Mr Sherlock Holmes and eventually developing a very intimate relationship of a romantic overture, Christmas had taken on added meaning.
Worry tickled at him. In good weather he had another fifteen minute journey, in these conditions it would take half an hour at least. Could he and Rose manage? If they wandered off the path and somehow stepped onto a frozen pond they might slip and be debilitatingly injured, or they might reach the cliff edge and tumble off…neither option was appealing.
In a definite spirit of Christmas Cheer I went to join one Mr Sherlock Holmes for a personal massage, hopefully followed by an undisturbed private session of festive celebration.
The door was locked so we were safe. I therefore felt confident in my actions, secure in the knowledge that Mrs Hudson would sound the alarm should visitors intrude upon our sanctuary.
First things first though, he must arrive at his friends’ home. Bending down over the saddle Gregson concentrated on following the thread that connected him to their destination.
Deciding it would be wise to hurry along with whatever nefarious plans my darling had concocted I rose somewhat stiffy, (the cold weather always had my leg play up) and guided us to our splendid tree.
Laying them on the window sill to grant some protection whilst he slept and his guardians watched, Gregson peered into the cold night where the blizzard raged.
Swiftly they were on the narrow winding path which led to the lonely cottage, perched on a cliff high above the sea.
A devious man, Krämer had concealed his tracks well, ensuring that it was difficult to prove his involvement until Sherlock, (after being informed of the particulars of the Dickens’ tale by someone who read outside the detective’s understandably specific parameters), had laid a trap and uncovered the spirit for a flesh and blood man.
“I assure you my dear Watson, you have provided me with many hours of concern over the years,” retorted Holmes who then embraced his dear friend. Their embrace lasted much longer and was full of whispers.
Sherlock snorted and his long delicate fingers were soon darting about with his glass ornaments, the aforementioned paper cut outs and of course, the miniatures. Understanding the battle was lost I focused on seizing a suspiciously looking painted matchbox to discover that it exploded into showers of shredded colour paper, obnoxious noise and… frankincense?
"Your life's gone to shit," Bill said.  "You need to have something to remind you that life's worth living.  Therefore.  Laid.  As soon as bloody possible."
"For your experiment."  John ran his thumb over Sherlock's lips, and let his own curve into a small smile.  "It's a very distinctive pattern."
"A date?" Sally said.  "Sherlock!"  She reached out and walloped him on the arm, and he jumped slightly and made a face.  "You do not take a date on a stakeout with you, Sherlock!  You take him to the cinema, or to dinner, or maybe an art gallery or something.  No crime on dates!  It's a rule!"
Well, there must have been, he rationalized.  Because he'd definitely gone out with someone last night.  So he took a deep breath, turned on his phone, and loaded Grindr.  Let's see what he'd said.
"Mmm, the hair's not the problem," Sherlock said.  His elbow was bent and propped on the arm of the chair, and the cigarette dangled from it languidly, a bright red ring around the filter.  "Look at how he cuffs his trousers.  No wonder she's cheating on him."  He brought the cigarette to his lips, and wrapped them around it smoothly.
"Sometimes.  Maybe you want to make them a little darker or pinker or whatever."  She shoved him away a bit.  "Did you delete personal space?"
John insinuated a leg between Sherlock's, and rocked his hip against the firm length of his cock through his trousers.  "That was brilliant.  The whole night."  Sherlock's eyes had shuddered closed, and he was gasping as John pressed into him.  "I've never done anything like that before."
"They were…unexpected.  Not that your attraction is generalized, but the strength of emotion attached to your response.  I was…not expecting that."  He looked almost embarrassed to have missed it.
John blinked.  That was…that was brilliant.  Everything the man had said, it had been obviously true, and so…so comfortable.  John had never felt quite so pinned, and yet there was nothing negative about it.  No judgment that he was invalided, no questions about why he wasn't employed right now, no odd fetishization of either of his careers.  Just the simple facts: you are a doctor, you are a soldier, you are yourself.  He hadn't realized how much it
: That's to be expected, I suppose.  The bruises should clear up soon enough.  Have you noticed yet?
The problem was, he was curious.  Bill was right, he wasn't getting any better with so little in his life.  He needed an outlet, an adrenaline rush, something to keep himself going while he figured out what the hell he was doing.  And, yes, sex would do it--and, frankly, anonymous sex facilitated by the Internet seemed like an even better option, from a risk/reward point of view.  So he forced himself through the sign-up process, dutifully taking a terrible photo of himself, choosing a username that seemed innocuous, and filling out the small list of interests.  Taking a deep breath, he clicked through to see what the process looked like past that point.
“Right,” said Mary.  “Is four puddings too much, or shall I get out the Japanese Christmas cake and some coffee?”
"I've got one skill set, Bill.  It involves sewing up people who are bleeding.  Not terribly transferrable."
John groaned.  "Can't you go and order your own drink lids?  I do have a life that involves more than being your errand boy."
"Perfect," John said, and he hoped his smile suggested exactly what he was looking forward to after dinner.
The man glanced at his phone and then locked it.  "I'm fairly certain Rochester will try again somewhere along the next street over.  There are a number of houses that are using the same upholsterer as those we already visited.  He won't go back to Clerkenwell, not after last night, but he's got deadlines to meet, there's no way he won't be out tonight.  I was thinking we'd monitor the situation from the corner--there's a theatre there, we can pose as patrons waiting for standing room only tickets, at least for a little while.  After that we might need to come up with something else."
John dug his fingers in further to Sherlock's hair, and pulled a little, feeling experimental himself; the sudden extra tension in Sherlock's forehead and the way the tempo of his hand picked up was suggestive.  He let his hips begin to work in time with Sherlock's rhythm, let himself get noisier.  He wished he could keep them here all night, but orgasm was pressing up against him, desperate and hungry.  "Close," he said, loosening up on Sherlock's hair so he could move more easily.
"I…"  Sherlock shook his head.  "It seemed the norm.  I was just trying to behave in a way that matched local customs."
, which is not something Sherlock normally projects at all.  That's the reason why, despite being enough of a grown-up to recognize that he's attracted to Sherlock, John's been able to repress the fact without too much effort.  It's so
"Um."  John wasn't quite certain he wanted to have this conversation on the street.  "You do know what most people use Grindr for, yeah?"  Sherlock looked confused.  "Um.  To meet people.  For, um, sex, usually."
John was about to launch into a massive tirade on the topic of why "only wake me if something is on fire" and "if you want me to get up, set something on fire" were not actually synonymous when he took a deep breath and realized two things.  First, it was half-past three, and he doesn't want to wake Mrs. Hudson.  He was fairly certain that the volume at which the tirade would emerge would make that a distinct possibility.  Second, if Sherlock had sone to the trouble of finding something non-essential and flammable, setting it on fire in a way that would not cause permanent damage to either of them or the other objects in the flat, and bringing it to John, then he actually very much did want John awake, which implied that there was something going on.  Something personal, because if it had been a case he would be leaping around and making excited noises, not standing there in his dressing gown with staying-in lipstick on.  (Still fresh, even so late; maybe he had plans to see what more than 24 hours of wear did, or something.)  He cleared his throat and crossed his arms.  "Bit not good, Sherlock.  Listen, in the future, if you think you have a good enough reason to wake me up, just tell me it's important, and what it's about, and I'll decide whether it's important enough to actually have woken me at arse o'clock, okay?  No need to set my possessions on fire."  He paused.  "Also, you need to buy me another copy of that."
Sherlock looked up.  "Where?"  He ran his tongue over his lips again, pushing this time, as if to cover more territory, to greedily occupy more of his face.
“Nah, his sister’s an obnoxious drunk in Scotland and he’s learned not to be a martyr, sometimes.  New brother-in-law’s house.”  The front door opened.  “And that’s them back now.”  She patted George, and he took the hint and sat up away from her before Naz opened the door.  “There’s my love.  How was dinner at Mycroft’s?”
"Not yet," Sherlock said, and his breath vibrated against the damp material he was hovering over.  "It wouldn't do to have worn it all off before the main event."  And he curled out his tongue, slowly and sinuously, to run it along the visible ridge of John's frenulum.
"I'm certain some are reasonable."  Sherlock slid the cup across to John as he reached for his phone to document the condition of his mouth.
and all he could feel was the waxy-slick press of the lipstick between the skin of his lips and the skin of Sherlock's, as if it were a third party to the kiss, bringing them together and holding them that way, close and entangled.  Sherlock's hands loose at his side, and John's were pinned between their chests, his elbows pressing into Sherlock's ribs.  After a moment exactly long enough for John to be fully aware of Sherlock's heat against him, and too short for him to have managed a reaction, Sherlock pulled away.  He looked uncertain for a half second, but then he smiled.  And then he pulled his mobile out of his pocket and took a picture of his lips.
"Women.  Get cappuccino foam off their lips.  With their tongues, instead of using a napkin like civilized persons."  He demonstrated again, passing his tongue across his lips, its paleness a shocking contrast to the lipstick.
He grasped her by the wrist this time, and started striding away.  "I require your expertise.  Lestrade, count the broken flowerpots, and then check the pockets of the victim, you'll find a note there.  Back in fifteen."  He held up the crime scene tape, pulled Sally under it, and let it snap down behind them.
There was nothing but silence from the person in front of him.  He opened his eyes, expecting to see that Sherlock was looking puzzled, or had put on his apologetic face.  But that wasn't how he looked.  He looked--John had only ever seen him look like this once, for that thirty seconds when he thought John was Moriarty, and then when he knew John was a bomb but couldn't do anything about it.  It was surprise, but it was also terror, and it was also
"Well then, John said.  "Let's try to get this wrapped up in good time, then.  Hopefully without more head trauma."
"There's a good Chinese right down the street from my place that's open late," Sherlock said, still grinning.
She yanked her arm away, and slapped him hard on the arm.  "Hands to yourself, madman.  OK, look.  The colour you're wearing is dramatic, attention-getting, blatantly sexual."  Sherlock's forehead creased a little at that.  "It's a date lipstick, maybe a formal occasion if you're of a dramatic bent and want to draw eyes.  For daywear, women wear lipstick that closely matches their natural lip colour.  See?"  She pointed at her own mouth.
"What, when I've had my kidneys eaten by a serial killer?"  John takes his phone back and stares dubiously at the little green icon downloading.
It was raining out, and John had gotten soaked to the skin on the walk from the tube to the flat, and he'd also had quite a frustrating half-shift at the clinic (made more frustrating by being a
"Oi," he said, when he got there.  The gray-haired man had just left, but the woman had stayed.  "Stop ripping the scab off before it can form.  Here, sit."  He pushed him down onto the hood of the car they were standing near.  "Keep your hands out of the way and I'll clean it for you.  Wouldn't want your idiot head getting scars on it."
"And then there's him!" the woman said, gesturing towards John, though she was talking to Sherlock.  "It's bad enough you getting involved with cases, Sherlock, but now you're dragging civilians into it?"
Sherlock sniffed and curled up on his side against the arm of the sofa, wrapping his arms around his legs.  "If I'd known you were this fussy I'd never have offered you the flat."
I don't suppose I called you, or said anything else at any point about last night?  Because I can't remember a bloody thing.
"When you put it like that," John said.  Interested, he walked into the bathroom and picked up the lipstick.
John briefly considered making up an entire story about Sherlock's secret life as a burlesque performer, but thought that was a bit much.  Plus, for all he knew, Sherlock
"That does explain a lot," Sherlock said, almost to himself.  He pressed the fingers of one hand to his mouth and appeared to think intensely.  "Certainly the tone of many of the profiles makes a good deal of sense in that case.  I had this problem with ChatRoulette, too."
The two men came to stand in the doorway, John in a garish Christmas jumper and Not-John apparently conceding the season enough to wear a forest green shirt.  “Honestly, Sherlock,” said John, leaning into the other man.  “There is such a thing as moderation.”
And, when Sherlock consented to drink a glass of water, if John watched the way his lips pursed against the cool wet glass, leaving a soft red print behind; or if he couldn't draw his eyes away from the way Sherlock's lips curled around the tines of his fork as he picked at the spag bol that John practically had to hold him at gunpoint to get him to consume; if he looked up, each time Sherlock's phone timer went off, to watch him stare with total focus at his phone as he documented the state of his lush, sensuous lips--
"I can't believe I find that a relief," Lestrade said.  "Not that it would have been a problem, if, you know, the other."
: You mention you're back in the East End in your profile, means you lived there before, but aren't from there originally, you don't name it as 'home' or anything like that.  From your self-presentation you aren't a part of the upscale redevelopment, don't mention being Jewish and aren't Asian, so you're living there because it's cheap and at least minimally familiar.  So, familiar but not home?  You lived there at university.  What universities are in the East End?  Not many, particularly not that are selective--your profile is less poorly written than most of these on this site, which is not saying much, but still.  So, likely Queen Mary.  Your profile suggests both practicality and an interest in the application of knowledge, you're the type of person to want to do something hands on, so medicine.  Interesting that you don't say so, I'd imagine being a doctor would interest people.  Why didn't you list it?
The way she examined him meant she understood what he was trying to figure out, but her tone was still light when she responded.  “Yeah, he’s a great dad.  Kind of a shit husband, but.  We’re better off as friends.  And I’d rather have that than the opposite.”
"No, actually," Sherlock said, and he looked annoyed.  "I've conditioned myself not to notice when people are sexually attracted to me.  The likelihood of my actually being interested in sexual contact with any given individual is incredibly low, and I find it quite distracting.  Frustrating, to realize that what seemed like a useful data-management technique had such a central blind spot."  The hand on John's back was stroking, slightly.  John leaned against the wall, letting his body curl against Sherlock's, so that they were leaning against each other, entangled there by the door.  "I only started collecting relevant data after the cappuccino foam incident.  And even then it took me a while to try to determine the extent to which the lipstick was the causative factor, whether you were only interested in me because of my sudden change in appearance.  That was the real experiment tonight; would your reactions be about a fetishized interest in my mouth wearing this lipstick, or would it be more about a holistic attraction to my person?"
"Um.  Have I?"  John couldn't see any difference, and he was watching Sherlock's lips very, very closely right now.
"What?"  Sherlock blinked at him with narrowed eyes.  "No, of course not.  I just haven't put it on yet."
have a secret life as a burlesque performer.  He was remarkably good at doing his face.  "It's an experiment.  Been on since last Thursday.  Came home yesterday to find him trying to determine the difference in lipstick wear from eating with a fork and eating with a spoon."  At least that had resulted in Sherlock eating (although it had also resulted in John needing to go get more food, since Sherlock had demolished the contents of the fridge).
," before bracing himself on the hand not busy in his pyjamas and lowering his head to take in as much as he could of John's cock.
He paused.  No weakness in his extremities.  He'd gotten up and walked out of bed and to the kitchenette without his cane.  He hadn't even
shift--he couldn't turn down the work, but it still felt pointless to spend over an hour on the tube to spend four hours doing the most mind-numbingly boring doctoring possible).  He blamed these distractions for the fact that he did not notice what was different about Sherlock as soon as he walked into the living room.
“Yeah, makes sense,” he said.  “Where’s he live?  I’d imagine carting Naz across half the city would be a pain.”
Except, when he fought through those feelings, he also realized that he felt…well, bored by everyone.  Nobody had held
"One more test."  Sherlock took a long sip of the cappuccino.  When he pulled the cup away, his upper lip was covered in foam.  He set the cup down, and licked across it, just once, his swift, agile pink tongue wiping away all the foam that clung to the burning red of his lips.  "That is how they do it, correct?  I have no idea why people tolerate the foam, it gets everywhere."
John scrutinized the words, but he had no idea what they'd meant.  Surely he hadn't--I mean, therosinlessbow was a beautiful man who clearly had no problem propositioning absolute strangers for sex, what could John have possibly done that would have surprised him?  It had been years since John had gotten off with anyone in an alley anyway, months since he'd had sex at all; he was lucky if he had any skills left.
Sherlock groaned again, which nearly set John off, but then pulled off.  John wasn't disappointed, but Sherlock gasped out, "Fuck my face.  And
Deep breaths.  He brought his arms back up to cross over his chest, and meant the gesture as much as comfort as a barrier.  "All right," he said.  "Explain yourself."
While he waited for the water to boil, he took stock.  Headache, muscle aches: clearly too much to drink.  Although, funnily, he wasn't light-sensitive or noise-sensitive.  His mouth was a little dry, but not as bad as he would have expected.  He didn't feel hungover; he felt…tired, more than anything else.  But none of this explained the amnesia.  That had to be alcohol, right?  He supposed there was the barest chance he was roofied last night, but no nausea, dizziness, anxiety, weakness in extremities--
"Come on, then."  Bill waved his hand as if to draw more of the story out of him.  "Let's have the whole narrative."
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock," John said, and he let his hands tighten again, let his hips snap up more sharply.  Sherlock's eyes were open now, half-glazed, but desperately focused on John, as if only being entirely centered in this moment could get him over the edge.  "Your fucking mouth, Sherlock.  So gorgeous, and so, so fuckable. That's it, love.  Teasing me, all these weeks.  This is what you wanted, wasn't it.  Fucking
“Oh, shit,” she said.  “Well, that’s a problem, because I’m still in the bloody office.  Got caught up with something, just headed to the tube now.”
Sherlock's smile was returning, creeping up on him as if he didn't quite know what to do with it.  "You didn't."
He stepped forward then, put one hand on Sherlock's cheek, and leaned up to kiss him.  Sherlock's mouth was still open, and so John took advantage, pressing his upper lip into that space, and then gently using the tip of his tongue to trace the line on Sherlock's lower lip where external skin became the oral mucosa, where lipstick stopped and the warmth of his mouth began.  Sherlock's mouth opened slightly more, and John pressed in, curling the hand on Sherlock's face to angle him properly, and wrapping the other around his hip to pull him closer, so their bodies were just barely brushing against each other.  Sherlock's hands came to rest lightly on John's shoulders.  And then the kiss began to change.  John's hand on Sherlock's hip gripped tighter, pulled him closer; Sherlock's hands grew more confident, and one slipped down his side to push against the small of John's back.  Their mouths were fiercer, wetter, hungrier.  Sherlock stumbled back slightly to lean on the doorframe; John rocked his pelvis against him, and Sherlock moaned sharply.  John pulled his mouth away from Sherlock's and fastened it on his neck, running his tongue over the skin and brushing it with his teeth, just to hear Sherlock's ragged exhale and the shiver that ran through him.  When he pulled away, he saw that around the teethmarks were a blur of red, transfer from Sherlock's lips to his, and then to Sherlock's neck.  He looked up.  Sherlock's eyes were closed still, and he was breathing heavily.  His hands were still clinging to John (John's were doing likewise), and he very slowly pushed his face against John's hand where it lay on his cheek.  John stroked his face with his thumb, and Sherlock responded like a cat, pushing into it, his long shaking breaths purring out of him.  His lips looked nearly black in the darkness of John's room, and most of the lipstick seemed to have escaped past the vermilion border to end up above his lips.  John breathed out a faint laugh.  "You'll definitely want this picture, then."
Once John recovered the ability to breathe properly, he snorted.  "Yeah, well.  I'll get right on that.  Huge line of women eager to grab a piece of the crippled unemployed veteran market.  I'm absolutely serious boyfriend material, don't know why I didn't think of it before."
He sipped his tea.  What he remembered of last night was blurry, but he knew there had been a conversation on Grindr, and that, for once, it was appealing.  He remembered dressing and heading out.  And that was it, for the rest of the night.  So he'd start there; he'd finish his tea, shower, and then sit down at his phone and try to figure out what the hell happened.
John shook off the lingering embarrassment of how long it had taken him to pick out an outfit as he walked from where he'd gotten off the bus towards the designated corner.  He owned four pairs of trousers and ten shirts, and still he'd spent twenty minutes in front of his closet, and then another ten in front of the mirror trying to get his hair to look respectable--and then he'd remembered therosinlessbow explaining what his hair meant, which lead to a bunch of dreamy staring.  He had thought for a minute about bringing his gun with him--therosinlessbow
John was at the tube station, so he doesn't bother responding to that.  The bloke at Speedy's looked at him cross-eyed when he walked in to buy coffee with a cardboard tray of Starbucks and McDonald's, but he rolled his eyes and said, "Himself sent orders," which seemed to explain enough.
John huffed, too out of breath to properly laugh at him.  "Ah, yes.  The real issue is that people are stupider than you, and not that you have any modicum of privacy."
“Mmm.”  John took out his phone, sent a text, and dropped it on the table next to George before gliding back to the kitchen.  He glanced down to see it.  “I have something of yours,” he’d texted to Mary.  The screen went black before he could snoop anymore.
He couldn't blame them for staring.  When Lestrade had texted, Sherlock hadn't mentioned that he'd be showing up at the crime scene with his lips colored
It took John a good moment to consider this.  "So, when you messaged me last night--why did you do that?"
Sherlock pulled him up so they were face to face and wrapped his legs around him.  "Tuesday is a good day to move," he said, and kissed him.
He looked up when John approached.  His long face folded into a small smile.  "Ah, John.  You're on time.  Much appreciated."
John examined his lips more frankly than he'd ever done to anyone he wasn't trying to convince to kiss him.  (Which he wasn't.)  "How'd you get it all off?  I thought that color would stick or something."
Sherlock cleared his throat.  "John," he said, and the tentativeness was back.  "If I am understanding the situation properly, you are not opposed to my gathering experimental data in this circumstance, provided that my reasons for desiring to collect that data are specific to you, and not merely a function of your proximity.  Is that it?"
Sherlock grabbed his arm and stopped him.  "But the, um.  The sex thing.  If I had intended something along those lines?"
Mary leaned back in what looked like confusion, looked at John approaching—and burst into laughter.  The deepest kind, folding over, snorting in between breaths.  John stood there with the teacup balanced in his enormous hands, a sardonic smirk curling his lips. Mary stood up and wiped her eyes.  “Oh, shit.  You think this is John?”
"Mmm."  John didn't want to admit precisely how right he was.  "I'm certain it was a very simple deduction."
John took a deep breath.  He must have looked bloody terrible if Bill thought he needed something this badly.  "This is a terrible idea."
