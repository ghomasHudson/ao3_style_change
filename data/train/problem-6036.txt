Steve”
Once he entered the kitchen Tony grabbed a mug from the cabinet and placed it next to the coffee maker. Next, he searched through the remaining cabinets looking for anything to make coffee. Tony was more annoyed then he probably should be. “Jarvis,” Tony called out to the A.I. in the ceiling.
Tonight is Tony and Steve's date! But something goes wrong because of course, it does. Hopefully they can still make the best of it.
“Intro to studio art.” Tony said annoyed.
“Yeah, I’ve never been better.” Tony’s voice was raspy and choppy.
“Next,” the attractive stranger called out trying to get Tony’s attention. This did not work and Tony remained where he was and stayed in his daydream. “Excuse me … sir?” the man tried calling out once more.
“Bruce! This is Steve, from my art class and his roommate Bucky.” Tony tried to emphasize how he knew Steve without making it sound too obvious, just in case Bruce said something potentially embarrassing.
Tony quickly went into his room and changed into a clean pair of joggers and left.
“Up yours.” Tony remarked.
It was a beautiful day in New York City, the sun was out but not too hot and due to how early it was on a Saturday, there weren’t that many people out and about. The coffee shop Tony had in mind was surprisingly close. He had noticed the cafe opened a few weeks ago. Tony had been meaning to check it out but work got in the way.
Tony just rolled his eyes as he went to fill his thermos with the freshly brewed coffee.
Once he had a route in mind, he pulls out his phone and dials the number for Jarvis. “Hey, Jarvis I need you to send one of the self-driving cars over to Peter’s apartment. As fast as you can please,” Steve said firmly while running.
He definitely worked himself sick.
“Which-um-which-which floor are you?” Steve stuttered quietly, he was all of a sudden very insecure about his financial status.
“Sweet! See you then!”
Steve nodded and kept driving. After about five or six minutes he reached Tony’s penthouse. Steve got out of the car and helped Tony get out. He offered his weight for Tony to use as support and they walked into the building together.
” Tony was mentally kicking himself right now.
A short walk later he ended up at the cafe. When he walked up to the counter he could’ve sworn that Steve’s face lit up.
“Just grabbing dinner with my roommate, Bucky.” Steve gestured to the boy beside him, who mustered a quiet greeting. “How’s the rest of your day going?” The blond finished.
“Tony!” the somewhat familiar voice called out to him.
Steve got out of the shower and grabbed a white t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants and got dressed.
When Steve left the tower he decided to take a different route than he usually does. Today he’d be taking the scenic path. About twenty minutes into his run, his phone started to ring. For some reason that Steve couldn’t figure out, the Bluetooth in his headphones wouldn’t tell him who was calling, a robotic voice started to read out a phone number. Steve picked up the call.
Peter sat up against the fridge. The cold metal feeling nice against his back. He slowly drank water hoping it would help, but it didn’t. Somehow the water made him feel worse. Peter felt a headache forming. Everything around him was starting to spin. He placed the water bottle down next to him and closed his eyes hoping the spinning would stop.
“You seemed a little flustered at the counter. Steve smirked.
The sun shone brightly as the light crept in through the large windows in Tony’s bedroom. Tony groaned as he rolled over to see what time it is.
Tony smiled at Steve’s double text, it was pretty cute.
It's been a few days since Tony had last been into Steve's shop, so obviously, that needed to change. Once inside, he spends some time with Peter and Tony asks Steve an important question.
“Let’s get you set up on the couch, yeah?” Steve rhetorically asked as he led Tony to the couch. He set up some pillows and grabbed a blanket that was hanging off a nearby chair.
Suddenly they heard a retching sound. It could only be Peter. Steve and Tony both stood up. The two men entered the bathroom where the found Peter laying on the ground shirtless next to the ground. “Oh hey, Tony … when did you get here,” Peter said faintly, trying to sit up but he ended up falling back on the floor.
Tony shut his eyes and softly said “Please.”
Tony smiled at the note. It was sweet of him to leave one. Tony decided that he should go visit Steve at work. It was the least he could do.
“Hey, Pete.” Tony smiled at the boy, helping him sit up against the bathtub. “Do you think you have enough energy to take a shower?” Tony’s voice was soft and kind. Steve smiled to himself, he really enjoys the softer side of Tony that Peter brings out in him.
Before Steve could answer Peter, Tony yelled across the room “What movie is he putting on?”
“You woke up just in time! Are you ready for some of my world famous chicken noodle soup?” Steve flashed a cheesy grin and placed the bowl on the table closest to Tony.
“What’s the magic word?”
“Miss Greene?” Tony looked to see her nodding. He was glad he didn’t wander into the wrong class and make a complete ass of himself. “Sorry for being late.” he apologized with a half smile. He knew that he was charming as all hell even when he was half asleep and he was going to exploit that.
“I’ll be there soon,” Steve’s said ending the call with reassurance. But Peter didn’t hear that part because he had already passed out at this point.
Peter took the bottle from him and smiled. “Water made me dizzy, this is nice. Thank you.” Peter weakly smiled and then shut his eyes once more.
Tony and Bruce were quick to make it to their dorm room. Tony laid in bed and sped through the assignment making sure to hand it in before the clock struck midnight. About halfway through working on the assignment, Tony’s phone buzzed with a message from a brand new group chat. Where Steve had sent the picture. Tony smiled at his phone and kept working Once Tony was all finished, Bruce put on some random TV show in the background while he did homework. Tony, on the other hand, printed out two copies of the photo from dinner and began to write in his journal.
As he waited in line Tony’s gaze was graced by a beautiful figure with lovely blond hair. He continued to admire the figure that was working behind the counter. He was wearing a navy blue shirt that matched the sign and some of the couches. He was muscular and must’ve been crafted by the gods. Tony watched him work at making some sort of fancy drink, he could watch him work for hours.
“How about a Gatorade?” Steve placed the water bottle back and opened a bottle of red Gatorade for Peter.
Tony walked into the large science hall before class started and looked for Bruce. Once he found his friend he sat down and class began. The two boys spent the whole class time goofing off and writing little notes and doodles in each other’s notebooks. The class flew by. Mainly because neither of them were paying attention. The pair of friends got out of their seats and started to walk to the lab building where their next class would be held.
Steve smiled and went back into the kitchen.
” Tony laughed to himself and also decided to write his number on a napkin and leave it in the jar as well.
“The Breakfast Club” Steve replied.
Hey guys! I really hope ya enjoy the chapter!
“Hey! How are you feeling?” Steve’s bubbly attitude was infectious, causing Tony to smile.
“Well, they are divine.” Tony complimented. Steve’s face grew pinker. “Can I uh … ask you something?” Tony’s voice wavered
Peter was sick for the rest of the weekend, but he was glad to have Tony and Steve taking care of him.
The pair of roommates nodded and followed Tony to the table. The three boys sat down.
When Tony went to coffee shops he usually got the same thing: black coffee with five shots of espresso. Some might say five shots is overkill, but Tony has a lot of things to do and needs the energy.
The boys filled their walk with basic small talk that you’d expect pretty much every college freshman to be asking each other with questions such as: “What’s your major?” and “Where are you from?” Although through this Tony learned that Steve was an art major and from Brooklyn. While Tony wished to continue the conversation, unfortunately, Steve’s next class was held in the same building.
“Feel sick … please help … home alone.” As Peter was on the phone with Steve he started to crawl through the living room so he could unlock the door for him. “Please … hurry.” Peter managed to unlock the door before he eventually decided that the living room floor would be a good place to take a nap until hopefully, Steve came.
“Mister Parker is currently at 103.6-degree fever,” Jarvis said with a slight twinge of concern.
Normally, he would’ve given Steve a hug but Tony couldn’t risk getting him sick as well. Now that Tony was closer he could see that Steve wasn’t writing, but he was drawing on the napkin. Tony couldn’t quite tell what it was but it looked good. Once Steve saw that Tony was there he shoved the napkin and pen into his pocket.
~ Kate :)
Not wanting to look at himself anymore he pulled the mirror back revealing a collection of various medicines. Jackpot! He found what he was looking for, Tony grabbed the jar of Advil and the bottle of Dayquill and placed them on the sink.
“Steve … you came,” Peter’s words were a bit slurred but there was relief in his voice.
Steve was a little confused and that tone was very clear in his voice. But when he heard the soft cry of Peter’s voice asking him for help he stopped his run and started internally mapping out what would be the quickest way to get to Peter’s apartment is.
It all started when Tony woke up. The sun pouring through the windows was too bright for him. Tony sighed as he went to close the curtains. His head pounded, it felt like someone had shoved a wad of cotton in his head. He felt awful.
“Friday, please take a photo of Tony, Steve, and Peter,” Bruce quietly asked the A.I. Once he heard the shutter go off he asked one more request from Friday. “Please send that photo to Peter, Steve, and Tony.” Bruce heard the vibrations of their phones and took that as his cue to leave.
Once he arrived home, Tony went to the lab to try and work on some new versions of code for his latest AI project. While he was working he was interrupted by his phone going off.
“Hey! Are you free anytime this week?”
Once again that proved useless. Peter decided that maybe some water would help. He mustered all his strength to try and make it to the kitchen. Peter attempted to stand but he immediately fell to the floor, and it was too much effort to stand back up so he crawled to the kitchen. After what felt like forever, Peter finally made it to the kitchen. Using the fridge as support Peter lifted himself for long enough to get a water bottle from the fridge.
The ultimate irony is, there’s nothing remotely interesting about the situation.  It’s an apartment fire; a cold front prompts a slew of heater-usage and one loose coil sets a high-rise ablaze.  When she sees the smoke rising, she speeds towards the plume, trusting that someone on the street will call 911 and dispatch the proper authorities.  The elevator shafts won’t be safe, so she heads towards the stairwell, cautiously elbowing through the sea of people heading the other way.  The air gets thicker as she climbs, and she can hear the building creaking at the seams.  If she’s going to do something’s she needs to do it fast.
He starts talking almost without thinking about it.  “Your lungs feel like they're going to burst, not only from lack of oxygen but from the sheer force of holding in the carbon dioxide.  You desperately want to take a breath, but you know that the moment you do it’s all over.  Inhaling isn't going to do you any good.  But it’s habit, instinct, so as the seconds tick on your body compels you to move and grasp for one last bit of relief before you give up the ghost, and eventually you do.  But that just makes it worse.  The water rushes into your nostrils and to the back of your throat, and that’s when your gag reflex starts to kick in, but it’s too late; you’ve already opened the floodgates, and now there’s no empty space to push the water out.  All you can do is flail and desperately hope you reach the surface before your brain cells start dying from oxygen deprivation.  Near the end, your vision starts to white out, or maybe it’s black out, but there’s no goddam pearly glow like they tell you in all the stories.  It’s just a blur, but after a while you wonder if it might not be better to embrace it than to fight it.”
After a moment, Pepper picks up the slack.  “Tell him.”
Steve can briefly make out Thor’s yell and Tony’s familiar
He doesn’t say no.
He lets himself into a dark apartment that he hasn’t stepped foot inside in months and certainly hasn’t lived in for years. A thin layer of dust coats his meager furnishings, and the air has that thick, slightly-rancid smell of a place that no one has recently occupied. It’s fine, though. He’s not here for the ambiance. He needs to think, to babble to himself like a crazy person and then stare at a wall for hours without anyone judging him. And he doesn't know if he can do that with her lying wounded in a bed upstairs.
mindset is predicated on the belief that time is short and the end is near, so your stupid decisions in the present are totally justified.”  Tony’s voice drops, and he begins droning away in smooth, rolling syllables.
And there it is, yet another reason Tony is so irrevocably crazy over Steve.  Instead of worrying about the media frenzy destined to ensue if Captain America – gasp – dated a man, Steve’s mind immediately gravitates to the impact those rumors will have on Tony.  It’s not as if those tabloid bottom feeders haven’t tried anything and everything over the years to sell a few extra copies.  He doubts they’d stop at dragging Steve’s name through the mud if they could up their numbers with groundless rumors.
After a prolonged period of avoiding his face, Tony finally looks up from the ground, his eyes meeting Steve’s with a thousand unanswered questions.  Steve forces himself to meet that gaze, not willing to cede an inch in whatever mental standoff their engaging in.
As Steve crosses the room, settles himself in a plush leather rolling chair, and pulls out yet another thick book, Tony can’t stop a brief
to look away — This is an intimacy that does not belong to him — but his eyes remain unwittingly affixed to the figure on the bed.
“But you’re here now.  You’re safe.”

The suit moves toward him, each step accompanied by the slight
Tasha brushes past him and into the unit. Despite the fact that he knows she’s injured, she gives no sign of it, her gate as steady as if she were conducting a strategy meeting or walking down a red carpet.
Whatever it is he does or doesn’t find, Stark keeps speaking.  “Do you know Mount Sinai West?”
Tony shrugs.  “Boring.  Lots of meetings, lots of paperwork.  New York?”
doesn’t want to do this right now.  He’s sweaty, he’s tired, and his shoulder aches from where it collided with that piece of debris.  All he really wants to do is shower off and collapse for the next twelve hours, but Steve seems bound and determined to read him the riot act first.
Fury nods. “That sounds great Rogers, but are you just saying that because you’re actually all right or because you want me off your case?”
“That seems dishonest.”
, and it’s all Steve can do not to fall to his knees.  Instead, he settles for running his fingers back through Tony’s hair, dropping one hand to the nape of his neck and fisting the other firmly near the crown of his skull.  Tony, it would seem, approves of this move, if the groan he emits is any indication.  Steve can feel the vibrations against his lips, which
“I mean
“JARVIS?” Tony calls, his voice demanding an explanation.  “What happened?  Are we under attack?”
.”  Clint snaps his fingers on the final word and looks remarkably pleased with himself.  “Convenient that your name’s Steve.  That works really well.”  After a moment, his face shifts into a look of confusion.  “Why is Stark texting you gifs from children’s movies?”
,” Stark stresses, “is Dum-E.  He’s a helper-bot.  Well, he’s meant to be a helper-bot, but most of the time he’s just sort of a substandard lab assistant.  He makes mediocre kale smoothies and rarely follows instructions, but he’s mine, and I’d appreciate if you didn’t punch him into oblivion.”
“Yeah?” Steve asks. He doesn’t find the confidence as assuring as he assumes his partner means it to be.
.  More.  More of that.  He opens his mouth, inexplicably trying to catch the last bit of the soundwaves, which Tony takes as an invitation to deepen the kiss, running his tongue along the inside of Steve’s mouth with the same meticulous attention he gives to everything he’s passionate about.  Steve hadn’t really thought about how Tony’s single-minded focus would translate to the bedroom, but now it’s all he can think about.
Fair enough.
and he hasn’t said anything?  “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asks, somewhat taken aback.  Granted, he didn’t do the right thing and tell Tony the truth either, but it’s odd that Tony would hold back something that big for so long.
And Natasha Antonia Stark has Iron Man’s arc reactor embedded in the center of her chest.
Tony moves his fingers around and finally hovers over a title.  “Ooh,
She smiles, but there’s more pain than pleasure in the movement. “You’re smart, Winghead. I’m sure you can figure it out.”
of unseen particles circles back and forth through the torus faster than the speed of light.  He’s done it.  The reaction has finally reached stasis –
"I thought it was all I could have," Steve interrupts his voice barely a whisper.
He dips his head toward her. “Ms. Stark.”
it works – it will be a sustainable source of clean energy.”
“Maybe?”  He thinks they are at least, but at times he’s not so sure.
She’s mentally contemplating the merits of chucking her phone against the wall when a new message finally pops in.
nonetheless – and he can’t even follow through.   Now he’s back to square one, sparring with Natasha and no general prospects in life.  So yeah, he’s frustrated.
The shock at seeing the Star Wars image jolts him out of his texting coma.  What the hell?!  When did Steve learn how to do that?  Gifs are
“No,” Steve answers back, and the smile on his face suddenly makes Tony very nervous.  “I think I have a better idea.”  He swipes the phone off of the desk and focuses on a point directly behind Tony.  “Hi, Dum-E!”
“It’s uncertain at this time,” JARVIS calls, “but the power failure seems to originate from somewhere in Chinatown.”
“Damn straight.”  Tony takes a moment to gather himself, secretly amused by events but still determined to swipe that – thing – away from Dum-E when Steve’s not looking.
“It’s your life, though. I’d never intentionally barge into…something like that.”
“It means,” Natasha cuts in, “that you’ve somehow managed to get close to Stark in a relatively short time frame.  And that’s unusual, particularly for Stark.”
“Nat, if there’s anything about this century that’s overwhelming, it’s being so out of touch with everything!”  He jerks the strap of his messenger bag over his shoulder harder than necessary, and his face presses into the phone’s touch screen.
And isn’t that just rich, considering the state Tasha’s in.  Steph deliberately looks the other woman up and down.  “And you get a pass?”
“Something’s off.”
me?” It’s both an accusation and a question.
“Since he’s more capable of looking after your wellbeing.”  Well that was just all kinds of unfair.  JARVIS, though, persists with his misinformation but shifts his approach.  “You will be in no condition to woo Captain Rogers if you are functioning with diminished brain capacity.”
Natasha presses on. “Are we divvying up the city now? Mom gets Manhattan, Dad gets Brooklyn, and the kids get ferried across the East River on weekends and every other extraterrestrial invasion? Cause I have to say, Steve, Brooklyn takeout sucks, and feeding everybody costs an arm and a leg.”
“But why?” he asks.
Steve doesn’t quite understand what she is she’s looking for since it’s not exactly his place to offer permission or absolution. And if Natasha’s relationship with Shellhead predated his arrival in the twenty-first century then it’s not exactly as if it’s in his power to wreck it.
Steve bristles at that.  “That’s uncalled for.  Tony’s a swell guy.”  Clint throws his palms up in a gesture of surrender and takes a slight step backwards.
Steve momentarily debates prevaricating again, but then decides to go with a redacted version of the truth. “I envy you,” he confesses.
He turns his head back over his shoulder only to find that Tony is staring at him, and, much to his chagrin, he feels his face heating up.  It wasn’t like he’d never stripped down in front of anyone before; Army life quickly robbed him of any pretensions of modesty.  But to the best of his knowledge, no one he’d undressed in front of before stared at him like that wanted to rip those clothes right back off.  He mentally shakes himself and reminds himself that
“What was that?”  Steve’s shocked voice sounds from behind him, much closer than it should be.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“You knew?!”
“So, it’s been you the whole time?  The Chitauri and the statues and
Clint frowns.  “Did you say
However, that doesn’t mean he can’t royally butter Steve up first.  If he’s going to drop that massive truth bomb on Steve, then he’s going to make sure it comes at the end of a night that makes him want to stick around.  All he has to do is…
out, because that would talk a level of gumption he can’t bring himself to muster.  Anything remotely resembling a romantic overture runs the risk of losing Steve, which is Not Acceptable under any circumstances.  Ergo, instead of asking the object of his oh-so-unrequited affection out on an actual date, he’s proposing a non-date, in which Steve can choose to accompany him to a social event strictly as friends.
Except Steve has frozen up like he is one of those dumb statues.  The happy art-geek of a few minutes ago has disappeared and been replaced by someone rooted to the spot.  Just when he thinks he’s, you know,
Fury reaches behind his desk and pulls a small, rectangular object out of a slot on his computer. He holds it up with two fingers, looking pointedly at Steve.
He’s not proud of himself and he knows that it’s the coward’s way out, but he knows himself well enough to know that his impulsive decisions are...not always the smartest choices, and he can't afford to screw up what is undoubtedly his most important relationship. Late that night he takes an outrageously expensive taxi ride to Brooklyn and hopes that the physical boundary of the East River will provide the illusion of mental distance.
distracting as the woman can be in person, Steph finds that her absence is just as problematic.  After two months of living with her, the mansion seems unnervingly empty when Tasha’s not filling it with her overly-loud comings and goings.  How one tiny woman manages to take up so much space is something Steph will never quite understand.  Still, the silence she leaves behind is deafening.
.  “He’s away.”
Steve took far too many blows to the head for Tony’s piece of mind.  The man may be Captain America - damn, that’s weird - but he’s not invulnerable.  Probably.
“And how long has he been coming to the lab?”
Tasha answers with a short, barking laugh.  “Cap, Yvette’s a model.  We’re less dating than engaging in a mutually beneficial business arrangement.  I get arm candy, she gets exposure, no one expects us to go home with them at the end of the night.  Everybody wins.”
Natasha briskly cuffs the back of his head.  “
“Does he talk too?” Steve asks as his eyes warily take in the approaching bot.
Tony glares darkly.  “Trust me, you’ll know it when you hear it.”
corny.)  But Pepper’s right; you can’t exactly build something real on a weak foundation.  If he wants something genuine – and, scarily, he does – he needs to lay all his cards on the table.
P.S.  According to JARVIS, he left shortly after I did but came back around 8:00 this morning.  Isn’t this what we have security for?
Not wanting to give Tony too much time to think things over, Steve settles in and gazes toward the ceiling.  “JARVIS, could you pull up the next movie in the queue?”
Once again, Steve looks adorably confused.  To be honest, he seems to spend half his time with that somewhat puzzled look on his face, but at least he doesn’t look as dejected as he did the other day.  “I’m not sure I follow you.”
Something in her tone must throw Tasha off because the woman stops ranting as her expression shifts from outraged to perplexed.
“Well, you should have,” Clint shoots back.  It’s blatantly obvious when you think about it.”
Except for the times when it’s not.  Because living with the woman means that Steph is privy to a lot of things that she would be a lot better off not knowing, thank you very much.  Like how despite her tiny size, Tasha has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol.  Or that she survives on a minimal amount of sleep.  Or that apparently she’s comfortable with dating both men and women because she’s
A smirk crosses Natasha’s normally serious face. “Please, do share that wisdom with Stark.”
“Why do you automatically assume it’s my fault?”
After several weeks of doing listening to Tony’s unique film introductions, Steve knows to just smile and nod.  He’ll figure everything out eventually.  “What song am I avoiding?”
, which had the possibility to evolve into something more, when a shrieking alarm cut through the air and utterly ruined everything.  In the course of an instant, he and Tony had shifted from doing – whatever it was they were doing – into red alert mode.
He’d set the phone to vibrate to that it wouldn’t wake her up. Turns out, he didn’t really need it — he was too wired to sleep anyway — but the soft buzzing noise was a nice prompt to get him moving, as much as he doesn’t want to go.
As the triumphant notes of Korngold’s opening score resound from the lab’s speakers, he allows himself a brief moment of nostalgia before settling in for the film.  He should probably be brushing up on something more modern, but right now he just wants something comfortable.  After all, just because the film’s slightly dated doesn’t mean it doesn’t have value.
Not bothering to say goodbye, Steve hangs up and starts speeding north.  If he’s lucky it shouldn’t take him more that five minutes to make it to Central Park; he can probably make it in three if he presses.
“So my idea was to kill two birds with one stone.  I need to figure out what is it you need to know, and you desperately need culture.  Our solution?  Hollywood.”
, is she that desperate for attention?
Tony still has no idea what made him invite Steve into his lab.  There are tenured PhDs who would sell their firstborn for ten minutes down here, yet the only person he’s ever invited inside is some SHIELD agent with an agenda.  It makes absolutely no sense, but Tony can’t quite bring himself to regret it.  Maybe it was the fact that Steve actually seemed to care about what Tony was creating instead of the standard SHIELD, please-thank you-build us more tech spiel.  He’d almost thought Steve’s offer to leave and never come back was a ploy, but that strategy would have depended way too much on Tony’s good graces, so not a great plan.
“Probably for the best.” His head definitely acknowledges that this is for the best; other parts are not exactly in agreement. His head wins by a disturbingly narrow margin.
He breathes in deeply. “Weren’t you the one who was telling me I should make an effort?”
Tony passes the cabby a probably over generous wad of cash, and Steve dutifully follows him inside.  He at least owes Tony the chance to tell him off properly, no matter how painful the experience may be.
“I get it.”  That seems safe enough, right?
dating – ”
“Not as impossible as you might think,” Tony assures him, and Steve mentally starts tracking everything he’s ever known about his armored teammate.  When he finally adds up all of the pieces, he turns back to Tony, shaken by the huge secret that’s been under his nose all along.
His chest starts seizing when the ship goes vertical.  They’re just characters in a movie, he knows that, but mentally he’s screaming for them to jump.  Jump, clear the wreckage as quickly as possible, and whatever you do, don’t stop moving.  Don’t let the frigid temperature of the water slow your movements, or the ice will creep inside your veins and pull you down to where it’s cold and deep and dark...
They’re about five seconds into awkward silence number two when Steve starts to respond, his voice surprisingly gentle.  “I thought…I thought you were the most spectacular man I’d ever met.  Half playboy, half mad scientist – I couldn’t figure out if you owned the world or wanted to invent a new one.”
“What about it?”
And that’s how an AI puts a fool in his place.  Face as composed as he can make it, Tony turns to Steve and says, “I think you hurt his feelings.”
It’s no wonder that he’s nervous.  He’s got a lot riding on this meeting.
Natasha’s response is just as curt.  “We need you at East Broadway and Madison Street.”
“Yes?”
She’s not exactly sure what the event-of-the-week is this time, but Natasha comes barging in sometime after three.  Her hair’s more disheveled than it was when she left earlier, and she looks exhausted, but she still takes the time to poke her head into the library where Steph has (allegedly) been reading.
Tony’s immediate response is to snap back with something sarcastic and clever, as he usually does in these situations, but he looks at Steve’s open eyes and then follows his eye line to where their hands are tethered by the headphones, and he just can’t do it.
“Oh. Nothing. Whitmore skewered the new Hammer Rayze in the Times this morning.”
At least, it is until Tony starts working again.  The brief flare of light gives off just enough light that Steve catches brief flashes of gold crimson on the work table.
a couple of weeks ago, for Christ’s sake.  And Steve is not allowed to use Harrison against him.  That’s just untold levels of cheating.  Plus it makes it hard to stay mad at him.
“Shellhead!” Steve spins to see the familiar red and gold suit leaning against the gym wall. His insides immediately jump, as they so often do when he sees his friend, and for a moment the past couple of hours lift from his mind. Then Iron Man’s words settle in, and he immediately remembers his massive faux pas. “I am so, so sorry.”
Steve looks up and down and the statues, and Tony can tell what he’s thinking.  The giant oversized horse looks bizarre without its traditional pedestal.  “That’s…different,” he offers.
The doors open and he proceeds to follow the instructions he’s been given, holding his breath as he travels down the final stairs.  Despite all the warnings he’s received about Stark’s technical sophistication, he’s nowhere near prepared for the sight that greets him.
Steve tries his best to keep his face neutral, but he internally winces. He doesn’t exactly
Natasha cuts in.  “We should get back to SHIELD.  They’ll want to know what’s going on.”
And then the idiot came back.  The next morning when Tony traipsed down the lab, his morning cup of coffee in hand, Agent Stalker was there, waiting by the doors and determined to give Tony a heart attack.  Tony had let out what may or may not have been a squeak as scalding hot coffee splashed all over his hand and his shirt.
Tony leans in, not wanting any nosy ears to overhear his next words.  “Because, Captain, you promised me a date, and we we’re rudely interrupted before we finished our first one.  It totally doesn’t count.”
Oh, right, he’d never really moved it.  So this entire time, he’s not only been overloading Steve with his internal angst, but he’s been feeling up the guy’s leg too.  That’s just brilliant.  Christ, could he be any more needy?  Way to ruin things, Stark.
“I’ll leave you to it,” Iron Man answers.  “I’m only here on retainer.”  The brief whirl of the repulsors is all the warning they get before Iron Man jets into the sky, a streak of crimson against blue.  Though Steve wishes he had stuck around longer, he can understand the armored man’s plight; he’d nearly died to stop the world from an alien invasion, yet only a few months later he’s being forced to defend it from the exact same thing.  Steve can sympathize; the comparison doesn’t inspire leniency.
He automatically shifts into a defensive posture, afraid they’ve missed some other hostile, but he drops his guard when he catches the familiar flash of red.
Without bothering to remove his jacket or his shoes, he plops down on the sofa.  He’s got this.  Or rather, JARVIS has got this, and he can work out the details later.  He is a genius, after all.  All he has to do is plan the perfect date, execute it, and then find a way to tell Steve about their dual secret identities.  Easy, right?
“I don’t,” she says as she waves one hand dismissively. “But sometimes reruns are a comfort. I occasionally put them on in the background when I’m working on the suit.”
“Greetings Captain, Man of Iron.  It looks as if you have beaten us to our quarry.”
“I have noted several improvements in Sir’s daily functioning since the initiation of your friendship.  He eats more frequently and imbibes less caffeine than usual.  Mostly at your insistence, he engages in a much more regular sleep pattern, or at least as regular a sleep pattern as I dared myself to hope.  Even his productivity has benefited.  While he admittedly spends less time working on designs than before you arrived in the lab, the time he does spent working is more efficient and productive.  I suspect that is because he wishes to give you his full attention when you’re present.  Sir is, for all intents and purposes, happier with you in his life, and I will assist you in and so far as your presence enriches his.”
Tasha snorts. “Story of my life. That morning you found me…I’d wrapped up things in California earlier than usual and just wanted to come home. It was late when I got back, I was tired, and I crashed on the wrong floor.” She shrugs and offers up a humorless smile. “Just think, if I wasn’t a stomach sleeper, this all could have been over a lot sooner.”

His face has burst into a wide grin by the time JARVIS’ voice rings out.
“So not sexist bullshit then.”
“…and did you see the one with the eye?  Granted, the biology’s a bit off, but for a fifteenth-century print they got a heck of a lot right.”  It’s a testament to how smitten he is that he’s genuinely amused by Steve’s language.  Only Steve could use the word ‘heck’ and make it sound cute.
Stark lets out a sound that Bruce is pretty sure has no literal translation aside from
Putting them both out of his mind, he starts to reply to Tony’s momentarily forgotten text.  He most certainly does not need Tony placing his food order again.  He’s just finished typing out
“Right,” Steve answers, still somewhat uncomfortably, “I’ll just go sit.”
“Howard’s son?” Steve responds, mildly confused that Fury’s bringing Stark into their discussion. He thinks back to the stack of file folders in his bedroom and tries to recall the details pertaining to Tony Stark. The first thing that comes to mind is a pleasantly attractive face with elaborate facial hair that should look stupid but somehow doesn't. He starts reciting sparse details listed in the file.
“So,” he starts hesitantly and carefully sits back down on the couch, “thoughts?”

“How did he…”
thinking about Steve with wind-tossed hair and bagels in hand like the world’s most attractive secret agent/delivery boy.  There, see?  Gone.  Not thinking about it.  At all.
“The item Sir forwarded, Agent Rogers, is what is known as a gif, or a file in Graphic Interchange Format.  Gifs are image files that are compressed to reduce transfer time, and they often contain looped snippets of video files.  In recent years, internet users have frequently substituted gifs for text to supply a humorous, often nonverbal response.  In this particular instance, I believe Mr. Stark was drawing on the fortunate alignment of your name with the name of a character in a children’s film to solicit your food choices.”
“But it’s his job to – ”
Steve’s eyebrows draw together as his eyes turn contemplative.  “I don’t know where I fall on that one.”

“How dare you?!”  The tension in her neck and arms brings her veins into stark relief, and she raises her hands as if ready to issue another blast.
?”  Tony’s voice rises to an unholy screech on the last word, and he's still not quite sure he's heard Steve correctly.
“You could have died!”  Steve runs his hands through his hair, which is already messy from having pulled off the cowl.  “Tony, I get what you were trying to do.  I really do.  But diving into a situation without proper prep or backup is just foolish!”  He moves closer, pushing into Tony’s personal space.  “Promise me you won’t do that again.”
Steve gulps.  “I wouldn’t exactly say
“Yes.”
“What?”
"That's what you get when your father sends you away to boarding school at age eight." His brain immediately summons memories of itchy uniforms and sitting in class with boys twice his age.  "Well, you also get bullying, a lot of emotional trauma, a lasting inability to form stable relationships, and so many other unpleasant fringe benefits, but you do learn to dance."
Eager to get away from the horrors of uniforms past, Steve tries to drag the conversation back on topic. “Hard to imagine you have much time to keep current with tv shows.”
“Ana,” he asks with deliberate care, “where is the nearest bagel shop?”
“Mr. Stark.”  Ooh, Disney prince voice, too.  The gifts just keep on giving.
“You don’t have to apologize to me.  Never for that.”  Those kinds of thoughts need be nipped in the bud, before they can grow into something truly problematic.  “Besides, I’m…not a fan of the water myself.”
So…that.  Good news is, he’s not going to die.  Bad news is, that whole secret identity reveal timetable just got moved up a bit.
Iron Man is uncharacteristically quiet for a moment. Then he says, “That’s the second time you’ve called Natasha gorgeous.”
At that, Tony threads his fingers together and slumps down over his knees.  His neck tilts down toward his closed hands, and Steve’s trying his best not to read that as anything other than the dejection it looks like.
“That’s not going to work for me!” he responds, voice coming out in a shocked huff. “There’s literally nothing about my life that belongs in this century.”
to Steve’s list.  Only the first one, though.  The sequels need not be mentioned, see the Jar Jar Paradox for further reference.
He’s just gotten himself showered and dressed when a familiar voice stops him in his tracks.
“What is it?” he queries, eager to know what it is that’s brought Tony so much glee.
This was going to kill him.
JARVIS has got the doors open by the time he steps off the last step, and he immediately starts looking around.  It only takes a moment to locate the inventor; processing what he sees is a whole nother story.
“Pretty much every day for the last few months.”
“Doesn't seem like you're all that gung ho about it though.” Her voice drops any pretense of humor and she stares straight into his eyes. Steve finds it hard to meet them.
“Good reasons?” he rebuts, though not unkindly.  He waits a couple more moments before giving up.  So much for the subtle approach.  It looks like he’s just gonna have to come straight out with the truth.  Metaphors don’t seem to be their strong suit.
“Oh, we have an answer for that.” For the first time since they’ve been talking, Natasha looks genuinely amused, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “Do you know what technophobia is?”
Shellhead offers the digital equivalent of a scoff. “Or you could just forward me a link. Like a normal person.”
Steve sat on the bed next to Tony. “I’ve been home for a bit. Just been taking care of Peter.”
Peter picked up his phone and looked at the time; it was 6:17 am. Peter thought about his options on who he could call.
“I wouldn’t want anything else.”
At about half speed Tony strolled out of bed and scavenged the bedroom floor to find a suitable shirt to wear. After a few moments, he found one of his iconic band t-shirts and put it on.
“What art credit are you even taking?” Bruce questioned as he stirred his mug of tea.
“Hey Peter, I know this might not taste the best, but it’ll make you feel better.” Steve poured the contents of the bottle into a small cup and handed it to Peter.
“Friday, what’s Peter’s temperature?” Steve tried his best not to sound nervous, but the kid was burning up.
“Ya know ya don’t have to stay.” Tony sniffled.
Steve carried out the tray into the living room and set it down on the coffee table. “Peter, I know you just want to sleep but you should probably drink some water,” Steve said softly while opening a bottle and handing it to Peter.
His journal entry wasn’t anything too fantastical, it was just a recap of the day. Alongside his messy handwriting, there were some little doodles just to fill the page. But most importantly, he taped one of the copies of the dinner photo into the book. The other printed copy would be for the wall next to his desk.
“Wait, before we leave let’s take a picture.” Steve called out. Steve pulled out his phone and snapped a photo. “To the first of many dinners together.” he smiled widely.
“Better now,” Tony said stifling a cough. Even when he was sick he still found a way to be charming.
“Well, you know that I was just standing up for someone who couldn’t stand up for themselves.” Steve shot a look at Bucky.
“Thank you,” Tony whispered.
Soon the movie started and the lights dimmed. Tony didn’t last longer than fifteen minutes before falling asleep. On the other hand, Steve was very into the movie and stayed awake.
“Okay so there’s this beautiful man in my art class and I sat next to him and got his number!” Tony’s excited laughter got a chuckle out of Bruce. “I just don’t know how he was awake at such an ungodly hour.”
Tony walked over to the mirror and decided that he was too lazy to change out of the tank top he slept in and threw on a pair of shorts. He reluctantly packed his bag with the various supplies that the class required and slowly left his dorm room.
“There are a few projects throughout the semester, but you will have one ongoing project; which will be to keep an art journal.” She explained. “You can fill the pages with anything you please. This is just to be a way for you to doing something creative every day, no matter how small. The only thing I ask you is to date every entry.” Mrs. Greene continued as she began to pass out her old journals as examples.
Ten minutes went by and Tony’s now least favorite sound disturbed his slumber for the second time this morning. He reluctantly sat up, trying to be more awake.
Tony eyes shot open. “Friday what time is it?!” he asked in a slight panic.
“Dear Tony,
“I don’t understand why I even need an art credit?! I’m a goddamn mechanical engineering major!” Tony huffed as he fiddled on his phone.
“Very good sir, enjoy your morning.”
Peter and Steve laughed as Tony joined them on the couch. Tony ran a hand through Peter’s hair and ruffled it. The three of them settled in and watched the movie.
A few hours later Bruce came in to drop off the medicine for Peter. When he went to go put the bottle on the coffee table he saw a sight that would make any heart melt; Steve, Tony, and Peter all snuggled into each other while the credits of The Lion King were on in the background.
“Sounds a little too sweet for me,” Tony sighed. “How bout a black coffee with two shots of espresso,” Tony said with the first bit of confidence he had in a while. “Oh and your favorite pastry.” Tony smiled and was back to his charming usual self.
“That sounds good. Friday, please play Fantastic Mr. Fox and dim the lights to twenty percent.” Tony said, and Steve looked at him confused.
Tony’s coughing continued.
~Kate :)
“Nonsense, if I didn’t want to be here right now I wouldn’t. I like spending time with you.” Steve said softly. Tony’s face practically engulfed in flames. “Why don’t we throw on a movie?”
“There should be some medicine in the bathroom in my room,” Tony said blowing his nose in a tissue.
“Can we go get food?” Bruce asked.
While Tony walked to class he got a text from Bruce telling him that he had saved Tony a seat. He smiled at his phone and was glad that Bruce could predict the fact that he definitely not going to be early to class.
Leaving his bedroom, Tony wandered into the kitchen to make some coffee. He passed by a mirror in the hallway and say that his hair was sticking up in every which way. Tony didn’t care. “
Tony was about to answer but then burst out into a coughing fit so he just held a thumbs up.
As soon as Peter got within an arm's reach of the couch he immediately flopped down on it. Tony chuckled and started walking towards the kitchen to make a pot of coffee.
“I’ll be right back. Just relax.” Steve’s voice was soothing. Tony took Steve’s advice and closed his eyes and let himself sink into the comfy couch.
Steve nodded.
Peter woke up while being carried to the car.
“Say no more! One large
Tony opened up the Advil bottle and took out two pills and put them on the edge of the sink. He then removed the Dayquill cap and filled it to the top with the viscous yellow medicine. Tony proceeded to take the pills followed by the shot of Dayquill. His body shuddered. Tony just hoped that he would feel better by tonight.
Steve quietly went into the bathroom and turned on the water. While he was waiting for it to warm up, Steve grabbed a towel and began to strip. The hot water felt nice against his skin. He’s had a pretty crazy morning, but he’s glad Peter is in the tower where he and Tony can look after him.
“Mister Parker’s fever has gone down to 101.1. It would appear that Mister Parker has the flu.” Jarvis said and both Tony and Steve breathed a sigh of relief.
“What’s your favorite thing on the menu?” Tony’s voice wavered but he was glad he came up with a response.
Soon the elevator doors dinged open. Steve was once again astounded and at the same time very insecure. The living area of the penthouse was lined with pristine white walls, a giant plush couch, and a massive flat screen TV. There was also a connecting kitchen with a sizeable fridge and every state of the art device to make anything and everything.
“Was your art class as bad as you expected it to be?” Bruce looked eager for Tony’s response.
When Tony woke up the following morning, the sun was shining and Steve was gone. Tony felt much better this morning, which was a relief. He slowly sat up. Tony eyes darted to the piece of paper that he was pretty sure wasn’t there before, he picked up the paper and saw that it was a note from Steve. He had beautiful handwriting.
“You got me.” Tony took a sip of the coffee, it was incredible. He then tried to look sexy whilst taking a bite out of the cinnamon bun. It didn’t really work. But Steve was giggling so that’s a good sign. Tony wiped his face before asking: “Why are cinnamon buns your favorite?”
to be infinitely more distracting.  He humanizes the space in a way that makes the ultramodern decor seem homey and inviting.  Without him, the space transforms back into a mass of steel and chrome and glass that's austerely beautiful but not very comforting.
“Yeah,” his friend responds. The suit emits a noise that Steve has long-assumed means his friend is taking a deep breath, and Iron Man continues on. “I’m just trying to say that this…secret…has been part of my life for a while now, and the way that I…the whole…Tasha and I have been, well, what we are the entire time you and I have known each other, so really this doesn’t change anything. Our friendship doesn’t have to change.”
Blue Eyes frowns.  “It’s 11:00 am.”
Steve knows he’s got him with that one; as much as Tony might like to downplay the extent of his of commitment, Steve knows that he’s not one to back out of a project without good cause.
“It’s not working!”
Silence number three is even more awkward.  Tony can hear the Harley purring over the line, but Steve stays conspicuously silent until he finally answers in a clipped, formal tone.  “Thank you.  That’s what I needed to know.”
Oh, as you were told.  Yup, Steve sucks at this whole double agent thing.  The man’s actions are ridiculously transparent now that Tony has the one fact that clarifies everything else.
“...getting closer for a while now, and I like where it’s going.  We’re just sort of horrible at getting things out in the open.”
“What even is this thing?”
“But you didn’t?” he asks, probing as gently as he can for answers to questions he didn’t even know he should be asking.
He didn’t know a river could have veins.  Sure, he’s just recently discovered that the water is absolutely beautiful, but he had no idea that the water itself could have a heartbeat and a living pulse.  That all changes the moment the creature hits the water.  One last electric pulse illuminates the entire bay, flooding the river with all of the light and energy that’s been drained from the city.  It’s beautiful, in a macabre sort of way, if only for the conclusion it represents.
“I do. I’m just —” She struggles to find a word, so he fills it in for her.
that comes out of his mouth. Okay, so that explains a lot.
As soon as he left the shop, Tony decided to taste his tea. The tea, like any drink or food that Steve makes, was divine. Flavors of honey and lemon swirled around him. “God was there anything Steve couldn’t do?” was Tony’s only thought as he walked back to his penthouse.
Comments and Kudos are really appreciated!
Tony gestured for him to sit. Steve handed Tony his coffee and the box. Tony opened it and found the most perfect looking cinnamon bun inside. Unconsciously, a smile crept onto Tony’s face.
Tony actually liked this idea quite a bit. It made him think back to how his mother was always writing. He thought about how much time she would put into everything she would write. Tony loved her handwriting. He loved how delicate and swoopy it was. Tony thought about the box that’s in storage where all of the things she wrote were kept nice and safe.
Tony went back home feeling quite good about himself. He checked his phone to see that it was only 11:21. He still had plenty of time to be productive.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Much better actually. I probably shouldn’t stay long. So just fix me up whatever tea drink will make me feel better.”
“Does Lou’s Diner sound good?”
I hope you have a great day!
“Again, thank you so much for everything. You really didn’t have to.” Tony said.
Have a great day :)
Naturally, Steve woke up around 5:40 am. His eyes slowly opened to embrace the subtle light coming in through a crack in the curtains. It seemed like a nice morning for a light run. It was the weekend, after all, he could go easy on himself. Looking over to the right he saw Tony peacefully sleeping. Steve gave him a light kiss on the forehead. As quietly as he could, he got ready for his run.
“I can’t seem to find any. But I can call Bruce to see if he can make some,” Steve replied.
Tony turned to see that Steve and a dark-haired boy were walking towards him. “Hey, Steve! What’s up?” he smiled.
Tony took a sigh of relief. He reached over to grab his phone, and somehow he felt worse. Pain shot through Tony’s body. Looking at his phone, Tony did have a message from Steve.
Tony just rolled his eyes at his friend as they walked into the lab building. Once the two of them got into their classroom, they sat a lab table. After a few minutes, the lab began. Since it was the first day, the lab was quite easy. Tony and Bruce finished the lab quite quickly so they were dismissed early.
“Peter is everything alright?” Steve’s voice was now full of concern.
” he chuckled to himself and then walked in. He immediately felt at home. A few people were sitting in plush sofas chatting over their morning coffee. The smell of freshly ground coffee and various pastries wafted through the air. Tony was pretty sure he died and went to heaven. Instead of standing around and staring into space, he got in line.
“No thanks, I have a particular spot in mind.”
“Don’t want it,” Peter’s voice sounded small and sad. Steve was pretty sure that he could’ve started crying on the spot.
Wahoo! You made it to the end of the chapter! I really hoped you enjoyed it!
“I take it that it’s your first time here,” Steve let out a small laugh.
“I'll show you the clipping.”
“…needlessly complicated.”
that does it. To his memory, it’s the first time he’s ever heard the tower’s AI ask for something. “How much longer until they get here?” he demands.
“And is anything I do going to change that?
“It’s not my fault I can’t sleep on planes!”
Apparently, Tony’s invitation email left out a few things.
Absolutely.  Tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that. "I'd love to."  He grabs Steve’s hand and drags them inside; they can have their date tomorrow, but he’s not quite done with Steve tonight.
“You’re fine,” Tony cuts in quickly as he steps into the room, stripping off his jacket as he makes his way inside.  “I can’t count how many times I’ve fallen asleep on that sofa.”

It’s rare that Tony ever finds himself at a loss for words, but Agent Stalker has managed to get him there.  “What…How…Why would you…”  He paused, drew in a deep breath, and tried not to focus on the strong coffee smells now wafting from his shirt.  “No, Rogers, this is not a good time to talk.”
name, but she really doesn’t know how Tasha could be so dismissive about the statuesque blonde who accompanied her to…whatever event it was they went to.  Because Tasha is
“You really don’t have to do that.”
Tony quickly shifts his attention to the HUD, wordlessly instructing it to scan for any and all signs of the Avengers.  It takes only a second to find them.  Thor’s bulk is easy to spot and Clint’s visible just by virtue of standing next to him.  Natasha is easier to spot, mainly because she’s in black and she’s kneeling on the black asphalt.  That just leaves Steve.
“What was that thing?”
“Really?”  Clint’s voice hits the perfect balance between interested and aloof; if Steve wants to keep going, he’s more than open to listening, but he’s not prying.  Steve can appreciate that, and it makes him keep talking.”
Considering the fact that he’s spent the past seventy years frozen in an iceberg, five days should not feel like an exceedingly long amount of time.  Expectation and reality, he’s coming to find, are two drastically different things.
For now, though, he’ll take what he can get.  Training with Clint and Natasha and the mornings and spending his afternoons with Tony have given him a sense of normalcy that was severely lacking from his life.  He’s not quite at ease in this century; he’s not sure he’ll ever be, but his days are vastly more meaningful now that he has a purpose.  He knows that as soon as he finishes up here, he’ll shower and bike over to Stark Tower, where he’ll watch some bizarre film, listen to music that’s far too loud, and watch Tony try to change the world.  Speaking of which…
And when he thinks back on it, the night hasn’t been that bad.  In fact, his most pressing memories are of walking in with Steve at his side, of feeling Steve’s waist under his hand and his breath on his face as they danced.
“My phone?” Steve answers, looking down at the object in his hand.
“Damn,” Clint answers, his eyes contemplative.  “That’s got to put you in a tight spot, with the whole super-soldier plus Avenger plus the frozen, time-travelish thing.”
Steve was stunned by the lobby alone. Everything seemed to be made out of marble and accented with gold. The elevators were at the end of the lobby and Tony and Steve hobbled over to them.
“Personally, my favorite is the
Tony walked into class ten minutes late. As soon as he walked in everything stopped, all attention was on him. The entire class was looking at Tony, which included a beautiful blond who caught his eye.
Steve went down the hall until he found the master bedroom. Tony’s bedroom. Steve felt himself blush. He looked over and saw the California King sized bed. Steve’s face grew even hotter, he started imagining Tony and him in the bed together. Cuddling, sleeping, and doing other things too.
When Tony finally got back to his dorm room it seemed that Bruce had already left for class, leaving him alone for a few hours. Tony was getting a little hungry so he decided to make a cup of ramen and watch a movie until his next class.
“This should make you feel better.” Steve’s voice was kind and caring.
“Stay,” Peter said so softly that Tony was sure if he had been any further from the couch he wouldn’t have heard it.
“That doesn’t sound too good,” Peter piped in, almost like he didn’t know that they were talking about him.
Steve hit the button and the elevator started to move, which made Tony nauseous. He leaned on Steve and mumbled “Dizzy.” Steve nodded and held Tony. Tony enjoyed that.
“He definitely has a fever and waking up and going back to sleep.” Steve placed a hand on Tony’s back to try and calm him down.
” he thought to himself.
Bruce had been friends with Tony for long enough to know when he wasn’t telling the entire truth. “Come on Tones, spill it.” Bruce poked at Tony’s side.
“Sounds great! Can I get your name for the order?” He smiled.
Tony turned around and it was Peter who was holding an empty trash can. Tony moved out of the way and his heart shattered. He quickly rushed to the counter and put the first bill in his wallet into the tip jar. Which unsurprisingly, had a pun written on it, it read: “
By luck would have it, Tony’s dark eyes met the stranger’s brilliant blue ones. They both quickly looked away and he hoped that he wasn’t blushing. After that Tony kept the staring to a minimum and did his best to focus on what the professor was saying.
Tony turned on the TV so he could at least try to focus on something. He settled on some cheesy 80’s movie and zoned out.
Peter hesitated for a moment before drinking the viscous liquid. His face puckered for a second when he swallowed. “Are you gonna watch with us, I know it’s like really old.”
“My research shows that there are no side effects of taking the two together.” Friday’s voice cheerily responded.
The brunet checked his phone as he left and realized that he was probably going to be late, but he really did not care. Instead he clutched his thermos like his life depended on it and walked at his own pace.
Steve searched through the fridge until he found it and poured it into the glass. He carefully brought it out to Tony. He put the glass on a coaster and sat on the couch next to Tony. He also moved the table closer to Tony.
“All right.  Be safe, and let me know when you get home.”
“It's a lot to take in.”
Something inside of Steve twists at Thor’s words.  While it’s somewhat comforting to know that they won’t be facing off against their latest adversary and her animated statuary anytime soon, Thor’s justification of her presence is deeply disturbing.  The galaxy knows about earth and, apparently, thinks it’s a suitable planet to visit.  More than that, the woman they’ve just fought, who or whatever she is, can be evaluated in terms of decades.  Despite the Avengers’ recent victory, he can’t help but feel that they are only specs of sand bracing themselves against the fury of a tide they can’t hope to halt.
“That’s the thing about Stark,” she says, sitting down and passing him a bottle.  “He’ll talk right over you if you give him half a chance, and he’s lightning fast with his comebacks, especially when he’s defensive.  It’s only later that you realize what you
Steve crosses his arms and glares.  “That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
“Also a risk, but that’s what the blast wall’s for.”  Stark gestures toward a large metal wall with a tiny inset window.  The smoke seems to be coming from somewhere behind it.  “The wall keeps the explosions from getting out of hand...most of them anyway.”
“JARVIS, could you help me out on this one?”
“Everything okay?”
“Yeah, I’m not buying it. You utterly freak out when you found out about Natasha, then you insist on the three of us getting together. The two of you manage to have a perfectly decent time without me and now you’re back to being a downer. What gives?”
“Does it matter if I say no?”

An hour later, Steve has completely changed his tune.  The internet is a beautiful, wonderful invention that is quickly becoming one of his favorite things about the twenty-first century.
“Right, sooo,” Steve broaches, we’ll just wait for Shellhead to get here and we can get started.”
Tony pauses, and his mouth draws into a hard line.  “He’s...fine, Steve.  Everything is just great.”  The tone of his voice suggests otherwise, though.

Not the verbal fighting, that is.  Those spats leave her angry and wondering if the fragment of the serum that lets Bruce hulk out made has somehow been lying dormant in her bloodstream all this time.  (To be fair, those have tapered off lately.)  Combat, though, combat is where they shine.  Whenever someone points them at an enemy and says

“Okay, let’s think about this logically.  What counteracts electricity?”
“Back, Dum-E,” Stark insists, and the robot turns around.  If Steve didn’t know any better, he’d say it looked...droopy.  He keeps his eye on the robot as it slowly proceeds back across the room.
“JARVIS,” he starts, his voice worn but with threads of relief, “we got enough power to fly back?”
“On business.”
He sighs and pinches the holo into nonexistence.  Back to square one.
Not that there’s actually a difference, but Steve doesn’t know that.
“It’s a silly superstition.”
He says none of this out loud.  No, damn it, Steve’s hurt him, and he’d thought he’d blocked himself off from ever letting himself be that vulnerable a long time ago.
“Really,” Steve answers with nod.  “Some things are just too important to keep in, even if saying them out loud is a risk.”
“What Clint means to say,” Natasha cuts in, “is that he has a terrible sense of humor, and he’s very sorry for implying anything inappropriate.”
“Then this is me saying yes.”

“Why would I need immunity from Tony?”
and then makes a beeline for the door before Stark can toss another inappropriate comment his way.  Stark takes that as his cue to cross to Bruce.
“Could you?” Tony shoots back.  “If it comes down to a choice between you and the next guy, are you going to be the one to hold back?”  Steve remains silent, and Tony can’t help but scoff.  “God, you’re hypocritical!  Everyone has rules to follow, except for you.  Rules don’t matter when the Captain’s involved.”
“And that entails…”  Clint’s voice trails off, leaving Steve to fill in the gap.
As he steps into one of the Stark Tower elevators, Bruce Banner is seriously questioning his sanity and his life choices.
“How long have you been awake?”
“Long story. Not one I’m really up for telling right now.”
“People shouldn’t be valorized simply for doing the right thing,” he stares off into the distance for a moment before comes back to the present.  “Besides, what if it all happens again?  Someone comes back, brings these things to life again, I’d hate to see the damage a ten-foot-tall indestructible Natasha could inflict.”

giving outdated tech to my outdated tech.  Who is he even going to call?  Not that he can call anyone, the phone’s disabled, but the principle stands.  That is incredibly stupid and unnecessary and just plain wrong!”
“Oh.  Right.  I knew that.”  And that’s his spaced-out voice.
Of course, he’s not going to admit any that to Fury. Instead, he tries to explain himself as best he can without sounding like he’s unhinged.
“Exactly!  We’ll tell him eventually, but not until I get in a few good comebacks.  Besides, just think of the mental anguish Tony will go through trying to figure out how I’m coming up with such good material.  It’s like a Tony-centric version of the Turing test.”
“How?” he asks.
After an almost indiscernible pause, JARVIS answers.  “Mr. Stark is the only person currently in the lab.”
“I think we beat them here,” he says when he can’t find any familiar faces.
“Did I ask for space? And since when the hell did giving me space require leaving the borough?”
“Calm down, I was just teasing.”  Good Lord, the man was actually blushing.  It was definitely
But it works.  The public loves her, loves Iron Woman and, by extension, the Avengers.  Hawkeye is lauded for his efforts in assisting the city, the world collectively agrees to overlook Hulk’s history in Harlem, and no one seems inclined to question the legitimacy of a Russian national working for an American government agency.  The city slowly starts to piece itself back together.  There are magazine covers and interviews and an endless round of public appearances, and before long the politicians are the ones contacting
Apparently, the NYPD knows what they’re doing when they place their caution tape, because that horse is nowhere near steady enough to remain freestanding.  His brief contact, which hadn’t been all that powerful, is enough to set the statuary swaying on its hind legs and the giant rearing figure teeters on its hind legs.  The momentum carries the horse briefly backwards, but the recoil swing is enough to shift the weight to the overly-heavy front section, and the giant figure starts to topple, too unsteady to remain upright any longer.
A combination of adrenaline and instinct forces him into action.  He positions himself between Stark and the oncoming threat as his arms come up to defend his face.
Tony’s responding laugh is somewhere between hysteria and joy.  Little does Steve know, he could have had him anytime, anyplace for the past decade.  They’re both idiots.  Rather than dignify his ludicrous statement with a response, he moves in to start kissing Steve but finds himself leaning forward more than should be possible.
“I did.”
Sometimes the future is very strange.  “I doubt it’ll top Errol Flynn,” he says somewhat testily to himself.”
He takes a deep breath.  “I...wasn’t allowed to use technology when I was growing up.”
“Of course I knew!  It’s blatantly obvious if you think about it.”
That very well may be the first time the word ‘domestic’ has ever been applied to him; for lack of a good response, he glares and remains silent.
dwarfed by her hospital gown and the large IV stand next to the bed. Her eyes are closed when he enters a room and for a moment he thinks she’s sleeping. Then she mutters a single word under her breath.
The moment he hears the world “SHIELD,” Tony’s mind immediately shuts down, and he’s automatically committed to getting out of this meeting as soon as is physically possible.  This.  Again.  Hasn't Fury learned his lesson by now?
If he’s being honest with himself, being in love with Tony Stark doesn’t change all that much.  Sure, finally connecting all of the dots and acknowledging his feelings for what they are came as a bit of a shock, but it doesn’t alter his daily routine in the long run.  He still shows up every afternoon with food, and Tony still teases him about his lack of familiarity with pop-culture.  They go about their business as they usually do, but Steve’s eyes are opened to the consequences of their effortless synergy.
“Good to know.” And it is.
Now for the double speak.  “She worked in legal for a while, and she was pretty good at it, too.  It wasn’t until later, after shit started going down, that I realized that she was a SHIELD operative.”  He lets that sink in for a moment.  “At first, I was pissed.  Like
He thinks about how exactly he needs to phrase this.  Yesterday, when he’d told JARVIS he needed something that basically said ‘We’re okay here,’’ JARVIS had sent three options to his phone.  When Steve had seen the clip from that space movie that Tony had insisted he watch, he knew he’d chosen the right one.
After the two exchanged numbers, they walked out of the classroom together. This was when Tony was able to get a better look of Steve. He saw how well Steve filled out the white t-shirt he was wearing and how fantastic he looked in a pair of jeans.
I hope you liked the chapter! Just a little warning the next chapter might take a little time because I've got a pretty crazy work week coming up!
Tony’s alarm violently woke him up. His eyes slowly opened to stop the horrendous beeping. It took him a minute to adjust to his new surroundings, Tony and his friend Bruce just moved into their dorm yesterday. Tony rolled over to see his roommate typing away on his laptop, the subtle glow was the only light in the room.
“Hey! How’s it going?” Steve smiled.
I hope you’re feeling better this morning! Last night was fun, that movie was great! I can see why it’s one of your favorites. There’s leftover soup in the fridge, and I cleaned up the kitchen to the best of my ability. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be there when you woke up, but the coffee isn’t gonna brew itself! Ha! Anyways, if you’re feeling up to it, you should swing by the shop. It’d be nice to see you!
Unluckily for him, May was out of town for the weekend on a trip. Leaving him all alone.
“Hey Friday, can you take uh-” Tony sneezed interrupting his train of thought. “Take uh-um Advil and Dayquil together.” Tony’s voice was hoarse, he was taken aback by just hearing it.
“Of course.” Steve sat with him and instructed the car to drive back to the tower.
Just as he was about to walk out the door, he heard a small voice “Excuse me, sir.”
Tony was about the furthest thing from a morning person anyone could imagine. So when the only mandatory art class left was at 10 in the morning he was less than pleased. Tony was also annoyed when it was a studio art class. He was awful at pretty much all things art. The minute he signed up for it he knew he would regret it.
After what seemed like an eternity Tony made it to the diner. When he got inside, he saw Steve already sitting in a booth. Tony was only able to see Steve’s top half which was covered in a dark grey shirt with sleeves that ended just after his elbow. He looked like he was writing something, but Tony was too far away to be sure. He began to walk over to the booth and Tony suddenly became really hot. He quickly unzipped his jacket and sat across from Steve.
“Coffee.” Tony set an alarm on his phone to wake him up in another ten minutes.
“Yeah let’s just drop our stuff off first.” Tony laughed.
“Steve can ya grab some towels and fresh clothes for Peter,” Tony asked kindly. He decided that having one adult help you shower would be less of a blow to Peter’s self-esteem.
“He-Hello?” The voice said in a heavy breath, almost as if he was working out.
Tony hadn’t realized he even fell asleep in the first place until his eyes opened. He looked over and saw Steve walking towards him, holding two bowls.
“Don’t wanna stand,” Peter mumbled.
Peter tossed and turned in bed. He kicked the covers off himself, Peter was getting hotter by the minute. The boy just wanted to get some sleep, but that was proving to be very difficult. Peter groaned and decided to get up and open a window.
“Mister Rogers,” Peter said in a whimper.
Steve’s face grew warm. “Well slow down, you don’t want to waterboard yourself.” Steve and Tony both laughed.
“Morning babe,” Tony’s voice was low and raspy. “Just getting back from your run?” he continued.
“We can, um help you if ya want,” Tony was a little unsure in that statement. He didn’t know if that would be too embarrassing or uncomfortable for Peter.
Tony was actually surprised at how much work he had gotten done today. Occasionally while he was working his thoughts would slip what Steve and Peter were doing but nothing more. Tony was also glad that he suppressed the urge to stop in at the coffee shop when he went out for lunch.
“Oh my God, Tony! You walked here?! Like this?!” Steve was shocked. Tony flinched at the volume of Steve’s voice. “We can take my car,” Steve said much quieter. “Do you think that you can lead me back to your place.”
“Hey! I’m excited for our date tonight!”
“Is everything alright with um … that kid … it just seems like … “ Tony’s voice trailed off and got quieter. He didn’t really know how to finish that sentence. Hopefully, Steve wouldn’t take offense. Normally, Tony wouldn’t even ask something like this, but there was just something about that kid that he connected to.
It was almost 7 pm which meant that Tony should be making himself some dinner at this point. Pasta seemed like an easy and filling choice. Just as Tony finished making the pasta his phone buzzed.
Tony placed his phone down with a big smile on his face. He was beyond excited for Wednesday. This date was surely going to be better than the last.
Tony smiled as he left the penthouse.
Tony read Steve’s messages and grew excited. Part of him couldn’t believe that Steve would want a second date with him. But, he shoved those insecurities deep down and responded to the messages.
“Steve, and the pleasures all mine. Your total is $5.98” Steve smirked
“Cranberry juice in the fridge,” Tony said weakly.
“That is not an old movie,” Tony said fakely annoyed.
Steve also made sure Bucky made a group chat for all of them so he could send them the photo. Steve could’ve done it himself, but he was someone who self-proclaimed that they were “bad at technology”.
Tony was annoyed. Of all the days that he would have woken up early on, it had to a Saturday. Tony tried to go back to sleep. He didn’t even know why he’d bother it was useless.
“Well, I should uh get back to work. I really do hope you come back.” Steve smiled as he walked away from the table and back behind the counter.
Also, a friend and I are seeing Far From Home tonight! I'm so excited!
Tony’s gaze was taken away from the boy when Steve came to his table, two coffees and a small brown box in hand. “Care if I join you?” Steve politely asked.
