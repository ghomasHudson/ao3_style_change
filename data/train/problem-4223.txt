“Well, f-f-f-or one, I can sh-sh-share with y-you l-l-like this. You know h-how o-o-often I c-c-could t-t-talk to someone with-thout f-f-fearin’ that I’m b-b-burdening ‘em? L-l-like they a-a-ain’t l-l-listenin’? Barely
Dean shrugs.
“Of what?” Castiel asks, trying to coax him gently into answering.
Cas takes their twined hands off Dean’s hip and rests them over Dean’s heart.
Cas's expression instantly softens, and he reaches over and puts a hand on Dean's back, and oh,
Cas's lips are a bit chapped, but his mouth is soft and warm. Dean sighs against his cheek, his eyes closing the rest of the way. Cas might not be the most experienced kisser, but he appears determined to learn as fast as possible. Dean is happy to let him ‘practice’, and even more happy with the fact that Cas has started to take control of their kisses more and more as he gains in confidence.
“I think I’ve had my fair share of prolonged contact with water over the last couple days,” Cas replies. He puts a stack of towels beside the tub and then sits on the ledge, looking down at Dean.
“Okay, al-l-lright.” Dean folds his arms around Jack, a little awkwardly. They’ve hugged like once before, and that was shortly after Dean got back and was still completely beside himself. Jack doesn’t seem to mind. He just holds on, crying into Dean’s tee. When he finally draws back, his face is all blotchy and wet. Dean casts around for something to clean up with, when suddenly the Mom of the two kids from earlier comes over to them, holding out a couple of tissues with a soft smile.
“Dean, let me.”
To keep Cas from saying anything else that’s only going to make Dean flustered, he picks up another cookie and waves it in Cas’s face in a deliberately annoying manner. “Have another one. C’mon, you know you wanna.”
Dean sighs and looks down at where his fingers are nervously fiddling with his ring.
He sniffs, his mouth trembling around the words.
“Obviously there’s still some leftover grace inside of you,” Cas continued. “Theoretically, as you’re a vessel, it shouldn’t harm you. But it’s possible that whatever Michael did to ‘keep the door open’, has done something to you. Or it has something to do with you trapping him inside your mind and him violently breaking out. There’s—”
Dean watches a koala munch on leaves while her baby is clinging to her back, all cozy and safe nestled in their mom’s fur.
He closes his eyes and goes pliant against Castiel, basically melting into the bathwater.
If this were the fucked up universe where Dean's life is a TV show, his stomach would growl right about now, just to prove Sam's point. It’s not, but maybe the only reason his stomach doesn't growl anyway is because Dean feels like he just got punched in it.
“Cas...” Dean stops him with a hand on his arm, and then ducks down so quickly Castiel doesn’t fully realize what’s happening before Dean’s kissing him. It’s more of a peck, over so quickly that Castiel has no chance to reciprocate. Dean also mostly misses his mouth, and he ducks away immediately after, walking out with his shoulders up at his very red ears.
She and Castiel sit down with Maggie and Jack to help them finish the stars, of which they seem to have baked enough that Castiel is not sure where they will store them all so they’ll keep.
With an eye roll at himself, Dean shrugs back out of the brown flannel and into a red checkered one. He feels fucking stupid doing it, but tells himself it's okay because not wanting to look like a mess is perfectly normal.
when they're away from the bunker for too long. Who used to sleep with anyone who would have him because take what you can get or get nothing was the motto he'd learned to live by.
Dean reaches up to check, only he’s still got his oven mitts on and only succeeds in almost poking himself in the eye with them. Sam snort-laughs and Dean chucks one of the mitts at him. Ducking out of the way, Sam is almost out of the kitchen when Dean remembers— “What the fuck are you even doing here, don’t you have a date?”
“How?”
Cas and Eileen volunteer to divide the local shelters between them, and everyone piles out shortly after to catch some shut-eye. As soon as their door has closed with a click, Dean is about to sag against Cas and suggest an early night when Cas says, “I think I will go out for a while.”
“Sorry guys,” Eileen says, looking apologetic at interrupting them. “Cas, we need an emergency translation.”
don’t like.”
“What do you think I should do?” Castiel asks at length, slumping further in his seat.
“I d-dunno... guess he n-needs m-more—more t-time, or w-w-w-whatever.” He gestures vaguely and Cas frowns.
Scowling, Dean brushes some rice off of his face.
Pulling it over his head messes his hair up worse than it already was. He runs his fingers through it a couple times and then decides that whatever it looks like now will have to be good enough.
“No,” Dean grouses, voice all raspy. “‘M sl-l-leepin’.”
Inside the shell are some small white flower blossoms and a big pink one. It looks lovely and has a subtle, pleasant scent.
“Dean!”
The others have hung back, giving them a moment to themselves. Now, Sam’s there, wrapping an arm around Jack’s shoulders. “Of course, Jack. It’s your birthday.”
Dean, who has been very busy stuffing himself with blueberry pancakes, looks up from his plate and for once actually swallows before answering.
Cas looks down at Dean and then at the picture again. "I thought we could make one just for us. A private one. And I don't mean just for pictures involving nudity. For instance, I don't need our entire family to see the photos you took when you made me try on that brown hoodie with the bear ears."
comes on and Dean feels his cheeks heat.
“You can’t do it like you used to, that’s true. But you can do it with help. It’s just different.”
“I don’t want you sitting here alone while we’re having fun.”
"Jack made it for you. He saw you flee the kitchen without breakfast and he got worried."
“I’ll see you later, then.”
“The space scenes are so cool. There’s this one with a supernova that becomes a black hole, and…”
Eileen and Sam leave to get some rest but Mary stays, claiming that she got enough shut-eye in the car and that if she sleeps anymore now she won't be able to at all tonight.
Dean remains silent, but Castiel knows him well enough to understand that his stillness is merely a false front holding back a flood of emotion.
Amused, Castiel huffs out a breath, “At this point it will never be over.”
“Five more minutes, and then I’ll come get you,” Cas tells Dean once he’s washed away all the suds. “Try not to fall asleep again yet.”
Dean had never voiced this wish aloud. According to Sam, Dean could play but never seemed to have allowed himself the time to explore this hobby. It wasn’t surprising, but still made Castiel sad to hear, especially when he considered Dean’s love for music, his tactile nature, and the way doing things with his hands always seemed to calm him down.
“Better?”
There’s a snort, and then Sam saying, “Yeah, he’s gone.” A click, Sam and Cas wishing each other goodnight, and then Dean is put down on a nice, soft surface. Cas is tugging his boots off his feet, but all Dean’s body cares about is that he’s horizontal, and he’s out again almost instantly.
“Do you want one?”
Finally, that gets a reaction.
At least now it makes sense why he built up a barrier around his work station.
He checks Sam’s first, but Sam is just asking him to stop driving and call him back. Heart in his throat, Dean clicks on Cas’s.
"Can't I worry by myself for once," Castiel complains grouchily, though he is actually kind of touched. "Must you all also start to worry?"
Bent over the open hood, his hands greasy and busy, Dean bites back his irritation and just keeps going. He’s pretty sure he knows what’s wrong—with the truck at least. After another minute of Cal hovering from a safe distance away like he thinks Dean’s either going to collapse or explode, Dean puts everything back into place and then motions for him to turn the key.
He doesn't feel like watching anything, but the TV is there and it's already on, so he finally gives in and switches to the program he thinks will irritate him the least.
It is; Cas's dick is gliding over his perineum, putting pressure on his prostate from the outside, the head catching on Dean’s hole every couple of strokes. Dean’s dick is getting rubbed against Cas's stomach and Cas's hips have started making little thrusting motions, his feet braced against the mattress. It’s a little uncoordinated and sloppy but that doesn’t even matter. Dean’s warm all over and he’s
“Nah, I'll b-b-b-e f-f-f-fine. Just get me my s-s-sunglasses.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean would wonder where he went wrong raising him, except he knows exactly what went wrong in terms of food when they were kids.
you c-c-could d-d-do.”
Away from Cas.
Dean thinks he’s watching the movie, but he must get lost in his head instead, or maybe in focusing too much on trying to enjoy Cas’s nearness. There’s a tentative touch to his arm, really just a grazing of fingertips, but he flinches anyway.
"Cas, you okay?" It seems to have been a rhetorical question, because Sam adds, "Look, you've been going nonstop. Why don't you take a break for a bit. Call Dean. He's worried."
Dean closes his eyes. He’s dead tired but he can already tell he won’t fall asleep easy. His body is aching inside and out and Cas is so close. If Dean asked to be held—to be comforted, to be soothed—then Cas would do it, no questions asked. But Dean is Dean, and Dean is a coward. And weak. He can barely hold back the
He wishes they had a stereo system in the kitchen, and a little bit of luck, because then some slow-dancing song would start playing just now, and they could sway a little, and maybe kiss a little, and—
What happens next happens so fast Dean has no chance to dodge—Jack gets up from the table and then he’s hugging Dean.
“Yeah, well, mayb-b-be you should be.”
You okay?” Dean signs, one of the only things he knows how to sign.
Dean opens his mouth. Closes it again.
The prick of the needle hurt, and Dean expected the pain to stay in that area, but instead it exploded all over his body. It felt like someone was trying to rip every single bone out of him at once. He could no longer remember where he was or what was happening, just that he needed it to stop.
Because Dean has transformed into a thirteen-year-old girl overnight, he lifts his hand and gives Cas an embarrassing little wave. Geez, what is he going to do next, pretend to have accidentally dropped a tissue? He beelines it to the coffee machine.
He only barely wakes when, an indefinite amount of time later, he’s lifted out of the car by Cas. Resting his head on Cas's chest, Dean lets himself be carried inside, uncaring of anything except not having to open his eyes or move an inch, floating in a state of semi-sleep. Despite the exhausting day they’ve had, Cas is carrying him like it’s no effort at all. “You’re s-so strong-g-g,” Dean sighs adoringly.
Dean nods. “So-so-sounds good.” He puts his pie on his bedside table, shoulders already slumping with exhaustion again. “Cud-d-dle until it’s dinner t-t-time?”
Dean has other ideas. After rummaging through their nightstand for the massage oil, he motions for him to take off his shirt and lie down on his stomach.
Cas is watching him, looking like he’s trying really hard to understand. “How do you feel, Dean?” He asks, gently.
“Does it have something to do with Cas? With Chuck? With Mi—”
did. Your hands are clean. You need to calm down now.”
An hour in, and Dean was just clicking on random stuff on his laptop, impatiently jiggling his leg under the table. Sam and Cas had been holed up in the library all day, after Sam had asked Cas's help with—something. It was boring and Dean had tuned it out. But it had been hours at this point! They hadn't seen Cas in weeks, and now Cas was immersed in research and wasn't paying any attention at all to Dean. That was super not okay, especially with how worried Dean had been about him. He’d barely slept! Because Cas wouldn’t answer his stupid phone!
With his cheeks stuffed full, Dean can only glare at Cas, and then at Jack and Eileen when they snicker at their antics.
Startled out of his thoughts, Dean realizes that the kid has someone materialized right next to him. Not like, teleported—he’s not allowed to use his powers yet, after all. But like, snuck up on. Who taught their kid to be this sneaky? Not Dean, that’s for sure.
Castiel takes that to mean it's a mix of both. He shifts his hand out from under Dean's so he can hold it in turn, giving it a reassuring squeeze.
The hide-behind has one of their knives stuck in its left leg. The injury barely seems to slow it down, but it finally is no match for Cas's fury. Angel blade buried to the hilt in its chest, it goes down in a heap and with an ugly sound like nails on cardboard, making everyone except Cas and Eileen wince and belatedly cover their ears.
“Dean’s right,” Jack says, to Castiel’s utter relief. “Besides, if you guys get yourself captured, you’ll need someone here to save you.”
"See? Now, c'mon," Dean gently nudges Jack's leg under the table with his foot. "Eat your lunch."
Jack look at him in confusion.
They're occupied with the game until it's time for lunch. After, Dean throws his Baby’s keys to Jack, who is so surprised he barely catches them.
Dean tries to glare up at Cas, but the dumbass has already gone back to watching the stupid animals with a soft expression of joy.
“Speak-k-king of f-f-feeling l-l-listened to—you t-t-talk to Molly?”
“‘M’so sorry, girl,” he soothes, smoothing a hand over her roof. He’d been way too rough with her in his frustration when she shut down on them. “Imma make it up to you, okay?”
“Are you worried about Sam?”
His previously relaxed expression morphing into a glare, Sam strides over to them. "What the fuck are those snowmen, Dean? Why do you always have to embarrass me?"
like i said in the beginning, i almost didn't post this fic at all because it fought me so hard. so if you enjoyed it, it would mean a lot to me if you could leave me a comment and
“Feels l-l-like...l-l-like you don’t want me as b-bad as I w-w-want y-y-you.” There’s a headache pounding in his temples like his body wants him to cry but he isn’t letting it. Blinking his eyes rapidly, he tries to smile, but it comes out wobbly. “It’s stupid-d-d, I know.”
He hadn’t expected it to be this nice. The water is cool and clear and smells of salt instead of chlorine. He can see the sky overhead and is able to actually touch the seafoam and hear the soft sounds of the water from up close.
Dean glowers at him over Baby’s roof.
“Have you noticed Dean acting strange lately?”
When Cas declares him injury free, Dean lifts his arms. Immediately, Cas and Eileen spring into action, lifting him up and each putting one of Dean’s arms over their shoulders. They take him to his bedroom and help him sit on the edge of his bed.
Abruptly, the pain and the images stopped. Dean was wrenched out of the memories and came up panting and confused. It took a moment for his eyes to focus, for his body to remember that maybe his heart shouldn’t be beating this hard, that maybe he needed to breathe. His throat hurt. Had he been screaming?
Dean swallows. Cas is leaving. “Sure.” Dean inclines his head towards the TV. “Wanna watch somethin’?”
He quickly goes over yesterday in his head while leaning against the counter sipping his coffee—they stocked up on groceries, drove back home, Dean cooked, took a shower before bed, then Cas came into his room and they talked a bit until Dean fell asleep.
Cas clutches at Dean’s shoulders when he comes, groaning, and the feeling of him releasing wet and hot between Dean’s legs is almost enough to make Dean come too. He’s cresting, pleasure built up almost as high as it can go, but not quite there yet, whining and shifting restlessly while Cas shudders through the aftershocks, panting into Dean’s hair.
"Heya, Sa-Sa-Sammy. How's our fav-v-vorite Mr. Lettuce Ha-Hair?"
They’re quiet for a while, just watching the ocean. Castiel catches himself not only keeping an eye on Jack but also on the beach around them, securing a perimeter. He knows that if there was anything evil or dangerous around, one of them would have noticed by now. He supposes old habits are simply hard to break.
“I won’t tell if you won’t. C’mon.” Dean puts some cookies on the plate and then fixes a glass of milk. “There you go.”
"It's okay, Cas."
“‘S just a w-w-waste of time, I can’t d-d-do it.”
With his tail between his legs, Dean shuffles back to his room, grabs a change of clothes, and locks himself in the shower.
That’s crybaby Dean talking though. It’s high time for getting-shit-done Dean to take over. To roll up his sleeves, put on his big boy pants, and—well, get shit done.
While Castiel’s own nervousness had already confused him, Dean’s reaction throws him completely. They’ve given each other presents before. How is this any different?
Taking stock for a moment, Dean concludes that his head is a lot better and while he’s still exhausted, he at least doesn’t feel like he got run over by a tank any longer.
He blearily blinks his eyes open.
Castiel nods but frowns, not understanding. What do their plans for Jack’s surprise birthday party have to do with this?
“C-C-Cas, c-c-can we—” Dean cuts himself off to clear his throat, struggling to keep his emotions from fucking up his already fucked up voice further. “When th-this sh-sh-shitshow is over,” he gestures at his head while still keeping his eyes closed, “a-a-a-and Sam isn't ab-b-bout to c-c-come b-b-b-bargin' into the room, c-c-can we talk?”
Cas hums, like he has to actually think about the answer. “There weren’t any witnesses, so I’m not sure it counts,” he says, and wow, leave it to Cas to tease Dean in a moment like this.
Cas draws out of the hug, his hands caressing down Dean's back and one coming to rest on his side. That would be nice on its own, if less nice than the hugging, but Cas is squinting up at Dean with worry again.
When Sam and Eileen return from their walk along the beach—hand in hand and sharing private smiles—they all start packing up and getting ready to leave. They’re planning on returning the next day and Castiel hopes that the ocean will be just as calm again.
Sam chuckles. Eileen, coming over from where she had been talking with Stevie, leans into his side and he puts an arm around her.
tomorrow. "I like it best when we all watch together. And I'm tired anyway."
"Dean?"
Dean starts rummaging through his drawer, his back to them. Sam clears his throat.
He can see why Dean would like it—except apparently, he didn’t?
Instead, Dean settles for clinking his beer bottle against Sam’s, “Prouda ya, Sammy.”
After arranging the presents next to the cake, Castiel carefully lights the three candles on it. He hopes they got everything right, as he doesn't have much experience with birthdays. They'd celebrated Sam’s and Dean's this year, but Dean had been adamant that they wouldn't make too much of a fuss about his, uncomfortable with being the center of attention.
Cas is being fucking bossy, again, but he’s also maybe sort of right, and Dean can appreciate that Cas doesn’t remind him of his promise to be careful and let Cas help.
. Even that simple touch feels so nice Dean is all but melting into it.
Sometimes Eileen or Jack will wander in and help out while Dean cooks—not because Dean needs it but just for fun. It’s nice and Dean likes teaching Jack the basics of cooking, but he likes this too, just being on his own and zoning out while his hands are busy.
Cas sighs like he wants to say ‘I told you so’ but Dean’s in such a pathetic state that he refrains.
Dean rolls his eyes and turns around to the stove.
The kid looks like he's out for the count, head leaned against the window at an uncomfortable looking angle. Dean's starting to feel too warm anyway, so he shrugs out of his jacket, holds it out to Cas. “Stuff that und-d-der his head, ‘m g-g-getting a crick in my n-neck just from w-w-watching.”
"Dude," Sam says with a laugh when Castiel finds them in the Dean Cave playing Zelda, "you're like, glowing. You look drugged. You sure there wasn't a little something extra in your coffee?"
It’s when he watches a small swarm of fish underneath them that he sees it, half-buried in the sand.
Mary holds up her hands in an
"'The Meat Man'," Cas counters, using air quotes again, "needs to finally decide which hoodie to wear." He rummages through the dresser again. "How about the charcoal one Eileen got you?"
Sadness clouds Dean’s eyes for a moment but then the look in them sharpens again.
Dean and Cas, together.
When they finally let go, they both wipe at their eyes and give each other shy smiles. Cas turns the sound on the movie back on. He hovers his hand over Dean’s, asks with his eyes for permission. Dean knows he’ll regret it later, but he turns his hand over in invitation, lets Cas lace their fingers together.
“Hey kid, what’s up?”
“C'mon, out with it. What's w-w-wrong with her j-j-j-joinin' us?”
Held.
A jaw instantly goes for his throat, but he blocks it with his left, teeth ripping into his forearm with needle-sharp pain, and then he’s sinking his knife into its heart and the hide-behind crumbles at his feet.
Dean makes that face that's a blend of fondness and irritation.
By the time they arrive in Fruita, Colorado, they've been on the road for nine hours. Eight is usually Dean's limit by now, even when they take lots of stops to stretch their legs. He's grumpy and his back hurts when he crawls out of the car in the parking lot of the H Motel just off Interstate 70. The kid had woken up a couple hours earlier but didn't seem in the mood for Cas and Sam's more or less gentle prodding, so Dean had put him to work looking for cheap motels with clean showers and nice beds.
Cas is silent for so long that Dean finally risks opening his eyes. It hurts, and he has to blink away moisture to be able to see Cas at all. Cas is studying Dean, and he looks kind of alarmed, so Dean hastily adds, “It's n-n-n-nothing b-b-b-bad, okay? Quit l-l-looking at me like I'm ab-b-bout to b-b-break up with you, it's n-n-not that.”
He vaguely thinks the others are talking to him but it barely even registers. He lets himself fall back against Cas, pleading, “Kn-kn-knock me out.
For the next half an hour, he just sits and watches the waves. It’s so soothing that he startles when his phone vibrates in his pocket with an incoming call. It’s Cas, and Dean quickly swipes to accept the call.
“And believe me,” Chuck was still ranting, “this hurts me too! How am I supposed to deal with one of my favorite characters ending up
Castiel sits down in the chair beside the bed and takes Dean’s hand in both of his as Dean lifts it up to be held.
Castiel sighs, shifting in his seat.
Endeared by how passionate Dean’s response to his story is, Castiel goes back to stroking a hand up and down his side, finding himself smiling softly.
Rolling his eyes in annoyance at the teasing, Sam throws his clothes towards the other shelter and then takes off running after the others. “You’re getting old!” Dean yells after him.
“Good morning,” Jack says, beaming at him.
“Do you want some of the letters to be lowercase? It will look more like your handwriting.”
Sam and Cas stop talking about ancient Sumerian hair products or whatever it was they were going on about that Dean was ignoring in favor of inhaling his food. Jack swallows, eyes fixed on his plate.
“Hydration is important, Dean.”
Very solemnly, Jack does as she’s suggested.
“It doesn't bother me,” Cas is saying, peering earnestly into Dean's eyes. “But is it because—did you have another flashback last night while I wasn’t there?”
Wordlessly, Dean nods. After kicking off his boots, he settles down on the bed on his side, an arm thrown over his face.
Dean pays for his items himself and doesn't help at all with putting their haul back into the cart. He seems to be taking special care to hide his cookie cutters from Castiel, not that Castiel is at all interested in the things.
“I’m sorry.”
"Soo—that means the ones with the Scooby boxers are fair game? And the ones with the Stetson and the
Molly seems a little taken aback by Jack’s, well, Jack-ness, but then she takes it in stride, shaking both their hands and inviting them to sit opposite her. She’s got a half empty coffee mug in front of her. When the waitress comes over, Dean orders a coke, and Jack does the same.
Dean huffs where he’s pressed his face against Castiel’s neck, seeking refuge, but he nods. Letting go and drawing back from the embrace, he quickly wipes a hand over his eyes and blinks against the sunlight.
“Yes.”
Dean, who was clearly dozing but jerks out of sleep as soon as he feels the mattress dip. “‘M awake!” he claims and quickly moves his hand to wipe away some drool from his cheek.
Dean nods, despite how his face still feels too warm and the fact that he is, without a doubt, a clingy idiot. “What?” He tries to sound like he’s completely cool, but instead his voice comes out more like a squeak. “Me? Sure. C’mon, l-l-let’s get g-g-goin’.”
Jack's expression crumbles, and Castiel draws him in to hug him, rubbing his back and swaying them gently from side to side. It's what he's learned to do to comfort Dean, and it works with Jack too. Soon enough, the boy leans back and wipes his eyes and nose on his sleeve.
. And then, we’ve been taking shifts keeping watch every night, and I know other places have started doing that too, but people keep disappearing and nobody’s seen a thing. No way a human could be that stealthy, ‘specially when carrying a body around. Hell, some people keeping
“That’s family.” She nudges his shoulder lightly. “So, spill. What’s wrong?”
The snow is falling heavier. Castiel blinks to clear his slightly misty vision.
Castiel lies beside him, stroking his back until he’s sure that Dean’s deeply asleep. Then he pulls a blanket over the both of them and reaches over to this bedside table for a book.
I—" He blows out a breath, frustrated with himself. "I don't know why I'm nervous."
Dean sucks in a sharp breath. He shakes his head in an almost desperate way and then covers it protectively with both of his arms, hiding himself from sight.
“It's alright, I'm just—” He sighs, and then abruptly shoves his plate over to Dean and gets out of the booth. “You can have it, I—I will wait outside.” Then he turns around and walks out.
Picking up the movements of his hips again, Dean continues, breathing the words against Cas's mouth. “I l-l-like k-k-kissing. H-hand-h-h-holding. Just lotsa t-t-touching.” He sighs, leaning his forehead against Cas’s. “Just g-g-go with what f-f-feels good, I’mma t-t-tell you if I d-d-don’t d-d-dig it.”
“Nah. Sam doesn’t know what a-a-al dente means.”
There's fingers carding through his hair. Dean's lying on something that's warm and a little bit wet. His head feels fuzzy and there's a dull ache behind his eyes.
Cas walks with Jack on the way back to their cars, listening while the kid talks animatedly about volleyball and the new friends he’s made. Eileen is quiet and doesn’t seem to be in the mood to talk—not that Dean can really talk to her without Cas’s or Sam’s help anymore—so Dean leaves her be. He spaces out for a while, the heat and the abundance of people getting to him too, until they’re at Eileen’s car and Jack tells Cas, “Oh, I didn’t know what else to say, so I said Dean’s my dad’s husband. I hope that was okay? I can say something else the next time if you’d prefer a different term.”
Cas huffs into the phone, and Dean is pretty sure Cas is rolling his eyes at him.
“It's not your fault, Dean,” Cas is saying.
“I’ll be right back,” Cas had said, squeezing Dean’s hand and then walking after Sam out of the room.
“Dude, are you okay?” Sam is holding Dean’s bowl and is frowning down at it and then at him. “You weren’t at breakfast either. And this is still half-full.”
Shifting around, Dean glares up at him, but the effect is completely ruined by the pink flush to his cheeks and ears.
By the time they finally leave the bath, Dean is loose-limbed and has a permanent smile on his face. He makes good-natured fun of the way Castiel’s hair curls behind his ears from the humidity and presses a kiss to the hinge of his jaw.
“I know you’re hungry, but you need to sit up a little.”
Dean usually hated it when people talked during movies—especially ones he considered art—but when he watched with Cas, he just couldn’t help pointing things out Cas might have missed and telling him all about the behind the scenes info and other trivia he knew. This time was no different, except that just as Dean was about to talk about the helicopter chase scene, he realized that Cas was watching him with a soft, almost amused look on his face.
“Shuddup,” Dean grumbles, “Moment’s not over.”
Sam’s hand was on his back, rubbing.
It doesn't. Really, Dean was having a great time enjoying the intimacy of him and Cas in their bed and being touched with such care. But then he fell asleep and missed out on some of it and when he woke up Cas wasn't touching him anymore and was all the way at the other side of the room.
“We’re not w-w-wearing r-r-rings or anything. No one’d bel-l-lieve it, I guess,” Dean says at length, torn between his head wanting him to stay realistic about this and the needs of his stupid, stupid heart.
“Hey,” he mumbles, wincing when it comes out weak and raspy.
“I’m not gonna yell. Okay? I just want you to listen to me, please Dean?”
Cas huffs. “Of course.” The exasperation in his tone is belied by the hand that brushes the side of Dean’s face and then starts carding through his hair.
Cas picks up the backpack again and they return to the trail.
"We've been over this, Dean. I look nothing like him."
When he exits the bathroom, he’s red-faced and almost stumbles over his feet. His heart is pounding and he feels awkward and shy in a way he usually never feels about the prospect of sex.
Cas huffs again. “I thought you were sleeping?”
“Y-you're w-w-welc-c-come, d-d-dude.” Dean's voice sounds like he's munched on sand paper, but Sam still snorts in amusement. Dean takes the glass away from his head and puts it on the nightstand because it isn't even helping. He opens his eyes again and despite the gentle lighting, they immediately start to water.
. You thought Sam would
“I really am. But I’m still taking it slow. I’m sorry I was so resistant to your care,” Castiel adds with a huff.
"He probably would, but I think, silently, he'd agree. He just doesn't like it when people know he's a… softie," Castiel says, trying out the term and making Jack laugh.
Dean leans forward to press a line of kisses along Cas's jaw.
“Ugh, what the
Dean just nodded, trying his damnedest to believe what his family was telling him. Sam had pulled him into another hug then, one that Dean could barely reciprocate, arms pressed against his sides. He had been getting hugged a lot lately, but the gentle touch still shook Dean to his core every time, not used to it anymore after months of complete isolation.
The loveseat actually used to be Cas and Dean's spot—for a while, anyway—but now Sam and Eileen are curled up in it. Sam has his arm around her and she's tucked into his side. In the corner of his vision, Dean can see her sign something to Sam and he smiles and presses a kiss to her temple.
There’s a drawn-out moment of silence while Dean tries to get a grip on his meltdown. And then Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, asking, “Dean? Could you look at me?”
“It's, um.” Dean fidgets with his hands, then rises and walks halfway around the table to stand beside Cas. “Just s-s-sucks that we d-didn't get more together-r-r t-t-time, y'know.”

“Dean? What’s wrong?” Cas's voice was soft with concern and he reached for Dean, put a comforting hand on his arm. And for the past couple weeks, Dean had either been too spaced out or in too much pain to process much, and then he’d just been so grateful and relieved to be with his family again. Had told himself that the pain and the weakness he was dealing with were worth their victory over Lucifer, were deserved for what Michael was able to do because Dean gave him his Sword.
“Just… d-d-don’t call me that when anyone could h-h-hear.”
"Cas—"
Dean snorts, shaking his head and chuckling at the almost scandalized expression on Cas's face. Looks like the kid ain’t as oblivious as they’d thought.
Dean manages to doze fitfully until Sam's alarm goes off at six in the morning. He winces at the shrill noise and Sam is quick to shut it off.
“D-d-don't c-c-care. More k-kissing.”
“How are you feeling?”
"Dude, how many more times—it doesn't mean what you think it means."
so warm and tender. Dean has been needing it so much—and instantly, the
“Hey.”
Cas huffs a breath of laughter. “I think the metaphysics of it would bore you. It actually wasn’t that difficult, just… time-consuming.” There are tears brimming on Cas’ lower lids. “You’ll be with all your loved ones. Forever. I promise you no matter what happens, you won’t be alone.”
Twenty minutes later, his phone rings.
“Prom-m-mised.”
Castiel has been in many different warzones in his impressively long lifetime, but Walmart the day before Christmas is a new one for him. It’s crowded, everyone seems angry about the fact that it’s crowded, and Castiel just had to fight a man in a full-body fur costume for the last box of Honey Nut Cheerios. Someone has thrown up in the canned goods aisle, and when Castiel turns his back for a moment to inspect some apples, a woman tries to steal the sliced bread out of his cart and then acts like she'd thought it was hers.
Sam was understandably confused. “You want me to read these?”
"I know you're not supposed to tell, but I think if I tell only you it'll be okay. When I blew out the candles on my cake to make a wish, I thought really hard that I wished for—for
Eileen and Sam will hold hands or give each other cheek kisses, and Dean will have to bear feeling so happy for his brother and yet so jealous at the same time. That’s just it, during the day, Dean’s distracted and has reason to keep a tight lid on his crap. But at night—
Dean tried to get Sam off him but found himself too weak, which only pissed him off more.
Right.
eating habits.”
Then one day he’d been sitting in the kitchen, shivering despite his three blankets and oversized hoodie. Sam brought him hot chocolate, and Dean heard himself say, “Th-thanks, um, S-S-S-Sam-m-my.”
, but it comes out sounding more like “Bwahh?”
Sam looks deeply disturbed, while Mary and Eileen are leaning on each other and giggling. Eileen signs something to Mary that Castiel doesn’t catch and then both of them are laughing so hard they have to sit down in the snow, smiles wide and radiant.
Dean didn’t really have a plan for today except maybe making Cas try out the hot tub with him. The others seem good with just lazing around for another day, not exactly eager to cram themselves in the car for the long ride back. Dean knows he’s going to miss his room and his home soon, but this feels like the long-earned vacation he’d never actually believed they’d get. Sure, Ocean Beach ain’t Hawaii, but they should be able to find a nice enough spot.
Sam hesitates.
“Dean, slow down. You were just sick earlier, you’re going to upset your stomach.”
None of them are swayed by his grumpiness either. Eileen even ruffles his hair on the way out, completely unimpressed with his scowling and grumbling. Even though he's older than her, Dean's started to wonder if this is what it's like having a big sister—it's unexpected but kind of nice. Doesn't mean he won't sulk about being denied his ghost army though.
“Dean?” Eileen asks when Dean stirs the soup. “Are you alright?”
Making himself comfortable, Castiel lies down, takes Dean’s hand in his and thinks,
Outside the bunker, there's the barest hint of light at the horizon. Morning dew is clinging to the grass, and a few birds are making noise already.
By the time Dean parks in the garage, it’s almost 3 in the morning. If Sam was waiting up and tracking Dean’s phone, he’d be here already, so that means he must have gone to bed at some point.
Dean sighs and looks down at their hands. “Y-yeah.”
Dean frowns and then grimaces, “Yeah.”
coming, rising up in all its ugliness. He wants it gone. It’s so shameful and disgusting, why can’t it just go away?
Right at this moment though, the sight of the clothes as Dean gets them out of the dresser only serves to irritate him further.
There’s drool under Dean’s cheek again but he doesn’t move, only closes his eyes again. Maybe that way, the moment won’t end. His brain isn’t really awake yet and it just feels so good being close to Cas and getting to be held like this.
“You know you do the same for me, right? When things—well, when things go bad, I feel like you’re the only being in the entire universe who I have any connection to. I know I can go to you, and you will understand.”
They watch the animals for a while longer in companionable silence. Truthfully, Dean
Frozen with his ‘forbidden’ treats in his hands, Jack stares at Dean wide-eyed like a baby deer in the headlights.
He’s feeling less smug when they stand in front of the entry to the left mine shaft. The sun is setting, painting the boulders a deep reddish orange, making the darkness in front of them appear like a chasm.
Goddammit.
His sight gets blurry under the water and the salt stings, so once he’s gotten what he came for he quickly surfaces again.
There’s five of them, and they were built up right next to the entry to the garage in that way no one arriving or leaving could miss them. Sam and Eileen, who had been driving ahead of Castiel and Mary, have already stopped the Impala and gotten out to investigate.
Dean steps forward into Cas's touch and Grace tingles through him, mending the worst of the cuts and bruises. A thumb strokes Dean’s cheek and then Cas withdraws his hand. When Dean blinks open his eyes, Cas is already on his way towards the metal fence where the others seem to be debating the best way to get past the fucking thing.
“I’m really happy for you, Dean,” he says, and Dean just nods. There’s a ping as Sam receives an email, and he goes back to whatever he was doing with his laptop and his files, and Dean realizes he has ripped another stripe off the label without noticing.
(When Sam teased him about it later, Dean shot back, "We're honey-m-m-mooners, Sam."
Dean just nods and waves him off.
“As f-f-for prot-t-tecting people… th-there’s someth-th-thing I b-b-been meaning-g-g t-to t-t-talk with you ab-b-bout.” Dean takes a deep breath. “I’ve b-been th-th-thinking… next t-t-time th-there’s a h-h-heavy d-d-duty c-c-case l-l-like this one, we g-g-give it t-to someone e-e-else.”
Cas brings up Nachzehrers but quickly dismisses the idea again since it doesn’t seem low profile enough for them. There’s been no sign of increased demon activity in the area so the others argue back and forth for a while about the possibility of djinn or witches until it’s determined that they don’t have enough to go on for a solid theory.
The stab of irrational disappointment is so sharp, Dean's appetite decides to curl up in a corner and die. He shoves his barely touched plate away from himself and scrubs a hand over his face.
Comfort won’t be welcomed right now, he knows. They need to see this through first.
In his periphery, he can see Dean nod. They’re both barefoot already and in their swim trunks, so they only have to take their shirts off. Castiel takes care with his capybara pin, putting his shirt down in such a way that he can see it’s still attached to the breast pocket.
Cas has turned around, but he’s hovering in the doorway. Seeing his own uncertainty reflected back at him like that makes Dean close to angry. He waves Cas in and Cas shuts the door and sits down on Dean’s desk chair.
“But in the end, they couldn’t build a home together—”
When he comes to, his heart rate has slowed down and his lashes are wet from tears he wasn’t even aware of. Cas has shifted him a little in his lap, probably because his dick was getting over-sensitive, and he’s rubbing a hand slowly up and down Dean’s spine, rocking them from side to side a little. There’s no icky feeling of drying spunk, so Dean must have been out long enough for Cas to have used the tissues from the nightstand to clean them up. Dean’s shivering a little, which must be why Cas also draped the blanket over his back.
There’s a handful of people inside, most of them hugging their coffees and barely glancing at the two of them. A tall black woman sits alone in a booth near the exit, and though she doesn’t look much older than Dean, there’s a tired wariness around her that Dean knows all too well. When she spots them, she waves them over.
move? Oh right, Dean did—and one kiss turns into two, into three. "Dean," Cas tries to protest, so Dean has to kiss him again. "Dean, dinner—"
It was too much. Castiel only meant to reassure and calm Dean, but it seems he achieved the opposite of it. He starts to apologize but Dean interrupts him, his voice hoarse and thick with tears.
do. You know what you d-did today?”
"It's one of mine. I thought you liked them?" Cas pauses where he was sorting their dirty clothes from their suitcase to put them in the hamper for Dean to wash later.
The nice feelings fade away when he’s done brushing his teeth and walks back into the empty room. After shutting off the light, Dean tosses and turns for a while. It’s not that the bed isn’t comfortable, but that it lacks—well, it lacks Cas. Cas, and his stupid body heat and stupid solid weight and stupid beefy arms and stupid calming presence.
"He did not," Sam and Jack say at the same time, amused.
Dean’s so focused on telling his girl how pretty she is that he completely misses Sam entering the garage.
“Oh, and Eileen sent you a message.”
Pretending not to know, Dean asks, "Sam up?" Or more like squeaks, because his voice is a traitor apparently.
“...C-C-Cas?”
“G-g-good-d?”
hippy brother. Christ, those omelets even smell disgusting. Sammy better appreciate this.
Dean’s muscles complain and his knees crack when he gets up. “Gimme a sec.” He cleans his hands at the sink but some grime remains under his fingernails, black and distracting. Dean frowns at it and then rips his gaze away and tells himself to get a grip.
Already halfway to the door, Cas hesitates. It makes him feel needy and stupid, but Dean can’t help the hopeful, pleading look he’s sure is on his face. Watching something together means they’ll close the door and sit side by side on the bed or in the armchairs in the Dean Cave. It means Dean gets Cas all to himself for a while—Cas’s attention, his body heat, his thoughts and opinions. His fond smiles whenever Dean says something ridiculous.
, Dean.”
“Cas?” Dean ducks his head and only continues once Cas looks at him again. “Listen. That stuff you’re t-t-talking about? Nobody is b-b-born being good at th-that. And it a-a-ain’t about that anyway. Kissing, sex? It ain’t a perform-m-mance. It’s ab-bout bein’ close. F-f-f-eeling good. You d-don’t need to be a pro at it f-f-for that.
Taking a deep breath through his mouth, Dean closed his eyes, then nodded.
getting tired—or his arms are, at least. When he’s done with the koalas, he’ll have Cas push him. He wants to take his time with this and not leave early. He’s never really been to a Zoo before. Especially not with his entire family—not that it matters that much to Dean what it is they do, as long as they’re all together. Speaking of—
but some kind of weirdly strangled sound is all that makes it out of his throat.
This time the smile Sam sends him is more encouraging than sad. “For now, get some rest. And then talk to him. Let him know that if he can’t be there, if it’s too much, no one will blame him. But I think it will be good for him to be there, so he can start associating that day with better things, happy memories.”
“Of course I am,” he says, speaking the truth. “Why wouldn’t I be?” Frowning, he tries to think back over their conversation but he can’t find the thread that led to this.
Dean had rubbed at his jaw and swallowed, shaking his head. In his mind, he could already see the frowns on Sam and Cas's faces as they struggled to understand what he was saying but tried, for his sake, to act like his voice was what it used to be instead of shattered and wrong. He could imagine the way their expressions would slip into disappointment after learning that there was yet another thing that would not be coming back. And he could feel already the pain of everyone inevitably turning away when they realized the changes were permanent, of them going on with their lives, Dean scrambling to keep up but ultimately left behind, alone, because he couldn’t be who they needed anymore.
When Eileen announces that the last one in the water will have to buy everyone dinner, she and Jack start running towards the ocean immediately. Sam is still wearing his t-shirt and his sandals and almost falls on his behind in his haste to get them off.
Dean swallows, needing a moment to digest that. “You were t-t-tryin’ to protect people, Cas. Th-that’s important. I c-c-can’t fault you for th-that.”
“Of course. What are we watching?” Castiel asks and signs.
“I’ll see to him.” Cas meets Dean’s eyes, checking if Dean’s good for now, then gets off the ground.
we’re talking about messing with here. Forgive me for not wanting to play fast and loose with that.”
Dean rolls his eyes at them, though privately, in his head, he agrees.
"Sam says they made dinner. You should eat."
Leaning his head against the top of Jack’s, Dean holds him tighter. Holds him for as long as he needs.
"Dean… what happened? I just… I want to understand."
Locating it at the edge of their shelter, Dean tosses it to Eileen, who catches it easily. She gives him a thumbs up and then offers him a one-armed hug. After a moment of hesitation while he parses out if he wants it or not, Dean leans in. She squeezes him briefly and then lets go. “See you later!”
“I’m not
“Be c-c-careful, okay?”
In the parking lot, they put the groceries into the back and then Dean gets back into the driver’s seat. Moving his arms helped a little but he’s starting to get seriously uncomfortable. Cas must notice when he comes back after folding up Dean’s wheelchair and putting it in the trunk.
Cocking their head to the side when he noticed the bow in their legs, Michael ran a hand down their inner thigh. “Hm. A little unusual, but I don’t mind.”
Dean just hums at that, soothed by the knowledge that Sam’s okay.
“Do you mean,” Cas says at length, sounding utterly confused and dismayed, “that every time I’ve touched you like this… you had a panic attack after?”
Ducking his head, Dean angrily swipes a hand over his face. "'s fine."
It's so nice that Dean must fall asleep at some point, because the next thing he's vaguely aware of is being lifted bridal style into someone's arms. And then his head is resting against Cas's chest, and Dean should really
When he starts to sing, making sure his voice is as deep as he can go, Dean melts into him like he’s finally found the comfort he’s been seeking.
The only reason Dean doesn’t plomb down immediately on the king size bed in their room is that he really needs the bathroom first. Once he’s done he fumbles off his boots, makes a beeline for the bed, and lets himself fall on top of it with a groan.
When they’ve trudged down the stairs in the bunker and entered the war room, Eileen briefly draws Dean into a hug. It’s warm and gentle and Dean’s still aching all over and can’t find it in him to refuse the comfort.
She shrugs. “But It’s okay, I mean… I still got a job to do, and that’s protecting my friends out there. That keeps me going.”
stamped on his forehead.
"You are helping, Cas. By staying here and resting and helping with research."
Castiel starts to hum the introduction of the song, and Dean repositions his head slightly. For some reason, he always seems to greatly enjoy feeling the vibration of Castiel’s voice in his chest.
Ignoring the interruption, Castiel continues, “It is not known anymore how the bird and the fish came to meet, but they were immediately intrigued with each other. They did not speak each other’s language but communicated through gifts—seashells for the bird and flower blossoms for the fish. The bird admired the fish’s bravery in facing all the dangers of the deep ocean every day. The fish marveled at the bird’s ability to build a cozy home out of sticks and moss. They met in the shallows every day, and every day they fell deeper in love with each other.”
do the clean up for once, or so help him.
“D-don’t be. You’re h-h-helping.”
Eileen, who's sitting opposite him, consolingly pats his arm. "At least no one's making you try kale smoothies."
“What? When?”
“What’s up?”
“It’s a tool, a useful one, but it’s not who I am. And I miss, I miss experiencing the world like you do. I couldn’t protect people the way I can do now, if I gave it up, so that is holding me back. But…”
"Hey, handsome," Dean greets him, his tone deceptively casual and relaxed, though Castiel can hear the worry underneath.
Despite all the sleeping Dean had already done at the hospital, he must drift off at some point. He’s startled awake by soft noises in the hallway—low voices, and then a door closing, and then footsteps that falter as they come close.
Or... Cas is simply not a stay-in-bed-and-cuddle, sleepy-morning-kisses kinda guy. The dude doesn't sleep; Dean should be content that Cas wastes a couple hours every night letting Dean fall asleep next to him and staying until he's really out for the count. Sometimes he even lets Dean falls asleep on his chest, and if Dean wakes up alone later, well, it's still more than he's ever had before. He shouldn't complain.
it, needs to get it off. He scratches at his skin and then hands seize his, stopping him, squeezing with enough force that it doesn’t hurt but he can’t easily get out of the grip either.
Dean thinks he should maybe be offended, but he's mostly just confused at the sudden change of topic.
“I love you—so much.
Sitting down beside him on the bed, Castiel puts a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder but doesn't say anything yet. Since Dean feels everything so deeply, Castiel has learned that it greatly benefits Dean—both of them, really—when Castiel gives him time to process and sort himself out.
Down the hill, he can hear the noises of Sam and Jack and Eileen engaged in a snow fight, and further away the fireworks in the city. All of it fades into the background until there's just the soft crackling of the fire, and Dean's heart beating against his, and the stars above them, silent but bright.
“Guys? We got food.”
The kid looks up at Dean and hesitates for a moment before saying, “I... I'd like to share with Castiel, if that's alright.”
In an instant, the pain was gone, and Dean had nodded his thanks at Cas. He’d still felt like crap, but when didn’t he?
Dean sniffs and turns his face away, rapidly blinking his eyes as if to try and get rid of the moisture there.
“I better get back. We’re about to rewatch Tombstone, but Dean expressed a craving for mini marshmallows.”
"I am. I…" Absently drying the plate, Castiel lets his gaze wander over the kitchen and all the signs of domesticity there.
! We didn’t finish our conversation about this. I still don’t know what
Jack puts his notepad away, steeples his fingers together on the table.
“I will do no such thing. The context of our situation was completely different and I will not have you tell yourself it was the same. It was
Dean recoils and then his control snaps.
Thoroughly unimpressed and disgusted, Dean had merely shrugged.
Sam looks after his brother for a moment and then he sighs, fumbling with the keys. Eileen puts a hand on his arm and starts signing, expression soft with sympathy. Castiel turns away to give them privacy, trying to settle into a more comfortable position. It’s just then that Jack returns from using the restroom in the diner down the street
On the way to the infirmary, Sam had only told Castiel not to worry if Dean seemed a little in and out. Now, a part of Castiel wants to be irked that Sam wasn’t upfront about what exactly that meant. But Sam means well, he knows that. Sam’s trying to take care of both of them, to keep them from worrying too much.
When Dean finally draws back, Castiel remembers that he has yet to give him his present. Twisting around, he picks up the paper bag that he’d sat down on the bed and then puts it in Dean's lap.
still hurt, and it's bound to get worse, and anyway, is it too much to ask for a damn kiss on the mouth? “Really really b-b-b-bad.”
Desperately, Dean tries to crawl away from the edge, but it's too late. His control over his limbs is slipping away as they start to shake violently. The world tilts on its axis. For just a second, he's in free fall, and then icy cold water envelopes him and floods his mouth and takes his breath and freezes his heart.
When his tears stopped and he could take his hands away from his eyes, he was given tissues and orange juice. Sam was fiddling with Dean’s phone.
“Huh,” Dean says, swaying closer to Cas. “I’m g-g-gonna t-t-t-teach him some more anyw-w-way.”
Cas sounds composed, but his eyes are shining with emotion. Dean’s fingers clench in his shirt, and it takes him a moment until he can speak. Even then, his voice is shaky. “Thanks.” Dean curls himself tighter around him, closes his eyes against the heat that’s building behind them. “That, um. Th-that means a l-l-l-lot.”
Then Jack looks up and turns around, "Welcome back! We baked cookies!" He offers Castiel a bright, proud smile that infuses Castiel with such a burst of unexpected happiness he almost feels like he needs to sit down. "I can see that. Can I help?"
The door to their room is slightly ajar. Only the lamp on the left nightstand is on and Dean is lying curled up and with his back to it on the other side. He has a hand covering his eyes and Castiel walks around the bed to sit beside him.
“Dean?”
Startled out of his day dream—stupid heat, making him drowsy—Dean nods his agreement. Cas lets go of his hand, which Dean is less a fan of, but then Jack asks if he can push Dean. Eileen and Sam walk hand in hand to one side of them, Cas on the other. Despite the warm weather, Cas is wearing his stupid coat, and he’s looking through a pamphlet one of the zookeepers gave them earlier with a frown of concentration, and Dean couldn’t be fonder of him.
“Huh? What?”
Sitting cross-legged at the foot end of the bed, Jack is more awake. He's watching the show with a happy expression, the platypus pin attached to the front of his t-shirt glinting softly in the light of the TV.
Dean lies down on his side with the two biggest pillows leaning against his back, and arranges the other two at his front, draping his arm over them. With his eyes closed and bracketed in from both sides, his heart rate finally goes down and the restless energy in his limbs settles.
Dean draws back to scowl at him, affronted. Hey now! That's one of his best lines!
Dean throws ground beef into the cart and rolls his eyes.
Cas shifts on the bed and then there’s the sound of him quietly picking up a book and slowly turning the pages. A tear escapes Dean’s tightly shut eyes and drips down his cheek to fall soundlessly onto the bed and disappear.
At this point, Dean’s heart rate would never recover.
“They’re most active during dusk and at night. The lighting cycle in their enclosure has likely been reversed to mimic evening light during the day and daylight at night,” Cas explains. He takes Dean’s hand in his and starts absently stroking over his knuckles. It’s so nice Dean kind of zones out for a bit, letting the voices of his family wash over him without really listening.
Confused at his outburst, Castiel takes a moment to gather his thoughts. “Well, they were two different species of two very different worlds. The bird would drown in the ocean and the fish suffocate on the land. There is a version of the story where the moon, hearing their cries, takes pity on them and lifts them up into the sky as binary stars—what you now know as Sirius A and Sirius B. In another version, the fish is so heartbroken it grows wings to join the bird in the sky, which was possibly used to explain the species of the so-called flying fish.”
They have cuddled during the night and sometimes while Dean’s napped, but that has been about it. Now, he watches Dean sleep beside him and observes the bags under his eyes and the way his thick fingers look, loosely gripping the comforter beneath him.
When the show is over, Jack leaves for his own room, expressing once again how excited he is to go to the beach the next day. Dean is fast asleep by now and Castiel is loath to wake him, but Dean's still wearing the clothes he was wearing all day. And Castiel knows how much Dean hates the way his mouth tastes when he wakes up in the morning after not having brushed his teeth the night before.
“Nah, we got it.”
Startled, Dean looks up at him but Cas is looking outside at the stars.
“Mm, yes, talk dirty to me.”
Dean studies Sam for a moment. That tension from earlier is back in his jaw and he keeps fiddling with his phone. So, nervous, but also...angry? What the hell?
Castiel had meant to check in on Dean, but he seems fine right now, and intent on squabbling with his brother. The tables are all set, so he chooses a seat strategically, wanting to be able to keep everyone in his sight.
“It’s a surp-p-prise,” Dean answers, grinning.
And then he’s running across the sand, almost giddy when he hears Cas's follow. Just as he’s splashing into the turf, arms come up around him, and Dean’s laughing when they crash together into the waves. He’s still smiling when he resurfaces, wiping water from his eyes. Cas is frowning at the ocean he’s in almost grumpily, like for some reason he didn’t expect to get soaking wet when he fell headfirst into it.
Shortly after, there's the sound of the Impala rumbling her way up the hill. When Jack emerges from the driver's side to the sounds of cheers from their guests, he freezes, looking completely overwhelmed again.
Dean swished the rest of his hot chocolate around in his mug, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. “It’s your home too, dummy.” How many more times did he have to say this? Also Cas wouldn’t need to miss doing stuff like this if he just left less!
The next day is about the same. He’s still stuck in bed and that irritates him to no end. The food is less of a problem at first, because Dean has cooked it and it tastes good and Castiel has missed actually tasting things. But as his grace recovers, things start to taste like molecules again, so in the end the food irritates him as well.
Cas sounds scared. Dean is scaring him. Because Dean…
From one moment to the next, he just felt—weird. Like his heart had stopped even though it hadn’t, like his body was floating away from him. The kitchen suddenly smelled like flowers. Distantly, he heard Kit ask if he was okay, and then Dean went down on one knee, and the lights in the kitchen turned painfully bright, and then he didn’t know anything anymore for a while.
A dull, familiar pounding is starting in his head.
Watching Dean now, Castiel feels a responding ache in himself, as he always does when Dean is hurting in some way. But there is fondness there as well at seeing Dean trying so hard to do this for Jack.
“Dean—” he tries as Dean settles him on the bed and starts tugging at Castiel’s laces. Dean doesn’t react, his head ducked down and shoulders rigid. His jaw is clenched so tight his teeth must hurt, and his lower lids are brimming with tears. Castiel can feel his own throat close up at the sight. After taking off Castiel’s shoes, Dean then helps him out of his trenchcoat and blazer.
can have touches again. It wants the touches
“Yes, you’ve said so,” Cas agrees tentatively. He sounds like he’s trying not to spook Dean. “But Dean, you know you can talk to me. I wish—I want to help you, but I can’t if I don’t know what’s wrong.”
When his awareness returned, he was lying on his side on the floor, and Sam was crouching beside him. He was holding a bloody piece of fabric to Dean’s head and explained that Dean had hit his head on the shelf when he fell, except Dean didn’t remember falling at all. “You seized again,” Sam had said. “Dean, we can’t ignore this. We gotta have this checked out.”
It was meant to be teasing but Cas not only rolls with it, he one-ups him.
After a night of very little sleeping and a lot of worrying, Dean drags himself to the kitchen only to find everyone already there.
“I wished I could do more to help,” Molly is says, her voice heavy with regret. “But actual hunting… I can’t do that anymore.”
Startled from his reverie, Dean looks up at Cas where he’s suddenly appeared at his side, then motions at the enclosure in front of him. “Just wanted to watch a little longer.”
He won't wake for at least three hours, and Castiel decides to use the time to get some rest himself. There's the blanket he's been knitting and the podcast he has yet to finish, but for now, what he really wants is just to lie next to Dean and listen to both of them breathe.
is… different somehow. Dean doesn’t feel so out of control. Because Cas knows now, and he gets it. Cas looked at him and saw him and still holds Dean like this.
To course-correct his thoughts, Castiel picks up his present for Jack that he hasn't wrapped yet. It's a photo album in plain forest green, Jack's name written on the cover in black cursive.
Sam is standing in the doorway to the kitchen, looking annoyed.
“We could, if we wanted to. Do you want to?”
? What th-the
For a beat it looks like Cas is going to fight him, but then he deflates. Dean goes back to shoving chili fries into his mouth. When he looks out to the parking lot in search of the kid, he finds him leaning against Baby's side, head bowed.
“Come on, out with it. You wanna yell at me, just do it.”
he had asked of Dean all those months ago when Dean had finally confessed his need for more physical affection. It doesn’t feel right to be cross with Dean for hiding this though, not when he thinks about how overwhelmed with guilt and, yes, trauma Dean must be at the prospect of Jack’s birthday. And then to have to see Castiel like this today, unconscious and so similar to how it must have looked when he was dead...
Cas watches Dean struggle to swing his legs over the edge of the bed and then resolutely tells him to stay put while he draws him a bath. He helps him hobble to the bathroom, helps him out of his clothes, not that Dean’s wearing more than a tee and boxer shorts. Cas left the door open but didn’t turn on the light, so while it’s fairly dark inside the bathroom, Dean still blushes when Cas tugs his underwear down his legs. This is not how he imagined being naked in front of Cas for the first time.
Dean bristles. So what if he’s nesting? Somebody’s got to. Mrs. Butters was right, they shouldn’t lose sight of comfort and nice things. And Dean’s an
“We're staying at the Kings Inn. It has a pool, and a hot tub. The reviews said the rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable. There's a Mexican restaurant and a diner called Waffle Spot on site.”
Not even bothering to point out how Castiel is very visibly shivering, Dean nudges his arms up so he can get the t-shirt and hoodie on him easier. Soon enough, Castiel is dressed and tucked into bed again, and Dean brings him chicken noodle soup. Castiel has no idea when he’s had the time to cook it.
and then it's gone.
"Of course not, Jack."
Scooting his chair closer, Castiel wraps his left arm around Dean’s back and puts his right hand over Dean’s. Dean swaps his last try out with another blank card.
comes—like a hermit crab, it tries to claw its way out of its shell, out of
“Hey. You okay?”
Cas makes a face like he’s chagrined.
“I’m—” Cas looks down with a puzzled frown, but then it clicks. “You… need more affection?”
Obviously, this is affecting Dean for reasons Castiel doesn’t know, but he’s content to wait until Dean is ready. And if he’s never ready, that’s okay too.
“I checked for EMF, but, well… places we live, safe to say lots of people have died there. Then there’s the lack of bodies, never heard of a ghost doing that. Thought about demons next, though usually they don’t take care to hide the bodies either. Hid some devils traps all around our camp, put up sigils. Didn’t do any good. Friend of mine was gone the next day. I’d known her for five years.”
Castiel knows Dean has a point, but he does not like it. He can't always be there, no matter how much he wants to.
in Dean doesn’t care that Cas is just down the hall, that Cas’s touches are safe and that
His head is still bowed over his notepad and he can’t see it, but Jack’s earnest inquiries have made a soft smile appear on Molly’s face, the first genuine one Dean’s seen on her.
“Dude, you okay? You b-b-been k-k-kinda quiet a-a-all day. Something w-w-wrong?”
They’ve reached the motel parking lot by now, and Dean parks a couple spots away from Eileen’s beat-up Toyota Corolla. Baby’s engine ticks as it cools down, but neither of them makes any move to get out of the car.
Dean looks up and winks at him. "You c-c-could help me, t-t-too. Could use a—st-t-teady hand w-w-with these." Then he giggles again like he's just made a hilarious joke.
“What’s wrong?”
At least food has never let Dean down. Except then his ice cream is gone and he’s still feeling sulky.
Some indeterminate amount of time later, Dean becomes aware of Cas's voice. "Dean? Dean, can you hear me?"
“This is… for me?” He can’t seem to believe it.
It had taken Dean a moment to even understand what Chuck was talking about but then he wanted to punch him in the face all over again.
Reaching for him, Cas stops him with a touch to his elbow. Their eyes meet. Cas is looking up at him from where he’s sitting at the table, but it’s Dean who feels small.
At Castiel's side, Dean snickers, “Need some help there, Tony Carlson?”
“Looks like the big bad bear is in need of feeding again.”
And since he's also being kept from cooking something nice in his kitchen, that means burgers for him when they stop for lunch a couple hours later. Sam scrunches his nose and nags Dean about his cholesterol, but Dean tunes him out. The concept of comfort food appears to be entirely lost on Sam.
Dean waves him off. It irks him that he has to sit here while everyone else does all the work, but he’s going to need every last bit of strength to make it back to the car.  It gets progressively darker while he waits, and chillier. The others have turned their flashlights on when they get back about fifteen minutes later, and Dean shakily rises to his feet.
Dean can't even be mad about that because it would have been a hundred percent true. And also, The Waffle Spot is the best place to get waffles in all of California, and what psycho doesn’t love waffles. Dean’s already looking forward to stuffing his face there first chance he gets.
Dean pushes the button. The screen lights up.
Dean rolls his eyes and yet hisses when Castiel starts to gently apply the cream. “It’ll m-m-mess up th-th-the sheets,” he complains, but then falls silent and watches Castiel work, his eyes starting to glaze over a bit.
“Dean?”
Dean leaves Sam's food on the stove for him to graze on when he comes back. He prepares some more coffee, and this time even remembers he's not a Neanderthal and pours Cas a cup as well. Then he takes his plate of eggs and sits his butt down on the chair across from Cas, shoving some dusty books out of the way.
He made to lie back down, already dreading what that meant. But Sam held him back, sputtering, “Are you out of your mind?! Dean, you only barely made it through this round! If we hadn’t stopped—”
Dean nods, and then when they stand he accepts the hug Sam draws him into.
Cas hums and briefly stops playing Candy Crush to text the others who are driving in Eileen’s car behind them.
, oh yes. He opens his mouth in invitation and Cas deepens the kiss, still a little clumsily but Dean doesn't need him to be an expert at this, he just needs
There’s an agony-filled howl that abruptly cuts off, and warm blood flooding over Dean’s hands where both of them are holding onto the hilt of his knife. He stumbles to his feet. There’s ringing in his ears and a tightness in his chest and it’s hard to remember where he is.
“They ask if we want help.”
like?”
“You haven’t taken that apron off in like a week.”
short.
Dean grabs his box of cookie cutters that's he's been hiding under one of the empty shopping bags, shoulders past Castiel, and stalks out. Tense silence follows his departure.
“I need it out! Now! All of it!” The thought of even a little bit staying inside him made him want to gag, made his hands itch to claw his skin off and dig it out of him himself.
“D-d-did you just ask m-me why C-C-Cas and me aren't h-havin'
“And it w-w-was cute,” Dean chimes in, defensively. “A-a-and grumpy, so we pl-l-layed peek-a-boo.”
“Kid ok-k-kay?”
get comfortable.
Dean gives Cas directions and then they hang up. About fifteen minutes later, Eileen and Cas arrive, both looking worse for wear. Eileen is wearing a suit but has taken her jacket off and is using a pamphlet to fan herself. Dean scoots to the right so she can sit where there’s more shade. His instinct is to get her something to drink, but she’s already taken care of that herself, fishing a bottle of cooled water out of the little plastic bag she’s carrying and pressing it against her temple.
“The tallest, fastest roller coaster of San Diego, with an upside down view of Mission Bay! It sounds like fun!”
It takes them over an hour to go through all the photos on both their phones and to start organizing them. Well, it’s mostly Cas busily sorting them into different folders while Dean watches sleepily through half-lidded eyes.
He’s behind Baby’s wheel and they’ve torn out of the bunker by the time Dean remembers that it’s really risky for him to be taking drives by himself now. Especially when it’s dark and rainy and stormy outside. He needs to soothe the
Castiel had hoped that Dean would fall asleep either while they cuddled or later during the movie, but it’s past two in the morning and Dean is still awake. Dinner had been spaghetti and meatballs, with Castiel stealing the occasional bite from Dean’s plate. He couldn’t be faulted for it really—Dean makes a mean tomato sauce. And it is always far more fun sneaking bits from Dean than having his own plate.
“What?”
Back in their room, he guides Dean to sit back down on the bed. He grabs a plastic bucket that he places in easy reach and fills a glass with water to be put on the nightstand. He helps Dean out of his pants and flannel while Dean blinks against what are probably black spots obstructing his vision.
Unable to keep looking at him, Dean drops his gaze down to where he’s anxiously playing with his fingers in his lap.
"Wanna try out your new game?" Sam asks Jack, probably sensing that Dean needs a moment. Jack lights up.
Cas?”
A little grudgingly, Jack nods.
Dean claps Cas on the shoulder, “C’mon buddy, l-l-let’s go.” And then he trips over his feet in his haste to get away and the only reason he doesn’t fall flat on his face is that Cas is quick enough to steady him. He doesn’t turn around to check if anyone saw that, just makes a beeline toward where he’d parked Baby.
Heart skipping a painful beat, Dean goes tense all over before his brain has even fully caught up with events. He’s about to gently dislodge Jack when he realizes that Jack’s hands are bunched into Dean’s flannel at his back, that the kid is hiding his face in Dean’s chest.
He knows he won't see Cas again. Or any of them. There's no way he's going where Cas thinks he is. Not after everything he's done.
Dean smiles at her and opens his arms wide for a hug that he then tries his best not to melt into too much. Eileen doesn’t seem to mind though. She squeezes him, and then Dean draws back.
He’s barely walked three feet when the smell hits him. It’s not the stomach turning stench of rotting remains, but still carries that certain sweetness of death. Slowing down but not stopping, he lets his flashlight wander over the walls of the mine.
Sam must have ordered take-out because he’s carrying several big plastic bags. Dean can smell pad thai and his mouth waters. Moments later a container is plopped into his lap and then he’s not interested in anything except getting the food inside him as fast as he can.
Ducking away, his ears feeling like they’re on fire, Dean grabs a dishtowel to fiddle with. “‘Course. Now scram, before—”
He’s selected a pin of a platypus for Jack and one of a capybara for himself, when he spots Dean two aisles over. He’d said he wanted to wait outside, but now he’s staring intently at a shelf with various plushies, an unreadable expression on his face.
Instantly, Dean had felt like he’d been dunked in ice water, like his heart had been put inside a vice. “Michael’s still—? He—”
Maybe it’s the exhaustion combined with the fear, or maybe Dean’s just an overly emotional wreck of a human being, but instead of starting to talk, Dean starts to cry.
big—he could wrap them around Dean’s and hold them no problem.
Jack accepts both and then looks at Dean like he did when he got his lopsided birthday cake. “Thank you, Dean.”
He listened dispassionately as the doctor explained to him about abnormal brain activity, about different types of seizures, about how for half the people with epilepsy, there was no identifiable cause. He was given a whole stack of glossy pamphlets that like half a rainforest had to die for, and a prescription for drugs that would cost them an arm and a leg if they didn’t have rigged credit cards.
“Well, I’ve cha-a-anged my m—my m-m-mind.”
They’d somehow managed to wrap Dean’s present in a way that didn’t make it immediately obvious what it was. Dean had been joking about the size of it, but when the wrapping paper fell away, he abruptly fell silent.
It takes another long moment, but finally, Cas sighs, and shifts to sit up straighter against the headboard. He doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand, though. Instead, he draws it into his lap and puts his other hand on top of his and Dean’s, protective.
There’s a knock on the doorframe. “Dean?”
Michael re-dressed them, but in different clothes. He could just snap his fingers and get it over with, but he took his time with every single piece. Like sliding a treasured sword back into an expensive sheath, Michael caressed their fingers over the fabric, slowly slid the pants up their legs, the fine hairs there catching on the cloth. Dean gagged and a wave crashed over him. Mud and sea foam oozed down his throat, clogging it.
“Food l-l-later. Sleep now,” he announces, kicking off his boots and snuggling right in. Then he reaches up, eyes already closed, and tucks at Cas's pants leg until he sits down next to him on the edge of the bed. “Stay until I’m asl-l-leep?” He asks, nudging his pillow with his head until it’s shaped around him the way he likes.
“Where’re the others?” Dean asks when Cas moves behind him to push his chair after Dean indicates he’s ready to move on.
“Cas said they should be back by tonight,” Sam continues after a moment. “Please just—try, okay? I don’t… I don’t want to find you like this again if we can help it. Okay?”
Cas searches his eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me? I’m not mad,” he adds when Dean grimaces, “It’s just… this is such a small thing. I don’t understand why you would think I would deny you something so simple.”
Dean pauses, then finger spells the word he doesn’t know the sign for.
Except then Cas would move his arm away. Dean would have to leave the warm, safe shelter of his body. Well, he would have to do that eventually anyway, but—maybe just another moment.
swallow wrong and send himself coughing, but enough so that he savors the way Cas pats his back after he's done saying his I-told-you-so’s.
“Hello, Dean. How are you feeling?”
“Gah,” Dean says, brain to mouth filter completely shot. He swallows and tries to form actual words this time, “C-Cas. Um. What a-a-are you doing-g-g?”
It’s not until Castiel is sitting in the Impala with Sam and Eileen, Baby's windshield wipers fighting against the falling snow, that he realizes he’d left without their goodbye kisses.
Cas rolls his eyes in exasperation as he gets up from the table but when he turns his head away, Dean can see him try to fight down a smile.
"Gonna go get more beer," he mumbles, even though there's a cooler in the Cave and he hasn't even finished his first one. He just—he just needs a moment to get a grip.
Sam has stepped out of the cabin, frantically motioning at Cas to hurry it up. Scrambling for the door handle, Castiel steps back out into the snow.
Castiel wisely does not point out that the snowman actually does kind of look like Sam. He hadn’t known Dean has such a talent for snowman crafting—even its eyebrows look exactly like Sam’s do when he disapproves of something. He wonders who helped Dean with the writing.
“Tell me ‘bout you guys’ super secret project. How’s it going?”
“But this wasn’t even that bad. I was merely out for a few seconds, and—”
“I don’t even l-l-like soup.”
. It’s like a snake lives under its skin, and the look in its eyes is far too intelligent; black eyes narrowing in suspicion as it closes in on the boulder behind which the phone lies. Sniffing the air, it growls; deep and angry like thunder rolling in.
“What t-t-time’s it?”
Cas's voice is raw with emotion, and Dean fists his hands into the back of his shirt. It’s not the first time Cas has told Dean this, but it still strikes Dean to his core, leaves him light-headed and wobbly-lipped and vulnerable.
"I, um." He still doesn't know what to say, so he gently takes Dean's hand in his, reaches inside the satchel and puts one of the rings inside on Dean’s finger. The second, slightly wider ring, he places on Dean's palm. And then he lets go off his hand and draws back.
The moment Sam turns off Baby’s engine, Dean's there, opening the backseat door. Castiel lets Dean help him stand, and they make their way to their room together, Cas leaning on Dean. Dean doesn’t say a word and determinedly avoids Castiel’s eyes.
But Cas didn’t say Yes Dean, you’re right, this is my home and I’m going to stay here in your line of sight now where I’m safe. He just squeezed Dean’s shoulder gently and then went back to watching the movie.
Sam seems unconvinced and he’s still holding Dean’s stupid bowl. Cas is looking at Dean with worry. “Are you nauseous?” He asks, already reaching to touch Dean’s head with two fingers. “I can—”
“Woah, C-Cas, hey. W-w-what’s all th-that t-t-talk about d-d-dyin’? Y-you th-think ab-b-bout that a l-l-lot?”
Dean nudges Jack’s shoulder again and points in their direction.
It doesn’t look like he’s ready to talk though, and the silence isn’t awkward, so Dean just drives and gives him space.
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on something more substantial," Cas says, still visibly amused. "And vegetables."
“Yes! He wanted to get an early start! Oh, right, I’m supposed to give you these.” Jack reaches over and puts Baby keys down beside Dean’s plate.
Something about the urgency in Sam’s voice is even worse than if he were angry and yelling.
“You’re fixing it,” Dean says. “The thing th-that’s been ups-s-setting me? That I, um, need-d-d? You’re fixing it alread-d-dy.” He nods to their hands.
Jack looks horrified, and yeah, Dean can’t blame him. People suck.
"W-w-woke up l-l-like an hour ago."
Sam snorts and then chuckles. "Cas, they got you wrapped around their fingers."
Cas frowned. “You didn’t have to do that.”
They what now? Aren’t those the ones that look like overgrown guinea pigs?
“Oh yeah? Then why aren't you sleeping together?”
Swallowing, Dean nods. “‘Kay.” He looks up at Cas. “You g-g-gotta t-t-take y-your own adv-v-vice, though. ‘C-c-can’t save ev-v-veryone’, right? A-a-and Cas, you k-k-killed the damn th-thing. You st-t-topped it. A-a-and for the people h-here? That d-d-does m-m-make a d-d-difference.”
There's agreement from all sides, though Castiel notices that Dean remains suspiciously quiet.
“Hey, you e-e-eaten yet?”
"It's fine," Dean grumbles, embarrassed and annoyed by it. He throws the blanket to the side and kicks his pants the rest of the way off, then stalks over to his dresser.
in the heart of our family.” Cas squeezed Dean’s fingers, voice wavering with emotion. “And that was not because Dean the hunter was gone, our leader and protector. It’s because
Dean sucks in a breath. “Please stop asking. I get it, okay?” Sam has fallen silent. Dean turns his head away and rapidly blinks his eyes. “I’ll be more careful. I promise. But I can’t—”
Dean doesn't pick up.
He starts to ramble excitedly about the movie, and Castiel feels warmed all the way through by the joy in his eyes.
“Actually, I, um. I’d like to go with Dean. If that’s alright.”
Exhausted from his feeble attempts at escape, Dean sunk back against the pillows with a grimace. Sammy clearly didn’t get it, so Dean tried to catch Cas’s eyes.
Sighing, Castiel adjusts his hands on the steering wheel. Snow has started to fall again.
“Of course,” he says, sounding fond and amused. “My mistake.”
Eileen smiles at him, weary but genuine, but then grimaces. “Heat is not my friend,” she says and signs, then presses the bottle against her neck and picks up the pamphlet again. Even her signing looks weary, her facial expressions a lot less animated than usual.
“Can I help?” She asks. “Charlie has found some kind of obscure artifact and Sam and Cas are geeking out over it. I think they didn’t even notice when I left,” she adds with an affectionate eye-roll.
Dean lies awake for a while around 3 am. They don’t talk—not with words, anyway. But their hands do—holding onto each other, drawing patterns onto the other’s skin. Even after Dean has fallen back asleep, every time Castiel shifts position Dean follows him. Castiel draws the thin blanket up higher over Dean’s back and moves his hand under Dean’s to still Dean’s searching fingers.
Jack watches them play for a moment.
Squeezing his eyes shut, Dean digs his nails into his palms and forces himself to think about upsetting things, like that spider that got into the shower room the other day. He’s so busy remembering the way Sam had mercilessly teased him after saving him from that disgusting thing—or saving the thing from Dean, because Dean was about to just shoot it, the tiles be damned—that he must miss Cas coming over because suddenly he’s right there, a hand on Dean’s shoulder, urgently saying Dean’s name.
“When you fell into the water I guess? Cas immediately left heaven so he could call me. I couldn’t answer because we were busy with you already by then, so I called him back while we drove to the hospital. Judging from what he said, you thought you were
"It's alright, Dean." To Sam, "Can you give us a moment?"
“I’m sorry, I—I have to go.” He rubs his forehead, frustrated with the situation and his own inability to find the right words. “It might be selfish of me, but please—please trust me on this, and stay home.”
He navigated through Netflix to find the western they'd started watching a few weeks ago.
“There’s still a lot of trust we need to rebuild. I understand why you’d be wary about sharing this. But, Dean,
Dean’s hope soars when Cas offers him a gentle smile, so it takes a moment for him to register what Cas is saying. “I should get back to my research.”
“Sure. You go grab the k-k-kid, I’m gonna get r-r-rid of th-this.” Dean holds up the empty juice cups, then stands to bring them to the trash.
“So, Molly, our contact, says about seventy people have disappeared over the last three months, all of them homeless,” Sam says, signing while he speaks. “ It’s been happening all over the city but only at night. Nothing left behind except the victims belongings, in some cases blood and signs of struggle, but even then so little that the local authorities aren’t taking it very seriously, they probably don’t care.”
“I think it’s a compliment,” Jack chimes in. He’s leaning against the barrister, wearing a baseball cap backwards and sipping on a juicebox. Dean gave him those, fussy and worried about sun exposure and dehydration. “On the plaque it says they’re very nurturing.”
It takes several long minutes, but the hot water finally calms Dean down some. Mammalian Diving Response, Sam had explained once. Dean doesn't much care why it works, just that it does.
“I’m gonna j-just—” He points a thumb behind himself, only realizing after the fact that the bathroom is on the other side of the room. And the goddamn blanket won’t get out of the way fast enough.
"Dean, no, we won't celebrate without you."
. After repeating that mantra a couple times, he can breathe easier. Tension leaves him that he wasn’t even aware he was holding.
“Ok-k-kay,” he grouses, rolling his eyes. “Can we go inside alread-d-dy? I’m hungry.”
Dean’s speaking slower on top of enunciating extra carefully, his breathing carefully measured so he doesn’t run out of breath towards the end of his sentences. It reigns in his stutter somewhat, and gives Eileen a chance to read his lips despite the remaining disfluency.
Castiel turns off the lights. He expects Dean to roll onto his side so he can be the “little spoon” and have his face be hidden. Instead, Dean pillows his head on Castiel’s belly and then gropes around until he finds his hand and holds it. Then he sighs, rubs his cheek against Castiel t-shirt and closes his eyes, the tension finally going out of him.
“No.”
His smile widening, Jack follows after Dean in a way that reminds Castiel of a little duckling hurrying after its mom. Between their last case, Castiel needing care and then Dean needing care, Jack hasn't had much opportunity for one-on-one time with Dean.
Castiel contemplates following them, but then he thinks that Dean has had the right instinct with reducing the level of attention.
Sam makes a choking noise. Dean swallows and looks at Cas only to discover he’s already looking at him. Heat rushes to his face and then they both look away quickly.
“Cas and Sam say you shouldn’t eat sweets before dinner.”
When he goes over to unlock the doors, he smoothes a hand over her roof in apology.
Sam’s standing next to Dean, a plate piled with ribs in his hands, the two of them ribbing each other as usual.
There are lots of pillows, the covers aren’t scratchy, everything is soft and both looks
, right fucking now. Dean’s mouth is dry, his skin is tingling with the need to touch and be touched, and he’s definitely starting to plump up in his jeans.
“Stop the c-c-car. Stop the car, 'm g-g-gonna—”
Cas squeezes Dean’s hand again. “Of course.” He moves to standing and Dean is ready to start moping because why wait with that until Cas is gone, and then Cas leans towards him once more and presses a kiss against his forehead.
The bunker is much livelier again but there’s also more boundaries—the living quarters and the kitchen are off limits. Everyone who comes in is allowed access to the war room, the library, and the infirmary. Dean had expected it to still irritate him—he’s protective and maybe a little bit territorial when it comes to his home—but hunters rarely get homes, and it does feel good to help shelter people. And even though Dean keeps himself to the sidelines and leaves the leading and organizing to Sam and Eileen, he’s still kept nicely busy—there’s always someone who shows up injured, or hungry, or in need of advice with a case.
For a drawn-out moment, nothing happens. Dean tries to keep an eye on all three of the mine shafts and the surrounding area, and with every passing minute he grows more tense. He’s starting to think that the thing either isn’t rising to their bait or it’s not a hide-behind at all, when he becomes aware of movement in the corner of his vision. He focuses on the shaft that’s on the very left, narrowing his eyes, and a shiver races down his spine.
“A-a-and you c-c-can’t w-w-watch my butt anym-m-more l-l-like this.”
Dean finally moves his cheek away from the wet spot then smashes it into Cas's chest again with a content sigh. Cas shifts like he’s putting away his phone and then a hand starts stroking Dean’s upper back between his shoulder blades, instantly turning him into goo again.
Their little bubble finally got broken by Sam walking into the Cave and then stopping short. “Hey, have you—oh. Oh crap, sorry guys.”
"It's not my fault this place is abominable," Castiel counters haughtily while he starts to put their items on the conveyor belt.
“D-d-don't mix the d-d-dirty stuff in with the c-c-clean,” he bickers.
“Nothing happened. Everyone was exceptionally kind to us. It was just—being confronted with all that sadness? That despair? All those people in front of the shelters, desperate for safety, for answers, receiving neither. It just made me feel angry, and then helpless. They’re starving while there is enough food, and they’ve become victims of monsters they would be safe from if only given a roof over their heads and a door to close. It made me—well, it made me really really mad.”
Cas sighs long-sufferingly but he opens his camera roll again. “You are incorrigible.”
Unshed tears of joy had been brimming on Dean's lower lids, and all Castiel had wanted was to comfort him, but he held himself back, knowing it wouldn't be welcome until later when they could have some privacy.
Dean doesn’t know when it happened, but his hands are now over Cas's hands on his face, keeping them from pulling away, even though Cas is making no move to do so.
Oh fuck no. Dean thinking Cas was rejecting his cookies hurt, but this praise thing might be worse. Cas is looking at Dean all fondly and almost awed, and it's super not okay.
Cas and Jack are playing Scrabble on one of the beds. Dean would ask where they got it from, except the motel probably provided it and also he doesn't care. Jack asks Dean to join, then looks absurdly guilty when he remembers why Dean can't. Dean just waves him off. He's tired and he wants to lie down, he just doesn't want to be alone.
“What is it now?”
“You l-l-listened to someone who rarely g-gets listened to. You m-m-made her
“—out of your
on the hike. And then he
“Let’s get this show on the road.”
On his next inhale, Dean hears himself sniffle, and okay, that's... that's just dumb; he can't be lying here crying about this. That's a level of pathetic he's not ready for. It's all fine. Dean's family is close, and they're okay, they're safe. Well, Dean doesn't know where Sam is. But Sam is smart, and he's armed, and he can't be too far away. Probably just having a beer and bitching to people about his dumb older brother. He's okay. Everything's okay.
“Hey, Cas?”
"My phone's a-a-at home.” The plastic of the icing package crinkles where Dean is clutching it too tightly in his ire. “It's
w-won’t b-be c-c-coming-g-g b-b-back.”
Dean scowls. Cas looks up from where he’s fiddling with his phone and sighs.
A while ago, Dean had started complaining about Castiel's clothes not being comfortable enough for cuddling and had not stopped until Castiel gave in. Now, he owns two pairs of hoodies and sweatpants and a couple of soft t-shirts, and has to admit that they are nice to lounge in.
Checking his watch, Dean sees it’s past lunchtime and now that he thinks about it, he’s starving.
Finally, Castiel relents and eats, if only so Dean can start eating himself. With a huff, Dean picks up his own bowl, and then throws the TV remote to Castiel. He doesn't seem to care what they watch, which is more than unusual.
Dean’s hands aren’t visibly shaking, but Castiel can still feel the way they tremble when Dean cups his face and steals a kiss while everyone else is busy with clean-up. There’s still a glaze over his eyes and dark shadows under them.
Still perched on Cas's illegally thick thighs, Dean scoots forward to press his growing bulge against Cas's crotch, making both of them gasp.
“Mosty fine but I think he sprained his wrist when he fell.”
“Th-this h-h-has g-g-got t-to be a g-g-give a-a-and t-t-take. D-d-don’t sh-sh-shut me out. Pl-l-lease.”
“Good. Now fuck off, I gotta prep dinner and I don’t want your stupid hair to end up in the sauce.”
Turning to look at the trees where the koalas are hanging out, Cas reaches out a hand to rub Dean’s back where he’s sitting in his wheelchair. “You like them?”
“Dean? Are you ready to keep going?”
From his periphery, he can see Sam nodding and leaving. Dean's shoulders slump and he scrubs his hands over his face, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Instantly, Cas withdraws his hands. Dean’s heart feels like it breaks.
Cas has stopped rocking them but he keeps up the soothing motion of his hand.
When he draws back from the hug, Cas checks him over, stroking a gentle hand over a band aid covering a bruise on Dean's arm. Then he looks up and searches Dean's eyes.
“I will.”
“Alright,” Cas says, sounding relieved. “Thank you.”
Since he’s alone now, he can’t go in, so he contends himself with sitting down at the edge and watching the water. He just needs to calm down a little, then he can go sleep.
Not knowing where to put his hands, Castiel has rested them on the edge of the tub, but Dean has other ideas. "I'm
There’s that urge, immediately, to shy away and say something self-deprecating. Dean fights it down and Cas squeezes his hand, like he’s able to sense Dean’s internal struggle, or at least how much the words are affecting him.
. So feeling-g-g h-h-heard, I c-c-can’t tell you how rel-l-lieving that is.”
“Stop complaining. That sunrise was very beautiful.”
It’s the best he’s going to get right now, so Dean takes it. He roots around for Cas's other hand and puts it back on his head, wriggling on the bed to get comfortable again..
Dean goes through his nighttime routine and when he’s lying down in bed, he tugs at Castiel’s sleeve. Shedding most of his layers, Castiel slides down beside Dean under the covers. He finds Dean's hand, stroking over his knuckles until he's asleep.
“This won’t help,” Castiel proclaims even as he does as Dean’s suggested, taking his shirt off and lying down. “I need to move. I feel much better already.”
“Dean. Are you saying—”
"Public bathrooms a-a-are gross, Cas. They're a petri d-d-dish."
“Bedtime?”
body from the water and have
“I’m scared, Dean. If I were to die now, I’d die an angel, and that means going back to the Empty. The thought of being trapped in that place again, with
When Castiel turns to him, Dean seems tense and withdrawn where he was so openly emotional before. It’s not unusual for Dean to retreat into his protective shell, though Castiel suspects it has less to do with his outburst, and more with what they’re about to do—while Dean swims in the bunker’s pool a lot, the ocean is a much less controlled environment.
Whatever.
“Mm-hm,” Dean agrees, then snuggles his head back into the pillow. “Just restin’ my eyes.”
“What about Dean and Jack?” Mary asks softly.
Dean loses himself in the peace of it all, and so it takes him a while to realize Cas is watching him.
“It’s alright, Sam,” Cas had said. “What do you need?”
Slowly, the tide of panic ebbs and his heart slows and he can breathe again. In its wake though, he feels like there’s a layer of grime all over him.
With an adoring sigh, Castiel reaches up to brush a few crumbs away from the corners of Dean's mouth before they can fall down onto the covers and inevitably make Dean complain later. "Good?"
The engine starts instantly, purring healthily instead of sputtering and dying.
Dean’s expression morphs into a pout and then turns into genuine upset. “Dun w-w-wanna. ‘S all da-da-dark. L-l-like with… l-l-like M-M-Michael.”
The next one looks like Elsa from Frozen. He wonders if Maggie made it, but has scarce time to appreciate the artistry when his attention is drawn to the last two snowmen.
“Hey th-there, hand-d-dso-so-some.”
Of course, that couldn’t last. The more Dean’s mind and body recovered, the more it
“Alright.”
“C’mon,” he says, “I’ll do the choo choo train.”
to him. Endearingly, Dean blushes and ducks his head.
“I’ve been worried. About you. But I don’t want to sound ungrateful, so I don’t quite know how to say this... “ Cas looks torn, so Dean takes his hand. Gives it a reassuring squeeze. Cas takes a breath.
Dean leans over and gives Cas a quick kiss.
Reaching for him, Castiel cups Dean’s face in one hand, waiting patiently until Dean is ready to meet his eyes. Stroking a tear away with his thumb, Castiel says, into the scant space between them, “I’m here, Dean. I will always be here.”
that Dean can’t say out loud but that Castiel hears anyway. He squeezes Dean’s fingers in return, letting him know that he’s being understood.
"How bad is it? Have you slept at all since we left?"
you. So why don’t you hang on and enjoy the
Dean had offered to help with research, if only to speed things along. But when even that got him only three seconds of attention from Cas—the time it took Cas to look up and say "I suppose you could read over this lore again, see if we missed something "—Dean had pretended to look up stuff for a while and then decided to sulk instead.
He can see the war in Dean wage on for another moment, but then Dean nods, sagging. Castiel gives him a gentle push towards the door, and then goes to help carry the fold-up chairs and tables back inside.
Smiling to himself—Dean really is an angry sleeper—Castiel uses the opportunity to clean up and polish his find in the bathroom sink. When he’s done, he’s filled with a sense of accomplishment but also realizes he’s nervous. But why? It’s just a whimsical gift, nothing more. Surely there’s no reason for him to feel like it means something more.
“Ursa Major—the Great Bear. Home of the what you now call the Big Dipper, though it has had many names, most of them long forgotten. Since the beginning of mankind, it has been used for navigation.”
"Have you eaten today?"
When Dean exits the bathroom, he's already in sleep clothes. When he sees the nondescript paperbag sitting on his side of the bed, he frowns.
Heart pounding, Dean takes a breath. "Kinda—kinda thought just you 'n me." Somehow, the dish towel has ended up in his hands again. His fingers are twisting it anxiously and Dean can only hope he doesn’t look as messy as he feels. "Been a while since we talked and stuff and—yeah. Be good to do that. Talk. And stuff."
Sam and Cas were hovering over him. Dean tried to say that he was okay and sent himself coughing instead. Carefully, Sam helped him sit up. Cas came to stand in front of him and Dean caught sight of the syringe, almost filled to the brim with swirling, glowing grace. The sight made Dean shiver. This had been inside of him the entire time, doing fuck knows what.
“Dean, it’s not your fault what he did. No one blames you.” Cas has told him this before. The others have too. “I promise you he’s gone,” Cas adds when Dean doesn’t say anything. “He’s gone and he can’t hurt anyone ever again.”
Even though they definitely need the assistance of every single hunter that came with them, Castiel is immensely grateful that Dean had offered to stay behind with Jack. In this extreme frenzy, Castiel doubts any of them would have been able to keep an eye on Jack, and the high-stress level of the situation would very likely have had negatively affected Dean’s health.
Dean just nods and then winces, because even that little movement was too much. Fucking fantastic. He grins wryly. “L-l-looks l-l-like you're in l-l-luck and get to d-d-drive tomor-r-r—” He blocks on the last word, throat muscles spasming, and doesn't bother finishing it.
“How about you?” Sam asks, like he has no idea about how that’s Dean’s least favorite topic. “How are things going? I’ve been so busy, I feel like we haven’t really talked in weeks.”
"I like to think that Kelly would be happy. Proud. Jack had such a rough start to life and when I was back from the Empty, I realized I had no idea how to raise him, how to make it better. But now..." He trails off, unable to find words for what he's feeling.
They’ve been away from the bunker for four days, partly because it was a long drive, but also because they, as Dean would say it, took “the scenic route” back. As Eileen’s birthday is coming up soon, Jack wanted to look for a present for her, and Castiel was happy to indulge him. He even used the opportunity to do a little gift-shopping for someone else, the result of which he is now carrying in an inconspicuous looking paper bag.
Now, Dean’s in his Cave—he’d meant to go watch something but found himself unable to settle on anything. He’s been kind of just sitting in the armchair, staring at the huge black screen of the TV.
this one is for Liv (@curioussubjects) because she gave me the idea for it :)
Cas sighs and strokes his fingers through Dean’s hair as if it’s calming him too.
, hadn’t known what roofies looked like. It had taken a while for Dean to stop beating himself up over that.
After throwing the blanket over them both, Dean tangles their legs together and tucks himself close, searching for Castiel's hand. He grips it tightly when he finds it and then settles, his breath warming the skin over Castiel's heart.
It’s fully dark the next time he wakes, but the curtains are drawn to the side to let the moonlight in. There’s a nice cool breeze coming in through the tilted window and Dean can see a few stars. He’s lying curled up against Cas with his head on his thigh while Cas is leaning against the headboard, a hand resting on the curve of Dean’s side.
He's gone so fast Dean doesn't even have time to tell him to clean up after himself.
That realization brings a fresh wave of emotion, and the next thing he knows he’s in his room, sitting on his bed. He wrings his shaking hands, trying to keep it together.
“It is important, that’s true,” Cas agrees. Then he looks down and doesn’t continue until Dean meets his eyes. “But what’s even more important to me is
Dean’s eyes are burning and not with fatigue. Rolling onto his other side so his back is to Cas, he holds his breath and bites his lip until the tide of sadness and shame settles. He curls his fingers into the cold sheets and clings so tightly his joints ache.
“You should also have some vegetables, Dean.”
Dean shifts in place, embarrassed, but manages a quiet, “Yeah.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Yes, Dean, you’ve said. And I’m not planning to.”
“Four in the morning. And I was just dreaming about spending a nice day at a farmer's market, so thanks for that.” Dean head is starting to seriously hurt, but he's still hit by a rush of affection for his little brother, who's trying to soothe him with humor.
If Jack had asked Dean about stuff like history or literature, he’d probably have pointed him to someone else, but math? Math Dean can do.
Okay, that’s… Dean doesn’t know. ‘Talking’ could still mean break-up.
Dean can reheat his own damn food. He
His irritation must show on his face, because Dean huffs out a breath of laughter and reaches up to playfully attempt to smoothe Castiel’s frown away.
Dean hasn’t seen Cas all day. He was gone when Dean woke up in the morning, left at some point during the night to give Dean the “space” he’d asked for.
He walks over to Dean, who's still bent over and apparently busy decorating his own cookies. Dean's giggling to himself and the mirth in his expression makes him look about two decades younger. When Castiel gets close enough to make out the shape of the cookies, he realizes why.
you. But now? I’ll let you stay
"What's that?"
It’s a sensor that detects possible convulsive seizures and sends alerts to the phones it’s paired with. It provides GPS too, and it’s waterproof, and there’s an App that—”
“Shaddup. Be nice to ‘er, she’s been workin' hard.”
“Should-d-d just use Sam’s.” Dean scowls at the notebook page with the neatly written block letters. “Least it don’t look l-l-like some k-k-kinderga-ga-gartner wrote it.”
Cas just smiles at him, like he knows what it means too. And Dean doesn’t know what’s on his face but it makes Cas lean forward and then they’re kissing so gently, it almost hurts in way that Dean never believed he’d get to ever experience.
When he enters the kitchen, Dean's greeted by the sight of Cas and Sam at the table. There's a  half-empty coffee mug dangerously perched by Sam's elbow, and he's got his laptop in front of him while Cas is dicking around on his phone.
Sam just keeps frowning and then steamrolls right over them, “I got a call earlier. Apparently over seventy people have gone missing in San Diego over the last three months or so, all of them homeless. No bodies, no demon activity. The woman who called me, Molly, used to be a hunter herself. When she got wind of our network, she reached out. Mom and Bobby are still busy with that vetala case, so. I say we go check this out.”
“S-s-save y-your m-m-moj-j-jo. ‘S j-just sc-c-crapes.”
in there, I
“I remember what it was like, alone on the streets, and I was a lot luckier than most of them. I just wished I could do more.”
Dean's been avoiding asking for this, trying to bear the pain for as long as he is able. The feeling of Grace flooding into him, taking away control, just brings back too many bad memories. But he's past his limit now.
, and strong. And also
There it is though—the sad teddy bear. Dean sighs and scoots backwards to one side of the bed.
“Mm-hm?”
Dean, who hoards more food than he could ever eat, and all the soft bedding he can find. Who starts missing his home, his
He expects Cas to be in the library, but he's not, so Dean goes to check the kitchen next. Except, when he gets close, he hears voices. It somehow hadn't even occurred to him that Sam might already be up as well.
Cas nods sagely. “Hamsters are hard-wired to forage for food and hoard it. And also to nest-build. However, if given the wrong materials for that they can injure themselves severely. Dean got his foot caught in his blanket nest this morning and almost fell flat on his face.”
Dean wants to ask
Kids are the worst. Dean stomps the rest of the way to the car, scowling at everyone and everything in an attempt to regain at least a little bit of dignity. All the while, his traitor brain whispers to him that, seriously, what could Jack have said that would have been better? Best friend wouldn’t have been a lie exactly, but that’s not all they are anymore. Boyfriend is something for teenagers and the mere idea of calling Cas that makes Dean cringe. Partner is close, but it sounds too casual. Lots of people are partners in some way and don’t kiss. Significant other sounds clinical and stupid.
He always urges Dean to focus on and find joy in the things he
"It has been a lot," Cas agrees. It's such a Cas thing to say that under different circumstances it might have made Dean smile. Now, he can only manage a nod.
Leaning his head on her roof, Dean sinks against Baby with a groan.
Remembering his earlier conversation with Sam, Castiel asks, “What are we watching tonight?”
“Ew, fuck you, I’m leaving—”
“I'll draw you a bath when we’re home.”
"How'd it g-g-go?" Dean asks as Castiel sits down on the bed. "You guys ca-ca-catch th-the evil g-g-ghostie?" He's still smiling, but his hands are fidgeting nervously in his lap. There are extra blankets on their bed, and Dean’s wearing comfort clothes—hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks.
"Hey, what's up?" Dean hasn't seen much of Cas—he's still busy with whatever super secret thing he and Jack are up to in heaven. Cas has sworn that they'll return once they're done, and Dean still doesn't like it but at least it has made this whole thing—the hiding—easier.
It's silent, and when Dean finally lifts his head, Cas is looking the way Sam left with a frown of annoyance.
Dean's sipping on his coffee without looking up, seeming to try and hide behind his mug.
Panicked and confused, nothing really registered with Dean except ‘still inside of you’.
Dean tried to roll over in bed to try and get up, and for some reason that only made the yelling worse.
The blanket that Dean had wrapped around himself in addition to the thick coat he’s wearing has slipped off his shoulders a little. “It’s a beautiful night,” Castiel answers, fussing with the blanket and tucking it back in place.
On the way out, Cas squeezes his shoulder. His palm is as warm and broad as ever, the touch
Cas huffs. “I’m aware.”
Dean tenses at that, worry growing. “You th-think he’s hurting-g-g himself ag-gain?”
With a defeated sigh, Castiel sits down beside Eileen and puts his head in his hands.
, oh fuck, Dean needs to stop thinking about Cas's, well,
As he makes his way down the stairs, he feels relieved to be back home. The bunker is familiar, and safe, and he has missed the rest of his family.
“Lie d-d-down for a bit ‘n cuddle?” Dean requests when Castiel asks what he wants to do next.
When they step back, Dean's so embarrassed, he can barely meet Cas's eyes. There's a beat, and then Cas says, softly, "Sleep well."
Castiel does trust Sam, so he takes the plushie with him to the register. After paying, Sam offers to hide it in his backpack, so Castiel can give it to Dean in private later.
Predictably, Sam needed Cas’s help with something boring.
When the others descend the hill Dean makes to follow but notices that Cas has lingered, head tipped back, staring upwards.
"What's wrong?" He enters the kitchen and hovers beside Castiel, looking suspiciously between him and Sam like he thinks Sam did something to upset him.
“I h-h-hate you g-g-guys.”
They'd already brought most of the dishes down earlier to free up the tables, so now it's mostly bottles that need to be brought in for recycling. Castiel had hoped that Dean was allowing himself the rest he was clearly in need of, but instead he finds him at the kitchen sink, scrubbing away.
Eileen chimes in with, “Maybe try a bath. We bought Epsom bath salt. You can say you stole it from us, he’ll like that.”
Dean isn’t ready for it yet, but that’s okay.
“You know he sang the song like that to make fun of his speech impaired brother, right?”
Jack looks excited at the idea, but he’s quiet while they walk, a troubled frown on his face. It lifts only slightly when the water comes into view.
Sam shrugs, and then drags a chair over so he can sit at Castiel’s side. He offers him a smile. “Yeah, but if I lie down now it will just mess up my sleep schedule.” He grabs the remote. “Want to watch something? Eileen’s skyping with a friend and Jack’s playing a video game. I’m bored, you’d be doing me a favor.”
“I am. I’m very—” He leans over and kisses Dean’s forehead. “Very happy, and very grateful.”
“I see you survived cooking and eating the soup,” Castiel teases, forcing himself to focus on a more entertaining topic.
Cas finally sets his phone down. “Of course,” he says, sounding far too serious, but the affirmation still soothes Dean’s stupid separation anxiety.
Faint chuckling. “It's a roller coaster, Cas.”
"Right n-n-now we got ev-v-veryone in one pl-l-lace for once," Dean argues. "That won't l-l-last. This cra-a-ap show c-c-could take days. If you guys w-w-wait any longer t-t-to have C-C-Christmas, it's gonna be the next ye-ye-year." Castiel can see Dean’s throat muscles jump from the over-exertion. He shouldn’t be talking this much.
Dean can feel himself flush. “No,” he says, shifting on the bed, and okay, at least things have calmed down downstairs. “No, I was just thinking-g-g ab-bout, uh. Spiders.”
Humming in reply, Castiel thinks about how to explain.
When Jack opens Castiel's present, he's quiet for a long moment, fingers stroking reverently over the photos. Sam and Eileen got him a hunter's journal and a new Zelda game. When Jack opens Dean's present and reads the card, his brow furrows with confusion.
Over the course of the night, Castiel doesn't quite sleep, but he definitely isn't awake most of the time either. He notices when Dean gets up to use the bathroom, and when he tucks himself closer again after having shifted away in his sleep. When Dean gets restless with bad dreams, Castiel wakes enough to stroke over Dean's chest until he calms again, and then he dozes off like that, his hand being lifted up and down in time with Dean's slow breaths.
Smoke was billowing high in the sky, and Dean really wanted to be there for Sammy, but finally another dizzy spell forced him to his knees. He’d probably have fallen headfirst into the mud if Cas hadn’t suddenly been there, hadn’t steadied him and cupped his face.
Finally remembering that he has arms, Castiel wraps them around Dean in return and rubs a hand over his back.
“It’s alright. I was a little concerned though. Has this happened to you before?”
“Hello, Dean.”
. What the fuck. They saw each other an hour ago. He can’t actually miss Cas already, or expect Cas to miss him. That’s dumb, it’s just… dumb.
When he’s done, he doesn’t quite know what to do with himself. Sam recommended him a meditation app but he’s found it isn’t for him. He doesn’t feel like reading or watching or listening to anything.
“We’re very sorry to hear that,” Jack is saying, genuine regret in his voice.
Dean starts to answer but then seems to choke, "Gonna—"
“I’d like to help too,” Jack says, closing the book he’s been reading and setting it aside.
Dean pulls the blanket tighter around himself. Why isn't Cas cuddling him? That's not okay!
“Hey, you know m-me. A-a-any chance I get t-to b-b-bow out of res-s-search, I’m g-g-g-game.”
“Thank you again for your advice, both of you. Dean was quite thrilled with the Epsom salt.”
“Been b-b-b-better,” Dean rasps. He's leaning against the headboard again, because lying down completely flat makes the pounding in his temples worse.
“Good idea. I want out of this suit.” Eileen grimaces and picks at her blouse with a frown.
"Fine", Castiel growls. Putting a divider down, he demonstratively turns his back to Dean.
He gets ready for bed, though he fully intends to wait up for Cas. Leaving the door ajar and the lamp on the bedside table on, he lies down and waits.
Dean does. He’s soaking wet by the end, but his mind is calm and his hands are steady. And Baby’s clean and gleaming inside and out.
Seashells and flowers.
Dean’s fingers dig into the skin right under the scar left by the spear, but he manages to hold back and not hurt himself.
It’s still early, and he’s only in jeans and a tee, but it’s already too warm for his liking. The upside is he gets to drive Baby with the windows down. Jack sits shotgun, content to look outside and watch the streets pass by, and it’s still a little weird to be alone with him. The kid is much closer to Sam and Cas, but then again, he
"I can watch it with you," Cas says when they've all filed out, rubbing Dean's back soothingly.
You guys got parking lot married like a
Dean sits down beside Cas, close enough their elbows are brushing. At one point, Cas stretches so that his arm is behind Dean, and Dean tries to play it cool because surely Cas is going to lay his arm around him now, all nice and heavy and warm, and—
"He also—he made me realize why Jack's birthday coming up is causing you so much stress." Now, Dean tenses all down his body. Castiel strokes his back soothingly with his thumb where he's still resting his hand. "And Dean, if it's too hard, you don't have to be there. We'll understand. But Sam thinks it will be good for you to be there, and I agree. It's—"
do is rest. Like taking a nap after lunch, instead of joining us for research.”
“He said it made him able to poop really well.”
He fumbles with the coffee machine, keeping his back to everyone. The machine is loud enough that he can't really hear what the others are talking about. From what he does catch, it sounds like they're going over the whole Grigori thing again.
“Right.”
“A-a-and I guess th-that’s k-k-kinda what I w-w-was l-l-like f-f-for S-S-Sam too. Somet-t-times I w-w-was his broth-ther. Oth-ther t-times—” Dean’s throat clicks audibly as he tries to get the words out and blocks hard.
Dean wanted to, he did, but he couldn’t. From far away, he watched himself yell and fight and kick out his legs until finally, Cas reached for him—”I’m sorry, Dean”—and then it all went black.
” Eileen says, and both Sam and Castiel groan.
"That's not very nice, Dean," Cas chides him mildly, but Dean can hear the smile in his voice.
“I didn’t mean for this to happen. It was a miscalculation.”
“Y'know, th-there's
Castiel can see that Sam argues back and forth with himself about this for a few seconds, but then he nods decisively. “We’ll keep you up to date. Everyone else, let’s go.”
Insecure, he searches Cas's eyes, but all he finds there is want and boundless acceptance. Kissing him again, the rhythm of Dean’s hips falters at the feeling of Cas's deft hands stroking down Dean’s back and up his chest, thumbs experimentally brushing his nipples. Dean breaks away from the kiss with a moan and starts fumbling with the buttons on Cas's shirt, “C’mon, you t-t-too.”
Dean narrows his eyes at him, but they’re drawing moisture even in the half-dark of the room and it makes him look more upset than suspicious.
When Castiel enters, he looks up briefly and then away, mouth turned down unhappily.
Warm, hitched breaths puff wetly against Dean’s chest. At his back, he can feel the kid’s fingers tremble.
Jack hastily escapes to his room to hide his present while Castiel walks on to the library. Sam is there with a couple of his hunters, but it looks like they’ve already wrapped up their meeting and are just hanging out now.
He has to hang up before he can hear Dean’s reply, forcing his mind to focus on Sam as he rapidly shares the newest developments.
“Of course not, Dean.”
Dean shrugs with one shoulder, of half a mind to wave away the concern. It’s still a battle, sometimes, to let others take care of him and not give in to that part of him that screams it should only ever be the other way around.
“Dean—”
"I had always suspected it, but now that you’ve been given the opportunity—you're an admirable family man, Dean."
Though the ingredients are simple, the spellwork is intricate. It's obvious that a lot of thought and care went into crafting it, and Castiel makes a mental note to thank Rowena personally. Still—
That makes Dean
Settling back down, Castiel puts an arm around Dean. “I apologize,” he says, endeared at how serious Dean is taking this. Unable to keep from teasing him a little, he adds, “I didn’t know romance came before personal hygiene.”
Or maybe Dean did something?
Dean holds up a hand. “C-c-can we t-t-talk ab-b-bout th-this when my b-b-brain's n-not t-t-tryin' to l-l-leak out through my ears? A-a-and th-this,” he gestures at his mouth, “isn’t a-a-acting up as m-m-much? Please.”
“Uuuuh.” Dean realizes he’s still worrying at the dish towel and chucks it to the side. “No? No, I mean, yeah. He was here, but then he said he was gonna go take a nap.” He shrugs and offers Cas what he hopes looks like a perfectly clueless, innocent smile. “You want a beer? Coffee?”
Great. Not only is he being stupid, he probably looked stupid just now too.
The motions of Dean’s fingers are slowing down as he’s falling back asleep. Maybe Dean will be cross with him later, but right now Castiel is glad that Dean is in no position to notice his meltdown. It gives him time to sort through the various emotions, to just feel them for a while until he has to think about how to share them with Dean without causing him guilt in some way.
“I was hoping you wouldn’t notice.”
Usually with them, it’s the other way around; Dean complaining about an ache in his neck or shoulders or back, and then becoming putty the moment Castiel puts his hands on him. It’s not that Dean’s never done this for him, but Castiel usually doesn’t get backaches, so it’s more been a kind of foreplay for them.
Shuffling over to the sink, he scrubs his hands and face clean, and refuses to look at his bedhead and likely disgruntled expression.
Dean still prefers to keep himself to the background when the hunters from the apocalypse world are concerned, though Castiel isn’t quite sure why. Dean seems careful not to accidentally undermine Sam's authority where they are concerned. It also wouldn’t surprise Castiel if the trauma of watching Sam die in the apocalypse world still strongly affected Dean.
Normally, the sight would make Dean feel like a proud parent and brother, but right now—
Dean grumbles but has to direct too much attention on his footing again to be able to complain about Cas's lack of appreciation.
The ground seems to shake as someone gets up and walks away. Dean can open his eyes now, but it takes another moment for them to focus. He’s lying in the recovery position and his head is pillowed on something soft. Eileen comes into view.
Cas is so earnest and apologetic about it that now guilt joins the shame party that's making Dean's guts feel heavy and sour.
“What? W-w-why?”
Castiel wants to say that he can't rest while Dean's in pain, but he stops himself when he realizes that that would only cause Dean to feel guilty for his emotions. He can't think of what the right thing to say would be either though. His body aches all over and he just wants to lie back and close his eyes, but not like this.
Dean shakes his head, avoiding Cas’s eyes. "Nah, m’good."
Dean rubs at his forehead and shrugs, suddenly feeling incredibly tired.
Dean glares after Sam until he's out the door, then turns worried eyes on Castiel.
“...Goddammit.”
He can feel Cas shake his head. “It’s not your fault, Dean.”
Dean's about to get up and start with clean-up when Cas stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
The silvery hint of light at the horizon is turning to molten gold. Above them, the sky is still a dark blue, a handful of stars visible. Beside him, Dean shivers.
Dean searches her eyes. He sees nothing but sincerity and compassion. Still, he spooks. Keeping his gaze on the soup he’s stirring, he shrugs one shoulder.
Shutting off the bedside lamp, Castiel lies down on his back and stares at the dark ceiling. He tries not to think about anything, but it feels like he ends up thinking about everything instead.
. Everybody’s scared they or their friends are next. I’ve been trying to set up some kind of network, but it’s hard to keep track of people out there. Far as I know, we got 79 people missing in the last three and a half months, but I’m sure it’s more.”
Jack is watching the waves when Dean gets back. After plopping down next to him, Dean unceremoniously puts the cap on the kid’s head and holds his juice out to him.
Clearing his throat and avoiding Cas's eyes, Dean tries to think of a way to explain this that won’t make him sound like a needy moron. He’s saved from having to come up with anything by a knock on the door.
While they talked, a couple of teenagers have set up a beach volleyball net and started playing. If Jack were a normal human kid, he’d be around their age. And what do you know, they’re short a player.
Dean had wanted to yell that no fucking deep breathing exercise would fix his broken mouth, that some things just plain do not get better, they get worse. But Sam didn’t deserve to take the brunt of Dean’s frustration, so he swallowed all of that back.
He shrugs, “Always kinda did. They look cuddly, like tiny little bears.”
Sliding his hands down Dean’s back to settle on his hips, Cas looks up at him all smug.
“It doesn’t matter to us what you can and can’t do,” he said. “We’re still gonna want you here and we’re still going to be there. Okay?”
Pushing his sleep mask back up, Dean moves his head so he can squint up at him.
“You're looking better, did you finally sleep?” Sam asks when the food is ready and Dean has sat down to join them.
Glaring up at him, Cas looks decidedly grumpy at the interruption.
Dean doesn’t fucking care about what crawled up the guy’s butt and died though. There’s a job to be done—a job Dean can still do just fine, thank you very much—and he’s damn well gonna do it.
Sneaking up behind him, Sam steals a chocolate chip off of one of the cookies before Dean can slap his hand away. Fucking hell but kids are the worst. How did Dean end up with
Jack is holding a stack of papers and a pencil and looks frustrated.
Dean doesn’t know if he can do that, but “Yeah, ok-k-kay. I’ll t-t-try.”
Whatever ‘talking’ means, Dean’s got to face it eventually. He’s still mostly a coward though, so he texts Cas
“Stupid honeymooners,” Dean grumbles and then decides to soothe himself with his ice cream. Stupid little brother. Stupid sister-in-law. And stupid husband-who-should-always-be-on-Dean’s-side who started it all.
“Dean? Dean!”
Dean frowns, instantly worried. “You okay?”
“Everyone’s fine, it’s been pretty quiet,” Sam says with a shrug and a smile, a carefully neutral expression on his face.
Cas takes his hand off Dean's head, and,
Oblivious at the tension, Jack beams at her and signs something without speaking. She looks delighted, laughing and signing something back. Cas is smiling at their antics, but he glances at Dean when Dean shuffles, overcome by frustration again. Longing for comfort and understanding, Dean almost physically aches with how much he wants Cas to rub his back or take his hand. Then he realizes how ridiculous and needy he’s being and tries to squash those thoughts the best he can.
“Yeah, well… he’s right. Just needed some sleep.” Dean offers Jack a reassuring smile but the kid still looks uncertain. Dean sighs. “Jack… it’s not your job to worry about me. I’ve got Sam and Eileen and Cas looking after me. You trust them to do a good job, right?”
Despite his own words, they’ve barely stepped out the diner when Dean changes his mind. “You know what? The oth-thers are gonna be a wh-while. Let’s go hang-g-g-g out at th-the beach while we w-w-w-wait.”
And there, sitting on the bench and fixing Castiel with a death glare, is Dean.
“...’kay.” Dean sounds a little taken aback. “But if—”
It's not a lot and mostly watery. When it's over, Castiel helps him take a sip from the glass so he can rinse out his mouth.
He hears Sam pad around the room but doesn't dare open his eyes. Even the little bit of light filtering through the thick curtains is too much.
In retrospect, he was kind of proud of that comeback, especially seeing how angry it had seemed to make Chuck.
“I c-c-can’t—” He clammed up again, flinching away from the sound of his own voice. Cas squeezed his shoulder in silent encouragement.
. Ok-k-kay," Dean stammers, embarrassed.
"Th-th-they fou-fou-fought d-d-dirty," Dean complains, though he sounds more proud than annoyed. Then he nudges Castiel's shoulder and winks at him. "You w-w-wanna stay here a-a-and help me ha-ha-handle these pricks?"
Curling up on his side and closing his eyes, he tries his best to ignore it. To keep breathing evenly, and to not think about anything. The hollowness hurts in that way that starvation hurts—urgently and desperately. Dean curls his hands into loose fists and shuts his eyes tighter against the prickling heat behind them.
Drawing back from where he’s been leaving little nibbling kisses down the line of Cas's throat, Dean forces himself to concentrate for a moment.
The snow in the woods is piled high enough that judging the ground beneath can be tricky, and Jules has broken her foot. Healing it drains Castiel's Grace to the point where he has to sit down and catch his breath.
"Those are mi-mi-mine!"
Dean spits the water in the bucket and then lies his head back down on the pillow, panting.
They’ve done this enough times by now that Dean is no longer embarrassed by having to sit down and lean on Cas while he urinates, and then having to be steadied while he washes his hands after. Castiel has discovered that when he simply does what is necessary without hesitating, Dean will calm down and that, in turn, will calm Castiel himself.
Cas is looking down at him with a frown, then makes sure he’s got Eileen’s attention as well.
The movie had long since ended, but Dean could hear Cas shift and pick something up, and then another western started, the volume on low. Right, it was probably boring for Cas to sit there with Dean draped over him asleep and drooling. No reason to think Cas remembered that Dean sometimes slept better with the TV in the background.
“We d-d-d-didn't even d-do anyth-th-th-thing!”
Dean searches his eyes, his own big and vulnerable. At least some of what Castiel is feeling must translate through the way he’s looking at Dean, because a flush appears on Dean’s cheeks. Shifting his stance, Dean turns his face away, blinking rapidly.
You’ll fit right in with Sam’s girlfriend then.”
“I know,” Cas says, looking at him fondly. “But what you
Panting heavily and sagging against the rough stone, Dean’s heart almost sets out when, in the flickering, dim light, he sees one of the things climbing up the wall and making to attack Sam from behind while he’s locked in a fight with one of its siblings. Before he can even yell a warning, Eileen has already noticed the danger, is dragging the thing back down by its leg.
“And I’m glad I could help you set up this room. You’ve made a very nice home for yourself.”
“I know how to pack a bag, Dean.”
It feels kind of unfair to Sam, for Dean to be sitting here rubbing elbows with Cas when Eileen’s just left. Not that Dean doesn’t think she’ll be back—the girl’s tough as nails. It sucks, though. Dean likes her, and she makes Sam happy.
He falls quiet. Even without looking in the rearview mirror, Castiel can tell that Mary’s looking at him, that she’s been listening intently.
At some point, he must fall asleep or something close to it, because the next thing he knows Dean is gently wiping the excess oil off his back and shoulders with a towel. The mattress dips as he moves, and then the blanket is being tucked around Castiel again. “I’m not tired,” Castiel says, but his voice comes out more breathy and sleepy than annoyed.
“A little past three.”
He’s shivering. It takes him a bit to realize it’s getting worse because he’s still in his wet clothes.
Eileen, their relationship.” He pauses. “About me, and about asking too much of me. And I’m scared that you’re exhausting yourself. That you’re giving too much of yourself,
Dean's face twists unhappily, and Castiel suddenly realizes where he was going with this.
. So tell m-me what's w-w-wrong with y-you alread-d-dy!”
There’s a smile in her voice, and she sounds like she knows something he doesn’t. When he asks, she just laughs lightly.
“C-C-Cas—”
The realization about how different his life was going to be from now on only set in slowly—he couldn’t drive on his own like this. He couldn’t hunt. He couldn’t fight. How was he going to protect his family from now on? Though, with Jack dead and Cas having left, his family really only was Sam.
Eileen nods. “Is there a reason for it? Do you know?”
Alone together in the Cave, Cas cupped Dean’s face in one hand, one thumb stroking the skin under Dean’s eye. Even that soft touch was almost too much already, sending Dean’s heart racing and his skin prickling. Dean didn’t know what to do with his own hands and felt like the clumsiest person alive. Like he was going to fall apart any moment because he’d been wanting this so long.
will give up and crawl back inside Dean, let him fall asleep—but then show Dean its memories in his dreams. Memories of Dean’s body moving on its own. Walking around—dressed up fancy like a doll. People looking into his eyes, not realizing that it’s not Dean who’s staring back. Hands, hands reaching for him, caressing his shoulders, his back—
Dean looks down at himself and at his outfit illuminated by the glow stick resting on his chest.
“You’re not th-the one spend-d-ding hours c-c-cleaning her up ag-g-gain aft-t-ter.”
you before we l-l-left."
Castiel uses the opportunity to put a bit of water inside the shell for the flowers. There’s a little table right next to the glass doors that lead to the small balcony, and he puts the shell there. The light breeze coming in through the half-open doors jostles the flowers lightly and spreads their scent around in the room.
"It's okay, Dean," he says, but Dean shakes his head.
He doesn't want to say he is when he's not.
“Hey,” he says, voice soft and low. “No one’s t-t-takin’ me aw-w-way ag-g-g-ain.”
“They’re worried about you, though.”
Dean gapes at him. “Seriousl-l-ly?!”
Dean taps the voice message icon.
“D-did… did we just get m-m-m-married in a motel parking l-l-lot?”
Judging by how little light is filtering through the blinds, it’s getting dark again the next time Dean wakes up for real. The pounding in his head is less but his body is aching all over and he feels totally gross, covered in dried sweat and with faint traces of blood still caked  under his fingernails. He’s dazed from the pain and from two flashbacks in a row and so deeply exhausted he has no idea how he’s going to get into the shower, much less stand upright under the spray and clean himself.
“Cas?”
He returns a few minutes later, carrying a tray that he sets down on the bed. There are two bowls on it with curry rice and chicken. Dean glares at the untouched water in Castiel's hands, and then replaces it with one of the bowls.
Dean sighs and reaches out to rub the kid’s back between his shoulder blades. He lets him cry it out, then ducks his head to try and catch Jack’s bloodshot eyes.
Dean shrugs.
It’s so good, warm and soft and comforting, and Dean parts his lips, presses closer—
“Sounds fair.” He points a thumb behind himself. “If you’re good to wait here, I’m gonna go help the others.”
He doesn’t know how long he lies there, a curled-up, snotty mess, but the weight gradually eases off his chest until he feels almost light. When he can sit up, Cas hands him a tissue from the dispenser, and then Dean tucks himself close again, seeks out Cas's mouth with his.
“You know,” Cas says, his tone warm and intimate like they’ve been having a conversation the entire time they walked silently at each other’s side. “I started calling you Bear because of how grumbly and grumpy you are when woken or hungry. But there’s another reason.”
Clearly, he is surrounded by lazy slobs.
“W-w-what? Why?”
On the way to the store, Dean had complained about still feeling tired even after two cups of coffee, so Castiel got him a third one when they stopped for gas. Dean's delight quickly morphed into grumpiness when he discovered that, while he was now more awake, there were other consequences to drinking that much coffee in quick succession.
As soon as they’re in deep enough water to be able to swim, the tense lines on Dean’s face smooth out and his discomfort visibly gives way to joy. As always, seeing him happy makes Castiel feel deeply content. Letting Dean set the pace, he swims at his side, trying to take it all in. He’s been swimming with Dean in the bunker’s pool but the ocean had always been something that he’d admired from afar, never having had reason or opportunity to swim in it.
“Should we get going as well?”
"You okay, Cas?" Sam asks.
“Jack and I are leaving tonight after dinner. I thought we could um, spend some time together before then.”
How often has Dean looked at him like that and Castiel either didn’t notice or didn’t understand? He had been so sure that Dean didn’t return his feelings, it had never occurred to him what Dean was trying to tell him without words.
Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, Dean wrangles with his mouth and with the emotions the memory is dragging to the surface.
“He did,” Cas agrees. His voice has a soft lilt like he’s trying to soothe Dean. “But Dean, I’m sure he will ‘bounce back’.” Cas does the air quotes thing. It looks just as dorky as usual, and a strong wave of fondness warms Dean from within. “When he’s ready to talk, he’ll come to you.”
Cas turns off all the lights except one bedside lamp and sits down on the free side of the bed.
It's twenty minutes into the movie and Dean has already forgotten what it's supposed to be about. He's sitting in one of the armchairs, Cas in the one next to him. Jack is sitting on a pillow on the floor between them because he's a weirdo—which is probably a given considering who raised him.
and your
Dean shakes his head. Painkillers don't do crap for this kind of thing. He tries to only take them when he really needs to anyway, because he's been skirting the edge of dependency for years now. What he really wants is some coffee, but he can't have any if he plans to try and sleep off the worst of this in the car.
He’s just had a bath a few hours ago, so another shower feels a bit excessive. Wetting the cloth again, he just washes his junk and ass, trying not to think about how he might be acting foolishly optimistic.
Why did he sound so unsure? Who the fuck else would it be?
It’s night again. Night means he’ll be alone.
. The way it feels when I don’t know if you’re safe—if I can spare you that feeling, then I want to do that. I
“Right.”
Dean shrugs. “S-so? I have a st-t-tutter and I’m rec-c-claiming th-that song to m-m-make fun of
Bent over his tray of chocolate and peanut butter cookies that are about ready to go into the oven, Dean checks one last time that they’re all arranged in a way that they won’t stick together as they bake. “Fuck off, Sammy, ‘m busy.”
“I don’t want an apology from you, Dean. Look, I know you didn’t do it on purpose. That’s not—” Sam cuts himself off, takes an audible breath. “I need you,” he continues, putting force behind each word, “to take better care of yourself.”
Silence stretches for a moment. When Sam starts talking again, his voice is gentle, sympathetic. “Do you think you can talk with Cas about it instead?”
"You d-d-dumbass," Dean says from where he's pressing the side of his face against Castiel's, his voice affectionate and watery. From this close, Castiel can hear the hitch in his breath.
"You fell asleep while we watched TV. Do you want to get ready for bed?"
“Since when is it cheesy for me to say that I adore you?” Castiel teases him gently, something about Dean being shy like this drawing out his playful side.
Cas starts stroking a hand down Dean’s spine again. “You’ve lost weight, and you’re not letting yourself have the rest you need. You try to be there and take care of everyone, but you’re not letting us take care of you. I know it’s a hard habit to break, but I’d like you to try. Try and be kinder to yourself, Dean. Try and think about what would make you happy, and then let yourself have it.”
Dean needs a moment to absorb that. He can’t remember praying at all, but he does remember his fear when he realized that he wouldn’t be able to get away from the edge of the pool fast enough.
“Okay.” For an awkward moment, Cas just stands there. “Well, um. I’ll go get you some water.”
But how can he ask for more when Cas seems so content with what they have?
Together, they carried Dean's TV over. And originally, Dean had wanted to wait until his Cave was finished before watching movies there, but—who the fuck knew how much longer Cas was going to stay before leaving and probably going MIA again? And if Dean let Cas go back to research, he might not have another opportunity to spend some one on one time with him.
"Go outside?"
Eileen and Jack shake with laughter while Dean glares murder at Cas. Unfazed, Cas reaches out and wipes something off of Dean’s chin. “You had some syrup there.” It sends the other two into another round of laughter, which is completely excessive in Dean’s opinion.
"No?" Cas asks, feigning surprise. "That's convenient then, seeing as it's nearly dinner time and you wanted to cook."
"I'll leave you two alone, then. Just came to bring you this." He bends down and puts the plate on top of the green cooler that Dean had set on the floor so he could clean the backseat.
Dean is still asleep, so Castiel gently strokes his back through the shirt he’d draped over him in lieu of a blanket until he stirs. Blinking in disorientation, Dean immediately starts frowning in displeasure at having been woken.
Dean knows his limits though. He’s made up his mind and Castiel is equally as determined to support him any way he needs.
“Well—y-yeah. No. I—”
There's a smudge of flour on Dean's arm. Knowing he won't wake, Castiel gently wipes it away. It makes Jack's smile flash through his mind again, the child-like excitement in his voice,
When he’d found Cas in the Garden—or inside the Occultum, or on Neptune; Dean still didn’t completely understand where they had been, just that it hadn’t been the Empty, even though that was where Cas had said he’d go. When he’d found Cas—when he’d run to him, had reached for him, when he’d told him “Me too, Cas. Always”. They’d held each other tightly, they’d smiled at each other through tears, but they hadn’t kissed.
“It's been a month. I don’t understand what it is he says he needs to get used to.”
Dean scowls, and says nothing, and adds sugar and milk and a pinch of cinnamon to his coffee since no one is paying him enough attention to notice anyway. He could dance the hula for all the attention Cas is giving him.
The thought is followed by a wave of panic so strong, Dean has to open the door on his side and breathe in the cold air for a moment, he’s that dizzy. Rain hits him in the face like sea spray, like he’s driven Baby straight into an ocean. The shock of it helps though, and when he closes the door again he at least feels alert and in control enough to drive back home.
Dean pouts. Yeah okay he did, because he wants to take better care of himself, but—that's private!
Swallowing thickly, Dean tries to clear his suddenly blocked throat. Cas withdraws his hand, and Dean’s heart lurches painfully. His skin still tingles where Cas was touching him.
“Dean, you fucking
Dean shakes his head and signs
“Ugh, st-t-top.” Dean comes out of hiding again, sputtering. “D-d-don’t d-do the
A part of Dean didn’t understand why that wasn’t good enough for him. He felt like he was watching himself from a distance, not getting why he was acting the way he was but also unable to stop himself.
Shifting his stance, Dean clears his throat.  “How ‘bout me a-a-and Jack st-t-tay here?” It’s like he’s read Castiel’s thoughts, though he is no longer looking at him, firmly focusing on Sam. “You guys got th-this. I’m not good w-w-with witch stuff, but you’re l-l-like Row-w-wena’s apprent-t-tice at this point. And c’mon, you’re go-go-gonna have Maggie ha-a-andle the netw-w-work
"W-w-with the right boots you would-d-d."
That’s another thing Dean appreciates about the girl—unlike Sam, she knows how to eat. Though, ever since they started dating, Sam has loosened up a little. Maybe if Dean packs enough cookies, they’ll share. That’s romantic, right?
Sam sighs.
Dean waves him in and quickly shuts the door again. He can barely open his eyes, but he can basically feel Cas looking him up and down, checking him over for injuries in a way that's probably mostly reflex by now. It still warms Dean a little inside. If Cas was protective before, it's got nothing on how he's been since Dean gave Michael his front door key.
Cas must read something in Dean’s silence because he continues, his voice gentle like he thinks one wrong word will shatter Dean like glass. “Is it the seizures?”
“Cas? Hey, Cas, you listening?”
“Do you want to go lie down for a bit?”
"Anytime, Cas."
“Hey,” he says, speaking slower than usual to reign in his stutter and doing his best to enunciate as carefully as possible. “Good to see you. How you b-been?” While Eileen is smiling back at him, Dean can’t help but notice how she looks kind of tense, and worn around the edges.
With a groan, he sits back down on the bed, his head in his hands. Dean is on him immediately, holding him steady by the shoulders, ducking his head and trying to peer into his eyes.
“I don’t care as long as we get out of the sun,” Eileen says, shrugging and gesturing at herself.  “I want a shower.”
Cas looks at him, obviously confused.
Jack orders a stew that smells delicious, but he's poking at it more than eating it. Dean makes the effort of swallowing before opening his mouth, because it's at times difficult enough to understand him with his stutter as it is. “Hey, k-kid, you okay?”
“Alr-r-r-right, got it.” Dean turns in his seat and signals the waitress. Sam is putting his phone away, mouth set in a thin line.
Dean can feel himself flush, and maybe also tear up a tiny little bit. Words are still hard a lot of the time, but Cas listens anyway. Cas gets it. Dean grips Cas’s fingers tight, his voice turning into a whisper in the intimacy of their bed.
“Not th-the sa-a-ame,” he grouses, getting out from behind the wheel and walking around Baby’s front. He decides to be brave and to fuck what anyone might think, and grabs Cas's hand to hold it. They’re married now, so that means their honeymoon has started. No one can blame him for being a little touchy-feely. Or a lot, even. For like, the rest of forever.
Cas sighs, because not only is he a dumbass he's also super dramatic, but he does start rubbing Dean's back so Dean instantly forgives him. Jesus, it's nice. Cas's hands are warm but not sweaty, and also they're so freaking
Looking down, the sight that greets him is so erotic that Dean moans helplessly, blindly grabbing for the lube he’d thrown onto the bed. Dean would be turned on no matter what because this is Cas, but man, the guy has some dick on him. Thick
"It is."
He’s halfway through dinner prep when Eileen joins him.
of a-a-all things.”
Sam and Eileen have just started decorating the kitchen. When they enter, Sam looks up in alarm but quickly relaxes when he sees it’s not Jack.
“How is it,” Cas laments as he watches them eat, “that every time
“D-d-don’t say it,” Dean grouses, lifting his hand just enough to watch as Castiel sits down on the edge of the bed. “I don’t w-w-wanna hear it.” Dean does take his hand though when Castiel offers it, and clings tight.
Taking stock, he can admit that he does feel tired in more than a physical way. It’s hard to miss, really, with the way his speech will immediately get worse when he’s agitated, distressed, or exhausted.
Cas is frowning at him when he opens the door. “Sam told me what happened. How are you?”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Jack says, like they’ve been having a conversation the entire time. Maybe they have. “Most of the time, I cherish being mostly human now. Castiel helped me see it for the gift it is, experiencing the world like you are. And I can’t thank him enough for that. But I still feel… regret. Guilt.” Jacks looks down at his hands, resting palms up on his thighs.. “My powers… they did bad things. They let
It’s a nice, rich stick-to-your-ribs stew with beef and vegetables, and Dean inhales it as fast as he can. It’s soothing to have that gnawing feeling of hunger melt away, but eating is also making him drowsy again a lot sooner than he’d like. Cas watches him fight against the rising tiredness, then nudges him to make room against the headboard and takes the spoon from him.
“Usually when you wake up you’re like an angry bear,” Cas says. “But right now you’re much more of a cat. A grumpy one.”
When he’s back, they make out lazily on the bed until Dean’s stomach starts to growl.
Cas's eyes, when Dean finally meets them, are shining with something like excitement, like he’s found something that he thinks will make Dean happy, and that’s enough of a reason for him to want this, too. If he’s offering this, is must mean that he doesn’t think Dean’s being needy or stupid for wanting it, and that quietens Dean’s fears, makes him brave enough to say: “I—y-yeah. Yes.” It comes out a little breathless, and only once the words are out of his mouth does he realize how that sounded, what those words mean.
Slowly, his eyes focused on the ceiling above him. But the ceiling in his room didn’t look like this—where was he?
Curling up in a ball, Dean had shoved all those ugly, confusing feelings and sensations back down. His family was finally happy and safe and Dean intended to keep it that way.
“I will always be where you are, Dean.”
when Dean realizes that he never got beer and snacks, which he always does. He’s not hungry or thirsty though. He kind of just wants to sit here with Cas. It’s the closest he can get to him.
If this is all he's going to get, then, well. It's cool. He's going to suck it up and be grateful.
“There’s not even anyone around to see you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel nods to Maggie and gently squeezes Jack's shoulder, "Just give me a minute."
Lights flash painfully in front of his eyes and he doesn't understand where he is or what's happening anymore, just that it's the end.
“Dean… I know you feel that way right now, but none of what Michael did to you has ‘dirtied’ you in any way. I think you’re having trouble separating yourself from his actions and that makes you feel ashamed. This,” Cas gestures between the two of them, “is still very new. And combined with the bad experiences you recently had... It sounds like your body and mind are confused and don’t know what feels good or bad anymore. It’s understandable and I will never be mad at you for having an emotional reaction like this. Or for wanting, or not wanting, physical affection at any moment. You don’t need to hide this from me.”
It was a good thing Sam had already put the mug down at that point, because he looked so startled he probably would have dropped it. Dean himself had been so taken aback at hearing his own voice, raspy and stuttery as it was, it took him a moment to realize Sam was hugging him, face pressed into Dean’s neck and wet with tears.
All he gets in return is a blend of a sigh and a moan.
“Do you need the water now?”
"That was a little rude," Castiel says, though he can't help his smile.
There were two sets of hands on him then, stroking his back, and soothing words meant to calm him down, but the tears were still dripping down his chin, relentless sobs making him gasp for air.
Dean keeps glowering at him and Cas sighs.
“What’s wrong?”
Does he?
And the worst is, his family doesn't even know. Doesn't see it. There's an invisible yet solid wall separating Dean from them, and he just pretends like he belongs. They deserve better.
a mess—no color coordinated outfit can change that.
Shaking his head, Dean wipes at his cheeks and then makes himself meet Cas’s eyes. “No, I… I always want—And it’s so good, I swear, but then after, I feel…” Dean trails off, licking his lips and tasting salt.
Somehow, Dean manages to burrow even deeper into him. It takes a while, but he finally cries himself to sleep, his breath deepening and his body going lax in Castiel's hold.
“Making what up?” Sam asks as Cas parks Dean’s chair beside him and Jack.
That makes Cas smile a little.
Dean feels smug for all of three seconds when Eileen steals some of Sam’s ice cream as “punishment”. But then she and Sam sign back and forth too fast for Dean to follow and somehow end up kissing and being all lovey-dovey.
“Shut up. T-t-talking is exhausting-g-g, a-a-and you’re the one who started it, so it’s your f-f-fault I’m starving-g-g now.”
Ducking down to search his eyes, Eileen asks, “Do you need anything else?”
Ever since Dean herded Cas and Jack into the library and had them put their names down on the table— (“But Dean, that’s for your family.” - “Yeah, exactly.”)—something seems to have settled between him and Jack. He no longer looks at Dean as if desperate for something he can’t give a name to. Instead—
Cas is smiling too but it fades when he gets a good look at Dean.
Baking cookies.
Cas frowns at the cookies. "You seem to be having the issue well in hand," he says, which makes Dean snort and then chuckle. Dean starts to say something else but Mary and the others have just entered the kitchen.
Taking a sip of his beer to try and get rid of the lump in his throat, Dean attempts to focus on the movie. The last thing he remembers is some kind of action scene with cars, but now suddenly there's a tearful reunion between lovers. They're holding each other and then they’re kissing each other, and then suddenly Dean realizes he's halfway out of the room.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’d tried not to dwell too much on whatever Cas was doing in heaven, too scared that Cas would decide to stay after all no matter his promises.
"Hey, um." Oh fuck, is he really doing this? "Whaddaya say, once I've put the pot roast in the oven, wanna go kick back a little and watch something? Your pick."
The son of a bitch has risen to stand on its hind legs. Its unnaturally thin body sways back and forth like a dead tree branch, towering over them, staring them down. It oozes
"Sam and I want to go for a walk, stretch our legs," Eileen says.
Sam and the stupid old books could suck it, it was Dean's turn to monopolize Cas's time now! Fair was fair!
Their trip to the zoo is coming to an end, but Castiel thinks it was quite successful. It was a joy especially to watch Jack be so carefree and so excited about everything. They’ve taken a lot of photos today, and Castiel is looking forward to selecting some for the family album they’ve started. He knows it means a lot to Dean as well, to have physical proof of the happiness they have found at last.
Cas huffs out a breath of laughter, his chest moving with it.
Dean's eyes widen and his cheeks blush. He looks lovely.
Sam looks dubious.
This was their night routine in the motels as well. And their vacation was—it was awesome. And yet…
Cas doesn’t budge.
“Is something the matter? You've seemed... out of sorts, lately. At first I thought it was just because of Sam, but now I'm not so sure anymore.”
Molly just nods. “Afraid that’s all I can tell you. Like I said, nobody’s seen or heard
Gently, Castiel cups Dean's cheek and strokes over the dried tear tracks with his thumb until Dean stirs.
Sam is glowing with it, his smile honest and his eyes shining. Dean is so proud of him, and he wants to hug him—Sam still folds himself into Dean's arms when they hug even though he's taller, briefly becoming a kid again.
It had sounded so nice, sounded like something Castiel wanted.
“Okay, yeah. B-but only if y-you—”
“Cas?”
Dean sounds like he's smiling when he asks, "Af-f-fraid of a little da-da-dark, Cas?"
"'Kay," Dean mumbles, eyes already closed, trusting Castiel completely. The glow of Grace briefly illuminates Dean's pale cheek, and then the tension goes out of him, his mouth going slack.
Distantly, Dean’s aware he’s crying. He wants to kiss Cas. Torn between conflicting instincts, he reaches forward and draws him close, draws him into a hug instead. It’s awkward with the armrests of the chairs between them, but Cas doesn’t seem to care either. He clings back just as tightly. Their hearts thump against each other. Dean’s skin erupts in goosebumps with how good-bad the touches are, but he stubbornly holds on.
“Really sorry for botherin’ you,” the guy—Cal?—says for like the third time. Dean had been chopping onions in the kitchen when Cal knocked on the doorframe and asked for help with his truck. Apparently, Sam had sent him straight to Dean, and if Cal’s skittish attitude and the way he shifted his weight from foot to foot were anything to go by, he’d rather have gotten no help at all.
a good day."
"That’s good, but… not what I meant." At Castiel's confused look, she adds, "You've been kind of quiet. Worried. So, we started worrying about you."
Breath hitching, Dean manages to open his eyes. He’s greeted by the blurry sight of Cas, holding Dean’s hands and staring at him in concern.
Dean grumbles but makes his way to the bathroom.
Dean looks down at their hands and then searches Cas's eyes. He can read sincerity there, and worry. And love.
—please don’t suffer in silence like this. It—you deserve to have your needs taken care of. They’re not a burden. Please try to believe that.”
Dean’s fingers curl into the fabric of Castiel's shirt, and his warmth is Castiel's anchor through the night and long past dawn.
“If it’s too much work, you can just—”
“‘M tired, C-Cas. We’ve d-d-done en-n-nough.”
"The ghost army isn't going anywhere," Sam says.
He's not. He wants Cas.
“Yes,” Cas breathes against his mouth, voice raspy, and then he closes the last bit of distance between them, and,
Finally though, Sam announced that he needed some air and wanted to go on a run before dinner. The moment he was gone, Dean slammed the laptop lid shut and stood up. "Alright, enough research for today. C'mon, I need your help with something way more important."
“When you’re done sweet-talking your car, give me the keys.”
He sits there for a while torn between being angry at and worried about Sam. His back starts to protest being upright in any way but Dean's feeling too lonely and upset to go to sleep right now. He takes his key card and his phone and pads across the hallway over to room 19, not even bothering to put on shoes, because fuck that noise.
Sam is definitely angry now, and apparently also on a roll, because Dean starts to say something placating when Sam cuts him off with, “And besides, shouldn't you worry more about your own relationship?”
Dean sounds pouty and defensive. Feeling that warmth spread through him again, Castiel is quick to reassure Dean, “If there are things that never end, I do hope that this is one of them.”
Dean must find some humor in that, because he snorts and laughs to himself.
Cas hasn’t, but Dean listens to him vent about their frustrating situation, trying his best to be supportive. He gets so wrapped up in their little bubble, it’s jarring when suddenly Sam is in the kitchen. Sam’s sweaty and smells like a wet dog. Dean complains, and Sam ignores him in favor of chugging a huge glass of water and then poking at the egg whites and humming in approval.
Sam and Cas exchanged a look.
“D-d-d-don't wanna.”
“Dean!”
For a little over a week after getting back, after being home again and alone in his body, Dean hadn’t been able to talk at all. Everything was overwhelming and exhausting, and he communicated in nods and headshakes when he was present enough to hear and understand what someone was asking him in the first place. A lot of those first few days back, he’d just drifted, losing track of hours and days, mind far away.
“Cas, you okay?”
Checking his watch, Sam says, “Almost time. I better get back.” Then he turns and makes his way through the snow back down the hill, where Jack and Eileen and the fireworks are waiting.
Cas sounds like he really wants to know, and Dean does really want to tell him. But the truth is too terrible. Too damning. He can’t say it.
It’s still early when they go back inside. They’re quiet, but their shoulders bump as they walk side by side and their fingers tangle, drawn back to each other.
That gets Dean moving. When he’s got his shirt on, Castiel helps him back into the beach wheelchair so they can disassemble and fold up the shelter. When they’re ready, Castiel gives Jack a bottle of water from their cooler, and then Dean too.
“And?” Dean counters. He finally doesn't feel like he's starving anymore, but he's going to get the rest of the stew to go. It would be a damn shame to waste it. “Just means l-l-less w-work f-f-f-for all-l-l of us.” Dean rubs at his jaw, irritated with the way his fluency is going downhill. It’s been months but it’s still difficult to hear his words not come out right anymore.  “A-a-and unless you b-b-been sneakin' out at night, you guys h-haven't seen each other in while. So w-what gives?”
in a way that despite everything Dean’s faced in his life has his heart pound and the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Then it lunges, and Dean shoves his fear aside and stands his ground.
Despite everything, that somehow makes Dean smile.
“Even if whatever it is means we will end up fighting, I won’t just leave.” Cas falters, and looks down at their hands. “I just… I just needed you to know that. The idea that you would choose to be quietly unhappy because I could hold leaving you over your head is terrible and unacceptable.”
Straightening, Cas looks around like he’s securing a perimeter to make sure none of the things used the distraction to sneak up on them, and then, eyes narrowing, he zeros in on Dean. Feeling like his hand got caught in a cookie jar he didn’t even know existed in the first place, Dean freezes halfway on his way to the fence and the mine shafts, and Cas crosses the distance between them with determined strides.
It's only now that Castiel notices the flour over Dean, Jack and Maggie's clothes, some of which is handprint shaped. There's a lot of it on Dean's clothes especially.
Dean knows that if he asked, Cas would come to him. But then what? Cas can't heal him. They've established months ago that the migraines are Dean's body and mind trying to heal themselves from the crap they'd been put through for six months. They happen less now, and they're not as bad as in the beginning, when he was having flashbacks all the fucking time. He's just got to knuckle through.
“Yes ma'am,” Dean replies with a long-suffering sigh. Damn rabbit food, but one doesn’t just say no to Martha.
Trying hard not to get defensive, Dean held out one of the mugs to him. “Yeah, well, you like hot chocolate, right?”
“Th-this is
His heart was still racing. His mouth still tingling. He felt happy and excited like a kid with a crush. He felt like laughing and smiling and crying all at once. He’d
Dean shrugs a little and then grimaces.
did an amazing job beta reading this. thank you so much lovely <3
Dean wakes slowly. Judging from the way he feels all groggy and his mouth tastes like unwashed cotton, he must have slept too long. Rolling over with a grunt, refusing to open his eyes, he fumbles a hand out of the sheets, reaching for—
Dean walks over to the grill that Sam's just gotten started and shoulders him out of the way, snatching up the apron. "Step as-s-side, Sammy, the Meat Man's i-i-in in the house now."
. Tem-m-mpor-r-rary. I c-can f-f-f-feel it. L-l-l-like. In, um, ins-s-side. It w-w-won’t g-get b-back t-t-to how it, um, w-w-was bef-f-for-r-re.
“He did, but that’s not why it took so long,” Castiel explains gravely. “There was a baby.”
“Sure, kiddo,” Dean says, gruffly, head ducked over his plate and shoveling pasta into his mouth. Jack beams.
While Dean undresses, Castiel fills the tub up the rest of the way, steam wafting up into the air. Dean sinks into the water with a groan of contentment, and then reaches up and starts tugging insistently on Castiel's pant leg.
“Oh yeah?”
Dean sighs when Castiel starts petting his fingers through the strands. Fumbling for Castiel’s other hand, he starts playing with his fingers.
“You’re limping and you’re having trouble breathing.”
“Oh no,” Sam was saying, sounding heartbroken, “Dean—”
Castiel nods. “Thank you, Sam. Do we have another blanket?”
to her. She offers him a gentle smile and rubs his back. The touch is good and warm and Dean’s overcome by the wish that she would hug him.
Castiel does. When Jack is busy with the next cookie, Castiel meets Dean’s eyes over his head and mouths a
He’s half asleep when Cas tucks him in and actually lies down with him, letting Dean curl into his side. “I love you,” he says, and then chuckles when Dean tries to say it back and it comes out as more gibberish than actual words. “Sleep,” Dean hears him say, so he does just that.
“Sa-Sa-Sam did. T-t-to prank me. I almost puked.”
It’s overrun and there’s too much noise. But Dean didn’t expect much else, and besides, Sammy and Cas aren’t there, so this doesn’t count as his first ever visit to the beach. Not until he’s got sand between his toes anyway.
“Who doesn’t?” Dean interrupts him, bristling. “Also, how do I know you’re not making this up?”
“Okay, Dean.”
,” he reads. “I’d like to learn how to surf one day, it looks like fun.” He puts the cap down and picks up the juice, then turns to Dean with a smile. “Thank you!”
Cas looks like he’s bracing himself, watching Dean closely.
“Gotta pee.”
Something is hitting Dean's chest. There's a burn inside him like fire and his throat is blocked. There's weird distorted noises like someone yelling at Dean underwater, yelling at him from far away.
Sam snorts.
He frowns. “Yeah, b-but now I l-l-look st-t-tupid.”
Carefully, Castiel moves his fingers out of Dean’s hair and tugs Dean’s sleep mask back over his eyes. Keeping a hold on Dean’s hand, Castiel lets himself lean into his warmth, lets it soothe him.
With how much time he has spent away from the bunker over the last couple of years, always feeling like he had to prioritize whatever mission he was currently on, Castiel is perhaps more used to spending time apart. Still, he prefers it when they can check in with each other.
They’ve picked the perfect day—the sky is clear and blue, the waves calm. Despite the warmth from the sun, Dean still thinks it’s too early in the year to go swimming. The water is gonna be cold as fuck. That’s not stopping Sam, Eileen and the kid though, who are all already stripping off their clothes and can’t seem to wait to get into the ocean.
