Jen had been a little quiet and preoccupied since her ‘date’ with Winchester, and Jane found herself missing the gentle lilting songs and ready smile.  It that was not so surprising, Jane herself had been truly upset to hear about the incident in Covent Garden.  He was a nice guy, but Crowley had assured her he was recovering well.
“Put him in with Lafitte,”  he said to the supervisor of the high-security staff.  “And for Christ’s sake keep your eye on Alastair.  He will be all over that sweet piece of arse if you give him even half an opportunity.”
He glanced round the corner. A figure stood just yards away, had the man made him? On first glance he looked like a guard, but no-one Dean recognised. But then he’d only been here a few weeks and the guards didn’t all work in HS.
He pulled up a carefully magnified image on his tablet, and showed them the comparison. “Not all of them, just in places. See the difference.”
“Isn’t that sweet,” the brother drawled, “the human seeks to rescue you, Castiel. Perhaps your fledgling feelings are not so unrequited. What do you think, sister, of your rival?”
“Ok,” Mariella smiled at him, “I think we can safely say you had us all eating out of your hand. Now I think it’s only fair to raise the house lights and open up to questions from the audience. We’ll let you grab a little drink, while I explain how this works. If you all just raise your hands if you have a question our ushers will move amongst you with the microphones and you can speak to Dean. Please bear in mind this is a child friendly session and over to our first questioner…”
“It was Daisy saw her first. She’s a kind little fing, my mum always says she has a caring nature, dead set on being a nurse when she grows up.” Crowley forced himself to concentrate. “So she sees the lady tryna get the big buggy down the steps ‘n’ she goes ‘Mum, don’t you fink you oughta ‘elp,’ ‘n’ I goes ‘mebbe she don’ want my ‘elp, Poppet, cos I calls Daisy Poppet on account of her sweet nature…”
He counted his money yesterday, or was it the day before? It doesn’t matter. He hasn’t bought anything in days. He knows he has precisely ten dollars and 32 cents left in his pocket. They had handed him back his wallet full of shiny plastic when they released him all those months ago, bumpy silver letters spelling out the name of the man he can no longer be. C J Milton, museum archivist, philanthropist, art collector, friend.
Dean slid his eyes sideways, trying to scope more of his surroundings without moving his head to alert them he was conscious again. It was a machine room of sorts, dials and a control panel to one side, bare walls all round. Bare concrete striking cold under the balls of his feet. There was nothing within reach around him, they had stood this chair away from the door in the centre of the available space. He could hear they were all stood by the door, but they were frustratingly out of his view line. Lee and Missy seemed to be doing most of the talking. Alastair making only that one mumbled contribution. He risked lifting his head a little. He may as well have lifted it a lot, Alastair was watching him, with pure, focused malice.
Europe. He can imagine it, so easily. He has spoken to colleagues in London frequently, even met a few of them in person, they would all be super excited to have him visit. His exhibit is a hit, he’s fairly certain that it can be used as the basis for combining the trip with work. A return collaboration. A couple of weeks in London working, while Bal gets his fill of Mick and then they could tour a little. The UK is a collection of nations steeped in history. Maybe, he could visit Skara Brae, walk in the footsteps of stone age man, visit his home, now that would be spectacular…and once he has his passport, maybe he can actually go to Egypt. He knows Dr. Salah would be delighted, she’s already hinted a few times that she would love him to give one of the Monday night lectures in Zamalek...
“Any questions?” Castiel asks the now enthralled group, even the two girls who had seemed determined to prove they were far too cool, tough and streetwise to be interested in stuffy artefacts, or to think grown men dressing up in costume anything but ridiculous, had come round. And now he was in, what usually proved to be the most popular section. The mummification process. The array of tools never ceases to fascinate kids and he is soon fielding enthusiastic questions about brain hooks and jars of body bits. He knows he can be as gruesome as he likes, this group have already proven themselves to be a bloody thirsty bunch.
“No,” he acknowledged quietly, “doing nothing is never an option.” He sighed. “How much do you know about why I’m here?”
'Indeed. But tonight…' Castiel ran his hand along Dean's backside suggestively. 'We should assay whether your riding skills are still acceptable.'
He lifted his head from his folded arms, unaware that his cheek carried the impression of his suit buttons, dark brown eyes bleary with sleep and cropped black hair pressed into an awkward shape on one side..
Charlie had glanced first at Kasia, then at Amy both of whom gave her little nods of consent, before she interrupted Kali. “What do you need, Kali?”
Dirty little pervert, Dean chuckled. On and on the messages continued. Snippets of his day. Everything from burning his tongue on his coffee to observations about the people he was meeting. Entranced, Dean scrolled on. He would read them and then ask Sam to pull up so he could have a little privacy when he made his call.
“A few days later, someone broke into our house, set a fire.  The way Dad told it, Mom grabbed me and he grabbed Dean, only the fire had taken a real hold in my nursery… Mom managed to get me to Dad, and he shoved me into Dean’s arms and shouted at him to get me out of the house.  He tried to get back to Mom, but she was trapped, he couldn’t reach her.  The floor gave way and he ran out, barely made it himself.  Dad never got over it, he became convinced it was the man from the garage.  For years it was just us, dragged from pillar to post by his determination to find this guy.  A whole childhood focussed on one thing.  Revenge.  Dean bore the brunt of it.  Protected me.  Dad increasingly lost the plot, so Dean and I, we only really had each other, we became each other’s entirety.”
He thinks hard. The compound is huge and will take days to search thoroughly. It’s just a matter of choosing the place most unlikely to be searched first. From the mantel, in the other room, they hear the gentle chime of his mother’s clock. He has to go, being missed will be a disaster.
He lay gasping for air on the bed they had used on their last visit. She pushed his hair from his forehead and he flinched away from her touch. “I know my prince, I know, but it will pass. The worst is over. Shhh.” Someone was unlocking the manacles, and rubbing at his ankles and wrists, before with a simple twist the cursed torq was pulled from his neck.
Cas shakes his head. “Not funny Claire, not funny,” but he’s still smiling. He’ll gladly be the butt of all her jokes and teasing so long as she is happy here with him.
“I most certainly did not, Officer Bass,” Crowley snapped indignantly. “Do you have any idea how much paperwork I would have to complete if I shot one of my own officers?”
“Of course, Leader,” Brother Alastair lisps, sliding into view. “Brother Castiel is safe in my hands.”
Cas curled his fingers, the soft fresh skin of his palm extra sensitive to the sensation.  He squeezed back, tethered in this safe little oasis by a warm solid grip.  He looked at Dean.  His face was a study of blankness, until he winked at Cas and leant towards him,  shoulder brushing shoulder, he whispered.  “Stay with me buddy,  I need you. They’re tryna rope me into providing the harmonies.”
“You could try sounding a little less surprised,” Cas says, but he is far from offended. “Is there anything you need or want for the next few days? They issued a storm warning for overnight and into tomorrow, it might come to nothing, but the realtor did warn me that this place can get cut off for a few days with heavy snowfall. We could always decamp into town, I’m sure I can get a suite somewhere if you’d rather…”
“I know Sam. I know.” From his vantage point, sat in the soft sand higher up the beach, Dean watched as ‘that guy’, his saviour, Castiel, (mute not deaf), finished patiently packing Dean’s scattered belongings into the backpack. The flow of soft linen showing off some impressive musculature as the growing offshore wind sculpted his clothes to his body. "Lucky as fuck," he mumbled mostly to himself.
Castiel had certainly never been told that his father was a published writer. Two novels, some philosophical essays clipped from publications that even Castiel, with his sheltered upbringing, recognised as prestigious and a collection of poems. And it was these that he loved most. His father’s poetry was profound and beautiful.
“I’m sorry Dean.  If Crowley does push this to the DA, and he decides to press charges, you will end up serving time here. Even when we get the other charges dropped.”
Kali reached for Gabe’s hand and he squeezed her fingers, grateful for the grounding contact. “It’s a good job I married you, my love, because when I get my brothers back here, I’m going to need a really exceptional lawyer to get me off the double assault charges when I bang their heads together.”
“Bit taller un me. But that ain’t difficult, I’m a bit of a titch. She weren’t wearing heels I don’t fink. S’hard to remember, it’s weeks ago now. Oooo, she had really nice nails, I asked her where she got ‘em done ‘n’ she said the name of a nail bar, said it were up town ‘n’ a ways to travel, but worf it. Blimey, I fought I’d remember. I was gonna give ‘em a go. Nah, mebbe it’ll come back to me.”
His radio crackled, the code called out was a potential altercation and they were one down with Bass sidelined on his paperwork. He flicked through the monitoring cameras and spotted the issue stra1ight away. Dammit! The Governor would chew him a new one if he sent Alastair into a delicate situation like this and it blew up. Not for the first time he wished they’d just fire the jerk.
She is standing in a side street, peering into the window of the Christmas store that stays open all year. He can hear the jaunty notes of Christmas songs as people come and go through the door. Her mittens rest lightly on the glass either side of her nose, where it hovers close to the window. Her round-shouldered figure reflected in the glass and along his own gleaming black paintwork, like a string of papercut dolls.
“Gregory? No. I parked it myself, yesterday.” Her voice was suddenly alert and he knew he had her full attention.
He deployed his lights and siren, and called it in, back-up coming quickly from the roadblock a few miles further south. First on the scene, he’d found Winchester, face battered and bloody, leaning over his unconscious captive.  No sign of the other driver.
“I cannot, Dean. This house is warded and even if it wasn’t, I’d have no control. I have no idea, it may be that I will prove to be a damp squib that can’t blow a bulb or I might level several square miles. I have no way of knowing… She is right. I have no choice but to go with Her, you really do not understand what you are up against, you cannot kill daemon with bullets or human weapons, they - we - are not immortal, but we are not mortal either. They will tear you and your family apart, before you can even think of fighting back. And I cannot bear that. She will honour Her side of the bargain for as long as I honour mine. I have endured centuries of this indenture and for your sake, I can endure it again…”
After his first bite Angel stares at him as if he personally resolved the world’s energy crisis and discovered the cure for cancer.
Cold and hard against his lip, water on his lip, and cold on his chest.  Rinse.  Bitter bile, diluted.
“You are pretty enough to be a princess.” Castiel smiled, the very blue of his eyes finally settling on Dean through a cage of lashes.
He listened again, but there really was nothing to hear. He sat back down on the thin rubber of his bunk and rolled sideways slightly to fish the book out from under his thigh. It snagged on the fabric of his jumpsuit as he pulled it clear. The rectangular shape didn’t look right, something was off about the spine. He moved his fingertips over the book and caught a distinct lip. He played at it with his fingernails and felt it give, something was pulling loose. He fiddled some more until the object slid free, it felt for all the worlds like a ruler. A plastic ruler, why the hell would someone put a ruler in the spine of a book? He turned it over his hand, squinting, but all he could make out was the shape, a half inch wide, about six inches long but barely a 16th deep. It was mostly smooth, besides a small hard bump at one end. He felt along the length, his index finger dipping into an oval hollow… there was a click like someone popping bubble wrap and the vision of his left eye exploded with colour. “Son of a bitch!” He slammed his eyes shut and almost dropped the damn thing. The book did fall from his lap and hit the ground with a slam. He blinked hard and stared down at the object still in his hands. It took a few seconds for the negative afterimage to disappear. The LED that had popped his retina was now shining harmlessly on the orange of his jump-suited leg.
There was a crumpling, crackling noise, and the sound of a hinge, before the beat dropped to a subtle pounding, the melody obscured by whatever wall, Balthazar had put between himself and the session.  “What’s up?”
“...I’ve already got a couple ‘o rebuilds booked in for November just up the coast and one of them, I could really use you. Lady wants all new cabinets and I was thinking to hire someone in anyways for the skilled parts, but you could do the lot. Me and the boys can do the grunt work and the repairs while you take care of the bespoke. She’s choosy mind. You might regret saying yes, but it’d be good money, a few weeks work and a good job will spread the word locally.”
He ignored the fact that his ass felt sore, not wanting to think what that might mean.  He also steadfastly avoided looking at the catheter bag attached to a stand by the side of the bed.  Only originally becoming aware of it as he twisted and the tube pulled tight, snatching at his groin with a twinge so painful he’d had to bite his lip.  He allowed his head to flop back, face burning with a mixture of humiliation, rage and frustration, hot tears prickling at his eyes.
It is as the time for late afternoon worship approaches that Castiel becomes aware that things are not as they should be.
Using his chocolate soaked clothing as an excuse to head back a bit earlier and then feigning the need for an early night to excuse them from having dinner together, he congratulates himself on sparing Dean from having to come up with his own excuse for keeping his Friday night free for his date. Claire pouts her disapproval, but Castiel will gladly take the flak, he’d do anything to make Dean’s life a little easier.
He has nearly finished, clearing the stubborn little patch of whiskers in the cleft of his jaw, when he swipes the razor a little clumsily and nicks his skin where it stretches over the bone. It bleeds instantly, profusely, a thick curling rivulet down his neck, and over his chest. Heavy droplets fall from his chin and splash into the water in the basin. A blooded angel. He closes his eyes against the sight, and grips the ceramic to steady himself. But it is too late, the ferrous smell nauseates him and it exaggerates in his mind, and he is lost in memory, staring through an open doorway at what remains of Balthazar, spreadeagled and gutted, a knife jutting in an obscene phallic mockery from his groin. The smell of blood saturating the air in the room.
“Give me time, Lis? When were you gonna tell me, after you moved in with him, or were you gonna wait and just send me a christening invite that had
Spengler blinked at her.  Missy?  Who the hell introduced themselves by their first name.  Or was she called Miss Missy?  “Erm… an altercation?”  Shit.  Was he too late?
Standing just beside the pumps on her tiny forecourt, Marcy Kunsberger peered at the badge flashed at her by ‘Officer’ Powers.
Dean huffed his little laugh and dropped his arm onto Cas’ shoulders.  “I think,”  he said with a little grin, “we might just have got lucky.”  He nodded to a sign on the roadside, half obscured with mud, and peppered with buck shot.  The wording just about visible.  Gasoline and garage services half a mile. A faint glow outlined the hillock that formed the immediate horizon as the road bent out of sight.  He slammed the hood shut with practised ease.  “Care for a little walk?”
“Go ahead,” Ellen said, dryly, “Although you’re a little late. Why d’you think I’m here? He asked me to come down and check on you, apparently the phone here is running out engaged and when he saw your phone heading inland he was worried you’d had another turn and had to go to the hospital.”
“Nothing? You honestly expect me to believe that you’ve been here all these weeks and you’ve told them nothing.”
He allowed himself to be manoeuvred via the grip on his arm and followed the Prince’s elegantly clad figure along the covered corridor. The fresh evening air was pleasant after the stifling heat of the schoolroom. It was mellow with the warmth of late Summer and the scent of the sweet hay scattered in the courtyard to soften the cobbles and absorb the horseshit. The first time he had come here, to take his place as Stablelad, Dean had commented on the waste to the Yardmaster, asking him why they didn’t use straw as they did in town. Master Lafitte shook his head and told him to mind his mouth. And as Dean learned, it was not because he disagreed, or minded what Dean had to say, it was out of kindness. It did not do to question orders, or show disapproval. Here, they did as they please. They wasted resources and food, even animal food, just to prove how rich they were, while in the surrounding land people struggled to keep their families and livestock alive.
They lapsed into silence for a while.  Dean began checking himself over, gingerly testing his jaw and temple, fingers coming away wet from a graze on his cheekbone.
“I enhanced the protection spells, sister,” the voice was harsh, superior, “if the abomination is starting to become immune to your control, I have no wish for him to roam about my home looking for his coat.”
“Donald would have liked you, Dean,”  she said softly, patting his arm, brown eyes hazing with a weary sadness.  “My Davy was never interested in this old place, he wanted to see the world.  They were so different, my husband and my boy.  It broke his father’s heart, but he would never have told him so.  Donald was a good man.  He knew you have to be true to yourself first and foremost, and he would have loved that boy no matter what.  And Davy, he respected his father, even though he didn’t understand him.”
Michael stared at the papers on his desk.  He had re-read the same report three times without it making sense, and he knew reading it a fourth was not going to make it any more coherent.  He had originally planned to read it on the plane, but it had been there in his in-box when he returned from his meeting in Raph’s office just after ten… he was so preoccupied with thinking about that meeting, he’d opened it, hit print and started to look at it before he’d even thought about what he was doing.
and Meg and I am alone, trying to deal with all this. He utterly underestimates me. Always has. So we have the advantage in many ways. And he’s desperate, Cassie. I know his tells. He was so stressed, I could hear it in his voice. Now he knows they exist he wants those files back and he thought he had Adler totally under his control… and now he knows he doesn’t. Even while he’s not entirely sure what’s in them, he knows if Anna’s files get to the authorities it’s all over. He still thinks he can come out of this intact. When he finds out it’s too late, he has nothing to gain by killing any of us. That’s when the offer of a way out will be irresistible to him. He’s a cold bastard, but he’s pragmatic to his core… if we offer him an escape route, he’ll take it.”
He gets up, waiting for his muscles to uncrimp. He gives up and limps on a partially numb foot through the semi open plan of their apartment. The bowl still only holds his own keys. He grabs his phone, but there are no new messages, no missed calls, other than an acknowledgement from Hannah made up of a string of emojis.
The night air is chill and there is no moon. Only the central buildings on The Collective have a permanent electricity supply and it is not wasted on exterior lighting. Inias leads him away from the pool of light at the entrance to the cell block and the dimly lit vehicle sheds into the darkness. He does not speak, using gestures to guide Castiel behind him and Castiel follows suit. If Inias thinks they should maintain their silence, Castiel trusts him to know.
“So we find your coat, we steal the fucking torq and I kidnap your ass and carry you back to the ocean in my car.”
Of course, a night without air-conditioning should have the atmosphere in there resembling a locker room after team showers. The HD digital recording system with the capability for live feed via computer would mean that he could keep a special eye on the good doctor, while he was waiting. Crowley chuckled. Only the best for Dr Dick.
He had obliged, sort of, this time it had been the threat that she could either support him or go quietly with a handsome payoff.  If she tried to expose him, he would make sure she not only lost her job but that she would get no reference and would find it hard to get work anywhere else.
Bal’s face looms in his mind and fresh pain swirls in his chest. He really is reliving his greatest hits tonight.
He found himself wandering back into the Cas’ suite. His subconscious feeling that maybe this was all some mistake and Cas would be there perhaps. He didn’t really know. Breath bated, he dialled Cas number.
“It was Sammy’s favourite, as a kid.  He’s all muesli, kale and goji berries these days.” Dean’s mouth pulled into a small moue of disgust and he actually shuddered slightly. “But when he was a kid, man, he loved my club sandwiches.”
'I am well, Cas,' he said softly, knowing just where Castiel's mind had been. 'You mustn't dwell on it.'
Sam felt the subtle shift as Cas recovered. Once he was absolutely sure he was OK, he stepped away and moved across the room, returning to his own seat at the table. It was pure chance that he had been stood by the door as Bal and Cas came in, collecting a menu for Jess from the side table, still under penance for his earlier faux pas with room service.
“This is one of our most prized pieces,” he tells them, pointing to the ornate hilt of and with the remnants of it’s obsidian blade mounted in the centre of the case. “This one was purely ceremonial and used to make the first incision, a small slit all the way down the left side of the body,” he demonstrates by stroking his fingers down his own side. “Obsidian is actually a stone, and the ancient Egyptians considered it sacred. But we think they used normal knives like this one to complete the process,” he reaches into his satchel and pulls out the replica he had made from it’s leather safety scabbard.
The cajun bear roused from his temporary hibernation and Dean heard the click of his sidearms as he checked the chambers. He tapped at the wheel of his Baby, jaw bunching, he wanted to see for himself. Unasked, Sam nodded and Benny handed him a weapon. “Try not to shoot yourself in the foot, brother,” he said without hint of irony, “You’ll be a touch rusty.”
His feet still slipping he walked gradually up the bank until strong arms gripped his and with one last heave he slid over the barrier, and they collapsed into a heap on the roadside, both panting heavily, the rain pattering loudly on his back.
“I’ll go fetch Jared,” Lee pressed a hand to her shoulder, as she pouted. “It has to be me, they’d take one look at that nose,” he flicked his head towards Alastair, “And know straight off something’s up. And you sure as hell can’t go. If you ring ahead and tell them there’s a transport order, I can bluff my way in and out. We’re down several staff, so the solo escort should just about fly. You make the phone call and then go with Alastair and help him finish off Lafitte.”
Meg shows little surprise when Castiel catches her attention. She is elbow deep in root vegetables when the pebble he has thrown plops into the vast sink in front of her.
“I want my money back, you slick bastard,”  the voice was a low threatening wheeze and he stared up at the man he had made earlier.  He scrabbled backwards dragging himself to his feet.  He readied himself to run but sensed someone behind him.  He was cornered, the music in the bar pounded mutely in the night air, but it was too far away to make a break for it.  He twisted through 90 degrees and backed towards the wall of the closed retail units at his rear.  Quickly trying to assess his opponents.  They were bulky.  Three stocky men, stances threatening.  He suspected the main aim was to prevent him from running, while his mark took his revenge and his cash.  It was unlikely though, once these other two realised their friend was losing that they would not step in.
“Says the burger addict…” he froze mid-sentence, the smile dropping from his face and the hand poised to stuff fries into his mouth stopped inches short of his target, his green eyes fixed at a point somewhere over the bar.
“Your stomach.” Kiss. “is demonstrating.” Kiss. “Your hunger.” He nibbles the corner of Dean’s mouth. “Not inflammatory disease.” This time the kiss is deep and when they pull apart they are both a little breathless, and little Dean is getting very interested in proceedings.
Objections to the lady were many and varied, from her numerous brushes with the law and those notorious paparazzi photos. Who hasn’t accepted a dare to skate naked on an ornamental lake or two! But perhaps her worst indiscretion was that ‘close personal friendship’ with The Casanova himself. Afterall, there’s nothing recommends you to your future in-law’s better than being ‘best friends’ with their golden boy’s greatest rival.
He had just finished a huge steak meal and been about to taste the delights of a bosomy young woman who had watched him with the focused attention only a paid liaison had ever afforded him, when his cell phone rang the night before. He had tried not to let the look of relief on her face bother him when he told her he had a change of plans. He’d paid her anyway and told her to keep the room for the night. No doubt she had put it to good use. It was uncharacteristically generous, but he was still preening from his successful disposal of Uriel and the steak had been good. Not even a summons from Angel could dampen his mood as he’d climbed into yet another nondescript vehicle and turned South.
Jane Coleman had developed a theory, shared with them all at the morning case conference; the heart had been removed not as a trophy but as obfuscation. She and Steve had become quite animated in their opposing opinions. Crowley had stared at them both with a kind of detached disdain. At this stage, it did not further the case, but it was mildly amusing watching them amiably bickering.
Novak’s shock announcement of his decision to retire at the end of the same season certainly caused fury amongst Team US and the FIS alike. As one anonymous source within the American sports governing body was widely reported as saying, “The atmosphere before Mike’s death was terrible. Constant arguments, ill-tempered outbursts. He was clearly not a happy man and many within Team USA rightly or wrongly chose to point the finger of blame at Novak, there are some who have always resented his inclusion in the team, right from the very beginning.”
Dean stared at him incredulously. “You…? I don’t get it...What’s your angle, Crowley? You don’t even like the man.”
He ran along another stretch of the corridor, pausing to try a couple of doors including one marked cleaning store. Everything was locked. Some of the doorways sported little electronic boxes with softly shining red LEDs. Maybe he should have risked a few extra seconds to grab Alastair’s key card, but he was too damned worried that the asshole would get lucky with the taser.
“And for catching the wets,” Cas said. He also slipped off the bed, sitting on the opposite side of it. “So... mind if I shower first?” he asked.
Adler clenched his jaw so hard he felt one of his teeth almost crack.  He opened the door quietly and climbed from the car, pulling his gun from the glove box and scanning the building. There was no separate building and they already knew that she lived out here, so there must be a back entrance.  He began to make his way to the back.  There was no way that Marcy Kunsberger could be allowed to talk to Henrikson or any of his team.
“I’ll take the next stint,”  Dean said as he finished his coffee.   We take it in turns today, get another 10 hours under our belt and we’ll be halfway there by nightfall.”
He’d never told Cas about how he and Sam had made that one their word for emergencies, in case one of them got caught by the cops.
Angel, unaware of Dean’s quandary, simply shrugs, mouth still chomping on the last bite of cronut. He has eaten it with such obvious pleasure that Dean wishes he had bought more of the damn things. Angel is handsome, even dog-tired and covered in dust. But fresh from the shower, with that faint calm smile playing on his slightly chapped lips, he is stunningly beautiful. His name suits him he looks like an Angel with the softly filtered sunlight playing in his hair like a halo.
It takes him a frustrating few minutes to push enough of his file boxes out of the way to get on his hands and knees and rescue the envelope. He knows what’s in it, of course. Trust Balthazar to be so humble. Balthazar is not in the wrong. He has never done anything but care for Castiel and be kind to him and Castiel is acutely aware that the fault here is all his own. Balthasar’s cuts to answer phone after two rings, it’s just after 2, he is probably schmoozing yet another client with an expensive luncheon somewhere. Another surge of guilt hits him like a sledgehammer, as he thinks about his behaviour in front of the Starks. He has a serious amount of grovelling and making up to do. And he’ll start tonight, by taking Bal to his favourite restaurant.
Raphael glowered at the man in his office.  Zachariah Adler shifted uncomfortably in his seat, watching the lithe, elegantly suited figure prowling the room with barely concealed rage bubbling just below the veneer of cool sophistication.
Victor nodded.  “S’my impression, too.”  The Agent looked extremely thoughtful, biting the inside of his cheek.  There was something else he wanted to say.  Newton waited patiently.  “This case is … well, let’s just say it’s complex.  Have you shared your… reservations with anyone else.”
She kissed his cheek. “You are a wonderful, kind, gentle man, Dean, with a beautiful, creative soul and you shall go to the ball, just maybe not with this prince, this time. But when you do, my friend, I will be there cheering you on as you rock that pink tiara. Now pull your sorry ass together, your public awaits.”
"...if he doesn't start to come round soon, you'll need to call him an ambulance..." Sam. Sam wasn't at the beach, he must still be at the beach, he could feel the sand under his feet.
The smile spread into an impressive grin, as he nodded.  Glancing between them. “Yes, Ma’am.  My brother would wholeheartedly agree with you.”  He opened his wallet and took out a picture, passing it to her.  She squinted slightly.  A pretty blonde smiled out at her from the middle of the picture, her dress a startling white.  On either side of her stood two young men in matching suits and buttonholes.  One peering at the camera from behind a curtain of hair, his grin just as goofy as it was right now.  The other she smiled at fondly.  The image provoking the memory of two very similar young men, one who she had last seen some thirty years ago, the other… this young man’s brother.
Cas lead him towards the back of the house and pushed open a heavy oak door.  The brightness of the room stung his eyes for a second after the cool, heavy darkness of the hallway.  Tree dappled sunlight streamed through South facing windows as the early Summer sunshine finally broke through the clouds outside.  An ancient looking scrubbed table higher than normal, dominated the centre of the room and stools which reminded Dean of bar chairs from back home, were tucked neatly around it.
She bought herself time to compose an answer, by taking a sip of wine. The very last thing she needed to do was meet Dr Dick.  “I think that a carefully monitored reduction in the levels is appropriate at this stage. Patients need time to process trauma, and complete sedation does not give the patient the awareness to so do.  I can begin to reduce the dosage as early as tomorrow.  The responsibility for medication has been signed over to me, as a senior nurse practitioner, I can adjust the prescription, unless you would, understandably, prefer to check with your physician.”
The fact that he knows he is being unfair irritates him all the more. So by the time they have ordered their main course and Balthazar and Don have bickered amicably over the wine menu, Castiel is listlessly pushing the Amuse-Bouche around his plate and trying very hard to not take his mood out on everyone else at the table. All of which may be the reason he overreacts so badly when Bal begins to talk about the impending trip to London. He excuses himself from the table and makes for the restroom, intent on washing his face and a particularly harsh self talk. He knows Bal is probably annoyed with him for being so rude, but to bring up London seems especially cruel. He knows that Castiel is finding the whole thing difficult, because Castiel has told him how disappointed he feels. Even if he hadn’t he can never hide from Bal, the man has a sixth sense about his emotional state. Sometimes it feels like he knows ‘his Cassie’ better than Castiel knows himself. But to chat so casually about the trip, in front of people they barely know. It feels like Bal is exacting cruel and unusual punishment.
Cas stared at the palms of his hands as he washed them in the bathroom sink.  It felt good to be out of the bandages.  Apart from the odd deep stripe of reddened skin, they were almost healed.  He was going to carry scars in a couple of places, but nothing major.  He wiped the condensation from the mirror and set about shaving his own face for the first time since getting ready to head out to meet Bal, nearly two weeks ago.  It felt odd, he had got so used to sitting on the toilet seat while Dean foamed up his face and scraped the razor over his skin, or helped him wash his hair over the bathtub. The intimacy hadn’t even felt intrusive.  He nicked himself, his fingers still a little stiff and clumsy and grabbed some tissue to spot the blood.
They sober up gradually and Castiel gives him a sly side eye. “I thought you said your legs were going numb?”
“That will be a matter for the wing supervisor, Alastair.  Not something you need worry yourself about.”
Adrenalin surged through his veins as the enormity of what he had found struck home.  Never, when he talked about their father getting in touch had Gordy mentioned the Impala, and yet here was Dean, on his hands and knees in a locked shed, heaving his guts into the dirt floor, his nose three feet away from a Kansas plate that read KAZ 2Y5.
Bobby chuckled. “Your idjut brother may not be perfect, but I know you don’t mean that.” He stared at the grin on his computer screen. “I sure do wish he was still on my team.”
“He even accused me of having her killed.  I loved her, Anna, I would never have hurt her.”  She had listened quietly, honoured by his trust in her.  It was utterly unthinkable that this gentle man who, even in business was never utterly ruthless, could have harmed his wife.  Poor Lucifer.  How bad his illness must have been.
He rolls his eyes at the phone, but he can’t help the indulgent grin. He suspects an impending hurricane would be ideal grilling weather in Dean’s mind, but he’s not going to deny its a good idea today. He checks the time stamp, with Benny’s help he can have his work cleared away and the coals settling back to red hot embers perfect for grilling in the hour it will take Dean to double back to the store and return with what will undoubtedly be an overwhelming amount of red meat.
The last message from the encrypted phone was a motel address and the suggestion that Cas come down there in the morning. He had replied to neither.
“Crowley,” she said softly, “is an imbecile. Easy to manipulate and simple to control. I’ve been tying that fool in knots for years.” She seized Dean’s chin, fingernails biting crescents into his skin. “You will tell me what I want to know Dean, one way or another.” The tone and accent of her voice changed suddenly, still sing-song, but dropping into the distinctive cadence that was pure Minnesota. “What you don’t understand is that you’re not the only one who learnt their trade from their family. Daddy had some pretty exacting standards. My brothers and I were well trained. Daddy always said the best hunt was human, but I don’t think even he ever realised just how much more fun it is to play the long game. Far less messy than all that running around in the woods. So you see, I learnt from the very best and then I just got better. I know just what you can do to toy with your prey. And no amount of counselling or well meaning social workers can take that away. All those fools taught me was how to pretend.”
“He rang me from your phone when he couldn’t get an answer from Sam. He saved your life, Dean, and for that I owe him…” Bobby’s voice was strangely brittle, he cleared his throat. “Goddammit, son, you know I don’t believe in psychic bull shit any more than you do, but...”
For a moment which seemed to stretch, they stared at each other, until Dean cleared his throat, “so, condition 2?”  Cas sighed but did not speak, and gave Dean a vaguely mutinous look.  “OK, so let’s work backwards. Everyone is busy telling me you saved my life, but I got no detail.  How were you even there?”
“I think,” Castiel says, “that he has escaped from Quarantine. And I… I don’t know. He can’t stay here for long. I’m surprised they haven’t come looking for him already. I’m sorry Meg, I know this is a huge ask, but I have no-one else… if you don’t want to… ouch!”
The sand glows, ethereal, its colour drained by the moonlight, patches of grass and the deep shadows cast by the dunes inky black and dark in comparison. He is about to dismiss it as a reflection on a wind blown fragment of rubbish, when he sees it again. Moonlight glinting off a reflective surface indeed, but the shadow around it is unmistakably human. He makes a pretence of stretching again and steps back as if he is going into the house, but instead he presses himself back against the smooth, weather beaten wood, watching carefully.
Not as poor as the remaining patient, he thought. Medical humour at its very darkest. His remaining patient was a corpse with a single gunshot wound straight through his heart. His remaining patient was in the morgue, waiting for the less urgent arrival of the coroner.
“I am sorry to keep you from spending time with Sister Margaret and your friends”, based on recent evidence, Castiel has no cause to believe him, the distinction The Leader makes between Meg and his friends is not lost on Castiel either. He suspects that they are marked for one another. The Leader’s robes are dusty where the hem skirts the ground. The swish of the harsh fabric is hypnotic as he moves. They are walking away from the buildings out towards the crop fields and the reed ponds.
“Old ground Cas. We need to get closer. We only have a couple of hours until dawn. We need you in position and me out of here by daybreak. That diner” he was referring to the intended meeting point for his conversation with Raph “is only… what… half an hour from here? That gives you all morning to observe until Raph leaves Adler here alone.”
He thinks of his Baby, the only thing his father had to leave his two sons when he finally succumbed to alcoholism and depression, now sitting in the garage at Bobby’s. He has lovingly restored the ‘67 Chevy Impala and she is a gleaming classic, but monetarily she is a minnow compared to this whale of first world engineering. And yet, Cas seems to scarcely notice, carelessly dropping the rear window after stowing Claire’s purchases and Dean’s kit into the capacious trunk.
“I was glad of Raphael’s strength and Michael’s support, I don’t think I could have signed those papers without them.  It was too much.  Like Gabriel, I felt like we were giving up on him, but he was so obsessed with the idea that she hadn’t taken her own life.  It was obvious he was losing his grip on reality.”
“I’m about to ask you to do something that is definitely not strictly legal. I want you all to know that if you choose to say no, or prefer not to be involved, there is no…”
The man in overall straightens and Castiel realises it is the owner of the fitting firm he met yesterday. He was momentarily thrown by the overalls, yesterday Yatin Banerjee had been wearing a sharply cut suit. “Did Balthazar send you to open up?” he says abruptly, as he recognises Castiel. “He only booked us for the half day today, and I got another job lined up for the afternoon and I’m two men down.” That explains the overalls, Castiel supposes, “I know we are nearly done, but you know Balthazar, he always wants perfect and often changes his mind last minute…”
“You have to… the collar… you have to put it around my neck, now. You have to… my coat…” He slumped further into Dean’s lap, even as Sam burst through the door, with his weapon ready.
It has taken Dean all of ten minutes to win round the pretty blonde teenager he is serving. Her pout gradually diminishing and the initial grunted one word answers stretching into interested questions of her own as he explains the reasons for the stock choices in the Mountain Supplies store. “Benny, the owner, is determined to only carry brands that have proven environmental credentials,” he explains. “He thinks it’s especially important that those relying on snow and ice for their income do everything they can to protect the Earth.” Eat your heart out, Sammy, he thinks, I’m totally selling this environmental shit. His floppy haired, hipster brother would be so proud.
“Centuries? Are you telling me that you are hundreds of years old?” Would that make him a toyboy? He shook himself.
“I guess I didn’t.” He moved forward and pushed past Dean stooping down and retrieving the phone from where it had ceased spinning on the ground. “Hm, it looks as though this too survived unscathed,” he said cleaning it on his sleeve. “I asked for you at the front desk. I have some information. Your colleague,” from the dismissive tone, Dean somehow knew he was referring to Crowley, “told me you were in a meeting and would call me back later.”
Sam shrugged. “There’s a fourth sibling, a brother, 10 years older than Castiel, but the youngest of the three older half-brothers. He vanishes from the records in 1985, but he was never officially reported missing, just upped and left one day. No further mention made. Then there’s a succession of boarding schools for Castiel, periods in England before he gets himself into Oxford… and then does his own vanishing act.”
He felt tears sliding down the sides of his face in twin tracks and running into his ears.  He instinctively tried to raise his hands to wipe at his face only to have them snatch short, sniffing the salty sting back into his throat, he started to cough and the inside of his nose smarted; cold and sharp.
Dean let his head hang forward, the cut over his eye had finally begun to clot. The pain in his ribs wasn’t too bad provided he didn’t try to move, or cough (or breathe, his sarcastic little inner voice added). He huffed slightly. His current situation wasn’t a laughing matter, but he knew from past bitter experience if he did laugh, it was gonna hurt like fuck. They were ignoring him now, he wondered at what point they were gonna figure out they didn’t actually need him anymore.
'I beseech you,' she pleaded again. 'A fate worse than death awaits me at home. If you have any kindness in your hearts, you will take me away from them.'
They finished the call, and Raphael turned his thoughts back to the problem at hand.  The idiots had let Cas give them the slip, and now Balthasar Laduz, the pathetic queer that Cas hung around with was starting to make waves.  It had been hard enough to stop him from coming to the house to visit Cas for the last week.
Cas stirred; the slight alarm in Dean’s voice disturbing his dozing.  He opened his eyes, and Dean dropped his hand onto his leg.  “Stay sleeping,” he murmured quietly.  “Keep your head down.”
By the time the two of them carried three hot drinks back into the media centre that had become HQ, the video conference had already started.
He realises he is stalking her like a hunter approaching skittish prey and he shakes the tension out of his own shoulders. “There you are,” he calls, pushing his voice into the careful cheerful tones of a man who doesn’t quite know what else to say. “You ready to go?”
He flicked forward to the place he had left off. He found it easily, Twain had left the middle east and was onboard ship heading back towards Europe and Dean hadn’t been reading long when he was struck suddenly by the similarity of his own position to the shipboard routines. Iron bars do not a prison make, he mused. He immersed himself in the sheer ‘Twainess’ of it, chuckling at the subtlety and charm of the sailor’s dialogue. He brushed at a smudge in the middle of the page. Not unusual in a book of this age with its tightly packed typesetting to have ink runs. But then as he turned the page he realised with irritation it was getting worse and beginning to make it difficult to read the text. He flicked forward a few pages to check the extent of the damage, the marks became gradually darker, beginning to take on the appearance of lines of text. Brows furrowing he realised what they were. Whoever had written that post-it had done so in situ. These marks were the resultant leaching of ink into the absorbent pages of the book. He pulled the post-it from the back of the book and flicked backwards and forwards, comparing the blotched and crinkled note with the pages, deciphering the gaps in the message. The sound of the deadbolts sliding open on his cell door had him jumping to his feet, with the last sentence he had made sense of ringing through his mind. Watch out for Alastair…
The phone in his outstretched hand began to vibrate, organ music emitting from its speakers. Dean grabbed it quickly swiping it up to his ear. “Yup, Crowley, I’m in the… ah, OK…I’ve left my fob...” he paused listening and looked up across the courtyard, to where Crowley stood just outside the staff entrance.
Castiel, held his coffee mug, enjoying the heat seeping into his fingers.  He glanced again at his phone.  It was way past the time they had arranged to meet and it was not like Anna to be late.
He rounds the corner of the building and realises Cas has been busy in the ten or so minutes he has been with Benny. The grill has been doused with sand and besides a few divots in the soft sand, there is little sign that they were out here. The beach chairs are neatly folded on the stoop and their empty bottles are stashed in a bucket beside the door ready to go for recycling.
“Jean-Paul?”  Raphael sounded mildly confused.  “Oh… you mean the chef… I’m afraid we’ve been rather spoiled up to now.  But with only the two of us to feed it seemed an unnecessary extravagance.”
“The road to hell, Benny… It's not your fault. None of it. I'm just glad it's sorted. You're going home Benny. Back to Andrea. It's all over." Dean laughed, looking more like the carefree young man he should be and Benny wondered at how much he was referring to his own problems. He looked suddenly serious again. "You can call me… when you get out I mean, if you want… you know, I’ll understand if I’ll just be a reminder of this shit show, but I’d like… I mean… only if…”
A fine spray of water, deflected by Bal’s upturned arm under the thundering flow of the shower falls fresh across his exposed skin. “Perfect,” Bal mumbles as he uses his other hand to lift Castiel’s chin. “Right. You. Hop in. Call me if you need anything. I’ll be in the kitchen.” And then he is alone. He looks along the little line of bottles, each one scented with essential oils as he strips off his work clothes.
“Hm,” he stretched his neck, angling to let her reach further.  “Maybe we should save even more water by going straight to bed…”
Reluctantly he had reverted to plan B.  He would inform Laduz that Cas had gone to see college friends, and let him try and track him down.  When the time was right, as Michael returned he would hang his head and admit he had misjudged the situation.  He should have stayed home, Cas was not as calm and sensible as he had assumed… then they would inform the local police he was missing.
Benny chortled as Bass stepped out of the shadows detaching the fine wires from Alastair’s lower back and buttocks. “You shot him in the ass… Man… I’d say your taser skills ain’t improving any, but I can’t say I mind in his case.”
Sam flipped the sun visor down and pushed his butt back in his seat so he could use it as cover. He suspected that the light shining off his windshield was probably obscuring him enough, but he was nothing if not cautious. The diner door swung inward and the awkward figure of the psychiatrist, clumsy on his crutches appeared, followed by Michael, looking a little odd in combats and long sleeved t-shirt, face set in stony determination.
Her lip trembled and her voice cracked slightly and she dabbed her eyes with the now screwed up tissue. Dean reached for the box to offer her a fresh one. She gave him a weak little smile, and he gave her hand a gentle reassuring squeeze.
you are up to it, we’ll just go straight to the Theatre from here. Now, you shower and I’ll start throwing together a little something, unless you need me to keep you company in the bathroom?”
“I can see that,”  Dean murmured.  He reached for his coffee, and Cas shivered as their fingers made the vaguest of contacts.  Get a grip, he told himself.  This was getting out of hand.
“Aw, you're not gonna leave me, Missy. We're just getting acquainted, and I've finally worked out who you are!” Dean grinned at her, his lip tore open again, but he carried on grinning anyway. He had her attention, now. She was watching him intently. “You and your two yahoo brothers. You’re the Benders!”
Dean and Sam exchanged a look. They didn’t know the word was spreading so fast about the still-nameless-Inn.
They stood naked, just holding each other for a moment. Dean let his eyes slide closed, burrowing his nose into the hair just behind Cas’ ear while the surf pounded over the sand and the wind hummed. He wanted to never let go, but he knew he must.
The words break through his thoughts and he snaps his head back round. He can’t help the little surge of jealousy and feels guilty instantly. Dean deserves the world. He’s been generous with his time as it is and if he has a better offer, Castiel has no right to stop him. No matter how much he may want to. Their gazes lock and Castiel isn’t sure what his friend will read on his face, but he can’t break eye contact: he just can’t. Dean is blushing and a little breathless as he blurts out, “Call me later with the deets, sweetheart, you know I can never refuse you anything.”
“What?” he snapped, suddenly becoming aware that Crowley was scrutinising his face with an odd little smirk twisting his bearded little face.
He sees a figure standing in the edge of the dunes, some distance away, but his relief is short lived, although the man is dark haired and tall, he is clearly not Castiel. Dean frowns. It’s a quiet stretch here, and at the crack of dawn, in heavy rain, a stranger’s presence jars. Even more innocuous, Dean recognises the dark object in his hands as a camera with a zoom lens. It’s hardly the weather for photography. He starts towards him, thinking to ask if he has seen Castiel, but the man turns abruptly and disappears back between the dunes.
Cas sniffed suspiciously at the coffee, sipping cautiously, his dark glasses fogging from the rising steam.  Dean lifted them gently off his face and set them on the table.
Anna Milton sighed and stretched her arms to ease the ache between her shoulder blades.  She stared at her own reflection in the floor-to-ceiling windows of her office, her bright red hair muted to a deep maroon by the blackness of the night outside.
He groaned, but raised his head defiantly. Keep ‘em talking, keep ‘em off track, buy himself time. He gave the woman, his best shit-eating grin. “What? Everyone knows Crowley hates paperwork!”
Dean was repacking the trunk,  his disapproval at the haphazard way Cas had thrown their belongings into the trunk communicated with a barely audible tut, and the measured way in which he had removed everything onto the dusty back lot.  At least, Cas thought, he hadn't noticed the absence of his pool cue yet.
Having the information handily uploaded to the laptop was great and all, but Dean worked best from actual paper. There was something about spreading out the case notes that helped him highlight the things that were most relevant and fit them together to tell the story hidden in the mass of information. So with some persuasion, for she thought him a relic of a bygone age, Charlie had provided him with a mobile printer and, as she put it, a quarter acre of rainforest’s worth of paper and he planned to spend the day working.
“Ah, yes, “ Victor made a play of checking his notes.  “You, Mr Valentine rang the local PD on behalf of the family.”
He is lost in the memory as he climbs out and opens the trunk, he hears Cas laughing, so instead of taking the groceries straight into the kitchen he hugs one of the paper bags to his hip and strolls down the side of the house to the beachside.
'Impala and Grace need new shoes, and I could do with a new dagger. We can go into the town tomorrow, speak to Gabriel about the wig, then see Benny about the rest.'
He let his fingers wander, playing with his own senses, easing the tension and the longing into arousal, imagining it was Dean’s touch and not his own sending little shock-waves of pleasure down his spine to pool in his gut. He let his hands slide lower and lower, tweaking at his own nipples, teasing himself, letting the feeling build until he could hardly stand it. Only once he was panting did he grope for the shower gel, using its slick coconut scent as lubricant to ease the glide of his fist, allowing his other hand to wander, pinching and massaging and tapping wherever felt good.
Cas tapped his arm and he looked up. Cas was smiling almost nostalgically. They kissed slowly, mostly smooching. Kiss, snuggle, soft giggle, repeat.
Cas nodded.  Dean headed into the restrooms himself, taking his time to wash and freshen up. When he came back out, there was no sign of Cas.  He walked around the little forecourt and looked up the road, thinking maybe he had started to walk back to Baby without him.  “Cas?  Cas buddy?”  He walked round the back of the building, the ground behind the gas station was rough but solid. Exasperated he checked his phone again, but there was still no signal.  “Dammit Cas,”  he muttered under his breath and walked back into the tiny shop. The old lady appeared again, blinking into the light as the curtain of beads separating the ’staff only’ from view parted around her head. “Have you seen…”  he started to ask, just as the double song of the contact strip and a sweep of headlights denoted a vehicle cruising onto the forecourt.
By the time the main course arrived the bare-bones of  the next day were decided upon. Kali would spend the morning drafting a statement with Cas and they would present it to the DA in the afternoon’s meeting. The legal team were confident that with Cas refusing to support the prosecution’s case, effectively corroborating Dean’s story the only action the DA could take would be to drop the charges. Dean should be eligible for instant release. The only complication was the business with the fight during recreation time.
Dean doesn’t quite know what to say. Cas has been weird with him since their last day on the slopes.
'Dean wrote to me of his plans and begged me to come if I could.' He held up a hand at Castiel's horrified expression. 'Do not be concerned, our letters are all in code. Should anyone have come upon it, they would find only an invitation from a friend to visit his estate for the lambing.'
There was a scrunching sound as the receiver was obviously passed across and Michael found himself smiling slightly as the ‘young lady’ identified herself. “It’s Kasia,” she babbled, not waiting for him to respond, a mixture of pride and excitement evident in her voice. “I’ve opened it. I suddenly remembered Antman and I thought it was worth a try, so I found one of the repairmen and got him to bring me some glue and a blow torch…”
“By the Thursday he was much calmer,”  Raphael cut across Michael, who had opened his mouth to speak.  “The shock had thrown him off balance, obviously, but perhaps… my only regret… perhaps I missed the signs.”
“It was a forum post about a dark-haired man with intense blue eyes, who seemed to know things without being told.” Dean pulled the post up on his phone.
The silence stretched.  Finally, with a reluctant sigh, Sam said flatly, “E-mail me everything you got and I’ll see what I can do.”
The silence grew between them as they stared at each other, but it was strangely comfortable.  It was Dean who broke the gaze, he pushed the pillows up against the headboard and patted the bed beside him in invitation.
Looking quickly about him, Alastair slid into the vacant seat, bypassing the fake screen lock. He kept one eye on the CCTV monitors, typing rapidly. By the time the supervisor returned he had uninstalled his spy program and removed the USB stick from the back of the CPU, locking the computer down for real.
Cas quietly followed suit, stretching, he stepped out onto the dark roadside, feeling in his pocket for the little smart phone Dean had bought him, shaking it to activate the torch function.  He joined Dean to peer at the immaculate engine bay, utterly unaware of what he was looking at. He felt the creeping flare of admiration as strong hands checked over the various components, swift and skilled.  It reminded him of watching a veterinarian checking a thoroughbred.
He read it again.  Brief.  He would need to contact the local sheriff’s office.   He stretched across his desk and using his pencil eraser as a stylus he dialled the numbers on his desk phone.  It whirred, and clicked, a series of old-fashioned sounds, that suggested the telephone exchange was old tech.  “Jackson County.”
As if by magic, the laptop repeated another self-satisfied little ping. “She may be a pain, but she’s a very talented pain,” Bal murmured as the two hovered close together to scroll through and read the phone’s contents.
“Seems a bit thorough for a simple mugging,” the woman who appeared in the doorway was tiny, but she made up for it with bristling aggression that made Garth want to shield his shins.
Usually Castiel refused to be rushed, but today he felt a particular need to stake his claim, so he let Dean push back against his hand and added a second finger the moment Dean swore he was ready. With his other hand, he reached around to feel Dean's hardness, wet at the tip and clearly aching for touch. He wrapped his fingers loosely and let Dean move his hips back and forth, finding pleasure from Castiel's hands in both directions. Finally he determined himself prepared, and Castiel joined him on the bed, lying on his back and coating his manhood in the oil before putting it aside.
They’d always wanted a dog, but it never seemed like the right time for it between keeping their cover, and their jobs, and their amenities intact.
“Evening, gentlemen,” he said. Dean, although he’d already heard the man’s voice over the door, suddenly realized how raspy it was. “What do you have?”
Meg had brought the encrypted cell phone with her into Cas’ room.  She had been woken just after four am, by the insistent buzzing.  It had not been Bal, but Cas’ brother Gabriel.  She had been initially extremely cautious, as they had not spoken before, but no-one else had this number.  It seemed things had taken a sudden and alarming turn. She woke Cas as carefully as she could. Closing her hand gently over his mouth, in case he shouted or screamed.  He had been so shaken after Adler and his brother had spent several hours in his room pouring poison into his ears, that she had doubled the dose of his sleeping meds.  He would be groggy.
Cas murmured slightly, the sound dragging him back from his thoughts. Dean automatically worried, but his eyelids were still and his face untroubled. Without real thought Dean leant forward and brushed an errant strand of hair away from Cas’ face, the back of his fingers stroked at the soft skin of his temple. Cas’ lips twitched slightly, and his breathing hitched into a sigh, but he simply burrowed deeper into the pillow and continued to sleep.
His hands slipped down, and he felt the texture of rope as it burned into his palms.  He swung away from the bank, his feet and lower legs sucked along the gully by the pressure of the water.  Ignoring the pain in his hands, he used his upper body strength to haul himself up, and managed to brace his legs against the bank, wrapping the rope around his back and leaning into it.  He paused, breathing heavily.
She had barely made it across the room when Charlie barrelled into her. “We found them, Kashkoo. We only goddamn found them! Amy’s ringing the team with the news, so I’ve come for celebratory espresso.”
“A shorter day will be less tiring,” Cas informed Sam, whose lips were twitching as he resisted the urge to laugh.  “Dean can rest all weekend.”  He looked from one to the other with a business like little smile.  “Good, then we’re agreed.”  And that as they say, was that.  Dean and Sam sat quietly either side of the kitchen table, one working through the case files, the other his e-mails, while Cas kept them both supplied with coffee and occasionally commented on what Dean was reading through.  By the time lunch had come and gone, Dean didn’t actually want to go to the station, but he’d made such a huge play of it, he wasn’t going to back down.
“Maybe, because when Cas suggested it, we all flew into a collective dipshit?” Bal said softly. “Besides this strikes me more of Michael than Cas… he would go out of loyalty, but it’s Michael who feels he has things to prove.”
It’s the last day of his first week coaching the KindieKids when Sam rings him just as he is about to go and grab a shower. Just to annoy him, Dean puts him on speaker and takes him to the bathroom with him, making the excuse that there’ll be no hot water left if he waits.
“I think this would be better explained in person.” The voice sounded even more gravelly over the crackling phone line. “Would it be inappropriate to suggest lunch?” He did not wait for an answer. “I could meet you in Fielding Square gardens if you are available now.”
He tweaks the plan again, cataloguing the final few items. He too is excited to open the crates and put the final touches to the exhibit, but that must wait. Today is Bal’s birthday and he has promised his best friend his full and undivided attention for the evening. A meal in his favourite restaurant, a little pretentious fusion place that Castiel has never understood the appeal of, tickets to Hamilton and, if he knows Bal as well as he thinks he does, they will end up in the club, while Bal tries to convince him that the only way to get over his recent messy break-up with Bart is to jump right back on the horse.
Dean crossed off another day on his wall calendar.  10 days now.  The cell door was locked, and he could hear the cart moving steadily along the walkway outside, Tuesday was a library day and Benny was in charge as ever, moving between the cells exchanging books.  Dean picked up his own current book, but his eyes were not focussed on the black on white of the printed words… instead, his mind was preoccupied with memories.
Dean jumped awake as the hatch shot open and a tin tray rattled across the concrete. A disembodied voice called “Breakfast!” The disorientation lasted only seconds, the solid feel of the book under his shoulder confirming that he had not been dreaming about events during the night. He sat up slowly and retrieved the tray, setting it onto the bunk, watching the coffee that had spilt during its slide across the floor soak into a pair of anaemic looking hash browns that lay on an unappetising bed of reconstituted scrambled egg. He glanced surreptitiously at the bug eye, the soft green glow had returned. He began folding his blanket, gazing accusingly at the book sitting benignly on his bunk, its purpose unfathomable to him.
As ever please point out any inconsistencies, typos, grammar slips or whoopsies... I hope you enjoy and thanks for all the encouragement so far...
He wasn’t sure when he fell asleep, the warmth and the rocking motion of the drive, combining with sheer exhaustion and the numbing effect of the pills to overcome the pain and discomfort. One minute he was gazing at the road stretching ahead in the lights, listening to Dean softly humming along to Def Leppard, or Metallica or whatever track was playing low on the tape deck, and the next he was jolting awake with a start as the engine died away, and the bright halogen of a security light hit his face.
It cannot be, and then he realises. The alarm. The alarm was off when they came in this morning. In his distress he didn’t realise, but he is sure he set it last night when he left.
He feigned confusion, all the while thinking quickly. Three sets of legs in his peripheral vision. Two heavy booted. Stitch creased. Uniform Pants. The third… heeled, delicate looking. Not bad ankles as it happened. Two guards and a woman? What the fuck was going on?
He is so lost in admiration and awe at the sleeping man next to him, he misses the change in his breathing and it’s far too late to try and pretend he wasn’t doing the creepy sleep watching thing when he realises Cas is staring back at him. Irises flooding with an ocean as pupils recede to pinpricks when Dean moves to fake a yawn and his shadow shifts.
Victor Henriksen did not like this case.  He did not like Raphael Angel.  The Angel’s were powerful.  Old money.  Connected.  And this case stank like sour milk on a hot porch.  Something just did not add up, and Victor’s inner bullshit alarm was ringing like a klaxon.  When your grieving brother goes missing within a few days of losing a close friend and colleague you don’t wait over a week to report it.  In fact, Victor was fairly convinced that if he glanced at his notes, Balthazar Laduz hadn’t been threatening to file a report, the family would not have bothered contacting the authorities.
He knows he has no reason to be jealous of the friendship Dean has with the burly cajun sailor. It’s in Dean’s nature to befriend people, and he’s flirtatious with all his friends. But knowing and feeling are very different things and he would have been unable to help the green eyed monster if he’d known Dean was spending the afternoon with Benny..
That day he withdrew his daily limit from the ATM, bought a ticket to LA with his AMEX and then he threw his old life away into the trashcan of a fast food concession on a draughty bus terminal just outside New York. Plastic leaves a trail and Castiel had no wish to be found by anyone who might choose to look for him.
He blinked.  Dean was staring at him, still holding the back of his hand lightly in a surprisingly gentle grip, shaking two pills out and balancing them on Cas’ fingertips. He caught his gaze and smiled, giving a tiny reassuring nod.  Cas looked away, and pulled his throbbing hands into his lap, staring at the little round white tabs.
The dark head snapped up and he found himself pierced by that intense blue gaze. “That’s if they didn’t Cuckoo Nest my ass, before either of us had chance to blink.”
“Well Dean, this is quite an honour for us to pop your festival cherry so to speak, welcome to Cheltenham.”
He grinned, she might be battered and torn and smelling vaguely of … ok… he’d keep his counsel on that one… but she was still 100% his Meg. “You know that whole scene doesn’t make any sense…” he said, as casually as he could, working hard to keep the tremor out of his voice, “All that technology... they would have a much more advanced way to dispose of trash than a giant cephalopod…which, by the way, would have been crushed along with the junk.”
“You mean from the side of the highway where you let him escape?” Raphael’s voice was low and dangerous.
“Oh, that’s just genius!” She sighed, but he could hear the beginnings of a smile in her voice. “What are you now? Fucking Luke Skywalker? I hate to break it to you, Cas, but this motel doesn’t have any garbage shoots…”
Roman leant forward slightly. “Oh, I know, Michael. All those years of being overlooked and finally, finally, you have a perfectly deserving punchbag for all that impotent rage. Right in front of you and once again, you have to push it back. Still. Plenty of practice, repressing your rage and being a good little boy is second nature to you now.”.
Alastair continued to needle at Dean, and he had a little set of cronies amongst the prisoners.  A group Benny warned him were predatory, all killers, nearly all sex offenders, Dean had managed to avoid them, for the most part.  The main danger points in his day were the evening shower and the period in the morning when nearly everyone else was on work duties. Dean preferred to stay in his cell, reading his way through the prison library or going over the letters he had received from Sammy until he memorised them.  He also struck up a slightly awkward friendship with the young guard, a rookie called Aaron Bass, talking easily about books, and recommending titles to each other.
“The mother, she was wealthy in her own right, orphan daughter of Lord Digby Montague, and for once they have a little money to match the status and connections.  Daddy Montague was a canny fellow, offloaded the money pit country pile to the National Trust and made some wise investments, including a house in London, which is probably worth a few million on its own.  We're not talking luxury yacht set wealthy, but certainly enough to be comfortable and never need to worry financially. The grandfathers' will puts everything in trust for Sara Novak, nee Lady Sara Montague or her descendants, in this case, her only son, one Castiel Novak. He was just a baby when she died, the others were more than well provided for by the father’s estate. The will was very specific in its terms and it’s all his and his alone. Whatever drives Dean’s new psychic buddy, it isn’t financial gain. He doesn’t take anything from the people he ‘helps’ because he doesn’t need to.”
They were both still asleep as she approached, and she hesitated for a moment.  The handsome boy who had come into the station first was stretched out along the front bench, his long legs tangled in blankets.   Her heart ached briefly as she thought of her own beautiful boy, her Davy.  He looked so much like him, green eyes and dirty blonde hair, chiselled good looks.  Her beautiful Davy.  His cheeky smile peeked at her from under his baseball cap in the sun-soaked memories, decades old, of Saturday afternoons.  She sighed and clunked the enamel mug gently against the glass.  Her Donald would have told her she was a sentimental old fool for wanting to help these boys, but they were both such beautiful boys. She would have kissed his bald head and told him he was a cynical old coot.
Michael did not leave Cas to himself at all for the rest of the day.  All he wanted to do was check his e-mails and messages and find out what was going on at the firm, but Michael seemed determined to keep him under observation.
He realises he hasn’t responded and Cas has looked away, a faint blush on the one cheek left turned towards Dean as Cas stares out into the street. Crap. Now the silence is awkward, Dean clears his throat to speak, but Cas is already pressing on. “Look I better go find Claire, before she gets in even more trouble. Her grandmother hates me enough as it is, and I’m sure she would relish the chance to throw charges of child endangerment at me. I’ll come back at closing time, say half-six and collect this little lot. We can grab a drink and I’ll give you a lift to your hotel.”
Dean is beat. He just spent the last twenty minutes shuffling on his knees helping his little troopers remove their skis and fasten their normal footwear. It’s the end of the week and for some of them it’s their last day, so he has been hugged and kissed and even had to wipe away a few tears as the parents came to collect their kids.
"Crowley, I presume? That's what I get for dropping you as my publisher and selling my soul to the devil," he grumbled.
His utterly frustrating, impotent role.  For Cas’ sake, he had to stick to his story.  It wasn’t too hard, with the exception of the fictitious five grand trip to Mexico, it was factually correct.  He slammed his fist into the table when he heard about Marcy, and the officer stationed outside the tiny interview room had peered through the reinforced safeguarding glass with a look of alarm, until Spengler raised his arm in supplication.
“It was Gordon Walker, that set fire to the house.  He had this statuette amongst his ‘souvenirs’.  It was an angel.  A china angel, that Mum bought when she was pregnant with Dean.  She used to tell him it would watch over him when she put him to bed at night.  Well, when I was born, he put it in my nursery, and told Mum it would watch over me when he couldn’t.”  Sam gave a rueful little smile.  “Looking out for me, right from the very beginning.”  The smile dropped and he shuddered involuntarily.  The years had made this no easier.  “That bastard killed our mother and then when our father tracked him down, he killed him, too. Dean had to carry that secret around on his own for nearly a year, because Gordon caught him down in that cellar with the angel in his hands and he told him if he ever told anyone, or tried to get away that he would kill me too.”
"Oh, you are unbelievable!" Sam snapped. "You are actually ogling him, right now, aren't you?! I know that tone. You nearly kill yourself, just to prove how tough and independent you are. And instead of admitting you've been a complete jackass, you are hitting on the good Samaritan..."
“It’s OK, Jen. It happens to the best of us.” The words were meaningless, she hardly dared ask, as she feared she knew the answer. “What were you working on, Jen?” She kept her voice light.
He creeps forward, he can see absolutely nothing. The ground feels gritty under his hands and knees, sharp stones scratching into his skin. It’s a small price to pay. Behind him he hears a shout and he can’t help but speed up. Then the ground is gone from beneath him and even as he is falling he hears the blaring sound of the general alarm.
The decision of committing his son to a mental institution weighed heavily on Chuck. The pain of it obvious as he talked to Anna.  His other son, Gabriel, had been furious with them all, furious that his father had ignored his pleas to keep Lucifer at home.
It’s far from a normal sign off to Benny, highlighted by the stunned pause and loud guffaw from the other end as he disconnects the call. Seeking to cover his embarrassment and hide the blush rising up his neck and threatening to overrun into his cheeks, he completely forgets himself and takes a massive gulp of chocolate that is way too hot, simultaneously scalding his mouth and throat, choking and coughing most of it over the table, himself and Cas.
The downward pressure on the bed shifted and he tilted into the contact, lips parting slightly in anticipation. Tantalisingly close, as if mere molecules were separating them, the click of the door opening was impossibly loud. The weight lifted from the bed beside him as Cas jumped upright.
The forensic pathologist, Jane Coleman and lead SOCO, Steve Groves had arrived shortly after the briefing. Dean glanced at the clock, acutely aware that it was nearly two hours since he had crashed Castiel Novak onto the ground. He would just have to wait, this meeting was throwing up some interesting discussions.
But he needs to do neither, his face splitting into a wide smile as his friend greets him with a relieved whisper, “Castiel!”
A battered old pickup so dusty and rust covered that it was impossible to be sure what colour it was swept past the building to the scrubby back lot, Baby trailing like an outboard dinghy in its wake.
Bela shook her head. 'My reticule has all I require for now.' Castiel nodded and spurred Grace into a gallop, while Dean followed quickly behind. Once they had made sufficient distance from the carriage, they slowed the pace to a trot, and Bela spoke again. 'I did not wish to say anything in front of them, but I do have a place to go if you will take me there. A good friend of mine is a novice at the nunnery outside ---. She will help me.'
“Cas is right and just because they can't carry out the first part, doesn’t mean they can’t use the second part of their plan,” Sam added. “They've already tried to take out every witness, everyone who has anything to do with this. But even if Benny is working for Raphael, if Adler was involved with this fight, there’s no way an inmate could get to him in solitary without help."
He opened Skype, it’s familiar bubble sound echoing from the tinny speaker over the continuing documentary. He paused the video, and smiled. His brother was apparently home already. He pinged the invite and waited for the call to accept.
Benny and Sam were just charging the front veranda, and Bobby and Ash were sighting their weapons on the rear exit when the whole world seemed to explode into light. The targets ahead of them disintegrating before they managed a single shot.
Sam sighed and tried one last time to at least appeal to his wife who was finally making her way out of the suite. “I’m sorry, honey, I was just trying to be considerate…”
“You’ve been spying on Claire!” His own interactions with Charlie and her wife Dorothy are all about Star Wars marathons, comicons and epic gaming nights, but he knows what they specialise in.
The round of laughs and negatives was immediate, Mark explained, “He hated it all. His mobile phone…”
“You earned it fair and square, brother. Besides. I kinda have a favour to ask myself. I know you’re probably all booked up already and if you say no, honestly, it won’t matter, but…”
He wakes to the sound of the alarm bell ringing. His limbs feel heavy and his brain is slow, his thoughts sluggish, as if his head is full of cotton wool. He swallows and tries to sit up, gripping at the arm of the sofa he is lay upon when his head spins and a wave of nausea and dizziness has him slumping sideways.
He needed to shave. He dragged his eyes open reluctantly and yawning stretched down to retrieve the phone, still insistently jangling to tell him it was 8 am. He flicked the screen and padded softly to the en-suite. He set the shower to stun, and stepped under the tepid flow, jerking his body awake. He’d given himself a lie in. Now he was going to have to gun it to get to work. He needed to be ready to brief the team with Crowley at 9.
The attorney nodded.  “And they searched the house, grounds and the Angel offices, interviewed anyone they felt relevant... all I should add with the full co-operation of the family, so I think if that’s all gentlemen, both Michael and Raphael are busy men, and there is considerable upset at Angel Inc, as I am sure you can understand.”
“Hey,” Dean said softly. “Takes two to tango, buddy. And I hate to point this out, because it makes me feel like a total princess, but you did save my life today.” He checked his watch, was it really only 18 hours since he had been innocently surfing on the beach. “Correction: Yesterday.”
Joe Lomax shook himself and blinked the blur of sleep from his eyes a couple more times.  A chipped white ceramic mug emblazoned with a badge logo hit the table in front of him, and some of the sludgy brown fluid that passed for coffee in Lusk sloshed into a dark pebble on the formica in front of him.  “Thanks,”  he muttered, sitting up and stretching his aching muscles.
Drifting back to the sound of the door clicking softly open, he felt the sun on his face. His eyes settled on the unappetising hospital breakfast which was still on the side table, along with the menu selection sheet he had half-heartedly ticked. However wonderful the NHS health care was, however professional and caring its staff, and Dean had to admit they were wonderful, the catering left a lot to be desired. In short, it was fucking terrible.
Agent Lomax was amazed.  He had been searching for incidents using the description of Castiel Angel, not really expecting any of them to bear fruit.  Having spent the last three days proving his own thesis by gradually excluding each report, he had found one that was both intriguing and worrying.
Dean swallowed, rolled his head, letting his neck crack. “Well, blow me. Your Pa taught you everything he knew!" He filled his voice with amused sarcasm. "No wonder we’re riding to hell in a handcart. He couldn’t hunt his way out of a penny arcade game…Beaten by some off-duty hicksville cop and a woman to boot!” Mocking her father’s death with a healthy dollop of misogyny. Feel them buttons, see how hard I can push, he thought.
Benny is still talking, uncharacteristically carrying the one-sided conversation. “I know the fee is nowhere near as much as your one to one sessions and family coaching, but I can maybe bump it up a bit… especially as I can only let you have one aide.”
He watches Dean pretending he hasn’t seen Claire swiftly snatch a fry away from his plate, where only moments before he gently slapped the back of her wrist with the flat of his fingers to prevent her marauding hands.
Dean worried at his lip.  Cas lifted his head cautiously and blinked at him from under the cover of the blanket.  “I dunno Cas,  he might not recognise you.  Jesus, we should have bleached your hair or something.”
“No sir, we haven’t seen Mr Angel.  I’ll check the queue for you, sir, in case he’s decided to join it again.”
Bal, with his stable of paramours, will never understand that sometimes, a man would rather just stretch his legs alone.
He flicked a glance at the display in the centre console, the call was from the office, his own line. “Michael Angel,” he was impressed with how calm his own voice sounded, considering the state of his nerves.
“I knew I should have gone to the airport,” Cas snapped. “I’m so stupid, I shouldn’t have let Gabe talk me out of it.”
He stopped when he saw the telltale black rubber streaks of his own skid, gouged deep into the flat top, glistening back at him in the headlights. Maybe the guy had run off, spooked.
On the early breaking news, before the FBI had descended, they had shown a scrappy old farmhouse, a car graveyard and a straggle of disorganised law enforcement vehicles and ambulances. Among all the chaos, there had been a young girl, grimy, dressed in clothes more at home on Little House on the Prairie stood quietly watching. There’d been no mention of her later, just the manhunt for the second brother and more and more revelations about the contents of the house. The officer was being hailed as a hero, shooting the old man dead and putting his son in the hospital. Gradually the press had got bored, especially when the ‘hero’ refused all comment, remaining grimly tight-lipped about the whole affair.
Missy and Lee turned their heads, almost in unison and for the first time, with their eyes similarly gleaming and predatory, Dean could see the likeness. “We’re running out of time,” Missy said flatly. “It’s time to act.”
“I would have to wear the torq to hide from the other daemon. I find it nearly impossible not to obey Her with it on.”
He jumped slightly as she deliberately bumped her arm against the doorway to announce her entrance.  “You dint have to do those, sweet boy.”
“Yeah, well they’re either collectively crazy, or we got unusual troubles. But I think I know what Dean is doing. Remember El Paso? Well, we listen, we cut the power and then we give him fifteen before we move in.”
The vaguely contrite look was reforming into something more exasperated.  “I followed you.  All the way from your work to your flat.  From your flat to the wine bar and then I waited outside, for you to come out and then… then, I lost you briefly...,”  he swallowed again and began fiddling with the blanket on the bed, his fingers inches from Dean’s hand.
“Well first, I need you to track my cell phone, but to do that, you’ll have to hack into my provider’s network files, because I don’t have a tracker program installed. Can you do that?”
He let the clunk of metal on wood and the gentle click of the hammer explain just what awkward might entail.
For a while they were silent.  Then Cas’ stomach gave a little growl and he carefully undid the little metal clips and opened the lid. “You know you may have to re-think some of your nicknames for me,” he observed dryly, swallowing to hide the little crack in his voice.  “I over took you on the playroom height chart before I reached puberty.”
Missy had barely had time to regain her seat after putting the canister of tea away when Crowley’s door opened and he strode from his office. “Sorry Missy, can you clear those file papers for me. File it all in pending and if anyone asks I’m still investigating. I’ll be back in an hour.”
Mrs Kunsberger led Dean, via the shop, out into her husband’s workshop. His face brightened as the tube lighting revealed the extent of it in a series of increasingly bright flashes. She laughed, a sound far younger than her years, at the gleam in his eyes as he set the register down on the workbench and took it in.  It was a mechanic’s wet dream.
Castiel fell asleep, somewhere along the route, exhaustion tugging his eyes shut, despite his best efforts to stay aware and look for outs. His only chance was that She too would become exhausted and need to rest. Then he might be able to find the key and slip away from Her. Even if it meant never finding his coat, he might have somewhere else he could bear to be, now. A vicarious life is better than this. Better than no life at all.
Michael felt his cell phone ringing in his pocket.  He wriggled slightly in the driver’s seat of the Lexus he had happened to find fueled up and ready in the garage. He made a mental note to give the valet company a damn good tip next time he paid up. It was clean, fueled and in tiptop condition, the meaty engine purring and the internal climate controls set at a perfect 72 degrees, making the journey back to the office comfortable if not relaxed.
They all looked up startled as Dean shouted. “Since when does my brother have a fucking tracker on my phone!?”
“And Adler...”  He paused to look at Raphael.  “It would be unfortunate if Henrikson or some other branch of the law were to reach Castiel first.  I don’t like to think what might happen if he was in a position to actually tell anyone his side of the story…”
Dean gave that little huffing laugh and those surprisingly gentle hands smoothed over a stubborn wrinkle in the bedspread.  “Being raised by an ex-marine with limited patience, neatness tends to be habit forming.”  The smile this time was a little weak, and the corner of the perfect bow lips twitched downwards slightly as their eyes met.  A shaft of sunlight slid across the angular face as he turned giving the moss green eyes an almost luminous quality in the dark quiet of the motel room.  Dean looked nervous and slid the tip of his tongue along the line of his lip.  Cas found himself staring at it. “It was just a stupid joke, forgive me.  I... I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.  I …  You don’t have to tell me anything…” he started to say, but Dean cut him off with a wave of his hand.
It was a pleasant afternoon, the May sun was warm, but the air was crisp and devoid of the humidity that often accompanied warm weather in the capital. Dean took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves, as he strolled out across the courtyard towards the road. The gardens lay in the centre of the neighbouring square; it was strictly speaking open only to residents, but Dean had already decided that if need be he would simply flash his warrant card.
“So, Ellen says, if Bobby wants to wear his trucker hat to go watch Hamilton he can sit two rows over because she won’t sit with him. Jo says they spent all of the last day packing and unpacking it from the case until she intervened and hid it.”
If Dean had thought that his normal cell was devoid of luxuries it was nothing compared to ISO. He stood patiently as the shackles were removed and stared about him at flat grey concrete. The bunk was a solid extension of the wall with a coated rubber mattress a few inches thick and a three-foot square concrete screen barely hid the toilet from the viewing hatch in the door. He winced slightly as the slam of the door ricocheted off the four solid walls and jangled the remnants of his concussion-induced headache. No guard station to watch through the bars to alleviate the boredom, or view of the outside sky to judge the passage of time just the insides of a grey box. To boot it was a space devoid of all noise until he moved and could hear the crinkle of his own clothes, the silence actually rang in his ears.
But despite the torq burning at his neck and the fear churning at his gut, he could not regret it. He had felt more alive in the last few hours with Dean Winchester than he had in all the decades he had spent in Her company, since She stole him from the sea. And She could not take his memories or the pleasure they would bring him no matter how far away She took him.
The door opens onto a long corridor. An empty blank stretch of concrete. There are doors along one side, each identical to the one he has just opened. The roof stretches away at an angle, high above him. Bare industrial bulbs hanging at regular intervals. He is as trapped here as he is in his cell, so his only option is to keep moving until there are no more walls, until there is no roof, between him and the sky.
Michael was watching her intently.  She couldn’t quite make out his expression in her peripheral vision, but his eyes were focussed solely on her.  She was not entirely sure what was happening, but she felt deeply uncomfortable.  Something about the brothers’ behaviour was not quite right.
He sucks a soft mark into Cas’ neck, as he valiantly tries to explain. “Borborygmus. It’s the - ah - medical term for a rumbling stomach.”
At this point, his back up had arrived and others made the arrest and began dealing with a passing motorist who had stopped on the shoulder a little way away.
He dropped his head back, understanding suddenly.  “If Raph thought he knew anything he might try to have him killed…and if he suddenly got a real good lawyer Raph would smell a rat… oh God. Are you sure he’s safe?”
“It’s definitely not Marcy’s spare room,”  Cas observed, dropping carefully onto the bed and testing the mattress.  He carefully avoided looking at the ships wheel coffee table, inscribed with HMS Titanic, which had last set him off in spasms of painful laughter.  The muscles of his cheeks still ached slightly from the pull of laughing so hard for so long.  “But I guess the bed is comfy enough… hey, bed: ‘Singular’” he snapped his head round to stare at Dean, who blushed.  Stepping backwards fingers hovering over the handle of the bathroom door.
“Eat with you, eat alone, it’s all the same to me,” she muttered, but he knew her well enough already to sense her pleasure at the invitation.  “Tomorrow’s going to be a busy day, Sam Winchester, and you’ve left your wife coping on her own long enough, you best go and make sure she’s willing to have a guest.”
“Yes you were.” The man’s eyes are flecked grey like slate, and Cas finds it hard to hold his gaze. “And that might mean that my colleagues in NYPD were mistaken, of course.” Mooney leaves the double meaning of the sentence hanging in the silence between them. Letting it grow into something uncomfortable. Oh, if only he really knew, he is messing with the master’s apprentice on this one. Castiel was taught by the best, he can outwait glaciers. Eventually, the detective cracks. “If you were in my shoes, Novak, what would you think? How would it look to you?”
Claire is quiet on the way home and shrugs reluctant agreement when Cas suggests she come with him into the city, but they do have a good day in the end. She demolishes a tower of waffles and overly creamed coffee when they stop off for breakfast en route. He lets her shop alone for the morning, handing over his credit card, so she is fully occupied while he hides in a bookstore in lieu of his non-existent ‘business’. Then after lunch, he takes her ice skating. She is as natural on the ice as she is on the slopes and he sees Meg in the way she laughs and dances around him, in a way that both hurts and comforts him bone-deep.
“Are you sure you’re all right Anna?  You look so…”  Castiel cut into her thoughts again, tiny crinkles appeared between his eyebrows as he sourced the word he was looking for, head cocked to one side in a curiously bird-like gesture.  It was a common mannerism, she had noticed.  He did it often when he was trying to make sense of the world. “...troubled.”
Vaguely, through the buzzing in his ears, he heard the roar of a familiar engine.  “Hey, Assbutts!” The hick in front of him suddenly flopped sideways, his head snapping against his own shoulder under the impact of something brandished by what he realised through his hazy vision was an enraged Castiel.  “Let him go.  Now!”
“You’re wondering why.” He confirmed her unspoken question. “I can’t touch the Angel case. I go near it… well… my career as an agent is already probably over, but I might even screw up the case… the last thing we need is his defence portraying me as some crazed vengeful agent. I need something to do, I quietly sit out my suspension, do nothing for weeks on end, I'm gonna go crazy. This I can do. If I can’t take that bastard down, I can at least do something to get some good out of this.” He took a slug of coffee and Jody silently re-filled his mug letting him talk. “Lomax was a good agent, Jody, more than that... hell, he was a good man. He didn’t deserve… Joe and I, we talked quite a bit. The agency was more than just a job for him, it was something he had wanted to do before he knew what an agent was and he was prepared to lose it all, his lifelong dream, just because it was the right thing to do. It cost him his life."
It was too much, Cas finally felt himself breaking. He knew. Meg knew exactly where he was. There was no way this message was from Meg, but nor were the earlier ones. He scrolled back up and there it was. The obvious glaring error. The thing that had made him feel so uneasy, the little nagging thing his subconscious had noticed.
"Sorry, Cas, I shoulda warned you about this place. The owner Ellen is married to my Uncle Bobby, apart from Sam and Eileen, they're all the family I got, so, oh God, apart from my goddaughter Cara, and her mothers. They're like family too... shit, I'm babbling like an idiot. Do you have family? Are you on holiday here or... I mean it's a small place, everybody knows everybody else and you had no car, so I'm guessing you must be staying in town somewhere..."
He side-stepped with a groan of pain and seized her chin, pinching hard with his fingers and twisting until her face met his. “ENOUGH!” he shouted. He should have known better. Meg didn’t care that spitting in his face was the obvious move, hell, it was her only move and she was long past bothered about resorting to cliche. She had never been good at backing down. Never.
He shrugged.  “Ok, so right back in the beginning, some guy decides Dad has conned him, felt he’d been short-changed at the garage.  Some repair work, I don’t know the detail of it.  Dad’s having none of it, throws the guy out of his workshop and refuses to give him his money back.  So this guy, well he doesn’t take no for an answer.  Dean says he remembers Mom talking to this ‘friend’ of Dad’s, giving him coffee and offering him dinner until Dad comes home and then… well, Dean just remembers it all getting real loud and the man didn’t stay to dinner.”
“You know what this means, my Lord,” Alastair’s voice, sibilant, full of what was to follow, made Dean’s skin crawl, “Stand and lead the way.”
“Drop your hands down behind your back. One at a time.” As he moved his arms into position, he watched the shadows around him, they were thickening and getting darker as the man moved closer, Dean tensed ready to strike and something hit him with terrific force right at the base of his already tender skull. Groggy and stunned he fell forward, just bringing his hands round in time, hearing a metallic scrape on concrete, he had just enough time to realise it was the cuff around his wrist, clattering past his own nose as he hit the floor of the tunnel. The last thing he saw was his own shoes and socks, a few feet away.
Lettuce MacArthur had died of slow blood loss, exactly like Drew Nicholls. Her heart had been missing, exactly like Drew Nicholls. However, her arms were not marked with bruises, nor was her arm a pin cushion. A single point of entry, straight into the vein. Administered, in Jane Coleman’s not so humble opinion, by someone with some surgical or medical skill.
Cas shook his head, but he smiled anyway. And turned his head towards the sea. Nostrils flaring slightly as he sniffed at the breeze.
Dean is frantic by the time he reaches the road into town. His cell beeps, as he clears the dead zone through the dunes. He risks glancing at it as he drives. Cas. Oh, thank god. One hand steady on the wheel as he flicks open the message.
He cleared his throat, “Garth has offered to take us into town.”  Dean looked at him blankly. “For the parts.  You know Garth.  Hot date boy.” Dean blinked at him, and Cas pressed on aware he was beginning to babble. “He came by this morning to check if we needed a ride.  He’s a nice kid.  He… well… he’s coming back after lunch, he’s taking his girlfriend into town and he says we can tag along and he’ll drop us at the auto shop.  If you know what you need and…”
The perfect suction pauses at the noise and without sanction Dean’s hands leave go of the twisted bed clothes and come up automatically, fingers flexing into slightly damp, feather soft hair to stay the movement away. “Please,” it’s a pathetic whimper, with a hint of whining and the bastard chuckles at him around the head of his cock and Dean almost loses it again with the vibration plucking at his pleasure, like a thumb on a guitar string.
Any typos, errors or inconsistencies, please point them out.  I am never offended by any or all critiques.  It makes for a better experience all round.  Peace out bitches. x :-)
She made sure her cell was on silent and watched the two men returning to their sedan.  Their line of sight when they had entered the McDonalds had made it impossible to get back to her truck.  The only option had been to dart across the street to the next nearest building. As it happened it had also meant that she could not now break cover and get back to her vehicle without them seeing and she had no way of knowing if they knew what she looked like, or had her licence.
“I know you don’t like the feeling that I am paying for everything, but this place isn’t gonna cost me anything, Cas. My, er, friend is letting us have it in return for us doing it up. If we decide to stay, that is. We can fix it together, as equal partners. If we do, it’s ours for as long as we want. He says it’s weather-proof, but that’s about it. Basic utilities and a septic tank.”
It was good to be working with her again. Dean had missed Charlie when she had left the States to follow her girlfriend Dorothy to England. She had a habit of turning up in his life like a red-haired whirlwind, always filling him with her infectious happiness and joie de vivre. This secondment had been her find and he had to admit, it was just what he had needed. He watched her affectionately as her fingers danced over the keyboard and she became engrossed in what she was doing.
bruises?  If I had been in the mother of all fist fights like Scitz and Bass described, my face would look like Benny’s, and more importantly still.  To inflict that kind of damage to his face… My hands would be a mess.  Trust me.  I’ve been in enough fist fights to know.”  He held his hands up to Spengler, and the young lawyer gave him a smile of genuine triumph.
Once he kills the engine he can hear the subtle sound of her sniffing. “You sure you don’t want me to come in with you?” he says softly, he can’t blame her for hating him, not really, he would probably hate him too in her position. But he can’t help wishing things were different, that she would let him offer her some comfort or that he knew what to say to make her feel even the tiniest bit better. “I have a little time before I need to head back into town,” he adds helplessly. “I think I have a bag of those marshmallows you like so much amongst the groceries I ordered …”
“Partly?”  Steve arched an eyebrow and his mouth tweaked into a lopsided grin.  Dean smirked back, holding up his hands in mock defence.  He scooped the clothes up from the bed and strolled back into the bathroom.
“Shhh,” Dean murmured, petting his hair and holding him tight in the cradle of his legs. “Shhh, I’ve got you.”
Kali nodded.  “ Why were the murders of your parents not used for Dean's defence? Walker was never even charged with them. There's nothing in the evidence files even.”
“I need to read that file,” Michael said, a hint of desperation in his voice. “I need to know what it says.”
“I should have been there for him. I should have found a way. Listening to Sam… the things Dean did for him… Cas could never say any of his family were there for him that way.”
Oh fuck. He’s arranging a date and now Castiel is staring at him like a complete fool. He’s fortunate that Claire returns to save him. Pouncing on the hot chocolate like a vulture on a five-day-old carcass. Just as Dean grabs his own mug and gulps it down. Cas winces at the look of pained confusion that crosses Dean’s features, it must still be scalding hot. Moments later, he knows. In fact. It is. He knows this because he is wearing quite a lot of it.
“I don’t know,” Spengler said miserably. ”But I gave all the details I have to the team at the office. They were starting to look into the background stuff today.”
He jumped as she grabbed his chin and lifted his face, the bite of her fingers shocking, until she softened her grip and locked her eyes to his. “You listen to me Dean Winchester, number 1, there is nothing wrong with wanting a happy ending, and number 2, no I don’t think missing someone you hardly knew is stupid. Missing the idea of them maybe, but you and Castiel made a connection and what you did for him was a beautiful thing and number 3, don’t you dare diss little girls in pink tiaras in my hearing ever again.”
He was mumbling something and his hands were shaking as his fingers fumbled for the clasp and with a snake like slither and a dull splash the collar fell into the sea. Cas opened his eyes and saw them reflected in Dean’s pupils. His own irises shone gold around the dark, dark charcoal of his pupils, echoing the waves parting around them. Somewhere out to sea, he heard a low call, like the whispering hum of the wind through the dune grass and he turned his head towards it. He opened his mouth to speak as he turned back, but Dean stole his words. His arms looping around Cas pulling him in, one hand splayed across his lower back, the other winding into his hair with a barely there tug that sent sparks shattering through his nerve endings.
He missed him so much. He pulled back away from the glass watching his own reflection recede and disappear, replaced with the bright blue skies and bright lights of the Vegas skyline. The ghostly outline left by his face and hand prints on the glass.
He mumbles good night and opens the door to his room. He doesn’t bother with the lights, just throws himself across his bed and grabs his phone. Sure enough, he has a whole series of missed calls from Cas, starting just after 8 and then every fifteen to twenty minutes thereafter.
Dean dropped back against the wall between the beds and pulled Cas into him, cradling him, stroking his face and hair, as he sobbed, great racking sobs, soaking Dean’s neck and T-shirt as he let himself be turned and held tight. Gradually, slowly he calmed, coming back to himself from the horrors of the nightmare.  Dean felt the subtle change, as Cas regained control of himself, one moment he was clinging to Dean for all he was worth, the next he was pulling away, and Dean relinquished his hold and let his arms drop.
He recoiled in shock as the tape finally slipped free and she demanded angrily, “What the fuck are you doing here, moron?” Kicking him hard in the shin for good measure.
“I jumped, Cherub. You know damn well nobody drags me anywhere.” She sounded exhausted and he helped her onto the bed.
Cas flopped onto his bed.  His room had changed little since before he left for college.  Somehow he could never be bothered to put away his teenage belongings, and since the rest of the family continued to treat him like the baby of the family it had never seemed a problem.
“...’n’ she goes fanks, only her voice were really plummy, like that Joanna Lumley, real la-de-da sounding, it’s real heavy on my own, or summat like that.”
They both jumped slightly as the computer gave a little whooshing thump like an arrow hitting its target. Adler had mail. Michael’s brow furrowed as he read the body of the email and Kasia could not help but edge closer to read it over his shoulder. The sender’s name was not familiar, but confirmed receipt of payment for the dossier on Megan Masters, emailed a week previously.
The street was a darkened stretch ahead of him, the brightly lit plastic sign of the Magnolia Heights Motel, his own personal gleaming homing beacon in the distance.  The ground underfoot, gritty and sharp, scratched under the soles of his boots.
Slowly, Cas lifted his head. Hooded lids and lashes hiding his eyes as he continued to stare stubbornly at his hands.
Sam mumbled his thanks, and the screen lurched again as she disappeared. Oh, Dean sighed, coffee… "I'm sorry Dude, I didn't mean to interrupt..."
Professor MacArthur was a broken man.  His face, normally ruddy, was currently the colour of unset putty.  It wrinkled in places that indicated he smiled a lot, but no emotion showed now. His forehead relatively smoothed and the area around his eyes a web of laughter lines.  His blue-green eyes were rheumy, the whites threaded pink and red and currently unfocused.  He was sat on the ambulance trolley, clutching a white plastic cup as though it were the last lifebelt on the Titanic.  His soft tweed tailoring plastered in blood.
Dean gave her a shove. "Sorry, Cas, you have to forgive Jo, we grew up together and she's the one-word answer to the question 'why do I usually come here alone?'. Castiel is mute, Jo, not deaf. He rescued me at the beach today, and I'm buying him dinner as a thank you."
The line was dead before Balthazar could utter another word.  He stared pensively at the wall, tapping his phone against his lip, feeling truly uneasy.  He shrugged, there was nothing to be done now, but tomorrow…  Shrugging his worries aside he wandered back into the bar.
Another rare exception normally stands just inside the entrance waiting for him. None of the doors in the compound have locks, not even the latrines or the bathrooms. Modesty is not needed by those who are pure of heart, or so the teachings say. Jack has no need to, but when he arrives first, which he generally does, he always lets Castiel lead him into the rooms. Today there is no sign of him. Castiel pushes aside the jangling sense of discord, like an offkey string, or the squeak of wet chalk on the blackboard that has had him on edge for days.
Adler picked at a piece of dander on his suit leg. “Your brother hospitalised some local thug.  Beat him about the head with a pool cue.”
The subway was busy at this time of day, not as crowded as the morning and evening rush hour, but never really quiet.  She glanced at her watch,  she had twenty minutes to reach the coffee shop, instinctively she picked up her pace a little, and pressed through the dispersed crowds.
Even conservative estimates suggested that there was one CCTV camera for every 32 people in the UK, and unless you stayed in all day and didn’t venture outside your front door, it was pretty much impossible to go more than 100 yards in London without getting filmed by at least two or three of them. The only problem was the sheer damned volume of the footage.
The last few days have been an unanticipated boon for Cas. He was expecting to spend these next few weeks as he has spent the last few months, negotiating sensitivities as carefully as a parent walking barefoot over lego bricks - in the dark. Instead, the last few days been fun, real fun. Claire is still not easy with him and he’s aware that their relationship is a precious fragile seedling, as likely to founder from over nurturing as it is from neglect or carelessness, but Dean is allowing them to spend time together without being alone together. A surge of gratitude overwhelms Castiel. He is so lucky to have this man’s friendship.
“Cassie,” Bal said softly taking a gentle grip of his elbow. “Shower! I’ll work quicker without you hovering over my shoulder.”
