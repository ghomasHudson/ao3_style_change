be, that’s simply not an option. He needs to resurface right now - wake up. Because for once this is no joke, no nightmare; there’s no hidden twist waiting to jump out at the end, no backup plan, no hero coming to save the day. This is
Without thinking he reaches forward and lets his hand stray across to John’s side of the car, hesitating just inches away from the other man’s knee.
two weeks of dashing about and night's that involved very little sleep. It was a serial killer this time, Sherlock's favourite, but even this case had pushed his limits, and it was a relief to know that things were finally going to return to some kind of normality, well, at least for the afternoon.
"Oh!” Mrs Hudson gasped again as she stepped back. "Is John in there?" She mouthed dramatically, her attempt at whispering really quite appalling.
I hope you liked it! know I said in the last chapter notes that this was going to be happy oops! Sorry! I'll try and make the next one fluffy smut ;) If you have any requests please pop them below. Don't hesitate to tell me what you thought!
Sherlock’s glistening eyes flickered up to his and the pupils seemed to twinkle deviously, and that's when John realised Sherlock had been teasing him deliberately, waiting for him to beg.
He gets up and promptly disappears from the room. John follows so it won’t be painfully obvious they’ve emerged from the same bedroom by the time Mycroft gets up the stairs. And, as predicted, he has just enough time to drop down in his chair and pretend to be on his phone by the time Mycroft and Sherlock renter the living room.
The motorbike comes to a smoking halt at the other side of the road, its wheels still spinning uncontrollably, the engine whirring. All the traffic stops.
“In order to keep the hospital happy, and for my brother’s own good, I have agreed to two home visits a day from a doctor who specialises in treatment for addiction. I know you are a perfectly qualified GP John so please do not take this as an insult to your skills but I thought this might be simpler. That way you can sleep, go home and do not bear the responsibility of any complications. Of course, I do not doubt that every second you are here you will be doing your best to look after him, and for that I am very grateful.”
The first person to throw his world upside down; to save him from God knows what after the army. A man he's laughed with, killed for, mourned over. A person with the most incredible stories -
There’s no denying they clicked. One afternoon of being stuck in a room together, having to study together, and that was it. Instant friends, they’ve started solving campus crimes for the university newspaper. They walk around Oxford, visit the museums; stop to have lunch in a cafe - Sherlock normally impressing John with his endless deductions. Classmates have commented on what a pair they are, Sherlock’s own mother has made a comment about meeting Sherlock’s new ‘special friend’ when he next goes home for reading week.
I'm so so sorry it's taken me forever again to update this. All I can say is I really hope you enjoy it. I worked really hard on it. If you are an old time reader thank you so much for sticking with me and this story, you have an amazing amount of patience and dedication to Johnlock. I salute you.
But the noise is varying in pitch. Dipping and differing as it floats down from somewhere above and echoes inside his eardrums. It appears there’s a second voice, one that’s lower than John’s, more sombre.
He pulled up a chair and sat down, reaching out to drag one across for Sherlock too. Each table had a small orange desk light, presumably for taking notes during videos and John flicked it on, causing a small haze of warm orange light to flood their small corner of the room. Sherlock moved the folder into the light before plonking himself down and hunching over it once more, running his fingers quickly through the pages.
“No please sir, I’m serious. Tell us.” The same student persisted with his taunts. John grinded his teeth in his mouth and decided that boy was definitely on the bottom of the favourite list.
Hopefully my writing has improved over time so if you want better, longer pieces of work skip these first few chapters as I wrote them a while ago now.
She sighs and closes her eyes. There’s not really much point in trying to sleep, but after getting in and putting Rosie to bed, she didn’t know what else to do. It’s nearly 9 am now, and normally she’d be in the kitchen making John his breakfast. She’d be giving him that extra bit of honey on his toast, asking him what time his shift ends, kissing him goodbye at the door.
John tightens his grip on Sherlock’s shoulder. The stair creaks quietly below them. A moment passes.
. He crinkles his nose in disgust and starts to tug at the drip pressed into his hand, an instrument feeding even more drugs into his body.
The nurse steps slowly into his vision and folds her lips into a straight line. Her gaze grows softer. “You know I can’t do that.”
It’s like someone is clearing the fog in Mycroft’s brain. Warm sunlight streams in through the blinds at the window.
After a moment, a door opens and a doctor arrives. He’s pleased to see that it's Claire, a tall woman with blonde hair and sympathetic smile. They've discussed Sherlock’s case many times before.
“Don’t.” John turns on him instantly, thrusting a threatening hand in the detective’s direction. “Just...” His words come out as a low warning, a guttural growl. “…don’t.”
They remain in silence for a long while, before Mary runs her hands down John's shoulders a final time and pulls back, looking towards the door. “Well…" She sighs softly. "I guess I should go.”
“Just as well we’re staying then, isn’t it?” John smirks sarcastically. “In fact, this is so much fun, I wonder if we’ll ever want to leave your side again.”
proud to be slipping his hand into the world’s only consulting detective’s palm. Because no matter what happens now, he’ll always have this; these past few years, and specifically this evening, to cherish and in his memory forever.
Sherlock and John sit together on the bed for a while, enjoying the silence, the calm. Outside, trains rattle through the station and the afternoon traffic hums. The rain patters. Birds tweet outside the window. Eventually, John rests his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.
She’s a little concerned about John’s lack of replies, because it's usual but...there's probably a reasonable explanation. She just hasn't figured out what it is yet.
They manage to make it all the way to the top, up to the landing, before the noise seems to wake Mrs Hudson. She bursts out of her door and rushes up the stairs towards them, dressed in only her nightie, all smiles and dainty steps until-
He dropped himself down into the chair next to Sherlock. Towering over him had felt too threatening, and that was something he didn't want to be.
The lad smirked at John, looking him right in the eye and not showing the slightest display of discomfort or hesitation, considering the words he’d just said. As predicted the boys around him erupted with laughter, punching one another on the shoulders, the heroisms spinning from their lips.
A long moment passes, and in that time a newfound calm seems to fall over them; a pause, but not one filled with grief and anger like before. Slowly, they start to come to terms with the situation around them. It’s a quiet acceptance. A steady retreat. Relief. At last.
"Umm..." John squinted, shading his eyes from the sun with his palm. "No. Looks good, but Mike told me the food isn't. Let's keep going, apparently, there are some nice ones around this street corner here."
“Yes,” John grasps Sherlock’s hand and squeezes it gently. “Yes it’s me. I’m here - I’m with you. It’s going to be okay...he’s not
But at that very moment the lights unexpectedly dim around them, and the orchestra goes quiet; soft as they start up with a new song. A classic song. One that Sherlock recognises instantly.
John watched, propped up on his elbows, his eyelids heavy and his breath yielding to the intense effect of Sherlock’s actions.
John raised his eyebrows, effectively cutting Sherlock off. It fell silent for a small moment, and reluctantly he let the relief wash the anger from his body.
The rest of the session went quickly. John dared a few glances at Sherlock, who each time, looked away. He finished his final words and shut the PowerPoint off, smiling politely as he set everyone on their way. The general cluttered noise of people gathering their things and scraping their chairs briefly filling the room.
Sherlock scowled and rolled his eyes. "Really John? Small talk? We travel all the way to a different country and you want to make pointless comments." He scanned the hustle of people rushing past, his eyes flickering over hundreds and hundreds of small details. Trimmed nails, worn-out handbags, shiny new shoes. "Why don't we play deductions instead?"
Sherlock exhales loudly and flops back down into his chair. He's shaking. He closes his eyes. “I am very good at concealing what I don't want to be seen.”
John’s body starts moving on its own accord. He grabs the rounds of Sherlock’s shoulders and pushes him back against the headboard. Advances on top. They kiss again. Sherlock moans. John shifts his thighs and straddles him. He is certain now that the detective must be able to feel his erection through his trousers, bone hard and pushing up against his thigh. He doesn't try and hide it.
Something only a complete fool would say. The words fail to scratch even the surface of his feelings. They lack the gravity he needs to explain everything - the details he wants to share.
“Quite so,” the detective says hurriedly, crossing the room and sitting himself down in his chair. “In fact, I feel a lot better now so you can go and get some sleep, brother mine. John is here to look after me.”
"I know." Sherlock whispered, failing to contain the warm grin that was overtaking his face. He took hold of one of her hands affectionately.
Sherlock looked momentarily startled. "I've only solved it in my head, John, I want to make sure I'm right before I present the facts. And besides, this is no fun if you're just going to ignore me."
“No, um, I guess it is a bit soon anyway, to meet everyone, you know, we’ve only just got to know each other.”
John struggles with the door for a moment before realising it is useless. He lets go in such a way that it slowly swings open...and a slightly nervous, doe-eyed Sherlock is revealed. White shirt, long black coat and trousers, holding some flowers.
“What about Paris?” Sherlock’s expression was one of genuine confusion. He leaned forward a little on the table. "I knew Mycroft sounded smug on the phone,"
His plea echoes inside John’s head once more. The sound of Sherlock’s breathing resonates loudly in his ears, and the smell of damp concrete and blood merge together in his nose, flooding his senses. Everything feels off balance, slanted.
He waits for his vision to black out completely; for the vomit to come. It’s as if someone is grinding and kneading his heart with their fists. How can he ever - there’s nothing left for him now. He’s...failed. What will he tell their parents? How can he face them?
"Ok." Sherlock smiled, turning back and starting to walk, his usual restlessness all but settled by the reassurance that hung in John's smile. "I don't mind."
the one that calms all the government fuck ups - orders them out. Finds each one and untangles it neatly before hiding it far from away the public’s view. It’s work that never stops. Dots that don’t stay connected. A task that always needs to be re-assembled.
“God...” He waits a second before rolling off, flopping down into the mattress. They lie beside each other wordlessly, chests heaving, catching their breath.
Mycroft’s words drag him back to reality in an instant, like a cold slap in the face. A million insecurities flood back to the hollow pit in his stomach. His chest contracts with nerves. He sits up wearily.
Sherlock’s whole body starts to shake as he comes alive with a sudden blur of motion and sensation. His skin burns hot not cold. He suddenly becomes aware of the sweat pouring past his temples.
John opened his eyes and pretended to take interest in a nearby Pidgeon. Even they were prettier here, they were-
John moves away from his ear and pulls back, cupping Sherlock’s cheek before gazing into his nervous dark eyes.
There are no more photographs. No more pictures of anyone. Rosie feels a panic rising in her chest and flicks to the end of the album to make sure. She places it down on her lap.
“What?” Sherlock feels dizzy. He eyes the bucket beside him on the floor. He’s probably going to be sick again soon.
It’s mortifying. Horrifying - simply too humiliating for words. Sherlock wants it all to stop. So why on earth John thought he’d be up for meeting his entire family and friends at a birthday dinner is a mystery to him. Sherlock is quickly learning that sometimes John isn’t very logical. It’s getting quite irritating, to be honest.
John props himself up on his elbows and leans down to start devouring Sherlock’s neck; feeling oddly pleased with himself when the detective starts to whimper and shake beneath him.
And there it is. All John's ever wanted to know. He dips down suddenly and closes the gap between them, pressing his soft rosy lips gently against Sherlock's own, giving himself no time to hesitate.
He exhales sharply and shakes his head. Trying to snap himself out of it and rid his brain of the memories; stop the sound of his own screams from ringing in his ears.
The boy wasn’t making it easy though, as although his body was facing John he still had his cheek turned to the side, hiding behind his hair and avoiding John's eyes. John frowned, noting that Sherlock looked disconcerted and ever so slightly flustered. He closed his eyes briefly as another wave of remorse crushed over him. He should've intervened sooner.
Realisation floods her veins, quick and sharp, like a drug entering her system. The cabs go to pull over, they recognise her, and then they drive off.
"Sherlock!" John called as he spotted the trails of a very familiar long black coat go sweeping around the corner of the shop aisle and promptly out of view. "Sherlock, wait!"
“This bit, here” John pointed to a diagram and a page describing the correct procedure on treating open wounds at a crime scene, “Is brilliant, absolutely incredible. It just makes so much sense.” John shook his head lightly in disbelief, before looking up at Sherlock and staring fondly into his eyes.
"Um, er." John stuttered slightly, his brain whirling as he struggled to even remember what Sherlock had asked. "Sorry,” He said at last. “That's not really my area I'm afraid.”
John struggles to keep his hand still for long enough. His best friend is squirming and jolting beneath him, like a mouse trying to escape from a trap.
Sherlock gave a shy smile, and it was as if just for a second all the paraphernalia that usually surrounded him was gone, the magnificent smoke of 'being Sherlock Holmes’ was blown back from him briefly. In that moment John could see Sherlock for all he truly was; just another small human being who’d given his heart to someone else and was praying they didn’t break it. The truth was, Sherlock was vulnerable, and entirely in John’s hands.
The words break off as he drops down and sinks his lips onto Sherlock’s own, capturing their mouths in a thoroughly devastating kiss. Rosy red meeting pale blue. He applies such a tender amount of pressure, lets the moment linger. Nothing has ever come so directly from deep inside his heart. His warm breath travels into Sherlock’s mouth.
A minute passes. Another taxi emerges in the queue of cars, it’s orange light gleaming, merging with the apricot sky. It starts to slow and indicate towards the pavement.
“The list.” Mycroft repeats, his hands still scurrying all over the ground near Sherlock, searching blindly in the darkness. “We have an agreement you see, that every time he overdosed he would write a list. A list of everything he’s taken. It makes things easier when - WHY CAN’T I FIND IT?!”
“No!” Sherlock’s gasps, his body jolting as his knees contract towards his chest. “Not you.” Tears begin to squeeze from the corners of his eyes.
“Until what?” Mary is now perched on the edge of the seat. Her fingers curl into fists at her sides. She
“Ok, you may be sick several times in the next few hours.” Mark leans down to his suitcase and gets out the instrument used to measure blood pressure. Sherlock rolls up his sleeve. “The methadone will help subside these symptoms a little but it’s still going to be difficult. The cravings are strongest in the first 24 to 48 hours, and this is when relapse is most likely. I take it you’re not going to be alone?”
They’re not particularly well framed, but there is a sort of style to them. They’re so generic that they could belong to anyone, but Rosie knows that it was John who took them. John’s hands on the camera, his fingers curling around the edges. Perhaps they were taken when he first came to live in London, or maybe snapped between cases; travelling on the bus or strolling through a park. She flicks to the next one.
John pulls the phone from his pocket. “No, it’s...,” his voice trails as he reads the name. “Molly?”
He hesitates momentarily before folding the note up carefully and slipping it into his blazer pocket. It’s not perfect. But then, nothing he’s done ever has been.
“No,” Mary wipes the drizzle from her helmet, smearing her vision briefly. “I’ll take Barts. You go south.”
Neither Greg, Molly, Mary or anyone else has made an appearance in the nearly 10 hours they've been here, likely because Mycroft has refused to reveal where they are. He has decided, after some careful consideration, that concealing the details of their situation is best for the time being... considering. He can’t control it forever of course - certainly, Mary will be the first to trace them. But for now, it's best to hold them off. As it stands, a domestic drama in the middle of a public hospital is the last thing anyone needs.
, right now. His dark curls bouncing lightly off his forehead, the shadows cast across the room making his eyes dark, the pale light reflecting in his pupils right in the center. The way his chest was fluttering lightly in time with his breathing. It was all undeniably enticing.
It’s only now that she has an idea of why. He wasn’t happy. He was thinking, missing someone. Again, she wonders how she was so blind.
"Seriously? John squints in disbelief. His expression is dangerously sour. He almost laughs. “This is ridiculous.”
The elder Holmes drops his head into his hands and begins to rock slowly; forwards and backwards. His whole body tingles and tenses, prickling with a storm of fiery emotions.
They were strolling through the west side of London, just past Wembley. Walking in step. Basking in the spring sunshine while still cherishing the cool breeze that hit their cheeks. London looked pretty on days like this. The tall grey buildings capturing the gentle wash of golden sunshine instead of dulling it. Daffodils peek out from under the soil in hanging baskets. Despite the traffic, for once everything seemed so peaceful. Like there was nothing wrong with the world at all.
For a moment Sherlock paused, leaving his warm breath to surround John, and the heat was so unbearably irresistible that John couldn’t bear it any longer.
“Well,” He says after a moment, crossing the room and making some space for himself on his old chair, sweeping a few yellowing newspapers onto the floor. He clicks his phone. “She still hasn’t replied."
That must have been when it happened, shortly after these photographs were taken. She shudders. That's why the rest of the album is once again empty, like before in 2012, John must have stopped because it was at this moment his world came crashing down around him. 2017 is the year his wife, and her mother, died.
All of this is making Mycroft’s head spin - something he hasn’t experienced for many years. The feeling of panic is almost unrecognisable - dangerous. The world sways in front of him. He feels dizzy and lightheaded. Like he might faint or throw up at any moment, actually drowning in a swamp of his own despair.
me, Sherlock, it's fine." John continued, stepping back ever so slightly to give the other man some space.
He reached where Sherlock was sat and stood awkwardly. It felt weird standing when Sherlock was sitting, but he decided that taking a chair next to him could come across as creepy. Especially in a darkened classroom, that could be viewed as slightly inappropriate.
John’s whole body flooded with relief, he gave a massive sigh and with Sherlock’s help, wriggled down in the hope of being more comfortable, until he ended up straddling Sherlock’s lap in a way that was surprisingly snug on the small chair.
“Please Sherlock,” John sobs, tears dribbling onto the other man’s cheeks. “Wake up. This can’t be it. I love you.”
He’s added her to a list, although she was probably already on one, which renders her dangerous. A ‘High-risk suspect', as it used to be known as in the field. Not quite a fugitive but more or less one. She’s seen these things before, and wonders now why she was foolish enough not to expect it. There's probably been alerts sent out all across London. People watching her every move. It’s now impossible for her to travel.
"Good, well I’ll see you next week.” He finished, turning away to begin collecting his things. He wasn't expecting Sherlock to say thank you, he never did. Instead he was just glad that the awkward encounter was over and he could finally go home.
Sherlock sags forward and takes small shallow breaths. Gasps desperately for air. He tries to utter the few Russian words he knows how to pronounce.
he’s gurgling rubbish, groaning loudly about the one person he really shouldn’t. But it doesn’t matter, this place is empty anyway.
John takes several deep breaths. After a moment he finally gives in and drops down beside Sherlock on the bed, defeated.
He squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his ears, blocking out the sound of Sherlock's moans that are finding their way into the hallway. He needs to go back in there. Needs to contact the ambulance and let them know exactly where they are. This may be destroying him, turning his brain to ash and burning his heart into a million pieces. But he can’t let it win, not yet. He’s got to try his best to fix this, he owes Sherlock that at least.
John feels himself being tilted backwards. Sherlock’s strong arms supporting him and lowering him towards the ground. It’s all happening so fast, so quickly, that it takes him a moment to realise he’s actually about to be dip kissed.
“Yeah,” Mary has the hold the phone in place with her shoulder as she uses two hands to steer through another set of traffic, cutting along Whitehall. “Look for a black coat and a blue scarf, that’ll be the giveaway.”
John pondered on these thoughts as made his way across the university campus to the class. Surprisingly, so far he’d managed to tame the butterflies in his stomach, although there was no denying he could still feel the nervous tingle of anticipation sparking through him with every step as he walked closer to the building. To be honest he had no idea what to expect, he hadn't spoken to Sherlock, he had no way of contacting him and besides, what on an earth would he say?
Something inside Sherlock collapses. The final foundation. He forgot. In all the exhaustion and the arguments, he forgot about the scars on his fucking back - and more importantly that John was still yet to see them. It's a secret he’s managed to hide for nearly two years, and it has come to light now. In this moment. Brilliant.
“Sorry,” John stutters in between pants, “I'm not really sure what I'm doing but-” he moans as Sherlock leans up and kisses him again. “You will say if it's too much?”
The sound of blood throbs thickly in his ears. Everything feels very slow, very surreal. In the haze he notices that Sherlock’s mouth has stopped bubbling.
“I hate this,” he slurs to the room, which still contains a tired John Watson and a bored Mycroft Holmes. “I’m so uncomfortable.”
But Mary isn’t listening. She glances past him at Sherlock, who still hasn’t moved from his chair. “I…” She looks the detective up and down quickly, studying him, deducing anything she can. Dangerously pale cheeks. Dark bags under his eyes. Sweat layering forehead. Ill? Injured?
Mary moves as if to follow but then decides against it. She watches as her husband places his hands on the kitchen counter and closes his eyes, his chest rising and falling vigorously. She can’t tell if he’s about to cry or commit murder.
She rubs her eyes once more and tries to focus on the task in hand: clearing out the attic and searching through their old belongings; deciding what will be kept, and what will be thrown away.
The consulting detective suddenly goes completely still, like ice. His fingers stop trembling, his lips stop quivering, eyelids stop fluttering. He stops. Entirely. Shuts down from the outside. It’s like watching ripples on water run out of momentum.
Sherlock can’t see but he guarantees his brother is rolling his eyes. “I need some more.” he moans dramatically.
“John,” Sherlock gasps between kisses. “I’m not sure I can - oh god - I don't want to go too soon, or-” he grasps for John’s trousers, and the army doctor moves so he can get to them. Sherlock undoes the button and starts frantically pushing the fabric down around his thighs.
John watches silently as Sherlock folds his hands back in his lap. He nods. “That's okay. I…liked it.”
“But she’s not you,” John continues after a moment. “That’s the problem, alright? There I finally said it. A large part of me
“The Rivoli Ballroom, please. It’s in the south-east.” Sherlock leans forwards and talks to the driver, agreeing the fare and suggesting directions. John sits back into his seat and tries very hard not to stare unabashedly at his flatmate’s arse. His tongue slips over his lower lip at the sight of those slim thighs and toned back muscles Sherlock's exquisite black suit deliberately fails to hide.
“Uh, Uh.” John tuts. “I’m not stopping him. You know how I feel about biology experiments in the kitchen. I might even go and…” he pauses for comic effect. “
. So fast the driver must have floored the accelerator. It all happens so quick that she doesn’t even get the chance to see his face.
Sherlock curls his hand around John’s fingers to stop them twitching. “Ok, thank you. That will be all.”
Written as a 'crappy fanfiction post' on Instagram for the prompt 'Sherlock getting nervous about holding John's hand.'
“Yes,” Sherlock's eyes roll back as John starts to stroke them both now, cocks rubbing against each other. It’s almost too much. “Oh god yes.”
“No!” Dread instantly fills every single pore of Sherlock’s body once again, rises through him like a flood. “Don’t go out there. Don’t tell them I’m awake. Just say I’m dead, or in a coma or something. Just get them to leave. Anything.”
“So, what was it you wanted to ask me?” John asks, as they shrug on their coats outside the cloakroom. He smiles as yet another person passes and gives him a hearty pat on the back. For the rest of the evening, they have not had a chance to speak for people have been so busy coming over and singing their praises.
Mycroft presses his hands down flat on the counter, scanning the shelves of medicines and tablets as he waits.
, he thinks. Probably slumped in bed or passed out on the sofa after spending hours composing on the violin. Or perhaps he’s out on a case, tracking down a criminal with Lestrade.
“Yes. But he’s…” The nurse trails off and her eyes suddenly fixate on the floor. “Well, um, maybe it would be best if you went in one at a time.”
"So what, you know the entire bloody French language now do you?" John failed entirely to hide the amazement in his voice.
Mycroft shifts beside him. Hesitantly, he reaches out and places an unsteady palm across Sherlock’s forehead before closing his eyes. John knows he’s not going to ask again. He doesn't need to.
Tears start to slide from the corner of his eyes too. He blinks. His breath rapidly becoming hard to steady. The bleep of the machine sounds his heart rate getting faster.
John just nods his head slowly, seeming to understand Sherlock’s unspoken assurance. He removes his hand and digs it into his pocket to pull out his phone, the light from the screen illuminating his face as he unlocks it. He types a message quickly and shows Sherlock the screen.
: begged, stolen, murdered, tortured. Anything to stop the pain. He couldn’t focus. Couldn’t connect the dots and solve the problem. He had to walk away, so thank god John was there to bring him to his senses.
Mary takes several deep, stunted, breaths. Her lower lip starts to tremble against her will. Her eyebrows narrow slightly. She doesn’t bother concealing the array of emotions sweeping across her face. She almost chokes on her own breath. “So...you- you two...?"
"However..." Sherlock turned back and took John's palm softly in his own, leading him into the centre of the room.
John’s heart flooded with warmth and the corners of his lips rose up on their own accord, the warmth seeming to escape from his heart as he beamed at Sherlock.
John bit down on his lip nervously. One week had passed and now he found himself 15 minutes into his 11b class - the one with Sherlock. He would like to say he was completely uneffected by last week's encounter, but of course that was not the case.
John smiled, rising onto his tiptoes so that he could reward Sherlock with a small kiss on his lips.
The cab pulls up alongside a smart grey building with tall arched windows. The doors at the front are already open, and men in tight white shirts linger casually outside, talking and laughing, clouds of cigarette smoke shrouding their faces. Groups of women in heels and fluffy beige coats head through the door.
“Hmpth,” Sherlock slurs, shirt partly undone, one arm behind his head, still completely out of it. “They could be quite important.”
feel for her, once, but nothing comes. His vision starts to blur before him. It feels like everything is collapsing on the inside.
Sherlock takes a breath. “Look, sorry I couldn’t make it. I - err” he clears his throat, “I sometimes get nervous about speaking to people, you know, at social events and err, well, I didn’t handle it very well and I guess-”
Hello again. I know it's only been a few days since I last updated but I really am rushing to get this done before TFP airs. And typically, my computer decided to crash and I lost everything. So I had to rewrite this chapter. I'm so anxious that my writing standard has slipped and it's not going to be good enough anymore, but hopefully that's not the case. Anyway, enjoy!
He’s never seen Sherlock - or anyone for that matter - appear to be in so much pain. His little brother is tossing and turning on his back, shaking violently, a thin layer of sweat covering his skin. The sound of his cries fills the room and his delirious rambles bounce off the walls. It looks like he’s finally lost it.
I do not own the copyright to any of the photos used in the piece above, EXCEPT the first five of London, which were taken by my parents when I was a child. All credit must go to the respective artists and editors of these photos, and I have not knowingly removed any watermarks.
As he ordered his papers he risked one final glance at Sherlock, who was picking up his bag and making his way towards the door. John smiled briefly and looked away again, bending down to pick up his coat.
Small droplets of light start to appear in the murkiness. Pulses of electricity spark from somewhere deep in the corner of his mind. Surely this is an illusion. That’s not
He stands by the desk for a long time and looks at what he’s written - the stark light from the window cutting across his still features. He’s still not sure if he likes it. It all sort of poured out at once. Besides, nothing can ever really convey
John bit down on his lip. Now finding it impossibly difficult not to call out, for the feeling was so intense, and Sherlock was so good, so keen to make this utterly resplendent for John that his eagerness only made the act ten times more arousing.
Sherlock dropped Mrs Hudson's hand quickly and they both simultaneously turned, guilty looks covering their faces.
John hastily decided he wasn’t a fan of that. He stood up quickly, shaking slightly. He couldn’t deny that Sherlock looked...
With great effort John pushes up from the chair and stands, ignoring the fact that his arms and legs strain underneath him. He pauses awkwardly and runs his fingers through his hair, catching Sherlock’s eye. “Do you err...need me to…?” He offers his hands into the empty space between them.
The second she leaves a cold silence blankets them, so tense it's like there's an invisible force pressing inwards. Every minute seems to drag past painfully. It's like John can hear a clock ticking in his mind. A timer counting down to an explosion, but no one has the power to stop it.
She stares numbly at the ceiling. If she tried hard enough, she could probably convince herself that John was simply in the bathroom right now, just brushing his teeth before bed.
The pale yellow bricks seem to tower oddly in front of her. A train rattles faintly through the station a few streets away. The road is quiet - silent even - but not peaceful. Instead it feels eerie. Rigged. As if someone’s watching her. She glances cautiously over her shoulder.
“But it didn’t...work. He was there anyway and...I actually…” He gulps. The look of disappointment on John’s face is worse than being repeatedly kicked in the chest. “I nearly didn’t make it. Everything seemed to deteriorate, very quickly and...I almost…” He chokes on his words, forcing them from his throat. “…gave up. Until...”
Because although he is by no means good with people - Sherlock will admit that at least - he would like to think he is good at predicting people. And he did
Sherlock lets out another agonising yell. His whole body tensing as his muscles contract inwards. Dark blue veins start to line his pale arms. More blood dribbles from his mouth and stains the fabric of his shirt. It’s actually horrific, impossible to witness. Mycroft feels sure he is about to be sick. He can’t even look at him, his own brother, he-
Seconds pass. Minutes. John still doesn’t move, clutching at the door handle for support. He doesn’t go to sit down.
John’s hands find their way underneath Sherlock’s body, against his face and through his hair. He drops his forehead against Sherlock’s. Their noses slide past each other.
The man starts pushing the knife further, shouting, his horrible hot breath steaming over Sherlock’s face, demanding that he speaks.
Sherlock braces for impact as the man pulls back and strikes his fist across his face, the knife catching his cheek as he goes. Blood splatters on the floor.
The door to the room suddenly creakes open, and an exhausted but slightly more relaxed Mycroft appears. John notices his top button is done back up, and he’s holding his head a little higher.
“No Sherlock,” John stutters, backtracking, his mouth falling open slightly. “It doesn’t matter what I want? That’s not what I-”
John shuts his eyes and shoves his head into his hands, sagging back towards the wall; collapsing against it for support. Already he seems so defeated, so helpless.
Someone yanks the helmet from her head. Mary squints and puts a hand to her face slowly. Blood wets her fingers.
“Oh.” Sherlock feels a small flutter of warmth inside his chest. “I’ve missed you too, John.” He sighs softly. “I’ve missed you too.”
A blanket of silence fell over them as the last student left the room and they were finally alone together once again.
He tries to sit up but pain shoots through his left shoulder, his chest, and insufferable sting. He cries out. His helmet is choking him.
They walk forwards, down the long corridor and towards a high marble archway. John can already hear the soft melody of the music creeping around the corners, the clatter of glasses, people talking and laughing. As they get closer Sherlock starts to pull ahead but John holds back, admiring every single detail. It feels a bit like he's in a dream. Is Sherlock really holding his hand right now? Has he ever been somewhere this posh? This extravagant? How much is this all going to cost-
As he starts to drift off guilt gnaws away at his insides and snakes around his stomach like a deadly disease. What will happen to John if he doesn’t make it? To Mycroft? Will they blame him?
“Oh fuck, Sherlock.” John gasps as he starts to tease the build-up, his mind awash with dizziness. His hand speeds up on its own accord. “Come now, I’m gonna-”
Mycroft opens his mouth and then closes it again, like a goldfish. His vision clouds against his will. His eyes brim with tears.
John tries to speak but then drops his head and turns away, taking a few shaky steps towards the kitchen. His eyes are already brimming with tears. His chest feels as if it might burst. He can’t
“Right…” John takes in the rest of the flat sadly, the memories of how it used to be appearing one by one in front of him. The image of the past falling before his eyes like a transparent stage curtain. He blinks it away quickly.
A frail woman with baggy eyes and greying hair looks up from across the room. She’s wearing a faded blue dress that’s one size too big for her, and looks... fragile. Distressed. She’s leant over the hospital bed in the center of the room, holding the hand on someone much smaller, younger. Someone in a patterned blue hospital gown.
“Nothing. I just,” John tries to compose himself and blinks. He needs to get a grip. “I’ve just never seen you topless like that before, that’s all.”
“No John, he needs to hear it.” She gulps. “I’m sorry you’ve been unhappy and I’m sorry that it sucks. But there are better ways of dealing with it than this. This isn’t fair on anyone else. You’ve got to stop now okay. You’ve just got to stop.”
Thankfully, on que Sherlock jumped up, grabbing his satchel in the process. "Of course. I'll go" He said broadly, offering John a pleasant smile as he tucked in his chair.
listening to it. The only other alternative is talking to Mycroft - someone he has absolutely no idea how to start a conversation with.
But as ever, John is struggling to understand this simple affair and is upset all the same. The experience is actually incredibly new to Sherlock, in fact, this is the first time he’s ever had to deal with it. They’ve only been friends, close friends, or whatever they are - Sherlock isn’t really sure - for a month or so. It’s Sherlock’s first year at Oxford University. They met by chance in a class on forensic science and have spent every waking second together since.
The phone sounds as the message sends and he drops it into his lap. The world is quiet around them. It seems after everything, after so much talking and arguing and crying, so many intense emotions, neither of them really know what to say. John feels drained beyond belief.
The clock clicks steadily above them. John stares up at the plain white ceiling. Exhaustion really isn’t the right word. His head throbs and his muscles ache. His eyes are already shutting on him, his body falling limp as it’s finally allowed sleep. It's still hard to believe this is actually over, that they've made it this far.
But he's never been able to express himself. The words lodge in his throat like glass. It's like the ground is sloping inwards. It feels like his chest is about to burst with the pressure of it all.
There was the tearing of paper, laughter and a mutter of the word “freak” broke loose in the midst of the noise. John felt himself draw in a sharp intake of breath as thunderous anger finally set in like an electric shock, breaking him from his ludicrous trance. His fist clenched by his side and the other tightened around the door handle so hard that his knuckles were starting to turn white.
Hello! So this has taken me ages, I'm so sorry. I've been busy and I'm also really worried that this chapter is rubbish and pointless. But anyway, I'll let you be the judge of that.
“So those are…” Sherlock looks baffled, his eyebrows narrowed, pupils darting, curls flopping in his eyes. “Happy tears now?”
“I’m going to inject your first dose of 30mg now, and then I’ll top you up with another 10mg in four hours. Then we’ll need to give you 20mg twice a day for the next couple of days.”
Sherlock has stopped murmuring, stopped shaking. His whole body now still expect for the moisture that fills the oxygen mask and the bleep the machine makes as it picks up his pulse. The blue-eyed paramedic stands in the other corner trying not to look at them. But when he does, his eyes are filled with something that makes John's stomach curl. Genuine sorrow. Pity.
The voice echoes in his ears several times. Everything shakes. Trembles. He tries to open his eyes but when he does the world is sideways, an endless stretch of orange sand. There’s figures running in the distance. Blurred, wavering. Dressed in light camouflage gear. Sounds come rushing back to him quickly, much faster than his vision. Gunshots.
for the cases, for the adrenaline that used to pump through his veins - the midnight pursuits. He wants more than anything to be back with the man with a nightmare personality and charming smile…
normal. She’s a retired assassin. Smart, intuitive. Far more than she lets on, even now her secret is out. Mycroft has
Mycroft sits at his desk and scrolls endlessly on his phone. Emails, emails. All the same just packaged differently. Familiar names and places - occasionally new ones - swapped around endlessly like players on a monopoly board. Each message is a different disaster to deal with, a new crisis to sooth and unravel.
Sherlock’s feels the heat growing between them. It’s never radiated quite like this. The air has never been so thick with anticipation. His groans get louder. He breaks the kiss and gasps for air. Grinning, momentarily, before pushing John backwards so that he falls against the sheets. Sherlock falls with him, pressing down on to him. Smug that he’s managed to get on top.
Sherlock bent back down, he was concentrating before but now he blocked out everything else entirely, he wanted this to be one of the best he'd given John yet.
A switch flicks in her brain. Lights blink and flutter, and suddenly it's like the mist in her mind is starting to clear, the panic receding the same way fog shrinks across fields. A plan forms in its place. Clear and concise.
He hopes the army doctor is ok, that somehow last night they worked something out. It’s not fair for him to bear so much pain and heartbreak for his little brother, he never did anything to deserve it.
Sherlock said nothing so without thinking John reached over and placed his palm over Sherlock’s hand on the desk, rubbing the side of it softly with his thumb. And it just felt so natural, so right, that John forgot to be afraid of what he was doing, he forgot to worry about what the consequences may be.
lie.” He looks up, his eyes tired and wary. “Did you deliberately do it - take that much. Did you intentionally mean to-”
Mary rolls her eyes and turns sharply on her heels before heading back down the corridor, the stairs, back the way she came; taking the steps two at a time.
He hopes no one finds him here. He deliberately chose a place he’s never been, somewhere so far across town that it’s almost out of London. He can’t get caught. They won’t understand if he does, won’t listen.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says as she puts a fresh pillow behind his head and sets his tea down on the coffee table.
? That’s incredible. You're just-" John decided to cut himself off before he said something embarrassing. The table fell silent, and he smiled gently to himself before taking another sip of his beer. This, right now, was
Sherlock lifts both his hands and pushes firmly at the rounds of John's shoulders, just enough to make him sway backwards. He makes sure the force ripples slowly through John’s body, across his chest. It's a display of strength. A warning.
Thanks to everyone on Facebook who spurred me on with this fic and provided a lot of the photos. I do hope it was worth the wait.
Rosie turns the final page and clasps the book shut. She's too shocked for words. To think that these were always up here and they never sat down as a family and looked at them. These wonderful photos that show a beautiful story of friendship and then eventually love. And oh, how she loved them.
He sits back in his desk chair and rakes a tired hand through his hair. He should sleep. He needs to be up again in less than 5 hours.
Mycroft snatches it from his hands. He places the torch between his teeth and unravels it as fast as he can without making it rip.
Sherlock is saying his name again, his voice resonating faintly in his ears. Sharper. Rising in volume.
Sherlock tried to stifle his laugh but it escaped all the same, and soon they were both sniggering, hiding their fond looks behind twinkling eyes.
She pulls the nearest box towards her and coughs as a large cloud of dust rises up in her face in retaliation. She smears away the grit from the corner and sees that it’s labelled simply as ‘
It is! Mycroft sits up and reads the text several times over. His chest floods with relief once more. He’s ok. He’s awake. John is still with him. This is the best news he could have hoped for. He remembers the Methadone in his pocket and taps out a reply.
The motorbike engine roars loudly beneath her. The wheels screech and spin and she flies around corners, across junctions, past pedestrians. Not stopping for anything. She squeezes through the gaps between cars, overtakes the buses trundling across Westminster Bridge.
“Well of course we have to bloody tell her Sherlock,” John snaps, his tongue quick and sharp. “There's no way we can keep it a secret. Christ, I don't even
A busy square in Paris had never felt so silent. It was like the trees had stopped rustling, the people stopped talking. All John could hear was his heartbeat drumming frantically in his ears.
After several long moments of stroking, kissing and concealed moaning, John couldn't help but twist his head around to catch a glimpse of the door, for it really would be embarrassing if they got caught by Mrs Hudson now, on the floor devouring each other like desperate school boys.
John Watson sits hunched on the park bench beside him, edging further and further away by the minute. He scowls, his fists curled. He pulls his jacket further across his chest. “This is a big deal for me, Sherlock.”
to John that he means it. There’s just so much he needs to convey, so many details and feelings. So much he has no idea how to put into words.
Sherlock feels a wave of embarrassment roll in his stomach. He fumbles in his pocket for change. “Err, kind of.”
At that very moment the sound of heavy footsteps fills the room as the paramedics arrive, thundering up the stairs. They rush over, their green uniforms standing out oddly in the dark. There’s at least four of them carrying various different equipment. One holds a defibrillator and an oxygen mask, the other three lifting a stretcher. Mycroft shines his torch.
“Well err,” John turns and Sherlock notices the other man’s cheeks have flushed slightly. “It’s just that...he’ll deduce that we...you know, slept in the same bed. He’ll know because I probably smell of you or they’ll be a crease in my shirt or-”
“Wait-” John’s head is spinning. The sick feeling in his stomach had intensified to uncharted territory. He feels like he’s in a daze. Is he dreaming?
The light from the golden chandeliers glitters and sparkles. Waiters whisk out food on elegant silver platters, hundreds of different canapes tucked in between jars of olives and delicate pastries lined in rows. The orchestra sets itself up on stage, preparing their bows and music stands. They unclip their shiny instruments from their cases; listen carefully while plucking the strings to make sure they’re in tune.
The sun disappears as quickly as it arrived, vanishing back behind a building, allowing dark shadows to cast themselves across the insides of the cab once more.
He practically leaps from the car and makes off down the path towards the doorway. Red hot adrenaline pumping through his veins, fueling his system. He feels absolutely nothing other than the desire to run, the need to seek Sherlock out and help him immediately.
John gave him an exasperated look, one that had a certain degree of edginess about it. “It’s hardly a surprise Sherlock, it is our one year anniversary after all.”
Every fibre of Sherlock’s being makes him want to look away. For the shame is so overpowering, the embarrassment so strong, that it’s nearly impossible not to turn his head, to shut his eyes and retreat to the darkest and most private corners of his mind palace - to hide.
Down the far end of the hall, the barman is rolling up his sleeves and readying his stock, preparing drinks, cocktails, magnificent concoctions of alcohols and fruits. Ushers in sleek black suits move swiftly past him, polishing every doorknob, shining every surface; wiping it twice and making sure they can see their reflection before moving on.
He picks his way through the mess on the floor and makes it to the fridge. To his surprise, inside there is butter, and once he’s picked off the tiniest bits of mould from the corners, enough bread for both of them. He pops it in the toaster and clicks the kettle, leaning against the counter as it comes to boil.
“I don't know…” Sherlock tries, looking around hopelessly as if someone might pop out of nowhere and help him. “Maybe… sit down? Or something? Is that what people do?”
She flicks through the magazine tucked in the back of the seat in front of her. Sips her water. Anything to distract herself from the reality of what she’s doing.
“Just John then.” Sherlock breathed, the word rolling around his mouth as he processed it. He spoke slowly, carefully, as if it was the most interesting thing he’d learnt all day.
Without another second of hesitation Sherlock broke the moment by continuing to slide his hand up John's length and stroke, regaining his focus on John's neck with his mouth. And after a while John let his eyes flutter shut, relaxing completely, he wanted to remember every second of this, how Sherlock sounded, how he smelt, and how he tasted when John nibbled on his lower lip. Having Sherlock like this was an indescribable form of ecstasy, it was addictive, sensationally exhilarating, and most certainly heaven on earth. Nothing compared to the happiness he felt with Sherlock right now, and John doubted anything ever would.
The alleyway remains empty for a few seconds before a man with a long dark coat and a rumpled white shirt stumbles from a metal door on the left - likely the back of a club. His coat collar is up, and his scarf is hanging loosely around his neck. His hair is stuck together in clumps.
Sherlock watches and smiles, a cheeky grin spreading across his face, “Don’t fancy sneaking down in just your boxers then?”
Sherlock sways and staggers as he rises upwards. Every muscle in his body screams at him to stop. His vision blurs over once more. Out of the corner of his eye he can see John moving towards him, reaching out to steady his shoulder. His palm is about to make contact with his skin and-
Spurred on by this encouragement, Sherlock reaches out once more and slowly cups John's cheek with his palm. His fingertips come to rest just before the other man’s ear. Skin against his skin. John is completely still beneath him.
“Ah,” Mycroft’s feels his chest tighten against his will. He exhales lightly and stands up. Why does he feel shaky all of a sudden? Like there’s somewhere else he should be? He gathers up his coat and hooks his umbrella on his arm, glancing sideways before making a beeline for the door.
Time slows further. Each minute starts to last longer, dragging past like a death sentence; a form of torture. He rakes a shaky hand through his hair and tries to focus on taking deep heavy breaths. Should he plan out what to say?
Mycroft stands back and watches as the pair begin to shuffle forwards. Sherlock having to rely almost entirely on John. His arm drapes across his back, his head rests heavily on the other man’s shoulder. He winces in pain every time they take a step. His bare legs shaking, frail and unsteady. Pale against the hospital floor, weirdly exposed now that they're out in the open. The hospital gown only comes down to his knees.
Mary stands outside the infamous black door of 221B Baker Street and pauses for a moment to catch her breath.
The nurse lets go of her shoulder and tells her to go and find reception, but Mary pays no attention. She presses herself back against the wall, her brain still whirling, eyes darting.
Sherlock growls in frustration and reaches out to grab Mycroft’s blazer, pulling him closer so that he can whisper in his ear. He lowers his voice. “Think about it, brother dear. We only have a matter of
It’s like a thunderstorm. He can’t keep up. He’s falling and flying and spinning all at once. The world blurs and he’s yelling John’s name a rush of dopamine floods his brain.
Sherlock was hovering behind his desk, fringe over his eyes, self-consciously nudging at his chair with his foot.
Rosie remembers smiling and saying: "Ok daddy", while chewing on a bit of her hair, and that was that.
“Obviously it would be essential for you to lie the patient down with their legs up, if possible, to ensure remaining blood and therefore oxygen could get to the brain. Were you ever taught science?" Sherlock spat.
Time starts to feel slower. The steps to the flat are becoming fewer and fewer. The door is getting closer and closer. Her breath is becoming hard to keep steady.
"Yes," John said thickly, his face beginning to cloud over like thunder. "You've lost him again, haven't you?"
“Go away!” Sherlock grinds down on his teeth and inhales sharply. “Please, I'm begging you.” He tosses and turns on his back. Digs his nails into his palms so hard they start to bleed.
She’s already contacted KH, Dalvegur, and some other names from her past. People who might still be undercover on the streets. Agents. Waiting. Hiding. Working. More than one of them owes her a favour.
He tries to open his eyes but feels them rolling backwards. With great effort he shifts so that he’s lying flat on the mattress and tries to gather the strength to rip apart the remaining buttons on his shirt. Because, although it’s cold in here - he’s
“I have been informed of some…activities between you and a fellow soldier that are not appropriate.” The man takes off his glasses and rubs them on his shirt. It’s only now it becomes clear he’s talking to the unit Major. A burly man of six foot with a history of being exceptionally brutal to soldiers who step out of line. Everyone’s scared of him.
“Oh, I don't know.” Sherlock turns. He snuggles closer and rests his chin on John’s shoulder. “Fine? I would have thought we’ll be better than that.”
Sherlock sat forward in his chair, his eyes widening dramatically. “What?! We agreed we weren’t getting each other anything!” He exclaimed.
Mary ignores her and presses her hand across jacket pocket. Empty. It must have fallen out during the crash.
. John tried to snap himself out of it but he just couldn’t, he was drawn to Sherlock in a way he’d never been drawn to anybody. Without thinking he started moving forward.
“Mary!” Molly reaches forwards and grabs her friends arm. “Wait - slow down, what’s going on with you? Is everything alright?”
A lump appears in Sherlock’s throat. Because he's realised what else is filling the air now, taking over. It’s tension. Cold and distant, building up like a wall between them. It’s written all over John’s body language, in the way he's curled his fists, the way he refuses to look at him. The guilt he must be feeling is unbearable. Because he’s
... seductive. I- I struggle with this mind, John. With all the energy trapped inside me. It’s impossible to switch off, all these endless thoughts and emotions. I am haunted by the memory of Moriarty, by his ghost. When we were at Baker Street you used to help, but now... I'm burning up. I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm falling,
The worst part is that he's still got hours of the wedding left to go - the speech and the reception - hours left of pretending that he's ok when really he knows that the only person he's ever loved is being torn away from him. Really, it leaves him with nothing left to live for.
John's moans were low growls now and rather louder than Sherlock had originally asked for, but no matter, he had done well and there was little time left. He let his eyes flutter shut and braced himself for the end.
He stood up quickly, shaking as he rose from his chair. “I- Sherlock, I have to- this…” He made a vague gesture to the two of them. “It’s not right.. It just isn't, I ha- I have to go now.”
“Oh my god,” John drops instinctively to his knees, fumbles for his friend's pulse, but Mycroft suddenly comes up behind him and pushes him roughly out the way. He starts to search frantically through Sherlock’s pockets, as if his life dependes on it.
"Oh for christ’s sake Sherlock! You've already solved the case and they're not expecting us there until six. Can't we just have a little break?"
John’s voice fades as Mycroft passes through the doorway and rounds the corner. At the earliest opportunity he drops his head against the wall and lets out a long and shallow breath. Forces himself to gag several times but nothing comes. It's fear. Fear is pulsing through his bloodstream, sparking like electricity in his brain. It’s corrupting the signals, making the dots impossible to connect. He can hardly breathe, can’t
“I think…” Mycroft rests his hands underneath his chin. “This time he might be more motivated to take it.”
"SHH." Sherlock hissed, hastily bundling himself through the door and pushing them both out through the doorway onto the small landing by the steps. He pulled the door shut behind them with a click.
John is reaching over Sherlock's trembling body, grabbing his wrists and trying to pin them down, telling him that he needs to listen, to pull through. But it's simply not
“Shit,” John mutters under his breath. “He's getting worse. Sherlock? Sherlock, it’s okay I’m here.”
John withdraws his hand. His finger hovers for a moment as he rereads the message, double-checking it one last time.
At this point, she’s tired of trying to figure everything out, exhausted by it even. Nothing makes sense.
Hello again! Sorry it's taken me a while to update I've been busy! I'm still so unsure about this fic, to be honest I think it's awful but everyone else seems to be enjoying it so I guess I'll carry on. I hope you enjoy!
, that he doesn’t know if he can process it all. There’s red lipstick and long black eyelashes. Suit buttons that are straining to hold it together, dying to pop open. Sweat pearls along trimmed hairlines. Bows glide effortlessly across the strings of violins. Everything is movement. Smiles and teeth and sparkling eyes.
Mycroft pulls out his phone and taps in his MI6 login. He sets up a border alert for Mary’s description and gets two people on the job of locating her before John has finished his conversation. He’s annoyed at himself. He should have predicted this would happen.
He tilts his head back and soon his eyelids are collapsing under the weight of a 27 hour day. He must have drifted off at some point because his head is lolling messily against his shoulder when his phone vibrates underneath his fingers. He twitches, not bothering to open his eyes. It would be very easy to just ignore it and go back to sleep but there’s a slim chance it could be Sherlock and-
John whistled a silent sigh of relief. Sherlock was leaving and nothing wrong had happened. A smile broke out on his face as the tension drained from his body.
He hovers awkwardly for a moment before sitting back into one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs and pulling up his sleeve to check his watch. 4.49am. How long have they got? An hour? Maybe two if they’re lucky?
See! I told you I'd write something happy soon. Did you like it? I really hope so, because I worked very hard and was a lot more descriptive than I tend to normally be, so I hope that paid off and you could really visualise everything. Don't be afraid to tell me what you thought! Thanks must go to Kate (bigblueboxat221b) who helped me edit, and everyone on Instagram who got as excited about this idea as me and urged me to do it.
John still hasn’t noticed, his palm resting gingerly on his thigh. Slowly, Sherlock takes a shallow breath and reaches further, taking care to make his movements slow and delicate, cautious not to startle him. He holds his breath as their fingertips brush over each other. The touch so soft, so light and brief, that it sends tingles running down Sherlock’s spine.
To his relief, Sherlock’s slumbering body is still beside him. Naked and wrapped in the bedsheets, the curve of his figure poking out between the covers.
They wander over and wait in a queue for a moment - with John’s hand sliding nonchalantly around Sherlock’s waist - before their turn comes and the drinks are ordered. They get two large cocktails in curved glasses, the colour a rich, deep red, and make their way over to a clear spot of wall. They lean against it, sipping their drinks silently.
Sherlock locked eyes with John properly this time, his pupils darting from side to side, searching...reading him.
If the suffering guarantees John’s safety, he’ll carry on like this; chained up and beaten to his knees, until his heart stops beating.
Moriarty infectes his dreams like a slow acting disease, a cancer. A black poison that corners him from all directions. Snakes under his feet like a python, slides through his hair like smoke. Soon he’s everywhere.
Sherlock nods, trying his hardest to seem understanding. This whole experience is so foreign to him, so bizarre. They’ve never once sat down and talked about emotions and relationships, not like this.
She stops hesitating and steps forwards towards the door, trying to focus on calming her breathing. Her hand moves naturally to knock the lopsided brass knocker as she approaches, but, she suddenly realises she doesn’t have to.
“For god’s sake Sherlock,” Mycroft leans forward in his chair, lowering his voice a threatening octave. “You nearly died last night, and now your hands are shaking and your brow is sweating and we both know what those symptoms are the beginning of.” He takes a breath. “Withdrawal. Now please would you just listen to me-”
John was about to climb up Sherlock further and lunge for it again, when he felt a warm arm snake around his back, and in a heartbeat, Sherlock had leant in close to John’s ear, his breath sending an electrifying shiver running down John’s spine.
“Sure,” John raised his glass in return, his fingers were trembling but somehow he managed to keep his voice steady. “To...”
,” Sherlock tries again, “I just need something to take the edge off. Anything. Cigarettes, I don’t care. Get me some. I want this to stop.”
“Well I never,” The older Holmes widens his eyes. If John isn’t mistaken it looks like his jaw might be about to drop open.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches up in a smile and finds he can’t stop himself from rolling his eyes. “Alright, don’t start milking it. We’re not in EastEnders or whatever that crap is that everyone watches.”
A few quiet moments pass. The orchestra start to pick up the pace of their songs, upping the volume just slightly. Several couples stray onto the dance floor.
There’s a bang from inside, footsteps, before the front door creaks open. Sherlock catches a glimpse of John’s eye before he realises the trick and quickly tries to pull the door shut again. But he’s not quick enough, and Sherlock shoves his leg in the way, jamming it.
The atmosphere shifts. John’s sombre expression deepens. He tilts his chin. “You don't think I meant it?”
The sheets are not his own. The light is unusual. It’s too orange, too bright for his room. The surroundings are different. A sinking feeling seeps through his chest.
He's only a few months in and he’s broken his wedding vows - the whole thing makes him feel sick. Questions swirl endlessly in his head, like water twisting down a plughole. What will happen now? Who will look after Rosie? How will Sherlock react to this? Mary? Surely there’s no way back to the way things were?
John looks back over to him, breathless. The black curls of his hair have fallen into his eyes. His cheeks are as pale as ice. His lips struggle to retain any colour,  and his chest rises and falls unevenly. The arrogance is gone. Instead, John sees a man who is weak, injured. Exhausted and mentally unstable. He's long fallen over the edge of the clifftop, slipped into the abyss. Maybe he only resorted to drugs because he can't cope with it anymore, with seeing John with someone else. Because the light for him is gone. Because he wanted to make it all disappear. Maybe he only did it because-
“Rose,” A man’s voice drawls from the end of the phone, deep and throaty. A thick Romanian accent. “It’s been a while,”
A shuffling sound breaks the fragile silence that follows. Sherlock is sitting himself up in his chair, wincing as he moves, his eyelids heavy. His words come out as little more than a whisper.
hand. Caressing his skin, running a thumb over his lips. Softly, gently, ready to retreat at any moment. Sherlock slowly follows the movement, looks up, and
“John!” Sherlock said, raising his voice a little, he wanted to try and go after him but his stuff was still everywhere and he couldn't leave it.
Sherlock suddenly stops himself, returning sharply from the world he was just lost in, when he realises that John’s grip has tightened on the chair. So hard that his knuckles are turning white, and the eyes behind his hands are squeezed shut.
She pulls it out into her lap and turns it over in her hands a few times before cocking it to check it’s got ammunition. It feels nostalgic. Natural. The black metal glints in the light.
She places the album back in the box, trembling slightly. Once again, the attic dust makes her eyes water.
Mary is still looking at him. Confused and concerned. She tilts her head to one side questioningly, like a puppy that doesn’t quite understand.
"Yes. Why does Dopamine build up in the brain when you excessively take Cocaine over a 24 period?” Sherlock asked, his voice calm and low, his usual confidence seeming to return as he spoke.
For the first time in years she feels truly hurt. Confused and betrayed. Like a kid left out of the games at primary school.
She freezes in shock as her gaze travels over his greasy ruffled hair and tear-stained cheeks. The partly unbuttoned shirt that reveals a sheen of cold sweat covering his chest.
He steps outside to make a phone call and adds her to a ‘high security’ list, before sending a few people out to keep tabs on her every movement. After a minute, Anthea informs him she’s left the house and has dropped Rosie off with Mrs Hudson. Mycroft’s lips twitch as he watches some footage of her leaving and taking a cab south towards St Thomas’s Hospital, the blue dot showing her location moving steadily across his screen. Falling innocently into his trap.
Mycroft feels as if the world is collapsing around him. It’s like gravity has shattered into little pieces, slanted sideways. His whole body is starting to feel weightless, numb, and his vision takes a while to sharpen when he moves.
Sherlock nodded, still bent over the page, running his finger down the contents list until he apparently reached the subsection he wanted.
“So with an open wound to the arm, you would lift it up and use cold water to try and stop the swelling?” One of the adults asked.
She slows as her phone vibrates in her pocket. The number shows up blank. The caller ID is masked. Standard practice.
At that very moment everything evaporates into puddles of colour, and the surroundings shift; moving without order or rhythm. The colours pool into an uncategorised mess. Swirls of noise. Voices. Ground suddenly forms beneath his feet. He’s in the army tent headquarters, a month earlier. The walls are formed of faded orange fabric. John doesn’t remember how he got here.
Mary sits on her bedroom floor and shoves her things into her bag too quickly to give her mind a chance to catch up.
Of course, it was not only the glow of springtime London that was fuelling John's good mood. No, it was also the unmistakable pleasure of post-case glory.
- who died and came back from the dead, twice. Truth be told, he's been the real centrepiece of his life these past 6 years. Someone he’d do
“Thank you.” Sherlock whispered. His voice so quiet and hushed that John wasn't entirely sure he didn’t imagine it.
,” Sherlock stops and steadies himself on the doorway, panting heavily. There’s just something in the irony of it. He
"Anyway..." He continued loudly, coughing awkwardly as he gestured back to the PowerPoint. Praying everyone would take their focus from Sherlock and place it back on him.
“Oh come on...” Sherlock said breathlessly, his panting becoming heavier as he began to devour John’s face and neck. “You, love it.” He stated between kisses.
John slides his fingers into Sherlock's hair as his brain floods with chemicals, warm and mellow. It's like a gentle breeze on a summers day, soft laughter and music, all tainted yellow with happiness. Sherlock whimpers softly beneath him. Savouring every moment. Every second.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispers after a moment, moving his cheek and willing John to kiss him again, but not being bold enough to initiate it. "I'm sorry for everything."
John’s eyes snap from the window. He looks startled but doesn’t pull away. Sherlock holds his gaze, his pupils reflecting the soft glow of the sunrise, a burst of orange light suddenly streaming in through the window.
“Hmm,” John looks pensive. He can see the sweat patches dampening the back of Sherlock’s shirt. The trouser seams straining because of his position. His belt. “It doesn’t look very comfortable.”
ure they’ve had their ups and downs, but Mary doesn’t deserve this - to be cheated on and lied to - not one bit.
John shakes his head in disbelief, staring at Mycroft as if he’s just spoken in a different language. “Really?”
“Wow” John whistled as Sherlock undid the binders that trapped hundreds of pages of work in place. As Sherlock quickly skimmed through it to get to the right section, John’s mouth fell open as his eyes flickered over pages and pages of scrawled writing, decorated with what looked like occasional equations and experiment diagrams.
“That's enough. Give them back.” He intended his voice to be low and stern, showing he was not to be messed with.
John bends over and grips the bed, his head sagging between his shoulders. Clearly experiencing a fresh breakdown. “You were…” he can hardly say the word. “...tortured?”
“No.” John pauses before shaking his head. “Things weren’t working anyway, between me and Mary I mean.” The words muffle as he speaks into his hands. “Not really, not underneath. Not when everyone was gone and Rosie was in bed and we were... alone.” He shakes his head slightly, looking off warily into the distance, eyes dark. “I don't know. We argue and, I can't stop thinking about you, and-”
He braced his hands on Sherlock's shoulders and gazed down at him with a grudgingly stroppy look, trying very hard to resist matching it with pouted lips.
They look at each other for a long moment, before John turns away and pushes Sherlock’s bedroom door open for him, flicking on the light.
John knew he was now on the edge of orgasm, he took a deep breath and then suddenly he was gone, the feeling of it almost took him by surprise and he threaded his fingers roughly through Sherlock's hair and forced him deeper downwards as he came, making sure he swallowed. And that's when everything else blurred, his mind completely taken over with pure feeling. It was incredible and as John became lost in the moment, everything else seemed to vanish as he disappeared from the present and rode on the pure of ecstasy of it all.
Some of the students turned, slightly taken back  and to John’s relief the noise level slowly started to drop. John smiled, glad he’d managed to keep the shakiness out of his voice and successfully diverted the attention back to him. The boys were still shooting dirty looks of distaste in Sherlock’s direction, but they did that already, there was not much John could do.
“Fuck,” John pulls back abruptly, breathless.  “Sherlock… that's…” but he doesn't have a chance to finish, because all of a sudden Sherlock's lips are on his again. Needy. Urgent. Hot and heavy. John puts his hand on Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock starts fumbling at the buttons on John’s shirt. Desperate.
got to him, Sherlock seeing him being made a fool of…although John didn’t quite know why. Without much thought he dropped eye contact from everyone, deciding it was best to ignore the comment and swiftly try and move on.
Hi! So I know it's been a while I'm sorry. I'm so incredibly busy studying journalism at the moment that I hardly get any time to write anything that isn't articles! But, I was feeling rather down this evening and this just sort came out. It's not very long and as always it's not very good but...anyway. I hope you like it. Sorry in advance for the feels. You might also want to read the notes at the end too...
Sherlock remains silent, purses his lips, and after a moment the man starts to press harder, moving the knife down to Sherlock's throat, drawing a slim slit of blood to the surface.
The murmur of low voices greets her ears as she climbs the final stair and tiptoes onto the landing. She takes another silent step forward. Pauses. The talking becomes clearer.
“Err…” John sits forward in the chair and instinctively holds out his hands, offering, debating whether to stand and help. Concern and confusion sweeps across his tired features, sets into his brow.
This works a LOT better if you read it on the computer instead of a phone, as I could not control the shape or size of the images which was irritating, and editing them all separately would've been far too time consuming, but hopefully you can look past that for me and lose yourself in the story anyhow.
He didn't need defense...well. He didn't want Sherlock to put himself in the firing line for him anyway, and clearly he was now, as the reaction from the boys was one of outrage. The shouted and swore, banging on the tables with their fists.
“It's not though, is it?” John looks at the scars again: hundreds of small red marks, evidence of weeks of torture and humiliation. “You went through so much, and I sat here, in bloody England, doing… well doing fucking nothing!” he shakes his head and rubs his eyes to stop a fresh wave of tears from filling them. “I wish I'd known, Sherlock. I really do. I could have helped you. I could have done something. Why didn't you tell me?”
The ride to the park passes in companionable silence. The roads are busy with many people travelling to and from “Station X”. Two of the official buses overtake them, enveloping them in a cloud of diesel smoke and dust. After a short period of queuing while the sentries check each arrival’s papers, they enter the park and head towards the canteen. Sherlock spots Molly Hooper sitting on the a stretch of lawn next to it, in the company of two other girls he recognises as TypeX clerks from Hut 8, colleagues of Molly.
Sherlock gave him a long glance. To John’s surprise, he didn’t look bored. Then again, when did he ever fail to enjoy a chance to show off his deductive powers in front of an audience, particularly if John was part of it?
Sherlock’s smile broadened, creating crinkles round his eyes, and doubling his chin. John loved when he looked like this. “Well done. Can you guess their motive?”
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat. He ducks his head. “I don’t do it just to impress you, you know,” he mutters. “It comes naturally.”
John laughs, too. “Yes, perhaps. Anyway, strange though this dream was, it was a welcome change from those cursed nightmares. I’ll take crazy visions about dragonets and you any time over drowning, or seeing my mates die with me reaching out to save them and failing every time. There were times when I actually dreaded falling asleep. It’s better now, but these dreams still come up – like last night. Do you ever have nightmares?”
“So it would seem. She has included a card with her address and private telephone number. Apparently she wants to stay in touch.” Sherlock returns letter and card to the envelope and adds Molly’s telegram. “Come on, let’s get ready and talk to Wiggins, and call back Molly. Do you need help with your bandage?” The linen strips have loosed a little during their lovemaking. John moves his shoulder experimentally but shakes his head.
This time, the two mares seemed too tired to greet the foal as it whinnied. John felt rather guilty for having to leave them outside in what was gearing up for another shower. But the bunker appeared crowded enough as it was. The door had been heaved almost to, only allowing for a sliver of lamplight to spill through the opening.
Sherlock’s gaze on him was calculating. “Would you want that? Either do it, or have it done to you?”
“We’re still working on finding her,” said Lestrade with a weary shrug. “It’s possible that she perished in the bomb raid, or else managed to evacuate in time and is still staying with relatives, now that their house has been reduced to little more than rubble. The bomb damage is fresh, from this week. A lot of people are still in shelters, or they left for the holidays. The shop had been closed all week, the neighbours said. Anyway, so this chap, Northam, why would he be carrying his old rations book and passport if he’s been living under a false identity for four years?”
Still, John couldn’t help wondering whether Sherlock expected more to come of this activity, whether John was expected to touch him other than carefully holding him in place. Sherlock made no move towards putting his hands on John apart from holding his head at the perfect angle for snogging the life out of him. He simply kissed, and kissed, and kissed until John felt dizzy and his lips tingled and the skin around his mouth began to feel itchy from the scratch of Sherlock’s faint stubble. John kissed back with increasing force, which only seemed to cheer Sherlock on to up his game.
And now he’s here again with Mycroft, reliving a moment from earlier. How do they call it? When one thinks one has experienced an event before? A French word, isn’t it? Or has he hit his head so hard he’s lost consciousness? Is he in a coma now? Or dead? Sherlock doesn’t believe in heaven or hell. But perhaps there is an afterlife. It’s not too bad if Redbeard is there, being his happy self. And Mycroft ... well ... he has his uses, too, and can be a good big brother occasionally, although he has clearly become more insufferable now that he has left home and gone to that posh school with the poncy jackets and the silly hats.
Sherlock has lost count of the steps and the turns of the staircase as it screws upwards, ever upwards with seemingly no end in sight. Thankfully, the steps are evenly spaced so that once he has found his rhythm, he can force himself to simply put one foot in front of the other without the fear of stumbling in the dark. His pursuers have gained a little, judging from the sound of their curses and panting breaths. But so far, the light of their torches doesn’t reach him. He feels as if either his legs or his heart are going to give out after the next step, but somehow, he manages another, and another, almost losing hope of ever reaching the end of this cursed staircase – when suddenly, his foot meets empty air.
Sherlock stared at the telly for a moment, obviously debating whether something as ordinary as watching a children’s film on a Sunday afternoon was really worth his time, but eventually he sighed, settled back into the sofa more comfortably and began applying jam and clotted cream to his scone. John knew he was going to stay.
Even though he has seen Sherlock asleep before, John is, once again, stricken at how young he looks like this: the keen focus and intensity stripped from his features, the hard lines smoothed out, his mouth slack, his eyes hidden by soft-looking lids and long lashes. A speck of drool soaking the pillow at John’s shoulder adds to the impression of Sherlock at his most unguarded, most human. John swallows hard as he watches, unable to withdraw his gaze. Protectiveness wells up in him, as well as a feeling of deep connectedness that has nothing to do with sex but all to do with intimacy. According to what Sherlock hinted at about his past, John might well be the only person to ever witness him like this. Nobody else has been allowed that close, not even Victor Trevor, despite the fact that by all accounts they exchanged saliva at one point.
Fifteen minutes later they sit at the small table in a corner of the room, ensconced on two sides by windows overlooking a dark garden. It’s raining again, drops pattering against the panes. Both men are wrapped in dressing gowns over pants and t-shirts. John’s hair is curling in his nape, as it always does when it’s still partly wet. As always, Sherlock fights down the urge to touch it.
Sherlock switches off his phone and puts it on his bedside table. “I’ll survive. I should like to have a private word with Victor, but given he is accommodated somewhere across town and I’m in no mood to set out again tonight, that’ll have to wait.”
Sherlock is confused. “Yes?” His fight with the blanket was embarrassing for him and weird for the outside observer. But John doesn’t need to know what caused Sherlock’s momentary confusion.
The lift shafts. They’re about the only possibility. He could climb down, make himself small, and hope that nobody will check there. But why should anybody check? Whoever is on the stairs is likely to come for Nora Perkins and him, assuming her dead and him still incapacitated and tied up. So, lift shaft it is: climb in, wait for them to pass, climb out, dash up the stairs and hope to get out.
John quickly lets go of Sherlock’s hand and stows the bar into his back pocket. Soon after, the peloton sets in motion and the race is on.
I really can’t tell them apart. The one with this Dark Vader character or whatever he’s called. It might be a bit too exciting for you”
“No, it’s all very hush hush. Not even Molly knows, and she usually knows everything. Well, I guess we’ll see soon. Perhaps you’ll be rooming with that new bloke. Or you’ll have a room to yourself for once.”
“I’m not sure. So far, we didn’t have any issues with Brook Consulting. They tried to prop us up against the other teams, mostly CAM, Baskerville, and especially Shad Sanderson. Despite some mishaps, Wilkes is still the biggest candidate for winning this Tour. He’s going to go full-in tomorrow to win back time and has good chances of doing so. And he’s good in the mountains. Last year, he basically won the race in the Alps when they were the last mountain range before Paris, and he’s going to try the same in the Pyrenees this year. Fratelli did mention the time trial, said he could help me win.” He draws himself up. “As if I needed his doubtful chemicals to win tomorrow,” he declares contemptuously.
“Okay. But let us know if things take a turn to the worse. We have another call nearby and would return here if required.”
“You’re right. Let’s save the kissing for later, and do it properly then,” said Sherlock, sobering up. John thought he looked tense again.
It’s almost eight o’clock and dusk has fallen when they finally prepare to leave Ivy Farm. Sherlock has spent almost half an hour on the phone with Tiltman, explaining their find and waiting until copies have been typed and the motorcycle courier is on her way to Bletchley. Afterwards, a proud Kenworthy leads them to the radio operator who intercepted the messages and who has just started her shift.
Silence falls. John picks up a small piece of cement rubble and throws it into the water, watching it sink and circles form on the surface.
John shakes his head vehemently. “No, it isn’t. It isn’t. You deserve better. You deserve someone who puts you first, always.”
Sherlock grins at him. “We’ve just caught you a murderer. The man here, Jefferson Hope, is responsible for three of the so-called ‘serial suicides’ – which of course weren’t suicides at all, as I kept telling you, but you wouldn’t listen. We happened upon Mr. Hope here when he was in the process of committing a fourth murder. The victim, a lady in pink, is upstairs. She may need some assistance as she’s probably suffered a bit of a shock.
Moran scowls at the trio, sucks on his cigarette again, then squares his shoulders. “Be quick, I have an appointment in half an hour.”
“It’s not far now, dear,” says Mummy. She casts a quick glance over her shoulder at him. “I have to say I’m actually a bit surprised by your eagerness to visit your cousins. I thought you didn’t like them. Didn’t you implore us not to leave you with Daniel and Christopher this summer?”
Mrs. Suffield’s face screws up in worry. “What will the neighbours say?” she mutters, squeezing her handkerchief in the pocket of her apron.
A mewling sound next to his feet announces Hattie’s return. Sherlock scoops her up and settles her on his lap. “And you, too. You truly love me, don’t you? If only because I’m the one idiot who pets you regularly.”
He winces when scattered raindrops hit his face and begin to coat his sunglasses. He has reached a dense layer of cloud chasing up the hillside and is soon swallowed by cold, grey mist. The road is already damp and is getting increasingly wet the further he rides. Rivulets of water are trickling over the tarmac from the elevated side of the road. Visibility drops to under fifty metres. John slows down carefully. The dust on the road combined with rainwater has turned the surface slippery and dangerous.
John keeps a close eye on Moriarty and his teammates during the remainder of the stage. Wiggins waves off a camera motorcycle, obviously unwilling to be filmed. John doesn’t know much about him, only that he is still young and riding his second or third Tour. Given his lean, lanky physique, he is predestined for a
“Yes. I’m not proud of that, to be honest. This whole secrecy thing, it was a bit of a nightmare. And it wasn’t ... what we did ... I mean, it was mostly hand jobs, quick and functional. I once tried a blow job and it was a bit of an disaster because we’d left the shower on and the water got into my eyes and nose and then turned icy cold suddenly. I ended up spluttering for breath and then slipping and sprawling on the floor. At least we got a good laugh out of it.”
“Team Carrefour’s Francis Bernard won the stage,” announces Greg a short while later. “His teammate Lachapelle was right behind him. Lachapelle let him win, which was decent of him as he’s taking over white and Bernard rode in the wind for most of the last few kilometres. Philip’s third. Kit came in sixth, about half a minute after Lachapelle. Great work, boys. If John and Sherlock don’t do anything stupid before the finish, we’ll be leading in the team classification tonight. Excellent job all round.”
“You can go first. I didn’t pack any pyjamas, just a t-shirt for each of us, but I think I’ve seen dressing gowns near the door. And here,” he hands Sherlock a stack of clothes from the bag: pants, socks, shirt, t-shirt, and, surprisingly, a pair of dark jeans Sherlock hasn’t worn in years.
He still fears his cousins, though, and goes to great lengths to hide his true destination every time he sets out from Ellie’s in the afternoons. Mostly, that’s around lunchtime when he can be sure that Daniel and Christopher and whoever is around for the day are inside eating. He chooses different routes to climb up to the Downs, and on those two times one of his cousins sees him leave Ellie’s house, she tells them that she’s sending Sherlock to run errands for her, always to people the boys consider horrible.
Now it’s her turn to laugh. “The truth? And what is that? Depending who you ask, there are so many different definitions of it.”
Molly is there, too, as are her landlady Mrs. Suffield, and her other housemate, Jamaican Bombe supervisor Sally Donovan. Next to her sit Brenda and her friend Deirdre. All are dressed in dark, respectful colours, as indeed are Sherlock and John. More flamboyantly attired but still respectable are Jim Moriarty and his fellow band member Charlie the pianist, both of whom are clad in dark suits and ties, their hats resting on their laps. However, as a tribute to Jennifer Wilson they are wearing pink dahlias in their buttonholes. The only person truly sticking out in the sea of drab colours is Irene Adler, dressed all in (admittedly rather dark) pink, her fashionable black hat adorned with a pink flower as well. Sherlock recognises it as loosestrife, which grows in the quarry where Jenny died. A quick gaze at Irene’s shoes confirms that she must have been there to pick the flowers, and perhaps say a more personal farewell to her love. The hat’s short veil hides her eyes, making her expression difficult to see. Her pink lips stick out, though. Sherlock wonders if she has somehow acquired one of Jenny’s pink lipsticks, since usually, crimson lips are her trademark.
John shook his head. That man, brilliant and singular as he was, nevertheless often seemed like a giant toddler who constantly needed someone to look after and entertain him.
Sherlock gave him a sharp glance. “We weren’t together,” he snapped. “If that’s what you’re implying.”
He closed his eyes again, lulled by the gentle sound of traffic through the closed window and the steady breathing of his companion next to him.
John’s hand comes up to cover his and press it against his chest. “I missed you, too.” He turns so that they are facing each other and leans in to kiss Sherlock’s nose, followed by his mouth. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
The water for the bath is already running when Sherlock joins John in the bathroom. John has prepared towels and is looking for something in the cabinet above the sink. “Not sure if you’ll want a shave, but ...,” he shrugs, rubbing the back of his neck a little bashfully.
He walks back to his bike. Realising that John is not behind him, he turns to see the doctor standing with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders drawn up, shaking his head as he gazes at Sherlock.
“A position I’m filling rather happily,” quipped John. He urged Tjálga closer by a few paces, but then several things happened at once. From the direction Sherlock and the two quad drivers had disappeared a mighty crash sounded, followed by the high-pitched whinny of a horse and another crash. Reflexively, his heart gripped by worry, John turned in the direction, only to become almost unsaddled when Tjálga reared with a cry of pain. Clinging onto saddle and mane desperately so as not to fall, his feet having slipped from the stirrups, John tried to regain control of his upset horse which was rearing and bucking angrily.
“Don’t know,” replied John honestly. “Perhaps not. I always had this vague idea of settling down at some point after serving my time in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Wife, kids, perhaps a dog and a surgery of my own, either in London or out in the countryside. But I guess it was just a fantasy based on what I thought I wanted, and what people expected. And then I got shot and everything went arse-up, and moreover then I met you, and you managed to turn my life around entirely once again. And I don’t think I’d want the other option now, although a dog would still be nice at some point. I’ve always wanted one, already back when I was a kid. Pity you hate them.”
John whistles softly, running a hand through his hair. “Wow. This Tour ... it’s something else, isn’t it? I’m sure there have been criminal activities during other stage races as well, but I must say I’ve never been aware of what was going on.”
Sherlock sighed, turning his head to gaze at John steadily. “I lied. It does alarm me. In fact, the idea of it, or rather, the idea of my ... active involvement in it scares the shit out of me.”
“Yeah, maybe. But it’s not enough for my employers, not by far. They have one goal this year and one goal only: Jim winning this fucking race. It wouldn’t even be okay if Moran or I or anybody else of our boys managed to come first. It has to be Jim fucking Moriarty. Bloody arsehole slave-driver that he is. I hate him.”
They gaze at each other across the table. Sherlock considers what else to ask Wilcox, in the hope of learning more about his background and his insight into Irene Adler. So Wilcox is after Moran, too? A thought strikes Sherlock. “I understand you can’t divulge much about your work, but there are several matters that have come up in our investigation of the Wilson case, and in connection with that Lord Moran, that I require more information on, in order to solve the case and not swamp Scotland Yard with unnecessary work.”
John snorted and shook his head. “Seriously, Sherlock, is this your attempt at seducing me? Or no, don’t answer that. But tell me this: if I were to, don’t know, push you down onto the bed and start kissing your neck while my hand wanders down over your belly and begins to open your trousers … what would you do then?”
Sherlock resists the temptation to roll his eyes and comment that if a normally observant dog-walker can spot them so easily, the quarry isn’t a good hiding place after all. John is clearly thinking the same, judging from the looks he gives first Daniel and then Sherlock. The latter refrains from commenting because he is actually grateful for any distraction to lure Daniel away and get him out from under his feet.
“Of course,” announces Sherlock. “Give me an hour or two. Do not go to the police yet. Wait here until I return and we can discuss further proceedings. Likely we’ll need to inform people at our workplace and have them look into the matter. I will know more once I’ve seen the body.”
, the famous climbers of the Tour the France, and how he’d been present when Richard Virenque wore the polka-dot jersey at Alpe d’Huez ten years ago, and that after the Galibier they had to attempt the twenty-one hairpin bends of this famous climb. John only understood half of his talk, his French functional at best, but Sherlock struck up a lively conversation during their short ride in his fluent, almost flawless French.
While John orders their food and fetches their drinks, Sherlock finds them a fairly secluded corner near one of the grimy windows. The table is sticky with ale, so he wipes it with a handkerchief, before sinking onto the hard bench and drawing up a chair to rest his injured leg. It hurts every time he puts weight on it, and even at rest the wound pounds painfully. At least the bandage seems to be holding. He tries to ignore it the pain. He can’t afford to be injured now. His leg will have to bear him at least until tomorrow.
“I ... I don’t know. I never considered it before, not seriously. What about you? You never struck me as the marrying type.”
Mummy’s old friend Dr. Barbara Rawlings, a former lecturer of mathematics at Cardiff University, runs a bookshop and small publishing house in Hay and is involved in the organisation of Hay Festival as well as a number of local charities. She is a large woman dressed in colourful scarves and sustainable hemp garments, her short, originally white hair dyed bright ginger with Henna, the faint smell of stable clinging to her indicating that she dabbles in animal husbandry (
“His neck was cricked somewhat strangely,” she told Lestrade, John and Sherlock when they joined her in her large kitchen after a brief tour of the garden where the wicked ladder still lay tipped over amidst fallen apples, upturned buckets and several wooden crates of fruit. Sherlock had been complaining about Mrs. Herdman, the ambulance and lastly police trampling the grass and obliterating all potential traces.
get out of here to see John and sunlight and the Sussex Downs again. Taking another calming breath, he considers where best to hide. On the side of the corridor he followed, there were no more doors or recesses. No place to hide there when the tunnel is illuminated, even if it’s only by a small torch or a mobile phone. Where else? He could risk going up the stairs and hope for a basement level where he could sneak out. But he has no idea how deep he is underground. Judging by the temperature and his assumption that this station is on the Piccadilly Line which runs quite deep in central London, almost as deep as the Northern Line, the staircase is long. Since he doesn’t know where exactly the people coming down it are, the risk of running into them on the stairs is too high.
The corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitch in a smile. “Yes. And with you. He told me in no uncertain terms that I was an idiot and that I should grab what lay in front of me and stop dithering. He spoke quite highly of you, if you want to know. The way you helped him when he was unwell made a huge impression on him, particularly because he thought you thought I was trying to get back together with him. And he was right, wasn’t he?”
Bad new first: this is not the last full chapter (before the epilogue). It's only the first half of it. I had to split it because it was threatening to become too long. There will be a chapter 22, and then a short epilogue. The good news is that you'll get an additional illustration and probably some more (or more detailed) sexytimes in the next chapter.
The arrival is no reporter, however. Flanked by a young woman in dark livery, her hair pulled back under a chauffeur’s cap, a tall, broad, elderly lady arrayed in a sable coat and a fashionable hat adorned with black and turquoise pheasant feathers has stepped into the station, her high-heeled shoes clicking sharply on the flagstone floor. A cloud of floral perfume (
With a sigh, he placed the bag he was carrying on the ground to don his jumper against the cool evening air. The bag contained some rolls of pizza bread for Sherlock should he feel inclined to attend to his body’s needs after all. The Italians were talking in their own language, apparently about who was still able to drive. Most had had more than two glasses of wine and the grappa, so in John’s mind neither was. Moreover, since French regulations concerning driving and alcohol had been tightened severely recently, they’d run the risk of losing their licence if caught, despite the drive being a short one. In the end they decided to walk and fetch the car the next day. John approved, as he had been ready to discourage any of them from getting behind the wheel.
“I think we’re fine, thanks Ellie,” says Vanessa, obviously referring to the tea. Sherlock nods. He has spotted a half-solved Sudoku amidst the stack of papers. Ellie always had a knack for riddles. Several crossword magazines sit in the stack. But this one wasn’t solved by her. The handwriting is different. She’s been writing with her left hand ever since her stroke, the other person was right-handed. He smiles to himself. Obvious.
Turing licks his lips, casts a quick glance at Denniston who sighs. “Anthea, would you please cease your note-taking for a moment. What is being discussed now should not make it into the statement.”
Tiffany beams at him. “Oh yes, I’d like that.” Then she sobers up a little. “I hope they won’t be too angry.”
Sherlock blinks, nods. “Yes. I was just thinking.” He clears his throat, looking a little uncertain. “You don’t have to stay with me, you know. Today might be your last chance to win a stage in your professional cycling career.”
She laughs and shakes her head. “Look at you, John Watson. You are beaming. You’ve been enjoying yourself tremendously, haven’t you, out there having adventures with Sherlock.”
muses John as he sprints across the bridge spanning the Serpentine, people on boats calling up to him and waving, with Christo’s gigantic purple edifice floating behind them.
“Well, our wet state would have required us to seek shelter in the hostel and since it’s almost fully booked, we would have been forced to share a narrow bed.”
“Well, if he intends to scarper, he must do so on foot, since his car is blocked by mine,” states Lestrade with a grimly satisfied smile. “And if he runs, I’ll have a warrant for him in no time. It could be construed as an admission of guilt, you see.”
“You didn’t go there on a holiday with your family,” stated Sherlock. John knew why he spoke with so much conviction. He’d been through his childhood photos several times. He watched Sherlock study him, entertained by his friend’s fascination with this new riddle.
“Do you have any?” John countered, his mouth quicker than any regulatory thoughts. God, this was awkward. But blokes talked about these things, didn’t they? Okay, perhaps Sherlock didn’t. John briefly wondered if he’d ever received the Talk from his parents. Certainly not from his father. His scientific minded mother, perhaps. Or Mycroft. God, how would that have gone? But most likely he’d just been pointed to the relevant section of a book and left there.
Gazing up at the sliver of sky, he finds his suspicion confirmed. Clouds have moved up from the south-west, and the wind has freshened up, sighing and moaning in the branches. Sherlock wonders if the wind has woken him. He looks about him once more. Some of the sheep seem to have meandered between the trees. Has one of them stepped on a fallen branch and so caused a noise? As was the case back at the dew pond, Sherlock has the distinct feeling of being watched. Yet try as he might, he can’t locate the source of the feeling. It’s none of the sheep, he is certain. They seem entirely oblivious of the lone human in the grove, minding their own business as sheep do. Is somebody else here? A hiker, perhaps, or one of the children from the village? Has the farmer come to look after his animals?
Only when Sherlock chuckles, the sound reverberating through his chest, John rouses and stretches a little to gaze blearily at the screen. “What are you watching?” he murmurs.
Many of these underground places have been reclaimed recently and turned into luxury living spaces, garages, swimming pools, mushroom or even vegetable farms, or fancy night clubs and restaurants. During the excavations for the new Crossrail line under London, plenty of formerly forgotten spaces and a wealth of archaeological treasure were discovered. No wonder Nora Perkins, a trained historian, was fascinated by them.
“No,” replied Sherlock, not rising to the bait and countering with a witty repartee, thus worrying John. “I forgot.” As if berating himself for the oversight, Sherlock’s lips narrowed and he frowned, before his expression darkened even more. “The journey was a complete waste of time,” he burst out forcefully. “I shouldn’t have gone.”
“Could that be a carnival hat?” asks Sherlock. “Cologne – and indeed the entire Rhineland – is famous for it, and the date of February would fit, too. Moran was last there in 1939 and has friends in the area. And the cathedral would be Cologne Cathedral, with the river Rhine in front if it.”
John nips his exposed collarbone, causing Sherlock’s breath to hitch in a very interesting way. “Ah yes, that’ll be such a chore.”
He pecks Sherlock on the lips, clears his throat and steps back. “Right. Loo, comfy clothes, talk. Or ... whatever we decide to do in your bed. See you in a moment.” Grinning broadly at Sherlock, he walks over to his bags, retrieves a pair of jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a thin blue jumper – the woollen Aran one he is wearing is probably too warm and scratchy – and sets out in the direction of the bathroom.
“Sherlock, listen. I’m not going to make you talk about the dream. But don’t believe for a second that I’ll leave you alone in this state because you’ve convinced yourself in your general low regard for your … don’t know … worth or something that you don’t deserve a bit of care and kindness. Jesus, Sherlock, I’m your best friend, and hopefully even more than that. You can trust me even if you trust nobody else. I want to help you, and be there for you if you’re having a shitty time, all right?”
He thought for a moment. “Although some of the algae growing on it are rather fascinating since they usually only appear in limestone caves. This tells you that the concrete of the ceiling must contain a high percentage of calcium carbonates and … what?”
John sighs and sniffs again, wiping at his nose. “Yes. I’m sorry. It’s just ... a bit much right now.”
John groaned, rolling his eyes. “If you’re implying that I’m suddenly his muse or something, stuff it right here. The only inspiration he needs is his own brilliance.”
Again thanks to all who are following this story and have left comments or kudos, and who are simply reading along. This is a shorter chapter than usual, again brilliantly betaed by rifleman_s. Hope you enjoy.
John smiled to himself as he studied his friend’s dimly lit profile and the fond, slightly wistful expression. Even though he’d not seen any pictures of Sherlock as a child so far, a mental image of a small, skinny, tousle-haired boy emerged wearing ratty corduroy trousers and a striped jumper and carrying a bag full of things he had found on the beach or out on the chalk downs or in the woods: an adventurer and explorer, and despite his extraordinary intelligence an ordinary kid in his interests. In fact, as John had noticed before, prolonged exposure to the outdoors often caused Sherlock to revert back to this adventurous, nature-loving boy, despite his claims to the contrary.
There at the table, Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Hudson and John Watson are assembled at breakfast. Mrs. Turner is in the process of pouring tea, while her sister is handing a jar of blackberry jam to the doctor. All three look up in surprise when Sherlock shoves the unhappy Molly through the door.
“Thank you,” he manages, wiping his eyes. “And cheers for everything you’ve done, particularly Jonathan here.” He reaches out to pull Dimmock against him and kisses his cheek. “Wouldn’t have made it without you, mate.”
The saloon bar of the Three Horseshoes is busy with locals and a few soldiers stationed in the village – too busy, actually, for Sherlock’s liking. His head is throbbing painfully and his entire body feels sore. He is tired. He is also hungry and very thirsty, but would have preferred a meal in the quiet privacy of their room or even the dark garden than spending time in the noisy, stuffy room that smells of ale and cigarette smoke.
He hangs his head, sniffs and swallows several times. The knuckles of his hands on the sink are white because he is gripping the rim so tightly. Angrily, he lifts one hand and cuffs its back over his hale eye. “Bloody hell,” he whispers, his voice breaking as he hides his face in his hand. His shoulders are shaking
No, Sherlock decides, dealing with people isn’t his strong suit. It’s unnecessary and overrated most of the time, anyway. He is more content out here, surrounded by bees. The only distraction people provide is of an intellectual kind. Most are interesting to deduce, hiding small clues all over themselves in their bearing, way of speech, their clothing, the shape and state of their hands and fingers. All those little details most people overlook because they don’t observe properly. That’s were Sherlock’s expertise and special talent lie. At a glance, he is able to deduce a person’s life story and habits, which in turn enables him to often predict their behaviour. More than once his uncanny skill has come in handy for devising cribs by deducing mistakes made or short-cuts employed by the German operator on the other side. Sherlock’s skill with languages (Latin, Greek, German, French, some Dutch and Flemish and Italian, a little Danish and Russian) and generally quick wit help, but in these he is not exceptional at Bletchley.
Lyons grins and claps his back. “Next year, you can ride for me.” They high-five each other just as Dimmock cries, pointing at the screen, “Whoa, careful there.”
Actually, John is surprised that he doesn’t mind the abstinence. Formerly, sex has always been an important part of the relationships he’s had. Sometimes, sex was basically all of it, particularly on those few occasions he was involved with men. With Sherlock, everything is different. John respects his needs. They talk about things. Sometimes. When he’s in the mood and not working on cases or otherwise distracted, Sherlock likes kissing and the odd cuddle. John has never been very demonstrative like this, and was surprised to realise how much he enjoys it, too, not just the holding, but also the being held. They have shared a bed now and again, although Sherlock seems to value his privacy some nights. Sometimes, he doesn’t sleep at all, or just naps on the couch. They have been keeping the separate bedrooms for the time being. Particularly during the past two weeks with temperatures rising above 30 degrees in London during the day, and muggy, tropical nights, John appreciated the arrangement. It simply was too hot to sleep next to the furnace that is Sherlock.
“About half an hour. Oh, didn’t I tell you? Both Wilkes and Victor have rescheduled our meetings to this morning, claiming other engagements for the evening.”
She nods into the direction of her friend and John. “Oh, don’t say that. You’re a good dancer. In fact, I’m feeling a bit inadequate. But it’s plain to see that your interests lie elsewhere.”
“Yes,” mutters Sherlock. “You just ... surprise me so often. Whenever I thought I had you figured out, you present another side of yours I didn’t anticipate.”
John’s next words make him look up sharply. “Come to think of it, I’ve only had two committed relationships in my life.”
“I agree,” says Lestrade. “The only thing I wonder about is whether he really didn’t know about her new flame, if there really was one. I’ll make sure to ask him again tomorrow, and put a little more pressure on him, too, if required. Poor kid, though. Wonder if he’ll manage to pull himself together enough to play again tonight. He seemed pretty rattled. And who’s that Woman the black chap mentioned?”
Sherlock lets his hand slide down to the slender wrist. He encounters a small bracelet there with a few pendants dangling from it. No pulse, though. No rigor mortis anymore, either, he notices when he checks the finger joints. So whoever she is, she must have been dead for more than thirty-six hours.
The others seem to like the idea. It’s better than the chest in the attic, thinks Sherlock. “No, he’s the monster,” says Daniel darkly. “There’s something very wrong with his head, you know. Mum said he’s even been to a therapist, like a proper nutcase. He’s mental, that’s what he is.”
Of course the Talk (Sherlock believes the capitalisation is absolutely necessary) doesn’t happen. They do discuss last night’s events over breakfast – brunch, rather – at which they are joined by their hosts and, not entirely surprisingly, Barbara. Sherlock is still not sure what exactly they encountered down in Cusop Dingle. Part of him is tempted to rationalise the incident, blaming darkness, heightened emotions, the storm and the fallen tree and use them to explain both Remington’s panic as well as John’s and his own terror. The fact that both the lamp and John’s torch hadn’t worked just when they had been most needed could have been mere coincidences. Sherlock doesn’t expect to find any clear traces of a shadowy host this morning. Mayfield’s drive and front garden will be a mess of footprints and car tracks from the many helpers who flocked to the house last night. The heavy rain will have added to the obstruction. So again, nothing conclusive will be found to prove one theory or another.
Sexually, they do experiment a little more, but by an unspoken agreement, they don’t venture further than occasional fellatio, usually content with bringing the other to climax with their hands only. Sherlock still gets overwhelmed easily, prefers to touch John instead of being touched intimately. John respects this and even though Sherlock can tell that sometimes, he’d like to reciprocate to give something back to Sherlock, he never insists on doing so. Sherlock fears that anything even bordering on penetration would overwhelm him entirely. John touches his perineum once, rather by accident, and Sherlock nearly blacks out from the sensation. He deduces that even though John seems to have made peace with his own queerness to some extent by now, he is still reluctant to allow himself to desire any acts that are undoubtedly homosexual. Therefore, ‘buggery’ is out of the question, in whatever form and neither of them considers their relationship lacking without it. So while the sex continues to be enjoyable, frightening, overwhelming, exhilarating, fascinating and never boring, Sherlock knows that if he had to choose, he’d opt for the quieter kinds of intimacy, the talking, kissing, simply spending time together over more passionate activities. What John refers to as ‘cuddling’ ranks amongst his favourite activities. When they are in bed together and John’s arms are around him, or his around John, and they are close enough to feel the other’s heartbeat, Sherlock’s ever active mind rests. He feels safe and treasured. And he craves it, more than he is willing to admit, and wonders what will happen when John is gone. But whenever thoughts of parting creep up, he banishes them forcefully, locks them away in the dark little hole where in his recently rebuilt mind-palace, his self-doubts and undesirable character traits are imprisoned.
He squints, watching as his friend continues to try and move. “I know you hate hospital, Sherlock.” He says gently after a moment, “But I’m not sure you’re fit enough to leave yet.”
The ringing is starting to fade. The sound of her heartbeat thunders viciously in her ears. Her vision sharpens unexpectedly as shock kicks in, suddenly making it very difficult to breathe. She tries feebly to push up onto her elbows. A woman with a red coat is holding her arm.
Deciding it is best to leave him be, John pushes up from the bed and puts his boxers on, before wandering through to the kitchen; trying to wipe the sleepy dust from corners of his eyes. It’s been a long time since either of them ate anything and his stomach is rumbling to prove it. Tea and toast, he thinks, that will do nicely.
It all starts with a laugh, a silent cackle that gradually gets louder and louder until suddenly it’s so deafening that it's threatening to burst his eardrums.
“Don't play the innocent with me, boy. I think you know exactly what I am talking about.” The man straightens up and squares his shoulders. “Intimate relationships of any kind between soldiers are prohibited, especially what has been reported in your case.” He frowns, his face curling up in repulsion. “It’s…
John takes a shallow breath and rubs at his temples. He stutters, trying to speak before deciding against it. It takes him a whole minute to form an answer. “A bit,” He mutters eventually. “Yes.”
“Ok.” Claire tucks a section of hair behind her ear and gathers up her papers on the desk. “And what I understand from the notes the hospital transferred me is that this time was very serious.”
People are still saying things, still putting their hands gently on her shoulders. Trying to sit her down. It creates a constant blur of background noise. Their words are starting to jumble together into one big mess in her mind.
John closes his eyes. After a moment he nods and takes a deep breath. “Okay. I know that now. I get it. But why didn't you tell me about…
John only catches small glimpses of everything as he whizzes past it. Because it’s all moving so quickly, and with such
He’s buying flowers, for the first time, and they’re not just any old flowers for a relative or some experiment. They’re flowers for John.
The man flinches, startled, and this time Sherlock looks up to catch his reaction. He stares him directly in the eye, his own blue eyes shining in the light.
John breathed a sigh of relief, content he had managed to say the entire thing without stuttering and amazed that he’d actually managed to remember it.
Mary glides down the long pale corridors, through the hall, past the multiple smart white doors. She smiles coyly to herself, her blonde hair bobbing in time with her steps, her black jacket trailing out behind her. Flowing with her momentum.
There was a pause, and John suddenly became very aware of the awkward silence that was falling over them.
was about to die. "Shouldn't we...err...you know," He looked down at John's hand which was resting freely at his side.
Her eyes settle on Sherlock, who’s leaning weakly against the wall by the flat door. His eyes are puffy, his pupils spaced out.
“How sweet.” Mycroft crosses his legs to show he has no intention of going anywhere. “However, it is imperative that we discuss what is now the most important matter, your treatment.”
"What about that one there?" Sherlock asked, pointing in the direction of a restaurant at the top of the street.
, not really. Here he's surrounded by people dealing with real lives. Real everyday emergencies, not the kind of bizarre undercover work he's does.
John’s voice grows deeper, darker, like a spark running through gunpowder. His expression reminds her vaguely of thunder.
Yes,” Mycroft responds gravely, his pupils seeming to grow dark from the other side of the room. “That’s why I’m going now. Because you two have a
His words are cut off as the man pulls a small object from his pocket. Sherlock just manages to see that it's a knife, small with a curved handle, the silver blade gleaming as it's brought into the light, towards his face. The other man brings the whip down hard on his back.
Hello, so here's the next chapter as promised. It's only been like four ish days, I'm getting better at this posting on time thing, aren't I? Enjoy!
He takes another heavy breath and wipes his eyes before turning back to the crowd. He can’t give up, not yet. He's just got to get through this day. He's
Sherlock opens his eyes. “Haven't I…how amusing..." The nurse is still moving towards him, Sherlock's whole body suddenly seizes with panic. "Wait no!”
“Yes,” Sherlock opens his eyes and forces himself to take another shaky step forward. Everything is spinning. “I’ll be fine, there’s only a few more…”
John gave him a look that most men would probably be frightened of. “He’s five years old Sherlock! Five-year-olds shouldn’t be running around B&Q on their own. There are drills and stuff-”
She drifts around another corner, past the reception of A&E. There's doctors in long white coats, staff with clipboards.
The man with the beard lurches forward and knees Sherlock in the chest, forcing the detective to whip his head backwards out of the way. His long matted black hair falls from his face.
"Right well, I'll err see you next lesson." He stood up and smiled at Sherlock, his polite teacher smile, nothing more.
“Thank you.” Sherlock smiles and takes the plate. He eats in silence as John searches the room for his socks and puts them on.
“But it just feels like I’ve known you forever, and so I thought we could - you know, but it doesn’t matter.”
Sherlock kicked him under the table, punishing him for speaking but John hardly noticed, he was stuck in his own head.
“Don’t try and guess just open it!” John huffed, interrupting Sherlock mid-deduction, he had a habit of doing that.
Sherlock shakes and trembles, and has to bite down hard on the corners of his mouth to stop himself from calling out. The metallic taste of blood floods his taste buds. He feels like he’s drowning in it.
The first thing she spots is a slightly crinkled piece of yellowing paper covered in scrawly black writing. Underneath is a small collection of photo albums along with some notebooks and newspaper clippings. She decides to start with the note first.
“I actually…” He narrows his eyebrows. John notices his fingers are trembling, ever so slightly. “Well, I wanted to ask…”
“Um yes?” John replied, annoyed to be interrupted. The students were supposed to be taking notes, not shouting to him.
“Of course,” Mrs Hudson nods, “I’ll get a pot.” She takes one last fleeting look at Sherlock before moving towards the stairs. “Oh, and John?”
“Uh, god-” Sherlock doesn’t need to be told twice, and with that he lets go, shuddering as the feeling overtakes him, knocking him sideways. They both tense, the release draining whatever energy they had left.
John slides the key in the lock and pushes the door to the flat open. He says nothing except retake his position under Sherlock’s shoulder and start to help him inside, simply fixing Mrs Hudson with a look as he goes.
Sherlock smirks. "You can do this John, honestly." He leans forward and puts his mouth to John's ear, deliberately dropping his voice an octave. "You remember what I taught you…just follow me."
John shivered as tingling arousal started to overtake his body. He loved it when Sherlock was like this.
"Oh," John smiled gently. "Yeah, it was that's great...but um…” He glanced around one last time to make sure he wasn’t wrong, a very nervous feeling starting to clutch at his chest. “Aren’t you missing something?”
Confusion flickers briefly across Mary's face, and then determination. “We both still love her, don't we? We’ll both still see her and look after her. That's all a child needs.”
“For…everything. I know I have never been the best with…” He has physically to force the word from his mouth. “Emotions...and such but, I’ve been sat out there for an insufferable amount of time and I've realised I’ve not been there for you, not really. Not in the way you needed. You’re clearly in a bad place and you have been for months and I’ve...I’ve let you down.”
“No shh, shh, I know.” Mary holds out her arms and suddenly they’re around John’s shoulders, holding him, squeezing him, her sweet perfume flooding his senses. He closes his eyes and lets her take the majority of his weight. Everything disappears as he buries his head in her chest and
His whole life he's suffered a constant background noise, a glaring buzz that’s impossible to switch off, not even for a moment.
"Quite. Anyway Mrs Hudson, you just came up here because you wanted...tea, wasn't it?" Sherlock blurted quickly, anxious to get rid of Mrs Hudson as the risk of her spoiling the surprise was much higher than he felt comfortable with.
“Yeah,” John wipes his eyes and sniffs awkwardly, trying to pull himself from his trance and rid himself of the guilt that is sinking heavily through his chest, plaguing him all over. He looks to Sherlock. “I'll see that he’s alright and then…” He frowns, unable to finish the sentence.
She wipes away a tear that has slipped down her cheek. Oh, how she misses them and the exciting world they belonged too. But how happy they all were, and how grateful she is they were her parents and she got to be a part of their lives.
John pretends to be reading a newspaper and Mycroft pretends to be on his phone while the doctor, Mark, tells a very bored Sherlock Holmes how to take Methadone.
John is still staring into Sherlock’s eyes, lost, when he realises the detective is slowly lifting his hand into the space between them, his palm trembling, hesitating in mid-air. John finds himself holding his breath and-
John sits in the corner of the ambulance with his knees squashed against the wall and fiddles anxiously with his thumbs. He still feels short of breath. The experience is all too familiar - it’s not for the first time he’s had to sit in the back of an ambulance and rush with Sherlock to hospital, completely out of his mind with worry.
Sherlock let out a small sigh, relieved that it was only John touching him and soothed by the amiable resonance of the older man’s voice.
The sound of Sherlock’s shallow breathing is all that fills the room, the air seeming to scratch sharply along his throat as it leaves his chest; rasping against his lungs. Each breath he takes becomes a little more desperate, more fragile.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he was all over John in an instant, kissing him with the most imperative haste and pulling desperately at his hair and clothes.
In the end, it takes a lot of coaxing, a lot of waiting and encouragements and questions to check that everything’s okay. It takes cooperation, slow kisses and soft moans, and then, eventually, it starts to feel good.
John purses his lips. “Yes but that’s Morphine, Sherlock. That will help with the - woah steady!” He rushes to the other man’s side as Sherlock unexpectedly tries to swing his legs from the bed and start walking, his attempt to be composed failing. He wobbles all over the place. Grasps weakly at the sheets.
The room was placidly dim, the afternoon sunlight streaming through the bay windows of the study room, the light tinting the students faces with a lucent shade of apricot orange as they filed out, carrying the hustling noise and playful atmosphere with them.
“So he was recovered in Croydon at roughly 3 am, picked up by an ambulance and taken to the nearest hospital, but at 5.30 this morning, when he had only been there for a few hours, he… got up and discharged himself?”
Moriarty himself is fading into the shadows, arms spread wide; his whole body vanishing slowly except for his eyes which gleam a dark red. His lips twist up into a crooked smile.
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak but then closes it again. He wriggles uncomfortably. Remains silent for a long moment. He can’t look her in the eye.
“Shh, no, no.” He whispered gently, using his grip around John’s back to trap him and keep him still. “I’m joking, I’m joking. Of course I didn’t forget, and...” His voice turned low and affectionate. “
The man pushed his glasses up his nose and began noting something down. John clicked onto the next slide.
“Sherlock!” John gasped with pleasure as Sherlock pressed down on top of him, grabbing his wrists and pinning him to floor, smothering him in a delightful heat.
He leans over slightly to get a better look at Sherlock’s face, but the detective seems to be fast asleep. He breathes softly, his hair covering his eyes.
“Oh, let's not waste time!” Sherlock exclaims, trying to pull both he and John forward. “I’ve already told you both I’m
I tell you? What would have been the point? I’d already caused you enough grief, John. I realised that as soon as I came back - how badly I’d miscalculated everything. The scale of damage I’d done. And after everything, I survived. That was it. As soon as I saw you I just wanted to forget about it. I wanted to pretend it never happened.”
“Then you know the drill.” Mark puts his jacket on the back of the desk chair and pushes his glasses further up his nose before he continues. Sherlock sits opposite him.
“You don’t have to.” Mycroft says, quieting his voice and trying to sound reassuring.“I’ve already been to the doctors and I’ve got some Methadone, the strongest available. I’ll have it collected every day and delivered here. All you need to do is promise me you’ll take it.”
for, and if that means spending years dismantling Moriarty’s network so they can live in peace, so be it.
“Mr Holmes, hello again.” Her voice is soft, her lips more pursed than usual. Mycroft senses she’s already read the files.
“Sorry.” Sherlock whispered, looking lost and then faintly concerned, as if he’d previously been in a daze and he’d only just remembered himself.
(Cold little heart - Michael Kiwanuka - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FngDSOuCNAA - https://open.spotify.com/track/5MqtUWIKlww4ZMJartTD3q)
Sherlock blinks, and his fingers twitch against his will as the coal black darkness of Moriarty’s eyes flashes before him. He sees the unnatural whiteness of Jim's teeth. The blood…
While John was flying high in his own thoughts, Sherlock had moved down John's neck and was now suckling along his collarbone, nipping occasionally to draw a higher pitched moan from John when he felt like it.
Thankfully after a couple of seconds the heads turned, the man sat back and John blew a small sigh of relief.
John licked his lips, unsure if this was some kind of dirty innuendo or if Sherlock genuinely did have notes he wanted help with. “I’m…happy to do that. In fact it would be my pleasure.” He whispered in a slow, low voice. Amazed at his sudden ability to stay calm and talk so smoothly. This wasn’t a normal occurrence. There was something here…some kind of electricity, some kind of chemistry between them that set a spark of tenacity alight inside of him. He looked back up to Sherlock’s eyes. His pupils were dark and blown back wide, and John imagined his were the same.
