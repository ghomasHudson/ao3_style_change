“Jack negotiated my release from The Empty.  Actually, He threatened it with total annihilation, and it wisely agreed to let me go and never come after me again.  Before He brought me here, He explained all that has happened since The Empty took me, and said He thought I would have a better chance of reaching Dean than He would.  Jack was a wonderful son to me, and He is an excellent Father.”  Castiel’s glance fell to the mattress, to the corpse-like body resting there.  “Oh, Dean, Dean,” he sighed.  “What have you done?  This isn’t what I wanted for you.  I didn’t sacrifice myself for this.”
“I’ve heard Cape Cod is lovely this time of the year, now that the tourists have gone.”
“Oh, you’ll do just fine.”
Sam’s eyes burned and his hands shook from exhaustion. He finally gave in and allowed himself an hour or two of sleep at a rest stop just outside of Syracuse.  It was that, or crash the car.  And he knew Dean would never forgive him if any harm came to Baby.  Assuming Dean was still alive to care.
“Jack.  He answered my prayer.”
And that is when he suddenly remembered what Castiel had said about the first time he escaped from here:  ‘I annoyed an ancient cosmic being, until he evicted me from The Empty’.
“I love you,” Castiel whispered, breaking the comfortable silence that had fallen between them, and Dean felt as if his heart would burst from sheer happiness.  ‘I love you,”  Castiel repeated, leaning in for another kiss, and another, and another – hungry, even greedy for more.  Because he would never tire of this, would never cease to be amazed that something he had believed impossible, had suddenly come true.
“Okay, one last time,”  he said, finally returning to the table, and casting an anxious glance at the sputtering contents of the bowl.  The flame was obviously struggling.  There was little time to spare before it died.  Sam uttered the incantation and held his breath as the remnants of the potion attempted to work their magic.  The fire crept more slowly than it had the previous two times, but the spell held, and the paper eventually burned.
All the while he sang, he held fast to Castiel’s hand.  It warmed in his grip:  felt less corpse-like and more like they were actually holding hands.  This prompted an embarrassing round of love ballads, but no one but Dean and The Empty had to know about that.
A quick inspection determined all the mine shafts were tightly sealed, with no trace of recent activity disturbing them.  Sam admitted to feeling more than a bit relieved at this.  He was not eager to go nosing around dark tunnels, especially without backup.
“Nah, I’ll be fine.”
With that goal in mind, Sam turned his attention back to his laptop and typed: Lebanon, KS to Boston MA.
Dean’s fingers traced the contours of the still face, engraving each feature in his memory:  the brow, the nose, the cheeks, the chin, the lips...  Oh, God, those lips!  He’d give anything to once again see them shape his name... and frame the words ‘I love you’.
Sam entered them one by one, fairly certain extreme caution was unnecessary as they too appeared untouched, but remaining vigilant anyway.  As expected, there was nothing to see but dust and abandoned dreams in the first four he checked out.  The closure of the mine had killed the future of this little town.  Many people had moved on.  Those who remained did so out of sheer stubbornness, living on next to nothing.  Sam took this as further evidence that it was not a vampire he was after.  This sad community was a perfect hunting grounds for a djinn.  The promise of better days, if only in a dream, would easily hook willing prey.
“I think I love you,” Dean said.
“Well, you call me that. And sometimes I call you ‘honey’.  But that doesn’t mean I think you came from a beehive.”
“And I’ll die.”
Dean’s face lifted from where it was nestled against the collar of Castiel’s trench coat, and he stared deep into the angel’s eyes.  “He’s right, Cas.  It’s always been you.”  Dean chuckled softly. “And I think you had the right idea too.  It’s easier to say something when you know you won’t be around to answer for it.”
“Promise you what?”
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel said.  “We didn’t expect you until tomorrow.”
Yeah, he wasn’t proud of knowing that one, and would never admit to Sam that he liked it, but it was a damned catchy tune and so he sang it twice.
Dean knew the feeling.
“Do you have any idea how long you’ve been caterwauling?”
” Castiel thundered, not quite in his true voice, but close enough to it that every lightbulb in the room shattered, and a gilt-framed mirror hanging on the wall cracked from side to side.
He had just hit the ‘seventeen bottles of beer’ mark for the hundredth time, when a voice screamed in the darkness: “No more goddamned bottles of beer!”
Sam’s pulse quickened.
“Really, Dean?” he teased, rolling his eyes in mock exasperation. “This is what I have to look forward to from now on?”
“Who else would it be but Sam?”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Sam chanted, attempting to shake the lingering traces of dream root from his mind so he could think more clearly.  He dropped his head in his hands, elbows braced on his knees, unknowingly copying the same defeated position Dean had taken when The Empty claimed Castiel.
“You’ll be one large freckle if you stay there much longer,” an amused voice warned.
had never sounded better.  In fact, it sounded so good, Dean sang it several times.
I should have known then: where one brother goes, the other soon will follow.  But I was in a state of denial. I told myself that we had not yet run out of time, that things would be okay.  And for the brief span of day, it seemed that would be so. When Dean initiated sex for the first time in years, I willingly tumbled into bed, adoring his frail and wrinkled body with hands and lips that had never wearied of him, no matter what form housed his soul.
Undoubtedly, in this life, he had told Castiel that he loved him, and was obviously loved in return.  But being plopped down in the middle of the story had cost Dean too many firsts.  Saying ‘I love you’ for the first time, and seeing joy at this unexpected declaration spread across Castiel’s face.  The first time he held Castiel’s hand, and discovered how well their fingers fit together.  Their first kiss: learning the proper way to tilt his head so their noses didn’t bump; feeling the gasp of surprise Castiel breathed against his cheek; tasting for the first time the lips he had stared at so many times down through the years.  As for the first time they’d made love... His brain short circuited every time the thought crossed his mind.  When had it happened?  How had it happened.  Was it good?  It had to have been good, wonderful, miraculous... and totally scary. But he’d never know.
Ellen kept the drinks coming, a commanding presence behind the bar, though she occasionally turned things over to Ash while she danced with her husband, Bill.  Jack was here, there and everywhere, passing trays of food around and chatting happily with everyone he met.  And Gabriel...
Sam was the first to slip away, peacefully in his bed, as he slept one night.  A smile was on his face when we found him, and an answering smile quivered on Dean’s lips as tears streamed down his cheeks.
“I’m gonna hit the can,” he told Jo, waltzing her over to a wall where Garth stood at the ready.
“I regret having to leave my shackles behind,” Gene grumbled.
Sam closed his eyes and clasped the palms of his hands together, fingertips resting lightly against his chin.  “Jack,” he prayed.  “Jack, if you can hear me, I need you – Dean needs you.  He’s hurt, real bad.  A djinn got him, and I don’t think he’s going to make it. And I... I can’t...”  Sam broke down and cried,  sobs shaking his entire body.
“That you won’t flap up to Heaven and leave me, ever again.”
The hot water felt heavenly as it enveloped them.  They sat quietly side by side for a few minutes, before inevitably drifting together in the tub. Just as inevitably, their lips drifted together too.  They shared tender, gentle kisses at first, but slippery hands caressing naked skin soon gave rise to an urgency that could not be denied.
But it also wasn’t enough.
“I’m not – I’m not complaining now.”
“I’m not a people person,” Cas stated.
His curiosity and enthusiasm for this entire endeavor started to overtake his paranoia.
Gabriel managed to dodge the punch through sheer instinct. “What the heck?!”
He raised an eyebrow at her. “Your second forms? I thought those didn’t manifest until later, closer to the 99 soul threshold.”
“Oh, fuck yeah, Cas,” Dean breathed. Dean closed his eyes and tilted his head away, giving Cas all the room to work. He squirmed at how fucking good it felt, those teeth pressing hard enough to bruise but not break the skin.
“Really? Cas, you’re awesome!” Dean said cheerfully. Just as promised, there was a pan full of scrambled eggs and cheese waiting for him. After filling a plate, Dean pulled up a chair next to his partner and dug into breakfast with much gusto.
“Alright, alright, knock yourself out.” Dean walked over to his partner and handed the bowl to him. “Bon appetit Cas.”
Meg groaned. “Why? It’s all we’ve been doing for two weeks! We’re barely sleeping anymore, Sam! Geez, would it kill us to have a day off?”
Castiel mulled that over. “You ate the bite of pie and haven’t spoken to me since. I thought your mother had lied to me, and that the pie was so bad it struck you mute.”
….Dean thought to himself.  Out loud, though, he whistled. “The bookworm gets two hot girls?! What the hell?”
Eventually, they broke apart, each seeing how dazed they’d made each other. Cas's lips were puffy and his hair was even more of a mess. Dean was sure he could feel some hickies blooming along his well-nibbled jawline.
In a bizarre turn of events, Cas was blinking slowly, ready to keel over. “Cas, you okay? Did I break you?”
“Carlos! We need your help,” Gabby said. She voice had a pleading tone, like she was vaguely worried he would turn them away.
Dean rolled his eyes in exasperation. He raced towards their room, planning to at least change his shirt if nothing else. “What happened to yours, Mr. ‘I’m always up before the crack of dawn thanks to my internal alarm clock’?”
“Sam?” Dean asked. “You alright man?”
“No, Raphael is an Archangel and is the guardian to the prophets,” Cas explained.
“An excellent plan. And how was Cecil?” Death asked.
The ex-angel studied Dean, now. “You're not being belligerent, are you?”
An invisible hand grabbed Dean’s shirt; he was dragged through the entirety of the bar until he slammed into a wall. Everything went a little hazy around the edges, but the few demons left were now between him and his allies.
“We’ve gotta go find them!” Sam said, about to jump up, and the others nodded. Cas transformed into his Angel Blade form and Gabriel returned to his water pistol shape, Kali looking nonplussed and barely concerned with their current predicament.
“No!” Anna screamed, reaching for the door. “No, no, not my church….”
Dean knew his face was flushed but before he could say anything, Pamela looked between the two angels. "You two need to talk. You might find you’re on more of the same page than you realize.”
“I know, I’m sorry. I’m just...I’m so tired of being the family freak, Dean. The family fuck-up,” Sam said bitterly.
“Sounds like you’d have experience with it,” she said.
“Hello?” Gabriel circled his face. “Trickster? That’s all I do!”
Cas peered down between them before he pointed out, “You are, first and foremost, one of my Father’s masterpieces, Dean. I simply rebuilt you.”
“Next time make a C.”
Cas peered down at himself, brows drawn together in evident confusion.
“Dad, how did you…?”
“You’re dismissed, kids. Next time, tell someone before you decided to go gallivanting into the night, okay?” Lord Death said, and everyone nodded, leaving the reaper and the weapon alone in Death’s office.
With his limbs feeling like lead weights, the idea of crawling his ass upstairs onto to listen to Sam sawing logs was the anthesis of restful. The afternoon sun glinted off the chrome mirror of the Impala parked a few steps away; he wasn’t strong enough to ignore that siren’s call.
“We’re finally going on our first hunt!” Ruby said, unable to keep it to herself any longer.
Dean ran a hand over his mouth. “I appreciate the gesture, Cas.”
He flipped to the next page, a barebones sketch of the house’s layout, and pointed to several Xs he’d drawn. “The three of you working together should paint them on this door, this wall, this wall, and this entryway. You’ll get the most--” Castiel curled his fingers around the words-- “‘bang for your buck,’ this way.”
Finally, Cas seemed to have broken from his shocked silence. He let out a pleased hiss before he groaned into Dean’s closest ear. The sound made Dean’s dick become rock hard, but he ignored it. Cas tried to push the hem of Dean’s shirt up his chest, tried to touch the smooth skin there.
“I think this was a message. A show of power,” Kali said. “They knew that, one way or another, the DWMA would step in and stop the carnage. But, it was the
funny.”
Castiel cast a quick glance at Dean. His meister had that determined stride and that look of intensity that could’ve easily scared anyone who didn’t know him. Dean was only 16, yet he already had the look of a trained killer in his emerald eyes—it hurt Castiel when he realized his partner probably had that look down before he’d even entered the DWMA.
Somehow, desperate to change her lot in life, Marnie found an actual old magic grimoire donated to a thrift store. She’d stolen the book and discovered a ritual to raise something akin to an eldritch demi-god. The deaths had been fulfilling the ritualistic sacrifices needed to reach the entity, and she had planned to reach out to this being and beg it to give her money and power.
Dean refused to give one more goddamn inch to the man in front of him. “Between you or Sam on demon blood, I’d pick Sam every time. He has more decency in him while high on
“Even if you have fighting experience, Death sent you into the field with no knowledge of basic healing magics? There’s no reason for that sort of recklessness!” Carlos said.
As Cas gathered up the plastic shopping bags from his adventure, Dean checked out the damage to his truck. The navy blue 1969 Ford F-100 pick-up had been a cheap rust-bucket of purchase when Dean found it sitting at the edge of someone’s yard with a ‘FOR SALE’ sign on it.
He waved away his brother’s concern. “Things just got away from me, but I’m fine. Actually, I’m surprised you’re here.”
The flying glass felt like a cyclone of jagged shards; his arms were slashed to bloody bits.  He managed to tuck his head down, face grimacing because his brain felt like it was in a blender on high--
Doing laundry at midnight was not fun but practical. Since his return from Hell, he’d only slept a couple of times. The rest of the time, he was basically plugged into an angel battery. Not for lack of trying--he'd spent entire nights staring at a motel room ceiling. So, he’d gotten into the habit of doing their chores at night: laundry runs, washing the car, going shopping. He hadn’t truly appreciated how many places were open around the clock until now.
They looked up at the sky, which was the same ebony color as last night’s sky, clear without a cloud to dim the starlight. Carlos and Cecil had been kind enough to change Dean’s bandages and buy them each a small pizza for dinner. Both boys inhaled their respective pies (they hadn’t eaten in almost 24 hours thanks to the kishin-egg fight), and profusely thanked the pair.
“Um…I think we should head back to the Academy today,” Sam said, managing to hide his relief.
damned,” Cas corrected. “That’s what we were trying to avoid happening.”
“Hey Baby-Girl!” Dean said with a grin. He heard an adorable huff over the phone, and could imagine his little sister scowling into the phone, curly blonde hair framing her elfin face. “It’s Jo, Dean!” she said, stomping her foot in emphasis.
There was a grassy area behind the gas station that had a few weather-stained picnic tables. In one corner of the parking lot, a small food truck serving barbecue had a line of customers. Dean plopped down at a table and waited for Sam to return with lunches for them. The ability to stretch their legs (especially Sam’s) was unfortunately negated because it was still summer. The air was hot and sticky with humidity, though his hangover shades helped with the brightness.
?” Bobby hissed angrily.
“Funny, I’d have figured you’d at least invite Dean over, too. He’s mentioned his appreciation for terrible horror films many times.”
“No wonder you two get…*yawn* along,” Sam said, stifling another yawn.
“You two, Bobby. Glad to have the excuse to get out into the sunshine. Ellen! It’s been too long. The bar misses you, you know.”
“The majority of the song is about him realizing his attraction to men and how he’s willing to embrace something considered taboo in order to become his truest self.”
As Metallica wrapped up, Judas Priest’s song
“I’m happy to hear that,” Cas said in genuine relief. He watched while Dean headed deeper into the garage before he took up residence sitting on the Impala’s hood, arms still crossed.
“Help me up, Sasquatch,” Gabriel ordered. Sam obliged and pulled the smaller boy up onto the couch but Gabriel almost fell into Sam’s lap. The taller boy blushed as Gabriel scrambled back onto his side of the couch, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
"I don't think so. I think my powers are growing stronger the longer we’re out of Hell. But we are a unique amalgamation; everything is a learning curve."
“Hey, that’s my prerogative as your cousin,” Dean said with a playful shove. “Nicknames come with the turf,
All eyes looked at Cas. The weapon squirmed uncomfortably under their gaze. “I’m not a monk,” he simply stated.
“See the resemblance? And you have to give them credit for the puns!”
“Trying to be quiet,” Dean said in defeat.
Unfortunately, Dean was left feeling unanchored more than ever. Yeah, he hadn’t thought about sex much, been trying hard not to. Cas in his head had been the most convenient reason he wasn’t bar-hopping, but it wasn’t the only one. He hadn't wanted to admit to himself that the idea of a stranger touching him... made him want to curl up in a little ball and disappear.
Carolized…
Dean said, patting the side of his face and grinning at him.
Cas opened his mouth but then closed it. “Well, I think it might be easier if you let me ‘drive,’ first?” When Dean’s face fell, Cas quickly clarified, "Just enough for you to get a sense of what it feels like so you can copy it?”
“I remember that,” Dean said suddenly. “Yeah, I remember that…thing. It was…god, it was like a blood-splattered-clown looking
“And that’s where my blade would go, if you were a kishin-egg,” Ruby said triumphantly.
“And scratchers! Can’t forget those,” Dean added.
“It’s a terrible clutter back there,” Bella said with a tiny scowl causing wrinkles to appear around her eyes.
“No, if this was
Dean threw his hands up. “Geez, Cas, is this how you repay the guy that made sure you didn’t pass out in class?”
“I’m not, moron. The Devil is a fallen archangel, I’m the true demonic rags-to-riches story. You should hear the story of how I became a demon. Very tragic.”
When she started to lower her arms, Cas stepped forward, blade ready. "I'm not going to hurt anyone. I don't even have my grace to make my blade--"
“You could just
“No, you misunderstand me. I am glad because there is nowhere I could have gone, and no one compatible with me. I would have been difficult, if not impossible, to find a partner.”
Surprising both of them, Cas didn’t budge. Instead, he pointedly watched the rocky outcroppings and forests they passed.
“Honestly, I think those powers are innately your own. The demon blood was simply an amplifier.”
Dean rubbed a hand over his face angrily and swore under his breath.
“Uh...hadn’t seen you in a while. I just wanted to make sure you didn’t curl up and die in my brain somewhere,” Dean said with an awkward chuckle.
“Yeah…fine…” Gabriel said, though it was obvious he was looking rather sick.
Dean smacked his forehead. “Oh, yeah, totally. Cas, do you remember that number?”
“Will you, now?” Crowley asked, eyebrows high. “Why would you want to do that…?”
Castiel waved at the apparition. “Hello, Mr. McDaniel’s!” he said. The shape disappeared, and Dean turned to see Castiel grinning again.
“What rejection? There’s nothing between me and Cas to reject,” Dean countered. He saw the light bulb come on in Gabriel’s eyes. His heart stopped beating for a second.
When Cas opened his mouth with a retort, Pamela tapped her head. "Psychic, remember?"
Sam squeaked, legitimately squeaked in horror, as the monster took a few menacing steps towards them. The things head actually spun around 180 degrees, and Sam almost passed out.
When he grabbed the duffel bag from the trunk with their clothes and detergent, Cas was standing next to him. “You don’t have to hang around,” Dean said.
Dean yawned again, unable to hide it from his Dad’s sharp eyes.
It was going to be a long drive, for every mile that went by everyone became more nervous, dreading seeing the highway sign that pointed towards the town. What would they find in Night Vale? Would they even be needed? What if Death’s Meisters were already there?
Gabriel blinked at his partner a couple times, completely floored by her. “How about Cs? Those are average, right?” He asked.
He obediently followed Dean out the door as they ran towards their class, jogging and eating the Pop-Tarts along the way. They got the classroom just in time. As the bell struck 9:00 A.M., Dean looked to see all of his friends were also in the classroom. Kali looked tired but determined; Gabriel seemed more bored than anything. Bookworm was looking carefully contemplative, and both the girls looked annoyed.
Warily, Dean glanced over his knees to Cas, who was slowly moving his hand up and down.
"That was weird,” Dean hissed and ducked down behind a low wall. Sam and Kali nodded in agreement.
Sam wasn’t worried about studying for the big test in less than 6 hours. He knew the information backwards and forwards. This book was too intriguing for him to pause in his reading just to study.
“You were having a nightmare,” Castiel explained quietly, his right hand lifted up as if to gently touch where the handprint lay, under Dean’s hand. “I was trying to remind you that you weren’t trapped in Hell anymore.”
“That dick was about to rip your head off,” Dean said in a heated whisper, eyes narrowed in pained irritation that Sam wasn’t acting very grateful. “You’re welcome, asshole.”
There was sweat on her forehead as she made a path for Sam to tread. “I need you to go to that door and go through it.”
on a date…right?” His cheeks flushed beautifully.
“You don’t just take it upon yourself to attack a kishin-egg while in someone else’s
“I like to live on the edge,” Dean shot back, and poked him again. “Look here, Castiel Novak,” he said, getting the weapon’s full attention.
“Yeah, well you know what? Not today.” With the cryptic message, Dean put his plate on the table and stomped off into the bedroom.
Castiel berated him for his bad decisions. Dean deflected because he knew, okay, Cas? He knew he’d fucked up the hunt. Knew that if Cas hadn’t been there, he’d be dead.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Been laying low, actually.”. He carefully cut up his pancakes, but he seemed to be pushing them around the plate more than eating them. “After Lilith killed you, she tried to kill me. I was immune.”
“Finally, something to do!” Sam said. “We’ll be there soon.”
Sam bit his lip, trying to stay calm but close to tears. Dean could tell from how his shoulders bunched up and how his face scrunched to keep it together. He spoke hesitantly. “Azazel’s Special Children were all fed some of his blood when we were babies. I found out at Cold Oak. And no, I don’t know why he did it.”
“You shot
Sam shrugged. “Yeah. It’s still weird but I like being able to talk to Cas normally.”
Sam, noticing her movements, shucked his jacket and handed it over the seat so she could use it as a blanket. He watched the conversation with his brow furrowed in confusion, which killed Dean a little inside because that movie was a classic. How did his baby brother get away without having seen it?
Dean rolled his eyes but then closed them. “Whatever. I just want to see if I can get a few hours. Then I’ll be good to go.” He cracked open an eye and saw Castiel was just staring, unblinking, at him. He determinedly buried his face in the leather seat so he couldn’t witness Castiel being a creeper.
“Um, apparently I’m suffering from sort of amnesia and they’re bringing a psychic out to try and fix me. And last night Dean, Cas, and I had to kill the Anti-Claus to save Dean’s baby sister.”
“If any harm befalls Sam Winchester, you’ll not live long enough to regret it,” Cas growled, hands clenched into fists at his sides. Dean relayed the message with as much fury he could manage.
His eyes seemed stuck on a faraway place as his mind processed the truth she spoke. Castiel could not help himself but wonder why he felt guilty for Dean getting hurt. He was a weapon, it was his job to kill the monster, and it was Dean’s job to protect himself during the fight. Maybe it was the same reason that was feeding his jealousy at all the attention Dean was suddenly finding himself in the middle of. Castiel was afraid of being alone.
“And if I told you to go back to Hell and leave me alone?”
Indignation shifted to something like relief, and Cas nodded; his wings folded into themselves and disappeared. He stood a little taller and fixed his silent gaze on his older brother.
“Guess we’ll have to find out for ourselves what she’s up to, won’t we?”
“What the hell!” Sam yelped.
“She’s gonna be right on our asses,” Bobby said before flinging the door open and gesturing angrily at the black man that climbed out of the truck’s cab. “Rufus! Act drunk!”
Dean’s eyes opened wide. “Demons. As in
First of all, I'm sorry this fic has been gathering dust for so many years. I am updating this to let fans of these series know my future thoughts for it, and to get opinions.
“That’s a lot of kishin-eggs…” Gabriel said.
Bobby lifted his cap to scratch his head. “There’s just…something buggin’ me about your whole ‘I don’t remember nothin’ story that I can’t shake.”
Mid-Term Madness ensues!
Dean rolled his eyes but shook out his arms and bounced on his feet like a boxer. His easy movements contrasted to Cas’s contemplative stillness as they sized each other up.
“Fuck you,” Dean groaned, both exasperated and relieved it was just Sam.
Dean’s opinion of watching a Godzilla movie was drowned out in a chorus of groans from the girls, though Sam and Gabriel both looked interested, as Castiel went into the living room to find the radio.
The tufts of grass growing through the cracks in the asphalt were suddenly more interesting than Dean’s face. “...I’m making up as we go,” Castiel confessed to a dandelion.
Part of his brain helpfully yelled at the other half. But, this wasn’t just a guy from a bar he wanted to try things with. This wasn’t a guy; this was
With his hands quickly roaming over Cas’s chest, he pulled Cas to him and pushed away his open shirt so he could suck on and mark up all the skin. Cas had a hand on Dean’s waist and the other bracing on his shoulder. “Dean,” he swallowed. “There’s a lot of sensations,” he reported, his eyes screwed up tight.
“There’s been nothing to report,” Castiel said.
Dean hated being the butt of any jokes, but he put on a brave face so they wouldn’t think he couldn’t take a little teasing.
“--I’m telling you, Cas, I was this close to kicking him were the sun don’t shine,” Meg growled. “Hello, earth to Cas, you there?”
“Thank God you’re alright,” Ellen said into her daughter’s shoulder, shaking in relief.
Meg shook her head, then gave his a lop-sided grin. “You’re something else, Castiel. Most people would have run away or called the FBI if I told them that. You just gave me a pass.”
from Lynyrd Skynyrd--the song explained Dean well, and Castiel seemed to have caught onto that. He studied Dean in a slightly different light now. He employed that famous owlish head tilt that Sam refused to find cute for a being older than the planet.
Surprisingly, Dean shook his head. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. People are disappearing left and right in this town—there’s a good possibility someone’s gonna disappear tonight too, and if we’re back at the DWMA we might not be able to save them.”
Pamela held out her palm, and Anna grabbed hold of it. She seemed to shrink in herself when everyone's eyes were on her.
Dean wanted to Worship Cas.
“So, boy, how goes the Academy?” Bobby asked loudly.
Sam glanced around, and Crowley chuckled. “Oh, I promise, Growly’s around. Whether or not you’ll see him before he rips your throat out remains to be seen. Depends on why exactly I’m here.”
“Holy crap, guys, you
Dean’s eyes almost fell out of his head. "First of all, Dmitri Collins is
Kali chuckled. “I know. Now then, are you going to mope there all night, or are you going to go get changed and we’ll watch some T.V. until Mother and Father come home?”
He must have sensed Dean's temper calming down a little because Cas bravely asked,
“Yeah, and Meg took all the hits,” Sam said, while motioning for Meg to eat it. A little smugly, she grabbed the squishy egg and swallowed it quickly.
“No,” Sam corrected. He ripped the sheet down the middle. “I said they were ‘tear’-able.”
?” she snapped.
Carlos narrowed his eyes at that. “Exactly how long have you two been at the DWMA?” he asked quietly.
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know, he said something like ‘I don’t have any family, it’s impossible,’ blah, blah, blah. But it’s him. Same eyes, same nose, same bitch-face he’d pull when I found him in a particularly good hiding spot. I just couldn’t really put that Sam and this one together until I heard about Uncle John. Who, apparently, was an asshole to Sam?” Dean propped his elbows on the table and held his head in his hands. “I don’t know what’s up anymore.”
“Neither of us is in a position to be picky,” Castiel pointed out, much to Dean’s annoyance.
“And who do you think you are, Junkless?” Dean snapped back.
Cas was clearly taken aback by this pivot in the conversation because he seemed to deflate a little. He tore his eyes away from Dean, the tendon in his neck standing out from clenching his jaw.
Cas snarled.
Dean had to pause. One of his hands unconsciously went to touch the streak of blood from his nose. It was gone; not even a dried trail was left.
“Not only is it incredibly tough to kill, it’s exceptionally cunning. Er, it was,” Death corrected himself. “Since the Krampus is, er, was, only active one week a year and both the locations and victims of its attacks are chosen at random, its proven almost impossible to track over the years, even by skilled Meisters. I don’t know how you got the drop on it, but I don’t really care. The Krampus is gone, for that I applaud you.”
Dean, laughing maniacally, had to duck behind Cas because his younger brother had just flung a heavy book at his forehead.
Cas was working on autopilot as he pulled on one of Dean’s band shirts. Hanging on the back of their bedroom door was his own house robe, the third gift from Dean he’d ever received.
Dean’s lips were a thin, angry line and his eyes were bright with temper. The glare he shot Sam was almost deadly.
So yeah. Dean hated witches, which was why he was currently driving to a suspected witch case with a newly humanized Cas in the passenger seat of the Impala.
Dean had a thought,
At least Owen would be in her arms, alive and safe, at the end of it.
With both brothers staring at him, Cas cleared his throat and ducked his head. “I had to use a little of my grace to help stabilize you,” he admitted. “I guess it’s enough for you to perceive me now.”
“I did. The kishin-egg is dead,” she said with a shrug.
Castiel tilted his head at his partner. “If I hit your head with enough force, I might be able to give you amnesia. Would that be preferable?”
Cas sighed. “Perhaps I can say something to him.”
Dean waved it away. “No chick-flick moments.”
“Dean?” Sam asked, oblivious. “You okay?”
--thank you! This story wouldn't be moving along at the clip it is without their guidance and confidence in the direction I'm taking things. Thank you again! :)
Cas said, and he tilted his head towards the white marble statue of Mary--it was crying bloody tears.
"Come on. You can have your car crisis later," Sam chastised. "We found something."
“What? Oh, that little asshat!” Dean growled. “Come on! You’d think he’d learn that playing tricks on stranger doesn’t end well. Besides, after that whole ‘calligraphy moustache’ I would expect something more original than the shaving cream trick.”
Dean bristled. “It’s a classic. Shut up.” He placed the breakfast on the bedside table and looked over Sam when he didn’t respond. Sam was pale-faced with pronounced circles under his eyes, and his hair was stiff with sweat. His eyes, however, were clear as he focused on the open laptop in front of him.
“Sam hasn’t seen John in a while. You don’t happen to know where he is, do you?” Bobby asked.
“If I were a betting man, I’d think you were talking about an angel. Sounds angelic, anyway.”
He and Dean both turned towards Sam, who didn’t speak immediately as he was chewing on his lip. He tapped his fingers on his bottle for a moment before he drained it.
“Running isn’t going to help you now,” Cas growled, striding up to them and emanating predatory power. He threw out a hand, and the boys flew through the kitchen and crashed into the kitchen cabinets.
, in the middle of
“Not the movie! The girls!” Sam corrected.
“Let’s get the hell out of here and regroup,” Dean said. The grace instead was no longer buzzing angrily but was leaching cold fury. He shivered at the feeling emanating from Cas’s grace.
One, there was the most heavenly smell of cooked fruit in the air that made his mouth water. Two, Castiel was wearing a pink apron several sizes too small and splattered with white specks of flour and dough. Three, Castiel was standing there with a pie sitting on the oven.
"I'm aware," Gabriel said. "But that's boring."
The hunter/meister was fast and before Gabriel knew what had happened, he was on the ground. Dean’s arm was around his neck, putting just enough pressure on his windpipe to make him gasp.
Kali rolled her eyes. “If you must throw a couple Cs in there, fine. The majority of your grades have to be Bs, though. Deal?”
Dean flung himself towards the demons on the far side of the bar. He needed to draw their attention long enough for Cas to get to Sam and Ruby. As demons surrounded Dean, he saw Cas appear behind them, and with a flick of his wrist, the ropes binding them shredded.
Big difference.”
Taking a deep breath, he let out an awkward chuckle. Next, Dean decided to try out his charm. “Well,
“What are you two doing?”
Out of his long-sleeve, the angel blade slid into Dean’s hand. “You asked for it.” He threw the blade, but Cas quickly sidestepped it. However, he hadn’t expected the blade to flip over and come flying back like a boomerang. Cas barely managed to dodge it, and that was the opening Dean wanted. He strode up, summoned the blade back into his hand, and went to stab Cas.
“Dean couldn’t contain his enthusiasm after the announcement,” Castiel said easily around a bite of salad, ignoring the look of betrayal on his partner’s face.
Castiel turned around and motioned towards the dessert. “Your mother wanted to make a pie, since you like them so much.”
Next update should be Oct 25!
Anna took a slight step back. “Dean, shut up! That’s Uriel. He’s an Angel of Death.”
They gawked at each other for a few seconds. Gabe walked up, then looked at Sam and Dean who were staring at each other. “What are they doing?” he asked, standing at the table awkwardly.
Meg stomped down an alleyway a few blocks away and kicked a metal trash can so hard it flew halfway down the alley.
The other patrons saw him sneaking back to the jukebox--he'd pay for one song, then go back and set up a list for three. He'd randomize the songs and his movements so if Dean or Cas looked over he was never caught. The few bikers in the bar glared at him every time for his song choices, but his size and the determination on his face made them just put up with his nonsense.
He opened a beer and had a half-opened beef jerky stick hanging from his mouth while he tried to open the plastic packaging of his new purchase. Frustrated, he was about to rip it apart with his teeth when Castiel held out his hand. Dean handed the package over, and Castiel ripped the plastic shell apart like a banana peel. He picked up the small plastic item inside. “What’s this?”
“Oh?”
Ruby glared at him, but answered it with a curt. “What do you want, Sis?”
The alarm clock only rang once before he smacked it gracefully despite still being half-asleep, silencing it. He rolled onto his back and blinked several times, bringing his tiny and bare room into focus in the early morning. It was just past dawn, but despite being a teenager he liked the morning hours, alone and undisturbed.
“Deal,” Bella said. “Just…please, for the love of God don’t touch anything!”
“Certainly not full price,” Kali said, sounding incensed.
He blinked; he had to pay attention. Because Jack was explaining that he was...the new Chuck?
Dean found himself having a tough time remembering why he was grumpy when Castiel came back out in
“Sorry, force of habit. Um, well, me and Ruby’s dad is…well, let’s just say he’s the leader of one of the most notorious biker gangs in California.”
The former angel let out a content sigh. “He was right, you know.”
Nextus chuckled. “None at all. I may be a demon, but I’m a demon of my word. Tell me your next vessel. I’ll even fetch ‘em myself.”
“Do you think you could drop by, take a look even?”
“Until I get my hands on him,” Bobby growled.
“Show that chucklehead who’s boss!”
“As long as things go bump in the night, we’ll need hunters. We’ll need meisters and weapons.” He watched the teenagers covered in snow and laughing. “We’ll need heroes, El.”
Crowley let out a bark of amused laughter. “You’ve got a bigger pair than Growly does! So, that’s your brilliant plan: demon blood for kishin-egg locations?”
, the darker part of his mind whispered, drowning out the parts that made him laugh, made him smile, made him easy-going and friendly.
After an awkward moment, Gabriel turned to face Kali, but she refused to turn towards him. Gabriel rolled his eyes at this. “Look Kali, I’m sorry. I suppose I shouldn’t have pranked you. I just meant it in good fun. Again, I’m sorry.”
Dean ran.
Bobby stepped out on the porch and impatiently waved at the parked car, prompting Dean to wake the others. The brothers grabbed their duffle from the trunk of the Impala and trudged up the steps to Bobby’s house (Sam yawning loudly and bitching about his need for coffee). Anna's forest-green eyes scanned around the junkyard. When she wrinkled her nose in disgust, Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah, hope you’re up to date on your shots. If you get a cut, we’ll have to patch you up with vodka and dental floss.”
Dean slumped down at one end while Cas grabbed him a beer. He passed it to Dean before he sat next to him, perched on the edge of the cushion. Cas’s hands were clasped in his lap and he seemed to ponder how to start.
Dean’s pursed his lips and said with deadly calm, “Oh, so now I’m stupid."
your brother's safety is my top priority.” He paused for a few seconds, then added in a conspiratorial whisper, “It's just Cas.”
The Texas accent suddenly reminded Dean of his father, which made him realize that this was a fucking stupid idea. What if he and Castiel’s zealotry had gotten them, their friends killed? What if he never saw his family again? He felt bile rise up his throat, but managed to not vomit everywhere.
“Too far away,” Ruby mumbled. “Anyways, Sam, don’t—*yawn*—freak out anymore. You…did…okay for...a nerd…zzzzzzz.” He looked over to see she was fast asleep.
Cas’s eyes darkened and he stomped off to the locker room, leaving Dean bewildered and alone. “You’re welcome, asshat!” he yelled but his partner was already gone.
Dean found himself standing next to Cas and tried not to stare, but it was so hard not to. Cas was watching the psychic, both intrigued and wary, and didn’t notice his Meister’s eyes on him. The kid was a little taller than when they’d met at the beginning of the year, and he still had that crazy hair and eyes that always looked wise beyond his years.
“You’d be surprised how much damage a broken nail could do to an unprotected eyeball,” Ruby said nonchalantly, looking at her own. Everyone paused to stare at her, and she munched on a potato chip innocently as she sat on the edge of the counter. The black witch’s hat on her head seemed to be defying gravity as it sat lopsided on her head, a tiny bell on the end of it jingling every time she moved.
Parked in a grassy field outside of Wellington, they sat on the hood of the Impala and split a 6-pack of the cheapest beer they could find and an equally cheap take-out pizza. Their feast represented the last of the cash they had in their pockets. There was one last credit card between them, hanging on tenuously, but like all fraudulent cards, it could get shut off at any minute and leave them high and dry. Things had been so busy recently that they’d neglected to fill out more applications. So, things were rough financially for the Winchesters.
“O’Reilly?” Dean cleared his throat, but Cas was lost in thought.
It was close to midnight, so he chucked the keys to his brother. “You know the rules, Sammy. Use protection and put a sock on the doorknob if you have company over. If it's twins, then you gotta share."
for coffee and contemplation.”
Dean leaned up and desperately kissed Cas, their tongues intertwined before he started to fuck his tongue into Cas's mouth, in sync with his hand movements. Cas was almost there, and he could feel it in the air between them. He twisted his hand around the head on the last few strokes when he felt Cas tense. Dean swallowed Cas' howl as he felt the body shudder under him before his hand grew warm and sticky.
This chapter was once again amazingly beta'd by
Crowley scoffed. “The biggest pain-in-the-arse bitch that’s ever been pulled off the rack, that’s who.”
She held up her hand at them, a dangerous smirk on her face, but it suddenly dropped away, replaced with terror. Sam’s eyes (everyone’s eyes) darted up, and hovering over Cecil was….a….
And that realization fractured the illusion.
“Castiel,” the doppelgänger said, and smiled.  “The seraph himself.  Well, this is rather awkward.”
As first kisses went, it was everything Dean had dreamed it could be – even if it wasn’t happening under ideal circumstances.  Unlike the nothingness of The Empty, being back on Earth brought a flood of sensations rushing back.  He was cold, starving and weary.  There was a rock or a piece of driftwood digging into his back... but he wouldn’t have changed a thing.  Candlelit dinners and pretty posies were not his style.  They never had been.  This... this was real.  Castiel was here.  They were alive, uninjured, and together.  And that was more than enough for Dean.
“Dean, we’ll discuss this later.  When we have more time.”
No.  None of the above.  Publishing the juicy details would have increased book sales.  God didn’t care if the whole truth came out.
Dean stood momentarily frozen, staring after him. The prayer he’d sent out with such desperation had been answered. Castiel was back, relatively unscathed, and generously giving Dean not only his forgiveness but, more importantly, an out: no need to apologize in person.
Almost complete.
, he mouthed.
Before he lost –
He closed his eyes, and allowed himself to drift away.
And as colour flooded back into the world he’d chosen, he tumbled into Castiel’s waiting arms.
This was the place.  Sam was certain of it.
Their eyes met in the mirror, and the djinn’s smile widened. Without breaking their eye contact, he rose from his seat at a little table and sauntered up to the bar.  “Whiskey,” he informed the bartender, and inclined his head towards Dean.  “And another of whatever he’s having.”
of a car door unlocking provided an unwelcome answer to that question.
Dean was... a complicated man.  Some might say broken.  But with me he found a way to repair his damaged life.  He loved me with the whole of his generous heart and beautiful soul.  We loved in all the ways two lovers can come together:  physically, mentally, spiritually.  We made love whenever and wherever we could:  sometimes a furtive, hasty coupling; sometimes leisurely hours of exploration and tenderness that brought us both to the brink of madness.
“Because it is.”
“1,653.5 miles,” he read aloud. “Twenty-five hours by car, and Dean already has a four day lead on me.”  He clicked though a couple of screens.  “I could hop on a plane to save on time... but I’d be poorly equipped when I got there, thanks to airport security checks.   Looks like I’ll have to drive it, and hope Dean hasn’t done anything too stupid.”
“I never meant for my love to be a burden.”
“No, I don’t
Sam shook himself free of his reverie and crossed the room to Dean’s bedside table.  Picking up a hairbrush, he collected several strands of hair, yanking them roughly from the bristles.
“Let’s make good use of whatever time remains,” Dean said.
I was the love of Dean’s life, but I was also his dirty little secret.  What was said and done remained solely between us.  I understood his reasons:  he did it to protect me, to protect what we had.  To keep our love safe we had to hide it away, bury it deep so no one could use it against us.  And, yes, this caused me considerable pain, but it was better than not having Dean at all.  That was the condition he imposed, you see.  Love on his terms... or no love at all.
Dean felt his heart pound a little harder in his chest.  It was time.
Sam met the angel’s level stare – the
“I guess this is it, Gene.  Time for me to follow my dream.”  Dean sighed.  “Make it a good one, huh?”
The surroundings were a far cry from the motels the Winchester brothers normally frequented, but when Castiel materialized in the room, he had no interest in the luxurious decor.  His eyes were immediately drawn to the bed, to the two naked bodies writhing in ecstasy there.
“There will be,” Castiel said firmly.  “I’ll see to that.  And you know what you have to do to help me.”  An angel blade slipped magically from his coat sleeve.  He held it out to Dean, hilt first, and the hunter wrapped trembling fingers around it.
“No.  I feel as I have always felt towards you:  I love you, Dean.  But I knew you needed time to digest that unwelcome revelation.  I have been giving you that time.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replied.
“Then it would appear we have reached an impasse.  Goodbye, Dean.  Let me know when you’re ready to be sent back to where you belong.”
“What is it?  What’s wrong?”
This wasn’t the dream he wanted.
The stunned silence that greeted this declaration was deafening. Dean felt his heart catch in his throat as he anxiously awaited a reply. Acceptance or rejection?  He didn’t know which frightened him more. But he’d finally spoken the truth he’d buried for so many years, a truth he’d tried to hide even from himself. And it felt good. It felt right. It felt...
“You mean, it’s been easier on you to avoid me.  I never pictured you as a coward, Cas.  Don’t you want to hear what I didn’t have a chance to say before The Empty took you?”
“We’ll both die.  I do not exist without you.”
He had not expected to wake ever again.  For several minutes he kept his eyes closed, taking in what information he could through his other senses, but there was nothing:  no scent, no sound, no taste.  However, he was certain that someone – something – was nearby. He opened his eyes to darkness, felt the presence shift closer... ever closer...
“We hunt?”
To his immense relief, Castiel didn’t hesitate to hold and kiss him back.
to.  It’s something you should know.” He took a deep, steadying breath.  “I love you, Cas.  I’m so damned in love with you that I can’t live without you.  I’d rather die.”
On Tuesday, the routine was much the same.  Castiel rushed off to Yale, and Dean was left alone in a house that felt like a real home, just not one that belong to him.  He was an outsider here, an imposter, and he soon decided that he had to escape for the day or he’d go mad. A quick computer search revealed that they lived within walking distance of Tony’s Auto Services.  As the smell of oil, gasoline and exhaust fumes enveloped him, Dean felt himself relax for the first time since he had woken up on the beach. He also discovered he really liked his job, and was indeed damned good at it.  It was the one thing that felt right as the week progressed and the weekend drew near.  How their relationship would play out, once they were together with no distractions to keep them apart, frightened Dean more than any monster ever had.
“Your stupid little ploy isn’t going to work.”
“You didn’t embarrass me, Cas.”
“Yeah,” Dean murmured, finally lifting his head and meeting Castiel’s concerned gaze.  “The worst.  I dreamed I lost you.”
“Ah, no!  Hell, no!” Dean cried.  “We drive a fucking Prius?”
“Oh, I don’t know, Cas.  Maybe I thought you’d be
stop!  You win.  I’ll let you go – I’ll send you back.  Just shut up!
“What did Cas say, Dean?  I didn’t catch it.”
“Not to seem ungrateful, but couldn’t he have done a better job of it and healed me completely?”
A dark shadow formed in his peripheral vision, and when he turned his head his vision blurred, then sharpened again to reveal a shabby motel room, a monster bent over a prone figure lying on a stained mattress.
The Empty leaned in close, getting right up in Dean’s face.  “You’re playing with fire, Dean Winchester.  I could squash you like a bug.”
“What?”
“Since I told him that I love him?” Castiel said.
Sam had known things were bad in the years since The Empty had claimed Castiel.  He knew how much Dean had cared for the angel.  How much he missed him.  Sam missed him too.  But this...  this went beyond anything he could have imagined.  This was the product of a man teetering on the edge:   hanging onto the cliff of his sanity with bloodied fingertips, not caring if he fell.
“Disgust, then.”
“Perhaps we should take this discussion elsewhere?” Gene purred.
“Come on, Gabe, never bet against a Winchester!” Dean said with bravado.
“Get down!” he hissed. She did as he told, because the usual glint of humor or mischief in his eyes wasn’t there. He was serious.
Anna paused, put her hands up. “Castiel, a lot has changed since the last time we saw each other.”
“Hang on,” Castiel said, when Dean finally moved from his mouth to his neck. “What was that all about?”
“Yeah, okay, Sammy. Go get some rest. We’ll talk in the morning.”
Dean returned his hug and asked Jack if he could give them a minute once it became clear that Castiel wasn’t going to let go of him any time soon.
He was sure she had been pretty. Like tended to attract like, and under any circumstances, Dean was most definitely the type of guy that could end up with some beautiful girl and start an equally beautiful family.
“No,” Castiel said immediately. Dean looked a little crestfallen, and Castiel hurried to clarify himself, “I mean, I’m not tired of your cooking. We can have dinner and then go wherever you want. I’d like that.” He didn’t want to give up a chance to see the place where Dean made his home. They hadn’t really discussed it, but while the Winchesters had been to his apartment several times at this point, he had no idea where they lived. He was seized with the intense and sudden desire to see and know that particular part of Dean, and because of that he hadn’t been as smooth as he might have liked in his answer.
He sighs and lets it go.
She bumped his shoulder and tucked a few wispy red strands behind her ear, “Seriously, though, you sure you’re okay? You know I’ve got your back. We all do.”
“Fine,” Castiel answered automatically.
“A while back,” Castiel cleared his throat again. “Graduation present.” He didn’t want to elaborate any further than that. Dean hadn’t asked and didn’t need to know, for the moment, about others he had been with in the time since they’d been apart. Really, there hadn’t been many, maybe two or three if he counted Benny, but he hadn’t managed to feel for any of them like he had for Dean, though with this one, he’d been as close as he ever had. He supposed he had liked his company, and so it had taken him longer to realize that he didn’t feel more for him than genuine fondness.
“Oh,” he said, and his brows lifted higher, “Oh, yeah, happy birthday.” He let go of Castiel’s hand, “I’ll go, uh,” he pointed behind him in a vague sort of way, and turned to go when Dean nodded at him like he was a few steps behind whatever it was he was supposed to be doing.
Dean was quiet, but in the time it had taken Castiel to say all of that, he had gotten to his feet and moved into Castiel’s space. He was now effectively hemmed in by the wall, the dresser, and Dean’s body, and he had no idea why he hadn’t just turned around and gone right back out when he realized Dean was still there to begin with. Even dealing with Anna’s cold shoulder would be less stressful than this.
Castiel cleared his throat, “I know.”
Gently, hesitantly, he took Dean's wrists so he could pull his hands from his face, and only paused a moment when Dean flinched at his initial touch. He didn't pull away or make any further move to stop him, and Castiel could see the tears welling in his eyes and the utterly defeated slouch of his shoulders. He just wanted to hold him.
Castiel stepped out of his boots, and tossed his jacket over the arm of the sofa before he emptied his pockets and headed for his room. He would sleep the rest of the day away, and maybe when he got up, the whole thing would feel like more of a slightly unsettling dream than a severe mistake he had made. Maybe he’d go to the garage when he got up and check that Sam and Dean were all right.
He felt the way his fake smile melted right off of his face, but something in his brain wasn’t quite processing what he was seeing.
Calm down,” Sam sounded exasperated, like he had known this was coming.
Castiel cleared his throat when he realized Sam was waiting on his answer, and smoothed his fingers through his own hair. “Yeah, sure. We should probably plan it better- bring swim shorts, at least.”
Dean grinned and gave him a quick kiss on the lips before getting up and going down the hall to the bathroom, “Give me twenty minutes and I’ll have something ready.”
“Don’t give me that, Cas,” Dean said tiredly. “You say you’re fine. But you’re not. It’s obvious you’re not. But you never talk to me. I love you. I think you know how much. But I can’t do this.”
Castiel had stripped out of his button down to his white undershirt once he clocked out for the day, and tossed it over one shoulder while he smoked and walked toward the Winchester garage. His portfolio was tucked under one arm, and he actually had spent his lunch trying to sketch Sam from memory, so if anyone got suspicious that he wasn’t actually doing what he claimed he was, he’d have something to show them. The bruise on his jaw was starting to yellow and fade, and his lip had healed over, so he hoped he looked a little better than the last time Dean had set eyes on him.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “I think you’re mis-remembering. I was the delinquent. You were… a nice, hard-working, square of a mechanic. With a penchant for public displays. I just didn’t know it until after you had already seduced me, and it was too late to save myself.”
There was a knock at their bedroom door, and Castiel looked up.
He’d heard him called
She smiled nervously and said something else to Dean in their native language before urging him to his feet. “He will go,” she said as she bent her neck in deference. “He will play.” He wasn’t sure if she had been made nervous by his place in the household or by his eyes, but he didn’t see any point in thinking too much about it now. He didn’t like to think of it, but she belonged to his family’s house now, and it would have been natural for her to be nervous of saying the wrong thing to him. Still, he had come to accomplish an objective, and it seemed as though things were moving in his favor, whatever the reason.
“Go ahead,” Dean told him. That hadn’t changed, at least. He was always more agreeable right after they had been physical with each other. Castiel leaned over and pressed a kiss to his temple. He got up once more to get his cigarettes and lighter, cracked the window, and when he returned, propped himself against the headboard and pulled Dean’s head into his lap. He couldn’t help wanting to keep him close. He pulled his fingers through Dean’s hair with one hand, and smoked with the other, and he didn’t think he had felt so content since before he’d left for Vietnam.
Dean pressed his nose against the back of Castiel’s neck, “Deal. I’ll make sure to change my relationship status to ‘taken by a true gentleman’ first thing in the morning.”
Castiel’s fingers smoothed a line along the seam of his pants for want of a cigarette. Why in the world was he still standing there? He fixed his eyes to Dean’s though, and refused to look at any other part of him, because he couldn’t be responsible for anything he did if he got to looking at him up close. If there was space between them, that was one thing. It was like seeing an expensive watch in a store window. You knew you couldn’t afford it, and as long as you were on the street outside and the watch was on the other side of the glass, you could peek in and wish for it, but just as easily keep walking by. Being in such close quarters with that watch, actually going in the store and picking it up, maybe trying it on, well… it was a hell of a lot more difficult to keep walking when all you had to do to make it yours was slip it in your pocket and make off with it.
“Take care of me,” Castiel interjected, because he didn’t think he could take hearing Dean say it again without wanting to jump him where he stood. Cutting him off ended up being an equally poor idea as letting him finish the sentence, because Dean looked at him, and their eyes met, and Castiel wasn’t sure what his face did in those two seconds, but it resulted in his lip splitting and bleeding again, and Dean saying, “Hey, you’re bleeding.”
His night had been spent trying to avoid the memory of having had Dean’s lips against his, while also kicking himself for having given in at all, even for a moment. Would it really have been so difficult to have just pulled away? He might have said something stupid, and Dean might have laughed, and his heart definitely would have skipped its way to the moon, but things would be okay. They could continue to be… friends. Or whatever it was they were supposed to be to one another. Ones that didn’t kiss each other, even when it seemed like doing so would be the nicest thing in the world. Besides that, he had been fairly certain that Dean had just been lonely, or at the very least, upset at the time—it hadn’t meant anything to him. Letting himself slide for that fraction of a second was probably enough for Dean to know that it hadn’t been quite as meaningless for him.
“You ready, Castiel,” she asked, her eyes locked on Gabriel’s now raised arms in the distance.
Castiel glanced at Sam, who was scowling, his arms crossed over his chest, clearly unhappy with this news.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a night out like this. Probably not since his sister had moved away. They’d spent so much of their time together before, that he’d almost taken it as a personal slight when she’d picked up and left without bothering to think about taking him with her.
“You cheated,” Castiel grumbled. And he had, Dean had gotten him to agree to that deal under duress. He’d had his hand down Castiel’s pants at the time.
“Cas, look at me, will you? Just for a second, please.”
“All right.” Castiel took a drink of his coffee, fully aware that if Dean asked, there wouldn’t be much to tell. He had never been in any kind of relationship, and any romantic encounters he’d had with other people had been exceedingly brief. “He wasn’t Castor, was he? Or Casper, maybe? ”
They walked together through the factory until they had to part to go to their respective stations.
After reading through this again, I realized there were quite a few grammar mistakes, and so I went back and corrected them. Updates will still be sort of inconsistent, but given that I found so many mistakes this time, will probably be once instead of twice a month for quality control purposes~
He could hear Dean’s grin, “Yeah, I know.”
Sam and Dean stay with Cas for a while.
Although the sky continued to look generally dark and threatening, they made it the entire evening without rainfall. When they had entered the apartment, Castiel had nearly been given a heart attack when Sam and several of their friends and neighbors shouted ‘Surprise!’ and blew kazoos at them. In fact, he’d gone straight to the room he shared with Dean after he offered a stiff “Thanks,” to all of them. His heart was pounding, and his vision had gone a little wrong, and it was all he could do to get himself to the edge of the bed without looking as alarmed as he felt.
Castiel went to get cleaned up and dressed, and made sure he grabbed the candy from the nightstand to keep in his pocket. Dean’s ass for his cigarettes. He drove a hard bargain, but sometimes you just had to suck it up and fight the good fight.
“I’m staying here tonight,” Dean said. “Can we do dinner tomorrow? You can pick us up and I’ll make something for us at home.”
“Besides, it’s not guys that make me happy, you know? Not that I’m not into them. Just… it’s you.” He turned his hand over in Castiel’s and rubbed his thumb along the back of it, “And if we’re all going to be living together, then he’s going to have to get used to us. There are only two rooms, and there’s no way I’m letting you sleep anywhere but next to me.”
