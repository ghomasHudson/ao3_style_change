“Because we will still keep doing all of that, right? The Work is what binds us,” John said, looking up at Sherlock fondly. There was no trace of bitterness or sarcasm in his eyes.
Breathlessly, Sherlock replied, “Suffocating me, overdosing me.” He pointed weakly towards the drug stand.
The minute he was done with the red tape and Lestrade let him go, Sherlock went to the nearest phone shop to get a new pay-as-you-go SIM so he could text John, at least.
Sherlock rose to stand behind him and peered over John’s shoulder at the cake. It had white, swirly letters of icing spelling out ‘
This last part of this fix-it fic explains why Sherlock has never mentioned his other sibling and why ‘Redbeard’ has had such a big impact on him.
(No one would ever believe that they remained friends after she shot Sherlock, except, well, Mary herself, ironically.)
Sherlock snuggled up close to him, pulling the blankets higher over the both of them, and drifted back off into a calmer sleep.
When he woke up, Sherlock found the other half of the bed empty. Of course; it was a Monday and John had a shift at the surgery. Bugger. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed, feeling rather silly when he noticed he was still wearing his lace underwear. He smiled nevertheless as he took it off. He had been a complete fool, it appeared, both to initially have extrapolated their future from the first few weeks and then later to think that it would continuously keep going downhill once they were in a quieter phase. On the one hand, he wished he’d had a bit more relationship experience, but on the other hand, the idea of ever being with anyone else but John was quite preposterous and not worth considering in any universe.
He wasn’t entirely sure what Sherlock would think of doing it in this position, because Sherlock personally didn’t like it like this as it made him unable to see John. But Sherlock could still see him if he topped like this, John reckoned, so he ventured to ask. He clumsily pulled his pants down and only really managed one word: “Please.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, had spent a fair amount of time on his laptop while still in hospital, trying to ascertain if there was maybe some kind of hidden code in there somewhere, until concluding that there really wasn’t. Which was confirmed upon their returning of the pen drive to its rightful owner, a second-year student of architecture, who had been hugely relieved and delighted to have it back.
It had taken Sherlock some convincing over the course of several weeks before John agreed he would try to fake ‘talking things out’ with Mary, or whatever her name was, and staying with her for the last couple of weeks of the pregnancy and the first couple of weeks of the infant’s life. Together with Sherlock, he’d prepared what to say to her that would convince her he’d forgiven her without him actually having to utter a lie.
, which, upon further inspection, turned out to contain nothing but a number of his own tweets retweeted with the same added hashtag each time.
“Do you remember the end of our first case?” Sherlock said in a hushed voice. “Mycroft showing up at the scene where you shot the cabbie, making you realise that my ‘arch enemy’, as he had introduced himself to you earlier, was actually my brother?”
’ screamed through John’s brain, but that would be something for later – if ever. What he really meant was ‘
Sherlock opened his laptop, struggling with the keys to type the right letters in the right order. Slowly. Carefully.
Seeing as they kept getting interrupted by medical staff, it took the entire afternoon before Sherlock had finished telling John everything he knew about the woman who’d targeted him with a texting affair
John nodded to himself and smiled. He’d always told himself he didn’t overly care that his relationship with his sister wasn’t very good. It was just the way it was.
Once they had found a comfortable routine, John subtly tried to shift the angle so as to aim for Sherlock’s prostate. It took a while before he found the exact right position, but when he succeeded, he knew it. Sherlock let out a sudden whine, the most beautiful sound in the world, followed by a bellowing “God, John, yes!” He was soon begging John to never stop, and although John was positively beaming with pride and pleasure, he was pretty sure he was going to disappoint Sherlock very soon in that respect. He was not going to last much longer.
It also gave him the feeling of being wanted, of having a reason to exist and of never needing to be anywhere else but here, right in this moment.
“Oh yes, well, he loves painting animals,” she said, appearing a little distracted by her own thoughts. “I can’t believe he still remembers what Redbeard looked like. I mean, more likely he just coincidentally painted a similar dog from a magazine,” she said dismissively, waving a hand.
John smiled at how insecure Sherlock was with these things. He probably didn’t have a huge amount of experience. “Please kiss me,” John whispered.
Time for a full evening of telly and a large bag of chocolate chip cookies. And possibly a bottle of wine. No,
“The guy is South African,” Sherlock continued. “Moved here only a couple of months ago, together with a colleague. They’re in the gold trading business. The colleague is called Jack. Violet dislikes him. She actually suspected he was her stalker, as he had come on to her in an intrusive way the first time she met him, and she’s run into him on two separate occasions since, which she found suspicious, especially as he took the opportunity both times to shamelessly try and flirt with her again.” Sherlock stopped walking around for a moment to look at John and see if he was still following.
(When John did this, he would just read the words that were in the book – like you were meant to. Sherlock, however, focused on the illustrations and would tell Rosie all sorts of facts and figures about the animal species depicted and what these particular individuals had obviously had been up to, judging by the pictures – and ignoring the text altogether. Because of this, it was impossible for John to get any writing done while Sherlock read to her, seeing as he ended up listening and giggling just as much as Rosie – who didn’t even understand half of what Sherlock was saying, anyway.)
Forcing herself back into the present, she slouched over to her tiny kitchen. She put the plug in the basin, letting the hot water flow over her cold hands as she filled it. Tears fell from her face and disappeared into the ocean of bubbles the instant they hit the surface.
This was one of the most important realisations of my life, and to my astonishment, I could hardly find ANY similar stories on the internet. Also, I'd seen several therapists in the course of a decade, none of who seemed to have realised what was going on. The internet and book shops are full of information about how to deal with your child with autism, but not at all about how to deal with your parents with autism! Eventually, I found a FB group of adult (NT) children of parents with ASD, which has been an enormous emotional support for me in the past years. But because of the total lack of awareness even among psychologists about the emotional impact of having been raised by people with autism, I wanted to incorporate this into my fic. I'm actually considering to write a novel with a similar backstory in the near future.
She glanced over at the improbable pair sitting across from her, two of the subjects she was providing security for. The brilliant detective, who many people thought to be a cold, reasoning machine, cradling the infant and carefully giving her her bottle. It was one of the loveliest contrasts she had ever witnessed.
Despite the village consisting of nothing more than a few hundred scattered houses, a grocery store, a fast food shop and a petrol station, it was of course a minor tourist attraction, as visitors liked to have their photograph taken in front of its name sign. There were in fact a few doing that as John and Sherlock walked past.
detective. My pal Greg Lestrade swears that you occasionally actually come in handy. A fresh layman’s perspective and all that,” Lee grumbled. It was clear that the man was more than a bit sceptical about this himself. He sighed. “Well, as long as you
There was suddenly the astonishingly overwhelming yearning for closeness, for holding and feeling a (very particular) warm body against his – all very disconcerting and undesirable emotions of course, and highly distracting.
As the nerves continued to slowly fall away from him in little waves, he became aware of John leaning against the doorframe, watching him. His relief was visible not just on his face, but in his entire appearance. He suddenly looked several years younger.
“You really like her, don’t you?” Charlotte winked at John, who was now sure his face was beet-red and could only hope that his make-up helped conceal that fact to some extent, while he continued to feign nonchalance.
However, he wasn’t sure what it meant that John had dreamt about him being that spectacularly tone-deaf. Probably a remnant from his earlier self, when they’d first met and Sherlock had only just started becoming properly aware of how his parents’ comportment had shaped his own.
Sherlock had become rather bored with staring at the periodic table of the elements on his bedroom wall and playing the mental games with it he had invented to occupy himself. Initially, it had at least been a mildly interesting challenge to find prime numbers by matching pairs of atomic numbers – with the handicap that every calculation and idea seemingly had to wade its way into his brain through a thick, viscous liquid. Like snot. (It probably
“Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind.” Sherlock looked away again, thinking about the effects that opioids and cocaine, and the combination thereof, were known to have, before taking another drink from his mug. He’d never heard of people having such detailed hallucinations, though.
He couldn’t bear it, because Sherlock was the one person John trusted most in the world. Perhaps even the
Once at Bart’s, they found both Molly and Greg standing next to the slab with the victim on it. They looked up as Sherlock and John entered.
guys been, lately? Fate has been so tough on you two this year! But you both look really well, after all that you’ve been through.”
“So,” John grinned, beaming and not quite knowing where to look. “Here we are, then.” It felt ridiculous just sitting here, on separate chairs, when he wanted to hold Sherlock and kiss him and repeat that he loved him a hundred times over at least.
, managing to make Sherlock promise him all sorts of things, which maddeningly accelerated the proceedings of said activities for both parties immensely. Although John, of course, still tried to draw it out as much as possible, most of the time, as was his M.O..
A blue light flashed in the room, briefly making John wonder if there was a police car by the window. But the source was a small, round lamp attached to the wall near the door, announcing the arrival of Eric, who was bringing tea.
John seemed determined, and undeterred by unconventional measures. For instance, the bastard had tricked Sherlock into enjoying certain board games, by playing them with steaming mugs at their side and nice, calm but uplifting classical music in the background, so that all Sherlock’s barriers were down and he felt relatively content and at ease. As a consequence, he now kept finding himself wanting to play Carcassonne and Stratego with all his babysitters, as he called them.
He sat down in the other chair, not sure what to say to her. She said typical therapist things that meant nothing to him.
John eventually ended up wearing a leather jacket, cowboy boots and a wig with long, greasy black hair.
As he continued along the busy streets of London, he considered how it had been Mary’s newly revealed selfishness, dishonesty and cruelty that had made him stop loving and start hating her. Truth be told, Sherlock had also been selfish and dishonest often enough, and sometimes even cruel, but there had always been some higher cause. And you could appreciate the man for at least never having pretended to be anything different. With Sherlock, John had started hating and loving him pretty much at equal pace, he realised.
In short, being in a relationship with Sherlock was like looking at a diamond, with countless different facets all reflecting the light differently: each beautiful in their own right.
When he looked at other people, he couldn’t help but think about all the fun they were probably missing, simply because they likely never allowed anyone to fuck them (if they were men) or had never fucked their partners (if they were women). To John, it was almost like being part of a secret society of people who knew What It Was Like.
In the cab, he opened the envelope. Once he’d unfolded the paper inside, it was impossible to hide his smile, try as he might, and his previous worries faded to some extent. It contained a silly drawing made by John and Rosie. Rosie had done some random scribbles, to which John had added arms and legs and silly faces in some places, resulting in two human figures standing on top of a… horse? Rhino? With a baby (or was it a little angel?) flying happily in the sky above them. The four creatures were surrounded with coloured confetti, drawn by the two of them (some dots regularly interspersed and round, others more like wildly launched caterpillars).
The goldsmith turned out to be the sort of person who only became more calm when other people panicked (not unlike John himself, ironically), but he did seem genuinely worried and thankfully did not try to talk John out of calling 999. “The phone is behind the counter,” he pointed.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John,” Sherlock grinned back, amused. “I only have a doctor/soldier kink, which I
So that’s how he found himself walking over to Mrs Robins’s house during his lunch break again on a sunny Friday at the end of July.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my amazing betas once again: 88thparallel, mydogwatson and Jonathan, you are truly invaluable in the creation of this fic!
[19 July] Sorry folks, contrary to what I wrote at the top earlier, the next chapter is still not ready for posting. :( I still really really hope to be able to post all remaining chapters before the end of this month, but I have to be realistic and admit that there is a tiny chance that I won't make that and it might be somewhere in the first half of August... :(
Once he did fall asleep, he slept more soundly than he had in years. In his dreams, old memories of their time together mixed with a new imagined future. Strangely, it kept featuring a long-haired setter, which they took for long walks in the countryside, where bees kept merrily buzzing all around them.
He was clearly considering his options, and what it meant to exhibit your own creations. To have other people enjoy them.
“Champagne can wait,” John said, as he hastily started to take off Sherlock’s knitted cardigan and bright pink top, discarding each item onto the floor with a comically over-dramatic scowl.
A few moments later, John came into the bedroom, took one look at Sherlock, and pulled him close. “Hey,” he said, concern audible in his voice.
John especially loved how sometimes, out of the blue and without saying a word, Sherlock would fix him with his intense gaze from across the room, stroll over and start kissing John’s neck, groping his back – his hands all over him – as if making up for all those years of distance between them.
“Sherlock, what is your plan, exactly?” John sounded slightly worried. “Are you sure they are going to be... happy, with whatever you’ve got in store for them?”
For some reason, they didn’t kiss. They just sat and talked, loosely holding hands on the sofa with John’s head rested on Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock’s temple on John’s head.
They hadn’t even bothered to close the curtains. Or switch on any lights, seeing as it wasn’t completely dark anyway. And because they had done neither, no one would be able to see them after all, so it didn’t matter. Also, they were on the second floor, so it would have been virtually impossible even with the lights on – unless someone was flying a drone with a camera out front, of course. Which was highly unlikely to happen very often. (Even Mycroft wouldn’t go
Sherlock lifted his head from the mattress of the hospital bed. “Oh, hello. On a plane, you say? Um, try-try to stay calm. Just te-tell me what your name is.”
John turned around in his embrace to face Sherlock, and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck, softly sobbing about the decades-old grief that had been part of him all this time, and forever would be.
Eventually, they lay chest to chest, almost as if gluing themselves together with cum, Sherlock thought amusedly. The disappointment he had felt half an hour ago was gone completely and replaced by utter happiness (of a magnitude and intensity he hadn’t imagined possible a week ago).
“Dad? What’s happening? What was that text?” she asked, smiling. Strangely, although she still had the same northern English accent, her voice sounded slightly different. “Are you having one of your jokes?” She chuckled, then stopped walking forward and looked enquiringly at Sherlock. “Who are you?”
But other than telling him Bob was a somewhat geeky, slightly dyslexic and fairly devoted roleplayer with an enthusiasm for medieval weaponry, none of that provided any useful insights into his behaviour.
The rhythm of Sherlock’s breathing matched John’s movements, as he let out quiet gasps every time John flexed his gorgeous buttocks to steadily thrust his hips forward and fill Sherlock with the wonderful feeling of giddiness that was John’s cock massaging his prostate.
While they waited for the date of the auditions for Hamlet to roll around, Sherlock and John tried to devise alternative plans to catch Eurus, in case she never showed up there. But, to their frustration, they came up with nothing viable.
their ways made no sense, and how indeed his parents were the ones who were different from the rest of the world, and not so much he himself.
“Same here,” Sherlock breathed, eyes wide. Then he grabbed John’s bottom and pulled him even deeper inside, his fingers digging almost painfully into John’s flesh.
John took a few steps towards the door with him. “I’ll talk to him,” he said in a hushed voice. “Just think it through next time, okay.”
Back at the fireplace, he bent down to light the fire and found himself continuing to stare into the emerging flames, hypnotised, as they released the energy trapped in the carbon bonds of the wood fibre molecules.
He’d meant to open it earlier and then forgot about it. With a sigh, he tore it open and read the letter inside. It was about Aunt Vivian’s inheritance.
Upstairs, he was glad to find Sherlock in the middle of a case: papers scattered all over the flat, pictures of a girl and three men pinned to the wall and Sherlock himself in his pyjamas and dressing gown. He had obviously been inside all day, racking his brain over all the details of the facts surrounding his latest mystery.
Sherlock hastily took it out of the packaging, making certain that it matched the description, and then stashed it in the drawer of his bedside table, together with the lube he had ordered along with it. Then he went back to his mice.
As John and Sherlock looked at each other, there was the welcome sound of a helicopter approaching, quickly making any sort of conversation impossible with its noise.
But as he’d started to reach for his coat, there had been footsteps on the stairs. Then, the door had swung open and Mary cheerfully stepped inside, carrying two large shopping bags full of new maternity clothes – even though she was due in only ten days. The woman was a lunatic in so many ways. (Or was she planning to become a smuggler, hiding illegal goods under a fake bump, once the baby had been born, Sherlock briefly wondered?)
Mycroft looked at him with an alarmed frown. “Is that how you look back on your childhood?” he asked, clearly a little baffled.
Step One of his investigation, before opening his eyes just yet, was to stretch out one arm towards John’s side of the bed and see if his significant other was still there. However, his fingers only met a crumpled duvet. Step Two was irrevocably to open his eyes and check if John had just entered the room with a tray full of freshly baked buns for a surprise breakfast in bed.
John had looked quietly horrified. He knew there was no such body in the morgue at the moment at all.
While they slowly undressed each other, Sherlock purred seductively into John’s neck, “Although I can’t wait to taste and feel you for real, I want to do something else first.” He threw John’s last piece of clothing onto a chair and ran his hands playfully over John’s bare chest. “I’ve been practising, John. Do you want to see?” He suddenly seemed to have turned into a flirtatious teenager, slightly shy and proud at the same time. “I’ve been wanting to show you,” he added in a barely audible whisper.
like this,” John said, focusing on the practical again. “I mean, if the idea behind seducing me was really to be able to kill you, she’s had plenty of opportunity before last week, hasn’t she? So why did she not use it?”
After Sherlock had helped John get dressed and had supported his arm walking to the kitchen, he served him the best jam on toast John had ever had.
By the end, I hope to have given a sensible ‘explanation’ for almost all of the loose ends that the writers of BBC Sherlock have left scattered around in the course of four seasons!
Sherlock put down the paper coffee cup on the interview table so he wouldn’t squeeze it to a pulp out of sheer frustration at the memory, and forced another display of distress onto his face. “We both loved her very much, Sally. She was… like a sister-in-law to me.”
John felt a fierce pride, seeing Sherlock be so completely at ease with his brother depending so closely on him.
In the 2.3 seconds he was pondering this question, John suddenly let out a surprised gasp. Sherlock hadn’t touched him, and it took him several milliseconds to realise it had been his breath. To double-check, he softly blew some air over John’s hole.
First, they headed to a little copy shop on Melcombe Street to have the announcement printed out as a poster.
Feel free to rec this fic on tumblr or Twitter/Facebook/wherever, if you are enjoying this! I’m still hoping to get more readers than this… although I do realise that a lot of folks are just waiting until I finally finish this bloody thing before they start reading it, and I can’t blame them, LOL. Only a few more months, I hope!
Sherlock huffed out a laugh. “Yes. We could even make that our quite unique wedding vow. Imagine people’s puzzled reactions.”
Only then did he spot the framed picture on the kitchen table that John must have found among Aunt Vivian’s things and taken home with him. It was a photograph of Vivian broadly smiling at the camera, standing next to a donkey, among sunny hills covered with olive trees. It was a lovely picture. Taken in southern France, by the looks of it.
One of the many things Sherlock and Hannah had in common was their expertise at dressing up. Her collection of wigs and mock spectacles was actually bigger than his, and she had a good part of it with her at 221B.
Eurus Moriarty is clever, but Sherlock Holmes is cleverer. Greg makes a valiant attempt to help catch her. And John might wake up from his coma soon…
Sherlock had bought each of them a drawing book and a set of colouring pencils to communicate with Sherrinford.
Once outside, after a short moment of relief at this plan at least having succeeded, his thoughts immediately drifted back to John lying in the emergency room, and he felt what little energy he had left being sucked out of him.
When one of the men left to get both the ring and the oil (sensible, as it had probably been the lack of oil that had worn the ring), Sherlock entered the second phase of his mission. “So, you gentlemen have definitely found yourselves a nice workplace, eh? Wouldn’t mind spending my days here myself. Ha-ha! So are they treating you well, the snobs that live here, eh? Are they nice?”
He was particularly glad that she seemed to seriously be staying off the booze now. He knew she couldn’t really help it, having had the bad example of their dad always drinking throughout the day, but he’d always blamed her for reacting to that so differently from the way he had. She’d responded by copying his ways, while he had simply… well… developed trust issues.
“Ah. Yes. The thing with the text to Faith had been my back-up plan, that I’d forgotten about until Smith reminded me he didn’t do handshakes,” Sherlock told John. He held a mug in both hands as he basked in the warmth of the lit fire. “Of course, I hadn’t really anticipated that I’d only hallucinated meeting his daughter.” Sherlock took a sip of tea, gazing towards the floor, and sighed. “Still a bit troubled by the daughter,” he said softly. “Did seem very real, and she gave me information I couldn’t really have acquired elsewhere.” He raised his eyes to John’s. He was trying hard to ignore his bone pain, which he knew would fade once his body gradually got used to the lack of heroin; same for the cold flashes. He shivered, and drew his dressing gown a little tighter over his clothes.
Sherlock felt his face crack into a smile at the mention of his lover’s name. “Very well, thanks. Very well indeed.”
Well, the story that Sherlock was dishing out in the interview room right now would have to do. Maybe one day, when she was older, he could explain…
Sherlock sighed. “Because of that repeated frustration,” he continued, “it doesn’t take much to set me off against him. Anything he says is already too much. I just can’t seem to help it. It simply keeps grating, having been pushed past my own boundaries so much as a child.”
John gently put his arms around him, and relished the fantastic feeling of waking up in a world without any Moriartys on the loose.
It was wonderful to see her enjoy the little playground in the park with the sandpit and the see-saw (John holding her in place on the seat as Sherlock gently pushed and lifted the other side), and just the outside world in general.
Christ, how John ached to be closer to him. To not just hold hands, like blushing pre-schoolers, but to hold him, properly. To kiss him.
He thought about Greg and Molly and how they seemed to be going places just for fun, enjoying themselves and each other’s company. Perhaps he and Sherlock should get out of the flat, out of London, even, for a bit. But before he could suggest anything of the sort to Sherlock, John would have to come up with some sort of meaningful gesture that would break the ice between them.
, for fuck’s sake, and he would not readily forgive himself for putting Sherlock’s health at risk. At least he finally understood the spur-of-the-moment thing.
“The cradle is too small, I’m afraid,” she said to Mrs Holmes. “For the first night, it will have to do, but perhaps one of you can pop over to Mothercare to buy a travel cot tomorrow?”
Sherlock has not yet opened his eyes, still hazy and worn out, his head lolling back slightly. He’s obviously less alert now, which makes John dare to remain standing this close to him: near enough to feel his body warmth and to study the tiny hairs on his jaw – which he does. John studies also Sherlock’s closed eyes and the little wrinkles between his eyebrows, until he wonders whether Sherlock is really not aware of his proximity. Concluding that he must be, in spite of his spent state, John deduces that Sherlock must be okay with it, then. Probably not for long, though. John decides to furtively enjoy the moment while it lasts.
One day, when he had finally found one who he deemed suitable for the job, he invited him to come to Wantage with him. His name was Arnold.
“Sherlock,” Hannah asked cautiously, “I hope you don’t mind me asking you, but things like these did make me wonder: are your parents, by any chance, um, on the autistic spectrum, perhaps?”
He noticed Mycroft looking awfully pleased in the background – undoubtedly glad he might soon be able to stop renting more and more storage space for all the canvases.
Sherlock had been more than a bit clumsy, but thorough, and adorable. Not to mention incredibly sexy, despite his inexperience. Or perhaps because of it? There was something exceptionally pure and sincere about him whenever they were being intimate.
Then suddenly there were two arms around him and John’s forehead was pressing against his. “Sherlock,
Using this note as an entry ticket, however, could prove an ideal way to find his weaknesses, so that she could target him in the exact spot she needed to, and would know precisely which way to twist the metaphorical knife for maximum effect.
He took John’s dog tags from where John had casually dropped them next to the alarm clock, and spun them idly between his fingers. He then spotted John’s broad-striped sweater lying across the chair under the window. He rose to pick it up and pressed it to his face to smell.
The secret Holmes sibling. (Maybe it was a sister rather than a brother.) Why had Sherlock never mentioned them? Some sort of family feud? Even worse than the one between him and Mycroft? Perhaps it was even the source of the strain in Sherlock and Mycroft’s relationship.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was absolutely brilliant.” John smiled a bright smile, not directed at him in particular.
Once at the hospital, John was instantly surrounded by doctors and nurses and whisked away behind the A&E’s swinging doors. A nurse stopped Sherlock from following, and guided him down the hall.
“Well, this most definitely isn’t just an experiment to me,” John reassured. He stroked Sherlock’s back, secretly pleased that he was worried about this. Thankfully, they were on the same page. “And we’ve known each other for quite a while, so I’m pretty sure neither of us has any surprise secrets in store that could change anything.”
There was even a Deaf journalist who wrote for a magazine for the Deaf community, who asked Sherrinford for an interview.
Sherlock kept telling himself that the odds of Eurus Moriarty actually showing up for the Hamlet audition tonight were very small indeed.
Sherlock leaned against the side of a cupboard, hands in his coat pocket, watching with interest. This man had some impressively simple but effective intimidation techniques.
John is too intoxicated to come up with a witty response. All he manages is, “Sherlock, surely you can’t… can’t be serious. You’re evidu--, evidently trying out a new sense of humour, right? Either that, or I’m halloo-“
It took every ounce of effort in his bones to control his thrusts, not to go too deep and too fast. With all his might, he focused on making slow, fluid motions.
John would undoubtedly find some new abhorrent girlfriend again in no time, and that would hurt even more.
First, he needed to reply to an email from the funeral director regarding some painful details that needed to be set for Mary’s cremation. He’d already managed to convince the man that he wasn’t inviting anybody, and that, hence, there was no ceremony, because he wouldn’t be able to handle it. (That much was true.)
Amazingly, Sherlock is letting him caress him, nuzzle him, touch him more intimately than John was doing mere moments earlier, with his cock in his mouth, as weird as it is.
A moment later, she found him standing next to the sofa, looking lost and bewildered, and clearly not steady on his feet. “You alright?” she asked, as she handed Rosie to him.
Two cups of tea and one more changed nappy later, Sherlock padded into the kitchen. “Morning, handsome,” he yawned, gently squeezing the back of John’s neck.
Once they had relocated to the centre, John bent down to softly kiss Sherlock’s chest, then moved up to his neck, by the end of which he finally ended up stretched out on top of Sherlock.
“I don’t do handshakes,” Smith said, as he started to walk towards Sherlock again. “It’ll have to be a hug.”
“No,” he lied. “If Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that’s not something you can fail to notice.”
Sherlock reached for his phone the minute he walked out of the residential care home. He was brimming with excitement to tell John what he’d just learnt: his brother was innocent.
Sherlock scooted closer, with a look of increased panic in his eyes, and asked, almost inaudibly, “John, John, are you upset because you didn’t want to hear me say what I just said? Or because…
But nevertheless, finally being able to express himself to some extent, beyond just painting, and being able to really communicate, however minimally, clearly opened a whole new world to him. He seemed revived in ways none of his nurses had ever seen before.
He was still all control and coordination, although by now he was definitely looking forward to the next half hour as much as John was, possibly even more.
They had waited years and there was no need to rush it now. Also, on some level, John was afraid to do something that would scare Sherlock off. He sensed the risk was there, somehow. But he was also revelling in this phase where everything was new and still mostly undiscovered, so he didn’t mind if it lasted for a bit. And maybe he was savouring the anticipation of more there was to come. Not that he wasn’t nervous.
“It’s like the gold business, isn’t it?” Sherlock laughed feebly, ostentatiously dabbing his forehead. “Getting more complicated all the time.” His voice slightly started to fade at this. “Well, thanks for the brooch,” he muttered. “I think... bye.”
They languidly nuzzled each other’s necks, hands sliding under T-shirts, and mouths finding yet new spots to plant kisses.
It was a painting of him and John, smiling at each other as they walked through a lush, green and white landscape of blossoming cherry trees, below a faded pink sky.
Sherlock’s eyes glazed over as he apparently considered the credibility or the implications of this option.
Sherlock had only barely recovered from his unexpected encounter with Amy, absent-mindedly laying roof tiles, when just after lunch time, he noticed his ‘colleague’ James (whose last name was Wilder, he’d discovered) slip around the back of the Hall again, carrying a heavy looking plastic carrier bag.
Sherlock shrugged and casually strolled over to a quiet corner near the stables, away from the stable’s entrance and out of the line of sight of the builders. There, he sat down and took out the borrowed handkerchief, carefully folding it open. It didn’t contain anything, nor did it look like it recently had. It looked at least three decades old, and cherished – although it could have done with a wash. Sherlock produced his phone, took a picture of the cloth and a close-up of the neatly embroidered coat of arms, before hiding it back in his sleeve. He then ambled back onto the lawn, exaggeratedly studying the trees above him and looking up at the house. When he caught sight of James from the periphery of his vision, he made sure to inconspicuously get near enough to him for his next move. Sherlock stooped, pulling the handkerchief from his right sleeve with two fingers of his right hand and pretending to have just picked it up from the floor, as he called, “Hey! You lost something!”
Smoke curled up from various chimneys into the darkening sky as they walked the quiet streets side by side.
“You know, it has always struck me how practically all of my cases, both the ones involving crime and the mere personal mysteries, eventually always turn out to be motivated by money, love or honour,” Sherlock said. “But in Miss Smith’s case, it was an interesting combination of all three at the same time.”
Sherlock swallowed away the lump in his throat. He could feel tears slowly running down his cheeks as he looked at his brother. He wanted to hug him, hold a metaphorical umbrella over him to protect him from the outside world.
He hadn’t yet seen John cry over her passing, but suddenly, there were tears in the corners of his own eyes now.
“Text. From Mycroft. Who apparently has nothing better to do than scan London’s CCTV footage.” Sherlock showed him the screen.
With both their laptops next to each other on the kitchen table, mugs of steaming tea and a pencil and paper to make notes, they started to plan their
“Er, sure. I can get it for you, if you like. Though I’m quite sure it was a very short list. Only his hairbrush for DNA samples, his pyjamas for the sniffer dogs, and a flowery, red woman’s shawl that was on the floor behind that chair, as far as I’m aware.”
to actually spend his energy and time on. No goal. The only purpose he’d had in the past year had been
bring these two idiots together as a couple, as such events tended to do. Only for Eurus to be able to destroy their happiness
“I’m sorry I wasn’t ready earlier. It just took me a while to get used to the idea, I guess. And then it got worse after… you know.” John caught Sherlock’s mouth in a tender kiss before he could reply, then let go to continue, “You were so trusting of me, right from the very beginning. I just… I’ve realised that I find that hard.” He tried a small smile. “But I really want it now. I want my future husband inside me.”
some of it as well, no less! Golly gosh, my wrists hurt just looking at you signing like that.” She shook her head in a sort of shudder.
!” Sherlock moaned, gripping the sheets so tightly his knuckles turned white. John reduced the contact to only the tip of his tongue, teasingly running it over Sherlock’s frenulum. “God,
Sherrinford looked both bewildered and pleased at all the attention he and his paintings were receiving.
John was not in a good mood. Sherlock could tell the instant he walked into the flat and saw John sitting at the kitchen table. He seemed to be annoyed with the person who wrote the newspaper article he was reading, which indicated he was still in the same general state of disgruntlement he’d been in for the past few days – or weeks even.
Sherlock hurried down his ladder and ran to the main entrance at the front of the manor, pressing fast dial on his phone to contact the local police and succinctly asking them for assistance while he sprinted across the lawn. The older maid was about to stop him as he barged into the Hall, but he got rid of his disguise as he insisted on being let through and she gave in, eyes wide in shock. The earl appeared around the corner of the central hallway to see what was going on.
As soon as it was sent, he deleted the message from Violet’s ‘sent items’, so as not to leave any trace of his actions.
It was Mycroft. He looked like a ghost. His suit was all crumpled up and dishevelled. He seemed to hesitate, before he spoke. “Marcus didn’t make it.” His voice was thick.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped, and strode over to the hallway, where the lift was located. After stepping inside, he punched the button for the top floor.
To see how much of a threat he was, perhaps? Or to figure out how to silence him if that became necessary.
will no longer be followed around on the streets, which is why you came to me in the first place.” From the periphery of his vision, he noticed Bob’s eyes grow to twice their size.
‘No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon. You’re off the hook, Mr Holmes. You’re home and dry,’ Smallwood said, then.
The Baker Street boys had arrived at CDG Airport just a few hours earlier, dropped their bags off in their hotel room and were now headed for the huge glass pyramid that was the gate to art heaven. They were walking on the Parisian pavement at a leisurely pace, content about having a change of scene in Europe’s most romantic capital.
John was rather in awe of the way Sherlock had managed to steer the conversation onto the desired subject. He managed to hide his reaction by studying a particularly well-crafted silver pendant with two hares looking up at the moon.
“Nope. Just for fun.” He took another sip of tea, then stared into the dark liquid, contemplating. “Do you think I should write a novel?”
John felt horrible, once more, about not telling her of aunt Viv’s condition. But he quickly convinced himself yet again that it simply hadn’t been an option, despite how it made him feel, or her sacrifice might very well all have been for nothing.
Sherlock dug one hand into John’s hair – with his other arm still wrapped tightly around John’s middle –  while John clutched Sherlock’s jacket as if afraid he might otherwise disappear into thin air. With their mouths frantically exploring each other, Sherlock managed to push the door shut with one elbow and then let himself fall back against it, which John, correctly, took as an invitation to crowd close and push him against the wooden surface. The increased sensation of bodily contact this created, caused Sherlock to soon feel his erection strain against the inside of his trousers, and he couldn’t help grinding it against John for some relief. He could then feel John’s prick in a similar state, pressing back rock-hard against his groin.
. Of course, Sherlock had always known that ‘Moriarty’ wasn’t their real surname. Still, he hadn’t expected his two worst demons to have such a common family name.
As they brushed their teeth together, Sherlock looked at John in the mirror. He seemed tired but content. He’d presumably read some interesting articles that had been worth his time, Sherlock thought. John finished before Sherlock did and disappeared back into the bedroom. By the time Sherlock went back in there as well, John was already in bed, sitting up against the headboard. Sherlock decided he would just get undressed and see what happened.
When she’d left, the earl continued, “Edith is an artist. She grossly underestimated what it meant to have a child and she’s had several nervous breakdowns since then. There was a point where she could only look at Arthur when he was asleep. She would stand next to his bed, just looking, for an hour every night.” Beverly stared blindly into the distance for a few moments at this painful memory. “I tried to make up for the lack of attention he got from his mum, I really did. But last summer, we decided it would probably be better for everyone if he started boarding. Except then it turned out that Edith and I had grown apart to the point where, well… there was no love left.”
Two years ago, when I started working on this fic (right after S4 aired), I first spent *weeks* trying to come up with a believable scenario that left Sherlock traumatized by something involving his dog (as was hinted at several times in the show). Also, there had to be a mysterious sibling ("The Other One" as he was referred to in two different episodes), and it had to be explained why Sherlock never talked about him. I hope the explanation I came up with is satisfactory! :)
“So I said, ’Who is supposed to have shot him, then?’” Sherlock recounted, between ginger nuts. “To which Sir Edwin replied, ‘Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger, that’s who.’
Sherlock had kissed him significantly longer than usual when John had come back home with his familiar short cut.
“You would have been aiming for me, though,” Sherlock said, thinking aloud. “Mary just got in the way of the course of the bullet.”
. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” he said. He stepped down to the concrete, tottering on the spot.
Molly got into the back and strapped Rosie into the baby seat that they had thankfully arranged to be there.
John had never felt so possessive of someone before. But maybe it was because of having seen Sherlock, who was always so very composed in this respect, become completely undone beneath him (and above him, alongside him; frankly in every thinkable position it was technically possible to give a hand- or blowjob in): it was simply the most exquisite thing in the world to see this genius being reduced to incoherent moans and whimpers, surrendering himself completely to John.
Before mid-afternoon, Sherlock was unrecognisable even to himself. When he looked in the mirror, it was as if a strange woman had intruded into his bedroom.
Sherlock didn’t want to look at him, just wanted to disappear under a big rock, like a pill bug, and hide from the world. He closed his eyes.
John turned to Sherlock. “Has it occurred to you – anywhere in your drug-addled brain – that you’ve just been played?”
Once, Sherlock had bluntly admitted to missing John – even though they’d seen each other only three days before.
“As you know, it was for a case. My interest in her was entirely… fabricated. As I’ve told you, I-- I apologised to her, profusely, and she forgave me.”
As Mummy energetically started dinner preparations, Sherlock mulled over all the new information in his mind.
Contrary to the previous days, that Wednesday dawned bright and sunny, making Sherlock and John even decide to leave their jackets at home. Holdernesse Hall turned out to be in the middle of renovations and building work when they arrived. The mansion was situated in a large clearing of a wooded area, an immense and immaculate lawn, geometrically interspersed with whipped-cream shaped buxus shrubs and two picturesque fountains left and right. Part of the Hall itself was covered with roses, most of them already blooming. To the right wall, there was scaffolding with men in hard hats and orange vests apparently replacing whole windows on all floors, and further across the lawn the stables were also undergoing some sort of renovation, with men carrying construction materials in and out.
“Yeah!” She scribbled the number of her latest burner phone onto a piece of paper she’d had ready for him.
He was, however, not really surprised that Sherlock had known where he was, as he had practically told him, himself. But he needed to keep up the act of not having been in touch.
“John, as much as I’d like to, don’t you think there is a slightly more pressing case at hand right now?”
And during the day? What did it even mean to be in a relationship? Except the kissing, that was. He knew now what kissing John was like. It was better than crime scenes and cold case files and locked room murder mysteries. Better even than John telling him he was brilliant. Better than anything in the world.
After he’d hit ‘send’, he stared at the wall for a while. A minute or two later, he took his phone again and added, “Btw might start therapy again. Need to get stuff out of my system. Not sure talking really helps, but might give it a try anyway. There’s a therapist near my work who’s still taking patients. J”
“Sounds familiar,” Sherlock said with a slight smirk, before rolling his eyes the way he always did during any interaction with Mycroft. “It is baffling indeed, isn’t it, how one couple can produce such wildly varying offspring.”
“Good idea,” John agreed, helping Sherlock put away the last couple of clean plates. “Afterwards, how about we order take-away from that one fancy place to celebrate all the day's unexpectedly good outcomes, hm?”
Sherlock couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen John giggle like this. Nor the last time he had himself.
Sherlock steepled his fingers, pressing them against his lips, while he processed all the information.
“So… How are Mummy and Daddy holding up with having a baby and an armed secret agent in the house, then?” Sherlock asked.
Just in case his big brother was watching, and tracking his steps on the map of London, Sherlock decided to send a message that would get his attention, writing something familiar with the path he chose to walk through various streets.
He looked at John, standing next to him in the elevator. He had his head lowered and was pinching the bridge of his nose.
to considering, was one that he should indeed act upon? While Sherlock never shied away from startling, annoying or otherwise baffling John – always inwardly chuckling at John’s surprised facial expressions – being the cause of utter shock, however, was something he had only done a handful of times and invariably regretted instantly. As he did now.
“You’ve got a scalpel!” Sherlock yelled. “You picked it up from that table.” He blindly pointed to the tray which was then several feet away from him. There was clearly a gap in the row of scalpels and only five remained. “I saw you take it.”
There was a coastal watchtower looking out over the fjord, with a stone wall below it that was made up of large, ancient-looking, squarely hewn rocks, stacked together roughly with cement. A little further down stood a lonely, wooden bench, which had clearly seen better days. A few empty beer cans lay littered around, occasionally attracting the attention of seagulls that were looking for food.
“So does this mean you’re finally letting the past rest?” Mycroft asked, his tone infuriatingly complacent.
“Yes,” the small voice said. “You see, Uncle Tapani unexpectedly came to pick me up from school today and took me with him. I’ve only met him once before, when I was very little. Before we moved. I want my mummy! She doesn’t even know where I am. She’s going to be ever so cross.”
“Do you want a tissue?” Sally Donovan asked, shoving the little cardboard box on the interrogation table towards Sherlock – her eyes wide but still frowning.
“Well then. Can you tell me what happened?” the sergeant had asked, earnestly, as she cradled her coffee.
Whether John was being an appreciative listener to his being particularly brilliant or not, Sherlock just wanted John
From the corner of his eye he saw Sherlock enter the shop a minute later. John moved a little closer to the open door so that he would be able to hear the conversation inside.
John was angry, so angry. And Sherlock couldn’t really blame him. He’d done something wrong. Something very bad. Except, he couldn’t really remember what it was…
It was like there was a happy bubble inside his stomach that was growing dangerously big, bound to burst.
So was it okay to lay down next to him, Sherlock wondered? He had no idea about relationship etiquette.
Even though it was still almost a month until Christmas, the snow – in combination with the already omnipresent Christmas decorations all over London – made even Sherlock experience a bout of winter holiday cheer.
As soon as Mycroft entered, it was as if the very air in the room changed, as usual. But the icy wind touching John’s soul did seem significantly less frosty this time. And it was not just John having gradually become more immune to this effect, he thought.
Sherlock mirrored him, and they just stroked one another for some time, occasionally planting lazy kisses on the other’s neck or shoulder.
Below that, there was a very cryptically worded reference to Mary’s death, “Can Samarra be avoided?” No hashtags, no likes, no retweets.
“I think I do, actually. Thanks,” Hannah said. She gratefully collapsed onto the sofa and, with a relieved sigh, took out her phone.
“Hey, Greg.” Sally lifted the crime scene tape and ducked underneath to approach him. She honestly had a knack for intercepting him just as he was about to head off some place else.
“I don’t know,” John said, taking a few steps towards him, his cheeks a slight pink. “I guess I love you just the way you are. As a man.” He took Sherlock in his arms and let their foreheads rest against one another.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Then he quickly typed out a reply, saying the words out loud as he typed them.
He marvelled once again at the willingness and unconditionality with which Sherlock had offered himself to John, had lain beneath him and allowed himself to be vulnerable.
No new clues could be found under Arthur’s window either. The ivy definitely showed recent damage on branches of various heights, but nothing that indicated that it had been climbed by two different people. That did, of course, by no means rule out that possibility. Someone could still have entered the room via this route, taken the boy and left the note as a false clue.
“God.” John stared blindly ahead of him, his mouth agape. “That must have been… an incredibly horrific trauma to process.”
He got there just in time to see Eurus sneak out through the back door. He also saw John lying on the floor, motionless. For a brief second of panic, Sherlock thought he was lying in a pool of blood, but it was just an irregularly shaped, red rug.
“Gracious of you, to spare me further defeat,” his landlady said with a long-suffering smile. “I’m just going to have another go at my crossword, then.”
John was barely holding it together by this point and in his head started compulsively reciting the only Shakespeare sonnet he knew (once learnt by heart for some silly contest in his uni days); anything to keep his vital functions within normal parameters.
The door opened and a police officer entered. “Sir. You probably want to see this,” she said, putting an open laptop onto the desk.
for John. And Sherlock was so, so incredibly grateful to her. And indebted, of course, seeing as her sacrifice wouldn’t have been necessary at all if he hadn’t been so cocky and sent Mary (Rosamund) that stupid text, which had given away their location at the Aquarium, thereby creating a circumstance where John had had to shoot her to protect his aunt.
I hope that the additional backstory elements I came up with – as well as Sherlock and John’s added internal thought processes about everything that’s happening – made these scenes more satisfying than the version in the show!
And wasn’t it much better to wait until that had happened, before they seriously attempted to properly burn Sherlock’s heart out, anyway? Wasn’t it, in fact, much easier to burn the heart out of that stupid, arrogant, posh brat when he actually had his heart
Sherlock frowned and struggled to remember what day of the week it was. Wednesday. He’d forgotten that normal people leave for work early in the morning on most days.
Was this truly what it would be like from now on? By each other’s side, day and night? The hours of darkness spent together in the same bed, sharing each other’s warmth? Not feeling alone anymore? Or jealous of John’s dates? Ever?
As John took off his shoes and kicked them under the coffee table, Sherlock meticulously observed him, judging whether he might be in the mood for physical intimacy. John looked tired but relaxed and Sherlock decided to go in for another kiss, making it slow and elaborate. Endorphins washed over Sherlock as John melted into his embrace and slowly let himself fall back towards the other end of the sofa, taking Sherlock with him. They rearranged their legs to be able to comfortably lie together and Sherlock revelled in the feeling of having maximum surface contact with his lover, feeling his presence with every part of his body and knowing John wasn’t soon going anywhere. He didn’t want to think about how he might not always be able to do this, about how these things,
He knew perfectly well that Sherlock’s phone’s battery needed charging every night, and he knew for a fact that Sherlock had not taken his charger with him when he left for Wantage yesterday, so those two things combined provided a perfectly plausible explanation for why he couldn’t be reached.
He tried not to initiate sex himself, but he often couldn’t help himself, because whenever he did, she was always up for it.
Every moment John wasn’t at work, he stayed with him, from morning till evening. At night, John slept up in his old room, with Rosie in her cot in a corner. And when he needed to go out, John either took Sherlock with him (taking Rosie for a bit of fresh air, or going shopping) or arranged for someone to stay with him (on regular workdays, during his visits to his aunt in prison, or, once, for a dentist’s appointment).
But Sherlock went on, “I’m sure his exponentially increased microflora and the gaseous compounds they’ve since produced can tell us something about the time and location of death. Bound to be interesting. Especially if you’re in for a nice smell.” For good measure, he’d flashed one of his intimidating grins.
The minute John could see 221B in the distance, a whole batch of butterflies seemed to take flight in his stomach. Still, he didn’t bother to try calming his nerves before he went in, especially if no longer denying your feelings meant it made you feel this young and light again.
“Oh yes. I texted her. She’s actually better at this sort of stuff than John.” He smiled a painful smile. “We’d borrowed the bloodhound of a friend of mine to trace the blood scent on one of the Thatcher busts. Sadly, the dog wasn’t in the mood and we found nothing. Led us to a butcher’s,” Sherlock said pensively. “Although that could have been a deliberate move on the burglar’s part, of course. If he knew he was wounded and leaving a trail, passing through the butchers would be like hiding a tree in a forest. Quite ingenious.” He nodded to himself.
“Yes, sweetie pie,” John cooed back at her. “Next week, we’re going away on holiday! Your very first treasure hunt. Even if we don’t find the shiny black pearl, it will still be loads of fun. Because it’ll be the three of us together.”
When they got home, the first thing John did, was put the kettle on and make some cheese and pickle sandwiches. It was only just past noon, but they hadn’t eaten anything since early that morning before they’d left for Holdernesse Hall. As he pottered about in the kitchen, John observed Sherlock from the corner of his eye, worried. He’d seen Sherlock in a lot of different moods over the years, but he didn’t recognise this one. Sherlock had always eliminated all emotion when it came to his cases. Hell, when it came to anything at all. Except maybe boredom. Or scorn. He was quite passionate about those kinds of things. (Well, and, since this spring, love.) But this had nothing to do with any of those. He actually seemed concerned, distraught, even anxious. His frustration at his lack of specific theories seemed more pent-up than usual, as if he actually…
“Either that, or he’s partially deaf and blind and your follower knew this, and used it to his advantage to sneak past him to the back of the shop,” Sherlock mumbled, staring up at the wall ahead. “Fascinating. I’ll take the case.”
It had completely slipped his mind. He’d agreed to meet her for lunch so that he could take John with him and proudly announce to her that they were together now. He’d hoped that she would be happy for him. (Thank heavens his parents were open-minded enough to be fine with his partner choice.) But the way things were now, he didn’t feel much like going at all, much less telling her anything about him and John. So he was actually glad that he’d forgotten to let John know about this plan, seeing as it was too late to cancel. He would just have to go by himself then.
, committed in the presence of Sherlock Holmes. And he certainly wasn’t going to contribute one iota to it.
In the videos with these two, there had been smiles and a tenderness that had actually surprised Sherlock. Even though they were actors, a lot of it had seemed genuine and spontaneous to a certain extent. There had been no trace of discomfort in the lanky boy’s body language, and Sherlock had enjoyed watching the pair more than he’d thought he would.
In short: John Watson would pretty much be able to bed any pretty girl or boy he liked. He was the captain of the university rugby team, for crying out loud.
He entered the room with a bag of TD12 in one hand and a contented smile on his face. Plus a lovely feeling of anticipation in his stomach.
He then felt two hands on either side of his head, holding him inches away from John’s face. John looked at him as if he were watching water burn. It took a while before any words came out of his mouth, and when they did, he was just repeating what Sherlock had said. “You think I don’t love you anymore, because I haven’t made love to you in over a week?”
His gravelly, only-just-awake voice had sounded even more seductive than he had intended it to, and he didn’t know if it was that or just John’s general state of infatuation, but either way, the toast and eggs were cold before the men returned their attention to breakfast.
Sherlock stood up, sighing a little, and took his hand. Instantly, John clasped Sherlock’s arm with his other hand and turned it over. Sherlock rolled his eyes as John pushed up the sleeves of his dressing gown and shirt to reveal all the dark marks on the underside of his arm, where he’d been injecting himself.
John sobbed as he stood there, completely lost, tears pouring from his face and falling to the floor.
As he brings the pints back to the table where Greg sits waiting, John resolves to leave right after this round. Only this prospect gives him the strength to sit through the rest of their conversation and respond like a proper friend to what Greg says.
He must have been able to tell that Sherlock was only staring at him, obviously more than a little love-struck, and not really listening, for he added, “Or would you perhaps like a kiss for starters?”
After a while, he walked over to the rough, stone wall and started systematically feeling every stone in it at chest height, seemingly checking if it moved if he tried to wiggle it.
They remained on the sofa for a very long time, embracing and occasionally wiping away each other’s tears in quiet resignation.
That last bit wasn’t even untrue, if you went back in time far enough. John had, at one point, really loved her, Sherlock thought. And even Sherlock couldn’t deny that there had been a time that he, too, had actually – surprisingly – genuinely liked Mary, and thought that she could be the person to make John happy.
He reluctantly turned his head back far enough to be able to look at the screen once more from the corner of his eyes. No. It definitely didn’t look like that. Sherlock was completely relaxed and enjoying himself infinitely more than Mycroft could bear to witness.
Just deflect the question, Sherlock thought. Change the subject. “The mortuary; your favourite room,” he said. “You talk to the dead. You make your confession to them.”
Mycroft took the tea pot and raised his eyebrows at Sherlock in a silent question, before pouring him a cup. “I’ll be mother.”
Well, this information was not saying very much, certainly. At least thirty hours had passed since Arthur’s disappearance; more than enough time to travel back across the Channel.
John’s instincts urged him to turn away, close himself off. Get help for him elsewhere. He couldn’t bear seeing the manifestation of addiction up close, especially not in someone he cared about this much. Someone who, additionally, was bound to breach the iron trust he had in him, in favour of a hit. (Which junkie wouldn’t?)
John couldn’t tear his gaze away from his lover. The brilliant git’s plan had worked perfectly from beginning to end.
“You know what,” Sherlock whispered, “if you try on the dress like a good boy, I will suck you off as soon as we get home.”
Sherlock tore his eyes away from the couple to look at John. Did he disapprove? Or was he just joking? No, he was decidedly beaming and Sherlock bit his lips to hide a smile.
“I had the strangest dream,” John whispered, sounding to Sherlock a bit like an undercover agent from a bad film passing on a secret message in code (and thus making Sherlock have to suppress a chuckle, which would only have hurt his throat anyway). “When you came back from your two-year mission, “ John went on, “and I still thought you were dead, you disguised yourself as a French waiter with a fake moustache and showed up during my proposal to Mary at The Landmark.”
“Oh, I invited them. On behalf of each other. Neither of them can afford such a posh place, of course. Not yet, anyway.”
The truth was, however, that Sherlock, who had never been as relaxed and cheerful as he was now that he and John were more than friends, had thought he might actually enjoy going on a holiday, with John that is.
Sherlock had, however, rested his head on John’s shoulder, and they had simply continued to sit like this for a long time – until John had let go of his hand and got up to make some tea. There had been nothing awkward about it. It was as if they’d been testing the waters, which had felt very comfortable and pleasant indeed.
But she seemed to pop up in conversation again and again, like there was no avoiding her. He’d incorrectly presumed she was out of his life, when he’d buried her ashes. But she kept haunting him, it seemed, surfacing in unexpected places. Or at least, some sort of innocent version of her, who was supposed to be mourned and missed.
Mycroft realised that a lingering hint of the earlier smile on his face probably prompted Anthea’s question. “I’m not entirely sure,” he said, not bothering to hide his confused state. After a pause, he added pleasantly, “But I think so, yes. Possibly even more than alright.”
“You think so?” Sherlock raised an amused eyebrow at the man behind him, as he shut the fridge door. “And what did I do yesterday, or the day before, or the day before that, to deserve all the
“Yeah, I never quite believed she actually fell for the story that I’d simply started sleeping in your room so that Hannah had a place to sleep upstairs,” John said, chuckling, as he dried off his hands. “But let’s visit her anyway. She deserves to get some happy gossip material after all of this morning’s consternation.”
Sherlock had his mouth open and blinked, undoubtedly brooding on some sort of sarcastic reply, which, however, didn’t come to him within the time frame of the second and a half that she remained silent.
Sherlock dazedly looked up to see John timidly smiling back at him, still gently holding his prick, his hands dripping with cum.
--A child’s coffin would be more expensive. This is in the lower price range, although still best available in that bracket. This is a practical and informed choice. Balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman distant from her close relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice. SH
In addition to the fact that the gesture at hand was a sop to placate John and quench any inclinations towards finding a new place of his own, it was also, indirectly, in accordance with their new Pact of Honesty (which had been John’s condition of his moving back in with Sherlock).
you’re already quite aware of. Now quickly change the subject before this becomes awkward.” They both pressed their lips shut to avoid giggling, and studiously looked around the grounds, each in different directions, as they continued walking up the path to the main entrance. Their light mood was however quickly replaced by a more heavy feeling as they approached the door behind which a family was missing their only son.
“The Louvre can wait. And yes, I’m getting an idea…” Sherlock couldn’t keep from remarking with a cheeky smile.
“If you increase the dosage four or five times,” Sherlock said softly, “toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour.”
The first thing John saw was paintings. Dozens and dozens of paintings: a few hanging on the walls, but most of them standing on the floor, stacked behind one another against the walls. All sorts of different worlds displayed hyper-realistically and in lively colours. At first glance, some almost looked like photographs.
“Well done, Molly,” Sherlock said, forcing out a smile. “Well, at least this trip gave us some fresh air.” He was about to turn and leave, when John started a conversation, asking Molly and Greg how they’d been.
Once they were inside his room, Sherlock took the initiative to go in for another kiss while simultaneously undoing first John’s fly, and then his own. They stepped apart for a moment to take off trousers, shoes and socks, both breathing as if they’d just chased a murder suspect across London.
All the rumours and misassumptions from people presuming they were together, that they’d endured for
John, with an overpowering intensity that was probably the result from his cerebral cortex being largely disabled – all the energy in his body going to the most vital organs only – , leaving the stage to his reptile brain with its primordial urges, which were now taking over his conscience.
“Now the tables are turned,” Janine couldn’t resist cheekily remarking, as she sipped her coffee in the dimly lit lounge of 221B.
All Sherlock had to do was come up with a tactic, somehow, to have Sherrinford draw what happened that fateful day. Then he would finally be able to find out what made Sherrinford do what he did, and what it really
The man with over a hundred thousand search results on google was a bloody celebrity, for crying out loud. How in the Lord’s name had Sherlock gotten the idea that this guy was a murderous psychopath?
Arthur smiled at them from a sunny holiday picture on the side table, taken on the shore of a lake, presumably in Italy, judging by the colour of the sand and the height of the mountains in the distance. Just as in the description that the earl had given them, a woman that was presumably his mother was very aptly only partly visible in the background, with her back turned towards Arthur and the photographer. As Sherlock contemplated the level of coincidence in this piece of photographic symbolism, he became aware of a soft noise made by John shifting uncomfortably in his chair. Then he cleared his throat.
Meanwhile, his cock had become so hard under John’s mouth that it ached and Sherlock was starting to become rather desperate himself. An unfamiliar sensation, and he was not sure whether it was in fact unpleasant or not.
need utter clarity on this. So I’m just going to be as explicit as I can in order to avoid all misunderstanding here. Are you actually
This wasn’t right. What in heaven’s name was John thinking? Was this some kind of practical joke, meant as revenge for saying something foolish like this?
Also, they didn’t actually live together, seeing as John still had the terraced house he’d lived in with Mary.
! I haven’t had one in, let me see, well, I’ve lost count really of how long it’s been.” He points a finger at Sherlock. “
He went over to the kitchen to pour himself some of the coffee John had made and sat at his desk, in the chair that was still vaguely warm from John’s body heat.
Sherlock let out an uncharacteristic but genuine giggle and there was a kind of relief in his eyes that John couldn’t quite place.
Smith walked to stand between the two of them and gestured at both. “Well, I thought you two were old friends!”
She started slightly when a police officer with a ballistic vest and a rather large gun across his chest opened the door to her.
She spotted him just taking the funny flower from behind his ear and raising his eyes to the heavens as the bus pulled away. He hadn’t actually meant to wear it, apparently. Pity.
Once the door opened, Sherlock took a few strides inside and then leaned his back against the wall, panting slightly, his mouth half open and his head tilted backwards, looking at John from the corner of his eye as John hurriedly hung up his coat and closed the door behind him.
This earned him some exquisite moans from John, in turn heightening his own desire even further, to the point of deliciously losing all control.
Although the experiment had been a rather efficient form of distraction, it could never fill the gaping hole that was John’s absence.
“Thank you,” Sherlock replied, smiling as he took it. “Actually, a very apt place just occurred to me for us to buy our rings.”
“I just wanted to bring you some casserole leftovers,” Mrs Hudson spoke through the closed door, articulating clearly.
“I offer ten thousand pounds to the man who can say where my son is. I hope that is a good enough incentive to try your very best, Mr Holmes.”
, it’s amazing what people are prepared to ignore.” Smith’s voice shook with effort as he resisted Sherlock’s struggles. “There’s always someone desperate, about to go missing... And no one wants to suspect murder if it’s easier to suspect something else!”
“Did he now, really?” Mummy replied, cheerfully surprised, oblivious of the emotional implications of what Sherlock said. “Interesting, isn’t it, how his brain works. He paints the strangest things sometimes.”
John stared back at him, unmoved – at first. And then, as John allowed Mycroft’s implications to properly sink in, it finally, slowly, began to dawn on John how important he
Sherlock smiled a polite smile. He really was very fond of Mrs Hudson, and if he had to listen to anyone nattering on about country fairs like this, he’d rather it was her.
Sherlock only now looked up at John, who was staring him down with military stringency that was, interestingly, in no way lessened by the fact that he was rather absurdly pointing a wooden spoon at him.
John felt anger rise inside him, as he remembered how he’d ended up in that well in the first place.
All five remaining chapters (i.e. all of Part Three) are now finally in the process of beta'ing and final editing and I'm planning to post one every two or three days from now on. :)
(He’d had no idea about his mum stealing other people’s academic research, and wasn’t sure what to think now. But that could wait.)
“So, er, Johnny, want to tell me what that is all about?” Harry asked, nudging her head towards the remaining armed agent.
In the more private moments they shared, John loved each new and unique mole that caught his attention on Sherlock’s skin, every new ticklish spot he discovered, every new sound he managed to elicit from him.
Sherlock imagined future use of BSL during stakeouts, scuba diving sessions or simply for normal conversation in a couple of decades, when they would both be old and hard of hearing (and keeping bees in the garden of a nice little cottage in Sussex, although admittedly, the details of that plan hadn’t yet been discussed).
Greg suddenly felt his throat had gone dry and he swallowed, telling himself once again to close the bloody door and get out.
Sherlock frowned even harder, feeling both baffled and happy for Irene at the same time. And impressed, at how well she’d kept all this a secret from him, in spite of their frequent texting. He’d known she’d been seeing a woman at some point, but nothing more. Then again, come to think of it, he’d never asked.
; the only person who’d ever vaguely looked out for her. She angrily squeezed her eyes shut against the tears that were about to well up as soon as she allowed herself to feel how much she missed him.
It had been his very last few still functioning brain cells that had made Sherlock tell John that he needed to practice bottoming first, as the rest of his mind was overwhelmed with both arousal and apprehension.
As John walked over to the kitchen, he could exactly picture the averted looks in the silence that stretched out between the two detectives and he had to suppress a snigger.
you now? It would just have upset the both of you.” She raised her eyebrows as if she was surprised by her own statement, when quite the opposite was obviously true: it was clear there was no room in her mind for other views on the matter.
“First of all,” John said,” I still love you just as much, and I have no intention whatsoever of leaving you. Ever. You hear me?”
On the other hand, she was suicidal and equipped with a cane and a gun, just like John had been on that first day. So maybe not so strange.
In addition to it being beautiful, in a logical sort of way, sign language was also extremely useful in all manner of situations in which it was either unwise, cumbersome or plain impossible to speak out loud.
Still, the kiss was the most gentle kiss John had ever received. A very careful touch of lips, lasting several wonderful seconds. (Minutes? Days?) It was as if his whole life had led to this point in time. This moment, their love finally being sealed with a kiss, after so many years of trying not to think about this, trying not to want this, when this was exactly what he wanted. The
Sherlock was soon contributing to the rhythm, panting into John’s neck – first sleepily, then more and more energetically, clearly having woken up properly thanks to all the action suddenly taking place.
There was a short silence during which Sherlock looked at him with the most sincere and open expression John had ever seen on his face.
The next instant, he turned away with a pained expression and he went back to sit on his stool near the window, staring intensely at the half-finished landscape painting on the easel standing beside it. He took one of the tubes of paint that lay in a neat row on the window sill and fidgeted it repetitively between his fingers.
During the rest of the afternoon, John relieved Sherlock of having to do more talking by asking Mrs Holmes about her embroidery projects of MC Escher’s mathematical designs, Mr Holmes about his garden and his preferred control methods against box tree caterpillars, and then Mycroft about his views on the current political situation in the EU. To John’s surprise, their gathering actually became a rather pleasant one, once Mrs Holmes had stopped asking awkward, closed-ended questions. She was, after all, also a lovely, friendly, intelligent and funny woman, who simply occasionally – and entirely unpredictably – seemed to spectacularly miss the mark with her comments.
Slowly, a plan started to crystallise in his mind, like Tetris blocks leisurely slotting into place.
John hastily opened his fly and applied the lube. Sherlock was patiently looking up at him, wild curls framing an eager face, biting his lower lip in anticipation. His heels were almost touching his bottom and his knees were pointing outwards.
Sherlock alternately tapped his fingers on his armrests. He hated this phase of doing research; he was always impatient to get a proper lead that he could actually work with. It was a matter of struggling through all the inane and obvious questions that his clients had been too insipid to ask themselves.
Irene pushed herself off the bed and checked her new hair in the tiny mirror. Then she walked out of the room and down the stairs.
Being made love to by Sherlock was wonderful for entirely different reasons. John didn't really experience the ecstatic physical pleasure that Sherlock usually seemed to feel (even though the initial unpleasant burning sensation had thankfully largely subsided), but having Sherlock be completely in charge of what was happening was incredibly hot in any situation, including during sex. Interestingly, after the first couple of times, most of Sherlock’s insecurity had frequently started to make way for something vaguely authoritative and dominant that John secretly had to admit turned him on no end. On top of which, Sherlock was almost always able to deduce exactly what John was or wasn’t comfortable with, even to the point of knowing precisely what it was he most desperately longed for in each given instant.
“Let’s go see him. Scotland Yard.” And off Sherlock strode, out of the room. John shrugged apologetically and raised his eyebrows at Molly, who flashed a shy smile as he made to leave after his partner. “Good luck with, er, the lady’s ear,” John said by way of farewell as he walked out the door.
Lestrade’s reaction was slowly threatening to become even more embarrassing than Mrs Hudson’s, who had been harassing them with her smiles and winks and extra food ever since she had caught them kissing in the hallway.
With considerable effort, Sherlock opened his eyes. He had no idea where he was, and only the vaguest memory of the past twenty-four hours.
“Sherlock, what’s going on? Why are you asking me all this?” His voice sounded like sanding paper, as if he hadn’t talked in days.
Falling in love with Briony and moving in with her had definitely been the best thing to happen to her in a long time.
He looked at Sherlock, who was grinning, in spite of the physical discomfort John could tell he was in. (Nausea and cold flashes, by the looks of it.) John briefly put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and looked him in the eye. “Thank you,” John said softly. He thought about hugging Sherlock, seeing as the hug they’d shared an hour ago had felt so good and calming. (And so very, very right.)
Sherlock was quite calm when he said all this, as if he was finally looking at the situation from a distance, simply stating facts.
John was surprised to get to know a different side to Mycroft as well. There was something decidedly meek about him in the presence of his parents – or perhaps there were simply other things on his mind, which caused him to react with less vigour and sarcasm than usual. Maybe he missed Marcus all the more in settings like these. Mycroft had, of course, never had the opportunity to bring the man he’d loved to any such family gathering, John realised, and was perhaps a little envious of the fact that his youngest brother now could.
John nodded and gave Sherlock a quick kiss. Then he went to make some tea for himself and sat down behind his laptop to answer an email from the estate agent. Once that was done, he would write an email to Harry.
“There is no scheme, John. You were shot in the head with a rubber bullet. You’re still recovering.”
Very clever of Arnold, Sherlock realised, to first show Sherrinford what goal they were heading to and what the possibilities of sign language were. That way, he would understand it was not just Arnold teaching him some personal communication method he had invented himself, but that there was a world out there where this was actually used. (Which Sherrinford naturally had no way of knowing.)
Sherlock nodded. “Most likely.” As he looked towards the grove in the distance, he tried not to feel the desperation suffocate him. He had hardly anything to go on in this entire case. At least the ransom scenario was now by far the most likely.
Surrendering himself to John had felt strange and awkward at first (especially without doing anything back), but the way John had looked at him and had kept covering him with tender kisses – as if he’d never seen anything more precious in the world – had made him feel safe in a way he’d never experienced before.
“Thank you, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, gnashing his teeth. Then he quite calmly gave his parents a summary of how they were, cleverly shifting the focus of the conversation to Rosie and then to his and Sherrinford’s joint painting sessions. He let Sherrinford tell them all about his latest canvas he was working on, translating what he said into spoken language for the rest.
There was something desperate about Sherlock, something John had never seen in him before. Almost pleading, submissive. And it was breathtakingly beautiful.
Sherlock shook his head, smirking. “There is great entertainment value in the things you come up with in your sleep, John. It seems your capacity to create fiction even extends beyond your own consciousness.” He took another sip of the hot liquid that was meant to soothe his throat, but didn’t yet seem to be having much effect. “Although, come to think of it, I had a rather strange dream myself, as well, last night. Must be the flu. It’s suddenly coming back to me now. I dreamed we went to Morocco to find Mary, like I made Sally believe we did when I gave her my witness statement last spring, and then we ended up in some sort of hotel where AJ suddenly showed up. But then, in my dream, there were guns being fired all over the place and I threw over a table to protect you and there was lots of chaos. Anyway, the only thing I remember clearly was I shot a lamp, which then magically repaired itself. Oh, and before that, I was playing Happy Families with a local boy, but I didn’t know how it went. It was infuriating.”
Annoying as it was, Sherlock was probably at least partly right, seeing as John found he was too weak to protest properly. “Well, maybe if I just lie down for half an hour…” he said.
He frantically started pulling open drawers, rummaging inside them until he found what he was looking for. Then he switched off the overhead light. Shining his UV torch onto the note, two words appeared in large letters, overlaying the handwriting.
“Yoo-hoo! It’s ready!” Mrs Hudson’s muffled voice called from the landing. “Can someone open the door for me, please?”
“I missed my weekly visit to Aunt Vivian this week. She must really be wondering why I didn’t come.”
John was only wearing jeans, which, on closer inspection, were unzipped. Combined with the way he was taking his time and the fact that Sherlock looked a bit reddish around the lips, this was an obvious indication that John was reciprocating Sherlock’s earlier favours (making Mycroft rather glad he hadn’t tuned in half an hour earlier, as he wasn’t sure he would have been able to ever delete
“That’s exactly my point.” Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes or look away. “Please tell me they didn’t think it started when Mary was still alive,” he whispered loudly.
“God, Sherlock I don’t know, I’m honestly kind of afraid… you know, of hurting you. I wouldn’t want that.”
John teasingly blew him a kiss and continued to do the washing up, as Sherlock grabbed a tea towel to dry.
Although, on second thought, how could he really be sure that it wasn’t true that John didn’t want to see him, or let Sherlock help him? Sherlock’s previous ‘help’ had been utterly useless and counterproductive, after all. Disastrous, in fact. He’d meant to help John get Mary convicted, not force him into a situation where he had to
And now here they were: both naked on John's bed. John lying on his back, giggling up at him as he gently tugged at Sherlock's shoulder, clearly intending to pull Sherlock down on top of him.
He and Eurus looked at each other for a short moment, Sherlock enjoying the obvious shock and loathing in her eyes.
The next time Sherlock was in Wantage for their BSL lesson, Sherrinford signed, “I want to show my paintings to more people. In an art gallery. Take them out of storage. How to arrange?”
The truth was, despite his rather impressive inventiveness as far as imagining possible scenarios of all sorts was concerned, Mycroft had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that this was actually his brother on the video image now burnt onto his retina. He’d never seen him like this, or even imagined he could be like this: with his guard down completely and enjoying something so unrestrainedly; readily surrendering himself to another person and allowing himself to be carried away to such extent. John Watson had miraculously chosen to shower his little brother with love and care and Sherlock, astonishingly, was accepting it, basking in it, even.
Saheed swallowed nervously, then looked round at the woman and two other men in the room. “Okay, everyone.” Clicking his pen shut, he pulled the sheet over the face of the person on the examination table.
John started reading out Greg’s text, and only half-way through, Sherlock agreed, “Oh, very good, indeed. Let’s go.” He quickly drained his cup and grabbed his coat.
Without even changing out of his disguise, he took a cab back to Baker Street, letting Lestrade take care of the rest.
. Except that, since last Saturday, whenever he now looked at Sherlock, it wasn’t pure elation that he felt. It was also pain and anger about the mental scar that had been so cruelly inflicted on him all those years ago.
“They both seem to be trying to seduce her, each in their own way,” Sherlock said thoughtfully. “Bob seems to have succeeded, I’d say, but has lost interest. But he hasn’t really, because he keeps following her everywhere she goes.” He stood up again and walked to Bob’s picture on the wall, giving it the intense and rather dominating stare he usually used on suspects to get them talking. It occurred to John that this was apparently not a conscious method at all, but rather a natural reflex that accompanied his scrutiny.
Sherlock knew there was no point in arguing. Also, he understood only too well that John wanted to help catch Eurus and be part of this. Although John still needed to rest a lot and take it easy generally, he was probably indeed better enough to go out by now. And Sherlock reckoned they might as well have some fun while doing it.
John’s mouth was on his way to Sherlock’s left nipple when he was surprised by Sherlock’s deadpan voice: “John”.
As ridiculous as Sherlock had always thought it to find one person the most beautiful and amazing in the world above all others, he was now finally reaching the point where he was giving up all resistance to these kinds of feelings.
The house was wonderfully quiet, save for the little, contented noises that Rosie was making and for the dull city noise from outside in the background.
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock walked over to the sofa and pinned his notes on the wall next to Sherrinford’s painting of Redbeard, which was now hanging beside the smiley face.
While they were stuck in traffic with their cab, Sherlock let out a long sigh, before stating, “If it was a mud stain, there is a good chance that this murder will never get solved. That bruise was my last clue.”
“John, stand still for a moment,” Sherlock ordered. He put his hand on John’s forehead. “You belong in bed. You’ve got a temperature, John.”
Before he had the chance to become any more philosophical, Greg agitatedly came back into his office with a bunch of envelopes under his arm, unceremoniously throwing them onto his desk before he plonked down into his desk chair himself.
“Bad doctor,” Sherlock mumbled again with what he very well knew was a shit-eating grin on his face.
Sherlock had been caught in the same circle of despair so often by now, that he should really know how to handle it.
After a minute or two, they were back to practicalities. They sat on a bench with Vivian and discussed what to do.
Sherlock blinked a couple of times. He didn’t understand John’s reaction, couldn’t understand what he’d just asked. “So it isn’t that, then?” he managed. He didn’t want to consider the alternative that was now, once more, trying to present itself to him. But the words came out of his mouth before he’d allowed them to. “You just don’t love me anymore, then?” His eyes were burning and he cursed himself for becoming emotional like this.
“I guess this should do the trick, then?” Sherlock asked, eventually. He realised his voice sounded ridiculously low now in contrast with his appearance, but thankfully, he wasn’t supposed to speak anyway, this evening.
“I don’t care how,” John angrily interrupted him. Strange, how it felt good faking anger at Sherlock. Also, it was kind of important that Sherlock didn’t blow their cover in his current state, so it was relevant to shut him up without mercy.
bad idea), John’s cock springs to attention as it’s freed from trousers and pants – only inches away from Sherlock’s face.
When Sherlock finally did fall asleep, his dreams were restless and strange. After a frantic chase where Edith Beverly was running after him through the streets of Toulouse with a French baguette in her hand from which she fired shots at him, he was suddenly back at Baker Street, though not in 221B, but in the 221C flat, in the basement. The room he was in, however, looked very much like the bedroom at 221B. The bed was definitely identical. He was in the bed, with John, and Sherlock was lying on top of him. The next moment, John’s legs were spread wide on either side of his own and he was inside of John, topping for the first time. Instantly, he was frantically slamming into him, without restraint. It felt fantastic. Sherlock realised he wasn’t being careful the way John always was, but he seemed unable to do anything about it. He looked up and found to his horror that John’s face was contorted in pain, but still he didn’t know how to stop, or even slow down. John cried out, and the next thing he knew Sherlock was falling into a burning abyss, falling and falling, his arms flapping wildly in a way that felt scarily familiar and real, his coat and scarf billowing frantically behind him, on fire, as he crashed onto the rocks of hell beneath and he was reduced to dust and nothingness.
Each morning, Sherlock opened a good old-fashioned, large, paper map of Norway over their breakfast table and scrutinised it for no apparent reason. When asked, he said he preferred it over the digital map on his phone.
“God, I was so scared you weren’t going to wake up anymore,” Sherlock whispered. “I love you so much.”
When Sherlock got back home, John was out. He’d left a note on the kitchen table that said, “Gone to Leverton’s to choose a coffin. Back around 1pm.”
One more autopsy and then Molly could go home and watch the new episode of Pretty Little Liars that she’d been looking forward to.
Later that morning, when they ate the bread with nothing but some butter on it, Sherlock decided it was the best thing he’d ever eaten in his life.
Irene studied her for a moment. “Thank you,” she then said. “You have already saved the lives of my wife and our daughter.”
John had read two newspapers and drunk three coffees-to-go when he finally spotted his targets inside their flat. He first saw young Craig, who seemed to be dusting off the shelves right next to their largest sitting room window. Luck had it that he was in very clear vision from where John was standing. The youth took several cartoon figurines off one shelf and put them on the windowsill, then later put them back again one by one, once the surface was dust-free. “Oh shit!” Craig suddenly exclaimed, loud enough for John to hear through the open window. That same moment, John saw something small fall through the air, two floors down till it crashed on the pavement with a soft but sharp sound. “Oh, man, I’m so sorry, Steve,” John heard Craig say as he turned away from where he stood. Then Steve appeared, hobbling to the window on his crutches and looking down at the shards below, distress evident in his stance and demeanour. “Oh no! That was my Aladdin that I got at Euro Disney Paris in 2003! Oh Craig, how could you not have been more careful?” Steve reproached his young lover.
the jealous one.” She winked exaggeratedly at John, who sat next to Sherlock on the sofa – very much closer together than normal friends would sit, with John resting his elbow on the backrest near Sherlock’s shoulder, one leg casually pulled up.
do. On top of which, if parents aren’t able to properly recognise their child’s feelings, nor to tune in to those feelings, let alone communicate about them in any meaningful way, it will naturally influence a child’s emotional development.” He looked down at Rosie in his arms and gently stroked her back. “It took me decades to see what had happened.” He was silent for a bit, as if reminiscing. “Sherrinford has it too, of course. In fact, I’m starting to think that might be all that is wrong with him, besides being deaf. I mean, he has been diagnosed with low IQ and a severe form of autism, but I’m not so sure anymore how severe it is, exactly.” Sherlock squinted into the distance. “Or how low his IQ is, for that matter.”
Once he had Rosie dried off and dressed again, he took her to the lounge, where he found Sherlock sitting on the sofa with his elbows on his knees, fingers steepled in front of his chin.
“Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice,” Sherlock objected. “I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say...”
While John mainly enjoyed the scenery and casually checked whether they weren’t being followed or observed by anyone in a suspicious manner (just in case), Sherlock looked for possible hiding places for Rosamund’s and AJ’s loot: in hollow trees, under letter boxes, under loose paving stones, in conspicuous crevices of old walls or rocks, beneath loose soil near unmovable landmarks.
