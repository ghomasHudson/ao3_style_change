Right. Because of course they have to be a cutesy couple too. He brings them their drinks, going light on the rum for
Thirty-six hours into being a father, he starts to crack. Thank whatever deity is feeling merciful that day, because at least it happens when Sam’s back from whatever case Jody had for him.
The tip of the blade presses into his throat, and just as he starts to say his first Hail Beelzebub, he’s saved. By Castiel’s idiot human boyfriend walking into the room.
“What? You asked me to officiate, I’m an ordained priest of the Satanic church and these are our vows!”
“You remember how I told you I used to want to do musical theater? And how I wrote a musical for a book series I was super into and performed it?” She nods. Marie had told her about how she had the cringiest phase back in high school where she got obsessed with these
, but his vessel, Jimmy Novak. He’s come too far to ruin this mission by blinding Dean with his true form.
“Come on, it’ll be fun! Jack, back me up on this.” A small part of him has the decency to go “eugh, fun weekend projects with the kid and husband.” He’s a friggin’ soccer mom. All he needs is the 4pm glass of wine and the bad haircut. He even caved and got a minivan two years ago when Jack started ballet lessons.
at her dad’s gas station two days ago. The video she sent finishes loading, and meaningless tidbits of drama seem more interesting than AP Lang Comp, so whatever. She hits play, and sees two agents talking about the open investigation in the chips aisle.
He knows the look on Claire’s face only because he’s seen it on his own face: unbelievably touched, but trying to play it off. “Sure, whatever. I call shotgun.”
“Well, no need to worry. I’m fine, see?” He holds his hands out in an ‘I’ve-got-nothing-to-hide’ gesture.
, good job Dean, you idiot, way to make a first impression with the guy who’s gonna be waxing your asshole on a regular basis - looked at him like he was an insane person. “Yes, it did rhyme. My name is Castiel,” he said, holding a hand underneath his name tag for emphasis, which only probably wasn’t as petty as it looked, “and you can head to room 104 for me and undress. I just need to get some more waxing strips, I’ll be with you in a few minutes.”
“Isaiah Thompson,” says Mr. Tall Blond and Stupid, which is perfect, because now Dean has a name for the guy whose arm he’s gonna cut off. He’s not even supposed to
"Ma'am, believe me, we both understand the seriousness of the situation," Sam said placatingly. "And I'm not trying to argue that the ends justify the means, but in the meantime, we now know that there is a lone survivor within a day's run, and it would be inhumane to leave him to die because of a breach in protocol that led to the discovery."
“Yep,” Dean grunted, straining to to keep his grip on the heavy pipes Charlie was working to join together. His palms slipped and he hissed.
“Oh, the bag!” He’d almost forgotten to ask. It was sitting in the corner, the guitar case propped against the worn fabric. The faint whisper of his father’s orders came back at the sight, a little more raw than usual coming on the heels of the nightmare. He probably shouldn’t have bothered bringing it with him; he probably should have dumped it somewhere a year ago, when it become obvious that there was no longer a point in hauling it around. After everything, though, he couldn’t give up this last thread, certainly no more than a useless relic anymore, connecting him to his past and to his family.
“Hmm,” Naomi said noncommittally. “I trust you’re aware that the sun will be setting soon, and that we have no runners to spare who we could send out to assist you in your return?” Dean rolled his eyes, knowing full well that even if the entire roster of runners was rested and in full health, the major wouldn’t offer their support. She’d consider it too close to coddling, encouraging laziness and lack of discipline. Naomi was undeniably excellent at maintaining order and keeping things together that by all rights should be falling apart, but she didn’t know the meaning of “relaxed.”
“Because it’s a bachelor’s house,” said Missouri. She looked way more at peace with all the risque humor than Dean would have expected her to be, and his appreciation for his new neighbor ticked up a notch. “‘You make an honest man out of that boyfriend of yours, and then maybe you can expect people to ease up on you.”
“Well, how many of these children listening now are going to grow up remembering those weeks when they couldn’t go out and play with their friends, but you helped fill their days with something besides cartoons and internet games?” Castiel said.
The wry twinkle in his eye clearly said that he knew how transparent the real reason behind the offer was. Castiel didn’t care if he was being placated to keep him from doing anything stupid, though. The idea of sitting around a campfire with no idea what was happening made him want to break things. He and Amelia climbed into the back of the ranger’s ATV, and once more they started back up the trail toward the overlook.
“Welcome to my life, pretty much on a daily basis,” Jimmy said, shaking his head and smiling ruefully. “You take a close look at Cas’s hair, then mine, and you’ll see I’ve got way more grey starting to show up in places. It’s worth it, don’t get me wrong, but it’s also the scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life. Every night, it’s like, ‘Well, I managed to keep her breathing another day.’”
Something clattered and crashed near the back of the house, and they all jumped, startled. Dad recovered first, giving Castiel a hard shove forward toward where Naomi was standing on the porch. “Go!”
“I mean, not to look a gift horse in the mouth or anything,” Dean had said to him on the phone one night a few months into the investigation. “But I’m pretty sure our Stanford librarians would have kicked me to the curb by now, telling me to do my own damn research.”
No, he hadn’t. Between one thing and the next, time just kept slipping by, and there never seemed to be a good opportunity to clear the air with Sam. Besides that, Dean had been too busy to spend much time with Sam, period; his evenings were taken up by house projects, and his days were packed with work. Every evening, he crashed hard on the temporary folding cot set up in his unfinished bedroom, and there was just no energy left over for social interaction. Obviously, the recent lack of connection was backfiring on Dean, because now it seemed Sam was keen to up the ante on sharing and caring.
“She says she didn’t, and I believe her,” Castiel said. “She was distraught over the idea that she’d abandoned me with no clue that I wasn’t necessarily terminal. God, just talking with her, though,” he groaned, flipping onto his back and running his hands over his face. “I’d pretty much accepted that Dad was up to his elbows in something with this, but now I can’t stop thinking. Our father destroyed the world, Dean.”
“Good thing Gabe’s joining us next week.” Stiles shrugged, “I already asked him to make a stop before I pick him up.”
Stiles had woken with a shout, the light peeking through the blinds forcing him to audibly wince, and then yell when he moved and felt like a steam roller had driven over his entire body. Shouting made his head hurt, and he curled into a tighter ball from under his blanket.
“No, you dumbass.” Stiles could practically hear Erica rolling her eyes, “It had to be someone who wasn’t biased towards
“It’s great to finally meet you guys,” Stiles shook his hand with a grin. He leaned against the counter from where he sat, “What I really wonder is if you guys can actually live up to the stories Sam’s been telling.”
Erica and Boyd stopped, looking at him and then back at each other. Boyd sighed, crossing his arms over his chest, pointedly looking at Erica to explain.
For as icy as Stiles had been to Derek since he got back into town, the man barely looked like it phased him. Stiles wondered if that came with being a bartender. He was mixing drinks, pouring beers for their friends, and soon time passed quickly enough that Stiles was back on the stage, drumming through a mix of their songs while Dean tested the acoustics and sound mixing. They didn’t practice outside of gig warmups, and sometimes they ended up jamming more than playing the written tracks, especially when Stiles got to play alongside Crowley, but the crowd ate it up. They let the energy of the group and the venue guide how they played – Jess always complained it made marketing their sound harder, but Stiles loved it. They couldn’t be captured on a CD, reproduced for mass consumption. You had to be there for the live performance, and every one after that, because no two were alike.
“How are you going to use that degree of yours once you graduate, kid? You should be doing an internship this summer, networking.” John questioned.
“He told us he had some business to take care of up north with one of Peter’s old acquaintances,” Erica continued.
Between the two of them, the joint was quickly burned down to the end. Stiles pocketed it with a sigh, pointedly not looking over at Castiel’s stare. “No more emergency stash, promise.” He held up his hands in mock salute.
“Give ‘em hell,” Cas remarked, hopping off the table and back into the throng of people surrounding Dean. As soon as Dean spotted him, he pulled Cas back over, kissing him soundly before diving back into the story he had been in the middle of telling.
Erica laughed when Stiles tugged her close, planting a loud kiss to the side of her face. Apparently, Boyd did not trust Stiles as much as she did, and, because Derek taught all of his betas to have a flair for dramatics, jumped down from the ladder they had used to climb up, all but pushing Derek to hop down ahead of him. They weaved their way through the crowd with ease, Erica being pulled out of Stiles’ hands when Boyd’s firm arm wrapped her waist.
Stiles knew it wasn’t going to be easy, exploring this thing with Derek, and for now it was just good fun, but Stiles knew not to fall too deep like he had the first time around. They were hitting the road soon, anyway. It wasn’t like him and Derek had professed some undying love or shit—Stiles hadn’t done it before and he wasn’t about to start now. But their attempts at talking, really getting to know who they had become in the years of silence, quickly dissolved into them making out with little to no words actually shared.
Castiel jumped in immediately to back Dean up. “I was actually just coming over to get you because there’s somebody inside I want you to meet. Sam, good to see you,” he said as he firmly steered his brother in the direction of the door. Dean breathed a sigh of relief; one of the primary goals of their plan had been to prevent any extended contact between their brothers.
All this is un-beta'ed, by the way, so if you see something strange, let me know. You know, something other than whatever's going on with Dean right now.
By noon, Dean’s hangover had almost completely dissipated, just in time for lunch with Sam. Unfortunately, it was Sam’s turn to pick the place, which meant that the two of them were crammed around a tiny wooden table at some trendy little “artisan pub,” whatever the hell that was supposed to be. Half the stuff on the menu was vegan or gluten-free, but obviously that wasn’t doing a thing to hurt the popularity of the place; every square foot of the place was packed. Good thing his headache was gone, or this would have been a disaster.
Dean whistled. “Lucky break,” he said. “And later you are definitely going to be telling me how you managed to pick the lock. That’s impressive stuff.” Castiel shrugged awkwardly and opened his mouth to reply, but Sam cleared his throat to pull their attention back to the matter at hand.
In fact, he was so much on board with the idea that it took him a moment to realize he’d been lured into a corner, metaphorically. Claire was poking through the smooth pebbles on the bank, and Castiel and his brother were whooping and splashing each other happily and generally making such an entertaining sight that Dean almost startled when Amelia spoke. Sitting next to him on the flat rock and dangling her feet beside his into the cool water, she murmured, “Mating looks good on Castiel.” The words were innocent enough, but they definitely carried the hints of Serious Talk in the undertones.
Maybe she was right, he thought. Castiel was never going to let him hear the end of it if he had somehow given himself heat stroke or some other avoidable nonsense, but that would come later. “No Pedialyte in the woods,” Dean said. “And I’m out of water.” If there was even a little stream anywhere near, he could use the water purifying tabs in his pack, but…
Oh, God. He should have been paying attention. “Eileen, what are you doing to me?” he moaned. Sam was practically levitating with glee over the turn of events.
“Well, it got my attention,” Dean said with a shrug. “It was so…powerful, I guess. Not just the talent, which—damn.”
…headlong into a cleaning cart, which rolled away as he tried to catch himself, leaving him stumbling and falling hard on his hip on the linoleum floor. The scent of bleach burned in Dean’s nostrils, and he stood back up as quickly as he could, scanning the area to find out where Castiel’s dreaming mind had brought him.
“Aw, but, Cas, you were my new dream,” Dean sighed, batting his eyelashes before cracking up in laughter. Castiel flattened his lips in an attempt to look unamused, but the edges of his mouth quivered with the effort to hold back his own mirth.
“You played violin? I was a cellist!” Kevin was babbling in the background. Sam had kept his mouth shut but given Dean an amused look when they’d heard Kevin greeting Charlie and Channing with far too much enthusiasm, but now he was starting to look impatient. They hadn’t seen the first sign of anything dangerous so far, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t anything out there, and Kevin was obviously not giving his all to the job just then,
“So we’re back to having to replace the whole slab,” Dean said, slumping. At least it wouldn’t be the entire house, but that would still be a greater job than he could even pretend to do on his own.
“Awesome,” Dean said, making his way toward where Amelia had slumped against a tree. “Here, why don’t we put on some magic cream, too? I bet all princesses wear it when they’re in enchanted forests.”
“I may not be on Team Winchester, but Jack is a different matter altogether,” she said. “If the Entity in the Empty managed to actually lay hands on him, we’d have ourselves a situation that would make banishing Chuck look as simple as sending a naughty child to his room. Me, I don’t intend to take that risk, and I will stop you, young man, if you try it.” The last part was aimed sternly at Jack, who dropped his head forward sadly and sighed.
“Okay, so, Cas,” Sam said encouragingly. “And where did you two meet? I haven’t heard you mention anyone named Cas before.”
“I just need more time,” Dean said with a sigh. “Maybe if I can hold him off a few more weeks, I’ll be able to convince him we decided to split up. Sam can do his whole comforting thing, and I’ll let him ply me with hot chocolate while I mope, and then make plans about how to move on.”
like this. Usually, if Castiel was unconscious, it was because he’d been beaten that way, and you just didn’t sit staring like an idiot at your bruised and bleeding friend.
“Okay, that’ll wrap up this week. You guys have any questions about anything we’ve talked about, or you think you just need to hear it explained by somebody who’s not me, Meg’s got open office hours on Wednesday night or you can make an appointment. Don’t forget, your essays on the structure, processing, and physical properties of polymers are coming up due Monday, so if you haven’t started on those yet, you’re probably in trouble. Don’t wait until it’s too late to dig yourself out.”
She sighed, looking exhausted. “Mister Winchester, I have a dozen problems on my hands as it is. Besides our usual issues of more mouths than meals, more enemies than bullets, and more work to do than hours in the day to do it, I now have to deal with finding resources to handle a the dozens of survivalists we now know, thanks to our new resident moonshiner, have been hiding around the area and starting pointless, imbecilic turf wars over their asinine bootlegging start-ups. Not only are we fortunate not to have accidentally had a Runner stumble across one of the ones who have apparently set deadly traps around the area they’ve decided to claim, but apparently more than a few of them have families. With children. Hiding in little shacks all over the uncleared countryside, just waiting to be set upon by the undead.”
“God, why does everyone think that?” Dean couldn’t help feeling a stab of hurt. Even his coworkers had given each other sidelong glances when he’d told them what he planned. The fact that he’d had to call in a professional within a day of closing on the place was irrelevant; none of them could have known how badly he would be screwed by the first goddamn inspector, dumping a whole lot more shit into his lap than anyone could have anticipated.
He was right, of course, but that didn’t mean Dean had to like it. Watching the clouds come closer and closer, lanced by the occasional blinding flash of lightning, they picked up speed, breaking away from the creek and heading out onto a dusty road just as the first fat drops began to fall. Within moments, the sky started to really open up, and they found themselves sprinting toward the first building they spotted ahead on the road.
“Hmmph,” she said, not sounding convinced. “Speaking of things I know about, I want to see those pictures you’ve been flashing around.”
God, he’d barely been home for ten minutes, and his head was already spinning terrifically. Castiel had been on him from the moment he’d come through the door, determined to make up for the hours they’d had to be apart. Unfortunately, just when things were really starting to heat up, Castiel pulled back, gently slowing his kisses until they were just dopily gazing at each other’s faces.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam replied. “Just calling to see how day one in the new place is going. You sound beat, man. Tougher work than you thought?” There was gentle teasing in Sam’s tone, and Dean winced, closing his eyes and tipping his head back toward the ceiling.
He couldn’t really be expecting Dean to recap the whole rejection, could he? What, did he want to make sure Dean was crystal clear on the fact that nothing was going to happen between them? This was a cruel joke. “Cas, why are you doing this?” Dean asked.
“Are you a child?” Dean scolded, then immediately gave up any tenuous claims on greater maturity by attempting to climb up Sam’s back to grab the gum. There was an undignified scuffle, involving a lot of laughter, before they finally settled down and, leaning against the desk, shoved the gum into their mouths.
“So I’m wondering,” Castiel said, looking thoroughly relaxed and in much better spirits than before. He toyed with the label of his cold bottle of water (“No drinking when I’m on the job,” he’d replied to Dean’s offer of a beer, though not without looking extremely tempted), then drew little rings on the fiberglass tub with the condensation. “For everything I’ve mentioned so far, your questions have all been about how difficult the repairs will be, how long they might take. You haven’t asked one question about the cost to do it. That’s unusual, in my experience.”
“Is that one wearing overalls?” Dean asked. “Hey, group of four zombies, one of them a girl, one in overalls who’s kind of skinny like a scarecrow…quick, see if the others look like a lion and a tin man!”
After all, Dean wouldn’t have believed any of this, either, if it hadn’t been Bobby Singer’s familiar voice on the radio when those first Runners had stumbled across him and Sam a couple of months into the Crisis. He’d been ready to knock them out and run—not kill if he didn’t have to; the men were obviously still human, after all—when one of them had suddenly gotten a funny look on his face and called them by name, then grinned and handed over his headset. Hearing that voice, one of many familiar voices that Dean had thought he’d never hear again—that had been the first moment in a long while that he had felt like he could really breathe.
Castiel’s shudder was full-body. “Clearly not.” Maybe the skeleton was too small to be human, but any rat that size would be the stuff of horror flicks. “Cat?”
house. That concept was still going to take some time to sink in before it would stop feeling surreal.)
“That’s no little helicopter,” Dean volleyed back, then added with a twinkle in his eye, “and don’t call me Shirley.”
“How long have I been unconscious?” he asked instead, returning the glass to Dean, who set it back on the table.
Castiel huffed, rolling his eyes in annoyance. The mattress was narrow, but it was just wide enough that he was able to roll onto his side and then further, landing astride Dean with a hand planted on either side of his head. “You are infuriating,” he said, “and all the more so because you’ve had every reason to be. I know for a fact that you are every bit as good as you think you are. You can run twenty miles, scale walls, handle weapons with ease, and take on an entire mob of the undead, all without losing that insufferable smirk.”
“Oh, but if you can hold out a little longer, you’ll hit some sort of sweet spot where he’ll be fine with it?” Meg said, arching one perfectly tweezed eyebrow. “It’s only going to get worse the longer it goes on. Unless you think you can produce a walking, talking, real-life guy out of nowhere and pass him off as your man, then face it. You’re screwed.”
Castiel was out in his van, writing up the report on Dean’s abomination of a house, and Dean was trying hard to get air into his lungs. On one hand, he was thankful with every fiber of his being that he hadn’t gone messing around trying to map the mystery circuits without knowing better. He imagined Sam calling his phone, over and over, and growing more frustrated, while Dean lay dead on the floor, smoke rising from his body. At least he wouldn’t have had to hear the “I told you so.”
Back in the bunker, Castiel’s body had seemed to Dean to be more discarded than dead. That was probably part of the reason why his brain had been so slow to grasp what had happened; Castiel had dropped like a puppet whose strings had been cut, like a vessel being left by its occupying angel but without any of the usual flashy light show. Castiel was just…vacant.
“Tell Donna she can have this one if she gets out here with her shotgun! I’m never touching a saddle again,” growled Dean, leaning forward slightly, perhaps squinting into the distance toward home, or maybe just trying to prevent his ass from bouncing any harder against the unforgiving leather.
“You can’t even eat burgers without trying to sweeten them up, can you?” Dean sighed, then turned and got Gabriel his burger and a few strips of bacon from the foil-lined top rack of the grill. It was an extremely calculated risk, having Gabriel here at all, and only a carefully outlined plan had let Dean feel okay about taking it. It had only been a month since Castiel had finally, grudgingly, admitted that maybe he should let his brother in on the fact that he and Dean were dating, and he was now dealing with exactly as much shit as he’d feared. On the other hand, Gabriel had decided he actually liked Dean—though being on the receiving end of Gabriel’s “friendly” behavior had made Dean terrified of ever becoming his enemy.
“Sounds better than the alternative,” Meg shouted, firing one last time before pulling back. As a group, they backed toward the partition, keeping up the gunfire as long as they could, while the bitten soldier held the door closed as long as he could. Finally, just as they turned to go, Sam aimed his gun for the man’s head. “I’m sorry,” he shouted.
Reluctantly, Castiel finally nodded, looking down at the dirt. “There’s some Tylenol in our bags,” he said. “For if the water doesn’t help your headache.”
“We’ve talked about this,” Dean said the moment the driver’s side door creaked open. “If the car’s making those kinds of noises, don’t drive it anyway. One of these days, it’s gonna freaking catch fire or something if you don’t quit ignoring its cries for help. We need to just get you a new car.”
Behind them, the mist seemed to glitter. It was probably nothing more than glow worms. Neither Castiel nor Dean even noticed, anyway.
The animals at the veterinary center on base were left unattended in their kennels when the zombies attacked and killed the vets, with unfortunate results. A soldier looks through a window and is horrified, but we only see his reaction, not any description of what he sees specifically.
“Lunch with him tomorrow,” Dean said. “We’re going to Minsky’s, and, yes, I will bring you back your breadsticks, so you don’t even need to ask.”
since witnessing how you hold your pencil between your lips when you’re concentrating? Those lips, Dean. They’ve been the subject of so many, many fantasies, as I’ve considered all the ways I want to—” He didn’t get to finish that sentence, what with Dean lunging forward to capture his lips again.
“I know, but it’s worth it,” Charlie said with a shrug and an apologetic smile. “Sturdier construction means the signal repeaters don’t need to be replaced or repaired as often, which means that
Naomi’s frown deepened. “Except that you wouldn’t actually know if you weren’t hearing the handler. What you might have construed as silence between instructions could have been an important warning that you wouldn’t have
“I can do that,” Dean said, imagining it. “I mean, we did kind of tell Eileen we’d help out with that at the center.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, trying not to smile. “I hoped things would be quieter when I headed out, that maybe the Army would have gotten its shit together with the martial law enforcement so I could try getting the bag to Doctor Benton. I went through it the next day, and it’s just a case with some flash drives, a notebook full of some code I can’t read, and…” He paused, then gestured toward the duffel. “You look.”
. “So what if there is?” Dean said, feeling cornered. This was the worst. Being caught before he even had the chance to confess was a double whammy of humiliation.
in one’s new house? “Like, a human skull?” he managed to whisper. He wanted to look for himself, but at the same time, there was absolutely nothing he wanted to do less.
“YOU!” Another voice, growling from the doorway to the bar, made both men jump and turn. There, backlit by the streetlights outside, stood Castiel, practically bristling with indignation.
“Yeah, and the old six-string,” Dean said cheerfully, oblivious to the storm in Castiel’s head. “I mean, I haven’t played in years, myself, and I wasn’t even all that great back when I did. Not like you, anyway. But you’re amazing, man. Like, first time we heard you, it was hard to convince Sam that you weren’t actually some recording left on repeat.”
“Yes, well, I clearly overestimated your brother’s ability to see through an act. Of course, we were only partly acting. Your brother undoubtedly picked up on the brewing attraction between the two of us, which was all the evidence he needed to buy the whole story.”
“Why, is there a major research closer than that one?” Dean raised an unimpressed brow at Castiel’s sarcasm. “Sorry. It’s just…I don’t know. I studied engineering, not chemistry or bio. I’m fairly certain Tessa has ordinary lab equipment already, so we probably would need something more advanced. Ideally, yes, we could use Benton’s equipment, since access to that would mean we also had access to anything else he had left in his office and lab, but I’m telling you, that’s not an option. Naomi already told me that, when I had a similar idea. There are far more zombies swarming the base than we can send fighters to handle. We’d be overwhelmed in minutes.”
Castiel Novak (2LT), while technically AWOL, is to be allowed to remain at the New Lebanon settlement camp for the time being. He continues to be closely monitored by a trusted source placed close to him.
Knob and tube wiring is one of those things that tends to be exaggerated in terms of how bad a discovery it is, but I can tell you that you definitely don't want to find it in your kid's closet, connected to the bare bulb fixture sticking out of the hastily finished wall...which flickers on occasion.
“Probably because I’m not interested in sleeping with every pretty boy or girl who happens to cross my path in a given day,” Castiel muttered. “A lack of interest is not the same thing as difficulty or need of assistance. What I need is for him to stay out of things that do not concern him. I am doing quite well on my own.”
“I’m not sure if there's anything I’d consider natural about you spending time in a gym,” Sam teased. “I don’t know if you realize just how much that’s throwing me, Cas. Dean spent years insisting that exercise was a form of torture.”
“I am not Count Rugen!” Dean had protested, and Castiel’s laughter had echoed deliciously in his ear.
“Yeah, but…” Dean looked around helplessly. He wasn’t sure what he should, or could, possibly do, but he found himself very reluctant to chalk up the mysterious voice as a pre-Crisis artifact and let it go.
The moment his fingertips brushed the sleeve of Castiel’s trenchcoat, the swirling grace flooded his system. Maybe he shouted, or maybe the deafening noise was blasting inside his own skull; he gasped, reflexively trying to pull back, but it was too late. Just before the grace fully overwhelmed and consumed him, he thought he felt the fabric beneath his fingers move, almost imperceptibly.
Unfortunately, none of them did. Was the sound getting louder, in fact? Probably just his imagination again. Damn it, so much for simple. With a sigh, he went back to the first breaker, shut it off, then trudged upstairs to see if it had been the one connected to the light.
“I made it worse than it had to be, though,” Dean insisted. He held up his hand when the others tried to object, speaking over each other. “No, I mean it. It wasn’t just…I know I wasn’t thinking entirely straight, with the fever and crap, but that’s no excuse for not giving Cas the benefit of the doubt when he tried to tell me it wasn’t a grand idea to go off alone when I was visibly, obviously, in bad shape. That was just stupid.”
This time around, his heart didn’t race like it used to do when he was in high school. Instead, he waited for Derek to actually voice his thoughts, refusing to give the guy an out.
Stiles rolled his eyes in response, because, honestly? He may have been an asshole before he met Derek, but now their assholery complimented each other and he was not going to change his stance on that because the guy actually wrote him two words on a half-shredded piece of paper.
“Don’t look at me like that, Sam” Gabe rolled his eyes, “You’re not the one sharing a bed with the kid.”
Stiles laughed sharply at that, “I forgot, everyone has strict loyalties to Derek except the resident hunter, sorry for my mistake.”
Sam may be right, he could be over-assuming and being paranoid, but something didn’t feel right this time around. Stiles decided not to push it, wanting to give Scott the benefit of the doubt and tell him on his own. He just hoped it would come out sooner than later.
Stiles grinned down at the photo, thumbing through the likes he had on it. He had posted it to his Instagram quickly before hopping to sit on his stool behind the drums.
Derek looked carefully, eyes looking down at the shirt that Stiles was still wearing before recognition appeared to dawn on his face.
Stiles was moving between bodies, out somewhere in the middle of the crowd, dancing just as wildly as those around him. He grinned when he caught sight of the guy from the club, smirking when he watched his eyes trail up and down Stiles’ torso, still naked from when he’d pulled his shirt off. Stiles was about to start walking towards the guy when another hand tugged on his shoulder, spinning him around. Before he could shout at the offense, he smiled when he caught sight of Erica. “You made it!” He yelled out, throwing his arms around her.
, and margaritas quickly turned into tequila shots, which turned into body shots, which turned into Boyd glaring at Stiles as he did a shot off of Erica and Lydia. He grinned, the wedge of a lime caught between his teeth from where he pulled it of Lydia’s mouth. The girls were laughing, hopping off the table where they had laid down. Stiles looked up to see Isaac had taken a snap of the event on his phone before tossing it back to Stiles. He gave a shrug at Stiles’ questioning look but laughed it off to go find Scott to get another cup of his booze.
At the mention of the Sheriff, the crowd grew louder, and while Stiles’ may have been imagining it from his position at the back of the stage, he could’ve sworn bodies started moving harder than before down front.
They were close to the end of their first set, which had turned into a clash of sound as Crowley started riffing off of the beat Stiles was punching out. Castiel had his own solo during the last song, having built his own momentum with Dean singing more to his flexing fingers as they moved quickly across the frets than the crowd. As Castiel’s fingers moved further down the neck of the guitar, Dean ripped the mic off of the stand, pulling the cable with him, bending to his knees on the floor, looking up at Castiel in near worship. Dean’s voice was raw, brash, yelling out the words as he gravitated closer to Castiel.
“I guess so.” Stiles looking down, tracing the lines of the piece he had gotten his senior year of high school. It wasn’t anything cool that warded off evil, but for all the time he spent agonizing over the full moon, he figured he at least deserved some memento to remember the time by. He had the phases of the moon going down the line of the inside of his upper arm, the sting of the needle bruising the soft skin for days after he had gotten it.
“Yeah,” Derek nodded, “It worked at the club, figured it would here, too.” Stiles’ head bobbed in understanding.
Stiles looked across the stretch of grass in front of him, watching people weave through the mid-day cluster of bustling students as they made their ways in and out of buildings.
The show went off without a hitch, the crowd having not thinned out after two straight performances. Stiles wasn’t sure if the gig completely sold out like the first two, but judging by the never-ending line of people swarmed by the bar, he figured the owner was still making a good buck on their performance. Stiles had played the whole performance without a shirt, kicking himself for not packing more clothes before leaving Palo Alto. They had managed to do a quick wash before heading out to the club, and Stiles wasn’t sure where they’d be staying once they made it into Oregon. Figured it was better to save the shirts just in case.
Stiles barely batted an eyelash at the lingering looks he got from the crowd as he packed up. For as much as fun as he liked to have after shows, and as much fun as he knew some of the guys in the crowd could probably be, he just wanted to sleep. After spending the night up with Crowley, barely catching a couple hours before they were back on the road, plus the emotional whiplash being back in Beacon Hills was putting him through, he knew he was going to hit the pillow hard.
“Nope,” He said, leaning against the door frame to the kitchen and narrowing his eyes at the pack as they not-so-subtly stood close together. “Traitors, all of you.”
“Looks like you’re going to have to leave them begging for more,” Castiel leaning forward in his perch on Dean, grin feral.
Stiles laughed, taking a snap of his ceiling and adding several emojis of ice cream and cookies. He quickly typed out:
After most of the parents and kids from school cleared out, Scott and Allison pulled out two bottles from her large tote bag. Stiles eyed his best friend warily. Last time he tried drinking with Scott, he ended up shitfaced with Scott sober as a cucumber.
“Can I help you?” The guy looked up, eyeing Stiles warily. Stiles shoved his hands into his pockets, looking just as much like the delinquent drummer crowds loved him for being.
“Oh.” Stiles paused, processing what Sam had said. He fiddled with the shirt hem before looking back up, eyes wide. “Sam, this is going to sound crazy, but by any chance did I—”
Erica pulled the tub of ice cream back from where she had put it on the shelf behind the bed. “C’mon, we got more where this came from.”
Stiles mumbled an affirmative, looking down at Erica’s nails and adding another coat of black. She had badgered him, saying if he could wear eyeliner and dye his hair, he could paint his goddamn nails, and he quickly realized he was not going to win the debate. Stiles had to admit, it didn’t look half bad. And then she had told him, hey, I painted yours, you have to paint mine, too, and for all of his fumbling and fidgeting, Erica’s nails came out looking pretty alright.
“Yeah, we have that up north.” Dean argued, letting Castiel’s hands turn his head. He closed his eyes, humming, as Cas started gently massaging around his temples when he was done. Castiel didn’t press the issue, instead turning to hand the gel back to Stiles.
“Our audience has grown,” Castiel remarked, threading his fingers through Dean’s hair, a calming gesture Stiles had come to recognize.
“Then stop acting like some groupie, they’re so annoying.” Sam huffed, directing his attention back to his open text at his desk. The new semester hadn’t started yet, but syllabi were being posted, and Sam was getting a head start on his reading.
“Don’t see why not,” Stiles shrugged, nursing his own beer. He ran a hand through his hair—grown out, spiked up, tips barely holding a hint of blue after growing out since his last stint on the road—out of nervous habit.
Stiles shut his door with a bang, heading back onto the highway. Just a couple more hours, and then he’d be with the guys. He could do this.
They barely spoke beyond those moments, though, with Stiles noticing when his dad’s eyes would linger a little bit longer when he wore short sleeves, and then when he pushed sweater sleeves up, eyes calculating as he catalogued the unspoken changes Stiles was making.
“Get dressed, I’m coming to get you.” Stiles get hear the sound of his dad packing up his things from across the line. “You’ve been in town nearly a damn week and I haven’t seen you since.”
“Yeah, yeah, I heard Dean,” Sam started after taking Dean off of speaker. “No, I am not going to give him the Dean Makeover Experience. You fuckers can do that.” He rolled his eyes, “Yes I’ll come to the show. I’ll bring Jess too. Bye Dean.” A pause, “Yeah, man, I love you too.”
Stiles stayed where he sat, planted on the table, before deciding his next moves. He could ignore Cas and get fucked up, but he knew he had rocked the boat pretty soundly already and if what Jess said was true, he had no idea how much longer they were going to be in town for. He didn’t need to start an all-out war just to get Derek’s attention—he’d save that for the second show, at the very least. The party was alive with a pleasant buzz going through the crowd as he watched, some people getting noisier the more they drank, others vibing to the music while a couple guys tried to recreate the energy that they had felt at the club. Others were tucked away, making out and hooking up in the corners of the room, and Stiles knew Crowley was among them. He was about to give it up, see if he could get a cab to head back to the motel before Erica caught him trying to leave, when he found Derek walking down the stairs, eyes catching each other from across the room.
“You already said, and it’s okay,” Dean said, slowing down his strumming as he looked up at Castiel’s face, not a hint of discomfort in his eyes. “You found my pictures. Would have been weirder if you didn’t go all through the stuff lying around the place, with all that time you were holed up down there.”
“You have got to be kidding,” Castiel was growling, frustration thick in his voice. Dean tiptoed into the den, trying to keep clear of the view from the webcam aimed at where his boyfriend sat on the sofa. As quietly as he could, he slid a plate of pie and a fork across the table toward Castiel, who was glaring at the laptop screen.
Dean finished buttoning the dry shirt onto him in silence. “I’m sorry,” he said then, and Castiel felt even more confused.
Goosebumps erupted up and down Dean’s arms. Reluctantly, he lifted his chin to join Castiel in staring at the ceiling above them. Nothing was there beyond a small spider spinning its web in a corner. Since he was pretty confident that the spider posed no real threat, Dean relaxed his guard a little further.
“Yes, I will accept full responsibility for your ass,” Castiel said. Smirking tiredly, he dropped a kiss onto Dean’s foot, then stepped back and gently let his legs fall. “After we get cleaned up, anyway. Come on, I’ve been jealous of your new shower since I installed it, and now I finally get the chance to try it for myself.”
“Fine,” Dean finally managed. “It’ll be fine. That side of the house isn’t too muddy. It’s on a rise, so the rain ran off and didn’t collect. And I don’t even care about the yard. I just need…they really didn’t tell you anything?”
Doing his best to not show any fear, Dean kept his eyes trained on the stallion as he crept closer to it. It raised its head to watch him cautiously, but it didn’t move. Dean raised a hand to pet it, just like Sam had done, but before he could make contact, it snorted and danced a few steps away.
“Here,” said Dean, shuffling hastily backward on his knees to paw for the flashlight he’d left propped along the wall. Castiel took it and, aiming the beam at an angle into the hole, lowered his upper body to press one side of his face to the wood so he could see as far into the depths as possible. A moment passed in breathless silence, and then Castiel drew in a quick, sharp breath and threw himself away from the gap.
“The pig on steroids or something?” Dean teased, walking down the steps. Lowering his voice to Castiel’s deep baritone, he growled, “‘Not by the five o’clock shadow on my chinny-chin—”
“Probably? I couldn’t have swung an axe with enough force using only one hand, not at that angle.” Castiel seemed unfazed by the thought, and Dean had a moment to wonder at just how badly the situation had messed with this man’s head. “But then I decided that I’d never be able to stop the bleeding and I’d die anyway. I did try to make a tourniquet, which I didn’t really think would do much to keep whatever it was from spreading through my body. I honestly believed I was just dying a really, really long, protracted death. And then I
he told himself. For some reason, his inner voice didn’t sound nearly as convincing anymore. Recalling the look of hurt Castiel had worn when Dean had scolded him, a twinge of remorse squeezed at his heart.
Castiel clenched his fists again, and this time he felt the pain of more raw skin, across both his palms.
that lesbian romances belong in the ‘Women’s Fiction’ category instead of ‘Romance,’ trying to say that they’re of ‘limited interest,’ I’m going to go
Dean immediately made to lunge toward Castiel, dropping to his knees, but the Entity stepped between them before he could get far. When Dean glared, it chuckled and flashed red eyes at him. “You should be thanking me, speck. I could have stood back and let this little adventure be over before it began, you know.”
“I just hadn’t realized it was time for that yet,” Castiel explained, admiring the work. “I guess I’ve been caught up in RUSA work.”
His mistake, probably, had been trusting the online Yelp reviews for the home inspector he’d hired during the negotiations. The website for Spengler Inspections had boasted glowing praise from happy customers, along with a professional-looking design and clearly stated rates and services. One of Dean’s pet peeves was when businesses refused to provide a price tag until you’d committed to signing on the dotted line, so the last factor alone had been a huge one. When Harry Spengler himself had shown up to do the inspection, Dean had realized he was dealing with a one-man shop—not a deal-breaker, but the first of a cascading series of disconcerting revelations that had peaked with Spengler’s shifty request for a cash payment instead of a check.
It was true; the tunnel seemed silent as a tomb. When nobody else seemed to have anything else to contribute, Naomi hefted her flashlight, slapping it against the opposite palm. “Sergeant Campbell,” she said, “get the doors. Everyone else, weapons.”
Unable to keep from grinning, Dean raised his voice to say, “Tell Eileen I’ve still got pinch marks on my ass from the last time I went down there for dance night.”
“Yeah, that’s good. That’ll be fine,” Dean said, desperate to end this phone call. “I gotta go now. The, um, carpet. It’s…leaking.” He had no idea what nonsense was coming out of his mouth anymore, and he didn’t care.
“Give it up, Cas,” Sam called from where he stood beside the Blackhawk that would carry the group to the base. “He was afraid of the little helicopters on poles that the county fair had when we were kids. You’ll never get him on board willingly, so just skip to the coercion and bribery.”
“Dude,” Dean interrupted, warm feelings kindling in his chest despite the stress of the day. Castiel looked so adorably awkward over the misunderstanding that Dean couldn’t help but grow a little more fond of the guy.
“Dean, I don’t understand,” Sam said firmly, stepping back and holding out his hands, palms out in an attempt to calm him. “Are you talking about what we heard all those weeks ago? You can’t know he’s okay. He didn’t say anything that would have—”
“Enough.” With a sharp rap of his knuckles against wood, Dad turned to glare fiercely, his jaw set. “There is absolutely no time to spare, here. Certainly, there is no time for you to babble like an idiot child. I expect you to listen, not ask questions about matters that do not require your understanding.”
“I’m hoping so, at any rate. Jimmy was the last one to use my gear, for a work retreat a while back, and I haven’t checked the box since then. He put it back up there himself when he got back, apparently by tossing it like he was making a free throw.”
Brow furrowed, Dean blinked away the sleep from his eyes, squinting at the screen on his phone where it lay on his bedside table. The time it showed had him frowning even more deeply in puzzlement. “Cas?” he croaked hoarsely. There was no response, other than the distant growl of another thunderclap and the patter of rain on the window glass.
Dean, for his part, was starting to feel a little antsy, after being basically bed-ridden so long, but the experience really had done a number on him; simply sitting up for too long left him feeling drained. It was frustrating, but he knew how lucky he was, how badly things might have gone. He’d had more than a few nightmares in which Claire had gotten hurt or lost while he’d lain helplessly in the mud, unable to do anything but shout and writhe, and he’d woken from those horrific visions in pools of sweat and with hoarse cries still tearing from his throat. Castiel had held him tightly every time, stroking his hair and murmuring reassurances that both he and Claire were safe.
“Uh-huh.” The pipes hadn’t felt so heavy when Charlie had pushed him into the middle of the room and thrust them into his hands. She seemed oblivious to the strain in his face, caught up in her own little world where the only thing better than a little information was a little more information than anyone else had. It wasn't that Dean really believed that Charlie had been some sort of CIA operative back when there had been a CIA, but then again, he was pretty sure that if she hadn't been on their payroll, it was because she was on another of their lists.
“Yeah, me too.” Dean trailed his fingers along Castiel’s arm as drowsiness began tugging his eyelids downward. “Just sayin’.”
After a startled jerk of his legs at being caught off-guard, Castiel huffed a dry laugh. “Your consideration for decorum is noted,” he said, easing his way cautiously out of the hole in the ceiling. His feet searched blindly for the top of the ladder, and Dean quickly reached to grab them and guide them to the step. “Thank you,” Castiel sighed as he emerged, dragging a cardboard box along with him.
Biting his lip, Dean tried for an innocent grin. “You don’t think this place could use a cool as hell basement game room?”
“I mean, I’ve still got a lot I want to do,” he protested. “Like…I need to hang curtains or blinds or something, or I’ll be flashing my neighbors every time I take a shower. And furniture, of course. My apartment was mostly furnished, and what I bought myself wouldn’t be enough to fill one of the rooms in this place. I don’t even own a decent dinner table.”
, over and over. You deserved so much better than what you got. And, dammit, I should have been there for you, even if all I could do was help pick up the pieces. Telling you I’m sorry…I want to kick myself, just hearing myself say it. ‘Sorry’ doesn’t do jack shit. But I swear, Cas, I’m going to make it better. I’m going to find a way to make it up to you, no matter what.”
“You’ve got Kevin guiding you when you do the routine perimeter range sweep next week,” Charlie proposed. “I’ve seen him mooning over Channing, one of the group that stumbled in from their college up north a while back. If I bring her with me to the comms shack while you’re out there, maybe to carry some things for me, he’d probably be plenty distracted.”
appealing.” Leaning forward, he applied the tip of his tongue to a particularly large mass of freckles, tracing in circles as his eyelashes fluttered shut and he groaned.
“Anyway, I don’t wanna tell you how to do your job. You need to flick on the lights, go for it. I’m just playing it extra safe. The main reason I really called was the foundation—found a big crack in one part of the floor, and I’m nervous,” Dean said. Again, he was unable to keep himself from glancing over his shoulder at the office when he spoke, and worry had him biting his lip. “And since I was calling anyway, I figured the best thing was to have you go over all the rest of it and pick up on anything else I might have missed.”
“So…is that…an easy fix?” he asked, afraid to hear the answer. Castiel started laughing harder, though Dean couldn’t tell whether it was at the situation or just at him, personally. “Fuck,” he said, too defeated to protest. Making a fist, he thumped the wall over the sink, then did it again, harder, because it felt appropriate. With the second thump, the medicine cabinet on the wall shifted a fraction, and Dean had a frightening vision of it falling with a crash into the sink, sending shards of broken mirror everywhere. Not that his luck could get much worse, but he made a grab to catch it anyway. Castiel, seeing the movement, hastily scooted backward out of the potential danger zone.
he shouted. Remembering where he was, he found himself waiting for the inevitable maternal reprimand over his language, but none came. Actually, come to that point, where was Mom? Surely, she would have heard the Emergency Alert, even if she hadn’t been concerned about the sounds of the gunshots, the screaming, the howling, and, newly added to the cacophony, the rising wail of sirens in the distance.
“Don’t forget to count!” Sam quickly reminded Dean as he was shuffling ahead. Mentally slapping himself for almost forgetting Dad’s last-ditch security defense against intruders, Dean moved back toward the tunnel mouth and started again, this time counting off his paces carefully as he moved.
. So he reveals himself, and burns her eyes out in the process. Eight halos, each ablaze with the intensity of a galaxy, will do that.
Todd County, Kentucky isn’t exactly the highlight of gay nightlife, and it’s only gotten worse over the years, so when the hottest guy he’s ever seen walks into his bar, which happens to be the one gay bar in a fifty mile radius, well, Cole figures he kinda has to shoot his shot.
Castiel pulled Dean’s underwear back over his ass, and God must have really had it out for Dean that day, because this guy had the nerve to say, “I hope I made your first time very special.”
“Do you prefer lemon verbena or vanilla rose?” Castiel asked, turning around to show Dean two bottles of oil, both bottles declaring that they were to be used post-waxing.
“Looks like your kid’s a regular Snow White. You’d want a picture of that, right? I’m gonna take a picture.” He snaps one on his phone quickly, and then goes back to watering the alliums. He’s in a good mood today, better than he’s been since the funeral pyre.
Dean hesitated. What do guys like? Fuck, he should’ve asked Lisa what her new boyfriend’s favorite Bath and Body Works smell is before coming in. “Lemon verbena works,” he said, figuring that roses would be too girly.
bring up with his therapist, is watching his husband get eye-fucked by every damn vendor at this stupid farmers’ market.
distressing stray lines of thinking that he’s had since bringing Dean back to life. And it’s why he hesitates and throws a few lightning bolts their way before he reveals himself.
“Screw you,” Dean replied. “I swear to God, or whoever, I’m going to put my fist in that mouth, no matter whose face you’re wearing.”
Adjusting their course south slightly, they kept moving, chuckling more quietly. As much hassle as it had been to haul the three young goats back to camp all those months ago, it had been more than worth the effort they’d expended in chasing down the creatures, roping their legs together (after finding out the hard way how hard those little hooves could kick), and traipsing several miles through the woods carrying them. The looks of shock on Bobby’s and Major Naomi’s faces when they’d reached the gate, the largest of the three goats draped over Sam’s shoulders and the two smaller kids under Dean’s arms, had been priceless.
Dean sagged, letting his legs drop as Castiel practically fell on top of him, kissing him to within an inch of his life. Panting hard, Castiel gasped into his mouth, nearly slurring his words as he tried to speak. “I have to…can I please…”
Benny lifted an eyebrow, studying Castiel, before turning back to Dean. “What’s up with the angel? He for real?”
“Something she wants back,” the Entity said slowly. “Something you want back, I think. You lot manage to grow more astoundingly irritating by the day. ‘Let me go!’ ‘Let him go!’ My home is not meant to be a vacation spot. No round-trip tickets.”
” The scorching heat of Castiel’s tongue felt like it was burning straight through the thin barrier, setting every nerve on fire as he licked in tiny circles around Dean’s hole. The back of Dean’s head hit the crate with an audible thunk, and there was probably going to be a lump there later, but he wouldn’t have cared even if he’d concussed himself. Grabbing at the backs of his thighs, he shamelessly tried to bare himself further, wanting even more.
“Well, good thing you’re not wearing a red cloak,” Dean retorted. Grimacing in anticipation of the effort, he hefted Claire back up and onto his hip before making his way into the trees. It was only marginally cooler out of the sun, but at least it was something. Dropping Claire to the ground again, he braced his back against a nearby tree and sighed as he tried to scratch at his leg.
Castiel, uttering a string of profanity that Dean honestly found damn impressive, spun around and made a rough grab for his phone, which sat on a pile of boxes nearby. “Gabriel, what could you possibly have to say that I want to hear right now?” he snapped into the speaker the moment he answered, without even a hello. His face was positively thunderous to start, but it somehow managed to grow even more intimidatingly fierce as he listened to whatever was being said.
Instead of heading back toward the dormitories or to the greenhouses that had fascinated him from his first glance, he made his way around the side of Naomi’s office building, ducking behind a corner so that he could hear anyone approaching without being seen. He felt a little ridiculous, lurking in the shadows like a child playing hide-and-seek, but he wasn’t the one who’d chosen this game. He’d be the one who won, though. She’d have to come back eventually.
“Thanks,” Sam said, tilting his head back and forth to stretch sore neck muscles. “God, I’m beat. Longest freaking run in a while. If anybody tries to stand between me and the showers when we get back, I’m going through them.”
“More with me than for me, you know?” he said with a shrug, still halfheartedly reaching for the phone.
Dean pointed a threatening finger at her, then fled as quickly as he could manage without actually running.
They were in what had been a living room, the contents utterly demolished in the violent struggles that had preceded the deaths of the former residents. One cracked and broken sliding glass door led out onto a grass patch; it was partially covered by wooden planks that had apparently once been bookshelves. The family had obviously been in the process of trying to barricade their home, but it hadn’t been enough. The team gathered around the broken boards, peering out into the yard. Directly ahead was a large gray building.
of this,” he said. “You have no idea what he would put me through if he knew about this scheme. If you thought he was bad today, you severely underestimate how unbearable he can be when he puts effort into it.”
“Not remotely what I’m getting at,” Sam interrupted, “and I know. Surgery on four impacted wisdom teeth, Dean. You were a little occupied that week.”
“I’m not about to authorize human testing like Dad and Benton were doing,” she said firmly. “And we have nothing like the equipment they had at Leavenworth to try to figure out what’s in them through experimentation. For all we know, whatever is in there is what kicked off this whole disaster.”
Dean was raging at nothing, spinning on his heel to shout into the inky void in every direction. If there had been anything to throw, it would have long since crashed against a wall. Of course, walls were also not something currently available. Dean’s fists clenched, acutely regretting the lack of anything in the Empty that he could hit.
“Anyway, the military files were all pretty well backed-up, of course, and they made all their databases a priority for if the shit ever hit the fan, which it did, and God only knows how much cultural history is gone forever, but we’ll always have the knowledge that Private So-and-so got dishonorably discharged for going AWOL when their back-home girlfriend broke up with them. But the major’s files were actually really heartbreaking. Her whole family, pretty much, got killed right in front of her—dad, mom, brother. Her other brother was stationed down in Texas—they’re all army—and he got killed, too, a day or so later.” Tossing the multitool onto the tarp beside her, Charlie wiped her hands on her pants and pursed her lips to blow her bangs off of her forehead.
point, but he let it pass as Castiel railroaded on. “The cat urine saturated the carpet, which I can see from the glue layer that you’ve removed, but it was left to permeate the concrete subfloor. There may be
“Here,” said Amelia, handing over a tin mug that steamed. “Bacon and egg sandwiches, too. Better get your energy up—you’ll need it.”
“Okay, not going to—to argue with any of that,” Dean struggled to say. “Gotta tell you though, man. You’ve either got the world’s worst game or the best poker face I’ve ever seen.”
He knew she’d never call it quits if he was determined to keep trying. On the other hand, he knew what she was like with a puzzle in her hand, and he wondered how he was supposed to keep her grounded when he was starting to realize he was starting to grow rather obsessed himself.
Castiel glared sternly. “I do not intend for this to be over inside of fifteen minutes,” he growled. “Lift your legs.”
Shit. “If I have splinters in my backside, Cas, you’re helping me pick them out,” Dean warned. He couldn’t wipe the smile from his face, though.
Dean grimaced in acknowledgment. “Great. Love being the first person on a trail in the morning, so you get to discover all the spider web booby traps with your face.”
Castiel’s scent, masked somewhat by the bug lotion, had been edged with worry before that point, but now hurt filtered through it. “You know that’s not what I meant,” he said. “Of course, I know you don’t need my help. You’ve just seemed maybe a little run down this morning, and I thought it might be better not to have to carry Claire the whole way—”
The next time he woke up, it was to his phone vibrating on his chest. He groaned, accepting the call with barely a glance.
(Everyone swore they deleted the video evidence from the last New Years party, but Stiles had a feeling Erica was lying)
Just as August was starting, they had traveled back down to Louisiana, the heat of the summer making Stiles sweat even with the jeep’s air conditioning blasting. He had learned some towns and venues were the equivalent of a one-night stand for the guys, and then there were other venues that expected them back as naturally as the seasons changed. Down in Louisiana, where Dean’s buddy Benny lived, was one of those places. Several venues coordinated a gig schedule with Jess months in advance, and sometimes Stiles wondered if they booked the rest of their shows and travel plans around those ones.
Stiles leaned against the side of the club, taking hits off of the second to last joint from his emergency stash, grinning when he caught the eye of some guys walking out. Besides enjoying the hell out of their gigs, that was one thing Stiles wouldn’t deny about living on the road: the amount of attention he got from nameless strangers, getting to enjoy their company as a stranger himself, always sent a thrill down his spine. He was about to make a proposition to one of the guys, whose eyes lingered longer than his friends, when Castiel joined him.
“Hey, Stiles,” Sam’s voice called out. Stiles walked out of his room to see Sam standing in the doorway, large package in his hands and the sound of the delivery truck’s engine starting heard distantly from behind the closing front door. They had just gotten back from spending winter break down in Louisiana, Stiles’ hair a brighter hue of the aquamarine he had tried out over the summer. This time around, Jess helped him bleach the ends first.
“I think that may have been the most moving version of that song that I’ve ever heard,” he commented once he was finished. “Seriously, Dean, where did that come from? You never cease to amaze.”
Years of stubborn pride seemed to clog his throat, refusing to let the truth come pouring out. Dean gritted his teeth, pushing his free hand into his hair and gripping it, yanking hard enough to make his scalp sting.
“You could be right about that. God knows, there are folks here in camp that, if we’d met each other back when we’d have been just regular people who worked together or lived on the same street, I’d have been hard-pressed to give them the time of day. And then there’s those of us who just don’t have the first thing in common. Little Krissy, for one—looks like she could still be selling Girl Scout Cookies if you squint, and comes back from thrift shop raids with tapes of
“Well, it took you long enough, but I have to hand it to you. It’s one hell of a housewarming party.” Sam angled his drink toward Dean in a salute, and Dean met it with his own, clinking the bottle neatly before tipping it back and pulling a long swallow from it.
