“Interesting,” Sherlock said as he followed John upstairs. “Where should I put these?” he asked once they got inside the flat.
Sherlock smiled. “You’ve not told anyone, have you?” he asked.
And what kind of drastic thing would he do anyway? The thought that he would plan something at all took him by surprise. He shifted again and punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape. He wasn't going to do anything. He was going to sleep and keep his mouth shut and everything would go back to normal when Sherlock got back.
He groaned and got out of bed, grabbing his dressing gown before padding down. "Sherlock? What's happening? Why are you yelling?"
“Yes,” Sherlock said quickly then realised that lying was not good or necessary. “I am now -- I got checked when I got back. I’m all right, just . . . sore.”
"Fuck," John moaned, his back arching as he tried to keep his hips still. His hand slid into Sherlock's hair.
“I just mean -- we’re not going to university together,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock stood up and pushed John out of the way, shouting, “Everything here is mine because this is my desk! Start somewhere else if your urge to fix things is eating away at you because you’re not at the surgery!” he shouted.
"You go make it," John said, pushing him lightly.
John sipped his tea and shrugged. "Too late," he smiled.
Sherlock came over immediately. "Is she all right?" he asked.
"I mean it," he said calmly. "Because I love him -- you were right."
Sherlock felt relieved by that answer, but he did his best to hide it.
Sherlock watched the show and was soon making complaints about the poor police procedures and the bad acting skills of all involved. After fifteen minutes, he said, “Have you figured out who did it yet?”
"Why did you keep talking to me?" John asked.
“Will you come with me tomorrow?” Sherlock asked tentatively. “I want to go see the other bodies . . . I could use your medical expertise.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Mycroft said. “I said no work -- or have you forgotten already?”
John nodded. He stared at his letter and added his free days, suggesting all the different things they could do when John came to visit, especially if he had his mum drop him off for a whole weekend. That would be perfect -- they could properly catch up. He knew two days wouldn't be enough, but it would be a good start.
"Did you notice that, as soon as you got in, I no longer existed? When he got his phone call, he apologized to
too, but that’s another topic.Then this jerk started to follow me when I was going out, without me noticing it, of course. Anyway, when he understood I had different penchants and that I wasn’t the kind to bother with vanilla sex, he started to ask me so many questions about dom and subs, what is okay to do and what is not… That’s how I teached him about BDSM. It was purely theoretical. We spent months like this. I think that’s what got him to gain interest on crimes of passion and started to understand the mechanic of the sentiments. And one night, the theory went out of control and he told me he wanted to practice. We thought it would work, me as his Dom and him as my Sub, and…”
"Oh! Look at his sardonic smile. He blames me for being shot at. He's quite susceptible, isn't he?" Moriarty laughs, hiding his hands in his coat pockets.
"I come to see Sherlock."
It's a simple gesture, but Sherlock smiles and it's almost the most beautiful reward of the evening. He slightly stretches his right shoulder before surrounding John's cock with his fingers. With slow movements, he's discovering his member along the entire length until his thumb slides across the tip he's covering with all the precome he can find. Once, then twice, before all the fingers close around the hot and heavy glans. There's only the ragged breath of John which is invading the room, illuminated by a single bedside lamp for which he has so many contradictory feelings. He wants to turn it off, of course, because he's not used to seeing something when he's sleeping with somebody, but he also wants it so much stronger so that he can see the entirety of Sherlock's face. Now, John can only see his eyes, bright as spotlights which are burning his retinas while attracting him at the same time. Gosh, how John's feeling like a stupid mosquito right now.
"Of course he has never heard about me, he does not read newspapers - except those that tell of sports or automobile events. He is trying to become enlightened, judging from the fact that he accepted the tickets his boss didn't want. New relationship? No, seen the state of your teeth and the rest of kebab which is lying on your seat; it is obvious that you do not take care of yourself to please others. Searching for a new job? Who would hire you..." Sherlock laughs before starting again more seriously, "Your ring finger still carries the mark - slightly visible, I admit - of a wedding ring... Divorced, then. Oh, that's
"Sherlock," he calls, shyly raising a hand to try to have at least his visual attention, because it's likely that his voice will get lost in the melody which is invading the Royal Hall Festival with all its fanciful innocence.
- porn movies staging you?"
file, and the
, when he wants it? You don't live in the same world as us, John. Sherlock and I don't play this game, the game of… feelings," Mycroft drops with a voice much less controlled than usual and, for the first time, John feels like he faces a human being.
"Did you find out what you are controlled by?"
The doctor turns off his mobile and sighs out loud. The discussion has almost slipped over the subject he's been trying to avoid the last few days - especially since Sherlock had almost kissed him - and John doesn't really feel at ease with the idea of speaking about it. He mentally shakes himself to keep silent the small shiver which browses his muscles and approaches room n°108. Even from where he is he can hear his sister's voice, which means that either someone entered the bedroom or the alcohol has finally broken her mental health. It would be easier if it's the second option. John slowly pushes the poorly closed door open and the person that he sees almost makes him jump with surprise.
"Given the size of your jumpers, you have your chances."
John just shrugs by lowering the corners of his lips, a grimace which means more '
"John, we are going to search Philipp Sherrer's apartment and we are going to find what he hides from us. Mycroft, give me three days to resolve this case, three days, otherwise I'll leave it up to you. And John, bring your toolkit. I already have your weapon with me."
John turns the key once in the creaking lock and trots, more than he walks, to the reception desk where he puts down his keys, like every time he works at the clinic. He smiles at the receptionist, slides the pad where he noted his appointments (even the cancelled ones) on the counter, and doesn't turn his head before passing by the double glass door. Lately, the desire to meet Barrow is as attractive as putting his hand under a lawn mower.
"To support my husband. And I love Listz."
He sighs, tells the brown-haired man to wait, and quickly drops out by turning his back on them in front of the window.
"Truth," John said.
Lestrade came over. “John, you all right?” he asked.
John tugged him close and pressed into him, hugging him tightly. "I love you too. I don't want to lose you again."
“Good,” Sherlock said. “I don’t plan to go out with anyone else either.”
Sherlock was lying on his bed, holding a book he’d hoped would distract him from his frustration, both about the case and about John. “Come in,” he said, pushing himself to sit up.
Sherlock got up to join John in the kitchen. His legs felt a little wobbly from being at the desk for so long. Last night when John was out, Sherlock had wanted to talk this through with him in an attempt to find something. In truth now, though, after so many more hours of fruitless research, he felt even more defeated.
"I thought so. We have before, I think."
“Good, so that means you must be very clever as well.”
“I haven’t had a sleepover since that last night. I guess we’re going to make up for it with this trip,” Sherlock said with a smile. “Do you still fart all night?”
The next morning John went to work and asked for a half day. At lunch he would go back to his flat, finish up his packing ,and then head over to Sherlock's. He was still a bit weary about this idea. Somehow it would be easier if Sherlock was a complete stranger, but he wasn’t. Not really. He didn't know what to think or feel about it all.
“It’s just sore,” Sherlock said. “I’m sorry.” He slid closer, tangling their legs a little. “Don’t move away.”
Sherlock waited until he heard the water start and then got up from his seat, going upstairs and standing outside the spare bedroom. He looked inside. The room did not look very different. John’s empty bags were on the bed, there was a book on the bedside table. He stepped in and glanced at the book’s cover. Treasure Island. Odd choice. He went back downstairs, sitting at his desk and opening his laptop to check in with Scotland Yard.
“I’m aware,” he said.
“Everything is normal,” Sherlock said. “Right?” he asked.
John blinked at him. "You came up with something already?"
John put money on the table. "Yes, I'll call you." He hurried out of the restaurant and hailed a cab.
“No, I promise we will be right here in the garden.”
“Well, maybe we should just try to stay away from each other,” Sherlock said, fully aware that was impossible to last long. “What are you going to do for the rest of the day? Just bang things around and talk the entire time?”
John dragged his fingers over Sherlock's nipples, grinning at the sigh and soft moan. "You also stood close enough to press your arm against me while you explained your train of thought."
“I’m just out,” Sherlock said, shrugging as well. “How did you know I’d be here?”
“See? You just can’t stop!” Sherlock said, stuffing a whole biscuit into his mouth and left the room, returning with the wine glasses and bottle. “If I can’t have cigarettes . . .” he said, pouring a little wine into each glass.
“Whatever you want,” Sherlock said. “I can help, if you need me to. Or you can do it on your own – you always do such an excellent job,” he added, giving John a stupid smile.
“We are most definitely not fighting!” John called, laughing a little.  He draped a leg over Sherlock and whispered, “Get rid of him.”
“How was the interview?” Sherlock called, but John was out the door. He climbed the rest of the stairs and went into the flat.
"Intriguing," Sherlock said. "You're obligated to tell me the lie now."
"Whatever it takes, you know? We'll see how things move along."
Sherlock wasn’t sure what Molly was referring to -- was John also a detective? That’s when he realised he didn’t even know John’s work was. What had he been thinking shagging a complete stranger? Actually, at this point, Molly’s comment made him feel a little bit better. Whatever connection she imagined, perhaps that’s what made their tryst all right.
John splashed Sherlock's back and swam away towards the shore.
Sherlock helped his parents carry their bags out to the car. "Are you going for a month?" he asked as he climbed into the car.
“We work together on projects and then compete against other schools,” she said. She reached into her desk and pulled out some papers. “Here, you can read about it and tell me next week.”
“But you’re not reading anything,” Jim said.
In the taxi, Sherlock sat quietly for a few minutes. “Perhaps no kissing while we’re working,” he said.
“If you have a nightmare, I could come up and . . . lie by you if you’d like,” Sherlock said quietly. “Like you wanted to earlier.”
“You wanted it to be easier, didn’t you?” she asked. “Coming back -- you were hoping everything would be the same.”
“They do not,” Mycroft said. “And there’s no reason they need to, is there?”
“Is this someone’s lost dog or are you checking on a cheating husband?”
John shook his head. "I don't think so. I'm not that picky, you know?" He realised that sounded stupid, especially to Sherlock who watched him come home from many failed dates.
Sherlock's initial thought was relief that John's issue had nothing to do with him before realising it had everything to do with him. "I don't think that's a good idea, John," he said, glancing up at the window. He was a bit curious but not enough to open the flat to someone else.
John found a fancy restaurant on his phone. After they cashed the ticket they went to dinner, getting an expensive bottle of wine. They talked about Sherlock and the flat and John’s search for work. Mrs Hudson talked about her own dating drama and told John stories about her ex-husband.
"Seems like it," he said.
“Why don’t you move in and send this grump to your house?” she said. “Sherlock, did you tell John all about your school?”
John watched him go, smiling at Mrs. Hudson. " You can choose anything you’d like to do. I'm not picky," he told her.
"Yeah, I liked what we did, too," John said.
John flushed and crossed his arms. "I'm not a prude! I'm just not . . . we are friends. Colleagues. We're not . . . it's not like that between us." He forced himself not to think about what Sherlock just said. This was just Sherlock stubbornly messing with him to make him squirm.
"But you'd consider it with me?"
"M'close," John moaned, his hips and breathing both becoming a bit more erratic.
Sherlock turned a little to see the film, which also gave him an excuse to curl around John. He slid his hand over John's waist and held him. He looked over the film, which was one of his favourites. "Hope you like the film," he said.
Sherlock laughed aloud. “I knew this was coming from Day One,” he said, lightly pinching John’s side.
Sherlock brought two bowls over to the table. “Here,” he said. He sat down next to John.
“Your food all right?” Sherlock said. “Maybe we could go out tomorrow -- if you’re back in time, I mean. If not, the next day. Or whenever.”
“Interesting. . .” Sherlock said. “Let me know if that changes. Are you going to be making breakfast? I don’t want any, but I wouldn’t mind a cup of tea.”
John looked over. It was the guy from the bar. "Hi."
Sherlock steeled himself -- he was going to have to have a conversation with her. "What do you mean? The milk's here," he said, holding up the bottle.
John straddled Sherlock's legs and sat in his lap, slowly opening the buttons on Sherlock's shirt. "Like . . . the way you were staring at me instead of Greg when he was talking to you about the arrest."
The odd question -- and rather the odd moment for it -- didn't quite register with John. His brain was clouded with pleasure. Everything about Sherlock felt incredible. He nodded, huffing a 'yes' into Sherlock's jaw before kissing his way to his mouth.
. -JW
John got ready for bed and set his alarm, wondering about Sherlock. This drugs case seemed to have thrown him off a bit so it would be good if a simple case turned up to keep him busy.
Instead of making another cup of tea, Sherlock turned and said to John. “Are you going to eat? You haven’t eaten anything since you got home.”
"Sure, why not," John said. He pushed up his sleeves and watched Sherlock pour the drinks.
"Okay," John said. "I suppose that'll be okay."
"I didn't think you were interested in this sort of thing."
"That's not helping," he told Sherlock over his shoulder.
That piqued Sherlock's interest. "What things do you have to say to me?" he asked.
Sherlock sat back a little. “Are you all right though -- honestly?” he asked.
“Well, what’s wrong with you then?”
“I need to speak with him,” Sherlock said.
“Whatever,” Sherlock said. He shifted on the bed away from John a little. “I’m going to hate this, aren’t I?”
John had made a decision: he was going to study medicine. It seemed exciting, a fast paced job that would never be boring. He signed up for a program to shadow a surgeon for a day, and he learned about a specialty he fell in love with -- trauma surgeon. His mind was set on it, though it meant many years of study. Some of his classmates were going into the military -- the thought of it made John nervous, but it would him learn and pay for his education. His mum didn't like it at all, but she couldn't stop him from signing up. He had a clear view of his future.
In the morning, Sherlock heard John moving about the flat and came out.
"Oh. Well, that's a relief. I'll tell Matt he can stop hiding," John joked.
“I don’t think anything’s broken,” Sherlock said. “John can help with everything else.”
“We’re strengthening our partnership,” Sherlock said and he and John both laughed like neither had for days.
"Whatever you want to watch is fine," Sherlock said. "I'm sure I'll find something wrong with it."
“Oh, I understand now,” Sherlock said. “It’s a person.”
Eventually he made himself a cup of tea. When he heard a car outside, he got up. The door opened and Mycroft came in.
"Because you're still handsome," he said. "And more interesting and mysterious than I thought. I want to know more."
Sherlock stared at the message. John really didn’t know. So why was he so quick to get back to normal if his business partner -- his friend -- was dead? Sherlock had assured there was money for the flat so it couldn’t be that. He didn’t know what to think. So he wrote.
“All right,” Sherlock said. “Will you call?” he asked his mum.
"Okay. Me too," John said. He wasn’t quite sure what Sherlock meant, but it seemed to have passed.
He didn’t pick up his phone until he was already under the covers with the lights out. He was relieved to see John’s apology, but the feeling of unease didn’t quite leave him. He wished he was still at home and everything was as it had been. Or maybe he wished John was here, even though that didn’t really make sense to him just yet.
It felt good to Sherlock, but he was afraid to acknowledge it. He was trying to make it all make sense in his head. “But . . . what about . . . everything . . . ?” he asked.
“Help yourself,” Sherlock said. “Can I put the kettle on while you do?”
“No,” Sherlock said.
“Sherlock --”
“Sometimes,” Sherlock said. “Are you saying I need one?”
"I don't think we need anything right now. You can start making a list though, we can go when it's full of necessary things."
John fought rolling his eyes and waited for her to go on.
"Yes, it's--" Sherlock started and then noticed Harry coming down so he stopped. He moved into the sitting room to speak to her. "Favours have been pulled, so I need to know that you are committed to this," he said.
“Whatever it is, it’s something I don’t understand,” Sherlock said. “Don’t forget -- I’m just the boy who likes adventures. You’re the intelligent wizard who knows all about the mysterious things.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. He really hadn't had many flatmates -- he had his own room when he was a child but he did share with a few people in college. John was his flatmate, of course, but he also felt like more than that. He thought for a few more minutes and then took a drink. "My turn," he said. "I have never lied to you -- except for the few times, which you know about and which I've apologized for so we don't need to go into all that again."
They walked through the halls, and then he pushed through the doors. “The suicides, please,” he said to Molly.
"I was thinking of getting a job,” John said. He paused before suggesting, “Maybe we could do something together.”
Sherlock looked over. “No, I won’t be going out tonight,” he said. “Why? Are you keeping information to yourself? Don’t do that, John. We work together, don’t forget.”
“Wrong,” Sherlock said. “You were here to witness my brilliance -- that’s the most important part.” He stuck his tongue out.
“Well, yes, there’s that,” she said. “But it’s good for you too. You’re different since he’s been here.”
By the time the bath water had cooled, Sherlock felt clear on everything that had been confusing him about John -- from the moment they’d met until tonight’s little explosion. He got himself dried and dressed and went out to the kitchen. He poured himself a small glass of wine, sat down on the sofa and took a deep breath.
John's phone buzzed in his pocket, and his heart sped up even more. They looked over at him. Amanda came over and pulled the phone from his pocket. “It’s your boyfriend,” she said sarcastically.
Mrs Hudson looked at Sherlock. “Are you sure this is a good idea?” she asked.
John smiled. "Dare."
Just then his phone vibrated in his pocket.
News about the virus was all over every page he clicked. How had he missed this? He grabbed his phone and sent a text to his brother.
John shifted under the covers and turned on his side. "Good night, Sherlock."
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. “I do intend to keep drinking, though, so I recognise that I should have some food in my stomach at some point.”
“Her reaction?”
Sherlock laughed aloud and rolled on top of John. “Cheeky,” he said, putting a wet kiss on John’s mouth. “At least now I finally get the benefit.”
“What? Flirt with men and then pull someone else in to your little game?” Sherlock asked. “Do you two have some kind of scam going? Because I should tell you that I occasionally work with the police.”
John swallowed hard. "I -- I'm sorry," John said quietly. "I'm going to go . . . just out to get some food for us," he added.
John kept looking out of his own window as he shrugged. Having faced Sherlock's annoyance the last week, he wasn't going to willingly take more. Greg could take this one. "Don't know."
Slowly, inch by inch, the detective turns around, with his chin low and his eyes focused on the doctor. His face expresses nothing, but Sherlock Holmes just has to be himself for John to feel exposed.
"John!" exclaims Mrs. Hudson, coming out of her kitchen, drying her hands with a green rag. "I thought that you would come back earlier," she blames him, turning her watch on her fine wrist, on which is displayed 7:12 pm.
Sherlock's hand releases the fair hair and forces it in front of his mouth as he orders:
Sherlock's left eyebrow slowly raises and, even if this conversation doesn't have much to do with this suicide story or Moriarty, John wants to talk about it:
again. Then he wished
It’s like Christmas Eve because there’s so close that John has the feeling their body could merge. It comes from the bottom of his soul, his lips feel so naked he only wants to dress them with Sherlock’s kisses, his mouth, his tongue and words. He wets his lips by reflex and the way the detective’s eyes are devouring him echoes his own desire.
But it's Christmas, so everybody is making an effort. This time, it's the dean who makes the ultimate sacrifice by not respecting the traditions. That will please Sherlock, who hates what is classic, and Mrs. Hudson adores to please Sherlock. She slowly stirs her immense wooden spoon in the sauce, which she's been simmering since the beginning of the afternoon, when the DI arrives in the kitchen.
"Liar," replies Sherlock without waiting.
“Wait…” John suddenly asks, hunched forward to catch his breath.
Sherlock opens his eyes, the stars are way too big, bigger than in London. They burn his retinas.
John shakes his head in spite of him, his teeth molding his lower lip and no, they're not going to fuck here, not in the bedroom of a dead man of whom they have been investigating (and failing, also) the murder of, for months; not among the pictures of a life which stopped in front of hundreds of witnesses, not in the middle of stupid letters and ridiculous costumes, John is sure, absolutely sure,
"What?" asks the detective.
11:18 PM
Maybe because he's too tired to face all this.
"Okay, if it's a joke because of what happened yesterday with Elisa, it's really lame."
"Was one of them seated behind the orchestra?"
"Oh my God," spat John when the door had definitely closed behind the object of all their nightmares.
"Something happened."
Unless that's precisely what you're implying. -J
"Mycroft, listen, I…"
06:18 PM
"In yellow, we and the ballistics' team highlighted the seats from where the shot might have been fired; seats 43, 44A, 43, 42B, 43, 42, 41 C or 37, 38 D."
"I heard that you are finally on the track of the musician's murderer – well, suicide I should say."
"Good. Now, we are really going to talk. I am going to ask you several questions and you will answer them honestly. Do you understand, John? I forbid you to act rude and rough - and do not pull a face, you may laugh at my ego but yours can completely compete in terms of size."
It's so evident Sherlock wonders why he said it out loud, but judging by the look on the doctor's face, it's a good thing he did: it didn't seem clear to everyone. His roommate's lips open again, but he closes them before turning his face. He'll not talk for a while.
"Which is common in this kind of well-to-do family."
Shit, how to hide something from Holmes? John takes advantage that his flatmate is coldly analysing the cashier who has obviously no problem revealing her glottis at the same time as her chewing gum, but the DI immediately sends him an excuse:
John has a half-smile. He unconsciously moves his ankles closer, tightens his fists and lowers his chin before going in the office as if he's entering the battlefield. Doris has already turned her head, without even moving one blond hair of her impeccable blow-dry. Her eyebrows are so well depilated that they seem to be drawn on her skin and her plump cheeks are enlightened by small touches of make-up. She has two thick golden earrings and a sea-green jumper in answer to the color of her eyes. On her right is her son, Benjamin, 19 years old. Wrapped in a red jumper, he's looking at John with his small almond eyes, a polite smile on his lips. He has the same plump cheeks as his mom and the same softness in the gaze. His hair of a dark brown proves to John that of Doris is extremely colored.
You never answered me, btw. -J
They raise their glasses a bit higher, singing with the same cheerful voice '
Steele tightens and all the colour he has gotten back in his face is fading already. Oh, John hates these moments here - and they arrive at every case - it's like he's going through jet lag, as if Sherlock is in another time zone, because he understands everything in advance while John waits, slow on the uptake, to perceive only an inch of the truth. It reminds him of his childhood, when the Battermore in front of his house had a video-recorder while his parents didn't even want to emit the possibility of buying one. He clenches his teeth, looks more at Sherlock than at Steele (because it's clear that the information is going to arrive from his friend) and keeps his fists on his knees under the table.
John retorts, without any subtlety.
"Okay I really need to go now. I don't want to be late in front of a Helvetic delegate."
"Sherlock..." laughs John, "You are telling me that Greg is actually in love. And even if you seem to like Elisa a lot, I have the impression that you are jealous that somebody nicked your friend."
"A witness told us he saw a woman with a man, rather small and quite chubby, who left quickly after the shot."
"Amusing, the way you compare having an intimate relationship with a potentially deadly activity," Sherlock quietly smiles.
John raises his hand heavy by the plaster and holds against him Sherlock's body. They're holding each other, kiss and murmur words without distinguishing the difference. Sherlock's lips kisse him like a soft rain. Each breathing which is reverberating on his skin murmurs to John's soul all this adoration that unites them, everything that made they become what they are together. Everything that Moriarty hasn't understood.
Sherlock was unlocking the door, but he turned back to look at John. “Really?” he asked. He turned to step into the flat. “We both know that’s not true. You don’t have to tell me why, I suppose, but don’t lie to me about something I can see with my own eyes.”
“And . . ?”
Sherlock had not been awake long enough to deal with this. “I don’t smoke in the flat,” he mumbled. “But if you insist, I will.” He slipped his coat off, keeping his cigarette packet with him. “Why are you being so controlling today?” he asked.
In the wetness of the kiss, their tongues are melting one against the other. Sherlock's fingers anchored on the doctor's jaw will leave marks for sure. He presses them against the hollow of the cheeks to keep John's mouth open, as if he's afraid that John will stop the kiss. The doctor's heart will soon break, it's a sure thing based on the knocks it gives against his rib cage, but the idea that his last breath could be pushed into Sherlock's mouth comforts him more than it frightens him.
He moves in the room, puts the twentyish magazines he bought on the bedside table and greets Elisa with a smile before he kisses John on the lips. John open his eyes wide, for lack of opening his mouth instead. Sherlock kisses him for at least five seconds which seem to be five-too-many-seconds-given-the-fact-there-are-people-in-the-room-looking-at-them. When he draws back, John can see everyone is surprised. Everyone, except Sherlock. Of course.
"The last one he received dates from his moving in here. Nothing which can help us in this affair."
Sherlock stands still and looks at the engineer as if he's struck by the obvious. There are a few seconds of vague silence, where Lestrade slows down his movements and where John has the unpleasant feeling he's not going to dive into his bed after all, before Sherlock comes back in the room, a finger pointed towards Jared Steele:
"Since all that I tried failed," Sherlock barely barks and that makes John's head push back by reflex.
John swallows, eyes closing by reflex and his legs stretching out when Sherlock's hands tighten on the skin which he rubs and bites with obvious pleasure. John isn't sure how he's supposed to finish reading this absolutely uninteresting letter while he feels Sherlock's cock hardening against his thigh through the fabric of his suit. And, as sleeping in a stranger's bed is not something morally acceptable, maybe kissing his flatmate on the carpet is totally okay? John prays for that to be true.
"Yes, good idea..."
"Problem?"
"Did Mrs. Hudson put some sleeping drug in the herbal tea, yesterday?"
and '
brother."
"You can't understand..."

SBSQ hits, literally, tens of thousands of views... and I got 50 reviews. As I repeated many times in the notes or even in my profile, I'm the kind of author that needs/likes/finds her strength in feedback/reviews/comments. I'm sure you already read this in plentiful of other introductions and it's true. We, as author, love to write, but some of us publish to have an interaction with the readers, to know what our readers like (or don't like! as long as the comments are respectful and the purpose is to help the author to improve her writing or some details of her plot :)).
"Barrow," John creaks more than he smiles. "No, I was going to g..."
"And does that frighten you?"
again - certainly to say goodbye to them.
The detective escapes through the door held open by his friend, whom he pushes by the shoulders to press him into the staircase and bring them to the farthest possible distance of the DI's shouts, who curses with insults so full of imagery that John's eyebrows jump with surprise.
"... John?"
For the last time, John looks at his watch; if he leaves now, he can pass by the newsdealer and grab something to eat for tonight. He leans on the folder which he's writing the last patient's information. If he doesn't manage to write faster, his right foot—which is already shaking itself—seems more than ready to leave without him. It's because Sherlock has told him that he had to first take care of another case which is the reason that they aren't running around every corner of London to find the shooter of the Royal Festival Hall anymore. Rather than staying in Baker Street, twiddling his thumbs (or using them for much less Catholic purposes) John has been coming to the clinic daily for the last two weeks.
“Should I make some snacks to eat while we open gifts?”
"I'm exhausted and thirsty but good," Sherlock said. "Are you?"
“God,” Sherlock exhaled. It’d been so long since he had this feeling, and he wanted to savor it completed. He let John’s mouth explore the skin of his neck and then said, “Can I take off my shirt?”
Harry nodded. "I am, I promise."
"You like being nice, admit it," he said. He wrinkled his nose and shook his head away from Sherlock's hand.
John opened the cupboard again but changed his mind, tried to get under the bed, then stood quickly. Sherlock's shirt was too restricting. He took it off, threw it away from the bed, and climbed under the covers as Sherlock was getting close to one.
John shook his head. "I'll call my mum in a little while, but we've not exchanged gifts for a long time."
In the morning, Sherlock rolled over and saw John beside him. He lifted his hand to his head -- it hurt again. When he shifted his body, his body hurt again. “John,” he said. “Are you awake?”
He wondered how John had figured out the truth about their last day together. Afterwards, Sherlock had asked Mycroft about John, whose answers were deliberately cryptic. “He watched you fall” was something Sherlock was already well aware of. When the new posts began appearing, Sherlock knew John would assume he’d be reading them and he kept looking for little private references, but there were none. Obviously, John must know the truth. He’d understand the importance of keeping quiet and thus wouldn’t be dropping hints on their blog.
Sherlock looked up. “What are you talking about?”
“No, that was not mentioned,” Sherlock said. “I just decided I wanted to look pretty today. You can make your own decision about how you want to look.”
“You have to admit . . .” John said, passing him his food.
Sherlock didn’t answer right away. “I did some work,” he finally said.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. “We’ll watch a documentary, but you’d better not complain.”
"That's great, Sherlock,” John said. “We're getting close.”
"Guess what?" John asked, helping him settle into bed again without spilling anything.
He sensed movement and slowly looked up. Through the trees he could see a deer. He moved slowly, slipping his phone from his pocket.
"Just listen. A patient I regularly see tested positive for Covid, so I have to isolate and keep track of my symptoms for a couple weeks."
Hours later, Sherlock emerged and found John was still here. “I’m bored,” he said, flopping into his chair.
"No one does," John said. "But the situation is serious, so we have to do it. Stay in, wash your hands, don't touch your face, and we'll be fine. We’ve actually been safe staying in, and let’s face it, you’re an expert at social distancing."
Unless Sherlock didn't want them to be. But that was a wild assumption to make. He paid the driver and headed up to the flat.
Sherlock instinctively reached up and touched his own forehead. “I don’t feel hot,” he said. “Or cold, so I guess that’s good.”
When that turned out to be the answer John smiled and pinched Sherlock's arm lightly. "Show off," he teased.
"Yes," John lifted his hips for Sherlock. "You've thought about it a lot? Tell me."
Sherlock moved a little away. “I know your life has been interrupted and you’ve suffered, but my life was interrupted as well . . . I don’t know how to be here now . . . who I am, I guess.” He wiped his hands over his face and stood up abruptly. “Tea?” he asked, trying to change the subject as he moved into the kitchen.
Sherlock rolled over in his sleep and then opened his eyes, thinking he must have heard John come in. He stretched a little, intending to get up, but instead curled up under the covers. Maybe he hadn’t heard John at all. He knew he could easily just check his phone to see the time, but the long sleep had been nice, and he just wanted to enjoy it for a few more minutes.
Sherlock smiled wider. "You always see, John. You just don't observe."
____________________________________
John flushed when he saw Sherlock looking all over. "I moved them," he admitted.
“We will be when we get to know each other,” Jim said. “Tell me a secret.”
John smiled wider. "Alright. But that could take a few days. How about dinner tonight? I'll treat and if you get the job, you can owe me."
“About my having to be there alone,” Sherlock said. He paused for a minute. “I never fit in, John. I never liked it.”
On the way home, he decided he needed to do something -- he didn’t want to let his old friendship with Sherlock ruin this summer. Something needed to be done.
John's brows raised a bit. "But it would be awkward. You said so yourself," he said.
John shrugged. "I'm just having a bit of fun."
"It's not for a couple weeks. We have time," John said. “Do you have something else you want to work on tonight?”
Sherlock stared at the message. He had only been joking, but now John seemed angry at him.
“It doesn’t bother me,” Sherlock said. “I have other things in my life besides trying to get . . . that.”
"Yeah, I was the captain of the rugby team," he said.
John bucked into his hand, tilting to find his mouth and kiss him again. His own hand wrapped around Sherlock and matched his speed.
“Were you afraid?”
"What? That you love me?"
“I hope you don’t mind but I think I’ll go back to more casual wear tomorrow,” Sherlock said. “Something less tight.”
“God,” Sherlock called out. He squeezed shut his eyes and tilted his head back. “I love when you fill me, John, when you’re part of me . . .”
John looked at the mug and then up at Sherlock. "Are you trying to trap me on the sofa?" he asked.
“So you’ve figured out how to drum up your own business then?”
"I know. It's just . . . it's only just happened . . ." he said quietly.
"I hope so," Sherlock said. "For your sake."
In his room, Sherlock set up his laptop and picked the first documentary he could find, a film about unsolved crimes. He flopped onto the bed. “This isn’t going to scare you, is it?” he teased.
“And your other recent scheme . . . with the handyman?”
"Oh. Okay," he said.
"No, John, it was not. I spent a few months there when I was a teenager. My great grandfather was an explorer and the Arctic was one trip he'd planned to make, but he died before he could. My uncle decided to give it a try and brought me with him," Sherlock said. "So I have been to the Arctic, John Watson, and I do know blizzards and they are not nice." He paused to take a sip of tea. "In fact, my uncle was killed in a blizzard in the Arctic. I probably should have included that earlier in the story."
Sherlock fiddled with something on the table. “I wish I didn’t have to go,” he said quietly. “I won’t have any friends.”
Sherlock sipped his tea as he stared at the screen. As the film was coming to an end, he looked over at John whose eyes were closed. It was clear he was asleep. For some reason, Sherlock smiled -- there was something quite nice about the sight of a totally relaxed John Watson. He finished his tea off, and then said softly, “John? It’s time to go to bed, I think” as he reached over and touched his arm.
"Hmm?" John asked as if he hadn't heard the question. He didn't know Sherlock well enough to get into his personal business, so he sipped his tea instead.
John added a bit more lube and slowed again to add a second finger. "Is this okay?"
"I thought you liked it?" Sherlock said.
Sherlock slid to John’s cock, sucking it into his mouth, covering it with his swirling tongue. He moaned lightly against as he began to slowly bob up and down. John swore softly and sank into the chair a bit. He left his hand in Sherlock's hair, moaning his name as he watched. Sherlock slipped one hand under John’s arse, gripping the flesh there, pulling lightly as he swallowed John’s cock. He lifted his head to breath before swallowing him down again.
"Perfect . . . yes," he breathed.
John smiled. "Okay, come on."
“When you were helping me, you were touching me and it made me think . . . that I liked it. I liked you touching me . . . and I wanted to touch you too.”
“Well, he gets that way sometimes,” she said. “As soon as things get steady, he’ll be happy -- or at least as close to happy as he gets. He’s so clever . . . I hope someone will see that and hire him.”
“Do you eat out a lot?” Sherlock asked.
John stared at the door for a moment. "I'm here about the invoice, we spoke on the phone Friday evening."
John looked over at him. "Okay. I'll be down in a bit," he said.
John grinned proudly and nodded.
“I have faith in you, John, I do. But . . .” Sherlock’s voice trailed off.
“Did I eat last night?” Sherlock said. “I can’t remember what we did. What are we doing today?”
Sherlock watched John come up the path to the house. He left his bedroom and headed downstairs right as John rang the bell. His mum rushed out, but he said, “I’ll get it -- it’s John.”
"I have checked the blog," Sherlock said. "I already have a Watson. One is enough." He opened his laptop and unlocked it.  He didn't look over at Harry because he knew she was looking at him. He just wanted her to she'd busy herself so they could just stay silent until John got home. "You can turn on the television if you'd like," he said, eyes still down.
John pulled open the door. "I'm leaving!" He hopped on his bike and rode off.
“I don’t do cases like that . . . anymore,” Sherlock said. “This is a crime I’m solving.”
There was a knock at the door. At first Sherlock thought he’d imagined it, but then he heard it again. He glanced up at John’s bedroom, but he hadn’t got up yet. Then he heard it again.
“So far,” he said. “We’ll see if it lasts.”
Mycroft stood up and moved over to the bed to oversee.
“What?” Sherlock said, trying to tangle his legs with John’s.
“Is that what you’re doing over there -- resting and relaxing?”
John laughed. "I was simply being nice," he said.
"Hmm. I think I'm fine with that," he said.
“You are such a child,” Mycroft said. “I’m busy. Be good and in a few days, you’ll get checked by a doctor and you can go home.”
John shrugged. "I'll do what you do," he said.
"But involving him," Sherlock continued, "comes with consequences. He will follow through -- will you?"
“I want to make you feel good,” Sherlock said, his hand picking up a little speed. “I want you to come to me when you want to feel good.”
Sherlock stared forward, watching the team get into place. Then one kicked the door open and the police rushed in. Sherlock broke away from Lestrade and followed.
"It’s close to work, it might be cheaper than my place now, and you're not a complete stranger. And . . . I’m desperate.”
Sherlock was in his bedroom when he heard John come in. He wasn’t sure what he’d gone in there for or when, but he sat up from the bed and rubbed his face before coming out to the kitchen. “You’re back,” he said for no reason whatsoever.
“John!” Sherlock said. “I am trying to work! You just said you’re resting, but I’m working.”
"Okay. I have extra clothes and some snacks," John said.
John pushed off of the table. "Now you're just making things up. You haven't dreamt about me and I'm sure I won't again either. It was just random. Trust me, there's no secret desire or want or anything like that. I'll prove it." He moved over to Sherlock and without thinking too much about it, he leaned in and kissed him. John kissed Sherlock hard on the mouth. "See? Nothing," he said.
"Of course they will. They'll say you have a good taste in music but they'll criticise without any doubts the jumper you'll choose to wear that night."
?" John wonders by raising an eyebrow.
who is doing an amazing job. She's one of the most precious person I met on the world wide web.
"Back then, there was a couple, like you, who lived on the second floor. A heterosexual couple, however. Charming people. They left when she got pregnant and when they wanted to buy. They always send me a card for my birthday."
“Should I call him to let him know we’re staying inside?”
"Are you trying to trick the information out of me? You don’t need to -- I remember it," he said. He took a long drink and finished the wine.
Sherlock’s head felt a bit unclear. Why was John giving Lestrade all these specifics but keeping things vague for Sherlock? “No,” he mumbled. “I’m just concerned about this whole strategy.”
"Why didn't you call me?" John asked.
Sherlock turned off the lamp and then turned on the film. He relaxed back a bit and started watching for clues.
Sherlock took a long sip of tea. "I went there . . . a long time ago," he said quietly. "Mycroft found it."
"Oh," John said softly in surprise. He adjusted his hands on Sherlock and moved with him.
John looked around the room again. It really was very messy. "It’s . . . an interesting space," he said, looking over at Sherlock again. "Um, what do you do exactly? I found your website but I didn't really understand."
Sherlock grabbed his mug and carried it into the kitchen. "If I don't see you in the morning, let me know what time you'll be back, yeah?" he said.
Once they’d finished, John followed Sherlock outside again. "It really will be okay," he said.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Sherlock said, even though he knew they both knew the purpose of the walk. “Here’s your food.”
"You're my only friend, my family is Mycroft, and I haven't had a gift for years," Sherlock said. He glanced at John and then changed the subject. "Besides, we'll all be dead by Christmas -- from boredom or the cold or both."
"I only came up with one game, I hope that will be okay," he said. "What you have planned sounds very intense."
"Boys! Good to see you again!" Angelo said as he walked over. "Are you both well?"
John grinned and couldn't think of something clever to say, so he left it for now to start getting ready.
When Sherlock’s father had come down, his parents bickered over what time it’d be best to eat. Sherlock offered to bring in wood. Eventually, the house had calmed down. His parents had gone upstairs to “finish getting things ready,” which Sherlock knew was code for taking a nap. He was in his father’s comfy chair in front of the fire with a nice cup of tea beside him. He’d intended to read the book sitting on his lap, but had actually got a little lost in the soft crackle of the flames and the twinkling lights on the Christmas tree. So much so that the vibration of his phone left him startled for a moment as if he’d be abruptly woken from a dream.
"He's just not my type, that's all."
“Fine,” Sherlock said reaching for two mugs before grabbing the milk. “Do you whatever you need to do.”
“It was fun,” Sherlock said. “Remember the other day when we were trying to prove we were interesting? We should have done that instead of the prank phone calls.”
“Sherlock, is that you?”
“Okay,” Sherlock said. He finished his tea and peeked out of the shed, noticing his parents’ window was dark. “Are you ready?”
“Called who?”
"There was no goal until you got upset. I was just teasing . . . playing a game," John shrugged. The collar brushed his cheeks.
For a millisecond, Sherlock considered calling John – John was the one who helped people. But if the man was sick or injured, why would he have come here and not a hospital?
John nodded and kissed him again, softer, over and over. Sherlock slid a hand up John's back and gripped the back of his head. He dropped his mouth to his neck and sucked on the skin. It was almost like he recognized the taste.
John looked up at the man, then squinted. "Um, yes," he said.
"Pretended," John corrected. "But I might be swayed after this date," he smiled.
“Don’t, Sherlock. Leave him alone to work,” Lestrade said.
“It’s hurting my back for some reason,” Sherlock said, sitting up. He lifted his shirt over his head and turned toward John. “Did I get stung by something maybe?”
“You’re right,” John said. “But it sounds promising -- why not solve it and rub it in their faces?”
“Do you mean she was boring?”
“Morgue first,” Sherlock said, heading up to John’s room. “Then we can take the suitcase to the police, so you’ll only be breaking the law for a few more hours. I hope you can handle that.”
"Good," John said. He took his temperature and focused on his breathing. "My temperature is normal and I'm breathing fine."
“I’m still working,” Sherlock called from the other side.
"Are you going to leave too?" John asked.
Sherlock woke up off and on through the night. At one point he noticed that it was beginning to get light out, so he gave up on sleeping and let himself get lost in his head. He saw a memory from that first day when he and John met in the lab, then an image of their running together through London, and flashes of other cases. They worked so well together. He hadn’t regretted a single moment of their partnership.
"Anytime," he said. He helped her take the bags into her flat before heading up to his own.
Sherlock was walking home from the news agents when his phone vibrated. He pulled it out and stared at it for a moment, before figuring out who JW was.
"Yeah, that’d be fine," he said.
“I have no idea,” Sherlock said. “Which reminds me – you feeling okay? You didn’t have any side effects from my dinner, did you?”
Sherlock had been staring out the window, letting the landscape blaze across his eyes until they glazed over and closed and he’d fallen asleep. He woke with a start when the train jerked, and Sherlock’s hand immediately went to his neck, which now burned from the awkward angle as he’d slept.
“John,” Sherlock exhaled at the touch. Someone else doing that to him felt much different than when he did it to himself. He reached down and touched John’s cock which was hot and hard. His hand mimicked John’s stroke.
“You’re confusing me now,” John said. “You said you were working that night -- what were you doing?”
"I'm relatively certain," Sherlock said. "I've not had much experience with love, but . . . yes."
She looked over at him. "It's part of the path to getting better. I have to do it."
John smiled, leaning over Sherlock to set his alarm for the morning. "Sorry, almost forgot that," he said. "And yeah, I don't have much in here, but I like it."
“Of course,” she said, getting up. “Go get the sleeping bags out of the cupboard now so you can put them through the wash.”
John went to the door. "I’m here, Mrs Hudson, are you alright?"
"Not at all," John murmured, turning his head to face him. He smiled softly.
"She's going to be very smug," John said. "She'll take care of your brother for us."
“So you’ll be standing guard the whole time?”
“A suicide,” Sherlock said. “That wasn’t a suicide.” He stopped abruptly when the server brought over the wine and took their order. After he left, Sherlock took a sip of wine and continued, “I’m sure it’s murder, but the ruling is suicide. I’m trying to get the police to trust me so they re-open the case. And when they do, I plan to have it solved.”
John was making a mental list of what he would need. "Should I walk here in the morning?" he asked.
John nodded, holding Sherlock's hand in front of him. "Yes," he said.
"Will you order it, please?"
When he finished his cigarette, he made a cup of tea. He brought it in and sat down across from John. “So what are we going to do tonight?” he asked.
“In here,” Sherlock called from his bedroom.
“Well, maybe one day you won’t be on your own,” she said. “Maybe one day I’ll be sitting in church watching you get married.”
Sherlock frowned. Why couldn’t John understand what he was saying?
"It’s buffet style so we go up there to get what we want," John said, pointing to where the employees were lighting the small heating fires.
His dad said, “Son, I know new things can be difficult. But life is full of new things and I don’t want you to miss out on them.”
"I work with Molly," Sherlock said. "I don't know the man, but I hope she's happy." As the words came out of his mouth, Sherlock couldn't decide if they sound like he was wishing them well or being sarcastic, so instead he changed the subject. "What are you drinking?" he asked.
“And do you agree -- would moving in here with me be the best for you?” Sherlock asked. “Think carefully.”
“I don’t want to stop,” Sherlock said. “I just wanted to say it was unusual. But unusual is good, right?” He twisted himself around to face John. He lifted his hands to the sides of John’s head and gave him a soft kiss.
John swatted his arm. "Don't be rude," he said. "It’s not nice."
John shifted and hummed. "Not yet,” he mumbled.
“All right,” she said. “We don’t have to go to the ceremony,” she said. “But we’re doing a dinner with your grandparents when we get back and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
“That’s very kind of you,” his mum said, coming over and sitting down at the wooden table.
"Honestly I have no idea -- she was just asking questions, which was very annoying," Sherlock said. "Can you imagine how annoying it was being asked ridiculous questions at all day?"
No one said anything for a minute so Sherlock added, “It’s the last night he’s staying over before you send me away . . .”
"Did you poison me last night? Please tell me you didn't poison me," John said.
John nodded. "I should tell you something too," he said. "Something I should have said before."
"Do you want to? Do you want to come in my mouth?" John asked, his voice a bit breathless.
Sherlock finished his cigarette and followed John inside. He grabbed some shorts and went into the bathroom to get ready. He came back out and said, “We’ve only got one big towel. I’ll be honest, my mum had suggested swimming as an option, but I didn’t think we’d do it.”
"It was fun, we made plans to go out again," he said.
"Yeah, it was fine. I won't mind a little break, though I wish it was for a better reason," he said.
"I know, son," she said, turning her head to give him a smile. "I can see that you are happy."
"Slow at first . .. it all happened in your chair," John said. His hands were pushing Sherlock's clothes off, nails scraping over his shoulders and back as they kissed.
“John,” Sherlock said, surprised, as he pulled his hands from John’s. He looked at John, seeing him staring at the uniform. And suddenly he knew what was happening. He stepped back slightly and said, “On your knees, soldier.”
"What are you worried about? What do you feel unprotected about?"
“We’ll see tomorrow,” John said. “Are you in pain?”
“So, you’ve done it now,” Sherlock said, pulling the sheet up over himself.
“I don’t want to let any germs in,” Sherlock said.
"Of course, I did," Sherlock said. "I'm glad you did -- I know you could have been doing stuff with other people. . .I'm glad you came with me."
"Come on then," Sherlock said, pulling on John's arm. When they got into the bedroom, he pushed John onto the bed and then slid next to him. "Just let me by you," he said snuggling up.
"Okay," Sherlock said, sitting down next to him.
"Who?" Sherlock asked.
The next thing John knew he was waking up startled, his body having slipped from sitting up on the couch to falling onto the cushions. The flat was dark and the light of the telly wand flickering in the room. He sat up and stretched out his soreness. He turned off the telly and moved through the flat in the dark. He was heading for the stairs when he noticed the time. He thought it was the middle of the night but it wasn't -- it was the next morning. He slept through the night on the sofa.
Sherlock watched John let go. Then he pressed his face against the pillow as he tried to catch his breath. He felt drained of all energy.
John smiled softly as he kept petting Sherlock's hair. "Why are you always so mean to me?" he teased.
"No, not since I left rehab," Sherlock said. "And I'll also answer your unasked question -- yes, I have been tempted, but ultimately, the cases fulfill that need now." He found it hard to look at John, but he tried. "And I also know now it'd hurt you if I were to . . . make poor decisions again. I don't want to hurt you."
Sherlock spent most of the night working. He wasn’t finding much useful in terms of who took the painting. He finally fell asleep, wondering if this was a waste of his time after all.
“That’s all I wanted to know – just tell me if you’re starting to feel bad,” Sherlock said. He stood up and took their plates to the kitchen. He washed them and came back. “I suppose you’ll want to sleep in late tomorrow.”
“As soon as we know you can move around safely, you’ll go -- on your own. To rest,” Mycroft stated. He looked at John for back up.
"But you knew, and I let her stay and disrupt your work and now . . . well, now you know what she's like . . ." He didn't look at Sherlock as he spoke.
Sherlock slipped a hand to John’s lower back, pulling him even closer. “This okay?” he asked.
Sherlock was still standing on the other side of his bedroom door, listening. When he could tell John was in the kitchen, he pulled out his phone.
“I knew it,” Sherlock said, taking a drink.
Sherlock pushed a pillow toward John. "Don't, though," he added. He took a sip of tea and lifted his legs onto the table, sliding down a bit. "Do you like her?" he asked. "I mean, if she wasn't your sister, would you be friends with her?"
“I was looking for a man,” Sherlock said.
“Well, just . . . be normal,” Sherlock said. He set the laptop on his desk chair and tried to get comfortable. “I’m glad you came by,” he said quietly. “I wish you’d done it differently, but I wish everything was different.” He paused for a minute before adding, “I’m sorry I didn’t write back.”
Sherlock had just finished shaving and was getting dressed when he heard John come in. He emerged and saw John. He looked extremely handsome and Sherlock felt like kissing him, but he looked quite engrossed in whatever he was reading and he didn’t want to irritate him.
"Okay," John said, but he doubted he'd ever ask. He tried not to shift against the bed.
“No, it wasn’t things like that,” Sherlock said, rolling on his side away from John. “I just sometimes dream about little things, little differences.”
It wasn’t long until he heard a soft tap on his door.
“I believe you take the ax and chop the wood,” Sherlock said. “Or has it become more complicated in recent years?”
"What is it?" John asked.
“Fine,” Sherlock said, pushing himself up on the bed. “I’ve rested -- surely that means I’m ready to go home.”
Sherlock exhaled. “You’re the only one who thinks that, John,” he said.
Sherlock felt the stretch of John entering him and suddenly it all seemed so overwhelming. What they were doing was big –- it would change everything even if both of them were sure it wouldn’t. “Wait, stop,” he mumbled, pulling his body away from John. “Just a minute . . .” he said as he let himself drop onto the mattress, grabbing at the sheet.
John nodded. "You are. It feels good."
"Such as?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine,” he said. He leaned forward and told John all the details -- about where he had to go, how he put things together, and the results. He explained the euphoric effects of the drug as well as the gory details about what it can do to a person’s mind and body, especially in extremely high doses. It wasn’t quite the same as if John had been there with him, but it was good to talk it through and things felt a little more normal again.
"I did not think that," John protested. He noticed Sherlock raising his brows. "Okay, fine, maybe for a second. But honestly I didn't see how you were going to connect everything together."
“Has he given you any evidence of that?” she asked.
"I think it's . . . flattering. I want to ask why you never said anything sooner, but I think I know. The timing has never been . . . right.”.
"I don't have one right now," he said.
"I did," Sherlock said. "I put everything on everything -- all the pictures, all the books, everything in this flat is mine and it's all there because I put it there on a whim. No rhyme or reason, just a whim. I have them all the time, and they are the explanation for anything further you might be considering asking me." He pulled out his phone and opened his messages.
“Do I?” Sherlock asked.
John shook his head. "No," he breathed.
“Can I touch you?” Sherlock whispered.
"Okay," Sherlock said, standing up. "Long enough for you to do the laundry and for me to do the washing up--unless you'd like to also do the washing up as well?" he asked with a cheeky grin as he took John's plate to the sink.
“I know,” Sherlock said. “Well, I’ve not found our guy yet, but as soon as I do, it should be relatively simple to finish this up.”
Sherlock spent the next few days not doing much at all, but then Lestrade stopped by to talk to him about a case. However, talk was really all he wanted. Sherlock did his best to impress upon the Lestrade how much more help he could offer.
"I'll find out what's going on," John said. He went back out into the hall and found the nurse. "Can you tell me what is happening with my friend, Sherlock Holmes?"
“Speaking of that,” she said. “If you’ve got free time . . .”
Sherlock felt confused. He was so good at reading John, but in this moment, he had literally no idea what John was going to say.
“All right,” Sherlock said. “I look forward to hearing from you.”
“It’s just -- that’s not what I want. I just want you to be here. That’s all I’m trying to say. But now you’ll be at work and out doing other things,” Sherlock said. He didn’t feel like he was making himself clear, but he couldn’t think how else to say it. “It doesn’t matter, I suppose. I think I’ll do a little more work now,” he said as he made a move to get up from the bed.
“I know, but I’ve seen myself without clothes before. I’ve never see you nude, I don’t think.”
"I just told you! She. Didn't. Want. To. See. Me."
Sherlock turned his head to look at John. “Do you feel different?” he asked.
“Hello, sir, I’m sorry to disturb you, but I’m sitting here with my colleague and we’re both wearing business suits because we’re business men who do business and we were wondering if you’d like to hire us.”
"Don't you dare, John Watson," Sherlock scolded. "What a man keeps in his coat pockets is his own business."
John shook his head. "We don't have to talk about it."
“And what would you say about having a little drink even though it’s early and we’ve had no dinner yet?”
“That would be fine,” Sherlock said. “Wait, actually -- would it be possible to stop by late afternoon . . . perhaps at the end of your shift?”
“Yes,” John said. “Like that.”
“You coming straight back after class tomorrow?” Sherlock asked. “Around midday or later?”
Sherlock glanced over. "No," he said. "I'll stay here with you." His face softened a little as he sat back down. "Fine . . . now what?"
He went back to work trying to make a plan in the back of his mind as he saw the rest of his patients. When he left he texted Sherlock about picking up dinner, rerouted his way home and stopped by the bookshop. He made a bold move and asked her out to dinner. She still hadn't mentioned a boyfriend and even though she hesitated slightly, she did agree to go. John left and headed back to the flat, feeling like he was finally making progress.
"I've got a job. It's up north--the owners work with several rehab facilities to help people and I can work part time there. It's near my sponsor, just in case."
Sherlock followed John’s actions, following up with a sip of wine. “And now you and I are going to go on an adventure.”
"How do you know?" he asked.
"I'm sorry,” she said. “I thought . . .”
She shook her head, still not looking at him properly. He thought back through his cases and realised who it must be. "Okay, thank you," he said.
His mother made a small dinner which they ate together at the table and then the three of them read before the fire. It was a quaint sight in the room, and for some reason, Sherlock didn’t mind it that much. He had no crime to investigate, no case to work on, so he might as well let this be a restful break.
He closed his eyes and drifted to sleep. He dreamt he was in a club. He looked over and saw the alive version of the corpse he’d been staring at this morning. The image woke him from his sleep and he saw that he’s spilled his tea. He got up to clean up and turned on the kettle. He wondered if John’d be home soon; then he heard footsteps on the stairs. He pulled two mugs from the cupboard.
"Mum! I'm leaving!" John was stuffing knick-knacks into his backpack. He'd been rummaging the house and his room for days to find the perfect items.
“I don't have anything planned tonight,” John said. “However, speaking of plans, I'm taking our suspect to dinner tomorrow."
"It's easy to say things in the heat of the moment."
John laughed. "I'd like to see that, honestly."
John nodded. "It feels good . . . you're really sexy . . ."
“John,” Sherlock said, moving to grab his coat. He realised he’d already said that so added, “He’s a medical doctor. Could be some help.”
Sherlock grinned. "Which means I was right," he said. He was enjoying the moment of triumph and of John's witnessing it. His body was close to John's, and he realised he was enjoying that too. He reached over and ran his hand slowly through John's hair.
"Hi," John said as he came out of the bathroom.
“Do you care if we watch for a few minutes? You can choose something,” Sherlock said.
“I think so.”
John arrived a bit early, got his drink, and picked his spot, just like always. He sat in the tall stool chair and looked around. The place wasn't very crowded, so they weren't off to a good start. John saw his friend moving around the stage, holding an earpiece and murmuring instructions. He looked stressed but completely in his element. John took out his phone to pass the time a bit -- it wasn't long before the band came out. John put his phone away and looked around at the crowd. At first people looked interested, dancing along to the music. But as the second and third songs started, people were losing interest. They started talking amongst themselves, leaving to get drinks with no worry about getting back quickly. Between songs the band tried talking to the crowd and riling them up, but the lead was a bit awkward and his jokes and comments weren't landing -- the laughter leaned toward mockery. John was typing this all up as he was seeing it. He used to feel bad, but he didn't anymore, not now that he knew his friend wasn't affected. He would help the band get some tips and tricks, try them again in a different setting, and eventually he'd find the right fit for them. He was good at his job.
Stretched out alone in his bed, hands supporting his neck, eyes anchored on the bluish ceiling in the night, John tries to find the word which can define his scar. Then, he tries to find the word to define
He doesn't release his forearm and if Sherlock still tries to escape from his influence, John begins to see his face coloring with a disturbing red.
"John, what were you doing here?"
Jared Steele smiles pitifully, his hand stirring before resting on its colleague. The suspect has to be the size of Lestrade, although his shoulders are more squared and his belly a bit more developed. On top of his sweaty head, there is short salt-and-pepper hair, where the jet black definitively bows in front of the years. It's not difficult to see that the man is quite handsome; he has a certain charm with his natural suntanned skin and his eyes of a light brown that aren't seen very often in the South of England.
"Inspector Lestrade must have warned you that you were summoned because the ballistics established that the blow which killed Mr. Sherrer had been fired from the back-scene. There are certain precise seats where the shooter could have been sitting and these seats surrounded you. I'd like to know what you saw that evening, even if you have the impression you're repeating yourself."
Sherlock shakes his head once and rests all his back against the sofa's pillow. John continues.
More and more kudos and also comments! Thank you guys, it means the world to me. And lots, lots of love to
His eyes open a few hours later. There's a really unpleasant breeze on the bottom of his back. He turns around and sees lying on his side, back to him, Sherlock without any blanket. He pulled it down to their knees and coldness comes back like a nasty slap on the doctor's face. He mumbles, fulminates against this couple issue even if they're not one, and with slowness, pulls back on the blanket. He barely sees anything, but the curtains aren't fully opaque, they let enough light in to help him realize the sleeping pill is gone.
John leans in and lays his lips on Sherlock's. The caress is soft. Slow. Surreal, maybe. The fact remains that it really exists. The contact is strange; John doesn't know what to think about it. So he presses a little bit more to help himself understand. Their noses are pressed against each other, it's painful. None of them has the presence of mind to turn their faces. John doesn't think about it because he's not sure if he should stop everything right now. Does Sherlock not think about it either for the same reason? Or does Sherlock not think about it because he doesn't know?
... Wow, did anyone else hear that?
Letting his spirit ramble, he smiles, imagining the meeting between Harriet and Sherlock. Would she wonder, too, what a guy like Sherlock is doing with someone like himself? Not that they're a couple, of course, but the question would be warranted. Maybe his sister would manage to shut the detective's trap. How fun could it be, for once, to shut up...
"Anybody want some wine?" proposes the doctor, quite proud to really have managed to surprise his flatmate.
Oh really? And what am I trying to do? -J
"So, John, I read that you are on a big case?"
"Gregory..." Elisa calls with a firm voice but her partner doesn't hear her.
"Oh, you still think that your blog attracts the crowds? Put it in your skull once and for all: nobody cares about Sherlock Holmes and John Watson's sexual life. Now, stop with Sherrer's pictures and help me emptying the last box," Sherlock imposes, pushing away the one he emptied.
“Where are you going?”
Sherlock is now on the stage. With his hands behind his back, he gets through to the musicians by looking at them one by one. He tries to recognise them, John knows this because he often goes to the extremity of the scene to see the whole picture from the same angle as when they were in their seats, 14 and 15W. More than the half of the musicians are in town suits because it's still the afternoon and their next representation will not begin until 8 pm. That doesn't seem to disturb Sherlock who continues his inspection for about seven minutes before raising his voice towards the back-scene:
There's no noise in this warehouse but John doesn't feel peaceful at all. He doesn't understand this situation, doesn't want to be here, and doesn't want to hear that. He shakes his head despite himself and can't possibly explain how much he can't stop what's happening between Sherlock and him. Mycroft would not understand. Even John had trouble understanding.
Sherlock's face became withdrawn, the mask of the worried man giving way to the one cold and harsh that nobody on this damn earth really liked, and the most fake smile on the planet appeared on his mouth. Oh, how Sherlock hated it when someone was telling him what to do - and it was precisely why Gregory acted this way. The brown haired man let the blanket fall on the ground and put his hand in his right pocket before walking toward the yellow ribbon uncoiled between two police cars. If a lot of adjectives were suitable to describe Sherlock, for sure,
Once again, sadly, I don't have a beta and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for the mistakes.
"Of course doctor, as soon as I am done with my tea. So tell me, Sherlock, how is this musician's murder story going? I am bored, amuse me with the narrative of your failed case."
06:15 PM
"She's hiding something then."
“Still in the morgue.”
"Damn, Sherlock it's not funny! It's like the heart Lestrade drew on the plan, in place of seats 14 and 15W;
The doctor says nothing, tidying up as quickly as possible. Once the cardboard boxes are back where they found them, he puts on his jacket and follows both men, running away from the apartment.
John smiles. Sherlock not only translated in his own language the word
stress you out? Oh, that is the stupidest thing you've said this week. Come on, John, tell me what you're thinking about, so we can continue our research. And say it now because we still have one box to open. Tell me. Tell me.
10:06 PM
"But w-we w-would have heard it all the s-same?"
“He wants to know how it's going.”
"Give me that, Sherlock!"
bedroom anyway. He almost cried when he saw the sign “Self-serve buffet – CLOSED”. The Auxhall Fiesta still smells of cigarettes, and Sherlock asks himself if it wouldn't be more practical to buy a packet, because he's very close to setting a seat on fire to try to smoke it.
It takes a few seconds for the detective to understand he's being called to order, so he politely smiles to apologise and continues:
He doesn't fall asleep easily that evening because in his brain arises an indecent number of questions. He has to turn around for the hundredth time between his warm sheets before finally daring to bring out its mobile:
“They only had one room with a double bed...”
With a quick glance on his right, John sees Sherlock on his feet, smiling. Coming here was
And this time, given Sherlock's smile, he knows he's on the right track. They look at each other a second more and on the small table where their elbows are touching, they lean forward before starting a deduction game John is planning to succeed at this time. It's not an Olympic game where laws are clear and respected, there's no referee to kick off the drive, it's only a backstabbing and merciless sparring match.
"Mrs. Hudson..."
"What happened between us… What is happening between us. I would never have... slept with you without having… guarantees, you know."
return (John scowls with irony with the mere mention of the word), and the meeting Mycroft-style in the abandoned factory.
He kneels down automatically, spreads the hanging suits and discovers perfectly aligned shoes (which is rather ironic in comparison to the state of the flat), and a multitude of cardboard boxes. John opens one, finds a set of shoe polish that he'll take from time to time from now on, a collection of forsaken socks (the ultimate proof that Sherlock Holmes
John's body is heavy and the ache is underlying. The EKG/WCG monitor next to him is making a ridiculous racket. He doesn't even realise how many medicines they gave him so he wouldn't go crazy with pain. It also helps him to accept the forced immobilisation.
"No, that doesn't help me, that's stressing me out!"
"Greg will never let you question Benjamin, after what you did to him..."
09:00 AM
"Just so you know, I can handle more scotch," he smiles, carrying the glass to his lips.
"Ask Benjamin, it is he who picked them up. And was Sherrer present during those seven performances?" pursues the detective, without deigning to look at both men on all fours behind him.
"Excuse me..." speaks a voice behind them." Could you stop gesticulating? I can't see a thing."
. John closes his eyes, opens his mouth and lets Sherlock's tongue stroke his. Their movements are slow, tender. Sherlock barely strokes John's wounded cheek, making him pulling a face.
The Watson family never encouraged talking as a deadly and peaceful weapon. Like any other northern-London family, they taught their children to gather their emotions and to push them deep down inside themselves into an inaccessible room and to never talk about them anymore. It was the best advice you could give to a soldier and John is fully aware of that: he came back alive from Afghanistan, despite the horrors he saw, felt, touched, or did.
“Oh dear God, it's going to be a shitty contest.”
Hi everyone! I'm back with a new project that I started 5 months ago. The story will be 22 chapters long and will be published both in French and in English (here and on FanFiction). It's a casefic, also focusing on the Sherlock and John's relationship. It takes place at the end of Season 1. The title is inspired by a quote from Hemingway "You're so brave and quiet, I forget you are suffering," and the story itself is mainly inspired by all the amazing work of
"No. But we'll have to question Sheri Walsh and Benjamin Cox again."
“Thank you, Greg,” Sherlock says in his turn, without noticing the knowing smile they share.
"She swore last May that she wouldn't do it again, in any case."
He ignores the amused, but nevertheless full of reproach, gaze of his sister and returns to his place before bringing out of his pocket both Snickers, which he puts on the bedside table. They look at each other with tangible excitement, obviously happy to see one another again, except Harry who seems miles away from these meanly human considerations. John would like to excuse her free-and-easy attitude by blaming the morphine, but that would be a lie.
"During these last months, she took care of always taking the mail before him and every time I called on their telephone - to plead an advertising call or a call from their bank - she answered, sometimes out of breath, proving that she preferred to tumble down three floors rather than to let her son answer. And then there is this so-called husband on a business trip, which I looked into. If Doris is actually married to a Robert Cox, Robert Cox is also the name of a British citizen who died at Walvis Bay, in Namibia, seven months ago, during a road accident."
"By the way, tell Mrs. Hudson I'll be there for Christmas," says the DI all of a sudden.
Lestrade and both flatmates are finishing their coffee, which was the best decision to drink this morning. Steele waits for them in room n°7 and they're going to meet him quite slowly because, according to Lestrade, the financial engineer is innocent anyway and because the flatmates are much too tired to go faster. The DI leaves them to join the room behind the two-way mirror and they remove their jacket and coat before going into the wished room.
is not enough to stop.
Did you listen to
In the trembling subway, between the baby's tears in his blue pushchair and the noisy laughs of the three teenagers around him, John keeps his eyes fixed on the map above the door, his lips pinched in an unconscious grimace. Two more stops and he'll be able to leave the furnace produced by men with belted suits and unbearable pressure, and by the kids coming back home after school. Sometimes, John wonders how it's humanly possible to raise a child in London. Some other times, he wonders if he'd have to leave this city he loves so much to raise a hypothetical family. And as he doesn't quite know if the idea terrifies or pleases him. When that happens, he does everything he can to keep this gulf sensation in his chest quiet.
at me. That was enough to raise doubts. Maybe she knew Steele was going to marry her sister to make his citizenship application. She wanted to save time."
John flips over in the bed for the hundredth time. The bedroom is plunged into darkness; he forgets the green and red tartan plaid on the other side of the bed, the dotted beige wallpaper, and the dark mahogany headboard. He mainly forgets the teddy bear family that is now remaining far, far away from him. It's past midnight and Sherlock still hasn't come back. He didn't go far for sure, he saw him by the window; he was talking on the phone in the park and the car is still here. Maybe then he went to the lake to see the trout reckless enough to come close to the surface. It's not that John is worried, but he thinks about it, and when John thinks about it he doesn't sleep.
Steele has an enactment of a smile tinged with sadness, and while he approaches with languor the group of men, John has the naivety to believe for a few seconds that it's not a stupid story of papers. Sherlock and he aren't here for that and the situation is so inequitable that their voices are now stuffed by bitterness.
more adapted. Well I will attach your wrists and ankles to be sure that you will not move while I do what I planned to do on, above, or inside you," he sighs, tightening his grip.
file has a three star priority when he sends him a new case, or comes close to the trash when he asks him to take Father and Mother to go see Les Mis). The Woman's file is sealed and locked. There will be no other information to add; you can only see it without being able to make any changes. In this file, there is everything, literally. Measurements, texts he never replied to, the connection with Moriarty, the last known address in Hanoi, and the
John watches his flatmate unbuttoning his shirt with one hand, before imposing between the fingers of the doctor the tie which he just removed.
There are steps walking toward them now, heavy and so slow. The steps don't even slow down in front of the kitchen or the living-room; the intruder knows they're in the bedroom. John has the reflex to close his forefinger against his palm but when he realises that once again both of their lives come down to the first phalanx of the detective, it's a simple prayer that occurs to him.
There's a metallic taste invading John's mouth and it's maybe because he bit himself hard enough to bleed, but he doesn't feel anything. If Sherlock kisses him, will he also taste this unpleasantness? Did John at least brush his teeth? And are they going to use their tongues? Shit, Sherlock's questions were so mesmerizing that now the soldier can only think in questions.
That makes Benjamin jump up, and even if it doesn't make the doctor blink, he can't help but see the deep and painful inhalation of the younger man. Benjamin moves back awkwardly, eyes bulging with fear at seeing a real weapon, and John knows what that means: it's the look of the first time.
