“My assistant Nicole can answer your questions,” the woman said as she gestured for a younger woman to come forward from the crowd. “I am needed elsewhere.”
Cas rolled his hips so their cocks drug against each other. Dean pulled away from the kiss and pressed his lips to Cas’s cheek as he panted and groaned.
“Oh,” Cas said. “I…”
“Thanks, doc.” Dean huffed. “Got any other bad news for me?”
“Isn’t that convenient?” Dean asked. “You think it’s a hoax? Someone from the church or the theater playing angel dress up to get more sales?”
“Is Summer here tonight?” Sam asked.
“Yes,” Dean said. “Because I think you’re cute.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean called out.
Sam shook his head. “I told you there was a reason I stopped bothering with other hunters.”
“His relationship?” Sam asked. Realization dawned and his eyes widened. “Oh. Oh, you mean his relationship with Cas?”
“I don’t even want to know how you know that,” Dean said. “But what makes you think I want to fuck you?”
on Tumblr.)
“How many of these have you had already this morning?” Dean asked as he held up Castiel’s empty coffee mug.
Sam ran. Again.
Cas chuckled.
“Gross,” Sam said. After a moment he leaned closer to Dean and lowered his voice. He gestured at the front of the theater. In each corner there was a security guard. “Looks like someone hired some extra muscle for the evening.”
Scott shook his head.
“Leave it.” Dean grabbed hold of Cas’s coat sleeve to stop Cas from picking up the bowl of water again. “And you know I hate sleeping in here unless I’m actively dying.”
“That little…” Dean looked up at Cas. “Wait a second, you told me I’d eaten it before passing out in front of the TV.”
Dean cleared his throat and ducked his head.
Cas smiled into the kiss. “You like what you see?”
Fireworks went off in Dean’s soul as Dean leaned down to crush Cas’s mouth against his own.
“Text, actually,” Castiel said. “You weren’t very coherent, but I understood enough to assume you could use someone sober to drive you home tonight.”
Dean -- Duncan Jones a.k.a. David Bowie
Dean was about to respond when the bell above the diner’s front entrance chimed. Mary walked in with Cas following a moment later like he’d held the door open for her. Mary waved off the hostess and led the way to the booth where Dean and Sam were seated.
Dean pushed off the wall and stepped into Cas’s personal bubble. Cas cocked his head to the side like he was listening to Sam rant in Dean’s ear.
Cas started to let go of Dean’s cock when their bodies ended up pressed together once more. Dean shook his head frantically.
“Just get up here,” Dean said.
A bottle clunked down on the table in front of them.
That’s what brought him to Boston, Massachusetts to the office of Professor Castiel Krushnic. The professor was, according to Sam’s research, the most well established expert on religious studies in the US. If anyone would be able to help Dean, a lifelong agnostic, sink his teeth into the role of a seminary student questioning his faith after a family tragedy, it would be the professor.
“Looks like your night is improving,” she said to Dean. “How long have you two been together?”
“Dean,” Cas said as they stopped between the vehicles.
The first time he’d bottomed for someone happened in this car. He hadn’t lost all of his virginities here, but there’d been a lot of memorable nights and morning afters regardless.
“No, uh,” Sam said. “You didn’t embarrass me.”
Cas stared at him. The spark in his eyes told Dean just how pissed he was, but there was forgiveness in there too. Somewhere under Cas's temper he accepted what Dean was telling him. Then Cas was reaching up to cup Dean’s cheek. He leaned in for another kiss, and Dean turned away.
Cas stood up. His folding chair squeaked loudly over the tile floor.
“What the
“There’s a film festival focusing on popular movies with angels and Heaven going on downtown this month,” Cas said. “Are you familiar with the festival?”
“Hey, look at me,” Dean said. “Please.”
Cas whirled around in Dean’s arms. His hair was ruffled in all directions. His glare was icy and sharp. He reminded Dean of a very angry cat.
Out of the corner of Dean’s eye, he noticed Mary was staring at him with a puzzled frown on her face. He turned to meet her gaze.
“I thought…” Cas let go of Dean and looked away.
“Let’s get out of here and come back after hours to poke around,” Dean said. “Hopefully the rent-a-cops will be gone by then.”
“I’m peachy,” Dean said as he stopped the movie as the credits began to roll. Usually he’d watch through the credits for the bloopers of the girls cracking jokes between takes, but he wasn’t in the mood today. He glanced at Cas as he returned to the main screen on the movie program.
Dean raised his eyebrows and tilted his head trying to catch sight of Castiel’s face.
“Dean,” Cas said.
“You want to know why I keep going?” Dean asked.
The floor was sticky beneath Castiel’s dress shoes. He could smell traces of old popcorn, candy, hot dogs, and bodily fluids rising off the seats. What would it be like to watch a film in one of these places?
“Sam found a video online,” Dean said. “It’s some crappy handcam stuff from a film festival out here. One of your feathery family members showed up flashing his wings to the public. I guess he doesn’t approve of movies about angels.”
the drunk frat guys,” Jenny added.
Dean sat up from where he had leaned on the table and threw his left arm around Cas’s shoulders. Cas turned to look at Dean. They were close enough together that Cas could probably feel the breath catching in Dean’s lungs. Dean powered through the sensation and continued to hold Cas.
“You’re safe. You’re home. I’ve got you.”
Something about the man felt almost like home.
“You look like you’re translating something,” Sam said. “It’s just a diner menu, Dean.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “I’m just saying, I don’t think he’d make my list.”
“I don’t know what kind of relationship you have with God,” Summer said as she met and held Sam’s gaze. “But He and his angels don’t
Scott rolled his bottom lip through his teeth.
“Come on Cas, spit it out,” Dean said.
“It’s an orb, Sam, it doesn’t have a t--”
“I’m gonna kick Chuck’s ass the next time I see him for fucking with your healing skills,” Dean said, lifting his head so he was staring into Cas’s eyes again. “Cosmic cock block.”
“Come on, it’ll be fun,” Dean said. “When’s the last time we got to just relax together?”
“It belongs to my boss,” the teenager said as they stared at the phone.
Dean’s phone vibrated in his pocket. He thought about ignoring it, but they’d had too many close calls lately and he didn’t want to ignore a call for help. He pulled out his phone, saw that it was Sam, and gestured for Cas to follow him outside where he could actually hear what Sam had to say.
He looked down at his hands. His knuckles were swollen and raw. The ghost had gotten corporeal enough for Dean to get a few good sucker punches in between getting his ass kicked. It was pure dumb luck the ghost had thrown him in the direction of Dean’s fallen lighter when he had. Things could have gone much, much worse.
That seemed to be all the encouragement Cas needed, because the angel growled before deepening the kiss at the same time as he tightened his grip on Dean’s cock. Cas’s strokes sped up and Dean’s stomach muscles started to contract as he got closer to the edge. Dean touched Cas everywhere he could reach and moaned every time Cas changed up his speed or grip on Dean’s cock.
“What was that?” Cas asked.
“I’m fine, Sam,” Dean said. The words may have slipped through gritted teeth, but that was only because he didn’t want to have this argument for the fourth time that morning. “It was your fault I didn’t see that last step in the theater last night. Can’t believe you blinded me with a fucking flashlight.”
Castiel broke off their kiss, but before Dean could protest or respond to Sam, Castiel did it for him. Dean’s eyes widened as he realized Castiel was flipping Sam off.
The answer had barely had a chance to sink in before Dean grabbed a handful of Cas’s shirt and used it to yank the angel into a kiss.
“I gotta leave the bunker someday, Cas,” Dean said in a fragile attempt at a joke. “That’s what Sam keeps yammering on about anyway.”
“I’ll be okay.” Dean knocked his boot on the side of Cas’s leg.
Tonight, though, Dean crawled to the other side of the bed, so he wasn’t laying on his busted up ribs. The pain was duller now, but they were still injured enough that he didn’t want to push it. It was strange to be on what he considered Cas’s side of the bed. The room looked the same from here, but it felt different somehow. Maybe that was the concussion talking. Maybe it was the warmth in the middle of his chest that seemed to burn like embers when Cas settled onto Dean’s usual spot.
“Yeah,” Dean said.
Dean reached up to grab hold of Cas’s hair which he used to pull Cas’s mouth within reach.
He shook his head and winced at the spike of pain the movement drew out of the cut on his forehead. He gritted his teeth and clenched the edge of the mattress tight. His scabbed over knuckles and tan fingers stood out in stark contrast from the white sheets.
“Do you have a picture of Dillon?” Cas asked Scott.
Dean glanced at his brother before looking back out the window.
“How about a raincheck?” Cas asked quietly.
The opening night was a huge success and
Sam’s voice filtered down the hallway. He was talking to someone and laughing, either on the phone or one of those video chats he liked so much. Huh. That was happening more and more often in the last few months.
“I miss you,” Dean said.
“You ready to go?” the orderly asked as he moved the wheelchair next to the chair where Dean had moved to so he could put his boots on.
“The yelling will come later,” Dean said. He traced over the part of Cas’s chest where the angel blade had pierced through him. “Right now, we cuddle.”
“Ah, the great lone wolf, Dean Winchester is getting lonely,” Castiel said with a soft, teasing smile on his face. He knocked the toe of his boots against the side of Dean’s foot beneath the table to reassure Dean he didn’t mean anything mean by the teasing.
Dean turned away.
After all the drinking and storytelling, Dean’s lips were dry. His pulse picked up when he saw Cas’s laser focus hone in on Dean’s tongue when he tried to wet them. The air between them grew heavy again as Cas took a step closer. In Dean’s ear, Sam kept droning on.
Suddenly they were moving like they did when they were in the middle of a fight. There was no more stumbling over each other’s feet or flying elbows and knees trying to leave bruises on each other. There was the rhythm and the music and each other.
“Great, so you’re all Care Bears with special themes now?” Dean asked.
“How are you doing?” Joyce asked as she slid into the opposite side of the booth. Her red-blonde hair was wrapped back in a braid. The straggler strands around her face were held down by bobby pins. She was the aunt of the cop who’d found Dean sleeping and confused in a public park nearby seven months before.
“Hi there,” Sam said. Both of the college kids stared up at him with wide eyes, clutching their cups of coffee like teddy bears in the dark while staring down the monster in their closet. “I’m Agent Wolfgang with the FBI. I heard you two talking about a dead body. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about it?”
I missed one
? And call Cas while you’re at it.”
First a weird angel ghost sighting and now a smiting. What was going on in this town?
Cas sighed like the world at large was giving him a headache.
“I don’t understand how you and Sam can come so close to dying so often and just keep going like nothing happened.” Castiel’s brow furrowed. His eyes danced back and forth like he was trying to read the secrets Dean had written on his soul. “How do you do it?”
“You were calling me,” Cas said. “It sounded urgent. I haven’t tried to fly since... I haven’t tried in a while, but you sounded troubled so I came as fast as I could.”
He swallowed and met Cas’s neutral gaze. If the angel felt anything when he saw Dean this exposed, his expression didn’t betray it.
Dean pushed himself up to sit up against the headboard. He tried to hold Cas’s gaze, but the blue eyes Dean relied on for so much kept darting away. Was that nerves? Guilt?
“Comfy?” Dean asked.
The familiar tingling warmth of angelic healing spread out from Cas’s palm, soothing the pinching ache in Dean’s back.
Castiel returned Dean’s grin before pulling Dean in for a kiss.
“We appreciate it,” Mary said.
He let out a long breath and hissed in pain as his ribs protested the movement when they reached the bottom of the stairs.
“The cassette you gave me,” Cas said. “I thought I had it in my coat.”
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Dean asked as he flopped back onto the bed and tried to evaluate whether he was really having a heart attack or not. Thankfully, Cas had thought to move Dean’s gun onto the desk last night after they’d worn each other out. Apparently, angels could sleep if they had enough sex.
“I never cheated,” Scott said. The muscles in his jaw bulged as he stared Cas down. “I loved him. I will continue to love him until my last breath, but it never went anywhere. We never kissed or touched or anything. He tried to get me to see reason, to fight for the feelings he knew I had, but I couldn’t. I just… couldn’t.”
Cas rolled his eyes as he set one of their metal mixing bowls on the bedside table. There was a kitchen towel draped over his left forearm that tried to slide off when Cas let the bowl go, since he’d been carrying the bowl in the crook of his arm. In his left hand was a plastic bag filled with ice. In his right, he had a bottle of water and a paper cup.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean said. “I couldn’t let you go. I knew better but I couldn’t…”
“It always does.” Dean started to lift his hand to take the towel from Cas, but Cas waved him away and stepped in close. He was between Dean’s knees. If Dean wanted to see his face, he had to lift his chin to do it.
Scott nodded.
“Know what?”
Crap, thinking about wanting different things than your partner had Dean thinking about Danny again. When they weren’t getting handsy with each other, they used to talk about their futures past high school. At the time, Dean was old enough to be emancipated in Iowa and Danny used that as an excuse to leave paperwork about it in Dean’s locker every chance he got. It was a source of tension for them. Danny loved his little suburb and he never understood what Dean saw in a life on the road.
“Something wrong?” Dean asked.
“I’m just gonna go…,” Sam said before he rushed out of Dean’s bedroom and shut the door softly behind himself.
Five hours later, Dean was counting out his tips at a booth. His cup of coffee and slice of pie sat on the table next to his pile of crumpled ones and fives.
“It’s more of a nightmare now,” Dillon said. “I am here. I cannot leave.”
Cas's smile was easily bright enough to light up the whole forest. Hell, it probably lit up the whole world. Dean didn't check before he pulled Cas in for a long overdue first kiss.
Dean just stared at him and drank the last of his beer.
“Didn’t one of those posts on that flitter page you printed out say the angel was a ghost?” Dean asked.
Scott rolled his eyes.
The green goo was starting to dry and crust over on Cas’s forehead. The messy locks of his hair looked like they were starting to dry in whatever position the orb had blown them into. And Dean was definitely starting to notice a funky smell settling into the crevices of the Impala as the goo soaked into everything around them. But Cas’s wide, amazing smile made all of those negatives fade away. He really was cute, even when he was covered in disgusting, unidentifiable goo, and if that wasn’t love Dean didn’t know what else to call it.
He never told anyone about his nightmares.
“Jessie, come on, leave him. He’s no good for you,” Dean said to the main character on the screen. The beginning of this movie always left him frustrated to the point of talking to the characters like they could hear him. He couldn’t help it. It was
“Are Dean and Cas together?” Mary asked.
Dean sat up on the bed slowly. He turned so his feet hung over the side of the hospital bed. It was raised up high enough that he could kick his feet back and forth above the cold tile floor. Something about being able to do that always reminded him of his blink-and-you-miss-it childhood.
“And what would your favorite part be?”
He let go of the door and grabbed hold of Cas instead. One hand in the angel’s hair the other curled just below his ribcage. Their mouths met a fraction of a second before their bodies. Dean’s fingers tightened reflexively as he kissed Cas with every bit of energy and passion he’d kept locked away for nearly a decade since Cas had pulled him from Hell.
Dean’s laughter slowed to a chuckle.
“Well, there was the case I tried telling you about over breakfast,” Sam said.
“Salt and burn,” Dean said. “We dig up his vessel, burn it, and if he comes back again we go back to Scott to see if he left anything else behind that could have his grace or soul or whatever the hell keeps angels on Earth like that and we burn that too.”
Sam pressed his lips together and shook his head. “Whatever you say.”
Meeting younger hunters like Max and Alicia, Eileen Leahy, or even Jesse and Cesar gave Dean hope that hunter culture could change. Part of him hoped he didn’t have to lead that particular revolution, though.
Now Dean and Cas shared a hotel room. A real hotel with the little soaps and chocolates on the pillows. Sam and Jack were staying down the hall somewhere. Sam had mumbled something about spending time together and using their words when he’d pressed the separate room key into Dean’s hand.
“Gross,” Sam said. “If you two get arrested I’m letting you rot.”
Dean shook his head. “No, don’t push yourself. I’ll be fine.”
Dean smiled in spite of himself.
Sam patted Dean on the shoulder.
“I don’t know how you do it,” Castiel whispered in a voice so soft Dean almost couldn’t make out the words.
“Is that something you’d be more comfortable in?” Dean asked. He gave himself a mental pat on the back for keeping his voice steady. He could be supportive and helpful now and berate himself for being an oblivious asshole later.
“I know, Dean,” Cas said.
“What’s the matter now?” Sam asked from across the library table. His hair was a mess. Nearly as messy as the pile of books, scrolls, and strange stone tablets spread out between them.
“I need a moment,” Cas said before making his way to the front door and ducking outside. Dean watched him go with a lump in his throat and a twist in his chest.
“You’re safe, Cas,” Dean said again. “You’re home. And I’ve got you.”
Dean nodded and watched Cas leave the room. The infirmary felt so much emptier without him.  He had that effect on places. Anytime Cas was away, Dean felt the absence like a physical ache. Not that he’d ever say that out loud.
Castiel frowned. “Do you think you wouldn’t encourage the same kind of reaction?”
“Any luck figuring out what that thing is?” Dean asked Sam.
It wasn’t until Jessie and Kim were having dinner with Jessie’s boyfriend and Dean was forced to watch the girls pine for each other from across the table and behind the walls society put between them that Dean’s thoughts strayed back to Danny.
Everything would be fine.
The nurse scribbled on Dean’s chart for a moment before clicking her pen closed. She looked up at Dean with a wide smile.
“That’s an angel kill,” Dean said. “Who was this guy? Why was he worthy of a smiting?”
He closed his eyes and grabbed a random bag off the rack of chips. Then he glanced around the store looking for his brother. He spotted Sam at the counter accepting the key to the men’s room.
Dean was thankful he didn’t have to spell it out for Sam that he had no intentions of letting Cas out of his sight for at least the next three lifetimes. Maybe that would keep the stupid angel from dying on him again.
His boots butted up against the passenger door as he shifted lower on the seat to give himself a more comfortable angle. He ran a couple fingers from his other hand over his lubed cock then reached between his legs. A moan rumbled in his chest as he circled his perineum.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said.
Maybe he’d head into town for food. Or meet up with Rowena and Eileen for a hunt to get away from home for a while. Something told him the honeymoon stage was just beginning now that Sam had apparently stumbled on their not-so-secret secret.
“And how was he at dancing?” Dean asked. “Is that going to be your new thing now? Dancing with random, hot strangers in bars when you’re pissed off at me?”
“Are we at a
“Shut up,” Dean said. “Where’s the men’s room key?”
Hours later, after finally letting Cas go enough to hug Sam and meet Jack—the Nephilim who brought about this whole mess—Dean spoke with Joyce. He explained as much as he could about what he remembered and where he was going. She called Cas his husband, probably thanks to the way Dean had sobbed all over the guy in the middle of the damn diner and refused to let go of his hand later, and Dean didn’t argue the title.
“He thought I was straight.” Dean stood up and wiped tears away from the corners of his eyes. “Oh man, I needed that laugh. Thanks Sammy.”
“Okay,” Sam said. “Was there anyone else? Maybe someone new at church with a larger than life presence or someone who visited you in a dream? Someone who called themselves an angel or a god?”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas said. “Returning from the dead shouldn’t take very long.”
Cas nodded and looked away.
Cas went for the door.
Dean stole another kiss.
“Okay,” Cas said finally. He smiled, and Dean almost lost the battle he was having that kept him from pressing his mouth against Cas’s, consequences be damned.
“Dean is very protective of our work,” Cas said. “We’re doing research on some of the local lore for a book.”
“No,” Dean said. “Nothing more than what we saw last night when the movie finished. The angel didn’t show up again when we were there.”
Once the dust settled into piles of heartache and mourning like they always seemed to do, Dean found himself standing against one of the tables in the bunker staring at the front door waiting for Castiel to come home. His stomach flipped and flopped and somersaulted in on itself while he waited, but he’d made up his mind. He wasn’t going to bitch out this time.
The ghost appeared in the row of seats directly below Castiel and Dean. Dillon Bonner was no longer wearing the shy, lovesick smile from the photograph Scott Allen had shown them in his home. Instead, he was staring at Castiel with challenging eyes.
Castiel nodded. His unruly hair tickled Dean’s nose as he moved.
“You didn’t die today,” Dean said. “You’re safe. You’re home. And I’ve got you.”
Dean looked over Cas's shoulder at the picture. Scott was clean shaven with shorter blond hair, a deeper tan and a smile that stretched from one ear to the other. He had an arm thrown around the shoulders of another man who was looking sideways at Scott with a slightly sad smile that seemed somehow familiar to Dean. Dillon’s hair was dark and curled around his forehead and ears. His shoulders were broader than Scott’s, but the way he curled under the other man’s arm made him seem gentle, small.
Dean clenched his teeth. Part of him wanted to speed up even more. Make the kid chase after him or maybe even lose track of him for a minute. Maybe that would change things. At the very least it would delay any discussions Sam had in mind.
And, the most embarrassing of all of them,
Dean stared at him.
“That explains why the ticket seller told me they were close to having a full house tonight,” Sam said quietly. “The video from last weekend made the crowd look thin, but getting the attention of a local church group seems to have helped stir up interest in the festival.”
“Yeah, you don’t want to do that,” Dean said. His voice was cold, but his blood ran hellfire hot in his veins. If this son of a bitch thought he was going to hurt Cas, Dean would be more than happy to correct him.
Dean slumped back into his seat. “There goes that idea.”
Dean nodded even though he knew Cas couldn’t see it. “Okay.”
Dean shook his head and returned to shoveling fries into his mouth.
Dean’s smile froze on his face.
Dean pressed a hand to his ribs on the right side of his chest and groaned. Why did the bunker have so many stairs? You’d think the Men of Letters would have had the forethought to install some kind of magic elevator. He leaned against the wall and rested his head. Maybe he could hang out up here for a little while. Get his strength back before making his way down the stairs. Less chance of ending up as a pile of broken bones that way. Well, more broken bones, if the ache in his ribs was anything to go by.
Sam started ordering food for himself and their mom. When he was finished, Dean fought with his tongue and managed to fumble out an order of food for himself and for Cas. If the angel didn’t feel like eating today, then Dean could swap plates with him.
“We’re safe,” Dean said. “We’re home, we’ve got each other. And… I love you, Cas.”
“When I showed up at Cas’s office, I was a man without faith,” Dean said. “I knew there was something about Jimmy’s character that spoke to me, but I didn’t understand him yet. I figured I could borrow a couple books or read a couple bible passages on Cas’s recommendation and I’d be able to get Jimmy pinned down.”
“We all failed, Dean,” Castiel said. “Our mistakes do not rest solely on your shoulders.”
Dean nodded.
When they got back to the Impala, Dean started the car but didn’t drive away. He held the steering wheel between his hands and stared at nothing. The anger he’d felt when Scott pulled his gun on Cas was still running hot and heavy in his veins echoing the blinding rage he’d felt when the Mark of Cain was on his arm.
“Thank you, Sam,” Mary said.
ridiculous?” Dean asked. “Then why did you ask him to dance if you didn’t want to sleep with him, huh?”
Cas sighed dramatically. “I guess that can be arranged.”
Dean opened his arms and tugged at Castiel’s shoulder.
“I didn’t know that,” Dean said. “And here I thought the only movies you watched were the ones I forced you to sit through.”
He could walk to Baby and sleep in the backseat. Maybe even drive her back to their other motel rooms in Prescott an hour away. Sam would understand why he had to leave. As long as Dean made it back here to pick everyone up in the morning it would be fine.
Dean turned so his nose was brushing against Cas’s. His throat clicked as he struggled to find his voice again.
Sam raised his eyebrows and picked up his menu.
Dean’s breath caught in his chest. Lights from the stage reflected on Cas’s cheekbones, nose, lips.
“At least one of us could,” Dean said under his breath.
Memories of a pair of waitresses he’d hooked up with a few years back came to mind. The skin on his neck felt hypersensitive and he remembered the sensation of their soft kisses, wet tongues, and sharp teeth as they’d given him a pair of matching hickies below his pulse points.
“I can’t leave. I’m trapped in this nightmare,” Dillon said. He began to fly in sporadic lines. First left, then right. Over Dean and Castiel then closer to the screen and back again. “A nightmare. Not a dream at all. No more dreaming. An endless nightmare.”
Dean frowned.
“You don’t have to stop watching because of me,” Cas said. “I believe there is more to the movie after the credits start.”
Dean shook his head and cupped Castiel’s cheek.
Sam tapped his pen against his notebook. Maybe if he made enough noise one of them would notice that he was still in the room. Or maybe he could slip out the door and rent himself a separate room before whatever weird tension they had building between them snapped and Sam was left mentally scarred for life.
Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean’s attention drifted to the table where he’d kissed Cas earlier then he turned away abruptly.
He reached under the driver’s seat and felt around for the bottle of lube he had tucked away in a custom pouch he’d added in a few restorations ago. There was condoms and lube hidden in a couple other well-concealed places in the car that Sam probably didn’t know about. Part of him wished he’d thought to stash a toy or two in the car too, but he didn’t want to push his luck with how observant his brother was or wasn’t lately.
The lights flickered again and the angel disappeared.
“Mom called while I was in line,” Sam said. “I told her we were working a case, and she offered to meet us here in the morning, too.”
“When I realized that Cas had taught me how to have faith,” Dean said. “I’m still not religious and I don’t know about God, but I know who the people are in my life I can trust to be there for me. I have faith that those people care about me regardless of all this glitz and pageantry.”
Sam nodded.
“I do too,” Dean said.
“Sam is driving your car,” Castiel said as he closed the back door and opened the front passenger one. Dean started to sputter in protest, but was silenced when Castiel turned his glare on Dean. Castiel motioned for the orderly to wheel Dean over to the open door. Dean stood up from the wheelchair, but froze in place as he contemplated the pros and cons of walking back to the motel from here. “Get in the damn car, Dean.”
It was a little embarrassing, even in his current state, how long it took him to recognize the music playing from the car stereo. That had nothing to do with the fact that Dean kept the Impala’s old stereo speakers as close to the stock ones from when she was new as possible every time he rebuilt her which kept her sound quality pretty low. There were more speakers of different sizes in this newer car that made different parts of the music audible. Just because the Impala’s stereo couldn’t handle the different tones meant nothing.
“It’s worth looking into,” Dean said. “We’ve already run into a few others who didn’t follow the rules recently.”
“You cut right to the chase, don’t you?” Scott asked.
“I can try to heal you,” Cas said.
Cas carefully carried the coffee mug over to Dean’s table. Dean was too preoccupied with staring at the bottle like a sailor watching the shore.
Other times he was so sad he could barely move. He ached for people he didn’t remember. He ached for the version of himself he didn’t remember. And, again, he wondered why no one had looked for him. He wondered what he could have done to make himself so unloved that no one would search for him when he was so obviously lost.
“Whatever you say,” Mary said before taking another sip of her coffee.
“Is that really what you think happened?” Dean asked.
How many times had Dean’s actions laid his feelings for Cas bare? If Dean was able to put words out loud to any of it, would Cas still be here? Was Cas saying the same things with every touch, each heavy
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said. He stared at the angel with a lump in his throat. It would be so easy to lean in and pull him into a hug or a kiss. Or to reach out and take his hand. It was easier to do nothing, though. So nothing is what he did. He cleared his throat and took a step back. “Follow me to the motel.”
“No,” Cas said with a confused frown.
“Do what?” Dean asked.
There was a challenge written in Cas's angry eyes. A challenge and an ultimatum. Mary’s words about needing to make a choice echoed in Dean’s head.
“I’ll see you in the morning, Cas,” Dean said. “Drive safe.”
“How did you and Dillon meet?” Dean asked.
Dean held up a hand. “Look, what my partner is trying to say—.”
“Leaving me again?” Dean asked, because he apparently had no filter when he’d just woken up.
By the time the last of the bloopers faded to black Dean’s mood had improved dramatically.
Dean narrowed his eyes. It looked like both of the men were armed. He turned to look around the theater. From where he was sitting, it didn’t look like there were any other guards. That didn’t mean he wasn’t missing them, though.
A few hours of shut eye was all he needed right then. He’d just finished a quick and dirty haunting case by himself in Columbus and was on his way to meet Sam and Eileen in upstate New York.
“Go ahead and get dressed.” She pointed to the duffle sitting on a chair below the window that Sam brought by earlier that day. “I’ll send someone in with a wheelchair and your discharge paperwork soon.”
Sam waved a hand at Dean in response before taking his place in line. Sam started up a conversation with a couple of women in front of him in line. Dean grinned.
He stared at Castiel’s face. Took in the pinched, troubled wrinkle between his brows and the glassiness of his blue eyes. Dean’s chest ached.
“Dean, if that dog walker didn’t realize how lucky she was to meet you and have a chance to get to know then she was clearly an idiot,” Castiel said. “And anyone in this bar, or any bar, would turn you down is a fool. Anyone would be lucky to have you, Dean. You’re an incredible person and if other people can’t see it that’s on them.”
Cas’s lips spread into a sad smile.
Cas rolled his eyes in an overly dramatic way that had Dean laughing for the first time in weeks. Maybe even months.
“It helps to have a partner who knows what they’re doing,” Dean said. “Let me guess. He kept stepping on your feet?”
When Cas came back into the infirmary, he was stubbornly carrying five things at once. The sight made Dean laugh and then immediately regret that decision when it made his ribs ache.
talk to us directly.” She flicked her attention to Mary for a moment then back to Sam. “If you’re having conversations with angels and God, maybe you should try speaking to someone with more… education on the subject than myself. A doctor, perhaps.”
At least he wasn’t in a dark enough place to wish that Castiel had never pulled him from Hell today.
Eventually, they pulled away from each other. The air in the room felt thick and pulled bowstring tight.
“Ouch, fuck,” Dean groaned. He let his weight rest on Cas’s thighs, and his forehead found a home in the curve of Cas’s collarbone. “Fucking ribs.”
“Cas, I…” Dean didn’t know what to say.
“I missed you too, Dean,” Cas said.
“Agents Jones and Rollins,” Dean said. “We’d like to ask you a few questions about a friend of yours who recently passed away. A Mr. Dillon Bonner?”
Dean let go of Cas again and put his hands back on the door. He studied the floor between them then looked up into Cas's eyes.
“There’s no face,” Sam said.
Castiel’s wings fluttered a bit in happiness as he stared at the reader.
“I don’t,” Dean said too harshly. He held up a hand. “I mean, I never want you to risk yourself. But I also want you to stay, and I’m… I want to finish this conversation now while I still have the nerve to do it.”
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“Cas?” Dean asked, his voice sounded like he’d been on a bender.
“Is there anything else I can help you guys with?” Scott asked after he’d composed himself.
“I was wondering if you love this bed or Baby more.”
, anyway?” Dean asked. “I don’t remember that movie being very family friendly.”
“Guess what, Sam,” Dean said. “They may not know what a ghost looks like, but we do. And that? That looks like a fucking ghost.”
“Think of it like we’re in a fight,” Dean said.
Those words echoed through his mind as Dean fell asleep with Castiel in his arms.
“Yes Dean, every time it’s playing on TV in one of the motels you make me watch it again.”
“You’re such a jerk,” Sam said between panting breaths.
For the first time, Dean wondered just how long the angel had watched him while he’d jerked off this time. They’d had a few close calls over the years, but this was the first time Dean had for sure been in the middle of a solo session when Cas showed up. Dean wondered how long Cas would have watched without saying anything. If he would have started to touch himself while watching Dean.
Castiel climbed the stairs until he reached the row of seats Dean was at. Dean stared at him with his eyebrows raised and held out the EMF reader he’d made while Sam was in college. Castiel accepted the reader with gentle hands. Dean made light of the fact that he’d built such a tool, but Castiel knew how proud of it the human was and that it was one of his favorite possessions. If Castiel held the reader at a certain angle, he could see the reflection of Dean’s soul soldered in between the circuits and wires. Dean’s Impala was much the same.
The fight seemed to last only a few seconds. Their captors were caught off guard by Dean's attack. They were obviously lulled into complacency by Dean and Cas not fighting back for weeks.
“Watch your fucking mouth,” Dean said.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean. His fingers dug into the thin fabric of Dean’s work uniform t-shirt. His beard was soft and rough against Dean’s temple. “I always come back to you, Dean.”
“What?” Dean asked.
They exchanged a quick kiss.
Dillon’s attention snapped toward Castiel. He pinned Castiel in place with his ghostly gaze.
“I’m telling you, it was a body,” said the first college kid. She had dark hair and a deep, natural tan. She wore a sweatshirt with the local college’s logo on it. “It was all burnt up and gross.”
Or five.
“It was fine,” Dean said.
Today marked a full nine months had passed since Dean woke up cold, alone, and confused in the park with a flashlight shining in his eyes and no clue what his own name was. Every time another month passed, Dean reacted a little differently. Sometimes he was angry that no one came looking for him. Wasn’t he missed by anyone?
Dean turned his head enough to look at his brother. Sam’s mouth bobbed open and closed like a gasping fish for a moment before he pointed behind himself.
“Do you know who is in charge of the festival?” Sam asked. “Is it a private party or a local church? We’d like to talk with the organizers.”
“Sam, does the lore say how to stop it?” Cas asked.
“It’s so much more than a clothing store,” Cas said. He spared Dean a brief glance before returning to his study of the store. “I can see furniture and toys and shelves filled with cassette tapes. There’s even a poster on the wall over there that would look good in The Dean Cave.”
Between the heads, Dean was able to see the bottom of the movie theater screen. There was a man standing in front of the screen. With the poor film quality, it was pretty hard to make out details. The man could be in a costume or a ghost or a lively cardboard cutout for all Dean could tell. He seemed to be ranting at the audience and Dean couldn’t make out what he was saying. The audience started to boo the ranting man. A flash of white light filled the screen, followed by screams.
“I’m on the baseball team at school and every morning I go for a jog from the house Jenny and I rent downtown over to the park and back,” Sarah said. “This morning when I got to the park it felt… weird. Which, I know, sounds crazy, but it’s true.”
Dean opened the hotel room door and froze.
They would never know what really happened to get Ricky and Carolynn to go so far to help Kushiel as he killed people and trapped angels, but Castiel hoped they’d both found their peace now.
Cas’s stare roved over Dean’s face like a spotlight in the night.
“She was fine. Pretty, nice, respectable,” Dean said. “I think she was a veterinarian or a dog walker or something. She was definitely more like Sam’s type than mine. A nice girl who loves animals and lives in a safe little bubble. I don’t know why Sam thought we’d get along very well. A messy cop with a perfect suburban lady like that.”
He killed the phone call application and opened up his text messages out of habit. Cas still hadn’t replied to the message Dean sent earlier that day. It wasn’t anything that required a response, just a quick check-in, but the radio silence bothered him in ways he didn’t want to study too closely. A small part of him had believed that, after nearly dying from Michael’s lance, Cas would have stuck around for a little while. Especially after everything he’d said while dying.
Dean turned toward the voice and froze in place. It was the tall, long haired guy from his dreams. The man looked just as shocked as Dean did. The tray started to shake in Dean’s hands. He grabbed the coffee mugs and water glass and hurriedly set them on the table to keep them from falling to the floor.
The good part about rewatching a movie you knew and loved was Dean knew exactly when everything would happen and could repeat every corny line. The bad part about rewatching a favorite movie is he knew everything that was going to happen so his mind wandered a lot.
“Special occasion jeans?” Cas asked.
With a soft sigh, Dean let himself fall forward until his forehead was pressed against Cas’s chest. Here, cupped in Cas’s warmth, everything felt better. Safe.
Dean grunted a negative response, clenching his teeth. Sam didn’t need to know about the aborted texts Dean had written out and deleted over the last few days. Texts like
A woman in the row behind them shushed Dean, making him roll his eyes once more.
Sarah rolled her eyes. She looked at Sam and pointed her thumb at Jenny.
“How are we going to handle today?” Mary asked.
“What happened?” Cas asked.
“C’mere, Cas,” Dean said. He opened his arms and motioned for the angel to come down the stairs.
“I didn’t say that,” Dean said as he gaped at Cas. He turned back to Sam and shook his head. “I never said that.”
“Listen to your master,” Scott said to Dean with a sneer.
Most of the room was taken up by rows of tiered seating with chairs that folded up. The walls were covered with folded fabrics and small lights to make it easier to navigate in the darkness. They reminded Castiel of the emergency lights in the bunker. At the front of the theater was a large, white wall. It looked very different from the television Sam had in his room. Castiel couldn’t figure out how one would watch movies on it.
“What does the lore say?” Dean asked.
Thoughts of Dean made him frown as he looked around the bar. The text he’d received from his best friend was jumbled and felt off in tone. Castiel knew Dean was supposed to be on a date tonight with someone Sam knew from work. Dean’s remorseful text implied the date did not go well.
For the next few minutes the library was silent, save for the flipping of old book pages and Dean shifting his weight in his chair.
“Are you sure you don’t want to wait until the others are back home?”
Dean’s breath hitched.
familiar for some reason on Chris’s desk. It wasn’t until Danny stopped by with lunch for his husband that Dean realized why the picture had looked familiar.
Dean gripped the mattress edge tighter.
into Dean’s ear until his breath normalized and color returned to the world around them.
“Dillon?” Castiel asked. Dillon didn’t react to Castiel speaking. He kept flying and muttering to himself. “We want to help you. Duma?”
Cas reached out and placed his hand on the small of Dean’s back. Dean’s heart leapt into his throat and stayed lodged there as he stared into Cas’s bright blue eyes. One deep breath from either of them would make their chests brush against each other.
“No.” Dean shook his head hard enough that the dungeon started to swim a bit in his vision. “No, that’s not possible because I told you not to.”
“That or they’re worried this angel is connected to a potential spree killer or something,” Sam said. “We’ll have to be careful tonight.”
“I didn’t run away.”
“You sure you don’t want to go back to the motel to ice your back?” Sam asked. “I don’t think Mom and Cas would mind meeting us there.”
Dean waved a hand at the ranting angel preaching to the crowd of believers kneeling at his feet. He could make out the individual folds of the fabric lined walls behind the angel thanks to the overhead lights in the theater. The angel flapped his wings and rose into the air above the crowd. Dean could see the lights and speakers on the walls of the theater through the angel as the angel flew around.
“That shouldn't have been surprising,” Cas said. “We found out quickly how much the warding suppressed my grace. Why did today make you fight back?”
The former angel was staring around the warehouse sized store turned thrift store with a wide-eyed awe that reminded Dean of Jack. Not for the first time, Dean wondered if that kid hadn’t managed to steal some of Cas’s attributes in the womb when he and Kelly hijacked Cas’s life for a few weeks.
The light in Baby was low, even with a full moon outside, but Dean could still see the twitch at the corner of Cas’s lips as he looked from Dean’s face to Dean’s obvious erection.
“Get the hell out of my house,” Scott said. “I won’t ask again.”
“We’ve gotta find the—”
Castiel nodded. “Okay.”
His cock twitched in his jeans. All he wanted to do was catch some sleep, but his body had other things in mind.
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asked.
The next hour passed in a blur. Another beer showed up when the whiskey was gone. He kept checking the crowd for tan trenchcoats. There was a well-worn miserable pit in his stomach that made itself known whenever his crowd searching came up short. He had to keep forcing himself to watch the band or check out the waitress.
Castiel had never been inside a movie theater. During his brief time spent as a human he couldn’t afford the luxury of it, and as a fully powered angel in the millennia prior, the novelty was foreign to him.
needing a break. Please, just go. Take the night off. Call your angel.”
Cas looked at Dean for confirmation. Dean nodded.
Cas tilted his head.
“I’d like to redeem that raincheck now,” Cas said in a quiet voice.
“We can’t,” Cas said. “Not that I’ve ever heard of anyway.”
Cas stared into Dean’s eyes with the kind of intensity Dean had only found in this one specific angel. An annoying little voice in the back of Dean’s head, one that was getting louder and louder lately, urged him to close the distance between them. That was the thing, Cas wasn’t just Dean’s dorky little best friend. He was the guy Dean was madly, stupidly in love with. The guy Dean wanted to keep this close at all times. Close enough to feel his own breath reflect off of Cas’s skin while stupid butterflies the size of demigods fluttered around in his stomach.
“You made him a mixtape,” Sam asked with a grin. That was definitely the kind of blackmail material he was going to put into the group chat. Jody and the girls would never let Dean hear the end of it. Neither would Rowena and Eileen.
“I’ll make it up to your later,” Dean said to him.
“I had a smoothie before my run,” Sam said. It was a lie, but it was better than admitting what he’d accidentally seen. If Dean wanted to talk about it, that was fine, but Sam knew better than to initiate that kind of conversation with his brother.
Scott’s throat bobbed.
“Fine, you want to learn how to dance?” Dean asked. He took hold of Cas's arm and led him back to their room. “Let’s dance, then.”
He let go of the counter and wrapped his arms around Cas’s incorporeal body. Cas’s fingers slid to the back of Dean’s head and neck, curling into his hair and the collar of his robe as Dean leaned forward to press his forehead against Cas’s.
Sam closed his eyes. He was getting a headache. “Wait, so you’re trying to tell me you’ve been hooking up with guys this whole time?”
Dean rubbed at his chest. Why did he even bother coming to the hotel? He should have left in Baby when he had the chance. He stood up and grabbed his duffel bag.
“Why don’t you try calling Cas again?” Sam said. “I’ll get the tickets. You’ll feel better after you check in with him anyway.”
“Well, that list of movies looks cheerful,” Dean said.
“Yeah, I guess so,” Dean said.
Dean shook his head.
Dean looked up to find their waiter standing next to the table. He was in his mid-twenties and was one of those scrawny looking white guys that ended up looking more muscular and solid the closer you got to him. He wore thick, black-rimmed glasses that highlighted his amber eyes.
Dean was still asleep in their room. Castiel had moved into Dean’s old room when they returned from Arizona at Dean’s insistence. Other than a few times when they annoyed each other to the point where they were tempted to strangle one another, things had gone smoothly between them since then.
He and Sam moved to the aisle and started to make their way to the stairs leading to the back of the theater. A crowd of people begging forgiveness and holding outstretched hands toward the angel stood between them and the angel.
“Beyonce again?” Dean asked as he settled into a chair across from Castiel. “I thought you were working your way through the Baroque period of classical music or some shit?”
“It wasn’t fun,” Cas said.
They danced. They drank. They kissed. They fell into the other man’s bed at the end of the night. It wasn’t until morning, when sunlight spilled through the man’s curtains that the annoying voice in Dean’s head spoke again.
was a depressing movie to watch when it first came out. One of the girls Dean was seeing at the time insisted they watch it in the theater together. Now, after the time he and Sam had both spent in Hell and Heaven, the movie hit too close to home. Dean didn’t bother being subtle about wiping his eyes after a while. He was glad Cas wasn’t here to watch the film’s interpretation of Heaven or Robin’s journey into Hell to save his wife’s soul. This movie wasn’t one he planned to add to their own angel movie marathon. Making them both depressed didn’t sound fun.
Remember my "there's no major character death in this fic" tag? Yeah, this chapter is the fix-it for the end of that last scene. I'm so sorry. The season finale made me change some of my plans around for the better with this story.
Dean blinked hard and only realized he was shaking his head when Cas’s fingers tightened to hold him still.
It was only after Kushiel’s possession was revealed that Ashley realized her mother’s relapse into cruelty was caused by the angel. According to Dillon, she felt guilty that she hadn’t paid closer attention to her mother’s actions and done something to help her. Ashley spent a lot of her time avoiding conversations about her mother and stepfather now. The only person she would occasionally talk about was Ricky.
“You…” Cas returned his attention to Dean. Or maybe it was on Dean’s shoulder. Dean glanced down to see if there was anything notable going on there, but found only goo. Man, he’d liked this jacket.
He felt warm all over like he always did when Castiel did ridiculous, thoughtful things like this. He closed his eyes and let the song wash over him. It was one that always reminded him of Castiel. Sometimes in reinforced his bitter thoughts toward the angel, other times it echoed his heart breaking, today it motivated him to help Castiel get his grace back so his angel could fly again.
Castiel sighed and opened his eyes again. He looked somewhere in the vicinity of Dean’s chin, but at least Dean could see his eyes.
It was Dean’s turn to flip his brother off and he managed to do it without breaking the kiss with his angel.
Different voices called out his name in his memories—even those he’d never given his real first name to--high pitched voices, breathy voices, scratchy voices, deep voices all blended together until they started to sound like one specific voice.
They said their goodbyes and headed inside.
“I hope so,” Cas said. He glared at the list of names in his hand. “Talking to people is exhausting.”
“Dillon had a… complicated relationship with religion and God,” Scott said. “He was a believer, but his belief was very pessimistic and lost. One time he got drunk while we were on leave and ranted for an hour about God abandoning us and how following orders was too difficult and cold blooded sometimes.”
“After you’ve slept and recovered more. If you still want to know then…” Cas took a deep breath he didn’t really need, his expression turned almost mournful. “We’ll talk then.”
“Seriously, Dean?” Sam asked as he held up a bag of pork rinds.
Dean got out of the car. He was wrong about the heat before, it wasn’t like an oven, with the drought it was more like an open oven in the middle of the desert in the summer.
Dean didn’t get the chance to see the tape Cas had pulled from the bag because someone in a large van tried merging into Baby’s passenger side. Dean honked the horn and swore up a storm while he successfully avoided an accident. He was still bitching under his breath when Sam ejected the Styx album from Baby’s tape deck and put in the tape Cas had found.
Classic rock love songs blasted through the old speakers from the jukebox in the corner. Castiel smiled to himself when he realized he recognized the song as one of Dean’s favorites.
Dean stared in awe.
Dean closed his eyes. Of course.
“Wait, where the hell are we?” Sam asked from the passenger seat. He’d finally pulled out his earbuds and was looking around the parking lot with a furrowed brow.
Dean felt the ghost of a smile tug at his mouth.
Cas sighed and blinked lazily at Dean. “You know why.”
“Oh,” Cas said again, stronger this time in a voice filled with wonder and joy. “I love you too, Dean.”
“Great,” Joyce said. “Table of three down at the end. I gave them their menus already.”
, Dean did most of the talking. He leaned deep into Cas’s space while he told Cas stories about the songs the band was playing. Factoids he’d picked up over the years about dead family members from the original bands inspiring music. He told Cas about the songs inspired by Lord of the Rings. Another that was written as a love letter to another man’s new bride who eventually left her new husband for the song writer.
until Castiel was able to ignore the blood stains on Dean’s shirt long enough to nod and get into the Impala.
“Seems obvious after the fact, right?” Dean asked with a wink.”But you’re right. I realized I was approaching Jimmy and his struggle in a disrespectful way. I wasn’t giving his situation the reverence it deserved. And Cas helped me figure out why that was.”
Dean’s eyes burned hot as Cas reached up to cup Dean’s cheeks. The chilly touch on his skin further confirmed that this was his own worst nightmare come to life before his eyes. Dean stared into Cas’s blue eyes, faded as they were in this form.
?” Sam asked.
Castiel flinched like he’d been struck.
They approached the circle of people.
Cas stood on the other side with his own room key in one hand. It looked like he’d been fidgeting with it for a while.
Dean finally pulled back far enough that he could get a long look at those blue eyes he’d missed like an amputated limb. The skin around Cas’s eyes folded as the angel smiled back him. Dean’s breath hitched in his chest.
“You feel amazing, Cas,” Dean said as he rolled his hips up to grind himself against Cas.
“He hurt his back last night when we went back to the theater,” Sam said.
Cas shifted the dress to the side and stepped into Dean’s space. He shook his head and gave Dean a quick kiss. “You’re sweet, Dean.”
“I’ll take a coffee, too,” Dean said. “Thanks.”
“That’s disgusting,” Sam said. “You need to take better care of yourself.”
He cleared his throat.
They kissed again. Long, lingering and deep.
Dean moved his right arm from around Cas's lower back so that it was curled around Cas's shoulders instead. He turned their left hands so their positions were reversed. Dean’s breath stilled in his lungs when Cas wrapped his arm around Dean’s lower back and tugged Dean close enough for their chests to touch.
Weeks passed. Nightmares continued to wake Dean up in cold sweats chasing his breath.
Dean squinted at the reflection in the rear view mirror. The orb was throwing sickly green shadows all over Cas’s face, emphasizing the concerned frown he wore.
“I can’t leave,” Dillon said.
over and over against each other’s skin. They shared breath. They traded pleasure as their bodies moved together slowly and of their own accord, kissing through it all as they both came in their boxers. They stripped each other of their soiled clothes and traced the lines of their bodies with fingertips, palms, and lips.
Mary looked at Sam with a questioning expression. Sam cleared his throat and sipped his coffee.
“Honestly, Agent Wolfgang? A whole lot of nothing,” Detective Baum said. “Naked dead guy with his eyes burned out, and so far no weapons, fingerprints, or footprints explaining how he got to where he was found.”
The doors leading into the theater opened and the woman leading the prayer circle ended her sermon. She led the crowd toward the open doors. Dean held up a hand as he moved into her path to get her attention. She looked him up and down before slowing to a stop.
“I can’t believe someone torched a guy in our town,” the second kid said. Her blonde hair swished over her tattooed shoulders as she shook her head in disbelief.
Dean looked away. Maybe if he talked to their captors he could convince them that Cas didn’t deserve to be here. They could let him go so Dean didn’t have to watch him die again. So Dean could know that Cas was out there somewhere safe and alive.
Sam called the woman behind the film festival and set up a meeting while Mary got cleaned up. He decided to work the writing research angle. The woman sounded intrigued and suggested they meet at a nearby cafe.
“Hi, I’m Dean, this is my brother Sam,” Dean said, gesturing at Sam next to him. “We were passing through and thought we’d check out this film festival. Did you say an angel showed up here last weekend?”
He made his way down the stairs and proceeded toward the kitchen. Light and shadows poured through the doorway letting him know someone was up and moving around in there. It was probably Dean.
Anger burned hot in Castiel’s chest as he watched his best friend verbally kick himself while he was down. Dean’s opinion of himself was awful, it always had been from the stories he’d heard from Dean’s family and friends, but it always got worse when he was sad about something. Few things made Castiel angrier than listening to Dean speak ill of himself.
lips and all the way down her legs. Legs she’d wrapped around him multiple times from multiple angles during their night and morning together.
The question disappeared as Dean pulled Cas into a deep kiss.
, which they already knew. Next weekend was a Robin Williams movie called
Would they ever get the chance to put these little moments into real words or tangible actions? Would it all fall apart around them if they did? Dean couldn’t lose this. Having stray pieces of Cas was better than none of him at all.
“Okay,” Cas said.
need a break from
“Are y’all locals or just passing through?” Ricky asked. The question was posed to the table at large, but Ricky only had eyes for Cas.
“Fuck,” he said, followed by a drawn out moan as his grip tightened.
“I keep in touch with the ones who aren’t raging homophobes,” Sam said. “I still don’t understand why you thought he’d have any relevant answers.”
Dean turned to her and grinned, shaking his head. “No, not at all. What happened instead is I met someone who challenged me. Who called me out when I was…”
“Do you want to leave?” Dean asked. His voice came out smaller, quieter than he meant it to.
He hung up the phone before he could say anything embarrassing like how quiet the bunker was without Cas stalking around it. Or how the guest bedroom kept getting dusty and the bed had stopped smelling like Cas days ago. That would be admitting to too much. Admitting to the fact that he’d gotten into the habit of taking stress naps in there when Cas didn’t answer his phone for a few days at a time or when a nightmare of Cas dying on that ugly couch woke him up screaming.
They both knew Cas’s grace wasn’t up to healing Dean at the moment. Not since Chuck had started fucking with Cas from a distance. And with Jack out of town with Sam and Eileen, that left Dean needing regular first aid.
“No, the only reason he came here was because of me. Dillon always insisted he was from everywhere and when you’re from ‘everywhere’ you don’t really have anywhere to go home to when you’re done fighting in a war. So, he came home with me,” Scott said. His expression grew distant and fond. “When he wanted to be a pain in the ass, which was often, he’d tell people they should ask him
Dean started the engine as Sam slid into the passenger seat. Sam pulled out the drinks and snacks they’d picked out to eat on the road. Dean shook his head when Sam tried to pass Dean his bag of pork rinds.
Cas hummed.
“Nine years, eight months, and twenty-seven days,” Cas said.
They drank until Dean’s limbs were loose and warm. Until the smile on Cas’s face turned gummy and rosy-cheeked.
That kiss was years in the making, regardless of the token protests Dean had put up when Cas first appeared in the backseat. He’d been longing to feel Cas just like this, pressed up against him, for a long time.
“Why does the FBI care?” Scott asked. “Was there something more to his death than what the police told me?”
Castiel turned away and started fussing with the duffel bag. Dean opened his mouth then dropped his head again when he couldn't find anything more than angry words on his tongue. Castiel’s shoulders curled forward. He stood there motionless with his hands buried in the duffle.
anything about his obvious feelings for the angel was another matter entirely.
The longer he tried to ignore his growing hardness, the more that his subconscious accosted him with memories of past lovers. Echoes of fingernails and teeth dragging over the most sensitive parts of his skin. Ghosts of different mouths pressing kisses against his neck, collarbone, nipples, hipbones, and everywhere in between.
Dean moved the rest of his food to the floor and started to stand up when he realized the people on either side of him and Sam were bent forward in their seats. Each had their hands clasped in prayer on the seatbacks in front of them. Whispered words of prayer were barely audible over the sound from the theater speakers around them.
Scott lifted his shirt pulled out a gun from an inner pants holster Dean hadn’t seen then pointed it at Cas. Dean had his gun out and pointed at Scott before he realized he was doing it.
Silence came from Cas’s end of the call. Silence that was deep enough and long enough that Dean pulled the phone away from his ear to make sure the call hadn’t dropped.
It was Cas’s turn to look caught off guard and self conscious. “I sometimes come in here to watch movies while you and Sam sleep. The program keeps track of the most watched movies. Those are the ones I watch most of the time, to try to understand your movie references better.”
“Coffee would be wonderful,” Cas said after giving Dean a sideways glance.
“Me?” Cas asked in a voice so soft it was barely a whisper.
Dean and Sam looked at each other. Sam raised his eyebrows.
“What?” Cas whispered back.
killed again.”
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean said, shaking his head.
“How?” Castiel asked as they reached the stairs. He looked over his shoulder at Dean and shook his head. “How can you wake him?”
In years past, Dean had fucked around with a few guys. Mostly quick restroom hookups or threesomes with frisky girls involved too. Years ago, he came to accept that he was attracted to men, women, and other people that didn’t fit into such narrow definitions—like the angel in his arms. This was the first time Dean had done something as bland and normal as dancing with another guy, though. Sure it was in the privacy of their motel room with the door locked and curtains drawn, but it made something in him settle and ache for opportunities he’d missed out on over the years under the guise of protecting himself.
Castiel rolled his eyes.
Dean scoffed. “Are you kidding? You could stand up right now, announce you were single and ready to mingle in the middle of this bar and have ten people clobbering each other for a chance with you.”
The bunker was silent. Three am when everyone you knew and loved were dead and gone had that kind of effect on a place. At least, Dean assumed it was three in the morning. He hadn't bothered to charge his phone in days so the battery was long since dead. The old analog clock on the wall read three and that was farther than Dean cared to know for certain.
“This is very pleasurable,” Cas said as he continued to dry hump Dean.
“We could say he’s connected to another case,” Dean said.
Sam and Mary waved back and approached the woman’s table.
Cas rolled his eyes.
“It's not your f—”
“So Sam,” Mary said. “What’s going on with this case? You mentioned you and Dean went back to the theater last night, but you didn’t say what happened.”
“When I met Cas I had no faith. Not just in a higher power or something like that, but in anyone. My childhood was difficult and I basically raised my brother when I should have been worrying about Saturday morning cartoons instead. I learned from a young age that I couldn’t rely on anyone but myself to take care of what needed to get done. Eventually I figured out how to use these looks of mine to support my brother and I with acting.”
Later, when Sam was reasonably sure he wasn’t about to walk into his brother’s apparent honeymoon phase again, Sam returned to the kitchen.
Cas met Dean’s eyes with a small smile. He looked uninjured and tired. Tension Dean didn’t know he was holding in melted from his shoulders.
Dean grimaced.
Sam approached the college kids and pulled out his FBI badge.
Cas opened his mouth like he was going to speak then looked over Dean’s shoulder. Cas’s eyes shifted like he was watching something that wasn’t in the room with them. He straightened his posture and lifted his chin. For a moment, Dean swore he could see Cas’s wings lifting high and wide behind him. Cas met Dean’s eyes again.
Cas's smiling eyes sparked in the dim light from the old bedside lamp. The skin around his eyes folded as more of his teeth showed. Their movements were quick. Cas's feet matched Dean’s movements beat for beat. As the song came to an end, Dean pulled Cas close and dipped him. They both laughed at Cas's shock.
“Did you try everything on yet?” Sam asked.
“Because of you and Sam and mom,” Dean said. “Because of the people we save and the people we…” Dean swallowed. “And the people we couldn’t save. The people we got killed. I owe it to all of you, to all of them to keep going. Sometimes I forget that or that answer stops working and I lose my way, but you and Sam. You guys are always there to help me find my way back.”
“Okay,” Sam said, drawing out the word.
“That’s a lie,” Cas said. “The last person who walked in on you having sex was the female roommate of a man you went home with at a bar three months ago and you both invited her to join in.”
“What did I miss?” Dean asked.
Castiel leaned forward so their forehead’s were touching. Dean didn’t know which of them moved first to intertwine their fingers. Castiel let go of Dean’s hospital gown and reached up to cup the side of Dean’s neck. His thumb rubbed against Dean’s jaw with a touch so soft you could only call it a caress.
“Dean,” Cas said. “I need to know.”
Cas rolled his eyes and carefully draped the shirts over his forearm again. “They make good music, Dean. Just because you insist on listening to music from when your parents were dating doesn’t mean their music isn’t good too.”
Did Dean kidnap these people once upon a time? Did he hurt them? What happened in the back of that car? Did it even exist?
Once he was settled into one of the two recliners, with his bounty occupying the other one, he turned on the tv and the computer Charlie had loaded up with movies and tv shows for them. He scrolled through the list of movie genres. His cursor hovered over the action movie tab for a moment. He glanced at the door leading out of the cave. It was locked. That meant no one would come by to interrupt him. No one would have to see the movie he chose.
At the base of the stairs, the crowd grew thick and unmoving enough that the only way for Dean and Sam to get through was to make a scene. Movement on Dean’s right brought his attention to the security guards with guns approaching the crowd with wide, nervous eyes. It was probably best not to provoke anyone if they didn’t need to, Dean thought.
Dean’s cheeks heated as he stared back at her.
Dean tugged on Cas’s hand and leaned into Cas’s space. “What do you think so far?”
“Help me to my room?” Dean asked. It was amazing that he could talk with his heart lodged in his throat like it was.
“Who are you texting?” Dean asked.
Dean and Cas pulled out their FBI badges.
Castiel frowned for a moment before remembering his pet project of listening to as many different types of music as he could get his hands on. He was hopping around from genre to genre on the music streaming service Sam had set up for him. So far, he kept ending up drifting back to modern, motivational pop music more than anything else. Much to Dean’s chagrin.
“That’s bullshit and you know it, Dean,” Castiel said in the deep, threatening tone he usually saved for threatening demons before he ran them through with his angel blade. “It is not your job to die.”
He stood up long enough to turn before settling into the wheelchair. He hated these things, but he’d spent more than enough of his lifetime in hospital beds across the country. He’d learned long ago that if they couldn’t sneak out of the hospital without anyone noticing and had to wait for an official discharge from the staff that the exit had to happen in a wheelchair. It wasn’t worth fighting over anymore.
Even in his madness Dean was still a coward.
Dean closed his eyes and turned into Castiel’s touch.
Agent name references:
“Yes,” Cas said.
“Was he from Arizona?” Dean asked. “Did he grow up near here?”
When the kissing slowed down to a more languid, sleepy pace, their fingers found each other and intertwined. They fell asleep tangled together as close as their souls had always begged them to be.
Dean snapped the magazine shut and shoved it back on the shelf. He could feel his cheeks heat as he pushed the basket of supplies at Sam.
“Tell me,” Dean whispered.
A head wound. That explained a few things. Like the twitchy in-and-out-of-focus shape of his memories of fighting the ghost. And why he was letting Cas play nursemaid without bitching about it or making a thousand jokes to cut through his own urge to grab Cas by the tie and kiss him stupid.
“What the hell, Cas?”
Dean didn’t realize he’d let go of Cas’s hand and wandered away until he felt the cool glass of the jewelry counter beneath his hands. A bored teenager in an oversized sweater with purple streaks in their dark hair sat behind the counter scrolling through something on their cell phone. He cleared his throat, trying to get the teenager’s attention. When the teenager rolled their eyes up from the phone screen to look at Dean, he smiled and pointed at the poster.
Luck must have been on Dean’s side that night because when they reached the motel the Impala was parked out front and within hours their duffle bags were packed and that locker room and Sam’s nosy questions were left behind them forever.
“Thanks,” Dean said.
Dean stared back at him, dumbfounded. Yes, he remembered watching Mary knock Lucifer into the alternate world and get drug through the door herself just as it was closing, but that wasn’t what hurt him so bad he’d repressed the memory of who he was. That wasn’t what made him run across the country to escape the pain.
Dean chuckled and tilted his head so that Castiel’s hair was no longer trying to climb into his mouth and nose. Dean wrapped one arm around Castiel’s upper back. The other he wrapped beneath Castiel’s head so his fingers could resume carding through Castiel’s hair.
The dull humming coming from the orb grew louder and higher pitched. Dean winced and tried to lean away from the noise as he drove.
Sam hung back while Cas brought the plate to Dean and set it on the table.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean said. “You don't really think you're the only one who's in love here, right?”
“And what, Dean?”
“How are you two even worse now that you’re together?” Sam asked.
“Seems that way,” Sam said. “Some of the tweets explained what the guy was saying.” He picked up the page of messages, or tweets Dean guessed they were called. Sam scanned over the page before he found what he was looking for. “Okay, here it is. ‘Blasphemy. Michael is mad. Michael is gone. We’re fallen and lost. Blasphemy.’”
“What about you and Sam?” Cas asked. “I got your message about the case. Did you make it to Arizona yet?”
The kiss hurt. Too much teeth, not enough tongue or lips. The years Dean had spent imagining it and psyching himself up for this moment didn’t come close to just how
Cas groaned.
Somehow, Cas was patient enough with Dean to let him get comfortable and find his words.
Movement on his left had him turning his head just in time to see a ghostly hand settle on his shoulder.
Dean scowled at the bottle before beginning to turn toward Castiel. “What part of I wanna be al-- Cas? What are you doing here?”
Dean’s head shot up. “What?”
The nightmares were a special kind of awful. Their subject matter varied wildly. Sometimes there were creatures with too many teeth who looked like men when their mouths weren’t bathed in blood. Other times the creatures with too many teeth had long tongues and faces like chest-ripper aliens.
Dean drank his coffee and stared out the window.
, Cas?” Dean asked as he scrambled to shove himself back into his jeans. His cock protested mightily and refused to soften regardless of any embarrassment he should be feeling in that situation. He finally got his fly secured over his hard-on and flopped back against the driver’s door. “When did you start being able to fly again?”
“What can I say? You’ve grown on me.”
“He made me a mixtape and confessed his attraction after Amara and Chuck left Earth.”
“I think my days of chasing hot pieces of ass are long over, Dean,” Castiel said.
Dean glanced at Cas to see the angel studying him with that intense stare that always made Dean feel things. He swallowed hard.
“I ordered you an omelet,” Dean said to Cas. “Peppers, bacon, cheese and eggs. It’ll be great.”
“Jack ate the last of your licorice,” Cas said.
“Did you find any ash wings?” Cas asked.
From then, the mantra came with humid, heavy air that hung between them as they spoke. Air heavy with potential and nerves.
Dean grinned.
Dean tapped the flyer with his index finger and pulled out his phone. He brought up Cas’s contact information and hit call. While the phone rang, Dean played the video one more time on mute. There was something odd about the angel in the video, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
“You know what?” Dean said. His mouth twisted and a quiet, distant voice at the back of his head started yelling at him to shut up, to stop. “You’re right. I wasn’t the only one who fucked up yesterday. You and Sammy should have left me there and finished the bastard off. You two let him get away instead of doing your jobs.”
The three of them exchanged goodbyes as Summer gathered her things, and she waved at them before rushing out the cafe door.
Ricky winked at him. The amber color in his eyes was striking in the morning light coming in from the window.
Dean paused and turned to look at Castiel. “Did you hear that?”
“I’m Jenny,” the blonde girl said. “This is Sarah, she found the body.”
The flutter of wings covered the sound of Dean picking up a pillow from the bed and lobbing it at Sam’s head.
Sam and Eileen had started spending more time with one another during that time as well. At first, once Castiel and Dean were healed enough to have sex again, Sam had used the excuse of wanting to give them space and get away from their noises to explain his trips to see Eileen. It wasn’t long until Sam gave up on the excuses and told them about how he and Eileen were looking for a house together. They were talking about setting up a hunting school and resource network. It was sweet and seemed to make them both very happy.
Dean blinked and frowned as he struggled to figure out what had woken him.
“Cas needs clothes,” Dean said as he parked under the tree.
“Why didn’t you just show me the video in the first place?” Dean asked threw his hands up in frustration.
“Anyway,” Dean said. “We should come back later, see if we can get this guy to show up for a private encore.”
“Date night is over,” Sam said with a grin. “Your twelve hours are up!”
“Or what, Sam?” Dean asked. “Am I gonna die? Been there, done that. It never sticks.”
“It sounds like you struggled with this role a bit, when did it finally click for you?” Donna asked.
“Where’s Sammy?” Dean asked. His voice sounded rougher than he preferred.
“Yes,” Castiel said as if it was an obvious choice. “I would have reached the hospital much earlier this morning, but it was very hard to find somewhere that sold these… CDs.”
Two hours later, Dean was three drinks in on his night off. Bodies pressed against him on all sides on the dance floor of the club. Music he didn’t care for but still felt the need to move to played loud enough to vibrate his bones and drown out the world around him. Music and alcohol and beautiful people dancing with him helped wash away everything troubling him. That annoying voice in his head couldn’t bother him here. Visions of monsters from his nightmares didn’t reach him here. No one cared that he couldn’t remember his own name here. It was peaceful in its loudness.
It wasn’t until Sam heard the “Take Me To Church” ringtone Dean had set for Cas on his phone that Dean realized he should probably do something about all the feelings he had bubbling around inside himself.
“How long have you been standing there?” Dean asked.
Dean rolled his eyes and started to look over his own menu. He should pick out some food for Cas too. He didn’t really eat food now that he was an angel again, but it was easier on the rest of them if they didn’t have to explain why their dorky friend only wanted coffee while the rest of them feasted.
Ricky set Cas’s plate down. Cas gave him a flirty smile that Dean had made him practice over and over again. Dean swallowed as regret swirled in his stomach over that. Somehow seeing Cas actually use that smile to flirt with someone else didn’t seem like such a good idea. Ricky was clearly affected by Cas’s flirting. He adjusted his glasses and ducked his head for a moment before straightening and addressing the table with a wide smile.
Dean shoved his fists deeper into the pockets of his jacket. His nails dug into his palms as he picked up the pace.
“I should go,” Cas said.
Dean had kissed a lot of people in his life. Women, men, and several people who didn’t fall into those tidy boundaries. Some kisses were sweet, like the best pie. Others were more brutal than a back alley fist fight. The worst were the goodbyes. How many times had he said his goodbyes to someone just like this?
Dean’s hand landed on Castiel’s shoulder. “Move.”
Sam had stopped holding his breath for that to happen years ago. That didn’t mean he didn’t do what he could to give them time together anyway. It kept them both on a more even keel. The world was an easier place to live in when Dean and his angel weren’t fighting with each other.
Of course, Sam had worked up suspicions during their hunt. He kept trying to talk about feelings on the drive home. Dean’s ears didn’t stop ringing from the music he’d turned up to drown out that disaster of a conversation for at least a couple hours after they’d gotten back to the bunker.
And yes, Detective Baum did mail out two care packages in the weeks following the events in the basement. One to Ashley, Dillon, & Scott's new home and one to a P.O. Box in Kansas. The first contained a collection of notebooks worn with age and, in some instances, overflowing with pictures and things tucked between the pages. The second box was smaller and contained only a mixtape.
“What were you remembering?” Sam asked.
“C’mere, Cas,” Dean said as he tried to pull Castiel across the chasm.
The man running through a doorway made of light.
Dean took a deep breath and tried to organize his thoughts into words. The ones he was willing to put into words anyway. Words he was willing to say out loud.
“Absolutely,” Dean said adding an extra layer of joy into his voice that he didn’t really feel.
When they’d reached the parking lot of the diner, Dean set eyes on the Impala again for the first time in nine months.
“What soldier doesn’t have at least one enemy out there?” Scott asked. “There was no one local that I know of. His foreign enemies would have no way to track him down if they wanted him dead.” Scott drained his coffee and set it back down on the table. He fidgeted with the handle for a bit before continuing. “And Ashley, my ex, didn’t start to really hate him until after he died. When he was alive they were almost as close as he and I were. She even used to joke that she’d marry him if something happened to me.”
“Yes?” she asked.
The trivia cards disappeared from the screen as the opening of the movie began.
“But if it is an angel and the angel is a ghost…” Cas said. “Dean, do you know what that means?”
“I knew there was something familiar about you. That sigil getting tripped just confirmed it for me.
Sam ran a hand through his hair and stared at the ceiling. “Will you please go out for a drink or a drive, or just
Donna chuckled. “Yes, I suppose a more serious role would require more research than some of your previous films.”
Ricky smiled and walked away. This time Dean didn’t have to turn around to watch Ricky’s backside sway while he walked.
Dean’s eyes snapped open and he found himself staring into Cas’s piercing blue eyes peering over the seat from the back of the car.
“Can we talk about this when we get home?” Dean asked.
“Idiot,” Sam said under his breath.
Dean bit his tongue, literally, to keep himself from saying he’d been waiting for Cas to ask him that for years.
“You’re right,” Sam said, giving up the fight. “Sometimes I get a little mixed up with these things, because it really feels like God’s helped me out of a few really difficult situations personally.”
“And what the hell makes you think I would even want to have sex with you?” Dean asked. “Last person who walked in on me having sex was not someone I wanted to get down with.”
Sam glared at Dean’s use of his childhood nickname. “Yes, someone said it looked like a ghost. But it’s not like the general public know what a ghost looks like.”
“You’re such a fucking showoff,” Dean said before kissing the angel in his arms.
“That gets tiring after a while, I imagine,” Donna said.
Cas looked away and took a step back from Dean. After a moment, he seemed to find the words he was looking for. “Is slow dancing that enjoyable, too?”
It took Dean a moment before he realized Ricky had addressed him.
“Tomorrow,” Cas said, eventually.
Sam pressed his lips together.
Dean gave Cas a wide-eyed, raised-eyebrow look when Scott’s back was turned. Cas shook his head.
Cas looked at Dean then at Ricky.
“Did Dillon have a fondness for angels or angelic symbolism?” Cas asked.
They stopped at a Gas-N-Sip outside of Prescott a few hours before the movie. After they filled up Baby with gas, they ventured inside for directions, snacks, and a restroom break.
Flashes of moments passed too quick to study.
“No,” Dean said. He cleared his throat and ignored Sam’s pitying frown. “He’s busy following a lead. He’ll call me whenever he gets a chance.”
This was one of those moments—if Cas were still alive and not a ghost or hallucination like he was at the moment—that Dean’s lips would positively ache with the urge to close the distance between them and claim Cas’s mouth in a kiss. He idly wondered if this is what grief induced madness felt like. If it was it figured that his brain still wouldn’t let him lean forward or to say the three little words he should have shouted from the rooftops when Cas was still alive to hear them.
“That better not be porn,” Sam said as he slapped Dean on the shoulder.
“Cas,” Dean said as he fished a bottle of water out of the mini fridge next to one of the many bookcases in the library. He set the bottle down in front of Cas with a thud. “Drink.”
“Dammit Dean, where the hell are you going?” Cas asked. His blue eyes sparked like an electric storm.
Scott’s mouth twisted into a bitter smile.
Dean looked down at the pile of clothing in Cas’s other hand and watched with wide eyes as Cas showed off the Britney Spears and Beyonce tour t-shirts he’d found. He glanced at Cas’s face to find the former angel grinning proudly.
She tilted her head to the side as she studied him.
(See the end of the chapter for
One last look around the room confirmed it was devoid of any evidence he’d even been there. He would drop his room key off in Sam and Mary’s room then go to the car. He’d figure out everything else from there.
Cas snapped a picture with his phone. Dean smiled to himself while he thought about how far Cas had come in terms of understanding the human world. Cas handed the picture back to Scott. He traced a finger over Dillon’s image in the frame then put it back on the mantel. His fingers trailed along the frame for a moment before he dropped his hand to hang at his side.
“I’ll meet you there in the morning,” Cas said.
“How much for the poster?” Dean asked.
