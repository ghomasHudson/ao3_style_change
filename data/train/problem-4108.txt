"How did you get out?" Gabriel asked, unusually serious as his angel blade appeared out of thin air "Because I was pretty sure that cage was inescapable, bro."
“I’m sorry you had to be there in the first place,” Jack said, sounding sad. His hug was starting to loosen a bit, but Castiel knew that the young man was still shaken by everything that had happened, and whatever Castiel missed while being inside the Empty. “It was my fault.”
He was lucky, as he didn't have to go far. Derringer was coming into the station, singing quickly to the poor shmuck that had gotten the short straw and got the reception desk duty.
"What is that?" Bobby asked at the same time that Castiel demanded that they stopped the car. The noise grew in intensity, hurting Sam's ears. Thankfully, Bobby hit the brakes, as he also had to cover his own ears. Sam barely had time to see that the Impala had also stopped, when the mirror and all the windows shattered at the same time.
"Dean, this are the agents Cash and Denver. They were asking about Officer Hatch..." Marion choose that moment to interrupt, although now she was looking at Sam with a  weary expression, rather than the slightly flirty look that she had given him when they arrived.   "... although they're a little weird."
Dean signed angrily. The meaning was so clear that Bobby didn't even need to translate.
“Wait, so… Dean is not dying because seven afterlives want him?” Sam frowned. “But… Jack is God, isn’t he? Can’t he… overrule everyone else?”
It is a common misconception that angels are constantly listening to prayers. In fact, most angels couldn't care less when humans prayed. Castiel knew very well that most of his brothers and sisters considered humans a lesser life form and, when they actually lowered themselves to listen to the prayers in question, it was only to mock the inability of humans to deal with their problems on their own, always asking for their Father to solve their suffering with a miracle.
Sam was going to answer, when finally the waiter put the sandwiches they had asked for in front of them. Only that instead of the gangly, brown haired kid that had taken their orders, now they were served by a blonde girl who reminded him a little bit of Meg's first vessel. Reminded him enough as to put him on his guard.
"Balls!" Bobby seemed to agree. Because the man who had just come in, looking at all the clients in the restaurant as if he was looking for someone,  gesturing with his hands at the guy behind the register,  was none other than  Dean. Dean, his brother,  looking perfectly fine, as if he had been taking a vacation while every one of their friends was going insane looking for him.
It was loud, which automatically made it bad. But it was worse because the Shadow could feel that, within the Empty, something… SOMEONE… was stirring at the voice.
"Raphael believes that he's following Father's orders," Castiel tried to explain.  "But he will fail. He can't reopen Lucifer's cage."
"But you found us back at Wellington," Sam protested. "You knew we were coming."
"What the hell was that?" Bobby joined them, just as Sam got back on his feet.
Dean signed angrily at his brother. He was no longer paying attention to the fake FBI agents.
“I can send everyone who is currently sleeping to this Purgatory realm,” The Shadow said, carefully. Dealing with Dean Winchester was very different from dealing with the Light. For once… the Shadow actually believed Dean was not trying to manipulate them. “But if you want me to spare Castiel… you will have to find him. I… I am not exactly sure where I put him to sleep.”
Jack tilted his head, blinking.
Sam couldn't fight the smile that formed on his face. At least somethings hadn't changed.
"Is there any way to figure out who gave him the staff?" Sam asked Castiel.  He guessed that if things got too complicated they could call Gabriel, but Sam figured they didn't need that much attention from the angelic brigade. The Archangel had made it very clear that he didn't want his brothers to know he was alive.
"Let's hope it doesn't escalate that fast," Bobby said. "So, one of your dick brothers brought it here just to fuck up with us?"
“I think that’s a good idea,” Jack piped in, after a long time of consideration. “Castiel would like it too, because it would mean… no one is beyond redemption. Everyone gets a second chance, if they want to work for it.”
"He has to be alive," he said, trying to dispel the image from his head. "I know he's alive."
"Dean might have been... misinformed," Castiel admitted. "It was not a situation he could help with, so there was no need for him to know. I was... considering my possible routes of action when Sam called. Since then, I am afraid I have not been as attentive as I should be to what is going on."
"Sorry to tell you this, chocolate bear, but I'm lying low. There's a new boss in Hell, and he wasn't very fond of the whole free Lucifer plan."
“Give us back the angels and demons, make the Empty, well, Empty again,” Dean explained. “That way, no one ever will want to come here again, and you will be able to sleep for all eternity.”
he asked, remembering how Sam had reacted upon seeing him. While it sounded like hunting was a worthwhile activity, he couldn't imagine that the retirement plan was very good.
*          *          *
But as the weeks passed and she was still bound by human flesh, other emotions made their appearance.
Ah, yes. The First Death. The old being was sleeping currently somewhere in the realm. Which brought one little problem to the Shadow.
"I'm agent Moscone, I'm working with agents Cash and Denver in this case," the man with blue eyes said, not even blinking as he offered him his hand. And Dean, who usually hated to touch people, automatically raised his hand to shake it. As their hands touched, he felt a shock, as if he had licked a battery. It was so sudden that he had to remind himself to let go of Moscone's hand in order to keep signing.
"Are you all right?" Sam wouldn't have stayed with Bobby, Castiel realized belatedly. Not when Dean could be in trouble. "Where's the angel?"
That made an impression on Sam's head. They had once forgotten each other thanks to Zachariah. Sam still remembered his month as "Sam Wesson", and how even if he had thought "Dean Smith" was familiar, he hadn't felt any emotional connection to him. And that time? Zachariah had only taken him for the ride because he knew Sam wouldn't stop looking for Dean if he remembered.
"Where the hell have you been?" the agent was saying, still getting into Dean's personal space. "We went to look for you at Lisa's! Cas and Gabriel have  gone everywhere in the world and you... you were here?! Why didn't you call Bobby?"
The first human, the one dressed in blue, had tried to shoot him with one of his primitive guns, while the other was still reeling on the surprise of seeing Kutiel appear in front of them. In the ancient times, Kutiel wouldn't have bothered with a vessel, just letting his presence smite those who had incurred in the wrath of God, but after Zachariah's death, Raphael had been clear on the fact that no Angel could descend to Earth without taking a vessel.
At the time, Sam had been relieved to see that the Impala was not only intact but was still Dean's most important possession. While he didn't have the same unhealthy attachment to the car that his brother had, he couldn't have bested Lucifer if it hadn't been for all the memories that his brother's car held for him. For one brief second, Sam believed that everything was going to be fine.
“Sorry,” Cas lowered his head again. Now, Dean knew, he was actually sorry for the situation. “But my suggestion that you choose was not welcomed.”
This close, it was impossible for the first born to miss Kutiel's heart.
'm out. What if Raphael finds the way to get Lucifer or Michael out?"
It had been a very innocent question, one that had never crossed Dean's or Cas's mind, so they both looked at each other, as Sam kissed Jess' forehead.
Dean was very confused.
Despite the fact that Castiel thought it was impossible, and it could be a trap, he couldn't ignore this prayer. Sam himself  he could and had ignored more than once. At first, because Sam was an
*                                                                                 *        *
"Cas, get us out of here," Sam said, opening his eyes carefully. As he suspected, the angel that had killed Grant was on the floor, looking peaceful, surrounded by the burnt silhouette of two huge wings. "Before the other cops come here to investigate."
Officer Grant was nervous. Everything had gotten out of control since the Birch kid's death. At first, he had thought that they would get away with it. IT had been an accident.  Hatch had honestly believed that Birch was carrying a gun. An honest mistake that shouldn't have cost Hatch his badge, so Grant had agreed with Colfax and Grey to keep it silent when they planted the gun. But then the thing with Hatch had happened, and then Grey and Grant hadn't been able to deny that God himself was punishing them.
It was finally quiet.
In the two years they had been together, Cas had seen Dean angry in many occasions. At the school, when Cas's job had been endangered because Cas had suspended the son of the president of the parent's board because the kid had been bullying and harassing a girl from his class, Dean had practically single handedly organized a demonstration outside the school. When clients were particularly difficult at Singer's Garage, where Dean worked. Whenever something happened to hi s brother Sam. Usually after a phone conversation with his father. When a jerk barista refused to serve Cas because of his discrete rainbow pin on the lapel of his trenchcoat, Dean had come to his rescue, making the barista end up almost in tears.
But then, Dean had always been a lot better with actions than with words.
Jack didn’t answer for a long time, and Sam started to worry again. But the kid finally looked up and now, despite the tears, he was smiling.
He just had to make sure that he didn't leave any marks on Derringer when he roughed him up.
Still, as he walked down the lawn of Chuck's house, he was glad he was alone. Because with Dean missing, there hadn't been a lot of time to question exactly how Sam had gotten out of Hell and for now, that was good news.  But if Chuck was still getting visions that were not intercepted by Zachariah and Michael, that meant that Chuck could know. And Sam had to make sure that the prophet didn't tell anyone until Sam was ready.
Dean texted back, feeling a bit easier. Of all of Alfie's friends, he liked Rachel the least. She was one of her classmates, and for some reason always looked at Dean as if he wasn't worthy of licking her shoes clean. No matter what he did, she seemed to dislike him more. Until the feeling was mutual.
Cas nodded. He had only met John Winchester once, and the meeting had not been particularly pleasant. John was not precisely homophobic, but he had made it clear to Cas that he had hoped that Dean would settle with 'that nice girl Lisa from the yoga class'. Mary had been nicer, only once mentioning that she would have to count on Sam for grandkids.
, causing him to choke to death.  Finally, Edward  Colfax, had died when a bunch of locusts hatched from his brain.
He missed his brother. Dean would know what to do. In fact, that's what he had been counting on from the moment he decided to jump into the Cage. That Dean would, despite the promise they made, find a way to save him, find a way to fix everything. But now... now he had to do it without Dean.
.  It had seemed stupid, when it had only been Hatch, but after Colfax died with a bunch of insects hatching on his skull, Dean had been a bit more open to the possibility. And he knew exactly who would have paid such price.
"I don't understand," Samandiriel answered, at the same time as Dean batted his hands away. The older Winchester was angry, as angry as Castiel had seen him when he had thought that they were going to smite the town of Salem. Castiel lowered his sword, trying to make sure that Dean realized that he meant no harm to him, Samandiriel or the Impala.
At that, Cas looked up, locking eyes with Dean, who immediately swallowed. Cas’s gaze was as intense as ever, looking straight into Dean’s soul. And Dean wondered how he had been so stupid not to notice the love that Cas’s eyes irradiated. It was so clear, now that Dean knew what to look for. Now that he knew the truth. And he wondered how Cas couldn’t see the same on his own eyes. How much he meant to Dean.
“Sam!” Dean managed to yell, a bit louder now. Enough that Sam looked up surprised, tears stopping immediately.
They rode on silence, Sam glaring at the Impala's lights shining on the back mirror, until they reached the state line. At that point, Sam wished that Bobby at least would let him turn on the radio since the silence in the car was starting to get on his nerves. He thought that, if Dean wasn't mute thanks to Raphael, at this point he would've singing along AC/DC, Van Halen or Metallica, while Sam asked him not to.  It had been familiar, it had been the way things were supposed to go, before Dean sold his soul.
"No, we're not," the older man answered, earning himself a glare from the younger man. Dean was getting the feeling that 'agent Denver' pretty much disapproved everything around him. "My name is Bobby Singer, this is Sam Winchester. We're hunters."
"Castiel, you shouldn't be here," Charoun said gravely. It didn't made Castiel feel safer, or more confident that he wouldn't be attacked. To the contrary, it made him be absolutely sure that if he did one wrong move, Charoun would try and smite him. "Raphael is not pleased with you,brother."
“So you’re just going to let Cas suffer?” Dean yelled, getting angry. Behind them, Chuck whimpered and Sam wondered if they should keep this argument somewhere else. If Chuck offered a way to get Cas back now… given how angry Dean was at Jack… Sam wasn’t sure how his brother would react. “After all he did for u… for you?”
Gabriel narrowed his eyes, and Sam was pretty sure that his mind was being read by the angel and tried to concentrate in the one thing that was important: Dean's safety.  Behind him, he could see Bobby grabbing his shotgun but Sam couldn't know if he was planning to help him or help Gabriel.
"I don't know," Samandiriel answered, ignoring Dean's affronted signs. It seemed that now that they were there, the other angel had decided to forego the charade. "I didn't take his memories. I was just ordered to watch him."
"Dean?" Sam frowned hearing the name. Of course, it had to be some other Dean. There had to be  thousands in the United States alone. But hearing that name, in the same town where Castiel couldn't remember if he had seen Dean or not, was enough to make Sam suspicious.
“So, what now? You’re… not leaving again, are you?” Sam asked the question Dean wanted to ask. But Dean didn’t really trust his voice with that. He knew he’d sound like a needy girlfriend, which was not who he wanted to be with his angel.
Time kept going on, as usual.
Dean signed something that, for once, needed no translation. Sam knew his brother well. Dean was  in  his 'overprotective older brother mood' so he probably was saying something like 'You'll touch my brother over my dead body'.  Sam had been behind Dean in such mode more than once, even since he was a kid and Dean threatened to kill bullies just for looking at Sam.
*             *             *
Alfie seemed relieved at that, as he hugged him tightly, not letting him sign anymore. However, he could still see the other men. Singer and the angel looked happy, as if they had been counting on him to come along. But Winchester? He looked furious.
They landed on their motel room, and as soon as they were there, Dean scrambled away from Cas, still holding the angel blade he had gotten from the dead angel. As his hands were occupied, Dean couldn't sign, but Sam could read his expression well enough. It was an expression he had seen more than once in the witnesses they talked to when they saw the supernatural for the first time.
"Dad said that his RV has space for four people, so Jess and I would've covered," Sam added. It was a bit obvious to Dean that his brother was jumping at the chance of not spending the whole holidays alone with Dad, but it was a good point. "Didn't you and Cas said that you wanted to take a trip on the Impala? have some days in the road?"
Originally, she had wanted to go with him, insisting that she would be useful while looking for both Dean and Chuck -although Sam had tried to make it clear that Dean was a priority because, disappeared or not, Chuck still had the archangels protection over him and, as far as he remembered, said protection was nothing to scoff at - but Sam had managed to convince her that the notes were far more important. At the end, Zachariah had been furious at Dean for not following the script, and so, Sam wanted to know what the original script was. And if he could find the answer in the prophet's notes, everything would be much better.
And yes, now they did.
A battle between Angels was something that a human mind couldn't comprehend.  It was a battle through dimensions, through time and space. But fortunately for Castiel, that was only when they were in their true forms. Inside vessels, it took time to get used to fight in just one dimension, with just two arms, one head. Unlike his brothers, Castiel had spend the last two years inside his vessel, never leaving Jimmy except for when Zachariah had forced him out for 'rehabilitation', so he had far more experience fighting in the human plane. Charoun was not used to his vessel, and while Castiel  hesitated for a second, thinking about the poor man who had consented for his body to be used as a weapon of the Lord, at the end that experience gave him the upper hand.
"Tell me, what happened?" She insisted, not letting go. "Dean looked like death warmed over when I saw him, and now you... I thought you two were traveling together all the time. Tell me, what happened?"
After all, stranger things had happened around that family. And, all things considered, he was grateful most of them had lived to tell the tale.
“If this was a joke, Dean…”
"He is not your brother, Dean," Cas said, calmly. He hadn't put his blade down but he was not attacking. Dean signed something else, and Cas shook his head. "He's an angel, like myself. I fear he must be controlling your memories to make you forget your real brother."
"The same thing that caused the first plagues. The Staff of Moses. Although it's effects seem to have diminished, since it originally could destroy a whole city."
When Zachariah and Uriel had come forward with the plan to work with Lilith and her demons to free Lucifer, Raphael had expressed doubt.
*             *             *
"Raphael and I have had... disagreements in the past." Once again, Castiel's face was unreadable, but Sam could see right then that it was an understatement. "But I am sure that he would not fail to do his sacred duty if it was needed."
"No, I mean, it can't be Samuel Campbell. Dean saw him die at Azazel's hands in 1973.  It was his death that started the whole mess for mom and dad." Sam swore. He hadn't met his grandfather when Anna and Castiel had sent them back in time, but for what Dean had told him, he had been a good hunter. He didn't deserve having some creature parading around pretending to be him.
Spanish was really the language of love.
" A kid named Christopher Birch," Bobby handed him his notes. "Can you find him on your computer?"
"If it is a witch, it must be really powerful to hid a whole town from you," Sam started thinking about his father's notes. But nothing he could think of was able to actually liquefy a person. In fact, that sounded a little bit out of his league.
He pointed out.  He was trying very hard not to pay attention to the idiots who had convinced Alfie to throw away his life while Dean had been unconscious. He hated when that happened, and it was far more often that he wanted to admit. He just hoped that Alfie wouldn't use the fainting spells as a reason why Dean couldn't take care of him. Last thing he remembered was Alfie arriving home, and then, nothing. Just his brother telling him he wanted to quit college to go and become a drifter.
"He said his name was easy to guess," Aaron said, so softly that Sam almost missed it. "That every Epiphany, he got prayed on to help children. That's why he heard my prayer."
“Unless you call for help, yes. And not every demon and angel goes to Purgatory. Cas comes with me.” Dean smiled at the Shadow, making the Shadow feel something… different. They were starting to understand why the annoying noisy angel liked this former human. “And as I said before, no other angel or demon dying will ever come here. We will make sure of that with either the new Death or the Old Death if he wants his job back.”
“Sam?”
"Hi, Becky... uhm... Is Chuck home?"
"Sam Winchester, do you mean to say that there's someone in this country who can see everything you and Dean do?" Ellen asked, slowly as she waited for Sam to make the connection himself. "And you forgot ?!"
“About what you said before…”
"I don't know if it is connected, but while I was away I remembered something," Castiel explained, walking towards Bobby's car. "You said that the three deaths were similar to the plagues of Egypt, Sam. There's only one weapon in the world that could cause that."
At the end, Becky's voice raised up, as she was getting hysterical. Sam closed the distance between them and grabbed her by the shoulders.
"Wait, what? He knew he was going to disappear and he didn't tell you why? Weren't you two dating?"
The angel choose that exact moment to reappear in the living room, and as he took one look at Alfie, all hell broke loose.
Both men looked at their partner, confused and, at least in Dean's case, angry, which made Cas swallow.
Caught by surprise as he was, he almost didn't register the shock in Gabriel's features until the archangel slammed him against the wall.
Why Raphael had insisted on erasing the Righteous man 's memory when he had first been alone with him? Why not take him to the green room or even a temporal heaven while the rest of the garrison rescued Michael?
He had barely had the chance to say hello to Mitch when he heard someone call his name. As he turned around, a huge guy, almost a human moose, had come towards him, grabbing him in a bone crunching hug, not letting him go.
Balthazar was expecting him. He was comfortable on his vessel, a tall blonde man wearing a black jacket and a gray v-neck shirt. He looked almost human, happy, unlike their other brothers who always seemed to fit a bit uncomfortably in their own vessels. As if they couldn't wait to leave the human body behind.
"I haven't found those yet," Becky pouted, looking at one of her suitcases. "But I brought all his hard drives with me so I can keep looking. But before I do that, we need to talk."
Outside, Dean was standing next to a 1971 green Buick Riviera. It was a nice car, but it wasn't the Impala.  He signed something to Bobby, very slowly and deliberately, and Sam got the feeling that that was the ASL version of speaking slowly  and loudly to someone who didn't speak the language.
*             *             *
Maybe that's why Cas had been homeschooled.
"Actually, it would help a lot to have a hunter with medical knowledge," Winchester interrupted, and Dean glared at him. He had disliked Winchester when he thought he was an FBI agent and now he liked him even less.
"A deal creates a mark on the human soul," Castiel explained, but he didn't move closer to the chair where Aaron was sitting, looking scared. Dean had positioned himself between the kid and them, protecting him. And again, that hurt Sam horribly because not long ago, he had been mentally complaining that Dean did that for him. "Each angel has a very specific mark. It's possible to read the mark and find the name of the angel that bought his soul."
Apparently, his brother had been in an accident a couple of months before and thus, the Riviera they had seen him in was a loan from his boss, while he fixed his real car.
Raphael was keeping something valuable in the city and he didn't want any demon or one of the rebels who didn't want to bring Paradise to Earth to know about it.
Cas tilted his head, confused. Last he heard, Sam and his father were not on speaking terms.
There was a crash inside the house, as if he had woken someone up, just like the first time he and Dean had come to figure out what was going on behind the Supernatural books. However, to his surprise, it wasn't the drunken, jumpy writer/prophet the one who opened the door, but a short brunette woman he recognized immediately.
Counted sheep, because they knew that sometimes helped mortals and demons. But by the time they got to imaginary numbers, they had started wondering where would someone keep so many sheep, and they were awake.
Sam had to choose between keeping his secret, or help Dean. Sam knew what Dean would do in his place, but he still wasn't ready to give that information up.
Ironically, the memory that tortured the noisy, annoying old angel the most was of him killing the new angel. And now, belatedly, the Shadow realized who this new angel was: It was the former human named Dean Winchester. The annoying angel Castiel’s happiness in the flesh, walking into the Empty as an angel instead of as a human hunter.
"I said that  maybe you also had to keep an eye out for a group of hunters that seem to be bad news," Ellen repeated, cautiously.  "Remember what you and Dean told us about Mary's family?"
As a wedding gift, Jack cleaned up Sam’s criminal records from every human mind and database, so that his uncle could go back to law school. Sam enrolled online, and passed with honors, becoming the first hunter lawyer. While he rarely took cases, all his clients were probono, and most of them victims of some supernatural stuff.
Because he couldn't believe that Samandiriel would manipulate Dean's... any human's mind the way in which Dean had been manipulated. While the younger angel had never been as fond of humanity as Anna or Castiel himself, he had never been as derisive as Uriel. It made no sense.
*             *             *
"Dean is all right," Sam hurried to say, trying to comfort her. Or maybe to comfort himself. "I just... we got separated and I thought... when was the last time you saw him?"
”You must hate me, Castiel made his deal with the Empty to save me,” Jack said as he finished explaining to the brothers what had happened when he had exploded, and what Castiel had done. Sam was still sure he was missing part of the story, namely, what had Castiel said to Dean when they were chased by Billie, in order to fulfill the deal. But every time he tried to ask, Dean interrupted him with another question of his own.
"I don't care what Raphael thinks," Castiel answered, at the same time he mentally started to figure out a battle plan that wouldn't hurt humans and wouldn't take him out of Easter. He had the feeling that if he did, he would forget that Sam and Bobby were waiting for him. "You shouldn't either."
"We can explain," Sam said quickly,  showing his empty hands. "Just... put the sword down."
Dean signed slowly, just to make sure that the old man understood clearly. Only then he realized he had not asked for the names of the agents and almost kicked himself for that. He was so eager to get Chris's exonerated that he had totally threw his usual caution to the winds.
"What about Hatch? Did he also eat there?" Bobby asked, taking notes. It wasn't much to go on, but if it was the only place that the victims had in common besides the police station, it was better than nothing.
Yes, he could wait to hear the explanation in the Bunker, especially if it meant Cas was staying around.
After the first week of waiting for any news, Bobby had sent  Sam to check a series of disappearances and mysterious deaths in Indiana, not far from Lisa's house.  Sam tried his best to avoid her, with no answers about Dean's whereabouts which means that what would've been a somewhat simple hunt for a group of djinn take far longer than it should. Or perhaps it had been just that, without Dean, Sam didn't have the heart to put his all into the hunt.
“Not really, Dean,” Cas replied, making Sam frown. “I just made sure your body wouldn’t betray your… situation.”
Jack smiled brightly and snapped his fingers. And just like that, they were back in the bunker.
Kutiel would've just disappeared, but then he sensed something in the other human. It was also a first born, and thus, his mission was clear. Both humans had to die.
"Not if it's just for your general Michael to kill him as soon as he's out," the demon pointed out. Raphael smiled, as he had been expecting this.
Castiel himself was still not completely comfortable inside Jimmy's body. In contrast, Balthazar almost seemed to have been born human. Almost like Gabriel.
He had been very careful on the trip, biting his own lips as to avoid talking again. And that had been a surprise. He hadn't even noticed when he had started singing along his tapes, and he was terrified at the idea that he could have hurt his brother when his voice had, apparently, destroyed all the window panes from both his baby and Singer's Chevelle.  Castiel, had fixed both with a touch, but it felt wrong for Dean. If he had hurt the Impala, it had to be him the one who fixed it. He had promised his father that he would take care of the Impala when he had inherited it. After all, it was the only good thing in his life that his father had given him.
Dean was signing so fast, that Bobby figured he was having a panic attack. Not that he blamed the boy, since he apparently had been living a normal life.
Dean could already tell that he was going to hate traveling with that guy.
And Grant had been  fine with the idea of his impending death. Unlike  the others, he had the chance to put his will in order, even make arrangements to say goodbye to his family without making them worry. But then the FBI had come to talk to him, and he realized that perhaps the punishment wasn't that heavenly. The Agents keep asking them about HAtch, and if they had any enemies in common. And then agent Denver had mentioned the Derringer guy, who had been coming over to the station, demanding that they reopened the Birch case just because he was one of his 'project' kids. Everyone knew that those kids would end up in jail anyway, everyone except Derringer who was a pain in the ass and who had put the FBI on his tail.
The Shadow blinked, confused. No one had ever cared for what they wanted. From the moment that the Light and Darkness had been created in that horrible explosion filled with noise and light, all contact with the realm of the Empty had been to know what they could take from the Shadow. From the promise to keep Demons and Angels asleep, to giving them back, to getting them inside again… it was all taking, no giving.
"I saw the papers outside it. A police officer died during an investigation. All his internal organs liquefied into blood."
"The Campbells, yes," Sam nodded on the phone, lowering his speed. He was in a hurry to get to Bobby's but he didn't want to get in an accident because he wasn't paying attention to the road. "Family of hunters, never even tried to contact Dad after Mom died. What about them?"
That was the first questions of many he wanted to ask. In truth, the first one was 'Where is your brother'? but he knew that the one about the cage was more important. Because if Sam was out, that meant that Lucifer and Michael were out too. And that only meant that Raphael's plan was working.
*             *             *
"Dean isn't in heaven or hell," Castiel interrupted with such certainty that Sam couldn't help but be glad. If Cas was sure of it, then Dean was alive. Any doubt created by Gabriel's words dispelled instantly. "I can't sense his body, but I know his soul. If he had died, I would've known immediately. "
"And the Dean we know would never leave his younger brother alone, especially if he thinks that his brother could be in danger." Singer finished. "So how are we going to convince this Dean to come with us?"
“I was angry, yes,” Dean admitted. Then again, Sam hoped his brother wouldn’t try to lie to Jack now that Jack was God. “But not at you, or at Cas. And it doesn’t matter anymore. We get him out, and from now on, no more deals.”
"Father has never had the whole family under the same roof, Dean," he ventured. It was true. And it was also true that he had never really spoken with Dean about his family. Dean knew that Cas's father wanted his children to be as free as possible, that Cas had a ton of uncles, aunts, cousins and brothers so it could become confusing as to who was related to whom, and that Cas had been homeschooled all the way up until college.
And that was the truth. The Shadow had originally been very keen on keeping an eye on their prize. Torturing Castiel for all the damage he had done to the Empty was their goal, after all. But Castiel, damn him, was actually happy. The Empty hadn’t been able to take that away from him, and unlike everyone else who was relieving their regrets in their dreams, Castiel just dreamed of peace and calm at Dean Winchester’s side. It was unnerving, so the Shadow had left him alone and… well, it wasn’t as if the Empty had any way to identify a place from another.
"I can't give him his memories back, and I can't let Raphael keep using him," Samandiriel said, looking down towards the sleeping Dean. That was as close to the truth as he could say.  It was what he could understand of his own motives anyhow.
Dean sighed. Alfie was incredibly stubborn, and he never understood that Dean was there to take care of him. Sure, Dean was not the best person you could have to watch your back, not with his muteness and the epilepsy, but he would still die before letting anything happen to his baby brother.  He couldn't say the same of the others.
Dean took a deep breath as the pain disappeared, and he could feel his body knitting itself up. It was just like in the old days, before they knew about Chuck, before Cas lost his powers. Apparently, Jack had fixed things up upstairs quite fast.
Sorry, sorry, this has been slow. But the latest episodes have made really hard for me to write protective!Sam. Hopefully, a rewatch of the whole series will help to get away from this block.
Sam nodded, already dialing the angel's phone.  Bobby couldn't shake the feeling that they were missing something. Because yes, it sounded like a biblical plague, except that biblical plagues weren't so focused on one person. And he still had no idea why angels would care about three human cops in the middle of Pennsylvania.
"So whatever you did to my friends can catch up with me?" Grant asked. He couldn't turn on his recorder, because this was not an official interrogation, but at the very least, he could make Derringer write everything.
Sam groaned, shaking his head. "Becky, I can't. My brother..."
"Exactly what happened between the dead officers and this kid?" he asked Dean, trying to keep himself on track. The truth was that he was sure that they were no longer that invested in the exploding cops, but there was still work to do.
But before he could get answers, Castiel needed to get Dean away from the angel.
for permission to act. Dean tensed immediately, fearing a fight. But Sam shook his head slightly. Apparently, they were going to respect his choice.
"We can be there for New Year's. As far as I understood, most of the family will still be there. It'll be just aunt Naomí and her children... and maybe Lucifer who will be gone after Christmas' morning."
In their borrowed form, the Shadow yawned. Metaphorically, they laid back down again, and yawned again before closing their eyes.
"You believe?" Sam lifted his eyebrow. "As in, you're not sure?"
“I don't want to see any of you ever again!” The Shadow replied, offended. Behind the Portal, the Mariachi were now about two hundred, and were playing something about Eyes coming down a Mountain, and someone wanting a mole that was over someone else’s lips. It made no sense, and it was making them testy.
Unfortunately, the sheer quantity of research made Dean look like the main person who would like those officers dead. Sam seemed to agree with that idea, since he put away the folder almost immediately.
Not that he would be much better. Sam had to admit that he wasn't very good at letting go either. After all, he had also tried to exchange his soul for his brother's.
Trying to ignore his instincts, Sam rang the bell and prepared himself. Dean was going to open the door, take one good look at him and then punch him in the face. Sam could almost feel the punch, and hear his brother yelling to Lisa to get him salt and something silver. Then Sam would try to defend himself, to explain. And Dean would finally listen, and everything would work out.
"That can't be!"
"What the hell is wrong with him, Bobby?" the agent asked at the same time, finally clueing in that Dean had no idea what he was talking about.
"No, Alfie is not here," Marion answered the question that Dean hadn't asked. "And I have no idea what this guy's problem is. They said they were FBI agents..."
Instead, he closed his eyes and let his consciousness free. He couldn't find Dean. That was far beyond his powers. But there was one other angel who didn't hate the Winchesters, and who had more than once proved that not  all laws regarding angels applied to him.
"I thought you wanted an explanation," Samandiriel said, looking down. Castiel frowned, since his brother actually looked repentant. As if he wasn't happy with his own actions. "And Dean... he can't hear what I have to tell you."
“Eve sent a Leviathan to demand that Dean was to be sent to Purgatory as he was the last monster she created before Dean killed her, which, well, Rowena didn’t like. Then the Empty came to Heaven again. It declared that the Second Death had promised Dean to it, so no one else could have you,” Cas nodded to Dean. “I’m sorry. Apparently, me talking about you made it curious.”
"There were no traces of witchcraft in either body. If there had been any remains left of Officer Hatch, I am sure it would be the case too."
"Fine," Dean finally gave in. it was true that he wanted to get away from everything in the city, spend some days in the road just with Cas. After New Year sounded like the perfect time, really. And he really wanted to spend the rest of his life with his lover, so sooner or later, their families would have to meet. Sooner sounded like a good plan. "Call your dad. Tell him we're all spending the holidays with them."
The demon appeared as soon as Raphael finished the summoning incantation. Unlike others of its kind, it didn't seem scared. If anything, it looked angry. Convinced that it was going to survive to see another day because it was useful to Raphael.
Before Dean could answer, the barn started shaking, and the light bulbs exploded. Sam was on his feet immediately, machete in hand, as Dean held his breath, and not just because it hurt, but also because it finally hit him why the barn was familiar. And as he tried not to get his hopes up, as he tried to remind himself that Cas was gone forever, into the Empty because he had lo… because he had sacrificed himself for Dean, the doors blasted open and there was Castiel, looking as badass and powerful as he had 12 years before, in that same barn. Just like when Dean had met him. And it made Dean’s heart hurt even more than the rebar on his back.
Sam was sure that there was something he was forgetting, and  so, he just kept watching his brother as he moved his hands giving Bobby and Cas information about their strange case.
"It doesn't matter, does it? My brother was not born mute," Sam interrupted, obviously annoyed by the way the conversation seemed to sidetrack. And Bobby didn't blame him, since this had to be harder on the younger man than on everyone else. "So what the hell did you do to him?"
He could see in her eyes that he hadn't quite convinced her that Dean was fine. It probably was because he wasn't sure of it anymore.
"If you kill me, you will destroy this town!"
“Now Jack, we talked about that,” Dean didn’t sound angry, which was unexpected. In Castiel’s experience, Dean never liked it when someone in the group made deals behind his back. “You’re a Winchester, so that means someone will make a dumb deal to get you out of trouble sooner or later. Comes with the name.”
"You can come with us to the house," Sam answered before anyone else could. "But Dean should stay here, where it's safe."
*          *          *
“Gabriel, Balthazar and Samandriel are back in Heaven, they said they needed a bit of a break from Earth,” Sam answered, not wanting to go yet into details on how they had helped him to avoid the demons who didn’t like the idea of having to earn redemption in Purgatory. “Metatron and Anna choose to be reborn as humans, so, well, we sent them on their way. Tessa, Billie and the First Death went to the veil to make sure everyone still stuck there went where they were supposed to go, and uhm… Death said to tell you there were no hard feelings, but he expected you to make him tamales again as an apology. They also said they would let Kevin and Charlie come back to life, to make up for… well…. Everything.”
"What kind of deal did you make, Dean?"  Sam  yelled, making Dean step back. After all, Sam was imposing when he wanted. "Is this why you don't remember us?"
"Wait, Cas... your Father won't mind? I mean.. I know you say your family is big but... he wouldn't mind having the whole Winchester clan there too?"
*             *             *
"I can protect myself, I don't need you to babysit me."
Besides that, Dean had also included a lot of clippings on Hatch, Gray, Colfax and Grant, about suspicious arrests and their work, that seemed less than stellar.  Birch's school grades, which were very high. Bobby had to admit that it was possible that the kid had been unjustly killed.
"Dean? I saw your car outside, I thought you were..."
*             *             *
"I know a spell," Castiel explained, as Dean turned to glare at Sam. Apparently they had asked the same thing at the same time.
"I'm sorry for my partner's reaction," Bobby said quickly, also moving his hands just as Dean was doing. It finally dawned on Sam that it was sign language. "His brother went missing two months ago, and you look exactly like he did."
*          *          *
Except… they
I don't know if it's the same in the USA, but since angels are all knowing, I'm pretty sure that Castiel would know that yes, every 6 of January, Kids of Mexico, Spain and other parts of the world ask toys from Balthazar (Well, and Melchor and Gaspar,and they're not angels, but the name fits. And I didn't want to torture Aaron so... sorry about that)
“I’m sorry?” Jack frowned and tilted his head. It was a lot more unnerving now than before, and it reminded Sam a bit of when Jack had just been born, before they knew the kid wasn’t as evil as his biological dad. “Dean… I just want to…”
"I would need to touch his soul to investigate," Castiel interrupted, making Dean frown. The angel had been very polite when speaking to them, so listening to him interrupt was strange. It made Dean be sure that Castiel was trying to hide something, and the idea didn't settle with him. Because he actually wanted to trust the guy.
“You want the annoying angel?” The Shadow narrowed their eyes as Dean smiled. The noise from the mariachi kept going, as they had now started a new song. And, from the looks of the portal, another big group had joined in. And onlookers were singing too.
"I know," Ellen continued. "You can't find Arachnes outside of Crete, but..."
"There is a... situation in heaven," Castiel admitted. "A group of Angels believe that the apocalypse should still happen."
It was probably just wishful thinking, he considered, as he came out of his room, Miracle barking happily at his feet.
“I take it that you found a way to beat Chuck?” He said, trying to sound calm despite the fact that his vessel’s heart was beating a mile a minute. They were alive, he was out of the empty, and Dean had kissed him.
Dean brought up his right hand in a fist, knocking on thin air. As Sam raised his eyebrows, confused, Dean sighed and nodded, before continuing up to the next floor, still signing more things to Bobby.  Which was another thing. Maybe his brother hadn't picked it up the language recently, more than once Dean had surprised Sam with knowledge that he had no idea his brother had.
"Nothing on the Dean front, sorry" Ellen's voice calmed him a little. In those months, he had separated himself completely from people. Now, he had friends. And they were going to help him find his brother. "Gabriel thinks that someone must be  hiding him through some spell, and that's what we're looking at now. "
Apparently, he had decided to stand his ground on the one thing Dean didn't want him to give up.
He wasn’t sure how long they were silent, looking at each other, when Sam interrupted, rasping his throat.
The one They had taken back just to get revenge, and still had managed to go back to sleep with a smile on his face no matter how much the Shadow tortured him with images of his failure.
"Perhaps it wasn't Raphael who caused this," Castiel finally said. "He had Chauron posted in Easter to keep someone silenced. It must have been Dean, since we only heard him speak after we left the city limits."
"Dean... I thought you wanted to spend Christmas with John, Mary and Sam... I can call Father and tell him we will be home after Christmas, for New Year's."
*             *             *
"I guess?"  the officer shrugged, pointing to the table behind him. Sure enough, there was a red and white take out bag with the Wiener Hut logo. "Half the station eats there because it's close."
*          *          *
Immersed on his memories, at first Sam didn't register the strange static noise until Bobby mentioned it.
Sam barely had time to close his eyes when he saw Dean pierce the angel's heart. He just hoped that Bobby had the same fast thinking. And of course, he felt proud. His brother could be mute and amnesic, but he still was a hunter and he still could defend himself. The question of how he had managed to kill an angel was filed to the 'I don't want to think about this' part of Sam's brain that was getting quite huge since the day when Dean had managed to kill the Whore.
“I still don’t see the problem,” Sam frowned. “I mean, Rowena likes Jack too. I am sure she’ll let Dean go to Heaven, and was just maybe stalling? Doing us a favor so that Dean wouldn’t die at the barn even if Jack said he’d be hands off as God?”
The Shadow did not whine. They were an ancient, eldritch being that had seen many universes be born and die. They did not whine.
"If Dean was still hunting, that could be a way to find him," Bobby pointed out just as Sam wanted to deny it. He knew Dean wasn't hunting. He didn't know how he knew, but it was obvious to him that his brother was not in some road motel, cleaning up his weapons. Bobby seemed to notice his unease, as he continued. "What? There aren't many other options. We know that he's alive, and that's pretty much it."
Dean watched as the so called FBI agents left in their car, hidden behind the curtains of his window. He hadn't liked them from the moment "Denver" had hugged him, and while he was sure he had seen "Moscone" somewhere, he still didn't trust them. After all, it wasn't as if he didn't know that they had given him fake names. Because Cash, Denver and Moscone were obviously not their real names.
However, this gave him the advantage that he could actually look at his brother and try to figure out what had happened in the last month and a half. Because there had to be clues. There had to be something that could tell him why his brother was acting the way he was. It was not as if he was a completely different person. He definitively wasn't acting as if a Siren had gotten hold of him.
Dean seemed to realize what he had done, as he pointed at Sam before signing at Castiel again.
"Is this angel a friend of yours?" Bobby was frowning, looking at the kid. Sam still didn't know who was the angel in question, but he was willing to trust Castiel's judgment. Since angels had unique names, and Aaron had mentioned the Epiphany, it could only be one of three.
Dean's glare lessened a bit, and he started moving his hands again, this time gesturing in Bobby's direction. It went for a full minute before Bobby raised his hands in defeat.
"I think it sounds a bit biblical," Sam said, easing his tie. "Blood, Boils and Locusts. Those are three of the ten plagues, aren't they?"
“She says one problem at a time, that you get Castiel out first, then she and I can deal with heaven.”
Dean finally signed, looking defeated. It convinced Bobby more that Dean had a very good idea of what was happening in Easter, even if he pretended not to. Unfortunately, his body language was still familiar to Sam and, without understanding ASL, the boy jumped to the wrong conclusion.
No one was going to torture Dean on Sam's watch... ever again.
“And some of them died helping us, Sam,” Dean said, slowly. Sure, his main goal was to get Castiel back. He was willing to go and gank the Shadow if it was necessary to get Cas back. But he had learned now that going guns first, questions later, was not precisely the best approach, and there were others who would also be good to have back. “Crowley, Meg, Gabriel, Anna, Tess… you want to leave them all suffering for eternity?”
“What’s the difference?”
Sam disliked Dean's 'brother' the moment the kid entered the room. It was not really the kid's fault, he figured, except that he was part of what kept Dean trapped in this place. The kid didn't even looked like Dean, not enough to be passed off as his brother. He was shorter than Dean to start with, which was just wrong. He had brown short hair, and at the moment was wearing a horrible white and red shirt from the Weiner hut.
They opened it cautiously, to find a pink gadget that they knew was an iPhone thanks to the memories of their former captives and a note inside. The note read:
"That can't be," Sam turned to look at Castiel, who had gone pale as he spoke. Apparently, the angel who had created the whole mess was toying with them, leaving clues as if it was a game. If it wasn't because Gabriel was supposed to be on their side, Sam would've accused the archangel of being behind everything. "I thought he died in the war."
So he couldn't really say that he was surprised two years later when he opened the same door to find the other Winchester brother freshly back from Hell.
He needed his brother
"And why was he speaking like an angel?" Winchester added, not taking his eyes from Alfie and Dean. As if he was expecting them to sprout wings, or something. Dean figured that was going to be a problem, especially if Winchester worked closely with Singer and Alfie wanted to learn from them.  If one was going to go against guys who could fry you with their thoughts, then it was a good idea to have backup you could trust. "Is it because...?"
Dean gestured quickly, a movement that Sam figured meant 'how' since Castiel kept explaining even as Sam wished that the angel would just stop. Or lie. But as far as he knew, Cas was incapable of lying to Dean.
"Bobby!" Oh, yeah. Sam Winchester didn't like when things didn't go according to his script.
“Arrangement.”
"Yet, you stole the Staff of Moses. You're dealing with human souls."
And with the boy being incredibly fluent in ASL, Bobby was starting to think that maybe this Dean wasn't really Dean. Maybe it was an illusion created by the angels to keep them there, away from the real thing they were protecting. At least, that was the theory until Dean got to see Castiel. In that moment, all doubts fled Bobby's mind. As incredible as it was, the mute Dean Derringer had to be Dean Winchester.
The moment Dean looked at Cas, Sam wanted to groan. Because while his brother still looked at him and Bobby with suspicion, especially after Sam's ill attempted hug, and was treating them as complete strangers... as soon as the angel got in his line of view, Dean was staring back as if there was nothing else in the universe except both of them. And Castiel was equally bad, always staring at his brother, as if he could understand mankind just by watching Dean.
Alfie stopped  as he realized that Dean wasn't alone. Dean was starting to wonder exactly how he was going to explain the two hunters in the living room when something strange happened. His brother's face went completely emotionless as he saw the other men. And still... it reminded Dean of how Castiel looked at him.
“Well, at least you tried,” Dean grumbled. Now he needed that beer. Or twenty.
Terror
“You want everyone? That’s just greedy, Angel,” the Shadow rolled their eyes. “And besides, I am no fool. As soon as you they get killed, they’d be back again and someone would want them and I’d get disturbed. That doesn’t help me at all.”
“It’s ok, Cas,” Dean was a bit flattered that Cas had spent his own afterlife talking about him. “Uh… It is not getting me, is it?”
"But I don't understand him!" Sam complained, as Bobby figured he was going to do.
By the time had Sam turned 45, Dean noticed he had stopped aging. Cas said it was a precaution, just to make sure old age didn’t take him before negotiations were over. When Dean held his first niece in his hands, a tiny little girl named Eileen Madison Winchester, he looked no older than 26. A gift/bribery from Rowena who gave Dean eternal youth while on Earth, since the negotiations were slow and going slower.
"Dean has amnesia?" Cas frowned, confused. "Did he have an accident?"
*             *             *
“That's a bit of a long story, Cas,” Sam said as Miracle came bouncing out of the rooms to start begging Dean to pet her, followed by Eileen who had been taking care of her while they went and rearranged the cosmic mess Chuck had left them. “But… I think now we have time to explain it all.”
"He... He disappeared, Sam. I don't know where. One day he was skyping with me about how he was sure you and Dean would win against Lucifer and the next... "  Becky looked down, depressed and Sam felt a little guilty even when he had no idea what had set her off. She had always seemed to happy around him and Dean so this suddenly subdued version of her was off putting, to say the least. "You have to help me find him!"
“Monsters try to escape Purgatory because there’s no exit. My plan includes the idea that they can leave Purgatory… if they’re willing to be reborn as humans. That would include demons and angels.”
First, it had been Dean trying to convince "Alfie" to give up the idea of becoming a hunter, so he could go to college. That had been hard, especially as Sam remembered Dean saying exactly the opposite to him. Right then, Sam had thought that his life couldn't get worse.
Only monsters dealt with souls.
The search for Dean intensifies when Gabriel is brought to the team.
And soon, for the first time in years…
Now he was regretting not letting Chuck keep publishing. As creepy as the idea was that other people could be reading his most intimate thoughts and all his mistakes, right now it would be valuable information, even if the actual *books* ended with Dean saying yes to Michael at Van Nuys. That book wasn't even finished, not really. Becky had pouted a lot about it since the very last moment that she had read was when Zachariah had died at Dean's hands, and Chuck had refused to tell her what had happened afterwards.   Still, he had now something to do while he waited for any news on his brother.
"His nephew vouches for him," Ellen explained. "Apparently, he had to go deep, deep undercover because there were some hard hitting demons after his head. What do you think, kiddo. Does that sound  plausible to you?"
"I'm going to have to ask you to slow down, boy, my ASL is rusty," Bobby said, and that made Dean roll his eyes, before pointing at Marion , at himself, and then at the door, before launching into another long spiel of signing. At least Marion seemed to understand clearly.
No mere mortal could make an angel stumble.
"Enough stalling, Sam, you're here," he told himself as he knocked on the door. Even if Chuck knew the truth, it was all right. Because it meant that he also knew where Dean was.
“I’m not drunk,” Dean said, interrupting Cas, but low enough not to wake up Sam. “Is that your doing?”
A hunting trip to Mexico complicated his after-life situation a bit as Quetzalcoatl decided that Dean should’ve honored with the Aztec warriors of the past, but by then the negotiations were so stalled that the other leaders found the new addition somewhat fun.
Dean signed quickly.
It sounded like something Dean could do. Except... he wouldn't like to leave Alfie alone.
Dean looked at them,  as if he was trying to make a choice. Probably deciding if they were trustworthy or not.
"No, Dean, it'd be easier if we stay here," Cas insisted.
Dean stopped right in front of his apartment, wondering exactly what the hell he was doing.  He wanted to get Chris's name cleaned, of course, but with three of the involved officers dead, he wasn't sure that it was a good idea to bring more attention to the case. More important, the two agents were making him nervous, especially the tall one.
Castiel wasn't fast enough to stop Samandiriel from putting Dean to sleep, which was troubling him, as he felt that once again he had failed to protect Dean... and he had failed his brother too. He had recognized the other angel immediately. Samandiriel, one of the youngest member of his garrison, who was usually relegated to the least important missions. It hurt Castiel to think that yet another of the ones he had considered his friends were now fighting against him. He would've preferred to see any other of his brothers at the moment.
“Don’t ask that.” The Shadow growled, because they had already had an existential crisis over that. “Recapping our agreement… I let every demon and angel out into this realm you call Purgatory, and no one else will ever open a portal to my Realm? You will never bother me again?”
“When you die, you are going to Heaven, Sam. There’s no other claims on your soul,” Cas said, finally sitting down. Dean licked his lips. He was starting to feel he needed a beer for this conversation, but he was sure it wasn’t the time to leave for the kitchen. “Unfortunately, that is not the same for Dean. He sold his soul to Hell, after all.”
