Sam nods. “That sounds good.” He stands, and helps Jack to his feet. Dean staggers up on his own, pulls the keys out, and tosses them to Sam.
“If it makes you feel better, I’m pretty sure I didn’t look for you after you were sucked into the empty.”
The more that Dean looks at the list, the more hopeless things begin to appear. What they have on Chuck isn’t a list of
Dean limps into the bunker after Sam and Jack. He trails about a dozen feet behind them——not for a lack or energy, or an inability to keep up——but simply because he doesn’t think he can face Sam and Jack right now.
Michael says that Cas was a good soldier. That’s not half of it, but Dean figures it’s the highest compliment Michael can give. Even so, he can’t bring himself to respond. Michael doesn’t comment on that——he’s too busy being briefed on everything by Sam——and everyone else has gotten used to Dean not talking, so it almost feels normal.
After everything had calmed down, Dean had realized that he was missing two things very important to him: Miracle, and Baby.
Gunshots ring out: one, two, three, and Dean can see where they strike the ophiotaurus, but they don’t appear to do much damage. In retaliation, Dean slams the angel blade up in a wild guess at where the thing’s torso is. He hits home, and blood gushes everywhere.
“No,” Cas says quickly. He’s almost asleep on his feet, but he can’t pass out now. Sleep means darkness, darkness means the empty, and Cas can’t willingly let himself slip into the dark again. “No. I don’t need——“
From there, the car had remained in Jody’s driveway——save for an occasional drive up and down the road to make sure is would still start. By the time Dean and Cas his visited, it was waiting just behind Jody’s house.
And then Mary had come back, and she didn’t know. She was from a different time, yes, but Dean wasn’t too worried about that. He couldn’t afford to be. Besides, this was his
Cas nods, and both him and Dean almost seamlessly switch into action, and Cas sticks next to Dean as he scopes out the way back to the door.
Dean raises a hand, and for a moment, it looks like he’s going to reach forward and cup Cas’ cheek, but it just hangs in the air for a moment before dropping back to the mattress. There’s a long stretch of silence then, and Dean swallows nervously a couple times before he speaks again.
But Dean isn’t thinking about that. He can’t let himself. He’ll get himself and Sam out of here first, than he’ll cry over Cas and drink himself into oblivion.
Dean nods against the table. “Hmm.” He pushes away the soup. It has started to congeal into something that truly scares Dean, and he doesn’t want it anywhere near him. “It’s supposed to be——“
But the Winchesters couldn’t, so now Sam is going to suffer the consequences. And that, of course, means bye-bye Eileen.
He doesn’t know if he can stop, and that scares him, but he’s not going to take his foot off of the accelerator to try. Somehow, he knows that the consequences from stopping will be far worse than eternal driving.
They talk a lot that night. Or, more rather, Sam and Dean explain everything that’s happened since Cas…
Chuck smiles wide, and Dean seriously thinks that he is adding more teeth than Jack has, because it is fucking
Scribbled-over notes bleed half-dry ink onto Dean’s skin, but he doesn’t notice. He’s moved past looking through books, and decided to run with what he has. If he looks at everything hard and long enough, an answer will emerge. Not the correct one, per se, but an answer of some sort——a clue, at least——something that Dean can try. Besides, if it doesn’t pan out, that’s just another thing Dean can cross off of his list.
——to switch to writing in Enochian when he was tired enough, so this sheet is a sign of a late, exhausting night. A painful reminder of how hard Cas had worked, all for nothing.
Dean makes a face like he has just accidentally swallowed a roach before continuing to speak. “Anyway, after that it’s a whole lot of bullshit about how nice his life was. There——“ Dean breaks off laughing. “There was this whole section about how he had a kid, and named it after me to ‘honor me’ or something.” He flips a couple more pages. “His life was miserable.”
Every day, Dean wakes up, makes breakfast to create the illusion that he’s okay, and then promptly spends the rest of his time attempting not to completely mentally break, and chugging whiskey like it’s the only thing he can keep down. (And at this point, Chuck has rewired Dean’s system to drive him back to alcohol so many times that it might very well be one of the only things Dean can digest without throwing up.)
Jack is exhausted. More tired than any kid should ever be, but he’s determined to punch a hole through reality as soon as he can, sleep or no sleep. He sways on his feet slightly, and steps away from the center of the room to lean against the wall.
“North?” Sam groans in pain as he stands up, and runs his hands through his tangled hair. It falls perfectly into order, and Dean wonders (not for the first time) if Sam has magic hair. “I don’t know for sure; I was kind of busy saving you.”
Dean grabs Cas’ hand and starts to pull him towards the bedrooms before he can think too hard about the exchange that has just occurred. He’s gone too long without sleep to be rational for much longer, so it’s best that he brings Cas where he needs to go before either of them completely lose their minds to sleep deprivation and start babbling nonsense. In Dean’s case that would most likely result in a disgustingly chick-flick-y ramble of a speech in an effort to tell Cas everything that he hasn’t had the chance to yet, and Dean would much rather wait to sort things out when he is better rested.
Keys are trivial in the grand scheme of things, though. What matters is that Sam got what he wanted: wife, kid, picket fence.
——but that shallow, broad question is the only one that passes ‘inspection.’ He doesn’t even attempt to ask any others. It doesn’t feel safe to do so.
In Sam’s humble opinion, it’s kind of a lot for a person to do, especially considering the situation as a whole.
Dean turns to look at Sam, dead seriousness on his still-bloodied face. “We need to get out of the car.”
Cas is wheezing by the time they reach the door, and nearly pitches forward into Dean when he stops.
he stuck to girls? One night stands, hookups, and quickies in the car are more his style anyway. Dean has never been good at relationships anyway, and Cas——or any guy (or celestial wavelength who just so happens to present as a man)——is probably better off without him. Why had he even tried? He's probably just keeping Cas shackled more than anything. Maybe Dean is faking. He probably is. Just wants the attention.
“It’s not real,” Dean points out. “Sam didn’t actually run off with my dog and marry some random chick just to have a kid with my name.” He hands the book back to Cas and taps a paragraph of interest. “It gets worse.”
Sam hasn’t changed much in the grand scheme of things. Yeah, he’s a bit more powerful and he can heal things with a flick of his wrist, but he still hunts, helps other hunters where he can, and seems generally the same. People aren’t scared of him. Not the way they are of Dean. They don’t flinch when he raises his voice, or duck out of the room when he shuffles into the kitchen to get some coffee that will have no effect on his body. They don’t mutter things about him when they think he can’t hear (‘always knew that Winchester boy was weird’), or say those words to his face when they’re brave (or stupid) enough.
They talk about Chuck. About Jack: how he became god, and quickly gave the power up so the world could run itself for once. Naturally, Cas asks where Jack is——at Jody’s——Sam and Dean had sent him there once they had realized that Cas wasn’t going to wake up quickly.
“I was——“ Dean laughs again and tips his head back until it knocks against the headboard. “I was thinking you’d sleep on the other side, but,” He grabs Cas’ arm before he can move away. “This works, too.”
Jack can be ignored, though. He can be, and he will be, because he needs to be for Chuck to find his missing toys.
And just like that, for the first time in a long time, hunting is back to just being a job, and a good one at that. It’s… nice, and, after a while, Cas realizes that he’s finally
Dean can barely breathe when he wakes up. Or, more rather, when he pulls himself out of unconsciousness. He wasn’t sleeping so much as… out. His throat throbs something awful, and his chest aches with held breath. He wheezes as he sits up, and presses an open hand to his chest. His heart is beating wildly, and he can’t quite draw a deep breath yet, but he can
Sam is coping with everything surprisingly well, all things considered. He’s as mentally intact as one in his situation can be, but under his relative mental stability, there’s a strong undercurrent of sadness, and a painful amount of loss.
Regardless of current circumstances, and no matter how secure Heaven seems, Chuck can’t let the Winchesters roam free, so he does his best to keep them on a pre-approved path until he can cook up something else to occupy them. John and Mary are a good second step, Chuck thinks. The boys need to spend more time with their parents.
The order of the universe is natural: monsters with monsters, mistakes with mistakes. Of course Sam and Dean would want to be among things like themselves.
He needs to rest up and conserve his strength, because he’s going to try to take down Chuck again. Jack thinks——he
“Hey, Baby.” He smiled, then turned to Jody, who had been watching the whole scene with a bemused expression.
He steps forward, and a figure appears in the darkness, slumped half against a wall, and curled in on itself. Tentatively, Dean walks towards it, and squints until the figure comes into focus.
The thing drawing him to Cas——the thing that has always drawn him to Cas——is love. It’s something that Dean may never understand, but this time, he follows it all the same.
Sam doesn’t look like he knows anything at the moment, but Dean chooses not to comment on that. Instead, he takes a left turn, and rumbles further into the forest. The road decreases in quality, which isn’t entirely unusual, but before long, it’s reduced to a thin strip of dirt, far too narrow for some Heaven-illusion of Baby to drive down. Dean eases up off the gas.
Dean dying will reset the loop. It has before, and it will again. Then Cas will have time to plan something else to push back the Shadow’s next mind-breaking assault.
This time, Chuck both knows that he’s in danger, and is more than properly aware of the pull that wearing Jack’s body gives him over the Winchesters. It’s a unique situation——in more ways than one——to put it lightly. They’re not on even footing by my means, but it’s more even than they’ve ever been on.
Cas blinks tiredly at it, then at his hands, which are also a faint blue. “My grace is dissipating,” he says plainly. “The empty won’t let me leave with it.”
Dean stands up——god, he’s shaking so hard that Cas can see it, even in the near darkness——and takes a few small steps forward. Dark purple-blue marks have already started to form around his neck.
Dean has tried everything he can think of. From actions to words, to looking for some kind spell on the off-chance it could convince Cas that everything is real.
“You thought it.” Dean sighs and props himself against the wall. “I can still see it on your face.” He stalks one of the books he dropped on top of another book.
“You scared me,” Sam says, decidedly not eating whatever he’s burnt. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done to yourself?”
Cas squeezes. Dean’s hands scrabble at Cas’ in a feeble attempt to dislodge Cas, but it’s futile. Dean is tired, and he’s been caught off-guard. It’s a fatal combination.
Have you... have you ever wanted to fight god? Because the Winchesters sure have, and they're fuckin' gonna.
He keeps walking. Time is ticking down, and he knows it, but he can’t go back, not until he finds Cas.
Stabbing /god himself/ in the back with a literal pocketknife was not on the bucket list, but here Dean is.
Dean Winchester is the Darkness. The holder of the Mark of Cain, and one of the most powerful beings in the universe.
The name echoes off of nothingness, reverberating back to Dean, and eventually fading to nothingness from there. Dean calls out again, walking forward, straining for any sign of Cas. It’s not real, but right now he needs to see Cas more than anything.
“I told you,” Dean huffs, and, god——he looks a wreck. He’s been crying, and there are rings under his eyes that would put raccoons to shame. On top of that, he looks like he hasn’t eaten in a week, which actually makes sense. They haven’t had anything but shitty gas station hot dogs since they came back, and Sam is pretty sure Dean had thrown those up later anyway. “I’m not drunk.”
He needs Sam to read something, but that’s easy enough to convince him to do, so long as Dean fudges the amount of danger the spell will create. Sam will be perfectly safe, of course, but the empty is a hostile place, so Dean will be... less so, even if he’s barely going to enter it.
Dean tries to smile in a self-satisfied manner, but his eyes roll back in his head without his consent, and he passes out again instead.
Mary looks up from her book and tips her head slightly to the side in an attentive way. “Nothing bad, right?”
Sam sighs. “We all do, Dean.” He tilts his head back against the cabinets, and looks at the ceiling. “He was... he was like a brother. Of course we miss him.”
It’s colder on the other side. Colder, but somehow still muggy, but it’s more homey than Heaven. It’s where they need to be, and even with all of the monsters there that certainly have blood out for Sam and Dean, it feels miles safer than Heaven.
It looks like Sam is saying something too, but Dean can’t tell what. He can’t even hear the blood rushing in his ears.
That still doesn’t stop Dean from wanting to scream. It feels like maybe if he lets it out verbally it will cease the agonized howling that invades his mind every hour of every day.
“It’s good to be back,” Cas says, recalling having heard the phrase somewhere else before. It seems fitting for the moment.
He and Cas had driven home in the Impala (and with Miracle) about an hour later, with a promise to return at some point. For Dean, that was when the last piece of the puzzle fell into place for him.
Really, Cas is just ready for this illusion to end. Usually it’s harsher. Usually, Dean brushes Cas off and leaves him to recover from his trip to the empty on his own. Dean never lets Cas share his bed, or takes care of him, or holds Cas like he’s worth something and kisses him like he’s a treasure. All of this is new, and it means that the Shadow is only getting smarter in how it devises its illusions. It knows exactly how to hurt Cas, and has the means to do it.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Dean spies the river he and Sam are looking for, and pulls off of the road to park. No words are exchanged as the car stops and Sam and Dean get out. They stay silent all the way to the river, unready to break the silence, or to speak of things they’re not ready to do much as think about.
“Why are you doing this to me?” Cas whispers, shaking in both body and voice. “I let you take me, I went to sleep like you asked——“ his voice breaks. “Please. Let me sleep. I didn’t do anything.”
Dean’s lips twitch into a small smile. “I feel bad about that now, because I’m pretty sure the damn book would have poisoned her.” To prove his point, Dean steps backwards, picks up the book, and deposits it into Cas’ hands.
Dean steps forward, over his still smoking, tattered jacket, and presses a hand to the darkness. It’s cold——colder than anything Dean has ever felt——but he allows his hand to be swallowed by the dark, and turns to look back at Sam and Eileen before he plunges the rest of his body into the frigid nothing of the empty.
Of course, Cas could always kill himself instead. But that wouldn’t hurt the Shadow, and god, Cas wants the Shadow to hurt, if only a little.
Cas swallows down the last of his coughs, and looks up at Dean, who is crouched in front of the chair that Cas is slumped over in. He looks tired, but relived, light and almost... happy. No. Not ‘almost.’ Dean looks practically
Of course, Chuck hasn’t had time to map out and place surveillance on every inch of Heaven, but he should at least be able to
Dean can’t do this alone. Yeah, he has Sam. He has Jack, Claire, Donna and Jody, Charlie in some capacity, but he...
wrong, there are knives in the kitchen that Dean can use if he needs to. He needs to stop worrying so much. The bunker is one of the safest places in the world, and Cas can take care of himself.
And with that, Sam comes out of the store, bags swinging from his arms, just in time to distract Dean from his impending mental breakdown.
The whole situation doesn’t nothing but confuse Cas, but he supposes that is what the Shadow wants him to be.
He’s breathing——barely——and his heart is beating slowly and irregularly, but other than that, Cas might as well be dead.
A low moo emanates from the silty river’s edge, and it would be almost comical if Dean didn’t have so much adrenaline pumping though him. This is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, but there’s something about not being able to /see/ the thing you’re hunting. He flips the blade in his hand, trying to track the sound, and the next thing he knows, his feet have been bowled out from under him, and he’s on the ground with a splitting pain in his gut.
It had seemed like the right thing to do at the time, though. Dean loves driving, he really does, but something about this feels artificial. Maybe that's just Heaven. None of it is real anymore, but it seems wrong somehow. It's the right thing to do, though.
“What makes you think I’ll do what you want?” The Shadow asks, leaning in. “Is it because of your new title?” It chuckles. “I hate to break it to you, sweetie, but I was around long before the Darkness——long before god——and I’ll be here a long time after.” It smirks with Cas’ face, and a hole punches into Dean’s heart.
Cas leans into Dean, and rests his head against Dean’s shoulder with a contented sigh. The day will start for real soon, and life will pick up, but he’s content to sit here for the moment. He loves the rush of the bunker when it’s filled with people, helping Jack as he continues to learn about the world and his place in it, and hunting with Dean when they find a case to take on, but it’s moments like this that he really treasures.
——if he can take back control of his body that he can most likely eject Chuck. Or, at the least, he can weaken him enough so that someone can kill them both.
A wide, sick smile crosses Chuck’s face as one of his sensors is pinged. The Winchesters have been found.
Chuck can only hope it lasts, too, because Jack has made himself known, and that means that he has started whining again. Even though he’s pitifully weak compared to Chuck, he’s
They’re about a month from when Dean died, as it turns out. That’s kind of friggin’ weird, though, seeing as Sam has about forty years of memories that say
Dean shucks off his jacket and spares one last, lingering look at the bloody handprint soaked into the fabric before throwing it atop the worst of the fire. The dark, murky swirl on the wall spreads, then shifts into an amorphous, rolling plane, and the fire calms.
That’s just a day in the life of a Winchester, though. Death around every corner, sometimes literally. Sometimes she’s banging on the door, ready to kill you and one of the only people you’ve ever loved, just because you couldn’t kill her first.
Dean falls asleep in Cas’ room one week after they bring Cas home, and——as luck would have it——that’s the day Cas finally wakes up.
It’s a miracle that Dean isn’t scared of Cas. Really, nothing much changes from how they had been acting before, save for the fact that Cas knows the world around him is real now.
So he scrabbles his way back to some kind of awareness in the dark, desolate vacuum of what his brain assumes the empty would look like. If there’s one good thing about dreams, it’s that in them Dean can say things he never could otherwise. Things that he's not brave enough to say in real life.
Chuck seems mostly occupied by Sam at the moment, so he doesn’t hear Dean approach, or if he does, he doesn’t have the time to pay attention to it. Normally, Dean would have no qualms about stabbing Chuck until he can’t get up, but this is Chuck in
Dean decides that now isn’t the time to mention that Cas isn’t exactly a man. Instead, he just focuses on not crying.
Well, one way or another, he’s gonna end with this thing’s intestines draped around his neck like an infinity scarf.
Dean huffs. “What a dick.” He sighs and blinks away the last of his tears. He pulls a knife out of his jacket——old, paranoid habits are proving more useful than they should be——flips the blade to his palm, and holds the handle out to Sam.
Thank you for reading so far. Comments and kudos are greatly appreciated, and will be kept in a photo album, and pressed between the pages like flowers.
In a situation like this, it’s hard for Dean not to feel like he’s twelve years old again: unable to leave the house, and rapidly running out of things to keep Sam alive and healthy. It’s tiring, and every day Dean feels more and more like this is all futile. They’ve tried this before, and they’ve died because of it.
It has to be done, though, and Dean is a master of doing things that shouldn’t need to be done. He doesn’t think Sam will hold anything substantial against him for this, but Sam aside, Dean is never going to stop beating himself up over this (among other things).
“I miss you,” Dean whispers, pressing himself as close to Cas as he can. One of Dean’s hands is in Cas’ hair, gently holding his head.
It’s quiet, and there’s none of the fanfare that Chuck seems to revel in so much, but it’s petrifying all the same. The air crackles with energy: awe-inspiring, and wholly terrible.
However, staying detached from the Winchesters is easier said than done when Dean won’t leave Cas alone.
The other side of the bed is cold when Dean wakes up. He blinks in confusion, and pushes himself into a sitting position. The blanket on top of his pools around his legs, and he kicks it off so that he can stand.
Instead, Dean hangs up, throws the phone across the room, and cries silently. His shoulders shake, and he gasps for breath between sobs, but can’t seem to make any noise aside from breathing. It’s part scary, part relieving, because if Dean could speak now, he’d surely be screaming.
“It’s okay, Cas,” Dean says softly. He walks over to Cas, and lays his hand on Cas’ shoulder. “We can leave the lights on.”
Still, Dean carries him. Dean carries Cas’ cold body through what feels like miles of darkness, frigid air, and nothingness. He has to run at the end, when the Shadow finally catches on to what’s happening, and almost ends up dropping Cas a couple times, but they make it.
Levels of unreality aside, Cas still has nightmares, and that’s what has him jerking awake at three in the morning, soaked with sweat, and shaking like a leaf. It’s dark——so dark——and for a moment Cas is certain that he’s broken the illusion and woken up to see the empty as it truly is, but then he’s thrown from his racing thoughts back into his body, and it becomes apparent he’s still trapped in the illusion.
Sam pokes his head out of the kitchen, sets his expression in a frown, and points towards the table in the kitchen. “Sit. I’m making you eat something.”
Cas nods, and relaxes back into Dean’s hold. Dean lets go of Cas’ arm, and backs up a few inches so he won’t push Cas off the bed if he rolls over. Cas follows, eyes drooping, and yawns as Dean settles back down.
pretty much juiced him. He looks back to the road, and settles into the driver’s seat the way he should: confident and relaxed. Sam gives him a worried look.
Sam, but he has to be here, because there’s no way to get out of the car that Dean knows of. At the thought of the car, Dean realizes something else: the car is moving. Slowly, but it’s still
(Of course, save for the panic attacks that he couldn’t talk about to a wife he can’t remember. And the persistent voice in the back of his head telling him to drive off a cliff. And——)
Dean doesn’t do that, though. Instead, what he does is curl up on his bed, and let his tears soak into the mattress until he passes out.
“I don’t know!” Dean leans back against a tree. “I don’t know——okay!” His eyes are shiny, worried, and bloodshot. “There's always a door, though, and I know that I’m grasping as straws here, but I need——I need
That had been that, and everything had become so much easier since then. No one had really cared. It hadn’t been weird.
Or, more rather: without Cas, who is trapped in the empty for eternity. Cas, who died for Dean, without knowing that Dean loves him back.
Sam finishes the first section, and Dean lights a match before dropping it into a puddle of dark holy oil. Black flames leap up and touch the sigils on the wall, and Dean steps back as they spark angrily.
It hurts so badly, and it makes Dean want to rip his hair out. It makes him want to howl and punch the wall until his hands are nothing more than torn skin, blood, and bone.
Sam’s expression shifts from something like despair to worry, and he unconsciously raises his hand to his throat. “Is something wrong with your voice?”
“Sam?” Dean asks, wincing as the floor swims in front of him. He’s nauseously lightheaded. With a jolt, Dean realizes that he can’t remember how long it has been since he’s eaten something. He quickly redoubles his efforts to reach the source of the smell of food, and (hopefully) Sam, making a conscious effort not to trip over his feet.
“Spending the weekend with Claire and Kaia,” Sam answers as he passes the baby to Eileen. “They’re taking out a vampire nest up in Michigan.”
“Hey,” Dean calls softly. “Brought you some food. I dunno if you’re hungry, but you should eat something.” He sets the plate down on Cas’ bedside table. “It’s——um——I know I don’t usually want to get up after…” he trails off, looking for the right word. “A bad night. I thought this might help.”
Maybe the constant driving is a good thing, now that Dean considers it. Driving keeps him moving; he’s not on the run exactly, but stopping feels dangerous.
Sam and Dean follow the road until the trees begin close in on them, and asphalt turns to dirt. In a way, it’s almost eerily similar to the almost endless road that he and Sam had been on less than two weeks ago. From where Deanis now, it feels like nothing but more road, more trees, and an unhanging, monotonous, landscape.
taken care of years ago. It doesn’t do for the epitome of masculinity to stutter, or have panic attacks.
The fear that courses through Dean’s broken body as he dies is delicious, and the raw sadness that comes from Sam is almost as entertaining. Really, it’s a shame that Chuck needs to store the boys in Heaven——they’re just so much fun to hurt.
Dean hums in agreement, pulls Cas close, and walks them into the flickering, slowly shrinking, tear in the world.
Fuck it, he’s already told Cas that he loves him. “I could keep watch if you need me to,” Dean adds.
Eventually (after probably far too long), the tears and heaving sobs trail off, and Cas ends up leaning heavily against Dean. Every part of him is exhausted, and his limbs feel like they’re filled with sand. Thankfully, Dean doesn’t seem at all annoyed by Cas’ tears soaking into the sleeve of his shirt, or the fact that Cas is halfway to practically laying in his lap. If anything, he just seems concerned. Cas doesn’t even need to be an angel anymore to sense the worry that Dean is loudly broadcasting with his body language.
Chuck likes that. He feels that the Winchesters deserve to suffer after everything they have done to him. They had been the stars of the show, too. All that was required of them was compliance. All that they had needed to do was follow where Chuck led, and jump when he told them to. It was a simple job——so easy that even the most basic apes could complete it.
Again, anger flares in his chest, and with a sudden fuck-all attitude, Dean lets it unfurl. Something sparks inside him, and it ignites as the nothingness surrounding him and the Shadow starts to shake. For the first time since the beginning——since the explosion after Chuck’s demise——the painful itch under Dean’s skin diminishes, and he relishes it. It feels the same as when he gave in to the mark, but he tries to ignore that. Maybe if he uses enough of this anger he’s been saddled with he can over power the Shadow long enough to find Cas.
That makes Chuck even more angry than he already is, and sixteen seconds later, Dean’s right arm looks like it’s grown an extra joint. He just grits his teeth, lets blood dribble from his mouth, and tells himself that it will all be over soon. Either Jack will win, or Chuck will. He stops hurting both ways.
do——is yell at Chuck——scream his throat raw——and hope that all the noise and anger and thrashing dampens the hold Chuck has over his body, but Chuck hasn’t so much as acknowledged Jack since he had last put him in his place, and Jack needs to save his energy. That in mind, he pushes back against Chuck’s attempts to smother him just enough to stay conscious, and waits.
Cas——who treats his shitty romance books with the care one would give a valuable ancient tome——drops the book onto Dean’s side table, looks Dean dead in the eyes, and says:
“He had made a deal with the empty. Back when Jack died. The first time. In exchange for bringing Jack back, the empty would take Cas. But only——only when he was happy. Only when he let himself be happy.” A weak sob wrenches its way from Dean. “He told me he loved me, Sam. That was——that was it.” He tips his head back against the cabinet and lets fresh tears run down the sides of his face. “I never got to say it back.” He closes his eyes.
Blood trickles down his side and soaks into his pants as he gathers what he needs, and gets ready to stitch himself up. The first step——obviously——is usually to chug enough whiskey so that it doesn’t hurt, and then go to town on your meatsuit, but the idea of alcohol makes Dean sick right now, so he forgoes it in favor of biting his tongue against the pain.
They stay close together, and eat in the kitchen. Dean ends up crowding himself into the corner with a bottle of water, knees to his chest. His eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, and shiny with tears that he won’t let himself cry. Jack drops into a light doze pretty quickly after he eats, and ends up curled on his side, looking much more peaceful than anyone should after going through what he has. Sam takes it upon himself to tidy up the kitchen while Dean focuses on simply continuing to exist.
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, a deep score appears in the earth on the bank opposite to Dean’s. Behind Dean, Sam goes completely still, and scans the bank. Another divot scars the muddy bank, but no beast shows itself.
Sam doesn’t seem to notice the difference——or, at least, he’s so relieved to see ‘Dean’ recovering from his nearly suicidal grief that any imperfections in Chuck’s characterization are trivial. From there, Castiel is all but forgotten, and the real Dean doesn’t even bother trying to fight his way back to control. Chuck wonders if Dean is even close to mentally intact enough to fight. It doesn’t matter in the end, though, because he is no longer a problem.
“Morning to you, too,” Dean grumbles, wiping his mouth on his blood-crusted jacket. His head is pounding worse than any hangover he’s ever had, and his stomach is about ready to revolt again, even though there’s nothing in it.
That’s a lie. Every single tree in the forest is almost identical, which only serves to help Chuck in the long run, Sam supposes. The more confused him and Dean are, the easier it will be for Chuck to take them out (again).
Jack usually spends his weekends at the bunker, and weekdays bouncing between Sam and Eileen’s place, and the bunker. He’s finally not in the middle of some world-ending event or another, so he’s learning how to socialize, and finishing up school. It’s all going surprisingly smoothly, which is a relief. All things considered, Dean had expected everything to be a bit more stressful, but it just... wasn’t.
“Something’s there,” Sam whispers. He has one hand on his gun, and his entire body is tensed——ready for battle. The only difference between him and Dean is that Dean has his hand on an angel blade rather than a gun.
Dean knows; he’s tried to get relief from the anger before, but the formally pleasant buzz that whiskey gave him just had made him so afraid that he’d end up hurting someone that he locked himself in the dungeon for a week. Not that the time mattered, because Dean can’t fucking die, and food and water are a non-factor at this point, along with sleep, which proves impossible.
At least now his words are preserved. The last thing he said was to Cas——not what he should have said——but it was to Cas nonetheless. No. It was
too much, and Dean doesn’t know how much more of this he can live through in rapid succession without breaking down and ending up run through with a sharp bit of metal again.
Death will probably be more tolerable this time, now that no one is going to force Dean to drive for eternity and fuck with his brain until he can’t remember how to breathe. If he’s lucky, the empty will be waiting for him when he bites it. At least then he’ll be with Cas.
Fine. No letter, than. Dean will just either disappear forever with no explanation, or come back with Cas.
However, also due to his past experiences in Purgatory, Dean knows the place like the back of his hand, and that means he knows exactly how to find the door back to earth. Or, well, he should.
It lights up immediately. Pages curl, blacken, and crumble away into almost invisible ashy flakes within seconds. The pyre burns with it, albeit a bit more slowly, and Dean and Cas watch as Chuck’s hazy fever-dream of an ideal ending breaks apart, and starts to drift away in the gentle, cool breeze.
On another note: I looked, and there's not really shit on the ophiotaurus because it's in, like, one ancient book, and an episode of my little pony(???) so I just kind of made up a bunch of shit.
Jack is alive, though, and that’s better than nothing. It looks like he’s still becoming used to being in control of his body again, because he’s busy staring down at his slightly shaky hands like he’s never seen them before. He flexes his fingers, and smiles at the results, then looks up at Sam. “Can we go home?”
Dean sits, chugs the water Sam shoves his way, and makes a valiant attempt to choke down whatever the fuck that Sam has scalded beyond edibility.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean pleads. One of his hands comes up to cup Cas’ tearstained cheek. “Say something.” He brushes some of Cas’ tears away with his thumb. “I gotta know if you’re okay.”
And, as always, Chuck gives zero shits about what Sam can and cannot do, so he decides to attack almost immediately. Being god, he’s well-versed when it comes to fighting (of course it’s easier when you can automatically download everything into your brain).
Well, that was fun. Next up: rescuing everyone's favorite gay angel from superhell! Or maybe just Dean crying, who knows.
It’s excusable——after all, they are out of practice——and dealing with dead (rotting, rancid) bodies is never the easiest thing, if only because of the smell. It really is a horrible smell.
Cas is sitting on the counter, legs crossed, coffee in his hands. He sits up a bit when he sees Dean, and takes a sip of his coffee.
It hurts, not like being stabbed or shot, but in a soul-deep, cleansing way. It doesn’t feel good by any measure, but the weight off of Cas’ chest when he starts to let himself cry is near enough to make him dizzy. At some point he abandons the idea of keeping quiet, and just lets the tears flow. He’s dimly aware of Dean standing up and sliding into the seat next to him, and the warm arm that suddenly appears around his shoulders, but he can’t focus on it now. All Cas seems capable of at the moment is producing more tears.
Dean’s word is so quiet that it would be hard to hear if Sam hadn’t been focusing on Dean. He sounds sad. Sad, desperate, and so, so scared.
There’s no telling exactly what is needed, seeing as few have attempted to travel to the empty, but some of this angel stuff seems instinctive, and Dean trusts Jack to do this correctly. He doesn’t have any other options, but he genuinely trusts Jack. After all, if he can’t trust his kid, who can he trust?
The painted sigils on Dean’s body have started to itch. He wants to pick them off, but that would mean almost certain death.
because otherwise——fuck.” Dean raises a hand to his face, and fresh blood coats his fingers. “T-this is why I’m not supposed to think about it. This is what happens if I do.”
He’s dangerous. Full of power——dark, horrible power that he never asked for or wanted to be anywhere near——and malice. It’s never-ending, unmovable, and unable to be dulled, even when paired with enough alcohol to kill anyone who isn’t an immortal deity.
Dean had come damn close to tears when he sees the car again, and can’t stop himself from running towards it and running his hand over the shiny roof.
Cas’ head whips to Dean, and he shuffled back a couple feet. He stops. Forces himself to look at Dean. Steadies himself.
“Jack, are you sure that you can do this?” Sam asks. He’s standing just inside the doorway, looking unsure.
Behind Sam, Dean manages to get to his feet, and nearly collapses as he does. It feels like his entire chest has been shattered——and who knows, it might have been——but he stays on his feet, and surveys the scene with pain-bleary eyes.
Cas doesn’t slow down until he reaches the mostly closed door to Dean’s room. Then he freezes, breath caught in his throat. He doesn’t want to see Dean’s body. He——he can’t. He can’t bear to see what he did to Dean, when all Dean had done since Cas woke up was care.
It had taken almost half an hour to get Cas to look at Dean, and even then, the only thing that Cas could seem to say was ‘you’re not real’ with varying degrees of fear, anger, and defeat. That had scared the shit out of Dean, but Cas had eventually calmed down enough to fall asleep, though he hadn’t stopped shaking until an hour later.
Is this what he’s been reduced to? Sending people on hunts when he can make himself talk to them and hiding in his room the rest of the time? Crying because he doesn’t know what to do and shaking too hard to raise a drink to his lips, and then throwing that drink across the room because if he dulls the pain even a little he runs the risk of killing everyone and everything he’s ever loved and cared about?
Cas studies Dean——the illusion of Dean——going purple-faced in the dim light of the room, and squeezes harder. Dean paws at Cas’ hands weakly, and a terrified wheeze escapes him. Still, Cas doesn’t let go. If he kills Dean, the illusion ends. That’s how it always ends. Then they can start over. Maybe next time Dean will be less caring. Then it won’t hurt as much to know it isn’t real.
After it becomes clear that Cas isn’t going to wake up quickly, Sam hooks Cas up to an IV to get fluids and nutrients into him. The fact that Cas needs an IV scares Dean almost as much as the unsteady
Chuck might be dead, but so is Jack. Dean has tried to kill Jack before (then again, how much of that was really him, and how much of that had been plotted by Chuck?) but this is the first time that he’s followed through with it.
Dean shakes his head, but laughs again, sounding on the verge of hysterics. He wipes at his tears, and they feel slimy against his hand. “I never told you what happened when we went after Billie, did I?”
They spend the better part of three hours warding the walls of the bunker from anything and everything. Sigils and symbols from every religion are scattered across the outside door, and the molding of every entryway.
If Dean was able, he’d keep Sam out of this, but Sam is just as entrenched in this battle as Dean, and they need to stick together if they want to survive, let alone make another attempt at killing Chuck.
All the same, Dean throws the knife into the first trash can he sees. At this point, there are far too many bad memories attached to it to justify keeping it. He leaves Sam and Jack to their business, and locks himself in his room before stripping off his jacket, flannel, and shirt. The jagged gash on his side protests, and decides to continue bleeding when Dean keeps moving about.
Sleep is the only relief Dean gets from his ever-racing thoughts, but even then it’s scattered hours, usually either broken by a nightmare or the need to throw up the two-and-a-half bottles of whiskey that finally let him pass out.
Cas opens his mouth, but can’t form the words. His throat clicks, and he closes his mouth, regroups, and tries again. “It’s d——“
Dean sets his jaw, and summons the most determined look that he can. “Then we’re going to find one.”
He clinches his fists, ripping grass from the earth——he’s on the ground, outside——and chokes out a pitiful howl. Vision ringed with red and black, Dean makes a valiant attempt to blink away the pain, and fails miserably.
“If he was gone, why did our lives go the way they did?” Dean asks. “You married some chick whose name you can’t remember, got out of the life to ‘honor me,’ and I——I don’t even know how I died, Sam!” Dean can’t keep his hands steady. “I don’t——I don’t know how I died. C-C-Cas won’t see us, and I can’t stop driving!” Tears track their way down Dean’s cheeks and cut lines through the dried blood on his face as he speaks. “I can’t talk about this. I
Dean hasn’t slept in 48 hours, but that’s okay. He’s gone longer without, and will probably do so in the future. Still, he’s exhausted. He can’t remember the last time he was well-rested, and doubts that will change any time soon.
If Chuck is being perfectly honest, what he has going now is one of his best plans to date——and that’s saying something, because Chuck has carried out a lot of plans over eternity. But even his most bloody apocalypse is lackluster compared to what he’s done now.
“This isn’t about that.” Dean slowly draws the angel blade from his coat and holds it up. “If you’re coming back, you need to fall. The empty won’t let you out with your grace.” he adjusts his grip on the blade with cold-numbed fingers. The non-air of the empty is freezing, and Dean is starting to shake from the cold. “There’s no other way. I’ve looked, and I know it’s not what you want, but I...” Dean’s words fail him.
The empty is just that——empty——eternal miles of nothing. Pure darkness in all directions. It’s suffocating. Petrifying.
Sam nods, and starts searching for kindling. Dean looks at the monster and contemplates what exactly his next course of action is going to be.
Jack nods from where he’s standing in the center of the room. They’re in the dungeon, of course, because they have to be. It’s the last place that the empty had broken through to earth, so it should be the easiest place to break through again, though the last word to describe this feat is ‘easy.’
For the first time in years, he was happy. Not content, not clinging to brief, in-the-moment joy, but a real happiness. The kind that sticks in your chest, is obvious in the way you speak, and makes you feel light.
Sam doesn’t end up on the floor at five in the morning, drunk off his ass, with only incomprehensible scribbles to show for it.
Dean can be loyal to a fault, and more often than not, it’s been... Dean won’t say helpful, but it’s kept him alive before. It’s also killed him in separate situations, but hasn’t everything at one point or another?
A cold chill suddenly invades the room, despite the heat the fire should be providing, and Dean shivers. Dimly, he registers Sam resume his reading, and starts working on the next step.
He can’t remember the last time he did that, much less anything else. He remembers doing those things, but his sense of time is so skewed that it could have been anywhere from thirty seconds to a hundred years ago. Not that time matters when Cas is stuck in an eternal torment, courtesy of the Shadow.
“Not here,” Dean hisses, his words gritty and pained. “Away from the road. The further, the better.” He stumbles to his feet, and starts limping away from the car. Whatever Chuck did to Dean fucked with his entire body, not just his head this time.
He shifts in his seat to face Cas better. Cas scrubs the last of the tears from his face, and looks over at Dean. His eyes are tear-glittery, too, but not broken and dull-looking like they normally are when Dean breaks down. It’s all tears of exhaustion, joy, relief. Not sadness.
Dean has torn storage room #39 (third basement level) to shreds. There are boxes everywhere——they had already been everywhere, but now they’re in a state of complete disarray——and artifacts scattered to every corner. In the middle of it all, Dean is picking through the nth unsearched box, looking desperately for the one solid lead he’s come across.
Something tells Dean to step out of the car. He does, and looks off the edge of the bridge. Quietly, so subtly he’s hardly aware of his thoughts, he wonders what would happen if he jumped off. A low, nervous tug in his gut tells him to stop considering it.
Dean wakes up covered in sigils. Sticky, drying blood coats his arms, neck and chest in intricate swirls and clean lines, and a lumpy, rusty-springed mattress is doing its best not to squeak underneath Dean's weight. So, he's in a bed. A crappy motel bed, but it’s still better than the ground had been.
It’s almost like Cas goes numb after that. He doesn’t talk unless Dean prompts him——save for the almost nightly repetition of
Sam waves Dean’s thanks off, and goes back to studying what he has to read. There are cues in the margins: places where Sam will need to pause for Dean to light something on fire, sprinkle spell ingredients, or paint another sigil. Sam does his best to memorize what he can while Dean grabs Eileen, who has agreed to serve as some kind of damage control if
He doesn’t want to think about what will happen if he fails to open a door to the empty. Even more than that, he doesn’t want to think about what will happen if he gets there and can’t find Cas.
And Chuck will find them. Even if he needs to tear apart the perfect Heaven that he has set up for them to do it.
His mouth goes dry and his hands start to sweat as he approaches Dean’s room. (Dean calls it theirs. Like that means anything.)
Cas nods. His head feels like it’s filled with water, and he’s slowly losing the weird cold numbness in his limbs as he warms up, which just makes his skin prickle. He lethargically looks around the rest of the room, and finds Sam, who is towards the back of the room, trying to hold up a half-asleep Jack.
The silence continues, and the atmosphere thickens. Words, thoughts, and feelings rattle around Dean’s chest, nearly suffocating him with their attempts to be heard. Even now that he knows he can have Cas, he can seem to make the words he wants to say order themselves properly.
Well, now Dean knows what happens when he thinks about something he’s not supposed to hard enough for someone to notice.
He tries not to let himself become too attached to Sam and Dean. That way it’ll be a little easier to inevitably watch them die, or Cas will feel less betrayed when they finally end him. After all, that’s how the Shadow likes to end things: in death, betrayal, and hurt.
“Human,” Cas grunts, pushing himself back into a standing position. He still leans heavily on Dean, though, and winces as the last of his grace drips to the ground. “It’s cold here.”
It’s strange——not a bad strange, but something new and unfamiliar——but Cas doesn’t mind that. Somewhat awkwardly, he climbs into bed next to Dean and fits his body half next to, half on Dean.
the Winchesters. He had controlled them for years. He’ll be able to figure out their next course of action easily enough, right?
comes from across the river, and Dean’s breath freezes in his lungs when he sees what looks like nothing disappear into the current.
The ground is cool and grassy, a stark contrast to the stuffiness of the car, and Dean collapses on top of it with a wheezy sigh. “Out,” he barks at Sam, who practically launches himself out of the car once prompted.
Despite the stark white suit that Chuck has dressed Jack up in, he radiates an impure power so striking that Dean has no idea how he hadn’t noticed it earlier. He’s thrown back to the last time someone who wasn’t Jack had inhabited Jack’s body; right after Chuck had revealed his true nature.
Jack shrugs. “I don’t think so,” he says, with a hint of a question in his voice. “I should just need to concentrate.”
And Dean——oh, poor, poor Dean——dies in his brother’s arms, completely in the dark as to what’s happening, or how he got there. All he knows is that he can’t feel his legs, and that Sam is crying.
“D’you want to stop?” Dean asks, almost desperately. They’ve been driving since the bridge——Dean has no idea how long that has actually been, but it seems like a long time——and he has started to feel trapped. Ever since he had asked about Eileen, Sam has been quiet, too, which doesn’t help the mood. The only thing that has been breaking the thick tension of silence between Sam and Dean thus far is the radio, and even that has taken to fuzzing out in places.
For probably the first time in his life, Castiel was grateful that Zachariah liked his half-siblings and promoted them whenever he felt they had earned it. Generally, that was well before any of the other highly ranked officers in the army would have done it, but the old alpha was often right. Uriel was an ass, but a good warrior, and Raphael made up for any political grace his younger brother lacked. Hester was snappy but loyal, and Zachariah had led them well for the better part of a decade. "I won't let you down, brother," the young alpha replied, bowing his head and projecting gratitude into his honey-tinted hickory scent. He had often been mocked for being an alpha who smelled just a little too sweet, but anyone who underestimated him learned their lesson quickly. He had fought his way into the army and he would continue to fight against anyone who judged another for their scent before getting to know them. It had made him an incredible trainer, so giving him a camp full of new recruits was the perfect solution to the army's lack of new blood.
Cas chuckled, the tension in his chest easing somewhat. "Okay, what do you know about this omega space thing?"
Dean waved around the field, Cas's eyes following the gesture as another cluster of his pack mates joined the crowd around him. "What do you smell here, even before I came?"
Sam gestured toward Gabriel and Lucifer, grinning as they both flared their grace just enough for their eyes to light up, a few of the hunters stepping back in shock. “We’ve got two archangels of our own. Once we break through the angels, Gabriel and Lucifer here will capture their brother.”
Adam grinned and reached up to pat Cas's leg. "I've been going to Pack events for years, any time I could. It's nice to get to know everyone before you're old enough to join. Will your dad let them come with you?"
"If I'm going to mate, it might as well be to a Head Alpha, and my brother already called dibs on Dean Winchester."
Balthazar turned to face his new friend uncertainly, slowly lowering his hands. "Steve, we have to fight!"
"I can see that I have already deviated from your previous education. This is the reason that the casual partners you had in the past did not create any problems for you. The bond forms because you both will it, but the mating happens because the wolf must be satisfied. It is possible for an unmated person to create a bond with a mated one, but the wolves would never allow you to be together. This is why the laws protecting omegas were created six hundred years ago, because it was too easy for alphas to force an unwanted mating that would prevent the omega from ever having a loving bond with someone else. Chuck had to execute forty or fifty alphas before the rest of them figured out that he meant business. I only ever met one of the omegas back then who was stuck in a forced mating, and he begged me to take his life."
"I'm kinda hating this whole feelings thing," Gabe grumbled, still tucked as tightly against Dean's chest as he could manage.
Dean sat up straighter at the omega's name, stiffening at the use of his full name. "What's wrong with him, Charlie?"
"You could play World of Warcraft with me next weekend," Ash offered, blushing slightly as he passed the dice to Gadreel. "I don't know if you like MMORPGs, but it's the best of them."
Victor looked around, quickly taking note of the school nurse hovering nearby, the officers directing traffic on Louisiana, the officer pushing a resisting teen into the back of his cruiser, and the blood on Sam's knuckles. He spotted Gabe tucked against the alpha's side and beckoned him closer. He vaguely remembered the blond from the afternoon he pulled Dean over on 19th, and he knew that John's middle son was dating an omega named Gabe who fit this kid's general description. "Hi, I'm Victor Henriksen, the Police Chief. Can you tell me what happened this morning, Gabe?"
"That's reasonable. My baby brother, Prince Samandriel, he is kinda like you. I've never seen it in an alpha before, but I guess it's not unusual to not react in an overtly sexual manner to the scents around you. You're welcome to sleep with us again tonight if it's still cold, even if you wake up with a boner."
"Yeah. We've been courting for months . . . recently we kind of started experimenting with things that wouldn't trigger an incomplete mating bond, and some of those things gave me a taste of omega space. Dean never lets me stay long; I think he's worried that I'll get . . . lost?"
"It sounds like a malady that I may be able to heal, but I need to meet him. I'm assuming that he cannot be moved, since he didn't travel here with you."
Mary leaned against her mate's side, eyes on the two young pups intently watching the game. "Adam said that Alfie's scent is already coming in, though it's faint. He's probably going to have his heat a lot earlier than his older brothers."
Gabe nodded and accepted the offering, digging into his meat with gusto. Sam chuckled as he shifted back to wolf form, tearing giant chunks of meat off of his leg and practically swallowing them whole. As soon as all three were done, the wolves rubbed their bloody muzzles clean and shifted back, hoisting the buck’s carcass into the branches of the tree Gabe was leaning against. “Dean and the others will come through here in a few hours,” Benny explained, repacking the supplies and swinging the rope over his chest. “They’ll make quick work of this, and they’ll know that we made it this far safely.”
, something so intense and soul-piercing that the prince couldn't look away. The baby already had the faintest scent, cinnamon and apple blossom, and Cas let himself learn that aroma and tuck it away in the back of his mind for later.
It was years before he said it again. In that time, he was manipulated by Naomi, almost killed Dean, and tricked by Metatron into kicking the angels out of Heaven. He had lived as a human and been killed for his efforts, finally regaining his grace and some level of usefulness to the brothers. When the Darkness rose and Lucifer offered himself to help defeat her, Cas had agreed to become the archangel's vessel. The tenth time he said it, Lucifer was speaking with his voice, grabbing the words from his memory and offering them to the hunter, but it hadn't really been Cas talking. He hadn't been hosting the Devil for very long yet, so he still peeked out from time to time to make sure the disguise would hold. He knew that Dean and Sam wouldn't like what he had done, but it had been the best choice at the time.
Cas shuddered and leaned into the comfort of Dean's touch. "That's what worries me the most. Mike and Luci were nearly feral when they went into rut the first time, and honestly they aren't much better now. They mostly try to kill each other, though, so we're fine. Gabe was visiting Aunt Amara when he went into heat the first time, and he won't tell me about it. I don't know what's going to happen when it's my turn."
"Not really. My parents were gone most of the time, and the only thing I ever wanted was to be able to run with them."
Cas nodded. “At least a dozen times,” he whispered, unable to meet Dean’s gaze. “After the last time I was punished for arguing with my garrison commander, Gabriel had a huge fight with Michael, and I never saw him again. Naomi perfected her reprogramming method soon after.”
Mary nodded and left, pausing at the room Cas had been assigned to catch his scent. She knew where he must have gone, but she had to be sure. Following the faint thread of honeysuckle and clover, Mary found herself standing outside her oldest son's room, passing Sam and his sleepy friends on the way. She opened the door and slipped inside, closing it softly behind herself as her eyes fell on the bed.
Lucifer nodded, leaning one arm out the window as he watched his siblings move away from the car. "Might end up being a job if we play it right. It would be better than the crap ones we have after school right now."
Chuck grinned and gestured for Sam to walk closer, blue eyes examining the child. He was growing too fast for his body to keep up, arms longer than expected and legs not coordinated yet. "I have four alpha sons; I completely understand your plight. My son Gabriel, general of the Seventh Legion, will be in town in four days to pick up new recruits. Have Sam at the training camp north of the city by then and he will be accepted as an officer in training."
Sam reached up and ran his fingers through Gabriel's sweat-damp hair, smiling softly at the smaller man. "Did you play back in your old school?"
"Yeah, well, your dad loves you enough to want you to be happy, truly happy, with your mate. You're lucky to have him."
"My mother died when I was a baby," the boy explained, either not noticing or not caring about the soldiers standing around them as he talked to the blond alpha. "My older brother pretty much raised me, but Dad sold him to the prince a few days ago and sent me here. I don't know if I'll ever see Dean again."
Damian ran a soothing hand down Cas's back, smiling as the younger omega curled up against his side.
Balthazar growled and tightened his fist around the slender wooden shaft almost hard enough to break it. "I don't need your criticism."
"Sure, Charlie, what's up?" The two alphas spoke at the same time, glancing at each other and rolling their eyes as they waited for the redhead to answer.
He spotted the police officer get out of his car, and he felt a spark of hope blossom in his chest. He knew that it wasn't protocol, but this guy was one of his dad's best friends, so Dean popped his seatbelt and slipped out of the Impala, meeting the tall, dark-skinned alpha halfway.
"It's in the future," Patience assured her leader. "That much I know for sure. It won't happen until after they reach the city."
"It's not really about being controlled," Cas murmured, trying to figure out how to explain the sensation to Dean. "I've had alphas use Voice on me before, and I've wanted to rip their throats out. I broke Michael's jaw the last time he tried it. But you didn't try to control me, so it was different. You wanted to please me, and I wanted to please you. My omega sensed that, I guess, and let me slip into that mindset where I wouldn't be embarrassed or worried, where I could just trust that you would take care of me. I'm not the kind of omega who readily submits to anyone, but I would love to do that again sometime."
Sam closed his green-hazel eyes and hung his head, hatred of that white wolf warring with worry for the omega he had come to care for so much. “Tasha, I need to know what to expect when he wakes up.”
Benny reached out and placed a hand on Gadreel's leg at the wistful homesickness he could hear in the young omega's voice. "My home, the place I was born, was far south and west of here. We lived on the water, in swampland that was never silent and never cold. I grew up on a boat, fishing and swimming every day of my life. But I gave all of that up to come here, to pledge fealty to the son of the great John Winchester. I can never go back; this is my home now. This is your home now, too."
John accepted the beer that Mary offered him, turning to listen as Sam and Charlie got into a heated argument about some actor in a show they both watched. "Adam is trying to figure out his feelings for Alfie. You know, the normal pre-rut stuff."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yeah, is that how it works? I've always been cold when my family was fine, so I kinda doubt I'm going to be a Cas-level heater."
"Well, Meg and I will leave you to get set up. It's going to be a hard winter, and you'll be grateful to have our best spy looking after you."
Dean reached down and turned Cas's face up, green eyes meeting blue. "You know that she was just using you, right? I know I joked about it before, but you didn't give consent for that. You didn't even know what consent was, and she took advantage of that."
Jordan chuckled and nuzzled his mother's chin, still young enough to take comfort from the contact. "It was pretty bad at first, but Gadreel helped me through it."
"We'll find a way to heal them, Cassie," Gabriel comforted, reaching out to place a warm hand between his brother's shoulder blades, smiling as the younger angel relaxed. "I'm sorry he did this to you, again. I don't know if you remember . . ."
The omega nodded and relaxed, letting himself enjoy that moment of contact before Dean pulled his hand away. Dean had already promised to look out for him; maybe he didn't need the Pack. He could apply to be an Auxiliary Member or wait until next year to try again, but Gabe really needed to get in now, before the harassment from the alphas wore him down. "Hey, how many Auxiliary Members are there?"
"It's a conservative estimate. I think you'll be back faster, and I'd hate to worry your friends. The supplies you need to take don't weigh much; I'll be sending out an expedition to restock the food in all of the watch posts as soon as spring hits, but I can't leave this one without medical supplies or magical herbs. The next wave of witches will be coming to town in a few days and I don't want to hear about my poorly stocked watch posts all spring."
Sam shuddered, subconsciously pulling Gabe tighter against his side, the omega offering no protest. "Dean, the last time we tried to keep food away from him, I ended up with a dislocated shoulder. I vote that we keep feeding him."
“Sure you can,” Gabriel replied. “Except for the two of us, all angels can be killed with an angel blade to the heart. I’m sure, as hunters, that all of you have some proficiency with daggers and such; the blades are no different.”
"He beat the leaders up last night," Anna whispered from his side, smiling at the alpha sitting so proud fifty feet above camp. "I guess he was angry, really angry, and he just lost it. He broke a couple of Bart's ribs and bloodied up Balthazar, Benny, Muriel, Ishim, Inias, and Isaac. Cool fight; you should have watched." Claire nodded from her aunt's side; apparently she had seen it, too. "It's about time he stood up for himself."
"We are meant to be friends, Balthy," Mshindi murmured, leaning forward and wrapping his arms around the white wolf's neck. "I'm not reading your mind, but I do know that this is a great gift you have given me, and it requires a great deal of trust. I am honored that you have accepted me like a brother as the shaman told me you would."
Cas smiled and turned on his side, staring at Dean's profile in the faint moonlight filling the room. "Despite my impaired state, I am aware of my own feelings. Yes, I meant it."
"Do you remember when I traveled to the southern continent and spent a year living with the Nomad Tribes? This was about two years before Kevin was born."
The two younger omegas packed away much more food than usual, their wolves demanding that they get ready for five days of mating. They complained the entire time, but Linda reminded them that it would be healthier for them to just obey their instincts even if they weren't going to mate this time. The food and their rising hormones exhausted them, so Balthazar led the two to bed and changed into his favorite sleeping shirt.
Except, he hadn't. Kevin slithered back over to the huge dragon statue, crawling up on his lower claws and dropping his head into his hands. "That's just great, now what? I'm doomed, all because an overgrown omega decided to take his drag show on the road! And why, in the name of all that is good and holy, would the Great Stone Dragon's spirit be missing?"
Castiel nodded at one of the servants fluttering around his throne near his father's dais, the emperor's personal servant Kevin. The boy's mother had traveled to Rome from far to the East, from the kingdom of Seres at the other end of the Silk Road, and had taken a position as the head female house servant while her only son, a toddler when she arrived, was now the most trusted of Chuck's personal servants. Castiel's own personal servants were still cleaning up and organizing the apartments he would be taking over in his father's wing of the palace, ones that belonged to Gabriel before he took up a permanent position with the Seventh Legion.
Cas nodded, thinking back to his own experiences. "Yes, it was something like that. It wasn't like flying, but I did feel like I wasn't really in control of my body anymore. Like getting really drunk, I suppose."
"Holy hell. Really? Damn." Crowley ran his fingers through his omega's iridescent white fur, smiling as the colors changed around his hand. "Those Winchesters grow their alphas huge, or so my mother tells me. Legacies tend to be much larger than their mundane companions. Your brother must be about my size in wolf form, then."
"Well, it didn't itch nearly as much in wolf form, but I really don't think you have the same thing I had. I don't know if changing forms is going to do you any good."
Crowley nodded. "Have my servants bring you anything you need. These large cushions are comfortable enough for young pups, but us mature wolves tend to need more specific bedding in our lives."
"I wasn't there, I was far too young, but that sounds like my unlamented aunt and uncle. You're far better off here, where at least they seem to have some respect for omegas."
Hidden in the trees and divested of their puppet, Kevin watched the commotion, turning to look at Cri-Kee by his side. "Pack your bags, Cri-Kee; we're moving out." The cricket trilled as he jumped up to high-five the dragon.
"My angel," Dean replied, ignoring the desperate "no" that Cas breathed. The seraph was nearly unconscious, struggling to stay awake to prevent the hunter from accepting the archangel. "I'll do it for him." Michael dropped Cas back onto the mattress, ignoring the angel's cry of pain as he landed partially on one wing. Dean resisted every urge in his body that was screaming at him to comfort the angel, to hold him and make sure his wing wasn't injured, but he had to make sure Michael would accept his conditions before reaching for Cas.
The two alphas moved as a unit, Benny just behind them as the sour scent of their fear reached him. Sam growled a challenge, forcing Dean to break away from his omega to answer the threat as Benny grabbed Cas and pulled him away. Dean roared, lunging forward towards Cas as Sam jumped on his back and forced him to the ground, Jo leaning in to help hold him still as Gadreel and Gabriel grabbed their brother's arms and helped Benny drag him to a safe distance.
Balthazar sighed gratefully into the silence of his mind as he finally spotted the huge Spellbound castle on the horizon. The trip had only taken five hours, but he had taken a half-hour break at the watch post to eat a quick meal and rest his wings. He had never flown for so long; he was glad that he had been able to do it, but he was beyond ready to return to the ground. He knew that the clearing where he had taken off was just within sight of the palace, spotting it a moment later among the dark smudge of the winter pines. Balthazar folded his iridescent white wings and dove for the ground, flaring them at the last minute to halt his speed.
Mshindi smiled, his dark brown eyes catching Crowley's bright crimson across the table. "The shamans are not concerned with politics, only fate. He will be your mate; it has been Seen."
"I can see why you wouldn't want to risk a confrontation with him. When do you think the streams to the south will be safe?"
“DEAN!” Cas jumped to his feet, running to the cage bars despite the fire still flaring through his grace, wrapping his fingers around two of the bars and pulling on them with all of his human strength. “Leave him ALONE!”
“Isn’t it obvious? I want to punish Castiel for what he cost me, what I am still determined to have. Dean, I want what I’ve always wanted. I want you to say ‘yes’.” Michael leaned down and grabbed Castiel’s hair, pulling his head off the floor. “And now I think I finally have the leverage to get that.”
The tall, ginger hunter began to read from his own scrap of paper, the phrase similar but slightly different. Gabriel hadn't told any of the hunters what the spell would do, and none of them spoke Enochian, but they had gathered that it was a kind of binding spell that would work on archangels. Three repetitions later, Asa reached out and placed his left hand on Bucky's right shoulder, adding another link to their chain.
"Yes," Rowena replied, cutting her apprentice off. "You see what I saw when I met that boy. And Fergus has grown quite fond of him. I've never seen anyone tear someone's throat out with their human teeth before, so he must have been furious. Don said that he took Linda off to the forest to track Balthazar down, returning a few hours later with your brother. He ordered the deaths of anyone who was involved in the situation and has Abaddon interviewing everyone in the palace with the assistance of my truthsayer. He wants to ensure that your brother is never in danger again."
Kevin shook his head, shocking white eyes flickering around the room. "I can still see all of these . . .
Lucifer offered an exaggerated sigh. "I'm sorry." Inside the vessel, Cas cringed, knowing that the tone was wrong, the timbre was off, but he wasn't surprised when Dean didn't recognize the
"A few members of Mother's coven came to town last night from a small fortress in the east. They apparently burned through the supplies in the last watch post they passed through, and I need to send someone to restock it."
"Thank you, Balthy," the Nomad purred, watching Crowley's pupils return to their normal size as he gained control of his instincts. "Can I assume that you are no longer concerned with the scent of the two omegas in heat?"
The confrontation between the two angels was over before it truly began. Sam stepped forward, forcing Gabe to drop his wings as he held one hand defensively out toward the seraph. "Cas, I choose him. Okay?
The hunters settled into a peaceful pattern, one reading fanfics while the other wrote them, sitting in companionable silence at the table or nesting in their separate rooms. Castiel, his own laptop in hand, a gift from Sam, often joined them at the table, glad to be reading something other than books on monsters. He would watch Dean surreptitiously out of one eye for hours, looking away if the hunter noticed, but Sam couldn't help but contemplate their lack of interaction. The angel was desperate for attention from his charge, but even these fanfics did not seem to be having the effect that he and Cas had been looking for. He wondered if there was anything else he could do to help Dean.
"Yeah, really nice. And protective. He and his brother and their pack are going to watch out for us at school, just like Gabe said."
"I promised to take care of you, Gabe," Sam whispered as the omega's purr calmed his alpha. With the pressure on his neck, Gabe couldn't answer, but he let his scent radiate trust, and that was all the answer Sam needed.
"Dean says you're dating," Cas argued, reaching for his bag of chips and carefully opening it. Gabriel was famous for ripping bags open like a savage, but his younger brother preferred to act like he had some level of class. "He said that Crowley letting himself be seen with you today, especially at lunch which he never attends, is him accepting your suit. He wants you to date him, and he has never wanted anyone before."
"Can we go swimming?" Kevin turned hopeful eyes up toward Crowley, reaching over his shoulder to scratch his back. "I think I got bit by something or rubbed against some poisonous plant a couple of days ago; my back is itching something crazy. I think a swim might help."
It’s quiet again. The silence isn’t awkward, per se, but it isn’t entirely comfortable. There are too many things hanging between them. Too many words left unsaid.
Thank you for reading so far, and I hope you come back for the next chapter! Comments and kudos are greatly appreciated :3
got here, all I’ve done is drive. And I can’t stop. The only reason we’re out now is because I caught——caught
And once it does, Dean can’t stop crying. He had thought that Cas was getting better. He had thought they were finally out of the woods. That Cas knew he was safe and loved and that this was
And Jack know this because even if he isn’t in control of what he is doing, Jack sees everything that Chuck does, which means that he knows everything that Chuck
The smell of blood makes him feel sick because of that, but it doesn’t stop him from pulling the jacket out and wearing it again and again, until the red-brown handprint begins to flake away. Dean stops wearing it, then. He can’t bring himself to be responsible for losing another piece of Cas, even if it is just flakes of old blood.
As you've probably guessed, those are my three birds, including the names, name meanings, and general attitude (the real Tempest is a lot pricklier). Skittle is 13, Tempest is 4, and Dax is almost 3.
Cas felt himself blush at the compliment, glancing over his shoulder at the enraptured hunter. "Thank you, Dean. No one had ever said that about my wings before."
He couldn't change form, but his wolf was more than happy to take control of the situation and do the one thing omegas desired during conflict: run. Without a backward glance, Balthazar fled into the trees, holding his bruised ribs and wiping the blood out of his one good eye. He heard the alpha howl behind him, but he was already deep in the trees and searching for a place to hide until the alpha gave up the chase. Balthazar, falling deeper and deeper into the safety of his own mind, begged his wolf to take him back to his brothers.
Mshindi joined the two younger omegas, taking their hands and leading them closer to Crowley and Balthazar, pausing less than three feet away. "Well?"
One of the alphas behind him grabbed his shoulders, shoving him forward and holding him still as Alastair leaned forward and grabbed his chin. "Now, now, be a good little bitch. No growling at your betters." Cas whined and tried to sink lower, every omega instinct demanding that he either run or submit to this alpha, but he refused to give in. In his old school, one of his alpha brothers or their friends would have run over to break this up, but here no one knew him. Who would bother to challenge a half-dozen alphas to save a strange, unpresented omega?
Dean grinned and patted Gabe's back, letting the omega return to sitting comfortably in his chair as he pulled their worksheets across the desk. He noticed that the blond was sitting a lot closer than before, but he knew better than to comment on the improvement. He did, however, make a mental note to send a message to the other group leaders in his pack, asking them to find ways to initiate interactions with Gabriel when they thought he might need comforting. Cas and Gabe weren't the first touch-starved omegas Dean's pack had decided to heal, but they might be the most skittish.
Kevin, who had grabbed Cri-Kee and dashed for the safety of the pole in the center of the camp as soon as the fighting started, slunk back to Dean's side, resting his claws gently on the side of the omega's leg. "Well, if that's you being yourself, it's certainly the most alpha I've seen from you in the past two weeks."
Now the black male’s aggression made a lot more sense. If he and his brothers were at the tail end of a heat coming out of the mountains, that could easily have been the impetus for Lilith and her betas to attack. Unmarked, unmated omegas in heat would have proven an irresistible lure for the Spellbound female. And the Celestial black would have had no way to know if Dean and his pack had come for the same reason.
“What? What’s wrong?” Gabriel tried to lean forward to see his leg, but Cas appeared beside him and pushed him back down, growling an order.
Gabriel winked and Sam grinned, glancing around for the first time. He noticed the gathered generals' rank markings, seeing that the man talking to him had the same ones, but bigger. "Are you Prince Gabriel?"
Benny grunted something unkind as he trudged after his friend. He didn't own his own horse, though his Imperial friends had promised him one as a wedding present if the Matchmaker could find him a nice omega. As a close friend of two of the princes, he had been allowed to visit the private Imperial Matchmaker, a bubbly blonde woman named Donna, and she had taken down his preference for male omegas, reminding him that he would qualify for better matches if he had a military record. Her words, plus the promise of a minor noble title when the war was over, had definitely been the deciding factors in his enlistment.
“Benny hates riding?” Cas’s eyes widened as he looked down at his brother, tears in his eyes. “And yet he still volunteered? I don’t know what to say.”
"And he controlled himself," Kevin added, his white eyes narrowing slightly. "He controlled himself like one of the alphas of your pack."
Dean looked up as he was suddenly joined by Benny, Balthazar, Charlie, and Anna, Khan eyeing them warily but not slowing his stride. Kevin and Cri-Kee had elected to spend the march in the covered cart, protected from prying eyes by piles of cannons and the small roll of Dean's clothes and private supplies. He remembered what the four had said at the lake, about wanting to start again and be friends, so he relaxed his shoulders and offered what he hoped was a welcoming scent and an open smile. "Hi, guys."
Her soft, sultry words had the desired effect as the alpha's scent spiked, his heady cinnamon and apple musk threaded with the slightest touch of arousal. Dean raised one finger in a scolding gesture, jade eyes narrowed at the slight omega. "That's not fair."
"Should be interesting to watch," Sam replied, tapping Gabriel's shoulder and nodding toward the dessert table. Grinning, the omega jumped to his feet and headed over, the alpha just a few steps behind. He needed to get his energy up in case they called for another game.
, apparently he didn't listen to us." Sam clicked a few things on his computer, switching to his Amazon account and turning the screen so Dean could see it. There was a screen full of those
Cas's eyes lit up at the reference; that was one of his favorite Disney movies. "Like in the scene where the fairies keep changing his dress color from blue to pink?"
"It's not far," Balthazar answered, leaning forward slightly in his seat. "Head east on 19th and it'll be on the left after Harper."
"What can I say? Being around you has severely confused my concept of right and wrong. It's exhilarating, helping you break the status quo, and it would be nice to see if my alphas can be trained to behave around omegas in heat. So, if this is the first step in that process, sign me up."
his place to fight when the Emperor calls him. It's my place to stay home and behave long enough to find a mate who will pup me and provide the next generation of warriors to defend China. That's just how the world works."
Sam grinned as he flagged the waitress down to order another round of beers and some loaded nachos, watching as Dean reached the front of the line and started looking through the songs available.  He frowned at the first few pages, his green eyes softening as he apparently found one that he liked.  He looked up at Cas, smiling softly before turning back to the machine and clicking on one of the songs, that satisfied look never fading.
Dean grunted as he broke the first bar free, switching to the second one and wiggling that one out, also. As soon as he created a large enough gap, the hunter squeezed through into Cas’s cell, crouching down on the mattress beside his angel and casting his eyes across his injured wings.
Everyone looked over at the redheaded witch in shock, Balthazar unable to contain a soft whine. She wanted him to go into the heart of Spellbound lands? Alone? Without his brothers? "I . . . Rowena, I can't."
pleasure," Cas growled, stroking a little faster as he used his free hand to make Dean meet his gaze. "I definitely care about yours." Dean's eyes widened as the gold, which had faded to flecks, returned full-force. He bit his lips and glanced down, clearly wanting to ask something but not sure if he was allowed. "What is it?"
“No, I want to stay.”  Cas watched the stage intently as he finished another beer, blue eyes wide with anticipation.  Dean glanced up at the people milling around near the stage, shaking his head as he finished his own beer and glanced up for the waitress, trying to decide if they should go for more beer or another round of shots.  “I think it would be fun to do.”
Mshindi chuckled and rubbed his face on his leg. Now that they had a little more usable light, the northern omegas could see that the Nomad was more finely built, with long, slender legs that would give him an advantage in a grassland or desert environment, and he was much smaller than the other three omegas.
"This is really far past my line," the alpha whispered, wrapping one hand around the back of Balthazar's neck and pulling him closer.
Cas glanced down at his feet, the angel's equivalent of a blush. "I will endeavor to control my reactions during sex in the future."
"Yeah, sweetheart, but you are displaying all of the classic signs of drunkenness. Did anyone give you something suspicious to drink, especially anything that tasted weird?"
Sam glanced between his brother and the angel, something mischievous glinting in the depths of his green-hazel eyes. He cleared his throat and stood from the chair, carefully holding Dax in one hand as he reached for the largest cage with the other. "I'm going to take this guy into my room and get him set up so we can start bonding. Have you thought about what we should do when we go on hunts? They can't go with us."
The older Winchester hung his head and nodded, reaching back to twine his fingers with Cas's. "Yeah, sorry, I got carried away."
my fault. Sam and I are going for a walk; we won't be coming back here today. When you guys are done with flight practice, we'll meet you in the city. Okay?"
Dean glared back, his own eyes swirling with gold as anger threaded his scent. Cas's alpha couldn't understand that Dean's gold could mean fury as easily as lust, so some part of him wanted nothing more than to grab this omega and run away somewhere private where he could do something about this
The omega's blue eyes darkened to an almost navy shade, the raven-haired man pulling himself to his full height as he puffed out his chest and raised one eyebrow in an unspoken challenge. Dean, standing chest-deep in the lake, froze at the expression, some deep, primal part of him urging him to either challenge the Celestial or back down, and even his alpha was willing to submit to this beautiful omega. "Will you,
"So you'll die for honor," Dean snapped, his eyes darkening as he struggled to keep his despair from leaking into his scent.
Balthazar groaned and opened his eyes, glancing out the window at the dim pre-dawn light, nuzzling closer to his alpha and digging his fingers into the blanket. "I liked it better when I got to sleep in," he groused.
Kevin and Alfie, who had heard the words second-hand from Balthazar, found that they were not as uncomfortable as they thought they would be at the concept. After all, they had been raised in the wild and had their first heats in the forest. What Mshindi was suggesting, however, sounded much more complicated.
Dean pulled back, his purr stuttering to a halt as he looked over Cas's body, clearly trying to see the injury through his tunic. Chuckling, the alpha leaned forward and pulled his light tunic off, tossing it toward the end of the bed and leaving himself bare to Dean's exploration. The injury was obvious, a pair of red scars on his lower left side, stab wounds from a barbarian sword. Dean leaned forward and kissed the lower scar, his head only inches from Cas's groin. "You're okay now, though?"
"He hasn't eaten since we came in here," Gadreel answered, joining his brother and friend by the window. "Nothing tempts him."
Balthazar squeezed Crowley's shoulder in warning as the omega opened his mouth to comment on the interaction, slowly shaking his head and nodding toward the movie. Crowley, mind flying back to their lunch conversation, nodded and returning his attention to Hiccup and Toothless.
Cas's recovery had not been easy. He had suffered a few side effects from such a serious concussion, including severe irritability the week before Thanksgiving. Chuck had sent all of his omega pups to their aunt's house in South Dakota for the holiday, and the teen had come back quite a bit calmer. He wouldn't return to school full-time until after the new year, but his pack made sure that he didn't fall behind in his studies. "Sometimes we go see Aunt Amara, but she's going to spend the holidays with her new boyfriend in Las Vegas. She was going to meet his family over Thanksgiving but she stayed home to help me, which I am grateful for." Cas still was not ready to talk about his visit with his aunt, but Dean didn't care as long as his boyfriend was feeling better. "She mailed us cards and gifts already, which we are not allowed to open until Christmas Day."
"We've never let you down before," Akobel commented, stripping out of his heavy, formal court clothes and folding them tightly so they would fit into Lily's pack. His slender mate had opted for a simple dress, no shoes or jacket, and she added that to the pack quickly before lacing it up. She changed first, letting Akobel strap the supplies around her waist before he joined her in wolf form. The blonde alpha and red omega yipped a quick farewell to Anna before taking off, the Southerners hoping to get to the edge of their mountains before the sun set.
“Why don’t we have a little bet, then?”  Sam caught the waitress’s eye, smiling as she returned to the table.  “We’ll all do Irish Car Bombs, and the winner gets to decide if Dean goes on stage to sing or not.”
?" He growled the other alpha's name, baring his teeth in a threat display that Alastair refused to match.
Cas followed the hunters through the supermarket on a rare “family” shopping trip. He enjoyed these peaceful excursions with the brothers, picking up various foods as they passed them and reading through the list of ingredients that he barely understood. The more ingredients the package had, the more Dean seemed to want it, but Sam tried to gear his brother toward more organic or fresh foods instead. Predictably, this frustrated the shorter hunter and he guided the trio toward the candy aisle.
If Dean had a tail, it would be wagging. The omega backed off of Cas's lap, running his hands down the alpha's chest, just barely letting his nails scrape the tanned flesh. Cas groaned, letting his head fall back against the bed as Dean kissed the faint red welts left by his nails, worshiping both nipples before moving lower. Cas raised his knees and watched Dean with crimson eyes as he intentionally skirted the erection bobbing in front of him, dark knot just starting to swell at the base. Dean kissed all the way down Cas's legs, running his fingers over the scars that covered his shins. "What are these from?"
Dean furrowed his brow. He was familiar with silphium, of course; it was an incredibly common herb used in cooking throughout the southern part of the Empire, less commonly in the north and Britannia. He had known in a vague sense that it came from Cyrenaica, but not that it was being affected by a drought in Maghreb. "Why can't it grow here?"
Castiel touched one finger to the bird’s head and watched in wonder as she fluffed her feathers up even more, leaning into the finger as the angel began to caress her. Castiel’s smallest wing feathers were soft, but nothing in comparison to the tiny creature sitting on his finger. She leaned her head down and began to nibble on the edge of his sleeve, making a gruff
And with that, Dean was off, loping down the slope with his white-tipped tail held high. Benny didn’t hesitate, following him a moment later, Sam and Jo locking eyes before they joined the other two. Neither of them were willing to challenge the mahogany male for leadership of their band, so they had to obey him. No matter how stupid his ideas were sometimes.
Silence fell across the table, all eyes turning to the young, unpresented pup who had made the announcement. Samandriel glared back defiantly, his eyes narrowed. "No one was going to say anything! You talk and talk but never
"No," the omega barked out, shaking his head emphatically. There was a hint of fear in his blue eyes that Sam couldn't quite understand, but he knew better than to continue along that line of questioning. "He just doesn't understand us. We're omegas and he's an alpha. He isn't around much, either, which doesn't make it easier. Balthy tries, but he isn't as dominant as he would have people believe, and he's certainly no match for an angry alpha. I don't want . . . I don't want to be left behind when Balthy and Gabe inevitably leave."
But there was a larger possibility that he would not be fine. Sam heard the unspoken words, and he swallowed, slowly nodding. “Okay.” He gestured for Tasha to continue.
"Is that what you want?" The blonde omega shook his head. "Then, no, you don't have to stop coming to see me. We just need to make sure we don't go any further than this."
Claire shrugged. "I have a lot of aunts and uncles who are only half-siblings to my dad, and most of them have a decent place in the Court. Granddad couldn't really legalize them, not with the way Grandma views concubines, but my dad is going to grant me some titles when he finds a mate someday. Still, I want to earn a place of my own if that takes a long time."
"Let me introduce my newest companion, then I will explain. I'm guessing you didn't bring any supplies or clothes with you?"
“I missed you,” he rasps after a moment of silence. “I really, really… it’s good to have you back, Cas.”
Sam groans from the floor, and sits up straight. His spine cracks like a firework, and he winces. “Dakota?”
Still, for all his looking, Dean is still coming up blank. But maybe that’s more because his vision keeps going fuzzy than for a lack of the entrails being there. He blinks, and everything goes a weird, glitchy grey-red.
, and he shouldn’t need to breathe.) He turns his head to look at Sam, who is also gasping for breath.
“Bed.” There’s a short pause before Dean speaks again, and when he does, he sounds slightly unsure of himself. Like he doesn’t know if he’s allowed to say what he’s saying. “I don’t want to be alone now, and I don’t think you do either.”
“Cas,” Dean says, raspy and weak. It’s barely more than a breath with the barest hint of voice in it, and it hurts after not talking for so long, but Dean can’t stop the his first word in months from slipping from his lips.
If he’s being honest, Dean doesn’t think that he could eat right now if he tried. He’s too tied up in knots to think correctly most of the time, much less
Taking that into account, Chuck gives the newly edited Dean a test run anyway, and finds him to be (as expected)... less than satisfactory.
He’s not going to kill the Winchesters immediately, but he’ll be damned if he’s not going to make them suffer.
Sam has his back to Dean, and is brandishing an angel blade against Chuck, who has a downright feral expression on his face. At first, Dean thinks that it’s his imagination, but after he blinks away the dizziness he confirms that——yes——the hole in the suit has unstitched, and begun to bleed again. Chuck glances at his injury in confusion and thinly veiled horror before refocusing on Sam.
Chuck stumbles back, clutches his shoulder, and hisses in pain. The angel blade disappears with a snap of Chuck’s fingers, and the bloody hole heals itself immediately. Even the suit mends perfectly.
A crack runs through the wall across from Dean, and the bunker shakes on its foundation as Dean’s anger thrashes again. He couldn’t rein it in if he tried.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers. “Dean, I——I swear, if there had been any other way, I wouldn’t have told you.”
Dean. There’s a brightness in his eyes that the empty will never be able to replicate, no matter his hard it tries. It’s his soul——his pure, beautiful soul——shining through. Even with his grace so wrung that it’s practically useless, Cas can see it.
“If you consider me dying of tetanus and Sam going to live in the suburbs with some random chick bad, yes,” Dean answers. He’s having a hard time keeping his expression straight while saying this, because the idea that /that/ could be a happy ending——as Chuck had probably intended to present it——is laughable at best.
Dean freezes. “I don’t remember. That’s what I friggin’ mean.” He crosses his arms. “The last things I remember are drinking until passed out, and a helluva lot of pain. Then the next thing I knew, I had metal bar though my chest and my lungs were filled with blood.” He shrugs, eyes dark. “I guess Chuck put me under for a while. No clue for how long, though.”
Dean doesn’t know. Maybe he’s in shock. Maybe he’s still bleeding out in that barn, speared through with rebar and this is just his mind trying to convince him he’s still alive. Maybe he’s——
Dean slams on the breaks, and that doesn’t change a thing. He turns to look at Sam, who has snapped out of his shitty-life induced crisis just in time to join Dean in wondering exactly what the fuck is going on when the radio (which Dean can’t remember turning on) fizzles into static, and the car screeches to a halt.
Dean can’t bring himself to affirm Sam’s question. Still, he bends down, and pulls the knife from Jack’s neck. It looks wrong, just sitting there. Dean wipes the blood off of it, and sticks it in his pocket, almost robotically.
Cas lets himself be led to Dean’s bedroom, but hesitates once he’s inside the room itself. The only light is a faint glow from down the hall, and that’s not nearly enough to see what Cas needs to. His night vision is newly lacking, and now is not the time for that, because the second that Dean’s hand slips out of Cas’——the second Dean all but disappears into the shadows of his room——Cas’ heart drops. All of a sudden it’s too dark, too suffocating, and entirely too much for Cas to handle at the moment. He feels his breath quicken, and his pulse nearly double. His legs threaten to buckle in on themselves, and he stumbles back into the wall.
“Twice.” Dean laughs ruefully. “Hopefully it takes.” He taps his hands on the table absentmindedly, lost in his thoughts for the moment. Cas doesn’t seem to mind; he is as equally distracted.
He’s... he’s trying, damnit. He’s trying so hard to find anything they haven’t already tried to death (in some cases, literally), but killing god isn’t a subject with much reliable information to call upon. That’s probably intentional on Chuck’s part, now that Dean thinks about it. He smacks his head against the table he’s sitting at, and doesn’t bother raising it again. Anything that they have against Chuck is probably fake, anyway.
It would be so much easier not to fall for Dean all over again, even while knowing he’s nothing but a fake created by some petty cosmic entity.
He hadn’t been breathing when Cas had left their room. Dean had been limp and still, but before that he had struggled. He had
It takes a few moments for Dean to adjust, but once he does he finds himself at the mouth——or maybe the end——of a hallway.
After Charlie, Dean hadn’t told anyone until right before he took his shot with Cas. There had been tears, but Sam had been just as supportive as Charlie, and said that he was ‘proud of Dean’ or some stupid chick-flick shit. Dean had been a bit too busy wiping away scared tears to really pay much attention to anything aside from the fact that Sam actually accepted him. Then, with that under his belt, Dean had gone and kissed the shit out of Cas.
Dean is tired. He’s tired, cold and angry (so angry, all the fuckin’ time, and there’s no way to stop it), but at least he’s trying.
Somehow, he forces himself into a sitting position, and tries to stand. It doesn’t work. His legs are numb, and his head is far too cloudy to force them to cooperate.
Dean’s vision fuzzes out, and his thoughts black out like burning film. Sam’s tear-stained face is lost to darkness, and no matter how hard Dean tries, he can’t seem to get his sight back. Something tears inside of him, and more blood gushes into his already struggling lungs.
He’s so tired, and by the time they reach the door, it’s a wonder he’s still upright. Cas looks tired, too, but steady enough. Worry crosses his face as they reach the door back home, but he pushes it down quickly.
He had quickly learned that babies pull hair, and wasn’t quite ready to part with his, so hairbands it was, but Dean will never stop giving him shit about it.
It’s easy to pull Cas close, so that’s what Dean does. He hugs Cas as tightly as he can without hurting Cas, and cups one of his hands around the base of Cas’ head. Cas just melts into the touch, and Dean selfishly thinks that he can’t imagine something better than this. Maybe it’s just because Dean has barely let himself been touched since things went to shit down in the dungeon all those months ago, but his skin burns where Cas touches him. It burns in a way that makes Dean never want to let go.
both of them, and with no angel to assist them, they should stay that way. They should just sit quietly in Heaven, and do what Chuck tells them because that’s what is supposed to make them
Okay sorry peeps this was supposed to come out earlier but I went traveling and mistook the integrity of my internet and how much time I had to do shit.
Dean steps carefully to the edge of the fast-running stream, and starts walking along it. Eventually, they should come across a lull in the rapid current, and that’s the place that the ophiotaurus should be. Emphasis on
Maybe Dean can reason with the empty——the Shadow. They’re both dark creatures now, both nearly on the same level in terms of power, so there’s no reason that Dean shouldn’t at least be able to try to reason with it.
It’s the easy coolness of the air, the heat of the coffee, and Dean’s presence next to him. The way that they can just sit together, knowing what they mean to each other, and knowing that they’re both safe and alive, and the fact that Cas actually
Dean holds his part of the organ over the flames, and drops it. He winces slightly at the smell and bubbly squelch from the burnt flesh. It crumbles to ash surprisingly quickly, almost melting into feathery red flecks of nothingness. Sam tosses his portion in a moment later.
That’s what’s important. For the first time in a while——Dean has no idea how long, exactly——Dean is feeling the way he should. Sad, yes; angry, yes; empty, yes. But he’s free to feel the way he wants to.
tired of losing things he cares about. Unironically and unintentionally, Dean's thoughts drift back to Cas. He hopes that if Cas is asleep, and that the empty isn’t torturing him too badly. He knows he shouldn’t imagine Cas as simply sleeping, because there is no way that the empty would just let him
Sam runs a hand through his hair. “Okay. Maybe you’re right. But we can still use this. The scrying spell showed a weird looking tree, right? That should be easy to pick out.”
Sam looks over at Dean, sporting the most hopeless expression that Dean has ever seen on his brother. He looks so lost——so tired——that it almost hurts Dean.
“You wouldn’t be,” Dean replies in a low, tired voice. “If I die, the world ends. We need to——to be in balance or something. You’d just be putting me somewhere I can’t hurt anyone.” He tries for a smile. “Cage me, like Chuck did. You can do it on your own.” He sighs and traces patternless shapes the countertops. “It’s gonna be easy. I won’t fight. I might even be able to help.”
There’s a deep, lonely ache in his chest that refuses to go away. A hole where Cas used to be, before he was taken by something just as horrible as what Dean has become. Dean’s skin hurts from the power constantly washing through him, but it doesn’t matter much. Dean has been ignoring pain for years, and this is no different. Besides, it’s not like he doesn’t deserve it, especially after he’s failed so much.
is the only thing that Cas hears clearly before the connection abruptly cuts off, and a shadow-shrouded figure appears in front of him. Without a doubt, it’s the empty. Cas goes to take a step back, but finds himself glued to the spot.
Dean shimmies out from under the ophiotaurus, stumbles to his feet, and steps back until he’s next to Sam. The angel blade is still in Dean’s tightly clenched fist, covered in dark blood, but Dean barely notices it. He’s busy staring at the quarter-visible monster, impaled into the ground in front of them.
Sam finishes carefully taping up the small, but extremely deep stab in Jack’s shoulder with precision, and steps back to inspect his work. Jack is kicking his feet softly against the bed, and watching Sam with eyes just a bit darker than they had been the last time Sam had seen them. Jack knows more now; he’s been hurt, trapped by Chuck just like the rest of them, and that’s no small thing to overcome, but there’s still somehow a childish gleam hidden in there.
the whole thing is ridiculous, but Dean can’t stop the tears. At least he manages to stay quiet enough so that Mary doesn’t hear him.
Dean watches Sam walk into the main part of the bunker, and checks the garage’s locks for the third time before he follows his brother into the empty shell of the place he calls home.
The words are garbled to Dean’s ears, but he still understands them well enough, and traces the voice back to its owner.
Apparently, Dean has built a tiny pyre for this specific occasion. It’s about the size of a ukulele, and sits on the road in front of the bunker. He presents it dramatically, drops the book onto the pyre, and looks down at it with a self-satisfied expression. There’s a container of lighter fluid next to it, and Dean picks it up, then tosses it to Cas.
He appears to be having a difficult time of it. There are tears now, large and salty, coating his cheeks and dripping onto his arms, which are folded on top of his drawn-up knees. Jack is too tired to notice, and Sam pretends not to in order to help preserve Dean’s dwindling pride.
Cas takes another sip of ashy water and stares at the wall. With ‘Dean’ dead, the Shadow will get bored quickly——it always does after Cas starts killing people——and the illusion will reset, with a few differences. It always does.
He tugs up the sleeves of his jacket, and cuts his palm. The symbol he needs to paint is small and simple, but the entire operation would be useless without it. He draws it on his forearm, and throws the excess blood into the fire as Sam finishes the second third of the spell. Immediately, Dean can feel the energy rush from his body to feed the flames, and a dark swirl appears between the licking, white-hot fire.
and an oozy blackish slash appears in reality. Jack sways again, and slides into a sitting position, limbs limp. His forehead creases in pain.
Dean flips the knife around in his hand so that he has better leverage, takes a final step forward, and stabs the blade upwards, right into the base of Chuck’s skull.
Cas flips the cap off, and completely drenches the book. He doesn’t usually condone the destruction of literature, but he’ll make an exception. He’s not even sure that this book counts as literature.
Nothing feels different by the time it’s finished. Dean doesn’t feel like he could punch a hole through a mountain, or cause an earthquake with a snap of his fingers, but he doesn’t know exactly what he expected. From the look on Sam’s face, he doesn’t feel much different either, but neither of them comment on that. At this point, all they can do is hope for the best.
per se, but he’s definitely disoriented, and still bleeding from the gash at the base of his skull, in addition to various other cuts. Gold light starts sparking from the cuts, and the slashed-up skin starts to knit back together. He stares down at his fingers and watches at the small cuts across his hands and palms spark yellow, and disappear.
He can’t die like this. He needs to get Cas back, he needs to tell Cas everything that he was too scared to before. He needs to——
Dean is once again covered in sigils, and this time, he’s armed to the teeth. If the sigils still work, he (and Sam, who is also slathered with various squiggles and Enochian characters) should be hidden from Chuck.
more thing almost sends him over the edge for the umpteenth time this week. (day, month. Whatever the fuck.)
Well, there’s Sam. That’s motivation enough to keep Dean moving, at least. If nothing else, Dean will carry on for his family. It’s been the only thing that’s kept him going in times before, and Dean knows he’ll have to rely on them again. Well,
Another edit results in Dean forgetting how to breathe, and well... that’s tricky to fix without killing Dean for good.
“Human. Yes.” Cas takes a small step towards the door, and the blue glow strengthens. “I’m happy with that, so long as you’ll have me, in... in whatever way you want.”
Sometimes Cas still has moments. Times where he can’t remember what’s real or fake, and what’s real or not. Sometimes things that the Shadow did will blend with what’s happening in the real world, but never badly enough for Cas to hurt anyone.
Dean shifts slightly, puffing out a quiet breath as he does, and squeezes Cas’ hand gently. On instinct, Cas squeezes back. Dean’s eyes fly open, and he scrambles off of Cas.
They’re a miserable scene, really, and every one of them knows it. It doesn’t take long for Sam to finish rinsing the dishes and setting them to dry. After that, he sits a couple feet away from Dean and watches Jack sleep, feeling drained.
They come consistently. In the three weeks that Cas has been stuck in this illusion, he’s had a nightmare almost every time he’s slept. They’re not much different from the mockery of reality that Cas is stuck in now, save for the fact that Sam and Dean are always cruel. Cas wishes they would be more like that in the Shadow’s main reality. It would make it so much easier to hate Sam and Dean that way.
One year after the events of the last chapter. Just a little check-in on the boys to see how they're doing.
Cas wakes up to muffled words. He can’t make them out exactly, but the voice sounds like Dean’s, and helps ground Cas, if only a little.
Then they come to a fork in the road. Something tells Dean to take a right, so he banks hard to the left before the car can correct him, and that’s when everything goes haywire.
looking for a way to bring you back from the empty if I didn’t…” Dean takes a deep breath, and catches Cas’ eyes. “If I didn’t love you?”
of Dean——cares so much it hurts, and Cas wants nothing more than for him to leave. He would miss Dean, yes, but at least then he wouldn't need to deal with some flat, plastic version of everything he ever wanted.
Chuck pulls a angel blade of his own out of thin air (probably literally), and takes a swaggery step forward. He looks every inch like a man who knows when he’s won. Sam, on the other hand, looks like he’s about to lose his mind. He’s somewhere between crying and furious, and the hand that holds his angel blade is shaking hard.
By the time Sam and Dean are done talking, Cas’ eyes have started to droop closed again, and Sam politely excuses himself. In contrast, Dean stays and holds Cas’ hand until Cas falls asleep.
“I think... I can’t bring him back on my own, but I can try to open a door to the empty.” Jack sits up slightly taller, as if steeling himself for what that would take. “Someone would need to go in and pull him out, though. Does that work?”
Dean walks over to the dresser next to his bed, pulls one of the drawers open, and pulls out a couple articles of clothing. He holds them out to Cas, who looks at them with a confused expression.
He wipes his mouth on the sleeve of his jacket, and it comes away wet and dark with blood. Whatever did this to him
He wants to apologize. Mary looks so disappointed, and Dean can’t help but be disgusted with himself for putting that expression on his face.
Dean had thought that the empty was just an expanse of nothingness, but apparently walls are to be found if one looks far enough.
think you can beat me? Even after what I did to you and your brother the last time you tried?” Chuck’s eyes slide over to Dean, who is struggling to stand. It’s easy to see that he’s still gasping for breath, and he’s almost certainly broken something, but Sam can’t worry about his brother now.
They never do more than sleep in the bed. Cas keeps expecting——and somewhat dreading——anything more, but Dean doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to do more than what they’ve been doing. He doesn’t want more, and he won’t take it. Not like some of the other Deans have done.
Jack tries to squint at Dean, but it looks like he hasn’t quite gotten his body under control yet, because all he manages is a jerky blink. “Not really, no.”
Dean still doesn’t think that it’s possible to kill god (at least not without horrible casualties), but he’s angry enough to create a way all on his own. And——when he looks down at the methods him, Sam, and Cas had compiled all those months ago——he might just need to do that.
Chapter title is also the title of a song by Daze 'N Daze which fucking slaps and you should totally go give it a listen.
He’s been eyeing the ‘65 fastback mustang across the street for the past ten minutes for that specific reason. Honestly, Dean is just glad there’s a decent car in the immediate area, because——even freshly returned from the dead, and with an angry god on his back——Dean Winchester is
Dean is fully intent on avoiding any and all consequences, especially if it means he stays in control of his body. He thinks he knows what body-snatched him——what controlled him and fucked him up almost beyond the point of return——but he doesn’t go so far as to consciously think it.
Then he might be able to think of a way to get out of this. A way to wake up. A way to get back to Dean. The real Dean.
too long to thaw out, and Jack definitely needs to eat sooner rather than later. Even though he had been able to heal himself earlier, it’s obvious that he’s just barely above human.
“Yeah, I’m——ughh.” Dean forces his aching, weak-feeling body into a sitting position, and leans against the driver’s side door. He swallows roughly, grimacing at the all too familiar taste of blood in his cottony mouth. It feels like something has reached into his chest and rearranged all of his organs. Everything hurts, and his head is no exception. “What happened?” He asks again.
It’s exhausting to deal with, and even more boring to watch. Chuck does enjoy suffering, but this... it's so out of character for Dean, and just
He’s not talking much either, and seems kind of out of it, but he’s… he’s still Cas. Still here. Alive.
Dean’s head snaps up to look at Cas, his eyes wild and red-rimmed. “Cas?” He croaks. His voice is raspy, and he winces as he talks, something that is undoubtedly Cas’ fault.
He’s been in Heaven for——well, who knows how long——and in all that time, it’s always been sunny and clear. Right now, it’s dark as pitch, and when Dean manages to force his eyes to open, the night sky is covered in smoke-black clouds. He takes a shaky breath, and tastes copper in the back of his throat.
“Sam? Dean?” He looks around frantically, and Dean’s stomach turns at the sight of the open gash in the back of Jack’s head. Golden light shines from it, and Dean can see the flesh trying to knit itself back together.
More background before we snap back to the present day. Chuck sure likes hurting the boys, doesn't he?
Then Dean can deal with his power. It’ll all be easier with Cas back. He knows how to deal with these kinds of things. He’ll be able to help Dean, and then everything will be okay.
Dean keeps his foot on the break, and his hands off the wheel, but that doesn’t stop the car from rolling forward just as if Dean was driving it.
He tries to speak, and even though it’s a pitiful attempt that would most likely yield nothing of substance, Chuck fuses Dean’s jaw shut until he can’t even
