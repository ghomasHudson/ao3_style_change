of these men who touched you.”  He licked his lips.  “You are far from broken, Dean.  Wounded?  Yes.  Broken?  No.”  He smirked.  “If you were broken, you would not fight me so much.”
Goddammit, of course he had to mess this entire thing up by having no willpower.  He wasn’t supposed to get off, was he?  This was bad, wasn’t it?  Like a horny kid with a porn mag.  Fuck, he couldn’t even do massages right.
his car.  Hands clenched on the steering wheel, he seethed in the driver’s seat, wondering if driving into oncoming traffic could be listed as a murder weapon.
Frowning, Castiel took the envelope.  It was old and well-worn; folded multiple times.  He opened it, pulling out a bank statement and a real estate listing.  He squinted.  The bank statement was a healthy one and the lot indicated on the paper, just under that price.  He folded them back up and returned it to Dean.  “I’m afraid I don’t follow.”
First: flat tire on his bike, forcing him to race for a bus.  All the while hearing his dad’s critique about not living on campus his senior year and thus ending up late to his first class of the spring semester.  And given his professor’s vile look, he was in for it the rest of the year.
The “silence of the tomb” had never been a more apt description than when Castiel followed Dean and Benny through the tunnels, nearing Crowley’s main building.  Crowley was either paranoid or crafty; Castiel couldn’t be certain.  What he knew of the man, he knew Crowley had his fingers in more than one field of crime.  Mostly gun running.  Tunnels like these would be perfect for such events.
with Dean Winchester was like.  Dean didn’t even wait for the light to switch to green before slamming on the gas and fishtailing through the intersection.
Curious, Castiel zipped to the end table near Dean’s chair and chittered in delight.  A thimble, filled with brown liquid that
Feeling confident for the first time in years, Castiel smiled and nodded.  “I understand, Dean.  But please, just trust me.”
Castiel’s touch gentled, becoming feather-soft.  “We will go no further than this tonight, that’s true.  I merely want you familiar with my hands, my pet.  After all, I had never intended to deny you what you most need all this time.  And for that, I am truly sorry.”
Dean swallowed and shrugged.  “Uh . . .” his mind blanked and he said the first thing that came to mind.  “Cuffs?”  Immediately, he wished he hadn’t said it.  But, it wasn’t like they would be for him.  Sam.  To embarrass the fuck out of Sam.
Not trusting his words, he nodded.  Balthazar beckoned with a finger, walking toward the alcove of Dean’s shop.  When the bookseller followed, his cousin held up a hand and shook his head once.  Dean looked annoyed but complied, waiting by the door.
Dean bowed his head, staring at his feet.  “Yup.  Years of this shit, I can damn near smell it.”  After a moment, he husked, “Told you, Cas; I’m a fucking great liar.”  A shaky breath and Dean pleaded, “You should go, Cas.  Please.”
Castiel left his high-paying job for the low-glamour career of food cart vendor.  Turns out that might have been his brightest decision yet.
Until he suffered a nervous breakdown and dumped the entire contents of a coffee urn on his work computer because one simple file had imploded on itself.  A few hundred dollars in damages later and Castiel figured it time to move on.  A less dramatic response would have been better but really, beggars can’t be choosers.
Hunched over and shuddering, Dean stood farther away, next to the other end unit renter.  The guy looked like he’d been wide awake the entire time.  Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, sipping a mug of tea that looked
to reach Balthazar – not a usual name so the phone book would likely work – or he could go to Gabriel.  He winced.  He should probably start with the publisher.  Much as it pained him.
It scared him how much he liked it.  How he could get lost in such touch.  It was almost better than being pinned and fucked.  Of having his control taken away.  Which had to be wrong.  How could he like
.  Almost every day, the stranger would tromp through his hardware store buying lumber, tools, and any other home improvement item on his shelves.  He didn’t say much.  Usually paid in cash.  Tall, broad-shouldered with light brown hair and stunning green eyes.  Middle-aged, maybe, but carrying an air about him far older than that.  He typically dressed in jeans and flannel with or without an old, brown, leather jacket.  Scruffy jaw as though he couldn’t be bothered to shave more than every two or three days.  He either showed up in an old, dented pickup or in a sleek, classic car.
like this man before.  Sex was always fun and sweaty but this had been something else entirely.  There had been nothing but affection in every one of Dean’s deliberate touches.  Kindness and heat and that made his heart burn.  He’d been denied it for so long he still had trouble processing what they’d just done together.  All he really knew was that he didn’t want it to end.
Castiel would think him if he knew what Dean was doing.  Getting hard just like that?  Like some creep stalker on a phone.  Was he that hard up for something?  Jesus, no wonder Michael and Azazel tossed him so quickly.
“Look.  There was one thing you were supposed to do.  Keep the vessel and then I got your soul.”  He snorted, leaning back with his arms crossed.  “This has never happened,” he muttered.  “I can’t even …” he scratched his head.  “I can’t even feel the damn thing now.”
Castiel soon forgot the gossip as he tidied up his house and did a few loads of laundry.  By the time he felt it comfortable for company, it was nearly six and he hurriedly prepped the lasagna and oven.  He had just finished the final layer of the meal when he heard the rumble of a heavy engine outside.  He slid the pan into the oven, setting the time and trotted to the door, opening it seconds before Dean could knock.
Maybe if he’d stayed at his office down the road, he’d feel up to Dean’s caliber.  No way a man as well-to-do as Dean would want anything to do with someone who ended his day smelling of coffee and bacon.  Who lived in a tiny one-bedroom apartment with a cat who always slept on his face.  Who spent most of his money on books rather than anything of use.
Wasting little time, Dean looped an arm around Castiel’s back, pulling him in closer.  A tiny gasp of air and Castiel followed, his fingers digging into Dean’s hip.  Damn.  Like the guy was
He turned back, finding Castiel coming out from the back room, a box in his hands.  He looked from Dean to the clerk and back.  He set the box down and wiped his hands.  “Anna.  I’ll be busy for the next hour or so.  Please, only interrupt if it’s an emergency.”
Sprawled on his soaking wet lawn, he squinted, startled to see the red face of his Jogger Crush.  The man panted, hovering over Dean.  Immediately, he began apologizing, pulling Dean to his feet and wincing at the mud and grass now clinging to his pants.
Dom.  The kindness in his voice latched onto Dean like a drug.  He craved it at this point.  But once Dean was fixed, he’d lose all that.  He doubted Castiel even thought of him beyond their dates, skewed as they were.
He pulled back, wiping his mouth.  “What the fuck, Cas?”  His voice shook, slurred with alcohol and trembling with barely-held emotion.  He could see the man’s fingers reach for him again, even when Dean himself backed away.
“Good.”  Balthazar finished off his coffee and set his mug down.  He stood and dropped the magazine on the table.  “Well, I’m off, darling.  Do enjoy your little field trip.”
too familiar.  His college’s star pitcher, Dean Winchester.  And Castiel’s crush since freshman year.
At the moment, I have three chapters completed.  This is a record for me.  Don't expect it to continue.  :D
Dean sighed, the sound heavy and thick.  “It . . . you really should just let it go, Cas,” he hedged.  He looked over, green eyes pleading for understanding.
had just happened.  He wiped his mouth, remembering all too clearly how perfectly those lips had felt.  How he’d wanted that.
uneasy.  I can hear your breathing patterns changing.”  He didn’t touch Dean but did lean forward, focusing on Dean as he did.  “What’s wrong?”
Dean spoke of the new repair shop and the few customers he’d seen so far.  Some people had been a bit nervous of him but it seemed that most of the residents were warming up to him.  A few, like Howard, had even expressed interest in a classic restoration like the Impala.
to kiss him.  He might have missed Castiel’s mouth a bit and ended up drooling on the guy’s jaw.  Great.  Dear
“I’m not sure if Bartlett lives in the area or what but yeah.  I’m meeting him and Gabe for dinner in a bit, actually.”
Fuck, he really was broken.  Even that fleeting touch had left his skin crying out for more.  He swallowed hard, clenching his hands.  Right now would be the right time.  Right?  Castiel claimed he liked Dean’s forward behavior so now would be the perfect moment to confront him about all this.  But like all times before, Dean caved and looked away.  “Dammit, Cas,” he muttered.
He was a passable cook and enjoyed making meals for his family.  So, taking his life savings, he invested in a food truck and started serving coffee, pastries, and sandwiches.
“Huh.”  Castiel blinked rapidly.  So.  If Dean was telling the truth, he was a demon who’d intended to devour Castiel’s soul but instead was left drifting in reality.  “Huh,” he repeated, sitting back and staring out the window.
Dean opened his mouth as though to say something but groaned when Castiel squeezed his hot flesh.  Eyes rolling, he breathed out a harsh, “
He stumbled back, panting.  His face stung where Alastair had scratched him.  Looking down, his eyes unfocused, he could see a blade in his side.  That was probably bad.  He tugged on it and whimpered.  Yup, definitely bad.  And his head pulsed with agony.  Vision going black, he wobbled his way to Dean, finding the man’s green eyes fevered with pain but open.
Dean chuckled.  “This again, huh?”  He leaned back in his chair, sighing.  “Look, I get urban legends and all that shit.  And yeah, sometimes there’s truth to it but this one?  It’s all nonsense.  There’s nothin’ out in those woods that can even
Still waving the paper, Balthazar shrugged.  “I’m not so sure, darling.”  He leaned back, out of Castiel’s reach when he swatted for it.  “Tsk.  Not so handsy, lad.”  He smirked again.  “I’d save that for Dean, if possible.”
Castiel shifted, managing to loosen Dean’s arms as he did.  He knelt in front of the man, finding bloodshot green and damp lashes.  He trilled low and warm.  “Oh, beloved,” he breathed.  He kissed Dean gently, pulling back hastily when Dean fumbled for him.  “Shh,” he murmured.  He stroked Dean’s cheek, humming and cooing.  “Tell me, Dean.  Tell me what you fear.”
Silent still, they padded to the wall closest and sidled along its length, pausing every step or so, breath held tight in their throats.  At the door, Castiel leaned against it, pressing his ear to its surface.  He could hear something; whether voices or not remained to be seen.  He reached up with his free hand, testing the door knob.  It turned easily and he pushed the door open, remaining in a crouch, pistol out.
Guilt replaced Castiel’s earlier anger and Castiel wilted.  “Again, I’m sorry.  What I did was wrong, I know that.  But Dean, my father is not a kind man to queer people.”  He swallowed and looked away.  “I’ve been unable to reveal who I am to him.  He doesn’t even know about this shop.”
to transform but without a full moon, he was stuck as a human.  The lack of transformation only seemed to enrage him further.
man?  God, the world really was a cruel, awful place, wasn’t it?  After he caught Dean’s concerned look and lifted brow, he took the man’s hand quickly, shaking it hard.  “Er.  Sorry.  I . . . um . . . sorry.”
“Yes, exactly,” Dean breathed. He ran his hand over Cas’ back, tracing random patterns with his  fingers. He shifted slightly and winced. “Cas,” he gasped lightly. “I… I need you to... um, get out.”
“I’m sure it’ll fit,” Dean assured him and took the bag to his bedroom. The pyjamas he found in there were the opposite colours of Castiel’s, in green with red trims and the same tiny penguins. He’d never admit that to Sammy, but he was already starting to like his Christmas “alone”.
Castiel rocked above him, kissing him passionately, his cock grinding against Dean’s until he reached between them to rub it along Dean’s cleft; Dean arched up in need for more.
"Are you sure?" Cas held his breath, eyes flicking up to meet Dean's for a moment, watching the small, but sure, nod of Dean's head. "Okay." Cas' stomach fluttered wildly and he reached for the hem of Dean's shirt, slowly pushing his hands up against Dean's stomach and chest, eyes never leaving Dean's own.
Castiel, the quirky guy who  moved into the apartment next door almost five months ago had dug his way into Dean's life – and, if Dean was honest, his heart as well.
Dean watched him and couldn’t resist the urge to smile. Even though it was routine for them now it still fascinated him how at ease Castiel was here.
Dean leaned in to plant a kiss on his neighbour’s cheek, however Castiel had other ideas and turned his head to bring their lips together. t wasn’t a peck like when he thanked Dean for his present, but a full, deep kiss Dean didn’t expect. Dean’s eyes flew wide open, but he couldn’t bring himself to pull back. Ever since Dean walked in on Castiel naked he had caught himself fantasizing about his neighbour several times, and his full lips had always mesmerized Dean.
His own cock was achingly hard, but he didn’t have to wait long. Castiel turned around to him and kissed him hard, pressing him down onto the mattress. Their bodies slotted together, rubbing against one another, hands roaming, lips ghosting, teeth gently nibbling.
"Me too. It was so weird having to get all used to a new school and at first I did feel uncomfortable about ... about being bi.  I didn't have that feeling back at the old school. But then there along came you and it all felt right again." Dean recalled with a light sigh. He kissed Cas's cheek. "Thanks for having crossed my way."
Hands came up slowly to roam the naked skin of his chest. Castiel’s hands were firm,his touch sure but gentle. Dean ran his own hands up Castiel’s thigh, over his pyjama pants. “Take these off?” Dean asked, his voice a husky whisper.
He moved on impulse then.  He rose up clumsily and kissed Castiel hard, feeling the man jerk in surprise.  It didn’t last long, though.  Castiel’s hands rested warm and sure against his neck as he returned the kiss.
for a man who used to be a fathomless creature capable of rending time and space.  Who'd pulled Dean's ass out of the fire so often it ought to have scorch marks.  But Castiel had given that up, tired of the wars and battles and the insincerity of Heaven.  He’d torn out what remained of his draining grace and returned to the bunker with the Winchesters.
Martin laughed as he swept the dust into a pile. “It was. Worked in a library before that. I was an archival assistant, not The main one. That was Jon, my fiance”
Jack placed a hand on her shoulder, forgetting it was hurt. She lowered her shoulder from the touch and let out a hiss. “Sorry. I wish I could tell you that.” he held his hand out. “Blade, Ashley, please.”
The dogs began to sniff Ashley, and then growl at the werewolf. The weerwolf managed to turn enough to grab onto her legs and pull her down, digging their claws in. Ashley flailed and managed to get up, not before grabbing some books on the shelf and dropping them on the werewolf’s head.
A few minutes later, Ashley texted her response, and was on her way, but that her dad wanted to meet them first. Jack looked over to where his parents and Sam were. “Guys,” he called. “I have a friend, she's coming over now. Is that okay?”
Beaut was trotting alongside her, Miracle on the other side of Jack. “Where’s your parents and your uncle?” Jack shook his head. They headed out to the end of the hallway, unsure of what to do. Ashley clutched the hunting blade in her pocket- she and Jack would fight together.
Jack patted Beaut’s head, and she rolled onto her back, paws up. They laughed, content with how it was. By the time it hit 1am, they packed up and went to bed. Jack assured her she would get a proper cot for the week, and offered his own, but she denied and slept on the floor, her dog curled up on her feet.
Ashley went silent. She took a minute, “I have OCD. The praying is my compulsion and my twitching is a reaction to intrusive thoughts in my head. Rowena nodded, and the silent crocheting returned.
Martin looked to the side, and realized the Lonely had once again arrived. He cursed the fact he still had such little control over it. “I’m human. I just got caught up in some,” he paused, “stuff. I’m really an archival assistant at the Magnus Institute, I swear.” He put all his energy into disappearing the Lonely, which had some effect. The rest sunk to his feet.
They asked her a bit about herself, and she went on a small tangent regarding some of her favorite series.
Jon looked back with shock. “Um, sure,” he said, standing after them, grabbing his cane and following them. He stopped by his room, to both say goodbye to Martin, and Cow, and to get some clothes together. He was going hunting.
It was months later. Martin had proposed not a month ago- Jon accepted readily. They had forgotten about the test. It showed up in the mail one day, when Martin collected it as he had done for years.
Sam smiled at Jack. “I’m glad we found you guys- we were worried. And we’re glad that we got to you before the werewolves and vampires did.” Jack looked down, and up again, before shutting his eyes for a second.
Miracle and the dog, who was introduced as Beaut, began to play and roughhouse with each other. Jack grabbed Ashley’s hand and took her throughout the halls and into his room. “Ta da!” he called as they opened the door.
Sam started to lean forward again, “so, as we were earlier saying. What exactly is the Lonely?” Martin flinched at the mention, reminded of the fog.
Jack, who finally took care of the vampire, rushed to her side. She was breathing heavily, and looking terrified. “This is just an elaborate nightmare again, right Jack? JUst fell asleep watching a movie, and I’ll wake up tomorrow with no memory of this?” she started to shiver, and turned her gaze onto the werewolf, who was starting to stir.
But this kid, he has some serious power. He failed a few times at first, but as soon as the fog seeped into the floor, Dean felt it. He shivered at the mist, a cold feeling stemming from his feet and traveling up to his heart.
“It's fine kid, just ask me for help next time and we can do it together.” he offered with a smile. Jack gave him a grin back and nodded, before running off to get ready.
There was a shut of doors, and suddenly a flurry of people excited. “Who’s digging a grave?”  Dean’s voice asked.
“Rowena,” she sweetly said, “And how did you get in here?” she maneuvered herself away from Martin, inching closer to the kitchen block.
Martin looked at Jon, Cow crawling out of his arms and over to Jon. They gave each other a set of looks, weighing the options. Jon Knew Martin’s answer, and his own. Jon nodded. “Okay.”
Ashley thought for a moment. “Normal I guess. For me at least. I’ve had it for about five ish years but I just got help a few months ago.” she sat against the wall, positioning a pillow between her head and the wall. “It’s hard. All day it's compulsions, intrusive thoughts, effecting me in some way. No peace.”
Breathing. She had to breathe specifically. She had to breathe in two deep, two small, in out with nose only. But then, seconds later it wasn’t right, now she had to- she had to stop breathing.
She smiled. “You got it bucko.” She put headphones in (why- its class?) pulled her beanie over her ears and walked away. Ashley, her name was, started singing the song earlier. She seemed so.. Different from before? She had been panicky and awkward and was now bouncy and taking charge.
The girl in green rolled her eyes. “We can’t do anything till everyone else pitches to us. Anybody ready?” she looks around. No one answered. “We're gonna wait here.” Someone eventually stood up and made their way to the back, and then there was some chatter.
The kid sat down at the middle table with a few others and began talking. Sam stood up. “Uh, hey guys! I’m your new teacher.”
She blearily nodded, handing him the blade. She raised her hand to her mouth and began to bite the skin around her fingernails. “I didn’t hurt her did I? I- I don’t know what just happened. There’s always scenarios in my head, but,” she looked at Jack before blinking and flopping onto the floor, and picking up her dog into her lap.
Martin’s heart panged. His family was so small, he had lost so many. To get a brother? After losing Tim and Sasha? He smiled. “Thank you.”
“All that knowledge,” he said, “lost. That’s horrible. The Institute was such a grand place, from what these books said.” Martin choked for a second at that.
“I swear. That’s her defend mode. Hilarious.” Ashley reached forward, wincing and strained as she patted the dog’s side.
They all were silent for a second. “That-” Sam said, “oddly makes sense. Good work.” Ashley beamed at that, and thanked him.
The put their bags on the bed, and walked out into the hallway, where the others were waiting. They were led to a library. Jon felt an excitement bubble inside him, the Beholding thrilled at all this knowledge. His stomach growled, not for food, but for statements. Martin’s hand pressed against his arm, grounding him to the present. He had been fending off the urge to feed on Martin’s family, they had a large statement, he could smell it floating off them.
Ashley looked sad. “Did I kill the werewolf?” she looked unsure of the question. Rowena shook her head. She didn’t know if the girl had done so, but she looked about to crack, and she was unsure if she wanted to handle that.
Rowena smiled. “Finally, you’re up. C’mon, bandage changing time,” she said. Ashly nodded and sat up gently. She looked down and noticed the gash on her stomach, and the stinging pain when she sat her head against the wall.
He gave a shrug. “I don’t know. But she was awesome.” he continued to scrub at the floor, moving the rag to each side. He sighed. “She handled herself well, I’m serious. She-” he started full out laughing. Dean gave him a look before he continued talking. “She jumped on the werewolf’s back and she put her foot on its back.” His face turned serious, and he ignored Dean’s raised eyebrows.
“This is where Lukas brought me to lure in Jon once.” ANother figure appeared, this time a red-haired woman looking confused.
Dean interjected. “No, I don’t think that’s necessary. Even if Dad doesn’t want to talk to you, I am.”
“Here, as in the bunker?” Sam added. Oh, he didn’t think of that. She may find it odd to have a bunker as his, well, living area. But knowingAshley, that wasn’t the most important thing at the minute.  Dogs were!
“Fathers! And Sam!” Jack called out, seeing Cas, Dean, and Sam walk out of the library/kitchen area to where the group was. Ashley’s dad was glancing around a bit, before nodding to the adults.
He had pushed him too far, didn’t he? He was gonna lose him. Dean’s thoughts spiraled, until a tall figure slammed into him, before scrambling back. Dean called out again, a desperate hope barely remaining.
Rowena quietly picked the dog up, holding it out and placing it on the unoccupied area of the cot. The dog adjusted itself so it was touching the girl’s leg- barley, but still touching her leg nonetheless.
He gave the kid a smile. “No, bud,” he said, looking up at him and putting a hand on his shoulder before nodding. “You did great. Look at that, you got it under control!” Martin grinned, looking like the young cryptid he was, and pulled Dean into a hug.
He stood, and the assumed mother began talking to the girl, who was still in the same place. The school nurse was the other lady, she introduced herself and gave some encouraging words to Ashley. The girl began to shake out her foot, being coaxed out of her trapped mindset. Eventually they settled on a rolly chair, the only way it would work. Dean immediately offered his desk chair for the cause. Ashley put her feet onto the desk, and plopped back into the rolly chair, holding her mothers hand and being pulled into the hall.
“Let go of him.” a voice growled, . The three turned- but Martin didn’t need to do so- it was Jon. While they were turned, Martin rashly threw his head back and into the man holding his arms, utilizing the Lonely to hide himself, his instincts kicking in. He had picked up a few things from Lukas. He grabbed Jon’s arm, careful of his cane, sprinting to the car. He sighed in relief at the sign of Cow sitting in the back seat.
There was Dean, who was cleaning up the mess. He had already salted and burned the- JAck stopped. He pulled a rag from the steel rack, and walked over to Dean. Dean tried to protest his help, but Jack just plopped onto the hardwood floor and started to help out. He picked up the books, and the whole room smelled of mint. He chuckled at that.
Two figures turned into the hall. It was revealed to be Sam and Dean. Jack sighed and rushed forward, latching onto them both. Miracle jumped up into the air. Beaut, now noticing the lack of danger, rushed back to Ashley, sitting on her feet and sniffing her wounds. “What happened, Dean?” he asked, terrified of what went down.
Castiel ran his hand over Dean’s body and kissed him gently. “Relax, babe. Let me take care of you,” he half whispered between kisses and knelt over Dean. “Spread your legs,” he told him softly.
Dean swallowed hard and looked at Cas with wide eyes. Despite his lips feeling swollen from kissing, his mouth suddenly felt terribly dry. Slowly he moved his head and nodded. "Okay, " he whispered.
Castiel. Dean wondered if he’d be home for Christmas or if he would go celebrate with friends or family; they didn’t discuss their  Christmas or holiday plans with each other. Surely Castiel would think him pathetic if he asked him to spend Christmas with him, just because he didn't want to be alone.
"No, it's... It's the first time, I'm sure it's normal," Dean half whispered, aching for Cas to move.
He didn’t see Castiel reach up, but he sure as hell felt his nipples being twisted. He arched hard and his rings of muscle squeezed around Castiel’s length when Dean spilled his load over his hand onto Castiel’s belly. Castiel thrusted  a few more times before coming into the condom.
Castiel felt himself blush slightly and he looked down at his sneakers. He crossed his legs and gave Dean a small, sideways glance. “I already knew that,” he whispered.
Reaching between them, Cas wrapped his fingers around Dean's length, stroking it back to full hardness. "I love you," Cas whispered, pulling his hips back before sliding into Dean's body again.
"Okay," Cas whispered back, exhaling slowly as he pushed forward some more. The drag was slow, and hot, and tight, and by the time Cas had their bodies flush together, Dean's legs were shaking around his waist. Dean was torn between holding his breath and breathing shakingly.
"Dean? Are you okay?" Cas asked softly. Dean nodded quickly, biting down hard on his lower lip. There was no way he wanted to stop this, no way he didn’t want to have sex with his boyfriend, the slight burn be damned.
Cas rolled his hips slowly, gasping and falling forward against Dean as his boyfriend's body tightened around him. "Fuck, Dean... I'm not gonna last long..." Dean slowly rocked his hips with Cas' movements, groaning as the pain started to turn into something else...
Dean dared Cas with his eyes alone to get out of his jeans as well. He wanted to undress him with his eyes, take him in completely, but he also wanted to feel him, feel him close, feel Cas' skin on his own.
"God, Dean. You're so perfect." Cas climbed back up onto the bed, the heat from Dean's body hitting him as soon as he got close, and he shivered as he settled over his boyfriend and found Dean's lips once more.
“Ride me, Winchester,” Castiel groaned deeply and, with Dean warned and helping, flipped them. Dean shifted until he found the position he wanted and started riding.
Cas smiled and found Dean's lips, kissing him once, twice before Dean's mouth fell open in a soft sigh and Cas pushed forward, slipping his tongue between Dean's lips. He used the distraction of the kiss to start moving his finger, twisting and pushing, slowly stretching the muscle until it was easy to slip a second finger in along with the first. Dean kissed back gently and rocked into Cas' administration.
“Cas! Oh damn, Cas, yes. So good. Harder.” Dean braced himself when Castiel responded to his plea and pounded into him. Firm hands planted on either side of his ribs and and very heated eyes met his gaze.
They kissed again, less hurried this time, just memorizing the feeling of each other's lips. Dean traced Cas’ full lips with the tip of his tongue before gently pecking the corners of Cas’ mouth and carefully pulling on his bottom lip with his teeth.
Dean was just about to text back to Sammy when his door opened and the person occupying his thoughts walked in wearing only socks, his dark hair tousled like he’d just taken off his sweater.
They ate dinner with Christmas music playing in the background. Dean was surprised how good his meat pie tasted and it looked like Castiel was also pleasantly surprised. They ate in companionable silence, only disturbed by Castiel complementing Dean on the food a few times.
“Just because it’s my first time spending it with someone other than my family doesn’t mean I don’t know how to celebrate,” Dean replied poking his tongue at Castiel..
Castiel covered his upper body in gentle, loving kisses and began moving inside him. Dean rocked gently to meet his movements. As t turned out, Castiel wasn’t at all quiet during sex. Dean heard his name numerous times combined with “yes” and “fuck”, and in many different ways, his voice hitching in different states of desperation and arousal.
Dean moved so he could whisper in Castiel’s ear, “Bottom.” He opened the drawer, reached into it, and handed Castiel a bottle of lube.
Castiel took his time opening up Dean nice and slow, pausing once to add another drop of lube to his fingers before slipping three inside. He shifted his weight, pulling back to watch Dean's face as he crooked his fingers and brushed against the tight bundle of nerves. Dean clenched his teeth hard before he gasped in need of air.
“Do you want to do presents now or tomorrow morning?” Castiel asked after settling on Love Actually to start with.
Until now, that is. Dean realized he'd be alone for Christmas. Alone. He’d never been on his own for Christmas and had no idea how one spent Christmas without company.
They fell asleep like this, enjoying each other’s body heat and their shared post-sex bliss. When they woke up later, sticky and cold, they got up and took a shower together.
He could feel Castiel holding his breath, so he leaned forward and kissed along his shoulder, nuzzled his neck. His fingers ghosted along the length of Castiel’s cock. “Damn, you feel good, buddy,” he breathed hotly into Castiel’s ear. His thumb swiped over the head and Castiel hissed softly. Dean had to strain to hear the sound of his name.
Dean bucked into Cas' hand, over and over, going faster. "So close..." He moaned as Cas’ free hand tightened on his hips, fingers digging into his flesh. Cas’ hips stuttered, balls drawing up tight as he spilled his release deep inside of Dean. He found the side of Dean’s throat, teeth digging in on a moan as he felt Dean's body tighten around him.
Dean’s legs fell open on instinct, slotting their bodies further together. Cas rolled his hips down against Dean’s, swallowing Dean’s small gasp of surprise as his hands slipped from Dean’s chest to his hips, fingers digging into his hip bones as he held Dean down against the mattress.
Dean spread his legs and set his feet flat on the bed as Castiel set to prepare him with his fingers, using plenty of lube. It didn’t take long for Dean to get ready for the other man’s cock. His skin was flushed and hot and he was aching for Castiel, for his cock, for his own release.
When he came back in his new pyjamas and slippers, Castiel had set the table and even decorated it with snowman candle holders and some holly. It was so absolutely different from any other dinner they had had together. Their usual dinners together were always ordered in and eaten on the couch while watching TV. This was something completely different but Dean was already loving all of it. .
Cas gasped softly, letting the shock of hearing the words returned wash over him and sending heat through every part of his body. With returned fervor, Cas shoved Dean’s shirt the rest of the way up and helped his boyfriend into a sitting position to pull the shirt off from over his head before doing the same with his own.
They both handed each other one more present. Castiel got a bottle of his favourite red wine and  Dean received a bottle of his favourite Whiskey. Both were opened right away and they sipped at their drinks as Castiel started the movie.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice was barely above a moan, his hand resting very close to the V of his friend's crotch. He could already feel that the other man was just as affected by their make-out session as he was.
The harder and faster Dean stroked, the more Castiel writhed and bucked. When he came he was panting too hard to scream and Dean wondered if he would always be this silent during sex.
“Let’s do them now,” Dean suggested and grabbed a box from under his tree before moving over to the couch. He handed it to Castiel and sat down next to him.
Castiel shook his head. “No, I’m not. Rather, thoughts of round two?” he shrugged, hoping Dean wouldn’t feel rushed or under pressure. He was lucky, Dean just grinned widely and nodded. “Top or Bottom?” Castiel added with a relieved smirk.
Cas nodded, appreciating the comforting touch and reached for the bottle. They'd never done this before, but Cas would be lying to himself if he denied the countless nights he thought about it or the times he tried it on himself. He clicked open the cap and with a shaking hand, squeezed out a good sized dollop of the cool gel onto his fingers. "Just... Tell me if it's wrong okay?"
Dean gulped heavily and nodded. "Yes, I will. I'll tell you." He ran his hand over Cas' arms and smiled at him.
Dean closed his eyes and moaned softly, running his fingers back through Castiel’s hair and pulling him closer. “I love you, too, Cas.”
Dean nodded. "I will," he whispered. He's tried it before, alone, pretty soon after discovering he was into boys as well as girls. But they had never tried it together and he had no idea what it would feel like with someone else’s fingers, someone he loved, no idea what to expect. He didn't even know if he would be able to say if something was wrong or just awkward because it would be Cas, not himself doing it.
Dean swallowed hard, gathered his courage, and leaned  closer to his friend. He heard his name faintly and lifted his index to Cas’ lips before kissing him softly. Dean  felt the other man relax against him and shortly after felt a hand on his hip; he smiled and deepened the kiss.
“This is not what I expected, Mr order-in-dinner-and-eat-on-couch-cause-the-table-is-too-cluttered,” Castiel teased.
“Welcome to the traditional Castiel Novak Christmas.” He grinned and handed Dean a gift bag. “Merry Christmas.”
Castiel’s smile softened as he laid his hand on Dean’s back. “I would still like to spend Christmas with you,” he assured him.
“Not what I meant,” he mumbled and buried his face in his hands, embarrassed that Castiel was obviously making fun of him, but also feeling like it didn’t sound like the worst of ideas.
Dean’s eyes widened, swallowing audibly and the air between them was thick, hot. Despite his lips feeling swollen from kissing, his mouth suddenly felt dry. Slowly, he nodded, his pulse bounding through his veins. “Okay,” he whispered.
"Me too." Cas ran his hands up Dean's legs, arranging them on either side of his hips as he moved forward, leaning over Dean's body. The room was silent, just their mixed breathing, nervous and anticipating the next step. Slowly, Dean shifted his hips up, sending a shock through Cas as the head of his cock pressed against the curve of Dean's ass.
"Yeah... Yeah, go on," he smiled softly, hands roaming over Cas’ back and arms, focusing on the feel of him instead of the burn.
The other man turned to actually stare at him. Why was Castiel smirking? That slight twitch of his lips was definitely a smirk, wasn't it? “You wanna spend Christmas Day in bed with me?” Castiel asked with an amused glint in his eyes and wiggled his eyebrows.
“I think it looks perfect,” Cas replied honestly and reached out to take one of the sandwiches. He unwrapped the plastic and handed the sandwich over to Dean before grabbing one for himself. “Thank you, Dean. Really. You didn’t have to go through all of this trouble. It’s really sweet.”
Cas gave Dean a small smile and finally managed to roll the condom over his length, hissing under his breath at the contact. "Okay..." he said after a moment, looking back up at Dean. "Um, do you want to do it this way? Or... I mean..."
Dean’s knees clasped around Castiel’s hips, urging Castiel to enter him, to give him what he desired.
Dean clung onto his boyfriend's arms, deepening the heated kiss. There was no going back now, he needed this to happen. His whole body, every single nerve was on edge, ready to explode. Slowly, Castiel pushed against Dean's shoulders, turning them over and pressing Dean down into the mattress. He kissed him once before sliding off of the bed and crossing over to his bedroom door and clicking the lock. He didn't think his dad would bother them, at least not without knocking, but it didn't hurt to make sure. When he turned back around, Dean's eyes were on him and he was slowly slipping out of his jeans.
Dean looked at Cas seeing that he was at least as nervous as he was. He gently cupped his cheek and smiled. "Let's do it." He half whispered. "It'll be okay."
Cas let his hands trail down Dean's sides, sliding to his knees to give him enough room to get a hand between them. He stroked Dean's arousal, his own body responding to the sharp intake of breath Dean gave. Cas eyed the bottle of lube and suddenly felt nervous. He swallowed hard, meeting Dean's eyes and hoped he didn't look as scared as he felt.
Cas shuddered in anticipation, his skin hot and stomach twisting as Dean lowered his hips, pressing them against one another again. "Dean," Cas whispered, crushing their lips together as his hands trailed down Dean's back and slid underneath the band of his jeans.
He started slowly then worked his way back close to the speed Castiel had set. He rode him hard, bracing himself on Castiel’s chest with one hand and stroking his cock with the other. He felt his next orgasm build up fast once he shifted a little and hit his prostate with every thrust. His head lolling back he panted and moaned.
“Oh. So you're home? How would you feel about doing that together? Maybe even a homemade meal to start the evening with for once?” Dean asked feeling a little guilty about worming his way into Castiel’s private Christmas. But then again, why shouldn’t he? They gave up privacy when they handed each other  spare keys.
Jon shrugged. “It’s nice, but its always been a temporary thing. I dunno where we’ll go next,” he admitted to them.
They stayed like that for a moment, before the door opened. “Hello?” a voice- Martin recognized as Adam- called, “Martin?”
The werewolf clutched its shoulders, screaming and collapsing to the ground. Ashley stomped her foot down onto the werewolf’s back, to ensure they wouldn’t get up to attack again. “Jack!” she called out wearily, the dark library now seeming eerily silent.
Martin sighed. “Another Avatar. When Jonah made Jon Head Archivist, he was initiated into the Beholding without knowing. He needs to read statements to feed it. He’s not hurting anyone, he’s just reading.”
She jumped up, arms flailing dangerously as she did so. “Okay.” She let out a suppressed chuckle. “So, I just listen to the same song over and over again quite a bit, and after a while, you just hear all the complexities of the song and how unique and amazing it is.” She closed her eyes, jumped a few more times and flopped onto the floor with a finality. “So,” she smiled, “would you like to listen with me?”
Martin’s eyes furrowed, confused. But then it hit him. Elias’ words ‘you look just like him’. Martin’s eyesight rammed out of focus. He slowly backed up, going to his room. Jon sat on the bed, with Cow, reading a book. Martin shivered and plopped onto the bed with fog around his feet.
“This isn’t my room.” she stated. Her head turned in Rowena’s direction. She  looked confused. “Who’re you?”
Jon blinked. They wanted his help? To find hunts. Would it even work? He contemplated how the Eye could find hunts, and he turned his head to the side.
Jon finished his statement and returned to the table, to see Martin listening intently to the Winchester’s tale of hunting monsters. He walked to the empty chair next to Martin, planting a kiss on his head and sitting next to him.
She ignored his protests. “I know how to fight. Trust me, I’m better off in a pair than alone.” He sighed and contemplated for a moment before nodding.
“I’m not a Lukas, I promise, I’m just,” he sighed, “I’m a servant of the Avatar. Lukas was my boss. He was an annoying old man who made me teach him how e-mail works. I’m just anAvatar now. The Archives is all an Avatar, but we escaped I promise!”
Jon hopped into the passenger seat, and Martin hopped in the drivers. For once, he hoped his bad driving would benefit. However, the other group was already in their own car. Martin sped out of the parking lot, racing through the main street, back where they started.
Cas smiled. “Jack’s friend from school. She was here for a sleepover and the werewolf tracked us back here.” Rowena nodded, shaking away the pang of sadness that clipped her. She focused on her work.
Martin liked his family. He wished he had known them for a longer time- that he could’ve gone with them. The ones he didn’t know well were Mary, Cas, Jack, and John.
Martin smiled for a moment, tucking his head into the pillow, looking over at Jon, who raised a hand to wi[pe the tear marks off of Martin's face. “I think that sounds wonderful Jon, honestly.”
“Listen, Jody, I’m mentally ill. Showering + me, between the ocd and depression just hasn’t happened. Trust me,” she said quietly, “I’ve tried.”
“Kid,” he gently asked, “what happened?” Jack looked over to Ashley, but Dean called his attention again.
Ashley said goodbye, and the others followed, before Jody left. “So,” she said, “what can we do around here?”
Jon looked over his book. “Love, you okay?” Martin shook his head and let out a muffled response. Jon set his book down, opening his arms. Martin lifted his head and inched closer to Jon, letting himself get wrapped into a hug. “What happened?”
They listened to all sorts of songs, comedic, songs in other languages, older songs, emotional songs, and so many. They set up a system of listening to the music. Jack put 5 songs in, Ashley put five songs in, and they just tried to analyze the different noises. A few hours passed apparently, because Sam knocked on the door and opened it cautiously. He found the two teens laying next to each other on the floor, both with headphones in. Jack aws gently swaying his head and Ashley was moving her feet up and down. Sam smiled at the scene softly, whipping his phone out to snap a quick picture and forward it to Dean and Cas on the groupchat. A few seconds later the other adults arrived, laughing gently at the two.
He blearily opened his eyes, before finally registering the alarm, and waking up. After realizing, he got up quickly, and threw a jacket on. “Right,” he said. “Your right, intruder alarm. Sorry,” he apologized, “You stay here, I’ll go out.” She shook her head.
She gave a dazed nod. “Okay. Shelley. No, I mean Ley- no” she stammered, stuck on the word. She took an inhale. “Ashley. What happened-” she started before slowly tensing.
Soon, the imaginary feeling surrounded him, enveloping and crawling through the air. He heard Dean chuckle. “Okay, that’s good. Why don’t you try and move the fog? Open your eyes.”
Miracle and Beaut stood in front of the two,teeth bared and growling. This time, they’d all be ready.
Ashley looked up at the kid. “Not your fault you goof. I made me go with you.  But you're explaining the werewolf thing. I’m open to the idea but what. The. heck. Why were we attacked on the sleepover!??!”
It was Jack’s first day of high school. How could he, a junior, not be excited!! He waved at students in the hall, some giving him smiles and others ignoring him. He was heading to the Quad, but noticed a girl in particular.
“Hungry?” Jack asked, and she nodded. Hadn’t eaten in a day or so, however long she’d been asleep, and was exhausted.
Jon gave him a smile, patting Cow’s side. “Wonderful plan.” Martin pulled a statement out, passing it to Jon. He waved goodbye to Martin as he left. “Love you!” he called.
They reached the end of the hall, silent as could be. Jack held his hand up, signaling her to stop. He checked around the corner, and waved Ashley into the hall with him. It was too dark to see clearly, but from his best estimate, they were okay to head through.
He’s a teacher now, he needs to set examples for the others. She did too as the leader. “Kids in the back- get to work please.”
“About that,” he whispered, as Beaut began to bark. The attention snapped to Ashley- who did not look good. There was blood pooling around her from multiple locations. “They did find us.”
Ashley broke it. “Werewolf?” she said, as if just realizing. Her head twitched, and she clasped her hands together, trying to lift one side of herself off the bed, failing with the pain she felt.
Martin jumped up and down, letting a proud cheer. The fog raised with his mood. He tossed his hand through the air, and the fog started to move, but then it took a turn for the dangerous, fog rushing around Dean and Martin, turning in a vortex.  The former calm static and cracking crescendoed into chaos.
Jack got up quickly, and placed the blade against the Vampire. He really didn;t want Ashley to see this, and she was going to be attacked by the werewolf, who she just kicked in the face and gut. The werewolf just seemed amused now at her attempts, backing off for a mere second, as if playing with its prey.
They argued for a minute, before Rowena stopped them. “Both of you, argue later please- for our sake.” Ashley nodded, and Jody looked upset.
Rowena lowered her hands, still staying far away from Martin. “I believe you're not a Lukas, they have a certain arrogance and pride to their personality. But I just didn’t realize you meant,” she shivered, “those archives. I met Magnus a long, long time ago. I was never as glad as when I heard of his demise back then, but” she said bitterly, “his Institute lived on.”
She tried her fingerbreathing, she tried to ground herself but naming objects, counting colors, she tried counting backwards by seven. She wanted to tear at her skin and rip it open, it felt like she was trapped and unable to breathe.
“I’m sorry what do you mean monsters are all real and you hunt them,” Ashley said. Jack had just finished explaining the hunting life and his family. “I mean I get that but” she let out a noise.
Cas nodded, and Sam repeated the motion. Jon sighed, and opened the Eye. “I need some more info- what kind of hunt, where.”
She introduced him to a few other things. Minecraft, and more. She handed him a card at the end of the week, which would allow him to get an account on his computer. “Text me when you do” she insisted.
She looked confused for a second, and then thought for a second. She smiled after a minute. “Seriously? If you're serious, yes please.” She moved out of the way and gave him a big hug, muttering thanks.
That said, they weren’t the best. Some of the timing was off, so they spoke out the timing, and he let the student who was on time show the pace. Before long the bell had rung, and the kids were out before long.
The Lonely flooded into his feet, trying to suck him away. “I- I’m a British archivist assistant! I’m here with my partner!” he said quickly. The tallest man stood menacingly, despite Martin having an inch or two on him.
Finally, she felt the panic subside slightly, enough to where she could ignore it and focus on the blaring alarm. What was it- fire, flood, earthquake? No, it wasn’t hot or smoke, no leaking liquid under the door, no shaking of the ground. Intruder then, most likely, possibly, or carbon monoxide- but how could it be carbon monoxide? They were underground, but did that even make a difference? She sighed, and turned to Jack’s bed. She didn’t understand how he was still sleeping. She reached into her bag, grabbing her water- peppermint spray that she used to take on bike rides and she now used as a perfume of sorts. She pulled out her yarn too, a half-crocheted strand from a project she was working on, stuffing it in the pocket of her jacket.
“You got it.” Dean gave him a thumbs up. They ordered dinner like an old married couple, knowing exactly what the other preferred.
He laid his hand on Castiel’s and slowly guided him to his crotch, letting him feel his hardness and showing him it was okay to take things further. Castiel still looked at him questioningly, but Dean nodded at him reassuringly.
Castiel leaned forward to put his phone on the coffee table before  putting his sock-clad feet up next to it. He shrugged and leaned back comfortably, looking at the TV instead of Dean when he replied, “Same as every year. Spend Christmas eve on the couch with booze and cookies, watching sappy Christmas movies. Christmas day I stay in bed for as long as I want.”
Castiel, one leg folded under the other on the couch, was calling Heartburn, the place they always ordered their burgers from. Dean finally took  off his shoes and slipped off his jacket and left them where he was standing: the jacket over a kitchen chair and the shoes beneath it. He sat down next to Castiel and turned on the TV but muted it while the other was on the phone.
He wants Cas in his bed, he wants to feel his warmth and light. He wants to watch more movies with him wearing his shirt. The thought of never doing it again actually hurts him..
This takes place around the next episode in season 11. I am really excited about this one! I was a little buzzed doing the editing, but it may have made it better? IDK I am INTO it lol. Bare with me I am just so excited people are checking this out and I wanted to get you guys some of the good stuff as soon as possible. I am happy for feedback As I am still learning. I have 3 more written just need editing and as long as you guys want I will keep going.
"looking good Cas" he turns his eyes quickly to the floor and says in a deeper voice "you ready to see one of my favorite movies?"
Dean dreams of the darkness and light, of cold and warm, of Amara and Cas. They seem to battle for space in his dream, they both fade but it's bright and he is warm. Before he opens his eyes he feels true comfort. He wakes up on Castiel's chest, face pressed against his own Zeppelin shirt, he looks up to see Cas simply allowing it while flipping through the choices on Netflix.
"Hey you guys, I'm pretty beat, I can crash in another room. Cas, you can sleep in my room and watch my TV if you want.".
At the Bunker Dean tries to find Cas, he is not there, Dean starts to worry but calls his cell. Cas answers and lets him know he will be back shortly, Dean tells him he wants to see him when he gets back...
Dean did not want to go on a hunt right now, he couldn't be more annoyed to leave the Angel in his bed alone. Unfortunately he doesn't have a good excuse of why not to go, so he and Sam head out.
Pacing in the kitchen he plays back in his mind "It's fine Dean" he has now convinced himself Cas said this out of pity to save him the embarrassment. Cas would never want Dean to feel bad, he just tolerates Dean's desire to be close because he is a good friend. Dean decides with the popcorn he will go back and just stay a decent distance away, he thinks about the size of the bed. if he goes all the way to his side he should be able to put 4 inches or so between them. Confident with the plan he marches back to the room with popcorn in hand.
This has been my first fic, I plan to continue it eventually but will need to do a serious combing through of the episodes after these. So it may come up eventually, if not I hope you enjoyed my head cannon so far. Let me know in the comments if you want me to keep going!
"Oh yeah I would like to stay here and cry on him all day while he watches' ' Dean shakes out the thought and agrees to go.
Sam is at the table nerding out about a Lizzie Borden's house that has had murders lately. Dean, annoyed , realizes that Sam just wants to go because he is a serial killer dork. Dean is surprised that Sam hasn't said anything about Cas… in his bed...
Cas' words wash over him like a wave of relief, he feels suddenly calm. He is not sure how Cas does it. His voice feels like a familiar song that comforts Dean. He can move on for a moment to let his mind wander, he can't help but wonder what else is in that bag?
In a damp abandoned warehouse he hears what sounds like a disoriented Cas, approaching a screaming woman, "Not today!" he thinks.  Cas would rather be hurt, that hurt someone, and Dean is not going to let that happen. He runs to follow the sounds, and he sees Cas with blood rimmed eyes strangling a woman. "Cas Stop!" Dean remembers when Cas was trying to stop him, what Dean did to him, how he thrust the angel blade next to Cas because even with the mark he can't kill his friend.
"I am freaking happy man, I know we need a plan to fight the darkness, but right now you me and Sam, safe in the bunker, together, this makes me happy."
Still looking at the floor but starting to glance up to his TV to navigate to the movie, he sees Cas cross the bed to the right side and while staring straight ahead he feels a surge of every nerve in his body responding to Cas slowly sitting down beside him. The bed was a single so he knew it would be snug, he and Sam had managed to fit comfortably to watch shows before. But with Cas's body being about a half inch from his side, every part of his right side started to tingle and even ache a little, the hairs on his right arm and leg jumped towards Cas.
Cas begins to quake periodically from the spell within. Dean can't let himself feel the guilt of what is happening to his friend. He needs to fix this. He can't save the world right now, but he can focus on Cas.
Castifer gets the call and shows up, he offers to take Dean back in time to retrieve the hand of God from the ship transporting it. Dean is eager to get some time alone with Cas, he  jumps at the idea and convinces Sam to stay home from the trip.
He can't place his anger, why was he so mad at Cas, why did he feel compelled to go yell at Cas some more, he couldn't analyze his feelings anymore, he was done he was going to take his frustration out on his friend. He stumbles up to stand, the effects of slamming those drinks now apparent; he staggers a bit but his stride corrects, now with determination he heads to the room that Cas walked off to.
It was too late, Cas followed the request and now was facing the shower. The shower door is clear glass and Dean is startled when he looks over to see a trench coat holding what looked like a grocery bag.
Cas is not amused, and seems a little embarrassed. Dean is nervous, but for other reasons. All he is wearing are shorts and Cas is on his bed. They have porn and lube.. Dean feels like may start freaking out, before he can spiral Cas gets up to grab his coat. He says he is going to go in another room for a while. He places the items back in the bag and begins to take them with him on his way out the door.
Back at the bunker Cas is still in his shirt, but has made it to sitting at the table. Cas heals Sam without being asked, Sam thanks him and then makes his way upstairs to shower.
The door was ajar, he shoves it open and struts in  slamming it behind him. This was the one of the rooms behind the library that held files. "Why had he come in here?" Dean thought. Dean was sure that Cas was disappointed in him, hell he was disappointed in himself. He would never admit it but wanted to prove it, he wanted Cas to make him feel bad "Cas what do you think you're doing?".
Dean walks down to the kitchen wearing his robe and a smile, he is refusing to think too much about what was going on between him and Cas. When he stumbles on Sam yelling at an invisible man, he then notices sweet treats and marshmallow covered nachos on the table. Sam was now pinning the invisible man to the wall. The man revealed himself and Dean was annoyed to find out it was Sam's Imaginary friend from childhood here to ask for help on a hunt.
He guides Cas to his room, Cas tentatively sits on the left side of the small single bed still wearing his trench coat. Dean watching this rocks his head back and rolls his eyes.
Dean feels heavy with guilt about Charlie and Cas, and every other godforsaken thing he cares about.
His back to Cas now cutting bread to assemble a sandwich and he feels a warm presence behind him. He turns around in time to see Cas placing fingers on to his forehead. All Dean can notice is his back is against the table and Cas is only about 8 inches from him with his entire body. The healing touches tingles through his entire body, he feels clean now too, clean from darkness and clean from the trip he just took, it's amazing how easily he can do that. With Cas' fingers still on Dean's forehead Dean blurts out on accident
Sam is able to blast him away with a sigal but this just gives Dean some time to process his true Despair about the situation. He was going to tell him. They could have had a shot.
After some prompting from Sam he remembers meeting the darkness, he remembers she saved him, was he supposed to be grateful?
This interpretation gets even more indisputable in the next chapter. I can't tell you how many notes were taken to make sure that this can slide effortlessly into the story.
Dean is disoriented, and shows up back by the hotdog stand, he gets in his car and heads to the blast sight.  He calls Cas to tell him where he will be and heads to where the blast was, even more disoriented and now nauseous he pulls over to throw up. Cas has perfect timing as usual, he finds Dean who is now throwing up on the side of the road. Cas immediately tends to him and explains that it was smiting sickness that has him feeling this way. With Dean OK Cas goes to see if Amara was gone.
Before Cas arrives Dean had phoned him to say that he is going to Hell to find Sam. When Cas arrives the message on his chest says "I am coming" A few moments after Cas meets with Dean they hear Lucifer beating Sam.
Dean can tell Cas is comfortable and happy this makes Dean happy. His favorite angel that has been trying to save him now looks content, he deserves this.. Dean noticeably smiles at Cas and nods his way to show he is excited. Dean also unintentionally lets Cas know he looks good with an accidental raise of his eyebrows. This only widens Cas' smile, working in a feedback loop Dean feels he should try to break this spell or they won't stop.
He doesn't think of Cas that way, and Cas may not think of anyone that way, or atleast Dean hopes that's the case. At least this way they can be alone, but together when Sam inevitably pairs off with someone.
Cas ponders all Dean has said and nods his head and looks to the TV to see what Dean has planned. Dean hasn't thought that far ahead, he knew he wanted Cas in his bed, he knew he wanted to be close with him. These thoughts have him too distracted to choose a movie. Finally after flipping through Netflix a bit he asks Cas.
He best turns out to be pretty good as he stops freaking out long enough to say in a very cool collected way
When confronted Castifer tells him that he is trying to find a way to stop Amara. Dean is put off by Cas, nothing about him feels normal right now. Castifer says that he "had Amara in his sights" and that "he couldn't take her out." Dean, surprised and scared that Cas had gotten near her, is now worried for his safety.  He puts his doubts aside and talks with Castifer about Amara.
Sam calls and he needs help on the case. Dean heads back and still feels off about his talk with Cas.
What happens next is a blur the mark burns as it comes off his arm, was this Death? Did Cas, Crowley and Rowina pull it off? "Now that is an interesting team up" he thinks to himself. Before he can begin to think about the consequences of his choice, the darkness erupts around him, Sam, and the impala.
He couldn't think of logistics of any of it, he cannot stand the idea of not being Cas' favorite human, the thought of that upsets him to his core. He is approaching the room Cas is in his shirt, in his bed, his heart is racing from the things going on in his head. He tries his best to pull it together.
Sam and Dean deal with the direct impact of the darkness's destruction, going through the motions to try to correct what he broke. Another flash and he is with the darkness, he feels a connection to her, like she is linked with the darkness inside him, it feels like killing her would be killing his own darkness and right now it feels like that may be all he has inside him.
With that Cas scoots replacing the distance between them. Dean gives up and focuses on the movie, Castiel is not into him after all. They talk about other shows, and movies, Dean rattles off a list of things Cas needs to see, including the wire.
Cas respectfully declines and Sam shrugs and heads off to bed, leaving Cas and Dean at the table. Dean is a little annoyed by Sam's offer,  can't Sam see that Dean needs to be the one to be there for Cas? Dean catches himself in this thought and just shakes his head and lets out a small laugh.
They then meet with Rowena to talk about how they will set this meeting up, Dean still hates her for what she did to Cas. Dean leaves to go to investigate the massacre at the church. Outside its doors he can feel the darkness. He walks past the hot dog stand in front of the church and is teleported by Amara to a clearing. She reaches out for him, flirts with him and he feels the darkness inside him being drawn to her. Every time he feels drawn to her he remembers its the dark, bad, evil inside of him that craves her. He is so upset with her for hurting the people in the town, and in the church.
Dean feels wrong doing it, but if they really are going to push past this and be friends, then he should be honest. He tells Castifer that he is attracted to Amara. Saying it to him hurts Dean more than it appears to hurt Cas. Dean goes on to say that it scares him and he is not sure if he can stop it. Expecting a different reaction, Dean is surprised when Castifer puts a cold hard hand on his shoulder and tells him this could be a good thing.
"Here, put this on, Oh and and your on the other side by the way" Cas looks apologetic and stands up still in some pain, and starts  changing. The angel has no shame and begins to undress right where he stood up, he strains to pull off his trench coat and Dean steps into help. He slides the coat off of his shoulder and feels his gaze meeting Cas', pausing for a moment Dean drinks in Cas' stare feeling the same sensation as before washing him with warmth, goodness, and peace.
Cas is here holding him and telling him it's okay to feel weak, this was a first, and what a relief. Why would Cas do this for him, why was Cas still around fighting and dying for Dean, he felt he didn't deserve this, but Cas said that he did. Cas thinks he deserves this, Cas who has seen every bad ugly part of Dean has stuck around.
Dean and Sam's rooms had the best TV's he offered to Cas that he could bring his TV into one of those rooms for Cas to sleep in, but Cas being the angel that he is didn't want them to go without. Sam overhears this and says
He is back in the bunker now, trying to piece everything together. Cas is there which normally makes him happy, but Cas is sick from the attack dog spell Rowena cast on him. Looking at Cas in this weakened state reminds him of the darkness inside of him, he dazes off mid conversation while with Sam and Cas, to thoughts about the darkness in him and looking at Amara which feels like a 10x mirror of his own broken self.
Three angels arrive to smite Amara, she has already said that she CAN'T hurt Dean and blasts him away.
This takes place after episode 11-7 Plush no need for rewatch just listing for context. Cas is still living at the bunker. Thank you for reading❤
He is embarrassed about what happened but Cas seems unaffected. Just the angelic duties of a best friend? A shoulder to cry on.... That's it these mixed feelings about Cas are all just a need to vent out this hurt, its therapy and Cas is a good friend. Dean also figures he just needs to get laid soon, that explains why he stabbed his angel in the leg, it all makes sense now. He continues to watch the show with Cas, making small talk. Cas doesn't bring anything up, he is a good friend.
Cas changes as Dean watches. When he finishes he stands near the bed. Dean gives him the look to join him already, and lifts the blanket. Cas moves under the blanket and as close to the edge of the bed as he can. Dean throws on a cowboy movie he has already seen and scoots closer to Cas. He moves until his entire body is pressed against him.
During a bizarre hunt with the Zana Dean sees  several sparkly and flamboyant men, this makes him uncomfortable. Dean has always had pride in his masculinity, and even though he has softened over the years he was not ready to see himself as a guy that wants to bang other guys, he just wasn't. He had that thought in mind on the drive home when Sam brought up going into the cage. Dean drew the line and demanded that they would find another way.
For the others it didn't really mater but for this Chapter I would highly recommend watching at least the Dean/Castifer scenes and the last 5 minutes of Season 11 episode 11 after or before reading. It was one of the main motivations to tell this story. I hope you are enjoying what I belive to have really happened on the show. Love you guys more to come soon!
Cas is watching, studying as if he knows it's important, but also seems to be enjoying the movie. Dean thinks about Cas in his Zeppelin shirt, and wonders how much Zeppelin has Cas really listened to? What has Dean already played for him? Without his wings he drives now, does he just drive in silence, Dean thinks that he will not stand for that. He is going to make Cas a tape with his favorite Zeppelin tracks. It's nice because he won't be so bored, and maybe he will think back to tonight in the shirt, and think about him. Dean quickly tries to dismiss the thought.
As Castiel's hands moved his shoulders and other muscles in his back would raise and rotate, Dean caught himself in a moment of admiration. He quickly tried to place this feeling, it was happy, happy that Sam, Cas and Dean were under the same roof, that he was about to watch Tombstone, one of his favorite movies with his best friend, probably favorite person? Not a person Angel! This is a freaking angel in front of him, that ditched heaven for him that saved his life, that heals him...
Cas stops for a moment and turns to shuffle through the bag. Dean is sure he could die from anticipation. Cas is back and begins to coat both of their cocks in lube.
Dean was lost in these thoughts and just staring as Cas turned around. Cas is now wearing Dean's worn Zeppelin shirt. He looks more comfortable than Dean remembers ever seeing him. Dean also noticed that his arm muscles fill the shirt out nicely. Cas' eyes catch deans examining him Dean quickly shifts his attention to Cas's eyes. He sees that Cas is smiling subtly through his eyes and they are even brighter now as they pour into Deans.
Once Sam leaves it gets quiet for a minute Dean busies himself to make a sandwich still covered in evidence of battle from the hunt. He glances over at Cas and feels warm comfort, he thinks of what it felt like to wake up on him, then his stomach churns as he remembers Cas scooting away.
Dean gives Cas the popcorn and he sits down, Dean shuts the door to the room, walks to his side of the bed, sits down, gestures to Cas to hold the popcorn up a bit Cas does but is now wearing an almost smug look on his face. Dean acts slightly annoyed as he pulls the covers over both of their laps and wiggles for comfort knowingly and purposefully placing his entire right side alongside and touching Cas'.
He puts the popcorn into the microwave and begins to think and pace. Being this close to anyone is terrifying. Cas is his best friend he gave up an army for Dean, Dean thinks of this and all of the jokes about Cas being interested in him and thinks how incredibly flattered he would be if that was the case, he can't help but smile at the thought how if there were a dude he would want to close to, to touch to be gay for, it would be Cas. Sam would probably be cool about it too, hell they worked together to save Dean. Sam is always telling him to find a hunter who understands. Dean reminds himself that he is not gay and neither is Cas, Cas likes chicks and banged that reaper. Plus Dean thinks Cas would deserve way better than him.
Much of it is a recap looking at what I would argue is definitive proof that something was going on in the scenes we don't see..
Dean's voice breaks as he chokes on his words Cas removes his coat, and jacket. Dean is upset, but this pleases him. Cas rolls up his sleeves and sits on the side of Dean. He puts a firm hand on Dean's bare shoulder and says...
Dean began to scramble trying to focus on putting the movie on, and explaining it away thinking it must be some weird angel static Dean smiles and swallows big, and starts the movie, a few seconds in, still a bundle of nerves Dean smiles and nods nervously, he turns to Cas as to do a quick check in before they begin the movie, and Cas looks back at him so deeply that it makes Dean feel like the only human alive.
Dean comes close to the young girl version of the darkness, she saves him from Crowley, and she is just a teen. He thinks about piercing her with his blade, she smugly implies he can't because they are connected. Maybe it's the connection, maybe it's the fact she is just a kid! He thinks about Cas and Sam watching him stab this young girl. He can't….. He won't…. He just freezes.
Charging around the corner to help they are pulled into the cage with Lucifer. Lucifer beats them down while explaining why he needs a vessel to defeat Amara. He goes on like this until they are all so battered they stopped getting up.. He grabs Dean and threatens to kill him if Sam doesn't say yes. Cas musters up the energy to tackle him and keep him distracted, now receiving the majority of the blows. Lucifer asks Castiel once more if he would be his vessel, and Cas asks if he would really beat Amara? He says
Dean is worried about Sam, about Cas, he jumps in the shower to begin processing. Sam is so hell bent on getting dead talking to Lucifer, he wants to be mad, but he is just scared. He tries to think of something else as the hot water pours over him. "Cas, in the library, with the candlestick", he thinks and starts to chuckle at his own joke, getting a little turned on without thinking he begins to relieve himself, but before he can finish he hears the sounds of grocery bags rustling and a familiar voice.
Just as he is thinking all of these thoughts a strong hand crosses his chest and grabs his shoulder firmly. It's Cas and he is making eye contact with Dean. The hand feels like a warm comfort, that Dean doesn't feel he deserves. He should be on another planet wasting away. At least then the world could be safe, he feels so selfish.
For over a week Dean pours over lore and looks at the computer for so long his eyes strain and twitch, he is not coming up with anything and needs to leave the bunker before he goes insane. He and Sam discuss and Dean makes it very clear that saving Cas is his priority, whether Cas wants to be saved or not.. They go to a funeral of one of their Dad's friends that turns out to be a hunt.
Dean's thoughts are racing, what's fine? Stabbing your friend with your boner is fine? Is it fine because he likes it or because he feels bad that Dean has started to develop some strange urges. Nothing Cas could say would make Dean suddenly be able to wrestle these feelings, he jumps up and tells Cas he will make popcorn and be back.
Sam and Dean set off to find Rowena and to force her to cure Cas. Cas is under the attack dog spell and is roaming nearby. Dean can't think about letting Cas hurt someone, Cas has always been light and hope to Dean, and he beats himself up more than even Dean does. Dean does not want Cas to live the with guilt of hurting an innocent person.
He starts with his right arm reaching for the clock he turns his entire body to face Cas, his chest now touching Cas's arm, his junk now firmly against Cas' leg, his face only inches from Cas', he makes direct eye contact with Cas as he fumbles for the button on the alarm. Their eyes locked in closeness Dean looks to Cas' lips, for a second then back to getting lost in his eyes, this is it, he is so fucking close, Cas seems perfectly content with no objections.
Dean was okay that Cas wasn't interested in him the way he had hoped and feared, this means Dean just needs to get over it, and it's easy for him to compartmentalize.
Back at the bunker he sits down with Sam at the table, Sam asks about Cas, and Dean doesn't know where he went but he is gone.. He still feels weird from his talk with him before. Dean tells Sam something felt off with Cas, in an attempt to see if Sam had noticed. Sam of course had no idea.
Dean considers helping him to unbutton his dress shirt but he was having trouble not getting lost in his eyes. He feels like that would certainly be too close. Dean sits on the bed centered but to the left side a little. He finds the controller and begins flipping through to find Tombstone, Cas is in front of the bed and to the left, he has taken his shirt off and began to remove his pants.
"You are not mad at me Dean, you are mad at yourself. I want to help you, but you don't want to be helped, so you push me away."
Without skipping a beat Sam tells Dean that Cas is on season 2 of the wire. Sam must have checked in on Cas while Dean was getting coffee or in the bathroom. Dean couldn't argue, what was he gonna say,
Dean tells Cas and Sam that Cas is staying in the bunker until he gets better, Dean may not be able to save everyone or take back the things he has done but he will take care of his friend now.
He yells louder "Cas stop!!" this works and Cas begins to turn on Dean. With every punch that Cas mindlessly delivers, Dean feels relief. Dean doesn't know why, maybe because he deserves this for what he did to him? Dean barely fights back.
Dean reminds himself that he and Cas are friends. He hates that Cas has just been gone this whole time. Dean knows that it's his fault, he was starting to push Cas away, and Cas went.
While driving Sam starts asking Dean if he wants more, not Marriage but a relationship, maybe with a hunter.  Dean tries his best to move along the conversation, dismissing that it would happen for him. He thinks he couldn't imagine getting close with anyone outside of Sam and Cas.
As they paw and tug at each other, still lost in the kiss, Dean feels Cas's hand is now gently grazing him. This sends a shock wave through his entire body, he was not ready! After a few more grazes Dean turns to putty, he could cum right now. Dean forces focus because he wants to give back, he had never considered that he would want to touch another dude's dick so bad, but he does, he needs to. He mirrors Cas' movements and grazes his fingers over Cas' member. He is even more turned on and validated to feel how hard Cas is too.
Lost in the kiss Dean feels Castiel's member pressing into his leg, he hates that he has never been this turned on. Still kissing against the cabinet, they both shift to move their groins as close to parallel as they can manage. They are both hardened by this. Castiel can now taste the liquor in Dean's mouth, he slows down and cups Dean's face and hesitating for a moment says...
Dean hated telling Cas about his draw to Amara. He also hated Cas' reaction. He wonders what he would have hoped for, and is embarrassed to realize he was hoping for Cas to be jealous. It has been almost a week since they were in bed together. No girl has lingered in his thoughts like this after a hookup.
Lost in this thought his face begins to burn he feels the familiar facial ache of tears trying to fall, why was he so broken?
Back to watching the movie, Dean starts to think about closing this gap between them, what once felt so close his skin buzzed now feels like a mile away, he decided to get up a bit to shift under the covers just a little shifting could bridge the gap. His plan that he can't even admit to himself has failed. Now they are barricaded apart. Dean begins to beat himself up and make excuses as to why he wanted it in the first place. He isn't Gay and Cas is like a brother to him, more attractive than his brother and not realated, but family none the less.
While these thoughts cross his mind Castiel is looking at Dean's wounds and begins to apologize "Dean there aren't words", Dean can't believe that the angel wants to apologize to him, after the beating that Dean gave Cas when he had the mark. Dean refutes the apology immediately and makes sure he knows he was not to blame.
They make it back home to find out that Cas found Metatron and let him go. Mad at himself for not murdering Amara he lashes out and yells at Cas. He justifies himself by thinking, what if Metatron hurt Cas again? How can he be so stupid. After Dean lashes out at Cas, and he snaps back, Sam leaves the room. Dean is so mad, so scared his eyes are fixed over the table to Cas. Cas with a challenging stare looks back to Dean, they hear Sam walk upstairs and Dean moves to Cas' side of the table. He looks directly into his eyes and like venom spitting from his mouth he says
Ignoring the feeling to sit with Cas, he sits across the table. He doesn't want to crowd him, and he has always felt if he gets too close Cas will be able to see just how broken inside Dean feels.
With those words coming from Cas he feels the dark scared parts of himself fading, was Cas using powers to pull these fears from him? Is this what support feels like? He has always had Sam, but for Sam HE had to be strong, be big brother Dean.
Later that night Dean was laying in his bed off to the side with room for another still open beside him. His room felt cold and dark, that's how he felt around Amara. He was attracted to her but he didn't want to be. Staring at the ceiling he thinks back to the warmth and light that he had felt with Cas. He didn't feel that from him today and that concerned him.
Dean is really excited to show Cas this movie and he can't remember the last time he had true downtime with his best friend. Because of the limited TVs in the bunker, Sam and Dean have sat on the same bed before to binge watch game of thrones. So why did having Cas sitting in his bed make him nervous now? Is it because Dean is still convinced if Cas sees him too closely he will see his darkness? He thinks that must be it, and shrugs it off.
Sam and Dean do what they can to save the people in the town, closest to where the darkness arose, he flashes back to Amara telling him that they are bound, and he winces at the thought, she is bound to the things inside of him that he wishes he could wash clean of, the things he wishes he was not.
Similar to this Dean and Cas have had many stares over the years, most make Dean feel good, worthy of saving and cared about, he appreciated that about Cas. When Dean truly hates himself sometimes just looking at Cas and he can turn that around. Dean is past that now and for this moment truly happy, so naturally needs to look away.
Cas asks how the hunt went and Dean gives him the highlights. Dean asks him what's in the bag? Cas looking embarrassed pulls out one of the items, it was a packaged pie. Dean chuckles at the irony, he was really hungry and pie sounded awesome! Cas also pulled out a plastic fork so Dean was able to begin devouring the pie immediately.
Sam and Dean find where Amara is and Dean is ready, he wants to end her to end the darkness in him. Maybe things could be different, better if he wasn't tied to the dark….. He is ready.
Back at the bunker they get in late and Dean can't think about Cas, he is too scared of what that could mean about him. Maybe he can just keep his distance and these urges will go away. As these thoughts are racing in his mind he runs into Cas in the hall of the bunker. His heart drops, he hates this. Dean, not knowing what to do, just stares nervously and Cas responds with an understanding look. Dean can't think of what to say to him... and even though he hates it, he goes to his room alone to fall asleep.
Dean tries to stay focused on the TV then before he knew it, his eyes were back on Cas. Cas had his back to Dean and was pulling up the borrowed ball shorts and had started to move the shirt around in his hands, presumably to find the head hole, Dean watched as Cas did this his shoulders were noticeably strong.
Dean asks "What about Cas?" Expecting Sam to say something so he doesn't have to go to this house, Dean doesn't really want to leave, but he can't just lay in bed with Cas all day, even though for a moment the thought does please him…
Dean now wrapped in a towel using another to dry his head steps toward Cas, seeing him now brings a smile to his face. He grabs some shorts and returns to the bathroom to put them on. Dean goes and sits on his side of the bed. Cas tentatively sits on the other side.
Watching families, people torn apart by what he unleashed, he can't even think about it for a second without spiraling into despair. He feels unclean, broken, he can't think about that right now he needs to help the people he can and fast. Kill first and ask questions later.
“Right. I did. I think” she said, confused but accepting of that information she got. Her head swooped to the side for a second. She noticed the bandages on her. “Oh. Thank you,” she offered with a smile. “For bandaging me, Mrs. MacLeod.”
He gave a dramatic gasp. Beaut held her head down and let out a whine, while Miracle nudged Beaut with the top of their head. “You two! You both got so yucky, didn’t you.” He looked to Dean, who gave a nod. Jack smiled, and the two took the dogs into the bathroom, and washed them off.
Ashley nodded. “It's for my anxiety, OCD, and depression. OCD mostly but it’s supposed to help the others too. I'm at a high dosage, so I have more side effects, which for me is nausea,” she yawned,” and some odd sleep schedule, and some other stuff.”
He helped him when Martin is Lonely, and started to drift. Dean seemed to stick to Martin if he’s alone, or if Jon wasn't with him.
She thought she was safe for a second, but suddenly, she was back in her first thought- get off carpet. She hopped a few feet away, off the carpet, but her mind went off again to get back onto the carpet. She shook her head violently, as if it could solve her issues. The lights turned red.
“The Beholding,” Martin whispered, his eyes dulling slightly. He started to feel numb. “The Avatars. All of them. Caused by Jonah. He did it. He turned everyone into his puppets,” he spat.
The weekend came and went for the adults. Jack, however, spent time with Ashley and some of his friends. When Monday arrived, ork was normal.
Ashley plopped down on the carpeted floor, head next to Jack’s. She let out  a long sigh before pulling out a pair of headphones. She turned to Jack, face suddenly serious. “Jack, have you ever just listened to uh, the same song over and over again until you just, I dunno,” she shook her head quickly. “I take it back. Have you ever just listened to the same song over and over?”
"I got you, baby," Cas groaned back, his hips snapping forward harder. He moaned, the sound broken and loud, his hand tightening harder around Dean. "Fuck, Dean.. I'm so close... Want you to come with me..."
Cas bit down on his lower lip, his body almost aching to push forward. But... "Maybe I'm doing this wrong... I'm hurting you. I don't want to hurt you, Dean..."
“Yes?” Castiel tilted his head and looked straight into Dean's eyes. His mouth slowly formed a smile and he nodded. “Yes! Yes.” He nodded and darted in to kiss  Dean’s lips.
Dean slid his backpack off and sat down next to Cas. He quickly kissed his cheek before opening the backpack to reveal their dinner.
“Dean!” Cas held him tighter, shaking his head. “God, baby, please don’t think that… You’re not a whimp, I promise you that. I… I’ll do a bit of reading…” Cas blushed slightly but pushed away the embarrassment at getting caught looking up things on the computer and having his Dad end up finding out what he was doing. “Maybe I did something wrong. It’s supposed to be good for both of us. We will figure it out, okay?”
How did this happen? How did he get so caught up with work he didn't realize until now that everybody had made different plans? Bobby and Jody were off on some fancy ski vacation,  and he remembered Sammy telling him in a sort of happy-nervous kind of way that Jess' parents had invited him over to celebrate with them this year. He even vaguely recall teasing his younger brother about family dinners, but never gave it a second thought.
“I’m very impressed that you have a real Christmas tree, Winchester.” Castiel chuckled coming back from the lounge room.
“Okay, good point,” he smirked and started pulling the wrapping from the box. Cas looked at the picture on the box. “Dean, this is awesome!” he exclaimed and hugged Dean tight. Dean startled when he received a kiss - not on the cheek, no, but his lips. Dean stiffened and held his breath. It wasn’t like he didn’t want to be kissed, but it was so sudden, so out-of-the-blue. His heart was racing and he was hoping it didn’t show and scare Castiel off.
Dean got off him and watched as Castiel take off the condom, tie it up and throw it on the floor. He snuggled up into his friend’s wide, welcoming arms. Castiel gently caressed his back and held him close.
Dean blamed the chick flick for his head resting on Castiel’s shoulder by the time the end credits rolled across the screen. He got up and stretched. “I’m going to get the cheaper stuff,” he announced and took his Christmas present to the kitchen.
"I made it all myself. Apart from the pie, never done that before and didn't want to risk screwing it up," he explained looking at the food. "I hope you like it."
Cas groaned. He felt himself shaking, a white hot heat driving through him and he knew he wasn't going to last much longer. "Dean," Cas whispered, thumb flicking over the tip of Dean's cock before jacking down again, matching in time with his thrusts.
As soon as their shirts were tossed to the floor, Dean’s fingers were at the top of Cas’ jeans, fingers popping open the button and working the zipper down. Eyes locked, he then slipped between them and opened up his own jeans, leaning forward to kiss Cas’ neck and shoulder as he pushed Cas down and crawled over him.
Dean leaned back too, moving closer to Cas and slipped his arm across his boyfriend’s waist. Cas smiled as Dean laid his head down against Cas chest and he lifted his free hand to card his fingers through Dean’s hair.
he was certainly gonna have bruises on his hip tomorrow. But the feeling of Cas coming inside him certainly made up for that. It felt good, so good. Dean bucked into his boyfriend's hand a few more times before following him closely with his own orgasm.
Dean held Cas's hand gently, a blanket in his other hand, his backpack filled with drinks and snacks.
He stood at the kitchen table, eyes fixed on the note and the wrapped present from Sammy he had found in his mailbox. Looking at the flat rectangular shaped present, Dean fished his phone from the back pocket of his jeans and texted his brother.
“I love you too, Cas. You’re the best boyfriend I could ever have,” Dean whispered softly. “As long as I'm with you everything is good.”
With his lips pressed against Cas’ skin, Dean knew that it was times like these that were his favorite. No one was bothering them, it was just the two of them, like they were the only ones in the world, and Dean couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. He didn’t
Dean opened his eyes a little, staring up at Cas, but closed them again as he let out a low moan, pressing his tongue further into Castiel’s mouth. The heat of their bodies, the press of Cas’ arousal against his own, had Dean’s entire body feeling like it was on fire.
The 23rd found Dean browsing the internet for recipes simple enough for someone who usually just ordered in but still worthy of Christmas Eve dinner. The next day he left work early for once and spent the afternoon preparing the filling for the meat pie he wanted to make for tonight.
"Yes! Yes, that's okay," he husked softly and moved with Cas. Cas smiled, dipping down to catch Dean's lips in a heated kiss as he rocked his hips forward again, trying to get the right angle to hit the sweet spot inside of Dean's body. Dean shifted with him, clenching tight around Cas’ cock, his legs tighter around Cas’ body.
Cas turned his head to the side and pressed his ear against Dean’s chest, letting his eyes fall closed as he focused on the warmth radiating into his body from Dean’s. He felt safe, content, and so very loved being in the enclosure of Dean’s arms. It had only been eight months, barely the blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things and yet, Castiel felt like he couldn’t remember what life was before Dean Winchester had plowed into it and he couldn’t picture his life without him.
They ate together in companionable silence. By the time they’d polished off two sandwiches each, the sky had darkened considerably. Cas leaned back on the blanket, folding his arms behind his head and sighed, contentedly.
He’d never felt so alive. Dean’s lips were warm against him, he tasted like summertime and the sandwiches they’d eaten, and Cas truly thought he could get lost in Dean forever. It scared him, in a way, how quickly he’d felt comfortable and safe with Dean. He’d never felt this way about anyone else before. But Dean…. Well, it made sense because, after all, Dean was completely different from anyone he’d ever known.
“I appreciate it,” Cas murmured and leaned over to kiss Dean’s cheek. He smiled and took a bite of the sandwich, groaning as he chewed. “This is so good!”
Dean shimmied out of his pyjama pants, moaning Castiel’s name and rubbing against him. Castiel smiled and started kissing down his chest and belly. He didn’t waste time, nuzzling, teasing, and Dean was thankful for it; he was too desperate to fool around and once Castiel’s lips wrapped around his cock, Dean cried out in relief.
Castiel blushed again and started to pick at the hem of his jeans. “Sorry,” he mumbled, not sure if he’d offended Dean or not. “That’s not really what I meant… I’m just… I don’t know. Word vomit, you know?”
With shaking hands, Cas reached for a condom, tearing it open. He felt himself flush as he took a second to figure out which way it rolled, knowing Dean was watching his every move. Watching Cas calmed Dean more  than it made him nervous. Of course he was nervous, this was the first time they went this far; but seeing Cas fumble with the condom, accidentally putting it on the wrong way at first, showed he was at least as nervous.
