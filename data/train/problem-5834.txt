"Okay. You recognize her?" Tony fishes out his phone, taps the screen twice (holding it low enough for Steve to see that all he does is navigate to his favorite contacts), and holds out a contact with a picture.
"It's okay," Tony says, squeezing his shoulder. He huffs a laugh and says, "Sounds like we were both freaking out about nothing, huh? Okay, so let me just put this out there: I really like you, Steve. The more I get to know you the more I like you. I'd really, really like to see you again. And, yes, I would
"What about him?" Tony doesn't miss a beat, turning his phone to show another contact to Steve. This one's labeled "Rhodey Snugglebums." He, too, is unbearably handsome, and he too laughed his ass off at Steve.
"Eventually, sure," Steve says. "In the meantime, could you - What do you think of all this? What are you feeling? I'm sorry for not asking sooner."
Steve unblocks Tony in front of him, then smiles up at him. The look Tony's directing at him right now - hopeful, happy, heartbreakingly sincere - takes Steve's breath away.
"Okay," Tony says calmly. "There are a few different issues here, so let's go in order, shall we? One, I am not leaving you unless you ask me to go. Two, I am not angry. Three, I'm kinda upset that you've been treating me poorly and that you kept this from me,
body. He bent forward so he could catch a nipple between his teeth. Steve gasped, unconsciously arching up at the touch. "Like that?" Tony whispered, humming brightly around the small pink nub. He bit down again, then sucked on it, hard. "I'm learning all sorts of things about you, Cap."
Part of it was he didn't want to stare, to make Steve uncomfortable or anything of the sort (Maybe -
"Please," Steve hiccuped, gritting his teeth and trying not to buck too hard when Tony's fingers brushed his dick. "Just go back to
, Tony was not going to wait outside for permission while Steve was in the middle of a goddamn medical emergency.
"Honey, that‒" Tony swallowed. "There is no way the dildo I used on you is going to fit into me." But oh, heat was pooling in Tony's gut, and he remembered the way Steve was gasping for it near the end, crying out and raw and sensitive from getting fucked for nearly an hour straight on the highest setting and, god, he'd been a wreck, all spit-slick and wet with come and lube and strapped down like a good little toy, begging for it. And Tony had wanted that, wanted the hard, mechanical precision, the unrelenting steady pace that only a machine can provide (and Tony did not have a
"How's my fella?" Steve asked eventually, when Tony felt himself finally start to go soft and sweet again. The blanket felt heavy over them, warm and weighted and perfect for coming up after a scene. Tony blinked leisurely up at Steve. "Did'ya get what you needed, hm?" he asked, thumbing against Tony's lip.
Steve looked down at his knuckles, at the purple, jagged skin and blew out a long breath. "Yeah, I—" He shook his head. "Mm. I forgot. Sorry."
"Yeah, uh," Steve was frowning, Tony could tell, from the tense of his shoulders to the tone of his voice, to the way his lips felt against Tony's head, "I don't think I'll be able to do that anytime soon." Despite his words and the softness of his dick, Steve's hips were still shifting, still rocking gently against the bed. Steve groaned raggedly, reached down to tug at his dick with sharp, rapid movements. "Maybe—" Steve's voice hitched, cracking along the word. "Maybe I can get it back up—" He kept at it for a minute, trying to coax some life back into it, but it stayed stubbornly half-hard between his legs. Steve's brows pinched. Tony wasn't sure if he should be flattered that Steve seemed to care that much about his comfort to be able to get his rocks off, or horrified that he'd traumatized Steve so severely that even an all-encompassing sex drug couldn't help him keep his erection.
"Yeah, alright," Steve huffed, a grin peeking out from his sour facade, and he knuckled lightly against the side of Tony's skull. "Okay, okay, you're up now, I get it."
"B-babe," Tony moaned, dug his fingers into the duvet. Lube squelched out around his ass, around the dildo as it rocked in place, dripping messily down his crack, his thighs. It (and Tony, too, he thought with a shiver) was going to be filthy by the end of this. He whined again, high and in the back of his throat. His nipples throbbed, his cock, hard and heavy between his thighs, bobbed with every brush against his prostate.
"—eep yourself hydrated," his idiot doctor continued. "Make sure you keep monitoring your vitals and come see me or Dr. Nguyen immediately if you feel like you're getting worse—"
Usually a break like this would've tightened Tony right back up, but when Steve swirled his fingers he was pleased to see that Tony was still soft and giving around his fingers. Steve's third finger slid in with little resistance, and he had to take a minute to marvel at the ease of Tony's body, soft and sucking and eager around him. He scissored his fingers apart, basking in the low, shuddering moan that Tony gave, and made a mental note to bring this up again at a later date.
," Steve moaned brokenly, and then he was coming, shooting down Tony's throat, in his mouth, down his chin. Tony's jaw ached, clicked when he tried to close it, so he just let it hang open, laving his tongue over Steve's cockhead even through his wet, shaky gasps and jittering hips. The dildo fucked into him and Tony couldn't still his hips, couldn't stop the gentle rutting against the cushion and then Steve's cock was slipping from his lips and Tony fucking
) once he was fully in control of all his mental faculties was just too much to imagine. Once this whole ordeal was over, Tony had no doubt that Steve would be on the first bus out of here, to say nothing of whether or not he'd even remain on the Ultimates. Tony shivered again, which sent a shiver down Steve's own spine, and roughly cleared his throat. "In the meantime," he mumbled, "we still have to take care of you."
"We're clearing out the labs now," Tony said into the comms, ducking low as Cap's shield went wide. Three men dropped, but the fourth one's body armor miraculously held, and he swung his rifle towards Tony with a shout. Bullets dinged his chest plate and shoulders, a few ricocheting off the jaw of his helmet and into the wall behind him. "Ugh, that's going to be a bitch of a dent to bang out," he grumbled, more to himself than Cap or Wasp, then mimed cracking his knuckles at the hired gun in front of him.
"It was really more like three walls-" Tony tried weakly, but Steve gave him a look and Tony wilted, slipped his hands up and around Steve so he could hold on tight. "Steve, Steve—"
. Everything hurt - his head, his back, his cock, even his jaw (probably from clenching his teeth too hard). Steve gasped, choked a little on his spit, and rolled his face against the covers. "Tony," he sobbed out, his voice hitching. He just, he
Tony snorted. "Like you don't already know," he teased. "I'm in heaven." And he honestly, truly was ‒ the headache that had been buzzing in his temples all day had started to recede, his muscles were loose and relaxed. He was pretty much half a second from falling asleep in the chair, embarrassingly enough, light and floaty in a way he rarely got outside of sex.
going to need to consider a more long-term solution? Was— was Tony going to have to need to call in a-a professional, because he wouldn't be able to help Steve through this? "I may need to up my game," Tony joked, trying for levity as he climbed into Steve's lap and looped his arms around him. Steve frowned up at him and Tony couldn't help the angry little prickle it sent up his spine. "What, darling? Am I that boring for you already?" he asked, a bit snidely, and Steve sighed, lifted his hands up and to either side of Tony's waist.
"Don't think I don't understand what you're doin' for me here, Stark," Steve murmured, reaching out and knocking their foreheads together. Something in Tony's breath hitched, and his throat tightened up with some nasty emotion that made him itch for a drink. "M' feelin' okay right now, so let me help 'ya out while I'm all here."
"Yeah, there we go," Steve praised, thumbs massaging gently around the edges of Tony's chest. "I'm gonna sit back against the headboard now, and pull you in my lap, okay? What's your color, Tony?"
"Like hell," Steve grunted, deciding to give a little back to Tony and grazing his own teeth along the sensitive skin of Tony's throat; Tony shivered.
"Nah," Steve replied, silencing him with another hot mess of lips and tongue. Tony moaned into his mouth. "Nah, I need this, too," Steve confessed, wrapping his slick, sticky arm around Tony's waist and pulling them close. "I want you to feel good — wanna see that sweet look on your face when I call you
Tony suddenly felt wrong-footed about this whole thing. "Steve, we- we had a briefing, remember?" he said, setting his drink down on one of the benches and jogging forward. "Steve, your
"You got this," Steve told him, then Tony could really feel the stretch of what had to be the widest part of the plug (
more embarrassing? Was he so hungry- so slutty for Steve's praise that just a simple 'good boy' had him rocketing up to the edge of orgasm?
"I can't—" Steve's lashes were fluttering, and Tony could see the veins in his neck bulging outward. "It won't stop."
"That's—" Tony's teeth chattered, and he had to gulp back a whine. "Steve, honey, that's hardly salacious," he stuttered, arching his ass into the touch. Steve pinched him, a bit roughly, then dragged his lips down the back of Tony's neck, not particularly shy about how wet it was, how much tongue he used. Tony shuddered, felt his body tingling all over, like he'd just crushed and swallowed a Vicodin and chased it with gin. His body moved where Steve moved it, where Steve
Tony shivered again, letting his head loll to the side. "You're a menace, Rogers," he murmured, but it was low and throaty and Steve could hear in his voice that he was seconds from caving. "And just what else did you have in mind, hmm? We're not honestly spending all day getting seaweed wraps and pedicures are we?"
"Oh, sweetheart, don't you worry," Steve soothed, dragged his fingers through the foaming mess of come on his dick, around Tony's hole. "Don't you worry one bit, I am going to make you so full-" Steve massaged the base of his cock, where he was splitting Tony in two, around the soft, sensitive rim of him.
"Hey, hey, hey, it's okay," Tony soothed, running his hand through Steve's hair. "You've got a little bit of super strength there, tiger. You just fucked my face for a good long while, yeah? Poor thing was bound to bruise sooner or later." He leaned over, pressing a soft kiss to the top of Steve's hair. "You stopped when I started getting sore."
"Hey, Jonathan—" Steve started; Not-Jarvis looked up from his dusting. Steve wondered what Jonathan thought of him, of how he'd fucked his boss bloody, how he'd sent Tony running from the room. "—You haven't seen Tony, have you?" he asked; Steve wanted to fidget so he fell into parade rest instead, dug his thumb into the meat of his palm.
Tony gasped, jolting hard all over, his fingers clenching tight over Steve's forearms, and Steve chuckled, rubbed the tip of his nose to Tony's neck. "
Steve hummed. "Good," he purred, sliding a finger down to play at the loose hole of his ass, even as Tony tried to tighten it around him. "Mmm, someone needs a plug, I think," Steve murmured, reaching off the bed and into the top drawer, where they kept most of their toys. "Gotta keep all that come in you while I get you off, I think."
Tony gasped at the sharp pinch of the first clamp. "You‒ got it, sugar," Tony groaned, shifting restlessly as Steve fastened the other clamp on. Steve gave a light tug on the chain and smiled at the way Tony squirmed.
Steve hummed, and it was a low sound, something dark and proprietary that left Tony trembling for an altogether different reason. He rolled Tony over onto his front, brushed soft, sensuous kisses down the length of his spine. When he grabbed hold of one of Tony's cheeks so he could spread him wide, Tony whined, tried not to roll his hips into the mess of come on the sheets and his stomach. "Such a pretty hole," Steve murmured, thumbing at it and— and Tony could tell that he was watching the mess of come drip out of him. Tony shuddered, all the way down to his toes. "S' gonna look even prettier with my shield in it," Steve whispered hotly.
"Oh, Tony, Tony, I've got you," Steve groaned, teeth sinking into the thick of his throat. "Let me‒ let me, please, oh can I‒?" he stuttered shakily, and Tony could feel his other hand grabbing at his cock, the slick slapping of skin on skin as Steve furiously jerking himself off.
-), and all the gin he'd had on the drive over seemed to hit him all at once, throwing a dizzying flush from his head to his belly. "Steve, darling, w— what's the matter, what can I d—"
"Yeah, tiger," Tony murmured, kneading lightly at Steve's neck. Jeez, he was tense. "I could— I could help you out, yeah? With your… problem." Tony almost grimaced. God, he was supposed to be smooth, a playboy, a whore, and he couldn't even properly seduce a hard-and-wanting Steve Rogers? But, Steve— he, he moaned, long and low, and sort of collapsed, against the bed, falling down to his knees and leaning his head against the corner of the mattress. He was panting like he was mid-mission, like he was running full-speed in a knock down drag out against the Hulk, and Tony just— if he was going to propose this to Steve, he couldn't, couldn't do this without giving Steve all his options.
Tony swore, burying his face in the covers, lifting his ass and spreading his legs and making sure to stay relaxed while Steve fucked ever so gently in, the trembling of his thighs betraying just how tightly Steve was controlling himself. Tony's breath hitched and he rolled his hips back, the sharp pinch of pain worth it for the way Steve's hips stuttered and he moaned over and over into Tony's hair, fingers spasming against the lace and silk.
Steve made a small noise in the back of his throat, his hips hitching forward again, and when Tony pushed his tongue hard against the underside of his cock, he whined and gave a full-body shudder before rearing back and fucking his cock hard down Tony's throat.
"Mm," Steve said, but Tony couldn't quite tell if he was agreeing or not, staring-but-not-quite seeing down at Tony's hands as he dabbed ointment onto Steve's knuckles and wrapped him up in a swath of bandages. "I'm… I gotta go for a run," he said, standing up and shoving Tony to the side.
!" Tony giggled, but there was a tension in his body that Steve hadn't felt before. "No, it's best just to limit human contact for now, just in case. Thank you, Jarvis."
"Wh— what are you doing?" Tony asked, glaring poutily at Steve as he manhandled him onto his side beside Steve. "Wh— Steve, come on, you're hard again, I've seen it, I can feel it—"
Steve beamed. "All for me, yeah," he murmured, bending forward to slip his tongue in Tony's mouth. Tony moaned, surging forward to suck on Steve's tongue, and Steve hummed, driving it in deep, like he could fuck Tony's mouth the way he'd done his ass. "Gosh, I'm lucky," he hummed as he wrapped the rest of his hand around Tony, started to jack his cock nice and slow. Tony knew his cock didn't always play nice, especially when he kept himself from tipping over the edge for any extended period of time, but Steve also knew how to get his body to work with them, knew just how to finger Tony, or keep the pleasure steady and work him up slowly so his body could reach that peak.
"I— I usually insist, but…" Tony bit his lip, and full-body shudder racked its way down Tony's spine, all the way to his toes. "I don't— I don't mind if you don't," he whispered, almost shyly, his eyes fluttering down and off to the side. "It's your show here, cowboy."
of you," Tony wailed, trying to cry into his fists again, but Steve wouldn't let him, wouldn't let his face go and just pulled him forward until their heads were knocking together and Steve was rolling his forehead to Tony's and breathing each other's air. Tony fisted his trembling hands, pulled them into his lap and tried to get his breathing under control. "I-I
," Steve gasped. "S-so good, Tony, that's so good— good boy." He reached out to stroke and touch Tony's face, spread his legs out wide so he could wrap them around Tony's hips again. "Tony, Tony," he murmured, petting Tony's cheeks. "Look at me." Tony's hips stuttered on the next thrust and he shuddered, eyes blinking blearily open so he could stare down at Steve's deep blue, soft and shining eyes. "You're so good, Tony," Steve told him, clenching down tight around Tony's cock. "Thank you for giving this to me—" Tony gasped, felt his raw, ugly emotions rearing their heads once more, but Steve kept his hands clasped on either side of Tony's face. "You're such a good boy," Steve moaned, and pressed a kiss to his lips. Steve came, sighing in relief almost, come dribbling out of his chafed, red, angry cock, and then he was mouthing gently at Tony's lips again. "Again," he begged, licking into Tony's mouth. "Again, please."
, Steve thought he could make out, but then Tony was lifting his hips again, reaching out and holding on and clinging to Steve as if
"I don't have to say yes…" Tony prompted, and he even felt a little clearer than he had not thirty seconds ago, his mind buzzing with the possibilities ‒ the
Steve fucked him hard that time, fast enough that Tony was jolted forward onto the bed with each thrust, that Tony could barely think to remember his own name, let alone clench up and make it harder on himself. When he came, Tony was still soft underneath him, his belly lax as Steve pumped him full of more of his come. "How many's'that?" Steve asked, biting gently at the shell of Tony's ear.
"You acting like an asshole isn't going to make me leave any faster," Steve grunted, finally moving to stretch out on the tile. "I know that's what you're trying to do." Honestly, Steve was furious, despite knowing that was exactly Tony's intentions. He hated being made to feel like an idiot, bumbling his way through the future with no clues on how to act or who expected what and Tony
"Yeah, well, how can I say no to my best guy?" Tony murmured, and affection bloomed in his chest, spreading out like sunshine to his fingers and toes.
"Have a good day, Mr. Stark," Cindy said with a flourish of a bow, ushering her assistants out with her just as Tony rolled off his chair and into Steve's lap.
," Steve insisted, reaching out again to cup at Tony's face. "You think if I'd wanted to, I couldn't've thrown you out on your ass and broken half your bones to do so? Get real, Stark," Steve laughed miserably, sniffling wetly and pressing their foreheads together. Tony smelled sour, like vomit and sweat and chemo, but it was the best thing he'd smelled all day because it was
"I am," Steve says. He thinks about bumping into Tony on their way into work yesterday, how Tony'd flushed to the roots of his hair when Steve stuttered hello, and feels his smile grow even wider. "I really, really am."
Tony texts him later that night and Steve excuses himself to the bathroom and splashes water on his face so they don't realize he maybe cried a little. He's about to go back into the living room when he realizes Nat is going to figure it all out anyway, so he pulls out his phone and delete's Tony's text. Then blocks his number for good measure. Then he goes to face his well-intentioned friends.
"No, look, he knows how important this is to me, and he reminded me and said he should probably go, and I didn't ask him to stay."
Initially Steve had been planning on just going to Starbucks, but when he began turning towards the door Tony had taken one look at it, said, "Nope, no, no way, no how," snagged him by the hand and tugged him away. Steve's so startled by the contact he just goes with it, walking away and not tugging his hand out of Tony's grasp. After a moment he sees Tony glance down at their hands before hastily letting go, but it's nice while it lasts.
They hold it for just a moment, not even long enough for Steve to start guessing and second-guessing whether he should pull back first or let Bucky hug him as long as he wants, and before he can get himself tied in a knot Bucky steps back and nudges his shoulder. "Punk," he says again, voice filled with affection.
So he leans over the bar and waves whenever the barkeep is facing his direction and patiently waits to see if this, THIS will be the time he actually has to go back to his friends and say he couldn't order. It's a fear that's horrible and persistent but not, he feels, unreasonable.
Bucky to know - but all too soon Bucky figures out that something's up. After that it's only a matter of time, no matter how hard Steve fights it. Soon enough Bucky (halfway through getting Steve to talk, mostly through telepathy) gets Steve to tell him part of what happened and guesses the rest.
He smiles, and he looks good. Steve was worried, very worried, that being in the Army would take away that smile, but it hasn't yet. Everything in the frame is dun-colored except for his eyes and his lips: his clothes, his skin, his hat, the tent wall behind him, the dirt beneath his nails, the other soldiers walking and lounging in the background. Sometimes Steve wonders if anyone else over there notices it, how Bucky stands out with splotches of color against a monochrome backdrop, but then he remembers that Bucky stands out the same way in the greys of New York and knows that no one does.
Steve figures out why a second later. He ducks into his room, remembers the folding chair is actually under the couch, and turns around to walk back out just in time to hear Bucky break the silence.
When someone else slides into the space right in front of him, he does nothing except sigh, because that's one more person likely to get a drink before him. There are a lot of people, but not so many that he's beset. No one's bumping into him yet. Which is why he actually notices a touch to the back of his hand where it rests on the edge of the bar.
He turns his face away, makes to get up again, and Tony doesn't say a word or make a move to stop him, but -
"Okay," Tony says. He takes a shaky breath, then looks away, laughing. It doesn't sound happy. "Sorry. I'm freaking out here."
"Of course I do, Jesus, I mean I know I have memory problems but seriously there's no way I could forget the guy even if I wanted to since you talk about him so goddamn much, and wow, Stark, when
"Good. So, is that - are we officially agreeing we'd like to talk to Bucky about the possibility of all of us entering a long-term relationship?"
"I noticed," Steve says. "But hey, what you said earlier, about this being a no-pressure zone? Goes both ways. I'm not going to - to think badly of you, Tony."
"All right," Tony says, oblivious to the fact that Steve's just realigned his life's goals towards making sure they all end up together. "Moving on from there. Yes, I like Bucky as well. Yes, I could like him in a romantic kind of way. You're my priority, though. So far as getting together goes, you're it for me. However, realize that if we did get into a polyamorous relationship, you would BOTH be my priority, okay? Assuming you want a relationship and not just a one-night stand, I mean."
"Get out," he hissed, and he could barely recognize his own voice, but he strode forward and grabbed him (
"Hey, hey, I've got you," Steve soothed; he rubbed a hand down Tony's flank, let his fingertips play gently along the ridges of his spine. "Don't you worry, Shellhead, I'm gonna fill you up - just like I promised."
"Really?" Steve asked, suddenly shy, or possibly embarrassed, another cherry blossom flush painting itself across his cheeks. "That's— that's something you want?"
"Green," Tony murmured, twisting to press a kiss to the hinge of Steve's jaw. "Green green green, so green, Steve, yes, please." Steve chuckled, a soft, affectionate thing, and crawled up to the head of the bed, and Tony followed obediently, swinging a leg up and over Steve's knees so he could settle into the vee of Steve's lap, his ass pressed against the hard muscle of Steve's quads. His hips burned but felt open, the way a good hard stretch felt deep in the muscle.
," Tony gasped, scrabbling for purchase but not quite finding any leverage, Steve's arm wrapped tight around Tony's middle and his dick rolling against his prostate over and over again. Steve rumbled out a laugh, rough and sex-low, and Tony choked on a moan when he reached down and palmed at Tony's cock, stiff and leaking against his belly.
"No, no, no," Tony promised, his legs coming up and wrapping around Steve's ass and thighs. He reached out and clasped Steve's hand in his own, and Tony actually
"Shh, shh, I've got you," Steve whispered. "We're gonna go nice and gentle here, mister, and that's the only way this is gonna go, ya hear?"
On the other side of the lab, a woman in a blue and yellow jumpsuit swung a rifle up at Cap, shouting something angry in Russian and firing a series of rapid-fire darts into the front of Cap's kevlar. Steve grunted and looked down at his chest, unimpressed, before plucking the darts out of his uniform.
," Tony moaned, clutching tightly at Steve's forearms. "Mm, honey, m'so full. T-thank you," he slurred. "
, and it slapped back against his belly hard, splattering precome as it moved. Steve moaned again, low in his throat. Tony dove down then, lifting Steve's legs and bypassing his cock altogether, and Steve nearly shouted when he felt Tony's— hot—
Steve's cock felt in his throat, filling him up and pervading his senses with the musky-sweet scent of him. Sweat poured over Steve, dripping from his abs and pelvis to the sides of his face, from his balls to Tony's neck and chest. His thighs, thick and hard and
"That bad?" Steve asked, though he looked like he was already bracing himself for the worst. He looked— God, he looked miles better than he did earlier, but there was still a healthy flush covering his nipples, a sheen of sweat on his body from head to toe. His cock was harder than it had been in the shower, but it wasn't purple or hot or irritated yet. Steve looked all there. Maybe the readout didn't directly correlate to Steve's intoxication.
All right? But yes, Steve and I have been talking, and we've been talking about asking you if you'd like to be in a polyamorous relationship with us."
At first Steve's smug, but after a little while Tony hasn't moved and Steve's starting to think maybe smugness isn't what he should be feeling right now. The embarrassment comes crashing back over him and he could cut out his own tongue for saying something so pathetic. "Tony? Um, say something -"
"Good night, Steve," Tony says, and then he turns and walks down the steps into the dark. Steve stands there with the door half-open until, just before Tony's footsteps fade into the night, he hears someone whistling. He thinks it's Tony, and he also thinks it's Your Song.
It's Friday and not that late, barely after dinner, really, so Tony hangs out for a while. They're curled up on the couch, and Steve doesn't know how to bring it up. He's toying with the edge of Tony's sleeve to avoid his eye, and for a while Tony just goes with it.
of giving what you've already got. So as soon as they agree to what you want, you say thanks and get the hell out of Dodge."
"Do you have anyone like that?" Steve asks, desperate to ask a question of Tony, before he thinks it through.
Because with Tony - if Tony doesn't want this to happen, if he wants both he and Steve to be exclusive, then nothing really changes. Steve and Tony continue dating, they continue hanging out with Bucky, there's no evidence Steve ever even thought about this.
...Which they do, and hours later they end up curled up in front of the TV and falling asleep together on the couch, Steve leaning against Bucky on one side with Tony curled around him on the other, and Steve wakes to the blue glow of the Bandits DVD menu and thinks this is the most comfortable he's ever been in his life. He likes this. He likes it a lot. They should do this again, except more so, and also often.
Tony pulls out his phone, lights the screen, and slaps it on the table. "Read it and weep, bitches!"
Tony runs a hand through his hair again, then jabs a finger towards Steve. "Would you recognize any of them again?"
Steve's having an asthma attack. Or a panic attack. Or a heart attack. Or something. His chest is tight and his ears are ringing and he can't take his eyes off Tony's gorgeous, gorgeous face.
to figure it out and it stresses him out and makes him snappy and irritable - and being around Tony or Bucky just makes it worse. Usually if Steve is stressed or jittery being around one of them will calm him down, like they can smooth out the sharp edges of the world, but now all seeing either of them does is remind him about what it is he's stressing over in the first place.
The thing is, straight off the bat he's pretty sure Tony would be on board with bringing Bucky into their fledgling relationship.
am pretty far outside your experience, too. So. Just, please remember all this next time something like this comes up, okay? Just try to be honest and remember that I'm on your side. Even if honesty is saying 'I'm working through something and I don't want to talk about it yet,' that's good, too."
He turns around and sees Tony running after him. He wants to just keep walking, but he ALSO wants to stand his ground and use Tony's momentum against him to punch him in the face, so.
"Okay. So you wanted to lose your virginity to him?" Tony doesn't sound put out in the least, nor gleeful; simply honestly curious.
He hated it, knowing Bucky was looking at him even though his eyes were downcast, that strange disconnect even when they could see and hear each other. He hated that Bucky up and left him to go so far away.
They kiss and kiss, and then they kiss some more, until Steve just can't take it anymore. He pulls away abruptly and Tony's grip tightens on his waist. "Steve?"
"Look, it - you don't have to tell me," Tony says, and now both his hands are on Steve - one still around his back holding him to Tony's side, the other rubbing up and down his arm. "There is no pressure here for you to do or say anything you don't want, okay? This is a zero-pressure zone. But I couldn't help but notice - I mean, do you mind if I ask, did you really -"
skeptical that this isn't some kind of elaborate prank, so he does it. Scrolls up then down then up again and taps the screen without really looking.
That should be it, except three paces later Steve looks over his shoulder, and Tony looks over his shoulder, too, and they both duck their heads and Steve's flushing bright red and laughing at himself but it's okay, because he knows that a dozen paces behind him Tony's doing the same thing.
"It's fate!" Tony cries. "Babe, this is one of the greatest love songs ever recorded. We have to dance. It's the law. Look, just move your feet like this, don't even pick them up off the floor, okay? And let me turn you. And away we go!"
"Oh, screw you both," Steve mutters. He's standing next to Tony now and he won't sit down, but he's close enough for the mic to pick him up so Bucky can hear.
Steve rereads the email right before they Skype, so he's still laughing when Bucky calls. Bucky's face smooths into the most content smile Steve's seen on him ages, and he slumps like all his strings have been cut. "Shit, Steve, you look happy."
He invites Tony and Bucky over for dinner the very next night, and asks Tony to come early so they can discuss how to go about approaching Bucky.
life now, but still. Um. What I mean is, all the biggest things in our lives, we've always done them together, you know?"
Tony throws himself down in a booth filled with other beautiful people, puts his hands over his face, and yells, "I cannot
Laughing without realizing it Steve pulls back far enough to turn towards Tony, and sees him standing there, staring at them, looking - something. Nothing Steve understands.
Steve spends a feverish night trying to come up with a foolproof plan. It has to be perfect. He gets one shot at this, and he cannot mess it up. Should only one of them pull Bucky aside? Which of them should speak with him first?
Bucky's always said Steve has the mind of a military commander, albeit one of the ones that would consistently pull insane stunts that ended up working, and as he outlines his twelfth battle plan he can definitely see why Bucky says that.
"He's right," Steve cuts in quickly. "I'd rather cut off my own leg than jeopardize our friendship, okay? Nothing has to change. Nothing has to change quickly, or ever at all. I really, really mean that, Buck."
Somehow that leads into what they do for a living, and Steve finds out that Tony and Bruce run a company together (they actually own two floors of their mutual work building). Apparently Tony's family is big in The Industry (though Steve's still not clear on what industry that is) and he broke away to start his own company. Steve doesn't ask for details, and doesn't ask anything about his family, and Tony doesn't volunteer any information.
"What are you talking about?" Tony says. He comes a step forward, his hands still up, like he's coaxing a wild animal out of a snare. Steve glares, and he stops moving.
They hold eyes for a moment, then they're both laughing so hard they have to clutch at each other to stay on the bench. Or maybe they clutch at each other just because they can. Whichever.
"So!" Steve says without further ado. "So the other night I was out with Nat and Sam and I go up to order drinks, and this idiot kept like nudging into me at the bar..."
His face splits into a grin as soon as his eyes land on Steve. "Hey, man," he says. For one moment neither of them move, and then Tony's resolve seems to break and he swoops forward, tugging Steve into his arms and tipping his face up to put a gentle kiss on his lips.
He drops what he's holding into Tony's upheld hands, and more importantly - Steve leans down and presses a tiny kiss to Tony's lips.
"I'll unblock you," Steve promises. Only partially because it's logistically necessary, but mostly because in among all the shock it's finally getting to him that Tony really
But before Tony quite gets to him he slows down a bit, panting, and holds up his hands. "Hey, man," he says, and the nervousness in his smile is so overwhelming it manages to catch Steve's attention. "Have you gotten any of my texts?"
"Tony," Steve says, struck by a sudden urgent thought, "you know that I'm not asking for this because I'm not happy with what we have, right? Please tell me you know that.
"Okay," Tony says at last, when he seems to realize Steve's not going to say anything until he responds.
People who look like Tony don't talk to people like Steve, much less ask them out. But Tony does and Tony did, so. Evidence points to the contrary. Evidence upsetting their worldviews just happened right in front of their collective attractive faces, and really Steve almost can't blame them for staring. But only almost.
Tony thought snidely, then chastised himself for his rudeness. It wasn't Jan's fault that Steve got hit with some goddamn superdrug.
"God look at you," Steve whispered reverently, fingers sliding out of Tony with a wet, slick sound. Behind him, Tony could hear Steve slicking up his cock, and a shiver slid up Tony's spine at the thought that
"Warm water?" Steve asked, and Tony hummed because yeah, that sounded wonderful. Steve twisted the taps, ran his hand under the gently running water, and when it was the right temperature he spun the attachment onto the faucet and released the clamp holding the end of the hose shut. Tony gasped, and then hummed softly when the warm water started sliding inside him. He'd felt so stuffed, and wet and messy for so long, that even the first tricklings of water in his ass was enough to make him feel clean again. Tony shifted, felt his insides start to warm, and relaxed into it with a smile.
Tony shivered. He slipped the satin robe on, tying the belt loosely at his waist and feeling the hem swish at his waist. Everything felt hypersensitive, from his chest to his cock to his toes, the way the lace scratched at his groin and ass and thighs, the nylon hugging his calves, the soft flutter of the robe as he paced from one end of the room to the other.
," he moaned, low and throaty, two fingers dipping in to flick at his sensitive inner walls before slipping out to start jerking at his cock.
"Cap?" Tony called out, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. He pressed his ear up against the door and tried to resist the urge to barge in immediately. "Steve? Darling, is everything alright?"
‒ Tony hissed in a breath and traced his fingertips up the cleft of Steve's ass and Steve shuddered, hands coming down to rest on Tony's shoulders. He clung to Tony, mouthing at the shell of his ear and moving his hips in tiny, shifting circles, causing the skirt to ruffle and and twist and good
It wasn't like Steve was worried. Steve knew if something were truly wrong with Tony that Jarvis or one of the others would tell him. They wouldn't keep Tony's health from him or anything like that. But…
"It's alright, Captain," Dr. Nguyen murmured to Steve, who was in the middle of doing the world's best impersonation of a mute tomato. "This is probably one of the side effects.  It's not surprising, considering the hormone fluctuation. I'm honestly shocked it hasn't happened sooner."
"Fair enough," Tony whispered, and let himself sink into the bath. He turned onto his side, the water swirling gently with him. "Could you help me out with this then, darling?" he asked over his shoulder, let his lashes flutter shut under the warmth and exhaustion weighing on him.
Silence, and then Tony could hear harsh, heavy panting behind the door. There was another noise from Steve, like he was in
Steve nodded, and curled his fingers around Tony's cock, urging Tony to do the same. "Good," he whispered, shutting his eyes when Tony squeezed his dick just right. He let himself stroke Steve just like that, soft and loving and gentle (all the ways Steve probably never allowed himself to be touched), just coaxing the pleasure out of him millimeter by millimeter. Tony was starting to learn his preferences now, what really revved him up, like rubbing softly against the head of his cock, into the hot weeping slit. Steve really seemed to like a sharp bite with his pleasure; he hadn't quite found his limit yet, but Tony was hesitant to really experiment with some of the kinkier stuff with Steve so in and out of it. Who was to say pain was something Steve actually liked, or if it was just a side effect of the drug?
Tony gasped, blinking into the dim of the room. It was immediately apparent what had woken him: the lights were down, blankets pooled loosely around his waist. He was still exhausted, still sore, and there was a light sheen of sweat covering his lower half. But he could hear something behind him, soft and wet and slick, and when Tony rolled over, he could see Steve curled on his side facing away from him, his hand furiously stroking up and down his dick.
-" Steve sucked at the tip of Tony's cock, at the fat, swollen head, swirled his tongue into the slit and under the crown. Steve moaned, sucked harder at him, and tightened his grip on Tony's shaft. Oh god, it hurt, almost, the intense pleasure burning through him, the hot, heavy sting of stimulation over his cock, rumbling in his belly and rising up behind his balls. "Oh, Steve, jesus, I'm gonna come-"
When Steve could stretch his fingers comfortably without feeling Tony's body clench immediately after, Steve moved for the lube again, his gut twisting hot and tight at the small sound Tony made when his fingers slipped out. "Shhh," he soothed, one hand sliding possessively over Tony's stomach, just barely missing his flushed, messy cockhead. His own cock was on fire, the now-familiar ache starting to build up in his belly; the whole damn thing was about to start again, and Steve bit back a curse at the tell-tale trembling he could feel spreading through his limbs.
"Darling, just admit you wanted to see my nubile naked body, and-" Steve shot him a dirty look and Tony coughed delicately, gauntlet clinking against his helmet at the gesture. "It's all on the outside of the armor anyway - I don't need to-"
"Glad to be... of service," Tony mumbled, fighting back a yawn. "'Love you, honey." Steve's breath hitched beside him, fingers tightening around Tony's middle. They needed to get up and clean themselves up before they got all tacky and disgusting, before Tony leaked all the come out of his ass onto the bed, but first‒
Steve, the tyrant, didn't seem content to let him snuggle. "Shower time, fella," he whispered, rubbing his thumb along the back of Tony's neck, and then he was helping a grumbling Tony to stand and make his way over to the shower.
"Mm, I'm not sure if I'm up for much at the moment," Tony admitted, letting himself be gently picked up and propped against the sink. Steve wet his toothbrush for him and squeezed a dab of paste on the brush.
Tony moaned, again and again, kneaded his fingers into the firm flesh of Steve's ass as he tried to swallow Steve's cock down even further, tried to tell him how okay it was for Steve to push it all the way when his mouth was already so full of him. Tony's own hips rolled, and he whined, lifted his head up just far enough that he could let his throat spasm around Steve's fat, dripping cockhead. Steve shouted, like it was punched out of him, and what was left of Steve's self-control melted into nothingness. He fucked his hips forward, driving his dick deep down Tony's throat, so quick and hard that Tony could barely even suck at him, couldn't do anything but lay back and enjoy the ride.
, Tony tried to say with his worshipping mouth, with his reverent hands and the curve of his submissive neck and his hot, aching, dripping cock.
"You want the clamps?" Steve asked, one hand stroking idly down his side and around to circle around a nipple.
-" It felt so intimate, the weight of Steve's pleasure heavy inside of him, spilling out of him and frothing over his groin and thighs, and if Tony kept it in long enough, it'd become a part of him. Maybe Tony would- would gain weight, look like he was pregnant with it, the way his stomach was ballooned outward.
"Don't stop," Tony moaned, sobbed almost, pressing his hot, slippery with sweat forehead to Steve's collarbone. "Don't stop,
"Nuh-uh, not a chance handsome," Tony murmured, crawling over Steve's side so he could tuck a leg under Steve's hip. It was a testament to how out of it Steve was, how much pain he must have been in that he let Tony do that: let Tony wrap his knees around Steve's ribs and roll him onto his back. Steve's hand didn't stop, but it did slow, his flushed, tear-stricken face staring blearily up at Tony.
"Mm, last I saw he was in the gym trying to run a marathon on that fancy treadmill you got him," Jan piped up, rolling a pencil back and forth across the table.
"It's okay, Steve," Tony soothed, working himself down, bending forward and collapsing onto his forearms. Tony knocked their foreheads together, rolled his face against Steve's. "I've got you, baby, it's okay, I've got you—" Steve surged forward and sealed their lips together, lube-slick hands wrapping tight around Tony's middle. He whimpered into the kiss, hips rolling up, fucking into Tony far slower than he needed to be. "Come on baby," Tony prodded, panting hot and against his lips. "C'mon, Steve— fuck me like you mean it sweetheart—"
, Tony was so embarrassed at how needy and desperate he must look to Steve. Steve, who could go for hours on end and barely break a sweat; but a little heavy petting on the couch and suddenly Tony was a virgin on prom night.
"Yeah," Steve confirmed as the words settled in his chest with a low rumble. "I'm so happy you said yes," he purred after a few more kisses, and Tony sighed against his lips.
," Tony gasped, feeling it build in his toes and sliding up into his knees and thighs. His legs were shaking. "Oh Steve, I'm so close‒" he whispered brokenly, biting back against a sob, and Steve just swirled his tongue faster, harder against Tony's dick, and Tony was coming, shaking apart under Steve, his groin throbbing and clenching and burning wet and warm, breath catching in his throat as he tried to remember what
"It's—" Tony's voice broke, and he shivered, shuddering as Steve thrust one last time in his oversensitive body before slowly pulling out, his cock leaving Tony's ass in one slow, sucking
"You mean the enema hose?" Steve asked, back in front of him again, and— Jesus, it was unnerving, sometimes, or unexpected, Tony thought, how fast he could move. It made sense, obviously (super soldier, and all that), but here, with naked and soft with Tony, it was easy to forget that Steve was actually a force to be reckoned with, and how- how fortunate it was that with all the power coiled in his bones, he still touched Tony so gently.
"Oh, that's perfect," Tony breathed, sucked a searing kiss to Steve's skin. "Just like that, baby. Get yourself all worked up for me. Are you gonna come?"
He knew the doctor was speaking, that Tony was dependent on him for the steps to come, that he should be taking notes and getting paperwork and aftercare instructions, but all he could think about was the half a building that had fallen on Tony and broken his leg in three places, fractured his hip, given him one hell of a shiner and a nasty concussion to boot. All Steve could look at was the plaster on Tony's leg, the cast on his arm, the stark rings of bruising around Tony's nose and eyes. He thanked the doctor very politely, then very firmly dismissed him from the room so he could frown down at Tony disapprovingly.
"There's a good boy," Steve crooned, thumb sliding messily along his slit. "Good boy, look at you - you're taking this like a champ, honey." Tony dropped, his nipples scorching as the chain and clamps dragged again the fabric of the cushion and he sobbed despite himself, because the machine
"Hey, hey, hey," Steve soothed, lifting up so he could stare down at Tony. "What's the matter? Tony?"
Tony moaned again, feeling his ass and gut clench, the small spurt of wetness that left him at that. "Oh sugar plum, that's what I like about it," he gasped, fighting the urge to writhe in Steve's arms. "But you're gonna get me all loose and wet‒ and, and ready for you, aren't you pumpkin?"
Something akin to contentment settled in under his skin. "It was absolutely my pleasure," Tony whispered softly. There was only so much bravado he could display, naked in bed with Steve though, so after a moment he murmured, "...Thank you, Steve."
Steve's fingers clenched against his ass, and then he was surging up, Tony's legs falling to the bed, and Steve was kissing Tony, needy and sloppy, whining softly against his lips. He pressed kiss after kiss to Tony's lips, hands cradling Tony's jaw so gently it made heat prickle behind Tony's eyes and emotion claw at the inside of his throat.
"N-no," Tony hiccuped, and then covered his face with his hand so he could cry some more. They weren't even quiet, subtle tears — no, these were body-racking sobs, and a raw, aching throat, snot dripping from his nose into his mustache and goatee.
. "I got you, I got you," Steve swore, pressing kisses along Tony's neck, his collarbone. Tony moaned, felt saliva pooling in his mouth as he panted into the sheets.
"Cap, I'd like you to go down to Medical," Tony started slowly, one hand very, very carefully reaching over to the emergency shut off for the treadmill.
"It— it's more than that," Tony whispered, his eyes falling to the side again. He screwed his eyes shut, a grimace twisting his lips. "I-I, I love you, and I-I'd do anything for you—" Tony sniffled and wiped at his nose. "And I'm nowhere good enough for you."
"Dealer's choice, my dear," Tony eventually sighed, and Steve was nodding, lifting Tony up into a sitting position and pulling the plug from the bottom of the tub.
The scheduled briefing time came and Tony sashayed his way downstairs to the conference room where Thor, Jan, and Clint were already waiting, but Steve was nowhere to be seen. Well. That certainly put a pause in Tony's step. Had they finished already? "Did Cap step out to get something?" he asked, popping another Zofran under his tongue.
Steve smiled and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Tony's lips. "You're so sweet right now, baby," he whispered. "So sweet and so, so under." Tony felt his cheeks heat despite himself and he squirmed, tilting his head to duck back against Steve's neck. Steve laughed, and hummed, and rolled his hips, his hot, wet cock bumping the back of Tony's balls, sliding up between his cheeks. "I know, I know, you don't like when I mention it," he teased, sucking a hot bruise to Tony's shoulder. Tony shuddered visibly and moaned, his hands coming up to grasp the shorter hairs at the back of Steve's head. The cuffs suddenly felt huge on his wrists and his ankles, heavy like they were weighing him down (weighing him down to
It's not a one-armed hug, though, and it's definitely not a bro-hug either. Bucky doesn't even put one arm over his shoulder; instead wraps both arms around Steve's waist and pulls him in like they're already lovers. Steve's heart kicks into overdrive and he wraps his arms around Bucky in turn, automatically turning his face into Bucky's neck.
"And the heart of a lion," Tony says. He's not rising to the bait. "I know. How can you not see - That is exactly why I'd want to make it special in the first place, Steve."
"Nope. Nope. It's good. Please don't offer. I want to - I want both of us one hundred percent on the same page when that happens, and right now is not. Not the time. So. Yeah. I'll, um. I'll see you later, okay?"
Everyone starts laughing again, and the other guy picks it up, his face going exaggeratedly surprised. "A phone number! Doth mine eyes deceive or did the bastard get a fucking phone number!"
That seems to knock Tony out of it. He shakes his head and smiles a little, ruefully, stepping forward and holding out his hand. "Hey, Bucky," he says.
"What would be the point of that?" the guy asks, giving his card to the barkeep. The barkeep, who doesn't even look at Steve's out held hand, like it's not even there. Oddly enough, with this stranger staring at him, Steve doesn't really mind being ignored by anyone else.
"Right!" Tony says. Steve almost jumps. "Right, okay, so that was you saying you're single, right? Okay. So. That was you, now this is me asking for your number."
It's dark by the time they leave. Tony says he's going to call a cab and it doesn't matter where from, so he might as well walk Steve home. Steve says he'd like to walk Tony instead, and Tony laughs and says it's too far to walk. Steve lets it go.
Steve flings himself across the room. Bucky laughs and drops his rucksack and catches him and the momentum sends them spinning, Steve's feet swinging off the floor.
"Polyamorous," Bucky says. Steve can't get a read on his tone. He opens his mouth to explain, but still blank-faced Bucky continues, "Like, open? Or with you guys as the primaries?"
"Steve," Tony says, putting a hand on his shoulder. Steve looks up and finds Tony pensive and serious. "Look. I don't know why, but other people say that what I'm about to tell you is super important, and it seems to work for them. Also it's the opposite of my usual modus operandi and nothing ever works out for me, so. Maybe they're on to something, right? So. I'd like to - go slow. If that's. Okay. I mean in order to go slow that means you actually have to want to see me again, which, yeah, kind of making assumptions here, and you know what they say about that -"
Bucky doesn't move for a moment and Steve thinks the connection froze, but then Bucky nods a bit and relaxes back in his chair. He smirks. "Something good happen, Stevie?"
"Pretty much," Bucky says, then asks Steve about baseball in the least-subtle conversation changer in history.
"Because I don't want you peeking," Steve says. Tony sighs, but obediently tips his chin up a bit more. Steve takes a deep breath - then another, because he's suddenly far more nervous than he was when he got this idea. A third deep breath, and he goes for it.
," Steve moaned, like he'd just gone one-vee-one with a tank, and Tony could hear the sharp rip of fabric beneath them, Steve's forearms trembling, his biceps bulging. "Tony, I- oh
—) ring of muscle and pressed the tip of the plug in it. "Like this?" Steve asked, and the bastard sounded amused, almost, even though there was no way he'd ever used a goddamned anal plug before—
Something hot and squirmy rolled in Tony's belly. He nodded, flushing a bit further, and turned on his side, pulled his knees up, let himself relax again. "M' all yours, handsome," he whispered, and then Steve's hand was on his tailbone, and the tip of the enema pipe was gently easing in. His body was still soft and loose, and Steve obviously knew it he was doing, because there wasn't even a pinch or any awkward movements from the soft silicone - just one quick, easy slide. This, Tony was very familiar with.
Okay, that was fair. Tony fought back the heat he felt crawling up his neck. "Okay, well then, why don't you just… take care of the issue, and then you can hit the gym again. Maybe- maybe lay off the punching bags though," Tony said, eyeing the bloody bandages on his knuckles. How fresh were they? How many times had he split open his skin while Tony was off getting stupid cancer advice? "Did you- I mean, have you tried the other thing Dr. Nguyen suggested? How- how long has this been an issue?" Tony asked gently.
Luckily, he'd only migrated back to the treadmill, but he was already sprinting, his arms pumping back and forth, his chest heaving. It was almost like he couldn't decided if he wanted to stare off into space or look at everything around him, his eyes alternating between a soft, glazed appearance and his pupils darting back and forth across the gym.
) to even now, how he talked to Steve, how he treated Steve, when he would touch Steve in the company of others. He was always so— so
"N-no," Steve gritted out, his fingers tapping a steady rhythm across his biceps. "No more sedatives."
"Don't be sorry," Steve said, trying to slow his kisses down even as the felt them getting hotter, more sensual in the way Tony's tongue traced his, and the leg trying to hitch itself over Steve's hip.. "You're injured, and I-I'm just makin' it worse, hell."
Tony was on the phone. There was a garbled, buzzing noise coming through the cell phone that Steve should really have been able to understand, but everything was so… so fuzzy, and not right, and Steve could barely tell which way was up, let alone what someone was saying eighteen inches away in a tiny electronic device.
"I got you, I got you baby," Steve told him, pressing deep down at the base of his cock. "You wanna come now or later? Or do you want me to decide?"
When Steve finally pulled his cock out, come spilled out, over his tongue and out his mouth, and Tony sputtered and coughed and gasped and dear God, Tony had never felt so turned on in his life. Tony moaned, squeezing his eyes shut as he rolled on his side, licking the come from his lips and panting and pressing the heel of his hand against his cock.
Steve blinked, heat prickling behind his eyes, and shook his head, trying to keep the sudden rush of emotion at bay. He fell to the chair beside Tony and grabbed for his uninjured hand, rubbed his thumbs across Tony's scuffed and freshly scrubbed knuckles. "Hell, Tony, of course I'm gonna worry about you. You scared the hell out of me today," Steve said; and he really had - the way the armor had dented in with a ridiculous, sickening
So he starts taking the stairs (even though it makes him pant for ten minutes after) and avoids the sandwich shop like the plague (even though that means he has to start cooking his lunches the night before). All in all, he does reasonably well.
A little while later - or maybe hours later, or maybe only seconds, who even knows - Tony stops kissing him, takes a deep breath, and pulls away a bit.
And then one of the guys sitting across from Tony raises his arms and says, "Hold up, hold up, hold up! Deets or it didn't happen, Tony."
Then Tony takes a deep breath, holds it, lets it out, and says, "Steve. Is this about what happened earlier?"
"What's your point?" Steve asks, because he's pretty sure Tony has one, and he's pretty sure it's NOT calling attention to the gaping chasm between their relative experience levels.
"Oh," Tony says, and wow, he really does like Steve. The droop Tony's shoulders have going on is impressive.
It's not - he's not sure if he's upset or not. Jealous that Bucky told Tony and not him, maybe? Weirded out that Bucky would have told Tony something important and kept it from Steve? Weirded out by how not at all upset or jealous he is? Or maybe -
it. How could Bucky leave him and go so far away? How could Bucky not be here when Steve needs him; how could Bucky be so far away that it's hard to explain
"Both, I guess," Bucky admits with a laugh. "I had no idea either of you were in the market for a third."
They laugh and talk and it's - it's - Well. Bucky has to go shortly after that, which is a shame, because actually it's -
"Meh," says Bucky, waving a hand at him through the screen from the other side of the world, "tell me anyway. If we get interrupted I'll just see if I can guess the end before next week."
"You have, um," Tony says, apparently unable to stop himself from running his lips over Steve's forehead, even as he tries to actually say something. "You have your phone call."
Bucky, though, Bucky looks fit to murder someone. Steve's not even done with what he heard when Bucky holds up his hand and says, "I'm gonna have to stop you there, Steve. Gotta tell my CO I'm deserting so I can go choke a couple'a bitches back in the States. I'll see you in a day or two."
"Now wait just a minute," Steve says, finally giving up on wrapping his head around the entire situation and focusing on the immediate future. "No one is going anywhere."
Steve just sighs and moves his hand. With Bucky still overseas, he's starting to take his talks about being careful while he's gone more seriously. Not because Steve thinks he needs to be more careful, or because he doesn't know how he'll get out of fights without Bucky beside him, but because now that Bucky's in constant danger he's got a bit more empathy.
"Yeah," says Tony. "Signif. Short for significant, shorter for significant other. S.O. Main squeeze. Your bae, your boo, partner, live-in ordinary person, lover, spouse -"
) he gets home. Not ever. Because -) Again, though, because he has to think about things like this now, he knows he has to tell the story through to the end the first time. He can't stop halfway through and leave Bucky thinking Tony's a terrible person. So their next Skype call, after their general catching-up, Steve says, "I have a story to tell you, but it's really, really long, so if we don't have another half an hour at least I'm not going to even start it."
"Oh," Tony says. "I, um. I sent you more than that. Is, uh, is your phone not working? Or maybe mine's not. It's, I mean, a hunk of shit, of course, let, um, let me text you again and see if it works -"
more. And there's not - No consequences, okay? Neither Steve nor I will ever bring this up again. Ball's in your court, Bucky. If you don't want anything to change, it won't. This isn't an ultimatum. We just - I have feelings for you, all right? And I want to be with you. But the reason I want that is because I like you, and that's sure as hell not going to just go away if you don't want any part of this, okay?"
