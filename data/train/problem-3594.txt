I reveal what Jack has done. About how he brought back Gabriel, Meg and Crowley. Dean comments about how maybe its time we give them a chance, seeing as Chuck is no longer writing the story.
“I was at a bar earlier.” I tell him “And that got me thinking, about us. Dean, when I told you I loved you, I knew there was no-one I would rather spend my life with.”
“I’m...I’m going to see if my Mother needs help with running Hell. See if we can’t keep an eye on things down there. I don’t know how she’ll react, but its a start.”
We follow Dean’s voice and enter a room. The place has long been abandoned, but there are images of us all. Of Dean and Cas and that stops Cas in his tracks.
I know I shouldn’t be dreaming of this possibility, but knowing that I’m not alone in feeling this way makes me feel so much better.
I don’t even register what he said till a few minutes after he’s said it and the nurse tells us that somebody will be out to see us soon.
I walk forwards and am grabbed, being sent flying backwards against a pole. I hear Cas calling my name, but its too late. I can feel the poison working and Cas swings at the Djinn who disappears.
Bobby pulls me to one side and we sit by the map room. Looking around, I realise that this is where all the best memories I have are here.
“Dean, what did they try and take from you anyway?” I ask him, putting the phone away as I drive to the hospital.
It was nearing midnight. Dean and I had had a wonderful date night and had spent the rest of the night at a bar with a few friends.
I wipe away his tears, leaning back against my seat. My hand finds his as I rest the other on the steering wheel.
“Dean.” I choke on my own words as I apply pressure to the wound. “I’m so sorry. I should have seen them coming -”
“Everything is going to be alright. I’m here and I’m not going away.” I reassure him. “You’ll always have me.”
I don’t know why I feel so conflicted. I’m dealing two lovesick idiots, Cas and my brother,  and Jack is in the crossfire.
Dean has been counting down the days for Cas to come home. Jack said he only needed him for a few days, but something obviously went down.
Sam, Bobby and Eileen moved into their own home, leaving me and Dean to have the old place to ourselves. We had Miracle.
I told Sam what I was planning to ask Dean tonight and he smiled and told me it was about time and he wished me luck, going off to tell Eileen.
Every moment I spend here, is another moment wishing what was coming would be true. It can be...but I can’t help but enjoy these moments.
Jack took them to Heaven as a last resort to keep them safe. I don’t know why they didn’t look there, but it is obvious they were after Cas, Sam and I.
“I knew you’d say that, Dean. But, I have something to tell you. When Cas made that switch,  his powers were already failing, as you know. He’s still alive, but when I tried to free him, it came at a cost.”
We touch our foreheads together, taking in the relief of seeing each other again. Both of us not knowing what to say. And then, I do.
Dean talks about his feelings, talks about how much Cas means to him and how he wanted to get him out the Empty.
Eileen falls pregnant a month after that, and we discover we’re having a boy so we decide to name them after Bobby.
I’ve been hiding out here. I cannot see what he’s up to anymore.  I can only hear his cries at night and it scares me to think what state he will be in, if I return.
“Cas, I love you. A-and I always will. I never said it back because I didn’t know how to say it back. All those things you said, I never thought I was worth it.”
The ring has a small symbol on it – of angel wings, and I’m blinded by my own tears. The angel wings are made out of diamonds, and I really don’t want to find out how Dean could afford this.
I’ve never seen my brother so vulnerable. Well, I have… but nothing like this. I haven’t seen so much hope in his eyes before
“But he needs to stay in hospital for a few days. We’ve done what we can. You’re lucky you got him here in time.”
A few months pass and I find a final case for us. I tell Sammy that I’m heading out to check it out, and he asks me if I want to take Cas, and I say yes.
Apparently Jack researched how to do weddings and seeing as he’s God now, he technically has the power to oversee the marriage?
I move to get down on one knee. Dean turns to face me out of curiosity and is stunned into silence. I can see his lip quiver as he’s emotional.
After a few short moments where I linger because I don’t want to pull away, I have to and pull Cas down the aisle.
Dean nods and holds out his hand and I slip on the ring and pull him close. Dean then pulls out a ring.
Bobby takes a sip of his beer and I see papers on the map table that tell me the wedding is going to be held at the Roadhouse, which Jack has restored?
Over the next few months, Cas, Dean and I turn the bunker into official headquarters for hunters around the world, and we semi-retire.
That date arrives. Jack decides to save us some hassle by officiating the wedding himself after learning how to do so.
I thought they might be Vampires, but they weren’t. A few stray Demons, nothing more and nothing less.
“I’m getting married to an ex-Angel, and somehow we’ve managed to get all our supernatural friends who are still alive, and Jack has got all our loved ones together to behave under one roof, and you’re asking if I’m nervous? I’m god damn terrified.”
Cas tells Dean that he’s human. That he can age and live alongside us, now that he’s human. If Dean wants him in his life.
Sam pats me on the shoulder and goes off to find Eileen who is outside probably, though I didn’t see her.
I know he hates sounding like a chick flick, but what he says is true. I place the box with a ring into his hand.
‘Dad’. It just feels so right. I love Jack and I love what we’ve done for this world and for Heaven and I want so much more. I want a life with Dean.4
I’ve had my fair share of dealing with the Djinns but it still hurts like a bitch every time. I hate it when things take advantage of me, exploiting my weaknesses...making me feel vulnerable.
Cas tells me to shut up and he kisses me, leaning into the kiss. I take my hand off the steering wheel and cup his face.
There are pictures, projections of images that the press have taken of sightings of Cas, of Dean and Me.
“No!” Dean yells and in one swift movement he stabs the fake me, a weapon appearing from nowhere. He then hesitates, before turning the weapon on himself as I try to reach him, the Empty grabs him.
It’s him coming to terms with who he is, through everything that has happened. He’s learning to let down his walls and let people in.
“This is what could be real, Dean. If you wanted it to be. I know I’m not alone in wishing what you see, was real. But you know what this is. It’s just a dream.” I say.
“We were walking to the car after our date when the demons attacked. I thought they were all gone, Dean pushed me out the way and got stabbed. I couldn’t heal him.”
“You’re not. And I’m sure I’ll see you soon, brother. I’ll let Dean and the others know of your plans.”
“I know you understand.” Dean looks around. “Everything you see before you? It’s all we could find on what’s been recorded of us. Nobody can find anything on you, but Sam and I? They know everything…I know.. I know I’ve done some bad shit and I know I’ve treated you like shit, but you...you mean the world to me, Cas.”
I may be more human than Angel now, and I love being what I am. But I also hate it sometimes. I’m at breaking point.
Claire comes over to talk to me and says she’s proud of me, and hugs me. I hug her back and Jody is seen laughing with Bobby.
In my dreams, I’ve gone over what I could say to make it up to Cas for everything he’s ever done, and it always comes down to one thing. One thing he will find out about if he enters the dream.
It’s Christmas time. Specifically the third of December, And I’ve been planning something for a long while, I think I should give Dean his present early.
“The guy recognised my face. From somewhere, I don’t know. Started taunting me, saying he was gonna come for the people I love… and I just… Cas, I got so damn scared.”
“Dean, you’re describing asexuality. Cas might be asexual. And even if he is, you love him for who he is and that’s what matters. Look at how far the both of you have come.”
Part of me wants to get a gun or a knife or something and the other part of me is telling me not to because its my brain telling me something is wrong.
Becoming mortal made me realise I’m not comfortable with most things anymore. How can I protect the ones I love when I’m mortal?
Not only have they tried to ruin my brother and my sister-in-law’s wedding, but they messed with me.
I have no Angels, Demons or Gods feeding me lies, telling me that Dean isn’t worth it. That my feelings aren’t real and I will never be anything more than a failure.
“Eileen. You are my life, you are the reason I work so hard, to protect you. To protect everything we have. I’m ready to start this next chapter in our lives and I’m ready for what the future brings.”
The room is dark and I turn on the main light. I see my tuxedo is hanging up in a corner and I check the time – its 9am. We have time.
“Cas struck a deal with Jack; one day in Heaven with the ones you love for your wedding day. Sam, Eileen, Claire, Jody and everybody are here too but you’ll all be taken back to Earth before midnight because otherwise you’re all stuck here for good.” Bobby grins, passing me a beer and I have a small sip to calm my nerves.
“The last time I had a full fledged dream with that thing, I discovered the only way to get out of it...is to kill myself. You’ll have to do that too in order to get out. The thing is invisible unless it shows itself to us. It won’t go down without a fight and we’re going to need the antidote.”
Cas smirks, disappearing and reappearing a moment later with the antidote. He says he’ll keep it on him.
With work slowing down due to the fact Jack is tying to change how things work in Hell and Heaven and everywhere in-between, he’s been trying to help us.
Ellen and Jo look so happy, as does Charlie...and it feels right. It feels like my family is right where I want them.
Dean calls Sam to tell him what is happening who agrees to help and after getting the baby some supplies, we meet up back at our house.
I love him. I love Dean Winchester and I love my family, we are a family… but what if I’ve ruined our chances?
“They must have gotten angry when we pulled him out The Empty. They must have been biding their time… it’s been what, almost two years?” Sam yells.
There were people who have been chained up – they are long dead now. No survivors.  But the air is cold, and I know that the thing that did this is still around. I look around and walk forwards some more and all I can feel is sadness that we were too late.
But I’m proud of us. I’m proud of what we are and I don’t care. I will fight for us and my family. Our family.
“He isn’t your Castiel if he’s not wearing a suit.” I say jokingly, turning serious. “He’s always looked good in one.”
I’m in bed when I hear a door fly open. Eileen stays asleep, but I grab a gun. Dean is closer to the noise.
Dean thought of an idea where he’ll confess his love for Cas, right under the stars, whilst showing Cas pictures and footage of every case we’ve ever worked on. I will lead Cas to an abandoned cinema where we will watch a movie.
Jack addresses the congregation – its clear that he has had practice from what Cas has taught him and he’s very professional with how he approaches the whole thing.
I find Dean getting ready; nervously doing up the buttons of his tuxedo and I want to reach out and help him but I don’t want him to know I’m here just yet.
I have so many questions and I know I’m going to need to find out the answers. More demons come from all sides and Jack comes back after getting everyone to safety, to even the odds.
Jack is hopping between Heaven and Earth because as I did point out, if Chuck could spend time on Earth and he was God, then so can my son even though he is the new God trying to make Heaven a better place.
I feel bad for the things I’ve done in my past, with Claire even though we’ve patched things up. I’ve raised Jack as best as I can and he’s still our son.
I knew something wasn’t right when I got to the Bunker. Jack was standing there, and so was Jody and Claire who are very much alive...but Charlie, Kevin, Ellen, Bobby and Jo and most of our dead friends were standing in the bunker.
“There are fresh scars up and down his arms, Cas. I had to clean him up. Its why I summoned Jack. There is only so much I can do. When Jack told us that you were out of the Empty, but you never even came to say goodbye or say hi… that broke him. Why didn’t you come home?” I ask, voice breaking.
“That’s why I brought you here, Cas. I feel the same way. I know I should have said something, I just… I didn’t know what else to say besides the fact I love you too”
The snow comes down faster and we get a call from Sam.  It’s a good thing we stocked up on things because we know all traffic will be stuck outside. I notice somebody walking through the blizzard.
I spend most of the ride home with Dean talking over what we want to do and where we go from here, because of course now we’ve finished the case, we can finally retire.
His eyes sparkle as he looks at me with adoration. I know he’s wearing my shirt. I see a few streaks of silver hair coming through; where Cas has aged his vessel to be with me.
“Everything you ever did, Cas, you did for love. You said I did it for love but I think those words could mean the same to you too.”
The Empty opens up the portal and I smile, knowing now that it can take me. I’m happy to go, knowing he loves me too.
Sam passes me a close up picture of the jacket with the bloody handprint on, when I confessed to Dean that I loved him.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas laughs nervously, looking at him like he hasn’t seen Dean in years. “We have so much to talk about.”
The light grows warm and inviting and I feel at ease. I find myself walking further and further and as I do, the light grows dimmer until I arrive at my destination.
We have to sign a few documents to make it look official, but I can’t help but smile when I notice what Cas puts down as we get into the Roadhouse, followed by the others.
I’m starting to get a little nervous and Sam can see that, pulling me into a hug and giving me a quick squeeze before Eileen fixes my tie and straightens my tuxedo, fixing the creases.
Sam helps me try and track down the mother but we cannot find anything – but somebody will be out to talk to us in the morning about what happened.
“You remember how I told you my powers were failing? I think I know now, why. It’s a punishment for realising I can’t have what I want. Happiness. I’ve ben trying to protect the people I love for so long, that I’ve changed the ways the rules work. I’ve done the impossible, for you, Dean. If my powers are failing, so be it. But it’s not going to change how I feel about you. I didn’t know what it was like, I kept pushing the feelings away because I thought it was wrong. Angels aren’t supposed to love. But… I love you,”
Jack and I fought to keep The Empty under control. No more Demons ever came out. The Empty was now...Empty.
It’s been months since Cas went away. There are bottles of alcohol, smashed and intact littered around his room.
Charlie and a few of our friends made the outside clearing into a respectable place for a wedding, and it looks beautiful.
I know we’ll find Cas, or Cas will come to us. He’s helping Jack rebuild Heaven, but a hello every now and then, would be nice.
The plan is to make it look like there has been a fight, and I’ll be the one to lead Cas on a fake trial, to a spot where Dean will be.
I’ve been to the ends of the Earth for this man, I’ve done so much to prove myself to him, to others who said so much about all of us.
Jack becomes the new God. After everything that he’s been through, he promises to make the world a better place, and Dean takes the chance to ask him to reform how things work.
“And you’ve done so much for me, Cas. Everything you did, was because I never saw myself as good enough and you fell in love with me. And I could say so much about us, what we’ve done, what we’re going to do. I know I’ll never make it up to you, but this is a good start.” I say, turning to pull him into a kiss.
“I knew you were planning something. Sammy found it when we were looking for ways to find the Demons. I was worried about you.”
There are pictures of us throughout the years on the walls. Pictures of me, Cas, Sam, Gabriel, Jack, Eileen, Charlie, Rowena, Crowley, Bobby, Ash, Jo, Ellen, Benny, Meg and everybody who we ever considered a friend.
Jack knows how happy Dean makes me and he knows how happy I make Dean and he asks for a description of the ring.
Amongst them are practices of ways I could tell Cas how I feel. Many different thoughts of how broken I’ve been without him and how much I need him. None of them seem right. None of them feel like they come from the heart.
He’s been helping Eileen in the kitchen, baking pies and stuff whilst I’ve been handling official business. We’re turning the bunker into headquarters for other hunters. All of us are retiring. That is the plan.
“Oh, Dean.” I sit down, the box being exchanged hands and Dean struggles to fight back his own tears.
Eileen and I start planning to move into our own place and Dean and Cas can have our place to themselves.
Though I lost my wings, I am still able to travel through Heaven because I’m helping Jack keep everything in line
“We do. Now, listen. You said so much and you’ve done so much for me. For Sam, for Jack... And the thing is, I didn’t realise Angels could feel. I didn’t react because I knew you were telling the truth and I knew what it meant.”
“You won’t. On the plus side, you’ve stopped doing stupid shit and getting into dangerous situations, so Cas doesn’t have to worry about you.”
We had a scare when Dean got impaled on a rusty nail in a barn by some vampires, but Cas beat the shit out of them.
We both look at each other, lost for words. We’ve said so much to each other over the years and yet I feel like there is so much left to say.
Cas and Dean made the whole thing into a business, though. There is a whole team of us who deal with supernatural beings.
In the real world, I have a stack of papers that have all the ways to research getting Cas from the Empty.
I’ve been searching for thousands of years to find myself, and I truly believe this is where my heart has lead me to.
I see a note on the bed telling me to get ready. The note is in Cas’ handwriting so I know he’s alright.
“I don’ know if this is gonna work, Sammy. I don’t want to screw it up. All my life, I’ve been searching for answers. For what happened to Mom, to where I belong. I know that I was put on this path for a reason. And all this time I’ve been questioning who I am.” Dean scratches at his arm nervously.
Eileen is still upstairs asleep, we’ve gotten up early and we’ve been planning what to do, now that we’ve come to a realisation that we don’t want to hunt anymore.
“I know.” Cas’ facial expressions change in an instant as he whispers. “But it won’t be real. You know that, Dean.”
“I tried things. Things I regret in order to try and forget how I feel because I didn’t know it was right. I kept on fighting my demons, and the real ones we faced because I knew we could make a better place. And I realised, even after all this time, that everything I ever have done, everything we ever did… was pointing me in a direction. Everything lead me back to you. It’s always been you, Cas. And… And I promised myself I would take the time to get to a good place, to know what to do next, and here we are.”
I open the door and find my brother fiddling with a tie. He’s not really the type of guy to wear suits. His hands are shaking and he looks like he hasn’t slept.
This makes me even more nervous. They don’t seem hurt and I can’t seem to find any sign of the vampires.
“You know, you can live on Earth if you want to. You can keep your powers and everything so you can come visit me whenever you want.”
The next morning we deal with the respective authorities about our little girl. The mother abandoned her because she couldn’t care for her, which makes me a little sad because she must have been so scared when she left Grace where she did.
My mind goes back to when we first met, and I take the journey through our memories to get to where we are now.
This song knows exactly how I feel. I’ve had wives before, but never really understood what love feels like.
“You’ve always looked out for me.” she signs. “And knowing that, there is no-one  else I would rather spend my life with. My future is our future. I’m more than ready to be a Winchester,”
Cas gets hugged by Claire and Jody and all the others surround us, congratulating us and Ash starts handing out beers whilst heading over to his station to start the music up again.
So many memories, the good and the bad and we all have some regrets and some things I know I wouldn’t change because everything that has happened, has brought us closer and has brought us to where we are now.
I see Sam and Eileen dancing slowly and Charlie is dancing with another guest. We dance, and my eyes never leave my husband.
Dean goes through Hell and back to prove his worth. He doesn’t care what anyone thinks, he just wants Cas back.
I knock on the door to Dean’s room. I’m in my suit, already and Charlie is attending to Eileen in another part of the house.
“The Empty didn’t just take you because of your confession. It took you because it knew how I felt in return. How I’ve always felt.”
“Dean, you can relax now. You have everything you ever wanted and you got what you deserve after so many years of fighting.” Bobby laughs, a genuine hearty laugh and its like nothing I’ve ever heard.
A ring. A black band with two diamonds made to look like angel wings. It looks like my grace. It looks like he’s captured what my grace looks like.
“For someone who struggles with words, you sure do know how to say things right when it comes down to it.”
Jack is able to guarantee that Cas and Dean will become Angels when they die. As a reward for all they’ve done. I turn that offer down.
Dean pulled through, despite all this and Dean promised Cas he would retire from hunting supernatural beings.
“I wanted you to have this. In case you ever caught short without any other weapon. I know with what happened at the wedding, that anything could happen and…”
“Dean is fine, but I need you to follow the co-ordinates I’m sending you to get here as fast as you can.”
I was afraid. Afraid I was going to die and I’d accepted that he may never feel the same way about me.
He doesn’t get much sleep. I hear him talk about what he plans to say to Cas when he finally gets the chance to.
A few fallen angels escaped The Empty when Jack pulled me out. We managed to track them down and stop them from hurting anybody. But they were too close to home for my liking and I’d never forgive myself.
We go over a plan. Its just like old times...possibly for the final time before I retire. Before Sammy finally gets what we’ve always dreamt of. The impossible.
I look through all the evidence that has been collected over the years of people who have been considered crazy for what they’ve seen regarding us.
“Of course she would be. You’ve been through hell and back for everyone around you… For Cas. You deserve happiness, Dean. And I’m glad I get to be a part of your life.”
Months pass, we get a house and turn the Bunker into a place for other Hunters to use. Eileen and Sam get their own house not far from us and it truly feels like we’re all fitting in where we belong.
“I love you, Cas. I always have and I always will and I will fight to protect you.” Dean smiles through his tears,
“You know, Dean. We’ve always talked about what could be ours, what we want to happen. We’ve been rebelling against what Chuck...what Father wanted, and now we get to write our own story. And… I think I know where to start.”
Jack offers, and heals our wounds, but can do nothing about the blood. Jack goes to check everyone is alright, and we are left to look at all the destruction.
When Jack started restoring Heaven, it restored power to the Angels and the Angels in the Empty grew restless, wanting out.
Jack tells us that once the day is up, all the souls here will return to Heaven, and to make the most of things.
We’d followed the trail that had been left open for us – police thought the victims had run away and then most of who they had sent to investigate had disappeared around the barn area.
We both laugh and I tell Bobby I have no intention of ever telling John Winchester. I have every intention of keeping Dean away from John Winchester when its time to pass over into Heaven.
It’s been almost a year since that time. Dean and Sam dealt with a few things and  Dean told me he doesn’t think he wants to be a Hunter any more.
Cas' eyes flood with tears. Dean has to move closer to him, still holding his hand but draping an arm around his shoulders. "I want to live, Dean. I want to
"I don't want us to be the kind of people who don't talk about things, Cas. I know we are those people, or, we have been. But I want better for us."
Cas made this place, perfectly, for him. Of course he did. Because Cas knows him, like no one ever has, and because Cas loves him. Cas loves
"I wanted to belong somewhere," Cas says, steepling his fingers against the table like he doesn't know what to do with his hands.
The Empty is the exact void Dean has envisioned every time Cas told him about it, roaring in its silence and blinding in the darkness that is all around. Every step is uncertain as much as it is steady. Every noise imagined as sure as it is not. The fluttering of his heart reminds Dean he is living and breathing here, though it helps to press his hand to his chest to be sure.
He's his. Cas is his. Dean repeats it over and over in his thoughts, adjusting to the idea that he finally gets what he wants. He drops his head forward to rest against Cas' knowing a peace he hasn't ever dreamed would be his. Everything is just perfect now. "So, uh. Maybe you can show me around this place, huh? Show me what you've done," Dean says, and after he's cleared his throat adamant he's shed enough tears, ducks just enough to brush his lips over Cas' cheek.
"Then, let's go." Dean nods towards the Impala, and because he is free now to be everything he's ever wanted to be, does the chivalrous thing of taking Cas' hand and leading him to the passenger door.
Dean knows the answer. Dean knows that the only way to make all of this okay, to fix things for good this time, is all on him. He has to be the one to do this, because if he doesn't, how will Cas ever know how much he needs him around?
What can Dean say to that? There is only truth to Sam's words. The bunker will forever be a home for them, but it won't be the only one they'll ever know. His and Sam's next homes won't even be ones that they share.
After, there is nothing. An endless expanse of emptiness. All his senses are on alert, but for what? There isn't anything here. Dean moves anyway; walking, crawling, gliding, whatever it is he's doing. He's heard so many stories about following the light, but there is none. He's not hellbound, or in purgatory, has seen both places enough times before to know neither of them are here. So what's left? Nothingness. Is that all he gets after everything?
"If we could both take back all of the ways we have hurt one another, perhaps we wouldn't even be here now," Cas points out. He's giving him the easy way out of this, and Dean wants to argue. Though why does he even want to spend a second arguing with Cas?
"C'mon, Cas. There has to be all kinds of places you'd prefer to be than in here, right? Any place you wanna go, we'll go, okay? Even if it means flying. Or, how about this? You, me, Baby, the open road. Sam and Eileen could come too, obviously, but honestly, Cas? I think they need some alone time. They deserve some alone time, after everything, and you know what? So do we. Some quiet. Damn; a real, honest, easy day.
"Hey, Cas," he says, sitting up and back-handing away his tears, though refusing to let go of his hand.
"That, I love you too. That, I have loved you, for a long time; I just didn't let myself really feel it."
It's worth it. All of this is worth it, however long this takes, and however hard getting Cas out of here is going to be. Every moment Dean knows despair at getting nowhere he reminds himself of all the things Cas deserves, and all the things he wants for himself. They're having their happy ending. Screw everything else. Screw anyone and anything who has ever stood in their way, for anything.
"And when I made you leave the bunker that time," Dean adds, swallowing back a fresh taste of bitterness for remembering. There are many things that keep Dean awake at night, or his mind racing throughout the day. That one stands out clearly, no matter how many years have passed.
Of course he's fidgety. Everything is wrong. Dean turns his head, doesn't need to do so much as raise an eyebrow. Sam knows it without him having to say a word out loud. He nods, determination fixing on his face, adjusting in his seat as best he can.
"No. You don't, Cas," Dean says, gripping on to him harder. "You don't. I mourned you. I buried you. Hell, I lost myself when I was sure you weren't ever coming back. So many times. And I argued with you, over everything, because it's easier, right? For me, anyway. Getting angry all the time?"
"I meant, do you need me to leave the library, be out of your eyeline, perhaps face the other way, so you can say what you need to out loud? You always spoke far more clearly in your prayers than face to face."
He's here. Cas. Dean drops to his knees beside him even though he can't see, knowing without question that he's finally found him. The moment he lays his hand on Cas' chest, everything in Dean knows peace and certainty. And he can
Cas, at his most stubborn and ornery, is one of Dean's favorite things about him. He shouldn't be smiling like he is, this is not the moment for it. Or maybe it's just the moment for it.
The moment Cas nods Dean is up across the room finding Cas sweatpants and a soft long-sleeved t-shirt to wear. He pulls out socks and a pair of boxers, startling when he turns to find Cas stood right beside him.
"Yeah," he says, with a brush of his lips over Cas' that is like lightning, making everything in him more alive than he has ever known. "Yeah. I do."
Cas groans as he pushes himself upright, hair in every direction. Why is that such a beautiful thing to see? Dean watches as he unbuttons his shirt thinking that he needs to sort him out some clothes, relieved that there is only a light scar as visible reminder of where he pulled his grace from.
Of course Cas is looking him in the eye. When hasn't he trapped Dean just by staring at him? "I knew there was no possibility of you returning it."
Dean closes his eyes, releases his grip on one lapel to cradle Cas' face. Stubble against the heel of his hand is grounding, and terrifying. Cas has to know. He has to tell him. There is no other way for them to be now.
"Wasn't suggesting you didn't." Dean's throat doesn't dry out at all for what he's picturing. Not at all. "I just... you know how Sam gets when you use his shampoo."
I prayed to you. Just in case you could still hear me in there. Couldn't you? Even when you were out here?"
He just needs him to wake up. How long Cas might need to recover from removing his grace Dean doesn't know. But he'll be here for it, however long he needs to wait. He's left only long enough for the bathroom and some water, not wanting Cas to wake up alone. From this chair and with one eye on the bed, Dean has texted Sam to find out why they came back to an empty bunker. That Sam and Eileen are off somewhere starting their own adventure seems fitting, and also gives Dean reassurance that his and Cas' conversation won't be overheard. Whenever they get to have it. Dean has to ignore the urge he has to wake him, impatient for the next part of their lives to get started. They'll get there. They'll get everything. He just needs to learn a little patience.
I heard the conversations. I know what is happening and Dean...he looks so happy. I can feel tears falling down my face.
Charlie grabs her and I swear to God that I see fear in Eileen’s eyes that I never want to see ever again.
I start signing for Eileen when Jack starts talking and Eileen and I are the first to recite our vows.
And when we get married a few months later, I know I’d have those chck flck moments any time over the pain and heartbreak we’ve seen.
Time seems to stand still as Eileen leaves and I’m left to walk myself out as everybody has got things ready.
“I have waited thousands of years just to feel what I’m feeling now. It’s incredible, Dean. Everything has been worth it.” I tell him honestly.
“Dean.” I say slowly. “If they’re going to interview us about keeping her, you may need to hide all our weapons and stuff.”
“Jack wanted to see me, and I went to see Bobby, Jo and Ellen.” I say, which is technically the truth.
Dean and Sam are out of town at the moment, dealing with a bunch of vampires related to the case where Dean got impaled on a rusty nail. They want to see that
I wake up with a start to find the bed empty. There is a longing in my heart for who should be there but I know he is getting ready.
I was going to take Eileen out tonight, but Dean had been preparing for this moment for about six months and I wanted to help him.
The authorities say the baby can stay with us as we process all the official paperwork. About 2 months later, she’s officially ours.
I want to tell him how I feel, but I don’t know how. I don’t know how to tell him that I want him to stay in my life, because he’s the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Jack interrupts the conversation saying he has work to do elsewhere, but wishes me well and we all part ways, I watch them all disappear.
They spend the next twenty minutes in each other’s embrace on the couch. Both enjoying each other’s company.
“Dean, if it touches you and you hallucinate, I’ll find you in that dream. I swear.” Cas says, hand over mine.
Sam puts his phone away and I’m watching Dean, love in my heart and clearly in my facial expressions.
And then it hits me, why he’s saying all this stuff. It’s not just a love confession. It’s not just Dean Winchester admitting he loves me.
“Dean, you already know how I feel. I’ve said more than enough, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life, and beyond that, with you.” Cas replies.
Cas is still able to travel to and from Heaven because Jack needs his help, despite him losing his wings.
I go out to meet Cas. Charlie steers me away from seeing Eileen because she believes in the whole bad luck thing.
Sam leaves to give us some space and says he’ll call in the morning and we thank him for everything he’s done.
I’d been trying to get him to talk to me. He didn’t seem like he was handling thongs well, after Jack told him Cas was in Heaven after escaping the Empty.
I want to make my own vows, to show Cas how much I care but I’m not good at speeches and I feel like nothing will be good enough for him.
We’re standing in the kitchen, Sam is having a beer and texting Eileen who is at home because she’s currently six months pregnant and should be asleep at their house but asked for updates.
“I know how you see yourself, Dean. I know it. But please, don’t do this again. Don’t hurt yourself again.”
I start preparing a bottle for the baby from what we’ve managed to gather in resources in a short amount of time.
I thought we were in the clear about this sort of stuff but I guess we were wrong. My mind goes to Sam and Eileen and I wonder if they’re safe, if these cowards have gone for them too but it seems like they’re after us. We can always find out later.
He thought this idea up. We’d told Cas and Eileen that we were going after some vampires connected to the ones that almost killed Dean, but there were no vampires.
According to Bobby, Cas managed to get Crowley, Meg, Gabriel and a few others out of  the Empty and they’ve promised to be on their best behaviour and will be attending the wedding.
I turn my head to see Cas – he’s not wearing his trenchcoat. He’s in a blue flannel shirt and trousers and he looks so god damn good.
I know Claire will probably see her parents before the day is out too, Jack will let her. I know he will.
Dean is trying to sit up and he fumbles in his jacket for something which I soon see are the keys to the impala and I carry him over, practically ripping the passenger seat door off its hinge.
The house is still standing, which is amazing, given the amount of times that some supernatural being has passed through here.
“Cas is on his way. Knowing him, he’s probably breaking the speed limit. Lets get our plan into action.”
He’s been so angry with the way things have been and he doesn’t know how to cope, so he took it out on himself. I can see the scars up his arms.
Sam comes forward with the rings and both Cas and I exchange the rings, waiting for the cue on Jack and he smirks, nodding.
We take each other’s hands as people clear out a space for us to dance and we slow dance, all eyes on us.
Thinking about how far I’ve come, how I’ve changed. I know I regret some of my decisions, but its all led to this….to finding where I belong. To find Dean Winchester.
Dean explains his regret, how his ‘Don’t do this, Cas’ meant he couldn’t face what was coming – how he knew what it meant and he couldn’t enjoy it because I was taken away.
He wanted to maybe go to a bar or something, but didn’t want to in the end, as he wanted to remember this moment.
I finish what I’m doing and help Sam hide everything in a safe spot where I know the authorities won’t look.
“Dean. I could write a thousand words but none would ever capture how I truly feel about you. We’ve been through it all and you know it started when I raised you from Hell. I don’t regret it and I’m here to pledge myself to you, Dean Winchester. Until the end of time.”
“You have to promise me that you’ll stop destroying yourself. We can get you help, and I’ll be home before you know it.” Cas’ voice is soft and gentle.
I look up from where my eyes have wandered and meet Dean’s eyes, he’s groggy and disorientated but very much alive.
I check on Dean and he’s sleeping peacefully so I let him sleep. I know this is all a dream, but I want to see how it all plays out.
I get up for a few moments, retrieving the jacket and checking all the pockets and finding a box in the inside pocket.
Dean talks about all these plans for him and Cas. Places to go now that they’re retired. I’ve never heard him so hopeful.
“I asked Bobby for permission.” I laugh nervously, before continuing “Dean Winchester, you are the most amazing man I’ve ever met. But you know I’ve said that before and you know I could say more, but will you marry me?”
I know how he feels about himself. I know the path he chose to get here. I know h still struggles to get those thoughts out of his head.
Now Jack controls the Empty and freed Cas and in return, Cas splits his time between helping the Angels in check, creating this new Heaven they had planned and talked about...and he still comes back to us, at the Bunker.
I can hear laughter. Cas is laughing and its like music to my ears. I can hear Charlie, followed by Gabriel and Rowena and finally Crowley who makes a comment saying
But now I know what it is and I hate it. I hate how it consumes me, how human it makes me feel. How it takes a hold of everything I hold dear and how it plays a big part in everything that makes a human what they are.
I thank Bobby and we talk for a while and head out to the barbecue and bonfire, placing the vows in my pocket.
I can see the silver strands of his greying hair shining in the light of the sun in Heaven and I can see hair gel has been used. His gentle eyes as crystal clear as the ocean, widen as he sees me.
He mumbles something and pull him close, telling him everything will be okay. He promises he won’t touch anything, and says he’ll clean up his room.
Cas doesn’t realise what he’ll see when we get attacked. I’ve never told him of the vivid dreams about us that I’ve had in detail about ways our lives could go – of what could be.
My phone beeps with a text and I ask again what is happening. Sam puts the phone down, and I put my foot down on the accelerator.
“Dean you can ask me that when you’re not on your death bed.” I laugh nervously, leaning in to nuzzle his hand. “I thought I lost you.”
“Hey.” I smile “You gotta get down the aisle first, you can cry afterwards.” I help him with his tie and walk back out the room.
I tell Ellen and Jo I’ll see them later and they tell me to tell Dean they said ‘Hey’. I tell them I’ll tell him and I head home, putting the ring in my pocket.
I’ve often thought of this too; being in the Empty only made these happy dreams surface more and they are what kept me sane.
Dean takes the dream me’s hands and he smiles. I feel a tightness in my chest; a sense of longing for it to be real.
I swear for a moment, I see Dad and Mom amongst the crowd, but as quickly as they are there, they are gone. Possibly gone with Jack to Heaven.
“You know, Cas. After everything we’ve been through, this is nice. We deserve this. You deserve this.”
We plan to have the wedding with who is left alive of friends and family, but considering that leaves our guest list quite short, Jack arranges for us to all get married and for all our friends in Heaven to attend.
One of them...belongs to me. I’m still an angel, its not supposed to happen...but yet it is. And the one heart that is beating the loudest is Dean’s own.
He looks around for something, seeing the jacket and relaxing. The doctors leave and tell me to call if we need anything.
Ash runs me through all the music he has planned to play – Cas requested a few songs and he knows what I like anyway. Bobby takes me to a room in the Roadhouse where he changes into a tuxedo in a blink of an eye and I’m genuinely impressed.
He moves his hand and I feel a little weird for a moment before I see a box in his hand, which he opens up.
“If anything interrupts this wedding, I’m sending the bastards to Hell myself.”  Dean spits, staring out the window.
Everything seems relatively normal. I can hear cars and stuff and I keep walking, wondering what time it is and where the others are
I have a plan. I want this to be a good Christmas, and if my present is Cas coming home, than it will have been worth it.
Cas’ tears burn Dean’s flesh and heal his wounds slightly. Must be some form of Jack’s powers, I guess?
With a groan of relief, Dean drops his forehead on Cas' shoulder, squeezing back when he feels Cas' fingers twitch. An inquisitive hand pats at his side and all Dean can think is how much he needs to hold him. Though not like this.
Sam turns his head; Dean feels it without even looking for it, smiling and knowing the moment his smile is returned. He could put on music, start up an endless conversation about everything they've been through and the monumental task that's just been completed. They won't, because if there is one thing that underwrites everything they are, it's that there is so much they can say to one another without saying a word out loud. Without too many words, anyway.
At dawn, fuelled only by bad coffee and a candy bar he found in the trunk, Dean watches the sun glint off something in the distance and feels as though his soul has been realigned. White noise fills his ears, the urge to speed up wins pushing his foot against the pedal and his heart against his throat. Last minute words air their final rehearsal, even if Dean's now convinced he won't need to say much of anything at all.
Cas has every right to look as suspicious as he does. And Dean thinks he has every right, for that suspicious look on Cas' face, to be falling in love with him all over again. To feel that love, and all that comes with it, and for once acknowledge it. For once bathe in the knowledge that he too is loved.
Bobby's face softens, his smile understanding. It all blurs for Dean trying to look at him through his tears. "Yeah. He's here. Probably pissed that you're here so soon. Think he planned on some finishing touches before you showed up, but. Well. You're here now. That's all that matters."
"Cas," Dean says, his voice breaking yet again as he takes Cas' hands between his own. "How can this be my happy place, if you're not in it, huh? How can I be happy anywhere, if you're not with me?"
“Hey, buddy, if there’s anything Sammy’s tried to get into my head, it’s that there’s no such thing as being ‘too emotional’. Come on, Cas, please talk to me.”
“Dean took on more than he can handle, he fought off the vampires, but he said he was going to check out where they were last seen. He told me to wait for you,”
Jack knows that Dean doesn’t really miss hunting. He’d grown tired of it. But he still wants to help out a new generation of hunters.
I explain to him that Cas saved his life. Cas was the one that made sure he survived. Cas was always looking out for him.
I try and focus, trying to heal him with my powers but they aren’t working and I keep trying; tears are blinding my eyes, running down my cheeks.
We decide to get married amongst all the carnage, seeing as it reflects who we are, and who we were and who we will continue to be – hunters, and the Winchester family.
I open the door and find my brother fiddling with a tie. He’s not really the type of guy to wear suits.
At the end, Dean will pull out the ring and reveal that in order for the next chapter to begin, he wants to turn the bunker into headquarters for hunters around the world.
The next few hours pass in a blur. Then, somehow we are teleported to the Roadhouse in the early hours of the morning, and I see how preparations are going.
I push Cas out of the way as a demon flies at him and we both attack each other; it catches my face and I feel blood ooze down, and the demon disappears when Cas stabs it in retaliation
This is where I want to be. I am loved. Being on Earth with Dean, Sam, Bobby and Eileen and everyone else...I’m home.
It is then that I hear somebody walking down the street, and I turn my head. I shake Dean and he turns, stopping in his tracks.
“I’m not good with words, but let’s keep things short. Cas. You changed me. You saved me countless of times and neither one of us would be standing here if it wasn’t for you. You’re family, and you always will be. And I love you.”
“I’ve been thinking, Cas.” Dean says, looking a bit nervous. “Everything I’ve ever done, has been to find out who I am. All the while, I pushed away my feelings. I’ve been fighting for so long, I didn’t realise what I had, had been with me all along.”
Eileen leans against me, crying. I wipe her tears. Eileen decides to go inside to give them privacy.
I guess some articles were bound to slip through the cracks of what we can get rid of and what we can’t.
“It didn’t open because you confessed and it was one sided. It opened because they knew Dean felt the same way. Its cruel, but Dean does love you. He just finds it hard to tell you. He’s...He’s never had anybody that looks out for him like you do, Castiel.”
“Grace.” I say without a second thought. “Because my Grace has saved us throughout the years and brought us closer, and now I get to share a life with you guys. She’s a symbol of hope for the life we've made together and for the future. It was fate that we found her.”
As quick as he arrived, Bobby leaves and I hear a knock on the door. I turn my head to see Eileen and Sam.
I lost my powers and my wings when Jack bust me out of the Empty and now I can age alongside my love.
Bobby smiles at me and Sam tells me we’re having a bonfire outside with everybody, and Ellen says she’s on cooking duty.
Dean is helping Eileen by putting Christmas lights outside around the house. Hhis shirt sleeves keep slipping, revealing just what he’s done.
Dean slips the ring on my finger and Sam comes back in the room. They proceed to tell me how they came up with the idea.
Cas stares at him, freezing Dean in place like he so often does. "Am I coming back, to be with you, or am I coming back, because you don't think I should be in here?"
Cas' lip trembles as he nods, gently squeezing Dean's hands. "Like everything I've ever wanted to hear."
Dean first relishes in how easy and natural it is to be holding Cas' hand as they walk. "Well. I don't have any idea what our future looks like, but for now, at least, this place is home. For all of us. And no matter what happens between me and you, I want you to have a place here. A room, that's just yours. I want you to know, that you have somewhere, no matter what, Cas. That's more important to me than anything. I mean, it's not—you are. But this?" he says, coming to a stop outside what has been Cas' room on and off for years. "This is yours. Whether you use it for storage, or if you get mad at me and want to be somewhere. It's yours."
Cas looks around him, hands deep in his pockets as he sighs. "Yes. You are. I hope everything is to your liking."
How can he not smile for hearing that. Dean squeezes his shoulder then pulls back so Cas can see him nod. "Then, let's do it. You and me. Let's... go be human. Normal, whatever that looks like."
Cas continues to look suspicious. Why wouldn't he? He still hasn't really told him a damn thing. There is a corner of Dean's mind that is imagining some perfect setting for some schmaltzy love confession, and here, in The Empty, this isn't it. But since when was schmaltzy ever going to be them?
"You know I love you too, right?" Dean says softly for his voice cracking, swallowing hard as he forces himself to raise his head again and open his eyes.
Cas is asleep. On his pillow, in his bed, underneath his comforter that is tucked up right beneath his chin. Dean can't believe it, even if he was the one who cradled Cas to him when he collapsed in The Empty, and he was the one who laid him out on the back seat of the Impala when he got him out. The memory of watching Cas' grace seep from him for the last time Dean thinks might be one that stays with him a lifetime, but once Cas finally wakes he'll try only to think on the good that's come of it. Cas is here, safe, and whole, and has an entire future ahead of him. A human one, and then who knows what else beyond? They have Jack looking over them now, and Dean can't help imagine how wherever they end up from here on out, they'll be just fine.
Cas turns his wrists so he can slot his fingers through Dean's, now smiling at him through his tears. "I want that. If we can have that."
"No. It isn't. But it's who I was supposed to be. Maybe? I don't know, Cas," Dean says with a deep sigh, unable to look at him. "I don't know. Sometimes there's so much anger in me, I don't even know where it's coming from. I hate that feeling. And I can't pretend it's coming from somewhere else; it's all on me. But I'm sorry, Cas. For whenever I've let my anger get the better of me and taken it out on you."
What makes this easier to deal with is knowing that right now, however this turns out for him personally, Sam is going to be just fine. As he stands here in the dark beside the Impala ready to do what he needs to get his own life on track, Eileen should be arriving at the bunker. Sam's life is going to be far better than it ever has been up until now. So if Sam gets his happy, why the hell can't Dean find his as well? Didn't Cas tell him he is deserving of such things when he opened his heart to him and told him everything? Dean believes it now. More than that, he wants it. If he gets to have something good in his world just for him, why wouldn't he reach out and take it?
That doubt leaves Cas' eyes, leaving them crinkled in the corners instead. Dean loves it. Dean loves him. So he tells him again, right as he claims their first kiss, feeling the curve of Cas' lips against his own. This, this is worth everything, all the things they've been through and all the losses they've overcome. Finally, they have a win, and this one? This is all Dean's own.
"Why would you leave me? Cas? Why now?" Dean asks, tugging on Cas' arm so he has to turn back to face him.
"Cas. I love you," he says, still gripping on to Cas' arms as he stares at him. "You didn't give me chance to say it. We didn't have time to talk. You went, and I... I didn't know. I didn't know you'd want me like that."
And Cas is here. Right here. Stood by the side of the road just waiting for him, like he always is. Just seeing him puts such clarity in Dean's soul. He can't get out the car fast enough.
Cas laughs at him. Dean loves that as well. Is there any better feeling than all of this? "I think we are safe, Dean."
"Can I see him?" Dean asks, back-handing away his tears before pressing the heel of his hand against his mouth. It won't change anything. He's sobbing; loud, and broken, and relieved, and scared shitless. All of it. Bobby doesn't flinch, only pats him on the shoulder and nods to Dean's side.
Dean does not dwell on the thought of Cas taking a shower. "Okay. So, how about you take a shower, and I'll fix us something to eat?"
"I think so," Dean says anyway, for once not needing to do anything but trust. He just needs to get to him, and despite knowing there are words to rehearse on the way, Dean already knows exactly how his and Cas' conversation will work out.
"You're needed, because, I need you. Because I need you in my life, Cas. I want you in my life. Not to serve, or to save, or hunt, or for any of that. Just to be with me. If you want that too, obviously."
"Check in when you get to her," Dean says instead of anything else, already picturing Eileen's smile and the way Sam's entire posture will shift just for seeing her. Dean's heart swells just for imagining it, for knowing when he sees them both next, there won't be anything to part them again.
"You know. On the way here, I thought about all the things I wanted to say to you. All the cheesiest, tackiest one-liners, all that stupid stuff. And I'd have meant every word of every one of them. But I want to say them to you, I want for you to be able to look me in the eye when I say it, even if it scares the hell out of me and I fall over my own tongue trying. I want that. You deserve that. I can't believe you'd even pick me, of all people, but you did, and I'm... I need you, Cas," Dean says, his voice cracking as he squeezes his eyes shut to stop himself crying.
"You're back," Dean says, with his voice cracking, sure any words he's planned out are now leaving him to it, abandoning him to figure this out on his own.
Dean starts to make them eggs, toast, and coffee, determined their next meal will be a more elaborate affair. Again Cas surprises him with a silent return, this time his crinkling eyes accompanied with an amused smile.
"I am pleased. I should leave," Cas says, already turning from him, putting ache and confusion in Dean's heart.
"I love you, Cas," Dean blurts out without even meaning to, his heart already pounding. Cas' smile is triumphant, even if he's starting to tear up.
Cas is quiet as Dean cradles his hand between his own, watching as he runs his thumb over his knuckles. "I hope so."
Cas devours the eggs and toast in minutes, waving away Dean's suggestion of more food. They make quick work of clearing up and then there is nothing left to delay them talking. Dean wants to drink, though stops himself from suggesting it. This is a conversation they both need to have with clear heads.
Cas doesn't stir. Of course he doesn't. His mind is somewhere taunting him with all things probably beyond Dean's imagination. It's the thought that some of those things might involve him that gives Dean fresh determination. He moves to sit cross-legged, having no idea how long this is going to take. But he isn't going anywhere. Not without Cas.
"I did. I do. I always have," Cas says. He's fighting so hard not to keep crying. What has he done to him? This soldier of God, this angel, this incredible man stood before him; what has he done?
Dean's voice breaks, and his heart pounds, his limbs trembling like he might slip right from where he is sat. He's here? He can't be. He can't. Since when does he get everything he wants?
"Actually," Dean says, swirling his thumbs over the back of his hand, "I have more I need to say. Lots of it. Honestly? I don't think I'll even be able to say it all now. But I want to start. Is that okay?"
"Me too. For so long, Cas. I can't tell you exactly when it happened, but it did. I love you. I have loved you. And right now I... I think I get to love you for always. If you'll let me. If you want that."
He stirs slowly, chest rising and falling first and then his arms twitching down by his sides. Dean gasps for seeing it, drawing back to watch at first and then curling his hand through one of Cas' pleading over and over for him to wake. He watches Cas frown with his eyes closed, a slight parting of his lips, and then as he appears to freeze like he's just remembered where he is. Dean's heart stops when Cas blinks his eyes open staring up at him in shock, and he has no control over his own limbs as he drapes over him, sobs wracking through his body.
He wants to keep this playful, and lighthearted, but Dean also needs Cas to realize how much he means his words. "The thing is, when you were gone—I mean before; all the times you were gone before—I didn't... I wasn't doing too well. With you being gone, I mean. Without you."
Is Cas like him in the mornings? Slow to wake, useless before coffee? Dean's excited to find out. He's excited about everything.
Cas nods in understanding. Dean raises their hands to kiss the back of his again. He holds on tight, smiling and gritting his teeth, terrified for how much Cas might be hurting. He won't look away, he won't leave Cas alone, and if he needs to, he will carry Cas out of here.
Shaking his head for Sam's question, Dean drums his thumbs against the steering wheel while still looking straight ahead. "You've got somewhere you need to be, too."
"Like, how I'm done with you having to sacrifice yourself for me, or for anybody. Like, you deserve way, way more than I've given you up to now. Like, I don't know, Cas. Everything. I have everything to say to you."
"I do," Sam agrees, stretching. In comfort for once; not rolling his neck for sleeping at a bad angle, or testing aching limbs after another endless fight. Sam is at peace too, and Dean can thrive on knowing that with certainty now. For the first time in their lives, their future is open. With faith, Dean is confident everything is going to turn out right.
Anger surges through Dean, the kind that would once have made him want to lash out, but what can he strike at when there's nothing around? He didn't want to go, he didn't want to go like
Dean would be more euphoric for the realization if he wasn't so terrified by it. But now is not the time to give into that terror; isn't that the path he's gone down far too many times in the past? Without a word, he sits with fresh resolve to get this done right, checking their location and planning his route back to the bunker.
Cas is unmoving, as always, though it's been a while since Dean couldn't read for sure what Cas is really thinking on his face. Dean thinks he is cautious, and hurting, not sure what to think or trust. Why?
As he stumbles the last step he needs to reach him, all Dean can think about is how he's home. He curls his fingers around the lapels of Cas' trenchcoat with his heart soaring for the love written across his face, jubilant for the tiny tilt of chin and raised eyebrow that says, well? What are you waiting for?
Dean wants to trust, he does, and everything feels so final, but the feelings of knowing he should feel unrewarded and also being at peace isn't sitting quite right at the same time. Though what can he do? Dean looks around him breathing deep, then picks a direction. Stumbles to a stop for trying to work out exactly where here is.
So their new lives won't be entirely free from their history, their mastery of fraud and forgery funding whatever lies ahead. Dean won't know guilt for it. Their retirement plan isn't exactly conventional, but if this is the only way they'll get thanks for all they've been through, Dean is good with it. For now, at least.
"Cas, you do belong somewhere. You always have. You're part of this family. And this family is weird sometimes, scattered out all over the place. But you're here, a part of it. You belong with us."
He searches, for hours or days, Dean can't tell, every step he takes feeling like he is closer to getting somewhere and also further away from everything he knows. Time, existence, nothing has any meaning here, and why should it? Nothing is supposed to be awake. Who knows; maybe for immortal beings The Empty is a writhing, swirling hell of something that is beyond his human vision. Maybe Cas could never explain truly just what The Empty is, because no words could ever recreate it accurately enough. Or maybe the true horror of it all is the nothingness. Maybe his mind is playing tricks on him because his senses can't interpret anything around him.
Cas' face is still filled with sorrow, pricking tears in Dean's eyes. "Because. This is your heaven, Dean. Your happy place. I cannot be here."
Dean likes it, which makes no sense at all, busying himself with grabbing their toast, aware of how ridiculously he is smiling. "Well. Good."
Cas. Cas is why he's here. Dean steadies himself with the reminder, reciting the last of the spell's components recentering his purpose. He closes his eyes, which is pointless here in the dark, but it helps him to focus on the pull in his core leading him where he is meant to go. It also helps to picture Cas in his thoughts instead of seeing this never-ending nothingness. Cas is where he is supposed to go. Who was it that told him to follow his heart? Countless people, surely. Mildred is the one who stands out for Dean now as he walks, Cas' name forever on his lips while he tries not to breathe too loud.
"Then, what's the problem? What aren't you telling me, here?" Dean asks, for knowing when Cas is stalling for time.
"Okay, okay. I'm sorry," Dean says, clearing his throat as he squeezes Cas' hand. "Look. I'm not great at this, okay? Which is a lame excuse. But I'm trying here. Give me a minute."
"You came here, to tell me that?" Cas asks, his voice gruffer than normal. Is it from sleep? Dean's words?
"I really didn't know you could feel like that about me," Dean says as soon as they're sat, before he loses his courage. The library seemed a good choice for talking in because while there is a whole table between them, they have to look each other in the eye.
