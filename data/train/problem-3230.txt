“Is it a problem?”
Cas glares at him playfully before huffing. “No birthday sex, Dean.”
“That’s not the answer I’m looking for, Dean.”
“Dean, stop avoiding me. Why don’t you want to talk to your own father?” Dean stops in his tracks, grip tightening on Cas’s arm. “You’re not even going to give me a thank you? I saved your life last time we saw each other, and I haven’t gotten a single word of thanks around here-“
“How could you do this to me, Dean? After everything?” Dean shudders. “How could you kill me..?”
The urge takes over and Cas tries laughing himself at Sam, Dean being the only thing holding him back.
“Mornin’, Cas,” he wipes his mouth of drool before he turns over and kisses Cas’s lips softly, groaning as he feels an ache in his back. He huffs before cracking it. “man, I’m gettin’ old.”
Castiel pulls Dean in, leaving a soft kiss on his lips, leaving the human stunned and flustered. The angel only smiles softly again, eyes shining as he stares at Dean who’s piecing together what had just happened as his face burns bright.
“Cas come on-“
After Cas finishes his drink they both walk outside the road house, Dean completely awed at how clear and beautiful the night sky is. “Is it like this every night?”
” he puts the piece down on the plate and grabs the remote, playing Home Alone. He then wraps the fluffy blanket around himself and the neo-human. “I still can’t believe you’ve never seen this movie, it’s a
Cas loves him so goddamn much and he can barely help it, he feels an emotion that’s alien towards someone who was raised to believe he was unworthy of it. Cas had never loved someone before but he fell in love with
“Oh- Dean I don’t think that’s a good idea-“ Cas says in a panic.
Dean’s cheeks tint red at that and he turns back down the hall with a smile wide across his face. “You’re somethin’, Cas, you know that?” Cas returns the smile.
“I know. I know, Cas, but it’s not right.  regret all the things I did because of the mark. It feels amazing, but in the long run it brings so much dread and guilt that.. that... that you want to kill yourself.” Dean says, gun lowering to his side subconsciously. “I don’t want you getting to that point, Cas. Not again. So please, /please/, come home with me.”
Dean, in a panic, rushes to his light switch to try and turn on the light but there’s nothing. Nothing. He runs to his dad’s room only to find him gone. Dammit. Of course he’s gone, and of course now of all times. He goes to Sam’s room instead and is about to wake him up until he notices how peaceful he is.
“C-Cas,
Dean gives Cas a ‘What the fuck dude’ look as the angel hangs his head in embarrassment.
There’s so much Dean loved doing with Cas that he’ll never be able to do again. No more close intimate nights where they’re sat just a bit too close on his bed, talking about whatever came into topic. No more movie nights where they watch the same movies over and over again because Cas found it hilarious or loved analyzing it, or because it was another one of Dean’s millions of favorites and he loved reciting the lines as they were spoken and Cas would always look at him with so much life and enjoyment that would only fuel Dean to do it more with more drama and enthusiasm.
“Yeah, I love you too Cas,” he says with a grin.
Sam isn’t as close to Cas so he only feels as though he just lost another person, but he tries to help Dean anyways, rubbing his back in an attempt to sooth him. He’s never seen his brother let out such agonizing and painful sobs.
die and grow old and sickly, while he remains young and pure forever, no health complications. He doesn’t say anything, he just holds Cas harder, suddenly interested in not taking his time with him for granted.
see,”
Dean frowns. “Hey, it’s whatever. I don’t mind having my angel boyfriend growing old with me, alright?” he sets their shirts down and walks over to Cas, cupping his face. “I don’t care if you’re growing weaker, Cas, in case you think that. Chuck’s gone, there’s few angel’s and Heaven’s not doing so well power-wise either. If that means I have someone to grow old with, even if you’re already old as hell, I really don’t mind,”
The human rests his head on Cas’s neck, swaying against him slightly before sighing and pulling away. “Can we please have a big cuddle session once we’re done with all this? All this.. dad coming back from the dead stuff is extremely exhausting..”
“I know.”
“C-Cas..”
The angel tilts his head in confusion. “Well.. I suppose, but I’ve never tried,”
Dean feels tears prick his eyes as he continues to heave and gather nothing, head hurting and vision spotting. Sobs grow closer and closer, creeping up his throat like a spider.
“I uh, I wanted to give you this,” Castiel had a coat in his hands, same as the one he was wearing at that moment. A deep tan with soft fabric that Dean found ever so comforting to run his fingers over and fidget with. Cas had always noticed it but never mentioned it to him, knowing he’d never do it again if he’d realized he was doing it.
He’s on his feet again, body feeling like it went ten rounds with the hulk. His body feels too hot in too many areas, ugly bruises already starting to form. Cas stands in front of him, hatred radiating off him like a furnace. Voices surround Dean.
Dean sighs in relief and nuzzles into Cas’s hand, eyes fluttering closed. “I really missed you, Cas…”
“Maybe.”
“What’s wrong?” Cas asks quietly, setting the box down on the bed next to the packaging and new clothes. He rubs Dean’s cheek with his thumb comfortingly.
“I love you.”
Dean looks at him oddly, but can’t hide the loving look in his eyes. “You’re weird.”
Jack looks up from his bowl and smiles. “Good morning Cas!”
The angel fights back by rocking his hips into Dean again, making the man let out a soft moan. He’s rewarded with a playful glare. “Oh you ass,”
Dean’s startled when Cas wraps the hat around his head, rubber band pinching the skin under his chin, making him let out a cry.
“Dean no, please, you can’t.. you have to keep living, Dean, please...”
Sam apologizes with a surprised and some-what annoyed tone several times before leaving the room.
“See?” Castiel chuckles. “You have to learn to accept physical affection, at some point.” Dean cuddles up to him nervously, still unsure, but eventually gets comfortable.
Castiel feels his heart break. He brings both of his hands to Dean’s cheeks, looking into his eyes deeply with intent and honesty. “Because it is
“Why don’t you take a picture,” Dean says with a smile as he tugs a shirt from his dresser, one for Cas too.
Cas brings their hands up, peppering kisses on each of Dean’s knuckles, making him chuckle. “Why do you like kissing my hands so much?”
“Tell me what you want.” Castiel demands the hunter, the order combined with the voice Dean’s become addicted to sending chills throughout him. Well, the parts of him that he can feel. He makes a small sound like a whimper before shaking his head. “
Cas kisses Dean’s cheek, the salty taste of his tears meeting the copper.
.” Castiel mutters with pure disgust before throwing Dean to the ground. And Dean lets him.
“I wanted to see what all the fun was about,” Dean shrugs. A blush reaches Cas’s cheeks. Realization hits Dean. “Wait…” He blushes harder. “Do you.. have a possession kink, Cas..” no response. “I’m not talking demon or angel possession, I mean marks, bruises, scratches, just any type go mark of possession,”
Cas can’t help but laugh at his lover’s obsession with high water pressure. “Better than cheap motels?”
Dean smiles against him before nuzzling against his chest. “Is it… beer?” Cas frowns and laughs before shaking his head. “Is it… birthday sex..?” another shake. “Awe come on man, no birthday sex? I thought today was my special day,” the hunter says with a playful smirk, now craning his neck to look up at Cas.
“Alright. Has Dean softened up at all?”
Dean wonders. He gulps before moving forward, placing his lips around Cas nervously. The angel makes a sharp sound from the contact, the wet warmth surrounding him. Enough to drive even a holy Angel of God crazy. Dean sinks further, as best he can without gagging, his practice from years ago really paying, and Castiel moans Dean’s name in response. One hand rests on the brick wall and the other in Dean’s hair, tugging on it often. Every pull brings the hunter to make a sound and the vibrations nearly send the angel over the edge with each hum.
Eventually Dean will feel guilty about his appearance, what his body does and how Cas will have to help him through those. Castiel himself doesn’t care about what he has to do for Dean, he’ll always do anything for him. But he worries about what his lover will think. He doesn’t want him to feel self-conscious about himself, or embarrassed. He doesn’t want Dean to worry about Cas thinking of him differently as he changes, because he really won’t. Dean’s soul and personality is beautiful to him and that’s all that matters, nothing will ever take that from him.
“So? The humans used to warm each other with body heat when it was needed.” Cas informs.
“C-Ca- Y-You-“ Dean chokes out.
“In one of.. what—Dean, what’s going on?” Sam asks, getting up to sit on the bar stool. Dean falters. He turns on the radio, static. He turns the nobs, static. Sam frowns. “It’s probably broken.”
Cas lets out a cry of anger. He could no longer control himself. The box is shaking, rocking back and forth as Cas tries to escape the confined space. Dean bites his tongue to stop himself from crying.
No more hearing Cas mumble to himself in confusion about the smallest of human things, including using even a microwave.  No more lone drives with Cas in shotgun admiring the passing views of trees and mountains, the slight perk in his posture once he sees cows or horses or goats, as old music plays from the stereo.
Soon enough they make it to the library again, hands since departed. They walk up with the smiles still on their faces, but those soon fade once John points them
After he was freed from Michael, all he dreamed of was all those he murdered while under his possession. All the humans, the children, hell, even monsters. The things Michael said to Cas. Everything.
Dean gasps at the sudden force, breathing broken from the inability to gather air to his lungs.
“Cas..” he says with a broken tone.
other
“C-Cas I-“ he gasps. “P-Please..”
Cas nods. “I see. I can try, but there’s no guarantee.”
Cas smiles softly. “You really like Christmas, don’t you?”
Dean looks to Sam nervously and angrily before nodding. “Fine, just.. give me a few minutes. Cas,” he says before walking out again, the angel following closely behind him with a scowl.
“Y-Yeah.. do.. do you want me to help you..?”
Though, the little sounds Dean makes doesn’t help. But soon enough, a pair of black oil-slick wings emerge from the angel’s back. The feathers are a deep rich black with a rainbow sheen like the sun shining on a puddle of gasoline. He can hear Dean let out a sound at the sight of them. They’re big, not as big as Michael’s, obviously, but they’re just a bit smaller. Which is big for an angel that isn’t an archangel.
"I got you out, Cas," he says with the weakest, tiniest shrug. "It's the best I can do."
soft, by the way. Kinda greasy but thick and warm from his scalp so close beneath. Dean would very much like to do nothing else forever, actually. Maybe the case was a bad idea after all.)
"That's good."
Despite the fact that Cas is staring blatantly at his mouth and swaying further into his space, Dean doesn't move in yet. This kiss feels important. It feels crucial that he nails this. He doesn't know why; it's not like if he uses a bit too much teeth, Cas will suddenly draw the line. Dude is very clear about what he wants right now, but it feels different, alone and fully facing each other, nothing between them but the breeze coming off the nearby grass. It feels significant.
, not one of the million faces he puts on daily, and stays. He settles back down against Cas's chest, listening to the heart beating under his ear. Tomorrow is gonna suck no matter what. Dean knows he should be terrified, and he is, just not as much as he should be. He wishes he could say it was the endorphins talking, but he knows it's not. It's the heartbeat in his ear, the guy it's attached to, and the words he says. That half thought comes back to haunt him: he could probably love Cas, given the chance.
"Dean," Cas chokes out against the hinge of his jaw. "Is this...?"
It's an unseasonably warm November, which for Sioux Falls means normal cold instead of subarctic. Dean pops his collar one-handedly as a wind skirts around the piles of cars, pulling Cas closer instinctively with an elbow around his bare neck. He realizes belatedly that it's kind of stupid, but by then Cas is awkwardly setting his own arm across Dean's lower back and Dean's not gonna jeopardize that, so there they go.
"Your—" This time Dean's the one trying to look at him, which is much easier. "What, are we angel married now? Give a guy some warning."
"M'definitely crying on you anyway," he admits, mumbling but trusting Cas to understand him anyway. "Just so you know."
It's far from perfect—Dean's body won't let him keep this up for long, his brother and son are a few feet away and definitely paying attention, he's crying all over Cas's beautiful, living face, and it's the best he's ever felt. In some ways it's a good thing Cas already fulfilled his deal, because Dean knows, he just knows, it's too good for it not to be the best thing to ever happen to both of them. He's got Cas's face in both hands like he's always wanted and yeah, his frantic self-soothing monologue was right: it's okay. It's all okay.
They're face to face when Dean realizes that this means Cas stood up at some point, though he's still swaying slightly on his feet as he says, "You could call from the road, too. If you have time."
you," Cas continues when it becomes clear Dean won't. "Why is this a fight? Not even three hours ago I told you—"
"I think they like me," Cas says with a short nod. When Dean raises an eyebrow at him, he clarifies, "The Harvelles."
, whatever's nearest, but what's nearest is Cas, so he hikes the duffel off his shoulder and hefts it carelessly onto the map table. The thunk and rattle of its contents is like a gunshot in the otherwise empty bunker, and Dean is momentarily concerned by the ripple of the map table's plastic surface. It's a shitty distraction when Cas is still right fucking there, shoes in Dean's periphery, lingering in the doorway, but it's enough for now.
"Yeah," he says lamely.
"Are you... crying?" He asks, half under his breath as if out of respect for the loaded pause and nothing else.
"I don't see how this is any more private than where we were," Cas says when they come to a stop around one of the last stacks of cars, sheltered from the house but not quite out in the literal weeds of the field out back.
But not for long, if Dean has anything to say about it. His hands fumble down to ruck up the back of Cas's shirt, dragging him down into a kiss before finally pulling Cas down into him.
"Shit," someone says. Is it Dean? "Holy shit, Cas, that—"
Dean has a second to think the radio sounds so much louder without Jack, but then the front door swings shut and Cas is kissing him. It's a nice kiss, slow and strong. He drapes his arms around Dean's neck, flecked with cool water but oh so warm underneath. His touch—all his touches—are soft as he guides Dean back with him, sandwiching himself between Dean and the side of the truck. They're both doing their best to keep things tame, well aware that Jack and his friends will soon be swarming the lawn, but it's as good as anything. Nowadays, things with them always are.
"Not so much assumed as hoped," Cas admits. He has on the same little smile he did when they left the house.
"Think I'll be the judge of that," Dean mumbles somewhat sullenly, but he lets Cas set his knee in the scant space between Dean's legs and lean down 'til they're face to upturned face. It's unnervingly grounding. In the shadow of the car, Cas's eyes are a familiar blue, wide and dark and intent as he fills Dean's view.
"Having less desirable qualities doesn't detract from the fact that you're beautiful," Cas says, their foreheads almost touching. His hand slides to Dean's side, grounding. "Exactly as you are. Not as God made you, but—" A dark, almost imperceptible pause as his fingers flex. "As I did."
Shots. Right.
He sounds adorably dopey for someone who five minutes ago had to cover Dean's eyes while fucking brains out lest he go blind. Dean bites down another smile and pats his face jokingly until Cas nuzzles into it. "Here, watch this."
For now, Cas's hand turns over in the scant space between them and closes around Dean's, careful but strong. For now, Dean tilts his head onto the unfamiliar surface of his own jacket on someone else's shoulder. The stars don't go anywhere and neither do they. For now.
"Never stopped me before," Dean quips, scrunching himself further into the corner. Cas isn't wrong. When he twists to get the door, he knees Dean concerningly near his dick and closes the door on his own coat and, almost, foot.
"Cas—" He starts without knowing where he's going, but stops with a few aborted steps forward. His body has taken him immediately to Cas's side, which says a lot, but he freezes just as reflexively. "Come on, man, you know it's not your fault."
"No, he definitely is," Jack says, pointing at Dean's other eye, which, okay, might have let loose a single tear or ten. Half crying at most. "How do you do that?"
He suddenly wants to see Cas like this in a real bed. Would he still be clinging to Dean like his own personal blanket, or would he spread out bare against the sheets? Dude doesn't look much like an angel from the outside, but that... They'd have to live to find out, Dean thinks, and realizes something else.
He forgets it all when Cas's fingers redirect, drifting back up to rest barely in or along the cleft of his ass.
"Just to be clear," he says, slow and sure and practically glowing with it, "you are the truest love of my very long life."
Unfortunately, what comes out of his mouth is, "You saved my life, I saved your life."
Maybe it was the severity, the idea that this time Cas wouldn't bounce back. Maybe it was their mom being there, watching this whole ordeal while Dean tried to scrub the bleeding heart from his sleeve. Maybe it was— Well, what Cas said definitely had something to do with him clenching his jaw the whole way back to Kansas, but it's not the only thing keeping Dean's lid firmly on.
"Yes," Cas says, once Dean can breathe again. "I like you, Dean. Very much. More than I do anything else."
too many times as a kid, huh—he basically gave Cas his jacket and pin, what the fuck.
Then, before he can overthink it, he ducks to kiss the top of Cas's head. In and out, that's it, and it's the only place they're even touching, but that millisecond of contact floods Dean's body with the fizzy sensation of risk taking. He could probably convince himself that it's because he was thinking about Charlie so much, and that was their thing, but he knows it's not. Charlie's memory has nothing to do with how long he stays there, or the warmth of Cas's polite hand on Dean's flannel-covered waist.
"What are you looking at?"
"Dean. Please look at me."
"'We' ain't going anywhere, man."
He manages to force his jaw shut before he can finish that particular sentence.
"Come here often?"
Once Dean can justify it to himself that way, he nods and lets Cas fold his arms over Dean's shoulders, tugging him over out of sight of the main room.
"Bitch." Dean rolls his eyes and waves Sam over too. "You too, get in here."
, but Dean has bigger things to worry about.
Baby's backseat is suddenly even less spacious than Dean thought. This confined—yes, the only place they're really touching is Cas's hands on his hips, not the point—this close, his awkward squirming is hyper noticeable.
Kelsey throws them a peace sign before returning to her phone, unphased. Jack has relayed to them and they've overheard on multiple occasions that his friends think it's cute, how affectionate they "still" are despite being ancient. It took Dean a minute to get used to both realizing that other people can see he's in love with Cas and that that's okay, but now that he's got permission, yeah. Being old and in love is fun. Jack's too sweet and oblivious to be embarrassed, but, well, can't win 'em all. At least Claire still gags at them.
Pointing at her warningly, he starts dragging Cas backwards out of the room. "You know nothing."
is zero to sixty with you, isn't it?"
Cas reemerges already smiling. "If you want me to make love to you, you're gonna have to let me up."
Cas takes to instruction like a duck to fucking water: once Dean's hand returns to Cas's ass, he's off to the races, grinding down into Dean with unparalleled intensity. Every inch of contact vibrates through Dean's body, pinned between the wildfire conditions between their dicks and the wet heat of the mouth on his shoulder.
"I don't know who else would notice, so no." There's laughter in his eyes, though, when Dean leans back, that soothes the absence when Cas slips out of him. "Was that good?"
"Uh huh."
Dean steps on his foot, ignoring the confused look Cas gives him in response. "Clear our heads. Kill time. Get away from you drunken yahoos, whatever. We're going."
"It's probably not even a real case," he reiterates. "We'll probably turn around as soon as we get there. 'Til then, somebody needs to hold down the fort, yeah? We all gotta have something to do."
, Dean wants to say, some half hysterical parody of an old pop song.
Dean would be embarrassed by how quickly he turns if it weren't for the fact that Cas was already right there, on his heels, practically in the doorway alongside Dean. His face is no different than it was when he was watching Dean leave, but Dean knows his body language too well at this point and catches the twitch in Cas's hand when Dean takes half a step out of his airspace.
The sentiment is pretty universal.
in a way none of them have for a long time but all of them are now.
Dean contemplates giving in to his deeply learned reflexes, making some joke, scoffing even as he blushes. Cas has mostly—no,
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm—" He ducks back down to kiss Cas again, who rears up on one elbow to meet him. "Are you?"
Cas is a better person than him, though, as he just shrugs and says, "Maybe. Instead I missed you."
In response, Cas cradles Dean's face in both hands for one sweet kiss before pulling him into another hug. Dean closes his eyes and lets his face do what it must in unobserved peace.
His first thought is to say something stupid like
"Stop leaving," he says against Dean's lips.
Which is of course when it all goes haywire.
Sam huffs his own laugh over his head. "Better?"
"Come home soon," Cas says, low and steady like he's not currently the embodiment of all of Dean's best worst fantasies.
Maybe he could turn on some music, but no, the radio is still on the Lilith Fair college station that he definitely wasn't listening to on his beer run earlier. He could pick a tape, but then that's always gonna be the tape that was playing when he had sex with Cas, because he's gonna have sex with Cas, and what if—
"Fuck you."
"Yeah, I could—" Dean is nodding before he even realizes the words are coming from his own mouth. "Uh huh. Sure thing. You..." He accidentally draws out the word while desperately attempting to find an unmortifying end to that sentence. "Got it."
Dean nods once, jerky, and hops up on Baby's hood. Her metal is cool comfort beneath his thighs, the exact opposite of Cas's thigh against his when he joins them.
He sighs at the ceiling, hands over his eyes so the whole world goes red pink through his palms. He's okay. Everyone's okay. Cas is okay, sitting close enough for the air between them to be noticeably warmer. When Dean's hands fall, one grazes the hem of Cas's coat where he's sitting up to accept Jack's hug. Like a heartbeat: okay, okay, okay.
"Truck, then laundry," Cas decides, the smile on his face brilliant after Dean's kiss. "
Cas does kiss him for that, hard, but only for a second before he pulls back to regretfully add, "There's a load of laundry in the washer and the dryer both."
Right now Cas is in the middle of the lovingly dogeared
It takes him a moment: Dean, which is him; careful, which is important.
The first thing Dean feels when he comes back to Earth is Cas's hand in the center of his back.
Dean peels himself off Cas reluctantly, lest the thought run rampant. The chill outside makes itself known for the first time in a while. One of the seals on Baby's windows must be a little loose, because he feels a thin stream of air swirl through the cabin, raising more unpleasant goosebumps across his skin than were there a minute ago. Still, Dean can feel the heat radiating off his own body, and doubly so for Cas, so he sits up and surveys the wreckage of their clothes.
"So good," he says unthinkingly to Baby's ceiling, "right there, sweetheart, there you go."
Fist around the other treasure from the front seat, Dean waits until the leather is settled on Cas's shoulders before saying, "Dropped this too."
"Which would make me Calvin. I could see that: we both defied the expectations of our origins."
"Focus, buddy."
"My bag that's... Wait, when I was getting my jacket?"
The third time Cas gets his knee caught in his coat and slips headfirst into Dean's chin, Dean draws the line.
It does nothing to wipe the suspicion from his face, but then two of Cas's fingers touch the very back of Dean's arm, right above his elbow, and it's hard to think about anything other than how quickly they can get alone.
"You shoulda hated me." Dean did, after all.
"You saved my life and I saved yours!" Dean gestures at Cas, ignoring the giant broadcasting behind him. "We're even! We're even, Cas. I mean, what do you want from me? What am I supposed to say?"
They kiss again just as another car starts trundling down the drive: a classic soccer mom type ride, one Dean swears he will never drive, so help him nobody. They part again before it trundles to a stop, technopop perfectly scoring the resigned mother in the driver's seat.
"Anyone ever tell you you say my name a lot?"
"Last night on Earth, huh?" Dean asks instead. His gaze is caught by the flash of silver in Cas's ear. He doesn't know what he was going to say, but a corny line he'd already tried now embarrassingly earnest is probably still the lesser of two evils.
"Yeah, yeah, I just—"
Dean's going slow enough he can crank the radio with one hand while the other wiggles fingers out the window, knee against the wheel. He locks eyes with Cas, whose unimpressed expression goes unchanged even as the volume increases.
He's still grounded enough this time to feel simultaneously the press of Cas's whatever soul thing against his and the press of his dick inside Dean. Goosebumps erupt across his arms. He gets his mouth along Cas's jaw and just holds on, and there's something so good about it, about how Cas toes the line between considerate and intense, that almost makes Dean think he can get it up again already. Instead, he leans their foreheads together and starts to talk.
Dean let’s out a breath into the cold air that shows as a cloud in front of him as he kicks dirt. Cas’s wings shiver from the cold.
A huff of relief. “Good, now let’s get back to them, we’ve taken long enough.” He pecks Cas’s lips before starting to walk down the hallway, holding the angel’s hand with his own subconsciously.
“You thought I was gonna reject you?” he asks softly.
“Alright Sammy, I’m gonna run inside to grab snacks and all that. You can start filling up the car, right?” Sam nods. “Okay, and if you can, fill the jugs. I don’t know how many stops for gas, or anything, we can make when going north.” Dean rises a bit but only to a low crouch.
Sam’s about to respond before the lights flicker for a second, making him blush deeply. John immediately stands from his chair.
Now, Castiel’s grace is kept in a tiny bottle on a string hung up on a rack in Dean’s room. Not for emergencies or anything, Dean just thinks it looks cool (at least that’s what he told Sam and Cas). In truth he really just wants a piece of Cas to be with him at all times.
Dean groans before face planting once again, thumb running along Cas’s bicep carefully as he focuses on the beat of the angel’s heart. He sighs in content as his eyes flutter closed, feeling himself drift slowly and smiling when he feels another hand find it’s home on Dean’s lower back. The hunter tightens his embrace around the angel.
“I love you too, Dean.”
Dean feels himself get pulled up, being met with Castiel’s face close to his own. The pure look of anger and hatred in the angel’s eyes makes his chest feel like he’s been shot by a double barrel. He feels so small. So useless, hopeless.
He shakes his head slowly in response, nuzzling his into his chest. “No,”
After Sam and Dean defeated Chuck, they discovered that The Empty was full of loud, angry and awake angels and demons, which were stressing out the shadow. They, of course, made a deal with it saying they’d help get all the celestial beings to sleep as long as they could get Cas back, and they did. It took a few sleepless weeks of research but it was worth it.
Castiel shifts against him, only glaring into his eyes, no longer emitting words, even of anger. The only sounds are the distance sirens and their heavy breathing, Dean’s sounding broken and wet from the beatings. While the hunter is in pain, all he can focus on is how close Cas is to him. The way he can feel his warmth, his power. How the angel still has yet to do anything else to him, he’s but waiting. Only staring at him with wide, questioning eyes.
Castiel hums. “Agreed, I never knew sex could be so pleasurable, no wonder you did it so often.”
John grabs a fistful of his hair, yanking him up. “You failed your Mother,” he sends a kick to his gut. “You failed me,” Another kick. “You failed Sammy,” Kick. “And you even failed your little angel boyfriend,” The last kick is sent right to his ribs, knocking the air out of him. The boy heaves on the ground, shuddering as blood drips from his mouth.
“Okay, weird request, but are you able to make angel wings physical..?” he asks wearily.
Cas freezes, shocked at the hunter’s response. “Why? What do you mean why?”
Dean’s breath shutters as he holds back a big sob. “I’m so fucking sorry, Cas. This is all my fault..”
“Cas..” Dean says as he kneels down next to the box. “I’m so sorry I have to do this to you, you don’t deserve it.. I wish you could stay with us a-and we could continue movie night, and..” he glances to his brother nervously. “and I could keep waking up to you sitting in that chair of yours reading a stupid book or calming me when I have a nightmare.. I wish you could stay, Cas...” there’s no response. “I... I love you.. I’m going t-to miss you.. a l-lot...”
Cas gets knocked to the floor, but is still conscious. Dean stumbles over to the metal chair that’s fallen onto the floor and grabs it, swinging it at Cas and knocking him out. He then falls to the floor as well and tries to regain his breath. Once he’s calmed down he picks up his gun and sheaths it, then picks up Cas’s limp body and holds him bridal style to the car. Making his way over the bodies was difficult but he was determined.
“I’m sorry, Cas…” Dean says softly, sincere. “I wish I’d known you wanted to celebrate holidays with us,”
compared to this, this..” he gestures to Cas, the angel looking into his eyes lovingly. “This was the most exhilarating thing I have ever experienced in my entire life,” he says with a tired laugh.
Dean sniffles, nose stuffy from near-crying, chuckling weakly. “Have I ever told you that you’re really dramatic?”
“Oh I think we’re out, Dean and Jack made cookies last night and used up the last of them.”
“Personal things that are of no buisness to you, now if you could excuse us, we’re going to bring you
Dean waits for the angel to move again, but he doesn’t. Frustration grows within him. His jeans feel painfully tight on him and this dick won’t even let him help himself.
Sam chuckles. “More time to let you in on what’s happened lately,”
He didn’t even realize he was crying until his brother wiped his face before helping him up.
Cas turns to Sam and glares at him. “You don’t want to be here for this, the process will bring your brother immense pain, and I will have to use my grace which will cause harm to your eyes.”
“I dunno, but just wait, it gets better.” he mumbles into Cas’s chest sleepily.
Dean cackles. “That’s alright, I can survive with these guys for a little longer. Plus,” he smirks and pokes a finger at one of the glands on Castiel’s wings, making the angel hitch a breath. “We can have some more fun with them.”
“Sam’s out in town with your father, they’ve just left and will be out for some hours. The bunker is all ours,”
He groans. “Enough with the sappy crap, I’m talking about him being.. you know..”
“Y-You’re in Lebanon.. Lebanon, Kansas..” Sam mumbles into the grass.
for you. Your only purpose is to keep your little brother alive and you can’t even do that one little thing.”
After cake, pie, presents (which Dean actually liked, they were all T-shirts, flannels, and new boots from Sam and three cardigans from Eileen that were white, grey and black. Jack got him a teddy bear and some colored rubber bands shaped like characters, not understanding adult gifts.), some phone calls from friends and some wine, Dean and Cas head to bed. At least, that’s what they say they’re doing.
The hunter blushes. “Thank you… you.. you too…?”
“Dean dad is on his way there right now so if you and Cas are making out you need to stop right now.” Dean’s blood runs cold.
“You’re so beautiful, Dean,” he breathes against Dean’s lips. “So beautiful, you’re so good for me..”
“Cas, as much as I love this.. making love thing, why can’t we just go fast like all the other times,” Dean whines. He leans into Cas’s palm once it reaches his face.
Jack would stay but he knows better. Talking to him doesn't help, not unless you’re Cas. He’d only listen to Cas. And now he’s gone. The only voice of reason Dean was willing to listen to is gone.
Castiel has never seen a human more beautiful than him. Despite all his scars, mental and physical, he never fails to make Castiel’s heart pick up a speed an angel’s normally wouldn’t. He wishes he could kiss all the marks on his skin while speaking praise, trace them with his fingers softly. The thousands of freckles littering his skin; which he has yet to finish counting.
Cas smiles softly, rubbing his cheek. “I love you too, Dean.”
“Fine, have it your way,” Dean nearly scrambles his way to the angel desperately, praying he won’t leave him. Especially like this. His knees feel like fragile china as he crawls to him painfully. “What was that?”
“What was tha-“
This is all he has left of him, the angel he loved more than anything. A spare coat with a lingering smell. This is all that’s left of Castiel, the angel that gave up everything he had for Dean and the hunter took it for granted. He never realized how much he’d given up for him until it was too late, until he was gone and he could never thank him for any of it.
The hunter rolls his eyes with a smile. “Yeah, right. You’re just tryna keep me alive,”
Dean finally breaks them apart to speak. “I need to call Sam to ask him when he’ll get here, I spent ages making this food and I don’t want it going cold,”
Dean feels Cas grip his thighs so tight it’ll leave bruises and it causes him to let out another soft moan. The burning feeling of Cas stretching him out makes his own cock twitch, leaking precum onto their belly’s. The angel brings their lips together again for a hot wet kiss. His tongue slides into the demon’s mouth, bringing Dean to suck on it and grab his face in desperation.
Cas nods again and that's it.
What he wants to say is,
"That's so hot," he mutters as he manhandles Cas back onto the leather. Cas laughs in a quick burst between kisses, though whether it's at what Dean said or the fact that he can't seem to get a handle on the bottle between their bodies is anybody's guess. "Kinda feel like I should be offended you assumed I'd be such an easy lay, but I'll take the win, you know?"
Out of sight, Cas squeezes him. Dean tips forward until his forehead thunks against Cas's, safe in the midst of all these bodies. His eyes are open, deep blue where the shadow of his nose doesn't eclipse them, and for a second Dean lets himself fall, eyes slipping shut as the words fumble out: "You guys are the best. I love you."
And it's that last thought that makes him do it. Now is so not the time—Sam's got spikes drilled into his skull twenty feet away, for fuck's sake, and Crowley is definitely eavesdropping—but then again, when is it ever? Why do they keep waiting for a better chance that's never gonna come? At some point, the best shot has to be the one he can take.
Thankfully, Cas doesn't respond, and Dean grimaces wordlessly at the ceiling the second he's out of sight, turning to grab his own glass. A thousand flirty foot-in-mouth disaster scenarios flit through his head and he shudders, mouth coated in coarse salt.
Cas leans back further with every word, giving Dean a front row seat to his biceps straining against sleeves in Dean's blind grip. His mouth is a shining slash across his face, his eyes (in the shadow of the door, untouched by the sodium orange light above) are, wow, just, so fucking blue.
Dean freezes: only for half a second, but long enough for Cas to notice, of course.
Dean doesn't notice Cas has frozen against him until he comes up for air and realizes it's still. He worries for an entire second until he actually looks at Cas's face; the heat there is almost frightening, equal parts piercing and shell shocked. He looks as surprised as Dean, which is what pushes Dean the extra inch to run his hand over Cas's hair.
"After overhearing your conversation with Jo—" Dean cringes. "—I asked her what other connotations 'last night on Earth' had, to be sure I wasn't misremembering."
He manages to blindly grab it a couple of times, though it swings shut every time he can't get his arm past Cas enough to get it open all the way. He slides out from under Cas an inch, then another, before Cas pulls him back in.
Crowley's voice is the rudest awakening Dean's ever had, and he was once woken up by two guys aiming shotguns at him who did, then, actually kill him. Dean's starting to understand the appeal right now. And he thought he hated Crowley before...
He comes back to the present at Cas's groan, a low sound that is too full to be swallowed by the leather seats. It's an incredibly human sound, which is equal parts reassuring and concerning. Either way, it spurs Dean on, past the stretch, past the awkward bend of his neck to keep from hitting the roof as he gets up on his knees, chasing the sound again and again until it's replaced by a broken moan of, "Dean."
Still, Dean checks, "Cuz, I don't know all Heaven's rules, but sleeping with a human..."
"Sure." Dean lets himself watch his own fingers card softly through Cas's bedhead, not trying to commit the sight to memory but unable to do anything else. So focused on that, he lets slip, "But you could be. If you wanted."
, the look says.
The sun was rising as they skimmed back across the top of Kansas, and though Dean tried so hard not to, he couldn't help his eyes darting across the car again and again. Cas was alive. That was good. Cas was alive and bundled into the passenger seat in Sam's hoodie, Dean's henley and jeans, which he'd exchanged his sludge stained suit for back at the lake house. He pulled that same coat over it all before curling up against the car window, hair orange then pink at the edges as the sun chased them silently home.
"And you are not the wrong guy," Cas continues over him with a sudden (though slight) levity that catches Dean off guard. "Though it may have been grossly unfair for Heaven to saddle you with the title of 'righteous man,' I will not be convinced that you aren't the
He hovers a micron from Dean's face, so close every nerve on his lips is lit up like a wildfire. Instead of kissing him, though, Cas stops and says against his cheek, "Well, someone has to."
"I mean..." God, does he really have to talk about it? He fumbles his way into sitting, discomfort sitting high on his shoulders. "Sort of? It's not, like,
by touching the tip of his nose to Dean's.
Cas leans in before Dean can even begin to process any of that, which is probably for the best. If he thinks about it any longer, it starts seeming a lot less like "just fun" and more like something Dean would worry about if they had more than maybe eighteen hours left in them.
Seconds later, Jack is racing out the front door looking about the exact same: his tie dye hoodie's purple instead of pink, maybe. He and Kelsey trade some incomprehensible hello and he's in the van with barely a backwards glance until he does, waving them off with a, "Bye, Cas! Bye, Dean!"
"Hello, Kelsey," Cas calls out from his spot underneath Dean. "Jack's just changing his shirt, he'll be out in a minute."
"Alright, Casanova, get a move on."
"Years of practice." Without any permission from his brain, Dean's mouth then adds, "You know, I can even do a shot without my hands. S'called—"
"I've been watching television while you sleep in an effort to better understand humanity," Cas says as he ducks into the passenger side. He looks good. Dean likes seeing him over there, so he keeps looking, keys sitting uselessly in his hand. "Your conversational style especially is very referential. I imagine it would take years to understand everything you say." He tugs on Dean's shoulder until they're face to face and leans into his airspace. "Dean."
He realizes his mistake immediately. A definite problem, in the way that the two of them alone in close quarters is always dangerous. It's not the alcohol: Dean's tolerance is through the roof (to the point where yeah, even he's a little uncomfortable about it) and he's pretty good at controlling himself around hot guys at this point—even Cas, who tends to violate every norm Dean has carefully constructed for himself. It's not even the staccato beat of the thought looping through in his head,
"Right, yeah, I'll just—" He takes a step back, half-turned toward the doorway and jerking a thumb over his shoulder. "Go die of embarrassment."
So what does he do? Well, he's Dean, so he leaves his brother to burn bodies and drives for wordless hours to slam doors in the comfort of his own home.
Cas is standing too close again, par for the course. That's a losing battle Dean's never been sure he wanted to pick, but he didn't consider the distraction of Cas so focused on his body specifically: hands, neck, mouth. The fact that he hasn't offered a hands-on demonstration yet is a Herculean feat.
"Tomorrow is likely to be the end of us all," Cas begins, almost like one of his Heavenly Plan speeches but with a new aching sincerity, "but know that I will do whatever I can to ensure you—and your brother, as well as all those you care for—make it out alive. You have my protection; you have my word."
He's somehow an even better kisser than he is a hugger. Maybe Dean's just biased, but those hands feel better on his face than anywhere else—
Dean tilts his head back far to grimace at the ceiling, but Cas hurries to add, hand fumbling at Dean's shoulder, "Not that I blame you."
He doesn't have to look to know Cas is staring. At this point, he takes it for a given.
"To have—" Cas starts.
Dean breathes in, unexpectedly ragged, and the rest of the words fall out of him with a frustratingly wet edge with a weak shrug.
Until it doesn't.
"Alright," he says, trying not to screw his eyes shut, "whatever it is, just say it."
So yeah, Dean spends three hours out of every few days driving out to take his boyfriend to a lunch he doesn't eat so he can kiss him in front of his employees that would rather they both be saving the world. All things considered, their version of normal is pretty good. Better than most, Dean would say. Worth every second.
Dean sighs at the ceiling. "
. Yes," Dean says into someone's shoulder. "Needed that."
He guides them into something slow and steady, mouthing at where a groan rises up Cas's throat. Stubble abrades his lips and he relishes in the sting. "There."
Dean snorts against his neck, dissolving back into real laughter when Cas flinches away from the feeling reflexively. Endorphins is right; he feels like he would float away right now, if not for Cas's arms around him. Angelkind makes some points too, though, as Cas pulls him closer and the sweat and cum gluing them together disappears. Is that the healing thing too? God's got a weird definition, if this is included. Heh. Sexual healing.
-simple." It doesn't work. "Look, man, you just gotta take it easy for a while. Is that such a bad thing?"
Dean doesn't say anything, just jolts in place, neither into nor away from the touch. His first thought is, dumbly, that it's too bad the good lube in his duffel in Bobby's spare room. The stuff in the glove compartment's fine, but he can't remember how long ago he bought it, and Cas deserves—
"You've got more layers, it's only fair."
"Not the shittiest, no, but most frustrating...?" Cas gives him a look that yesterday would've made it a little inside joke but today is sharp and prodding.
To prove it, Dean doesn't even roll his eyes as he grabs Cas's hand, in front of— Well, not God and everyone, but pretty damn close.
Dean laughs, taking Cas's face in his hands and relishing in the way Cas reaches up to hold his sleeves immediately. "You're getting the hang of it."
As he pulls away—possibly a bit too slowly to go unnoticed—he pats Cas's shoulder and gives it a squeeze. It should feel like the kind of no homo bro move he defaults to when things get too close, but for some reason it actually feels more intimate. It's a thing that they do, that has become something that means
Cas gives him a look, very deliberate, very articulate.
"Yeah, just—" Dean snakes a few fingers under the back belt loop of Cas's terrible slacks.
In all those scenarios, Dean didn't imagine what comes next. He's not expecting Cas's eyes to still be glued to his mouth when he turns back. He's not expecting Cas to pick up the lime wedge for him and linger when their fingers overlap. He's really not expecting it when Cas jolts forward, mouth first, and kisses Dean around the lime still caught in his lips.
When Cas uses words like that, he means them the way a dictionary does: in this case, with zero restrictions, exceptions, or qualifications. Absolute like God's rule.
Cas raises an eyebrow and gestures at the books around him. "I think you're more than nerd enough."
Dean rolls his eyes at the opposite wall (
Dean's brain short circuits before he can fully process the thought, possibly to save him. Before he even figures it out, he clocks the barest hints of embarrassment in Cas's face: the tinge of pink on his cheekbones, the way his eyes flit away from Dean's for what feels like the first time all night. The hurricane in Dean's head goes still, then, like it did when they were in the beautiful room and Dean realized, suddenly, he would trust Cas with anything. And so, just like in that room, he nods, small and silent, and lets Cas do his crazy thing like always.
“This a good angle for ya?” the human asks cheekily. The angel responds by grabbing Dean’s hips and placing his tip at his entrance, shutting the man up fast.
“You’re just gonna be begging for me at this point,” Dean jests, earning another roll of their hips and a harsh bite on his neck. He moans out a broken “
The nephilim looks to Dean with concern, those same eyes of worry that Cas would always give him. It hurts, having your love’s son that mirrored him so much with you while he’s not here.
“You wern’t here, I jus’ didn’t wann’ sleep without you,” his smile is lazy.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean says with a smile.
” a sharp breath leaves him once the human finds the little glands.
They both pull away to rest their foreheads together, not being able to help their big smiles. Dean chuckles softly. “I can’t believe we’ve had all these years to do that only to do it once I’ve died.”
Dean shutters as he inhales. The vines tug even harder, breathing even more painful again. He can almost imagine the blood pooling inside him.
He feels Castiel soften next to him, eyes not leaving Dean. He takes in a shuddered breath, another tear running down his face. Pins and needles poke at his heart when he feels lips kiss the tear from his cheek, blush rising to his cheeks and the tips of his ears. He notices the angel freeze next to him.
Sam leaves with an apology Jack following behind him, and Dean’s alone again.
“Heya Cas, long time no see,” he sighs in contentment. “I missed you.”
Before Dean can reach for the door handle he’s pulled into a kiss from Cas. The hunter smiles against his mouth as he rests his hands in his hips.
“Wow, really? I could really tell from how clearly depressed you’ve been. I’m so sorry for assuming you were okay just because you kept getting pissed at me for grieving,” Dean huffs. “He told me he loved me. He loved me, Sam, and then he died. Right in-fucking-front of me. My best friend that I’ve loved for years that loved me back got swallowed by the empty right in front of me
“Good, he’s been playing this game called Mine-Craft, something about a mineshaft and iron tools… the game makes him happy though, which I’m happy about, he-“
After they got Cas back, Jack came back to see him again after missing his father. He even gave him a soul, so Cas is a full-blown human that can go to heaven and everything now. The thought of spending eternity in heaven with Cas after growing old with him brings Dean a big warm smile.
“N-No, Cas it’s..” a sob escapes his lips. “No one’s e-ever said that to m-me before a-and…”
The blood covers his hands like a latex glove, shiny and a rich red. In front of him are all the bodies of those he loves, everyone he’s ever cared for with Cas standing in front of it, staring right at Dean. He looks pale with pained, sunken eyes. The tears run red on his cheeks where they pass the fresh splatters of blood across his face.
The angel moves as he does, lips meeting hastily as they move together hungrily. Castiel can taste the coppery tang of blood in his mouth, and it only fuels him. He pushes against Dean with all his strength and on instinct the hunter shifts his leg, causing the angel to let out a sound Dean would only be able to describe as the most heavenly before Cas moves his hands along Dean’s body. The touch stings but it only makes him enjoy it more.
“Were you the one who put my Dad in here?”
” Dean screams into a pillow. The angel pulls Dean’s head back by his hair, making the human’s breath hitch.
He’s about to reply before he hears a wet sound behind him, making his blood run cold. Dean turns around and can’t help the tears that reach his eyes at the sight of what he feared,
Dean hums as he curls up against Cas, resting his forehead against his collar bone. A low light-blue glow illuminates the space between them, and Dean smiles.
Sam kicks his feet up on the dash, making Dean frown, and nods. “I guess. That’s a long drive, though.” Dean rummages through his bag and pulls out a cassette tape, making Sam frown. “Really? Out of all the vital items you could’ve taken, you decided on a cassette tape.”
“No, I meant-“ Sam lowers his voice. “Your
He kisses Jack’s forehead and says a quiet goodnight before turning off his lamp and closing his door, making his way towards he and Dean’s room to finally sleep. He opens the door to their room and softens at the sight of his hunter trying very very hard to stay awake and failing miserably. His previously basically-closed eyes open wide at the sight of Cas and he smiles.
Cas is someone who helps him feel loved and safe, and he wouldn’t wish to have anything or anyone better for his birthday, or ever.
“Are you Castiel?” John’s voice is loud, the sudden sound making Dean almost flinch.
“Dean..” Cas says in relief, hugging him back.
“You..” John points to Cas. “You turned my son into a
Kids scream as they run around the house, a cop trying to talk to them as they race.
“Alright, Cas, I think you’ve left enough. Now can we please get to the fucking already because I’m getting impatient,”
Dean nearly finishes right then and there, his dull and messy nails clawing at the angel’s back desperately.
The action startles the tired boy. “Dean-“ he blurts. “What was that for?” He takes a look around the room and confusion paints his face. “What’s.. all this?”
They don’t hear the sounds of footsteps running down the halls over the joyous sounds Dean’s making.
“I have to go now..” Cas says quietly.
..” Dean whispers softly in the angel’s ear desperately, causing him to falter.
“He was trying to kill you!”
“Cas if you don’t stop right now I will pour this bowl of batter over your head,” he says playfully before bringing their lips together.
“C-“ Another punch. “C-Cas ple-“
“Don’t use my father’s name, whore. Only mine.”
Dean moans deeply against Cas’ lips as he releases, everything buzzing as Castiel continues to use him, going faster and faster with each thrust. Dean feels like a toy and it makes everything so much better, so much hotter.
The angel brings their lips together once again and plays with his hair before pulling away and pushing Dean onto the bed playfully, making Dean cry out in response.
Cas smiles at him before reaching for Dean’s other hand, eyes fluttering closed before placing a soft kiss on his palm. “Then I’ll be your first person,”
Cas bites his lip and attempts to cover Dean’s ears as to not wake him up.
“Shit, Cas, look at you. Making me cry again…” Cas smiles against his neck and pulls away, looking him in the eyes lovingly. “Can we.. Can we clean all this stuff up so we can start cuddling? I’m also still super tired..”
“If you mean have I-“ Dean’s cut off immediately by John’s harsh voice.
Castiel pulls away for a moment but keeps moving, speaking through gasps and fast breaths. “Please what..” he breaks out.
The old man huffs. “You notice something weird about that angel?”
“That’s good. I’m glad he finally has someone like you, I’m sure you know how he grew up and what was drilled into his brain,”
The next morning Sam knocks on their door, and Cas looks from the ceiling to the door. “We’re about to head out, call us if you need anything.”
“I think I found him.” Dean says quietly into his phone.
“C-Cas no, I-I-I-“ Cas places his hand on Dean’s face, the hunter wincing after expecting a slap. This is a different Cas. He leans into the touch with anguish.
“Where are you going?” Sam asks in a worried voice.
Cas smiles and carries the tray over to him, adding a
The sound of John’s voice behind him is loud like in the eerie silence like a cannon firing. “Look what you’ve done, boy.” Dean’s blood runs cold as he turns around, seeing his father.
Dean has tears running down the side of his face as he pants, sobs leaving his lips as he comes down from the high, overwhelmed with the sudden occurrence. Castiel continues to move in and out of Dean at a rapid pace, speeding up before releasing into the hunter and rolling his hips a few more times before collapsing onto him.
Castiel’s face grows into a sick smile. “Dean..” he says in a smooth, eerily calm tone. Immediately after he plunges a knife into the man’s stomach, his sick broken cry echoing through the room before Cas shoves him to the floor. “Welcome to the party.”
“Yeah, but usually they did that naked.”
“Pay attention to the movie, Cas,” Dean whines with a slur in his words, looking up at the ex-angel with sly annoyance.
They sit there for a few moments, enjoying each other’s company, before Cas pulls back, leaving a small kiss on his lover’s lips. He grabs the bottles of shampoo and body wash and squirts the first into his hand, bringing it to Dean’s hair. The hunter is quick to flinch, his hand soft on Cas’s arm as he holds it. Cas continues to scrub Dean’s head anyways, causing the hunter to frown.
Dean raises his hand to Ellen to ask for another drink. “One more, then you gotta meet me outside to talk,” Cas nods. “It’s so loud in here, I can’t hear a damn thing,”
He did it for no good reason. He gave his life for Dean in hopes he’d live till he’s old and settled down with whoever finds him hopefully as endearing as he had. And here Dean is wanting to throw it all away.
Castiel smiles. “So am I. If anyone is worth giving up immortality, it’s you, Dean. I’m happy to grow old with you.” he says tiredly, sleep catching a grip on him.
He shoves Cas away from him and jumps off the counter, thanking Sam before hanging up quickly.
Dean’s smile grow’s wider. “Do you think I can see Miracle again? I know I’m not the biggest fan of dog’s, but that little guy really helped me with.. well.. you know.”
“I want to hear you, Dean,” Dean nods his head, breathing unsteady.
“And..
“This ain’t your fault Cas, don’t worry about it. But, hey, do you know if animals end up in heaven?”
He moves his finger again, recalling this location of the male body to be the prostate, one of the most sensitive and pleasurable areas. He smirks at the sounds of Dean’s moans, deciding to add a touch of grace. The action sends Dean screaming once again.
“It’s not, stop blaming yourself. It was me or you and I couldn’t let you go through that again. It’s /my fault/.”
After they finish eating, Cas places the tray on the desk again, sliding back into bed with Dean who once again wraps around him like a koala. The angel kisses his hair before running his fingers through it absent-mindedly.
“You already
Castiel nods again, waving goodbye to Sam and following Dean to his room. Once behind a locked door, Dean whips around to look at Cas.
Eventually the angel manages to tear himself from Dean’s superhuman grip and slips into some teal bee-print pajamas and one of Dean’s old t-shirts before making his way out of their room and into the kitchen, finding Sam drinking coffee looking at his laptop and Jack eating cereal in his R2D2 and C3P0 pajama set both sitting at the table.
The angel finally stops. “I-I’m sorry Dean I can’t control it.. I...”
“I love you, too, Cas…” he feels the angel freeze against him before holding him tighter.
Dean chuckles, “Yeah this whole aging thing ain’t really good on the body, is it, Cas?”
Castiel moves in and out of him slowly, making Dean let out little moans of pleasure, when he decides to up it. At the shift of his hips Cas manages to hit Dean’s prostate, making him let out a guttural moan. He responds by grabbing the base of Dean’s wings and gripping them tight, using them as handles as he fucks Dean harder.
They begin to move together, barely able to find a rhythm from their desperation. Dean makes sounds of pain as the angel kisses his torn lips but it doesn’t stop either of them, they continue to grind against each other. Castiel has a grip on him so hard Dean doesn’t even need to hold onto him if needed, he’s afraid they’re going to cave the wall in.
“Oh- o-of course,” Cas turns away and tries focusing his grace on giving himself wings. It should be easier this time, now that he knows what to do for it.
“I love you,” Cas smiles warmly. “I love you so much Cas,
Dean laughs heartily and looks to the floor, smile so wide he feels like his face is going to stay that way. Once he looks up he sees Cas staring back, smile warm and eyes bright. Dean’s heart beats hard, chest feeling warm, and suddenly he feels like the luckiest, and happiest man on the planet. The sound of his feet slam against the ground, muffled by his cheesy novelty socks.
The angel smiles warmly at him. “It’s better than an engagement ring,” he says before handing Dean the box carefully.
“I’ve been human and it’s really not,” Cas chuckles.
The angel smiles at him lovingly. “Of course.” Dean smiles back.
“Yes, yes,
“You’re not even
“Cas.. p-please.. stop...” he begs.
Castiel laughs softly and kisses his cheek. “Mm.. maybe you should finally consider retiring.”
out. Dean and Cas both sit beside each other at the table, hands underneath and out of sight..
“You mean the chair.”
Castiel nods, standing straight and giving John a cold and curious glare. “I am,” Dean can tell he’s getting defensive of him. He knows what John has done, he’s seen Dean’s memories and has been told about what he’s done to Dean, several times. “And you’re John Winchester, Sam and Dean’s father.”
Dean’s face turns beet red before he pats his face and body to try and find any wet spots. “Cas, you didn’t-“
Cas doesn't say anything, he just glares at John with warning clear in his eyes. He can feel Dean shaking behind him.
“You had one job. I gave you one job, and look what happened?” Dean whines quietly. “You failed. Little Sammy is
His thoughts are interrupted by a knock at the door.
“We can cuddle tonight before bed,”
Dean can’t stop saying it. All that’s on his mind is Castiel, how amazing he feels inside of him and how astonishingly good he is at it.
He holds him harder, like it’s the last moments of his life. “I’m sorry..”
, he thinks.
He see’s Cas soften as he gets the prayer. “I’ll join you,” he says coldly, glaring at John. The two walk out of the room together, leaving Sam and John to be alone awkwardly.
As Dean eats Castiel tidies up their room, placing dirty clothes in their laundry basket and folding clean ones, organizing their desk, and fixing up his side of the bed. After finishing half his food, Dean’s eyes snap up in confusion.
He turns to Dean and the very sight of him makes his heart drop to his stomach. The human has two slicked fingers inside him, moving at a rhythm. He lets out sharp gasps and moans as he imagines the fingers as the angel’s.
“Dean? Are you alright?” Jack asks genuinely, worry clear on his tongue. He asks the question the same way Cas always would.
The hunter takes a moment to catch his breath, not even caring about the wet lines racing down his cheeks right now. He just needs to calm down.
Castiel laughs, “Well now that I know that I’m going to have to make you cut down.” Dean frowns. “I can’t heal you anymore, and Chuck isn’t here to make you immune to disease or health conditions. I don’t want you getting a heart attack on me, Dean,”
“Have a good time, Sam,”
Dean smiles softly. “Well I do.”
he knows, I heard it in his voice when he brought up the coat. God this is embarrassing-“
Dean’s head hits the concrete floor, making his mind go blank for a few seconds as Cas grips his shirt. The angel punches Dean’s jaw.
Back at the bunker, behind closed doors, Dean and Cas are rocking together slowly. With Sam out on a run and Jack out working in heaven for the time being, they can be as loud as they want so they take any chance they can get.
The demon looks down at Cas, watching his confusion turn into scary hot lust once again. Before he knew what was happening they were flipped over, his bare, hot, sweaty back against the cold floor with Cas towering over him. He loses the ability to breath at just the sight.
After he was released from The Mark of Cain, he had dozens of restless nights from dreaming about what he had done to Cas. His hands covered in the angel’s blood, the way he never even fought him back. He took the beating and refused to harm Dean despite the fact that he almost killed him. He dreamed of actually going through with it for weeks.
He could never tell him he loved him too.
Normally snoring would be something that would annoy him, cause him to jump out of bed and slap them just to tell them to shut up, but with Cas it’s different. When it’s Cas it feels comfortable, safe, at home. It lets him know that he has a stupid ex-angel passed out next to him, one who’s willing to give his life for him even if he had been snoring loudly in his ear only moments before.
“Don’t-“
“What?!” Sam exclaims. “Very funny, Dean.” Dean doesn’t break into a laugh or start smiling. He keeps a straight face, a serious one. “You can’t be serious.”
“No, it’s not.” I really wanted that cool ‘radio during an apocalypse thing. “When I woke up today a guy was eating another guy in front of the gas station across the street. He shoved him out a window too.”
“I know you did, Dean,” His wings lower to the ground. “I just wish you got to live out the life you always dreamed, if I had just gone down there and healed you..”
“I know, I love you too. More than anything,” the angel brings his lip’s to Dean’s, savoring the taste of syrup on his tongue.
“I never have, and I never will. I hated being around you the moment I saw your soul in hell,” Dean claws at the flannel around his arms. “I
“Of course. Now, we need to get back there,” he pulls away from Dean. “I don’t want to have to deal with your brother and father at each other’s necks as well,”
Cas cups Dean‘s face in his hands. “No, no, you’re fine I just.. I was expecting a rejection..”
Dean rocks his hips slowly, making the two of them moan deeply. Cas grabs Dean’s thighs and holds him up to slam him back down again, causing Dean to let out a loud guttural moan into the angel’s shoulder. The chair screeches with every hard rock of Dean’s hips.
Jack bites his lip in thought. “Well, I know you’re not okay. I.. I heard what you said, the voicemail. I heard Cas’s voice too,” Jack admits wearily. “I miss him too, I know Sam’s not doing good helping you, but I-“
trying to help him feel happy and letting him know he loves him and is loved and free.
“Wh- No, no no no, it’s just an old bunker. Bad wiring. Dean plans on fixing it next time he has nothing to do, I swear. The bunker is safe, it even kept God away.”
Dean bites Cas’s shoulder hard, stunning the angel and causing him to draw back, giving him a confused look. “What was that for?”
“Yeah and I was helping him evade that!”
“Dean.” He holds Dean’s shoulders and looks into his eyes. “Please, stop this.”
“Who..” Dean stares at him with wide, curious eyes. “What..”
“It’s nothing. Also,” Sam’s cheeks go red. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to take my dad to town tomorrow for a few hours so if you and Dean want some.. alone time…”
He hears the shake of a bottle and looks up to see his brother throw him a bottle of advil his way, he almost doesn’t catch it.
The angel smiles and kisses Dean’s forehead softly, making the human blush and smile as well. “I missed you too, Dean.”
“It’s not..” he sighs and opens his eyes. “It’s not important, Cas. Do you know if you can get rid of the mark.”
He tosses and turns all night, letting out cries for help or refusal, repeating “no” into his pillow or the motel room. He often wakes up screaming with tears on his cheeks, small pools of sweat on his mattress and messy, ragged sheets.
The angel collapses onto Dean’s chest after a few seconds, and breathes heavily. They both lay for a few minutes, calming down.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Cas bites his lip and turns away. “You’ve known you were on the clock for over a year and you never told us? Why?”
It’s the hands that have killed thousands with simple ease, hands that could tear him apart, hands that could smite him with their very will, hands that could break him with just the waft of their fingers, but instead choose to hold him, care for him, heal him, run all over him in silent praise, open him, run through his hair, trace the freckles littering his skin, trace his spine, run along his back, and so much more. They choose to love and help him rather than harm him despite having more than enough power to do so, and that very fact makes him love them all the more.
“Shh, it’s okay Dean. You’re beautiful, every inch of you. More than anything,” Dean blushes a deep red at his words. The angel leans down and peppers kisses down his tanned chest, freckles littered. “Are you ready?” A warm hand lays on his thigh comfortingly.
Cas frowns. “I don’t plan on doing any more fighting, Dean, don’t worry. The only work I’ll be doing is fixing heaven. There’s a lot of souls here in heaven who’s heavens need to be changed so they’re like this, it’s going to take a little while.” Dean grows less tense at those words. “I’ll come back every time though, I’ll only be gone a few hours for you. It’ll be more painful for me, lasting a few days on average.”
“Thought you knew how to save me?” Dean asks slyly.
“Goodbye, Dean.” he says as Dean closes the box, sealing it shut with shaky hands.
“Dude.. we didn’t even use flour, we used a pancake mix and you didn't even touch it, you…” Cas shrugs and Dean just smiles.
” He’s assuming Jimmy Novak actually went to the gym often.
The voice returns to torment him. His own voice.
“Dean? Are you okay?” his brother asks, panicked.
“Yeah, a lot more has happened while you were gone. But I think it’s best we wait until Dean and Cas are here to explain more.” he mumbles the next words under his breath. “
The hunter’s mind is racing, unsure of what is about to happen, wondering of what it would feel like to kiss him, and if that’s what’s going to happen next. Castiel’s bloodied hand leaves a print on Dean’s shoulder, that damn shoulder. He gazes into Dean’s eyes before smiling sadly.
. So you can go shove your stupid homophobic opinion right up your ass, you understand that?” He points to Cas. “Cas taught me that I’m actually worth way more than you raised me to believe, he actually shows his love for me instead of just saying it, which,
Dean grumbles before looking at all the gifts, which were all in soft packaging meaning clothes. There was one more that was a small box, which peaked Dean’s interest some more and made his heart race.
“I apologize for the coat, it was my mistake.”
He wasn’t lying. He meant what he said, both the ‘I love you’ and that it was a goodbye.
Cas laughs again before tugging at Dean’s hair to bring them apart, eyes meeting. The hunter lets out a sharp gasp at the action. It doesn't hurt him, it’s just something he’s found Dean to enjoy. He gives Dean a toothy grin.
Cas frowns. “Well of course I did, I haven’t forgotten a single second of my life since I’ve known you, Dean. Today has always been a very special day to me, always.”
Inside the gas station, Dean’s grabbing all the food he can, all the water bottles he can pack, and even beer. It's not a necessity but he sure as hell is going to need it. Once it turned out that he could pack all the food and water in the store, he grabbed more beer, some gum packs and candy, and even some lewd magazines. He doubts he’s going to get with a girl again because of this whole apocalypse thing so, why not. He drops into the bathroom for a second, sighing when he sees that the water won’t run.
Dean sighs as he tries to look around for his dad or any of his friends, in case any of them are still alive. And of course, he regrets it. Among all the zombies littering the streets, containing his neighbors and dog walkers (and a poor dog turned lunch), are a few of his friends.
The demon moves the finger in and out continuously, matching the movements of his head as he swallows Cas almost whole. The angel lets out a deep moan as Dean uses his free hand to grip the base of Cas’s cock, biting his hand to try and keep his composure. As Dean enters a second digit he lets out a deep moan, sending vibrations straight to the angel’s dick. Castiel reaches over and grabs Dean’s hair, pulling on it and directing where to go. The feeling of Cas’s warm hands on his scalp and pulling on his hair tightly with every moan is enough to drive Dean crazy.
The look on Dean’s face was a bright smile, directed at an unknowing Cas at the other side of the room. Sam can’t help but smile wide for his brother, happy he’s finally found someone to love and be loved by. He sighs happily before slowly stepping away, leaving Dean to his little romantic montage in his head before joining Eileen.
Cas nods and stands with him, kissing Dean’s knuckles as they walk to the kitchen, making the hunter smile.
Dean blushes deeply before kissing the corner of Cas’s mouth. “And here I thought I was gonna be the cheesy one here..” Cas smiles.
He feels Castiel shift in his sleep, indicating he’s awakened. He laughs softly with a rumble in his chest before playing with Dean’s hair, greeting him with a raspy morning voice that makes Dean’s heart flutter.
“Hi,”
“I-I’m s-sorry D-“
“Put it on y-your fingers, make sure you co-coat them and then you..” Cas nods and does as told, coating his fingers entirely and pushing two past his rim. Dean immediately tenses up, feathers shaking. “
you two are flirting, always hugging and saying gross things it’s-“ Sam fakes a gag.
His hands have a death grip on the angel’s arms as he’s fucked roughly, low grunts from Castiel and moans and swears of Cas’s name filling the room. Dean decides to mess with Cas as well, snaking his arms around Cas’s back and grabbing his wings, causing the angel to stop and moan deeply.
“Oh, yeah, lucky you,” he groans. “If I had known we’d be freezing our asses off here, I wouldn’t have agreed to moving here. But of course you’re fine. How did Bobby even survive winters in South Dakota.”
His son groans dramatically, giving Cas the thought ‘
His vision starts going dark and a tear runs down his face. He looks into Cas’s eyes, a line of blood against his face and eyes a deep vicious blue.
he’s woken up by Cas moving him, whispering in his ear once he realizes his consciousness.
He stops for a minute to catch his breath, two sides of him fighting each other, one begging and crying to stop and the other screaming for more. He looks down at Dean, who has tears mixing with blood streaming down his swollen face. His pleading eyes meet Cas’s.
The vines tighten, each breath pushing the thorns deeper. It hurts to breathe.
“No but’s. Turn off your game,”
“Hey! Do you want me to freeze to death?” the Winchester exclaims. Cas takes off his shirt, making Dean blush. “Dude- are you- why-“
, is an angel, and-“
Dean shoves the thought down into the endless pit of all the other ones and uses the little whiskey he has left in a glass as a chaser for only the amount he needs to take.
Next thing Dean knows, they’re both in the backseat of the Impala and Dean is mostly healed up except for some scratches and bruises, and some bites. And naked. Cas is between his legs looking down at him, and Dean can't help but feel so exposed to the world.
Sam clears his throat. “So, who’s going first?”
” he mutters against his lover’s lips. “
“It- You-“ Dean rolls his eyes. “It’s peppermint bark. Trust me, it’s good,” he takes a seat next to Cas and takes a piece from the tray. “It’ll be a good snack for the movie, I made hot chocolate too,” he takes a bite of the bark. “Sammy and Jack made cookies as well.”
Dean looks outside to check on Sam and how he’s doing and sees that he’s on the last jug. He smiles and turns back around, being met with an ugly, disgusting and horrible smelling zombie. Dean freezes out of shock, slowing him down for when he stumbles to grab his knife. The rotting corpse lunges towards him with an animalistic screech, bringing Dean to block it with his arms raised and eyes squeezed shut. He can feel his legs and arms shaking, feeling glad he just used the bathroom before this.
“I have to.”
“At least we don’t have to worry about the other dying anymore,”
“You did this to me, Dean. To everyone.” Dean’s face is replaced with horror as he notices blood pool from Cas’s chest, blooming across his white shirt like a flower. “Why would you do this to me?” The angel asks with pain resting on the tip of his tongue.
Dean blushes and scoffs, “Alright, no need to make it a competition,” The angel places a kiss on the corner of Dean’s mouth before rolling his hips against him harder, making the human moan softly against his lips.
“I won’t judge you, beautiful. Especially since I already know what you’re going to tell me.”
He tries adding a third finger but gets too impatient, he takes the fingers out and pulls off of Castiel, making the angel whine. Cas looks at him with heavy, lust-filled eyes, almost angry that he stopped.
“What’s wrong?”
“Happy birthday, Dean!” Jack says excitedly, blowing a party horn with a party hat on his head, just like when they celebrated his birthday with Mrs. Butters, just more colorful. Eileen and Sam have matching hats to Jack, the tall brother walking over to hand Cas two hats with a smile. He then turns to his brother, giving him a toothy grin before engulfing him into a big hug.
He didn’t know them too well, he didn’t get along well with people in general, but they were still the only friends he had. Well, besides Sammy. He’s glad he still has him around.
Dean shoves his hand away. “It’s nothing, it doesn’t matter.”
”, almost to reassure himself, and sits down on his bed. He feels Cas tug lightly on his shirt.
They’re both interrupted by a knock on the door, causing their lips to separate almost immediately, turning to the door looking panicked. Dean whispers to Cas,
“Hold on, sorry,” Dean says in annoyance. Cas nods in understanding, running one of his hands up and down Dean’s thigh, thumb occasionally running in circles. The called ID says “Sam”. He raises the phone to his ear “What?”
had done to your brother?” Cas grows tense from the nickname. “And you didn’t tell me?” He turns back around to the couple, looking at Dean. “I always knew you were gonna end up a
Cas brings him into a hug. “I’ll be there right beside you, alright? If you ever need any reassurance, you can send me a prayer or squeeze my hand, anything.”
