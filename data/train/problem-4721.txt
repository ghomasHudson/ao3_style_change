A second later, the helmet’s eyes flickered white, and everyone jumped as a projection of Tony suddenly appeared on the floor in front of them, resting against a wall, looking straight forward. Steve stared at it in anguish. Tony was… beat. His eyes sunken, skin greyish even through the projection. And he was thin. Oh god, now Steve was looking, he was really really fucking thin—
“Right! When do we get to do presents?” Clint asked the room, clapping his hands and then slow-motion punching Tony in the face, because he was a five-year-old.
“Nah- just wanted… a change of scene,” he said softly, before rolling his eyes and nodding over to Thor, who was happily braiding Bruce’s strands of hair. “Also, Thor’s banned from actually leaving the building at all during school hours after they caught him doing his work up a tree rather than in class, so the quad’s not an option.”
The wall of the jet was a dark grey and there were thirty-seven panels from top to bottom. Every now and then, one of the agents sat next to him would cough a little, like he had a chest infection. Steve thought his name might be Agent Leonards- his face, although mostly shrouded by Tac gear, was familiar. He wondered whether the man had a family—whether he was going to go home tonight and be surrounded by the people he loved; welcome them in with open arms. Or maybe he would be alone. Most agents on SHIELD’s payroll tended to be solitary people. It made things less difficult if there was no one around to hurt.
It started on any regular old afternoon, as those things usually did. It’d been a few days since their last fight with the most recent batch of aliens who’d come down to Earth looking for control, so they weren’t even arguing about the battle. It had been about the fucking
They kept talking until the icecream dripped down their fingers and melted completely. Steve found himself caught up in Tony so easily; in his stories and his voice, and the way his hands moved when he spoke. He looked so different to how he’d been when Steve found him an hour ago. Some of the life had come back to his eyes. It was stupid, but Steve felt proud. He wanted to make Tony smile more. Properly. He had a beautiful smile.
He wiped at his face, realising that his eyes were watering. Stupid. Stupid, he’d messed it all up. Now Steve was going to think he was just like everyone else and break up with him, and then all their other friends would take Steve’s side, obviously, and Tony would be alone again. What did he expect though, to be honest—it was inevitable he’d screw it all up eventually. He’d just thought that he might have been able to get some more time in before that.
Steve leaned back against the headboard as his friends shuffled closer, eyes wide and curious. “He was…” Steve waved a hand, looking up to the ceiling and desperately trying to keep his cheeks from getting hot, “he was everything I’d thought he would be.”
Sighing, he drained the contents in one and then crumpled the cup, dropping it on the floor. He was fucking tiny, so hopefully that would work pretty fast and loosen him up. He just wanted to have fun- he hadn’t felt that sensation in a very long time.
Luckily, the problem was solved for him. As he stood there and pondered, there was a staticky noise for a second, and then suddenly he heard the sound of a mechanism clicking. That must have been Tony, from wherever he was in the building.
Steve just nodded, feeling more than a little blissed-out as Tony kissed him lightly on the nose and then backed up, tripping clumsily over a bunch of stray wires as he went. He looked down and kicked them absently, blushing a little as he turned back to Steve. “I am actually cool, you know,” he stated with a wave of his hand, “people don’t just think that for no reason. I am. I am totally… suave and charming and-“
Well. Hopefully by that point, Tony would be well on his way to escape, so it wouldn’t be a problem. Not for him, at the very least.
Bucky eyed him for an extra moment. “Because I know we’re technically on good terms now, but I’ll still go over there and punch him if you w-“
He heard Natasha snort to his left and turned, a betrayed look on his face. She just flipped her choppy hair out of her face and then placed a hand on her heart. “Oh, yeah, definitely ‘just friends’. He just found you in the cafeteria on Monday because he was ‘hiding’, suuure. And your little tickling match thing on the bench right next to me? Suuuure, you’re just friends.”
Pushing his card in the door and opening it with a sophisticated swish, Steve slipped through quietly, shaking off his hair as he did so to try and dislodge some of the raindrops. He was wearing a SHIELD uniform after his Cap one had been destroyed, and it felt a little too tight, a little uncomfortable. It obviously hadn’t been designed by someone who knew his body as intimately as Tony did- knew the lines and divots he’d traced with his hands countless times.
“Tony,” Steve mumbled- and by that point, the light had disappeared from the room and the world was in darkness, evening falling like a blanket over the hospital where Steve was being kept for observation, “Tony, sweetheart, go to sleep.”
“No,” Tony reached out a hand, grabbing Steve by the shirtsleeve as he shook his head and then winced when it obviously hurt the array of injuries, “no… can’t.”
When he went back into the living room five minutes later with his stack of food, he saw Bucky with his legs thrown over Tony’s lap and casually watching TV as Tony himself just sat up straight and tried not to let his eyes fall shut with the exhaustion. Steve smiled in fond exasperation; a minute longer, and Tony was just going to keel over.
The beam dropped a little when he actually spotted his husband, stood with his arms out underneath the toddler that was hung precariously on the kitchen-lights.
Steve shook his head, a watery smile forming on his face as he stared at Tony. Wonderful, beautiful, genius Tony. “Not at all,” he said, voice scratchy and rasping. He figured he probably looked a sight right then; puffy red eyes, tear stained & blotchy face, hair sticking up on all ends.
“To be fair, Clint kind of deserved it. He was trying to get a rise out of you, you know that,” Tony rolled his eyes, gently running his fingers across Steve’s knuckles.
Tony sat up gingerly, taking a piece of toast and tearing off a small corner before putting it in his mouth. He winced again. Steve figured anything that involved moving his face wasn’t going to feel too great just then.
This was just a sham though. This was Steve offloading all the emotions he’d carried with him, using it as a way to bring Tony’s guard down. It wasn’t real, and it couldn’t ever be. Because in that year that Steve had imagined those scenarios, Tony had destroyed villages and stolen Weapons of Mass Destruction and got himself on SHIELD’s Most Wanted list. Steve didn’t know how, or why, but what he knew was that the man in front of him was a
“I’M NOT DATING STEVE, JESUS FUCKIN’ CHRIST!” Bucky cut in loudly, waving his hands through the air with finality, “Tony, I’ve never dated Steve!
“Some things are out of my control,” JARVIS responded, and Steve had forgotten he’d even asked a question until he heard the answer what felt like a lifetime later, “and I will regret that for the rest of my existence.” His words resonated, and their sorrow sat, as still and poignant as the final note in a ballad. Steve wished JARVIS had a physical form that he could turn his back on, but the computer was everywhere. He was as inescapable as this new world that Steve was now trapped in, the world without Tony. “But Captain, you must know that I will not allow another human under my care to come to harm when I
See, one day Steve would work out how to respond to things like that. He knew Tony used nicknames for everyone, but it still sent something short-circuiting in his head whenever he heard it directed his way. Like the first time they’d spoken outside the principal’s office and Steve had almost fallen into the door in response.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve shrugged, “he’s gotten the cops in on it, I think. They’re gonna press charges according to Principal Fury. But I’ll deal with it as it comes. It’ll be okay.”
“Fuck,” he managed to say, which caught the attention of Bruce, who was sat on the floor next to Tony’s head. The man shifted and turned to him, a weary smile on his face.
It was understandable, to be fair. Steve really wasn’t much. And Tony… well, he quite obviously was. Steve had always known that, from the very first moment of meeting him. Tony was loud and bright and colorful and explosive and he
“There could be a reasonable explanation for this,” Tony said, pushing back the voice that kept saying
For the first time since meeting him, he watched Tony Stark sputter and look genuinely shocked. “What? Don’t be stupid, Steve, it’s on me.”
Steve pulled a face. “Course I do,” he muttered, “wouldn’t have fallen in love with you if I didn’t.”
“Rhodey, it’s not his fault,” Carol said, shooting Steve an apologetic look, “I think they were all just stressed out and worried- but I agree that you need to talk to them. That wasn’t right.”
"Oh, what are you gonna fucking do?" The other guy- Zeke- taunted, "you gonna hit me? Or just throw daddy's money at me and hope I go away? Contrary to popular belief, Stark, you don't actually own the school, and I sure as shit am not afraid of you."
with it,” he said softly, trailing his fingers around the edge of Steve’s collar. He felt Steve’s hand curl automatically around his waist. “Horror movies are just… y’know. Fun.”
Eventually, Thor just huffed and dropped the joint, stepping on it under his foot. “Fucking hate the rain,” he muttered quietly.
“We could time travel,” he said in the end, voice soft, “Tony, do you know what that… if what Natasha’s saying is right, we could—”
to deal with,” Sam muttered from the corner of the room, but he looked fond as he cast a glance to Steve, “I’m begging you man, put a sign on the door when you start fucking, I don’t wanna be dealing with that-“
The three of them stood slowly, looking at Steve and Bruce as they backed out of the room. Nat stopped at the door, her curls flicking into her face as she turned to look back at the Principal.
“Whoah whoah whoah whoah whoah-“ Bucky raised his hands, frown marking his face as he turned to Steve, “you were drinking last night?”
His HUD picked up the compound a second later, half covered with permafrost and tucked away at the bottom of the biggest mountain. Steve was somewhere in there. Or at least, Tony was praying he was somewhere in there. He was just running on the hope that whatever they’d done with him, they’d done it here and not transferred him somewhere else. In this wasteland, trying to hunt him down would be damn near impossible.
Steve worked as carefully as he could whilst Tony hissed and made distressed noises at the sting of the antiseptic against his open wounds. Steve imagined the cuts had to have been caused by some sort of heavy ring that Howard had been wearing; unless he’d gotten an elbow in, in which case it was lucky Tony was still conscious at all. Elbows were lethal.
Tony’s beam was getting steadily wider, and Steve curled his hand around the back of his neck, fingers running through his dark hair and pulling him in an inch closer. “So is that… is that, like, confirmation? Is that—do you—”
“Damn right it will,” Tony muttered, still smiling, “‘m gonna take a selfie and send it to CERN- I hate those stuck up assholes.”
“It’s me, Tony.” There was a distant laugh, “I’m here, and the others are on their way. Just hold on.”
The quiet that time was long. Steve stared very, very intently at the wall on the other side. He refused to look at Tony, whose eyes had fixed themselves to the side of his face.
The boy looked nervous again. Steve noticed that his ears were going a little pink. Yet again, Steve marveled at the complete 180 Tony’s personality made when he wasn’t performing for everyone. This was barely even recognizable to the boy he saw wandering the corridors or smoking a cigarette whilst stood on top of the principal’s desk just to make a statement.
“It’s all I could think about,” he said quietly, voice shaking, “this whole week, I’ve just been… over and over and over in my head, and then I walk in this afternoon and suddenly I’m
No. No, that couldn’t be true, they hadn’t had a chance to…  they’d been supposed to come to sort of conclusion. They’d been supposed to find some peace, even if it wasn’t the sort of peace that Steve had been craving. Anything at all would have been better than… than Tony dying, fighting a battle on his own on the other side of the world. That had never been how things were supposed to go. It was supposed to be
They all sat together, watching as the shadow of Principal Fury as it drew nearer to the door. When he opened it, all of them looked into the man’s cold face. His eyes met with Steve, and there was a deep sinking feeling in his gut as a bit of that adrenaline and rage wore off, reminded him of what he’d just gone and done.
Fury felt something inside him go stiff, a tension building in his shoulders. He had little reason to react like that, but there was something in the simplicity of the words that shook him. Rogers offered no other explanation. No excuse. Just the video attachment.
Steve’s hands stroked across his shoulder blades in a soothing motion, and he slowly rocked the two of them back and forth. Tony just sat there, hating himself, his hands curled tightly into Steve’s bare waist as he forced himself not to break, to sob. Neither of them needed that just then, Jesus.
Tony nodded, glancing back down to the tablet full of information in front of him. Scans of his own brain stared back up at him, bright and disconcerting. He fisted his hands against the sheets and clenched his jaw.
Tony blinked once, rapidly trying to re-evaluate the situation. “Huh?” He said, eloquent as ever, “then what was with all of the…” Tony waved his hands absently, “getting mad when the team talked made all the ‘big happy family’ jokes? Why do you always look at me funny when I’m holding him?”
He felt a familiar sense of déjà vu as the fucking material got stuck over his head, and with his ribs suddenly starting to scream in pain at the stretching, ended with him tangled up in his own goddamn T-shirt.
Steve breathed in sharply through his nose, looking at Bruce closely for a few more moments before nodding. “How’s he doing?” he asked quietly.
It was about ten minutes later when Paul Wilson knocked on the door off the office, his face tight and his eyes falling on Steve’s bruised face with such a look of tiredness about him that Steve wanted to sink through the floor. He tuned out as Fury reeled off the events and then gave Mr. Wilson the usual procedure regarding a suspension. When the talk was over, Mr. Wilson led Steve out of the building without a word, getting quietly into the car and waiting for Steve to slip into the passenger seat.
“Jarvis had been driving her out to pick me up from school,” Tony continued, and Steve heard the way his voice flattened out; felt the tremble in his fingers. “They wouldn’t have… I didn’t even need to, not really- could’ve walked. Could’ve got a lift. But I- we were supposed to spend the day together and I just thought-“
God—he just wanted to make sure Tony wouldn’t do something he’d regret. Steve had made sure not to react to Tony’s words, but hell, the man’s admission earlier had scared him.  Tony was without doubt the strongest man that Steve knew, but sometimes the amount of responsibilities piled up on his plate would be enough to topple God himself. Steve just wanted to help.
Steve just looked at his daughter and pulled a face, which was quickly replicated by her. “It smells super funny,” she whispered, and Steve held back a laugh as he nodded and glanced over at a betrayed Tony.
"Actually, I do feel pretty damn concerned," Steve told him, eyeing him up and down, "you look ready to keel over. You're fucking lucky I pulled you out of that fight- like this, he probably would have kicked your ass."
“What? No, Tony, what the fuck?” Steve burst incredulously. He couldn't help but wonder what kind of fucking people Tony hung out with to make him so quick to use money to try and stop them from spilling his secrets. “I don’t want you money. I won’t tell anyone. I promise.”
“No one gives more of a shit than you do, love,” Steve told him firmly, “everyone knows that. Pepper knows that. That’s why she let me convince her to cancel all your meetings and whisk you away to the middle of bumfuck nowhere for a relaxing retreat. If you want, of course,” he added with haste, glancing off to the side as Tony simply looked at him in confusion.
Bucky turned, grinning at Steve’s smug face and jogging over to him. “Tony says he’s got it sorted. Should be out in a few seconds.”
“I think you’re missing the point there, Mr. Wilson.” Steve’s voice turned a tad sharper as he realised what Sam’s father was implying, but the man didn’t waver.
They were both laughing as they wandered into the living room and made themselves comfortable- Bucky laying on Natasha’s lap, and Steve laying on Bucky’s. Around him, his friends lay buried in blankets or huddled up to the radiators- all except Thor, who was sat cross-legged in the center of the room and watching cartoons on Nat’s TV avidly, apparently not caring for the cold.
Tony’s hands slipped on the coffee machine, and he hissed as the hot metal brushed his skin. “Well,” he began through a stutter, “well, that’s… that’s why we should probably keep him in other rooms more regularly, isn’t it?”
Of course Steve wouldn’t like it. The more Tony thought about it, the more he could see it. The costumes, the movies, the candy- it was all just a sham. They wore the fake teeth and made themselves look pale and then in the morning, they took it off and went back to hating the real vampires just as much as they had before. The party-goers all dressed up like slutty versions of real people, who they would then refuse to let into the very same bars where the Baseliners were partying in. Jesus, Tony hadn’t even considered it, but he remembered that there were little kids who  got dressed up to be Hunters and one little kid who pretended to be some sort of Unhuman, presumably to act as the hunted. Tony had given them Halloween candy last year and thought nothing of it.
They looked at one another for a moment, the silence stretching out, and then Steve nodded jerkily and turned to go. “Thank you for letting me st—”
“Of course I want to marry you,” he finished up what he’d been going to say before Tony could lose himself in his quickly spiralling thoughts, and watched Tony go completely still in front of him, “that’s… that’s not even a question, Tony. I just… I just don’t know why you would want to. After everything I’ve done.” His voice wobbled toward the end, full of guilt as the memories flashed back through his head once more. Images of blood, of Tony’s pale face, broken and bruised under his hands. It wasn’t real. Steve could see from looking at Tony’ face that it wasn’t.
“—A good man,” Steve finished quietly, swallowing down the lump in his throat. He looked at his sketch again, thinking of all the experiments that had been done to Bucky before they’d made their escape. Thinking of the lack of a corpse, even though they’d looked for weeks and weeks, Steve putting all his considerable sway into getting a search party out there and helping.
“And that’ll put a black mark on your record for the rest of your life.” Mr. Wilson sighed, lips pursing. “You’re a smart kid, Steve. But you’re
Steve pursed his lips and kept his head down as he rolled out of the break room with Tony hidden in the garbage disposal compartment of the janitor trolley. His cap covered his face, hands gripping tight to the handle, and he casually made his way over to the elevator which was stationed a few corridors away. Tony had informed him that only the first two floors’ worth of windows were bulletproofed to cut spending, which meant that they only had to travel two floors up without being detected. That was totally doable. Everyone was far too busy wondering why they’d just been put into lockdown to care about some nightshift janitor going about his business.
Steve just kept walking. He had a job to do now. And nothing on hell or Earth was going to stop him.
Tony slowly looks up and met Steve’s eyes. “ I just… want people to care, Steve. They don’… they don’ care, not really. You care, because y’r team leader ‘n’ you gotta care. My love has always been paid for, y’see, Stevie. Always.” He laughed, shutting his eyes and allowing himself the guilty pleasure of Steve’s hands on his face, just for a second.
As he walked over, the more logical part of him was telling him to just let it go, keep walking- Tony wasn’t… he wasn’t
“Don’t quote Lana at me right now, that’ll just make me even more depressed.” He knew as soon as Tony’s face fell that he’d said the wrong thing, and internally kicked himself. Tony had been smiling, if somewhat weakly, and now he was back to looking miserable. “Ignore that, I didn’t mean it like—”
But he couldn’t. So he waited for Thor instead, listening to Tony try and call him from the other room. He was frustrated, angry, cursing a blue streak when Steve didn’t respond, but Steve held his ground. Waited another 74 seconds for Thor to walk around the corner before throwing himself onto his feet and then lurching over to the door, completely beside himself with the need to just
He turned his head back to the door and took the beginnings of a step forward, hand reaching toward a chair he could jam under the handle, but of course, it was in that moment that the door chose to open in one fluid motion. Steve watched it, his brain confused for a fraction of a second— and that was what became his downfall. That fraction of surprise, the lack of reaction.
The door of the room slammed shut, and Steve resisted the urge to yell into the emptiness in frustration as he stormed down the corridor. Goddamn it, why did he fucking
But it wasn’t enough. Thanos was too strong. With a deep growl, the Titan threw Steve off his back, sending him hurtling into unforgiving rock and then finishing it with a punch to the face. Steve’s vision swam and the world blackened for a few moments as he faded out of consciousness.
Steve shrugged. He… had arranged a cab. But at some point between entering the place and getting to this kitchen, it seemed he no longer had any money in his jacket. “I’ll work something out.”
He launched himself forward once more. The voice was weary and faint, trembling. He was pretty sure it was Rhodey, and the man sounded injured. He couldn’t see much, but the orange flames from the tree that had somehow caught fire cast a faint shadow across the slope, and he spotted a tiny wooden cabin tucked in at the centre of it all. He moved in that direction, gun raised, calling the names of his friends once more.
“I’m getting out of there soon,” he promised quietly, “and then I’m going to take you everywhere, Steve, I promise.”
“Right,” Tony said with a  few rapid blinks, “and that’s why he’s currently holding me in a bridal carry and refusing to let go?”
without having planned more than two days in advance,” Sam said, wiping tears from his eyes as he shook his head, “did you hear Piledriver yelling about how they were unstoppable?”
Steve didn’t say anything, and Tony mentally fucking cursed himself. He always overshared- every fucking time. Peter was still preoccupied with slathering bubbles against the side of the tub, and Tony watched him intently, even as he felt Steve slowly move to his side and then sit on the floor next to him so that their shoulders brushed. “Tony?” He asked, his hand settling against Tony’s and squeezing gently, “look at me, sweetheart?”
Tony smiled, letting a hand rest on Steve’s shoulder, massaging the surprisingly knotted muscles there. “Want me to make you another one, get you really hooked on the stuff?”
“Stop apologizing,” Steve told him, kissing his cheek softly, “it was a panic response to a bad situation.” He paused, biting his lip a little. “I think it’s something that we do need to talk about, though.”
The boy reached over the table and offered his hand. Slightly more wary now, Steve returned the motion- but nothing cracked or was otherwise maimed, and he sighed in relief.
He saw Tony looking at him as he opened the door to class. Watched the way he stared unembarrassedly over his friends' shoulders from the other side of the hall. There was a second where Tony frowned and then opened his mouth, making to move- but Steve had pushed through the door and left the corridor before Tony could even take a step.
Two: He needed to try and fix this before it got too out of hand and he managed to lose Steve for good. The thought of that was unimaginable and he could not let that happen.
3 separate detentions, not to mention failing all his goddamn exams, but… but the sense of being overwhelmed wasn’t really coming.
Steve turned to him, and Sam’s father just shook his head. “I’ll drive you there,” he said firmly, eyes going back to the road ahead of them. “I… I didn’t know, Steve. I’m sorry. It just feels like trouble surrounds that boy, and we only want the best for you. We know it’s been so difficult, and we were never expecting everything to be plain sailing, but—”
“I’m broken, Steve,” Tony whispered into his neck, even when Steve just shook his head violently, “and not in a way I’m sure can be fixed. You have to… being with you, being around you- it’s selfish, and I’m gonna hurt you, I know I am-“
of his own clothes, everyone probably would have just let it slide. Tony honestly hadn’t done it intentionally- he was just tired and a little shaken from the lovely morning nightmare that had served as his wakeup call, and Steve’s clothes were soft and big and smelt really nice.
That threw Steve for a loop. “I thought Nat was rich,” he said dumbly, thinking back to her well-furnished apartment and all the nice clothes she wore.
“Mom!” Sam groaned, “does Steve look like that type of guy who’s gonna start smoking in the bathrooms to you?”
“I don’t think he can help it,” Natasha said, and when Steve looked over to her, she was smiling softly, “pretty sure you’re irrevocably drawn toward chaos, aren’t you?”
Underneath his cowl, Steve just grinned. “Widow, your victim is dying over there.” He thrust a hand to the other side of the hall, where Clint was lying face-down on one of the mock-up buildings.
As he stood up to put his bowl in the sink, he looked down just in time to see Sam’s hand wrapping around his bony elbow.
“Okay,” Tony mumbled, shuffling forward with jelly limbs and feeling Steve automatically open up for him, his hands curling very gently around Tony’s shoulders, warming him up immediately. The towel worked gently through his hair, and Tony’s neck wasn’t wet any more, he realised vaguely. The water had gone.
Steve himself decided he should probably start looking for a cab rather than just standing around watching Tony, so he glanced into the road and held up a hand. “One week,” he agreed with a nod, “I love you t—”
Again, though, Bucky seemed not to mind- just took it with a fond look on his face. He was completely head over heels, the poor boy. “I love it when you steal things for me, you lawless evil demon,” he leaned in and kissed her again, and everyone just rolled their eyes.
Above him, Tony waited a second to make sure Steve was definitely out before sitting back a little. “Kind of anticlimactic,” he said, taking in a small breath of air and loosening his grip on Steve’s shoulders. “He definitely out?”
Clint was the only one to acknowledge any of it all. Steve wasn’t stupid; he knew that Clint had a knife stashed up his sleeve, in the same way that Natasha had the day before. He knew Steve knew, too, because as soon as he clocked Steve looking at it, he sighed. It was late into the night, and Tony was sleeping peacefully in the bed in front of them. “I know this is horrible,” Clint told him quietly, “I know this is hurting you. Watching us do this. I couldn’t imagine what it must be like.”
Almost instantly the rest of the group, which previously had been looking for all intents and purposes as if they were minding their own business, suddenly broke out into roars and cheers, and Tony rolled his eyes fondly and smiled against Steve’s mouth as they kissed one another, slow and relieving, like a deep breath of crisp air. It was chaste, and they pulled away a few seconds later, but Steve remained close and they both laughed when they caught each other’s eyes, and their foreheads bumped as they chuckled. Clint said something crass across the table, then yelped in pain when Natasha undoubtedly punched him in the balls with the arm that wasn’t broken. A second later, and Thor asked if they were allowed to eat yet or whether they were going to have to wait for Steve and Tony to finish their moment. Bruce told him to be quiet and put something on his plate that wasn’t just a mountain of turkey.
Steve pulled his eyes open and looked up, stifling a yawn with his hand. He probably looked like shit: his hair was all over the place, and Tony’s jacket had undoubtedly left creases all over his cheek- but still, Tony was looking at him with that soft, open look in his eyes, and it sent the now-familiar buzz of butterflies shooting down his stomach and into the tips of his toes, making them curl under his socks. Tony grinned down at him, and his fingers tugged playfully at the horizontal piece of Steve’s bangs that refused to lay flat. “You have never looked hotter, Steve,” he declared quietly, a playful gleam to his eyes.
Steve couldn't help feel sorry for him. Despite the fact he'd brought it on himself, he could imagine the feeling of whatever Tony had taken leaving his system was not a pleasant one.
It became so stunningly, blindingly obvious in that moment that he simply refused to believe that he hadn’t seen it before. It was impossible- he was Tony Stark, he always noticed these things. Always always always.
Tony happily zoned out for a good long time, allowing the film to give him an excuse to let his brain take a breather for a moment. Steve’s body was warm underneath him, and his arms curled gently across Tony’s stomach, grounding him firmly. By his feet, Clint was sat against the couch, and Bruce had taken residence next to Thor on the armchair that was really far too small for two people. Pepper and Natasha took the loveseat as they did every week. All in all, it was pretty domestic- not something Tony could have said he’d have desired a few years back, but now something he would happily have given up the world for.
That same person pinned him, and Steve lashed out wildly. He could feel himself screaming, desperately attempting to push his attacker off- he had to get back, he was running out of time, Tony was
“Probably,” Tony shrugged, and then one of his friends took hold of his shoulder and started tugging him backward, undoubtedly to the back exit where they’d all go for a quick smoke.
“Shut up, grumpy sod,” Peggy poked him with her foot and rolled her eyes, “he’s happy, look at him.”
“It appears so,” JARVIS responded, sounding weary, “he has been conscious for 78 hours, by my count.”
Steve looked scandalised. “But… but it’s Tony!” He said in confusion- like that was supposed to make people care.
“I…” Steve stumbled, trying to think of what to say to try and fix this, to try and not be such a stupid fucking idiot, “I’m really sorry, I forgot completely-”
He just so happened to pull up into the school parking lot at that moment, and Steve took the chance God had given him to get the fuck out of there before Bucky killed him. “Oh look we’ve arrived, thanks Buck, see you later!” He laughed loudly and undid his seatbelt, opening the door just as Bucky began pulling up on the curb. He fell out of the still-moving vehicle with a slight stumble, laughing even harder as Bucky stuck his middle finger up at him through the open passenger door.
“- ‘if we wanted to ever have free time to play outside after school, we’d sit in his class and not say a word for the rest of the week’,” Sam piped up, a wry smile on his face as he shot a look over to Steve, “I was in that damn class. Honestly, it was the funniest day of my life. Tony, uh- he decided to kill two birds with one stone, get everyone to come up with him to the roof and ‘get their share of fresh air before the detention started’. Everyone worked together- best show of teamwork I’ve ever seen, I swear. We moved all of it. Every last poster and table and cabinet, and just put it all up on the roof. When they finally found us, Tony was at the front of the class teaching.” Sam burst out into laughter then, shoulders shrugging as he made a vague gesture with his hands. “But hey, we were all being very quiet. Come to think of it, I think I learned more in that lesson than I did during the whole term with that teacher.”
His hand curled around Tony’s; finger tracing feather-light against the slightly faded gold band Tony wore. “Go back to sleep, darling,” he whispered, shutting his own eyes even as he said it.
And Steve had laughed- a lovely throaty thing that made Tony smile just from hearing it. “Uhhh, I don’t know? It depends on a lot of variables. If it were in a park, maybe- but here? Tony would beat you hands-down. He knows every nook and cranny of this tower, you wouldn’t stand a chance.”
Peter grinned right back at him, and a second later he was off, stumbling through the battlefield with a happy cry of ‘Mister Stark!’
“Why?” Tony’s voice was throaty and hoarse, and his mouth was moving before he even thought about saving face and stopping it. “Not like you’d all be missing much if you left.”
And of course, in response to Steve’s sudden surge of affections, Peter had gotten the chance to properly bond with him for the first time, leading to instant attachment—predictable, really, seeing as it was Steve and he was impossible not to fall in love with, no matter what age you were. Peter now asked Steve to pick him up for cuddles as well as Tony, he always crawled over to Steve on the couch (probably because the guy was a human heater and Peter, much like Tony, was attracted to the warmth of his cuddles) and, obviously, Steve absolutely doted on him in return. They were adorable together, and sometimes when Tony saw Steve holding Peter up to eye level in his huge hands and brush their noses together just to watch the little boy giggle, he had to do a double take in order to not think about how similar the two of them looked.
It was still shocking, sometimes, to turn around and see the empty shirtsleeve where his husband’s right arm should have been. But Tony was taking it like a champ, and already designing a prosthetic that was slick enough to work just as well, if not better, than an average arm. Because of course he was. That was just Tony Stark. Time travel in a night, Infinity Gauntlet in an evening.
But Thor just smiled, like he understood. “You? Being organized? God, she must have been a scary woman.”
to, but you are absolutely insane if you think I have the self restraint to keep my hands to myself if I am in the same bed as you.” Tony sighed, shaking his head sadly. “I am only human, Steven.”
“He’s right, Steve,” Rhodey told him gently. His voice sounded sad, weary. “I know the feeling. But you can’t carry the weight of all his problems on your back. You just have to… try and help him. Look, do you want me to go over there-“
“I’m sorry,” Tony cut in hurriedly, a new train of thought apparently jumping into his mind, “sorry, god, I just realised how stupid it was to say that here, now. You’re all— all mentally fucked up by HYDRA. You don’t have to answer, Steve, I’m sorry. Just—”
, I didn’t—I never meant—” His breath hitched shakily as he drew his hands up to his face and shielded himself from Steve. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m fucking pathetic, s’all my fault, I—”
Tony, who Steve loved more than anyone else. Who had always, always trusted Steve without hesitation; who’d fallen countless times into Steve’s arms with no worry about Steve hurting him with his strength, knowing and understanding that Steve was powerful enough to do whatever he wanted, but believing that Steve never would.
“Don’t let anyone else sit on your right,” he felt himself whisper, which he felt, somehow, was not what he had been intending on saying.
They walked up the drive, shoulders brushing until they reached the step.  Tony knocked three times with the toe of his boot, and then turned to Steve, opening his mouth-
“This is very… steampunk,” he said, turning along with the curve of the stairs until coming to the bottom, “I’m digging it-oh, wow.”
“Reaching destination, preparing landing,” JARVIS informed him, and Tony felt the suit slow, arc downward into the centre of a threatening-looking mountain range. This was a good fifty miles away from the last HYDRA base Tony had visited in Siberia—did these guys just enjoy setting up camp in this fucking hellscape? It was ridiculous. Tony needed to set up some sort of surveillance over this area if it was so fucking popular with terrorists.
Ty spotted him just a moment too late; turning his head toward the moving figure just as Steve’s elbow connected with his face, right in the spot where Tony had gotten him yesterday.
That was the way Steve must see him, sometimes. And if he asked, he was well aware Steve would disagree, tell him
, he couldn’t move, it was all happening too fast and he knew that usually it wouldn’t be a problem for him to keep up, but
God. Steve felt like he was being an idiot, trying to absolve Tony of any blame just because of his personal investment. He was a damn SHIELD agent. He needed to act like one and listen to Fury’s advice.
Of course Tony wanted to help. Of course he did. Barely even able to walk, and it was the person who’d put him in that state that he was more worried about than himself. That was… that was the most Tony Stark thing Steve had ever heard. He sat on the floor like while Bruce watched over him, just listening to the sound of Tony’s voice through the thin walls. His sounded desperate, voice cracking as he asked Clint to go get Steve again.
He turned his head, looking at Tony’s mop of loose curls. Tony felt the movement, and his hands squeezed just that little bit tighter around Steve’s stomach.
He shook his head and just smiled, despite the nagging his friends subjected him to in order to try and make him spill. He couldn’t explain it without them wondering
Tony shrugged, looking away again. “I thought you were worth it,” he admitted, voice quiet and uneven. “I guess… that was it, at the end of the day. You were worth it.”
Peter burbled happily, sucking at a piece of lego as he looked up at Tony through his startling blue eyes. They reminded him of Steve quite a lot, if he was being honest. Tony frowned and then tugged it out, pulling a face at the saliva coating it. “Ugh, gross. Hey Steve!”
Tony seemed to like it though, because when he glanced back at Steve, this time with a toothbrush in his mouth, he glanced upward at it and then laughed fondly, his eyes shining with affection. “Y’r ‘dorable,” he declared messily.
Tony said nothing for a moment, and then he breathed out heavily. “Wow. You’re good at speeches, Steve, anyone ever tell you that?” When Tony looked up, he was smiling brightly, his eyes wet. “I’m glad you found a home, Steve. And—and I’m glad I found you, too. I don’t think you know how much.”
The rational part of Tony’s brain was absolutely aware that there was nothing he needed to be safe from- apart from perhaps himself- but the irrational, scared corner of Tony’s brain just sighed with relief, and he felt himself reach a shuddering hand out blindly, finding Steve’s body close to him and sensing the warmth there. Captain America.
It had been seven days since Steve and Tony had decided to finally adopt the 3 year old spider-kid they’d found looking desperately for a home, 2 days since Tony had left said spider-kid in steve’s care in order to go for an emergency business meeting, and 6 hours since the rest of the team had decided to go into hiding in order to avoid parenting duties.
Bucky nodded, patting him on the shoulder. “Coupl’a scrapes from having to haul your ass back from that ledge, but nothing serious. I’m good, Stevie.”
Steve sighed, beginning to take a few tentative steps forward and trying not to crush various objects that littered the floor. “Honey, how long has it been since you got a good rest?”
Tony had no idea what it was that Steve had dreamt of, but he still knew exactly what to say to make it better. The gestures felt almost familiar- Steve supposed this must be what Tony did when he had nightmares whilst they slept together. The thought warmed him, even in the cold of the night. Tony must… he really cared.
HYDRA. Brainwashing. Some panicking upon waking up. Well, a lot of panicking, really. His whole conversation with Tony—
Steve was silent. They didn’t have long left. How was he supposed to finish…all of this? Everything he had meant to say, every argument and confession they’d meant to have together- it was never going to happen. And Steve couldn’t decide what words were most important now.
Scrambling unsteadily to his feet, he gasped in a lungful of air and ran. Ran forward, to Thor, to Tony- who was being let down gently, searching the deck, looking for-
“He’s going to fly straight off the rails,” Steve finished quietly, thinking back to when he’d first met Tony, and he and Bucky and Peggy had gone searching his name on the internet. He could still see the headline that they’d dug up; a fuzzy image of the boy Steve loved, barely even 15, lying unconscious on a table surrounded by partying strangers. The arrest records, the drug charges, God, they couldn’t let Tony go down that road again.
Against his ass, Steve snored loudly enough that Tony felt it vibrate up his butt. He wondered how this had become his life.
As soon he’d dropped, he was being pulled into Steve’s arms, wrapping tightly around him in a way he hadn’t felt properly for almost a month, and had missed like the air he breathed.
Beside Steve, he watched Thor’s face as it cracked. “So our friend is dead because this man could not handle his own grief,” he snarled, anger layered over his mourning. Thor and Tony had always been close. “Now Steve is in the exact same place because that fucking scumbag wanted—”
“What are we supposed to do now?” Tony asked dumbly, looking up at the other man and waving his hand, “do you think that’s all he’s capable of?”
Tony listened to them all silently, trying to find a way to add something to the conversation. But then he thought about how that would probably be rude and obvious and kind of pathetic, and he didn’t want any of the team to get pissed. Anyway, the only way he could add anything was by changing the subject to something he was involved in, which was just selfish, really.
Steve blinked a few times. Peter stared at him intently, skinny arms folded expectantly like he was waiting for Steve to say something. When he didn’t, Peter sighed.
“Steve Rogers, you better walk that ass out of the door in the next ten seconds or I am going to give you my saddest, most pained looking face and
Bucky nodded and sighed. “I’ll make it up to you,” he turned to Steve and put on his most sincere face. “I’ll even apologize to Stark. That’s how much I mean it. Everything will work itself out, I’ll make sure of it”
“It’s nice though, right?” Steve asked slightly cautiously—the last thing he wanted was for Tony to get annoyed by being here—but Tony just shook his head and then stumbled into his hold, hands wrapping around the back of Steve’s waist as he buried his face into Steve’s chest.
“He’s gone to get some food from the canteen, he’ll be back in a minute,” Bucky told him, taking his arm and leading him back inside, “you need to lie down until then, buddy, okay- Thor hit you pretty hard.”
Steve just shook his head in fond amusement; placing Tony down at his side of the bed and then pulling the covers over him. “Close your eyes, love- it’ll still be spinning in the morning.”
Tony was talking too much, trying to fill the horrible void between them with words about anything and everything he could think of. Steve wasn’t talking enough, too busy thinking over every word he wanted to say and wondering how Tony would take it. He felt the rest of the team’s eyes on them constantly- they couldn’t help it and they were doing it to try and make up for all that they’d missed before, but every time Steve saw them watching him he just wanted to throw up again. He hadn’t slept in days, and he knew that Tony hadn’t either. Whether that was because Steve was there, or just because he couldn’t, Steve didn’t know. But every time he suggested he leave, Tony panicked and began to apologize again, and it shattered Steve’s resolve every single time. He couldn’t leave knowing Tony blamed himself for this. He just couldn’t.
“You know, hair-petting isn’t like some magical cure-all,” Tony informed her, which would have been a strong argument had she not in that moment curled her fingers just behind his ear and caused an involuntary hum of appreciation to fall from his mouth. “Although I suppose it helps a little bit,” he conceded through a mumble.
Steve pulled a face. “He’s with his dad,” he muttered, sharing a small look with Thor before turning back to the others, “don’t think he’s gonna be able to get out any time soon.”
They were silent as Tony led them through into the kitchen, his hand on Steve’s arm an almost burning heat. It was all so absurd. Everything Steve had spent so long tucking away into a tightly-packed corner of his mind was now threatening to spill right out again; every repressed emotion and aching need flashing across his periphery. But he kept his face empty of any of that, focusing on keeping the worry and fear there instead. He
, Tony. Without you, we would have fallen to bits a long time ago.” His face twisted in pain and he bit his lip. “Why would you think that we would ever,
Tony kept his glare for a moment, staring at Steve, the last attempt to fight off an emotional conversation he didn’t want to have. Steve, of course, didn’t waver. He never had, and Tony didn’t think he ever would. Not when it came to things like this.
Tony let his eyes fall shut again, leaning his head against Steve’s as those seven simple words coated his restless mind like a blanket and offered him the sense of peace that he’d been longing for.
Steve curled his hand around Tony’s wrist quickly, looking up at him with a raised eyebrow. “Then why’d you look so shocked by it, hm?”
Without thinking about it, Steve pulled him into his arms, wrapping him up in a tight hug. Tony was shaking, breath coming short and sharp, but after a second he slumped into Steve’s arms and lifted his own, curling them desperately against his waist; face buried into the crook of Steve’s neck like a frightened child. Steve just held him as best he could, feeling his heart break a little with each passing second.
“I’d still be trying to evade the military at every corner,” Bruce piped up, “it was your team of lawyers that managed to get them to back off. You gave me freedom and peace of mind. I feel like I never really thanked you enough for that.”
“Don’t fucking touch me, Steve,” he warned, feeling his voice waver as he stumbled back hurriedly, “don’t you dare, Steve, I mean it,
Then, his mind apparently made up, he walked back over to Tony, crouching down to his level and getting close enough that their noses brushed. Tony remained still, watching on as Steve pressed their foreheads together and did what Tony could only describe as
“Fun!” Peter yelled back. He chose that moment to lift his hands away from the ceiling, and both Tony and Steve yelled and rushed forward to try and catch him until realising that he was still stuck by his feet.
“Yeah,” Tony said, subdued, “yeah, that’s it. I’ll… I actually need to- there’s a thing I just remembered I have to do, and I should-“
“Oh, he’s getting cocky now, huh?” Steve raised an eyebrow and then leaned back down again, his hands braced at Tony’s sides. Tony was drawn to the way Steve’s hair fell forward. It was something he tended to notice a lot, and he wasn’t sure why. It was just so oddly endearing. He always forgot to arrange haircuts, and so by the end of the month his bangs would be falling into his eyes at every opportunity, much to Steve’s irritation.
Unsurprisingly, he found it a moment later- lounging casually in what had somehow become his spot over the past week, with one foot laying propped on the bench and the other scuffing absently along the floor, the picture of laid-back as he laughed at something Clint was saying.
His dancer turned to him. “We’re going inside and getting you goddamn dried off. Duh. Come on- another second and you’ll start gathering frost.”
. Of course it was a little blunt, a little crass, but by that point in the night Tony was supposed to have kissed the man in at least three different mistletoe-laden locations in the tower, and so it would have then become obvious to Steve that this had been the plan all along: straight up just looking Steve in the eye and asking, via Christmas Cracker, if he was interested.
Steve looked back at him, smiling exasperatedly.  “I know I am,” he said, Peggy’s words ringing in his ear from earlier, “it’s the only reason I showed up, really. Pity is the only emotional motivator here-“
The group began moving in unanimous agreement, all of them led by Ty himself, who was slowly walking toward them to get to the exit. Steve blinked in surprise when he felt Tony suddenly drop his hand a second before the other boy ended up seeing it.
“Better. Shoulder’s still having a bad day, but aside from that,” Tony trailed off, and Steve felt him shrug again, “I mean, hey- at least there’s one silver lining to this clusterfuck of a day.”
Steve looked around at them. “I don’t know,” he said, and he felt numb when he heard the words, “I really… just don’t know.”
“You have no idea,” Tony breathed against him, eyes shut- and Steve watched the way his shoulders were bunched up, tight with tension and heat, “
Everyone mumbled a bashful apology, and Rhodey levered the hospital bed into a more upright position with a small chuckle and another ruffle of Tony’s hair. The table was wobbly thanks to the tiling of the medical bay floor, and Tony had to make sure not to move too much or else he’d knock his leg up against something under the table and cause himself a world of pain. It was pretty uncomfortable, really. But there was nowhere else in the world he would rather be.
Tony turned his head back to face Thanos, watching as he clicked in triumph, expecting a result. When nothing happened, Steve couldn’t help but laugh, and he lifted their joined hands, Tony flexing his fingers to show off the shining stones. Steve laid his hand over them and felt it burn, felt his whole body vibrate with an energy he didn’t even have the words to describe. Something started to buzz in his head, a collection of conversation fragments, images, a picture of himself and Maria sitting on their boat as it floated across the lake. He realised that it was Tony; his thoughts, his mind. The infinity stones were connecting them together into one shared consciousness, and he felt it when Tony came to the same realisation, because there was a strange sense of familiarity that filled him up from head to toe. Even through the pain. Even through the noise.
Steve blinked groggily, eyes moving between Rumlow and Tony, who was now clad in all that beautiful red and gold. “Suit came fast,” he muttered, realising his words were a little slurred. A lot of blood was on the floor around him.
“None, my friend!” Thor said, “I just got bored for a second. Dangerous thing for me to be, really. Would you like me to put you down?”
It didn’t really work. They both walked out of their five minutes later looking as if they’d been electrocuted, but still. He felt a little warmer for it- although that might not have been entirely to do with the dry hair.
He was pretty sure the guy just hadn’t bothered turning up for school since the week had begun, because otherwise they would have inexplicably managed to run into each other as they always seemed to. But seeing as there had been no mysterious appearances or unfortunate collisions, Steve figured it was because Tony simply wasn’t there.
“Not now, JARVIS,” Tony said with a sigh, shutting his eyes and leaning forward so his elbows were resting on his knees. He ran a slightly shaky hand through his hair. “I don’t wanna do this now.”
They were silent again- simply watching the view ahead of them as everything disintegrated. They had minutes, maybe. Not long enough for anyone to swoop in and save them, now, but enough to be able to appreciate everything fully, before…. you know.
He just couldn’t stop acting like a fool in front of that stupid, beautiful fucking boy. He was going to take his shopping bags and hit himself over the head with them, Goddamn it all to hell-
Steve pulled a slightly disgusted face. “Admittedly, it was unlucky that this all had to happen on the same day. But at least now you’re all warmed up for th—”
His hand grabbed Tony’s arm and held him in place, stopping the pacing around the room. It wasn’t a strong grip, but Tony stopped moving completely, his eyes turning down to the fingers on his arm. He opened his mouth a little.
Right. He probably shouldn’t jump to the worst conclusion possible immediately after hearing only one word. That was just dumb.
“Mornin’,” Steve mumbled as he dipped his head low and then pressed his mouth against Tony’s neck, beginning to press little kisses into the soft skin there. He felt Tony stir underneath him, his hands moving as they reached for Steve’s broad shoulders.
Glancing at himself in the mirror, he noted the puffy eyes and static hair with a small frown, but ultimately didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t like he was going to be having a long conversation with whoever this was.
It was a only in the last few minutes that Steve propped his head back up, just in time to watch a massive debate open up on the table between which teacher would be most likely to murder Tony before they graduated. Sam, Natasha and Thor were firmly on the side of it being Miss Hill, but Tony and Clint were putting a valiant fight up on behalf of Principal Fury. Hands were gesturing wildly, voices were getting louder, and asses left seats as all of them became more and more adamant. Steve, however, was happy just to watch in vague amusement as Tony used one hand to flip Thor off and the other to continue holding Steve’s own under the table.
“Considering I am struggling to keep my hands off you for more than 1 minute periods, I’m saying you’re doing pretty well so far,” Tony interspersed each block of words with short kisses that Steve just returned gladly, losing himself to the sensations once more.
“Ty?” Tony said, turning away from Steve and looking out of the window, and Steve swore just at the same time Thor did, both of them standing up from the couch and walking up behind him. “Listen to me, ‘cause I’m only gonna say it once. I don’t care about us, or what happens now, and I’m not gonna ask why you did what you did, because frankly, I already know.” His eyes flickered to Steve for a second before he looked back out of the window. “But if you go to the police about what happened with you and Steve today, believe me, I’ll be right behind you. And you know how much dirt I’ve got on you. It won’t be something you’ll come out of looking too good.”
“I think I’ll be the judge of that, yeah?” Tony tugged at his wrist, pulling him into standing position and then gently uncurling his fist. Steve decided to let him- he knew Tony would only bug him about it for the rest of the day if he didn’t.
—confidence in me right now. I’m glad I’ve got you two and your wonderful bedside manners to keep me company while I slowly contract sepsis.”
… But also, admittedly, kind of cute. Tony was going to tease Steve senseless when all this was done.
, the only thing he wanted to do in that moment was pull Tony away and do something stupid like write
Steve raised his eyebrows. Even he could tell Tony was lying, that time. His words hadn't just been confrontational. They'd been defensive. Defensive of someone else- probably the kid, if the last part of their conversation together had been anything to go by. "What's his name?" He asked in the end.
“All of it,” he croaked, the horror of everything he’d done bubbling up to the surface. He couldn’t believe it. It just felt like a nightmare.
Thor considered it for a moment. “I’ll wear some sunglasses. And a hoodie. No one will ever suspect it’s me.”
“We’ve given you a shot of morphine,” Bruce followed on from her sentence, “but there was only one in the med-kit, and I’m pretty sure it’s going to wear off soon. And the gas stove ran out of fuel about ten minutes ago, so it’s gonna get pretty cold from here on out.”
, which just meant that he was ignoring Tony. Which was fine, if he wanted to be like that, then fine, Tony could give as good as he damn well got.
“Yeah, Steve, please do that,” there was a sudden shuffling down the line, and then the sound of a fast pattering noise, like…fingers on a keyboard? “I’m gonna track your phone. I need you to keep the line open though. It’ll only take a minute.”
“You do.” Steve looked down at him for a second, tongue running over his bottom lip, until he blinked and then held up the wet cloth, seemingly attempting to come back to himself. “We should clean up.”
It didn’t, so he frowned and sat himself up from the couch, gently placing his sketch onto the arm-rest. It was a picture of Tony, of course. Drawn as if in front of him, as if they’d never left this spot. His shirt was still riding up in the sketch, the same way it always did. His hair was still messy and there was still grease where it shouldn’t be.
But hell. It was Christmas. And Tony had been creating plans ever since June, a lot of them far more intricate and over the top than this. Steve should be grateful he’d settled with a Christmas cracker. At one point in September, he’d been thinking more along the lines of a boat-based confession.
“Obviously not, they’re not nearly as trustworthy,” Tony muttered, just before a second little staticky noise and the sound of a distant voice behind him
Peter bumped him on the shoulder and he laughed quietly. It was nice to see the tension ease off his face a little.
"He's loud enough to be," Steve said mutinously, stifling a yawn, "anyway, we've made the executive decision that you're on babysitting duty today. Tony's got work and I've got, uh- stuff. Captain America Stuff." He shrugged and clapped Clint on the shoulder as Tony hoisted the baby up and then placed him in Clint's arms with a sweet smile. Peter turned to look at him as Tony stepped away, before glancing over to Clint with wide eyes.
“Oh, Steve- it’s okay,” Tony said softly, dropping on to the bed and pulling Steve in again, “we are all very acutely aware of what PTSD attacks do to a person. I’ve suffered a lot worse from other people and given a lot worse myself. This will heal. It was an accident. You literally did this from hugging me too tightly, babe, that’s really the best way I could imagine getting bruised ribs.”
“Guys!” Bruce said faintly from the living room, where he was sat helping Peter build something out of chunky Lego blocks, “I think Peter’s pooped.”
Tony watched him as he sat in Sam’s spot, his legs crossed and knees just touching Tony’s own on the floor. He knew Tony was smiling, but he looked down as he placed the bowl of water down to his left and the first-aid kit on the opposite side.
Another blow hit a few minutes later as new reports started to surface. Tony still had the CCTV footage in the corner of the HUD, plus the various messages that he was receiving through the SHIELD secure line, and he took it all in with a sinking heart. “Steve, it looks like our enemies are sporting a variety of mid-level enhancements.”
Steve looked up at him, unimpressed. “Don’t get cocky,” he muttered, sizing up the wall and then taking a running leap. He didn’t have the height Tony did, but if he got the angle right-
"Oh, by the way," Natasha looked up for a moment, waving to Steve, "your boyfriend is about to start a fight in the corridors. Again."
“This is just Home Alone but with higher stakes,” Tony told him drily, rolling his eyes and waving around him. Rhodey shook his head and began to rebuke him, but Tony kept talking. “Christmas time, stuck at home, evil villains threatening us, creating traps out of arm-chairs and stove-tops? Macaulay Culkin called, Rhodey-Bear, and he’s asking for royalties. God, I can’t believe this.” Tony sighed. “You know, I blame Thor for this. Stupid stuff happens whenever we let Thor pick the holiday activities.”
Tony was, admittedly, quite the hit too. Kids loved the suit, although he hadn’t brought it with him today, seeing as it was less of a meet-and-greet and more of a lesson in morality. Each Avenger was taking a different year-group to give them a talk, and Tony had been given the sixth-graders. That pesky age, caught between teenage years and little-kid years.
“Did I kill him,” he choked out, tasting the bile on his tongue and sensing the revulsion that quickly consumed him, “did I—Tony. Did I kill Tony?”
“Okay- how did the meeting with those clients go?” Steve asked him, pulling away and then looking Tony up and down in worry. He was still wearing the smart clothes; must have come straight here once it was done. He didn’t look like he was sporting any injuries though, which was comforting. “Did it go okay?”
“The laws of thermodynamics are fundamentally unchangeable, idiot, if we didn’t believe or follow any solid rules then we would never be able to move forward-“
worrying?” Natasha quipped across the table, waving her fork at him and grinning when she turned her gaze on Tony. “You should have seen him earlier. Helen was like, ‘yeah, he’ll be totally fine, he’s just resting right now’, but Steve
. I don’t even know what to say; I can’t believe you’ve managed to hide this from everyone, I can’t believe you’d
“Time to haul ass again, then,” Tony sighed wearily, as Steve whooped and pulled them in the other direction.
When his hand settled gently against Tony’s waist, the other man shivered, but he leaned in heavily against Steve’s side. Steve held him, his mouth pressing up against Tony’s temple. His skin was warm, and Steve savoured. Today had been too close, and Steve could feel the anxiety crawl over his back, as it would continue for the next few days at the very least. But this wasn't about him. It wasn't him who'd nearly died today, after all.
Tony flipped him off on autopilot, but Steve was just nodding his head in agreement, and Tony knew it was already a lost cause. “Tony, you can stay with me for the first few games. The rules really are simple, I’ll teach you them on the way. For now- I declare Bruce as the first seeker. You’re not allowed to leave the top five floors of the tower, but every place above that is fair game. Everyone has two minutes to hide.”
“Someone who no longer attends this school, lets put it that way,” Natasha answered her, smiling sweetly and sending a small shiver running down Steve’s spine. He made a mental note to never stand Clint up on a date.
Steve just shrugged, sitting back so that their shoulders were touching. “I thought it was sweet. Sort of. How did you meet them?”
Steve said determinedly, holding Tony a little tighter, “we will make it back, Tony. Because we have a beautiful daughter to make it back for. I’d fight Thanos any day of the week to protect that, and I’d win.”
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice was soft, gentle—Steve imagined that maybe, when Tony’s butler had been alive, he’d sounded like that too. “If it kept you safe, I would not hesitate to let them do whatever they wish to me. I am a program.”
He twined his fingers through the hairs on the back of Steve’s head, breaking away so he could smile softly. Their foreheads touched. “Thank you for coming back,” he murmured, hearing his door swing open as Steve kicked at it with the toe of his shoe.
But Steve was already diving across the pillows and bean bags, hands grabbing Tony’s jacket and then tugging him in before he could say another word. Kissing him hard and fast, Steve let his tongue slide into Tony’s mouth and ran a hand through the curls in his hair, before stroking his fingers gently over the back of his neck in a way Steve knew made Tony weak at the knees. Tony kissed back immediately, utterly unable to stop himself, and Steve positively glowed with it.
She hummed her agreement and then leaned down, kissing his forehead and staining the area red as always. He felt her brush at it lightly with a finger. “I’m sure you’ll bring Tony ‘round,” she said with a smile, “he seems pretty smitten with you, if what you’ve told me is anything to go by. And you’ve still got his jacket. That’s already a nice little excuse wrapped up in a bow. Just throw him a smile and he’ll fall right back to your feet, I promise,” she grinned and he shook his head fondly, giving her a shove.
Steve spluttered. “Uh. Everything? I was- Christ, Tony, think about what I did. I thought… you should have just left me there.”
Tony sniffed, opening up his Pinterest and rapidly deleting everything Halloween-themed. Then he did the same for his other social media, clearing it of everything. Once that was done, he did the same for his room, piling any chocolates or decorations into the bin and stepping on it viciously.
“Word of advice, Stane,” Tony said, very, very quietly, “listen close, because I’m only gonna say this once.”
“Lame. You totally took that off the internet,” Steve replied, hands rising to Tony’s waist as he let his head fall into Tony’s stomach, “how you feeling?”
Steve looked up at it in awe, internally praising Tony’s mind. Always thinking ahead, always coming up with innovations that left everyone else reeling. “Certainly looks impressive,” he said with a huff of air.
Steve smiled softly, turning a little in Tony’s arms so that he was chest to chest with the other boy. Tony’s cheek was pushed into the pillow, his hair a messy array of unruly curls that coiled over his forehead and fell into his closed eyes. He was drooling slightly into the mattress, and Steve didn’t doubt that if he looked now, he’d see a matching damp spot on his shoulder from where Tony had been burying his head.
That… no. Steve remembered… the scrape of metal, the crack, blood, screaming, no, no, he had, Steve knew it, Tony was dead and it was his fault—
Steve cut him off with a kiss, looping his arms tight around Tony’s neck and standing up to his tiptoes to press his full body up against the other boy. He tried to make sure everything he felt was conveyed in the kiss, but he knew it wouldn’t be enough. Nothing would ever really be enough to try and get Tony to see,
Bucky flailed his hands around a little, cheeks going slightly pink. “I wanted it to be a surprise, asshole! I was… I mean- you were gonna be miles away, and I didn’t wanna have to rely on the shitty train times to decide when I got to see you, and I don’t know- what if there was some emergency and you needed me and… yeah,” Bucky shrugged, patting the dashboard, “so I was planning to get a car soon as I heard you were moving. Granted, I was kinda hoping to be able to save up for a slightly better model- but alcohol and Natasha both persuaded me this one was fine, so here I am. Coming to take you to school!”
Steve blanched, holding steady for a moment sagging against the wall desolately as he bent and buried his head into his hands.
“Yeah, I was kinda drained,” Steve wandered into the kitchen and smelt something tomatoey hit him instantly. It was good- homely. “Thought I might just go have a rest.”
But he choked back on his sobs and he kept packing up. Because he had to. Because whatever it was that he’d had with Steve, it was gone now. People who loved you didn’t... they didn’t do that to you.
“You actually are,” Tony nodded his head and fastened his seatbelt, “I told you to just give them the money. You would’ve fared a lot better if you had.”
"Well, we've already reached one developmental milestone tonight," he said as he slipped into bed next to Steve and handed him the note, "seems that we've got a name."
“You have no idea,” Tony mumbled, and he remembered as he rested against Steve’s chest that the last time he’d had a proper sleep was about four days ago.
“Okay, I declare the fort fit for use,” Peggy said, jumping down from the table and shaking her hair from her face. “Everyone get in, and that’s an order.”
“What do you mean?” Steve frowned at the look Tony gave him and sat up a fraction, using his good arm this time.
Apprehensively, Steve followed along, stepping out into the balcony overlooking the massive and overgrown garden. He hadn’t realised quite how big the house actually was- from this height, he could almost see above the treeline and over to the rest of the city, to the sun that was slowly sinking further toward the ground. He turned his head to Tony, and then yelped when he noticed the boy jumping onto the railing steadily, hand gripping at the side of the wall.
“In what world will this ever be okay?” Tony asked him, “I just lost… my own father did this to me!” He gestured jerkily at himself, seemingly getting more and more agitated as he spoke. “Why? What did I do… loving you? I loved someone, and that was enough for him! To throw me out like I was nothing!”
Three seconds later, Steve stepped toward him, and Tony sighed in relief. Not broken, see? Just… a little bent out of shape. Only temporarily though – Tony was an engineer. He’d fix it. He could fix anything.
Her hand descended and pushed his away, guiding it back to the side of the bed. “They warned me you’d be a nuisance,” Helen told him. “You’ll make a full recovery, but it still needs time to heal, so stop fiddling with it.”
“Why are you up here, dad?” Tony asked with a small note of resignation in his voice, “you should probably go sleep it off. It’s still early in the day-“
Tony stared at him blankly for a moment and then scoffed. “Like hell you’re drinking my booze,” he said with a shake of his head.
Thor put out a hand as Tony got within reaching distance. “I would be careful,” he said gravely, “Steven may not be of sound mind right now.”
kick you off the team? Stop being your friends? Iron Man is… it’s fucking irrelevant, Tony. It’s meaningless. You, on the other hand? You’re irreplaceable.”
but then Steve’s lip tilted upward, and the worries trickled out of his mind like they’d never even been there.
“I know,” she nodded, “I don’t blame you. I think he is too. Natasha put him in his place after you left- although I think he’d already started getting the hint after what you’d said to him.” She paused, making a little face and throwing her hair back with a twist of her neck. “He does want to try and put things right. I promise. I spoke to him this morning.”
Tony made a few more tiny noises that may have been words, but his hands tucked around Steve’s neck and he buried his head down into Steve’s chest, so it wasn’t like he was complaining much.
Tony was tense up against him, ready to bolt at any moment. He still hadn’t opened his eyes yet; but he could tell Steve from smell and sense alone, and knew there was no danger in his embrace. Even so, it didn’t stop the memories. The feeling of ice running down his back; the lurching fear that every time they dunked him would be his last, that it would hit his chest just right and send him into cardiac arrest.
Tony had been late back from the gala and was a little more drunk than usual, thanks to meeting some old friends from back at MIT there. It’d been a fun night, if he was being honest- more fun than how those sorts of things usually went, anyway. He should have told Steve he’d be late though. Although, in all honesty, he’d thought the most he’d get was an exasperated sigh and a gentle request for Tony to
“Get a grip,” he muttered to himself, shaking his head and then wiping the water out of his eyes as he stepped out from the spray and wrapped a towel around his midsection. He wasn’t going to bring this up with Steve right now. Tony knew it’d only upset him, and he didn’t want to fight. Anyway, it wasn’t even that important. Steve wasn’t an idiot; he was just as aware of all this as Tony was. But where Tony liked to err on the side of (admittedly pretty intense) caution when it came to emotional vulnerability, Steve tended to just throw himself in head-first and worry about the consequences when they hit him in the face later. And he was headed for a pretty damn big smack in the face at this rate. They all were.
Knowing that it was something for Steve to focus on, Tony kept it up, leaning down further until they were lying face-to-face on the soft bedsheets.
“Uh, alright,” Steve said, sticking his head into the car and then looking at the tangled mess of wires with a frown, “you might have to walk me through it. Why were you even hooked up to the car anyway?”
Steve was silent for a moment, shutting his eyes and leaning his forehead against the metal of the gate, hands curling around the bars. “Someone’s trying to kill me,” he whispered.
Steve stares at him incredulously for a good few moments, before shaking his head sadly and slowly raising his hand, cupping it against Tony’s cheek softly. “Are you even
, Steve.” Tony’s voice crackled through the speakers, “who’s—what even… fuck, nevermind, questions later, just get in, come on. Do you know whether you were followed?”
They arrived back at Nat’s place fourteen minutes later, and by that time darkness was covering the city, the streetlights being the only thing to illuminate their path.
“You lost me around ‘so to start with-’” Sam admitted, and Tony shut his eyes for a second before letting out a bark of laughter. Steve chose that moment to intervene; walking into the center of the floor where both boys were sat and then clearing his throat.
“One week,” Tony promised, finally turning on his heel and starting to walk away properly, but continuing to keep his head turned in Steve’s direction. He waved. “Love you bunches!”
Suddenly and with surprising swiftness, Tony jolted forward, causing Rumlow to pause mid speech. Gone was the blank expression on his face; sliding right off and being replaced with dark fury. “What the fuck have you done with Steve,” he spat, his hand balling into a fist on the table,
Feeling warm and happy, Tony rolled onto his back and looked at the ceiling, his thoughts on Steve. He missed him. But that was weird, because Tony had only seen him this afternoon. Then again, it was just so easy to miss him as soon as he stopped being there. Tony wondered whether he might actually be addicted. This had to be unnatural behaviour. Steve had mentioned something about there being a mild chemical in his canines that had aphrodisiac qualities, among other things. After some probing on that, Tony had discovered that if Steve bit him, it’d be a bit like feeling high. It was so that any prey wouldn’t struggle or feel the pain as they died, but seeing as Steve wouldn’t be killing him, Tony
“Yeah, because you were—” Steve flailed a little, trying to find the words as his cheeks went steadily pinker, “I’d always thought you’d be more wary around kids, just as clueless as the rest of us, you know? But you’re not. You’re brilliant with him. You just know what to do, and you hold him like it’s so natural and I just… love it. Watching you with him makes me really happy.”
Tony stood up from the counter dramatically, staring daggers at Steve as he tipped his food out into the bin and then marched over to dishwasher where he yanked the door open and then shoved it in messily. Not his most mature response, sure, but he was overtired and it was fucking stupid anyway. “Happy?” He asked with a flourish and a smile.
at them. Look at those insignificant, stupid little dots in the sky. They created every atom in your body. Every atom on this planet. Each atom in the visible universe. And they’re up there. We’re looking at…
Tony laughed, and honestly, Steve’s own stupid giggles were mostly just involuntary at that point. A reflex action in response to Tony’s own. “If it helps, Thor’s about to grace us with his… large presence in about three minutes, so you might be able to siphon a little bit of energy from him.” Tony scrunched up the napkin and then threw it back, landing it perfectly over Steve’s face.
For the second time that night, Steve shot out a hand and stopped him before he could lift it into his mouth. Looking at Tony seriously, he said “unless you intend to share, you’re not drinking any more right now.”
Bucky’s smile turned instantly to a scowl, and he shoved Steve from the driver’s seat, sending him clattering into the side of the door. “Shut up, she’s not that bad!”
His therapist tried, he knew she did. But despite all the talks on positive thinking and calming techniques, they still may as well have been spoken to a brick wall when he was in the middle of one of his mood swings. She told him it was because of the parent-teacher meetings that he’d mentioned were coming up. Said that sometimes situations occurred that reminded him it was real, and it was going to hurt. It didn’t help, though- the reason was just a reason. At the end of the day, it didn’t stop him feeling like he was being crushed from the inside out. His heart felt fifty pounds heavier every time he breathed- his mind felt tired. So, so tired.
A few seconds later, his breathing evened out and Tony was asleep. Steve kept his eyes open for a few moments longer, just watching him breathe, and then he too let himself slip off into a peaceful doze.
Tony laughed, then, and it looked fond. He was obviously close to the other boy. “Yeah, that’s Thor. Utterly fucking terrifying if you get on the wrong side of him, but very comforting if you’re a friend. Saved my ass a few times, that’s for sure.”
Bruce came in later and explained things more clearly to him. Apparently the physical contact between Steve and the transmitter before it had been disconnected had forced a link between the two of them. The frequencies were designed to emphasise certain emotions and characteristics and inhibit others, making what the alien race had thought was the ‘perfect soldier’. Violence. Manipulation and emotional indifference. Lack of empathy. A strong pack mentality. Increased sex drive. Territorial behaviour. They were all things that Steve would have been experiencing too, as the last remaining person linked with that terrible machine.
“Listen, at the very least, it’s a way to spend a Tuesday morning that’s more fun than Cap’s training routines,” Clint said with a shrug, tossing a couple of peanuts into his mouth. “And hey, with War Machine there point about seventeen different weapons their way, I’m pretty sure most of them peed themselves a little bit, which was an added bonus.”
The group watched him for another few seconds, before Zeke leaned over to Ty and then gestured down the hall again. Shooting Steve one last look, they finally slinked off to wherever they were headed- Steve really wondered if they spent more time skipping than they actually did in lesson.
Tony barked out a surprised laugh, pointing a raised eyebrow Steve’s way. “That doesn’t sound scientifically accurate,” he said.
“I think something in my bow is catching as it fires,” Clint said, lifting his bow up and stroking it soothingly, “I can compensate for it, but I might need it looking over before I go into any more missions.”
“Supportive as I am for your social crisis, we’re talking about mine right now,” Steve mumbled into his hands, and there was another round of back-patting from his two idiot friends, an automatic response to his trouble by that point. “How exactly am I supposed to get myself invited to these things?”
“-I went and sorted them out. It was pretty cool-  even got to try out some of the moves we were practicing at the gym, Nat.”
Slowly, Steve sunk to his haunches next to Tony, glancing over to him and grinning. “And this is the one that may or may not blow up, yes?”
There was a weak protest from Bruce as his name was sullied, but ultimately died down when he realised that Clint was only telling the truth. Tony glanced over at Steve, pushing his glasses further up the bridge of his nose. He still felt a little unsteady, but it was better now that he was holding the kid in his arms. Solid evidence that he was okay. Tony had never really imagined himself to be a paternal sort of guy, but when he looked down at Peter, the urge to look after him and protect him and keep him safe from all harm was so strong that it ached in his chest worse than the arc reactor did. The Avengers tower was the last place on Earth Tony had ever thought would be suitable for a child of his age, and yet now it was hard to even imagine him anywhere else. They’d sort of learned how to handle all the baby elements, and now Bruce didn’t even run and hide at the prospect of changing his diaper. Steve and Tony had a system for when Peter woke in the night, Thor was uncannily good at getting the little boy to eat everything on his plate and he always got the morning shift, and Clint & Nat both revelled in finding ways to entertain him. Tony thought that maybe Natasha even enjoyed it unironically- the chance at playing make believe, being a child in a way she’d never gotten to do before.
At that, Tony smiled and took a sip of his drink. “Trust me, there won’t be any discussion involved.”
“Always,” Steve replies, pulling away to kiss Tony soundly, paint-covered hands curling around his jaw and stroking soft circles into the skin, “I… I couldn’t sleep. I missed you, and- i don’t know, usually it doesn’t bother me, but I just… it’s winter, and you were flying across the atlantic, and I’m stupid so I worry about these things-”
Tony watched from the bed in curiosity, as Steve pulled himself upright and wandered over to his wardrobe, falling to his knees as he sifted through the bottom drawer for a second before stilling, hand grabbing at something and then coming back out, closing the cupboard with a click. Tony squinted to see what Steve had, but apart from a tiny flash of shiny grey, he couldn’t see through his clutched fist.
He didn’t wait to watch the mug shatter against the wall before he turned back to Steve, face twisted in fury. “Shout at me,” he said, voice raising to a yell as he commanded, “tell me everything you think of me, call me a name, grab my shoulders and kiss me and tell me everything’s going to be alright, just fucking
He gritted his teeth and looked down. “Doesn’t give him the right to try and control my entire life,” he muttered angrily.
“December 7th, 2015,” she began, “after a successful two months in which no problems have arisen post-partum for the subject, initial testing for Superhumanism will begin. We’ll start with noises at different pitches, and see whether it elicits any sort of response from it.” She walked further in, peering down at the cot as she placed earphones over her own head.
Peter stilled in his arms, looking up at Tony with his huge blue eyes, interested by this unusual change in behavior. Tony made sure to smile reassuringly at him before leaning down and pressing a little kiss against Peter’s temple. He could feel his hands shaking, but he made sure not to squeeze too tight. He wouldn’t hurt him.
Whatever. It was fine. Tony hated mornings anyway, he didn’t like talking to anyone or anything before his morning coffee.
Her face softened a fraction, and she smiled at him. “Well, at least you’re not gonna be wandering around alone. We’ve got your back, Steve.”
He realised now that it probably had. It had been hurting Steve all that time, and Tony had just continued to be an asshole about it. Like he always was.
“They’re going to take him away,” Tony mumbled, feeling himself edge dangerously close to hysterical as he looked blankly at Natasha, then Steve, shaking his head minutely, “they’re going to take him and do... and we can’t… we can’t—”
Of course, the whole ‘casual’ thing hadn’t actually lasted long. Surprisingly, it was Tony who stumbled through the conversation about wanting to be exclusive, cheeks red and lips chapped from where he’d bitten them in nervousness. “I know what we agreed on the first night,” he’d begun hurriedly, “but I’ve been thinking and I… well, I mean, you know I’m—I’m me, right, so I’m emotionally stunted on a good fucking day and I thought that I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship or anything, but then I… then I thought of you being.” He waved a hand briskly through the air, jaw tightening. “You know. Being with someone else. And it made me physically sick, Steve. I—I don’t want that. I don’t want you to be with anyone else. And I don’t want to be with anyone else. You’re… it’s just you, Steve.”
“Baby,” Steve began, leaning forward and resting his hands on Tony’s lap to steady himself, “you’re… real swell, you know that?”
Tony was looking at him like he’d seen a ghost. “You…” he began, but then his face turned baffled, “I saw you,” he said, and there was pure incredulity in his voice.
So rather than look at Tony’s face, he rocked awkwardly on his heels and then looked around the room, at all the kids slowly making their way out of the cafeteria. Something hit him in the back of the head, and he turned around to spot Clint raising his eyebrows at Steve and Tony’s close proximity and then making a bunch of rude gestures in response. Steve flipped him off instinctively at the same time Natasha smacked him over the back of his head.
“Steve!” Tony called again, and there was someone else, someone else calling too- but his eyes were clenched shut against Tony’s neck, and he couldn’t see who they were. They were irrelevant.
With one last glance back at the door now swinging shut, Steve saw Tony, his eyes fixed on Rumlow as the man stood in front of him. His gaze was hard and his chin was stuck out, defiant.
“Sir arrived home from school last night and informed me that he was not going to be welcome for much longer in his home, and so he made the decision to relocate me into a miniaturised version of the system that he had installed in his room and workshop that night,” JARVIS said, and Steve felt his stomach drop.
Across the room and through the pane of thick glass, Bruce nodded and pushed his glasses up his nose. “Uh, yeah,” he said with a shrug, “from what we can tell, he’s basically just. Uh. Imprinted, I think? That, mixed with this primal protective urge and the, uh, the growling. We’re pretty sure that it’s some sort of chemically induced… animalistic behaviour.”
And then he cut the call, throwing the phone on the bed roughly. Steve watched it, completely confused, before batting Tony’s hand away when it tried to go back to its place over Steve’s forehead. “What the hell was that about?” He asked sharply, “they’re my friends- they’re going to be worried about me, Tony, there was no need to be so rude about it.”
Despite Tony’s promises, the New Year came and went without them actually noticing. Turns out they ended up… rather occupied.
So he sat still, shut his eyes, and let Steve slowly undress him. One cufflink to the next, then slipping the fabric off his shoulders and neatly folding it at the side. Tony sighed happily when Steve placed an absent kiss across the surface of the reactor before he grabbed Tony’s faded band T-shirt from under the pillow and slid it over his head. “Arms up,” he said as he guided Tony’s hands through the fabric and slid it over his torso. Tony felt himself start to drift, pressed down onto the bed by Steve’s weight and the exhaustion that seeped through every layer of tissue within him. It’d been a long, long week. And Steve was warm, and soft, and home.
Tony had had a shitty few months, his head was all over the place and for a brief period he’d been on a downward spiral of self-hatred that had threatened to consume him entirely, sure, but it was
“Okay okay, stop squabbling, all of you, it’s dinnertime,” Mrs Wilson chided, and then swooped in to put three plates of food on the table, stopping to smack Steve and Darcy lightly over the head. She paused at Steve, smiling down fondly at him as she ruffled his hair. “And you,” she began with a playful tutting in the front of her mouth, “you stay out of trouble, okay? You’re already on your last warning with school, and I’m not going to be happy if I hear you’ve started doing all those drugs you kids like so much-“
“Hey, Steve,” Tony answered the phone after two rings, and Steve found himself smiling tiredly at the sound of Tony’s voice alone.
Fury looked like he was chewing glass. He glared at all of them, before just shaking his head. “Then I cannot help you. Believe me when I say that I am aware of Stone’s reputation, but without any evidence, this was simply an unprovoked fight started by Rogers over there.”
“I’ve got you too, you know,” he murmured, before dropping his hand and letting his head fall against Tony’s arm.
Pursing his lips, Bucky pushed his tray of food to the side and silently handed Tony a semi automatic. The other man took it with a grunt of thanks, checking the cartridge and then wincing. “Three bullets? Seriously?”
Except this once, apparently. This once, he’d just looked at Steve, heartbroken and empty and totally,
The bravery got stuck in his throat like bile. Something lurched inside him, and for a moment he was convinced he was going to be sick. But already, he could feel the drug starting to take hold. He wanted to sleep. He had to close his eyes.
“Now,” Steve thought about turning on the light as he passed it, but it would probably only hurt Tony’s eyes, so he left the room in darkness, “what happened tonight that upset you? Is it- is it something that needs to involve the cops or something?”
They looked at each other for a moment, before Dad huffed and dropped his head on to Pops’ shoulder, whilst Pops looked relieved and wound an arm around his waist, shutting his eyes and turning his lips to the crown of Dad’s hair.
And it was stupid. All his friends cared, and all he had to do was ask. But he just couldn’t. He couldn’t put himself in that position of vulnerability. They were all busy anyways. He wasn’t going to bother them with his own shitty mood.
Steve had heard Tony say that he was leaving and snapped, and Tony had nearly died in his attempt to run away.
Steve smacked him on the chest with a scowl. “I hate you and I think you're insane,” he declared- not that Tony seemed to mind much; just lowered his hands to Steve’s elbows and then hauled him up into a sitting position.
“Hmm, should damn hope so,” Steve huffed and then flopped back down onto the bed, face smushed into the pillow. He cracked open one eye and watched Tony with his perfect smile, the sheets shifting over the planes of his back. Tony wanted to jump back into bed and do exactly what Steve had suggested: stay. But, unfortunately, duty called, and would probably not appreciate being fobbed off in favour of a morning blowie.
“Well, it’s lucky that I’ve never given a shit about important stuff everyone else seems to care so much about then, huh?” Tony said airily, spinning around in his chair and turning his back on her. “If you can kindly fuck off now, that’d be great. I appreciate the check-in, but I’m doing fine.”
offended now. Steve waved a hand through the air sharply, silencing any other interrogations either of the two could give out.
Thor’s place was massive. It was incredibly stylish, too; full of grand oak furniture and open-plan space. There was a huge fireplace on the back wall, and an even larger TV that stood tall in the middle of a bundle of soft couches and chairs. That was where all his friends were- although they didn’t appear to be sitting on them like normal folk tended to.
“This is perfect,” Steve told him firmly, pulling Tony in until the man was sat on his lap. It stung at his waist a little-- an injury he must have picked up from somewhere recently—but he hardly even noticed, too busy kissing Tony senseless. “I love you. I love you so much.”
“I can’t stop it,” Steve gritted, face ashen, eyes wide and horrified as he shivered, “Tony, I can’t—I don’t… they’ve done something, I can’t…” he took a stride forward and then stopped jerkily, teeth grinding. “Run,” he hissed, “get out… now. Go.”
“but you didn’t,” Tony said, hands cupping the back of Steve’s head, holding him, grounding him, “I’m fine. Thor had my back. It’s all good, baby, I’m okay.”
“What are you doing?” Ty asked lightly, flicking his gaze down to Steve. He watched as the boy’s lip curled a little and resisted the urge to stand up and jump immediately into a confrontation. It was just a look- and he was Tony’s friend.
the evil robot. So this excursion hardly made any sense. Why would Tony even care that there was something tearing up a city when he was known to do the exact same thing?
He felt empty. Like he’d been used somehow, although the thought was unfounded. After all, he was the one who’d done the using.
“I don’t know what chip you’ve got on your shoulder, Rogers,” Principal Fury told him, his voice utterly unforgiving, “but it’s getting too big. You better start giving me some reasons as to why I shouldn’t just kick you straight out of my school and not let you back in, because right now, I’m not seeing many.”
For a moment, Steve couldn’t tell if it was the helicarrier on SHIELD, or the train running through the mountains.
Tony- God, Tony beamed at him like he’d just made his morning, and it was… it was so stupid, how he did this to himself- he didn’t want to go and that was obvious- but honestly, Steve just felt glad that at least he was around to give Tony something to look forward to coming back to. He needed that. And Steve wasn’t much, but… well, Tony didn’t seem to mind that.
. Possibly an understatement of the century, but Tony’s brain was currently occupied with other things, so he couldn’t think of a better adjective.
Thor came in at that moment, eyeing up the three boys on the couch and then immediately dropping the big bowl of fries onto the coffee table. “You were doing a hand-holding sesh and didn’t even tell me?” He got to his knees in front of them and took Steve and Rhodey’s spare hands enthusiastically, so that they were all connected in a circle, Tony in the middle. He smiled at all of them, wiping another tear off his face with his shoulder.
Tony had just left Steve to it after that. He was pretty sure he actually hindered the process a little with his distractions, but that was a fifty-fifty thing. Steve didn’t
However, he ended up being surprised by a suspiciously innocuous “How’s things going with you and Tony then?”
“I should be doing a lot of things,” he said, before throwing the new Widow’s Bite over to her. She caught it on reflex and glanced down. “New and improved model. Thank me later.”
Thor placed it delicately on the table next to him, and Steve could feel him hovering in worry just behind him. He wanted to assure him that it was okay, that this was tragically regular occurrence and he was not in fact dying- but the words just wouldn’t come and his throat felt too tight. It was bad enough that he’d had to be escorted from the party by Thor- but now he wasn’t even polite enough to say anything to the guy.
He didn’t finish. Steve left it for another second, before nodding and then walking away, any doubts answered for him.
Last year, he’d been stupid. Left it too late, and then faced the consequences throughout the whole damn week.
Tony’s hand immediately switched course, instead tugging out the phone from where he’d hooked it up with a grin of satisfaction. “God, it’s like Christmas,” he muttered as he switched on the device and opened it up. “Let’s find out who you are, lady—or, uh, who you were, at least.”
Thanos laughed at them both as he turned his head to face them. Tony was bloody and bruised and exhausted, and he looked at Steve and Steve looked back at him, something that transcended words passing between them as Thanos spoke, an unbearably egotistical declaration about him being ‘inevitable’.
“What the damn hell was that?” Steve asked, holding Tony for an extra second to check over for injuries before releasing again when he found none.
Slowly, he turned back to the other person in the room, who was busy watching him with a carefully neutral face. Tony’s walls were up, and they were up high. Biting back the urge to sigh, Steve moved around the desk, crouching down on his haunches as he looked at Tony’s oddly positioned arm. “Think it’s broken?” He asked quietly, gently tracing his finger around the shoulder socket in case of a dislocation he’d missed.
Steve felt like all he did was go round in circles with that damn boy. Hot one minute, cold the next- it seemed whatever Steve tried, he just couldn’t get it right with him.
He held onto that hope and let it burn through him as he stood in Wakanda and faced off with Thanos’ army. Now that they were staring into the eye of the tiger, Steve felt something settle under his gut and pull taut, sending his back straighter and his jaw tighter. He realised it was understanding. Knowledge that it was really, really unlikely he was going to be getting out of this alive. If Thanos was anything like what Bruce had been saying, then maybe not even the Avengers could hold them back. Maybe this was it.
“I’ve got a list, too,” he whispers as Steve gently places him on his bed and starts tucking him in, his fingers so graceful and light as he works.
Steve had a lot of things he needed to say. Ask him why he’d lied to Steve about him being so sure Stone wouldn’t rat them out. Tell him they needed to collect evidence so that they could start making a case that would put Howard away in a jail cell to rot for the rest of his life. Discuss how they were going to move forward, and where Tony was going to stay in the immediate future.
Or maybe there had never been any assets at all. Maybe this had always been their plan: lure Steve in, then… then make him one of them.
“You’ve got navigation on your phone, Steve, right?” James asked him, raising his eyebrows upward and tilting his head back to look at Steve, “I’m sure he’ll be fine, guys.”
Steve watched him for a moment; breathing in, out, the rhythmic motion of smoking that seemed to offer him at least some form of relief. He was staring out ahead of him- and Steve really had to wonder how he knew this place, and knew it
Except for the fact that every time he brought one of the team a new gift, they looked less and less happy each time. They started to frown- ask him if he was okay, which wasn’t the fucking plan. They told him to slow down, which just made everything worse. They thought he couldn’t handle it. Or maybe they just didn’t like feeling so indebted to him, seeing as they were already planning about how best to tell him he was gonna be benched permanently. Rhodey had been with them on another mission, this one in Florida, and once again, he’d done a fucking terrific job. Of course he had. It was Rhodey- he wouldn’t do anything less.
“When I met your dad for the first time, I hated him,” Pops said eventually, still quiet, still calm and collected like he always seemed to be around everyone but  Dad. “I thought he was jerk, thought he was selfish and rude and flashy in the way that everything else in the 21st century was. I hated him because he was the future, and me? I was a guy from the past. We were like oil and water.”
Steve leaned forward and passed the rest of the hour deciding which colors would work for Tony’s skin, how he could style it, how he’d capture the essence just right. It was a familiar feeling- one he found he’d missed a lot more than he’d previously thought- and before he knew it, the hour had gone and the detention was finished. Of course, Tony had left before Steve could even gather his things and try going after him, and he just sighed in irritation as he watched the boy fly out of the exit without sparing a glance in Steve’s direction.
Tony didn’t say anything to that. Steve thought maybe that had been too much. Hell, for all he knew Tony had long since moved on. It had been a year, and Tony didn’t exactly have a shortage of people falling at his feet. He should have played the ‘One for the road’ angle rather than the ‘I never got over you’ angle, dammit—
Steve gritted his teeth and glared in frustration at his friend. He was right and Steve knew it.  But that didn’t make him feel any better about himself. God, what kind of boyfriend just fucking abandoned their partner when they were in a situation like that? What had he been
“But he’s— he’s our…” Steve trailed off, fingers clenching around the sheets as he tried to find the words. But Tony already knew what he was going to say—some variation of
He felt the back of a spoon thwack his shoulder in response, and turned back to Tony while Maria just giggled and cheered. The man was rolling his eyes. “I hate when you two team up on me,” he said, “for the record, I’d like to say that it was all going fine until I was abandoned by Stark junior when I needed her most!” He pointed the spoon accusingly at her. “You went off to hug daddy and left me on my own to try and find the salt. So really, this is all on you.”
“Still a weird arty museum place, I wasn’t wrong,” Tony tilted his head back until it hit the kitchen cupboards and then made a wonderful noise at the back of his throat as Steve bit down lightly his earlobe, “but- but yeah, that place, I was… there was a- a thing, which I can’t… Oh God-”
That, at the very least, got Tony to look up at him. His eyes were shiny and his lips pursed, like he was trying to hold back tears. “Why
And that- that sounded so off in Steve’s ears. Tony? Tony Stark, the boy with everything; popularity and money and status and looks- but had never felt this before. Steve didn’t know what to think of that. It made him feel… strangely powerful. Tony; who was fast and loud and explosive and wild as a storm, was lying at his feet, heart in his hands, looking up at him as if Steve hung the stars in the sky.
Across the room, there were various murmurs of ‘actually that’d be kinda hot’ and ‘no we don’t care’- which didn’t really help Tony’s point much. He sighed, bringing Steve’s wrists to his mouth and kissing them gently before shaking his head. “Still a no,” he said with a small smile, trying not to burst into laughter when Steve pouted and groaned sadly. However, a second later it seemed as if the other man developed a better idea, because his eyes sparked like fireworks and he suddenly beamed.
They’d attacked the helicarrier. A whole ship, jam-packed with trained agents and the Avengers. It had been destined to fail from the very beginning.
He didn’t get the chance to finish. A second later and with alarming speed, two men rounded the corner and barrelled straight into Steve, knocking him backward about ten feet.
He blinked and scrambled up to his feet, unable to hold back the gasp of pain that the movement brought. He was close to throwing up again. “Cognitive exposure,” he said with a wave of his hand, “just made it up now, seeing if it-“
“I really would fucking hope so,” Sam jostled their shoulders together and then held on to his elbow as Steve’s 5-foot-nothing body almost lost footing, “I know this is probably scary as shit- but you’ll get used to it here. We don’t bite. Much.”
“Sweetheart?” He blinked and looked up from his tablet, turning to face Steve, who was smiling somewhat exasperatedly at him. “D’you get any of that, or were you off in your own world?”
Time and time again, Steve had done nothing but let Tony down. And yet here Tony was, patching him up, taking him in, not even thinking about it.
“Together,” Steve screamed, rushing forward as Thanos turned his head to face them, uncaring of them now that he had all those stones in his fist. He thought of Rocket’s words from years ago, as he’d talked about sharing the stone’s power and managing to escape alive. The idea cleared his mind of the fog and gave him a target.
“Not until this asshole’s left I won’t,” Bucky answered, and he heard Tony laughing behind him, empty and hollow.
He’d been searching for hours, traipsing through the brutal cold and calling his friends’ names until his voice had gone hoarse as he’d waited for any sign of a rescue party arriving; whether that be in a helicopter or a quinjet. He didn’t care. He’d just wanted
They briefly stopped, and Tony took the opportunity to briefly remove his mouth from Steve’s and grab at Clint, in order to pull him in and smack a wet kiss to his lips.
Tony cursed, shutting his eyes and running a hand through his hair, “villains choose the one time my suit is a thousand miles below me to attack us all. Great.”
Bucky said nothing. His brow was set in a deep frown, and his jaw a sharp line of tension. Wordlessly, he pulled up one of the front compartments of the car and then handed Steve a few tissues. He took them gratefully.
“Well, by all means Steve, initiate your grand plan. I’m intrigued as to how you’re gonna get around all these problems here.”
Natasha spotted Steve first, but aside from slightly elevating a perfect eyebrow and then nodding to Tony, she didn’t say anything. Steve wandered over slowly, watching Tony’s back intently because he was a sad, sad boy with far too large of a crush to be handling on a Friday morning.
Then the video cut out. That was the last one on the file. No more. Can’t have been more than 48 hours later that they shot her.
She, like everyone else, would undoubtedly have seen the news. She’d have seen the footage of Steve Rogers, on his knees, holding tight to the corpse of his lover. That was probably the only reason she humoured him.
“That’s it?” Steve asked shortly, although really, what else could have fucking happened? He’d only been gone for five fucking seconds.
He hoped to god that the others were coming. Not for his sake, but for Bruce’s and Rhodey’s and Nat’s. Someone needed to get them the hell out of there. He always told Thor off for summoning lightning in the tower, but God, what he’d give to see that crack of electricity in the air just then, or hear a drawled-out curse that told of Clint Barton’s presence, or the flash of a red white and blue shield as it arced through the air.
“I’ll only be gone a week,” Tony mumbled into his mouth like he’d read Steve’s mind, breaking off and looking up at Steve with a soft smile. “It’ll fly by, I promise.”
Sam shrugged. “I zoned it out, to be honest- if there’s one thing I will never be able to do, it’s mediate an argument between those two. I’m pretty sure some threatening went on though. Possibly name-dropped her knife collection or something. Either way, Clint wasn’t happy. He lost a date.”
Eventually, after a few more hours of loitering, they all got kicked out into the cold New York streets once more by a sleepy Natasha who declared she required a nap and ‘boyfriend time’. When Bruce, unwisely, asked why Bucky could get extra boyfriend time but they couldn’t get extra friendship time, Natasha simply stared at him and told him with a blank face, “well I can’t exactly peg
Tony's head jerked down to him, the harsh snarl on his face mellowing into one of bewilderment as he registered Steve's face. "What-"
Tony was laughing, shaking his head in despair as he looked up at the ceiling. “Oh God have mercy on my soul, I knew I should never have introduced myself to you, look what I’ve gotten into-“
Tony just rolled his eyes, revving his engine and then leaned forward to wave at Bucky. “Aw, babe, don’t worry, I’ll send him apology flowers later.”
Steve gasped a little, feeling a sharp stinging behind his eyes as he sucked in a small breath. Already, the nightmare was starting to blur back into nothingness- he could hardly even remember what it was about. All he could remember was Tony screaming; the sound ripping out of his throat violently, agonised, as if seconds away from death.
Steve pursed his lips and gripped his shield just that little bit tighter. “I’m not too sure yet,” he murmured, head turning back to the main machine in the centre of the room. That seemed like it might answer a few questions here. He moved cautiously forward, circling the instrument once and trying to see anything particularly telling. Of course, none of it really gave anything away, and there were no obvious power switches, so Steve was pretty much out of ideas. All he knew is that it was huge and connected to the weird tubes that were holding strangely familiar silhouettes. Steve really didn’t want to know what AIM had been working on. He just wanted to shut it down.
And so, biting his lip to keep himself from saying anything more to further upset the other man, Steve curled his hand around Tony’s good arm and then gently lifted him up, hearing him wince as he did so. “Yesterday, you called the Iron Man suit,” Steve started, walking Tony over to the door, “can you do that now?”
about what you’re doing, letting your stupid lizard brain take over as soon as you think I might be in the tiniest little bit of trouble and- and-“
Thor took the hint, starting forward and then falling into line with Steve with a weary smile. “Well, shall we?” He said, gesturing forward, “I would certainly love to meet the maker of Steve Rogers.”
Tony grunted, sounding like he was in pain. “I’ve seen better days,” he admitted, “not sure where I… oh, wait, JARVIS is gonna send you the coordinates now. I might need a bit of help getting outta here. Think my arm’s out of commission, among other things.” He made a small noise of discomfort again, and Steve pulled his phone away from his ear, watching as a screen popped up showing the winding streets of Santa Barbara and the red dot where Tony was. “Don’t let any government officials see you.”
knew that Steve could probably do a thousand times better than him, but Steve seemed content where he was, so Tony sure as hell wasn’t going to contest with that.
Tony sighed, running a hand across his tired face. He needed a shower. And a caffeine hit. And a vacation. “JARVIS, is there anyone in the kitchen who we can harass into making me coffee?”
Tony stared at the words for a long time. When he looked up, Steve was on one knee, and there was a ring held between his fingers.
Steve turned on his heel and then pressed his finger up against his mouth, kissing it and then brushing it over Tony’s mouth. It hurt less than the other sort of kissing that involved moving his nose. “Go and relax,” he said again, I’m gonna make us food, and you’re not going to apologize about anything for the rest of the night, okay?”
He bit his lip and felt his stomach sink even further. Oh God. He could stand to make his teachers upset, he could take the torment he might get from other kids- but one thing he never, ever wanted to see was Mrs. Wilson being disappointed in him.
“Okay, Rogers,” her hands clapped once more, and he didn’t even bother fighting the next needle, “but I promise you, you’re going to cave next time.”
Steve grinned again, before rolling off Tony and getting out of bed, throwing the clothes that had been laid out for them at Tony and then turning to his own wardrobe.
Fine. Absolutely fucking fine, of course he was- did Tony just think Steve had gone and spontaneously died in bed while he’d been brushing his goddamn teeth? Jesus Christ, he was so stupid. He swallowed and clenched his jaw, feeling a painful throb in his head as he did so.
“Honestly, that might actually be my favourite thing about you,” Tony laughed, focusing in on his cheeks as Steve just slapped a hand over them in embarrassment, “you blush so easily and
Although, maybe that was the point. Maybe this was an olive branch. Tony’s own way of saying sorry. And Steve was too desperate not to take it. So he turned around and smiled, and then stuck out a hand. With an amused little smile of his own, Tony took it and shook. “I would really appreciate that, yeah,” he murmured earnestly, “but where would we even start?”
Steve shut his eyes and bit his lip, pulling back the scream as it threatened to rip out through his throat. His captors had been at this for hours now. He felt as if his body was going to fall apart, crumble like a sandcastle being hit by a wave. They were killing him. Slowly.
“I’ll survive, Jarvis, just do it.” Tony’s voice was sharp and held no room for argument, and a second later Tony felt the extra burst of speed as JARVIS followed the command. He sped over mountain-ranges pushing Mach 4, feeling the way his head began to throb a little. He wasn’t supposed to sustain this sort of speed for more than a minute or so, and no doubt his body would pay for it tomorrow. But that didn’t matter right now.
by the way- and then turned and walked away without another word. I think you are the only person on planet earth who has managed to render him completely speechless.”
“Really? ‘Cause that definitely looks like your writing,” Steve’s fingers brushed over the desk, moving across blueprints for some sort of jet-engine design. “Look, there’s even swear words written in the corners, and I know for a fact you’re pretty much the only person on earth who uses the phrase ‘son of a cocksucking whore’ in their everyday vocabulary.”
“No he’s not, look, his eyes are definitely— oh, hey, look, see! I was right!” Steve pushed his eyes open slowly, looked at Clint. The man waved at him. “Hey, buddy.”
Nights were mostly just spent curled up either on the faded brown couch watching TV or up in bed, doing roughly the same but with some more added heavy petting. Steve made a mental note to buy new sheets for the owners upon their return, and all cushions with farm animals on them had been hastily piled into the corner on the first night. There was something intensely off-putting about locking eyes with a smiling cow caricature embroidered onto a pillow while you were balls deep inside your boyfriend- although it had made Tony laugh very hard when Steve had mentioned it, so he figured it wasn’t a total loss.
Tony shuddered, focusing on pulling off Steve’s running shoes and socks. That was not something he wanted to think abut. At all.
Steve nodded slowly, eyes automatically falling shut as Tony leaned in and kissed him again, seemingly unable to resist. Although sat on the desk, Tony was still at least a head taller- and really, that shouldn’t have been hot. It shouldn’t. But everything Tony embodied suddenly just seemed utterly irresistible, and Steve couldn’t stop himself from groaning a little as Tony braced his hands against either side of Steve’s thighs and leaned forward, pushing Steve back further and forcing him to wind his hands around Tony’s shoulders in order to keep himself balanced.
Then he shut the door again, content that all his morning tasks were complete. Of course, unwilling to let Tony have the last word, his phone buzzed as he got into the car, and he looked down to see Steve’s name at the front of his screen.
He didn’t turn around, but he knew when they hit the street behind him. They were walking far away, trying to be inconspicuous, but he knew. He had a minute, maybe, until they just got bored and jumped him.
“Boring, boring, compulsive liar, boring, gives terrible handjobs, underlying racist ideologies, boring, recycles her conversations every time she talks to someone,” Tony pointed a finger at each of the people in the room and then turned back to Natasha, giving her the saddest look he could muster. “The meeting is officially finished Nat, don’t make me stay any longer.”
He shuffled backward until his shoulders hit the cold walls. Instinctive. Hide, shield yourself. This was going to hurt, and Steve wasn’t sure how much more he could withstand.
“He’d been double dealing my weapons,” Tony said, his voice burning with anger, “planning on killing me so he could take over the business. I found out the week before the hit had been planned.”
Tony nodded and strode forward, taking in all the décor with a lip curled in distaste. Seemed HYDRA were still digging the ‘1970’s Soviet Russia’ look, which was ultimately unsurprising. They probably looked wistfully back on those times. He unlocked another door and slipped through, checking the corridor for threats. But there were none. It was silent—eerily so.
“What?” Steve said in bewilderment, and then there were more faces, concerned, yelling, and he blinked and he was somewhere else, shit, how had that happened? Hospital. White. Heart monitor. Was he dying?
In bafflement, Tony watched as his friends all prepared the dinner table around him, setting out plates, knives, forks, food, and even the Christmas crackers. Tony’s mind jolted, and he zeroed in on their colors, because if someone got the wrong one now then it was going to be really fucking weird—but Bruce just saw him looking, laughed, and then placed the red & gold Christmas cracker down between Tony and Steve. Tony watched the man suspiciously. How did he know? Had Tony told him?
like an episode of some sort back there,” Tony said sharply, the worry and panic seeping into his voice a little as he stared at Steve. The man looked gaunt; his hands covered his eyes, but it just accentuated how sharp his cheekbones were.
“Tony?” Steve prompted, and Tony wasn’t even sure whether this was actually Steve or just some vision, a pain-induced hallucination to help calm him. He appreciated his brain for giving him that, at least. “Tony, what do you want to tell me, hey?”
He imagined what it would be like for Tony, to be able to go out on the streets, hand in hand with Steve, kiss him around whoever he wanted to and never have to worry that something terrible would happen because of it. “What’s your plan?” Steve asked quietly, sitting up and leaning his elbows onto his knees, staring intently up at Tony. Because Tony was a genius, and Tony would have a plan. Of course he would have a plan.
Steve laughed, and Tony figured he was probably rolling his eyes. He knew exactly what Tony thought about his methods of transporting Tony places when he wasn’t making to move on his own—he was no princess, thank you very much, and he did not need to be bridal carried. Although, admittedly,
The tapping. The slowed reflexes. The short temper and the weary look and the seemingly constant presence of Steve down in the living room when everyone else slept soundly in their beds.
“No, dammit, we’re not, and I don’t see why it has anything to do with you, either!” Steve said angrily, turning to her in annoyance, “so can you just let it go?”
“You should,” Tony snapped, “you’re getting into trouble to try and fight my battles for me, and I don’t… God, I’ve already gotten you into enough shit as it is, you don’t need to do this for me.”
Tony cracked a smile, but shrugged. “He wants to talk, I’ll talk. He wants to fight- I can do that, too. I’m easy.” He winked on autopilot a the choice of words, but Steve got the message and began backing away worriedly.
He wanted Tony. He wanted Tony to make this better, to sit with him, rock him back and forth like a child in the way he only did when Steve was completely distraught, with his hands around Steve’s neck, his jaw, a soothing voice in his ear saying,
Steve was left by the road, staring at his friends on the porch and Bucky on the path with a face that could probably curdle milk. “You better have the best damn excuse in the entire world as to what just happened there, Bucky,” he said quietly.
“Just keep calm and stay quiet.” That was Natasha, hurriedly swooping down and pressing her own kiss against his temple. She grinned at him, looking dangerous. “It’ll take more than HYDRA to put me and James Rhodes down,” she informed, and then without another word, she turned on her heel and slinked out of the door, Rhodey hot on her heels. Tony tried to make a noise of protest, but it came out strangled and raw. He felt like he was burning up and freezing at the same time, and he could hardly see anything, his vision was that hazy. He knew he didn’t have long left before he was under again.
Tony let Clint take him and then once his hands were empty, decided to fill them with a mug of coffee. He moved through the kitchen to the coffee maker, a frown etched into his face. “Natasha’s right,” he pointed out, “we can’t just keep him here. But another superhero group might be a little better equipped with dealing with a superhuman kid, if you get my drift.”
. He shuffled nervously and never took his hands out of his pockets. He didn’t touch Tony unless Tony moved first, not once- not in bed, not in the field, nowhere.
Steve could hear that from the incessant ‘help me up’s he was commanding toward Clint in the room with him. He looked down at his hands and pushed them deep into the pockets of his hoodie. “I’m sorry,” he said again, the same phrase he must have said a thousand times before by that point, “I don’t know what to do.”
“I wish you’d have been able to meet her,” Steve said, the ache coming back just for a moment, but dulled more with the fondness of remembrance than the pain of loss, “she was amazing. Would’a loved you.”
Tony laughed loudly at that, and Steve frowned a little, before something clicked in his mind and he realized that there was probably a reason Tony found that so funny.
Steve looked at it with a raised eyebrow, noting the halloweeny themed foiled chocolates within the cardboard box. There were all sorts in there; caramel brains, mini toffee apples, white chocolate vampire teeth. And seeing as Steve seemed to never stop eating chocolate, it would help enforce some positive associations with Halloween if what he was enjoying so much was to do with the holiday, right?
“It’s 11 at night, sweetheart,” Steve slid gently into the room and shut the door. “He’s probably gone home and fallen asleep.”
“Life happened,” Steve laughed again before shrugging, looking off to the side. “Cancer. She worked so hard- all her life, working so hard for everyone but herself. Sometimes I think that’s what killed her- not the fucking tumor, just the weight of the world on her shoulders. She never said anything though. Never complained. She was always so… happy.”
“Helpful,” Steve muttered, flinging his shield down the corridor and watching in satisfaction as it bounced on the corner and knocked three people to their feet. It appeared they had ended up on the floor in which all the thugs were descending from- useful if Tony had been fully equipped with a functioning Iron Man suit, not quite so useful when all he had was Bucky’s old semi-automatic and a sore neck from working too many nights down in the lab.
The door was opened, and Peter heard the soft, anxious sigh his Pops let out upon seeing Peter, curled up on the bed with his back facing him.
Steve put his head in his hands, but before he could say anything else, a booming voice broke out in the room: “That is ENOUGH!” Principal Fury yelled, slicing a hand through the air, “now I want you to
His friends patted him on the back and told him to get some sleep when he got home, and Tony kissed him on the cheek and told him with a small grin that he better not catch Steve’s germs, and Steve smiled back with a roll of his eyes, sinking into Tony’s hug and letting himself be held for a few moments.
“No it isn’t,” he said, his face solemn, “I wouldn’t like it if you did it to me. And I know… I know that when you yell, it’s coming from a place of love.” He looked down and then shrugged, pulling a face. “Or at least I hope it is.”
He shut his eyes and stroked Steve’s hair off his face, before apologizing quietly and turning him over in order to attach the handcuffs to his back. It probably wasn’t comfortable, but Steve was unconscious. Tony was sure he would understand when he came back to himself. Although, he might not even remember any of this. When Bucky had first gotten out, he’d said he couldn’t remember large swathes of his life. Maybe it would be the same for Steve, which was probably for the best, considering the rather brutal way in which Steve had responded to HYDRA’s experimentation.
do that to yourself,” Natasha hissed, raising a finger and pointing at him, her eyes furious, “don’t you dare try and… trivialise this, okay Tony, we’re not stupid, none of us. We know what this did. To you, to him. It matters.”
“Hey, look, that’s not… I…” Steve spluttered, suddenly feeling the guilt pooling in his gut. Rhodey was right. He shouldn’t have left. Fuck, what if Tony hadn’t managed to do what Howard had asked? Howard had said he was gonna kill him- and Steve figured that was an exaggeration, but that didn’t matter. Steve had still just left Tony when he needed him.
, Tony. I won’t.” He blinked rapidly, thumb brushing the tears out of Tony’s eyes. His voice was wrecked. “It’s not fair to you and it’s not fair to me either. Please understand this. For me, Tony. I can’t— God, fuck, I just can’t bear it. It’s breaking my fucking heart.”
“What do you want?” Hawkeye snapped at them, his arrow still drawn, ready for whatever. “What did you come here for? Not just to piss us off, surely?”
Peter looked at Steve, now with soap suds dripping down his face, and cackled uproariously, fisting his hands and then beating down against the surface of the water. Both Steve and Tony grinned, Steve picking up another handful of bubbles from the bath and blowing it in Tony’s direction. Most of it ended up catching in his hair, damn it. Unfortunately, however, Steve was laughing with that carefree little chuckle of his and so Tony found it rather difficult to scold him for it. Instead, he turned to Peter who was also laughing, and then stuck out his tongue. “Oh, quiet you,” he snapped, smearing a handful of bubbles into the little boy’s face too.
“Okay, good.” He grabbed a glass of water from the table and then curled it into Tony’s hand. “Make sure you drink lots of fluids. Just—just stay relaxed today, alright? You need to let your body heal.”
The next time he looked at the clock again, it was nearly midnight. He’d worked for four hours, and now it all looked about ready. He’d still need to gather some more sources and material before he could launch it, but that shouldn’t take long. And then he could focus on promoting it to the masses.
But Tony had started up the engine, and not even Rhodey was able to convince him to stop. He took one last look at Steve, and the with a sad smile, he kicked off the break and drove away.
Steve rolled his eyes and laughed, taking Tony’s hands and hauling him up from the wicker chair with a quick peck to his lips. “Come on,” he said with a grin, “I’ll race you.”
Padding forward, he made his way to the living room. The TV was on, but turned down to an almost silent volume, and the couches appeared empty. Far off to the right, the windows of the tower glistened and tapped with the sound of rain against their panes. It was quiet. Peaceful.
