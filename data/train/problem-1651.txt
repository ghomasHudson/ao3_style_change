Talking about the bomb, then. Sherlock looked miserable, his face a mask of agitation. John couldn't see any trace of the man who had seemed so willing to care, in Baker Street, as they talked quietly about their experiences of the last two years.
"True."
, before he pressed it.
"So much for crack shot John Watson," Mark said, aiming his gun at John's head, as he moved toward John's gun hand, ready to step on it. "I suppose I'll have to kill you both."
He shivered as he remembered Sherlock, his hands on him, hauling him to safety, dragging him out into the world again.
The clock on the wedding planner's wall ticked loudly. John wondered how long they would have to sit here and wait, for an appointment he didn't want to keep.
"Yes."
In the mirror behind him, the vicar's things crowded around him in a jumble: his desk, piled with papers; a worn, tweedy sofa, over which John had draped the garment bag containing his suit; a bookshelf filled with everything from pulp science fiction novels to books on different world religions, as well as a range of books on Christian spirituality. The clutter was a comfort to John, giving him a familiar feeling, like he was halfway back to home, at 221B.
He needed to think his next move through, before he made it.
"Oh," John said, apropos of nothing, his voice shaky. "Come in."
"I'll never be yours," he told Mark. "I never was."
John opened the door, to find Sherlock standing there in his formal clothes, his hands held behind his back. He'd dressed himself identically to John: a surprise. In all the insanity of the last few weeks, John hadn't thought to ask what Sherlock had planned to wear, and Sherlock hadn't tried to discuss it.
He stared at Mark's last message.
"I wanted you to know. Was going to save it for the best man's speech, but we're not doing that."
"Stay here!" he growled. "This isn't over." He opened the door, and stepped outside, gun raised.
"Oh yeah. Wicked good film,
John laughed, a little. "Oh my God. Well." John felt a thousand things at once, as the initial panic at being found out subsided. A sharp vulnerability washed over him, along with a sudden plunging sensation, as if his feet had just landed on solid ground, after falling forever. He wasn't sure he liked it. "Doesn't mean I'm ready to launch a career. Those circumstances were particular."
He expected a conversation. Sherlock didn't offer one, but took John's plate, and placed it in the kitchen sink, then led him to the bathroom where they both brushed their teeth, watching each other in the mirror. John tried his best not to look like he wanted to eat Sherlock alive. He did want to, every night, for the rest of their lives. Sherlock smiled softly, and took the toothbrush from John's hand, and put it back in the glass in the medicine cabinet. He helped him into the bedroom, wordless, the wiry muscle of his arm holding John tightly. He deposited John on the bed, helped him lean back against the pillows, then padded back down the hall to the sitting room, returning with the Union Jack cushion from John's chair, which he slipped under John's injured leg.
Slowly, he drifted into a fitful sleep, in which dreams of Sherlock, haunting the doorway of his hospital room, returned again and again, until the sun rose, cheerful and bright over the parking garage outside his window, and a nurse came in, with what would no doubt prove to be a disappointing breakfast.
Out here, everything that was going on inside seemed to take on a patina of unreality. He knew he would have to return to it, but for now, there was the prospect of talking to Sherlock, and the relief he felt, at getting to be alone with him again. They hadn't had enough time, earlier. They never had enough time. Especially not today, when they'd finally managed to admit that they both felt the same way, that they really did want each other.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Always."
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. "Okay." He wiggled his fingers. "I might have to use my pickpocketing skills. I so rarely get a chance to these days. I hardly ever have a need for quick cash any more."
His smile turned into something decidedly feral. "You can talk to me anytime, John. Ask me anything. You know that."
Sherlock was on the floor, fumbling over the bomb, his hands busy, mumbling. "Oh God!" He lifted his face. He looked small and defeated, kneeling on the floor, panic moving over his features. Whatever else John could say about him, he could be a good actor when he needed to be. "I'm sorry."
When Sherlock was done, John reached for his lapel, and pinned Sherlock's boutonnière in place. He touched it lightly, smiling at the three spiky purple flowers at its centre. He leaned in. They carried a scent like oranges.
He tried to read a book, and when that failed to distract him, to watch telly, as the afternoon wore on into evening. The later it got, the more concerned he became, that things were not okay, that Mark knew, somehow, that he
John knew, standing here now, watching Sherlock tell him he should go, that he'd come here with an idea, burning in the back of his brain, that Sherlock should grab him and kiss him and own him. Sherlock could do anything, take John any way he wanted to, and John wouldn't say no.
John leaned forward, curious to see what she would tell him, as she seemed poised to singlehandedly steer the conversation well away from dull and innocuous, bless her. John remembered very well how the Hudson marriage had ended: with Sherlock guaranteeing Mr. Hudson's execution.
Bill looked down at his watch. "So here's your assignment."
Mark stroked him, and John joined his hand to Mark's, their fingers tangling, John speeding things along, pumping himself as fast as he could. His breath, harsh and ragged and panting, was the only sound in the room for a long, tenuous moment. John didn't care what else happened. He only wanted the oblivion of orgasm, to wash the dream of Sherlock out of his system.
"And your husband." Mark cast a glance over toward the bar. He smiled, and licked his lips, and ran a hand up over John's knee, and along the inside of John's leg.
He wished he could take it back.
"And you? You're all right with this? Best man? Coming to the wedding?"
John smiled at his phone, something warm and liquid expanding in his chest. "Since when do you care how I'm doing?"
He should never have told Sherlock he was his best friend. It was the worst kind of half truth, a thin, pale shadow of what he held in his heart.
"Where are we going?" The words came out as one syllable:
Harry was leaning on it, a shot glass in hand, talking to the bartender.
"What?"
He groaned as he tried to raise his head. Shadows swam at the corner of his vision, and an intense wave of nausea rolled up through him, then subsided abruptly. His tongue felt thick and swollen. He dragged himself up into a sitting position, his muscles heavy and unwilling, as he scanned the room again.
Anika nodded, and made a note in her book.
He kept expecting himself to feel better about it. It was supposed to be a good thing, being known, being understood, but the more he thought about it, the less he was able to reconcile that conversation with what he and Mark had together, with who Mark was. The affable, extroverted nurse didn't seem compatible with the man who was not only at ease with what John had done, but seemed, somehow, to admire it. The fact of that conversation sat like a scab that John couldn't avoid picking.
Sherlock had meant to say
John checked his watch. "Shit."
"I love you," John told him, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "God, I love you so much." He leaned in, and kissed Sherlock's forehead, kissed his cheek. "I can't believe you're back. Sherlock, I'm so glad. I can't tell you."
Sherlock clicked through the first few. They showed a domed white marble building, surrounded by minarets.
John's breath hitched in his throat. "Right. And you? You'll be okay?" He knew that neither of them would be. Not until he fixed what he'd broken.
It was time for John to act. Staying low, he opened the door, and moved down off the porch. The sun must be setting: only a little light remained. He listened for footsteps, listened for any sign of anyone, moving through the trees behind the cottage, or in the empty field in front of him. Nothing.
John nodded, his heart full, his mind steady, finally ready to tell Sherlock exactly what he meant to him. "Then I'll come back, just as soon as this is over. It's always been you, Sherlock. You keep me right. I could never be happy with anyone else, and I'm sorry for putting you through all this."
Sherlock had been in touch with the press, a fact that John still couldn't quite believe, but he hadn't called the police. He'd always left it up to John to be the responsible one, in the past. That much was still the same. John peeled off his glove, and took out his phone, looking at it for the first time since yesterday.
Sherlock raised his glass, and drained it. He was still watching John, his head tilted, his lips parted, eyes as sharp as ever.
Sherlock blinked hard. He tightened his grip on John's hands. Slowly, he focused his gaze, and raised it to meet John's eyes. John saw hope burning there. Good.
"I always—from the first," Sherlock said, his words halting, his voice hushed and raw. "I just didn't know how—that is to say, what to do."
John closed his eyes against the mix of emotions that moved through him. This was what he'd wanted, what he'd always wanted, conspiring with Sherlock, working with him on more than just the cases. He wasn't shutting John out. He was letting him in. Perhaps inviting him in, continuing the flirtation they'd started yesterday afternoon. John looked at his computer screen, at the blog entry that had probably reignited the trouble in the first place.
All at once Sherlock was on the move. He picked up his coat, which he'd left slung over the desk chair, and put it on. Without another word, he turned, left the flat, and bolted down the stairs.
He opened the front hall closet door. Mark's racquet bag was gone.
Likewise, he kept mum on the things he wanted to say.
"No. Not here, not for some time. Once Mycroft found this place, it became rather useless to me. He kept dragging me out of here and putting me in the hospital."
"It's all right." John's whole body burned with need. He covered Sherlock's hand, pressed against his heart, with his own.
John slipped down, and ran his fingers under the waistband of Mark's pants. He wondered, briefly, if he should talk, try to explain himself, but Mark was no idiot. He surely knew John had needed the release, needed to relieve some of the tension of the day. Besides, Mark was half hard, and moaning, as John slipped his pants off, pulling them all the way down over his ankles, and dropping them on the floor.
A slow grin spread across Mark's face. Pleased with John's answer, with John himself. "I suppose we did."
"And Mark? What does he say about all this?"
Mark stood, took the bowl from John's hand, and put it on the counter. "Not a thing could wake you." He leaned against John, and kissed him.
They were busy, in any case, making plans for the wedding. They agreed to keep it a small affair. John dutifully sent out a few emails, to some people at the Met, Mrs. Hudson, Molly Hooper, Harry, a couple of distant relatives, and a small handful of men he'd been close with in the army. He let them know he was engaged, and that they could expect invitations when he and Mark had settled on a date, and that the wedding would be soon.
"Yes, good."
John shifted uncomfortably, then forced himself to be still. He felt as though he'd been tricked into showing his hand, when he hadn't been aware he was playing cards at all. "I could never. That would put me on the side of the devils. The sort of people Sherlock works to catch."
"My what?"
John sipped, obediently, managed to swallow, then downed the rest. His head swam. Surely alcohol wouldn't really help, but he would do anything for this to be over, anything to gather the pieces of himself back together, so he could go to Sherlock, stop Sherlock from fading, or leaving, or dying again, right in front of him, or whatever it was he was trying to do.
"I’m not your mother," she told him. "I’ve no right to expect it, but just one phone call, John."
"Right."
John excused himself, nerves singing high danger. Mark whistled as he went down the hall the opposite way, toward the clinic storeroom.
Mark was talking, elbowing him. "Oi! Pay attention."
John imagined Sherlock, alone in his flat, convincing himself that it was better that way. John had thought, he'd believed, that the two of them had been a sort of family, along with Mrs. Hudson, in the old days. He didn't think it had been so bad, for Sherlock, back then. Perhaps he'd been wrong.
. He'd seen, and, if he'd met John's double, probably taken it out on him. John schooled his features. He couldn't afford to look startled. He held Mark's gaze, even as he leaned into him, pressing him harder against the counter.
Mark smiled at him, and looked at John tenderly. "Oh. I'm glad to hear it." His voice was low, and quiet, with a rough edge to it, like he was holding back some emotion that threatened to overwhelm him.
, finger and thumb not quite touching. John watched him until he moved to the next bee box, and slowly lifted the lid.
"Okay," Bill said, lowering his voice. "Still nervous. Thrilled, but nervous."
Mark let out a noise, then, like he'd been holding his breath for a long time, and had finally been able to let it go. He pulled John into a hug, and held him, while John swallowed bitterness, and stroked Mark's back, and tried to imagine what sort of calculations were flying through Mark's mind, that he could seem so invested, so sincere, while lying to John with every molecule of his being.
John lingered before he shut the door, studying the man's face in the light from the street, his pockmarked cheeks, his steady gaze. "Me too."
Mark smiled and shrugged. "Orphan's lot. No family. Just friends." He'd invited the women from work and their spouses, a couple of men he played racquetball with.
"God, Sherlock, no. This is terrible. Your friend—"
Sherlock half turned, glancing at John. He appeared, if anything, sheepish.
"Moved out of the country."
The vicar spoke his blessing, and smiled his approval, and Mark reached in and took John by the back of the head, kissing him hard before whispering in his ear. "I'm going to give you the time of your life. That's a promise."
He looped his arm around Mark's shoulder, and leaned into him for support, then leaned in a little more, and kissed Mark's cheek. As he pulled away, he caught Sally's eye, who winked at him. Approval, of a sort, he supposed.
"That's right. He hadn't seen you at all. Thank God he was in. You should have seen him, once he understood what was happening. He's like a bloody great superhero. Commandeered a motorcycle."
, and 6
John responded, like any loyal partner would:
His dreams leapt on him like a pride of lions, dragging him through murky London streets, where he ran, hand in hand, with Sherlock. In a rain soaked alley, Sherlock pulled him in, his hands roaming everywhere, sliding across John's chest, his neck, stroking a line over John's jaw. His kiss, when it came, rolled over John like an ocean wave. Then John was inside the coat, wrapped in it, and the two of them fell and fell, and the coat turned into soft blankets, and they landed, finally, in Sherlock's bed in Baker Street. Naked and strong together, they rolled, and Sherlock was on top of him, Sherlock's knees holding him down, Sherlock's arms caging him in, as John groaned and rolled his hips up, seeking friction, his head thrown back and a shout building in his throat, and Sherlock leaned down, and whispered something John couldn't hear, his name, maybe, or—
By the time John was finished with his patient notes, and on his way to fetch his clothes from the coat room, the clinic was empty. Mark had stopped by one last time to say goodnight, and then he was whisked away by the other nurses in a flurry of excited chatter, the moment they'd finished their shifts at 5:30.
. The hour before dawn on the first night, when John had lain awake, watching Sherlock sleep, and wondering what the hell he was going to do with himself. The long, lingering thoughts he'd had, nearly every day, before the end, that he should say something, do something, about everything he was feeling.
"That's right," she said, taking another step into the room. "Famous spot. Very popular with tourists."
Mark reached for his coat, which was slung over the back of his chair. He pulled his phone from his pocket, and flipped through it, until he found what he wanted. "Here."
The station had been emptied. No one was there, except for a small group of police, among them Sally Donovan, and Greg. Just inside the turnstiles, the promised group of reporters stood with cameras, and audio recorders. They all watched Sherlock as he headed directly for them, leaving John to trail behind.
"Met at work, then." Sitting down on the edge of his chair, Sherlock picked up the poker, and sifted through the cold ashes beneath the grate.
"Distraction. Playing on his ego. If he thought he had me where he wanted me, he was much less likely to think about you. Give you a chance to strike."
John was still staring at the suitcases when Mark came downstairs. "Don't you dare open those," he said.
Mark wasn't giving him any room at all. Nothing for it but to start, to try to explain, and see where it took him. "So, Mark. Listen. Listen, I know it hasn’t been long. I mean, I know we haven't known each other for a long time." He looked down at his hands, then back up at Mark's patient smile, his nod of encouragement.
John made a small sound in the back of his throat, and stepped into Sherlock's embrace. There, out on the pavement, for anyone to see, the two of them held each other for a second, and another, and another, and John closed his eyes, as his whole body softened against Sherlock's, as the two of them sealed the adventure of the day, and the quiet conversation they'd just had, with the simplest, and most hard won, of gestures.
Another message from Sherlock came through.
The vicar began the traditional service John had wanted, asking that God "Pour into our hearts that most excellent gift of love."
John went back to the newspaper article that included the details about the body found on November 5. Witnesses had reported hearing a scuffle in the early hours of the morning, men arguing, and then shouting at each other, at the edges of the cemetery where the body had been discovered, in a neighbourhood adjacent to John's.
"Well, good." John cleared his throat, soldiering on. "Because Sherlock, I want you to know, I really do want you to be there."
Two days after the graveyard, on a Sunday afternoon, one of the grand bright days of autumn, John returned to Baker Street. He let himself in and stood in the front hall, breathing in the scent of pine cleanser, and the smell of sweet lemon coming from Mrs. Hudson's flat. She was baking. Lemon squares. One of Sherlock's favourites.
John put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "So the whole scenario with the flash drive really was just a setup. What was the point of it, then?"
"You will." Mark slid down under the covers, knocking his feet up against John's. "Don't be ridiculous."
He'd asked for John to be still, so John held perfectly still, as Sherlock rode John lightly, pressing his weight down into John, and finally lowering himself like a swan, dipping down over John's chest, and kissing him full on the lips, his tongue pressing in to meet John's, the holiness of the moment stretching out between them. John ached to touch, to roll Sherlock over and grind down into him, but he'd promised to be good, and he knew he had to be careful. He could easily forget himself and pull his stitches. He could easily break the spell Sherlock was carefully building between them.
He thought about the way Bill always commented on the blog, the way he'd offered his friendship to John over and over, despite the fact that John was always caught up in his own world. Some hidden gear turned over in John's mind, some broken connection healed, and he realised that it was, perhaps, entirely possible, that these people would try to help him, if he gave them half a chance. He thought of Sherlock, who seemed to have a hundred different points of contact with people whose expertise and assistance he could draw on, when he needed to. For all that he talked about being alone, Sherlock wasn't. Maybe John didn't need to be, either.
The kettle boiled, and as John poured water into his mug and watched the tea stain it, he thought about how strange it was, that nothing between him and Sherlock was unknown to the forces that worked to separate them.
"Only if he doesn't like you. I think you'll be pretty safe. You're going to help with a case we're working."
"Good, good." He inhaled sharply, and let out his breath. Jill had just been a cover story, then.
to Sherlock, and the way he'd swept John off his feet, but never, not even once, tried to take advantage, not even when John wanted him to.
Sherlock's eyes were closed, his whole body frozen, as if he were steeling himself for something, as if he were totally petrified. He was still shaking, a sighing mess of a man who even now seemed ready to collapse against John.
"The unsolved ones."
Then they were outside. Outside, and John was being bundled into a car, and that was good, or at least, he had an idea that it should happen, although he suddenly felt much too cold. He shivered.
John wasn't fine. He would never be fine again. He had tried, had said what he'd always wanted to say, and it was over.
Mark raised his eyebrows. "This is new."
All at once, John broke open. All his dreams, his fantasies, came flooding through him, viscerally, despite the audience on the sofa, despite the fact that he was with someone else. None of that mattered, apparently, because all he wanted, all he could think of, in this moment, was running his fingers through Sherlock's hair, tugging his head back, and kissing that long throat; undoing the straining buttons on his shirt, and sliding his hand across his sighing chest.
He dug through the other suitcase. It held Mark's clothes, no extra pair of shoes. At the bottom, he found a large sealed plastic bag, that appeared to contain every piece of identification John owned, and more: three copies of his driver's license, with names that weren't his on them; a European Health Insurance Card with another false name; an American passport; a birth certificate from Canada. He placed the bag back where he found it, and zipped the suitcase closed, mind reeling. Mark could take him anywhere in the world, with all of that, and no one would be any the wiser.
John swallowed hard against his own desire, which bucked and fought its way to the surface like a drowning animal. "
He looked into its blind eye, knowing that it had long since stopped recording anything. All the concerns about the network, and the threat against his life, had amounted to nothing. His grand plans to defend himself had turned out to be completely unnecessary. He'd been so determined, so eager to grab onto something he could push against. But there hadn't been anything to fight at all.
Sherlock was just being cautious, just getting used to being back home. He hadn't meant that John should stay away, not really. Here they were, shoulder to shoulder, like they had been in the old days.
He locked his phone, and watched the traffic go by, needing a moment to sort himself out. He closed his eyes, and ran his fingers across his lips, as he dropped into the sensation of being held, of Sherlock, somehow, knowing to put his arms around him while he let go of everything he'd been holding. He was still amazed by his own reaction, the fact that he hadn't run, or denied himself. He'd stayed, and accepted what Sherlock had to offer, and it had been good. Better than good. Incredible. Unprecedented.
Putting on Mark's clothes was like climbing into a fresh point of view, some normal time and place, where life carried on just fine, of its own accord. His shirt smelled faintly of washing powder, a brand different from John's, and Mark's soap or cologne, something reminiscent of cloves.
John pulled out the chair and sat, looking up at Sherlock, at the offered mug with the eyeball in it. "Uh."
"I've never been more certain of anything." He took out his phone, opened the email he'd found earlier, and handed it over to Sherlock, so he could read it for himself. "I think I've got just the one."
Sherlock sighed, and kissed John's cheek. He said John's name, softly, as if he needed to try it out, to see if it had changed, somehow, now that they'd finally landed in this good place. He spoke it again, more sharply, and John rallied, aware that he was losing it, nearly at the point where he wanted to let go, and sink into the dark. Sherlock tugged on his arm, and helped him to his feet, while John's limbs shook from the kiss that still reverberated through his entire body, and the drug that even now continued to race through his veins.
He was satisfied. There was no reason to think Mark would notice anything changed, when he returned home tomorrow, except, perhaps, John himself. John, and the cupboard door. He rubbed his fingers across the gouge he'd made with the chair. He didn't think he could repair it in time. He would have to leave it, would have to make some excuse.
Mark grinned. "Although, maybe I should be jealous. Six months of bristly kisses for me, and his nibs comes back to town—"
He looked out the window, at the rain-soaked evergreens in the small sanctuary of a yard behind Ella's office. He'd known the question was coming. Trying to answer it was the reason he'd kept this appointment. Still, it shook him. It was too big. The potential answers had too many implications for his life.
Mark's habitual rakish smile faded. He nodded, his eyes narrowing, as he waited for what John would say.
Footsteps approached, and a bright flame touched the woodpile, and a flare of light and heat leapt toward the sky, licking at the ceiling of branches over John's head. The crowd cheered, and John writhed on the ground, managing to move in tiny increments, mere inches. He tried to cry out again, and still, his voice did not come.
Mark sat forward in his chair, his head tilting as he took John's hand. In the darkened room, his eyes were heavy-lidded, absent holes, his grin a bit too toothsome. "Hey, you."
"Hush now. Kiss me." John pressed himself against Sherlock's body, chest to chest, belly to belly.
"You don't regret leaving him? You've had a bit more time to think about it now."
He moved along the trail, his feet crunching on frost-hardened leaves, the only sound against the far-off sigh of traffic. A thin snow began to fall, just a few flakes, that caught and glistened in the light of the torch.
"Ah, that's what we're just trying to figure out," John said. "Skipped off for a bit, but you know, I'm sure he'll be back."
"I was saying. I was so unhappy, when we met. You know that, but I'm not sure you appreciate how much you've changed my life." It wasn't untrue. John felt a small measure of confidence returning. So long as he kept on saying things he really meant, he should be fine. He could do this. "I want you to know that no matter what happens, you've got my full attention. You're my focus now."
John looked at the kitchen sink. It was piled high with laboratory glassware. He wondered if Sherlock was eating properly. "You could stand up with me. If you wanted. Be my best man." He felt like he was going to die.
"He's been composing," she said. "Lovely stuff, just beautiful. Don't tell him I said so. I think he wants it to be a surprise. I think he's writing it for you. You know, deep down, he really is a romantic."
"Don't you forget it!" she shouted, as she stumbled into him.
Mark leaned forward, and kissed John's forehead. He bent down and pressed his face into the side of John's neck, the bristles of his beard scratching John's ear, his cheek.
"Christ, no," he said aloud, to the empty kitchen. He lurched through a memory of Sherlock's face—tender, vulnerable—as he held out his arms for John. Sherlock's voice—quiet, tentative—as he asked,
John made a plan, a promise to himself, to tell Sherlock everything he felt, every day, once this was finished. He would do whatever he had to, to see that look on Sherlock's face again, under more ideal circumstances.
Clearly Sherlock had shown up at the restaurant with the full intention of taking the piss. That bow tie, impersonating the wine waiter, the moustache, coming off all showy and over the top, waiting for John to notice him. Wasn't that Sherlock all over?
In a bubble of heady excitement for the future, breathing the good, cold air of the impending new year, John stood under a clear winter sky, shovel in hand, as a sudden burst of wind rustled through the ivy leaves at the back of the yard. It took him only a moment to pry up the flagstone and find the tablet and battery he'd buried weeks before, still dry in their plastic bag, and just as dead as he'd imagined they would be.
"Genius," Sherlock said. "Runs in the family."
" Those were John's own words. Mark was quoting his blog. "I've never seen such an obvious fib. You killed him, and you and Sherlock covered it up."
"Good."
"Of course, yeah. Avoid the rails. Great!"
. Too late to help your friend," she said to Sherlock. "Sorry about that. Really didn't think he would attack someone who wasn't part of his gang."
"Not a second."
"Well, at first I just thought that the spambot who wrote this message was pretty smart, raiding my contacts list, maybe." Mark leaned in, smelling of warmth and home, and a hint of woodsmoke. He scrolled to the next message. "Then this came through. See? Every third word."
In the centre of the room, standing on a red Persian rug that was clearly new, was a small, round table with two chairs. There was food, apparently: several takeaway containers with their covers on peeked out from under a folded wool blanket.
Mark watched him, his eyes in shadow, as John bent down and took him into his mouth, working on him slowly, until Mark's fingers ran through John's hair, and he caressed the back of John's head, and began to gently buck, shifting himself across the bed of John's tongue.
Mark poured him a cup. "You shaved for him, didn't you?"
John hated the way he'd left things, with the promise he'd made, to talk, when he'd believed that he could travel a direct line between what he had, and what he wanted. Sherlock had accepted that promise, and he'd gone a step further, speaking to John through the gift of the watch, in code, the safest way he could. With a beauty and a delicacy John would never have guessed him capable of.
Sherlock's ellipsis appeared, and dropped away again. While John waited for his reply, he skimmed through the articles once more, looking for deeper connections. Three of the victims were in the country on visas: one from Georgia, and two from Serbia. The other two were British citizens, and had criminal records: one had been incarcerated briefly for fraud, and the other had been charged with illegal firearms possession.
John would do anything he could, to make it leap into life. "You don't."
"Oh. I was hoping we could do something quiet. Stay in, maybe? Stag do tomorrow—yours too." The nurses were planning to take Mark out for some kind of wild party. They'd mentioned a strip club. John could only imagine the noise, the secondhand embarrassment, and thank Christ that Greg Lestrade knew he would never go for something like that. "Friday, I expect we'll be busy packing for the trip, wherever we're going."
"Oh."
John smiled. "Sure."
He arrived home at quarter past nine, fully forty-five minutes after Mark would have left for work. He let himself in, and climbed the stairs to the second floor, feeling like he'd slipped out of sync with the world. No one knew where he was, what he was doing. He found himself enjoying the lack of accountability.
John gasped and his orgasm crashed over him, and even as he came on Mark's belly, even as he collapsed into Mark's warm, strong arms, he knew that the dream wasn't just a blip, an error spat out by his subconscious.
"That's just it," Sherlock said, looking out the window again. "They're trying to get to me, by harming you. Threatening you."
"Maybe. That all right?"
He'd ended up taking the long way home. The fine mist that collected on the surface of his skin, and the chill of the November night air, helped to clear his head, allowing a plan to come to the surface.
. Mark, wide-eyed, speaking softly, had told him that Sherlock was just looking out for him, that the plan to keep them separate was for his own safety. John had lost his temper.
Mark's fingers rubbed John's temples. "I think you're capable of more than you own up to. I know you shot that man."
And yet. There'd been their careful conversation, the day they caught Jonathan Small, and the veiled promise of the watch and chain. Time slowed, and stopped, and reversed.
"Get your hand off me," John said, through gritted teeth.
Then came the deep baritone rumble. "Go, John. Murder is afoot. And marriage."
Just before one o'clock, the sound of the front door of the flat opening and closing jolted John out of a light doze. It was followed by the distinct zip and rustle of a jacket being removed. The front hall closet door. Heavy footfalls, in shoes, then soft ones, in sock feet, as Mark climbed the stairs.
John only had time to pat Mrs. Holmes's elbow awkwardly before Mr. Holmes was on his feet, smiling shyly, and sticking out his hand for John to shake. "A pleasure. I'm a huge fan of the blog. Especially the most recent bits. I know it wasn't easy for you to keep going after—well. The less said about that, the better."
mentioned John's name, calling him Sherlock's
"Hey!" John's voice was too loud, his greeting, too exuberant. "How did you get in here?"
"The secret to following someone is to be a few steps ahead of them," Bill said, laughing at John.
"Morning." As John rolled over, Mark smiled at him, and yawned.
John had offered everything. More than Sherlock had bargained for. He'd made a mistake. A terrible one.
John smiled at the casual acknowledgement that Sherlock had been following what he'd been writing through the keystroke logging software.
"The thing I don't understand is, why did I get the warning message? I'm no one."
He faked a smile. "Thanks. Shall I pay, then?"
"Please, John. Eat. It won't stay warm forever."
"Still not telling you where we're going." Mark pinched John's ear. "I meant on more of a permanent basis. Maybe a change of career."
Cath giggled. "Sorry. Didn't mean to spoil the surprise."
"Hi," he said, wondering how far he could take the facade, how his body would or wouldn't respond, to what Mark clearly had in mind.
He remembered the racquet bag, and laughed. "Kids into playing squash in the middle of the night, then?" He imagined there would be an excuse for that as well—a quick morning game so Mark could wake himself up, Jill living right by the club—of course, of course. An explanation for everything, offered before John even had a chance to ask.
the group Mark was working with. She'd been placed in the clinic a short while after Mark, to watch him.
Neither of them were their old selves, he supposed, as he rode through the neighbourhood, standing on the pedals to get more power, going faster, and faster.
It was Sherlock's life on the line, though, not just his. It was whatever future they could have together, that he'd be risking.
Mark fixed John with a look, like the answer should be patently obvious. "Because I didn't want to deal with your shit, John. You practically tore my balls off when I tried to help with the plan at Westminster Station."
Sherlock sighed. "It never came into focus. Not in any way I could grasp. It seemed almost as if there were some sort of internal struggle going on. Conflicts of interest, I suppose. Seems like targeting you, and me, for that matter, may have fallen by the wayside."
John allowed the rest of the long ceremony to wash over him, spoke his
"Okay." A long silence stretched out, filled only with the sound of the wall clock in the kitchen, the seconds ticking.
Mark ran his hands down John's sides, held him by the hips, and tugged him closer. "But you're awake now, aren't you?"
"Please, come sit with me. Come on, over here." He was barely standing. He couldn't have what he wanted, but he could have something, just for one night. Something good, to try to hang his dreams on. "Come on, come sit. Talk."
Mark sighed heavily. "I never expected to be in the spotlight, John. That's for you and Sherlock."
Sherlock had been in the papers again, a couple of days ago, for solving a case of false identity. A young man had tricked a woman into believing that he was the son she'd given up for adoption, twenty years before. He'd moved in with her, and had been slowly draining her bank account, and selling her jewellery. As a final flourish, the papers had added that Sherlock had found the woman's actual son, and advised both of them never to meet.
John fought a brief flutter of guilt. It was followed by an abrupt plunging sensation, as if the floor had fallen out from under him, because after that, the comments changed.
Sherlock needed to understand him, to understand this.
"John!" Harry. "It's five after, John! Everyone's waiting."
Mark shifted beside him, laughing, bright, and placed a hand on the small of John's back, rubbing circles there. Claiming him. John grimaced, still studying the close weave of the napkin. How perfectly white it had been, before he'd used it to wipe the corner of his mouth.
This was the new Sherlock, John realised, the one who showed vulnerability sometimes, the same man he'd seen that first day, in the Landmark, and again at 221B, when they'd first spoken to each other. John had barely recognised him, hadn't paid enough attention. He would speak deliberately now. Acknowledge what he was seeing.
, the day that Mark had lied to him about where he'd been the night before. He remembered finding the evidence that Mark hadn't slept in their bed. Maybe he hadn't come home at all, until just before John had woken up.
John might need weeks, months, to understand Mark's agenda. That meant staying right where he was, and leveraging whatever he could, to get information. The wedding, the marriage, would have to be part of that. It was vital that Mark believed that John really wanted him, really wanted their relationship to work. He would have to fake it, in order to stay close to Mark. To hide in plain sight, just like Mark had done.
John read it, feeling a small measure of relief. The excuse seemed paltry enough, but at the very least, it was there: a comfortable fiction that John could question, or not.
Within the hour, John and Sherlock were sitting together on a park bench facing the gates of Buckingham Palace, waiting for Private Stephen Bainbridge, member of the Queen's guard, and their new client, to finish sentry duty. The air was sharp and cold, the winter sunlight weak, but welcome. Sherlock's complexion had taken on a hint of pink, a bit of his old vigour returning, John hoped.
At 6:30, the front door camera showed Mark letting himself back into the flat, racquet bag over his shoulder. No doubt he'd stowed it in the front hall closet, where he always kept it. He would have still had time to take a shower, get dressed in his work clothes, and make coffee, before the alarm woke John at 7:15.
Mark laughed. "John Watson, you have yourself a deal."
John nodded. "Maybe he wants me to confront him. Maybe break my promise to go with him. It's just another game of cat and mouse. He knows I can't refuse him."
John hovered by the door. "If you've got a case, I can come back later."
John laughed, a little, for lack of anything better to do, feeling his face flush, avoiding asking the obvious questions. Sherlock knew everything about him. Of course he did. Their lives had always been entangled. He didn't feel the embarrassment he imagined he would. There was no shame in this. Just a slowly unfurling, and very welcome, and probably inappropriate relief.
"Oh." John looked at Mark more closely. They were about the same size, he noted, with more interest than he should have.
John's personal rhythms, such as they were, seemed to be all over the place: sometimes he couldn't sleep at all, and he paced the flat, restless and kicking against the feeling that things weren't what he wanted them to be. At other times, he slept so heavily he could barely wake up, as if his body were trying to catch up all at once.
Still, he should have known, would have, if he'd been paying attention. He'd taken notice of the new nurse and receptionist right away. Mark was cheerful, competent, efficient. Within a few hours, he'd charmed the other staff, was joking with them in the break room. When John had gone in to fetch his tea, Mark had shot him a look—eyebrow raised, his cherubic face all smiles. Surrounded by women, but he seemed to only have eyes for John.
A few moments later, he saw a flash of pale metal and glass in a clearing ahead of him. He stepped forward, the torch illuminating a wall, made up entirely of windows, built into a hillside, a sort of greenhouse structure, facing south. Before the trees had grown up around it, it would have caught the sun all day long. It was clever, really, so well insulated, that it would probably be warm enough to grow things through much of the winter.
His protests died on his lips.
John laughed, and straightened out the tablecloth in front of him, more shaken than he should have been. He took a deep breath, and blew it out again. It was probably a leftover bit of trauma, but he hated the feeling of watching Mark leave, when everything hung in this sweet balance, the two of them ready to take their next step. The timing was frankly ridiculous. Still, he couldn't deny Mark anything, not when he knew he'd be kissing him soon enough, under circumstances that should make both of them happy.
"Agra." Sherlock said, turning to look at her.
"Ah, sorry love. You got my text, though?"
He moved to the window at the end of the bed, the one that faced the same direction as the door. He pulled the curtain aside just enough to see out through it, and found nothing but trees, and the low understory that tended to grow in older woods, pale green groundcover and moss. Beside the window stood a rickety porch, with wooden steps leading down to a clearing, where he assumed Mark had been keeping the car. Van, he corrected himself, as he tugged the curtains back into place, remembering that, sometime in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, they'd traded away the car.
Sherlock hadn't meant for John to react the way he did, not at all. He'd only been worried that John was angry with him, wanted John to accept his apologies. That was the point of this whole ordeal, to wrench forgiveness out of John. Ridiculous, when it was there for the taking, when John had already given it freely.
In saying nothing, Sherlock had answered him, in the kindest way he could. He didn't return John's feelings. Not the ones John had offered.
With a sensation like he was falling, John realised that Sherlock hadn't reciprocated anything he had said, hadn't reacted to any of John's confessions. He'd held still while John kissed him. That was all.
He remembered the clerk, William, who'd sold the kit to him, the way he'd smiled shyly at John, and flirted. His opening sales gambit.
John stood up from behind his desk, and met Mark in the centre of the room. He slid his hands around Mark's waist, and pulled him close. A simple gesture, easy. Something thousands upon thousands of couples did, every day.
"Well," John said, as the server cleared their plates. "I know I'm ready for a bit of a stretch."
John raised his eyebrows. "Only if you have some. It's traditional."
"You're sure you don't want one of these other systems? Flashing lights? Sirens? A lot of people feel they work very well to stop potential break-ins."
"You forgot your gun, didn’t you?"
"Mm. I heard him say it myself, at the pool."
That truth sat in his belly like a hard stone, all through the rest of the day. He imagined it would, for a long time, until he learned to reconcile himself to it.
Violet nodded. "Extortion was part of it, but it wasn't everything. They took Baccarin away, just like they plan to do with you, John. They worked on him, hollowed him out. Baccarin wasn't his own man, by the time Mark and his friends finished with him. He had no idea why he did what he did. In the end, he tried to get out, tried to help us with the investigation, but he barely knew his own name any more. I interviewed him. He was a shell of human being. A set of impulses and drives that barely knew what was happening."
At least he had clarity. Bitter bile rose up in his mouth. He swallowed against it, and the metallic flavour that came with it. If Sherlock decided it was safe, when he decided it was safe, they might, someday, carry on with some semblance of what they'd had before. They might, eventually, be partners in Sherlock's work again.
John moved to the music, watching the flashing lights on the dance floor, feeling the bass pulse at him, trying to get at him through his clothes. There were hands on him, hands on his waist, slipping along his lower back. Good, strong, masculine hands. He leaned back into the touch, dreaming of Sherlock, the music thumping the life out of him, people dancing all around him.
John squinted at him. Mrs. Hudson had said Sherlock was pacing all day, waiting for him to arrive. Nervous. This was a show, then, an attempt to appear busy. John's heart expanded painfully in his chest, his anger and hatred finally, totally defeated by his love for this man, who did not love him back, but who cared, John supposed, in his own, ridiculous, backward manner.
John schooled his voice. "You're the one to worry about."
"Might be late tonight," Mark said. "You okay by yourself?"
"Thank you," he told her, feeling a thousand different things at once, and wondering how in the hell a tailor was going to make him a suit, when he hadn't been in for a fitting. He would find out, he supposed. An unfamiliar feeling moved through him, a warm, quiet affection for Sherlock, for everything he could do, for the fact that he cared, in his own way.
"More than one way to do that. I just wonder if maybe you should be doing something like Sherlock does. Freelance, you know? You can solve problems just as well as he can."
The voices from the tunnel grew louder, and he heard the sound of gravel crunching under boots.
As he waited to enter the chapel, John's eyes found Sherlock immediately, standing in his place a few feet away, opposite Cath, who stood on Mark's side. Sherlock seemed to be studying Cath, who was watching him with what appeared to be equal interest, something a bit predatory in her eyes.
"I was saying, exactly, you're exactly right. We want to show up, look great, eat cake, dance, and call it a day. We don't want to worry. Anika is going to take care of everything. All right?" He leaned in conspiratorially. "Besides, she's doing this as a favour to Mrs. H, giving us a bit of a discount. So be nice."
"Anyone who peers in through the tinted windows between the main pub and the party room at
"Yeah." John got his feet onto the floor, and stood up, feeling sleep-heavy, and warm, as he went over to his dresser drawer, and fetched the ring box.
The third, he could at least understand:
"What?"
He continued scanning through the captured images, which recorded more neighbourhood traffic, and him and Mark, coming and going from the house on Sunday. They'd gone out for breakfast, he remembered, and taken a walk after. Sunday nightfall saw a drop in activity, just a couple of neighbours he recognised out for a stroll, and then not much of anything until just before dawn, the next day.
He'd been ashamed, then, of how low he was. He hadn't wanted her to see. He'd started to talk to Sherlock, at his grave, and those conversations were private. He couldn't share them with her, so he'd stopped making plans to include her on those visits. Eventually, he'd stopped coming round to Baker Street altogether.
As far as Mark knew, John was a faithful man, maybe spun a bit by his infatuation with Sherlock, but nothing more than that. The sort who would worry about hurting Mark's feelings, who would rush to repair any rift he'd created. Hours had passed since Mark had sent the message about the blog comments. John had fixed the post, after a fashion, but he'd never replied.
Sherlock nodded, breathless. "Anything."
Sherlock glanced at John, then back down at the floor. "No. I'm quite sure I gave him your correct measurements."
"You've got a few more minutes left in you," Mark said. "Time enough for one more dance." He smiled. He looked so pleasant. He always had looked nice, and smart, and like he meant well. Appearances. Couldn't count on them for anything.
He stared at the fireplace, at the soot that marked its walls, at the fine grey ash in the bottom. He longed to sit here with Sherlock, all day, into the evening, to start a fire, to let it burn bright.
John sighed, heavily. The thing to do, the thing he knew he should do, was to stop, and think, and figure it out. Be strategic about how he approached Sherlock. How he handled himself. He kept typing anyway.
John opened the files and read, jaw clenching, a high tension building in him. As he finished, panic bloomed across the surface of his skin, and he knew he needed to go outdoors, to move, to get away from the flat and everything it meant to him now: a trap, a series of implied promises that had been broken before they'd been made. The potential for a violent end. He had nowhere to be for the next few hours, not until the appointment with Arthur Davies, Sherlock's tailor, at 2 pm, which, he supposed, he absolutely needed to keep, now that he had to go through with the wedding. There was still time for him to fit in a bike ride first.
John felt the same sensation of his heart expanding, and catching fire, as he had before. That, he was certain, would never change, even if the last month, of separation, of receiving small, considerate favours he didn't deserve, had allowed something new to come in, something softer, and quieter, that he couldn't quite name. He took another step forward. "Bit of a letdown, that."
The flat was exactly as it had been. Mrs. Hudson twitched back the curtains, making the dust fly, telling him that she couldn't bear to let it out to someone else. She talked about donating some of Sherlock's chemistry equipment to a school, but she hadn't packed a thing.
His phone pinged: a text alert. He grabbed it, prepared to explain himself to Mark, to tell him that he was taking care of everything.
"I couldn't allow anything to happen to you," Sherlock murmured, into John's hair. His hands came to rest on John's shoulders.
Sherlock groaned, and the groan became a growl, and his eyes flew open, and he looked utterly lost.
Regular, human stuff. Soothing. Normal.
The ellipsis appeared, hovered, then disappeared.
The first thing John did when he entered the flat was check the hall closet. Mark's shoes were not on the rubber mat they kept inside of it; the coat he'd worn to work wasn't there, and neither was his racquet bag. He hadn't returned yet, then.
Sherlock smiled. He met John's eyes, then dropped his gaze. "It’s a cross I have to bear."
"Well. Cheers to the wedding." He drained the rest of his glass, and looked at Sherlock, who was frowning at his plate, his face pale, and felt immediately guilty, as he remembered the text Sherlock had sent:
The bottom corner of the blanket on Mark's side was still neatly folded, just like it had been, when John went to bed the night before. The sheet was still tucked between the mattress and box spring, as though Mark had never been to bed at all. Pulling everything out of place was usually the first thing he did when he got in. He was a warm sleeper, warm generally. He liked to stick his feet out when he slept.
"What?"
"Must have been strange for you, killing someone who looked like me." John pulled back, and summoning every ounce of strength that he had, stared into Mark's eyes until he broke.
John watched helplessly from the doorway, his nerves raw, feeling tired and cold and small.
He couldn't speak aloud. Not under the circumstances.
John felt a surge of nausea run through him. His eyes fluttered shut, as the edges of his vision grew black, and he was sure he was passing out, but the noise and thump of the music came back to him. Not yet, then. He wondered when this part would be over. He was getting tired of the noise, of the party.
"Not talking about that one. The one I couldn't solve before I left. Can't solve now. Never could. I'm always late. Always too late. Timing, John. It's everything."
"This is all about me," John said.
John smiled fondly, his heart bursting with the need to tell Sherlock he knew he was lying, but it truly was okay, because he'd solved it. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
John's stomach clenched, rioting against the way Mark seemed to be taking Sherlock's side. At the same time, Mark was right: John had changed. He couldn't imagine how he and Sherlock could possibly work together, now that everything was so different. He couldn't imagine sitting in the same room with him. Where would they even begin?
Suddenly John was heavy with emotion, heavy with the reality of what he'd decided to do. He held up the bottle of red. "More wine?"
"Hello," he said. He shut the street door carefully, breathing hard. The familiar hush settled on the hallway, the sounds from the outside world, muted.
"Well, I think I have a pretty good excuse. Not every day I get picked to play Guy Fawkes."
Sherlock's voice was low, quiet. "You don't remember?" The tendons in his neck flexed as he turned his head. He uncrossed his legs, and crossed them again. His hands still clutched the armrests of his chair, as if he were hanging on for dear life.
Sherlock managed a smile, but didn't look up at him.
Mrs. Hudson clearly hadn't been. Mrs. Holmes had said something, though, about being upset, about people thinking the worst,
John struggled, as he sat with Mark, and the news anchor said something about the decision that had been reached in Parliament, to see something in the way Sherlock had behaved, something that meant John should reach out, text, call, offer to talk. What had happened between them, it hadn't been trivial, even if it was nothing Sherlock wanted.
"You can have that back if you want," John told him. "I only took it because—"
He put his phone back in his pocket. "Fine."
"I know, I know. I'm not fishing for details."
"Just, for the record." His voice was thick with emotion, but he couldn't stop talking. "Those days, before, at Baker Street, with you, were the happiest of my life."
Chest clenching, John rolled onto his side, drew his knees up, and wept.
"Why am I here?"
Mark had made him forget, if only for a moment, that his life was a bloody tragedy.
John shut his eyes against the image from his dream, of worms crawling across Sherlock's skin, the memory of thick scar tissue under his fingers. "Oh my God, Sherlock." It was all John could do to stay in his chair, to stop himself from standing, and taking Sherlock into his arms.
Violet watched the two of them closely. "The real test, as far as he's concerned, is probably what you're going to do when you find out he's lied to you. He had to expect that you would look at it as soon as you could."
He went to her, and kissed her cheek. She giggled, and touched his arm.
"The wine's good," John said, tasting it, then taking a bigger drink than he'd intended.
Back in the old days, John had always framed his ideas about Sherlock speculatively: in case Sherlock was gay, he didn't want to protest too much, didn't want to offend him. In the past six months, as he'd torn down the shoddy cardboard shack of his own identity, he'd come to accept that there was really no mystery to Sherlock's orientation. He might not be interested in a relationship. He might not have the same needs or interests John did, in being with someone on intimate terms. But of course he was gay. Of course he was.
Mark spoke to him, as if from a great distance. "Take it easy, John. We've got a long way to go."
Across the street, Bainbridge stood, completely rigid and still, his face handsome beneath the tall hat of his uniform. His letter had been more than enough to convince John that his case was worth their efforts. After Sherlock had read it, he'd agreed.
An image arose, unbidden, unwanted, of Sherlock's face, pale and miserable, as he told John that John would be happy. John wasn't sure that happiness was something he was seeking any more. Maybe some sort of equilibrium was the best he could hope for, he thought, as he continued digging.
"Calling the police." Not reading texts from his partner.
"You and me, we've got big plans to make. Worlds to conquer, yeah?" He squeezed Mark, and worked his length for everything he was worth.
Coffee cup empty, he paced, restless, and checked his messages. Nothing from Mark, or from Sherlock. One new email from Greg Lestrade.
"I was happy before, you know. With you." He took another step out through the door, into the night, and the candle on the table guttered. He was letting the winter wind into Sherlock's sanctuary. It wasn't good. It wasn't fair. None of it was.
Sherlock was still ranting, talking rapidly about how hard he'd tried, how he'd traced the case back to someone in John's clinic, but he couldn't sort out who, and the trail had grown cold.
This man, this funny man with the terrible French accent, like something out of a cartoon, looked just like Sherlock.
All at once, John understood that he'd missed a great deal. Sherlock was very pale, his skin a clammy white, circles under his eyes. Not sleeping, maybe. He looked as though he hadn't seen the sun for years. John studied the way Sherlock held himself, the way he shuffled from one foot to the other. Discomfort. John had assumed it was impatience, with him, with the conversation. Maybe it was physical. He wondered what other injuries Sherlock was hiding, under his clothes.
He sat back and looked at what he'd written. It was a horrible lie. He rebelled against it, even as he imagined Sherlock reading it. He backspaced over the last two sentences, and, riding a wave of impulse he knew he shouldn't, he typed,
In the kitchen, Mark greeted him with a wolf whistle. "Why, Doctor Watson!"
A broken watch.
There was no reply. He clarified, lamely, as if he could be referring to anything else:
John stared at her. As far as he'd understood, they'd only managed one.
John picked up the bag, and peeked inside. A gun. And not just any gun, he realised, as he slid it out into his hand: it was
There it was. Mark knew that John and Sherlock hadn't been where they were supposed to be. He had been to
"The people you've killed. I know about them." He stilled his hand.
"Over here!" Sherlock called out. "They're coming now, John. They'll sort you out."
"Is that the Taj Mahal?" John asked, squinting at the screen.
Sherlock took a deep breath, and John's phone pinged, and then Sherlock's text alert went off, too.
Sherlock stepped back, a hand on John's chest. "I—I didn't want you to die, and I don't. It's—why I left."
"You're not doing it."
Three days seemed like a long time to wait, now that John had made up his mind about leaving. He indulged in a fantasy, brief, and sweet, and wrong, of packing his things, going back to Baker Street immediately, and leaving a note of his own for Mark to find.
He watched as Mark walked into the brightly lit kitchen, plates in hand, beer bottles tucked under his arm. He was lovely, really, all bright humour and charisma and care.
"I'm so sorry, darling." Mark rubbed his back.
The one saving grace in all of it, through the first third of the month, was that their routine went back to normal, or at least, as close as it could, with Christmas coming up, and the wedding. Mark spent weekend mornings at the gym once more, and added a couple of extra racquetball games to his routine during the week. He went out to run some errands on his own. (
Two hours later:
John felt himself grow cold. "You said something about someone in the clinic."
On the far side of the dance floor, Mark was shouting encouragement at Vince, who was on his knees, shimmying his way across the floor, and sweating like an absolute madman.
The French waiter was suddenly at the table, holding out the bottle of champagne, cutting John off with an excessively loud pronouncement. "Sir, I think you’ll find this vintage—" The sentence ended with a gasp.
John was practically hyperventilating. He felt primed for a fight. He was far angrier than he had any right to be. "I already said. He told me to stay away from him."
Now that he'd taken care of the post, he stood, and fetched his coat and shoes, and found a pair of winter gloves. He'd meant what he said, about being careful, about keeping an eye out. He knew just what he would do.
"Thank you."
As he moved back into the main room of the cabin, he felt much better, much more able to focus. He ought to be used to waking himself up out of a drug haze by now. He'd done it enough times, he realised, in the weeks after Sherlock's return.
"It was impressive, I grant you." Mark's expression faltered. "I thought I'd lost you, John."
, what that would do to John. And yet he was still on the floor, still pretending he didn't know what should happen next.
"You know the fact that Mark gave this to you means it's probably useless, or a trap. Or both."
"Oh, Sherlock's not in." Mark came over to stand beside John, and put his arm around John's waist.
"It makes sense, John, that you're feeling off," Mark told him, lying on the sofa with his head in John's lap, on a rainy Sunday afternoon. "You've been through a shock. More than one. I've lost count, actually." He reached up and ran his thumb over John's lower lip. "First you deal, then you feel, right? You need time to process it all."
"I don't understand," John told him. "I don't want to sound like an egotist, but is everything about me? How could this random case from your email inbox end up being about my previous commander?"
"Exactly." A smile fluttered across Mark's lips.
John hadn't expected another apology. "You're sorry." Sherlock had said it already, more than once, at Baker Street. And John had accepted, hadn't he?
The best man.
Without another word, Violet let herself out, and closed the door behind her.
"That would never work," Sherlock was telling Violet. "John Watson is not so easily undone."
"Before I say anything else, I want you to know that despite all appearances, there is only one person in this world for me."
John frowned at that. Mark's method, up until now, as far as John could tell, had been entirely gun-based. Then again, Mark had left his gun at the clinic, and gone out on the town with the nurses.
"You've known his name all along, haven't you?"
"Wonderful fellow. Met him this morning, on a bit of a walk on the outskirts of the estate. Violet Smith was against it, of course. I had to escape from her twice. She nearly put me in handcuffs. The moment I deduced what sort of man George was, I knew he would be up for a bit of adventure. I think we're friends now. He gave me two jars of honey."
John took a step toward Sherlock, his breath sounding loud in the quiet, contained space of the carriage. Sherlock must know what bringing him down here, underground, in the dark, would do to him. He knew everything. He was Sherlock Holmes. "So what do we do?" His voice was throaty. Almost a growl.
"Why don't you go take a shower?" Mark paused to look at him, his hand on his hip. "Change into something more comfortable?"
Next, he should look for evidence, for anything Mark might have left in the flat that could be used to further implicate him. He stood, and tugged the waistband of his jumper down, and began a methodical search.
John floated, more than walked, as he made his way to the tube station, as he made his way back to the flat, to the home that wasn't home, to the place he hoped, someday soon, he would finally leave behind.
"I'm Mr. Holmes's protégé, aren't I?"
He wondered if there'd ever been a wedding that disguised secrets like the ones Mark had kept: the terrible things he'd done, the truths stored in the flash drive that was probably mere inches away, in one pocket or another of his neat, modern suit, waiting to be opened, waiting to undo him. John fidgeted under the table, his knee bouncing.
John put the phone down, and rubbed his eyes. He stared at the ceiling, and laughed, for shame and pity and everything else he was feeling. Sherlock wasn't mad about the blog post. Hadn't said anything about the comments, although John was willing to bet he'd read them all. He realised, as his blood surged and a good, hopeful feeling moved through him, that the feeling he had in this moment was pride, and an answer, finally, to the longing he'd been feeling since Sherlock returned. He wasn't shutting John out any more. He was
John frowned, scrambling to catch up. "It wasn't like that. We never—" he realised he'd been pushed into saying more than he should. "Where's this coming from?"
"I know," Mark said. "Glad you aren't completely gullible. It's going to make what happens next that much more fun."
He took it out and frowned at it, then turned and looked at the wall, jumped up on the sofa, and ran his fingers over one of the black and white photos. His hand trembled. "Selfish," he murmured.
"Where's this famous detective I've read so much about?" Bill asked, his smile goofy, his crooked teeth showing, his hair standing out in all directions. He was always a bit of a mess, but so charming it all became part of his appeal. "I was hoping to get a picture with him. The fellows in my unit would never let me off the hook if I couldn't prove I'd finally met him." To John, Bill would always look like the face of salvation itself. He'd been with him when John was shot in Afghanistan, and stayed with him, until John had been settled in hospital, and was well taken care of, and safe.
John didn't look up at him, just enjoyed the way the man was clearly flirting, invading John's personal space. He was okay with that now. Being with Mark had helped him relax about other men, and about being found attractive.
"I—" John stumbled over Mark's turn of phrase.
"Well, you did." John swiped at his eyes, feeling a thousand things all at once. It was all right, he decided, to make space for himself, to allow himself some time for it to all sink in. He looked at Mark: his anchor point, his partner. His sense of new normality. "I think we should go home. Can you give me a moment?"
Back at the flat, he walked in through the kitchen, then went to put his coat away. By the front door, two suitcases and an overnight bag sat, waiting to be put into the car. Mark, it seemed, had packed for both of them. John was mildly curious to see what was in the bags, what Mark had planned for the honeymoon John would never be going on: perhaps summer gear, swim trunks, for some warm destination; or jumpers and thick socks and winter boots, for somewhere closer to home.
"Take all that and burn it," Mark told the man, pointing at John's wedding clothes. "Nothing he brought with him can stay. Just transfer the luggage from the trunk."
A potbellied woodstove sat in the corner. Unused, judging by the temperature. Under the table were the two suitcases Mark had packed for them.
Well. Perhaps he had taken Sherlock down a notch, after all, last night. He could only imagine Sherlock's thoughts, as he recognised the scene of John's date with Mark for what it was.
He should be grateful, he supposed, for Mark's even disposition. He might be, later. He wasn't now. "He was alive. All this time, he was out there, alive. He could have gotten a message through. He could have let me know. One word. That's all I would have needed." He was rambling, trying to justify his feelings.
"You're not going to like the answer."
Reading between the lines of his files, John thought he could understand what had happened. At some point, Baccarin had fallen in with Mark, or Mark's crowd, been offered a new life.
"I suppose I'm saving myself for the wedding night."
It was from Harry.
"Getting put in a bonfire, saving London? Yeah, that's pretty good."
"No." Sherlock took a step toward him, his voice sounding anxious and loud in the hush of the room, his hand held out. "Just—let me. I'll—let me do this first. I don't want you to hurt yourself."
Mark beamed. "You really planned this."
"Here," Sherlock said, stepping in close to John, and bringing his hands out from behind his back. He held two identical boutonnières, one for each of them. "Put on your suit coat."
"And George Challenger?"
"God, I want to be kissing you right now," he said, as the laptop finally displayed its welcome screen.
Meanwhile, the mood among the nurses had shifted, a current of excitement for the upcoming wedding in everything they did. In the afternoon, Jill stopped John in the hall outside his office, to ask if he was ready, and to offer her apologies that her vacation meant she wouldn't be able to attend. Cath handed him a small paper gift bag, with a wink and a nudge, telling him it was a little something he should pack in his suitcase for the honeymoon. Heading back to his office, he opened the bag to find two pillow cases, neatly rolled, the word
Sherlock had said that he would be waiting, just him. John had never imagined that Sherlock would agree to be alone with him for the entire evening, so soon. Not after the disaster of the train carriage. Not after all the worry and concern about spending time together.
"I did! Thought I might as well, since—"
John laughed. "Thanks, Bill. You're sincerely the best."
The assailant writhed and moaned under John's knee, which he'd planted in the small of the man's back. "I'm hurt. You cut me," he complained. A blossom of blood spread across his jacket sleeve.
In the four days since the train carriage, his initial shock had settled into an empty, hollow feeling in his chest, a constant sense that the air was leaving the room. Sometimes he couldn't stop running through the details of the things Sherlock had said, the way he'd begged John to forgive him, the way he'd told John he didn't want him to die. Then John was filled with a thick, gruesome self loathing, as he understood that he'd been so carried away that he'd failed, utterly, to listen to what Sherlock was really saying.
"Ah, yes. Very nice indeed." The red of the suspenders just barely peeked out from underneath the vest. A subtle effect. Not gaudy at all, like John had imagined.
He supposed he'd failed to be careful, although he couldn't understand how. The world grew black around him, and the darkness took him down, into a dreamless place he could not escape.
"Talk to me. Why the hell didn’t you bring a gun?"
The hand spun him, and there was Mark, pulling him close.
John smiled, then felt his face crumple. Across town, probably headed for Baker Street, Sherlock Holmes was back, returned from the dead. John felt stretched across that distance, and fought the urgent need to go, find him, be with him, even as the sense of how terribly Sherlock had betrayed him sat in his belly like a hard stone.
"So, Mark said you want to be part of the wedding. Maybe stage some sort of estrangement between us. Publicly."
John stared down at the mug in his hands, and the world slowly came back into focus. He was asking a lot of Mark, a lot of their relationship, going off to Baker Street tonight, to spend time with Sherlock. Mark trusted him implicitly. He'd made that clear enough. The least John could do was extend that same courtesy.
John had an idea that he'd lost something important.
John's whole world tilted. "What question is that?"
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, they sat side by side on a white leather sofa in the planner's tastefully appointed office, waiting for her to appear. Mark flipped through a magazine, his legs crossed, his entire posture relaxed and at ease, as he always was, while John wrestled with the beginnings of a panic attack. His body was on high alert, sending up dull pangs of alarm as he studied the office's distressed white walls, and the painting of a large, single, perfectly symmetrical green carnation hanging behind the planner's desk.
Sherlock's expression was neutral, carefully composed, as he glanced down at the phone again, and raised his eyebrows. "Police?"
Mark turned on the light by John's bed. He looked worn with care, dark circles under his eyes. "Blood tests normal. They don't think you got too much exposure. Chest x-ray deemed unnecessary, unless you want one, to be certain."
"I was just telling Mark," she said, grinning, her eyes bright and sharp, "I normally think weddings are complete bollocks, but this is shaping up to be the best one ever."
"John. That's not what I meant. Just—I get it. I see what you saw in him."
"Ten times as annoying," John replied, smiling fondly. "And a hundred times as amazing."
He thought of the bloke in the park, and touched himself, his cock springing to life under his hand. His mind drifted through vague notions of eyes on him, hands on him. A deep rumble of a voice, speaking his name. He came moments later, hot streams of come joining the water from the shower as it beat down on his naked back, and flowed across his hips, over the curl of his fist.
John thought about the process he'd gone through, thanks to Mark's careful attention, of giving in to what he wanted, of clinging to the one thing that might make him happy. In the end, he'd been too tired to resist any more. He'd let go, and the world had opened up to him in a whole new way.
By nine o'clock he had pulled his bicycle out of the shed. He leaned it up against the back fence so he could clean the chain, and he thought, for the first time in a long while, about the security kit he'd installed. Carefully, he parted the vines that covered the lattice. The camera was still there.
He straightened up and stumbled onward, the ginger officer helping him along with a gentle touch to the elbow, and nonsense chatter about how the Parliamentary debate had gone forward, with no one any the wiser about the bomb. The only real disruption was the closure of Westminster Station.
"Still. Hardly seemed fair. I could have gone further. Could have named you."
"There may not be time for that now." Sherlock stared back at him over the open floorboard, eyes wide.
John squeezed Mark's hand. "But I was gone."
Three of the killings had been clustered around the time of Sherlock's return, the bodies discovered in a run of days shortly after he got back: one on November 4, the day John was put into the bonfire, and another on November 5, in the early hours of the morning, before John had let himself out of the hospital, before he and Sherlock went to Westminster Station. A third body was found the next day, November 6. Two of the bodies had turned up a little bit later, closer to the middle of the month.
A waiter loomed, as if summoned by magic. "Can I help you with anything, Sir?" French accent. Fantastic. Maybe he knew what he was doing.
All that was done now.
Sherlock was suddenly on the move. "Yes. Sit. Go ahead, John."
A thin thread of panic rose up in John. Here was a twist he could never have anticipated. He managed to keep his voice calm. "What do you mean?"
Sherlock shrugged. "Mark's red coat."
"No."
When it was all done, he went back inside, and scrubbed his nails clean of dirt at the kitchen sink. It was 10:45 a.m. He rummaged around in the fridge, pulled out a red pepper, an onion, and a few eggs, and started working on making a late breakfast.
Whatever had happened in the moments leading up to Baccarin's murder, John understood, from reading his files, that three years ago, he had taken an abrupt turn into criminality. Up until then, he'd led what appeared to be a normal life. He'd been married, no kids. The only anomaly, a gun hobby. Nothing illegal: he'd owned a licensed weapon, and held a membership at a London shooting range.
"The whole compartment is the bomb."
, a sort of profile of Sherlock, and an interview. It featured a picture of him at Westminster Station, staring down the camera like he was deducing it, hands folded, his coat collar turned up. The interview mostly consisted of statements about how pleased he was to be back in London. The final question and answer had burned John to the core.
The voices of the crowd began to lift, to cheer. John's vision grew dim, then brightened again, and he blinked, and he could see well enough to tell that the shapes surrounding him were branches, and broken pieces of wooden pallets, scrap wood.
As he put his phone away in his pocket, he was full, suddenly, of bleak suspicions about Mark. He took a deep breath, and let it out. Mark, who was out with the nurses. Was supposed to be.
Sherlock shrugged. "By all means."
"Well, he's already gone, isn't he?"
He patted her hand, his fingertips brushing lightly against her knuckles, stiff with arthritis, the paper thin skin of her hand. He could feel himself clinging to her advice, knowing it was all up to him, to do his best with an impossible situation.
"What? Well, no." He'd left them in his desk drawer at work.
And so, if John simply accepted it, when Mark finally walked him all the way home; if he smiled and made a joke about how Mark was planning to take advantage of him, when Mark invited himself in; if John allowed Mark to lean in and kiss him, as if it were perfectly fine, completely logical, as if John had always thought of men that way, well, maybe it was because he was tired of resisting, and maybe it was because he needed to prove a point to himself, and maybe he wanted to say a final
John needed this, he realised. He needed to feel wanted, needed every question he'd ever had, about how Sherlock felt, what Sherlock wanted, to be answered now, by Sherlock's need, by his hungry teeth, biting at John's lower lip, by his naked body, presented to John openly, his breathy sigh in John's ear, his hands, sliding up under the edge of John's jumper, lifting it up and over John's head.
"What?"
Sherlock nodded, then took a deep breath. "Good. Nice to see you settled, with someone normal. I mean, someone who is reliable. I'm not. Never was. Clearly. Difficult. I am, that is." Sherlock shifted in his chair, and frowned down at his hands, as if there was more to say, but he wasn't sure he should keep going.
He struggled to remember the last time he'd seen Mark so much as send a text. He seemed, lately, to be totally focused on John.
Above all, John would be patient. He would be smart about it. He would look after Sherlock, just like Sherlock deserved.
"Always," John joked, faking an affable smile.
John shut his eyes against everything he was feeling.
In the meantime, he had a day of work to deal with. He and Mark were both due to start at the clinic at nine. It was quarter to eight. He supposed Mark would go there directly, if he were still intending to maintain his cover. There was no reason he would break it, not if his goal were to follow through on his plan to marry John.
John remembered how uncertain he'd been, himself, when Mark first kissed him, and he wondered if he'd found the answer to his question, about whether Sherlock had ever done anything like this before. Perhaps not. Perhaps never. It didn't matter. None of it mattered.
To his surprise, Sherlock spoke. "I'd nearly been in contact so many times."
"Well, there he is," John said. He needed, somehow, to tell Sherlock about the flash drive, and find a moment for the two of them to get a good look at it, so they could take Mark down.
"That's right." John's throat constricted, his voice tight, but he managed to continue talking. "You died. And I thought I would, too. I didn't. Somehow, I didn't. And six months ago, there he was." He couldn't say Mark's name. For some reason he couldn't say it. "It was better with him there, and so I started something with him." He trailed off. He couldn't say more than that. He'd been as clear as he could. "So here we are."
Bill Murray had written:
, he typed, as the car turned the corner onto John's street, and pulled up outside the front gate.
"He is. Very smart. Not—"
"Oh." John studied his plate. "A place to get high."
"What about Sherlock?"
"Of course. I told you already, John. I like him. Of course the two of you are still friends. Go and see him. You should."
"In the meantime, tell me this plan of yours." Sherlock stood up on the sofa, and sat on the back of it, leaning forward, elbows on his knees, hands in prayer position at his lips, as he prepared to listen. In his black suit coat, he looked like nothing so much as a large crow.
There was nothing unusual, just the normal stuff you would expect a Londoner to accumulate: receipts from the off-licence, from the occasional lunch purchased at the places nearest work; a small pile of loose change. Mark was totally normal in his habits, completely innocuous. Funny and bright and sexy. Everything about him, calculated to appeal, to entice. To seduce.
He read the congratulations that came back through a numb haze of mild surprise. No one behaved badly about his news, even the ones who hadn't known he was with a man.
Mark was waiting for him in the front hall when John let himself in. He was wearing a black t shirt, boxer briefs, and a smile.
John's best chance of acting against Mark was going to be at the wedding. The crowd would almost guarantee that Mark would have to stick to a certain range of behaviours. His entire way of being in the world depended on not drawing attention to who he really was. His movements would be predictable. Easy to monitor.
"Yeah." Mark bit his lip, his brows raising, as a laugh sniffed out through his nose. He shook his head. "Got in front of this bloke and his girlfriend on a bike, and stopped them dead in the street. Flashed some sort of badge, police or something, and the next thing I knew, he was handing me a helmet, and the two of us were tearing off through the city, on our way to save you. He's a total nutter. Drove us down the Duke of York steps."
He took a deep breath, and let it out again, and willed himself to focus.
She let go of John's hand, and took a step back toward the door. The faint sound of voices raised in song, and the thump of the bass, came filtering down the hallway.
The DJ, who had started to set up in the corner by the kitchen door, got on his microphone to announce that the staff wanted to clear the tables away for the dance, and that everyone was invited to go out into the lobby for drinks, and another round of dessert. Sherlock stood abruptly, and walked away from the table, not speaking to anyone as he moved to the back of the hall, in the direction of the loos.
Across the street, a group of young women arranged themselves around Bainbridge. One of them stepped out in front of the group, and took some pictures. Bainbridge stood as still as he was supposed to. The whole thing seemed like an exercise in masochism, but then again, that was the army, John thought, remembering his own training fondly.
John tried to picture Mike and Greg Lestrade spending time in the same room with Harry. He wondered how they would fare: even sober, his sister could be a bit of a fire starter. Throw in a down-and-out clone of himself, and it all started to sound a bit surreal. "Are you sure it's safe?"
"Yeah. Yes. Thank you for coming."
Sherlock stared at him like a wary animal. "I saw you, you know. In the Landmark. Before you knew I was there. You were happy. You'll be happy."
John stopped in the act of putting his coat on, watching Sherlock carefully, as the last vestige of hope, that somehow Sherlock had seen what was going on with Mark, that somehow he knew, died a quiet death. For his part, Sherlock paced, and sent another text, then another.
A pair of ancient yews stood at the far end of the yard, against the stone wall that separated the burial ground from the neighbouring houses. The place was isolated, private in the way that forgotten spaces were. At night, it would be completely quiet. One could speak, here, and not be overheard. And yet, the neighbours had reported hearing an argument, men shouting.
"The two of us." Sherlock kissed the side of John's neck, and pulled himself closer against John's side, his arm tightening around John's waist. He sighed heavily, releasing, John hoped, a measure of his burden, of the care and worry he always held.
John expanded the picture until he could see a figure of a bearded man. He remembered, dimly, seeing this same photograph on Sherlock's crime wall, the day after the bonfire.
He put his hands on his knees and hunched over, stomach lurching as he fought a wave of nausea, and the sharp pinch of regret for everything he'd done, for how completely he'd allowed himself to trust, without question, the small, ordinary life he'd imagined he would lead.
John dropped below the surface of the world then, the things going on around him reaching him through a heavy, dark filter: Mark's arm looped under his, and John doing his best to lean away from Mark, and then another arm around him, and it was Harry, helping to pick him up, and Bill Murray nearby, saying, "Ah, bastard's had a bit too much, no worries. If you can't tie one on at your own wedding, when can you?"
. He was talking about the train carriage. The things John had said. The claims he'd made.
"Come here, you."
William's face flushed a bit, and he smiled, grin crooked. "Oh." He didn't seem put off at all. Quite the opposite. "Trouble with your boyfriend?"
? What about the others?"
On December 4th, a Wednesday, Anika sent John an email, a forwarded message from Sherlock.
"I'm rubbish at this stuff. I find it—I find it difficult."
"Okay." There was too much going on for John to sort through. He looked down at his phone, not knowing what he should do next, settling on sending a reply to Harry.
"What, hanging out a shingle? Probably illegal solutions for intractable problems?"
"Just nice? You chose this. I was kind of hoping you'd be happy with it. I am." He allowed himself a smile.
John still hadn't grown used to the height difference between them. It was easy to press his face to the skin exposed by the open collar of Sherlock's shirt, to feel the warmth of his chest, and inhale the scent of his soap, as Sherlock held him, and murmured nonsense.
"Sounds like a bit of a weird night," Mark said. "Just you and Sherlock."
"Still maintaining the mystery, then?" John tried not to shudder as Mark came to him, and put his arm around John's shoulders.
With a sudden jolt of clarity, of inspiration, he knew exactly what he wanted to do with his evening. He wrote:
Sherlock spooned some rice onto his plate, and looked around. "One of my boltholes."
He was hysterical, all of a sudden, feeling the full force of how stupid he'd been. He was a dupe, a fool. He could feel himself grinning, his anger hideous, surely completely obvious, surely filling the room. He wasn't sure how he would stop himself from hurling the full force of every accusation he had at Mark.
"Enjoy the trip, John."
John's stomach flipped, as he remembered the keystroke monitoring software. He had no idea—despite everything, he
John grew very still. "What man?"
It was time to put a name on Sherlock's place in his life. Something he could be comfortable with. "You're my best friend. Of course you should be there. If you want to, that is."
"Is dead, yes. He was—well, he was a junkie. Lestrade was supposed to be watching him, but he said he was going to the loo, and slipped out instead." Sherlock blinked at the candle on the table, then shook his head, as if to clear it. "At least I have access to the scene of his death. A real chance at making some progress."
He wondered if Mycroft would be there, and just like that, he was back in the memory of his and Sherlock's first case, the first night, and the moment he'd realised that Sherlock and Mycroft were brothers.
John filled his water glass and drank deeply, thinking about how jealous he'd been, when Mark told him that he and Sherlock exchanged texts frequently. Sherlock had been checking up on John then, as well. Wanting to include Mark in their dynamic, perhaps. Wanting to make sure he wasn't standing in the way, wasn't ruining things for John's relationship.
He stood in the bathroom, looking at his reflection in the mirror, and recalled Sherlock's face, the defeated look he'd worn as he wiped the drawn-on moustache from his upper lip. He sighed, fished around in a drawer, and pulled out a pair of barber's scissors.
"Have I?"
He was standing, mouth open, wondering if Sherlock had maybe, just maybe, given him the most romantic gift he'd ever received, as Arthur Davies helped John into the suit coat, and watched, as John did up the buttons.
"Never mind all that," Mark said. "What did you want to ask me?"
"Indeed, John."
He spread a black garbage bag out on the ground, pinning it down on one side with the legs of the plastic chair, so the wind wouldn't blow it away, then focused on digging a shallow hole in the dirt, just big enough to hold the tablet and the battery pack. As he worked, he placed the dirt carefully onto the garbage bag.
Asking for confirmation, then. Reassurance, John supposed. He would give it. He would give anything, to have Sherlock trust him again. "Best friend. Of course you are."
Now that John was thinking about it, it seemed like a terribly obvious gap in everything they'd built, a tell that gave the whole game away. And yet, he'd been willing to overlook it, to marry Mark, to build a life for himself that would never fit. He supposed that the problems with their relationship had hidden in plain sight, obscured by the fact that Mark had been so patient, in the beginning, and John had been so willing to accept his attention, take whatever he was offering. He'd never considered that maybe it was all a bit strange.
Sherlock looked up at him. "If I kiss you now, I'm afraid I won't be able to stop."
Cath stood there, leaning against the frame, still lovely in her lilac gown, a bit flushed from dancing, her high heeled shoes clutched in her right hand. "What are you two doing looking at my vacation snaps?"
, and a promise to check on the state of their dinners, the man shuffled off.
John smiled, and he felt everything for Sherlock, love and care and understanding. "No. I know it would be torture for you, Sherlock. I'm not putting you through that."
Vince stuck his hand out and introduced himself to Harry. Harry elbowed John, then laughed at something Vince said, and suddenly she was the centre of attention, as Bill joined the conversation, and John rubbed at his forehead, and wondered how in the hell he was going to figure out a way to do what he so desperately needed.
He'd done what he had to do. Things had reached their final configuration. He could relax about it now. Sink into his new life, like he'd planned.
John flipped through images of early evening commuters, trying to look for patterns, for the same person walking past the flat more than once, anything.
Mark blinked, and sobered, and removed his hand. "Okay. All right." He sounded just as vulnerable as John had ever imagined him to be. As human, as much like a man in love. And yet, the lies he'd told. The things he'd done.
." Sherlock rose up on his knees, and pulled John down to meet him. He paused, and John closed his eyes, feeling Sherlock's breath warm against his lips, his hand on the back of his neck, before Sherlock closed the gap, a breathy
"He's a nurse," Sherlock said. He stared into the empty fireplace, contemplating the soot, as if it held answers he couldn't fathom for himself.
"Had to start somewhere, I suppose. There was a time when Moriarty was the only game in town. The only one worth playing, anyway."
John knew which part was coming next—the declarations. He was glad, in retrospect, that he'd talked with Sherlock, and with Harry. He could easily imagine an alternative scenario in which either one of them might have tried to stop him from marrying Mark, to disastrous results.
Mark raised his eyebrows. "Sherlock Holmes is not the only clever man in your life, you know. It's a skip code. See? Read every third word. 'Save John Watson.'"
—died on his lips, and he waited, besotted, needing only to be with Sherlock again, and so grateful to hear his voice.
John and Mark took their lunch together, sitting among a gathering of nurses, who laughed and joked as they talked about how Christmas had gone. John's thoughts wandered perpetually between the man sitting beside him, who seemed to fit so seamlessly into John's life, into the life of the clinic, into their shared home, but who harboured the dirtiest of secrets. He wondered how Mark had come by his nurse's training. How much of it was real. He was so adept at negotiating the most nuanced intimate interactions. John believed he was capable of faking his way through just about anything.
"What?" John's stomach flipped, hope rising in him again, despite Sherlock's erratic behaviour. Because of it.
"Okay. Still, I'm meant to be in the loos for how long?"
Mark's advice of a few days previous came back to him:
He typed a response to Mark now:
Sherlock turned sharply, went over to the window, and stared out through it. Petulant. Or, maybe just embarrassed, like any son of excitable parents.
John slumped in his chair. He wanted, desperately, to tell Sherlock everything. This was ridiculous. The both of them were utterly ridiculous. An urgent sense that he wanted to do everything immediately, without hesitation, burned through him.
John threw back his head and laughed.
He stumbled, trying to fight, panic gripping him as his muscles grew loose and uncooperative. There were two strange men, then, holding him, guiding him down as he fell onto the pavement. His vision blurred.
After about forty-five minutes, they drove over Kew Bridge. The driver turned in toward Kew Gardens, where a security guard stood outside an open service gate, waiting for them, apparently. He waved them through, even though the gardens had long since closed for the day.
Still close to home, then. Definitely worth looking into.
John took a deep breath, and straightened out his suit coat, ready to face whatever came next.
"Right."
Mark squirmed against John a little, putting one hand around John's waist, the other on his shoulder. The two of them were locked together. Before John's eyes, the drunk act evaporated, high alert coming into Mark's features, his eyes sharpening. Good. They weren't playing on that level any more.
"They didn't hurt me, though. You found me."
John's mind fluttered, briefly, over the idea of a far future, in which he and Sherlock might consider retiring to a village like the one George lived in. "Thanks," he said. "Drink? It's, uh, on us."
Mark lifted an eyebrow, his mouth shaping itself into his standard cheeky grin, his good humour rising to the surface, like it always did. "You'd better be. You're mine. If anyone's going to do anything to you, it should be me."
John didn't have to ask who Little Miss Secret Weapon was. Harry was busy jumping and hooting, while a couple of the nurses took turns holding her hand and dancing with her.
Mark laughed. "Well, I'm pretty good with a skip code or two, as it turns out."
Sherlock was standing about fifteen feet away, by the doors of the reception hall, looking sombre, while Cath stood next to him, chattering at him. He looked up at the ceiling, and said a few words, his expression bland. She threw her head back and laughed.
He'd never talked about how he really felt about Sherlock, about the nights he'd lain awake in Baker Street, staring up at the ceiling, and wondering what might happen if he just kissed Sherlock, if he could somehow coax him into talking about his feelings. Some things were private. Some things were pointless. Water under the bridge.
Sunday morning, John slept in, and woke to a quiet flat, Mark gone out for his second major workout of the weekend. John rolled over in bed, and stared at the ceiling, basking in the sunlight filtering through the sheer curtains. He closed his eyes, and drifted back to sleep, the solitary room enclosing him like a warm blanket.
There were more, along similar lines, from people he mostly knew, including one from Mark, time stamped 11:02 pm. He must have read the post last night, right after John had published it.
"Collecting a stalker somehow viewed as a sign of weakness," Sherlock said. "Strange."
Mark laughed, and ran his tongue over the tips of his front teeth. "And there you are. There's the John Watson I've been waiting for all this time."
"Won't be a bit obvious? Me leaving at the same time as Sherlock?"
"Honestly, John, I'd have to have my head in the sand not to know."
John shook his head. "They're people Sherlock knows. They've never been my friends."
Drinks after work became a weekly thing, and then a daily ritual. It wasn't long before drinks turned into dinner, and dinner turned into entire evenings spent lingering over food, until the restaurant closed, then walking slowly through late night streets, going nowhere in particular, while Mark talked about nothing at all: the people at work, where he'd gone to school, his decision to become a nurse.
He couldn't say that he was ready to see Sherlock quite yet. He hadn't managed to see a way to forgive him for pretending to be dead for two years.
The waiter leaned in, a little too close, the scent of his cologne washing over John. Something familiar. For no reason he could explain, he felt a sudden jolt of alarm. Nervous system, never quite right, after the war. After Sherlock.
"Oh wait: your mission, should you choose to accept it." He grinned. "Always wanted to say that."
He was still watching John, waiting, for whatever he was going to say next.
Despite the distance from London, more visitors came: Greg and Molly stopped in, and asked after the details of the case. Molly shook John's hand, and offered him a shy smile, and an apology for thinking he was terrible, which made John bark with laughter. Bill Murray dropped by, and let John know he was shipping out again, but that word had circulated that he'd been at the infamous
"It's empty," John said. "There's nothing."
Sherlock came into the reception hall, sat at a table in the corner, and fiddled with a straw, turning it this way and that, while staring into the middle distance. One of the nurse's husbands approached him at one point, and ran off blushing, after Sherlock said what appeared to be five words to him.
"Funny. No, you're going to Baker Street." Mark tapped out a message on his phone, and sent it.
"I'm gay."
John sat up, and turned on the lamp on his bedside table. Mark squinted against the light, watching John steadily.
Outside, George made his way back across the field. John watched him go, trying to sort through the possible meaning of his behaviour, his small gestures. Curious, the thing he'd done with his hands, the paper sack he'd placed in the last of the hives.
John shifted in his seat, and licked his lips. Mark had worn his blue suit, pale lavender shirt, purple tie. Brushed his hair carefully, a bit of product to style it. His hair was pale, baby fine. John wondered if it would thin as Mark aged, recede a bit. He imagined them both as balding old men, bickering over what to do with their afternoon, retired, maybe, somewhere in the country.
He was standing on a knife point, all too aware that he couldn't afford a fall. He ran through the facts as he knew them again: he was Mark's assignment. The fact that he was still alive, despite Sherlock's return, meant that he had some value, some importance to Mark, personally or professionally. Mark had made overtures to him, had been making them for a while, suggesting that John might be better suited to a darker line of work, while revealing who he was to John, one vicious piece at a time.
John swiped at his eyes, and sniffed, and tried to pull away, but Sherlock held him, and ran his fingers through John's hair, and sighed against the top of his head.
"Oh my God. No." John squeezed Sherlock's hands.
"Oh my God."
Mark's grin was lopsided. "Don't you think it might be, I don't know, more exciting than all this?"
John smiled down at the phone, imagining Sherlock's voice, saying those words. He'd always been critical of the blog, before. Things really had changed.
"I wasn't sure I would come back," Sherlock mumbled. He studied his hands. A pink scar ran across the back of one of them. John caught a glimpse of a band of red, raw, irritated skin just above the wrist. Sherlock tugged his sleeve down, covering it.
"Sumatra Road Station. They built the platforms, even the staircases, but it all got tied up in legal disputes, so they never built the structure on the surface."
Sherlock cleared his throat. "I'm beginning to realise some apology is probably in order. John, I am—I am sorry."
The waiter's breath brushed across John's cheek. Warm. Inviting. John nodded. He wouldn't make eye contact. That would be too much. Jesus. "Okay."
His breath loud and ragged in his ears, John crouched, and ran for the bee boxes. He paused as he reached the one George had knocked on three times. Carefully, he lifted the lid, keeping an eye on the woods, and being careful not to disturb the bees. He lifted the top frame, and found the paper bag, just as George had left it. The clustered bees circulated slowly, exploring the edges of the paper.
He hit
He needed to be free, he realised, more desperately now. Sherlock was waiting for him. He didn't know it, but their lives, their entire future happiness, depended on what John was going to do next, and how it went.
Mark had certainly made a strange choice, leaving at this moment, with no prior warning, no hint that he was planning a trip. It was definitely odd, that he hadn't even waited until John came back from his ride, to tell him he was going.
Following blind instinct, and full of that helpless feeling that came between dropping a plate and watching it smash to pieces on the floor, John opened the conversation with Sherlock, and read through it until he found what he was looking for. The body discovered on November 5
Mark was still watching them. John gave a nod to the bartender, who poured another couple of shots from a bottle of something clear. Harry handed one to John, spilling a little, and leaned in. "It's water." She raised the other shot glass, and clinked it against John's, then tossed hers back. "Come on, Johnny! It's your wedding day!"
He smiled, trying to force his gratitude through the fog of his desire for Sherlock. "Thank you."
"I texted you, and I didn't hear back, and that was when I started to worry, a bit." His voice grew quieter, more strained. He shifted in his chair, and looked toward the doorway of the room, as if trying to figure out what he should say.
He could imagine, before it had fallen into disrepair, that the place had once, perhaps, been a charming retreat, or at least a convenient one.
tucked into his bike bag.
When the camera was firmly in place, he stood back, admiring his work. No one would be able to tell that it was there.
"I didn't think I should."
"Yeah. Yes." John chewed his lower lip. "Everything all right?"
There was no refrigerator, but the cupboard yielded a box of digestive biscuits and, miraculously, a couple of bananas. He ate the fruit, going as slowly as he could, then washed down a few of the biscuits with as much water as he thought he could drink without being sick. When he was finished, he sighed. His head began to clear.
"Oh yeah. Everyone's going to be knackered today. We started out at the pub, then ended up back at Jill's. Hilarious, that lot, when they get going. Nobody wanted to stop. You would like them, you know, if you took the trouble to get to know them."
Work, for once, was fantastic. His patients all had simple issues: nothing out of the ordinary, nothing serious. He got through them efficiently, and had enough time to take a couple of Dr. Chakraborty's—a return favour for the many times she'd helped him, when he was overloaded.
Then Mark was on the move, closing the space between himself and Sherlock, taking Sherlock's sleeve, tugging him over to the table, while he hissed in his ear. "You. Do you know what you've done? How you've hurt this man?"
The clerk was a younger man, tall and lanky, with thick waves of auburn hair brushed back from his forehead. The name on his tag was
John pressed his lips together, feeling that the upper one was strangely bare. "Is there coffee?"
Mark didn't bring up the cabbie again, but John couldn't forget that he had done it.
"You got this at 6:10 pm." Just after John had left the clinic.
"Sorry, what are you doing?"
He shifted again, crossed his legs. Uncrossed them. "It isn't that, exactly."
This really was the best time, the best moment for him and Sherlock to talk. Mark, occupied with dressing himself, and forced to wait on his own side of the church before the ceremony, wouldn't even know they'd had a moment together. John had gone over what he wanted to say, and what he needed to say, to Sherlock, so many times in the last few hours, he was certain he could fill an entire day, a week, with it. He checked the time on his phone: twenty minutes to go before the ceremony. It would have to be enough.
Mark pressed against him, hands on John's shoulders. "Mm," he said, a low growl. "You planning to seduce me, Doctor Watson? Because the answer is yes."
John closed his eyes against the way everything seemed to spin, as Gabriel turned a corner—still a bit drunk, then. He tried to will himself into sobriety. In less than an hour, he would be back at the flat, facing Mark, and the truth of whatever had really happened to his double in the alley behind
This neglected place, with its weeds and overgrown trees, was a part of the London battlefield, the site of a major win for John's enemy. Thomas Baccarin had died in this churchyard. Mark had shot him here, while John slept in the hospital, after bonfire night.
John's chest squeezed, and he let go of Sherlock, covering his mouth with both of his hands to stop the sound coming out of him. It came nevertheless: a strangled cry, containing all his mourning, every crawling, grasping, cloying day of the last two years, in one mangled non-word.
He erased those sentences, his heart pounding, regretting typing them instantly, trapped between his own, private truth, and all the resolutions he'd made, to deal with the consequences of his life and choices, one at a time.
"John?"
"I'll just go fetch the coat," Arthur Davies said. He patted John on the shoulder, then returned to the table by the windows, moving slowly, deliberately.
"So if you weren't aware of that Tuesday eleven o'clock pattern, this would help you establish that it's happening."
It wasn't the question he most wanted answered.
John read on, heart clenching. The comments after Sherlock's got nastier, and more ridiculous, and absolutely, gut wrenchingly, in line with everything John had been feeling lately.
, as the papers were calling it, and that fact was already doing wonders for his reputation among the lads.
The fully formed sentence rose unbidden, a blooming, all in a rush, of all the things he'd never gotten to say. Hadn't said yet.
John looked up and down street, at the people passing them by. His left fist clenched painfully. "What?"
From Greg Lestrade:
They said their goodnights, and John listened to Mark's footsteps retreating down the hallway, as he stared out through the darkened window, and wondered how safe he was, in this room, in this bed. He wondered how safe he and Sherlock both were, in the world, now that Sherlock was back. He could feel his body shifting, his nervous system slipping into the calm steadiness he'd always felt, when he was with Sherlock, and danger sang its high lilting tune, through all his days at Baker Street.
As he went out through the back door, and headed into the shed to fetch the shovel, he gently cursed himself for letting his home monitoring project slide. He'd been feeling so unwell, had been so focused on his personal life, he'd lost track of the war that raged all around him and Sherlock. He'd discounted the idea that he was involved with it. He'd forgotten who he was.
"What are you saying?"
Sherlock had a right to know. He had a right to ask, and John wanted to tell him.
. We all loved it. Not as good as the book, mind."
He knew the voice well. Those words had been his father's favourite retort, whenever John had threatened to call the police, to tell someone, in response to the latest round of yelling or physical abuse.
Mark was watching him. "After the wedding. There's a lot to explain, John. The raw data isn't going to get you as far as you think. You'll need context, and some training."
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm not—I don't, any more. Serbian prison, as it turns out, wonderful detox opportunity." He smiled, and laughed, shyly, at his own attempt at a joke.
John allowed himself a laugh. "You know my side of the church. Full of drama."
"I thought so," Violet said. She pushed Sherlock aside, and took John's hands, examining them, pushing up his sleeves, and checking his wrists.
"I've got nothing to lose," Mark told him, kissing his neck in the kitchen one morning. "Everyone already knows I'm positively flaming, and snagging a doctor, well, that's the dream, isn't it?"
"I've thought long and hard about what I want to say to you. These are prepared words, Mark. I've chosen these words with care."
It really would be best, he decided, if no one else knew about the setup, as he used the shovel to pry up the edge of one of the flagstones, and set it aside, watching a few distressed woodlice scuttle around in the sudden light.
His nightmares shifted. He traded his dreams about his old life with Sherlock for vague, disturbing encounters in which Sherlock transformed into a shaky ghost and hovered in the corner of the room, face pale and streaked with tears, watching John sadly. On two occasions he'd woken in a panic, after vivid night terrors, in which he was tied to a chair, while a light shone in his face, and a man whose voice he felt he should recognise interrogated him, asking question after question he couldn't answer. He'd jolted out of those dreams in a blind panic, covered in sweat, reaching for Mark, who held him while he sobbed and shook in their shared bed.
"So?"
John opened his phone, and looked through the records of the murders once more. The first body had been discovered November 4
Mark's mouth curved into a smile. "Tom's gone, actually."
"Have you seen Sherlock?" he asked, keeping his voice low.
"No." John said. "I didn't know what I wanted, or at least, I didn't think I could have it. How could I know what he was thinking?"
Sherlock sat up, as if he were ready to rise to his feet. Another long silence. When he spoke, his voice was deep, and strained. "And how did you know, later? That you did deserve it?" He added a quiet, defeated coda: "With Mark, I mean."
John reached out, and took it. A simple act, nothing out of the ordinary, except it wasn't every day he got to do it with a two year old corpse, suddenly sprung to full, warm life again. He looked up, first at the long expanse of Sherlock's throat as he tugged his bow tie loose, gasping as if it were choking him. Sherlock never wore ties. A fact.
Mark had gone out, in the middle of the night. John couldn't understand why he hadn't woken up. He usually did, when Mark so much as rolled over in his sleep.
He was careful. He always tried to be careful, but Mark was so open, and his face was flushed with pleasure, as he keened, and his head tilted back, and he said, "Fuck me, you furious whore," which made John laugh.
Sherlock had said he was texting the press, back in Baker Street, and John had taken it on faith that he was telling the truth, but that wasn't all of it.
Mark took a step forward, gun raised, aimed at Sherlock.
John nodded, and took a deep breath, and his head cleared a little. "Drugged me. I don't know how. I watched everything I ate and drank." He looked up at Sherlock, as Violet ran her fingers over John's neck, and behind his ears.
"Have you been busy?" John asked.
Wiggins closed the car door for him, as the driver turned to greet him. "Good evening, Sir." When the driver smiled, he showed yellowed teeth. One of his incisors was missing. "I'm Gabriel. I'll have you at your destination in a little less than an hour."
A long, excruciating wait followed, accompanied by a sliver of light from under the bathroom door. The sounds of Mark brushing his teeth. The flush of the toilet. And the shower running, then stopping. Mark's contented sigh. John could picture him rubbing his hair dry with a towel, scrubbing his skin until it was bright red.
. Just
John had nodded, and agreed, although the real trouble was, he wasn't feeling much at all. He was stuck in a dull torpor that made it hard to concentrate. He wondered what had happened to the bright determination he'd felt on the day he'd hidden the cameras.
"Not funny, I know." Sherlock pushed rice across his plate with his fork. "Anyway, need to stay alert right now. Still haven't sorted out the current threat to you."
"Yeah?" John retreated further into banter. It was easier than facing the implications of the discussion. "What are you going to do about it?"
, as he'd put it in his comment on the blog. He was still looking to uphold that story. If John did anything to call it into question, anything involving Sherlock, he would surely put a target on his own back.
Phrased as if it were a choice. "You weren't sure you would be able to. Come back."
He opened the cottage door. The air outside was cold and damp, the sky heavy, threatening rain. John blinked in the dull light, his eyes adjusting painfully, as his breath ghosted out in front of him. He did up the zip on the hoodie he'd put on. All he had to do was go down the steps, and around the corner of the cottage, to where the beekeeper was doing his work, to see if the man would talk to him, to see if he could get help.
Bonfire night.
"Remember what I told you," Mark said, as he walked away, heading back toward the party.  "We're going to have to talk about those files, so I'm trusting you not to peek until the honeymoon."
he'd given Sherlock for Christmas.
John's heart swelled, as he fought an inner war with himself. He turned and looked at Sherlock, who was frowning at him, as if waiting for some sign that John would find fault with what he'd done. As if he could. In the end, feeling the full force of all of his own resistance to the wedding, to his relationship with Mark, and to the entire direction his life was taking, John tapped the note about the best man speech with his knuckle.
"Hi, yeah. I’m looking for a bottle of champagne—a good one."
"Stand up."
Instead, he looked down at the mug of tea that Sherlock held in his hand. "How was that?"
Dinner had been an exercise in pretending to listen to what people were saying, as he watched his own plate and glass, never taking his eye off them, making sure that Mark didn't manage to slip anything into his food or drink. He knew from hard experience how easy it would be for Mark to dose him with something, to make him compliant, or sick, or worse. They'd both mostly refrained from drinking, one glass of wine each with dinner, and one glass of champagne for a single, brief toast. Spread out over the hour and a half dinner had taken, the alcohol hadn't even begun to reduce John's nerves. He was ready to fight. Ready for everything to be over.
