"Don't tell me you two had a lovers quarrel? And after such a passionate display on the lake?" Mycroft had appeared at his side, pouncing on his bad mood to make it worse. He was good at doing that.
Sherlock later brought this up to John. They had found their way back to 221B. Mrs. Hudson was at John’s house babysitting. John had needed time alone with Sherlock after everything that happened with Eurus Holmes.
Sherlock sat on the couch and prepared to explain. "My family," he said. "They will not stop harassing me about finding a suitable romantic partner. My parents and my brother are forcing me on a vacation with them, to one of our summer homes on a lake in America. I wanted them to stop pestering me, distracting me from cases, so I told them I have a partner."
John kisses him and this time it's clearly much more than a friendly kiss. There's a heat to it that makes Sherlock moan against John's lips.
John knows her habit comes from her own time spent in war-torn Israel and likes her all the more for it. He heads up to the ER and drags Murray out for a bite, luckily its a slower day and he can pull his friend from the fray with minimal grumbling.
Mycroft resists the urge to sigh, so much for this so-called ‘secretive’ organization. “Morning,” Mycroft greets politely, though he can’t be bothered to add the ‘good’.
“Our aliens of course, landed here in the sixties,” Major Barrymore grins, an expression that is really just a baring of teeth.
“I am sorry that the trip did not produce the information you were looking for. May your search be fruitful, la.” She gives a small wave to both of them, before turning and leaving, cutting a swath through the tourists that had gathered during the chat. Surprisingly, they don’t move any closer to the statue, as if John and Mycroft have an area of protection around them.
John holds up his arm, wrist clearly free of the printed cast he’d gotten at Baskerville. “Finally, yeah. Eight weeks in the damn thing, even though I could take a shower without issue and scratch an itch, it was still a pain.”
They walk back to 221B hand in hand. John can’t help but feel a little self-conscious about the hand-holding, they are grown men not teenagers. He always hated holding hands with his girlfriends in the past, couldn’t stand having a hand trapped. With Sherlock though, their bondmarks press together and it sends a comforting warmth up his arm and through his body.
“Looks like,” John conceded, thinking about his wounded shoulder and his discharge. Even if he hadn’t been discharged do to the wound, a level 5 bond would have got him kicked out right away. Even if Sherlock had wanted to join with him, they would never let such a pair into the Army.
Sherlock found Sebastian Moran settled in his chair, with his Strad nestled in his arms. He was holding it carefully, obviously aware of the instruments age and value. He was plucking at the strings, a tune Sherlock did not recognize, but one that showed some knowledge of playing.
Sherlock flung open the door to the flat, strutting like a peacock. He knew John would love Baker Street, the eclectic furniture and older décor suited his tastes, and he knew soldier-doctor John would have little care about the body parts in the fridge or the eyeballs in the microwave.
“Oh ‘Impressionists’ I should have known that,” Carol scowled. She shot a look at the dark shadow hiding in the bushes a few feet away, “I’m aware of your… toughness, but I’m also aware of your attraction to danger.”
There are three men on the other side of the room, all dressed in ridiculous yellow leotards. Magically, they are all of average strength, but Lestrade is worried about the weapons, two with swords and the one with spears.
“It is not fine,” Lestrade growls. “The trains won’t be running that way this late. What were you planning on doing? Taking a cab all the way to Cornwall or sleeping rough for the night?”
He gives a pleased rumble, leaning back. His claws retract, paws slipping back into the sea. John knows he is preparing to leave, and cannot help but ask, “That’s it then? You want us to just scurry on home and forget about this creature?”
Irene was perched somewhere in the back of the room, while John kept close at his side. He made sure to stay out of the way, but his presence was an obvious guard against any that dare to threaten Sherlock again.
For some reason I have a habit of switching between past and present tense even within the same sentence. I have no idea why, so if you spot some weird subject/verb agreement I apologize. I tried to catch them all.
“I didn’t open it,” the man runs his hand through his already messy black hair. He’s pale enough to be practically translucent his veins running like blue marks beneath his skin.
Sherlock sniffs out the entrance to the research lab with his usual bloodhound precision. Of course, Greg is sure that even he could have found the door labeled ‘Research Lab’.
John licks his lips, his stomach announcing itself with a large grumble. “This is awesome,” he grins.
Lestrade huffs, but winces when the creature slams into the web, the shield giving a horrible whine. “My weapon is just fine thank you, cast the spell.”
Mycroft watches her movements and copies them. Normally trying new spells like that without practice is dangerous, but he knows Mycroft won’t miss a step. John forms the more familiar gestures for the spell.
“Ta,” John sits at the table. “Wait, shouldn’t you two be in school?” John furrows his brow, looking between his sister and her bondmate.
John opens his mouth to argue, but suddenly he can’t breath. Pain shoots through him, lungs constricting. He gasps, clawing at his chest.
“Yes, good idea” James grabs John around the shoulder and pulls him to his side. John’s in too much pain to protest, but he does have enough control to pull his wings in.
“Woohoo,” Mrs. Hudson calls, and John hears the door open. “Oh sorry dears,” she flushes as they pull apart.
He smiled at his…bond mate. He couldn’t believe at thirty-four years old he was just meeting the man. The fact that his mate was a man at all was a little startling. John had never found himself attracted to a man, but he thought Sherlock certainly had a body to be admired.
"A theory would require more information first otherwise it would just be a wild guess," the detective  pointed out.
"Look closer," Sherlock instructed. He zoomed in on an image of Irene passionately embracing a half naked man. "She's wearing the ring I gave her."
Sherlock couldn't just stay at the cabin all alone while John was visiting Mary. It would look suspicious since they were supposed to be a couple in love an therefore spending time together. Besides, Sherlock didn't really want to deal with his family alone. That was the whole reason he had brought John along on this stupid vacation, wasn't it?
Sherlock moved his attention back to John’s nipples, sucking gently on one and flicking his tongue over it.
John raised his fist like he was going to hit him. Sherlock winced. John reconsidered and instead grabbed a hold of Sherlock’s curls, tugging on his hair roughly.
John tries to choose his next words carefully. He's never been in a situation like this before. Normal people didn't start considering suicide just because they were bored, but then again Sherlock was never a normal person.
He trusted that John was fully capable of taking care of himself wherever he may be. He had seen John repeatedly handle himself extremely well around his family so there was no real need to worry. He took a long shower, giving himself time to think in peace. Once he was dressed for the day, he grabbed a bagel and went in search of John.
Sherlock reluctantly joined John and his parents outside by a camp fire. The night sky above them was clear and filled with bright stars.
"So then they'll solve it quickly. Besides, what else are you doing with your time that's so important? Would you rather stay here shopping all day?"
John wrote down the basics. His name was Breydan Thomas. His age  was 18. The girl, Brianna, attended high school with him and started dating him shortly before they graduated this summer.
Except it didn’t feel like a mistake. It didn’t feel bad. He was being selfish but he didn’t care because it felt so good to finally be kissing John.
Lestrade came through for them and they were soon sitting on a floral couch in a living room that looked like it hadn't been redecorated since the 1950's. or maybe the owner, a miss Eliza May, was into retro style. Based on her worn bellbottom jeans that was probably a true indicator of her style. She was best friends with the victim in the woods and they were there to ask her some questions.
Sherlock remained unconvinced."He's never run away before?" He asked. "Did you have an argument or observe him in a bad mood before he disappeared? Nothing out of the ordinary?"
Theories were running wild in Sherlock's head. He and John took dinner to their bedroom to discuss the case, much to his mother's dismay.
Sherlock was so very sexy and he didn't even realize it. John was loving all the soft breathless sounds he was producing. He loved knowing that it was him causing Sherlock such pleasure, pleasure that no one else had ever given him.
Sherlock is clearly taken aback by this statement as he considers what John might be trying to tell him.
Sherlock points to a drawer and John reaches into it to retrieve some lube. John doesn’t question it. He’s wanted this for so long. He’s thought of this moment a million times. He can’t remember the last time he was this turned on, this eager to be inside someone. The truth is, he and Sherlock are both just as desperate for each other.
John was currently laying on his stomach, face buried in a pillow. He looked peaceful and warm. sunlight bathed the room and Sherlock was grateful for the air conditioning.
John thought for a moment then said "You're not that bad. Honestly, spending time with you has probably been the most fun I've had in a very long time."
John roasted his marshmallow over the fire until it was golden brown, before sticking it between two Graham cracker pieces along with some chocolate. Sherlock was too impatient, choosing instead to burn his own marshmallow, lighting it on fire like a torch and blowing it out. This seemed to amuse John who pretended to find it appalling but couldn't keep from laughing. Sherlock was surrounded by the sounds of crickets chirping and the fire crackling and John's laughter. Maybe it wasn't such a bad way to spend an evening after all.
"The police caught that killer, the Hunter. A young woman he attacked last night escaped and lead the police right to him. He was found dead in his home. He shot himself."
He got on his hands and knees over John, kissing him all over, tracing his muscles and the various battle scars with his fingertips. He pinched one of John’s nipples lightly and John groaned.
The two men discussed a few theories about the murderer on the way back to the cabin, sure to check that no crime bloggers were lurking nearby. Sherlock was silent as they ate dinner, glaring at Mycroft across the table. John carried the conversation cheerfully, careful to keep the topics neutral.
‘I’m not having sex with that girl,’ John thought to himself. ‘I don’t even like her. I’m not having sex with anyone at all lately.’ But this didn’t seem to be about John at all. It seemed like Sherlock was trying to confess to him something important about himself so John tried to focus like a good friend should. If Sherlock was having some type of problem then he wanted to help him.
"I'll only be gone an hour. I'm sure you'll be fine for that long. If it's a real emergency, Mycroft will call me."
Sherlock didn’t know how to comfort someone but he was trying his best because it was John and he needed him right now. He would do anything for him.
Sherlock hung up and finished his cigarette. He went back inside and considered actually following his brother’s advice for once.
John gave him a sympathetic expression. That annoyed Sherlock too. It was just like John to be so nice to him even when he was being an ass and didn't deserve it. He felt entitled to be an add though because Mycroft was an even bigger ass. It was Irene who had hurt him the worst but she wasn't here so he had no choice but to take it out on his brother. After all, if it wasn't for Mycroft he would still be living in blissful ignorance believing in love.
"Sherlock," she turned to him now with a smile that he could not return. "How have you been? Working on anything exciting?"
This gives John a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach and his heart starts to beat faster. This wasn't like Sherlock at all...
Sherlock could not be sure what the day would contain in the morning but for now he did his best to get some sleep. He found that sleep came surprisingly easy, exhausted from the interaction with his family.
Mycroft nodded and headed back towards the cabin. "You'd better hurry, brother dear, before our parents come looking for you. You know how much they disapprove of you smoking."
"Yes," he nodded simply as John gave him the information. "If you'll excuse me I have something to attend to." He started to race off but paused for a moment to say "The name's Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock looked even better all dressed up in a suit. They navigated the hospital party together, John being rather awkward and nervous. Sherlock didn't seem bothered at all by the fact that they were pretending to be dates and that he didn't know anyone at the party.
“I am,” John agreed immediately. “I’m a really lucky guy. Sherlock isn’t like anyone else I’ve ever met. He’s incredible. And he’s really pretty, that helps too.”
"Fuck... John... Oh...." Sherlock couldn't stop the noises spilling from his mouth. He arched his back a little. "I might..." he tried to say. John didn't stop. He was too good at this. Sherlock never imagined just how amazing this would feel. "John!" He cried out loudly, shuddering hard with his orgasm.
"You were right." John shivered a little, overcome by a sudden chill. "The killer is after their hearts."
“Sherlock, I came to-“ he starts to say, then he stops suddenly. He looks curiously at John and at Sherlock as if they might have sprouted antlers or something equally disturbing.
'Yes, I'll pick you up tomorrow and we can watch a movie at my house. My parents won't be home all night.'
When he finally walked to the dining area he found Mycroft there eating lunch. Anger flooded him and he burst. "Why would you do this?" He demanded. "Are you jealous of my happiness? Do you enjoy hurting me? You say you want to protect me but all you do is ruin everything!"
John was leaning down, kissing his neck, burying his face against him as his movements slowed and he moaned with his own orgasm. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and held him close as they both caught their breath.
Sherlock stood with her in the doorway while John went to change his clothes for the date with her. Sherlock talked about an unrelated case from the past, because that was the easiest subject for him to talk about. "But it was all a facade," he finished his story, putting emphasis on the word facade. "Remind you of anyone?"
He was falling now. He kept falling forever. He could hear John's voice begging him "One more miracle, stop being dead."
Men who liked men usually liked their men to have a penis. And he didn't completely blame them for that. He liked his men to have a penis too.
It kind of hurt hearing John say those things but it wasn't untrue. Sherlock had thought of this all himself already.
As Sherlock lay there falling asleep, he smiled to himself. He’d never been so happy in his life. “Let’s do this again tomorrow, John,” he suggested.
He kept an even pace. Sherlock made quiet noises the whole time but only fell apart when John reached and started stroking him to the same pace as his thrusts.
Meanwhile, John turned his attention to the boyfriend. “Tyler,” he began. “You said on the phone that you might have a tip for us?”
Sherlock understood what it was like to think you loved someone and then have them be a liar. It was better in the long run to know the truth even if it was painful, because then you could heal and move on with life and focus on better things. John would survive this and he would help him through it.
Its probably the best kiss Sherlock has ever had. Its startling, because for some reason Sherlock had never put bond mate and kissing in the same thought process, he was always thinking about his wings, but now - oh the experiments!
“Why would Moriarty get himself arrested and then have someone kidnap Sherlock, it isn’t like he needs the alibi?” John asks, he’s been pondering the question the whole drive over.
It isn’t a choice, Lestrade acts. As the spear goes flying, he leaps towards it, pulling his magic to him in a way he hasn’t done in years. His muscles ache, back straining with unexpected weight. His wings are a disarray of silver feathers long neglected, but certainly strong enough to sweep the spear away. He spins his athame, pulling his magic into the blade and returning it to it’s proper form. The blade and handle lengthen, metal warm and familiar in his hands, a spear forged by holy magic.
They pile into the jeep and try to take off quietly, but the old thing was never meant for stealth. The sound of the engine attracts the attention of the festival goers. There is a shout of Dari and then gunfire.
Before they leave, Don donates a holster for the gun and shows him how to attach it and conceal the weapon. Z donates a canteen of clean water. Murray gives him a hat and a stretchy brown thing that actually goes around his neck and tucks over his mouth and nose better than the bandana from before.
from that dank terrible shack in the Syrian wilderness was never suppose to be let back out. But one of the girls was crying; huge, silent tears running down her filthy cheeks because she knows the new men in the room are not the saviours she has been praying for.
“Something Charles Knight, it’s important,” John says, but his eyes are starting to look glazed and Lestrade isn’t sure if he knows what he is saying. Still, as he leaves the room he decides it wouldn’t hurt to give Henry a call.
Sherlock thought, equally worried. The telepathy could be very helpful, but having someone in his mind at all times would be beyond invasive.
“A level five bond, perhaps the strongest bonds need time,” Mycroft remarked, coming up beside Lestrade.
Irene laughed, covering her blood-red lips with a delicate hand. “Oh you are good, but no. I owe a favor to one Sebastian Moran, or, at least, the current one.”
“Oh we wouldn’t come empty handed great king, we brought tribute,” John says holding up the loaf of bread Bethesda sent them for, a 7-grain seed bread with sunflower crust.
“I’ve never had boiled aingil,” Balor taunts, turning to face them as he unwraps the last layer of cloth. The air hisses, water steaming.
John stops at his side and with a spark of holy magic, pulls his wings out of hiding. He flares them out, flapping them a few times before folding them behind him. The tips of his primaries ghost over the ground.
Lestrade curses, grabs Sherlock’s arm and sprints through the door. They make it out of the back without trouble, jumping past a curtain and onto the main stage. Lestrade lets himself relax too soon. There a whoosh of displaced air, and without thinking he throws them both to the side, covering Sherlock with his body.
She shakes her head, gaze softening, “No don’t look at me like that. I’m sorry, really, it was just a surprise. I’ve never seen them before. Your wings are beautiful, truly.” She bites her lip, a nervous gesture Lestrade hasn’t seen since they were both fresh out of the academy. “I forget sometimes. It’s so easy to sort you into the category of a sorcerer with an affinity for holy magic. I haven’t been...understanding about your Link. I’ll try.” She quirks a grin, “Though I still don’t like him.”
“I love this city,” John says, tilting his head back to try and make out the difference between stars and airplanes.
Two weeks later a construction crew pulls four mummified bodies and a living cat out of a brick wall. The bodies are identified as four completely unrelated missing persons that only disappeared within the last month. The coroner hasn’t the faintest clue how they were murdered or how they were mummified.
Being a consulting detective, having ‘The Work’, was the culmination of everything he had worked toward. He wasn’t happy, per se, but in the heat of a chase or the heart of a brilliant murder, it was a close thing.
“I bet that has an interesting story,” he chuckles, leaving the fridge alone. The labs remind him of a cleaner and better funded version of every lab he’s ever been in. There are the same traces of medical humour one finds in all hospitals. He finds fake goo, blood splatter on some of the fridges and someone had placed a plush E.coli by their computer. There is a plush yellow egg looking thing someone has taped to a filing cabinet and stuck a sticky note by with “We have Herpies :)”.
For Whom the Bell Tolls is going on a short hiatus while I get everything together for the Stucky Big Bang posting on the 18th. I will posting a full 50,000 word story over the course of 4 days, so please check that out in the interim. For Whom the Bell Tolls will come back in September once I get my reserve built back up. Thanks guys.
It is his coat that gives Lestrade pause. It is a rather dramatic belstaff, with the collar popped up and the tails flowing around his feet, though there is no wind. The left lapel has a bit of red stitching that winks at him. “You’re wearing a summoner’s cloak,” he says, surprised.
John turned and was greeted by his ex-girlfriend. "Mary Morstan? I should be asking you the same question."
Now that was a little offensive. What was so funny? what was John implying anyway? He was not 'easy'. And contrary to what John may believe, he was actually a very good boyfriend. He and Irene had been perfect for each other and they were both very happy in their relationship. John didn't know what he was talking about.
And John did. He threw himself at Sherlock, kissing him passionately. Somehow Sherlock ended up in John's lap and he was rocking his hips against John's as they kissed. He moaned quietly against John's lips and John's self-control went out the window.
"I've been wanting to do this, thinking about it all week... it was driving me insane," Sherlock confessed breathlessly. "I couldn't concentrate on my cases."
Sherlock turns over onto his hands and knees without a word. John follows Sherlock's lead and a moment later he is thrusting into Sherlock slowly. He moans. "You feel so good, Sherlock," he tells him.
Sherlock waved goodbye to them, even as his stomach did somersault at the thought of the two of them together on a date.
“John!” Sherlock exclaimed loudly. He clung to John tightly as he came, shuddering slightly with the intensity of it.
“You aren’t even human, are you? You’re completely insane. Don’t you realize what you’ve done to me?”
"You're coming home with me tonight. Mary is going to love you just as much as I do. We'll make this work, okay?"
"Do you have to? We have to work on the case," he'd tried to keep John from leaving. "What if I get heat stroke again?"
There was the guilt again. But he quickly remedied it, reminding himself that John was at least getting a nice vacation out of their deal.
John is at his desk making his way through a stack of patient files when he gets the text message. He rubs his eyes, clearing his vision, and reaches for his phone. It's been a long day and all of the paperwork seems to be blurring together. All he really wants is to go home and have a nice cup of tea.
Sherlock didn't get a chance to question John about this plan. Mycroft was walking back into the dining room now for dessert.
Sherlock sighed. “Do try to keep up, John,” he complained. “I’ll put in simple terms that your tiny brain can understand.” He spoke slower but his words were slightly slurred. “Sex alarms me. But with you, it wouldn’t alarm me.”
After their conversation with Eliza May, they spoke with a deputy officer and the morgue. They reviewed crime scene photos and autopsy reports. By the time they arrived back at the cabin, it was time for dinner. John dug into his steaks and potatoes without hesitation, starved after a busy day with no time to eat.
John was in his personal space now. Sherlock kept trying to step back but now he was pressed against the wall and there was nowhere to run.
They spent the rest of the afternoon talking and they exchanged cell phone numbers. John texted him later that night. No one had ever really shown interest in Sherlock before but he was pretty sure that John was flirting with him. It was confirmed when John told him that he was cute.
Mycroft had induced a vision, putting himself into a trance that had lasted over 24 hours. He had come out of it wide-eyed and sweating, looking moments from a panic attack, and then he had…
“I’m sure you can,” Lestrade agrees, drawing a powerful breaking rune in the air. The mark flashes with power, slamming into the spell with a sound like breaking glass.
“Both, my mum died in child birth, my dad a few years later,” he answers. His mother was a non-entity, a person that existed in the abstract, but he would never forget his dad. With his different teas and his warm jumpers and perfect hugs. No one ever hugged the way dad did, like he could shut out the world.
Seb rolls his eyes, like Moriarty is a headstrong toddler and not a criminal mastermind. “I know you wanted to play your game, but this one is much less likely to end with a bullet in your brain.” He gestures to Sherlock, “I’m sure you can come up with something new. You always say you’re so changeable.”
Bill is already sitting on one of the old booth benches, a half-drunk pale ale sitting in front of him.
The sickly thing cringes from him, shriveling in the glow of pure holy magic. Lestrade reaches out and carefully tugs the noose around Mrs. Hudson’s neck. The bond screams at his touch, flaring out in thorns that sting his palm. “I don’t think so,” he grins, pulling his athame into his free hand. The enchanted steel severs the bond with ease, turning the sickly shade into a dull grey.
Mycroft was ridiculously smug about the whole thing. “ You need to avoid him, Sherlock. Moriarty is not someone you wish to challenge.”
“Yes, I wanted to ask you some questions about that. I assume you have a gift for it,” Lestrade says, his decision to apologize thrown out the window.
with the world, Sherlock’s certain he has never looked like that before. The close up zooms out, revealing the blond, who he suspects is John. They are holding hands gazing into each others’ eyes as Mycroft stands behind them, reading from a bible. There is an exchange of rings and kisses, and Sherlock thinks his heart has stopped beating.
Behind the wall, the smallest of the men was being held back. “You can’t go out there Captain, you won’t be able to bring him back in time.”
Little shorter chapter this time, I had wanted it to be a bit longer, but this was a good end point. Next chapter shouldn't take too long to get out, though.
Lestrade meets them in the parlor, looking equally disheveled. “I just checked, Moriarty is still in his cell, hasn’t said a word.”
They head out just as the sun is starting to set. The sky lights in a riot of colors, beautiful even with the cloud of smog hanging thick over the city. Mycroft leads the way through a series of high-rise apartments that give way to an oasis.
Mycroft lets his gift guide the way, he stretches out his mind searching for possibilities. He doesn’t actually get visions of the future, more like impressions of what could be. There is a sense of cold and hate to the left that suggests a ghoul lurking, a screech to the right that hints at a banshee. Straight ahead, however, there is an feel of cold and damp, of dark energy and rage.
He gives a sharp knock before pushing into the barracks. The room is similar to the Compound, but the roof is claustrophobically close. Both walls are lined with beds, each having a trunk in front of them.
John and Mycroft take the elevator up to their floor, collapsing into the room in sweaty exhaustion. Mycroft doesn’t even argue when he takes the first shower. John isn’t sure if that’s because his wings look pathetic or if the mage is just too tired to move.
“You mentioned that before. You thought Moriarty had a right hand man, someone he trusted to do those sort of tasks, but we never found out who,” Lestrade interjects, looking between them.
“Two weeks ago, one of the tigers escaped from the zoo. It possessed a strength it should not have been capable of, and butchered it’s fellow tiger in the process. The Sing Magi had been looking into the escape, but it did not become a Division issue until yesterday. Our seers have now reviewed the scene and determined that the tiger became an Ilimu.”
John remembers the skull that had been pulled from the swamp. He imagines keeping the skull is illegal, and cleaning it may actually be considered a destruction of evidence. Instead of mentioning any of that he offers, “I have some lab space at the hospital. We could get a coffee on the way and you could use some of the bleaching equipment there.”
Research showed that 98% of the population had a soul mate, even if 10% died before ever meeting them. To find their given soul mate, a person must first have their ‘Vision’. The ‘Vision’ aids in finding the person and once first touch is established, the soul mark forms.
“Shower’s yours,” John mumbles once he is finally clean, collapsing onto the bed with a flop. The pillow is blessedly cool, and there is a freezing patch when he slides his hand beneath the pillow to pull it to him. He’s asleep in the next breath.
“English teacher, two older children, lost her husband around ten years ago, minor schizophrenia,” Sherlock listed off, he kneeled beside the body and pulled a folded paper from her scattered bag. “She met someone in the park this morning, male judging by the handwriting. They were close, this wasn’t the first time they met.”
Sherlock leads the way back to the pods. The dust storm is just getting started, dust clogging his nose, but not too thick to be impossible to see through. They both fall coughing into his room.
Soon turns out to be in the next ten minutes. Moriarty strolls in looking nothing like a man that just escaped from jail. He’s in another Westwood suit like the one from the pool, this time a grey number with pinstripes. A silver chain holds the blazer closed over a grey vest and a crisp white shirt, though he has forgone the tie. Sherlock can only imagine where he got it.
“This is fucking amazing, your family must have the best luck on the damn planet, or the worst I suppose,” Z chuckles.
It feels like looking under his own ribcage. The pulsing beat of his aura as steady and lifegiving as the organ it mimics. He can hold it in his hands, feel the delicate balance beneath his palms. He pulls it up even as he leans down to peer closer at the… the something that grabbed his attention. There is a single pinprick of light in the densest part of his soul, something both foreign and familiar.
With a huff Sherlock gestures at the pen and paper by the phone. “Look at it, pen on the left and the writing is clearly indicative of a left hand writer, look at the smudges. Not to mention a dozen other clues.”
“Oh,” Sherlock peered at his brother, sly. “Then getting rid of him should be a service to the crown. You always say I should be more civil minded.”
There is a long silence over the line. Smith breaks it with a sigh. “This is a stupid idea. You never struck me as a stupid man, Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock turns the full force of his glare on the detective. Lestrade is sitting up straighter, practically preening over the phone. “I don’t need an eye kept on me,” he spits.
“Ta,” John takes a seat, carefully rearranging his wings so they settle on the other side of the cot. He looked at the wall of murder photos and the mess that was his foot locker, his wings occasionally twitching in nervousness.
It meant everything to him to know that John would cancel on Mary in order to stay with him. But he had a new plan in mind that would fix everything once and for all. Going into his mind palace had solved his dilemma.
The woman's eyes momentarily widened, caught off guard. She sighed, shifting in a way that made her seem nervous. "Sure, come on inside."
Sherlock made his way into the bathroom attached to their bedroom. There was a large mirror above the sink with leaves etched into the sides. The bathroom also contained a big shower with a frosted glass door and a towel rack made of brass that resembled antlers.
"You're happy for me but you're going off doing drugs because I don't have time for you? Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound right now?" John's voice was rising in volume but he couldn't help himself.
Sherlock likes the comforting weight of the old quilt at night. But John seemed to get too hot beneath the blankets in the middle of the night, becoming restless, changing position as frequently, and inevitability kicking all blankets off. This meant that Sherlock usually woke feeling chilly and slightly vulnerable to see John lying peacefully on his back with his abs exposed due to his shirt sliding up.
John was alone on New Year's Eve. He passed on offers to attend any parties, not quite in the holiday mood. He simply told everyone that it just didn't work out with Sherlock. He almost wished things had been different between him and Sherlock. He was unlike anyone John had ever met. He found it exhilarating being around Sherlock. He was a fascinating and devastatingly handsome man. John thought maybe this was why he couldn't find a real date, his taste in men was a bit... different.
The flowers were atrocious and all of the bright colors hurt his eyes. Mary had clearly chosen every detail of the wedding.
Mary insisted that he check it. So he looked at the screen and immediately knew that it was not a good sign. Mycroft Holmes never called him just to chat pleasantly. "I've got to take this," he told Mary. "I'm so sorry."
John tugged once more at Sherlock’s curls and Sherlock groaned helplessly into the kiss, rocking his hips against John’s in attempt to create friction.
She smiled. "I know what you really are, Sherlock Holmes," she said. "You are nothing but a junkie who solves crimes to get high."
"I couldn't... " now this was the tricky part, explaining where it went wrong. "I wasn't aroused. I felt nothing. Essentially, I couldn't 'get it up'."
John sighed again. "You won't let me in. You're no fun. At least tell me what you think he's doing with the hearts."
Another sharp tug to his hair and Sherlock couldn’t hold back a quiet groan. His hips instinctively shifted against John’s.
In the beginning it seemed like a good idea to have sex with Jim. But eventually the doubts began to creep into his mind. He wondered why Jim never called him attractive. He wondered why Jim never texted him except when he wanted sex. Sometimes Jim would ask how his day was going or something but he didn't seem to actually care about the answer and it would always turn sexual after that. He wondered why they never went on date anymore. He wondered if Jim was seeing other people. He especially wondered why Jim never said he cared about him or liked him or wanted to be his boyfriend.
"How did I not know?" He asked. "So stupid. She told me she got close to her clients and lead them on, but swore she didn't do anything real with them."
Sherlock had never shared a room with John, especially not a bed. This also made him nervous, though he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what he was afraid of.
Sherlock decided that he really did not like this woman. She was definitely a suspicious character. Still, this was not actually new information the boy was telling them.
When he heard a knock at his door, he expected to find one of his co-workers trying to pressure him to attend one of their parties. He wasn't expecting it to be Sherlock.
Lestrade followed Gregson down the hall. The walls were splotchy with soot and the whole place smelled like singed carpet. The back room was obviously a kid’s room, the walls were light blue and plastic stars had been pressed to the ceiling, some now melted into it. There was a dead body in the doorway, or at least Lestrade thought it was a body. The form was a large melted lump of char, like someone had torched the person with a flamethrower.
“Trolls?” John asks. They have trouble with them in London sometimes, the underground mythos wreaking havoc with the wiring.
Cracks form along the creature’s body. It howls in pain, limbs sprouting out of its back and surging forward.
“It can’t be,” Sherlock whines. He reaches forward and yanks her sleeve up, heedless of Molly’s squeak of protest. The bond is a pale peach level four. “I don’t believe this,” he growls, stepping back so Irene can get a better look.
“And Bauza is following after Don, I know,” John says, checking his watch. “Shit, I have to run, a few things to check on in the lab before class starts up again,” John stands and pushes Murray’s ranch covered carrots closer to the man.
He has to heave himself into a sitting position, his muscles are weak and wobbly with disuse. He rubs the crust of sleep from his eyes, taking in the obnoxious beeping of the surrounding machines and the harsh scent of antiseptic.
Gary, the taller man, nods, “Oh ay, thank goodness for poor Henry and his monster hound. I’d talk to Fletcher if your interested,” he points out the door to the man with the sign, “he does tours of the moors, says he’s seen the beast.”
When John can focus, he looks around the room. It’s brightly lit and looks like someone’s living room. He’s handcuffed to an old radiator which is warm against his back, but doesn’t burn. Overall, its rather anticlimactic for a serial killer, but John is well aware what the killer is capable of.
John spreads his wings, throwing himself into the air. It’s the worst pain he’s ever felt, even worse than being on fire a moment ago. His left shoulder is screaming and his left wing won’t bend properly. There is muscle and bone damage, magic structural damage, and a good chunk of feathers missing. He ignores it all.
They both hurry to secure their bags and acquire transport to their hotel in Manhattan. Mycroft had thought about renting a car, he does have a license, but he is hardly practiced and is well aware that New York City is no place for a driving novice. Judging by the harrowing journey of their taxi, he made the right decision.
John screams. Someone is touching his daemon and its not right. Pain shoots down his spine like molten lead and its worse then being shot. “Helios!”
“Well then come with me,” Sherlock dodges him by simply walking over the coffee table, “and unclose it.”
Now I realized they are just playing this off the books, where soldier hardly made anything in victorian, London and are just hoping not to many of the watchers are war vets, but you know food for thought. If John from the show really does have a gambling problem then apparently Sherlock actually has some tact not to mention it.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes really, but this is even deeper than I thought. It’s a smuggling ring.”
Moriarty and Haddock where sitting at the patio to tea like proper English gentlemen. They were so nicely placed; Hamish was certain Moriarty was expecting him. Seeing Moriarty in his scope, imagining his skull with one of his bullets in it, was a hopeless indulgence; it would not solve his problem.
“I could never be dull,” Hyperion rolled his eyes, perched on his desk as a small snow leopard. Hyperion favored smaller forms of animals, which Sherlock appreciated. It made him easier to carry.
Sorry for such a long delay on this one. It's been a hectic few months. I ended up doing my first craft show in December, but I got talked into it two weeks before the show with zero inventory. I ended up sewing 22 wax canvas bags and 8 pencil rolls in time for the show. It was exhausting, but I did really well.
Mycroft’s eyes barely widen, but his surprise is obvious. “I had suspected, but not confirmed.” His gaze darts quickly over Greg’s appearance, “You met his bond mate?”
Helios is on the other side of the room. She has a muzzle on and a metal chain around her neck, the lead wrapped around an stone support pillar. She can open her mouth just wide enough to talk, but not wide enough to produce much flame.
Colonel’s brow shoots up. “Angel links aren’t usually that strong. Why weren’t you here with him then?”
One way or the other, John loved the Army. He had found his niche in the bloody desert of a foreign land. So, of course, that was when he had his Vision.
The trip to St. Barts was uneventful, though John was still staring at him oddly for acquiring two cups of earl grey for them. Sherlock was rather proud of the idea, he had deduced that John was a tea man, and that the substance would be beneficial for his mental well-being after what seemed to have been a traumatic experience for the man. While there still seemed to be a door shut between them, the tea did seem to infuse some warmth along the bond.
Lestrade flips through the reports. “No signs of alcohol or drugs in any of the victims, but the necromancer that read the bodies reported increased…Huh.” He flips through the reports, checking that they match up.”
John shrugged, or attempted too, “It’s just right, I know it is. Just like I know he’s a brilliant idiot and he needs my help.”
“I would have shot three if I had a clear view of Moriarty,” John shrugged. It was a one-shoulder shrug, stiff from his bullet wound.
“I never saw him, Moriarty brought him on day one, I would recognize that man’s voice anywhere. The other I didn’t know from any of our files. He sounded young, very young. Moriarty asked him to get information from me and he just sneered at the things they had laid out, saying it wouldn’t work. He listed off a series of medical equipment. He clearly knew what he was talking about. He came back the next day, hooked up what I assume was an IV line and a catheter. He injected a local, washed his hands and started cutting. He hardly spoke, just hummed and sang like a psycho while he worked. “
. His entire forearm is covered in raised black lines like scars, and the edges of the line are bright red and inflamed, while any bare skin is a blueish-purple-yellow bruise. It looks like a bizarre infection, and judging by the curling black scar nearing Henry’s elbow, its spreading.
“What?” Sherlock’s face scrunches up into innocent confusion, actually looking his age before it smooths into cool disdain. “No, I’m looking for clues into what your discipline is. Magi in the MET have to be class 5 or higher and to make detective as quickly as you did, at least a class 7.”
They head out just as the sun crests the horizon. Ruiz drives, with Gabriel in the seat next to her. She keeps her hands pressed to the dash, golden sparks lighting from her fingers and dancing about the cab. John can feel the concealment spell, guarding them from sight and attack.
“You know if I had been hiding from assailants, your constant calling would have gotten me killed,” Sherlock snaps.
John feels a great swell of gratitude for the Guardian, for his kind words and his kind gaze, but cannot bow to his wishes. He lifts his wings, unfurling them in an arching display above his head. “I am sorry, but as you said, I am a protector.”
He steps into the bedroom and gags. Van Coon is dead, splayed across the bed with a knife in his throat and a gun in his palm. There is an older chinese woman crumpled on the floor, a puddle of blood drying on the carpet beneath her from the gunshot wound in her gut. Beside her, is a pile of black sludge that Lestrade assumes are the remains of Zhi Zu, his body released from the spell when the General died.
“No, I think you know exactly when to bite,” Jim nipped at his collarbone in teasing, than he was getting up, leaving the bed with a stretch. “I want you to take the day off, go do something…fun” he flicked his wrist lazily.
Mycroft took the seat across from him and waited. Not long after, John appeared with a tray of tea and a scathing glare for his flat mate.
“I am rage,” it snarls, clawing forward with a sound like breaking bones. Its tongue flicks out, lapping gore from its fur. “Hate,” with each step the creature seems to twist on itself, legs lengthening, jaw reforming. Its tail flicks in the air behind it, almost playfully. “Hunger” it hisses, rising to a snarl just as the beast leaps.
“Do not thank me yet Fallen Star, Farsight. The road you are on is a long one, and I cannot see the state you will be in at its end. Stay strong, darkness haunts your steps.” Tianlong twists in a last dazzling display of scales, coils rippling as she ascends the sky, disappearing into the night with a streak of starlight.
Sherlock still isn’t certain how Mycroft managed to secure a job that usually requires at least a bachelor's when the man still hasn’t graduated secondary school, but if anyone could do it, Mycroft could. The new job and paycheck seems to settle some of the unease between the bonded. They still dance around each other, but now they seem to dance a little closer.
Moriarty slid into his space, “You’ll stay here.” He ran his fingers down the black patch on Hamish’s jacket, meant for shouldering guns.
John deflates, wings dipping to drag along the ground. “Yeah, okay,” he admits. “Where are we going?”
“New job?” John asks, avoiding the topic of Don’s leg. Don had received the same nanite transfusion that John had, but being older and with the wound in bad shape his new nerves didn’t fire quite right. The leg was still better than a prosthetic, but caused trouble when synapses misfired.
On the last day of Smith’s time frame, he and James manage to circumvent the shielding and get to open air. They find themselves in an old shipyard. The air smells of salt and rotting fish. The night sky is obscured by smog and city lights. John thinks it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
“I was rather surprised to find the last Sebastian was no longer with us,” Irene commented, she was very careful not to stiffen at his proximity.
“There is a high chance,” Hamish remarked, pulling the edges of the incision open with clamps. This was a lot harder without a nurse to assist.
I cannot apologize enough for returning you to a place I know you hate, but I would rather have you unhappy than dead. My vision revealed a fatal threat to you should you continue on this mission. I cannot explain further, but I hope that you understand, and respect my reasoning.
He grabs an IV pole as he rushes past, it is an unruly thing with four wheels on the bottom, but the top was broken at some point and is now a jagged metal tip perfect for his intention. Spinning around, he holds the sharp tip of the pole in front of him like a spear.
Sherlock scowled at him, because it seemed the correct response to Mycroft speaking,  “John, his name is John.”
Lestrade’s never heard a bigger load of bollocks in his life, but instead of calling him out on it, he offers his arm with a grin. “I’d love a coffee.”
“We’ll have to vacate for a few hours. Mycroft’s men will be dealing with the clean up. Perhaps a wipe down for you, John,” Sherlock said, indicating the arterial splatter John had attained across his chest and face. “We shall continue the search at St. Bart’s they have an acceptable computer lab.”
They took a cab to a building beside the pool. John, being the better marksmen, went to the roof. Bill went to the pool to set up communications and hide in the girl’s locker room.
Revealing any information about Moriarty to his brother was a bad idea, but he could not allow a situation like the day before to repeat itself. Resigned, Mycroft made his way up the 17 steps to 221B.
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” Sherlock teases. He finds his own updraft, the warm wind swirling him into the air until he is matched with John. They are high enough up that they can no longer see the housing units through the sand, but that hardly gives an accurate account of how far they have gone.
They found a crumbling bridge hidden in the depths of the warehouse district. In the fading sunlight there was a huddle of threadbare blankets and newspaper under the bridge.
John brushes some of the sand away, a nervous habit. “I’m looking for my little sister, she should be near the Kandahar province.”
Sherlock steps forward, looming. “You are a scientist. You would not make a poison and not produce an antidote at the same time. It is simply proper procedure.”
I'm sorry this took so long, school started up again. I know some people are going to be made about this ending, but you have to remember that this is a oneshot, and for once I wanted an ending that left them with promise but not a guaranteed happy ever after.
Hunting down the Golem, may not have been one of Sherlock’s brightest ideas. While he knew the assassin was large, the eight-foot behemoth that had tried to strangle him at the science museum had been a surprise.
Also attached, was an image of John at his bank at the day he disappeared from the hospital, withdrawing 5,000 pounds from his Savings.
Sally looks down at the body, brow furrowed. “It’s too early to tell, but look at the bruising,” she gestures at his arms and legs.
Sherlock opens his mouth to begin one of his usual tirades, but instead he gasps. His eyes go wide with shock and his knees weaken beneath him. He collapses into a heap, clenching at his left shoulder.
Here is a nice long chapter to make up for the short hiatus, but at least the Stucky Big Bang is done and posted.
Time is of the essence, but they have to stop at an old jeep. It has an ancient radio the size and weight of a brick in the consol. It takes Z only a moment to hotwire the car and start fiddling with the radio. He doesn’t explain his actions, but John recognizes the morse code. He’s calling for help.
Lestrade waved it away.  “You’re family now, I could hardly expect Sherlock’s mate to be someone that wouldn’t cause me endless paperwork.”
“The truth, is this is all a ploy to get you to uncover the code I have on my phone.  A code that involves your brother and could very easily get me the protection I need to stay away from our hmm… mutual friend.” There was the slightest of tremors in Irene’s hand.
“This one is a bit more personal,” Q says softly, pulling an old fashioned pocket watch from the table. The casing looks gold and is covered in strange markings.
Mr. Hawthorne, the butler and Sherlock’s ‘minder’, is in the kitchen with a cuppa. He hardly spares Sherlock a glance. “You’ve been leaving early,” he comments off hand.
Don places his hand on John’s brow, its dry and calloused and reminds John of his dad. For a moment he remembers home and happiness, but then he feels the injection in his left thigh.
When the pain subsided, Sherlock was still surrounded by blackness, but he could see Lestrade, Mycroft, Sally, and Anderson around him.
Sherlock narrows his eyes, focusing, but Lestrade makes as little sense now as he did at the crime scene. His aura is strange, obviously magical, but not consistent with any of the disciplines he’s familiar with, and Sherlock is familiar with all of them. At best guess his aura has the feel of a sorcerer, certainly elemental, but Sherlock doesn’t guess, so he holds off on that deduction for now.
Sherlock whips around, only to see Bruiser now sprawled on the ground. There is another boy above him. He is smaller and younger than Bruiser, but older than Sherlock, probably around sixteen. Whatever his age, he has broken Bruiser’s nose. The older boy looks stunned, looking up with wide eyes.
Sherlock stands quickly, sprinting from the door. He has to find John. He bolts for the locker rooms, which are really just two utility closets that got cleaned out for the fighters. He finds John in one of them, already dressed for the fight.
John flinches, surprised to find Smith standing in the doorway. His suit jacket is missing, tie loosened, but looks remarkably put together for a man that just fought a...whatever the hell that was. “Thank you,” John nods. He moves back to Mycroft’s side, shoving the stones back into his pocket as he goes.
“Yeah, and mostly lucid this time,” John grinned, but his smile fell as his memories rushed back, “Bill, did I…Did I have my?” He couldn’t say it, couldn’t risk the answer being no.
“Wait, please,” Lestrade struggles to pull his wallet from his pocket so he can hand them his card, his rush sends it and his soul metal to the floor with a clatter. “Shite,” he cusses reaching down to grab them both.
Sherlock takes the pair of snips from one desk and pulls down the plants he needs. The scent of the fresh cut blooms brings back memories. He recalls many afternoons as a boy, his father lifting him up so he could see over the counter. He had learned each plant and their uses at his father’s knee.
In his first study of the bonds, Sherlock thought the idea of having one perfect person for him in the world was a grand thing, but further study showed cases like his Mummy, who suffered from a weak bond.
“Greggory found the key evidence that led to the capture of the group,” Mycroft preens, clearly proud of his mate.
he called across the link. The feelings coming from Sherlock were rather strange and he could not immediately identify them.
“And the fledgling comessss,” hisses a voice from the dark. The shadows disconnect to reveal a creature that could be considered humanoid in only the loosest of terms. It’s face is deathly pale, streaked through with vines of jaundice yellow like it’s narrow eyes. It lurches forward on twisted legs ending in hooked claws. Bulging from its back are deformed parodies of the wings John carries with pride. Before him, is an archdemon.
Mum ‘faded’ after that. Her skin grew translucent pale, her eyes smudged with lack of sleep. Worst of all, was the now endless collection of alcohol filling the flat.
“Stay here, Sherlock,” Lestrade pulls his athame from his pocket, grip white-knuckle tight. “I mean it,” he fixes Sherlock with a stern glare, “I smell blood.”
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade holds up his hands, “maybe they just wanted a cuppa.” He leans closer to get a look at the goo on one of the shelves because no matter how much he doesn’t want to, it is part of his job. The stuff smells like manure with the consistency of snot. “Oh, that’s rank,” he snorts, rearing back and rubbing his offended nose. “Well most of that list makes sense, goblins are just another member of the fae, but what’s with the salt? Fae hate salt.”
Dr. Stapleton scowls at them when Sherlock walks into the lab. “I told you it would take more time, I haven’t collected enough antibodies yet.”
He isn’t thinking straight when he grabs the leader by his neck and hauls him up like a particularly disgusting piece of refuse. He flings him on the table and holds him down with a series of zip ties he always keeps in his back pocket – a hold over from father.
“I will start the search immediately, he will be found within the day, I have no doubt. “ Mycroft pulled his phone, ready to start issuing orders.
“We are very pleased with your progress John, but if you will,” Moneypenny scolds, though her gaze is friendly.
This time Carson’s heart rate shot to 180 as soon as he made the cut. He had to inject a mild sedative or risk heart attack.
He knows the man is reading him. His back and front are a serious of lash scars and tiny parallel nicks from a Syrian with a lot of time on his hands. There’s a scar on his arm from a near-miss bullet wound and a tiny raised bump from the removal of his appendix. There are the small scratches he’d earned as a kid in Sherlock’s school of lock picking, and the weird X over his collarbone from Uncle Greg’s lesson in wrestling that went pear-shaped when he hit the living-room table.
John can see the oil fields of Kandahar shimmering far in the distance, and is thinking how close they are. That’s when the chain ignites. It starts with Don, a burst at his side that throws him off his feet.
They all pull out these green bags and add a bit of water to them. The small white packet inside the bag sizzles and begins to smoke before they shove in a brownish bag and roll it closed. “MRE’s,” Don answers John’s questioning look, which doesn’t really answer anything. “So tell us your story, we didn’t have time to chat before the damn duster was on us.”
“You were a bloody idiot it what you were,” Lestrade snarls, sounding furious. He hadn’t even sounded that angry when Sherlock had made the stupid comment at Van Coon’s. He can hear the rustle of feathers and can just imagine Lestrade’s stance. “You put bloody poison in your eyes! What were you thinking?”
“Wait! What?” Lestrade scrabbled after him. This whole madness was just a mess, and Sherlock was getting worse, flouncing off on his own without a hint of a clue. Someone knew just how to play the mad genius.
“You are quite presumptuous fledgling,” he rumbles. The curved muzzle and long fangs reminds John of the Ilimu, but he finds comfort in the large mane, the mass of white and silver fur, glinting golden in the sun. “Though it is no surprise, your sort have always been entitled.”
John jerked at the sharp grate of metal against metal, of the click of the bullet sliding into place. “Helios,” he wheezed. He was so scared, he couldn’t even move, his body just shook, heart pounding against his heaving chest.
“Sir, he may not even show up. That freak is probably doing this himself, lost his mind,” Donovan adds.
Lestrade has to lean forward to pull his wings out, letting them lay along the sides of the chair, the primaries curving uncomfortably along the floor. He avoids looking at them, he still hasn’t taken the time to groom them, but he needs them out to better channel his magicks. “It’s alright, just sit still for me, please,” Lestrade sooths.
He scrabbles on the tile floor, half crawling, half lunging from the momentarily stunned beast. He spins and fires another shot, his vision is still blurry, but he hears a sharp whine that means he probably hit it. He sprints away from the creature, his limbs feeling sluggish and heavy as he bolts across the lab.
- A fantasy/supernatural Johnlock story that will be attached to my Intertwined collection. In this story, John is what the world calls an Angel, powerful magical creatures that fall from the sky in search of their 'One'. He is taken in by MI6 in the hopes that they can find and recruit his one. At fourteen, John is introduced to one of MI6's new recruits, an All Seeing Eye by the name of Mycroft Holmes. He isn't John's one, but he feels compelled to protect him. With something attacking city Guardians John and Mycroft are sent out to hunt down the culprit.
Moriarty snaps his fingers and four goons appear like they’d multiplied through mitosis. “You two take care of this mess. I want it clean of evidence, but leave everything for the locals. I think our message is clear. You two get these girls taken care of. They are to be unharmed and returned home.”
Against the backdrop of the porch light, Mycroft looks particularly haggard. It is the first time John has seen him out of a three piece suit. His jacket and vest are gone, leaving behind a wrinkled white dress shirt, collar open and tie missing. There are dark marks under his eyes.
Sherlock crawls all over the scene in his usual manner, picking up bits of trash and debris that no one thought to investigate. “He knows each victim, it’s obviously jealousy over his lack of bond, but why these individuals, what made him choose them? Hmm.”
He approaches the graves with a scowl, but smooths out his expression when he brushes the snow from the stones. There is writing beneath. One reads “Timothy C. Holmes, Loving Husband and Father.” Below is a series of what would look like nonsense chemical equations to most, but Sherlock knows it is an alchemy joke about the meaning of life. Father always did have the worse sense of humour. The second grave reads “Wanda V. Holmes, Loving Wife and Mother.” Under the writing is a series of arithmancy equations, the punch line to father’s joke.
“I enjoy the mystery.” Hamish had used his appearance to his advantage quite often, it’s amazing what the right choice of clothes and posture could do for a disguise.
