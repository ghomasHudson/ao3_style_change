Luke Cage saluted him with a plate full of appetizers.  “You guys know how to throw a party,” he said with a wide grin.  He was wearing a white sweater adorned with blue snowflakes and a red scarf around his neck for a rakish dash of color.  He looked at the alcove.  “What’s all this?”
“What?” Steve asked, but the boy was already heading off to speak to someone else, a basket of masks balanced on his hip.  Steve watched him go, bemused.
Tony shoved a hand through his hair, pushing himself to his feet.  “Clever,” he said.  He waved off the men hovering nearby.  “It’s all right, we know who he is.”
“Last time I got an offer like this, I ended up in a basement in Brooklyn,” Steve mumbled.  “And you’re the only one I’d be listening to about this, so-”
Shuri grinned at her.  “There is so much to see, so much to do, who can sit still?”  Okoye held out an apple, and Shuri studied it, her head tipped to the side.  “Who is this for?  Me?  Or her?”
“If I’m up, everyone has to be up,” he yelled at the closed bedroom doors, lifting the cover off of one of the room service platters.  Waffles.  He dropped it back down with a clatter, refilling his cup from the silver pot with his other hand.  “Children, it can’t take you this long to get dressed.  Let’s get a move on.”
“Harbor’s looking better and better,” he gritted out, even as he started walking up the pier, flanked on all sides by his sudden and unexpected escort.
Steve fell into step behind her.  “If you don't mind, Miss, I'm really not comfortable with-”  His voice dropped.  “I'm not a guest.”
DJ gave him a wide, proud smile, and Steve bit back a laugh.  Stark glanced at him, that perfect eyebrow arched again.  “Do you have something to add to the discussion, Officer?”
“Let us know,” Sam said.  He slung an arm around Steve's shoulders.  “But really.  If you have to throw a couple of people through a couple of walls, we understand.”
“Right, I don’t love you, not even a little, I’m bringing you up on charges for stealing my tech.”  Iron Man’s hand brushed against his hair, and Tony realized that the awkward angle of his fingers had a purpose.  Not once had he held his hand so the repulsor faced DJ.
"There was a fake thing," Tony said.  "A ridiculous fake thing, and we were wearing formal clothes, it was-"  He didn't know how to explain this without it sounding insane, but he suspected there was no good way to do it, other than to do it.  “We did a photo op.”
Grinning, Steve caught Happy's elbow, whispering an address to him. “Just give the barman a few dollars and tell him Rogers wants this guy tucked away for a few hours. He'll let you in the back and treat you like a king.”
Fury smiled, just a little, a twitch of his mouth.  “You keep doing just what you're doing.  When they send these things out into the city-”
“Yes, yes, I'll rip the label off next time,” Tony said, throwing himself down on the couch with a sigh.  The pizza boxes were almost within reach, and he considered them with a narrow look.  “Just drink it.”
“I can-” The girl stepped forward, her hands coming up, then she stopped, as if she didn’t know what to do.  She gave Darcy a hopeless look.
Tony stared at him, his heart in his throat.  “We tag-team Doom and I want lunch next week, too.”  Steve was laughing now, his face alive with it, and Tony knew this would be the ruin of him.  He wasn't sure he cared.
“Jesus, Cap,” Luke said, yanking the man out of the remains of the bomb.  A SHIELD team was waiting to load him onto a stretcher and bundle him out of the building.  “Did he talk bad about your mother?”
The sign that hung over the door had seen better days, the paint worn thin, and the carving almost illegible.  Steve could still make out the words, “Pym’s Clockworks,” even if the establishment date was lost to time.  The broad windows at the front of the shop were coated in grime, but he could still see the shadowy, ghostly outlines of several clocks sitting  just on the other side of the glass, and beyond that, something that might’ve been the proprietor, bent over his workbench.
“Now that her highness has broken the ice, we’re doing this alphabetically,” Tony declared.  “Otherwise, it’ll be an hour of ‘you go,’ ‘no, you go,’ and I want to eat sometime today.” He took a sip of his cocoa and pointed at Bruce.  “Banner.  You’re up.”
DJ shot upwards, an arc of light that cut across the velvety blackness of the sky, and it was like watching a firework, primed and ready to explode.  He passed out of the range of the headlights and far up above their heads, the armor catching the moonlight as he accelerated.
There was a moment of pause.  Clint raised his hand.  Then he looked up at it, a faux shocked look on his face.  “Oh.  Look.  Just me.”  He gave Tony a wide, enthusiastic smile.  “I mean.  You want to be responsible for all three of them, you go ahead.”
“There’s been some trouble.”  Steve dug his fork into the bowl.  He’d never seen a dish quite like it, but the memory of an empty belly was a constant companion, and he’d never been a picky eater.  The rice was spicy and sweet, all at once, an unfamiliar tang that bit against his tongue and the back of his throat.  But rice mellowed it, and the thick rounds of sausage were delicious.  He dug in, taking another few bites before he looked up again.  “It’s steady work.  Which is hard to find these days.”
I want credit.  I originally had the last scene attached to the next chapter and then I realized some of you know where I live and would have absolutely no problem with showing up with pitchforks and torches, demanding justice for Peter.
"Thank you, ma'am."  Suddenly exhausted, Steve headed up the stairs, ignoring the way the wood creaked and shifted under his feet.  He was used to that by now, used to having to twist to the side to slip through the narrow gaps between floors, used to skipping the steps that he knew wouldn't take his weight.
Carol made a rude noise under her breath as she tossed what used to be a very expensive piece of beachfront real estate off of the dock.  “Nice to know that Thor managed to physically wrestle him into the quinjet, you mean.” she said, dusting off her hands.
Steve pulled his sneakers on, twisting his feet against the floor, testing them for comfort.  “Jarvis, can I get a weather report?”
DJ was sitting at the end of the bed, his knees drawn up against his chest, his arms wrapped around them, fingers tight in the fabric of his pajama pants.  He blinked at Steve, slow and careful.  “Do you love us?”
Steve's hand rested on DJ's hair, lingering there.  "But sometimes.  If you go places everyone tells you not to go.  If you speak names that aren't yours to speak.  If you linger by a fire you did not set.
Jan immediately moved her chair towards Greer’s side of the table, the legs scraping cheerfully across the tile floor.  “And why would we be getting Sam flowers?” she asked, her voice a bright trill.
“I suspect you would,” he said.  He rested a hand on the tabletop, his fingers rattling against the wood.  “Do you know why I’m currently sitting on the throne, Captain?”  Steve shook his head, and Nicholas smiled.  “Because no one wanted me there.”
Bobbi paused.  “I suspect most of what’s been happening has gone unnoticed.  But people talk.  Rumors and innuendos.  Gossip and whispers.”  She tossed a page onto the seat between them.  “It was a group of sailors from French Sudan who gave him his name.  The cloth he wrapped around his head and face reminded them of the Bedouin who wandered the Sahara desert.”
“These are tech reporters,” she said.  “We did this deliberately.  None of these people will risk alienating StarkIndustries by going out of bounds here.  They want to keep their access to the company.  They're going to ask some questions, there's no way they won't, but they will not attack him.”
"I'm not," Steve said, before Sam was even finished with the sentence.  Sam looked at him, and Steve gave a slight shrug.  "It's...  That's an invasion of privacy."  He shifted his weight from one foot to the other.  "Isn't it?"
She pointed at Clint, who flopped back on the couch, limbs going in all directions.  “What he did,” she said.  “That.  Right there.”
“I absolutely did not, that was Banner and Brand and Barton and I was not involved,” Tony said.  He held up three fingers.  “The Bastard Band of Bs.”
“Could I make up something that makes me look that bad?” he managed.  “I mean, I could, but why would I?”  He glanced up, his eyes dancing.  “Nope, that’s word for word what she said, cool as anything.
“Yes, but you are my problem,” Pepper said.  Her foot tapped against the tile.  “Fine.  Last resort.”
Steve's head tipped to the side.  "I-" His fingers twitched, and he let the page fall back into place.  "Nothing major.  A change in the scale, looks like the draftsman made a mistake when he picked up his work again after a break, or maybe on the next day.  You've already-"
Steve's head rolled to the side, just a little, just far enough to find Sam sitting next to his bed, a tablet braced on one knee.  Sam smiled at him.  “How're you feeling?”
Shuri pulled her horse to a gentle stop.  “Does it seem familiar?” she asked.  There was no demand in her voice, just a simple curiosity.
“We can’t-” The blonde shoved his hand through his hair.  “There’s a documentation problem,” he said, his voice low.  “Trust me.  They can’t legally get married here, but we figured this was better than nothing, and you know, it’s…”  He looked at the kid, his jaw going tight, before he turned back to Trip.  “It’s complicated.”
“I knew I could count on you.” Tony threw an arm around Hammer's shoulders. “Such a pleasure meeting you, it's not often I get to talk to a man like you.” He glanced back at Steve. “Such a pleasure.”
Greer jumped, and that’s when Steve realized he’d all but shouted that.  She looked at him, her eyes wide, and Steve stared back.  “You’re talking about Sam, of course, you’re talking about Sam, right, right, of course we’re-”  Relief made him dizzy and he rocked forward, grabbing her arm.  “Sam.”
“Thank you!” he said, tipping the chair onto its back legs, bracing one foot on the front of Phil’s desk.  “So you’re mad because of the photo?”
"You do remember-" Luke managed to surface long enough to aim a glare in her direction.  "That this is dance class, right?  You got that?"
“I have people for that,” Tony told him.  “And those people have clearly been falling down on his job, because I am not sure when-”  He stopped.  “Right.  End of the week.  No.  We do not have any plans.  I’m not sure what plans I should be-”
“Well, I think that would result in you eating every meal from that bowl for the rest of your life,” Jarvis said.  “As we both know after thirty seconds of looking at china patterns for a replacement, your eyes will glaze over and you’ll decide that your meals are best served out of the nearest bucket.”
The trip from the curb to his door was a blur, in the edges of his vision, he caught a glimpse of familiar faces, voices trailing behind them as they took the stairs at a run, Tony sprinting along ahead of him.  Steve’s door always stuck, the hinges tight with rust and the wood swelling every time it rained.  Tony hit it with a thump, and Steve reached past him, his hand closing on Tony’s.  Together, they wrenched the door open.
“I refuse to work in silence if I can avoid it,” Rhodey said, grabbing Happy’s shoulder as he tripped over Clint’s feet, knocking him into the wall.  Laughing, Rhodey braced Happy until he found his balance again.  “And you showing up is a bonus.”
“Right.  Logic,” Tony said, his voice tight.  Steve frowned, but before he could say anything, Tony continued.  “My favorite thing.  Logic.”
Happy kicked him solidly in the ribs, sending him crashing down into the darkness of the water.  “Hey, what’re you-”
Steve smiled back.  “I was in the army,” he said, choosing a paring knife from the block.  “And wasn't always known for following orders, so...”  One shoulder rose in a shrug.  “Spent a lot of time peeling potatoes.”
He took one step and stepped on Tony's foot.  He bit out a curse, the worse hissed out from between his teeth.
“The Council of Lesbians and Steve is disbanded,” Carol announced, and someone chucked a balled up napkin at her.  “Your acts of political violence change nothing."
“If Happy isn't waiting for me at the curb, I swear I'm coming right back up here and dumping half a bottle of scotch into the nearest hot drink and sleeping until New Years.”
“No,” Steve told him, but he was smiling.  He offered Tony his sandwich.  Tony picked a sausage out of it, popping it into his mouth.  Steve did the same, licking his fingers clean.  “I did the one with the King's office, or maybe it's the Prime Minister's, I don't even know-”
“Fire fixes a lot of problems,” Jessica said.  She paused.  “Makes some other problems, but still.”  Her teeth flashed in a grin.  “Fun.”
“Really?” Steve reached around him, snagging a pea pod from the box  on the other side of his hips.  “Good to know.”
Tony's eyes fluttered shut, just for a second, a second to savor the gentle pressure of Steve's lips, the heat of his body, so close, so familiar.  A second to memorize the pressure of Steve's hand on his shoulder as he leaned in, the soft exhale of his breath as he straightened up again.
She glanced over as the kitchen door opened, her chin coming up, a faint flicker of hope crossing her face.  An instant later, it was gone, but she managed a smile in any case.  “Welcome back, Officer Rogers.”
Steve handed one over.  “I think I can be forgiven for wanting to know how Stark ended up with a French chef who wasn’t a chef, or French.”
He leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest and keeping a wary eye on her.  "Yes, you have.  Haven't you?”  He paused, his eyes narrowing.  “I could have sworn that you-"
“But I have much interest in learning!” Thor threw his arm around Jane's shoulders.  “As does Jane!”
She smiled, and it was a sad, resigned sort of smile.  “It is, as you might imagine, a very isolating feeling.”
"Hey."  Tony leaned forward, the chair rocking on its wheels.  "You know the rules.  You know how this works.  He's not allowed to keep secrets if you are in pain or frightened.  He can't do it.  You agreed to that." He leaned in, his eyebrows arching.  "Right?"
Tony’s eyes darted over his face.  “What’s wrong?” he asked, and there was a break in the words, a crack in his voice.  “Steve.  Are you sick?” His throat worked.  “Are you dying?”
Before he could do more than reach for the ring, Steve's fingers snapped closed, curling tight against his palm.  He pulled his hand back, out of reach, before he let his hand relax again.  “Give a fella a second, will ya?” he asked.
Tony paused just outside the elevator, caught off guard.  It had been a long time since there had been anyone else in the penthouse when he came home.  Even when he'd been with Pepper, it had been a toss-up as to which of them would get there first.  And neither of them had been much for cooking.
He shifted his weight and the 'marriage license' in his pocket crinkled against the railing.  He reached down, his fingers smoothing over the fabric, making sure it was still safe.  He wasn't sure why.  He should throw the damn thing out before anyone else saw it.  It was childish.  Foolish.  Pathetic.
“Deleted, I know, but I also know you.” Tony’s fingertip rattled against the workbench.  “Get me anything and everything we’ve still got.  I don’t care what kind of breadcrumbs we’re talking about, get me everything.”
Tony followed him in, pausing in the doorway for a moment to take in the sight of Steve, half sprawled across the plush bench seat, his jacket askew and his hair a tumbled mess. “God DAMN,” he said, dizzy with it.
"You seem to recall you riding my best serving tray down the full length of the grand staircase like a sled," Jarvis said, catching the other end of the blanket and helping Mrs. Parker move it to the railing.  “On an almost daily basis.”
“She has a point, darling,” Jan mused.  “Best way to judge a musician is to see if he can play with the group you’ve already got.”
He swayed, just an inch or two, his shoulder brushing against Steve's.  “No amount of wanting it is going to make it reality, Steve.  Just because you fantasized about a thing, or a situation, or-” He shrugged.  “Or a person.”
And, as it turned out, it was also just big enough to hold what seemed, at first glance, to be about fifty SHIELD agents.
Peter pushed open the door at the end of the hall, stepping out onto the second floor landing.  It closed behind him, the door disappearing as the panel slid seamlessly in place.  Peter jogged up the hall, his bare feet silent on the carpet runner.  The house was still and quiet, with only a few lamps left on to cast dim light across the landing.
"Yeah.”  Sam braced his hands on his hips. “Steve?  Remember after you took that life drawing class?  And you were working on your anatomy?  You had a sketchbook full of nudes?”
The drawers were locked, too, and Steve braced a hand on the top, giving it a hard yank.  The lock snapped and the drawer came loose of the cabinet, files slamming against each other as the drawer hit the floor.  A quick glance was all it took to determine that DJ’s file was missing.  He looked up to where Happy was standing, hand braced on the wall.
“Hammer’s going to give you a whipping and a half when he sees this,” he said, his eyes darting around the floor  “Billy, what-”
“Sir!” A man in a slightly old-fashioned black suit came hurrying across the garage floor, his aristocratic, fine boned face holding just a trace of panic.  “Have you seen-”
Pepper twisted around in time to see Bruce walking up the stairs from the garden, a broad brimmed straw hat sitting crooked on his head, and a basket in each hand.  They were filled to the brim, turnip greens and beet leaves trailing over the edges, piles of dusty sweet potatoes and carrots, squash and stalks of round, plump brussel sprouts.  DJ trailed along right behind him, hopping up the steps, his arms wrapped tight around a similar wicker basket.
From a distance, he was aware of movement, of words.  Of the sound of a door, opening and closing.  But mostly, he was aware of the light, warm and comforting and all-encompassing.  He was aware, on some level, of the broom being pulled from his hands, and he let it go.  He didn’t need it.  He didn’t need anything.
DJ considered the cat, his eyes narrowed.  He scrambled up, sitting down on the edge of Tony's desk.  “Furbro,” he said at last.
Steve was still staring at him, his face flushed, his lips parted, and Tony realized he was still clutching the front of Steve's jacket, the fabric twisted between his fingers. Tony pulled him down, and Steve met him halfway, their mouths colliding with more force than grace. Tony couldn't ever remember being this desperate, this needy, and despite that, he was laughing, or maybe Steve was.
“I heard,” she said.  “In fact, everyone heard.”   She turned back to the coat rack, setting her handbag neatly on the hook.  “And what, exactly, was that?”
Once they were gone, the door shut securely behind them, Tony returned to the main room of the suite.  Even for Vegas, it was large, with a dozen or more rooms; he hadn’t spent much time exploring last night.  He’d found DJ a bedroom, found himself a bedroom, and had assumed everyone else could take care of themselves.
The man slumped unconscious in his grip, and Steve let him fall to the ground.  Behind him, he heard the sound of tires squealing on the pavement, heard them slide, then catch.  He glanced back, just in time to see the car fishtail for a moment before pulling away.  He stood there, his heart in his throat, watching to make sure that they were gone.
Darcy took a bite of the churro, her jaw working as she tried to chew it.  Clint’s head tipped to the side.  “Speaking of overpaying…”
Natasha gave him a pitying look.  “Please, Phil, she had your father dialing on another phone halfway through that conversation..”  Natasha stepped inside, shutting the door behind her.  “And once Clint hung up, she took that phone from him and requested that I come down here and let you know that, and I quote, she can disown you at any time and she’s prepared to do it over this.”
“When I know where and when I’ll be landing, that is, if a city guard doesn’t manifest directly below me.”  Steve gave him a look, and Tony grinned.  “Not that I don’t appreciate it, but I have fallen from much higher spots, and with a lot less…” He buttoned his vest up, smoothing the fabric into place around his narrow waist.  “Finesse.  More than once, actually.” He spread his arms wide, his smile bright.  “And look.  Still alive.”
“Spin is just a matter of making sure that the story that's told in the press is the story we want told,” Marcy said.  “Because you got married.  To another man.  In another country.  It looks like you eloped, Tony.  It looks like the two of you were trying to do this in secret and you got caught, and that is not the story we want.”
“He knows what he's about,” he said.  “And unless we're in the middle of the fight, he doesn't have to listen to me.”
"Yes, ma'am."  Peter folded his legs under him.  "You want pickled green beans, or cole slaw, or some cheese?" he asked DJ.
DJ darted around and between them, and occasionally, without looking or even seeming to notice they were doing it, one or the other would reach out, running a gentle hand over his hair or plucking him off the banister as he started to climb up a newel post.
He stopped. “I don't know why-” He blinked hard. “I guess, I guess that's the most comfortable anyone's ever been with me.” He would've cried, if he hadn't been so numb. “I don't know. I can't explain it. It's just-”
“He was the one we could get through the front door without setting off every alarm bell you've got,” Tony said.  “And it's clear that Xavier's crew is going to be involved in this.”  He spread his hands wide.  "It's corporate synergy."
“Yes.  She does.”  Smiling, T’Challa turned.  “Make your way back to the city by the backroads, my friends.  There are forces watching for you, even now, and best you find allies and shelter before taking them on.”
DJ slept through them ordering, collecting the food, and driving to the hotel.  Even as Clint drove them up to the front of the imposing, high end hotel, he didn’t stir. So when the doorman stepped forward to open Tony’s door, he waved him off.
Jan put the dishes in the dishwasher, her fingers lingering on the counter.  “I love Tony.  You know that.”
DJ reached for another cookie.  Cookies were uncomplicated.  “Yes,” he said, because Steve had that pinched, tight look on his face again, and he hated that face.  The answer must’ve been the one that Steve had been hoping for, because his face relaxed.  DJ smiled at him.  “Figure it out.”
Tony grinned at her.  “I figured you might’ve noticed him,” he said.  He fished in his pocket.  “I need you to go up and let him know that I’m taking the kid up to the balcony.  Just tell him Mr. Stark went upstairs with the boy.  He’ll be worried if this one-” He dipped his head in DJ’s direction.  “Doesn’t come back.  He’s got the rest of the boys, so he can’t come looking?”
“Right.”  Tony turned on his heel and headed for the other side of the workshop.  “Right.  So.  I think it’s time that I reviewed his spending.”
Giving up, he sat up, scrubbing his hands over his face.   He resisted looking at the clock.  However long he'd been lying here, it had been too long.  And despite that, it was still far too early to get up.  Steve considered his clothes, neatly folded on the chest at the foot of the bed.  A quick patrol around the house might exhaust him to the point where sleep was possible, and even if it didn't, it would at least feel more productive than lying here, wondering why Stark bought mattresses filled with quicksand.
Steve glanced up. Victor Aimsbridge was walking across the green room, a tablet tucked easily under his arm. He gave Steve a slight smile, his eyes bright behind the lenses of his glasses. “May I?” he asked, his pale eyebrows arching.
The cat stood up and jumped onto the table.  DJ went still as it padded around him, circling behind his back and taking a seat next to him.  It bumped its head against his elbow, a rusty purr making its ears twitch.  Cautious, DJ reached out, stroking a hand over its head.
Wanda Maximoff nodded, even as she pulled the spoon away from the woman’s hand.  The woman let it go without a fight, reaching for her cup instead.  “It’s not her,” Wanda repeated, leaning over to set the spoon on the table between them.  Her dark hair slid over her shoulder, soft curls bouncing against her cheek.  She looked up, giving DJ a faint smile.  “Agatha.  Look at him.”
Tony shook his head, his head swinging to watch a girl pass by them, close enough to touch, but without acknowledging them.  “You’re doing this,” he said to Strange.  “You’re, what, hiding us?”
“After you passed out last night,” Jesse repeated, unconcerned, “I ended up talking to a couple of the guys down in the hotel bar.”  She tucked a leg up under her.  There was a sort of wired energy to her posture that Ellen had learned to respect.  “Practiced my Russian.”
There were a half a dozen people there, maybe more, PAs and techs, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Joy getting her hair touched up, saw Ellen talking to Victor, but really, there was only one person who mattered, only one person he really saw.
"Already done."  Peter's voice echoed out of the depths of the truck.  His head popped out, blinking owlishly at Steve.  "When I saw you coming.  With him.  Figured you'd be going.  Batter's in the cold case, cabinets are secured and the fryer's sealed, so you should be almost good to go."
Tony waited until the bedroom door closed behind Jarvis with a firm click before he pushed the blanket back.  Steve glared up at him, his face flushed, his mouth a hard, tight line.  Tony struggled against an entirely unreasonable wave of affection.  “Just curious,” he said, flopping back against the pillows.  “What was your plan there, officer?  Running stark naked across the bedroom to the closet?”
Steve knew a trap when he saw one, but he also couldn't see any way out of it.  He sank down into the chair, the folder clutched between his hands.  He was somehow very reluctant to open it.  “Sir?”
DJ looked up with a grin.  “Yes.”  He looked at Steve, still seated on the bottom of the stairs.  “Dinner?”
Pepper set a hand down on top of the stack of files, preventing him from opening them.  He looked up, startled, and Pepper smiled.  “Name your price.”
“That it is,” Bobbi said.  “So.  It was odd.  That starting the night Mr. Stark was shot, the Nomad seemed to refocus his attentions.  Almost exclusively to rooting out the most dangerous elements of the anarchist groups.  Most people don’t believe the rumors, of course.  A single man?  Going after groups like that?”
“He's definitely got a cold, probably got the flu,” Steve said.  He glanced towards Tony, who stuck his tongue out in Steve's general direction.  Steve smiled, feeling better already.  “News travels fast.”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Rhodey said.  He tapped his foot on the floor.  “I take it the negotiations didn’t go the way Tony wanted them to?”
“Sorry, nope.”  His dad tapped his chopsticks on one of the little plastic trays.  “Saved you your favorite, though.”
“It is, here.” Jarvis met his eyes without flinching.  “Marriages work on similar terms.  As do families.” He sighed.  “If a company is owned by a man, but the board is made up of cousins and son-in-laws and childhood friends, all of whom will be excised without a second thought if they do not produce, if they step out of line or fail in their duty, is that so different?”
Tony stared at him, his eyes wide.  “You’re… Fast,” he said.  He glanced down to the street below, and back up at Steve. “You’re very fast.”
“Why is everyone here ARMED?” Harris asked, because Darcy was there, her hands sliding over his face, pushing his hair back, her fingers cradling his head.  “Everyone has a GUN.”
“There's that learning from experience thing again,” Tony mused, and stepped off the elevator to his doom.
Steve smiled, and Tony guessed they'd just made a silent, unspoken pact not to call each other on their bullshit lies. It was probably easier that way. “If I make anything, I'll leave you a plate in the oven.” His head dipped in something that approached a nod, and then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him.
Natasha looked down.  Bruce was hovering at the base of the wall, his shoulders almost up against the stone.  He peered around a neatly trimmed bush, and backed up a little further, trying to stay out of sight.  He glanced up at Natasha and Bobbi.  “What, what is he doing?” he repeated, his voice tense.
“No.” Steve didn’t move.  “We’re not going anywhere, Tony.  You are going to stay here.  Wait for any word.  Happy and I will go and have a chat with Hammer.”
Pepper rubbed a hand over her face.  “Why are all of your friends so…” She stopped, and sighed.  “So much like you?”
Tony looked at the shattered remains of the plate.  “Right,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  He was so tired that he ached, but he went down, his movements clumsy, to one knee, and started collecting the pieces.  “And how’s that working out for you?”
Shiro laughed as he wiped down the counter.  “Clint, fine.  He’s ruined six ‘spicy ramen challenge days’ in a row.”
Obie patted his pants pockets, his eyebrows drawn up tight as he searched for something.  “I shouldn’t, this early,” he said, pulling an aspirin tin from his vest pocket with a sigh of relief.  “But desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Tony studied him, wondering how much he could tempt fate.  “I never thought I was a particularly good judge of character,” he said at last.  “And I guess that was confirmed today.”  He looked over at the house, his head tipping back.  “There are certain…  Projects that my father started.  Connections he made.  I have my own, or course, but I inherited a lot from him.
“Actually, its purpose is for containment and extraction,” Gyrich said.  “We have clearance.  Stand down, and let it do its job.”
Pepper hopped up, taking a seat on the edge of the table. “I regret your fashion choices,” she said, and Tony laughed, the last of the strain bleeding out of him. Pepper's head tipped in his direction. “So much regret, Tony.”
Steve's head moved, just a little, just enough so that he could peer up at Tony with one red-rimmed eye.  “You'd resent me after a week,” he said.
“Don’t tempt me,” Tony said.  He reached out, snagging Harris by the back of his jacket.  “And you.  Stop trying to put yourself in front of me.”
Tony leaned his weight into the rolling pin, his teeth clenched against the throbbing pain behind his temples.  “I’m getting that impression, yeah.”
Steve hit the bottom landing and dropped Tony back to his feet. “Let's go,” he said, his hand catching Tony's, holding on tight.
On the second floor, Pepper stopped in front of the guest room, opening the door.  “Here.”  She stepped through, crossing to the middle of the room before she stopped.  “I put him to bed myself last night,” she said.  “At around nine pm.  Jarvis got up at five this morning, and noticed the door was open.  He came in to check on DJ and found the room empty.”  She took a deep breath.  “We've been looking since then, and haven't managed to locate him.”
“Usually am, honestly,” Clint said, wincing as the medic started cleaning the wound on his shoulder.  “It's fine, leave it-”
“Probably more than one,” Tony agreed, taking it back from her.  He scribbled on the line she indicated, then looked up at Jarvis.  “Jay?”
“Not well,” Tony said, scowling down at his phone.  “Which is why, despite my occasional drunken engineering session, I’ve never gone with that hotpants option.”
Tony choked on a laugh, a hand coming up to cover his face, and Steve nodded.  “It’s like that Three Stooges skit where they get stuck in a doorway?  And they’re all flailing desperately to get loose, to go forward or to go back, all the legs and arms waving in the air?” He paused.  “It’s like that.  Except.  It’s just me.”
“Welcome,” DJ said.  When Steve let him go, he settled down between Steve and Tony on the couch.  “Thor?”
The Avenger's shared kitchen was a large, airy space, full of light and with plenty of room to move, cook and eat.  At this hour, it was pretty empty, with only Jan and Natasha at the massive table.  Jan had taken advantage of the extra space to spread out piles of paper, stacks of china and swathes of cloth.  Nat had a tablet in her hand and a bowl of fruit salad balanced on a pile of restaurant menus.
“I couldn't eat another bite,” Steve said, holding up a hand.  “Not if I want to be able to fit in my pants when this week is over.”
Tony stared after her, turning that over in his head.  “Right,” he said, trying to take a sip from his still-empty coffee cup.  He stared down it.  “Right.  We're going to think about that later.  Much later.”
“You’re doing better than I would,” Tony said.  He tossed a Goldfish in the air and caught it in his mouth, the exact way that DJ had, before he’d arrived.  Harris wondered if DJ recognized it, too.  “I’d be in a flat panic.”
“Understandable, sir, but your agreement with DJ was that eight am was an acceptable time for presents.  As such, he has been sitting beside the tree very patiently for the past two hours.”
Natasha set the food on the island next to Steve.  “We found him,” she said.  “Was asleep under the stairs.”
“Which is, I think, everyone other than Steve,” Tony said, bracing his chin on one fist. On the other side of the broad, heavy conference table, Steve didn't respond to that. He had signed where he'd been told to sign, he'd nodded and mumured agreement to anything that was put to him, but other than that, he'd been still and silent. Even now, he seemed only barely aware of what was happening around him.
Steve exhaled on a desperate laugh.  “Yeah, that happens,” he said, and Tony's fingers squeezed his.
Clint grinned.  “Asshole.”  He picked up an empty bowl.  “Which ones did he want, and where’s the food coloring?”
Steve looked up, his eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his brows.  “You knew where he was going, and you knew what he was doing there,” he repeated.  “And when this is all over, and he’s being spoiled rotten by everyone in this building, we’re going to have a very long talk about why he didn’t tell you, and why you didn’t ask.”
“Tony, can you please be serious for just-” the bald man started, and Stark waved a hand in his direction.
“Busier than usual, Mr. Stark,” Reggie said.  “Think someone tipped 'em off that you were coming, otherwise they'd all be home in bed by now.”
Tony leaned in, his hand braced on the seat next to Steve's head, his body arched over Steve's. Steve was staring up at him, his pupils blown wide, his lips parted. His face was flushed, his breathing hard. Tony smiled at him. “So if the only thing keeping you from taking my pants off is the fact that Happy's going to judge you?” He leaned in, his lips just brushing against Steve's. “Might as well take my pants off.”
"Disabled my spacial reasoning parameters," DJ said.  He blinked, slow and careful.  "So I could ram him.  In the leg."  Tony stared at him, not sure how to process that information.  DJ blinked again.  "Tried to break his leg."  He frowned, and bent back over his work.  "Not enough force, didn't break.  But I hurt him." He gave a single, firm nod, a satisfied smile curling his lips.  "It was worth it.  Hurt him.  It was worth it."
“I've got it.  Sorry to leave you to handle the hordes alone.”  Steve took a turn, squinting up at the stoplight.
“Yeah.  Like, the wedding chapels out there.  Yeah, cause I think the only way Tony’s going to get it done is if he just does it, no planning, no guest lists, it’s-”
He slid out of the saddle, glad for the break, as short as it might be.  The street was a narrow little lane of narrow little shops, half of which seemed to be closed already.  He gave one dusty shop window a look.  Or maybe never opened anymore.
Laughing, Tony stroked his hair back from his face.  “Have you looked at yourself?” he asked.  “It's not surprising at all.  So, okay, you love me, and you really love sex-”
“True enough.  And how did you come to be here, my cursed child?” Agatha asked.  She took her nametag from Clint.  ‘Ask me about my gingerbread house.’  She shook her head.  “You have Frigga to thank for your continued health and wellbeing, you know that, do you not?”
"You're the equipment," Jan said to him.  Clint's mouth opened.  Then closed.  His head dipped in a slightly drunken nod, and held out a hand.
“That’s a lot of cheese,” Tony said, leaving the fridge open as he went to the cabinet to retrieve a couple of plates.  “Have a cheese sandwich.  There’s ham, have a ham and cheese, Bruce bought some mustard from his last conference and it’s horrible; I love it.”
Steve jumped, and turned to find Jessica standing just behind him, a plate of mini sliders and raw vegetables in her hand.  He tried to smile.  “Sorry, I-” He reached for his punch glass.  “I don’t know what happened.”
“I can’t believe I missed the bar fight,” Carol said, staring morosely at the ceiling.  “I can’t…” She shook her head.  “It’s just not fair.”
“Right.”  Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and steered him towards the stairs.  “Let's go.  Try not to fall down the stairs.”
“Steve.”  Tony was smiling at him, his expression almost gentle.  “Muscle memory,” he said, his lips barely moving.  “You know what to do.  You know how to do it.  Your body knows.”  His smile stretched, and it was beautiful, it was luminous.  And more than that, better than that, it was kind.  “Your head's getting in your way.”
"Oh, I'm well aware of how you function," Steve said, taking the cup of coffee out of Tony's hand.  Tony made a grab for it, but Steve stepped back, staying safely out of reach.  He sniffed at the cup, his brow wrinkling.  "What is this?"
“You,” Tony said, and Clint was trying to get between him and Agatha and wasn’t having much luck.  Tony ignored him, addressing Agatha, who seemed utterly unconcerned.  “You were there last night!  At the hotel, you-” His eyes went wide.  “I know I saw you, why didn’t I-
Tony's hand came down on his shoulder, shaking Steve out of his thoughts with a jolt.  His head snapped up, and he found Tony staring at him, his face worried.  "Steve?"
“Yes,” Jarvis said.  He reached for the visitor’s chair, dragging it away from the desk and settling down into it, his hands folded in his lap.  “I suspect, however, that you don’t like to admit to it, because it’s easier to be praised for quick thinking and creativity under pressure than it is to be blamed for a precise battleplan not working out to quite your satisfaction.”
When they broke apart, they were both breathing hard.  “You taste like sugar and lemon.  You’ve been raiding the kitchen again,” Tony whispered against Steve’s throat, as Steve took one of the wineglasses from him.  “That one’s mine.”
“Eh, I'm nobody,” he said, licking cream from his thumb.  “Besides, I know where he lives an' we've known each other too long to bother with manners.”  He folded his arms on the opposite side of the counter, keeping an eagle eye on the rest of the pastries.  “Mostly 'cause his couch is more comfortable than my bed.”
"Yep, and we're going to do some more.  You might not need it, but I do." Steve smoothed his hands down Tony's back.  “Upstairs.”
DJ fished around in the sink, coming up with a beaker.  “Washing,” he said, as water dripped down his arm and onto the floor.
There was no response, and for a long moment, he just sat there, rocking DJ back and forth, swaying a bit in his seat, until DJ's grip on his shoulders started to relax.  “Okay, buddy?  We okay?”
Everything hurt, his chest and his throat and his head, and he squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to see the white nothing press in on his vision, didn’t want to see anything, and he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe.
Giving up on his glasses, he kicked his legs free of his blankets, stumbling to his feet.  He squinted out the window, his fingers tangled in the curtain.  From the window, he had a good view of the length of the grounds and gardens, all the way down to the lake.
Rogers took a deep breath.  “He would’ve built his own.  He was well on his way before we even realized what he was doing.”  He pushed his hair back, his fingertips sliding through the strands.  “He knew how to fly, he knew it was possible, there was no taking that back.”
“No, we’re not doing that,” Steve said.  “Help me get this vest off of you or I’m going to rip something.
“Right.”  Steve did his best not to smile.  “So you're okay with being hated, as long as it's for the right reasons.”
Jarvis hovered just over his shoulder, an array of plates balanced in his hands.  "Biscuit, sir?" he asked, offering him the basket.
“Don't even start with me, Stark.”  Steve's arms wrapped around Tony's waist, his fingers tangling in the fabric.  “I spent six months hovering in the background of every party and gathering that happened on that damn street, nursing a drink and watching half the people there try to get your attention.”
Jarvis, standing at the foot of the bed, considered this with a faintly perplexed expression on his face.  “I’ve brought your breakfast,” he said, holding the tray up.  “Your…”  His head tipped to the side.  “Your usual two plates.  As is common.  For you.”
“Could our you do that?” Tony asked, cutting him off.  “Could that be what happened?  An illusion?  So everyone saw him safely with someone else, to give the caster time to get him away from us without a fuss?”
“Tempting, but I've got to, uh, I've got to get these into the kitchen,” Bruce said.  He took off his hat, depositing it gently on DJ's head.  He collected his baskets, shifting their weight with a roll of his shoulder.  “Clint'll want to know what he's got to work with.”
“It was…  A long time ago,” he said.  “But carrying it is habit now.  Even if you can’t get it working again-”
“He's not, but I definitely am,” Tony said.  He glared at her.  “I thought you were supposed to keep aliens off of the surface, Agent Chase.”
Tony nodded, and his hair fell over his forehead.  He reached up and pushed it back, the strands tangling between his fingers.  “Nothing worse than a misbehaving mechanism,” he said, and even though Steve couldn’t see his face, he could hear the smile in his voice.
"Did you know he can blow glass?" Stark asked Steve, who didn't know if he should laugh or throw something directly at his head.  "Do you want some new windows?  He can-"
“Stay,” he whispered, and Steve was an idiot, Steve was a lovesick fool, because he lowered himself down, carefully, cautiously clinging to the very edge of the bed.  Keeping as much distance between them as he could manage.  Tony smiled at him, his eyes fluttering shut.  “Stay.”
He lunged out with one arm, ignoring the stab of pain that shot through his side as he threw his weight against Steve’s, pinning him to the bed.  For an instant, he was sure Steve was going to throw him off and crash out of bed and to the floor.
Steve weighed the box in his hands, his eyes narrowed.  “I could beat you to death with this, you realize that, right?”
Steve started to laugh.  “Yes,” he managed, pressing a hand to his eyes.  “Is that what you’re taking from this?  Really?” His hand flopped to his side, and he grinned up at Tony, laughter bubbling through him.  “Yes.  I gave them to you, or I-” He shook his head.  “I tried.”
Happy twisted around, his head tipping towards the deep scar the arrow had left into the wood of the building.  “Well, let’s just say,” he mused, “you’re usually better off snapping the shaft off, and shovin’ it the rest of the way through.”  He tapped the arrow against the broad expanse of his palm.  “Sure, that’d hurt like hell, but pulling it back out, that just rips you to shreds.”
“I can’t go home,” DJ said, and Tony’s expression went still.  DJ looked at Strange.  “I can’t go home.”
Her head dipped in a nod.  “You do that.” Her cheeks creased when she smiled.  “Good.  Though.  Good to see it again.”
“Promise.”  Tony held out a hand.  “And while we’re fumbling around, desperately trying to figure out our boundaries, wanna get hitched?”
Peter took a deep breath of his own.  “There was this, this guy, and he was drinking a lot and getting on Thor’s nerves, and getting on everyone’s nerves, but everyone was being super polite, and then he started ranting about food trucks and how they were a plague on the culinary scene, and it was like a Reddit post happening in real life, I was like-”
“Let’s get out of here, before reinforcements arrive,” Steve gritted out, not sure how he’d gotten into this situation and even less sure how he was going to get out.
“Shield,” DJ repeated.  One leg swung back and forth, bouncing against the rungs of his stool.  “That’s where.”
Bobbi stepped up, a crown of white daisies and red flowers that Steve couldn't identify in her hands.  “Daisies for loyal love and purity,” she said with a grin.  “Gladiolus for faithfulness and honor.”  She went on her toes, slipping it onto Steve's head.  “Just right for a knight.”
"It's, like, an orange, right?" Jessica said.  A phalanx of nervous looking fashionistas was hovering just out of arm's reach, huddled together like a flock of birds with particularly elaborate plumage.  One, a tall, lanky young man wearing something Steve would've called leiderhosen in another life, took a cautious step forward.  Jessica pointed a wrapped fist at him.  "No," she said.  He retreated.  Quickly.
Okoye was staring at T’Challa, her face expressionless.  He met her eyes, and shrugged.  “She’s very persuasive, and at this point, I am open to any allies I can find.”  He took a seat on the wall, catching the apple Okoye tossed to him with a grin.  “As my own negotiations have found little favor with that party.”
Hammer blinked at him.  “Where am I going to go?” he asked, his voice perplexed, and Steve didn’t bother to answer.
“Yeah, but we have to live with him, so we pretend,” Peter said.  Tony gave him a look, and Peter turned his attention back to his danish.  “Right.  The… The shutting up thing.”
Her eyes came up to meet his.  “And I am quite done with this charade.”  The spoon came up, and it looked like a knife, the edge catching the light.  “Aren’t you?”
Steve was kissing him, and Tony felt like he was drowning, like he was slipping under for the last time.  Steve's tongue coaxed the last of his breath from his lungs, and he sank into it, not caring if he was going to make it back to the surface.
“Right,” Steve said, because otherwise, that was just going to sit there. “Okay. Right. I can-” He frowned down at the ends of his tie. “This is-”
Tony heard himself breathe.  Breathing like he’d been running.  Like his pulse was still accelerating, out of control.  “Bravo for him,” he said, the words tasting like copper in his mouth.  “Where is he now?”
“You never know what'll help until you try it,” Val said.  Her fingers slid through her hair, separating the strands, then twisting them back together.  Apart.  Together.  It was comfortable, familiar, and DJ focused on the way the light slide over her hair, changing the texture with each movement.  “Trying stuff is scary.  But sometimes you have to do it, because if you don't, well, you'll never find something that works.”
Jan looked at Steve, and Steve shrugged.  “I’m not a lesbian,” he said.  It sounded apologetic to his ears.
She was slim and compact, clad in a well tailored blue jacket with a slim, crisp blue and white plaid skirt and matching blue hat perched on her smooth copper curls.  Everything, from the perfectly matched string of pearls around her slim neck, to the spotless white shoes on her feet, was in order, not a wrinkle to the fabric, not a hair out of place.  In the filthy, crowded lobby of the precinct, she stood somehow apart, as exhausted officers and civilians alike gave her a wide berth.
“Speaking of dangerous, where is our guest?” Tony asked, rolling his head back towards Natasha.  “Do I need to call out the dogs?”
“I'll call if we need cocoa, okay?” Clint said to him, and Phil nodded.  “You sure, Jarvis?  He usually wants Steve, times like these.”  He found a pair of sweatpants, neatly folded on top of the clean laundry.  They might've been Phil's.  He decided he was too tired to care, and fumbled his way into them.
"The employees chose the former.  So everyone took a cut in pay, a cut in hours, but everyone held onto their jobs," Miss Potts said.  Her fingertip tapped against the china, the nail clicking against the side, soft and rhythmic.  "StarkIndustries is still producing, with trained, experienced, loyal employees."
“I was always even dumber than I look,” Clint said.  “I just-”  He shook his head.  “I was sick of running.  And I can cook.  Nothing fancy, but breakfast doesn't have to be fancy, does it?” He kicked the range with the side of one foot.  “Took me a bit to figure this thing out.  To find the baking powder and the lard in the pantry.  And Nat hung back for a while.  Just watched me.  Because just because I was going to try this, didn’t mean she had to.
“Looks good,” the teenager said.  He reached out, grabbing Steve's hand and shaking it firmly.  “Glad you came.  Thank you!”  The woman nudged him, whispering something to him, and he nodded.  “Enjoy the photo ops!  We have Instagram filter!”
“And I now I've got a pretty picture, so it seems like that's working out for me,” Jess said, her tone arch.  She gave Carol a smirk. “Don't be jealous.  Once I've got it properly displayed, I'll let you come and look at it.”
He tugged on his ear, making a face.  "He's...  Not here right now," he said, his head tipping to the side.  "But if he pops up during your visit, you'll know."
The man rubbed the back of his neck, leaning back against the stove.  "That so?" he asked.  Natasha nodded as she picked up the kettle, crossing to the massive sink.  His hand flopped back to his side.  "Right then. I'm Clint.  I do the cooking around here, or most of it, anyway."
“I'll have that conversation,” Natasha said.  “Let's go, Hawkeye.  You, too, you arachnid deviant.  Let's get the remains of this mopped up.”
“Oh, thank God,” Tony said, his head falling back.  “You, too?  I mean, I got plastered, but you’re usually much more-”
Jarvis nodded.  “Of course, sir.  I'll depart as soon as you've had your dinner.  And your bath.  And your-”
"We're not certain of that at all," Tony said, waving a hand through the air.  "In fact, we're quite certain that it's a very poor idea, and we're quite certain that we're going to be doing it anyway."
"A solid grounding in the basics is necessary for any real comfort with any sort of dance," Jarvis said, smiling down at DJ.  "We shall start at the beginning."
Steve dropped his bag next to the stoop, holding out his hands.  “Want me to take a quick turn?” he asked.
The elevator came to a stop with a soft ding, and she slipped out, bracing her bag on her hip. "Hey, Celia," she said, pausing halfway to her desk. "Have you seen-"
Steve waited, but Tony's breath went slow and even again.  He huffed out a breath.  “Right.  Guess we're doing this the hard way.”  Before he could think better of this, before he could consider just how stupid this was, Steve leaned over, scooping Tony out of his seat in one smooth motion.
Tony straightened up, climbing to his feet as if it took effort.  “Because the last time I wanted to say things like that, I was dying,” he said, his lips twitching.  One hand came up, fingers brushing against the front of his shirt, over the muted, steady glow of the arc reactor.  “You say stupid things when-”
“Anything to make you stop saying Deathclaw.  Okay.  I’ll finish the calculations.  Just this once.”  Dummy rolled over, leaning his support strut against Tony’s side, and Tony ran an affectionate hand over his head.  “Get off, you’re getting oil all over me.  Go.  Clock’s ticking, gears-for-brains.”
Tony tapped a fingertip against his phone, bringing up the display.  “It’s late.  Or early.”  He scraped a hand over his face.  “Far too early.”  He looked down at his hands, braced on the edge of the workbench.   “We all need some sleep.”
Stark's eyes flicked up towards the ceiling, an eyeroll without any of the effort.  "I don't care," he said, cutting Steve off without a qualm.  "Unless you're planning on selling the plans for my light fixture to my neighbors, I don't see how it really impacts anything that you looked at a stack of paper that I left out in the middle of a room in plain view of anyone who passed by."  He leaned forward, his dusty fingers spread across the surface of the table.  "But honestly, I didn't expect anyone who could actually-"  He stopped.  "You can read these.  Well enough to catch a drafting error."
“More often than is healthy for my state of mind, yeah.” Tony paced back and forth behind Steve, his movements quick and sharp.  Steve glanced back at him, just in time to see Tony run a hand through his already disordered hair.  “He’s talking to his people.  His-” He made a circular gesture with his other hand.  “His contacts.”
As the steward unloaded the tray from the room service cart, Steve cast around the room, trying to remember where his jacket had fallen last night.  He retraced his steps, heading through the bedroom towards the bathroom.  “Tony, have you seen-”
He spread his hands. "They'd prefer to maintain their ignorance. Because it's easier. It's so much easier." His hands fell into his lap. "But the health and safety of a person who needs to be recognized as a human being, worthy of love and respect, trumps your need to not be bothered."
Rogers' lips quirked up.  "My ancestors would be wondering why I haven't blacked your eye yet."  He leaned in.  "And while I appreciate your approval, that wasn't what I was talking about."  He pointed at the door.  "It's bedtime, Mr. Stark."
“It's the unfastened tie,” Steve said. He made another attempt at the damn thing, but his fingers were not obeying him. He gave up, frustrated. He had no desire to go back to the makeup and wardrobe department, but that was starting to look like his only choice. “Can you tie this?” he asked Ellen.
“I have no friends,” Rhodes announced, and Pepper elbowed him hard in the stomach.  He skittered out of reach, laughing as he did.  “It's true, I have-”
“Because that’s what Mr. Stark needed.” Clint tossed an onion in the air and caught it, rolling it around his hand and across his wrist.  “And that’s what he got.”
Steve glanced up from his book.  "Welcome home," he said, and when he smiled, the light caught the lenses of his glasses and Tony gritted his teeth against the urge to say something very obscene.
He shoved a hand through his hair.  “Nothing.  Nothing's wrong.”  He stopped, and turned to look at her, his dark eyes narrowing into bright slits.  “Why do you think something's wrong?” he asked.
“Of course you won't, sir, but for as long as you are here, we need to keep up appearances, and this needs laundering,” Jarvis said, his voice arch.  He looked back.  “A proper dinner jacket is less a sacrifice and more a statement.”
"Is this the last of the corn?" Bobbi asked Bruce, who put an ear of roasted corn, still steaming in its charred husk, onto Steve's plate.  "Did we get another bushel, or-"
Tony was laughing out loud now, his head tipped back, his face relaxed.  Steve braced an arm on the ceiling, smiling down at him, heat and need relaxing into something sweeter.  Something more comfortable and familiar.
“Yeah, but him first,” Bucky said, and Sam just laughed.  Bucky kicked his horse, and shot forward, cantering across the cobblestones for the center of the city.
He leaned forward.  “Did you know,” he said, his voice taking on a secretive tone, “that down in the basement, below all the other parts of the house, there's a workshop.  A secret workshop.  It's where I keep all of my prototypes.  All the machines I'm working on.  All the things I'm building.”
“I’d like to, but-” Happy’s head jerked to the side, doing a quick check before he took a turn at almost full speed.  “Jarvis keeps his opinions to himself, but he’s been grumbling about Stane for a while now, and the man’s a real good judge of character.”
Hank leaned back on his stool, his head tipped back.  “Once.  Just once.  I’d like you to control yourself.”
Bobbi’s foot was tapping a steady, sharp rhythm against the floor.  “Take us off leash, boss,” she said, her voice silken, and Tony paused, one hand hovering just over the wood of the banister.  Bobbi rocked forward, a sharp, aborted gesture.  “Let’s end this.”
“Probably,” Steve said, the word caught in the hollow of Tony’s palm.  “Delicious, though.” His tongue darted out, tasting Tony’s fingers, and then he sucked one into his mouth, meeting Tony’s eyes as he did.
"Right, I got that, but-" Steve shook his head.  "By that logic, if I was named Earl, our portmondeau would be Tea."
She smiled at them, her big dark eyes gleaming.  Tony was pretty sure there was glitter in her eyeshadow, along the long sweep of her lashes.  "You'll both be fine," she said, even as she gave them a critical once over.  They must've passed muster, because she gave a glance at her watch.  "The guests should be-"
“If it were to bring you comfort, I cannot see him objecting,” Jarvis said, just as the door to the elevator opened.  “He worries about you.”
Steve's lips kicked up in a reluctant smile, some of the tension going out of his shoulders.  "You've mentioned that.  Once or twice."
“I wasn’t eager to go back there, to pack up what little we had, to put Peter’s books and clothes and toys in crates yet again.  So we were standing there.”  She paused.  “He hadn’t come to the funeral, of course.   No one expected him to.  A few men from the factory conveyed their sympathies, and that was more than most got, when their husband or father died on the job.
There was a beat of silence.  Ellen squeezed her eyes shut, trying to ignore the way her head was pounding.  It was an impossible task.  “Ellen.”
She stopped, right on the front stoop.  “And Tony slid into the back seat of the car, looked at me, and said, ‘so, how are you with plants?’”
She came to a stop in front of him, her arms crossed over her chest, her chin up, her cheeks flushed.  “I asked one thing of you recently,” she corrected herself.  She leaned in, and Tony leaned back, all the way back.  “I asked you, very politely, not to seduce our guest.”
She leaned in, her face a hard mask as she held Stane’s eyes.  “I can, and I will, kill you.  Nod if you understand.”
The sound of pounding feet coming up the hallway was the only warning he had before the library door exploded open.  “Sir!” Jarvis skidded to a stop, his hand locked on the doorknob.  Rhodey was right behind him, a pistol in one hand and Bruce's satchel in the other.
“Yeah, but you like fixing things, and I find it tedious and boring,” Tony told him.  He pointed at the War Machine armor.  “Show me up.”
“Your corpse would still make a fine distraction,” she said.  “But it’s a short term solution.”  She peered down at Steve and Tony.  “Think we should extract the kid?”
Tony’s eyes flicked over his face, a slight smile curling his lips.  “That’s a very long list, officer, and I’ll be old and gray before you reach the end of it.”
Steve set the basket on the table, glancing over at the stove.  A large stock pot was pushed to the rear of the range, a weight holding the lid in place.  “Why is there soup?” he asked.
“Director.” Rhodey sank into the seat on the other side of Tony.  “I'm not here as a representative of-”
Steve leaned in, slow and cautious, his hands still locked on the back of the couch.  He held Tony’s gaze until the last second, until he could feel Tony’s breath on his lips, until he could swear he could hear Tony’s heart beating.
"Thor.  Consent," Jane said, right before a cloth was draped over her head.  She kept going, her voice barely muffled.  "Body autonomy.  We've been over this."
Sunlight poured through the skylights, warm and golden, lighting the dim corners of the shelves, and spilling over the well-worn wood of the table.  There were books scattered across the surface, thrown open in front of every one of the chairs, stacked high on the floor.
“It seems pleased,” Harris agreed.  “And when I didn’t come back to bed, Darcy came looking for me, and that’s-”  He sighed, and Darcy sighed, too.  He smiled down at her, his expression soft and full of affection.  “Well, here we are.”  He looked up at DJ, some of that affection still bright in his eyes.  “Why are you up?”
Next to him, DJ was curled into himself, balanced on the balls of his feet, his knees against his chest and his arms tucked in tight against his sides.  Steve reached down, smoothing a hand gently over DJ's hair, and DJ looked up.  His face was tense and drawn, his eyes meeting Steve's for only a second before darting away again.
“Never going to happen.  Unlike you, I’ve got my shit together.”  Sam leaned back in his chair.  “Now all we have to do is find you some pants.”
“The staff probably thinks we just set off some sort of explosive device in the middle of their convention,” Darcy shot back as Clint lead the way to the parking garage.  “And I don’t really blame them for thinking that, God, we are not going to be able to go back there, are we?”
She gathered up the papers and started around the table, handing stacks to each of them as she passed.  “I have chosen assignments well within your abilities and your-”  She paused behind Clint’s chair, and he grinned up at her. “Attention span,” she said, handing it over.
“I’ll stop by Sam’s truck on our way across the road and see if he’s up for a drink, but I don’t need you setting up playdates, thank you,” Tony said. “Besides, any benefit that we might get from Sam’s presence will be immediately negated if Bucky’s hanging around looking for leftovers.”  He braced a hand on the counter.  “Add Bucky to the mix and we might as well hire a PR firm right now.”
“Oh, well, that’s Darcy’s trash, anyway,” Harris said, and this time, the smile felt a lot better on his face.  “She’s got an emergency box of Lucky Charms squirreled away somewhere, because I refuse to put that in my closet with the real food.”  He leaned back against the couch.  “Someday, someone’s going to try to rob this place and they’ll find a box of breakfast ‘cereal’ taped to the ceiling of my closet or something, and think that’s where the drugs are.”
“Oh, will I?” Rhodes pushed himself forward, striding across the kitchen to collect the books that she held out to him.  He gave Steve a smile.  “I guess I will.”
“I choose to think that it was the local variation on the Oval Office,” Tony said.  “You make a good King slash president.”  He stopped short, his eyes going wide.  “We should-”
"Don't-" she started, but he was already scrambling in through the window, landing on Hammer's chair with enough force to send it spinning, and from there, launching himself across the desk and towards the closet.  Pepper watched, stunned, as he hopped up, one foot landing on the doorknob and using it to propel himself upwards.  His fingers closed on the transom window above the closet door and before the office door could even start to open, he wiggled through the gap and out of sight.
