Dean stared after Sam until the door slammed before turning back to Crowley, ignoring 'Steve',
"Uh, I'm Dean, me and Cas got.. together last night properly. My mom died when I was about 6, my dad raised me and my little brother. When I was in high school his response to any guy who was too feminine was to beat the crap outta him, so that's exactly what I did to. He died back in 06 in a car accident. I met Cas 3 years later, almost to date, he helped me rough a lot of crap over the past few years, and if my dad were here now and he knew me and him were together now he'd probably beat the crap outta Cas and then out of me too,"
Cas cut Dean off. “Sam, say those interpretations again, slowly,” he instructed.
“Why?” was all she could manage. The woman stepped forward again, grabbing her by the arm this time so she couldn’t escape.
When the pain subsided, Dean opened his eyes to see a pair of concerned blue eyes. “Dean! Are you okay?” Cas asked, the worry clear in his voice. Dean nodded, noting that now the pain had passed it was as if it hadn’t happened. “We’ve got 8 hours.” Cas told him, indicating Dean’s arm. Dean pushed himself to sit and pulled his arm into view. Indeed there was a timer, much the same as the one on Abby’s arm from the pictures. The digits wrote themselves in loopy cursive script for each count, like an invisible quill looping over his forearm over and over. Dean thumped the threadbare carpet.
"Uh, the fact I, uh, screwed Anna on the back seat, like, angel Anna." Dean said,
"You were right about the asshole bit." He laughed, before bringing a hand around the back of Deans head and pulling him down for a punishing kiss that was all clashing teeth, and sharp tongues.
Rubbing his head ruefully, Dean pulled out from under the trunk. Yrsa stood leaning against the car, wearing a tight leather bodice and layers of skirts, her dark hair fanning out in a mane around her head. When the street lamps caught her eyes they were almost golden. She looked every bit of the Celtic warrior she was.
"I'm going to admit it here."Dean said looking back up at Cas, "I've never done anything with a guy, other than kissing some kid in my grade in a game of spin the bottle when I was 16. So, I have no idea whether of not I'll be any good at this, all I know is what I know from porn." He confessed. Cas raised and eyebrow at Dean,
"Uh, not exactly." James frowned,
"I suppose you corrupt me, Winchester." He pecked Dean on the lips, "Made me a bad little angel," he pressed his lips to Deans for a few seconds, "Made me your obedient little soldier." He kissed Dean again, letting his teeth tug at Deans bottom lip as he pulled away, "Made me yours." He finished, pulling Dean to him once again.
, Dean thought to himself.
"I can talk to him alone if you want. Me and Cas can handle Gabriel. I'm sure Cassie will be overjoyed to see his brother." Dean said, sounding like it was a grim prospect.
Cas frowned again,
"James tells me you've just realised you like guys, and your dads a massive homophobe. How quaint." He added sarcastically,
He left the motel and jumped into his car, not minding so much that a seagull had crapped on the back window in his haste.
“The bottom rune is still not lit; we must be missing something.”
"Not here at least, I feel exposed. Like those women are going to come running back in and try and poke me with a stick or something for appearing out of thin air." He said, his face unsure.
"Gabriel..." He stuttered.
He ran through the list in his head again. He knew the runes flickered when he ran through the names of his parents, Sam, Cas, Bobby, Jody, Ellen, anyone he cared about. There was the barest flicker when he mentioned anything about any of them dying or getting hurt, which worried him. From what Dean had seen of Yrsa’s ‘entertainment’, she was sadistic and unpredictable, and there was a chance that she intended on him doing someone he cared about harm. If she knew anything about him, she should know he’d rather die than do anything like that.
“Why not? It’s what your papa does, isn’t it?” She questioned, mocking in a matter-of-fact tone. Cas spluttered.
Pain. White hot, burning, searing pain gripped Will as he collapsed in a heap on the grass. His leg was on fire. No, worse, his leg was melting, it must be. This was how he imagined being burned with acid would feel, like his skin was dripping off in painful sluices. His eyes wouldn’t focus, tears freely streaming down his face, but even they felt like they were burning. Blindly his hands gripped at his knee, not daring to hold any closer, squeezing, hoping he could somehow hold the fire back, as if it would travel up his veins and spread like a disease through his body if he didn’t.
Dean stood, and approached Cas. It had to be him. Now that he was right in front of him, Dean realised that it couldn’t have been anyone else. Cas looked at him, his frustration morphing into confusion.
Cas moved to strike the witch, but without looking, she deflected him. In one motion, Yrsa released Sam, who had begun turning a violent purple, and rounded on Cas, another incantation forming on her lips. Without thinking, Dean moved, throwing himself between the witch and angel, swinging an arm that caught her on the jaw. Without missing a beat, she caught his retreating arm, and swung him so his back was flush against her, bending him backwards so she could still see over his shoulder. Sam had struggled to his feet, breath ragged, while Cas stood, eyes wild and angry, knife still poised to swing.
"The couple were two men. As you'd expect of a couple, they kissed, and then were thrown out by the bartender for it." Cas continued,
Castiel was standing leant against the wall, his lips moist and obviously just kissed, looking very serious.
"Maybe later, yeah?" He said turning around slowly. Sam ran a hand over his face, his expression pained,
"That's not true, Dean I probably walk faster than you, so therefore technically if I were to hold your hand and walk fast you would walk to same speed as me, which is in fact faster than yours." Cas cocked his head, he just knew that Dean was telling the truth, it wasn't even his angel-ness that told him, maybe it was just the fact he'd known Dean for 3 years and he understood him better than most, excluding maybe Sam, but that was still debatable.
"I was being hunted by a few things, a pack of vamps, a real Trickster, a couple of my snooty type brothers, there were a lot of people who wanted my blood. And if they found out I had a thing with someone, a Winchester for that matter, they'd use him to get to me. I was protecting your precious little brother." Behind Gabriel, the door quietly opened, and Sam slipped in the room, not announcing himself. It might have been a trick of the light, Dean thought to himself, but Gabriel's face softened, when he realised who'd entered the room. "I suppose you expect me to grovel, and beg you to forgive me?" He said not turning round, but obviously not talking to Dean or Cas anymore.
Simon stopped his car as close to the entrance as possible, and grabbed the carrier bag off the passenger seat and flung himself out of the car, not bothering to shut the door. He took off at a sprint to the main desk, pushing past families and young couples who were queuing politely at the kiosk. He inserted himself into the queue right behind the family who was currently paying for their tickets. Simon wrenched up his sleeve, oblivious to the tuts and stares being directed at him.
Dean hated witches. They were unpredictable, vindictive, and conniving. Yrsa might’ve been the worst he’d met, but he also had to admire her daring. She’d forced him to admit to himself something he hadn’t realised he’d been burying. Now it was plainly and painfully obvious that he had feelings for Cas, and had for years. Any one-night-stands he’d had over the past few years had left him feeling empty and dejected in a way they hadn’t when he was younger, and now he realised why.
having the luckiest day of your life .” She spoke low and dangerous.
Cas finished chalking the sigil on the table, at the same time that Dean finished drawing the angel trap on the floor. Castiel had seemed unsurprised by the news that his brother was still possibly alive, and causing havoc.
"You know me, I piss people off, and they hold grudges. I didn't want you to get caught in my mess."
Dean had kissed many women, he'd began to see it as a sort of speciality of his, and he enjoyed the softness of a woman's lips, the shape, the warmth of her tongue as they entangled. Kissing Cas was different, his lips were dry, cracked, like he'd been licking them repeatedly on a cold day, the shape was unfamiliar, strangely rounded, his tongue inexperienced so it was tentative in its movement. But in that instance Dean would've taken no other kiss. To him Cas' lips were perfect, they matched Dean's, his saliva making them feel full against his own, when he breathed in a little through his mouth, Cas tasted of whiskey and the smell of pine trees. Dean slowly brought his other hand and rested it on his angels cheek, Cas' hands pulled gently on Deans hips, gripping a little tighter than he should, occasionally trailing his fingers up and down Dean's back and ribs.
Sam was sat on one of the wheely chairs from the control room, in the hallway, while Cas and Dean were setting up the spell in a spare room. When everything was ready, Dean swung out of the room to tell Sam they were about to do it.
"Thanks for today," Dean muttered, "that James was an asshole, but the other guy, Will, he was cool, he wasn't an asshole. It really did help Cas, thanks." He brought his hand down to rest on Cas' cheek, he ran his thumb across the angels cheek bone,
Abby considered for a second. “No. Who is she? Why did she make me do this!?” she said between sniffles.
"Eww! I do not want to know! You can be Steve, you can't make the name Steve weird!" He stopped in front of the first door in the corridor of store rooms, "You can stay in here, I'll bring you food and a blanket. Anything else you want... other than a chemical castration?" He opened the door and guided the man-car in. The Impala looked around the room,
"- the hell?" he asked, Cas instead angled for Dean's neck, biting and sucking at the place where Dean's jaw met his neck, he stopped when Dean winced.
Dean was about the mention the mark on his shoulder when the first episode of pain hit, radiating from his shoulder and all over his body. With the fire licking at his skin, he was in Hell again. He could almost smell the flesh burning off his skin again, so lost in the pain of the memory. And then as suddenly as it arrived, it disappeared. Dean was surprised to see he was still crouching by the table, though his iron grip on the table top was perhaps the only thing keeping him upright.
"I brought you a burger as a peace offering?" Dean said after a few seconds, holding out the plate. Cas turned back to face the ceiling, "Come on Cassie, its your favourite, the one with the barbecue sauce?" He waved the plate as if to waft the smell toward him. Cas' hand unfolded and beckoned, without looking from the same spot on the ceiling. Dean rolled his eyes and walked across the room to put the plate in the angels hand.
“You need to go. My parents might find it weird that I’ve let three grown men in the house.” She almost laughed. They all stood up, and she led them to the door. “I hope you get her,” she told them as they walked out the door.
"You are mine. I need you. I want you. Saw the whores touching you-"
"I can tell that Cas doesn't like him, cos he didn't notice that this guy reeks. He smells like angels," he rolled his eyes, and looked as though he regretted his chose of words, when 'Steve' blew him a kiss at the sound of 'smells like angels' " I meant, he smells like the residue angels leave behind when they do magic, like summoning and shit." 'Steve' fished one of the bars of chocolate from his pocket, and unwrapped it as Crowley spoke. "Got a thing for chocolate and sweets has he?" Sam nodded, "So he smells like angel magic and candy bars..." He paused looking expectantly at the brothers, "Join the dots dumbo's... He smells like sweets, he likes eating sweets, he also smells like angels... What do angles and sweets have in common...?" Dean continued to look blank, Sam looked like he was slowly coming to a conclusion, but not quick enough for the demon, "Christ, it's like I have to spoon feed you, which specific angel, enjoyed sweets and candy, and loved pissing people, especially you two off...?" Sam gasped,
"So you want to be inside him, still?" He asked teasingly, Dean rolled his eyes,
"Look, there was a reason I spent a couple of hundred years hiding as a Trickster, I draw to much attention. I piss people off too quick, too easy. And I was getting to big for my boots. When I decided to help you and Sam, it was because I needed an excuse to check out. Me and Lucy were having a chat and I double bluffed him. I projected behind him, and in front, so he got distracted by the one behind, and the one in front could look like he was creeping up to stab him, when in reality neither were really me. I wasn't in the room. Lucy stabs the projection, that I maintained till he left, and I let you dumbasses think I was dead, so I could drop off the map. It was easier than the alternative, okay?" He explained. Dean raised an eyebrow,
"There's a box of chocolate in the store room at the far end of the corridor." Dean told him sounding guilty, "My secret stash." He admitted. Sam rolled his eyes,
“You didn’t make it easy; the hints I had to give you, Gods! But I love watching uptight men do feelings,” she laughed mockingly. “It’s like watching a monkey try to find a mate.” She paused to look Dean up and down. “Besides, I’d heard the rumors about you and the angel. Every supernatural being on this continent knows about the two of you dancing around each other like school children.” She rolled her eyes, a knowing look on her face, “I wasn’t sure until you threw yourself in front of him though, that was a nice touch, very heroic. Especially as I was this close,” she held up her fingers very close together, “to squeezing the life out of your dear brother.”
“We worked it out,” Dean tried to explain. “Who can’t I live without.” Cas looked even more confused, “I thought it was Sam, but it’s you. Of course it’s you,” he said softly.
As they'd left the bar Cas had slipped a hand into Deans, Dean smiled sheepishly and left it there, which led them to the dark street they were currently walking. Occasionally, Dean would look at Cas, smile and then start swinging their arms singing a carnival tune and jumping along until he got out of breath.
Dean flashed a look a Sam, who was better at dealing with crying women; Cas was so uncomfortable he looked pained. Sam stood up, unsure of how to comfort her. He pulled another tissue from the box and held it out to her until she took it, awkwardly patting her shoulder, flashing a look as Dean as if to say ‘what the hell do I do?’
Outside, where the Impala usually sat, was a blonde guy dressed in leather perched in the gravel looking marginally confused. He looked up at Dean,
"Call me what ever you wanna, muscles." He winked, Sam shuddered and stood up,
"Just let it go." Dean told him, speeding up still. Cas' breath was heavy and quick, his hand, which was still clasped on Dean's shoulder, squeezed harder until there was no doubt that there'd be fingertip-shaped bruises there in the morning. With a low scream he reached climax, white seed spurted out of the head of his cock, landing on the plush white carpet and a little on Dean's chest.
Cas and Dean walked hand and hand, down the dark street, there was no one around and the final traces of whiskey were fading from the back of Dean throat. To celebrate the consummation of their relationship Dean had decided to treat himself and Cas to a few drink at the local bar.
They had tried everything, exhausted every contact they could collectively pool between the three of them and Bobby, searched through the pages of Google where no one dared stray. They’d thrown out every suggestion of what that particular combination of runic interpretation could possibly mean, just shouting pointlessly into the air; a few times the runes had flickered for barely a second, like they were trying to give them hints, but nothing stuck. They were working off of the blind hope that the sigil would tell them if they said the right one. It had worked so far, right?
"So?" Dean said, keeping in step,
” He thought to himself, running to the next. Orangutan’s. “
"How the fuck did he get in? I locked the door and I'm the one with the key." Ashlyn asked, sounding really pissy. Bunny, Halo and Sherry began backing toward the door,
"Sammy," Dean clapped a hand on Sam's knee, "I already think you're crazy, now I find out you've stuck it in my boyfriends little brother, you're bonkers." He pulled a stupid face and made a weird noise. Sam let out a small laugh, "and from all the 'I knew its' when me and Cas got together, you already knew I wasn't the straightest of guys for about 2 years, what makes you think I'd have a problem with you being a little gay, when you've know I'm probably a little gay all this time?"
“Will Chaplin,” Cas confirmed.

He dug his tablet from his bag that he'd shoved in here when they'd got back the night before, and switched it on, squinting until he turned down the brightness. He pulled up the Casa Erotica video, and watched it with the sound on mute. Gabriel's eyes looked sad, like he was really talking about being dead. Sam kicked his bag angrily, dropping his tablet on top and hanging his head in his hands.
"I'm not, it's... cold. I want to get back to the motel, Sam will be pissed that we didn't do any research and we didn't make the bed after we were finished." Dean kept his pace, shoving his hands in his pocket, subconsciously he flicked a look at the group behind them before ploughing on,
"Oh Dean, are you flirting with me dear?" James asked sarcastically,
Cas' knees gave way, as he sunk onto the carpet, slowly releasing his grip on Dean.
"G-Gabe, I can handle myself. You didn't need to fake your death, and leave me alone." Gabriel stepped forward, "You think I did it lightly? I'm not saying you couldn't deal with it, I just didn't want you to. I make the mess, I clean it up. Except I couldn't so I bailed." Sam opened his mouth to reply, but Dean cut across him,
Dean unlocked the store room door and ushered 'Steve' in,
"I guess." He said before beginning to rub Cas' clothed member. The angel shivered. Apprehensively, Dean pulled down Cas' (his) boxers, letting his semi spring free. "I'm going to go all out and admit it, this is the most scared I've ever felt." He said his eyes fixated on the member in from of him, Cas tutted,
"Maybe they were both looking for a reason to talk to such a good looking guy." Dean smirked,
"You are really fricking lucky there are so many people here, asshole." He said, his smile dripping with venom. Will slapped his boyfriend on the stomach,
“Nobody recognizes it; it must be her own design,” he announced.
Dean and Cas looked at each other and made some sort of silent agreement.
"Bit weird is he? No wonder spending all his time with you." Crowley laughed at Dean's expense. 'Steve' sauntered forward and leant across the table, pushing his butt in the air and wiggling it a little, he ran a finger across Crowley's cheek bones,
"Better go get some then." he sighed. Dean walked quicker in front of Sam.
“So, it’s gonna be a witch, brilliant.” Dean groaned. “I hate witches, man.” Sam rolled his eyes, but otherwise ignored him, going back to pouring over the grainy pictures taken from the video. “How did Bobby even get the video?” Dean asked after an irritating lapse of silence.
Nothing else mattered; his gaze was honed on the glass, barely able to even see the monkeys that were his goal. Because of this he barely noticed the three security guards as they tackled him to the ground.
"Whoops, sorry Dean." He apologised. Dean smirked,
And then he was kissing Cas.
"You can have a bottle of beer, and nothing else, Dean'll kill me if I give you some of his pie." He said backing out of the room, and closing the door, turning the key to lock him in and slipping the key into his pocket as he walked toward the kitchen.
"Oh honey, you've known me a loooong time." He breathed in and then pushed out a deep humming noise from the back of his throat, it sounded like the hum of a car engine. Dean stepped back further looking confused.
Dean downed the rest of his pint and stood up, returning his glass back to the bar and then went down the stairs to the private rooms and let himself into Room 3. He hung his jacket on the coat hanger that was stood next to the door and then sat on the red leather couch, sprawling his arms and legs across the length and waited for the woman to arrive.
"What the hell man?" Dean shouted. Bunny and Sherry looked wildly around the room, Halo and Ashlyn broke apart staring at the two men.
.” Will took a deep breath and held it, screwed his eyes shut as tightly as he could, and pressed his leg against the white-hot metal of the barbeque.
As they rounded a corner, hands locked between them, Dean still breathless from jumping, the pair noticed a group of rowdy teenagers on the other side of the road. Dean sucked in a breath and dropped Cas' hand, and then continued walking a little bit faster as if he'd suddenly remembered he was late for something. Confusedly Cas hurried to catch up,
“What do you mean ‘the kinds of people’?” she asked, looking back at Sam.
I wanted to add a little note here to kind of explain the epilogue and how downbeat it is hahha
“I have a problem, Abby,” she started the moment Abby caught her eye. “I’m so very bored.” Abby frowned; she didn’t recognize this woman; how did she know her name? Every instinct in her told her to run as the woman stepped closer, within touching range, “Everyone in this town is
“Make the right choice for-” he paused and the light dimmed to a dull glow, barely visible.
"Yes?" Dean asked bluntly his hand still restring on Cas' thigh,
“We’ve got nothing. No clues. She said we’d work it out, but I don’t know how,” Sam replied, having managed to pull himself back up to the chair, his voice hoarse.
“Whatever it is your thinking, keep going.” Sam’s low voice barely pierced the bubble. “The last rune is starting to glow.”
A small cough pulled them apart. Ashlyn was perched on a chair, her drape ruffled as if she'd moved it a lot, and she was biting her lip.
"Do you regret what we did in its place?" He asked,
"We tend not to keep our friends chained up in the dungeon." Steve jumped, clapping,
"I'm Will," he said offering his hand to Dean and Cas,
“Someone’s gotta go talk to him,” Sam agreed.
“Those flashes of pain, with memories from when I was in the pit,” Dean spat, a sudden surge of anger rising within him. He’d spent a long time running from those memories, had finally reached a point where he felt like he could stop running from that particular period of his life, and she’d dredged it all back up. Her smile was almost sad this time. Almost.
"B-ba-baby?" He stuttered, "I don't even know you? How would I call you Baby if I didn't know you?" He spluttered,
"I suppose so," he said, "I just don't want to cock up." He told him,
“Entertainment.” Abby frowned again. “Your diary. Yes, I know you write a diary, I know your name, shut up.” The woman preemptively answered the questions in Abby’s head. “Go home, open your laptop, broadcast live. Read your diary to the world.” Abby managed to take a step back, her head spinning.
When Dean was steady on his feet, Cas stepped back, and took his hand again, looser this time as if he was waiting for Dean to hold it back, Dean look down at their hands and then back up as Cas face, he leant in and kissed him on the cheek before slipping his hand away,
“You can’t just use humans as your toys.” Cas ground out; Dean could see that he was seething. Yrsa laughed again.
Sam smiled wearily. “No real damage,” he rasped in response. Dean sat on the end of the bed; Cas took the chair at the table.
"You really dislike him that much in the 10 minutes we were gone?" He asked almost laughing,
"Mine." He stated, before kissing Cas passionately.
"I supposed we could wait a while?" Dean suggested, Cas hummed in agreement moving to stand beside Dean.
“So, there’s at least one other victim.” Dean said as they settled in the car,
"And this person, anyone we know?" Dean prompted, realising where Sam was going with it, and trying to hide the surprise in his voice.
"That red headed chick a few years back, what was her name, Milton, Anna Milton. She was hot, glad you cleaned the seats after. /And/ all that messing around with the angel when your brother thinks you're buying groceries, bad boy." He winked. Dean shuddered,
"Didn't want to, not going to." Gabriel muttered, he smiled "especially not when your arse has gotten so great." His hands slipped from Sam's shirt and cupped his butt cheeks, hell, even here he has muscle, Gabriel found himself thinking.
"Dean," he said his eye full of reproach, "who is he?" He asked, Dean shook his head,
” She rolled her eyes again, and conjured an armchair in the centre of the room, between the bed and the table, and settled herself.
“Promise.” Sam responded, giving his most reassuring smile. Abby’s eyes flicked to the clock on the wall behind the boys.
Cas sat forward. “What did she whisper? Can you remember any of it?” he asked, speaking for the first time since they arrived.
“Sh.” Cas had shushed him? Cas was looking to Sam with intense eyes. Sam’s brow furrowed.
"Shall we start again?" He said turning back to Dean, "Hi, my name is Will, I am with James here, and I have been for about 2 years, when I came out to my parents 3 years ago, as bisexual, they kicked me out, and I haven't spoken to them since, apart from one phone call, when my mother told me she could get me help in her local church, and I heard my dad in the background shouting if he saw me again he'd beat the queer right out of me. I know at least a little how you feel, so try not to act like a complete spaz when you tell me about your little gay story." Dean swallowed and looked unsure, and felt a little bad that he'd snapped at Will and called him a dick,
’ was written in the same cursive font just under the timer, which now read
"Well this is boring." He said for probably the hundredth time, Cas didn't even bother to look up, Sam sighed,
"I'll do it." He said squeezing Cas' hand and opening his eyes, he smiled nervously.
Yrsa’s face broke into a maniacal grin, and without warning she gripped him by the throat. Despite her tiny stature, she lifted him clear off the ground,
It was cold, raining, lonely and boring in the motel. Sam was working a different job on the other side of the state, and Cas was God knows where, literally. Dean had nothing to do, he'd eaten all the food in the fridge, he'd read the only porn magazine the motel store sold, he's watched a few porn videos on Sam's laptop, and deleted the internet history, and he'd played chess with himself four times, and lost all four times. He sat in the end of the bed staring blindly into the darkness of the room; he'd forgotten to switch on a light. He was just about to decide to just sleep for the night, when an advertisement caught his eye on the back of the porn magazine he'd tossed on the floor.
"It's what I call the car sometimes." Dean rubbed the back of his head, a little embarrassed, "And he's spent so much time around me... as a car, that the asshole in me has rubbed off, and now he's trying to piss me off and make you jealous." Cas didn't say anything, and continued to work through his burger. Dean slid down so he was laying on his side, and put a hand on Cas' thigh, looking up at him, "Seriously Cas, I don't want anyone else. Especially as that guy was a car less than an hour ago. All I want is you." Cas put the last few bites of his burger on the plate, and put it on the bedside table. He looked down at Dean,
” Dean told him softly, “It’s always been you.”
"Not in front of big groups of people... Not yet." He said in a low voice, Cas smirked sadly,
Nervously, she tapped the screen a few times and began printing the ticket. Simon fumbled with his wallet, throwing $30 in the tray, and snatching the ticket from her hand before she could drop it on the counter. Then he was through the barrier and searching frantically for a map or a sign that directed him to the monkey enclosures. Eventually seeing a signpost pointing left, he followed every sign until he came to a gate that read Monkeyland above it. Sighing, he pushed through the gate, and skidded to a stop in front of the first enclosure: Chimpanzee’s. “
"Uh, one of the store rooms." Sam said standing up, "He kept asking for sweets, reckon we should give him some in return for keeping his mouth shut?" He asked as they began to walk down the stairs to the store rooms.
"We were kinda busy." Cas added.
"Last night, my brother set us on some work, because we all work together, and me and Cas got talking about feelings, and stuff we'd talked about before, and one thing led to another, and before we knew it it was 1am and Cas had just lost his butt-virginity." Cas looked disgruntled, Dean grinned at him, squeezing his hand again. "Before last night neither of us had been... with a guy, so yeah... That's our 'little gay story.'" Will smiled,
The third rune was the inverse of the second. “Sorrow.” It, too, glowed.
"YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND CAS!" Dean stopped abruptly. "You wouldn't understand, okay?" He repeated, in a quieter voice. Cas looked taken aback,
"Can't we just put him in a room and lock the door? And then just never let him out again?" He asked trying to feign and innocent, angelic voice, Dean smirked,
“I think Yrsa wants us to get health insurance,” he joked halfheartedly. Sam read the headline and frowned.
"Wait for what," a familiar voice came from behind them. Dean whipped around, his hand instinctively reaching back to clasp Cas's hand. Gabriel was leant against the closed door, arms crossed, eyebrows raised. "Because the party's already here." He winked, and then laughed. Walking forward, "Afternoon, what was it? Sweetcheeks?" He grinned at Dean, "and Cassie, bro!" His eyes honed in on their joined hands, "Me and Sam had a bet on, how long has this been a thing? Can we lie and pretend it's been 2 years? Then Sam owes me 20$. Speaking of, where is dear Sam?" He spun around in a circle. Dean cleared his throat,
"Steve, come out. We've gotta take you to see Crowley." The car skipped out,
Sam looked up. “That explains why I can’t find it,” he replied. Bringing the laptop and scrap of paper with the runes written on across the room with him, Sam perched next to Dean on the bed. “But I’ve got the other three. The vertical cross could mean a few things, namely, gifts and personal relationships.” Cas twitched where he was still crouched next to Dean, but otherwise said nothing. “The one that looks like the letter ‘p’ - the most popular interpretations are joy, comfort, and fellowship.” Cas audibly gasped, jerking Dean’s shoulder back into his eye line.
"Where'd you lock him?" He asked,
.” He moved to the next: Capuchin’s. “
“Well, I guess it works,” he concluded, Sam nodded his agreement. “What do I do now?”
"I don't have to stay if you think it will cause a problem." He said, Dean slipped his hand into Cas',
“23 minutes,” he whispered to himself, heart rate jumping up a notch. He tapped his foot impatiently. “Come on, come on, come on.”
"My dad /was/ a massive homophobe, he died a few years ago, you sarcastic little dick." Will looked at Cas smirking,
"Last week a couple were on a date in the pub on that corner where everyone is standing,"
"So how much am I paying for the company of you beautiful ladies?" he asked cheekily,
They pulled up outside her house, and watched for a second, making sure there were no cars in the driveway.
"You're a lot shorter than I though you were, sweetcheeks." He said when he stopped in front of Dean leaving barely any space between them,
"Oh yay, you have a dungeon, are you taking me to the dungeon? Sam, are you going to chain me up, babe?" He said with a wink. Sam closed his eyes, shuddered, and continued down the hallway not replying.
“My shoulder,” Dean ground out, gesturing to the one closest to Cas. The pain had gone, but the tension of such an aggressively triggered memory was taking longer to ebb away.
"I'm being serious, he knows things that I didn't even tell you, that happened in the car." Sam shook his head,
“Don’t fash ,” she told him, waving a dismissive hand. “You were very good at the end there. The middle got a bit boring, though. You were so close, and yet so far. But that kiss at the end,” she squeezed her fists at him in excitement, “urgh, like something out of a soap opera!” She kissed her fingers. “
As Sam spoke, a burning feeling ran up the inside of Dean’s arm. He steeled himself for a second, and then slowly turned it so he could see what had changed.
“What else did she say?” Sam encouraged.
"Really?! That's your only comment?" He sighed, and then slid out of the wardrobe, pulling on of his backpacks out with him, that had some of the summoning ingredients in it. "Let's do this, I suppose."
I really hope you enjoyed reading this, as always, comments and validation that this wasn't awful are greatly appreciated xo
Sam left the room he moment he worked out who Crowley had been hinting at. Running his hands through his hair, and down his face, he made for his bedroom. Without turning on the light he walked across the room and climbed into his huge wardrobe, pulling the door shut behind him. When he was a kid he'd hide in the cupboard or wardrobe when Dean shouted at him, or his dad was shouting at Dean because he'd been drinking. Now he was grown, or over grown as Dean frequently teased, he didn't have much need for hiding and sulking in wardrobes, but there was some ingrained comfort in being sat in a wardrobe that smells like you, surrounded by your own stuff when he was sad that had brought him back here now.
"Fine, go to the shop, you're on beer run." Dean shut the book quickly, dug in his pocket for the keys to the Impala, and almost ran to grab his jacket from the table.
"Shut up, Ashlyn." Dean told her. She huffed.
And then, once again, as quickly as it started, it stopped. Dean found himself curled in the fetal position on the bed; a few tears had escaped his eyes. His breathing was heavy for a few seconds, and though his eyes were open he could almost see the shadows of Hell writhing around the room. His chest was tight, and there was a ringing in his ears. Dean focused on his breathing - this had happened before, though not for a few years - after a few seconds he managed to even out his breaths. Hastily he wiped his face and sat up.
.” She paused for a few seconds, “Why did she do it?” Abby asked finally.
"So do you believe me now?" Dean asked, back-handing the 'car' again,
"-the fuck are you? Where the fuck is my car?" He spat when he'd gotten over the initial shock of instead of finding his car, finding a fairly attractive man with a voice that made him want to melt. The guy sniggered,
"I s'pose, there's not much choice if he knows that much about it, and that must have happened a few years ago too, and I doubt you'd be able to keep him your little gay-secret for that long. But how?" Sam asked,
“Yeah,” Dean said, “So what’s so impressive?”
Slowly, Dean began to unzip Cas' trousers, and working his hand under the flaps, gently rubbing in circular motions across the entire bulge.
"Dean, it's fine. Just go and do it will you." He shoved him.
“But you were gonna kill the others - you told them you would,” Dean retorted.
"I can poke you with a better stick," Dean winked and pretended to flirt, "But that was kind of stupid of you, appearing in a room with people in, who would defiantly notice you." Cas frowned,
"Are all English people nosey and confusing, and really polite?" He asked with a smirk, Cas took Dean other hand and stepped a little closer,
Cas leaned forward. “Your shirt is burnt,” he observed. Dean grit his teeth and pulled the shirt taut so the skin was visible underneath.
"- the hell?" He asked, raising an eyebrow, at the same time as Crowley muttered, "Must run in the family." smirking.
"Promise?" Sam pushed. Gabriel gripped Sam's face and pulled them so they were nose to nose, staring each other in the eye. Gabriel had always revelled in the colours of Sam's eyes, they were blue in all but the centre which was a strange brown colour. Gabriel's eyes on the other hand were the exact colour of the sun in the autumn, gold and warm.
"I've gotta try and talk to Cas, seeing as my car upset him." He glared at the Impala, before walking off toward the kitchen, not waiting for Sam's reply.
"Its fine, no, it's okay. You can do what you're thinking." The angel back tracked a little. Dean leant in and kissed Cas' neck and jaw line, the angel sighed contently. Gently, near the base of Cas' neck where the neck meets the shoulder, Dean bit down and sucked a little, until he knew it would bruise. Cas flinched at the unexpected shoot of pain, but then relaxed when he realised what Dean was doing, he'd heard enough talk to know vaguely what a love-bite was. Dean kissed the mark and pulled away.
Simon could feel the hair on the back of his neck again, as he collapsed against the glass, a high-pitched yelp coming from his throat. He could taste blood this time. The moment the pain passed he swung again, and again, and again, kept swinging even though he was barely chipping the glass, desperation ricocheting through him. He dropped the hammer and begun throwing himself against the glass over and over, not caring about the bruises he could feel forming across his body.
"Why? What is that?" He asked. Cas started walking again,
“Can I help you?” she asked quietly.
"Dude, you went after Cas well over half and hour ago. What were you doing in there?" Sam told them sounding irritated. Dean rubbed the back of his head,
Dean barked a laugh. “And I’m just supposed to take your word for it?” he demanded, hand tightening around the handle of his knife. Yrsa narrowed her eyes, and stood up straight. Where she had been casual, almost friendly before, she now exuded intimidation and power.
Blurred eyes caught a sudden movement in front of him; Will blinked a few times trying to clear his vision. A pair of knee-high leather boots stood barely a meter in front of him. Tensing for the flash of pain he knew he would burn through him, he rolled on his back, staring up at the person the boots belonged to. Of course it was her. The woman. And she was beaming at him, but the look in her eyes wasn’t kind. She crouched down next to him, the smile growing when he flinched away.
“Thanks Cas, just ruin this case, just a little more,” Dean groaned again.
Dean assessed her quickly. She was short, well-dressed, and like Abby had described, she had a beautiful face, except her dark eyes, which danced with an angry fire. Her accent was faintly European. It wasn’t often the monsters they hunted showed up for a social call, this was unfamiliar territory. She tutted, walked across the room, and held her hand out to Sam. “Yrsa.”
Abby left work later than usual. She didn’t often work late shifts - her parents didn’t like her coming home late, especially on a school night - but there had been no one else to cover the shift, and Wednesday nights were normally quiet. Between serving the handful of tables passing in and out of the diner, she’d done her homework while sitting at the counter, and she’d played tennis with balled up receipt paper and menus against the chef through the serving hatch. It had been a good shift, and she was walking the ten minutes home with a smile when she was approached by a woman. Taking her in, she saw that she wasn’t much taller than Abby, had thick, curl dark hair that fell to her shoulders, and a face you’d mistake for a kind one was it not for the cruel glint in her eyes. She smiled, and a feeling of being doused in icy water ran down Abby’s spine,
. You had me worried for a minute there, didn’t think you were going to connect all the dots. I thought I was
"Yes, hello, still in the room." Ashlyn butted in,
"Baby?" He asked, as if to enquire why the man-car was calling himself a lovers pet name,
“Like when she smiled, she didn’t look happy, she looked scary,” Abby told him. “And she knew my name - I’m sure I’ve never met her before, but she knew my name, and she knew I keep a diary. And she said I had to read it live online, and that she’d know if I missed bits out, like she knew there were things I didn’t want people to hear.” Tears were collecting at the corners of her eyes now. Cas passed her a box of tissues from the end table next to him, and she dabbed her eyes and wiped her nose.
"To protect me, you say?" He asked. Gabriel swung his arms,
“We’re not going to just let you leave,” he told her. Yrsa looked him up and down, and smirked, slowly walking towards him.
"Well that answered none of my questions... And stop calling my darling. Again where the fuck is my car?" The guy stood up and sashayed over to Dean, in typical nightclub manner he circled Dean looking him up and down,
A small patch of precum stained the underwear, where the head of Cas' cock rested, Dean pressed a kiss to the straining material. Castiel whimpered quietly.
Dean could do about it.
"I'll sit in the next room, if I can I'll come in. If not I can still hear what he says." Sam decided. Dean pushed to his feet,
Dean started the engine. “Me and Cas will talk to him, and you should probably see if any other weird crap’s happened in this town recently,” he suggested. Sam nodded. “What do you reckon this witch’s game is? There’s nothing to gain from making a girl humiliate herself, except maybe some kinda sick enjoyment. Either of you heard of a witch who’s a bitch just because she can be?” Both shook their heads. “Fantastic,” he said as he drove back to the motel.
“Will you really?” she asked, sounding almost hopeful.
Dean hooked a finger under Cas' chin and pulled his head up so he could, gently this time, press his lips to his angels.
Thinking about it now, he’d die for both of them - he’d jumped in front of loaded guns and raised knives for them - but he’d lived without Sam. Every time Dean and Cas had been apart, Dean had done everything he could to get back to him. Every betrayal had felt personal because it put distance between them, and he’d forgiven the guy for every transgression, just as Cas had done for him.
“Bor-ing.” And then he blacked out.
"Fuck, I've missed you." He breathed finally. Gabriel winked and bowed his head,
Finally, he huffed. “Thought so, that bottom one isn’t Celtic.”
Dean pulled away, and nudged for Cas to sit up; he stood up and pulled Cas up with him, then went over and took Ashlyn's hand and brought her over.
. Will knew what was coming; he tensed as the white-hot pain gripped his insides once again. This episode lasted longer than every episode prior; they’d started at half hour intervals, but as the timer ticked closer and closer to
"Stole a pair of my boxers?" he asked smirking,
They’d gone around in circles, frustrations rising higher and higher. Dean found himself honestly debating pulling his gun and putting a bullet through his knee to make a point. Or maybe Yrsa’s end game was that he was to die to prove this ridiculous notion.
"Dont patronise me Dean. How did he get in?" she demanded.
"Okay, what's brought this on?" Dean asked, surprisingly not at all freaked out or pissed off.
"Grumpy git this one?" He asked smirking, Sam rolled his eyes,
“Dean?” Cas questioned, a frown creasing his brow.
Gabriel began slipping his hands away from Sam's face, all of a sudden looking uncertain, panic clouded Sam's eyes as he quickly grabbed the angels hands and put them back on his cheeks, holding them still and closing his eyes. When he opened them finally, his eyes were swimming, he squeezed Gabriel's hands tighter, as if he was frightened if he let go then Gabe would disappear,
"Halo." The red haired girl said,
“Who are you?” Abby whispered, knowing it was probably the most irrelevant question, but she was frozen with fear. There was something about this woman that didn’t feel right.
"Sorry Dean, I couldn't help myself," he held out his hand, "Truce?" He asked, Dean shook the hand, and pulled the taller man close,
“Great, so what the hell does that mean.” Dean broke the triumphant silence. They all stepped apart, returning to their previous seats.
“Show them? What the hell is that supposed to mean!?” he all but yelled. “What is with this chick?” Dean was raging now, his panic only adding to his agitation. The timer was ticking closer and closer to
Dean slipped his hand more comfortably into Cas'. They walked back the way they had come before, and stopped when they reached the back alley again. Dean backed Cas up against the wall, and pressed his lips to the angels suddenly desperate and greedy, he rested his hands on the wall on either side of Cas' head, Cas' hands came up to grip the sides of Deans head, not even bothering to trace patterns now, just trying to pull his hunter closer as though he was worried that if he let go Dean would disappear.
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you, so why don't you follow the other pretty ladies and leave?" Dean told her.
Sam and Cas were staring at him, not in surprise so much as helplessness. The pain hadn’t lasted long enough for them to react, but it wasn’t like there was anything they could’ve done, as this was the pattern of Yrsa’s
in his chest. That feeling in the pit of his stomach had returned. Maybe it was the unknown territory. Maybe because he didn’t know what it was like to actually lose him. Every time he’d been without him before, the hurt had barely registered before Cas had returned, or Dean had refused to believe he was gone, fighting tooth and nail to get him back.
, and here was yet another dumb cryptic clue that led them nowhere. How do you show someone you can’t live with out them, without doing something stupid like jumping in front of a loaded gun for them? Hadn’t Dean taken a bullet for Sam enough times? Metaphorically and physically. What the hell did he need to do? Propose? Shoot himself in the foot to show he was serious?
"We don't need to ask Crowley anything. He'll just make things more awkward, he'll want payment or something stupid. And I doubt he'll even tell you anything properly." Cas interjected. Dean shook his head,
"You're the nerd, you're supposed to do all the book work." He whined, Sam sighed again,
"So you bring a guy home with the lame excuse that its your car?" He asked, his voice making it clear that he didn't believe his brothers story. Cas sighed, closed his book, got up and left the room, in the direction of his and Deans bedroom. Dean stared after him for a few seconds before turning back to his brother,
Halo followed Dean's line of sight to a very cute looking Ashlyn, she looked at Dean and smirked before climbing off. She walked close to Ashlyn and circled her waist when her arms, and then met her lips to Ashlyn's holding her close, Ashlyn doing the same. Bunny and Sherry looked at the two women in front of them kissing and met each others eyes smirking; they leant over Dean and began kissing to. Dean leant back smiling; he adjusted his jeans so that his semi was more comfortable.
Any of this tickle your willy?
"Again, -the hell?" Dean said rubbing the bite mark,
"You call me Baby a lot." He told the hunter. Deans eyebrows raised sharply,
Dean closed his eyes tight, and then slid his hand into Cas', interrupting the pattern he was tracing across Deans palm.
"I couldn't watch while they had you and I didn't, okay." He huffed, blowing air into Dean face, who blew back, who blew back, and vice versa until they were giggling like little kids.
"Bit gay," a voice came from the edge of the crowd, James slipped toward them, Will in tow, "Jesus, why would you kiss another guy here?" He was smirking. Dean looked at him wishing very much he could pull his gun,
"Oh ignore her, Dean." Cas told him, "I came here for a reason." He turned Dean's face back to face him and pulled him in for a kiss again. This time Dean was expecting it and pulled away,
"Gabe." Sam told him, "it was a thing for about 6 months. He'd text me, it'd tell him where we were and he'd come and we'd go out somewhere, or y'know stay in, if you were out or working another case." He wrung his hands, "I really... enjoyed his company." He coughed. Dean laughed,
, the intervals got shorter and shorter, and the pain lasted longer each time.
"Dean, do you feel threatened by the group of teenagers?" He probed further, not believing the hunters excuse,
“Thank you Will,” she breathed. “That, was
“Carry on, I think I know what the answer is,” Sam said, not moving a muscle, his eyes still zeroed just over Dean’s shoulder.
After a few minutes of make-up kissing, Dean pulled away sighing,
"This is the-" he was interrupted by the Impala pushing past,
He went to look Sam. He wasn't in the control room, kitchen, TV room, Library or any of the store rooms, and the door log showed it hadn't been opened in an hour, so he was still inside. Dean paused as he checked in Sam's room, he remembered to back when they were kids. Sam would be running round in circles, or repeatedly asking where dad was, or making sandwiches using all the food in the refrigerator and Dean would finally snap at him, and Sam would cry and run into their room, and climb into the wardrobe, and stay in there until Dean climbed in to and cheered him up, or apologised. Sometimes Dean would leave him in there for an hour or so and he'd find Sam curled up in one of Deans oversized jackets, sleeping.
“Like I said, you uptight macho men repress all your feelings, Shakespeare couldn’t write a tragi-comedy as good as watching you lot dance around your feelings for each other, being upset that nothing can fill the void, not realising that the answer is right in front of you because it’s not wearing in the right
Abby was fully crying now. “She grabbed me and whispered something in my ear that I didn’t understand, and my arm burned, and when she let go it felt like my whole body was on fire and then she was gone.”
"Braid under instead of over, makes for a tighter braid." He said sarcastically, "when you 'have sleepovers and braid Sammy's hair'" he mimicked Deans voice when he was met with blank faces, he sighed, "I'm assuming its Cheekbones your problem's with." Dean nodded,
"Some of the people here today are straight, this isn't about being gay, or straight or out and proud or anything you're scared of, it's about trying to make sure people don't grow up being scared of loving who they want to love. If you do this, you don't have to do it as us two, being gay, you can do it as 2 straight guys fighting homophobes like your dad might have been." Cas told him, brushing the back of Dean's hand with his callus fingertips.
“It worked!” he exclaimed. Swept up in his elation, he threw himself back at Cas, pulling him into another enthusiastic kiss, and only breaking apart when Sam decided that sitting on the side of the bath waiting from them to be done was not the way he wanted to spend his morning.
Strippers, Pole Dancers and Luscious ladies?
"Idiot, don't make it harder for him, I know you had it easy, but they were having a moment you arrogant shitbag." James held his hands up in surrender,
“Yeah, I guess.” Dean tried to play it down.
Dean kicked the back tire of the Impala.
“Because I said so, because I’m bored, because I think it’ll be funny.” When she squeezed Abby’s arm, the spot where her thumb dug in began to burn as the woman leant forward and whispered in Abby’s ear in a language Abby didn’t recognize. A prickly burn ran from the woman’s thumb to the tips of Abby’s fingers, “Don’t leave anything out. I’ll know if you do. Oh, and you’ve got a deadline. It would be best for your general… aliveness if you didn’t miss it.”
Nothing. Dean threw his arms up in exasperation.
"I'd like to see him try," Cas muttered, him and Dean laughed quietly,
The way this fic turned out kind of ended up being a full episode, and in an episode you have a kind of false ending where the climax of the episode happens, demon gets ganked, bones get burned, and it's a 'nice' moment, the episode could always end there on a high note. But it never does, theres always the bit at the end where Sam and Dean have an argument, or someone gets a mysterious call, that brings the episode back to the rest of the storyline. That's what my epilogue is, you could definitely finish the story at the end of chapter 2, and have a nice mushy ending, or you can finish the story, and its a bit more depressing, but its whole... and also gives me and excuse to write more for Yrsa if I wanted to, because I love her hahahahha
They dressed and exited the strip club quickly. One of the girls, Bunny was on the stage, and ogled at the two men as they left, both their hair ruffled and standing up on end.
"You could've asked before borrowing my magazine, make sure you put it back in the right place." He glanced up at Sam who looked /very/ into his book, he dropped his voice even lower so it was a murmur in Cas' ear, "And you know I'm way bigger than that guy." Cas blushed and closed the book, which one of Deans few /gay/ porn magazines was slotted into. He pecked Cas on the cheek smirking, across the table Sam shuddered. Dean laughed and left.
“She said someone made her do it,” Sam responded, not looking up from the pages of print-outs he’d brought with him.
Sam walked to stand behind him, so he could see the sigil properly.
"What's it supposed to prove, except that you're a soppy idiot?" Dean asked, turning his hand over, so Cas' fingertips could ghost across his palm.
"You're my car? How are you my car?" He asked,
"Sorry, I know it's rude of me, but I couldn't help eavesdrop. I'm James, by the way." Dean shook his hand uncertainly, James offered his hand to Cas, who also shook it uncertainly.  "So," he turned back to Dean, "you just come out?" Dean looked confused,
"We are getting rid of him as quickly as possible. Also, I am not sitting in your car until you get seat covers. I know more about your sex life than I ever wanted to. And he kept asking me if I miss sex. Like I'm a horny teenager. I think he was trying to flirt." Sam shuddered, "Can we please just get rid of him? Like soon?" Dean raised an eyebrow at him,
"Obviously not dumbass," he leant to the side, to make eye contact with Cas, "Seriously, how do you live with this guy?" He asked.
"So you're putting the problem down to the fact I haven't had much time to socialise? I hardly think that is fair, I may not have spent the past hundred millennia on earth amongst humans, but I spent much of it observing. I understand more than you'd think." Cas argued, a little offended at the fact Dean deemed him socially inept. Dean rubbed the back of his head looking uneasy.
"Who the fuck are you?" Dean asked as he stepped back, the guy smirked,
Dean smirked teasingly, "Didn't last long did ya?" he said wiping his finger up is chest and putting it in his mouth, sampling Cas. He gagged and wiped his tongue with his other hand. "I am never giving you or anyone else a blowjob." Cas laughed and laid back onto the floor, drained. Dean rolled his eyes and laid down next to the angel, resting his head on his shoulder and smiling happily.
"Before this goes any further, you explain." Dean told the angel. Cas sighed again, this time a little less grumpy and demanding, more disliking the necessity of having to talk over kissing Dean.
“She said she was bored, that everyone in this town was boring, except for Will, and that she wanted me to entertain her. I think she meant Will Chaplin; he works at the bank. He badly burnt his leg on a barbeque last week. I think he’s still in hospital, said some lady blackmailed him into it. Most people think he’s lying because he was doing it for a dare or something stupid like that, but I believe him.”
"No, I could kill them all if I wanted to. I just want to get back." He said bluntly,
“My parents are trying to get a transfer at work, or find new jobs near my aunts in Colorado. I can’t stay here. They think someone from school bullied me into doing it, that I’m just too scared to tell them who…
"Dont have to be rude about it." She said rubbing her arm where Dean had grabbed her,
"We could still walk together fast whilst holding hands. I don't understand why you needed to let go if you just want to get home faster." Cas asked still confused.
“Wh-” Dean went to question again.
Behind his eyelids, Hell played on loop, every awful memory, every damning choice he’d made down there, flickering like a ‘Best Moments’ reel on a game show.
When Cas had taken the plate Dean slid onto the bed, and put his legs up, knocking his shoes off in the process; Cas liked pristine white sheets, and got annoyed if Dean put his dirty shoes on the bed. Cas slid up into a sitting position, still not looking at Dean.
"He never left, he just doesn't want to be naked anymore." He told Dean.
Dean looked over at Cas, who was pouting grumpily at the fact he was standing in the middle of the room, bereaved of half his clothing and not being kissed. Dean laughed at him, and sauntered over to the angel, he stood in front of him, running his hands along the waist band of his own underwear.
Sam had put Dean and Cas in charge or researching the effects of voodoo on children, Cas had decided to be all deep and meaningful, and they'd ended up abandoning the research and talking about emotions and feelings and other alike things. Before the conversation they'd been in a state of sort-of-togetherness, but they hadn't made anything official, because they just weren't sure if it was he right thing to do. The conversation had let to sex, and then in a lust filled sleepy embrace, they'd decided that a relationship seemed right.
“So, what, you played matchmaker for an
“Yeah, but why is it our gig? Girl gets bullied into reading her own diary, it’s sad, but why is that our problem?” Dean had been looking forward to a weekend off; he and Sam had agreed to silence their phones and spend the weekend doing nothing but drinking and relaxing. Plus, Cas had just arrived; Dean had talked him into watching both parts of Kill Bill, and they were settling in to start the first film when Sam’s phone vibrated. He let it ring out the first time, but after the second time he got up to answer, much to Dean’s chagrin. Somehow Bobby had sold Sam on the case, and Dean found himself in the driver’s seat speeding down the highway, before he even had chance to ask where they were going.
“That was… unexpected,” Cas commented finally with a soft smile. Dean laughed softly and smirked, pulling away a little, to run his hand over his face in mute embarrassment.
Dean settled back in his seat, trying to work out why a witch might get off on humiliating a teenage girl. He was glad Cas had come along - witches could be hard to track down and tricky minxes to trap, and the extra angel muscle would come in handy. Plus it was nice to hunt with him every once in a while.
“Speaking of, where do you get off on making me make out with Cas!? That’s easy compared to what you made the kid do,” Dean asked, curious now. She clearly wasn’t here to finish him off, only to goad him; he could put a knife in her chest after he understood her motivations. For precautions sake though, he kept his hand around the handle, not caring that it was obvious he was poised to attack. Somehow, he knew she’d be disappointed if he didn’t remain on guard.
"Up until today I'd never kissed anybody. Now I've kissed a you and a woman. And I'm about to have you suck my penis. So it's a first for the both of us. I have nothing to compare you to, so you can't be worse nor better than anything I have experienced." Dean smiled,
"Fuck you, seriously." He breathed out hard, "just, fuck you." And then he leant down, not letting go of Gabriel's hands just letting them drop between them, and pressed a bruising kiss to the angels dumbfound lips. It took Gabriel a second or two to catch up and respond. He turned he left hand around and weaved his fingers between Sam's, with the other hand he tangled it in Sam's hair, pulling him down harder, immediately seizing control. Using his now free hand, Sam anchor it around Gabriel's neck, his forefinger and thumb skimming the hair at the nape of his neck whilst pulling the angel forward, simultaneously knocking himself backward so they were pressed up against each other against the wall. Gabriel pushed his leg between Sam's pushing against he taller mans crotch, as he pulled him down further, wanting more. Sam shook his hand free of Gabriel's and wrapped both hands round his waist, marvelling at how familiar it felt. Taking advantage of his now free hand, Gabriel pulled at Sam's shirt, slipping his hand in and skimming it along the muscles, that's were even prominent in Sam's back,
"But on a serious note," Dean said when he'd calmed down, "If you want to have me, you can." Cas pulled Dean into a hug, nuzzling his neck,
“We don’t know exactly. Most witches have a purpose, like revenge, or getting more power. But we’re going to find her and stop her doing it to someone else.”  Sam tried to reassure her. A small smiled formed on Abby’s face, though the tears that were still streaming down her face.
"But what made you come back now? Nothing has changed." He asked. Gabriel reach up slowly until his hand was cupping Sam's cheek, upon contact Sam closed his eyes and breathed in, his face relaxing in the angel's hand.
"You're so impatient, I'm getting to it." Cas smiled and rolled his eyes at the hunter, "As you'd expect, that upset a lot of people, mostly... gay people, some straight people, so in protest they've all assembled here, as a massive, as you'd say, 'screw you' to the pub owners."
"Sure. You can stay there, until we have something for you to help with." Dean said to her. She nodded, biting her little finger.
“And here’s another potential victim.” Sam spun his laptop to face Dean. “Simon Barrett took a hammer to the zoo last weekend and tried to break into a capuchin enclosure in broad daylight. He’s now under psych-eval, because he insists a ‘beautiful woman’ forced him to do it.”
Dean rolled his shoulders in agitation; it was just his luck that out of the three of them the witch had decided to curse him. And of course, it was a sadistic bitch that wanted to watch them dance around in a hot panic for a while first. He rolled his aching shoulder again and lay back on the bed, dropping the printed-out images from webpages Sam had shoved at him. He cupped his shoulder and rolled it a few more times, trying to lessen the ache. It was only when he began kneading it that he realized that rather than his shirt under his middle finger he could feel puckered skin.
"Bunny." The brown haired girl breathed,
"It- nothing. Anyway, we've gotta get rid of him, me and Cas have some business that needs attending to." Sam shuddered again,
"Thank you," Sam I the rejected before Dean could be snarky again, "We've got a problem we think you might be able to help with." He told the demon,
"Nope, why don't you go ask him yourself?" Crowley suggested, the same knowing smirk on his face. Dean sighed and left the room, calling 'Steve' after him. 'Steve' winked at Crowley before skipping out of the room.
Brain scrambled by the collision with the concrete, Simon struggled against the men.
We find out who has been causing all the trouble (:
"I needed a new pair, my old ones got singed in a fire. Plus I knew how much you like these ones, so I just had to wear them." Cas told him, smirking back. Dean gripped the sides of Cas' head and jerked him forward roughly, pulling him into a hard passionate kiss.
Behind them the sound of rushing air could be heard for a few seconds, before Dean's head was pulled backward and a warm, soft pair of lips were pressed to his own. Closing his eyes, Dean's own tongue snaked into the mysterious person's mouth, tasting the surface, stroking the person's tongue. The person gripped Dean's head, pulling him closer, angling his face to delve deeper. Dean inhaled, the mysterious person smelt familiar, he opened his eyes, and the person was wearing a shirt and tie and had stubble. Dean pulled away quickly, turning abruptly on his seat, knocking the kissing women in front of him.
"I promise." Dean whispered, before pressing his lips to Cas'. "Besides, blondes don't really do it for me, always preferred women with darker hair, same goes for guys I guess." He said as they pulled apart. Cas rolled his eyes and sighed, but he smiled too,
“Dean, you’ve found it.” He ran his finger lightly over the skin. “Sam.” Sam rounded the table to inspect the sigil.
going to have to kill you. How would that have looked!?”
Unbeknownst to Will, the sigil on the back of his bicep flashed as he readied himself, tried unsuccessfully to even out his breathing, as if that would make what he was about to do any easier, any less painful. He raised his bare leg above the grill, the heat biting at his flesh even now. “
He opened the cupboard in the kitchen and found Cas' stash of microwave burgers he seemed to like, and shoved one in for 4 minutes, hoping if he made the angel his favourite food it'd cheer him up a little. While he waited he put his face in his hands, trying to work out what he was going to say to Cas, 'I can't exactly tell him about the car knowing about Anna, she's was sister and his commanding officer, he'd be so pissed.' He thought to himself. 'But it was also years ago, and its probably the only way I can prove to him that he's the car and not a secret boyfriend or prostitute I just found outside.' He counter argued himself. 'What if I just tell him he's the car, and see what he says, if he's really pissed, I'll just try and talk him round, but if the burger makes him less pissy, I'll tell him about the car knowing about Anna.' He finally decided as the microwave pinged. He took the burger out of its wrapping and put it on a little plate, then left the kitchen for his and Cas' room.
“You good?” Dean asked him, taking Cas’s offered hand and hauling himself to his feet.
"The bruises your hands have left on my shoulder are pretty conclusive that you and me have gotten freaky." Cas peaked over Dean shoulder at the pinking marks he'd left,
"The alternative?" He pushed.
Cas worked his hands up Dean's shirt, stroking over his stomach muscle, running his fingers over each of his protruding rubs, sliding over his nipples, until they were hard as bullets. Dean groaned a little into Cas' mouth, running his hand down the curve of Cas' spine, cupping his butt.
"Hey, asshole, I'm not hot headed." Dean interjected, James rolled his eyes as if he'd heard Will say it a hundred times. Will ignored Dean,
“So what have we got?” Confident in Sam’s assessment, Dean brought the matter back around.
"Yeah, sorry." Ashlyn said, "It's just that guy, Castiel? said if I wanted to stay I had to do what I'm told. And you two are... beyond hot. So I'll stay, if that's alright."
"James, you literally left us about a minute ago, and it already sounds like you've pissed this guy off, what did you say?" He was around the same height as James and was almost the exact opposite in looks, he had dark hair, almost as dark eyes, he wore a white shirt with cream trousers and white canvas shoes,
“Joy, comfort, and fellowship,” he read, pausing for a second between each word. A familiar smile turned up the corners of Cas’s mouth.
“Oh yeah, them I lied to.” She smirked. “Why on earth would I go to the trouble of killing any of you? I was in Salem, y’know; I know how easily humans get spooked. And the attention it would bring, Gods no, I don’t need that, its bad for my skin and bad for business. I'll admit I may have gotten a little brazen looking for entertainment three times in one town, but what’s life without a bit of risk.” She winked. “They just needed more motivation; their jobs were harder than yours.”
“Hear you wanted a chat.” Dean bashed his head on the hood of the trunk as Yrsa’s voice startled him. Once they were sure the curse had been lifted, the three men had slept in shifts, expecting Yrsa to make another appearance. Clearly, she wanted to speak to Dean alone, because she’d waited for him to do a food run before approaching.
Comments are greatly appreciated (and give me the validation I so greatly need right now) xo
"Well I don't know do I? I s'pose we'll have to see what Sam and Cas think of it- you." He shook his head and turned to head back into the bunker, "Come on then." He called over his shoulder.
Finally, the family pushed through the barrier and it was his turn. He jumped forward to the window, not bothering with polite greetings.
"And..." Dean commented trying to hurry the angel up, Cas looked Dean in the eye as if to say, 'shut up'.
"Right I can tell this is going to end in some weird kissing that I don't need to see, so I'm just gonna ask now. My car? Can you sort the shit you did with my car?" Without turning around Gabriel replied,
“These are definitely Celtic runes, but beyond that, I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” Cas looked dejected for a second. “I’m sure there are databases with interpretations on the internet,” he suggested. Sam tapped his laptop back to life and began a search.
Boobs, bums and dirty talk?
"I'm right here darlin'" he said. Dean raised an eyebrow,
“Well, we’re all out of razzle-dazzle, so why don’t you just turn into a bat and fly back to wherever you came from, or whatever it is you do.” Dean suggested. Sometimes asking nicely worked. Not often though.
"Why don't you call me freaky, cos I bet I'm a real freak in bed, especially after all the moves I've learnt watching Dean and Castiel get freaky in the back, and front seats, and on the bonnet once or twice." Sam sped up,
"Depends," Cas looked up at Dean through his eyelashes, "Is it working?" He asked, Dean laughed and rolled over so he was standing up next to Cas,
"Like what?"
“You can’t just threaten people into doing what you want,” Dean tried to argue Cas’s point. Yrsa fixed him with a glare that made Dean sweat.
“Give me one ticket,” he barked at the teenager behind the plexiglass. She blinked at him. “Come on, I haven’t got time!” He thumped the counter. The hair on the back of his neck rose as another tidal wave of pain washed through him, like a hand squeezing each organ in turn, and for a second his legs went slack and he had to grip the counter to hold himself up. Once it passed, he straightened up, not looking at the people behind him who must be staring at him with equal parts terror and concern. “Hurry up!” he demanded of the ticket attendant.
“Witches that practice Celtic magic tend to be old; I expect she’ll be quite powerful.” Cas piped up from the back seat.
entertaining.” She reached and slowly ran her index finger down the side of his face and neck. The moment her cold finger made contact with his skin, the pain in his leg intensified. Will didn’t think it could have gotten worse, but somehow he was now nothing but fire. Every part of his body could feel the pain radiating from the lines seared into his calf, the smell of burnt flesh swelled in the air, scorching  his nostrils. Just before he blacked out, a prickling burn ran up his right arm, and then there was nothing.
"I know how hard it can be." He reached in his pocket, and dug out a crumpled card, "It's my business card, because I run a self-defence training school, but its got my mobile number on, tell him if he wants to talk, he can call me." Cas took it and smiled,
Dean looked Cas in the eye, slipping his hand round the back of the angels head, entangling his fingers in his dark hair, he slowly pulled him closer, his eyes drifting shut as their lips met.
"One of 'the whores' is still in the room, is finding this slightly hot and still really wants to know how Mr Bitey got in here." Ashlyn broke the tension slightly as well as causing a little more of her own. Castiel sighed,
"You know what I said about you not being able to keep 'Steve' as your gay-secret for 4 years?" He began, Dean hummed in agreement, "Well I managed it for 3 years with another person..." He trailed off.
"If you don't want to be naked here, let's get you dressed and make you naked elsewhere, like the motel." Dean suggested.
Will steadied himself on the chair; the uneven grass in his garden was making it hard to stand straight. He could feel her watching, and although he couldn’t see her, the hairs on the back of his neck were raised as if an omnipresent pair of eyes were boring into his back. He raised his right arm, shaking the sleeve back:
Sam sifted through the sheets of paper on the table. “The only thing I can think of,” he said pulling a sheet from the pile, “is this.” It was the picture of the sigil from Abby’s video. Dean pulled up his sleeve. His own upper arm was bare, and the three of them sighed. “I suppose we could try and work out Abby’s sigil and see where that gets us?” Sam suggested. He passed the picture to Cas, “Anything you recognize?” he asked.
If not Sam, then Cas.
, they’re unbelievably dull.”
"What do you want me to call you? And I swear to God, I am not calling you Baby." The Impala smirked,
“It is, Celtic I think, but I’m not well versed in Celtic magic,” he agreed.
"Nope, let's go sunshine." He said slapping Cas' leg and walking out of the room, Cas rolled over and jumped out of the bed, walking quickly to catch up with Dean,
Dean flushed guiltily. “You took us by surprise. I barely had time to react,” he mumbled, embarrassed and ashamed by the realisation that he had indeed been slow to react to Sam’s attack.
“Hey, I got something.” Sam’s voice finally broke the silence that had stretched between them all as they’d been engrossed in their research. He spun the laptop so Dean and Cas could see the screen. “This site has a directory of all the possible meanings for runes, all of Abby’s are on there.” Dean crouched in front of the screen, momentarily forgetting about the puckered skin on his shoulder. Sam pointed to each rune on turn. “The line could be, among other things, deceit, betrayal, illusions. The wonky cross: distress, need, restlessness. The 8 shape: ending, completion, hopelessness. And the last one: hidden danger, taboo, warning. They all kinda fit what Yrsa made Abby do.”
"Did you two get a little freaaaaakyy?" He joked, knowing he couldn't judge or disagree his brothers choice in men, seeing as Gabe was Cas's brother. Sam put his head up to raise an eyebrow, letting it fall back when Dean smirked and shrugged,
By the time Sam had unlocked the store room door Dean had returned with hands and pockets full of bars of chocolate. Sam took a deep breath and opened the door,
Dean stood up and picked up the magazine, making note of the address on the back of his hand, he pulled his wallet out of his back pocket to check he had enough to get in and some extra money to buy a drink, or 4 and possibly a lap dance. $50 was more than enough.
"Oi! I can hear you." Crowley shouted from his chair, "who ever you are anyway. How comes he just shows up and he's allowed to walk around when you just met, but we've been buddies for years, and you keep me chained up in a demon circle! Can't say that's fair. And another thing-"
He knocked on the door, "Cas?" He called in a low voice. No answer. He knocked again, and called a little louder. Still no answer. Dean sighed, and pushed in anyway. Cas was laying on Deans side of the bed, straight as a board, arms crossed over his chest, poker faced, staring at the ceiling. Dean leant against the door frame, and stared at Cas until the angel turned his head to look back.
Sam shrugged, "I don't know. I just thought you wouldn't like it. And then after he... died, I didn't think there was any point in mentioning it." He took a deep breath, "but now it looks like he's back, maybe he was never gone, which makes me want to hate him. We've gotta summon him, and get him to get rid of 'Steve'. I've got to see him..." His voice trailed off,
“The sigil kinda pulsed when I looked at this dumbass ad.” Dean turned it back around, and read the slogan aloud in a mocking voice. “‘Make the right choice for someone you can’t live without, so you don’t-’”
“Why?” he asked.
” He reached into the bag and pulled out the hammer he’d brought. Not giving himself time to think now, ignoring the people around him, he swung it against the glass.
"Can I carry on distracting you when we've sorted out your car?" He called as they entered the control room, a few steps behind Dean. Dean smiled and ignored him walking toward Sam who was sitting on the table with his head in his hands. He looked up at his brother when he heard them walking in,
"Where did the confident Cassie go?" he teased. Cas bitch-faced at Dean and then pecked him on the lips,
“I know it sounds crazy, but we can explain,” Dean interjected. She looked Dean up and down, and then Cas, before looking back at Sam again; she closed the door, unlocked the deadbolt, and opened the door fully. She swept her hand out to invite them in.
"I want all of you and I don't want to share." He told Dean, he pulled out of the hug, "I want to be able to tell people that you're mine." He looked Dean dead in the eye,
"I've decided, I don't like sharing." He said smiling sweetly. She took the money and huffed,
Other than deep frown lines across his forehead, Sam hadn’t reacted, which Dean appreciated. He hadn’t told Sam or Cas about the Hell aspect of this torture, since they were worried enough about the intense amount of pain he was clearly in each time, and he didn’t need to put a voice to the atrocities he’d committed in the past.
“We think she’s a witch, someone who can do real magic. And sometimes those people are just bad people.” Sam tried to explain as he pulled the folded-up picture of the sigil from his pocket. “This mark on your arm is a sign of her magic.” Abby frowned, subconsciously rubbing her arm, “What happened after she left?”
“Beautiful? I’m touched!” came a voice from the motel door. “And I wouldn’t say forced, more so asked very nicely.” Three pairs of eyes turned to her. “Don’t get up on my account,” she added sarcastically.
“Cas just texted, he’ll be back soon,” Sam told him. Dean nodded, crossing back to the table, and tried to shake the feeling like there was a black hole in his stomach sucking his soul back to the pit.
Dean paid his $10 to the freckled teenager at the entry booth and climbed the stairs into the main stage area and bar. He made his way straight to the bar and ordered a straight whiskey, downing it in two gulps, and ordering a pint of beer successively.
“I, uh, y’know, couldn’t live with,” cough, “myself if you… died,” he added, hoping clarification was necessary.
"What's your problem?" He asked, "just get a new car. Keep him?" He suggested. Dean rubbed the back if his head,
“She’s just a sadistic bitch,” Dean reported, throwing his jacket on the bed and himself into the chair opposite Sam at the tiny table in their motel room. Cas sat on the end of Dean’s bed. “She told the guy that she was bored and he should barbeque himself just to make her happy.”
"Why have I got to do it? He's your car!" Sam whined,
Sam raised his laptop again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Perhaps, when he was less seething, and maybe a little drunk, after he’d talked to Cas properly about what exactly they were to each other, maybe he’d look back and laugh.
"Well, now that's settled, can you get out of the closet." He laughed loudly, Sam leant forward so his face could be seen,
"Flowers," he used an old nickname he used to call Sam when he was trying to cheer him up before, "You need protecting from yourself. Self-destruction ain't pretty when you've got family and friends who get left behind. Let's just say, you need more Sam time, okay Cheesepuff?" Sam snorted at the nickname, final a proper smile appeared on his face,
The woman rolled her eyes. “Don’t. Be. Boring.” she demanded, punctuating every word with a small step forward until she was almost nose to nose with Abby. Cold radiated from the woman, and Abby shivered. “Ask a better question,” she told her.
“Comfort,” Cas said again. The rune on the left lit up ever so faintly, not enough that it would be visible from a distance, but just enough that you could tell it was some kind of signal. “Joy.” The sigil lost its luminescence. Dean and Sam’s eyes widened simultaneously.
"Ew, didn't need to know that, thanks." Sam said with a shudder,
"That sucks for them, but why are we here?" Dean asked, eyeing the crowd as they stopped a few meters away from crowd.
"What made you come back?" he asked before Gabriel could start talking. Gabriel took a step forward so he and Sam were less than a meter apart,
"I didn't want to be your little secret, that you thought was bad and wrong. I didn't want it to make you unhappy," he pressed a gentle kiss to Deans jaw bone, "and when you see that it wasn't a bad thing, telling Sam would be fine. And I highly doubt it'll be a problem to him anyway." He pressed another kiss to Deans jaw.
. Oh, I could watch action replays of the look of realisation on your face when the angel walked through the door. If I’d have recorded it I could sell it to every witch, demon, vampire, and shifter this side of the planet.” There was that mocking laugh again. She looked him in the eye. “You should thank me. You got your man! I did you a favour.”
’ Dean snorted, and turned the paper to Sam.
Dean spun in his seat, the light from the rising sun (they hadn’t slept since arriving in town) throwing a soft haze through the open doorway where Cas had paused, framing him like some kind of renaissance painting .
"What is it with English people and shaking hands?" Dean muttered under his breath as he shook Will's hand. Will beamed at the pair,
“Someone you can’t live without,” Sam breathed. When the sigil lit up brightly again, they’d clearly found the right answer. Dean mentally ran though the short list of words, matching them up with their full meanings; he could tell Sam was doing the same.
“Personal Relationship, Comfort, Sorrow.” Cas listed. All 3 runes glowed. The men stared, clustered closely to each other and the mirror, happy with their work for a few seconds, and then reality hit.
"Sorry, wasn't supposed to do it that hard. Just kinda desperate to be alone with Cas. Keep the money, split it with the other 3, whatever, just leave, now, please." She walked over to the door, and left, slamming it after her.
All this and So much more.
"When he died... sacrificed himself for us... I was really... sad. I did cry, when you weren't around. And then I got tough, and pretended he'd never happened, so you wouldn't find out and think I'm crazy."
The moment she let go, excruciating pain gripped Abby. Her knees gave way and she crashed to the floor. When the pain subsided, the woman was gone, and the timer now tattooed to Abby’s arm, started counting down from
"Ooooo, isn't he the King of Hell? I remember when you two used to hate him, now we're going to see him like he's a friend?" Dean shoved him down the corridor,
"Fine. But tell me what he says." He turned and walked back the way they'd come. Dean walked toward Sam,
“It would be better for you if you didn’t use that toothpick in your waistband to cause me unnecessary irritation. Believe me, boy, you will not win. You have been a good distraction, and I’ve enjoyed watching you dance, but don’t think for a second that just because I’ve been performing parlour tricks to amuse myself I’m not capable of turning you to ash.” She flexed her fingers, and as she whispered a string of words under her breath, the wind picked up. “I’m leaving now. Don’t try and find me. You will fail. I give you my word I will not play here, and my word is my truth. You have done your job, Winchester; you’ve rid this town of the nasty witch. Don’t start fights you can’t win,” she warned. The wind abruptly blew like a hurricane, and like paper in a breeze, Yrsa took to the sky and disappeared into the clouds.
"He's done it before, many times. Most recently his guise of a Trickster, rather than his true nature of an archangel. This time however," he added when Sam glared at him, "I did believe him to be truly dead, how he survived Lucifer, I do not know. This will be very interesting to find out." From the look on Sam's face he didn't share the opinion. Admittedly Cas had been more surprised by the news of Sam and Gabriel's relationship. He'd gone quiet for a few seconds, looked Sam up and down, before nodding and muttering "Figures." To a raised eyebrowed Sam, "He had to do something to act out at father, I supposed getting into a relationship with one of the fate-opposing brothers would be his style." He received a glared from Sam and backtracked a little, "I don't mean it in a bad way, he was always very fond of things he got attached to. I just meant, I shouldn't have been surprised, because doing things that our fathers followers disapprove of is the sort of thing he'd love." At which point Dean patted his arm and told him to stop talking.
"Ashlyn." The blonde haired girl told him. Dean smiled,
"He's the only option we have right now. You don't have to come down if you don't want to, you can go make some lunch, or go watch TV in our room?" He told the angel. Cas sighed,
"Are you done now?" He interrupted again. Crowley folded his arms across his chest and want back in his seat.
"I assure you, my intellect is rather large, it can capacitate a large amount of information. Tell me what is wrong." Dean sighed,
Nothing changed. The clock continued to tick.
"Keep his lips warm." He said smirking at her, she leant in and kissed Cas. Meanwhile, Dean began sliding Cas' trench coat from his shoulders, which he threw across the room, and then proceeded to inch the angels' trousers down. Dean was surprised at Cas' choice in boxers, they just so happened to be Dean's favourite pair that he thought the cleaner had stolen in a motel in Rhode Island.
Vaguely, Dean heard Sam excuse himself, but he didn’t react. Dean realised that he wanted this. This felt good… natural even. Cas’s lips were soft, and there was no awkward tentativeness. They were in tandem, knowing when and how to move like it was instinctual.
He wasn’t just burning now; he could feel his skin melt away drip by sizzling drip, his bones snapping, every single organ in his body burning individually, his joints tearing out of their sockets.
"He's poking his nose in where its not needed, that's what he's doing." Dean told the newcomer, trying not to shout. Cas tucked his finger in between their interlocked hands and began stroking Dean's palm, trying to quietly soothe him, and indicate that he should calm down. James leant back to whisper in the mans ear, when he pulled away, the man smiled and slipped his arm from James' waist,
Cas pushed through the door, frustration evident on his face.
"Thanks." He gave in to Deans persistent tugging, and walked away.
"Dean you've got your own p-" his hips jerked forward of their own accord as Dean pressed his soft, warm lips to the head of Cas' cock, he groaned, "No one has every touched, let alone kissed it-" He broke off again as Dean ghosted his forefinger and thumb up and down the shaft. Cas shuddered, "More." He breathed. Dean took the entire length in his hand and began to pump it, smirking. "F-faster." Cas stuttered, resting a hand on Dean shoulders as he felt his legs begin to go weak. Dean sped up, the friction creating more heat. "Dean...I gotta...strange...feeling..."Cas panted between breathes.
Once settled around the coffee table, with Dean, Cas and Sam squashed into one sofa, and Abby on the other, she looked expectantly at the boys.
By the time they broke apart, the curse had been almost forgotten. Somehow Cas’s hand had ended up in Dean’s, and they stood for a few seconds, catching their breaths, foreheads touching.
“I don’t want an apology,” Cas replied, squeezing Dean’s hand gently. Only when he looked down to admire their interlocked fingers did he catch sight of his bare arm and remember the reason he’d even kissed Cas. He pulled his hand out of Cas’s to hold both arms out in front of him. The timer had disappeared.
"Don't be an idiot, I'm saying we should probably get another room together and tell him in the morning." A smile spread from Cas' mouth to his eyes almost as quickly as he pressed his lips to Deans, "Go over to the check in and get another room and pay it to my card, will you. I'll write Sam a note to tell him where we are." Dean said when the broke apart again. Cas disappeared instead of walking. dean rolled his eyes and walked to the table to find something to write on, his mind still on the feeling of Cas' lips against his.
Yrsa cut him off. “Oh, I know who you are.” She turned to shake Dean’s hand, then Cas’s. “Imagine, I'm here entertaining myself, and who should show up?” She paused dramatically, rolling her eyes when all she received were blank stares, “Humanities Greatest Defenders! What are the kids calling you these days?
"Sam I was in above my head, I fucked up royally, I slipped away in the hope to protect you. And yes I know you can protect yourself, but what sort of person would I have been if I'd caused problems and hoped you could clean up after me. I hoped you'd just continue without me, and you'd be okay, and for the most part you were, which was good. But now you need someone to watch over you who isn't your brother, or my brother for that matter. So I've come back for you, because you need someone who understands you. And I'll stay as long as you need me. I promise. I really fucking do."
"See, wasn't so hard to be nice, and at least you can joke about anal." He laughed, and then checked his watched, "It's almost 11, I'm assuming you know why we're all here." Dean and Cas nodded, "Good, were all starting at 11. See you both on the other side," he laughed, and then tugged James away, James winked at the pair and rejoined his group of friends.
"Tell me you're not going to leave again," Sam breathed when they broke apart, both breathless, faces still close enough that their heavy breathing danced across each other's skin,
As Cas studied the picture, Dean got up to lean over his shoulder. What looked like one cohesive design was in fact a small collection of individual characters, one horizontal line, a vertical line with a diagonal line through it, a triangular number 8, and what could only be described as a vertical line with legs.
