He tries to look at her, but somehow can't seem to make eye-contact. "It's a lot of responsibility. What happens if I make a mess of it? If it's too much for me to cope with? If it means that what I've managed to achieve at King's, and with John, is somehow at risk or even damaged by it? I'd be left in an untenable position with
His pale skin seemed almost sinewy, stretched across his face like some sort of anguished mask you’d find in a play. His eyes were full of fear, their usual dim sparkle absent completely. The constant passing of car lights and billboard neons danced across his face in an almost demeaning fashion, and all he could do was blink at John in return, his mouth opening and closing helplessly.
There was another silence, although this one seemed longer and more tense. Sherlock shuffled nervously back and forth on his feet, waiting for a reply but not really expecting one.
“Sherlock, you don’t even have any idea where they’re at!” Sherlock scoffed, shaking his head.
John had always instigated personal contact, never Sherlock, which obviously included kissing. Their first kiss had happened right before they started dating, and John had decided to do it on a whim in the living room. Sherlock had been curled up on his couch, wrapped up in his blue robe and skimming a book for a case they were on, and his lips had been too tempting. He’d rushed over, leaned in and kissed him before he could tell himself not to.
“How much do you love me?” John nearly cut him off and Sherlock released a breathy sigh, closing his eyes momentarily.
“Mhmm. Couldn’t get rid of you, really.. Popped up all the time, muttering smart comments and sarcastic remarks. Was a bit bloody annoying, actually.” Sherlock cracked a smile at that, although it didn’t reach his eyes.
“Not necessarily; maybe it’s grief. I saw Mary all the time after she died, and I wasn’t on any drugs.” Sherlock’s face hardened at that, bringing his head down slowly. John shrugged, reaching out to hold onto his knee.
“You’re right, we haven’t. The game is on, once again.” He winked and John laughed, shaking his head before Sherlock pressed a kiss to the top of his head before leaving the room once more.
A man had come in search of his missing wife, who’d gone to a dinner party with her friends and never returned home. He was panicked and nervous, and John had let him in while Sherlock had gone to get Rosie up from her nap.
There had to be a clue, or a hint, or some sort of break to tell Sherlock where Moriarty had taken John. It wasn’t going to be any fun for Moriarty if the man he was torturing had no idea where to find him.
He smiled to himself, listening as Sherlock walked in and sat down beside John, his knee brushing up against his own as the two of them watched Rosie peacefully.
He wasn’t sure if Sherlock could handle that.
He felt as if the walls of the theatre were caving in on him, crushing him with such immense pressure and weight that he couldn’t stay up any longer. His heart felt like a ton of lead in his chest, aching horribly as he choked out sob after sob, not even recognizing the noises that echoed amongst the walls.
If you want to see the graphics connected to each chapter, head on down to
John rests his chopsticks on the edge of his plate. "Sherlock. They
His tight compact musculature is giving such an edge to John's every movement. Under a misleadingly normal exterior, John has a kind of electric energy, fuelled by a tinge of violence and a hint of anger barely controlled. The contradiction had been what caught Sherlock's eye at their very first meeting. When dancing, the boundaries between them are only skin-deep; John's exterior camouflage falls away; Sherlock can feel all that emotion barely held in check—and his own rising to meet it. He makes no effort to hide his desire that is taking shape in his trousers.
and his trust
And this
"No." The edge of his mouth quirks up. He knows it's petty to relish disappointing other people but growing up under the reign of Violet Holmes had been a never-ending cavalcade of displeasure. It's a tiny payback he decides he deserves, even if Doctor Pichler might question the maturity of such thinking.
He can't see the living room that is behind the mirrored glass to know if it is empty, but it doesn't matter. Sherlock places the hold-all on the teak patio table and pulls out a can of Michigan Zinc —spray paint with a hardcore propellant. He gives it very vigorous shake and gets to work.
Violet snorts. "Very typical of him to just book it and assume I would have nothing on at that time, and make other people pass on the message. Some things never change." She rolls her eyes.
"The fact that you need to ask that question sort of says it all."
Branger leads the way to a wider spot, turning to face us as we move along to join him. The two Czechs make it there comfortably and start putting their skis on. I can hear the Parisian is about two meters behind me when the American in front suddenly stops. He bows his head, poles grasped firmly and then thrust into the footprints made by the three who have already passed this way. Even from where I am standing, I can hear the ragged breaths, interspersed with the occasional grunt. Is the idiot experiencing vertigo or having a panic attack? Both could be fatal if he faints.
Irina snorts. “
"It seemed fair to ensure they knew what they were getting. If they truly wanted to recruit me outside of any competitive process, then I must have had some advantage in making demands."
She snaps back at him. "Very few people would have the capacity to understand her—Lord knows you don't. Therapists, people who try to judge her by their petty moral standards; none of them have ever understood that she is simply so intelligent as to make emotions superfluous".  Mummy sits down to take a sip of tea from her cup. She declares, "You utterly wasted her potential, condemned her to a life in a cage, Mycroft. I can never forgive you for that."
His comment makes me briefly wonder if he's picked up on some of our lovemaking before the accident. Given Sherlock's injuries, I won't be attempting much more than a kiss and cuddle tonight. It's enough for me that Sherlock's shoulders are relaxed, and his eyes are closed. The food, water and the paracetamol seem to have done the trick.
It is the most liberating experience — even better than diving, which is all about the balance between being in an alien environment and yet being able to feel secure and confident in it. I have to think all the time when I am diving. Here, halfway through the mogul field, my brain is subordinate — no, almost disconnected — from my body, which is in charge and feeling the mountain through every sensation I possess. I can taste the snow; I feel the texture of the ice on the surface of it. The skis are extensions of the skin on my feet as if the boots weren't even there. I feel the tiny particles of ice on my face, whipped up by the wind caused by my speed of descent. The sound is like nothing else in the world—a slicing shusssh of waxed ski against the surface that beats a rhythm of my movement through the snow, punctuated by my breath which is starting to come in sharper gasps as the physical demands of riding this mountain ask more and more of what I have to give.
"You are sure he is going to be alright? The doctors here did not seem to be too concerned about him," Branger asks.
Then in the true British tradition of ignoring the metaphorical elephant in the room, he turns to ask Greg. “So, how was Christmas?”
Sherlock looks indignant at this description but then raises a lofty brow before re-focusing on his laptop screen.
“You did very well over the last couple of days, Sebbie,” Jim notes approvingly. “Not a single little toe out of line.”
Sebastian tries to read the scrawl, deciphering—
He shakes his head, dismissing that train of thought as he ascends the stairs, smiling at Rosie’s exuberant greeting at her father.
“What are they?” John asks, reaching for them, he’s assuming case notes, they look just like the ones Sherlock used to stick to the living room wall.
"Yeah, people are going to disagree with you, and you are going to keep saying stuff that shocks them, but that's a part of what they're going to remember from this place. Stories they're going to tell over wine and bloody cheese forty years from now will be about the fact that they worked with you, and that you had a memorable personality on the side of being utterly brilliant and inventing the best shunt anyone has ever seen."
John clicks on the lamp on the bedside cabinet. Sherlock is tightly cocooned into his bedding and his fringe curls, messy and flat, are plastered against his forehead. He looks pale, and when John reaches out to touch the back of his hand to his forehead, he can sense the heat radiating from his husband before his fingers meet with skin. Judging by the sweat and the shivering, the fever must have gone up and down during the night. John had thought he'd heard Sherlock get up at night but had been too sleepy to pay attention to what he'd been doing. Sitting up, John spots a bottle of paracetamol and an empty glass of water on the bedside cabinet on Sherlock's side. He must have taken one in the middle of the night, and now it's worn off.
Smiling, Doctor Pichler gives him an encouraging nod. "And…?"
“On the contrary. Studies have shown that they’re quite effective when said frequently and with conviction.”
Needless to say, a good night is had by all.
As dawn creeps over the horizon, he's ended up here, wherever here is. Somewhere in East London, he guesses. Through the chain-link fence, he watches the Thames rolling out with the tide. The carpark beside the factory building is empty; workers all at home, enjoying their Boxing Day holiday. Overhead, there is a plane approaching City Airport. If he wanted any evidence that Jim's plans have all come apart at the seams, the plane is it.
I had looked over the ropes on that very ridge yesterday; the view was magnificent. My route research prior to booking Branger told me that our start would be very, very steep — a sixty-degree angle of descent for the first couloir. It's not called "The Fall Wall" for nothing. It will be quite an experience, and whatever strategy with my technique I might have been thinking, it may have to change today to accommodate the new, deeper powder conditions.
Sherlock strides over to the courier in time to hear him loudly proclaim, “I already told you, I didn’t see anything. I rode down this way,” he indicates in the direction of Coal Drops Yard, “and saw him floating. Can I go now? I really need to take a piss.” Clearly agitated, his face flushed, and shifting his weight from side to side, the courier looks up to see Sherlock striding towards him. “For fuck’s sake, not someone else who wants to ask me the same dumb questions I've already answered; what do
"I hope it's––" John trails out. "It's just that he can be a bit––"
"Geneva, on Boxing Day—skiing trip."
"Yes, you are and you could. But you won't — not immediately. You'll think about it. I'm told by the people who asked me to talk to you about this that the offer is an amazing opportunity for you to take the next step in your research career, to really push yourself, to take a leading role."
John sucks in a gulp of air (he hadn’t known he had been holding his breath until now) and rips his eyes away from the screen to meet Mycroft’s gaze. The colour has drained from the face of the British Government. Usually the epitome of the stoic, reserved, unemotional Englishman, Mycroft looks … scared, and John is terrified.
It’s a direct shot and Moriarty eyes narrow dangerously. "Choose your weapon
"Ooo, how I do like you like this."
Mycroft drops his hands to the smooth surface of the mahogany wood, running his hands outwards across the inset burgundy leather before getting to his feet. No point in putting off the inevitable. He asks Anthea to call the driver.
Mycroft knows he badly misjudged Moriarty's ability to seduce Moran and to play him onto his side of the chessboard. He'd also been wrong about Moran's loyalty; he'd thought a ‘sink’ estate boy would have been grateful to escape his miserable origins and take advantage of the mentorship. After all Mycroft had done for Moran, to lose him in this way was particularly galling.
John snatches the phone from the table. Sherlock narrows his eyes. "Who is it from?"
Edgar's response, however, takes John by surprise.
Sherlock blinks blearily. He must be hallucinating: after decades of being berated and told off, scolded and yelled at, Violet Holmes has delivered several bouts of praise in the course of a single phone conversation. Whether any of it is genuine and not without ulterior motives remains to be seen. Perhaps it has finally sunk in with her that he is not legally obligated to interact with her — that he gets to decide whether she is worthy of his attention and time.
"That was very good, verbalising such a thing."
"Yes. He's been working here at Verbier for a decade; a Swiss who coaches the under-twenty national team. His offerings are more expensive than average to deter the intermediate skiers, and his pre-trip questionnaire is clear about the fact that if he doesn't think you're up to it, he'll turn you around and send you back to the village. Only five in the group tomorrow, and we're assembling early so that we will be the first to get to the top of Mont Fort."
Mycroft folds his hands primly on the table in front of him, fingers interlaced, awaiting the first question.
Mike draws a breath and John can see the scepticism over his suggestion, so he cuts him off.
"I gave the scripted presentation." Sherlock hears the flat monotone in his voice but can't be bothered to put any effort into changing it to something more socially acceptable. "A number of questions were asked, some pertinent, others impertinent. A few of the faces around the table seemed friendly — in my limited grasp of such things — others did not. They thanked me for the presentation and told me that they would get back to me once they have had a chance to read the detailed proposal. There was some questioning of my handling of the recruitment process." He shrugs. "I wish they would have let Edgar sit in the back. He'd be able to tell me more about what they were thinking."
“Still not fessing up, hm? Fine. Fine. Continue your little game.” John slammed the phone down in its cradle and paced the floor in front of his desk, curling and uncurling his fist. The old man, the book, the fortune cookie… all within a week of the anniversary of Sherlock’s death? It was all too much. He knew, deep down, that Mary hadn’t organised something this extravagant just to play a trick on him. That would be downright cruel, and the Mary he knew was never cruel. Must be coincidental then but…
She kicks off the flats she'd worn after the lesson, and leans back against the arm of the sofa, depositing her feet in his lap.

"William eventually refused to talk at school," Violet suddenly says; the words are out of her mouth before she even realises. Doctor Pichler hadn't told her she couldn't participate, but she had simply assumed she was here just to listen. "George — my husband and William's father — wasn't any help; he was willing to just do what we were advised by several experts, which was to put him in some horrid special needs school. In fact, George worried about me spending all my time on William. '
" She types something quickly, then frowns while making a few mouse clicks. She then reaches over to the printer beside the desk and hands over a printed badge.

Irina takes over. Sternly, she commands, “Stand behind me. Now we

ordinary and so is your plot. Moran here is about to find out his idol has real feet of clay. It must be embarrassing to fail to live up to everyone's expectations."
There are many things this pandemic is teaching us, and for many doctors one of the lessons should be not to go to work while sick and contagious. According to studies done in several countries (including several surveys in the US and research in many different European countries), an astounding number of doctors think it's a badge of honour to work even when significantly ill. Across the board, nurses and other healthcare personnel have much higher absence rates for illness than doctors. In a study done in J's country many older clinicians prided themselves in never having taken a single sick day and stating that "only losers do that". We doctors should definitely know better than to go to a hospital while contagious with an infection, or compromise patient care when we're otherwise not functioning on an acceptable physical and mental level. For many surgeons like Sherlock, there is great pressure to go to work even when sick, especially if they are the only ones doing certain kinds of procedures at their hospital. Calling in sick means cancelled and postponed surgeries. But: how many patients would want a doctor operating them while ill?
Inspiration for Chapter Twelve
"I'm afraid that's all we have time for now," the psychiatrist had said to Violet at the conclusion of their joint session.
John licks his lips and takes Sherlock's hand. "You know what I like the most about this place?"
Sherlock continues, “I am what I am. You are who you are. I respect that; I respect you," Sherlock says. He shakes the document. "This is unnecessary. I thought we had a good working relationship, John, and see no reason to change things or to use this sort of stupid agreement that has no legal basis to alter our arrangement. I will endeavour to avoid gratuitously irritating you if you will do the same."
Sherlock leans his cheek on his fist, looking broodingly thoughtful as he skims the concierge agency website. "Your behaviour signalled you wanted to repel him, yet you are now singing his praises. Odd."
is French for 'foot on the ground', but I swear it means his foot on my neck."
At the bottom, I have to fight the desire to continue. God, I wish John learned to ski well enough that I could show him all this. Who could resist such an experience? It's an addiction; I've just had the best fix that is legal, and I want
"You may well be right. He might feel it's intrusive, or that he finds the idea that you need preparation to talk to him alarming."
"I am not looking forward to speaking to my superior at King's. According to John, he's already worried about the GOSH Steadman Unit recruiting from other Trusts; he is likely to be hostile to the proposition."
“Sally,” he nods to the sergeant who is stationed by the body as it is the process of being examined by …
Why would Moran direct his attention to this? Was it one of Moriarty’s disguises? Is it supposed to be a clue as to what Moran will do next? He reads on, the words revealing that Brook is credited with a long list of television shows and radio programmes over the space of two years. They couldn’t just be made up; they'd be checked.
"My task is to keep this dialogue on a constructive plane," the psychiatrist continues, directing her words at Violet. "You aren't being asked to justify anything you did or didn't do when you were raising him. For Sherlock's sake — for the continuing success of this therapy — it is important to establish ways for the two of you to communicate not just about the past, but also about the present and the future. He asked you to join a session here with me because he thinks your relationship is important to him —important enough to warrant working on so it is more satisfying for you both. Does that sound reasonable to you?"
believe, when it could snap the last fragile threads that tether him to sanity?
"Oh, it bears repeating,” Sherlock states unequivocally. “You are a fraud, a liar, and I will expose you as a common criminal with limited skills."
That's the oddity of life now. It's something that happens to you, rather than him making it happen. A dull routine. The walk to and from the surgery is boring, a chore, a daily commute that sometimes happens without you even being aware of your surroundings. Your very being seems to have switched to auto-pilot. There is no destination, no sense of forward movement that keeps your step lively. You are inert, de-activated, demotivated. You don't walk for pleasure any more.
Dulwich Village is boring. Perhaps it is yet another reason he has been reluctant to visit John while he's been living with Mary. When he walks up towards the white painted Edwardian terraced house that has been gentrified and split into four flats, Sherlock passes Mary's car parked four spaces away. The sight of the second-hand Audi A3 hatchback raises the same question that he'd thought but not asked out loud when he'd first visited.
‘Ireland by now.’
, he convinced that this just has to be the last hitch of the day.
"I… I'm not sure that is entirely accurate. I delivered my speech which seemed to go fine, I attended this whole thing though I didn't want to and, as you said, I put that idiot in his place. My manners or lack thereof may have alienated some of those poncey board members, but they knew what they were getting, and everyone at the table heard what Macdonald said about me first. The fact that they got Stella to recruit me must mean that they know I'm not… like everyone else."
And this
“Have you any idea how much money just walked out of our flat because you called him a ‘conceited imbecile’ whose wife left him because he was ‘woefully inadequate’ in bed?”
He’s softened, his erection waning when John entered him. John reaches to take hold of him but Sherlock stills his hand, no. John looks up sharply, as if annoyed. Sherlock closes his eyes and shakes his head, at the same time bringing his knees in to press against John’s ribs, urging him on.
As the last strains of the bandoneon echo away, the music shifts into a waltz, and from the shadows another couple appear on the ballroom floor. John and Mary, only something's odd about both the music and their dancing. When he turns to see if Victor sees it, too, Sherlock realises that he's gone.
For a moment, he is frozen, unable to move. "I can't move," he whispers. "I'll fall."
? Once again, he is confused about the purpose of this meeting.
As if on cue, Sherlock's phone pings with a text from Lestrade, requesting a meeting at his office in the afternoon. "Looks like I will need to have my arguments planned by three o'clock today.  He wants to see me, so I must use this as a chance to inform him of the positive aspects of the deal."
“Oh. Yes.” It’s a whisper, it’s a promise. “Oh, I had no idea, but oh, yes. I am amenable.”
“Where do you want it then, Mrs. Burke?”
Sherlock had refilled their glasses, and John was sniffing appreciatively at his. In a moment the smell of burning wood joined the peaty scent of the whisky. The quiet was broken only by distant traffic noises and the crackle of pine cones and kindling. He sensed it was time to shift gears.
“She your dealer now, as well?” John stares pointedly at his arm; Sherlock refuses to look down.
Why did Mycroft's baby brother have to be alive? And now this shameless provocation, sticking his nose into Jim's plans? Sebastian knows he has to tell Jim; if he sends the footage to Jim that it will be the proof needed to validate Sebastian's earlier revelation that Holmes might still be alive. But Jim's chilling threat about it being the wrong day to die is still rattling around in Sebastian's head. He's never before tested his relationship with Jim in this way. He needs a face-to-face with him, needs to be able to read his state of mind. All this
Sherlock leans back on his heels. "Describe him."
"I am
Sherlock decides he should be rather proud of himself for having anticipated that John's reaction could be problematic. Such things fall under the realm of other people's feelings and motives, and this is a promising example that he can learn to anticipate people's responses and manage the outcome. Not that he knows how to resolve this problem with John's scepticism now that it has been brought to light.
"Where to?"
Janine nods, as Irina uses her remote to begin the music again. It's perhaps the most popular salsa piece ever,
He hears Sherlock's voice in his head, that demanding baritone.
“What would
"Because if you don't, he'll do something really nasty to my family, something that could end up with my father being killed."
in those light words, this wasn’t a joke, wasn’t banter. He was almost certain: this was the right moment, the powerful pull of feeling in the air, he wasn’t imagining it. Once he might have missed that emotional freight.
She laughs. "Just helping you connect the dots."
If that last word comes out a little loud, I don't give a damn, especially when it has the desired effect. A pair of verdigris eyes open, accompanied by a groan.
Sherlock opens the address book on his phone to pass on the details, which are written down.
Then he starts texting Mycroft, begging for the file to be expedited.
"You make me sound like I did it all by myself like Rambo."
And there they are. The words that could completely unravel all his carefully laid plans.
. Definitely, the sound is of plastic shovels on snow, and it is in stereo — on the phone and also for real around me. Things are getting brighter in my trap; they must be near. It's like clouds parting; a tiny shaft of bright sunlight comes in to make me blink, followed by a black shape that is pulling snow away. I focus — what I am seeing turns out to be a glove. The air pocket around my nose and mouth suddenly fills with snow, and I panic, shouting "
Mrs Hudson shrugs. "When Frank bought this place all those years ago as an investment, he put it in my name. He said if I rent it out officially, then it means taxes and inspections and all sorts of building regulations that he didn't want to deal withal that legal stuff about who I can and cannot allow in, not to mention what I can charge. The local council people are such busy-bodies, sticking their nose into things. The fact that it's 221b on the front door is because there's no locked door to your flat; and that's against the rules, apparently."
"This is good," Edgar says, pointing at his fishcake with his fork, presumably to break the silence.
"Give me that pile," Mycroft growls.

"The Dahl Foundation is funding a Hydrocephaly Research Centre of Excellence inside the Steadman Unit. They want me to head up the design team," Sherlock repeats.

Sherlock nodded. "It may be the only opportunity I ever get to put in place the things that are necessary if I'm to do collaborative research."
When he'd said that he didn't have friends, rather than argue that you were one such friend, you'd snarked back, "Wonder why?"

Jules' mother drapes an arm across Emma's shoulder, and they take a moment to allow the younger woman to collect herself.
“You didn’t taste it?”
"Sushi was originally pub food in Japan, to be eaten with beer."
“Papa!” She sniffled again, reaching her arms out needily towards him, another stray tear falling down her face. Sherlock immediately crossed the room and scooped her up, ignoring the way his arms ached before pulling her close to his chest.
“Are they holding hands?!”
“Yes, of course…” he responded slowly, sliding his legs down and off the couch, his feet hitting the floor quietly. “I want to meet them.”
Sherlock raised his hand up to rub at his eyes, kneading at them with the palms of his hands until stars began to dance in front of his vision. His arm was sore, and as he dropped his hands he gazed down at the purple and blue bruises beginning to form on his alabaster skin from the needles. His chest ached at that, guilt rising inside of him like a flood.
“What did I say earlier, little one?” John grinned and took the bag from her, setting it in his own chair as Sherlock came out of the kitchen, somehow balancing the tray of cups in one hand and holding the kettle in the other before setting it down on the coffee table.
It sounds simple enough when a therapist says it; after all, it’s their job.
“I didn’t know they were that close?” She sounded more amazed than anything, and she had a right to be. It was a strange sight, seeing Sherlock Holmes toting a baby around on his hip in 221B like it was the most normal thing in the world.
“Sherlock’s not haunted, no.” It was his turn to fidget now, messing with a loose string on his pants.
“Of course. Has Sherlock gotten back yet?” He jumped suddenly as the door burst open once more, turning around to find a soaking wet Sherlock Holmes standing in the doorway, looking displeased. His dark curls were stuck to his alabaster colored face, his coat dripping heavily onto the tile floor as he grimaced, shutting the door rather loudly behind him.
Sherlock huffed again, leaning against the back of John’s hair, the front of his dark purple button up shirt wet from the dishwater, tapping his fingers against the cushion. “...on Christmas Eve? Really, John?”
“Sherlock…” He got a muffled grunt in response, more pieces of paper flying over his shoulder. John sighed a bit, going back to his box of books on the floor between his feet. He grabbed the remaining few and crossed the room to the bookshelf, stacking them up in the leftover space, his fingers leaning heavily over the spines for a moment before he dropped his hands, turning abruptly.
It wasn’t something you casually brought up; hey, by the way, I attempted suicide many times growing up and even after I grew up. He’d tried everything in the book at least once, including varying amounts of poison. It never worked; Mycroft always got him to the ER to get his stomach pumped in time.
That afternoon, John couldn’t keep the silent cab ride back to Baker Street from his mind. Sherlock had looked out the window the entire time, but it didn’t seem to be on purpose. Rather, John thought he looked very deep in thought, his brows scrunched together slightly as London whizzed past them outside.
“It’s our first night together as a family, actually. I only get to live it out once.” HIs voice was calm and nonchalant, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to say, but John felt as if his heart had suddenly swelled 5 times its normal size. He bit his lip, still watching Rosie fixedly as he cleared his throat, nodding in agreement.
“You remind me of him, the boy…” He turned, watching Sherlock follow him over, his curls hitting the top of the yellow tape briefly before he stood up straight, staring John down.
For a moment, Sherlock could hear absolutely nothing except for the blood that was pounding furiously in his ears. Time seemed to slow down; his feet stayed rooted in place as Moriarty walked towards the side of the stage, and John emerged from the back.
“I don’t want to go back there.”
“Did you say Shakespeare festival?” The man shot him another cross look, quickening his pace.
It was almost a slap in the face to think that Sherlock didn’t remember it, but John could see the gears of his mind working slowly, a soft look of realization dawning across his face.
“This is not your fault.” Sherlock huffed again at that, but remained silent nevertheless. John narrowed his eyes slightly before continuing.
For a moment, John let that sink in. He was right, of course; he was always fucking right. He sucked in a breath, keeping his grip on the detective’s hand, struggling for words.
“You jumped off a building.” John swore he could hear the gears in Sherlock’s head turning, a swift look of realization appearing and disappearing in his eyes so fast he could’ve imagined it. But John knew he didn’t.
He made his way back upstairs to their flat and walked in, Sherlock already setting their wine glasses in the sink, looking a bit disdained.
Sherlock gritted his teeth, resisting the urge to snap at him as Moriarty suddenly took a step back, clucking his tongue disappointedly.
There had to be something to all of this.
John looked up immediately, his frown deepening as he sat up slowly. “I never said that,” he replied slowly, watching as the detective crossed the room to sit on his other side, his feet dragging slightly against the wood floor.
Another high pitched note, and Sherlock’s frown deepened as he tilted his head down, his foot brushing up against Rosie’s baby monitor.
Mycroft’s helicopter had disappeared from overhead now, leaving the swarm of police to start scoping out the rest of the building in peace. Sherlock glanced around quickly, watching officers pulling random people out of the wings and hidden spots in the audience, confiscating guns and yanking them towards the exit. He even witnessed people emerging from the stage trapdoor a few feet away, completely subdued in shiny silver handcuffs. He was so caught up in the scene playing out before him that he didn’t hear John walking towards him, jumping in fear when his hand made contact with his arm.
“Shakespeare Festival, Southwark.” The cabbie merely gave him a strange look before nodding and taking off. Sherlock pulled out his phone with fumbling fingers; he blamed it on how wet his hands were, but in reality it was from the slight shaking that had begun to take over. He typed out a quick message to his brother, swallowing thickly before setting his phone down in his lap, gazing out the window.
“Go back to sleep, John.”
Sherlock clenched his teeth together, feeling like he’d just been punched in the stomach. He squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to steady his breathing as Moriarty’s voice echoed out amongst the arena theatre once more.
A beat passes between them, then he speaks up again, a bit louder this time.
“They’re in here somewhere. Honestly, why don’t you just put the clothes in the hamper?” Sherlock made a distressed sort of noise, ignoring him and Rosie giggled, squirming around in her father’s lap.
“Well, yes, some people might remember you in that way.” He pulled his hand back into his lap, staring fixedly at nothing in particular. “I, for one, will remember you as the man who single handedly changed my life for the better.”
“Molly, stay for a bit? I made tea, and I’m pretty sure it’s awful, but you can pretend to like it for a bit, hm?” Molly grinned at that, scrunching her nose up a bit fondly as she turned to face him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly at him, as if it were the most distasteful joke he’d ever heard in his entire life and John was amazed he even had the audacity to look at him like that, considering the fact that he’d said much worse to people before. He walked over carefully, scanning the headstones for a moment.
“God, you’re so boring sometimes!” he whined loudly and Sherlock merely shrugged in response, his head falling to the side to rest on his own shoulder as he watched him.
“She’s just as much yours as she is mine.” He’d never seen Sherlock blush so deeply in his entire life.
The crowds eventually faded, mostly due to the fact that a police blockade was set up and they were all forced out. Rosie was wrapped in one of the bright neon police jackets, dozing off against John’s chest as he spoke quietly to Lestrade about a half hour later.
He broke out of his reverie as Sherlock’s sudden loud, coughing fit began, and John was almost ashamed at how quickly he rushed to his side.
“Mycroft, what a surprise.” He walked towards him, his entire collarbone and half of his chest exposed, refusing to break eye contact. “What brings you around, brother mine?”
“I want Papa…” John’s heart clenched painfully at his daughter’s sleepy words, glancing down at her relaxed frame amongst her pillows and blankets.
Sherlock had remained silent throughout John’s little speech, not even reacting when his hand was grabbed onto. He lifted his head up after John had finished, squinting his blue eyes slightly at him.
“What’s Mycroft want?” Sherlock shrugged, placing Rosie on his hip.
‘I will die, and leave him all. Life, living, all is Death’s.’
“I know that was hard for you to say,” he started, and Sherlock let out a shaky breath, closing his eyes and nodding quickly.
Moriarty made a loud gagging noise then, Sherlock falling silent as he felt John tense up in his arms, listening to loud footsteps begin to approach him from behind.
“Can we...can I...have some...privacy?” he mumbled a bit, and John raised his eyebrows in surprise.
Mycroft was standing in the middle of their living room, his hands beneath Rosie’s armpits, awkwardly holding her with his arms extended out. Sherlock was quite literally giggling into John’s hair, watching as Mycroft looked around uncomfortably before deciding to sit down in the client’s chair, setting Rosie down gently in his lap. Rosie was unfazed, instead studying this new man with large eyes, still drooling all over herself and her hand.
“Doesn’t matter. This one still sucks. That woman’s probably on drugs.” John smiled a bit, shaking his head in disagreement.
The day after Rosie turned 11 months old, Mycroft showed up to Baker Street that morning. He hadn’t bothered to call in advance, as far as John knew, and was knocking loudly on their door around 8 am. John groaned and shoved a foot into Sherlock’s side to get him up but he merely grunted in response, wrapping himself tighter in the sheets.
Another gunshot. Sherlock swung his head around the opposite way, towards the noise, just in time to see a gun slide across the stage floor. He followed it with his eyes briefly before looking back, his eyes widening in shock to see John standing a few feet in front of him, pointing a gun down towards Moriarty’s body writhing on the ground in front of him.
Sherlock’s mouth seemed to be made for his; it molded against John’s perfectly as his hands immediately grabbed onto his waist, pulling him effortlessly into his lap. John followed his lead quickly, his legs sliding their way to either side of Sherlock’s hips and wrapping themselves around his lower back. He deepened the kiss even further, his arms snaking their way around his neck so that Sherlock was arching over him, clutching his side and back.
Silence on the other end. Sherlock was about to yell when his brother cut him off.
“Fine,” he replied simply, still staring him down. “But if you need any help-” John jumped slightly at Sherlock’s sudden loud groaning noise, raising his eyebrows as Sherlock shook his head quickly, his curls bobbing in the air.
“Come on, John…” He reached down and cupped his face with one hand, suddenly aware of how badly his vision was blurring. “Wake up!” he demanded loudly, shaking his shoulders violently. John remained perfectly still, his head falling limply against Sherlock’s thigh as his shirt began to grow damp from the detective’s onslaught of tears.
“John, that sounds like a biography for the entirety of America in 2016.” And really, John hadn’t heard anything that funny in months.
An hour later found himself lying in his large king sized bed, staring blankly at the ceiling above him. He still hadn’t quite gotten used to sleeping alone; it was weird sleeping in the middle of the mattress. Every time he tried, he found himself scooting to the left of the bed once more.
John simply stared at him in response, watching the detective’s chest rise and fall rapidly after his finished speech. He clenched his jaw again, scanning his face carefully as he struggled to process his reasoning.
“I can do that,” he replied simply, and there was a rustling on the other end of the line as he began to move. Rosie had finished sniffling and was now gazing up at Sherlock quietly, thumb still in her mouth to make up for her lack of her pacifier. Mrs. Hudson walked inside and gently scooped the toddler up, flashing Sherlock a concerned look.
‘Lovely family. When are you going to invite me over for tea? -JM’
“You’re going to do EXACTLY that!” he spat out loudly, and John froze in place. The commotion of officers milling in and out of the building slowly came to a pause, and he could see Lestrade suddenly straighten up in his spot. “You’re going to get a cab and go home with your daughter and lock the doors and not think about me. This is NOT about you, either of you. It’s about me and this monster of a man and I’m going to finish what we started.” His voice had taken on a deep, almost menacing tone, one John hadn’t heard before. His grip on Rosie had tightened instinctively, praying to someone or something above that she wasn’t awake. He cleared his throat once, trying not to suffocate under all of the tension that was suddenly between them.
She pursed her lips slightly and set her pen down on the table in front of them; John felt his face flush in embarrassment and she cracked a grin, shaking her head.
"I'm not sure he could refrain from being condescending about that."
“Find him.” Sherlock can't contain his anger. "Need I remind you that the whole point of letting him go was to be able to track him back to the rest of the network!"
self, and he doesn't want to hear her nagging on the subject matter yet again.
"Of course."
He raises a brow sardonically, then glances at the clock over the fireplace. "There's still an hour to go."
If John wasn’t in a mood to be conversed or reasoned with, he most certainly isn’t in a mood to
"This was Mrs Hudson's idea?"
oOoOoOoOo
“So, it seems,” Sherlock had replied, eyes still closed.
John decides he can risk sharing his theory with Mike. It had come to him last night when he'd been trying to work out how one of the blood tests could show this odd DNA, when the others didn't. “The 7% makes me think maybe the question isn’t whose blood is in that 7%, but how it got there.”
Why on earth you think that is better than me being back at the chalet where I could actually get some rest?"
Sherlock sighs. He needs food. The lingering aroma of what his nose tells him is roast lamb sets off hunger pangs that compete with his sore ribs. And more's the pity, he’s too tired even to needle Mycroft about how the smell is surely testing his current diet’s resolve.
John removes the blanket carefully to take a look, trying to ignore the scent of a body that has been so mistreated. “Look, Sherlock, I am
“I did,” Sherlock protested, his gaze slow to slip from John and return to her. “I smiled. Frequently.”
This chapter links back to my entire opus of works as a solo writer (see end notes). I'm not as spontaneous or quick off the mark as J_Baillier, but I was inspired. And perhaps more literal than my partners in this story.
“Esker Shooting Ground?” He asks hopefully.
“Don’t worry, all your hard work won’t go to waste, Brother Mine.”
"What?!" Sherlock has spotted his surprise and is curious.
"Then let's get back to the business of solving the case, shall we?"
In the Conservatory With the Revolver - Audiomachine • Another Sky
"This may help resurrect you." Sherlock pours the brandy into the glasses on the coffee table. "It's okay to be frustrated at first. I hope you won't get discouraged. I really want to continue; it's a great opportunity to keep seeing each other."
"Now? Now, I'm not sure. Not sure of anything anymore, really," he tells her feet. Surprising himself that he's being this open with a stranger.
He’s asked her, hopelessly, “And if I’m not particularly intuitive?”
A moment passes —or is it longer? He can't tell. But something is tapping his cheek and it's getting more insistent. He manages to prise open one eye, to see another bloodshot eye looking at him with concern.
He blanched for a moment, his entire body stiffening up. Rachel merely watched him, still fidgeting with her pen in her hands. John flickered his eyes back up to meet hers again quickly, before giving a slow shake of his head.
“No no, don’t be…” His voice faded away as he watched Rosie settle against Sherlock’s side, one tiny hand latching itself onto the front of his shirt and the other going into her mouth as she gazed around the room over his shoulder, apparently bored of this entire situation.
“It’s alright, bug...don’t cry…” Sherlock could barely focus on the way Rosie buried her face into his neck and hugged him back, his mind trying its best to catch up on everything that had happened.
“There’s 20 minutes left…” she replied, and John swallowed thickly, tapping his fingers against the wooden armrest. He wasn’t one to abandon therapy appointments, especially not the first one, but really he wanted nothing more than to escape the room that was now starting to remind him of the prison cells back in Sherrinford.
“I’m being serious, Sherlock,” he warned, and Sherlock groaned dramatically at him in response, throwing his head back and nearly colliding with the cabinet behind him.
“Lestrade, it’s fine. You didn’t know, it happened a long time ago.” He shrugged, smiling warmly at him. “That’s all there is to it. Don’t worry about it, really.”
The warm London air hit him like a train as soon as he stepped out of the doors, humid and muggy from the rain that had just passed. He looked around wildly, trying to spot his boyfriend’s mop of dark curls as Rosie clung onto his shirt with her hand, silent.
And really, after that first night, it was like the couple had been doing this for years.
John closed his eyes briefly, taking a shaky breath before opening his mouth to speak.
“Was it me tonight?”
City lights have a tendency to wash people out, especially at night. John hadn’t really noticed this before; maybe because he didn’t pay attention, maybe because he just didn’t care. But seeing Sherlock now...there was no question in the matter.
Sherlock hadn’t gone back to work yet, but John didn’t mind. He had the clinic to busy him for the time being, and Sherlock was still recovering. He liked spending his days with Rosie when it was his turn to babysit (as far as John was aware), and besides that he’d just been reading and playing the violin.
The quote...it had been Shakespeare. From a well known play too, not one of his Henry’s or something looked over. Romeo and Juliet.
“Stop this, Sherlock,” he murmured softly into his skin, knowing his voice would still be heard through the deafening silence. “Don’t worry yourself sick like this, please…”
Sherlock sniffled again, his eyes still fogged over as he lifted his head and blinked at his partner in response, looking dazed but nonetheless following suit. He stumbled and nearly fell on his way up, had he not grabbed onto John’s waist to save himself. The trip down the hall to the bedroom seemed agonizingly slow, with Sherlock seeming to barely remember how to walk, but soon enough John was depositing him in bed.
John found himself shaking his head before his thoughts had finished, dropping his arms down from his chest.
This was ebbing within John’s mind like a lighthouse beacon, reminding him over and over again as he kissed Sherlock that this should’ve happened years ago. They wouldn’t be sitting here together, curled up in the darkness in an unfamiliar house. John wouldn’t have this sickening feeling of remorse residing in his stomach like a pound of lead and a wedding band that suddenly felt very heavy on his finger.
John felt nauseous; his head was spinning and he read the note 10 more times, his eyes scanning the words over and over again. Rosie was fidgeting against his arm now, obviously unhappy that she’d been awoken and whimpering slightly. John looked up suddenly, shoving the receipt into his pocket before jumping up and making a beeline for the doors, mumbling out sporadic apologies as he took no notice of the people around him.
John feels his head bob up and down slightly, though he’s not fully aware he’s even doing it. He hears an audible sigh from beside him, and then the movement of the bed beneath him as Sherlock goes to move off.
“Join me? I know it must be annoying, being all wet like that.” He winked playfully at him, and Sherlock really felt sick now. He saw the guard shift a bit in his spot, moving slightly so that Sherlock had full access to walk towards Moriarty. For a moment, the two men simply stared at one another, their eyes daring to speak what their mouths wouldn’t.
“Whatever you say, John. Now listen, I’m going to go in there and talk to him for a couple minutes, and you’ll stay back here and call me in. Then I’ll ask him to hold Rosie and pass her over and he’ll have no choice but to take her while I run back here. Then we can watch him suffer from the safety of the hallway.”
John could feel every pair of eyes fall on him at once, and he immediately tilted his head down, reaching up to stroke Rosie’s hair. “I’m sorry, bug…” he murmured quietly, pulling her hands from her ears. “Let’s go home, hm?”
He swallows a bit, his eyes flickering down to where John still has a death grip on his wrist before looking back up and meeting his eyes once more before putting on a strangely placid look, emotion draining from his face like color.
“Yeah, Scotland Yard gave him one. Something along the lines of being a “distinguished member” of the department. I’m sure it was all Detective Inspector Lestrade’s idea; he’s thankful for him, but he knows how much Sherlock hates attention like that.” John smiled fondly, shifting Rosie in his lap once more. “But he deserves it. He does all of these good things all the time and he needs more appreciation.”
Molly and Mrs Hudson shared a smile.
It's the way he says it that makes my eyes tear up. The onslaught of emotion is sudden, and the embarrassment over displaying it takes me a moment to process. I swallow and remind myself that this is too important to retreat from even if I feel a bit embarrassed. "That's not what I… I wouldn't be
“It’s OK, I’m going to take care of you." He looks closely at Sherlock's eyes, trying to judge the dilation of his pupils in the dim light. Apart from being bloodshot to hell, they look relatively normal. "What was in the syringe and how long ago?"
"You want to put my brother on trial, embarrass him in front of the world. Well, go ahead. We have enough information now about all your little tricks to expose you for good. He's willing to sacrifice himself for the chance to say it all in public—no mathematical genius at work. You've spent a lifetime trying desperately to live up to that reputation, to justify what my brother saw in you. Rather shameless, your attempt to try and make yourself look bigger than you are."
"No, of course not. You did well with Alice, but this is a lot different. I'm really surprised you're not sounding as sceptical about managing a group of people as you were about training just one."
John is smiling, relieved. Sherlock seems to relax, even cracking a bit of a smile.
"I'm not saying they are discussing your diagnosis behind your back, Sherlock," she hastens to add. "That's the paranoia talking which we've established can easily tie you up in anxious knots quite needlessly. People talk, and physicians are no different. Look at it this way: asking your family friend to approach you means that they are doing a lot of work to approach you in the right way  and that they want to be sensitive about things that make you different."
“Saturday,” Sherlock muses, as if that’s the first time he has even considered what day of the week it is. It probably is.
My snark about the bottle being at least better than a Foley earns me a Sherlockian death glare. He knows as well as I do that the urine sample is needed to rule out any bruising to his kidneys, so cornering the poor nurse was just his way of expressing… whatever it is that needs expression-by-deflection at the moment.
Still, he feels ready for tonight. Only one detail had gone to the dogs: John hadn't marked down his day surgical appointment for his knee arthroscopy on their joint calendar. He claimed to have told it to Sherlock and reminded him at least once, but he certainly hadn't done it in Edgar's presence since not even the assistant had been aware of it. So, two days prior, they had realised that John wouldn't be able to accompany Sherlock to this celebration dinner of the new unit at The Connaught Hotel's Mayfair Room, a lavish space accommodating a hundred and twenty patrons for a sit-down meal.
He had decided to schedule an appointment once the results of his New Year’s Eve outing had receded to a dull ache. He’d drunk through his grief in the time Sherlock had been gone, but this — this new drinking, the anger — is different. In the former situation, there were consequences only for him. Now, however, it has potentially serious consequences for others, as that altercation with the pub patron three nights ago shows. The full-blown rage he had experienced that night hadn’t (thankfully) made a repeat appearance at the flat, but a strained silence, interspersed with snippy comments and tangential arguments had continued over the past few days. In the silence that he lets fall between him and Ella, he remembers one of them.
Lestrade takes a breath. "I can tell you've made a big difference to him over the wobbles he had after Christmas; those reminded me of what happened when you went to Afghanistan. He seems to have sorted things and is back, firing on all cylinders again. Christ, he even apologised to Anderson around that thing with Alice. I wouldn't have believed it could be possible. No patient complaints lately, either. I hope he's happy here."
John nods. "At least we can start the discussion. Your lips have been stitched tight together about this for the past few days. I know you talked to Greg, so what's it going to be?"
He grimaces as he attempts to make way through the delicate strands without announcing his presence. He can't avoid the occasional tinkle of glass beads as he slips through, but he's quiet. Certainly quiet enough to evade detection by the occupant of the downstairs flat who is going to be sound asleep, if the lingering aroma of marijuana is anything to go by. The evidence of self-medication is confirmed when his pocket torch illuminates the stubs in the ashtray on the kitchen table.
, Sherlock. Maybe I could use a bit of reassurance every once in a while."
"DAMN. Sorry, I'm just useless."
His hands go to his hair where his fingers worry the curls into a dishevelled mess. He needs something, anything, a distraction. And razing the remainder of Moriarty’s network to the ground would be the perfect one. But Mycroft is still going to make him wait another two days for it. Intolerable.
Sherlock's features widen into a grin. "Game on!"
Sherlock sighs. "What choice do I have? This way he stays alive. Letting him become a pawn between Moriarty and me was always going to end badly. This way, when we do finally figure out what game Moriarty is playing and catch him, then at least John will be alive."
"I'm glad you could join us, Violet," Pichler says amicably as she arranges herself into her usual chair by her desk. "I'm sure Sherlock is, too."
a girl to do?” He is getting slightly distracted by the line of conversation.
"While he was still under?" I am astonished — and relieved when Branger nods. Hearing the voices of his rescuers must have helped Sherlock keep calm. I suddenly realise it had to have been Branger he was on the phone with when I was trying to call him, too.
Alighting from the bench, Sherlock moves to lead him up the hill towards the clearing but John fixes him with a look and Sherlock acquiesces, dropping back and allowing John to go first. Sherlock is brilliant, one of a kind. Able the read the tiniest fragments of evidence and construct an entire timeline of the events before anyone else realises what they are seeing—a genius. But what genius lacks, what John knows he brings to their partnership, is the sixth sense of a soldier. The one that whispers lowly, despite any physical evidence to the contrary, that danger lies around the next corner. That gut feeling that has saved him and his men on the battlefield on more than one occasion, John has trusted in the past to save his and Sherlock’s lives as well. He’s going to trust it now.
“Scott, you’ve been very quiet tonight. Let’s pick up where you left off on Wednesday, shall we?”
Moriarty’s pause and Moran’s subsequent halt behind him, serve to impede Doctor Watson’s exit from the building. The Doctor does not bother hiding his annoyance, shouldering Moran roughly as he pushes past. Mycroft’s ex-MI6 recruit seems to stumble slightly, then averts his eyes and ignores the slight, however the force causes him to reposition his stance—Mycroft deduces an injury; something is making Moran favour his leg.
lot are supposed to be watching him. Why didn't we know this was going to happen?"
Lestrade’s mug pauses halfway to his lips, his face turning an explosive shade of red. "A case? Are you out of your mind? I've seen your bloody
Sherlock spray painted on Jim’s balcony door looks like
"Piss off." It's all he can manage.
I take a moment to just stand at the kerb, the plastic bag gripped hard in my hand without making a move to climb into the back seat, the door of which Philipp is holding open for me.
, there is a fluttering of eyelashes. Before he can take a breath, his relief is shredded when Sherlock's eyes open wide, morphing from the beloved blue into the dark-eyed manic stare of Jim Moriarty.
She smiles as she pulls the car door shut behind him.
His ability to process any of … it … reduced to vague concepts, he sits there, willing the world and all of its inhabitants to just disappear so he can try and make some sense of it. But they don't. Of course they don’t. The yelling just gets louder, and now he can hear Sherlock's biting snark being added to the fray.
“Why should I listen to you? You don’t know him at all.”
To do his research, John goes down the road to the Guy's Hospital Courtyard Café. It's got good coffee, and the way his mind is starting to flag after the initial adrenaline rush of discovery, the caffeine is going to be a needed boost. Using his phone to dig around on the Trust website, he finds the names of various senior house officers in different services at Guy's. He starts phoning, taking on the role of Doctor John Watson, a GP who is trying to track down what happened to an unnamed patient whom he had treated at the scene of an accident between a car and an NHS patient transfer vehicle just down the road, about to turn into the hospital to deliver the patient.
"Yes, of
"What do I do if you ain't?" is the snarky reply.
"I've been trying to decide whether you are either so egotistical that you thought you could waltz in here and win this little game of ours, or whether you are just colossally stupid," his captor muses.
The thought of returning to Baker Street had been too unbearable. If he has lost John… no, there is no
Edgar unbuttons his navy corduroy jacket and rearranges symmetrically on the table in front of him the cutlery he fishes out of two wooden boxes. "It's early days, yet. But fine as far as I'm concerned, absolutely fine." After a pause, he asks hesitantly, "Has he said something to the contrary?"
“What is this,” John looks in confusion from one brother to the other. “Some sort of joke?”
“Would someone mind explaining what the bloody hell is going on?” John demands, getting up from his chair to face Sherlock. “The message, you are talking about Moriarty’s message.”
Sherlock hasn't commented much on how Edgar has been doing as a prospective assistant. They had agreed on a longish trial period, and perhaps a lack of complaints means that the young man's performance has been acceptable. He hasn't shown up at their flat much, which suits John just fine.
The Glenmorangie Signet scotch whisky slides down Mycroft's throat. Once he's taken a moment to savour it, he replies to Sherlock with a snort. "Now you're going to tell me he's doing it for money."
The doctor in John wars with the soldier, but he recognises the need to see things through first. "Are you sure you’re up to it?"
Then it's just hard and fast, Jim preceding violently to rail Sebastian, punching a series of grunts out of Sebastian's throat as he struggles to maintain his hold on the headrests.
I try again,  "I have hurt you." There it is, honest.
“A word, John,” Lestrade nods his head in the direction of the kitchen.
Sherlock makes a sympathetic noise as he reads the back of the potato packet for the instructions. “Rosie wondered about a walk tonight. I’m happy to take her if you would prefer some peace and quiet alone.”
There is an accusation in that comment that is not framed as a question. Somehow, John has decided that there is blame to be doled out and is trying to twist things so that it belongs with Sherlock. Maybe it's best to try to find a way to take the steam out of this conversation. "I had to speak to Stella because she was the one who made the offer. I wanted to talk to Joanna to plan how to present the idea to you."
Irina is still not satisfied, and shoves Janine's back again. "Tilt your hips into his, tuck in your bum; your thighs have to touch, or you won’t be able to feel him signalling the steps until it’s too late.”
The words could have been cruel, delivered differently. But the red-headed stranger kept her tone equable, even a bit warm.
The agent in question, whom John realises he
John slumped in his chair. Without much mental input, he had found himself en route to Baker Street instead of home to Mary’s flat. Once inside, he’d hastily decoded the rest of the message. His pen had scarcely finished the last stroke before his mobile had rung. The voice on the other end was mechanical, but the person behind the familiar cloak-and-dagger routine was unmistakable.
And so Sherlock leaned down and did just that. He kissed him like it was their first time, kissed him like they didn’t have enough time in the world, kissed him like it was the last chance they had to. His once numb body was beginning to feel again, the warmth from John’s touches spreading through him like wildfire. It was all tongue and messy and probably not appropriate for the public (or his brother’s) eye, but Sherlock really couldn’t find it in him to care whatsoever. All that mattered right now was this, was him, was John.
He finally found all of his clothes, slipping on his underwear, then his pajama pants and a long sleeved shirt, yanking up the sleeves to his elbows. John smiled a bit, watching him shake his hair out, his curls bouncing around briefly before turning to face them.
“I’m sorry...did I wake you?” he asked briskly, and John shook his head, sitting up.
Robert’s mouth fell open, sputtering as he fought to find words. John was smiling softly from his chair, relaxing a bit and watching the scene play out.
He frowned a bit, jogging after him to catch up. “Sherlock, what are you doing?” He remained silent for a moment, scanning the street before raising his hand in the air.
“I’ll sleep after I see Rosie…” he mumbled into his skin, and John smiled at that, dropping his hand from his curls.
In an instant, John was suddenly illuminated in a harsh, bright spotlight, coming from the opposing side of the theatre, near the top of the building. Sherlock squinted, watching John jump in surprise as Moriarty laughed softly, turning to glance at Sherlock. “Your boyfriend has quite the stage presence.”
“Will you stop saying that?! For God’s sake, Sherlock, WHY doesn’t it concern me?!” Sherlock seemed startled at his sudden change in tone; he winced slightly, meeting John’s gaze once more with a furrowed brow as John barrelled on.
Sherlock’s voice on a loop, the only noise he could recall from his nightmare;
Sherlock had opted for shoving his hands into his coat pockets, staring absentmindedly at something above John’s head, blinking slowly.
“Car accident, they died instantly.” He shrugged a bit, looking back towards him and meeting his eyes. “It happens.”
“Brother mine, how nice of you to call.”
Sherlock smiled and slid off the counter, waving him out. “Go see your daughter, I’ll finish this.” John huffed loudly at him in an attempt to show him he was being a smart ass once again, but Sherlock merely ignored him and turned to the now boiling kettle as John walked out, making a beeline for the door and opening it.
It took him awhile to fall back asleep. He hadn’t been able to remember much of the dream at all, save for one thing that kept bouncing around his mind as he watched his boyfriend snore, running his fingertips along the top of his pale arm.
“I don’t know, asshole! Figure it out yourself!” Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly, watching as the man lifted up his wrist to look at his watch, sighing loudly. “For God’s sake, I’m late to the Shakespeare festival…” Sherlock immediately froze up, watching the man turn and begin to stride away before his senses caught back up with him and he ran ahead to catch up.
“Plans change, especially my own ones,” Moriarty replied coolly, turning his head slightly to face him. “Besides, how else are we going to know if you picked the right bottle?”
There was a sudden, blood curdling scream directly behind their bench, and they whipped their heads around instantly, as did majority of the people there. John craned his neck, peering over the tops of heads to see as they both stood up. He saw a sudden lurch in the crowd, all of them gravitating towards a large building on the left. Sherlock stepped forward immediately, already weaving himself in between people before calling back behind him.
He supposed that time had finally come.
“Sherlock, please…” His voice was wavering, and Sherlock winced at his facial expression, eyes squeezed shut and his mouth pressed into a tight line. Moriarty merely hummed, pressing his gun deeper into the skin of his temple, staring Sherlock down with his hazy blue eyes.
"I'm using John's room for storage. But you can use my bedroom while your flat is being painted."
you I have worked with challenging individuals before. In fact, I tend to be drawn to people of outstanding intelligence and power, as groupie-like as that may sound. There is always a reason why they have reached as high as they have, and I find it fascinating to get to know such people!"
Sherlock’s brain was running a mile a minute, his eyes scanning the area around his flat. He could feel his heart rate begin to speed up slightly, his hands clenching and unclenching inside of his pockets. Nothing looked out of place or weird; frankly, it all seemed to blur together. Same sidewalk, same street signs, same street lights…
“Daddy, look…” Her voice sounded oddly close to tears and John turned his head, his stomach sinking as soon as he saw it.
Molly left a few minutes later, after checking the time and remembering her plans for an early night in. John thanked her and showed her out, walking her downstairs and outside to her cab before coming back up. Sherlock was up from his chair now, Rosie back on his hip as he took her black shoes and socks off carefully, setting them down on the table.
