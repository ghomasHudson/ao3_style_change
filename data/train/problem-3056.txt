Cas’s smile grows while he skims over it a few times. Calmly, he closes the cover and moves the book and his tea cup off to one side. “That’s a good ending, although it does have a few loose ends you should tie up. For example –”
, Dean. You and Sam both.”
books – stacked in towers within reach of the bed.
The boy in the bed looks smaller and more fragile than the one Castiel has gotten to know over the last several days. Maybe it’s just an effect of seeing him in a hospital bed. The beep of the machines has a calming affect on him and Castiel drags a chair to the side of the bed. He resists the urge to hold Dean’s hand. It feels wrong to touch the solid body without knowing of Dean is really in there or not.
. Savvy?”
“Can I kiss you too?” Dean whispers and Castiel can feel the movement of his lips.
fashion – both in killing and in choosing their targets.
The mouth of the cave is wide, but it narrows significantly less than a dozen meters in. Dean carries a torch in hand with his shield, holding it high enough to see the way the tunnel twists out of sight around a bend. Before he reaches it, the ground shakes with the footsteps of a beast far bigger than himself and he tosses the torch aside, ready for what is about to come.
Dean doesn't bother lifting his cheek from the back of Cas's neck. He's comfortable stretched out across his back like this and he can feel Cas's voice reverberate under his scales when he talks. “The council takes place on an island just under a massive waterfall. It's cut it's way through the side of the mountain and the river almost looks like it's spilling from the mouth of a Dragon.”
’ bullshit with me. You knew what I was from the day we met.” He actually bangs his hand on the wheel this time before they come to a sudden stop at a red light. “And you love me for it.”
Finally! It’s going to try to blind him. Dean is prepared for this and he raises his shield to cover his eyes. Any blow he expects after that never comes and the cave grows dark again. Slowly, Dean lowers his shield to glance over its edge, surprised by what he finds. The dragon has taken a human form and Dean can see now that it is male. He stands naked on thick legs ending in clawed paws no different from his dragon form, a closed bulge between his legs where his genitals would be.
It is, perhaps, not the wisest of ideas for him to be smug right now, but Castiel can’t help it. He smiles and wastes no time in satisfying his own dark urges, driving the knife deep into Marv’s gut. A rush of exhilaration spreads through him like a pleasant shiver and Castiel sighs softly as he pulls the knife out. That wasn’t a killing blow, but it must certainly be painful. He feels satisfied with it, and he knows something else that will satisfy him more – seeing Dean happy.
This time, Dean’s glare only lasts a moment before he sighs. “Fine.”
Claws drag through his hair and Dean feels a kiss get pressed to the crown of his head. “I have seen nothing that shines brighter than you.
“To what do I owe this visit so soon before daybreak, your highness?” Castiel has been here long enough to have seen the young king grow from an infant to the ruler who stands before him now. Their relationship has always been one of understanding and kindness, almost friendship, though the times of late have tested that. War with the invaders has weakened many bonds within the confines of the keep.
The inside of the church is pretty dilapidated – and Dean doesn’t use ten dollar words like that lightly. One of the towers is almost completely crumbled, the stairwell full of rubble and shit that no sane person would try to climb through. The place kind of reminds Dean of all the pictures he’s seen of that bigass cathedral in France.
Carefully, Cas stands and puts the mirror on a shelf draped in silk. He slides onto the bed again, kneeling above Dean. His claws drag lightly over Dean’s face, catching on his lips before he leans in for a soft kiss as his answer. He tastes like sunlight and his skin is warm under Dean’s hands as he touches all that he can in gentle sweeps of his calloused fingers.
. Dean is going to get to touch him and hug hum and if Cas is comfortable enough for it, he might actually even get to
Dean waves his hand and rolls his eyes, hovering back away from the bed for a few feet. “I
The whole elevator shakes and Dean can actually
“I’m not sure.” Cas frowns down at his hand. “I have never done this before. And I should offer my apologies. Had I known this is where we would be putting it, I would not have asked you to remove your shirt. All the times that I have heard of this being done, it has been placed on the chest or shoulder.”
The moment his hooves are on free ground, Dean crushes Sam in a tight hug. “I’ll make introductions later. Just trust me when I say that Cas is a good guy.”
“Yes’sir.”
“There.” He gestures at it and steps away. “The safety of these children is more important than my own vanity”
Anything Dean was going to say gets stuck in his throat. Cas’s eyes are enchanting. There’s untold years and power behind them. Dean can feel it, pushing into his head and bringing words into his mind that he didn’t know before. This is his sire. The head of his coven. The oldest of all of them and Dean knows this without really knowing
“No, Dean, I am

decision to head on up and take a look at it too.
The moment Dean lifts the gun, the Gargoyle’s eyes light up again. In one bounding leap, he’s across the tower and yanking the gun from Dean’s hand before he can even switch off the safety and cock the hammer, let alone pull the trigger. There’s an oddly satisfying (and extremely bone chilling) crunch as the gun crumples in the Gargoyle’s hand.
Dean’s only contribution to the entire conversation before the house lights go down is a marriage proposal. That gets brushed off with a group laugh, but Dean does lean in and whisper in his ear during the previews. “When did you get to be such a hardcore geek?”
Dean can't remember the last time he's been this happy. This isn't the first time that he's been thankful that his flock left him behind. If they hadn't done that, he never would have found Cas. If it weren't for Cas, Dean probably wouldn't even be alive – let alone actually accepting himself, wings and all.
“I wasn’t going to. We’ve been living in peace with that wendigo for years and we were forced to kill it when it started drawing too much attention to this area. We’ve been hiding here quietly, away from hunters like you.” Cas shrugs and puts the blood on the table next to Dean’s wallet. “Had I known you were a hunter, let alone the son of
you to get real friends. Do you remember me telling you that? I'm pretty sure I did when you started getting into that whole forum scene.”
He shouldn’t be this wound up. This is just another night out with Cas, but it holds the very real possibility of ending with a goodnight kiss and Dean hasn’t kissed Cas since they ten years old and hung blankets up around his bunk bed to make a fort so they could practice kissing in secret. Dean’s had lots of practice with other people since then and he knows he’s good but what he knows isn’t the same as Cas knowing. It’s getting to give Cas firsthand knowledge that’s giving him the nervous sweats.
“I know that, Castiel. Truly, I do. It’s the council who sees you as property of the castle; decorations we can call on to do our bidding when we need it.” The young king turns to him, his eyes filled with pain as he reaches up to put his hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “I come to you as a friend and as an ally to

Now he can forget about the dagger. Dean stabs it into the wall, hoping the ship will forgive him for it. This is pretty important, after all. He forces his arms under Cas’s back and pulls him up until he’s nearly sitting in his lap, close enough to kiss again. His coat, waist coat, and the remains of his shirt fall away and
“I told my mother I would be sleeping over at your house tonight.” Cas snags Dean’s arm and starts pulling him toward the lineup. “We have that project we need to work on this weekend, remember?”

Dean doesn’t get it. Everyone else seems plenty happy with staying here and none of them have tried escaping. He taps his hoof against the rock he’s draped himself over, chin propped in his hands as he surveys the enclosure.
Dean picks up one of the knives laid out on the table and taps the flat of the blade against Marv’s cheek. “You liked my pies but didn’t want to pay for them? You should’ve made better life choices. Bet you didn’t know that the fee for that would be this steep, huh?”
Dean Winchester, Sam Winchester, Castiel, GIlda, (unnamed: Balthazar, Rachel, Anna, Hannah, Samandriel, Inias)
“I wonder why, sometimes.” Castiel looks away but he still leans into Dean’s side when he’s tugged across the seat under his arm. Dean presses a kiss to his cheek and Castiel melts into him. “Yes, of course I do. Idiot.”
Sounds are getting duller and the room is getting darker, despite the flames licking at the remains of the wendigo. He can barely make out the shapes getting closer across the room. People, from the looks of it. A half dozen, maybe more. Only one of them keeps approaching, stepping over the wendigo pile like it’s no big deal that part of it is still on fire or something. Dean can only make out bits and pieces of the man – a trench coat to his knees, stubble, and sharp blue eyes that spark with something almost inhuman. Although that could just be him on the brink of death and all.
.” Dean rolls his eyes and holds the button that keep the door open. “Would you just get on already?”
That is all that they need. Together they follow Gilda through the portal she wove into the air and soon after, they sleep in a circle with claws and fangs bared. Even here, they want to strike fear into the hearts of those who would dare to approach them in their vulnerable stone sleep.
“Do you know what kind of dragon I’ll be dealing with?” Dean asks, tucking the bag of coins into his saddlebag. “Is it our standard fire breather or did you luck out and get one of the special ones?”
He ignores Henrikson’s protests and crosses the street with Dean at his side. They have the warrant and Castiel doesn’t hesitate to kick the door in, gun already drawn and aimed for the couch. The man isn’t even given the chance to get to his feet. By the time Castiel has him in handcuffs, Henrikson is there too.
Cas raises his eyebrow and he’s in mid-nod when Dean shuts the door. His face is bright red in the mirror hanging beside the door as he locksit for good measure. He can’t look at himself. All Dean can do is put his back to the door and sink down to sit on the floor, his face in his hands. This can’t actually be happening. He can’t

It’s the same kind of teasing comment he’s made since he discovered the hardly used dirty magazines (a mixture of both gay and straight) under Castiel’s bed on his third night bothering him. And it still makes Castiel blush. He can feel it burning in his ears and he frowns at Dean. To anyone else, it would look like he’s frowning at the door. Dean’s laughter sounds odd compared to the clinical atmosphere before he ducks through the closed door to join Sam.
“Why do the Fey come with this this offer?”

“This puts us in a difficult situation.” Dean sighs, taking the torch when the dragon offers it. “You’re not doing anyone any harm, but I was hired to kill you. If I go, I need to return with some kind of proof that you’re actually, well,
“You need to gain their trust.” He explains, lifting one of the young children to balance her on his hip. “We do not easily trust any creature save another dragon. What you need is a dragon-mark to prove that you are trusted by one of us.”
Dean swallows thickly. “You.” He pauses and licks his lips. “You, Cas, I want
“Good. I would hate for anything to happen to you.” Cas pauses, looking away as his tail twitches. “The children would be devastated.”
to go make sure the plants are alright. Otherwise Cas will skin him alive and use him as fertilizer – and Dean has that threat in writing.
“Hey, Cas. Lemme take a look.” Dean shoves down his own natural panic at an elevator coming to a stop and puts a hand on Cas's shoulder to get him out of the way.
awake, then you need to let me sleep now.”
. The slap from before is making his ears ring and there’s not a whole lot he can do when his damn feet aren’t even touching the ground or without knowing what happened to his bag and all his supplies.
He pulls his gloves off, flexing his fingers and looks over the stark, twisting lines of the dragon-mark. “Very well. They calmed down the moment I showed the mark and promised not to touch the farmers’ cattle.”
“What other choice do we have?” His golden haired brother shrugs and looks to the others. “How long will it take us to find a new home? How will we know that we’ll be safe during the day?”
“You’ll still be useful to me, Dean. Now shut up and start reading.”
“You’re children.” He shrugs and stands, stretching his legs. “Children should be taken care of.”
Castiel crosses his arms and his frown gets deeper. “For different reasons, apparently.”
It has a nice clear
Truthfully, Castiel knows that he’s being selfish by keeping this information from Dean. He hates himself for it and it’s a smoldering, angry pit inside of him that he does his best to ignore. It’s easier if he rationalizes it away. Dean is

A harsh laugh punches out of him and Dean spreads his arms. “Really? You think your magic can do anything for
After a few minutes, Castiel looks out the window beside the bed. His thoughts drift over what happened to Dean and whether or not he returned to his body. If he did, will he remember him? Without realizing it, Castiel starts humming the song Dean would hum for him at night. He forgets the name, and some of the tune, but he’s fairly sure that he gets most of it.
He needs a good way to do this. Dean just doesn’t know
When Dean’s phone rings in his pocket, it startles them both and they pull away sharply, their breathing just a tad heavier. Castiel’s lips tingle and he touches them lightly while Dean answers his phone.

He forces himself to look away from the blood pack to meet Cas’s eyes again. “What. Did. You. Do. To. Me.” His voice only shakes slightly.
“What do you want, mystic? We have no quarrel with you or your kind.”
It’s easier to move around in his Human form. Nothing much changes about the shape of his legs, but he’s smaller and less clumsy like this, and he doesn’t need his wings to crawl around through the cave. Having actual
That’s yet another thing that Castiel has kept from Dean.
The smile Dean gives him bright and so very happy. Simply looking at it makes Castiel’s heart flutter around his chest. He can’t help responding with a smile of his own as he tugs lightly at Dean’s wrist. They might have a few more minutes for another kiss. Dean’s smile grows and he leans in again.
“Hello, princess.” Dean lifts one of the girls into his arms when she runs to meet him. “Were you waiting for me? Where are the others?”
He frowns and leans in closer. “And yet… There’s something about you, Dean.”
Castiel nods and he feels Dean’s hand close around his on the seat between them. He squeezes it back and the moment Sam looks down at the remainder of his pie, they share a knowing look. Of all the people in Boston, only they know what happened to the people in Sam’s folders – and it’s a secret they can never share with him.
Cas sits quietly through the questions. Nodding and answering calmly. Dean’s actually pretty proud of him for calming down so quickly. Even stuck in the elevator, he had no problem with Dean putting an arm around his shoulder and hugging him tight. As long as Dean kept him breathing and kept him counting, everything went pretty well after their talk.
As Cas's frown deepens, Dean takes his thumb off the button and steps to the back of the elevator – which doesn't take much. This thing could hold
He wonders if someone would think him crazy for not being scared of Dean right now. There is every possibility that if he pushes Dean’s buttons too much, he could be the next one on the table. And yet, Castiel knows that Dean would never hurt him. He knowsthat Dean loves him too much for that to ever happen. And this isn’t the first time over the years that they’ve had this fight before. It always works out in the end. Castiel just needs to remind Dean that he can’t be so selfish. He can be rather childish sometimes. Now happens to be one of those times and Dean refuses to hand over the knife.
“Yes, Dean. But after you have helped me put the children to bed.”
At least Cas's practiced answer to every request always brightens Dean's mood – though he can't help the worry that one Dragon is going to come along and Cas won't turn them down.
Castiel is prepared for this. He has a lock picking set in his pocket and it doesn’t take him more than a few moments to get the handcuffs unlocked. Sam all but throws himself out of the bed and wraps Castiel in a hug, burying his face against his chest to hide his sniffles. There’s no need for Dean’s instructions here. Castiel hugs him in his place.
have been more careful. But how was he supposed to know that the gypsy would shout gibberish at him after a particularly prosperous game of chance that had been slightly rigged in Dean’s favour? And is it
Dean resists his natural impulse to wince at the accusation. He’s never known a dragon to use words over action. Is it really his fault that he was going on instinct? Attack first, ask questions later. It’s always worked for him before. He saw no need to change it now.

“They’re going to have your badge for this, detective.”
a half dozen other men all cursed like him; half-man, half-goat.
Cas looks up at him from under his bangs. One ear twitches before they both droop and his shoulder slump a little more. “I’m not cursed. I never was.” He sighs and gestures at himself from head to hoof. “I was born like this. I’m a Satyr.”
Alright, so, strong as fuck
Cas’s snort of surprise nearly dislodges Dean from leaning on him. “You are aware that Satyrs are some of the most sexually active creatures known to man, right?”
“How many Dragons are going to be there?” He shouts out himself, trying hard not to think about whether or not they're going to welcome a couple Wyverns – and if they'll make fun of him for his deformed wings.
Cas’s counting stops and he puts his head back on Dean’s shoulder, eyes closed. “I was ashamed.” When Dean doesn’t say anything, Cas continues. “There was nothing I was afraid of when I was an angel, and you - you relied on me so much. For everything.”
panicked and Cas is probably about a minute away from an all out break down.
Maybe. Dean doesn’t really know what to expect. Cas doesn’t look like he’s lying, and despite Dean's doubts, a part of him is desperate enough to want to trust him. He'd spent most of the night thinking about it and he has no argument for why they

Miraculously, they manage to fit everything on his horse. It would have slowed him down to have to rent a cart as well. It is but a few day’s ride to Cas’s valley and Dean arrives just as dusk is creeping into the skies. To his surprise, he finds Cas and the children outside. Cas is sitting on a rock with one of the older girls kneeling before him, her back to him as he brushes her hair with his claws. The others are chasing bouncing balls of light, laughing loudly when they collide and explode into hundreds of smaller lights that race around until they join together again.
' when she showed up with markers and cardboard and all that. It was kind of fun to make it, but Dean does feel a little embarrassed to be standing there with the sign over his head. It's not like Cas wouldn't be able to recognize him without it.

Dean shields his head with his arm and staggers to his feet as the other children, all of varying ages, come forward. Each of them has a small arsenal of stones and they don’t hold back with pelting them at him until he is several feet away from the dragon. He can’t help but take note of the tears in their eyes or how the youngest drop their rocks and run to the dragon as he sits up.
that already. You’re the only one who can see or hear me.” He grins and floats forward again, his knees passing through the edge of the bed. “Besides, you’re the cutest.”
Even in a Human form, the Dragon is still beautiful. His tail twists behind him as he takes a few steps into the cave, claws digging into the dirt. Orbs of light form in the air around the Dragon and dance along the ceiling of the cave until the whole area is as bright as day. Dean hisses again and hopes he’s big enough to hide Sam too.
The smile is wiped from Cas's face, replaced with a slow blink of surprise. “I'm... sorry?”
driven to the other side of the fucking country if it was financially possible. But he can't afford to take the time off. Not with food to buy and rent, bills, and tuition to pay.
wanted to take the stairs.” He sucks in deep, quick breaths and starts struggling to undo his coat, fingers slipping on the zipper and the buttons.
The dark haired sister huffs a soft laugh. She looks lost and Castiel’s heart aches at the memory of the clutch of eggs she had in the hatchery. “We have no way of being sure.”
He hangs up and all but sprints to the arrival gate. There's a sign tucked under his arm that Jess helped him make last night. She thought it would be cute (and Dean kind of agreed with her) and it's not like he could've told her '
On the day Dean chooses to leave, not having stayed more than a week, the children circle around him and his horse. The youngest cling to his legs. “Don’t go!” “You’ll come back, right?” “Stay, stay!” And the oldest tug at his arms. “Teach us how to use the sword!” “We want to protect Cas too!”
“Yes, Dean.” He mumbles, squeezing his eyes shut while Dean uses the knuckle of his wing to rub him roughly on the crown of his head.
“Look out!” The youngest cries and Castiel tucks his wings in, tumbling to the side and out of the way of a volley of arrows.
The dragon stoops to pick up Dean’s shield too. “I can see your conundrum. I am not dead and you no longer desire to kill me – for which I am thankful. What can I do to help? What proof do you usually take back?”
, Cas. You need to go find Sam!”
Knowing that he would finally have the chance to touch Dean was one of the things that had kept Castiel calm during the plane ride. His fingers twitch with the desire to hold Dean’s hand while he follows him to the Impala. Castiel doesn’t care so much about the possibility of having sex with Dean during this visit. He would be just as happy to leave without having sex as he would be with having it. All Castiel wants is to be here with Dean. He wants to sleep beside him, to hug him, and perhaps even finally have his first kiss.
In human form, the dragon is perhaps a few inches taller than Dean with his horns and a tail twists down behind his legs. His skin holds the same colour as his scales did; a blue verging nearly on white and his design still glows faintly all over his body. The dragon’s eyes no longer shine in this form. In the flickering light of the dying torch, the dragon’s blue eyes watch Dean with nothing short of contempt.
. Speaking of…” He twirls his finger in a circle and Sam rolls his eyes, turning around until Dean can grab the young master by his hair and lift his head. A pleasant thrill runs down his spine at the challenging blue eyed glare that meets him. An angry growl is muffled under the gag and it only intensifies when he pats the young man on the cheek. “Don’t be thinking about even trying to invoke
“About the time I realized if I wanted you to want me too, I should probably give your interests a chance.” Cas smiles at him in the dark and slides his arm through Dean’s, linking their fingers when he finds his hand over the cup holder. “You’re lucky I found them all just as fascinating as you.”
“What?” He can’t be serious. “Why would we – why would you – you're a
and shit and I couldn’t stop thinking about, like, what if I don’t smell good to you or something? It’s been bugging me all week.”
“Are you okay, sir?” Sam looks up at him, a confused frown on his face.
Cas leans his head forward and out of kissing range, but he doesn't say anything against it and that warms Dean's insides better than the heating system of the building. Dean rises up on the tips of his toes to reach the back of Cas's neck over the edge of his scarf for one more kiss before he steps back – just in case anyone else decides to stop the elevator and squeeze themselves in too. He shoves his hands in his pockets and watches the ancient screen above the doors tick through what floor they're passing.
That settles the decision for Castiel rather quickly. He makes sure to return the laptop to Sam’s office in precisely the same location before he takes his place at the dinner table again. Castiel pats Dean’s knee and listens to the conversation with half an ear, his mind already whirring with plans for how to deal with Mr. Metatron.
Castiel frowns and calls for Charlie. As soon as she pokes her head in the door, he points at the email. “Find out how often Mr. Winchester has had contact with this address.”
The Dragon does none of that. Instead, he crouches on his haunches, eyes bright. “Show me. Perhaps it’s something I can assist with?”
to focus on for more than a minute at a time.

“We don’t need saving.” The oldest draws his arm back again, but the dragon is already on his feet and he grabs the boy’s wrist.

accept a ride back – which makes Dean totally okay with meeting at the theater instead.
If they’re lucky, it won’t be during the day. His clan can do nothing to protect themselves during the stone sleep. They are all but forced to accept the help of the Humans, trusting them to be their guards when the rising sun turns them to stone. It’s the Humans’ job to watch over his clan and their hatchery, kept safe in the caverns under the castle – just as it is his clan’s duty to guard the Humans when the moon takes to the sky.
“Hold on, Cas. Hold on.” Dean digs his phone out of his pocket and sends a quick text off to Sam. Whatever he can do to get these doors open faster, he's gotta do it. And may Sam might have some tips for calming down a panic attack.
“You always bring me something, Dean.” He takes it gently, smiling softly as he uses his claws to break the twine holding everything together.
Castiel uses his phone and sends a text to Charlie instead. It’s safer. There might be someone listening in on the police scanner. Charlie’s answer is almost instantaneous. The warrant was issued just a few minutes ago.
late on today of all days. He clears his throat and holds out the sign. “I made you this. Well, Jess helped.”
Dean kisses him into the pillow as Cas returns the touch with much less skill but no less the fervor until it’s Dean’s turn to tremble above him, his own release joining the mess on Cas’s stomach. They wipe it away with Cas’s wrap and Dean folds him in the pelt he uses as a blanket, holding him tight to his chest. Cas is content to fall asleep like that, but Dean takes a little longer; his mind still working.
This has got to be some powerful fucking magic to bring people back from the edges of death better than they were before. He opens his eyes one at a time, squinting until his eyes adjust to the light and he can see – in ridiculously stark detail – the man above him. “So, you’re a hunter?”
modern!AU, creature!Dean (temporary)
“Maybe afterward.” Castiel says instead, guiding Sam toward the door. It’s not a ‘yes’, and it isn’t a ‘no’. “We need to take you to the hospital and get you checked out first.”
“I thought you were sleeping.” Dean sits up in his bed at the sound of Cas’s hooves on the wood floor of the cabin Sam had found for them.
to know, even if he has to whisper to get the question past the lump in his throat. “What are you?”
He leaves the room and Dean takes that opportunity to test the ropes. They’re pretty damn tight and he’s pretty sure he’s not going to be able to break them. With those a lost cause, he props himself up on his elbows and takes a look around. The room is about expected of a cabin. There’s a chair on his left and judging by the things piled on the shelves behind him, Dean thinks he’s currently strapped to what was once a desk. A bed sits off to one corner, and all the three windows – one on each each wall except for the wall with the door – are covered. Literally not a speck of light is getting through them and Dean wonders if it’s because it’s night time right now, or because they’re that heavily shaded.
“Yes, I understand that part. I meant,
life. For Cas, this is normal. This is his life, and he’s accepted it.
Castiel glares at him from across the table, feeling slightly vindictive with what he chooses to say next. “You
Contrary to what Dean thinks, it was Sam’s panic button that saved his life. The police were on scene within minutes of him receiving the blow to the back of his head. There are a few theories about what happened after that. Some of the investigators believe that the kidnappers didn’t have the time to carry a fully grown, unconscious, nineteen year old to their get-away car. Others think that Sam went willingly to either keep them from hurting him (or Dean) any more, or possibly so they would leave Dean behind.
“Sam!” Dean scrambles to his hooves and all but skips across the enclosure to the bars that separate him from freedom and the rest of humanity. “What took you so long?”
“Give me the knife, Dean.” Castiel says firmly.
He starts with watering the outside plants with the hose before working his way through the inside with the watering can. Actually, it’s more like a jug, but Dean isn’t picky about his word use. As long as the job gets done in the end, it’s all the same shit – just in different piles.
but in person they could be totally different.
Cas is not as gentle with undressing Dean and shoves his coat from his shoulders roughly. He fumbles between them to undo the belt and untuck the scarf it covers, both wrapped around Dean’s waist. The whole bed shakes when Cas falls back to the pillows, pulling Dean down onto his hands above him as he tugs the shirt over Dean’s head. They don’t bother with getting his boots and pants off. His prick is freed almost as soon as the draw on his pants is undone and they’re shoved down his hips.
This is the first return home since he learned the children call him papa. It still warms Dean to his core, but he learned more that day than he knew what to do with. Already he has been here for three days and he still has yet to give Cas the present he brought for him. He doesn’t like the nerves that stay his hand or twist in his heart.
She flashes a grin at him, her red hair spilling out from under her hat. “Aye aye, captain!” The rudder creaks far below their feet as she turns the wheel, eyeing the compass hanging in a glass case at it’s unmoving center.
? This is unlike any hunt Dean has ever had and even though he always welcomes the challenge of the unexpected, this is starting to rankle his nerves. Not understanding a dragon’s motives is never very enjoyable.
His stomach clenches hungrily and Dean looks down at his clawed feet, trying not to notice the wide-eyed look Sam is giving him over his shoulder. Sam had a few canyon rats as dinner, but Dean hasn’t eaten since yesterday morning when he managed to snatch up a few toads while he tried to catch some fish in the stream. Even though he’s done his best, neither of them have had a proper meal in the time that they’ve been here.
Nodding, Dean tugs the reigns to turn his horse toward the path back to town. “Are all dragons as nice as you?”
It is a struggle, but Castiel fights back the storm of rage and pain in his chest. He failed as a leader and he cannot let it happen again. No matter what his sister says, Castiel cannot afford to be so cavalier with his trust. His wings drape around his shoulders and Castiel rises to his full height, head held high.
He doesn't answer, but Dean didn't really expect him to.
doesn't like seeing him upset. It makes his chest pinch uncomfortably and Dean will do everything that he can to help him.
“Yes.” He nods and pads over to the torch, picking it up. “Here they don’t have to whore themselves out to indecent individuals for barely enough coin to feed themselves. Here they do not go hungry and they do not freeze. I take care of them.”
He pouts and sits on the edge of the desk. “Fine. But don’t take too long. I want to get there before dark. It’ll be way too fucking creepy if we go after sunset.”
“It should be enough.” Dean shrugs, unable to look away. Is the dragon really going to break off one his own horns for this?
At least Sam doesn’t seem to mind. He’s the only creature in the whole world who doesn’t look at Dean like it’s a surprise that he’s still alive. If anything, Sam looks at Dean like he’s the greatest Wyvern to ever live. He always makes a big deal out of it when Dean returns with something to eat, even if it’s just a small rabbit. It warms Dean’s heart even as his stomach goes empty, a lie on his tongue that he ate while he was hunting.
Another blush creeps into Cas’s cheeks and he ducks his head as he slides into the front seat. Dean slips in behind the wheel and taps the radio. “You alright with my classic rock?”
While it rings, he makes a joke over his shoulder to Cas . “Hope this isn't because of that ghost we're here to gank.”
This is not the first time Dean has crawled into the bed of a man, but it
“I hope Sammy wasn’t too rough with you,
Castiel frowns and catches Dean’s wrist as he moves to plunge the knife into his chest. “It’s my turn, Dean!”
Cas hunts for them every day and he's shown them the best plants to eat when their stomachs are upset. He's taught both of them plenty about living off the land with all sorts of vegetables – too bad that Dean loves meat and Wyvern aren't all that omnivorous. Dean needs meat and it stings his ego every time someone else has to hunt for him. It hurt when it was the flock and it hurts now too – worse even, now that Sam is big enough to start flying which means he'll start hunting too and soon Dean is going to be completely useless to everyone around him.
“I threw the book across the room after the first paragraph and spent the last hour face down on my bed plotting the various ways I’m going to kill you.” Cas’s cheeks start getting red and his hands shake a little at his sides. “Do you have
Dean grins and hops down to the deck. He jerks a thumb over his shoulder to the double doors at the stern of the ship. “My quarters, Sammy. I’ll be dealing with him
Cas opens his mouth but nothing comes out. He blushes, ducks his head, and tries again. “Yes, I think that would be fine.”
“This kinda sucks, huh?” He wiggles his fingers and Castiel has to squint to make them out. “Isn’t that how it goes with ghosts though? They move on after their unfinished business is taken care of? You found Sam and now I’m good and ready to go.”
She raises an eyebrow curiously and nods, gesturing for the yellow haired twins to remain where they are. Though they aren’t truly twins, they both bear the same golden hair and have always been referred to as such – despite their dislike for it. Rarely do they actually get along. Castiel has been friends with his blonde brother since their days in the hatchery and his blonde sister is loyal and steadfast whenever he calls upon her.
not appreciated right now. “Come on. Just breathe and really think about it. How long have you and Cas been doing the online dating thing?”
as family and that – Dean's almost certain that's not something that he wants.
: Dean Winchester, Sam Winchester, Castiel
, as their new owners and every high class gawker seems to enjoy calling them. It got under Dean’s skin at first, but after a few weeks now, he can mostly ignore it. The jeers and insults are only fuel for his desire to escape. If he can get away from this humiliation, maybe he can find Sam and a cure and get back to his normal self.
When they step together, Dean’s arms come up to wrap tightly around his shoulders. Castiel fits his arms around Dean’s waist and rests his cheek on his collarbone. His nose is brushing Dean’s throat and he smells even better than he did in the car. Dean gives good hugs. It’s nice and tight, and he’s very comfortable to lean against. He hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder and squeezes him tightly, not wanting to let go just yet. A shiver chases down his spine when a breath passes over his ear.
It’s a question that catches both Dean and Sam off guard. They share a confused look before turning back to the Dragon as he stands to his full height again. “If I’m not mistaken, Wyvern are normally aerial hunters, yet neither of you can fly. Have you been able to get enough food?”
“You come here.” Sam laughs. “Take the short way down. Over.”
“I understand. Sleep well, my old friend.”
The wendigo doesn’t seem to be around, but it can’t have gone far. They like to keep their meals fresh. It’ll be back soon and Dean won’t be living long after it is. He gets maybe a good ten minutes of struggling and trying to lift his legs to pull himself up or some shit (if fucking
His doubt and fear washes away with the wind when they break over the hills. Joy and relief seeps into his bones at the sight of the castle on the cliff, standing sturdy and unbroken. They glide on the winds, wings beating every so often to keep them aloft as they finally return to their ancestral home. This is where they belong and it is satisfying to be back again.
Dean hasn't. But who ever heard of Wyvern who can't fly? It's not something he's going to question. Dragons have a lot of time on their hands and their lives are long. They can do whatever they want and who would ever question them for it?

Almost everything they’ve done in their life together has been to benefit this second life of theirs. The home they chose is specifically on the bank of a river with their own private dock and a deep-sea fishing boat tied to it. That’s where they take Marv now, to the plastic covered room under the deck.
Seven days, twelve hours, forty-two minutes and eight seconds later, Castiel watches Dean reach up to unscrew the bulb over Marv’s front door. He’s holding a pizza box and Castiel is standing just out of sight. Dean has been keeping tabs on their target all week and they’re very pleased to have found that he’s upset several other people during that time. It means that when his past is looked into after he’s been reported missing (if anyone bothers to make that report), it will be less likely that they’ll be looked into as potential suspects.

that you don’t want to kiss me?”
Cas's breathing doesn't even out, but he does look a little less panicked. His hand shakes a little when he taps the spot next to him and Dean immediately shuffles over to sit there, making sure to leave as much room as he can so Cas doesn't feel like he's being boxed into the corner. After a moment, Cas reaches out to take his hand. It hurts a little with how hard he's squeezing it, but Dean rubs his thumb over the back of his knuckles anyways.
Fine. If Sam won't believe him, Dean'll pull out the big guns. “Of course I'm sure. You should've seen how he blushed the first time we jerked off on camera together.”
Cas watches silently as the excited children gather around. Dean uses his hands to measure across their shoulders and to their hips, marking the measurements in a book. As he does so, he explains his situation to Cas. By the end, the smile on Cas’s lips is almost smug.
But Castiel can barely focus on the movie. He’s caught up in the weight of Dean’s head on his shoulder and the warmth bleeding through his t-shirt against his side. Dean’s fingers twitch in his sleep and Castiel rubs his thumb over his knuckles, more fascinated with the calluses he can feel on his fingertips and palm than the movie.
And when that happens, maybe Sam will want to leave him too.

Castiel by the time they reach the car. Maybe Dean isn’t as into men as he thought he was? There is quite the difference between looking at gay porn and jerking off mutually on camera, and actually having to touch another man. That makes things
“You’re bound.”
Gargoyles flap up onto the top of the tower. Maybe he could make a break for the stairs – nope, there’s some coming up those too. Alright. So. Quick recap: Dean’s screwed seven ways from Sunday.
“You said you didn’t want to die. This was the only way to save you.”
“This is your nest and I won't intrude longer than you want me to.” Cas glances back at Dean and passes his hand over the orb again, dimming the glow. “I'd like to leave this canyon the morning, but I’m in no rush. I was on my way home from the council meeting at Dragon Falls and was looking for a place to spend the night when I found you.”
Dean spits out the blood pooling on his tongue. It’s hard to talk, but he coughs through it enough to get out; “I don’t want to die.”
. Sam wouldn’t mind travelling with another person. He would probably welcome Cas with open arms. It would mean more sleep and less time spent on watch while camping. It would mean having another contributor to their funds and another pair of hands that could craft or steal - whichever Cas is better at doing.
“I was thinking that I would take them on a trip, Raphael.” Cas answers smoothly, straightening his shoulders and standing as tall as he can. “Wyvern are naturally nomadic and these two have been living with me for the last year. Rather than leave them alone, I brought them with me to satisfy their desire for travel.”
Dean dips his head in a nod and tries not to blush when Cas pushes a hand through his hair. It's supposed to be a comforting gesture, but all it does is make Dean's heart race as he leans into the small touch. “Good. I have to go see how many have arrived so far. You two may explore if you want to, but I'll understand if you would rather wait for my return.”
In a dark alley on the twenty-third of June, four years prior to when they would eat pie at the Pie Hole with Sam, Castiel Collins met Dean Winchester for the very first time. Castiel was never scared of the dark, or the places most people wouldn’t dare to walk on at night. He doesn’t care about the scary things out there, though he didn’t know that Dean Winchester was one of them until that very night.
Castiel can’t answer him. The only reason he can think of that Dean would fade away is if his body did too. He needs to see for himself if that happened.
The moment Dean says '
“I know.” He huffs, wisps of his hair drifting away before curling back to his head. “How soon will they get through Azazel’s files?”
“Dude, you fugly.”
His heart seizes in his chest and Dean is almost sure that this is what cardiac arrest feels like. Cas didn’t read the rest of it? “How far did you get before you stopped?”
Dean loves Cas, he really does, but sometimes having him as his best friend is a pain in the ass. Specifically speaking, when Cas goes to visit family, Dean’s the one in charge of going over to his tiny ass little house to water his fifty bajillion plants. That’s probably an exaggeration, but not by much. Cas’s house is practically a jungle and when Dean walks in the front door on the first day to water them, he wonders if Cas has a machete around for him to hack his way to the kitchen and the water jug on the counter.
At least all his parts weren’t changed and those work properly. Really, it’s only his horns, fluffy tail, and legs that are goat-ish. Everything else is essentially normal, but Dean’s not sure that he can stop caring about the
To start, Cas has no problem eating the foliage decorating their enclosure where everyone else wouldn’t even think of it. Sometimes he doesn’t even touch the stew and bread that their newfound
“We’ve had reported sightings of ghosts and all sorts of crap out at that church for years.” Sam moves the file out of the way to keep working on his current report. “What makes these so special?”
It’s that heat flowing from Cas’s magic that truly aches. There’s something lonely and wanting wrapped in it and it pulls at Dean’s heart. That feeling cuts through him from start to finish and Dean can’t hold back from crying out. He grips at Cas’s arms and shoulders when Cas covers his mouth, digging his nails into the scale-hard skin that covers his arms from his elbow to his claw tips.
for Dean to be worrying over right now.
“Well, I figured that much out, genius.
As soon as he takes a step back, the Gargoyle’s hand closes around his shoulder and squeezes. “It wasn’t our intention to harm you. We only want you to leave our home.”
: modern AU
Cas nods again and with every breath in he counts one, and every breath out he counts two. They keep doing that together until Cas closes his eyes and leans into Dean's shoulder. He's still holding his hand and pretty much crushing it, but Dean doesn't mind it as long as Cas is comfortable. Cas is usually the level headed one between them and Dean
The Gargoyle stares down at Dean’s hand for a minute before he squints at him. He looks like he’s about ready to give him the same amount of trust Dean would have with leaving a cat and a mouse alone in a room together. “What are ‘
What he wouldn't give to have wings like that.
“Sister. Gather a few of our friends. We must visit the king’s war council before they take their nightly rest.”
“Why is it called Dragon Falls?” Sam asks, flying close enough to shout the question over the wind.
“Would it guarantee that the children would be safe? No one will bother us here?”
Dean is under the impression that he’s dead and Castiel hasn’t told him yet that the day they met was the day it had been officially announced that he was in a coma. Actually, shortly before Castiel had met Dean, he’d been assigned to waiting at the hospital for Dean to wake up so he could question him for anything helpful to the search to find Sam. While he was waiting, the diagnosis had been made and he’d returned to the station to help elsewhere.
“I promised to whisk you away for a life on the waves, Cas.” Dean loosens his grip in his hair, letting his hand slide around to rest against the side of Cas’s neck as his thumb strokes the hinge of his jaw. “Not even the sea could make me break my word to you.”

leaving this house again.
There’s a ragged tree growing close to the edge that Dean is confident he could climb to get up and down. But Sam is small and young. His wings (thankfully) aren’t crippled like Dean’s, but it will still be a month, maybe more, before he’ll be able to even try flying on his own. He’ll have to stay up here until he’s bigger.
He’s cut off before he even opens his mouth. “It was Dad, wasn’t it? He’s trying to frame Azazel’s company.”
Before the sun even reaches the lips of the canyon, they're already in the sky. Dean keeps Sam in front of him, caging him between his arms as he holds onto the feathered scales along the back of Cas's neck. The beat of Cas's massive wings can be felt all through his back and Dean can't help but be hypnotized by it. He barely takes his eyes off the flex of muscle and sinew for the entire flight.
He drops his voice to a near whisper. “What did you do to me?”
“For our safety as well as yours.” Heels thump on creaky wooden floors and Dean can pick out every sound. His hearing was
Dean groans and looks forward again when the light changes. “I wanted to, but I just – Sam gave me this whole lecture about
Castiel’s lip curls at the name the Humans gave them. They had no word for themselves before the Humans arrived. “We are not yours to command.”
Dean snorts and hugs his wings to his sides again, looking away. “How nice for them. Thanks for the lesson. You can leave now.”
They cut the boarding ropes and haul in the planks, raising anchor and dropping sail to ready their escape. Dean runs back and forth from stern to bow and back again, helping where help is needed. When the sails fill with the wind, Dean bounds up the steps to the wheel and his navigator.
The village head looks into the bag and frowns. “This is more than we gave you.”
“Oh? How come?” He sets her in the saddle and pulls a doll from one of the bags, offering it to her.
Dean laughs and pats his brother on the shoulder as he walks past, heading back into the kitchen to finish the preparations for the pies he’ll be making tomorrow. “Don’t worry about it!”
The Dragon tilts his head, glancing from Dean to Sam. “You’re too young to have a hatchling of your own. Is he your brother, then?”
Immediately, Dean tries sitting up and Castiel puts a hand on his shoulder to push him back down. He’s almost surprised that the touch doesn’t pass right through him. “Sam is fine. We found him and he’s in perfect health. He’ll be here soon and I’ll let him explain to you what happened. How does that sound?”

“Excellent.” He doesn’t even bother with the stairs, choosing to vault over the railing instead.

His heart just about jackhammers itself right out of his chest. A slap on the ass would have been preferable, to be honest. He turns around and has to force himself not to let his jaw drop. Usually Cas wears neutral colours and a Constantine-esque trench coat no matter what time of year it is. Today he’s got a gym bag over his shoulder and a bright red t-shirt with gold lettering spelling IRON MAN across his chest.
With a curious tilt to his head, Cas follows Dean out into the main cavern again where the children are starting to wake. The days after are busy as Dean gives them the lessons Cas didn’t know and never had the need to. It was Inias who patched their clothing and Dean shows them all how to do it properly, including how to make their own clothing. Cas pays close attention during the lessons regarding food and what they should eat and how to prepare it.
“And you've both been faithful, right?”
“Don’t worry. It’s just Sam getting us out.”
Castiel reaches across the bed for the call button, careful not to actually touch Dean as he pushes it to summon the nurses. “I know. How are you feeling, Dean?”

“Yes. I’m taking this up to interrogation.” Castiel highlights that specific section of the email and prints it.
, he must be on a table or something and the ropes are tied under it. “Untie me.”
His shoulders ache like a bitch when he wakes up. Dean has no idea how long he’s been out, but it’s long enough for his hands to go numb. He’d check his watch, but it’s digging into his skin and hidden under a metric fuck ton of rope – which is what’s over the hook and keeping him suspended from a goddamn ceiling. Well. This is just

“I have a few items that I need.” Dean shrugs and looks toward the mountains in the distance. “Fabric for clothing. Food – meat, and flour for bread. Wrap it well, I have a ways to go before I can use it.”
“For what?” Cas turns his head to look over his shoulder at him. “A life of high seas and adventures with you? I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time, Dean.” A smile plays across his lips and he wiggles back against him, settling comfortably and lacing their fingers together over his stomach. “I’ll manage.”
would you be interested in?” He tilts his head, a frown drawing tight between his eyebrows. “I haven't seen any other Wyverns in this area for a very long time. I suppose we could try and find some. But would you want to stay with that flock or bring your mate here?”
Cas is probably the nicest creature in the whole world, and Dean doesn't want to leave that. He'll be fully grown soon and Sam won't be able to carry him for a long time yet, if ever. Chances are, if he and Sam do leave, he's going to have to travel by ground and that's not safe for either of them. Why would he want to do that when Cas has opened his home to them and doesn't seem like he's ever going to ask them to leave.
It’s the middle of the night and for the first time in a long time, Sam’s belly is finally full. Of

“Hey Jude.” Dean’s voice gets closer. “My mom used to sing it to put me to sleep as a kid. She’s the one who made sure we always carried panic buttons, y’know?” He snorts. “Lot of good that did us.”
Dean’s seen those bags plenty of times. Usually, though, they’ve be hanging from an IV rack in a hospital room. He shouldn’t be seeing one now and he sure as fuck shouldn’t be

How hard would it be for Dean to accept this too?
“Wyverns, Castiel?
“No!” One of the children, a boy who could be no older than thirteen comes forward with a pile of rocks in his arms. He launches a handful at Dean. “Leave Cas alone!”
“I hate this.” Dean grumbles from the seat next to him in the car. He keeps slipping through the back of the chair and having to float forward again. “We should be out there looking for Sam. What good is
It hits him right around then that he’s been standing here staring and not saying anything and that could maybe, in some cultures, be considered more than a little rude. Dean clears his throat and lifts his gaze from Cas’s chest to his eyes and right away he feels calmer. He licks his lips and an easy smile comes to them. “Hey Cas.”
As fun as teasing Sam is, Cas's plane is due any minute now and Dean is on the verge of pissing his pants. “What if he doesn't like me? Like, the way that I smell or something? What if we're too awkward together that we can't even kiss? What if –”
home.” His wings snap out wide and Dean takes another step back, fumbling to get his gun from its holster. “
“I asked you if you would do anything to survive. You gave your consent.” Cas crosses the room to him and holds out a familiar bag. “Are you hungry yet?”
Bitter. Resentful. Hurt, and more than a little angry. Yeah, that’s all Dean Winchester right now. All of that and a little bit of sulking while he’s skulking through a mine shaft with the heavy potential of housing a pissed off and hungry wendigo inside. Which is, in reality, a horribly stupid idea. Any hunter would say so. Bobby actually did when Dean told him where he was going and what he was doing.
That said, Dean still isn’t expecting someone to slap him on the ass and shout in his ear. “Hey, bitch!”
The church beneath him is old and crumbling, but massive like the keep they once had. Castiel stares out over the stone marked graves in the field far below, watching the twinkling lights in the distance. They are far closer than he would like them to be.

“What?” He looks to Cas, eyes wide. “When did you learn that?”
Cackling, Dean lifts his flashlight above his head and waves it back and forth. “C’mon, Sammy. Come a little closer. Over.”
And that question gets tossed out the window when movement catches his attention from the corner of his eye. Cas is very determinedly staring down at the seat space between them where his own hand is resting. Dean’s right hand is on his thigh, fingers drumming in tune with the music. It’s Cas’s hand inching across the seat that catches Dean’s eye and relief washes through him like the sweetest ambrosia. He doesn’t look, but the does flip his hand over, palm side up, and moves it to the seat with his fingers spread to leave plenty of room for Cas to put his.
Bluntly, Dean gestures with his sword. “I came to save you.”
He’s hovering next to his brother when Castiel is finally admitted into the room to be given the final diagnosis that Sam is in perfect health. Sam excuses himself to the bathroom to get dressed again after the doctors leave. In that brief sliver of time, Dean turns to him and raises his hand. Castiel’s heart stutters painfully at the sight of it. Dean was already translucent, but now parts of him are fading to the point that not even Castiel can see them.
Dean can't sit, but he does come close enough to stand at the edge of the bed. He clears his throat again and gathers every scrap of courage he'd found over the last few months. “I want a mate.”

A dragon can still use magic like this. In fact, spells should be stronger now with the added use of powerful gestures. Dean cannot allow that to happen. He has a job to do and it won’t be done if he allows the dragon this chance. It’s a dangerous idea, but Dean drops his shield nonetheless as he digs his toes into the ground and launches forward. The dragon’s lips curl back in a snarl and light gathers in his hands moments before Dean tackles him.
Judging by the physique,
Sam and Charlie don’t seem to be having the same difficulties. They’re both completely engrossed until halfway through the movie when Sam turns around to offer his popcorn over the back of the seat. He freezes mid-motion and lowers the popcorn back to his lap. Castiel hopes he isn’t going to do anything to wake Dean. It’s rather nice having him sleep on his shoulder again. Dean hasn’t done that since the bus ride to the summer camp they attended together four years ago.
To make sure that Cas is actually doing it, Dean crouches by the corner of the window in the living room and watches him from behind the curtain. Cas sits on the stairs and flips through the pages faster than Dean could ever hope to read. He’s convinced that Cas is borderline genius or something. If he tried, he could probably read about as fast as Reid from Criminal Minds.
