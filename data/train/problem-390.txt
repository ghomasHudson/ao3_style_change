Solar panels: covered in dust because of the storm. I’ll need to clean them and make sure to do that regularly.
Okay, I could use the atmospheric regulator to get the O2 out of the Hab. If there is no oxygen, the hydrogen is stable and safe and I can burn it without blowing up. The thing is that the dirt needs a little oxygen, or the bacteria will die. So I need to lower the oxygen level enough that I won’t explode, but have some left for the soil. Now what is the highest level of oxygen I can have without igniting the hydrogen?
They watch her drive off, the sun glinting off her little blue car, the smell of dry grass and hot sand in the air.
Anyway, in addition to all of that, I also have our spare suits. Everyone had two, but of course the crew left in theirs, and mine didn’t survive the antenna disaster. But I have the spare suits to do EVA’s (Extravehicular Activities) with. I did one to check on the rest of our equipment. So far:
Okay. I’ve been thinking. I could easily live here for a while. Well, ‘easy’ is relative, but there is enough food for six people for a couple months (NASA packs extra, in case something goes wrong with the unmanned probes - thank god).
Now Sherlock was draped in an inelegant heap on the couch, letting his body repair the damage of a couple days without sleep or food, and he was dead to the world. It wasn’t an unusual sight after they’d finished up a case. Tomorrow they were expected at The Yard to give statements and what not, but this evening had been theirs to celebrate.
My best bet is still the Ares IV mission. If I can survive here until then, they could take me with them. So I need to find a way to get to the landing site. It’s 3200 kilometers away in the Schiaparelli crater, so it won’t be easy.
He feels the blood rushing to his face, his heart beating in his ears, waiting for a reaction. Sherlock is studying John, his hand slowly coming up to touch his own face.
I know that you have decided not to tell the Hermes Crew about John, but I really don’t feel good about it. They have to trust us, they depend on us and the information we give them and I feel like we can’t deny them this news.
When they walked into the Scotland Yard  building, he started to notice something was off. He was used to people staring and throwing him funny looks, but it seemed to be more intense than usual. John was still walking right next to him though, so he deleted the others as was his usual way of dealing with their nonsense. Lestrade was sorting out papers when they arrived at his office and Sherlock was already bored out of his mind before he could take a seat. He’d rather start on that experiment he had wanted to do for some time now, and he better do it before John found out he had a jar of maggots stashed in a cupboard. He let his mind wander for a bit, until he noticed Lestrade’s hands had stopped rummaging through the piles of paperwork and looked up to see him staring at John. Then he suddenly came back to life, cruising through their statements and wishing John luck before sending them away again.
I’ve more than enough space in the Rover to store food and water for the trip. If I drive to the Ares IV site, I’ll have to bring the oxygenator, but for this drive the O2  and CO2 filters will do.
Molly: Well, he’s not going in the right direction for the Ares IV site. But you’d think he’d stay within walking distance if it was a test drive, like he usually does.
“God, yes,” John groaned, maneuvering himself so that Sherlock had a bit more room to move his hands.
Sherlock is studying his bees when John finds him. He’s taking notes in one of his leather notebooks - the cottage is littered with them. John likes flicking through them, looking at Sherlock’s frantic handwriting - a sign of his mind working faster than his fingers, John guesses - and his fragile drawings of plants and insects.
It was as if the DJ had read his mind, because the lounge music was replaced with an enthusiastic voice introducing the first song, and the soft tones of a slow dance. Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat back, while the girls of the bachelorette party were apparently trying to get their wasted friend to dance with the cutest available male as a dare. He turned back to his drink, hoping the DJ would keep the slow dances to a minimum.
Sherlock swooped down again, capturing John’s mouth once more and John tasted the coppery tang of blood where the skin was broken. He brushed his tongue over the wound, lapping at the blood until Sherlock hissed impatiently. John deepened the kiss then, keeping Sherlock’s head in place with one hand, while the other was still clutching his hip. Sherlock pulled back, breathing hard and pushing his nose against John’s, so he could look down where he reached for John’s fly.
Irene will cover all media communication - I have already asked her to focus on this project. This has priority until John Watson is either back home on Earth of confirmed dead on Mars. She’s already in contact with several media outlets to ensure a clear and regular news broadcast. She’ll explain it in more detail in the meeting later.
“Oh, sod the police,” he growled and pulled Sherlock down by his scarf, crushing their mouths together. Their noses and teeth collided, but John roughly yanked at Sherlock’s hair to get a better angle. The wet heat of Sherlock’s tongue was a sharp contrast to the chill in the air and they moaned at the contact.
But I was not making as much water as I’d expected. I had only 70 liters, and I had calculated I’d have 130 by then. That meant I was gaining oxygen. And the only explanation for that is that I wasn’t burning all the hydrogen.
The Hab temperature can be adjusted to create a good environment for plants, there are no pests or weeds or anything, and no bad weather conditions. I think this could work.
John is unable to move, pinned by those sharp eyes, and his throat isn’t working. He can only sit there and wait.
Well, everything is fine! Pressure is good, all the machines are working. I checked the soil under the microscope and the bacteria were alive and well! Going to clean up the Hab and celebrate with a Friends marathon!
The soil is doing pretty good, and it’s great to keep me busy, but I’ve been calculating and even if the potatoes do really well, it won’t be enough to live off for a very long time. My estimate is that the potatoes can buy me about 90 days. So if I add that to the days my rationed meal packs can get me, my food will be gone by Sol 490. And Ares IV will land on Sol 1412...
I hope you guys are doing okay. I understand it must be hard for you to deal with everything that has happened, but I want to stress again that we admire the way Commander Sholto and the rest of the team have handled the situation. You have all correctly followed the emergency protocols, and you all know the risks involved with these missions. Please don’t blame yourself for this tragedy. We will all miss John. In fact, that is why I’m contacting you now.
John smiled at his hands, now moving to clean the other cheek.  Sherlock let his mouth quirk up in a silent reply. “I should have expected this, you quite like childish games, as I recall.”
“I know you’re not like them. I don’t want you to be like them. You’re brilliant the way you are. I was just being an idiot.” John patted Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock looked up at him. John looked a bit awkward, clearly afraid of having pushed him too far.
Either way, we don’t have time to build a custom craft. We have to work with what we’ve got. I’ll talk to JPL again, see how we can do this without stripping the MDV of safety and emergency equipment.
: They are very well balanced. Commander Sholto has a lot of experience, he was perfectly placed to lead this mission. James Sholto, Sally Donovan and Henry Knight are all quite serious types, very focused on their job. Bill Murray, Janine Hawkins and John Watson are very professional as well, but are a bit more open and extroverted.
But then Sherlock’s lips smile against his, and that feels so incredibly wonderful, the tension flows out of him at once and he vows he’ll chase that smile until he knows the taste of it.
I  suppose I could try the pop-tents we have in the Rovers. They are for emergencies on the road, but I guess I don’t really need them for that anyway. I just need to find a way to attach them to the Hab. And I still need to fix the water problem…
“Come and have some lemonade with us, yeah?” he motions to the house, where Lilly is already carrying a tray with a pitcher and glasses from the kitchen to the little garden table.
Sherlock comes back inside a little later, smelling of grass and smoke. He lowers himself onto the sofa, next to John who had dozed off while pretending to read the paper. He feels Sherlock's fingers slip in his own. Squeezing. They are rough from work in the garden, from experiments gone wrong, cuts and burns. Still long and slender. Still beautiful. It’s quiet. John is content to just sit here, in their sofa, with Sherlock’s hand in his. But then he feels Sherlock’s shoulder shaking, and when he looks up, Sherlock’s head is down, black curls tumbling forward and he can hear him sob quietly. The only thing he manages to say is John’s name. John pulls him into his own body, close to his heart.
Sherlock’s eyes are too closeby to focus on, so John closes his against the blur of green and grey. Then he moves his head fractionally, bumping his nose into Sherlock’s and seeking his lips with his own. Their mouths are just touching, lightly, and John’s chest feels too small for his heart. His hands feel clammy, and he shifts restlessly, trying to wipe them on his jeans.
Anyway, it’s a really really good thing that NASA doesn’t know what I’m about to do. Or that Commander Sholto isn’t around. They would lose their collective shit.
It all seemed to be working pretty well. I managed to put everything in place, I was able to use a catalyst to get the hydrogen, and I very very slowly and carefully burned it, and I was making a lot of water!
John feels a fond smile spread on his face, and lowers his head, studying the hurried scrawl that is Sherlock’s handwriting. Sherlock launches into his lesson with enthusiasm. John’s honestly trying to pay attention to what Sherlock is saying, but he keeps looking at how he moves his hands, how his long and elegant fingers hold his pencil, how they wave through the air, underlining Sherlock’s explanation.
When John wakes up, Sherlock is still sleeping. It’s not that unusual anymore. Old age made him give in to his transport a bit more. John takes the time to look at Sherlock closely. His hair, still full and inky, spills over the pillow in a messy halo of curls. Only at his temples there are some silver streaks, but it give him a distinguished look. John likes it. He looks peaceful now, soft lips slightly open, skin stretched over the pronounced cheekbones, lashes frail and delicate. His impossible beauty. John wants to keep him like this forever, protect him, keep him safe from what’s coming, but he knows that’s not what Sherlock would want. So he just pushes his nose in the hollow between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder and breathes him in, lets his lips slide over warm skin and leaves him there, in the morning light, a dream.
Molly: He’s on the move again. It’s different though. He’s a long way away from the Hab, but I don’t think it’s the roadtrip he was planning.
“It’s Molly.” John whispers. He feels a large hand on his shoulder, smoothing his jumper down his back. He turns and grips at Sherlock, his hands fisting in the crisp shirt. He cries. He cries for Molly, for Greg, for Mrs. Hudson, for Sherlock. The tiles are cold beneath his feet, but they don’t move for a long time.
John understands exactly, precisely the reassurance he is looking for, his need to find an anchor, to tie a lifeline to their real selves, their real lives left behind in London. He feels exactly the same.
After a few moments as the endorphins begin to ebb away. Sherlock begins to realise that a great many places on his body hurt. A lot.
“How fortunate for me you’ve realized your true calling as an agony aunt,” he snaps, but it lacks any real bite. “How, then, do you suggest we do that?”
“Regarding case file ACD one-eight-nine-five. Holmes Corporation. All records pertaining to--” John’s gaze flicks to the bottle of vodka. He decides against it. Numbed is fine, but he’s no use to anyone roaring drunk. “All records pertaining to replicant designated Sherlock Holmes.”
“Not at all. It’s just a--” John pauses, surprise by his unexpected desire to confide in Mrs. Hudson, despite knowing it’s not a good idea in the slightest, that Sherlock would suss it out in an instant. “--just a blue moment. You know how his moods are. It will pass.”
“Sherlock.” John furrows his brow, considers how to phrase his question. “This thing that um, whatever we’re doing right now.” Sherlock is silent, so he stumbles forward awkwardly. “Is this on or off the radar of...your brother’s associates?”
Sherlock takes the baby carrier out of the back seat. She’s awake again, but not fussy yet, big blue eyes taking in everything.
“What would you have had me do?” Mycroft demands.”Storm in there with an army regiment, guns blazing, like some ridiculous Hollywood movie?”
Sherlock realizes he’s mindlessly, animalistically nuzzling and mouthing at John’s sweat-damp hair. It feels good. Safe.
It’s past seven when he finishes, and he’s not yet a seasoned enough driver to be comfortable driving at night in the dark, so he puts the trip to Oxfam off for another day.
John is panting heavily, his eyes closed as his breathing slows and evens. He drops the leash into his lap and pulls up his jeans and briefs. He opens his eyes and smiles, his gaze softened by his orgasm but still holding an edge of darkness.
Lestrade must have called John, because he arrives a short time later, looking pale and worried. Sherlock sees him and grins. He can’t wait to hear the fondness in John’s voice, the praise John will heap on him for being clever and brave.
It occurs to John that while he fully believes he and Sherlock are the loves of each other's lives, the two of them figuring out how not to royally fuck this up is actually going to take a
He closes his eyes and drinks, his hands visibly shaking as he lifts the bottle to his lips. When he opens them again his gaze is blank, staring fixedly at nothing, and it rips John apart inside to think about what horrors Sherlock is reliving in his mind’s eye.
John nods against Sherlock’s shoulder. “Until I get something else sorted out. I just got in last night.” His hands tighten around Sherlock’s waist, rub slow circles across the base of his spine. It feels marvellous.
He went back to work two days ago; he’s completely indifferent to the entire enterprise, but he can’t think of a compelling excuse not to go.
want. I know I do. But I don’t really know what it is I want anymore, or how to get there from here.”
? That’s what we’re calling it?” Sherlock really does roll his eyes, not a mere twitch but a full-on rotation. “John, you cannot be serious right now.”
“Pretty bad,” John says. “He cursed a lot --more in one sentence than I’ve heard out of his mouth in the past five years-- and then left.”
All heads swivel to look at him, surprised, including the still-sniveling Nestor crumpled on the floor.
“And I do know what you’re capable of,” John continues, softer, conciliatory. “Sherlock. I’ve always known. And I’m sorry, truly sorry, for ever saying or thinking otherwise. Please believe that is about my shortcomings, not yours. And I will try to do better.”
He's counting on the odd deference Americans seem to have for English accents, and it works. The clerk doesn’t even ask for ID, just processes the credit card, hands him a slip of paper to sign before she encodes two key cards, tucking them into an envelope and handing them over. She distractedly bids him goodnight as she’s already reaching under the paperwork for her mobile.
His parents gather up their coats and glasses and bags, double and triple checking each, as they move towards the door at just slightly above a geological pace.
John sets down the glass on top of the bureau, opens up the wardrobe, pulls out the metal lockbox. Inside, under the Sig, is the non-regulation, quite illegal folding knife he’d smuggled back home, a gift given to him by an American acquaintance in Kandahar.
John glances down at the to-do list, scrawled in his messy doctor’s hand on the lined page. “Yeah. Got to start somewhere, right?”
Sherlock mumbled in assent, and was breathing deeply and evenly a few minutes later. He would sleep for twelve or fourteen hours, and wake up his usual, slightly mad but weirdly charming self, and clean up the shattered mug without prompting, and peace (or at least their version of it) would reign for a few weeks or maybe even months.
, and I’m stumbling and fumbling and flailing all over the place. I don’t know how to put the pieces together in the proper order, I can’t see the patterns and she’s slipping further away every single day because I’m too stupid to figure it out.”
John is able to exit the SUV unassisted; the feat is something of a boon to his battered pride. Once out of the car he straightens his shoulders, exhales, resolves to look as determined, uncompromising, and not-recently-shot as possible when confronting Johnson.
“I wasn’t ready,” John says with a sigh. “I went out with some old mates from Afghanistan, except one of them wasn’t much of a mate, I guess. He has a problem with me, and he um. He said things that I didn’t much like hearing.”
“Tell me this is real,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice rough and pleading as he strains against John, rolling his pelvis in an ancient, instinctive rhythm born of need as John kneads the springy flesh of his arse with his fingers in encouragement. “John. I need to hear it.”
“Don’t be,” Sherlock replies, and the words come out with a level of vehemence that takes John a bit aback. “There’s nothing for you to be sorry for. I’m the one who--”
Late that afternoon, John does indeed find a nearby launderette with both high speed WiFi and a coffee shop next door.
An Armenian pawnbroker in his early thirties opens a square shopping bag and slides two used Glock 17s across a battered Formica countertop. Sherlock nods and pulls an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket, opens it so the man can see the stack of hundreds contained within. Then he pauses, as if a thought just suddenly occurred to him. He turns to glance out the dusty window at the front of the shop.
“I think…” John pauses for a minute, chooses his words carefully for maximum impact. “I want to tie you up, make you helpless, and then touch you, play with you. You’d love that, I bet. Wouldn’t you?”
He looks so different now, in some ways, the shorn hair and everyday clothing so very different from what John is used to at home. Yet the essence of him, the angles and curves of his long body, the slant of his cheekbones, the pale green ice of his eyes--these haven’t changed, could never change no matter what continent they find themselves on, or how Sherlock dresses or acts or what kind of community theatre accent he slips into like a new pair of cheap shoes.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and turns to face him. John looks up at him, stormy blue eyes soft and kind, crinkled with affection and concern.
“Come on, you,” the man growls as he points his gun at her, forcing her to her feet. That’s when Sherlock notices the spirit gum residue on the edge of her right thumb and it all comes together.
Before he can respond, Johnson has closed the space between himself and Sherlock and jammed the prongs of the stun gun into his back, directly between his shoulder blades, making a strange, yelping sort of noise of triumph.
An epiphany strikes Sherlock and he stops pacing, a flash of emotional insight hitting him with the force of a blow. He turns to John, eyes wide with realization. “It’s not just about being better than
Keeping his gaze on the plant, Sherlock rises, circles it like some kind of horticultural adversary.
“I love you,” John tells him, quiet and utterly heartfelt, barely above a whisper. “I always have. Since the very first. Even when… even when I was angry with you. Even in the moments when I hated you. The past can’t be changed, I know that. It is what it is, but ... I have always loved you, and I will never, ever stop. No matter what. Just, please. Know that.”
He sees John swing before he feels it, a sharp bite of fire across his left shoulder blade. He watches his face twist in a gasp of pain and fights the impulse to close his eyes.
“I know, pet.” John’s voice is deep and rough with tiredness, but so full of love, wrapping around Sherlock like the warmest, softest blanket. “It’s all right. I’m all right. Go back to sleep.”
John looks at him and a small, adorable giggle escapes his throat. “We’re both utterly deranged, aren’t we?” he asks, and Sherlock nods, still laughing.
Sherlock nods his reluctant assent and rises from the bed. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out John’s phone and places it on the bed within John’s reach. “If you need me for anything --
“Please, Patricia,” John says. “I truly need your help. They took my daughter. I swear, it’s the truth. Just call Katie. If she and Adam are innocent, if we’re completely mistaken, then you can hear it directly from her.”
John feels his throat tighten and his chest constrict with emotion for a moment; he then decides these maudlin thoughts are unproductive at best and a dangerous distraction at worst, and pushes them aside to focus on the current situation. He plucks the cup out of Sherlock’s hand, tips back a mouthful of slightly flat lukewarm cola to moisten his dry mouth, and hands the drink back without comment.
phrase flashes in his brain, he summarily decides in he’s been in the States for far too long), pulling into an empty space in front of a sprawling Target Supercenter.
“A little better,” John says, and it’s technically true, at least he’s not actively crying any longer and he can sort of breathe through his nose. He can’t help but give a small, self-conscious huff of deeply-ingrained embarrassment. “I’m sorry,” he adds, reflexively, before he can stop himself.
It had only taken a five-second swab to the inside of John’s cheek to make plain what everyone involved already knew to be true.
A slight, nondescript black-haired man steps out of one of the rooms on the left. He’s fortyish, vaguely handsome, somewhat Asian in looks but not distinctly so. His white shirt and khaki trousers are soaked and clinging to his slight frame. He holds a metal canister in his right hand.
,” Maria sneers, her scant patience snapping. “Yes. You’re right. I’m not your wife, never was. You’re not my husband, you never were and believe me, I’m damn glad of it, considering how pathetically hung up you’ve always been on Sherlock Fucking Holmes.” She rolls her eyes and gives a melodramatic sigh before fixing her gaze again upon John. “Lovely relationship chat. Really. Now
“Stop,” John says, cutting him off mid sentence. “Stop this. Stop this nonsense. We’ve come too far to turn back now. Maria is a problem we both created, both of us together, and the mother of my missing child to boot. If you think even for one second I’d let you face her alone -- ”
Nothing left to say, the two of them lie together quietly, half drowsing as they cling to one another, the afternoon slipping inexorably into night.
“He’s dead,” says Sherlock, going for a dismissive tone and missing by a mile. “I saw his body. I held a piece of his brain in my hand. I assure you,
John opens his mouth to say something; Sherlock holds up a hand. “I know,” he says. “Yes, I was quiet and mostly well-behaved as a child, and I don’t know why people find this hard to believe.”
“You could do me a favour in the meantime,” Sherlock says, fingers already flying over the keyboard.
“Probably because you’re rude, flout the rules constantly and have no respect for authority,” John answers with an air of amused disbelief.
“Perfect,” John murmurs, climbing between his legs and encircling his cock with gentle fingers, dipping his head downward and licking a broad, wet stripe up the underside of his shaft, pressing the tip of his tongue into the wet slit and tasting the moisture there.
John rolls his eyes, his lips curving into a thin, humourless smile. “Didn’t hear anyone say a word in there against him, did I.”
“Anyway.” Sherlock snuggles closer and sighs. “Inside of you… you’re a miracle. You’re amazing. You’re the whole of creation inside one ordinary human being. John Watson, how are you
Sherlock’s phone beeps a notification tone. Sherlock pulls it out of his pocket and glances at it, a look of satisfaction crossing his features.
John is slammed between the eyes with new awareness. He sees, in stark, crystalline sharpness, that he’s been stubbornly clinging to a fantasy rooted in pure denial, a fantasy that somehow Mary had been shamming, been deceiving them both the entire time and that the baby wasn’t real, that his child, his daughter, hasn’t been lost or given away or…
Seb smiles at her in the mirror; after a moment the sweet, sunny grin on his face morphs into something darker, more intense as his eyes shift a bit upwards, focusing on the shadowed figure in the open doorway. “Hi, Jim.”
“Good,” John says, and wraps his fingers around the back of Sherlock’s head, pulls him down for a kiss, unabashedly grabbing his rear to pull him close. Sherlock makes a small noise of appreciation and kisses him back, throwing a long leg over him, insistent fingers exploring the curves and planes of John’s back.
Both men look up as Sherlock and John enter the room, glaring flatly at them as they cross to the exit door at the far end.
“I was working with ‘im, not watching ‘im!” Wiggins snaps. “Begging your pardon, but Sherlock Holmes ain’t a toddler, sir.”
“Oh. You know. Pirate stories. Economics textbooks. Herman Melville. Creation myths of indigenous Amazonian tribal groups. The usual sort of thing.”
John cups a stubbled cheekbone in cold fingers, stretches up onto his toes and pecks him once, chastely, on the mouth. Sherlock’s lips are chapped and cold and taste just faintly of salt, and even if he is taking both of them to certain doom John knows that in a hundred lifetimes he could never love anyone more.
John opens his mouth to answer, to defend his choices, but Lestrade cuts him off. “Later,” the DI snaps. “I’ve got enough to deal with at the moment.” He gestures at Lee’s blackened corpse. “I take it this is Dr Lee?”
, he tells himself. Just in case he needs to get in touch, needs Sherlock to track down more information.
, how free and lovely it is to indulge a bodily appetite for sex in as simple and straightforward manner as one would a plate of chips, or a hot bath, or a nap -- all the things he routinely partakes of now, without shame or apology, all the simple pleasures he denied himself for so many years before John Watson showed up and turned his entire sense of self inside out.
.” He shakes his head, dark curls over his forehead bobbing. “There’s always something, isn’t there.”
“I think,” John says, slowly. “I think I know where she is. Or at least, I know how to find where she is.”
“I don’t know that I’m doing any good,” he confesses, the words spilling out unplanned. “I might be making it worse. He’s in desperate need of professional trauma counseling.”
feel so much closer to pleasurable. John exhales, willing his body to relax, to yield, to allow Sherlock access to him, to all of him, to everything he is.
He carefully opens the inner envelope. The card within is a single, unfolded sheet of glossy stock. The picture is of a cartoon stork, holding a pink balloon aloft with a string held in his beak. Over the bird’s head, a banner brightly proclaims
Sherlock sets the alarm and locks the front door as they leave, and John feels a bit of a pang. He had come to appreciate the creature comforts of the little house.
“You,” John breathes. “You’re amazing, you’re beautiful. I want you, God, I want you so much.” He’s babbling now, mind unmoored by lust and friction, words and feelings he’s never even considered before spilling out unbidden. “I’ll keep you forever. We’ll run away. We’ll run away up north and they won’t find us. We’ll be together, always.”
“For heaven’s sake,” Sherlock huffs in annoyance. “We’ve been through this. It’s not an insult; it’s both a valuable skill and a useful tool.”
Figueroa narrows his eyes at them both, then turns on his heel and stalks out of the room. John feels certain that if the door didn’t have a self-closing spring hinge he would have slammed it as hard as he could, Intensive Care Unit or no.
“I can feel you,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice coloured by something like awe. “I can feel you from the inside. You’re so warm, John. It’s---you’re
John takes the offered hand, allows Sherlock to pull him into his lap, his knees slotting snugly on either side of his long lean thighs, his groin pressing into Sherlock’s, the two of them just barely fitting together into the slouchy armchair.
“Come back up here, love,” John says gently, barely even noticing the endearment that slips out in the heat of the moment. Sherlock slides back up his body and John kisses him, tasting his own musky tang on Sherlock’s lips. “It’s so good, it’s too good, and I’m about to go off if you keep that up much longer.”
This happens sometimes, when this thing between them gets especially intense, goes to that much deeper and scarier place. The usual script gets flipped and instead of Sherlock, John is the one who gets hit with a drop after. Interestingly, it seems to happen when Sherlock
“Appreciate you more. Maybe I could do that sort of thing, now.” Sherlock looks at John through narrowed eyes, as if daring him to disagree. “You never really gave me an opportunity to show you that I could appreciate you, that I could care, not after….well, after.”
“If I take you with me,” Sherlock counters, “every single source I have will disappear. You practically radiate Queen and country, law and order. Not that it’s necessarily true, but that’s the impression you give off, and that’s not going to work for this endeavour. Can you stop being pissed off long enough to see that?”
“No, too obvious,” is all he says before heading to another nearby display and selecting first a plaid zippered jacket; he then pauses to peruse a clearance-sale end shelf, selecting a grey knit cap bearing some incomprehensible graffiti-inspired brand logo as John hovers uncertainly behind him.
Sherlock is pale to the point of greyness and in desperate need of a haircut. His Belstaff hangs on him like a blanket wrapped around a scarecrow.
says the voice of reason in John’s head, still clamouring to be heard over the rushing tide of burning, unquenchable lust.
“Maybe I should get the nurse,” Sherlock says, coming to stand close by John, hovering protectively. He sounds far more doubtful than he did a few minutes earlier. “I don’t want to drop you. Or -- ”
They linger over dinner far longer than necessary, picking at a shared plate of tiramisu as Sherlock deduces the surrounding patrons for John’s amusement. Too soon the restaurant begins to empty, and at last they find themselves on the kerb. Sherlock hails a cab and turns to John, fumbling uncharacteristically for the right words.
John thought he’d be equally eager to leave this place, and most of him is, but there’s a deeper truth here as well and it bears saying out loud.
“Okay,” Sherlock says softly, then gives a small chuckle, barely a breath of air against his skin. “Bossy,” he murmurs, and then he’s pressing harder against his loosened opening with two slicked fingers, sliding inside so easily, and John arches his back and gasps a little at the feeling, tight and stretched but not really painful, exactly, just different, and as Sherlock pulls out and pushes back in again, careful, John can feel the potential there, the possibility of the hot strange discomfort shifting over into a deep, pulsing pressure, with just a little--
Before John can fully process that thought, a gaping red hole appears in Jefferson’s forehead; he falls like a sack of bricks, still holding onto John, pulling him down as well.
“In a bit,” Sherlock says, and reaches for John’s waist, pulls him closer. John twines his legs around him obligingly, presses a kiss into his tangled and sweaty curls as Sherlock makes himself comfortable, face pressed into the side of John’s equally sweaty flank.
Sherlock stares at him for a long moment before turning and walking--not flouncing, not running, just calmly walking-- back into the bedroom. He closes the door quietly but firmly. He turns the lock and arranges himself on the bed, flat on his back with fingers steepled under his chin, and tries to calm his raging emotions.
, but the tea has just the right splash of milk, and the cheese sandwich has a touch of Branston pickle, his favourite. He gives in and consumes both, chewing resentfully as considers the possible merit of his landlady’s words.
“Useless waste of time, you are,” the owner of the boot tells him conversationally. “Better hope you’re worth what they think.”
“They protect me,” Molly said. “Keyed to my voice. They’re my friends. I feel safe, and I’m never lonely.” Molly turns her head to look fully at Seb. “Where are your folks?” she asks.
His body aches, clamours in protest as he rises, rubs his aching shoulder--interestingly he notes how his leg continues to feel fine, not even a twinge of pain. He looks over at Sherlock’s dark head, bent over the keys of the piano, picking out a melody, his fingers tentative at first but increasing in confidence as he goes on.
“You’re having a really hard time getting out of there,” John murmurs, his voice interrupting the vortex of swirling thoughts as he taps his fingers gently on the side of Sherlock’s skull. He sinks down to his knees on the carpet, bringing himself level to Sherlock, brushing his fringe out of his eyes and kissing his forehead. “Aren’t you?”
Sherlock groans every tortuous step of the way, and by the time he’s made it back to bed the racket has summoned John to the door of the bedroom. He’s small and mild and adorable this morning, freshly showered and shaved, reading glasses from Poundland tucked into the neck of his blue and gray jumper.
“But I’m... I'm not the person now that I was then. I no longer have that hole inside of me that I have to fill with puzzles and playacting and drama. I’ve changed so much, John, and it goes even deeper than what you see. I want something different, now. I want a chance to build a life with you.”
The silence stretches tight between them, and Sherlock suddenly finds the tension of it almost unbearable.
“The detective just left looking noticeably frustrated," Sherlock tells them, "while Evelyn is smiling, and John’s conspicuously lacking handcuffs. Can I deduce from all this that we are now in the clear?”
However, the antenna and the congealed blood from the wound were both really good at plugging the hole of my EVA suit, keeping me alive. The water in the blood evaporated, and the resulting sticky residue closed the tear in the fabric like glue. In the end the oxygen warning of the suit woke me up.
The art for this chapter is a collab with Risah - thanks for whipping up a sketch so quickly, you are the bomb!
The thing is that liberating hydrogen from hydrazine is really really dangerous. Combine it with oxygen, and it’ll explode. It’s basically how rockets work. I’ll have a lot of H
It turned out to be very simple to detach the battery from Rover 1, but attaching it to Rover 2 (from here on out known as the USS Potato) was another story.
Right when he started to make tea, he heard John stumbling down the stairs. He walked into the kitchen and looked around blearily. It always took John a bit longer to recover from a case. It was quite endearing, actually. It was fine, John looked relaxed, and he didn’t mind holding on to the easy domesticity that marked their lives between cases now. It wouldn’t be long before he longed for a good mystery again, but the times in between were less agonising than they used to be. John was back home, and even though there we still a lot of things unsaid between them, he felt he already got more than he deserved and he was happy with how things were - even though Mycroft took every opportunity to rub it in his face.
“Alright, John, you should probably explain to me why everyone’s been acting extra foolish today.” Sherlock said while they stepped into the lift. John looked a little guilty, but also a little smug. He grabbed Sherlock by his shoulders and turned him towards the mirrored wall.
: Indeed we do, Kitty! We’d like to welcome Michael Stamford, Director of Mars Missions, to our studio! [applause]
We went to Mars with the Hermes, a rocket specially designed to ferry between Earth and Mars for these missions. It takes a while to get here (4 months, in our case) and it’s a miracle we all made it here alive. No, I’m kidding - we make a very good team. Made. God, no, that sounds wrong.
It’s a good thing NASA supplies us with a lot of extra material to fix things in case of emergency. They probably didn’t intend the extra Hab canvas and resin to make Mars Mobile saddlebags, but one of us needs to do some creative thinking! I put the battery on one side and filled the other side with rocks for balance, and voila: I have my extra battery!
I’ll present it all to you in detail when we can meet up, but as you can observe in the attached satellite images the solar panels have been cleaned, there are pop tents set up next to the Hab and one of the Rovers has been moved. We’ve checked the mission logs to compare the current location with the last location Commander Sholto reported. But maybe the most telling evidence is the fact that there is no sign of a body.
I’m a bit worried about safety, but if I don’t try this, I’ll starve to death, so I don’t have much choice here.
I’m sorry to disturb you during the holidays, I know most of you are at home with your families, but I’d like to call you all in for a meeting asap.
: They can always contact me via the data exchange. So they can send me messages if they need support, yes.
: Without any form of communication, I can’t imagine it being easy, no matter how strong you are. But John performed really well in his tests. Of all of them, I think he’s definitely the best at putting things in perspective, he’s not one to give up easily, and he’s very resourceful. That’s also the reason he’s still alive in the first place, I think.
Luckily, the systems are prepared for shit like this, so everything was doing it’s job and the oxygenator started getting the oxygen levels up again. Things seem alright.
“Not a fan of dancing, then?” The question took Sherlock by surprise; he wasn’t used to people spontaneously talking to him. The stranger looked at him hesitantly, trying to read his face - which was admittedly quite confusing at the moment.
I still don’t have any ideas about how to fix the communication. I can’t repair it without the dish, and there was no sign of it anywhere, so that’s out.
I’ll start by bringing in more dirt, so I have enough soil for planting. And I think I’ll start a seed crop. I have a little corner of fertile soil ready, so if I cut the 12 potatoes I have in 4 pieces with a couple of eyes each, they’ll hopefully sprout. I’ll need to cut up this crop to plant on the rest of the field, so I hope they grow well. My life depends on it.
“You need to loosen up for this, Sherlock! Just feel the music and stop thinking so hard! Have fun!” John shouted over the music. Despite Sherlock being almost a head taller, John was confident and sure in his movements, and Sherlock noticed he felt instinctively where John wanted him to go. He realised John wasn’t judging him, wasn’t looking for mistakes. He also noticed he wasn’t thinking about whether John was making any mistakes, or how they looked together. He was just enjoying himself, letting the music and John guide him.
“Why did he wish you luck? You don’t have a date, do you?” he asked John, crossing the open office space to the lifts. John hadn’t been dating since the whole affair with Mary, but he was feeling better lately, so it was a possibility. Sherlock was prepared for it, but still the idea left him in a state of panic. John opened his mouth to answer, but then Donovan distracted them by tripping over a desk chair, sending manilla envelopes and papers flying and landing with her head in a paper bin.
I can’t quite get my head around the news, to be honest - but if it is true, I can already tell you now that there is no way Hermes can change its trajectory.
Good work. I’ll deal with the Baskerville team. Stapleton won’t be happy, but we’ll have to delay their mission. This is a rescue, and has priority.
But watching Sherlock as he commandeered a young police officer to give them a lift home, with his lips red and swollen and his hair a messy halo of curls, he found himself not caring at all.
We’ve been thinking about supplies - we could land one of the Ares IV presupplies at the Ares III site. Problem is they’re not ready yet, the launch was planned  a year from now. It takes about 8 months to get there with the current positions of Earth and Mars. The timing is really bad.
But it’s either taking a risk now and possibly dying in an explosion - or definitely starving to death later.
“Medical student, thinking about specializing in surgery. You should, you have the hands for it,” Sherlock finished for him. The man blinked up at him.
: We’re still preparing for the next missions as usual. We have great astronauts in training and we’re working on the supplies. What happened during this mission was not due to technical failures, or anything NASA could do different. I’m afraid we only have the weather on Mars to blame, although we might look into communication and see what we can improve. Space travel will always involve risks, though.
The drive to Ares IV will take me about 40 sols, and that is if all goes well. So I really want to try a longer drive, to see if everything holds up or if I need to make some alterations before I leave for the Schiaparelli crater.
That might not be as good as it sounds, though. I have no clue what to do next. I can see the MAV is gone, so I hope the evacuation went well.
Another problem is that after a few tracks around the Hab, the ground became nice and flat, which isn’t representative for the rest of the Martian surface. So I’ll need to switch it up next time.
I think I’ll make sure I have the basics covered (food and energy) and then I’ll have to find a way to fix the communication. I realise the Hermes will already be on its way back to Earth, but maybe if I could contact them, the people at NASA could think of something…
“No, it’s nothing, but I’d like some tea, please.” He smiled up at Sherlock. “Oh, right, we better get to the Yard for our statements!” He stood up again. John then proceeded to stuff some slices of bread in the toaster, drink the tea and get dressed in record time. He was still eating his toast when he bundled Sherlock in his Belstaff and down the stairs to the front door.
Irene: You guys better get ready for the press conference, it will be fucking brutal. They are like bloodhounds out there, watch your ankles.
There are other things I could plant, but I need calories, and potatoes are the best source I have. We have enough vitamin supplements on board, so I don’t need to worry about that.
Sherlock suddenly stepped closer, a predatory gleam in his eyes, which stirred something in John’s gut.
to store away in his mind palace, John had decided to take Sherlock out to dinner at Angelo’s. He wanted them to have a fresh start, and at this point Sherlock couldn’t deny John anything at all. When they’d untangled themselves and went to grab their coats, Sherlock caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantle. His hair was a wild tumble of curls, his lips were pink and slightly swollen, his cheeks rosy and on his forehead still the word ‘idiot’. He grinned at his reflection and followed John down the stairs.
Suddenly John was shoved back, his head hitting the brickwork hard, but the sensation of pain only added to the fire rapidly building low in his belly. Sherlock moved his lips down from John’s to place open mouthed kisses along his throat, pressing his tonue over his pulse point and tugging at his jumper to get better access to his collarbones. The scrape of teeth over his clavicle roused John out of his passivity. He grabbed Sherlock’s hips and drew them towards him, grinning up at Sherlock’s surprised gasp as he ground their bodies together. Bringing one hand up to pull at Sherlock’s curls again, he exposed his long pale neck and licked a hot stripe up towards his ear.
I can isolate the hydrogen by running the hydrazine over a catalyst. Then comes the dangerous part: I’ll have to burn it.
Please reconsider giving me some satellite time, I just want to see how much of the material can be salvaged, there are enough supplies there for a complete mission. We can’t let the hard work of the crew and all other departments involved go to waste like that.
Heating might be a problem, though. Half of the energy will go to heating, and I can’t afford it. I guess I can be my own stove, though - I’ll just wear layers and turn the heating off. The rovers have insulation too, so I think I’ll be alright. I need all the power I can get.
“John!” he whispers after a few seconds, as if his mind was malfunctioning and is only now stringing things together.
John settled himself on the coffee table in front of Sherlock, a bowl of water with some of Sherlock’s expensive facial soap and a flannel next to him.  He started wiping the damp cloth over Sherlock’s cheekbone. Despite John patching him up every other case, his touch was always a little shock for Sherlock. He tried not to flinch.
To make water, I need to take hydrogen and oxygen, and burn it. Now this is all very complicated, but I’m currently the best chemist on this planet, so I’ll give it a go.
The only thing I can say is: calm down and brace yourselves, because this plan is even worse and it doesn’t involve maths.
As the stranger huffed out a breath and threaded a hand through his sandy hair, he wondered why he wanted to know what was troubling him. He usually didn’t care about anyone, using his deductive skills to his advantage whenever he could. The ballet world was a cruel one, and it always came in handy to know who was hiding an injury (almost everyone in the company, really) or who was attempting to seduce the ballet Master (usually Irene) or Mistress (also Irene, damn her). This time he was just curious. How strange. He decided he should stop this behaviour immediately.
Our team all have their specialties, but NASA makes sure we all know the basics, so we can take over critical tasks and experiments in case one of us falls ill or something. For instance, the rest of the crew all have a basic knowledge of medical procedures and had first aid training, in case I get stranded on a planet.
The Hab is in complete working order, everything works the way it’s supposed to. I have oxygen, water, food and all the personal belongings of my crewmates. That could be fun if I get bored.
Poor John. He was always a fighter, that one. I wonder what must be going through his mind right now.
Irene: Are you still here? I thought you were going home to get some sleep, since John isn’t driving at the moment.
Sherlock looked at his reflection. On his forehead John had written ‘consulting idiot’. He had also drawn stripes on his cheeks, representing whiskers, and coloured the tip of his nose. John had dissolved in silent giggles next to him.
When I woke up, I saw the antenna of the main communication dish was lodged into my shoulder, which was...painful. My bio-monitor was damaged as well, so the crew would have thought my vitals were gone.
I have also contacted Ella, concerning John’s files. It might be good to have a clear view on his mental state - I'm particularly interested in the results of his isolation experiment.
“So you see it’s quite simple mathematics, John, I’m sure you’ve the capacity to understand it if you put your mind to it. You are relatively clever.” Sherlock manages to sound bored and smug at the same time.
I shall have to miss your excellent banoffee pie for a little longer, I’m afraid. I leave for California in the morning. Mike wanted me to go to JPL to help them set up their replica of Pathfinder, so we might be able to communicate with Watson if he manages to fix it. It seems a long shot, but at least I have something to do.
They’re sitting in their chairs in front of the fire. It’s not that cold yet, but John likes the cozy atmosphere it creates. It revives memories of Baker Street. Their socked feet are pushed together between the chairs. Sherlock wriggles his toes under John’s.
“Morning, John,” Sherlock said briskly, getting his mind back on track. “Tea?” John nodded and suddenly froze in the middle of the kitchen, staring at Sherlock. “Are you alright?” Sherlock inquired. “You’re not hurt, are you?” It would be typical for John to take care of others and minimise his own wounds. John cleared his throat and sat down.
This is not easy to say, but during the processing of the Ares III site satellite images Molly Hooper found some irregularities that seem to indicate that John Watson survived the storm that led the crew to evacuate. There is strong evidence that he’s still alive and living in the Hab at this moment.
Greg: Alright, now he can drive a long distance without freezing or losing battery life. But where would he go?
So, I will need to travel to the Schiaparelli crater. It’s not close, but it could be a lot worse, so I’m not really complaining. And since I’m in a crater on the flattest part of Mars, the first kilometers will be pretty smooth driving. But after that the terrain turns very rough.
I just watched one of Sally’s movies. Friends was reminding me too much of the crew and my sister. The film was Groundhog Day. Apart from being really old, the part where Phil keeps finding interesting and creative ways to kill himself wasn’t really good for my morale.
Sherlock feels no fear or anxiety. The press of his collar, the restraint of his arms, the fullness and pressure of the plug all combine into a sensory overload that takes him to a different space, a floaty, warm sense of complete and perfect submission. He trusts John utterly.
“Okay.” Seb swallows, squares his shoulders, and it breaks Jim’s heart to see him try so hard to be brave. “Okay, Jim.” He kisses his fingers and presses them to the vidscreen before ending the call.
The following day is January 5, the day before Sherlock’s birthday, and he’s combating the post-Christmas lull in cases by testing drying rates by colour of the four leading brands of nail polish--the nail salon homicides had proven unexpectedly fascinating--while John goes out to do the shopping, claiming the fumes are giving him a headache and making sure to open a window on his way out.
John realises he’s the one holding back. He thinks about the things he’s wanted to say ever since he returned--and much longer than that, if he’s being completely honest with himself. Why is he keeping himself back? Why is he harboring reservations, when Sherlock is giving John his own heart so freely?
“It’s very that nice you two are so happy together,” she says, her voice high and tight with indignation. “But there’s some activities that are to be kept in your flat. We will be having a very serious discussion tomorrow about appropriate behavior.”
Tamara takes the picture, studies it carefully. “Her hair wasn’t blonde," she notes. "She had a scarf on, a hijab like a Muslim lady wears, but it had slipped back a bit and i could see the hair above her ears was black, or dark brown. And she had sunglasses on, covering most of her face. But aside from that…” She hands the photo back to Sherlock. “It definitely could have been her.”
Adrenaline floods John’s system, leaving him with a deadly calm clarity. He looks evenly at the larger man’s frankly unpleasant visage.
The welt is perfectly centred on the left cheek of Sherlock’s arse. It isn’t large -- perhaps the diameter of a pound coin -- but it is undeniably swollen and angry, with a red ring spreading out from the raised area.
“You’re up here in your head, aren’t you? Acting out your role. That’s not how things are going to go tonight, my dear.” He places two fingers under Sherlock’s chin, tipping his head up.
Lights from passing spinners illuminate the kitchen window, strobe across Sherlock’s sharp, almost otherworldly features, paint him in alternating stripes of light and shadow.
,” he sighs, as Sherlock nibbles at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, reaching down between their bodies and wrapping his fingers around John’s aching and neglected cock. He should be angry, John thinks dimly, but how can he be angry when Sherlock is naked and wet and touching him like
John sleeps for most of the trip, blearily rousing when the cab pulls up to the kerb in front of 221B. He allows Sherlock to take his hand and lead him through the front door, up the steps, into the flat. He scrubs at his eyes as Sherlock guides his jacket off his shoulders and hangs in on the wall hook.
“You’re both in debt,” Sherlock continues, undeterred. “You’ve the right thumb of an internet addict, so I’m thinking online gambling. Her shoes say compulsive shopping problem. You talked her into it, didn’t you? You promised her no one would get hurt.”
For a moment John's vision darkens at the edges and he fleetingly wonders if he's going to pass out. He takes a deep breath, the moment passes, and the entire awful train of thought is brought up short when Glenn returns a few minutes later, to help John through the herculean effort of pissing on his own for the first time since the shooting.
Every evening John waits until precisely 5:01, then drinks scotch until night descends and he is finally able to succumb to a thin, restless sleep.
His slightly puffy, red-rimmed eyes give the only indication that anything at all may be out of the ordinary this morning.
Mary tilts her head in consideration. “You know, you could have accomplished all that a lot more safely by having me arrested in my kitchen,” she points out.
“You and Myc would play for hours in the rock pools, finding those little crabs and the pointy things… what are they called, love --”
Just a few blocks away, though, the facade crumbles rapidly, and the squalid edges peek out from under the cracks in the colourful veneer, poverty and neglect obvious in both the buildings and the people lounging in the doorways and loitering on street corners.
John enters his flat and slams the door in Sherlock’s face. Regrets it immediately. Pulls the door open and turns away, unwilling (unable) to look Sherlock in the eye in that moment. John moves through his dark, cluttered-verging-on-filthy flat, pours himself two fingers of synthetic Scotch before he even takes his coat off. “You want a drink?” he asks.
Base animal need clouding his brain, John can’t (won’t) stop his body’s responses; his pelvis flexes against the mattress, rutting the underside of his aching, engorged cock against the roughness of the cheap, overlaundered cotton. It’s a welcome frisson of sensation, but nowhere near enough, so he raises up a little higher on his knees, pressing his hips upward, offering himself completely to Sherlock’s voracious mouth while also snaking a hand underneath his own body. John takes hold of himself, the hot palm rough and dry and tight around his throbbing cock, and gives a long, low groan of pleasure.
The rope fastening his wrists to the headboard has enough give to allow Sherlock to turn onto his back with John’s assistance. The movement makes the toy shift inside him and he whimpers at the sensation, feeling his cock dribble out precome as the plug presses against his prostate.
Sherlock drops gracefully to his knees, his back straight, hands clasped behind his back, his heels tucked neatly under his arse. He drops his eyes to the floor, perfectly trained, perfectly submissive. John opens the bedside table drawer, pulls out the thick black leather collar, fastens it around his long neck with practiced hands before running his fingers through Sherlock’s tangled curls, grabbing a handful and tugging his head up firmly for a kiss.
“This is intended to look, at first glance, like a mistaken delivery,” he says, focused and deliberate. “But upon closer examination, none of it makes sense on the surface. It was delivered not just the wrong room or floor, but the wrong wing entirely. That’s not a mixup by a teenaged volunteer. That’s
“And he parks in disabled spaces.” John shakes his head in disbelief as Sherlock finds a street parking spot two blocks away from the office. “Does this guy have any good points whatsoever?”
“I…” John groans quietly as Sherlock’s teeth graze against his ear, wet tongue tasting his earlobe. “I’m just making sure.”
John purses his lips in a bit of confusion, but peels himself off of Sherlock and crosses the room, hard cock flushed and bobbing foolishly as he bends to dig into the pockets of Sherlock’s military field jacket. He finds his quarry, extracting an unopened tube of medical-style lubricant from the depths of the inner breast pocket, extends it towards Sherlock in the palm of his open hand.
“Well. Um. Good to know, I guess,” says John, looking up at the night sky, seemingly a bit at a loss for words.
Sherlock roots around the glove box and unearths an ancient cough drop. He unwraps it, hands it to John.
“I’m an idiot,” is all he says, quietly, then leans forward, slips a hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, and kisses him.
“Bend your leg at the knee.” Sherlock presses his fingers expertly into the meat of John’s hip flexor, massaging out the cramp. It passes in a few moments, as quickly as it came on.
“All the numbers on the card, put together. Ten digits. What common string of numbers contain ten digits?”
“I know,” says Louellen. “At least, I know now. That’s why she went to Pete first, I’d wager. Or rather, his wife. She is--was--a nurse, quite a while back. There have always been whispers about her, about how she helps women, mostly younger ones, in situations like this. Fixing things for ones not as far along, if you catch my meaning, and for the ones past that point....She had connections, ways to find people who want a baby and don’t want to go through the usual channels." She sighs a little, shrugs her shoulders, and to John she somehow she looks a bit older and more tired than just a few minutes before. "Bear in mind, though, I'm making educated guesses. I never actually saw her. I don't think she trusted me enough to confide in me. We spoke on the phone twice, but I didn’t ever see her in person and she never said anything directly to me about...personal matters.”
John took his time, spooling out Sherlock’s anxiety while he mapped his approach methodically--Sherlock had very little padding on his spare frame, thoughtful placement was essential-- and finally began to place the clothespins carefully, kissing each spot before pinching Sherlock’s pale flesh in between the wooden clips. He placed six on each inner thigh, from the inside of Sherlock’s knee all the way up to the crease of his groin. Next were five on each side of his belly, placed carefully in a line on the minimal bit of spare flesh around his navel. Sherlock started to squirm and tense as the pinch of the clips grew into a hot, biting burn. John paused, wound a hand into his warm damp hair and pulled hard in warning.
“I apologise Mister Holmes, sir, I do,” the man pants, eyes wide and watering with pain. “I’m so sorry, I really am, I apologise -- ”
“Well, yes, he was,” says John, his lips twitching into the barest grin. “But, to be fair, he did have the occasional moment of brilliance.”
“Large parts of this country are actually lovely,” John murmurs dryly. “The Grand Canyon. Yosemite. The Empire State Building. All gorgeous. Or so I’m told. But what do I get instead? A guided tour of the most tragic, abandoned rubbish-strewn outposts of the urban East Coast.”
He hasn’t left her side the entire time, trying to coax her into taking tiny sips of the tinned soup Sherlock heats over the Bunsen burner, wringing out cool cloths for her burning forehead, murmuring nonsense words of reassurance as she moans and weeps in semi consciousness.
“What happens next?” John asks the empty room, not even quite aware he’s speaking aloud, giving voice to the doubts and fears of his heart. “Even if it does end well, if we find her and take her home. What happens next?”
Sherlock lets John invade his mouth, gags as his glans hits the back of his throat, wills himself to relax and allow John to take him, use him, defile him. John groans and thrusts upward, his hand tight in the curls at the back of Sherlock’s head.
John nods, wrapping his right arm around Sherlock’s slender back as he turns his head, spits indelicately into his left palm before wrapping it around Sherlock’s stiff cock and stroking him in long firm pulls. The feel of him in John’s hand is exquisite, soft hot silk over rigid steel, and John works him insistently, relentlessly, making Sherlock moan wordlessly as instinct and need take over, his hips thrusting, pushing his straining cock up into John’s tight fist.
John wakes to the dim, still grey of a very early morning. He’s warm, too warm, sheets and blanket tangled around his body. Sherlock’s heavy hot weight is pressed against his back; he’s snoring softly into the damp curve of his neck, sleep-sour breath hot against his skin, his morning erection rock hard and undulating gently but insistently into the small of John’s back.
When he enters his room, gingerly holding the two steaming mugs, Sherlock is still on his bed. He ignores John, completely engrossed in the pictures tacked on the wall next to it. John brings the mugs over and sets them on the nightstand.
This statement concerns the Ares III mission, part of the Ares Program, which was intended to be a month-long mission to further examine the biological, atmospheric and geological history of Mars in an effort to learn what is was that depleted the planet’s atmosphere and depleted its oceans.
We’d also need to steal a booster from the H.O.U.N.D. project. We don’t have the time to build one, and that’s the only one that could do the job.
He’d probably never had done any of the stupid things boys did at school, or in college. Get drunk together, playing stupid pranks… He looked at Sherlock’s face, innocent and soft while he slept, and suddenly saw the opportunity for what it was. They had done a lot of things together that were normal for most mates, but new to Sherlock. Why not expand his experience some more?
: He’s been, uh, pimping one of the rovers, basically. As you can see there, he’s taken some solar cells and added them to the roof. We also think he’s been using the second rover for parts, so he can prolong the battery life. He’ll be able to drive for longer periods of time.
In other words: I have a lot of research to do, but it’s not like I have much else to do anyway. I’m pretty excited, to be honest! Driving sounds way more fun than farming in any case.
“John?” Sherlock looked at him questioningly, a little crease between his brows. John’s hand was hovering between the bowl and Sherlock, and the cloth had been dripping on his jeans. Right. He cleared his throat again.
Although Sherlock was oddly touched, he still huffed and sulked all the way back to 221B, where he dropped on the sofa and ignored John, thinking about several ways he could put the maggots to use in combination with John’s sock drawer. When John brought him a cup of tea in a clear attempt to pacify him, he softened a bit.
I’ll need to make sure the potatoes are well looked after before I go and I need enough supplies to keep me alive for the journey.
Anyway, it took me a while, but I got into the safety of the Hab, got my helmet off without moving my shoulder too much, took a deep breath of sweet sweet oxygen and went to my natural habitat: the medical bay. Because in addition to being the resident biologist, I’m also the flight surgeon.
I do not want to endanger their mission any further. Again, I only think about their safety. I suggest you do the same.
John watches the ice cubes in his glass as they tinkle against each other. A summer sound, he thinks. Sherlock takes Lilly’s small hand in his huge ones.
I’ve managed to attach the pop-tents to the Hab. It was frustrating at first, because in theory the airlocks from the pop-tents can connect to other airlocks. The only problem is that they were designed to use with the Rovers, and their airlocks are a lot smaller than the Hab airlocks, which would mean I’d lose a lot of air each time I want to go in - and I’ll have to go in at least once a day. Of course, in normal circumstances, there wouldn’t be any reason to attach pop-tents to the Hab at all.
“Why don’t you go check on the hives, love?” He turns, and the sunlight hits Sherlock just so. Just for a second, they’re young again.
The sound of a throat being cleared was like a gunshot. They both looked up to see Lestrade silhouetted against the dull light of the streetlamps behind him. He shuffled his feet a little.
According to analysts, the best rescue option would be to travel to the Ares IV site, could that be what he’s planning?
SH: The direction he took triggered my memory. I had to check to be sure, but the coordinates match with Watson’s direction, and it’s also a longer trip, so that fits with the data as well.
: If we manage to make the MDV less heavy, they could land at the Ares III site before lifting off again and landing at the Ares IV site. It wouldn’t be without risk, but it’s the best option for now.
The solar cells were pretty easy to fix. I set it up with Knight and we’d spent weeks practicing setting the solar array up during training - it’s a critical part of the mission, if we screwed up, it would mean the end of our time on Mars. Taking away some of the cells seemed a bit wrong, but it wasn’t hard to do. They fit on the roof of the Rover easily, so I think I might be ready for some real test drives!
John thought about how Sherlock’s life was before he had come along. Sherlock never talked about it, but he knew he never had a friend like him before, one that helped him on cases and stayed after the deductions were explained. The thought of Sherlock eating alone in his flat after he solved a case made him feel strangely emotional.
: It was very moving. We now know, of course, that John did survive. How do you think he’s doing, based on your professional knowledge?
It had been a nice case, nothing too complicated. After all the drama they had been through, it was great to have a classic puzzle like this again, where they could fall back into their old routine. Sherlock was always at least two steps ahead of everyone else, with John blindly following him and ready to throw both compliments and punches as needed. The case involved a good long chase across London and Sherlock crawling through a window and getting his hand cut on a shard of glass. It ended with Sherlock smugly spewing deductions and explaining details to John (and Greg who had turned up eventually) while John had the suspect pinned to the floor.
If I want to improve the Potato Problem, I need more land to farm on. The Hab is too small, I think I need at least 4 times the surface to plant on. I can use the bunk beds, I’m not using them anyway, and some of the lab tables. But I’d still need more.
“We’ll find it, love”, John soothes. “Let’s have some tea first, alright? I’ve bought those apple tarts you love so much. Lisette says she makes them just for you, I guess she still wants to steal you away.”
Later, when the first shock had died down, and Sherlock had a lot more data about kissing and more specifically
The cloth fell on the floor between them with a wet plop as they both surged forward and pressed their mouths together. John’s hand tightened in Sherlock’s hair while his other hand moved to cup his jaw. He pulled back a little and the dazed look on Sherlock’s face ignited a flame in his chest and he was overcome with a bright wave of happiness. Sherlock smiled at him, looking as if John was an unsolvable puzzle. John pulled him back in, using his hand to angle Sherlock’s face a little and brushed their lips together again slowly. It was clear Sherlock didn’t have a lot of experience with this, and he felt a little thrill go up his spine at the thought of it being Sherlock’s first proper kiss. Sherlock’s lips were dry and warm. John nipped at the plush bottom lip, tasting coffee and sugar, and felt Sherlock shiver under his hands. He smiled against his mouth, now catching Sherlock’s upper lip between his and flicking his tongue against it. Sherlock gasped, but John just continued lightly licking his lips, and it didn’t take long before Sherlock began copying him hesitantly, softly biting and tasting John and his hands came up to cradle John’s face, keeping them close together.
Sherlock was still buzzing with energy, radiating waves of euphoria, despite the sure signs of exhaustion underneath. John loved to see him like this - proud, tall and giddy as a boy at the same time. John himself was closer to being dead on his feet, but the adrenaline was still raging through his system and he managed to keep up with Sherlock’s explanations long enough to throw in some words of praise.
John chuckled. “Oh, you are a bad man, Sherlock. Let’s get that face cleaned up, yeah? I’ll get a cloth.”
Turns out that I’m not that hot after all. After about an hour of driving I had to choose between keeping at it or keeping my balls. So I turned the heater on and went back to the Hab. You’re welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
“John,” he replied, taking Sherlock’s hand in his. “So, Sherlock, fancy a dance then?” John grinned, not letting go of his hand, but using it to pull Sherlock away from the bar and into the crowd on the dancefloor. The DJ had switched from a slow dance to upbeat rock-n-roll, which made Sherlock a little nervous.
This will be a media NIGHTMARE! How are we going to spin this? We’ve just dealt with the fact of him being dead!
I’ll have to set a fire in the Hab. Fire is possibly the worst thing that can happen, in normal circumstances. The guys at NASA would lose their head if they knew about my plans.
Tiredness forgotten, John swallowed hard and stepped back, trying to remind himself and Sherlock both that they were still in public. Unfortunately, the move only made it easier for Sherlock to crowd him against the wall behind his back. Sherlock loomed over him, placing his gloved hands on either side of John’s head, caging him in. They didn’t say anything, Sherlock challenging him with an intense look. Then his gaze slowly moved from John’s eyes to his mouth, and John felt raw attraction flare up between them, urging him to take and devour.
I suppose I have to be like Phil, and use the time I have in a productive way. Would be cool if I could learn to play the piano while I’m here.
He still doesn’t understand how Sherlock doesn’t know. Sherlock knows everything about everybody in one glance, but he seems oblivious to Johns intentions in setting up this stupid study date. He can’t rely on Sherlock simply figuring it out. He can’t wait any longer, he can’t keep it contained, he feels so wound up around Sherlock lately. It needs to be over today.
Naturally, we will make sure we have maximum satellite time for you, we’ll discuss it in the meeting as well.
We’re organising a ceremony for John soon. We want to give all of you the chance to say a few words, if you want. Don’t feel obligated, I understand if you’d rather not. We can have you broadcasted live and you will be able to follow the proceedings. Let me know if you want to be a part of this, and please send me your texts so we can run them by Irene. It will be broadcast worldwide, so we have to let Media Relations check all of our communication for the memorial.
Sherlock’s expression suddenly changes from accusing to something like fear and a faint pinkness colours his cheeks.
John felt his face heat up, the memories of his stag night flooding back. He hadn’t realised what it all had meant, not until Sherlock’s speech, and by then he had made his choice. John wasn’t someone to go back on his steps. When Sherlock was gone, he had mourned him, and the feelings he’d never expressed. Mary had come out of nowhere, a light in the darkness. And then the stupid git had come back, and it all went tits-up. But despite his confusion, he had made a promise, and he had intended to keep it. Of course, when Mary didn’t turn out to be who he thought she was, that changed everything. Between him and Mary, anyway.
“Nothing complicated,” Sherlock replies. "He has cases in Family Court on Thursday mornings, and his office hours are from noon until five. We’ll arrive shortly before twelve and get in to see him.”
“I know there’s a bigger picture,” Sherlock replies. “I don’t care. All I want is information on Maria.”
Sherlock’s legs suddenly feel too rubbery to hold his weight, and he sags heavily against the wall as the realization hits him.
“You’re so beautiful like this,” John sighed, stroking the crest of Sherlock’s hip, reinforcing the shift away from Sherlock’s brain down into the sensations of his body. “My perfect, perfect creature. Do you have any idea how gorgeous you are?”
Sherlock chews, swallows. Puts the fork down. “The homeless population is very closed off, highly suspicious of outsiders, and for very good reasons. They consider the police the enemy. They won’t talk to the police, but they will talk to me. The quickest way to get the information I need is to go to the source, and time is of the essence if we hope to find these men alive.”
“Here is fine,” John replies. He usually tends to Sherlock’s many minor injuries under the brighter lights of the kitchen, but he decides to not make Sherlock get up, instead, crossing the sitting room and placing the first aid box onto the side table next to Sherlock before sinking down to his knees in between his spread thighs.
John has absolutely no choice then but to kiss him, wrapping a hand around his neck to pull him close enough to press their mouths together. Sherlock responds in kind, heartfelt, his lips parted just slightly, hot and soft, the tip of his tongue just barely brushing John’s own.
He had been so focused on the details he hadn't seen what should have been immediately, stupendously obvious.
Sherlock has put aside thoughts of their interaction this morning, and the repercussions that await him, for the entire day while he focused all of his energy on solving the case.
He takes a deep, careful breath, then turns and walks back into the hotel room without another word. He flips the security latch to keep the door from closing fully, then pushes it shut to keep out the acrid sting tobacco smoke. And maybe, a little, to erect a physical barrier between himself and Sherlock, to give himself a little space so he doesn’t snap, doesn’t give in to the undeniable desire to go back outside and say something harsh and unkind he will later regret.
(John had only done the most rudimentary packing when he first left, in that terrible time after Sherlock’s fall. He had always intended to get the belongings he left behind, but somehow he never did, and now John realizes for the first time that somewhere deep inside he had always been hedging his bets, somewhere deep inside he had always thought--always
The three men crowd into the small room. The pharmacy technician, Tamara, hovers at the doorway, seemingly uncertain as to whether or not she’s been summoned.
“No, it’s fine,” John reassures him before he can even open his mouth to speak. “I’m just--it’s a bit different, you know?”
“Well, that’s good,” Mrs Hudson says, but she remains unconvinced; John can plainly hear the skepticism in her voice.
“I was tested monthly for six months after my drugs lapse. You were tested for STI’s when you learned of Mary’s infidelity, as well as six weeks after. We’re both completely clean, and you’re the only person I’m ever going to have sex with, and I’m the last person you’re ever going to have sex with. I don’t want to use condoms.”
Midnight comes and goes. John considers switching from tea to scotch, decides against it in case sudden, decisive action is required.
“I don’t want harm to come to Katie, either,” he says. “But they both have to lie in the bed they made, and I wasn’t about to risk your daughter’s life, or yours, to spare theirs.” He considers for a brief moment, then nods. “I don’t regret our decision. Nor should you.”
“So many nights, John,” Sherlock murmurs softly, so softly he may be talking only to himself. “So many nights in so many rooms, I would sit and talk to you just like this, and you would keep me company, you would answer me, you would illuminate what I couldn’t see for myself. I would think I could hear your voice, sometimes, you were so real to me.
John uses Sherlock’s arm to lever himself to and carefully hops on, feeling the uniquely supreme self-consciousness only hospital wheelchairs can provide. Sherlock shoulders both of their bags, and opens the door so the nurse can maneuver John out of the room.
“Can I help you?” It’s a woman’s voice; she sounds slightly out of breath, as if she just ran down a hallway.
He’s beginning to drift, only vaguely aware of Sherlock’s large warm hands tugging up the thin blanket and tucking it around his shoulders.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in frank irritation.“Good Lord, Johnson, I’m trying to arrive at a figure so I can make you an offer, perhaps you could stop staring like a cow looking at an oncoming train and give us something to work with?”
Sitting alone on a park bench, his tea long since gone cold, John takes a deep breath and tries saying the truth out loud for the first time in his entire life.
He’s dealt with the whispers and sidelong stares from the nurses. Accepted the overly polite distance of the other doctors.
Before the cresting pain can recede, John hits him again, lower down across the backs of his thighs. His back shudders and bows, but Sherlock doesn’t let go of the headboard, his knuckles white as he grips the dark brown wood.
Sitting alone on a park bench, his tea long since gone cold, John takes a deep breath and tries saying the truth out loud for the first time in his entire life.
With Sherlock’s assistance and patience, John steps into his pants, and Sherlock helps him pull them up to his hips.
When he returns to the kitchen he sees Sherlock has finished off the entire bottle of water. “All yours,” he says to Sherlock, opening the fridge and grabbing a water for himself.
In his more maudlin moments, John thinks he loved Sherlock before he ever even met him, that the instantaneous pull he felt that day in Barts was not so much animal desire as it was relief, recognition, an unnamed bone-deep need fulfilled at long last.
John presses one final kiss to Sherlock’s thigh before sitting back on his heels, stroking his hands possessively down the pale flesh of Sherlock’s legs, fine sparse body hair glittering auburn in the firelight. He slides up his torso, grasps his wrists, pins them above his head as he kisses him, the taste of Sherlock’s body still on his lips.
“All of this.” John gestures with the mug at… well, at nothing, really. At everything. “Being here. The baby. What happened to Mycroft. It’s my fault, all of it, and I’m sorry. Fuck, Sherlock. I’m so sorry.”
He lets himself cry, just a little, as he tries to figure out exactly how he wants to tell this story.
John shakes his head, stubbornly rejecting the tendril of understanding trying to snake through him.
Tonight, in the dark grey gloom, the kisses are slow, deep, their tongues twining together wet and messy as their bodies press tightly into one another, their cocks hard, achingly hard against each other. John is making soft, needy little noises into Sherlock’s mouth, his hands running restlessly up and down his back before sliding down to the crest of his hips, skimming across the waistband of his worn blue track bottoms.
He pulls his head back to look into John’s eyes, celadon irises glittering, pupils wide and black in the low grey light, unshed tears clinging to long dark lashes.
“Have a seat, Doctor Watson,” he says, the edge of a sneer in his tone. “You don’t want to endanger your recovery, after all.”
, but scaling it nonetheless--and dropping down on the other side, landing on his feet and managing to not break an ankle in the process.
“Then why would he agree to the hit, clearly knowing we intend to take out his newly-acquired resource?”
Then the spell breaks, and Sherlock remembers himself and recoils suddenly, as if slapped. He scrambles to his feet, grabbing his coat and making for the front door. He puts his hand on the handle, starts to pull it open; John is right behind him and slams it shut with his forearm, harder than he intended in his frustration.
By the time the procedure is finished, John feels like a hundred kilometers of bad road. He’s exhausted, he’s lost a bit more blood than is generally advisable, he’s dehydrated, and to top it off he’s sobered up enough to feel the beginnings of a hangover coming on. He must look as bad as he feels, because Sherlock, stripping off the nitrile gloves, takes one look at his face and stands abruptly.
“But,” Sherlock says. “On the inside of you, there’s a whole universe. Solar systems and galaxies and supernovas and nebulae and quasars. Is quasar a real word? It feels funny on my tongue.”
So Evelyn quashed it, then, at least to some extent. John doesn’t quite know how to feel about that. He settles on relieved, with a side of gratitude in knowing that the long reach of British intelligence kept him from getting entangled in the terrifying gears of the American criminal justice system.
John thinks about stroking his arm, or holding his hand, but decides it’s been far too draining a night to ask for any more than what Sherlock’s already so bravely given to him.
John exhales. Shakes his head. “I was worried, and made a choice. It was wrong of me, and I know that. I’m sorry, I am, but I didn’t do it to hurt you. I did it to help.”
Sherlock flings his upper body up and forward in one lightning-fast movement, butting the man squarely between the eyes with all his strength. The man staggers back with a thick, clogged-sounding cry, blood streaming from his nose. John launches himself at the larger man’s back, wraps his left arm around his neck, pressing square on his windpipe as his right hand wrenches the goon’s wrist hard, sending the gun clattering to the floor.
“Not your buddy, mate,” John replies. “And you don’t seem to understand that we didn’t come all this way to not get what we want.”
Sherlock whimpers, just a little, low in his throat, his cock growing quickly hotter and harder in John’s fist.
Sherlock doesn’t even answer, just snatches his cigarettes off the desk and stalks out the door, not even bothering to pull it shut behind him.
“Mary told me... well, she said you married her under false pretenses. That you were having an affair with Sherlock but you were in the closet, conflicted about the whole thing. I wouldn’t have kept seeing her, but... she said she was lonely.” David finds a bit of courage, straightens his back, looks John in the eye. “Is it true?”
“You’re amazing,” John tells him, and Sherlock smiles again, a shy grin that makes his angular, otherworldly features look silly and utterly human.
At the very least, John needs to admit they’re both pretty terrible at this before he can try to do better.
“And just so you know,” John adds, voice low and dangerous, “Sherlock Holmes is worth ten thousand times more than all of you put together.” He pulls on his jacket and leaves the pub, heart hammering but head held high.
. He hates it. It’s ninety percent of why he likes a drink probably more than he ought. He’s proper, he’s inarguably overly repressed, but he knows himself. He’s not un-self-aware. And despite what Sherlock says, he’s not an idiot.)
, John”) drinking a very nice lager early on a Tuesday afternoon. The local brew is honestly quite tasty, or very possibly the fact that he hasn’t had a pint in weeks is affecting his perception.
“No, love,” John sighs, breathing heavily. “It’s so good, it’s too good. If you keep that up, we’re not going to make it to what you asked for.” He plucks Sherlock’s hand from where it rests on his hip. “Come here, you gorgeous thing,” he murmurs. Sherlock slides up his body and kisses him, lips and chin wet with saliva, and he tastes himself on Sherlock’s tongue and it’s filthy and arousing and marvellous.
“Tiresome,” Sherlock says, in that dismissive, bored voice that seems designed to target John’s last fraying nerve. “All of it.”
“I see a gorgeous, shameless whore,” John murmurs in his ear, "spread open for me, helpless and desperate and aching to come.” John’s fingers slide back up to stroke his neck, his cheek. Sherlock is unable to stop the needy, animal noises coming from his throat as his pelvis twitches, rutting against nothing, his body burning with his need for contact.
“I wonder, now, if Moriarty was ultimately the mastermind behind it all. I mean, I suppose it’s possible that sadistic homosexual rapist crime lords are a dime a dozen in Eastern Europe, or that my ending up in Rajakovic’s clutches was purely coincidental, but in my experiences coincidences are seldom truly that random, and my instincts tell me this doesn’t
Task completed, John washes his hands and dries them on one of the soft and obviously expensive taupe cotton hand towels hanging next to the vanity before returning to the bedroom.
“I’ve made my mind up,” John replies, also for the hundredth time. “I’m mostly out of the woods now, and we have urgent matters to attend to.”
“Not even a toaster’s distant cousin,” Sherlock answers. “Of course, this fact has not been made public for a number of reasons. Legal as well as ethical.”
Neither one makes any attempt to move, though, as sleepy post-morning sex lassitude creeps over them, lulling them back into slumber despite sticky skin and full bladders.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I’ve had enough of this country for several lifetimes. Never setting foot here again, if I can possibly avoid it.”
Not because it’s complicated. It’s dead simple really, boxed spaghetti topped with jarred marinara and toasted garlic bread alongside. Sherlock seldom cooks but he’s very good at it when he does, boiling the pasta to the perfect point just past al dente and expertly doctoring the sauce with red wine and oregano. John hasn’t had a bite to eat in weeks that wasn’t either crap takeaway or underseasoned, vaguely gooey hospital food, and everything tastes marvellous.
"John,” Sherlock murmurs, his voice soft, coloured with his own profound grief. One warm strong arm wraps around him, anchoring him, so carefully pulling him close. “Oh, John.” Sherlock holds him as he cries, rubbing gentle circles into his back with his long fingers.
Sherlock curls his naked body into a fetal position, shivering, trying desperately to hold the sobs at bay.
John gives the casserole a pass (she knows he doesn’t eat meat, of course, but for some reason Mrs Hudson never thinks chicken counts) but takes generous helpings of salad and potatoes and two buttered rolls, and finds himself cleaning his plate while Mrs Hudson fills him in on the latest news about Baker Street. He listens with genuine interest as she recounts the latest chapter in Mr Chatterjee’s ongoing familial drama and the Davidson’s possible marital breakdown after 45 years together.
“Easy there,” John mumbles, looping an arm around Sherlock’s waist, then pulling him close, the warm heat of him radiating through Sherlock’s thin cotton shirt. He mouths gently at Sherlock’s neck. “Having a bit of a time keeping upright?”
He reached out with his right hand and stroked Sherlock’s full bottom lip with his thumb. Sherlock opened his mouth and John slipped his thumb inside the wet heat. Sherlock suckled willingly, eagerly, and John was swept by a wave of intense desire.
“He’s right, John.” Lestrade looks at both of them, shoulders straight, gaze even. “I should have known. The fact that an obvious homicide was ignored like this is reprehensible. And I am deeply sorry. Sherlock, I promise you I will do everything I can to make this right, and to try to keep it from ever happening again.”
The man looks at John. John nods solemnly in agreement, gestures at the car with the muzzle of his gun.
Another question is forming in John’s mind, and he discovers he’s been actually wondering this ever since he learned of Alex Johnson’s existence.
Sherlock’s face is a thundercloud of annoyed worry, but he doesn’t argue with John. He exhales, tilts his chin upward, shrugs one shoulder just a fraction to indicate his outnumbered, very reluctant agreement.
“Thank you,” John replies, surprised. He tries and fails to think of something else to add, before Sherlock steers him out of the room with a hand pressed lightly to his shoulder blade.
“I know,” John says. “It was a real mess there, for a good long time. Took all the king’s horses and all the king’s men to save my arm, and even then the infections almost did me in.”
Seb squeals and jumps, darts out of the entranceway, dropping his battered shoulder bag as he scrambles away. He pauses, turns back, eyes the woman with a carefully calculated air of frightened, childlike uncertainty.
John picks up the tea and sips; it’s a mintyish herbal, far from his favourite, but it’s hot and Sherlock added just a touch of honey and John accepts that caffeine at 7:47 pm may not be the best idea for him right now.
They don’t speak as John washes two glasses, pours a generous measure of vodka in each. He hands one to Sherlock.
“What about his partner, Bonner?” John asks as they wait. Sherlock presses the button again. “Is he involved?”
Both of them go quiet, gazing at each other with open affection, the air between them thick with unspoken sentiment as the minutes tick by.
“I’ll give you something to do,” John says in a low, husky, come-hither voice, and the innuendo is so terrible Sherlock can’t help but laugh even as the words send a frisson of heat racing along his nerves.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock. I would so much rather have talked to you, but in case you didn’t notice you’ve been freezing me out completely, it’s like the Arctic fucking Circle in here and--”
He crosses the sitting room, makes his way to the small powder room at the end of the hallway. It’s fussy and overdecorated, everything he dislikes, frosted glass wall sconces and flocked velvet wallpaper, another vase of flowers on the back of the toilet tank. There’s a crystal bowl of potpourri on the counter next to the sink, and the weirdly cinnamonish smell makes him a bit queasy all over again.
“It must just tear you up inside to admit that,” John says evenly, trying to hide his utter surprise that Sherlock would acknowledge gaining anything at all of value from psychotherapy.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asks, his voice breaking, his breathing as rough and ragged as if he had just run a punishing race.
Sherlock places John’s drink in the cupholder before unwrapping one of the straws and stabbing it into the lid of his smoothie. He takes a sip, makes a squinty confused face.
“Of course I’m not going to kill him,” John sighs, peering out the window, willing a long black car to come around the corner. “I’m just very pissed off right now. And scared, yeah. Scared to death, in fact.”
Sherlock hesitates, then nods, crosses the small room in three steps, taking the jumper off and tossing it over the desk chair before perching carefully the edge of the bed. His back is straight, body tensed as if ready to flee at any moment.
Sherlock scans the texts, hands the phone back to John. “This will be very helpful. Won’t take me long to fix something up.”
And maybe... maybe he’s been wrong. Maybe that defensive stance has blinded him to the Sherlock that has been right in front of him for almost two years.
He smells of sex and cigarettes and mouthwash and night air, and the knot in John’s chest--the one he hadn’t he even allowed himself to acknowledge--well, it doesn’t disappear, not entirely, but it loosens. Considerably.
As far as John is concerned, though, a lull in the frenetic pace of their lives is welcome right at this moment.
John sits on on the bed to the right of Sherlock, laying out supplies, pulling on a pair of sterile gloves. He dresses the thoracotomy incision quickly and neatly, taping gauze into place, then slides to the floor, kneeling in between Sherlock’s legs as he tears open a single use packet of Bacitracin, applies the antibiotic ointment to the small, concave wound.
Louellen regards him with a chilly smile. “No it won’t,” she says, calm and even, refusing to be baited.
John shuffles into the bathroom, relieves his full-to-bursting bladder, and splashes water on his face before reaching for his toothbrush. As he brushes, he notices the third-morning stubble on his cheeks, a day or two away from becoming an actual beard, unmistakably gingerish on his jaw and chin. He makes a mental note to pick up some normal, non-lethal safety razors before the facial situation gets out of hand.
“It’s a blessing,” Sherlock agrees, gentle teasing in his tone. He hands the laptop over to John. “See if this meets your approval.”
In the same moment Sherlock begins to pivot on one knee, shifting his weight just barely to the left as he prepares to dive for the gun on the floor. Maria trains the gun back on him instantaneously without even sparing him a glance.
For a moment John thinks Sherlock’s already asleep--then his eyes open, just a bit, and he regards John with a sleepy, heavy-lidded gaze, his defenses down, pupils wide and dark and irises luminous silver-blue in the low light.
“I know. I do. It’s all right.” John wants to kiss and hold him so badly that resisting the pull is causing an actual physical ache in his chest. He draws in a fortifying inhale instead, nudges Sherlock in the ribs. “Go now, before she spots you.”
He slides himself down John’s torso, nestles in between his spread legs, nudges his thighs apart with his hands as he looks up, a bit uncertain.
In his preoccupied mental state, John had neglected to shut off the lights when he left the bathroom earlier. Now, the amber-tinted light filters softly through the frosted glass of the door, giving the bedroom a dreamy, shadowed aura as he turns to face Sherlock, his fingers still tangled with Sherlock’s much longer ones.
“John. I'm so glad you could make it to my little party.” Her natural accent is American, a bit nasal, vaguely but not definitively Mid-Atlantic, with her rhotic R softened by years of cultivating a British accent. She tilts her head, and for a single second her expression is unnervingly snake-like, true to her nickname. Then she smiles, something falsely bright with far too many teeth, and for the first time John feels a cold pinprick of true fear breaking through his defenses.
It’s nothing at all, really. Nothing exciting or pulse-poundingly dangerous or especially mentally taxing, just two middle-aged married blokes, eating lunch together on a Saturday afternoon.
“Yeah,” John breathes, raising his hips off the bed so Sherlock can slide his briefs down and off. His trapped cock springs free from the confines of damp fabric, curving up towards his belly, already a deep dusky red, foreskin fully retracted, the broad head shiny wet with precome.
They’re still not looking at each other, nor are they touching, but the distance between them is not cold or stony; rather, it’s diffident, careful, somehow full of portent as they hang up their coats on the wall hooks with a quiet, focused care.
Sherlock makes a tiny, barely audible groan as he takes hold of John’s hair and begins to fuck his mouth in earnest, his thrusts growing steadier, more insistent as sensation and instinct begin to override his conscious thought. John can’t help but moan a little at the sensation of it, at the way his lips stretch around Sherlock’s girth as saliva gathers and pools and drips from the edges of his mouth, the hot smooth flesh of his cock filling his mouth so completely.
He trails off, losing the thought midway through, gazing up at Sherlock in befuddlement. Whatever he had been saying a moment ago seems irrelevant, unimportant.
“That’s... yeah. That’s good.” Sherlock takes a swallow of amber liquid, then holds up the glass and lifts an eyebrow. “Haven’t got started on number one yet, I see.”
Sherlock drops his gaze, swallows thickly, shakes his head. “Don’t say that,” he mutters hoarsely. “This all happened because of me, all of it. Don’t you dare be sorry.”
“Are you okay for a bit while I run a bath and order some dinner?” John asks after Sherlock’s fit mellows and finally subsides.
to see her, with my own eyes. Right now. And so help me God Sherlock, I love you, you know I do, but don’t you dare try to stop me.”
Sherlock doesn’t say it back, and John doesn’t expect him too, but his breathing grows tighter, shallower.
Figueroa manages to convey the impression of rolling his eyes without actually daring to do so. "Spare me the buzzwords and the theatrics, Miss Marsh. This isn’t my first day of school, and I’ve done my homework. There is no record, anywhere, of either John Watson or Sherlock Holmes working for MI6 in any capacity.”
The two of them take slow, staggering steps to the tiny bathroom. The whole episode brings to John’s mind a pair of unsteady drunks, but with none of the fun and whole lot more agonizing pain. By the time the pair finally make it to the the loo, John’s head is spinning, his incision site on fire.
They don’t often do it this way; Sherlock is unabashed in his enjoyment of the way John fucks him, and John is enamored of Sherlock’s enthusiasm, and like all longtime couples they have fallen into a bit of a routine. But right now Sherlock is desperate to feel John, to sink into the heat of his body, to be as close to his beating heart as he possibly can. “Yes,” he purrs, pulling John’s hips tight against his own. “Yes. I would like that.” He has a moment of clarity, stills the insistent movement of his hips, picks up his head. “Are you sure your leg’s up for it?”
“You’re absolutely right,” agrees John, and pushes down the small burst of self-consciousness in his chest as he hooks his thumbs into the elastic of his boxer briefs, eases the constricting fabric carefully over his straining cock, down his hips, and off. He tosses his underwear aside and straightens his spine, chin up, boldly meeting Sherlock’s wide pale eyes.
Sherlock raises himself back up to sitting. John does the same, with a pained grunt. Sherlock gives him a sidelong glance.
John bites his lip, shuts the unpleasant thoughts away, and tries to focus on the here and now as he continues his visual survey down Sherlock’s body. The expanse of skin below his sharp collarbones is marked with a surprising number of brown freckles; most are flat, but one or two of them have raised edges, needing monitoring in future --
Patricia is beginning to hyperventilate in earnest now, her breath coming in tight shallow bursts as panic takes over.
But maybe it was a good thing in the end, painful as it was, that it took them this long to get here. If Sherlock had responded to his overtures at Angelo’s, that very first night, would John have taken him to bed then shoved him away, like he had done so many times before? It hurt his heart to think he would have likely turned away from the most amazing man in the universe because he was in denial, weak and afraid.
John puts his chart aside, brushes a lank curl out of his eyes with gentle fingertips. “Good morning, beautiful,” he says, trying to sound cheerful but not quite succeeding. “How are you feeling?”
One o’clock creeps past, and John starts to pace the length of the small sitting room, unable to stop himself, the worry and fear a hot, prickly ache in his stomach, pressing upward into his diaphragm.
“You put them in the machine and pull the handle,” Sherlock explains with surprising patience. “Or just press the button; the lever is functional, but really only present for the aesthetics.”
, but before he can give his tangled thoughts voice, the pull of bone-deep tiredness drags him under into the blessed avoidance of black, blank sleep.
“Yes,” he breathes as the burn eases, replaced by a hot, insistent, pleasurable fullness. It feels like completion, like wholeness. “Don’t stop. God, don’t ever stop.”
John is motionless, his breathing even, but under Sherlock’s cheek he can feel how rock hard he already is, his cock pushing against the fabric that constrains him; he can feel how his breath is coming in shorter and deeper breaths, almost panting, and he knows that John is just as caught up, just as profoundly entangled and affected as Sherlock is. The awareness is freeing, somehow, and deeply comforting.
“No. I was never okay with it.” Sherlock sighs. “I was seriously questioning my role in the entire enterprise. And there were always certain… inconsistencies in what I was told about my earlier life and what I remembered. I think…” He closes his eyes, shakes his head just a fraction; when he opens them and looks at John again those lovely eyes are tired but clear and calm. “John, I think I’ve always known.”
John thinks of the terrible things both of them have done, the deaths, the deceptions, the lies they have told to keep the other safe.
With shaking fingers Sherlock opens the plastic bottle and pours a cold dollop into his hand. He hisses with pleasure as he wraps slick cool fingers around himself and pulls, closing his eyes against the onslaught of sensation. Showers of electric sparks cascade through his body, making him shiver.
“And it makes me feel, somehow, that when you look at me, all you see is what happened, or the question of what happened, the dark ugly shadow of it, and it blots out everything else until--until you can’t see
“Yes,” he says again, without any inflection whatsoever. “Agreed.” He ends the call abruptly, tossing the phone back onto the scratched laminate top of the bureau before turning and bending to pick up his bag on the floor next to the desk, unzipping the top to dig through the jumbled contents.
Sherlock looks up sharply at the question, before his gaze flicks to the window, where he can just see the hive boxes at the back of their garden. The sunlight makes his face seem soft and warm, and for a second he looks young again.
“I do.” His voice still a dark rumble. Lush, John thinks. “We were idiots, back then, wasted so much time”. His fingers slide over John’s lips.
“I’m going to have some tea. With your special honey. Do you want some, Sherlock?” He asks, too innocently, a sure tell for Sherlock, but he doesn’t care.
I’m going to plant potatoes! We have some non freeze-dried potatoes, because NASA thought it might be beneficial for our mental health if we cooked our own Thanksgiving meal.
If we want to get it there in time, we need to build a presupply in three months. That’s half the time it usually takes.
In this case, ‘successfully’ meant a bleeding lip and a scraped cheekbone for Sherlock and a twisted ankle for John. They were standing outside the police tape, waiting for Lestrade to give them permission to go home, and probably to summon them to his office in the morning. Which was in a few hours already, John noticed wearily.
It would be better if the crew stayed on the Hermes and only the pilot would go down, but they have another opinion about it, I’m afraid. You know how they are.
I’m not going into the details of Fertile Soil Project, but let’s just say it involves prying open the waste packages our space toilet spits out, adding water, and stirring it.
While he wondered if he could bribe Irene into auditioning with him when the medical student next to him at the bar caught his eye. He was wearing jeans and a fitted t-shirt that showed off his broad shoulders. Sherlock wondered why he was here alone. Maybe he was waiting for someone, a date; maybe he just wanted some stress relief. He could tell by the crease between his brows the stranger was worrying about something. Exams, perhaps. Or it could be his alcoholic sister, Sherlock mused, looking at the phone the man had just fished out of his pocket. No messages. Maybe his date had stood him up. Ah, the mundane things his peers got up to, Sherlock thought airily, while sipping from his bright green cocktail.
I’ve turned my little Hab potato farm into a hydrogen bomb - well, not a nuclear one, but still quite deadly.
Haven’t you got anything to interest Sherlock with? He’s been driving our team at Mission Control crazy, and they can’t afford to be distracted. He also kept trying to ask the Hermes crew weird questions and the last thing
That is to say, a small explosion happened. The good thing is: I’m not a crater and all the hydrogen is gone. So. Mission accomplished!
We can’t risk exposing John Watson’s dead body to the world. You know we can only hold on to the images for 24 hours, and after that we have to make them public. We simply can’t.
“Even aside from this...stunt, I did have fun last night.” John said, carefully avoiding to look at Sherlock’s eyes. He cleared his throat. “I mean…”
“Miss Hudson”, he greets her rather formally. Lilly’s smile is warm. They talk about her work in the city, and reminisce about her aunt. Or John does, anyway. Her boys are doing fine, although they can be a handful, Lilly tells them. Baby Emma is sweet as ever. She shows them pictures on her phone. John does his Doctor Watson routine, asking after her eating and sleeping habits. Sherlock is quiet. When she leaves, she promises to visit again soon, and to bring the kids.
Sherlock swallows down a spike of nerves and reflexive embarrassment -- this is always the hardest part, the part before he breaks down and lets go, the part where he feels awkward and self-conscious and ridiculous -- and steps out of the ensuite into the bedroom, naked as the day he was born.
I’m not exactly sure how to proceed, I’m still a bit dazed by the news, but I know we can’t keep this quiet for long and we need to formulate a plan.
So that is my current status. I’ll need to check up on the rest of the equipment and find a way to get the communication back, but for now I think I’ll go get some sleep.
for helping me with this chapter! And Risah also made the artwork for this chapter and it's so amazing, she's the best!
John opened his eyes, and they immediately locked onto Sherlock’s bright gaze. Suddenly John felt like he was back at their first case, watching Sherlock study the pill and feeling the jolt of panic before shooting the cabbie. He was back at Barts, the moment he realised Sherlock was going to jump. The moment Sherlock collapsed in his chair, grunting John’s name after offering to help Mary. Their goodbye at the airstrip before Sherlock would leave for his final mission. The things he didn’t say, but always meant to. All the things they both had never said. It was absolutely worth the risk.
Ballet was his life, of course, and had been since he began his classes, almost 20 years now. He didn’t mind the hard work it demanded of him, but nights like these were his way of dealing with the scrutiny of his day job. He wasn’t dancing in a show at the moment, which made his schedule a little easier. He still had to train all day, rehearsing for future shows, but for now his nights were free. And so he had some extra energy left to go out.
: Communication would be brilliant, the problem is that there are no supplies at the site. We’re not sure he can make the return trip when he gets there, it’s incredibly dangerous.
I’ll need more water for the crops, when I start planting. The water reclaimer works really well, but it won’t produce enough water for the plants. I’ll need to figure out a way to get more.
Sherlock opened his eyes and took a minute to figure himself out. The light filtering through the curtains told him it was around 9am. A decent night’s sleep, then, despite it being spent on the sofa instead of his bed. He carefully sat up, stretched and dragged a hand through his hair. He noticed the blanket covering him, and smiled at it. Thoughtful John. Despite the fact that sleep was largely a waste of time, he couldn’t deny he felt clearer and refreshed.
“We are done here, so ehm...make sure you come in for statements tomorrow, alright?” He sounded both embarrassed and amused, and John felt the blood rush all the way up to the tips of his ears. Sherlock wasn’t flustered at all. Calmly stepping away from John and turning his coat collar up, he smoothly swept passed Lestrade as if he wasn’t just about to shove his hand down John’s pants right next to a crime scene.
“Yes, I don’t see why not. I’m Sherlock, by the way,” he said, awkwardly holding out his hand. How did ordinary people do these type of things? It was pure agony.
I drove around with it a bit to see if it was secure enough and it didn’t budge. Also tested the rover with the second battery and did a system check: everything works the way it’s supposed to. Alright!
“I’m okay,” John replies, and he’s not, not at all, it’s the furthest thing possible from the truth, but he just doesn’t have the energy to deal with the reality of the situation right now.
The woman turns away from John and leaves, disappearing through an open door at the far end of the room.
“It’s not the police,” Sherlock says, his internal thought processes obviously running parallel to John’s own but at a much faster clip. “The sound’s all wrong. It’s only one vehicle, and it’s not a heavy police cruiser.”
He sees how badly frightened Sherlock is still. And how terrifyingly unbalanced and out of control that makes him feel.
This is the third boardwalk casino Sherlock and John have been in tonight, or maybe the fifth or maybe the ninth. There are no windows. There are no clocks. John knows it’s night outside, but beyond this broadest possible parameter, somehow Time itself ceases to exist in a place such as this.
John sighs and sits up. “I’m taking a shower, then,” he says, kissing Sherlock’s cheek. “Make him get us coffee.” He clambers to his feet, water bottle in hand, blanket wrapped around his naked body, and disappears without another word to Mycroft. The ensuite door slams, and Sherlock hears the sound of taps turning, the patter of water droplets hitting tile, John’s groan of pained content as he steps into the hot spray.
grin -- but it doesn’t quite take, the ever-present ball of anxiety heavy and greasy cold in the pit of his stomach, making it hard to smile, to breathe, or even to think.
“God, you’re so sensitive,” John murmurs, ever gracious in victory. “Gorgeous man. Tell me what you need.”
John knows Sherlock has a great deal on his mind, and is fully expecting him to wander off into the forest of his own thoughts, distant, remote, unreachable in mind even as his body remains in 221B.
John laughs. Sherlock’s serious demeanor softens a bit as he smiles slightly, holds up a hand. “No, really, that’s relevant. It tells me he’s vain, but cheap, which points to him being very susceptible to gifts and flattery.”
The commotion has drawn attention, and the steel door screeches open, two blurred shapes appear. “Chrissakes, Ell, what the fuck are you doing?” His would-be assailant is pulled away from him, howling threats and curses.
John investigates the tower of white clamshell boxes; of course, because Sherlock finds moderation in anything hopelessly dull, there is enough food for at least four ravenous people. In addition to the potato skins Sherlock’s already making quick work of, John discovers chicken wings, mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, and a carton of unfamiliar, irregular, lumpy fried bits alongside a container of what looks like salad cream, a substance that reminds John of depressing school lunch and he therefore regards with an outsized loathing.
