"Do I really need a reason?" John returned, bent down and breathed a kiss onto Sherlock's navel, causing Sherlock's still hard erection to press into John's neck. Sherlock let out that helpless, erotic whimper that nearly drove John mad every time.
John looked up, but his expression appeared to be anything other than reassuring. Still, she continued her approach. At least the other man had paused and not done anything to the door. Yet.
It should have been embarrassing to come like that, without friction, without any kind of touch, and yet it had been so very hot. John knelt over Sherlock’s sweaty, naked body and held his pulsing manhood in his hand. His semen mixed with Sherlock’s come and he looked up at John as if he’d never had a greater experience in his life.
Never before … never before had John caressed Sherlock's penis with his tongue. Never! And he might never do it again. Should he miss the chance to see it? And if he did look, would he be able to control himself and continue holding the ropes? Yet wouldn't it be worth it? On the other hand... the threat of a week of chastity still hung over him, and he wouldn't put it past John at all to enact appropriate measures to make sure the punishment was carried out.
Sherlock looked at him, his eyes round, wanted to tell him how much … how incredible … how overwhelming … how confused … how no other man had ever … but the tears, which he swallowed down for John's sake, closed off his throat, and for the first time in his life, he understood how it was possible to cry with happiness.
Sherlock swallowed hard, the happiness and warmth in his face giving way to a certain soberness. And all of a sudden he was exuding that surreal calm that still had the power to cast a spell over John.
Albright collapsed back into his chair. A red spot blossomed on his white shirt in the middle of his chest.
"Hm," Greg said vaguely before venturing on to the second question that simply wouldn't leave him alone. "You were just kidding, weren't you?"
"Your... accountant? He's actually your accountant?" Mycroft exclaimed in surprise. He'd lost any control over his composure for the moment.
He started playing through all his old music... one piece after another, as if in a trance. Endorphins rushed through his veins... he barely felt the pain in his shoulder, his wrists, the tips of his fingers. His body slowly lost any meaning, dissolved in light and colour and sound and harmony. He became virtually intoxicated on the effervescent tones he conjured forth, and didn't put the violin down until the vivid blue of the midday sky faded into a gentler, more muted afternoon cast.
"We had a meeting and... it just so happened that I ended up sitting next to her," Greg went on, grinning. "I flirted with her a bit."
Sherlock knew John was referring to his past as a homeless drug addict, but that wasn't something Sherlock cared much about becoming public knowledge. His real concern was that Mike might ask questions which would lead to him (and therefore John) finding out about the conservatorship; finding out that Sherlock was powerless to manage his own affairs. No, it would be simpler to let John believe Sherlock only cared about protecting his reputation.
Twenty minutes later, John's phone beeped. A text? Who would be sending him a text at this time of night?
Just like the act itself, the orgasm flowed as thick and delicious as honey out of John's body. His ejaculate pulsed into Sherlock's hole in a lazy stream, and it took what seemed like half an eternity before John had the feeling he was completely empty. He cleared his throat, patted Sherlock on the arse, pushed him off his lap, and got up.
"As I understand it, you should moisten the head of the cigar just a little bit before you cut it..." John whispered throatily to him. "I think... you're wet enough to manage that..."
"Nothing..." John finally said, hating himself for it. "Wake me up if your arse hurts too much. I can put some more cream on it."
“Finally,” John sighed in amusement. “I was afraid you weren't interested after all.” And with those words, he kissed Sherlock's penis again before sinking down on it with his mouth.
That was the reason for them taking a different route than they'd followed on the way there, one which led them past several shops. The usual tourist shops, clothing boutiques, watchmakers, bookshops, small supermarkets and even a florist's stood in a colourful row, offering a distraction to the weary eye. But when their path took them past an antiques dealer, John slowed his steps.
Greg bit down on his lip and made a muffled sound. Half moan, half whimper. Mycroft was quite pleased.
Then... a gathering of self that was virtually audible, the wasp-like hum of the crop, the turbulence of the air, the slapping sound of the hit.
Scepticism coloured Mycroft's bewilderment, along with something like fascination. An expression that was so familiar to John from his interactions with Sherlock that it touched him in an odd way. It was rather discomfiting to recognise that look on the mayor's face.
"Biting is only for barbarians," Sherlock said disparagingly. "Cigar punchers are especially recommended for Havanas with flat ends, a hole three-quarters the diameter of the cigar is optimal. The advantage of this method: the wrapper remains undamaged and no tobacco particles get into your mouth when you take a puff. The disadvantage is that fatty acids and tobacco juice gather quickly in the little opening, which may have a detrimental effect on the taste of the cigar," Sherlock recited his encyclopaedic knowledge in a quick, staccato rhythm. "Even the best guillotine cutters can damage the wrapper leaf – but it improves the cigar's draw. The opening created by the cut should comprise two-thirds of the cigar's diameter. A slightly larger cut makes it easier to draw on, while a smaller one will make it more difficult." Sherlock took a breath to come to his conclusion. "I would recommend a straight cut in this case. As to the cut... it depends on individual preferences – one person may prefer it slightly larger, while the next person may prefer it smaller."
John's lowered voice... the faint scent of gun oil and metal that always surrounded him, emanating an aura of danger... the tantalising words... it all made Sherlock's knees go weak and his penis become hard.
"Oh... I don't see it that way … after all, he exposed a few things that I went to a great deal of effort to set up," Moriarty contradicted him easily. "But... I don't want to be unreasonable. If you shoot yourself right here, right now, I'll let him go."
"Shhh..." was all John said, and then Sherlock felt two hands on his buttocks, pulling his cheeks apart.
"I was just working on the Italian correspondence and there were a few things that came up. But that can wait until tomorrow. Good night, Mr Watson."
When would it all become too much for Sherlock? What would he do then? Disobey and wank? Or whinge? Maybe beg, for once? John didn't know. He never knew. Sherlock was refreshingly unpredictable in that way.
Sherlock's eyes filled abruptly with tears. His lids fell shut, and the tears flowed freely down his cheeks. He bit down on his lips and cried silently.
And since I started posting the English version... every Monday he's asking at least twice a day: 'Are there any new comments?'
Sherlock shuffled around a bit on his knees until he'd distributed his weight properly, then spread his thighs in invitation. His erection couldn't really be seen from the back, as stiffly as it was sticking up between his legs. John took in the sight before him... if he should ever be in a situation where he needed wanking material... this was it. This image alone would keep him satisfied for months. Then he stood up, quickly taking off his clothes, and knelt behind Sherlock on the floor. It was hard. Pillows? No. Sherlock didn't have one this time either. It was going to be a fast one anyway. As worked up as he was, it wasn't going to take long at all, and he could take all the time he needed afterwards to take care of Sherlock... somewhere more comfortable.
John had pulled up and zipped his trousers by now, and was in the middle of pulling his polo neck top over his head.
Mycroft watched him, both angry and a little hurt. "If you want to leave, I will of course accept your decision. But you should know that if you do so, that door will remain closed to you in future."
Sherlock nodded obediently, went over to John and lowered himself onto his lap, managing to cuddle up against him like a kitten despite his height.
John shook his head lazily. "No," was all he said. "We both know cigar smoke is more alkaline than from a cigarette. That means the nicotine in the smoke can be absorbed much more easily by the mucous membranes in the mouth. A small dose is more than enough for you."
"Sherlock, that's insane... how can you still want to stay with me... after everything... after everything I..."
It was a week before Christmas. John had picked Sherlock up from the clinic, and now Sherlock stood rooted to the spot in the entry hall of their house, staring in horror at the oversized silver-and-pale-blue Christmas tree which put even the presumptuous chandelier above it to shame.
in advance … and I hadn't been gagged the other day and could have used it … would it have made any difference? Would I have got through to you? Would you have reacted to it at all?”
Once again, he took his penis in his hand and knelt between Sherlock's legs. He positioned the tip of his erection directly against Sherlock's gently twitching opening, exerting a slight pressure. Through the thin layer of latex, he could feel the promising pulsing at the top of his glans, and above the sound of his own blood rushing in his ears, he heard Sherlock panting for air. Then the body before him held itself completely still, the only sound in the room that of Sherlock's heavy breathing.
"Oh, really?" John spat out sarcastically. "And what else would it be then? What am I in it for – in your vaunted opinion?"
John would have liked to laugh. The tosser was priceless. What fire! What a temper! But if he let himself go now, all the effort he'd put in so far would be for nothing. Sherlock still needed to
John pointed at the ring. "This goes under your glans. And this..." He moved the hook with the ball carefully up and down, ending by pointing directly at the ball. "... gets inserted into your urethra."
A knowing smile sat on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth but he kept it in check. “Should I have done anything… risky… on one or two occasions in the past, it only happened because I knew that I could rely on you… that you would keep anything truly disastrous from happening to us,” Sherlock shot back.
While the butler prepared the cups with milk and sugar according to each man's preference, Sherlock suddenly spoke to him in French.
"If you think I didn't notice you were passive smoking the whole time, you're grossly mistaken. As if I were idiotic enough not to see what you did with Henry Baskerville that time! Did you really think I wouldn't notice? And now, ever since you gave me your word -- YOUR WORD, SHERLOCK! -- that you were giving up smoking, you've inhaled second-hand smoke every chance you've had! Every - single - chance... it's the same game as last time." John took a deep breath. "And you only solved this case just now because you virtually forced the suspect to smoke! It was nothing but sheer, unearned luck, Sherlock!"
The first time Mycroft had stuck his nose in Sherlock's business was bad enough, but that was nothing compared to the second and third times...
'but it might be too late. You go on ahead, Mycroft. Go to your father. You're already in the area. I want someone from the family to be there.'
"Of course it would be," John broke in. "But... that doesn't really help us... We don't know who's behind it, and we don't have any way to figure it out at the moment. Sooner or later, whoever it is will give themselves away... until then... I'll get things under control one way or another."
Irene had come to the end of her rope. “All right,” she huffed. “You're bored? Fine. Then you can do the bloody books for me. My tax advisor needs everything by the end of the week.” She got up, walked around her desk, and went toward the door.
"Oh God," Sherlock whispered, but immediately resumed rubbing the head of his penis, concentrating the almost frantic motions exclusively on the tiny opening. His hips started to jerk in an unambiguous manner, and John once again took hold of his fingers and pulled them away.
"Oh no, nothing as obvious as that," Lestrade demurred with a grim smile. "Doc's done that trick already. Invited the niece of a Bolivian police chief to a party and didn't let her leave until... certain contacts in Bolivia had been arranged and certain agreements were in place."
"Great!" the first man exclaimed, rubbing his hands. "I have a couple of fellows who are just itching to be let off their leads."
, he would never have been able to muster the necessary calm and focus to complete his work on the accounts.
“It's one of the mysteries of the universe,” Sherlock replied dryly. “Oh yes – a tip for the future: passing out when I'm still tied up … not a good idea.”
"Why don't you try a professional again?" Mike said in a deliberately casual tone. But one dark look from John had him backpedalling. "I mean, at least those blokes know what they're doing. Maximum fun, minimum trouble." When Mike saw that John continued to look sceptical, he added, "At least for a little while – until something else comes along to keep your bed warm on a more long-term basis. At least consider it, Johnny. And while you're at it, think about us. You're not exactly easy to get along with when you're like this. So get back in there and treat yourself to something special tonight."
The text was printed in golden letters on the invitation that had procured John entry to Mr Henford's villa that evening. He usually stayed away from events like this, but the mayoral elections had taken place that day, and Mr Henford had been clever enough to hold his daughter's engagement party that very evening in order to ensure the mob would show up.
paying attention," Sherlock remarked snidely. "Yes, again! Didn't you ever wonder where I was the whole time... all those years... when you were looking for me and couldn't find me? I'll tell you where I was: right under you rather overlarge nose. Smack in the heart of London. On the streets... in back alleys... under bridges. In other words: in the gutter," Sherlock concluded with grim satisfaction.
John ignored the warming tray with the scrambled eggs in favour of a slice of toast, which he smeared with jam. As an accompaniment, he poured himself a cup of tea. Only once he'd completed that task did it occur to him: "If you'd prefer coffee with breakfast..."
"Why not?" Sherlock replied with a shrug. "It's the only explanation I can think of why Mycroft should show someone else his highly personal, highly secret mobile phone... and he must have done so, as there's no other way the Inspector could have come across the picture of Moran. He must have seen it accidentally, since Mycroft would have had no reason to show it to him."
The sight of Sherlock shamelessly giving in to his own lust was too heady for John to end it with a command. Rather than giving Sherlock a new order, he simply enjoyed the scene as it played out.
No more guilty conscience toward Irene, who had been paying his way for old times' sake (John had been – judging by the expression on her face – more than generous) ... no other clients anymore ... no more boredom ... just John...
"Yes, it was very good. Thank Mrs Turner for me," John answered. "You can leave everything for the moment, though. Sherlock's not finished eating."
"If you're very good, you can lick it up later," John explained, satisfied with Sherlock's reaction, and stood up. He lifted the cigar and applied the cutter to it. "Two-thirds..." he repeated softly and carried out the cut with surgical precision. "The wrapper didn't even get a scratch," he said after a brief once-over, holding the cigar under Sherlock's nose for a more thorough inspection.
"On- on the desk?" Mycroft stammered, taken aback, only to get annoyed at himself for having let his surprise show.
Sherlock licked and swallowed, wanting to savour it as long as possible, but even as he was climaxing, John withdrew from the willing mouth and deposited the last dregs on Sherlock's lips and chin. Sherlock tried to catch as much as he could with his tongue, but John stopped him.
He found himself in a small room, the brick walls of which he might just barely have been able to touch if he'd stretched out both arms. There was an open passageway in the wall in front of him, where a petroleum lamp stood. John identified it as the light source whose dull glow had shone up the entry shaft to the outside. Here, it additionally illuminated the staircase that opened off the other side of the passageway, leading steeply even further downwards.
A young man in a demure yet dapper dark suit suddenly appeared out of nowhere before them to take John's coat, which he had slung over his arm due to the mild temperatures. The coat was then stowed in a closet next to the main door. The entire manoeuvre was done in silence, causing Sherlock to deduce that John had instructed his staff well and was no friend of unnecessary chatter.
Sherlock moaned wantonly and rushed to kneel on the floor again and take John's cock into his mouth. He worked carefully, and John was secretly grateful to him for it. He couldn't have withstood any more stimulation. His desire and arousal ran through his body in surging waves. Greater and greater... higher and higher... building up... and now John was right on the edge, about to break apart on the cliffs of ecstasy. And when he did that, he wanted to be one with Sherlock... really, truly one with that warm, willing body...
“He’d never wear something as poncy as ...” John protested. But then his gaze cleared and he spoke, more to himself than to Mike: “But ... I could... I could order a metal butt plug from my jeweller... have it gold-plated and engrave my monogram in the handle... I could use Sherlock’s favourite plug as a model...” He seemed to find the idea more and more appealing.
An oily grin spread across John's face. "With pleasure," he answered sweetly and started to hammer into Sherlock at a breakneck pace.
John rolled his eyes to himself. What did Mike know about the joys of anal sex anyway … or about the lonely nights in the big house?
"Relax," John told him, gently but firmly. "Don't forget to breathe... it will be easier if you press back against my finger a bit."
John's question about Mycroft's reasons brought Sherlock's mistrust toward his brother back to the fringes of his consciousness, but he was too tired and too happy to worry about it at the moment. There would be enough time later to puzzle over it.
was hiring them, and the fact that we know where their families live. Each of them has at least two kids. They'll take the threat seriously and do a proper job."
, he corrected himself. Damn it. But he couldn't admit that in front of Albright. No way. As a mob boss, he couldn't just hire people and promote them without knowing who they were. Which is exactly what he'd done.
Moran's brow creased and his eyes narrowed. He apparently didn't know what to make of John's remark.
"You can be a right drama queen, you know that?" Mike retorted. "Relax! It'll be fine. After all, I took care of it personally."
Sherlock thought about the measures John had taken in order not to hurt him more than necessary, not to deal him any real damage. He hadn't struck out in a blind fury, but had acted with deliberation. Sherlock shook his head as if driving away an annoying insect. He'd have to go over it all later. Later … when his head wasn't topsy-turvy and the buzzing burn in his face wasn't causing emotions and desires he didn't care to think about - now that the immediate danger was past. It was all complicated enough, with one question looming over everything else: was John actually
Sherlock's eyes widened, and he leaned into John even further. "It's beautiful," he breathed out, seized by emotion, and - to his great consternation - felt tears welling up. He struggled to swallow them back down, but his eyes remained moist. It truly was beautiful. Almost too beautiful to be real.
Sherlock obediently took it and drank half of it with greedy gulps. Then he sighed softly and kissed John on the mouth. It was a chaste kiss, their lips closed, yet John immersed himself in that kiss more than any of the previous ones. After massaging Sherlock's shoulders, arms, and wrists, he tied his wrists together behind his back. It was only a light restraint, but it fulfilled its purpose.
John already regretted the words the moment they were spoken, so it didn't take all too much effort to apologise.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek. "Fine. Let's pretend for a moment that I believe you. What explanation can you offer, then, for the fact that the cocaine is not in your warehouse, yet there's no matching entry for the value amongst the incoming payments? Well? I'm listening."
"Not this time," John said cheerfully, kissing him lightly on the forehead. "Now that I think about it... I think I'll put you over my knee either way."
Another shudder wracked Sherlock's body, and the muscles of his tight, hot arse squeezed together firmly around John's impatient erection. John bit down on his lips, sighing softly as the urge to empty himself right then and there into that willing body lessened a bit due to the pain in his mouth. Then he licked his lips greedily and, to the tune of Sherlock's keen, ecstatic cries, he pulled out completely from the insistent embrace. He admired the gaping hole for several seconds before he hammered home without warning, burying his cock's full length in Sherlock's body in a single stroke.
those wankers were going to try and screw me over!! Ever since Graves got in with them, something's been off!"
"And I thought a bloke got asked first," Greg protested, threw his half-smoked cigarette on the ground and crushed it under his heel.
After fifty blows, the beleaguered skin was glowing with palpable warmth, as was John's hand. Although he preferred direct contact like this for spankings, he thought he might have to revert to some kind of implement if he ever had to punish his playmate in earnest, in order to spare his hands. Sherlock was breathing heavily, and John's respiration had also increased during the course of the procedure.
It was true, ever since John had caught him wearing the plug and come all over his face, he hadn't let Sherlock's mouth anywhere near his cock.
"Until tonight," John said in a low voice, tugging a little on a lock of hair behind Sherlock's ear. "Don't get into any mischief, and be good."
The gold shimmered gently against the pale skin, and John's fingers ran over the engraving there with something akin to reverence - as well as a certain pride of ownership.
Mike listened to the ring tone. It wasn't one of the pre-programmed, personalised ring tones that Mike used to identify callers, so it couldn't be very urgent.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. He already had more than enough suits, and nowadays he hated being touched by strange men... by any man who wasn't John, in fact.
John widened his eyes in astonished disbelief. "You can't have known about that! You can't prove it!" But then an unpleasant thought occurred to him. "Unless..."
"It's a … surprise," John's voice cut through the lusty billows of Sherlock's thoughts - highly inappropriate for a cemetery, as sinful as they were.
John watched him sceptically, but didn't say anything. "How magnanimous of you," he teased, and then Sherlock lowered himself onto the cushions - as lithesome and graceful as ever - nestled up against John's legs, and closed his eyes with a beatific expression.
"The fact that you've called leads me to conclude that your sojourn beneath John Watson's roof is at an end and you are now deigning to submit yourself to my custody once again," Mycroft explained his line of thinking, only managing to hold back an
"No!" Sherlock mobilised his last reserves of strength for the protest. "No... you do it. Let me come, John... Make me..."
"No," John smashed his hopes with a gleeful grin, and Sherlock would likely have burst into tears if everything hadn't been so startlingly erotic and utterly fantastic.
"Mary, I said I didn't wish to be dist..." He fell silent when he saw that the intruder wasn't his secretary. "Inspector Lestrade."
Sherlock didn't know how long he withstood the erotic torture this time before his arousal again became too great for him to control on his own.
"I memorised it," Sherlock responded promptly. "And even if I hadn't remembered it exactly, I could have found it somewhere in John's papers."
Sherlock pressed his lips together. Oh no. Disappointed John. Disappointed John was the worst of all. He couldn't bear that one. Fortunately, John was not yet aware that he was in possession of that particular secret weapon. But it wouldn't take long. As clever as John had become recently... once again Sherlock thought that he really should be proud of him...
John took a tube of lubricant out of one of the desk drawers (it was a good thing they had deposited the necessary supplies all over the house) and smeared some on the first two fingers of his left hand.
on John. He'd see through them right away for what they are - a mask. And even if he didn't, it would be abhorrent to me to lie to him," Sherlock remarked matter-of-factly. "And now will that be all?"
A fiendish grin appeared on John's lips. "Because that favour spells the difference between a clean shot between the eyes or a jigsaw puzzle for the pathologist."
"Fairy tales? In German and Italian?" Astonishment and enthusiasm coloured Sherlock's voice as he took down both volumes from the shelf and paged through them.
Sherlock's tongue kept moving across the tiny, narrow slit in the tip of John's penis, out of which the precious, clear drops oozed in increasingly smaller intervals. Becoming greedy after a while, he finally tried invading the little opening with the tip of his tongue.
"Slave driver..." John murmured to himself, but went obediently to his office. When he reached out to open the door, however, he discovered that it was already unlocked. "What the..." he swore softly, putting his hand on his gun, ready to draw it. Only then did he push the door open.
Sherlock stood up, his expression stony, and left the room, hurrying down the stairs to the kitchen. His sudden appearance startled Mrs Turner and Eleanor, who were the only ones there.
Sherlock was too exhausted and worked up to argue or pose a question, so he simply did what John wanted. He directed his lethargic gaze forward and saw... himself.
His abused hole twitched, fought back, cramped up from the pain, yet still greedily took the intruder in. The perspiration sizzled on his skin, smarted in the welts on his arse, and Sherlock held his breath in bliss. Only to gasp for air again when John's penis - finally, finally! - stimulated his prostate. All but deaf and blind with arousal, Sherlock abandoned himself completely to John's deep, hard thrusts and cool hands. John's hands, which roved ceaselessly and with exquisite tenderness over his chest. A tenderness that was in stark contrast to the almost brutal rhythm with which he pounded into Sherlock.
Although he had scarcely any direct stimulation throughout this period, the erection between his legs barely weakened at all, thanks to the cock ring. Every sinful thought only caused his body to pump more blood into his groin and swell his cock further... it was virtually impossible for it to deflate completely as the fantastic, accursed metal ring prevented the blood from draining all the way... an orgasm wasn't out of the question despite the hindrance – but it would be difficult. He'd never achieve climax without direct contact... and even then... there was no guarantee of success.
Sherlock couldn’t - didn’t want to - believe that both John AND his bodyguards would have been so naive... to underestimate a danger of that magnitude and not be able to react in an appropriate and timely manner.
"Whatever makes you think your conditions might interest me?" he asked acidly. "Besides: Sherlock isn't my
Even though Sherlock clearly had a masochistic bent, John was still mildly surprised at his reaction, especially after everything he'd done to the young man. He'd expected to be confronted with objections, reckoned that Sherlock would try to bargain, but apparently none of that was going to happen. Sherlock submitted to his will and gave him his body with such a complete lack of reservation that it touched a spot deep inside John, a spot whose existence he hadn't felt in years. But now wasn't the time to get lost in introspection.
"Yeah, I'm sorry - Jacques refuses to give up any of his almond biscuits. He's even gone so far as to lock them up in a cupboard..." Thomas replied with an apologetic gesture. "He bakes them himself, you know? Not even Mrs Turner's allowed to see the recipe. Usually, everyone gets a biscuit with his coffee or tea … only with you..." Thomas realised a second too late what he was saying and cleared his throat sheepishly. "Would you like anything else?" he asked instead, adjusted the plate once more on the table, and straightened up to give Sherlock a questioning look.
"But I may have to haul out the heavy artillery in your case... I still have a set of sounds somewhere..." A lust-filled throbbing arose in John's groin, and his penis started to expand. God - it had been a long time since he'd used that set. There were simply too few men who found the practice titillating. "Metal rods, intended for medical use … with a slight bend in them … in several sizes..." John continued, his voice raw. "Perfect for inserting into the urethra … Maybe it would teach you not to dribble all over everything. How would you like that?"
it at all costs. And anything offered as an alternative - rubbing one out on the back of the couch or a couple of fingers up his arse - paled in comparison to his overwhelming desire for a thorough stimulation of his prostate.
Mycroft stared after him, dumbfounded, until he lost sight first of Greg's figure and then his grey hair in the crowd.
Hastily, he opened his flies, shoved his underwear down over his hips, and took his rigid erection, wet with his lustful appetites, in hand. He had to bite his lips in order to suppress a whimper of relief. God – if the gentle pressure of his own fingers felt this good, how indescribable was it going to be once he was inside Sherlock?
John gaped at him, his mouth hanging open, and tried to comprehend the monstrous possibility that he might be spied on in his own house, by one of his own employees.
John used his own hand to steady himself over Sherlock’s body, his other hand hastily pushed down his underpants. He grabbed his aching erection and before he could do much else than just holding his cock in his hand, his orgasm burst out of him. Just like that.
John was still rubbing the end of the third sound over his opening, rubbing and rubbing, leaving Sherlock empty and wanting. The emptiness was horrible. Sherlock wanted to beg, but the words got stuck in his throat. Finally... renewed pressure against his hole... the stretch... unbearable... wonderful... then the sound slid inside part way, burning like fire, filling the emptiness... but not completely... Sherlock needed more... wanted to feel it... deeper... the sweet pain of the stretch... the agonising tightness.
"Ooooh yeaaah..." Greg whispered, drawing the words out. "Perfect. Just perfect. I can hardly wait to feel you inside me."
"With due respect to your political correctness..." Sherlock interjected, rolling his eyes, "...it's completely lost on me. You should know that by now. Do I really need to give you a reason first?" He shook his head in disapproval. "Good God, John - sometimes you're really terribly difficult. Hit me. Just hit me. You know it's not a punishment for me. Especially not with that." He indicated the paddle in John's hand. "Don't worry. We both know you'll feel better for it afterwards. And so will I. You want to. I can read it in your eyes. Or do you really need to justify the act? Really, John?" Sherlock's left eyebrow rose in challenge.
John squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger, making a concerted effort to maintain his composure. Then he opened his eyes again, focused on Sherlock, and pointed straight at him. Sherlock's bottom lip was still trembling, and he'd turned pale. He wasn't even able to look at John anymore. He turned his head to the side and moved the laptop away.
"That doesn't..." John echoed and looked away for a moment. "Sherlock... how often do I have to tell you that you shouldn't always forgive me everything, and especially not so quickly!"
Moran gave the knife an appraising look before his eyes wandered back to the bodyguards, who were silently and watchfully following the proceedings. Then he barked out a short, dry laugh. "So you want to know whether I was acting on my own or whether there was anyone else?"
Irene rubbed her temples with her fingers. “If I ignore you, what are the chances that you'll disappear again and stop bothering me?”
He raised his hand decisively and brought it down with a loud slap on the bottom that was being offered in such a tantalising manner. Sherlock cried out, short and sharp, more in surprise than pain, and jerked his hips forward in a delayed attempt at an evasive manoeuvre.
By the time a few days had passed after John surprised Sherlock in his office, Mike had become used to Sherlock's presence. The kid really had a good head on his shoulders, and working with him was surprisingly pleasant. Like John, he didn't put much stock in flowery speeches when it came to business, and his assistance proved to be more than valuable. They agreed that Sherlock would go through and check over the invoices from every division and region, while Mike and John took care of the day-to-day business.
"I'm going to cover your eyes now," he announced, and Sherlock gave his consent with a faint nod of his head.
But now none of that passion was in evidence. Greg's eyes had lost any trace of warmth, instead peering remorselessly at their target.
Sherlock's creased brow promptly smoothed out and John was able to breathe a little easier. Good - he hadn't run screaming from the room. That was something at least...
He was going to live with John under the same roof! John wanted him so much he was taking him home with him!
' but he didn't. In fact, he hardly dared to breathe, waiting as if paralysed for Sherlock to show some reaction.
He knew that sexual favours shouldn't be equated with esteem and respect. But John had the sneaking suspicion that Sherlock had only ever given and never received, and that he'd apparently accepted that as the way of the world. John automatically tried to recall all the times he'd been with Sherlock over the past few months. Had he always just taken from Sherlock and never given him anything? How had he acted? Had he - without being aware of it and completely unintentionally - affirmed Sherlock's view of the world? John swallowed hard. He wasn't sure. He probably had. But there had also been moments when he'd seen astonishment, awe, and wonder in Sherlock's face when he'd looked at him. Were those the times when John had acted differently that Sherlock was used to? Were those the times when John had unwittingly done the right thing? Were those the times that
John shrugged his shoulders in resignation. He might as well open his house and play the affable host to these ignoramuses who couldn't tell a cognac from a brandy.
Mycroft shrugged his shoulders. "Let us just say I would appreciate it if there were no further killings of police officers nor - as far as possible - of innocent citizens."
"No, not..." Mike began, just as his mobile rang. "Ah - right on cue. We'll know more in a moment." He accepted the call and said, "Any news, Rosebank?"
John took the paddle a little numbly. Out of habit, he hefted it in his hand, felt how nicely the weight was balanced between the flat end of the paddle and the handle.
A broken sob, a hoarse cry, and Sherlock's whole body shuddered and spasmed. His eyes flared wide and his cock swelled even more - then finally the first milky spurts erupted from the tip, landing high on Sherlock’s collarbone, hitting him across the chest. Sherlock gave an ecstatic cry as another and another spurt fell across his chest, painting his stomach and groin, before the tide ceased and the remaining dribbles ran down his cock and into his pubic hair.
"Maybe not anymore," John remarked acidly, and all the colour drained from Sherlock's face. Even his lips turned pale, but he didn't say anything. John thought the matter was settled, and turned away from Sherlock. Afterwards, he realised that was his mistake, as the attack came without any forewarning whatsoever.
"Yeah, you thought you were pretty clever," John replied with a smirk. "But... once in a while I look over the footage from the security cameras myself. You didn't think of that. I saw you in the garden and in your window."
For a few frightening moments John thought he went too far, but then Sherlock's legs started to tremble and his cock started to pulse in John's hand.
"As I said ... you were surprisingly pricey. I wanted to get my money's worth..." John paused in the middle of his sentence. His subconscious had noticed something about what Sherlock had said. His eyes narrowed.
Once they were both in the office and had locked the door behind them as a precaution, John sat down on the chair behind his desk. Sherlock watched him, both wary and curious, his desire clear.
"John's scared," Sherlock said. It didn't sound nearly as cocky as his first call. All of a sudden, his voice had a despondent cast to it.
"We'd be a lot faster if you'd finally get rid of that stupid crutch," John couldn't help remarking. Sherlock's limp bothered him, as well as a constant, needling reminder.
Sherlock looked up at him incredulously. "Just be myself?" he asked, perplexed. "That's never ended well for me."
His arms were stretched out and tied to the head of the bed with a rope. Several pillows underneath him raised his hips up far enough that John wouldn't have any trouble entering him from a standing position later, thanks to the height of the old-fashioned bedframe. Padded leather cuffs encased Sherlock's ankles, spreading his legs and pulling them up, where they were likewise bound with ropes to the lower bedposts.
"My goodness, that's strong," she murmured in an undertone as Jacques left the room with a faint snort.
Sherlock, lying on his side, felt John's come dripping out of his body, and turned back onto his stomach so he could stare at John in disbelief.
"He wasn't exactly opposed," Moriarty conceded. "He calculated he had … better chances with me. But I see... there must have been clues... you wouldn't have been able to list everything so quickly otherwise."
For a fraction of a second, Sherlock's mind existed in a state of perfect peace and stillness. But then he heard himself rasp, "John,
He hated to do it, but if there were anyone who could inconspicuously procure a photograph of Moran without John finding out about it, then it was his accursed brother.
John didn't make any comment on it, other than giving Sherlock a long, smug look before making himself comfortable in his armchair once more.
Mike had followed the exchange with his mouth hanging open. His French was just good enough to order in a restaurant and ask for the cheque, so he hadn't understood everything Sherlock and Jacques had said, but it all became clear a few moments later when Jacques returned, placed an elegant glass dish with several almond biscuits in front of Mike, and then disappeared with a nod and one last worshipful glance in Sherlock's direction.
He'd barely begun to rub himself against the seat with small, circular motions of his hips, when the fingers in his arse started to twist and fuck him with short, deep strokes. And all of a sudden, everything was good again.
The Grand Hall of the Battersea Arts Centre was sumptuously decorated, and terribly hot. Greg ran his finger around the inside of his too-tight collar for the umpteenth time in order to loosen it a bit. No use. Maybe he could take off his jacket a little later - after enough alcohol had flowed and the guests were a bit more relaxed - without earning cross looks from one of his superiors.
"Nice try. But you're not that young. How old are you really?" He himself was thinking mid-twenties, maybe even older.
There was no other logical conclusion. John must have been betrayed more than once in the past, and it must have hit him hard every time, as he was a possessive man and
Wouldn't be as easy to take out as this was." Moriarty pulled something out of the pocket of his coat with his free hand and tossed it at John. Sherlock's golden butt plug somersaulted through the air, glowing dully in the light of the petroleum lamps, only to sink into the murky brown water right in front of John's feet with a sickening plop.
"Yes, it will be," Greg answered, unconcerned. "Since I've been sticking a dildo up my arse every night for months now, which turns out to be just about the same size as you..."
John shot him an incredulous look and blinked several times. "Maybe because vaseline and condoms don't mix well?" he stated with disbelieving ridicule.
"You're not going to go making a big deal out of it now, are you?" Sherlock interrupted him with mild surprise. "Entirely unnecessary."
"I know exactly what you need," John told him with a smug smile. "But you're going to have to earn it."
He'd barely completed the thought before John's movements became more frantic and less controlled, and with a rattle from deep in his throat he froze, groaned, thrust once more - slow and deep, jerked again, and then finally fell still. With a sigh that spoke of both relief and contentment, John pulled carefully out of him, removing his fingers from Sherlock's mouth at the same time.
"Just do what I do. Don't think about it," he said, watching the smoke that rose from his mouth float into the damp evening air, only to dissipate with gentle swirls in the mist.
"Not by a long shot," John answered with a lascivious grin. "I'll be right back," he said and stood up.
For Sherlock, it was a revelation. A bonfire of ecstasy. He threw his eyes open, stared up at the ceiling, unseeing, and let out a throaty cry to accompany the rod's journey to the centre of his erection... deeper and deeper... when he couldn't feel any more movement, Sherlock sobbed.
"Fine... how about tomorrow afternoon?" she suggested. "Lord Windermere is interested in something more... you and Jason – is that all right with you?"
"I'm just trying to make you more comfortable," John replied gently, placing one arm around Sherlock's shoulders and the other under his knees and lifting him from the table to carry him over to the small, cosy couch, where he set him down carefully on the soft cushions.
"No," John decided with a heavy heart. "That would stick out too much too. And I don't know whether the bastard has some tracker installed in his phone either. Could be fatal."
Sherlock's chest rose and fell markedly, a light flush spread from his unearthly cheekbones down across his neck all the way to his shoulders. His mouth hung open, as if he were truly breathless with arousal. John had to give him kudos for the superb acting job, until he noticed the clear distension of his trousers. He raised an eyebrow. Perhaps it wasn't an act after all? Could his arousal be real?
"He went home. To his wife. For dinner," Sherlock answered, somewhat disconnected. He was too confused to form more eloquent sentences. "What are you going to do with me?"
"JOHN WATSON!" Susan shrieked at such a high volume and with such fury that John startled and held the phone away from his ear.
"A friend of Sherlock and John's," Mike completed her sentence with a slight bow, holding his hand out.
Even if he didn't intend to allow Sherlock into his bed all the time, there would still be the sound of another person breathing in the dark somewhere.
"Of course I mean it... you're not someone I tend to lie to," John said, flicking his fingers – as if in passing - against the nipple clamp still attached to Sherlock's left breast.
something without really knowing it... having to rely on assumptions without any certainty. Will you now satisfy my curiosity and my ...
John would have gladly given his guest a fast one to the jaw. Gladly. Where did this person get off talking about Sherlock like that? Where did he get off forming a negative opinion of him, John Watson, based solely on his poor opinion of Sherlock? John deliberately moved his hands to the armrests of his chair.
"But- but..." Glendale whimpered as Dave and Naresh went over to him and frogmarched him roughly out of the room.
With practised fingers, John grasped the butt plug, ripped it with something bordering on violence out of Sherlock's body, and hurled it away with a grimace of utter revulsion.
might have been - he wasn't sure himself... hadn't even allowed himself to think about it more deeply. But John's remark had destroyed even that hope - that tiny, little hope. Sherlock told himself it was fine, that it could have been worse and that it didn't matter … but he was just lying to himself.
When he realised who the person was standing in the doorway and wearing an expensive suit with a black polo neck top, he didn't believe his eyes.
"Yeah," John confessed with a lopsided smile. "Yes, it's true. I'm afraid you've ruined me for anyone else, once and for all. Are you happy now? Is that what you wanted?"
"Your lap dog is behaving atrociously. Maybe castrating it would calm it down. As luck would have it, I have an expert right here on hand. She's simply mad about knives, handles them with astounding flair. If you want him back safe and sound - and in one piece... then you'd better hurry and come to our meeting alone." The call cut off and the line went dead.
"Our... needs... complement each other extremely well. And that's all you're going to hear from me on the topic," Sherlock answered firmly.
"Keep going... now take three fingers..." John rasped out his new instructions to Sherlock. "I'm just making sure you think of me as often tomorrow as you did today."
"All right, all right," Jacques interrupted the cook, who then gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder. "I know."
"If there had been any point, I would undoubtedly have done so," Sherlock declared. "This way, however... I've just soiled your desk. I do hope that letter wasn't very important," he concluded with fake regret.
"You don't say," Sherlock remarked dryly. "I was under the impression that was precisely the reason you bought me."
"One of us," Kenneth admitted, his eyes burning and his cheeks pale. "Me." He swallowed. "But it wasn't me," he said softly. "Someone's trying to set me up. Someone wants me to take the fall!"
John looked up in surprise before letting out a short laugh. "Nothing medical," he explained cryptically and walked out, leaving a visibly confused butler behind.
"...then you're both out to lunch," Mike ended his statement, unimpressed, and left the room in a deliberately casual manner, as if he were on the way to the toilet and not to play
"John, you're making a mountain out of a molehill again," Sherlock placated him absently without taking his eyes off the row of stones. "No one knows we're related, and Mycroft won't be the mayor forever... Your problem will solve itself eventually."
John's gasps were music to Sherlock's ears. John's voice in his head... his mouth filled with John's stiff penis... John's smell in his nose... the taste of John's arousal on his tongue...
Sherlock, on the other hand... He seemed to be enchanted by the scar and everything connected to it. What a welcome change of pace!
"Me?! Nothing!" John yelled into the phone. "If you hadn't put this bee in my bonnet I wouldn't be sitting here!"
John didn't even consider the fact that his entire train of thought was based on the assumption that Sherlock's arms would always be open for him as long as he wanted them to be. He never considered that Sherlock would ever reject him … he took it for granted that – as long as John paid him – he would never do that. For John, it was more a question of when he would get sick of Sherlock. At the moment, it didn't seem possible, but John knew from painful experience that no one would ever be able to tie him down forever. Sherlock wasn't going to be any different. Although he did allow himself to hope that it would take quite a while before he got bored with Sherlock, because at the moment he was enjoying his life as he hadn't enjoyed it in a very long time.
One of them was Doris Adler, Violet's best – and only – friend. The two women had been friends since the day Doris' curious little girl peeked into a pram during a walk through the park. Violet's newborn son was its occupant, and little Irene had exclaimed that there was an angel in the pram, wanting to know if the woman pushing him was the Virgin Mary.
brave!" he jeered. "My goodness – this is certainly my lucky day!" He favoured Sherlock with an icy glare. "Enough foreplay for today. Get undressed. And make it quick!" he barked.
A deep, dark desire rushed through John's veins, along with a healthy dose of adrenaline, and quite against his will, his tightly clenched hands opened, his fingers seeking and finding their way to Sherlock's head, where they slid through the dark curls in an unsually gentle gesture.
"Drink," he commanded softly, and Sherlock leaned forward, careful not to lose his balance with his hands bound as they were, and sucked at the straw, making his cheekbones stand out prominently and sending a fresh wave of desire through John's body.
And so Mike inquired, "Why don't you ask him yourself?" Not that he was questioning Sherlock's motives - Sherlock was as loyal to John as Mike was - but still, he wanted to know. He at least wanted to try to get a handle on the secret he'd scented in that hesitation.
' was mentioned there. John suspected for a while that it was the same person. But you know all this already - you were there when John and I discussed it."
Without paying attention to John's objection, therefore, Sherlock lowered his mouth to John's lips for a hungry kiss.
Although Sherlock's exhaustion was written all over his face, he reacted extremely enthusiastically to John's initial thrusts. He wrapped his legs around John's hips and, with a throaty sigh, arched his back in order to better be able to take John's erection in even deeper.
"Back to business then. Fine with me," John said matter-of-factly. "I believe I told you to suck me. Why is it taking so long? Who do I have to sleep with around here to get what I paid for?"
"Names," John replied promptly. "I want to know who's mixed up in this mess against me. I want to know if it was all your idea or if there's a big, bad bogey man behind the scenes."
Following dinner, however, Sherlock started to get the sneaking suspicion that he embodied Jacques' new tin god, and as such was at the mercy of the butler's particular brand of adulation; for when Jacques brought in the coffee, Sherlock's saucer boasted not one, but two of the delicate almond biscuits, whereas John was only served one of the confections, as usual.
John rewarded him with a smile, bent down to give him a quick kiss on the mouth, wished him a good night, and then left the room … down the hall … to his own bathroom. A short while later, Sherlock heard water running, and later still the bathroom door opened and closed. More steps in the hall, and then another door opened and closed.
He'd glowered at her for that incredibly stupid little joke, but she'd probably also noticed the trembling in his hands, nullifying the impact of his glare, since she'd walked right on past him with a laugh and a wiggle of her hips – and a sly wink. Sherlock had simply stood there for quite some time before becoming aware of the enema kit in his hands and running off to his room.
Once there, she didn't beat around the bush for long, giving Sherlock a resounding slap – before the eyes of the horrified and still speechless client – thus causing him to fall silent.
But rather than telling him to get out of the bathtub, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's chest in a loose hug. Sherlock's thoughts raced. Why wasn't John acting in accordance with Sherlock's earlier experiences? Would he ever understand John? Did all of this mean that John actually was susceptible to being hurt? He'd cut off his own hand before hurting him! But ... what would happen if he – as was his wont – made a thoughtless remark? What if his mouth raced ahead of his brain? What then? Sherlock nestled down carefully into John's embrace, feeling a bit distressed and discouraged, only to register with relief how John's arms tightened around him.
John's lips curled. "Your affinity for the truth always pops up at such inopportune moments. Didn't anyone ever tell you that kind of honesty is highly inappropriate in your profession?"
"Sherlock Sigerson..." John finally drawled. "I'm afraid we're going to have to have a little talk."
"Hit me, John... please, hit me... on my... on my... my hole..." Sherlock whispered haltingly. Despite the heat that suffused his body, he still felt the shame of those vulgar words making the blood shoot into his cheeks.
Mycroft nudged a pebble into the water with the toe of his shoe, scaring away the ducks. "You should get a divorce," he mentioned apropos of nothing.
Just a little something to whet your appetite... and the proof, that the translation is really happening!
Anthea snorted. "Why's that tosser still here, anyway? The boss has kept him longer than any of the others."
“Not really,” Sherlock replied, and Dave’s eyebrows shot up in alarm. “I need to ask you and Naresh a few questions.”
"No, Mike!" Sherlock cut him off. "You don't have to do anything. John is not to hear of this! He'll only go and do something rash, and then this sinister opponent will be forewarned. In the meantime, I'll put out some feelers."
John thought, rubbing his hands to himself. This evening was proving even more interesting and entertaining than he'd dared to hope.
Sherlock followed these instructions without objection as well – or at least he tried to. His chest rose and fell with the rhythm of his deep, even (or at least an approximation thereof) breaths. When John moved his left hand from its soothing position on Sherlock's knee to drag it up the inside of his thigh, he could feel the tense muscles there relaxing a bit under his fingers.
Sherlock stood around in front of the windows, feeling as superfluous and out of place as a penguin in the Sahara.
John sat next to him on the bed and lifted his chin with two fingers. "There are other options." It was ridiculous how quickly Sherlock's face could brighten. Ridiculous and... a little touching. John swung his legs up onto the mattress, leaned back against the head of the bed and propped up the pillows behind his back. "Come here," he said softly to Sherlock. "Here... on my lap." He patted one hand on his thigh to make clear what he meant and extended the other arm in invitation.
Sherlock groaned and pushed back even closer against John's body, pushed himself deliberately even closer to John's hard erection at his back, yet didn't give any indication of struggling against John's loose grip around his wrist. Quite the opposite, he accepted John's power over his desire, over his ecstasy, over his release, and gave in completely to his own helplessness.
Sherlock didn't stand up, but he pulled himself in tighter and began rubbing his groin against John's knee.
"Hello, mayor!" he cheerfully addressed the man behind the wheel of the car. "Might I point out to you that you're violating the rules of the road? This isn't a public thoroughfare, and I don't believe parking is allowed here. How's that compatible with the stature of your position?"
But Greg could be stubborn too. "Mycroft... they're in love. Even a blind man with a cane could see that."
"That's more like the style of your bosom buddy, Mycroft Holmes. I can't say I enjoyed bearing witness from afar to your rapid rapprochement. I have to admit it's a rather large thorn in my side and has caused me considerable inconvenience. Rather astonishing that even your pet has the mayor's number stored in his phone. He didn't have anything to say about it... but... was the relationship between the mobster and the politician really so close that the two of you played...
' Sherlock thought, and pressed his lips to John's mouth again, hoping that one kiss would express everything his vocal cords were unable to.
"Good. Then go and take care of it," Sherlock said and let him go, although he still didn't look at him. "The whole upset was for nothing anyway," he continued, sounding so hesitant that John's curiosity was aroused.
"No – no budget. No limit. The outcome of this election is of the utmost importance for our business dealings. We can't afford to skimp. That would be cutting the wrong corners."
The moment he discovered (he did have internet access and wasn't exactly a novice when it came to research – a souvenir from his uni days) that John Watson went by the nickname
One last jerk, the final throes, one more weak emission and then... strong arms wrapping around him, a warm, sweaty body nestling up against him, gentle kisses on his cheek, throat, neck, and shoulders, lips whispering against his skin,
"It's none of your business," Sherlock blurted out gruffly. "It has absolutely nothing to do with you, and I..."
"John... what about the gun?" Mycroft asked tentatively. "Fingerprints?" He indicated John's leather gloves with his chin.
"These are props!" Sherlock exclaimed, pulling out an entire row of false book covers that had been glued together.
"You poor thing," John said, half teasing and half touched. "So much unnecessary self-control... I actually wanted to come at the same time as you, but your unexpected obedience seems to have thrown a spanner into the works." He ran his fingers playfully over Sherlock's stiff cock. Sherlock whimpered and his hips jerked forward of their own accord. "Really quite remarkable... and completely unnecessary..."
As incredible as it might sound, John Watson appeared to have found just such a person in his impossible brother, Sherlock, whereas he, himself... Mycroft held back a low-pitched expletive. Yes, he'd had a say in the form of the ice sculpture. Yes, he'd planned on engaging Gregory in a casual conversation - accompanied by a glass of champagne - and mentioning koi fish in general, as well as their meaning in Japan. Nothing more than that.
It cost him a great deal of willpower to turn his thoughts away from that desire. Although he had no doubt that a climax in that manner would be absolutely spectacular, that wasn't the reason he was here. He hadn't written out a cheque for such a ridiculous amount for a quickie blowjob. When John felt the light scratch of fingernails on his testicles through the material and a hand fumbling for his flies, he decided this was the point where he was going to end this game – where he
The blinds had already been lowered over the windows a few hours earlier in order to keep the temperature in the room pleasant - or at least bearable - for as long as possible. Because today, of all days, the environmentally friendly, chilled-water air conditioning system (its designers' pride and joy) had gone on the fritz, meaning that the heat had already built up behind the glass facade despite the blinds, and both men had taken off their suit jackets some time ago.
Which brought Sherlock once again to the question of what exactly John saw in him … given how often his mouth ran away from his brain … or rather: how often his brain took his mouth hostage and sabotaged his self-preservation instinct.
"You've just mentioned an interesting topic," Mycroft resumed their conversation once he'd sat down in his chair again. "Organised crime."
I don't want to say at all that every 'No' is really a 'Yes' underneath, or that a lack of overtly expressed permission is a 'Yes' either. I also don't want to side with those people who say, 'you want it too'. That's not my intention at all. It has to be mutual. Anything else is wrong. And I'm sure that for every woman like the one in that article, there are a hundred others who don't fit that pattern.
His hand, still buried in the dark hair, gripped some of the curls roughly, pulled, and tore Sherlock away so powerfully that he fell, landing on his back.
Sherlock allowed himself a bit of hope at those words and opened his eyes again. He could take anything, anything at all, as long as John didn't send him away! And that really didn't sound like sending away. He followed the instructions as quickly as he could, although he kept his head bowed.
Sherlock's willingness was extremely arousing, and the pleasure he took in this kind of pain was highly stimulating. John's own erection pressed almost painfully against the flies of his trousers.
"Yes, that's how we'll do it," John said half to himself, clamping his hands together behind his back. Then he looked Sherlock over from head to foot - Sherlock secretly called it the
"Says the man who's always complaining I don't eat enough," Sherlock mumbled sleepily into John's neck.
John raised an eyebrow. “So what if she did?” he retorted. “The fact is, she let you go and I don't understand why you aren't already packing your bags!”
Mike sighed and set about combing through John's diary for alternate meeting times to offer to the various contacts. After a while, he raised his head and noticed that John was staring out the window, completely lost in thought.
Mycroft inspected the tips of his shoes for a moment before looking the Inspector directly in the eye.
"Mike," John interrupted him, both quiet and urgent. "It would end up being more than five minutes."
"Not helping," Sherlock hissed, wriggled his arse around a bit against his heels and groaned softly. "What happens... if I ... if I don't make it?" he gasped, turning his bleary gaze to John as he continued to pump his stiff shaft with rapid movements.
"She attempted suicide," Mycroft said, lowering his voice further. "Rather amateurishly, if you want my opinion. She's under medical supervision at the moment. She must have found out about Moriarty's... fate, some way or another. Her resignation has already been tendered. It will be announced two days from now... nervous breakdown or burn-out, it's not yet been decided what the press is to be told. Personally, I favour burn-out... it makes more sense in light of all of her achievements."
Sherlock had waited in the room, pacing back and forth – wearing only a dressing gown – in an attempt to regain control over his nerves and all the emotions that had been stirred up in him.
Sherlock snorted. "There's no need to flatter me," he scoffed. "You bought me. I am to follow your instructions. We'd best simply get it over with. The sooner the better."
"Yeah, I assume so," John replied good-naturedly. "Whenever you don't toe the line. Constantly, in other words." He shrugged again. "But I always knew that you only follow those instructions you want to."
“Listen, Mike,” he said with deliberate patience. “I don't care how you finagle things, but I want a window of two hours by Thursday at the latest.”
"Yeah..." John scratched the back of his neck in embarrassment. "I started learning both languages at one point and thought... it might be easier with fairy tales." He shook his head. "I eventually realised I didn't have time for it and gave it up. Too bad, actually … I have lucrative business ties to both countries. It would have been an advantage … but what can you do?" he concluded with a shrug. "Translators also need to make a living, and at least I can ask for directions in both languages and read the menu in a restaurant. I'll never get lost or starve in Italy or Germany. But leave the books for now. Come on - I'll show you the rest."
"Oh... well... anyway... You might have had something else planned," Greg babbled, wishing nothing more than to give himself a good, hard kick in the arse. He'd narrowly avoiding putting one foot in his mouth solely thanks to Holmes' courtesy, and now he was about to stick the other one in. It was all well and good to be curious about the man behind the chain of command... but did he have to act like such an arse while doing it? He was better than this! Even as a young sergeant, he'd conducted interrogations that had been much better thought out than this!
Sherlock couldn't fall back asleep. He was suddenly overcome by the desire for a cigarette and a shower. As he was imagining himself taking a nice, long, hot shower, he realised how thirsty he was. Annoying. If he'd known John was going to lock him in... Sherlock sighed, miffed. He should have anticipated it if he'd really listened to what Mike had said.
I might give you the corpse, and maybe even enough useful evidence for you to look good in the public eye. It might also be more appropriate not to discuss things like this over the phone. Why don't we meet at noon tomorrow in the usual place?"
“Insatiable...” John growled, pushed Sherlock back a bit and freed his cock as well as he could from his pants. Then he grabbed Sherlock's hips and pulled him close again.
Sherlock took his lockpicking tools and went to the bedroom, where he pushed down on the door handle without bothering to knock. But the door was apparently locked and didn't budge. Inside the room, John must have noticed that someone was trying to gain entry, and he pounded his fist against the door.
John shrugged his shoulders casually. "Of course I knew where you were every time it seemed like you'd vanished from the face of the earth." He walked over to Sherlock and put his arm around his waist. "They're papering in here tomorrow and then they're laying the parquet. After that all that's left is painting, and then we can have all that furniture we ordered delivered and set up. The bed's going here, right?"
The extra night was necessary, unfortunately, due to it being such a long drive back to London. Dave and Naresh would take turns at the wheel, but he didn't want to make either of them undertake such a strenuous drive at night. Moran, on the other hand, had left right after the meeting with his two companions. John shrugged his shoulders. Everyone did whatever they thought was best.
Sherlock's skin must be wet by now... with sweat and other fluids... his cock hard and swollen... the head plump and a deep red... and nothing was stopping him from pleasuring himself... nothing... other than John's word.
Sherlock had to hold back the unexpected - and completely unwanted - tears that came to his eyes. How did John do that? How did he manage, in such uninspired words - little more than an aside - to paint a picture of the future that tempted Sherlock with such vibrant colours? One of them needed to maintain a cool head in this matter, however. And if John wasn't going to take on that role, then it would have to be Sherlock.
Once Mike had closed the door a touch too firmly behind himself and the two men were alone once more, John resumed speaking.
The evening was going differently than he'd planned. He'd reckoned with a few kisses, maybe manual or even oral stimulation... but Greg's direct and almost aggressive sexuality had jettisoned all his preconceptions without so much as a by-your-leave. Greg's desire had simply overwhelmed him. Not that he didn't want it too... but maybe it was going just a tad too fast for him.
A gleeful chuckle burbled up in Greg's throat, but he couldn't afford to let it out. Mycroft was actually upset and worried, and it wouldn't be appropriate to make jokes in light of his anguish. And so Greg made a concerted effort to remain somber and to answer seriously, even if he couldn't entirely keep his dissension out of his response.
John set off in his car directly after his call to Mycroft. When he arrived at his destination, John left the car in a side street, crossed the Seven Sisters Road, and stopped in front of the side entrance to Finsbury Park. The picket fence wouldn't have posed any obstacle to him, but he checked whether the gate was open anyway. It turned out it swung open easily after he gave it a light push. His tongue ran across his cold, dry lips in a vain attempt to moisten them.
The shame threatened to overwhelm him, and all of a sudden it was just like back at the first university he'd gone to...
John had mercy and explained: "No, I can keep my gun. No one will be able to prove I was the one who fired based on the bullets."
"This Donovan seems to be a remarkable woman with a remarkably long reach," Mycroft stated in a tone that bordered on admiring.
Patrick looked up from his beer and checked out the stranger standing before him in his Londonderry local.
“I saw that you were worrying about it and it’s completely unnecessary.” Sherlock explained. “So I decided to tell you that it’s not your fault. I love you and the sex is nice.”
"No, it wasn't," John said, making a spur of the moment decision to be completely honest. "Look... I understand you pretty well. I feel the same way. London. My city. My privilege. My responsibility." He shrugged his shoulders. "I can accept that way of looking at it. And so once again my question: what do you want?"
"You can begin any time... I'm just waiting for you..." John grasped Sherlock's hips with his hands and felt the shudder that ran through the entire oversensitive body.
John let out a short, light chuckle. "What am I supposed to do now? Prove it to you? Should I make Sherlock sit up and beg so you can see he toes the line with me?"
"I didn't think he was so bad," Thomas said, shrugging, as he retrieved a glass from one of the cupboards. "At least he didn't make me run up and down the stairs four times. That's something, isn't it? The bloke didn't fall on his head."
John's jaw clenched before he laughed, albeit without humour. "Then you know how stupid it makes you act."
Irene jumped at the dramatic entrance, but didn't want to let on how startled she was. “I didn't hear you knock,” she remarked tightly.
Mike remained silent for a moment in the wake of the shock, but then he ranted: "Are you mental? You can't show up at a funeral in a grey suit!"
Sherlock's entire body twitched when he felt the mouth of another man for the first time. It was so wet and warm and tight … no wonder everyone was so obsessed with oral sex … It wasn't as if Sherlock had never felt a tongue on his shaft before, but no one had ever truly given him sexual pleasure with their mouth – and it was certainly something he never expected from John.
"Blowjobs," he said straightforwardly. "I suck cock – and I'm extraordinarily good at it. The best in the house." He stared up at the ceiling, lost in thought for a moment, before looking at John again. His eyebrows curved up slightly. "I may even be the best in London," he stated in all seriousness.
Greg fell silent again, staring at Mycroft in the darkness with both disbelief and annoyance. "All right, that's it," he snapped. "I'm calling the police."
Naturally, the topic had come up more than once in the meantime, and they'd talked about it... what had occurred... they'd discussed the events themselves... but they'd never discussed what had really happened
The dark eyebrows pulled together with a lack of comprehension. It was terribly difficult to think, especially when he was so bloody tired.
, I do mean single. She hasn't got any family, no friends, no pets, no hobbies... at least none she wanted to tell me about. Then I took a look at her file."
"Figure it out," John answered, provocation underlying his words, and took two steps into the room. The spicy sweet fragrance of cedar wood billowed out from his clothing in a gentle cloud of scent, becoming intense as it went up Sherlock's nose. The typical aromas of tobacco, still infused with the fresh moisture of a cooled climate chamber, mingled with the faintly dusty air of their living room. Sherlock hungrily breathed in the telltale signs of an exclusive tobacco shop.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek. "It's probably best if I start with the new Inspector, that chap Lestrade. He's been a thorn in my side for a while now. Simply doesn't want to be bought off."
subject... You have to do me a favour," he blurted out. Now that he'd taken the first step, he was once again able to look her in the eye.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find out whether the mayor actually opens the Winter Wonderland with an official speech like I've depicted it here in my story. But I wrote it this way because here in Germany the mayor usually opens public festivals... and gets the first glass of beer!
"Let me... please, John... let me suck your cock... please... I want to feel you... on my tongue... in my mouth... in my throat..."
No – he had no desire for tobacco anymore. Not so much as a single crumb. He lifted his eyebrows, both slightly surprised and grudgingly admiring. Had John's therapy really been successful? Had he really learned his lesson when he'd had to make a choice between John and the cigar while under the influence of a lust-filled haze?
With a concerted effort, Sherlock was finally able to put together a coherent sentence and force it out through his vocal cords. "I haven't touched myself there...
"Is it good like this, sir?" the young painter's apprentice asked as he added one more dab of colour to the freshly whitewashed wall with a practised hand. All of the other workers had taken an early lunch - the clock had just struck eleven - and scattered to the four winds. Only the youngest member of their group had stayed behind.
"Prince Charles probably has similar problems," Mycroft remarked absently. Unfortunately, that made him think of how similar Greg and Doc Watson were in certain regards. He nicked the cigarette out of Greg's mouth with two fingers in order to banish the memory of the mob boss.
Bad? Mike didn't know how to answer that question. What was Sherlock referring to? The fact that John was scared? Or the fact that John had admitted it to Sherlock? Or did Sherlock want to know if it was a bad thing that he hadn't noticed John's fear?
John snorted in amusement. "I didn't mean it like that, and you know it. You'd have to do much worse for me to really throw you out." He blinked. "God, I must be insane," he said half to himself, rubbing his hand over his face. Now that his anger was slowly dissipating, he was starting to feel rather tired.
John was speechless for a moment. That response came as such a surprise he didn't know what else to say. Sherlock was right. He'd never gone to the trouble – or even mentioned – that he wanted to have Sherlock for himself. It simply hadn't occurred to him.
"Nothing," Sherlock sniffled, his voice thick, and wiped away the scant tears that had escaped his eyes with a surly gesture. "It's just..." He looked away. "Such good things don't normally happen to me..." he said quietly.
Sherlock gave him an uncertain look, his eyes slightly narrowed, as his fingers played nervously with the top button of his impeccably tailored shirt.
"Wait... something's still missing," John said, reaching between the cheeks of Sherlock's arse. With a practised move, he slowly removed the plug. Sherlock's muscles protested, wanting to keep the invader inside, but finally released it, and Sherlock sighed in relief. His relief didn't last long, however, as he realised to his mortification that John's semen was dripping out of him and running down his thighs. John placed one hand on Sherlock's hip. Sherlock felt that hand tremble, and once again he had the urge to look at John, wanting to know what this was all supposed to mean.
John didn't need to be told again. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, he drove the sound into Sherlock's hard, twitching penis, pulling it out at the same speed. Over and over again.
"Hello, Sherlock," she greeted him cheerfully and with a friendly smile, although her impatience was evident.
John burst out laughing. "No - good God, no. He has a wife and his own house. I wouldn't have a moment's peace otherwise." John sighed. "He means well. And if I hadn't had him... I don't know if I'd be here today. Anyway, he was the one who told me to go to Miss Adler's that night."
"Oh yes..." Sherlock replied, with a long, drawn-out sigh. His hands spanned John's hips while his gaze remained steadfastly fixed on the slight bulge that showed through John's trousers. His face pressed closer and closer without needing any further encouragement, until his lips were in contact with the smooth material. John's eyes closed of their own volition as Sherlock's lips parted and his warm, moist breath penetrated the cloth. John's cock swelled a little more under the unexpectedly gentle treatment, showing its outline ever more clearly through his clothing and making it easy for Sherlock to gauge its position and press hot, open-mouthed kisses directly over his nascent erection.
So John was upset because of a chance meeting with his former... domestic partner … (even thinking the word made Sherlock feel physically ill). That was understandable. The question was: was John angry, or more sad? Was he grieving a lost opportunity? Or had his temper got the better of him and he was furious because he'd never exacted revenge... never been able to do so? Sherlock's brows drew together in irritation - without any additional details, it was impossible to answer those questions.
"All right, fine," John growled, having bid good-bye to his self-control following that speech. "You asked for it. But don't say I didn't warn you!" '
At the same moment, John Watson was descending the stairs of the brothel as fast as he could. He couldn't stand that lost, empty look in those fascinating, pale eyes for one more second.
numbers must be wrong," he finally blurted out. "Your records are the ones that have been doctored."
“Don't look so grim, Doc. For the price of a smile I'll introduce you to the new Columbian ambassador later this week. It might be useful to you.”
"No?" Greg inquired, mostly because it was apparent he was expected to, even as he tried to suppress an amused grin.
Jacques approached the table again. It was obvious that it was a struggle for him, but he managed to ask Sherlock with unruffled politeness, "How do you take your coffee?"
“Good morning, Mr Watson,” she greeted him with a broad, friendly smile. “Please... have a seat.” With an elegant wave of her hand, she indicated the chair in front of her desk. He nodded once and sat down.
"There's something I've been meaning to ask you this whole time... How did you manage to finagle things so that this strait-laced hospital is treating my bullet wound... even wrote it up like that in my chart... yet neither myself nor John have been bothered by the police?"
John inspected the tips of his shoes just a moment too long. "You know why I go to her," he said gruffly. "So that something like... what happened after Crieff doesn't happen again. I'm doing it... for you."
"No..." Greg said with a warm smile and touched Mycroft's fingers to stop what they were doing. "Leave all of that on." Mycroft nodded silently. Astonishingly, he was incapable of making any further remark. In contrast, his nerve endings seemed to be on full alert. Even the smallest touch sent shock waves out from his brain. Both Greg's hands and his warm, shining eyes slid down Mycroft's body. When firm fingers closed around his erection and stroked his balls, Mycroft's eyes fell shut as if of their own accord, and he moaned softly.
Sherlock raised one eyebrow. "No buts. You want to set a good example, don't you? Or am I really so wrong about you? Don't go asking John. I want Jacques to be hired back and your only question should be
Greg barked out a short laugh. "You know... you're not exactly top of your game today," he noted, shaking his head.
While they waited, Dave smoked another cigarette, which put Sherlock’s self-control and willpower to a surprisingly hard test. He therefore breathed a sigh of relief when Naresh joined them, looking both suspicious and curious.
