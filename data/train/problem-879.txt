“Oh, sure, go ahead.” Sherlock tilts his face to let John inspect the pattern from the stitches. “Be gentle, please.”
They forget to open the envelope from Harry until all their guests have left and Rosie is having a well-deserved nap.
John almost stumbles into the shower, feeling a stiffness setting in.  He should've been stretching after such a workout.  The steamy shower helps a bit, though.
“Yeah, that’s just it, Harry,” he snaps. “You’ve got friends who are just like you. As I said, I’ve never-”
Because it was not a mistake. A doctor kicking someone lying down is not a mistake. That’s grounds for getting struck off. He can’t say that.
"No bloodshed.  He was only being rough, then flexing the knife to keep me off.  It's just a scratch."
Only one thing breaks his resolve, going through Mary’s few pieces of jewellery on the shelves in the bathroom.
Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder jerks him out of the unnatural sounds emanating from the despair within.
Sherlock steps out of the bathroom.  "Well, to be fair, neither I, nor the Inspector, knew about that connection when he called me in.  And, I haven't told him yet, so who have you been talking to?"
Groups of tourists with guides are popping up as the green returns. The occasional junkie walks too fast through the park, making weird noises.
The frost is near, so Rosie helps picking the remaining tomatoes, bring them inside and put them on the windowsill to slowly ripen during sunny hours.
When Sherlock opens his eyes again, John is nearer still, so it takes no effort at all to tilt his head down to meet him.
Sherlock frowns.  "You know I don't wear a tie.  You're welcome to sell them any day, though Brighton isn't known to be that expensive."
Wendy Badu turns to Sherlock, raising her eyebrows.  "Well, as you are all-knowing I suppose you already know that he was pickling Japanese knotweed?"
"You'll have to be a bit more specific, John," Sherlock says patiently, still bee-watching.  At this point he's disinclined to help.  He needs to hear whatever John has to say in his own words, to be able to make a rational decision about this mess.
"It sounds like the same old story, to me.  He's always gone with these super dramatic gestures, which apparently appeals to you."  John gives him a pointed look.  "So why would he go to all that trouble with a super-code if he's not even interested in the power it gives him?  I mean, if he could convince you about it, hasn't he reached his goal then, without too much work?  The constant bragging isn't new.  He wants to make himself seem like a genius, just like you, so you'll play with him.  You said the thing with the trainers was your first case, of sorts.  He's obviously been obsessed with you for years."
“He punched me first. It was for a case. A- a disguise. He was supposed to be this reverend who-” he shakes his head. “Never mind. It’s fucked up, I know.”
“Obviously. Though there’s no certainty city bees will produce that much - too wide an area with no reliable foliage or plant life - but they’re quite resilient, and we have the park nearby, so it will be interesting to see what they produce. Sycamore honey is said to be dark and strong-flavoured. I hope to at least get a taste of it.”
Mary shifts her heavily pregnant body beside him. John tries to concentrate on the comforting scent of her hair, her measured breathing… anything that will absolve him of the guilt creeping its way into his mind and heart.
“It’s just simple cause and effect. There’s nothing in it making us lesser, unworthy. It’s just what it is. We’re not alone. I have many friends who-”
The room opens up towards the garden with a sliding glass door, now covered by a sheer white curtain, with heavier slate grey curtains on the side.  Sherlock sits down in the solitary swivelling lounge chair placed in front of them.  John can't help but notice how the teal velvet fabric of the chair compliments his dark blue shirt, as well as the man himself, of course.  Sherlock relieves himself of his fine wool trousers, and then brings them to the bathroom to rinse out the saltwater.
“Harry, I’m not judging you. Not at all. What you have managed to do is- it’s just extraordinary. To be able to take on that fight, again and again. I don’t know if I could have done it. I admire you.”
He releases the towel from under Sherlock’s bum. Folds it and prompts Sherlock to let it back in under his tailbone. He pulls at his hips and Sherlock moves sluggishly but manages to balance better. John continues caressing his thighs, working down to his calves. Then he grips his ankles, pushing up against the edge of the seat. Sherlock’s head lolls to the other side, watching him as John puts Sherlock’s heels on the edge, legs folded, crotch exposed. John strokes his sticky cheek, slips in a thumb between plush lips and Sherlock sucks it, swirls his tongue, never breaking eye contact. John’s blood rushes. He switches his thumb for his index finger, then adds his middle finger, lightly pressing down into that talented tongue. He can feel Sherlock’s mouth watering.
Living with a small child means nothing is constant. Everything is always in a state of flux, of change.
They’re still enjoying the soporific effect of their treatments. John is comfortably seated in a reclining chair, with fresh fruit and lemon infused water at hand. Sherlock is right by his side, close enough to touch. John noticed how Sherlock discreetly pushed their chairs closer together while John inspected the trees to see if they were real. They are.
The garden consists of just a plain lawn walled in on three sides, with a garden shed in the back.  No flowerbeds or fruit trees.  The shed is taped off.  There's officers with torchlights in the man-high shrubbery behind it.
This time John thinks the young man is close to being indiscreet, but he realises that it's probably all in his own mind.
"He was stupid enough to do it himself," Sherlock blurts out.  "I'm sorry, Miss Badu, but that's the truth."
The small seedlings in Catherine’s window, planted by her right before she had the fatal stroke, cared for by Harry and John, had produced tomatoes, and Harry took care of their seeds, for Rosie.
"What are you after, John?" Sherlock says, fiddling intensely with the broken shell in his pocket.  "A night of passion?  You know you can find that elsewhere."  He braces for John's answer, pressing the sharpest edge of the shell into the palm of his clenched fist.
“You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever met,” he says softly, breathing into his ear. “Please, let me have you.”
He leans back against the chair and looks to the ceiling with tears welling up, letting them spill out of the corners of his eyes. He’s not the victim here. He snorts at his self-pity. Takes a deep breath through his nose and looks out the window.
John mostly doesn’t see the scar on Sherlock’s eyebrow. It’s faded to a thin, almost pearly white, line. He’s kissed it plenty of times, when he occasionally falls back into despair and doubt.
"I opted to spare him.  He offered us to move one floor up, to the Ibiza Suite, with guaranteed sea view.  I declined."
Sherlock is apparently already done, as John can see him hovering by the door to the flat.  He comes closer, taking the plastic bag, weighing it in his hand.  "Miss Cushing, exactly how long have you been receiving these letters?"
He cherishes the usual sensations of warm fingers touching him, the gentle massage a relaxant. Today, there’s a heightened sensitivity in his left hand, where his digits had flown over the fingerboard for so long. Small sparks fly when the tips of his fingers are gently pressed, massaged in small circles. The light pain is not enough to produce the level of endorphin he craves, but it’s still something. Oxytocin, without personal attachment. It’ll have to do.
He breaks down in tears, his head buried in his hands, until the inexplicable happens: Sherlock takes him in his arms and comforts him. John is so weary that he lets him.
Sherlock crouches outside the door opening, spies the trodden mud, sighs deeply, then makes a show of exclaiming, "Oh, footprints!"
John is quite sheepish once he's introduced to the proprietor.  Majida is lovely--and very easy on the eyes.  She's dressed in a pristine shirt, jacket, and well pressed trousers.  He gets the feeling she might share a tailor with Sherlock.  It makes his own barely decent clothing stand out.
It is what it is," he finishes. The words he’d used to say to himself so often, since John had been engaged to Mary and drifted further and further away from him.
Sherlock is busy draping the trouser legs over the long bench, then pushing it within a safe distance from the radiator.  John needs to pour himself a second drink, but Sherlock declines a refill.
"When you said Brian used to spend time in the shed, I was terrified you'd find something there.  I've never been inside, and I knew he used to muck about
"Oh, that's what he needed the oven for!" John blurts out, feeling clever.  "I thought it was odd Miss Cushing only mentioned Brian needing the oven, and not you, if you both have kitchenettes."
Sherlock returns a half hour later, when it's become fully dark outside.  He's pissing wet in his bathrobe and towel, looking for all the world like a drowned cat.  His curls are matted to this head, his skin shiny and a bit feverish.  John hopes the nutter hadn't caught a cold while he was polluting his lungs.
"Well, you've certainly put yourself in a bit of a predicament," says Sherlock.  "However, it seems like I was being indiscreet when I, against all protocol, spoke
John turns his head to look at their cover.  He can't see any details in the dark, but he recognises the bamboo-like shape of the stems.  "Bloody hell!"
In the early morning, they eat their breakfast in the garden. Harry’s brought the hifi to life in the lounge, and now some raging anti-war metal song is blaring from the speakers in there, loud enough to be heard outside. She really is annoyingly spiteful, but mostly in good humour.
John huffs, one hand resting on the side of Sherlock's neck, the thumb gently nudging his jaw to adjust the angle of his face.  He dabs the warm towel all over Sherlock's cheeks and jaw to get rid of any remaining strands of lather.  Sherlock manages to get another drag before continuing.  "And finally, three, when it came to Irene, I made a mistake, relying on the most common assumption, when I concluded that the rapid beat of her pulse must have been a sign of attraction.  But, an increased heart rate can be indicative of either anger, attraction, excitement or fear.  So, tell me John."  He flicks off some ash into the basin, before placing his left hand on top of John's on his neck.  "Which is this a sign of?"
John goes to put on his coat; the sun is rising and Rosie needs to be picked up soon. Sherlock can hear the skip in John’s step as he descends the stairs.
This was the norm, when they were teenagers. She’d practically moved in with Catherine and John came here too, to relax, feel at ease. They were always welcome at any hour, no questions asked.
Sherlock is wearing a tight vest under a perfectly sized hoodie, joggers and trainers. He’s pulled back his hair with gel, put on sunglasses, carries a bottle of water, and wears a pair of in-ear headphones for show. The traffic outside the old industrial building is deafening, so he keeps his eyes moving, scanning the surroundings. He pretends to stretch, leaning a hand against the wall just beside the large windows to get a discreet peek inside.
Presently, John stands leaning against the railing, absentmindedly nibbling on his ice cream, seemingly spying for a glimpse of France in the distance.
Damn pickpocket.  He'll need to immobilise Sherlock's thumb so the mild sprain won't become a full-on ligament tear.
He lets go of John’s hand. He’s being mean. He doesn’t want to be mean to John. But he doesn’t want this- destruction. He’s about to cry.
John's at home after a few days of too many hours at the clinic. Very voluntary hours, only briefly checking in on the now tobacco-infested flat.  He's mostly kept himself upstairs in his room, but once in a while, he needs the loo, or the kitchen.  Sherlock's incessant indoors smoking has left John with a near empty wardrobe, since the smell of tobacco makes his clothes unwearable after only a day's use.  He doesn't trust Sherlock with doing the laundry when he's home alone, so the pile of dirty clothes has only been growing over the past week, and John is all but out of his favourite clothes.
"I suppose they share."  She shrugs.  "There are locked storage buildings further up the path.  I've only been here once before, but he regularly brought me flowers from his lot."
Not long after, she’d started drinking. Not copious amounts, but she tended to be the one who seemed sober for far longer than the rest. Her tolerance was increasing.
“Yes you do. I’ve seen it before. Not just me and Catherine. Obviously our parents, I’d never criticise you for that. I did the same as soon as I moved out.”
John doesn’t answer, only swallows hard, tears filling his eyes. Sherlock’s not sure if it’s from the stinging of the slaps, or if it’s emotion showing there. Sherlock is angry and sad, weary of the unspoken hurt between them.
Sherlock presents John with the fact on the day of moving, which in hindsight might have been a less than good idea.
She follows John's gaze.  "Oh, he doesn't mind, truly.  I usually do that when I need something from him.  He comes down within a minute."
“I like women too much to stay away for long. I just think it’s good with some peace of mind. Really settling into this new sober life. Besides, I’ve got friends. Lots. I’m not isolating myself, though I understand it may look like it since I’m always by myself when you visit.”
That was a blessing in a way. She poked at him, and giggled at his grumpy reactions. It could have been infuriating, but it wasn’t really. It was more of a comfortable, though not always enjoyable, companionable tease. He could relax, knowing she could read the most important things.
Yep, that’s him all over. Every description rips through his chest. He clenches his hands, pinches his thigh hard, tries to keep breathing slowly and evenly. At the bottom of the list his fear is written in letters that burns his eyes.
Yes, she’d really changed things for him. Meeting her was the best thing that could have happened after...
“Oh, you’re one to talk. You’re a quitter. Always finding a new odd subculture to hang on to, and then just leaving your new friends behind when they call out your drinking problems.”
"Great!"  Sherlock says, putting on a grin and then instantly dropping it.  "You've basically confirmed John's hypothesis--death by pickles.  Only, someone tried to burn them during the night, so we can't assume it was a mere accident.  Someone other than Brian James and Miss Cushing had access to the cupboard where he stored the pickles.  There's something more sinister going on with these!"  He shoves the jar into Molly's hands.
There’s a small sink in the hallway outside the storage room, but something seems off with the plumbing. Someone needs to see about that, he does need running water for his experiments at times.
, and now he’s getting a second chance at making things right between them. Get back to normal, without resentment and constant doubt. They’ll figure it out. How to be best mates again.
,” she nods, then smiles. “So that’s her name. Almost forgot there for a moment, you being a father and all…”
John tries to ignore the prickle on his skin whenever Sherlock mentions a female he's had any lengthy contact with.  The situation with Adler didn't end so well.  He hopes this one goes better.  "Right.  Well, let's go then."
Last time John fell asleep in a similar position, he woke up with a jerk, sat straight up looking anywhere but at Sherlock.  It hurt to see him distancing, but Sherlock knows it's for the best.  He's well prepared for John to wake up on his shoulder any minute now, and equally ready to do his bit of playacting, to save John from any embarrassment.  Anything to not succumb to the persistent desire for a deeper intimacy.
"Good," says John with a smile.  "Very good."  The smile wanes and he licks his lips.  "Huh.  That's great, actually."
It's a good thing that they both got a bit of target practice, even though the air rifles aren't really comparable to John's SIG-Sauer.  Sherlock suspects they might appreciate the practise soon.
Harry crosses her arms and tilts her chin. “You say I’m a quitter. Yes, I am. And you know what? I’m happy about it. Fuck that loyalty bullshit. I have succeeded, John. Repeatedly. Do you know how many times I’ve fought this shit and succeeded?”
John clears his throat.  "You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday."  He pauses, seemingly reluctant to broach the subject in broad daylight.  "Like in science--isn't it more often 'and' instead of either/or?  A combination?  I think it's a combination."
Greg turns to John.  "You had a theory regarding Mr James' medication, didn't you?"  At John's nod, he says, "You should check with Donovan, then."
"You're not slow.  Remember, you are unfailing as a brilliant conductor of light,"  Sherlock says, matter-of-factly.
John turns to the glass door, pulling aside the curtains to reveal nothing but the narrow back end of an overgrown garden.  The wind is whipping the high bamboo-like stems of a hedge grown wild, and the rain has finally started to fall.
“Let’s have a look at this and see if there’s any description you feel resonates with your experiences.”
Harry had such a good eye for seeing small things and their potential to become part of the fairy household.
"As I told you," John answers calmly, "it's always been a little bit of everything.  I know you like to quantify, but love is love, in my opinion."
God, what has he done? What madness has he destined himself to? This is foolhardy. Sherlock wants this so badly, but it can’t really be as it was before, can it?
Sherlock's eyelashes flutter.  "I suspect you're referring to romantic entanglement. I've already told you," he says, a bit tetchy.
“Mr Holmes, Mr Watson,” an attendant interrupts. “It’s almost time for your treatments. You’re welcome to prepare yourself and warm up in the hot room.”
A week later, when Rosie paints the warm kitchen radiator with crayons that melt, Sherlock preens and considers it her first experiment. He documents, on her behalf, the way that the red and the blue crayon mix together to make a disappointing grey, rather than a vibrant purple.
John shrugs. “I was a clever kid. I liked protocols and regulations, routine and purpose. I wanted to succeed. What I really wanted was to best my dad.”
"My cousin had been declined a loan when he wanted to buy a house.  It was near a water stream, where the knotweed naturally grows, and some of it was growing within the grounds of the property.  I read up on it, saw the removal companies' advertising.  I figured it could be worth a try; to bar any presumptive buyer from getting a loan, decrease the worth of the property.  Then, maybe the sister wouldn't be so intent on selling the house.
"The last train for tonight has already left London Blackfriars.  If we leave right now, we can catch it when it stops at East Croydon," John offers, smiling.
The door to the room at the end of the hallway is open, but Sherlock stops on the threshold.  He should have figured; it's not really surprising, but he hadn't really imagined it this way.  So, this is what John's been paving the way for during the whole day.
Why would she run to a violent showdown just because Sherlock texted? Why didn't she want to live for Rosie at least?
To their right, is the blinding reflection of sunlight from the ever moving ripple of waves, continuing beyond Brighton Pier, which is cast in a sharp silhouette. The constructional wonder rises high on a latticework of iron piles and tie rods.  Sea green water is constantly licking the mass of rusty columns, looking like the tree trunks of a dense forest supporting the wider pier-head.  The sound of flags flapping in the wind drifts from the top of the two white towers framing the entrance portal to the amusement arcade.  The sun gleams off its domed metallic roof.
He picks her up and sweeps her into a towel. There aren’t enough clean ones. He’s falling behind his washing schedule. Again.
It's a simple question.  It's a loss of equilibrium.  John squeezes his hand.  A grounding point of contact.
'.  And I can't work out what that is.  Believe me, I've been trying."  It's frustrating and tiresome, and Sherlock is sick of it.
"I can take care of that fuel container for you, just in case," John offers.  "It'd be best to avoid any unnecessary questions."
"Hey, great to have you here!"  Lestrade frowns a bit as he takes in Sherlock's appearance.  "New look?"
Sherlock returns with his trousers and a towel.  He lays the towel flat on top of the bed, then spreads the trousers evenly over the towel and rolls it all up tightly, using his right forearm to press down.
Sherlock explains the case up until this point while they ride the cab across town to a building site.
Whoever Mary really was, the things she left behind were few. Her documented history is short, her paperwork fake. He doesn’t even know if the things she’d brought into their home were things she genuinely liked or if they were there to add to a persona.
There’s nothing to it. It’s the only logical arrangement, since John is caring for a small child who needs to be fed and cleaned repeatedly. Of course he’s in more need of the room closest to the bathroom and the kitchen. While Rosie herself doesn’t take up much space at the moment, they can’t really cram in both bed, cot, changing table and all their belongings in the smaller room upstairs.
“I thought I did. I wanted to. So I said the words when you asked me. Even if you tricked me into it.”
It’s not very long yet, messy and uneven in the back, where it’s rubbed off every night when she turns her head in her sleep. John is not a fan of starting the day by chasing a half-naked toddler across the flat. So he sneakily changes Rosie’s nappy while she’s only half awake and brings her right from the bed into her highchair in the kitchen. Sherlock sips his coffee, squinting at her appearance.
Harry had glared at him, shrugged, walked out the door, nonchalantly throwing a scathing comeback behind her:
"I trust your judgement, John.  So, not dementia.  I believe there might be a professional behind this; long time psychological warfare, no claims made for blackmail, a noticeable lack of fingerprints and the like, the threat increasing over time, making use of a personal item to demonstrate they have access to her home, and then topping it off with the beheaded funeral flowers.  Those are significant.  And now, a murder in her garden shed.  What's next?"
“Eat?” Rosie giggles. She has no idea what most of what Sherlock says means, but she's delighted to be told anyway. It's infectious. John realises his cheeks are getting sore before he realises he's smiling.
Some time later, after downing a couple of glasses, he feels a relaxing warmth spreading inside.  What a feeling--sitting on the beach with windswept hair, listening to the loud rhythm of the crashing tide coming in.
Sherlock smirks and winks at him.  "Ah, John, the old lady is alive and well.  We'll soon find out if there's any connection between these events."
He sighs and contemplates this. How many times? If he dismisses his younger years and any violence directly related to cases, chasing suspects and maybe not being too polite about tackling them, there’s still... a lot.
It was relaxing in a way Sherlock's scrutiny never was. Sherlock had been picking him apart, like a specimen under his microscope. It had been a bit disconcerting. Because John had felt as if he had something to hide.
He inhales shakily, suddenly overcome with emotion. This was his second home for so many years. Or rather his only home. The other place never felt like it. No comfort there, no safety or trust.
Lestrade looks refreshed when they meet him in the garden.  "I hope some de-stressing has done you both good."  He smiles, then notices the matching salt stains on their trouser legs and muddy shoes, but doesn't comment.  Still, Sherlock glares at John.  Of course he can deduce that John had texted Lestrade about Sherlock needing time off.  Not some crap about the case being too boring, or whatever excuse Sherlock might have given.
Because she’ll question him, push him until he actually verbalises it, making it real. And then he needs to do something about it.
None of the things she says about him are true, can’t be true, because he’s a pathetic excuse of a human being who’s failed her. A
“During our first session, this time around, you told me that you lacked structure, everything was-” she looks briefly at her notes. “-‘a chaos’.”
Harry snatches up the jug, goes to the window. The windowsill is full of seedlings covered by plastic bottles cut in half. She lifts the bottles one by one, watering the plants.
John buys a toastie wrapped in a napkin, and has managed to eat it all by the time they reach the lift.  He really is a sloppy, but effective eater.  He's dabbing his mouth for crumbs, as Sherlock pushes the top floor button.  John's phone pings in tune with the doors when the lift stops.
The train is nearly deserted, the ride smooth.  The darkness outside makes it quite meaningless to look out the window.  Sherlock opts to study John's reflection instead, until John meets his eyes there.  There is a brief flare of panic before he decides it's better to keep his eyes closed.  It would not do well to let John know just how much he is observed by Sherlock.  At best, it would make him wary.  At worst, it would completely unnerve him and garner a fight or flight response.  Sherlock admits, only to himself of course, that his study of John Hamish Watson has increased exponentially in the months since Baskerville.  Sherlock was not wrong when he said he had only one friend, and that friendship becomes more dear, more
"Look, a geode!"  He tilts it, and the sunlight reveals a sparkling core.  "A flint nodule with quartz crystals inside.  Beautiful."
He stands outside her door, feeling nervous. She must be retired by now, so the chances are good that she’s at home at this hour. Will he still be welcome after so many years of silence?
Any chair forgotten in an upright position is pushed around by Rosie, to be used as a ladder to higher levels.
Did John read this wrong? Read all the little tells that Sherlock has been letting slip over the weeks?
John needs to get closer, but there’s not enough space left on the fucking desk; he’ll tip Sherlock over the desk edge if he follows his impulse to climb on top of him. He abruptly lets go. Sherlock draws in a sharp breath, staring at him, eyes narrowing, regarding John suspiciously. John looks at his hands; they’d been clenched in Sherlock’s hair, leaving his curls ruffled and wild, looking a bit like a mad scientist.
John's inspecting his work so far, frowning a bit.  He brings out the shaving gel bottle again and proceeds to apply some more.  "Relax your jaw."  He takes a hold of Sherlock's chin to counteract the razor's motion, shaving the divot between lower lip and chin.  "What I was trying to say..."  He hesitates, licks his lips, starts again.  "When Irene faked her death, you seemed affected.  And then, after everything, when she disappeared for good, you kept her phone."
“But you were,” Sherlock looks incredulous. “That’s why I only risked marginal damage. With you out of the equation the risk level would rise to high.”
“I hit him, Harry. I hit him hard. I don’t know where it came from, all this rage. It was like that time when you told Mum that uncle Joe had tried to- And Mum made us swear to never tell Dad, because he’d have beaten his own brother to death. That kind of rage, which we all knew he had within him. I subjected Sherlock to that kind of rage. Without justifiable reason.”
"Mr Holmes. This has nothing to do with my hair," Wendy Badu says levelly.  "I'm here to stop the insanity.  To give the allotments a chance.  The cost of hiring a professional removal firm would do a lot of damage to this community.  Since Brian won't be around to fight it anymore, I need to do my part.  It was my bloody stupid idea, and I want to try to make things right."
He finally settles on putting it on the hand in the glass cloche on the shelf behind the telly. It’s very fitting, and off-putting enough to make John not go near it. And if he asks for it, Sherlock can truthfully say it’s in safe hands.
An impressive number of rides have been squeezed in at the wide pier-head: roller coasters, bouncy castles, dodgems, a helter-skelter and an old-fashioned carousel.  They pause near the Horror Hotel ride, watching people load into small cars, only to be whisked away into the dark building.  Sherlock is mildly amused for what passes as 'horror' these days.
And then Sherlock does something that John would never have anticipated: he turns his full attention on John, dismissing the case, at least for the moment. He turns and sits cross-legged on the desk, placing his hands atop his knees, waiting. When John doesn’t move, he arches a brow.
"Excuse the sogginess of these.  I forgot about them before.  It seems the ocean has a certain way of lulling you into oblivion."
"Now?" asks John, incredulous.  What restaurant would be open, let alone serving food at half-past one in the morning?
When they've sorted through everything, the table is filled with neat rows of piles dating from March last year until a few weeks ago, and John's filled his notebook with matching columns with subsections of shop names.
"Still, I want to know if there's something wrong with the asparagus.  Since the pickles were clearly homemade, we need to rule out the possibility that something went wrong in the process."
"Oi, leave off," John grumbles goodnaturedly.  "You're not that much younger than me, you poncy twat."
He ends up sitting in the shower, sniffing a half full, half forgotten bottle of Herbal Essences, crying quietly, trying to not wake up Rosie. He doesn’t even know what he’s crying for. For the cracked facade that revealed a former assassin? For searching for something that he never truly wanted, and the emptiness and desperation when it wasn’t there anymore? For the terrifying thought of starting from scratch?
- though children don’t have a higher intrinsic value than adults - and it made the manager worry: ’If something happens, if there is’ - against all probability - ‘an accident, who will be responsible?’ Well of course it’s the manager who will be held accountable, and that’s where it starts - in fear.”
It's easy to locate the direction of the sea.  Everything seems to slant downwards.  They eschew the broad main street and instead wander slowly through a quirky, bohemian area.  There's an overall small scale picturesque quality to the narrow streets.  They pass colourful facades and murals, and a large number of coffee shops, with an air of artistry and inclusivity.
He bites down into Sherlock’s trapezius muscle and pulls lightly on his balls. Sherlock gasps and bucks. John uses the thumb of his other hand to tease a nipple. He licks softly over the bitten flesh, the other hand playing gently with Sherlock’s balls. He bites and pulls again and Sherlock moans. He licks and teases. He repeats the bite, sucking hard. Sherlock’s voice rumbles deep.
John stays in the bathroom, keeping one hand on the doorknob and the other worrying his jeans clad thigh. Sherlock worries he’s going to close the door again. John is equally red-eyed, but he's smiling, eyes bright and alive.
Her death was brutal and seemed so unnecessary after the last remnant of A.G.R.A. was shot dead in Morocco. She didn't have to run anymore. She came home.
It's hard work, even for Sherlock, to walk on the pebble beach.  They seek out the packed, solid areas, but every so often the ground gives away and their feet slide on the rolling pebbles.  They constantly need to counteract the imbalance to keep from slipping.
“I know. Not- not for long, I promise. I just- I need to make a reservation. And take care of a couple of things. A week tops?”
"I don't know if you've been informed about Mr James' clothing when he was found?" John asks.  "If we presume he ignored the symptoms too long, he'd start to suffer from confusion as well as impaired judgement and memory.  That might explain his state of undress.  This is merely speculation, but I can imagine a scenario where he was confused and also affected by the heat, so he went out in the garden for some reason that he might have forgotten.  So, he ended up in the shed, where the ensuing stupor forced him to sit down.  Since he was alone in the shed, out of sight, there was no one there to call an ambulance for him.  Sadly, this is the best explanation I can give you.  I'm very sorry for your loss, Miss Badu."
“Well, my grandpa was a military man. So my dad was about to follow when he had an accident during his military training. A grenade detonated too close, so he lost his hearing on one ear. Which made him seem more impolite than he was. He always seemed pleasant enough - publicly - but sometimes people thought he was ignoring them when they were only talking to him from the wrong side of his head. Anyway, he ended up working in a factory where he had to wear ear-protection all the time and no-one could hear each other above the sound of the machines. I wanted to do better than that, if only to spite him.”
He needs to say what he’s been preparing for, all the long night with John away in Chelmsford and him sleeping with Rosie on the sofa. He clears his throat.
John really doesn’t like the feeling of regret. So he picks up his phone and, although his heart flutters nervously, he sends a text. He has to try at least.
Then came the usual morning routine, with Mary running water in the bath, himself seated with the paper and a cup of tea in the kitchen, eventually packing the lunch box. The familiarity of a farewell hug, the scent of Mary's damp hair in a towel, the warmth of a kiss on the cheek. It was all so very comforting, making his doubts seem like ingratitude.
Sometimes, when they fell asleep on the sofa in front of the telly, and John woke up to hours of insomnia at half past two, blaring lights all still on, and the telly had shut itself off - those times he felt that emptiness, as if he existed in a distant dream, a non-state.
That settles it.  John acquiesces and they meet in a somewhat unbalanced kiss, where Sherlock is keen and passionate, while John is a bit slow to answer with the same fervour, seemingly dumbstruck by the sudden shift.
Every other experience he’s had with other men was hidden, secretly or anonymously, covered by darkness and intoxication. Snogging, hand-jobs. He’s received a few blowjobs, but only given one when he was thoroughly smashed.
John peers through the foliage, trying to get a glimpse of the flowers, but it's too dense.  "Um, I don't really get how they're connected.  You said maybe Miss Cushing had put her house on the market--do you mean someone wants to make her lose money?"
Sherlock looks smug.  His phone buzzes and the smugness increases.  "It closed twenty-eight minutes ago.  How about some meze, instead?"
The weather has turned since the sunny morning hours.  There is something sinister building up out at sea, but so far it's still sunny.  There will probably be a thunderstorm within hours, but John doesn't care.
The room is a bit kidney shaped, with three open showers in a recess. It’s flowing, curving and sparsely lit, a beautiful blue-green mosaic covering the walls, floor and seating benches. The benches are curved with high reclining backrests, that follows the curve of the room, creating separate niches.
Sherlock lights his cigarette as they walk around a bit, slowly approaching the parapet.  He notices John dawdling and turns back to him to find out what's wrong.
"You," John says, holding back, but clearly exasperated, "-are a complete dickhead."  And then there's that crooked smile.  "Ah, Sherlock."  John sighs, shaking his head, pinching the bridge of his nose.  Then looks up at him, smiling.  "You're no different from any lover of mine."
--dull, unoriginal name."  He smirks as he holds aloft several receipts.  "She definitely loves Jamaican and West Indies flavours--she's visited
Before Lestrade can respond, there's a commotion behind the screen outside of the door.  Angry voices.  Lestrade disappears around the screen and comes back in an instant.
For the first time ever he cries in a therapy session, quietly, a hand shielding his eyes. It feels odd, exposing.
“What’s really detestable is when you see a family, where the mother’s already pregnant with the next child, they have a toddler running around and
"Of course.  Not close friends, but he was a good egg.  He kept mostly to himself.  He used to help Miss Cushing with the lawn and other stuff.  And, he's spent a lot of time here at the allotment.  I think he started gardening once he retired."
She and John had struck up a relatively smooth path of renewed friendship. She’d invited him to concerts. It wasn’t John’s usual music taste, but he appreciated the raw energy, so he actually chose Straight Edge concerts over med student parties a few times.
“Well, when I sneeze it’s repeatedly. Maybe eight to ten sneezes in one go. And I have a runny nose and feel a bit off.”
"Still none of your business."  She crosses her arms and glares at Sherlock.  "I need to see those letters."
He came to partly resent her for it, because of the strain it put on him, to be the perfect kid, the normal one, especially after she came out. He was a coward then. Didn’t dare to stand up with her. Secretly admired her defiance, her refusal to be anything but herself.
"I used to come up here to have a smoke."  Sherlock nods in the direction of the stairway.  "No disturbances, only the whirr and rumble of ventilation units, and the sounds of the city.  As peaceful as it gets."
Sherlock shoves his hand deep into the plethora of small stones.  As a whole, they seem light brown, but the individual pebbles are of an endless variety of shades, from greys to rusty browns.  Some are almost black, some have white traces of chalk.  All are pleasantly rounded from the constant erosion of sea water, some broken in half, but the edges, with time, all smoothed out.  Creamy-white, broken and eroded shells, are intermingled with the pebbles.
Sherlock opens his eyes. His face contorts and his body tenses up. When he cries out, John swallows that sound, plunges his tongue deep inside, feeling his finger being clenched in pulses and the soft wash of sperm covering his hand. They’re still, panting into each others mouths. John doesn’t dare to move.
John returns, having bought a simple foldable compact backpack, in lightweight black fabric with an ugly logo.  He's put the lunch wares in it, and now he stuffs it with his coat too.  He notices Sherlock's stare.  "Got to look like a proper tourist when in Brighton."  He squints against the bright sunlight and smiles. "You should buy yourself some cheap sunglasses, and you'll fit right in."
Molly tries to keep a smile from emerging.  "I, um... I let the jar make some rounds in the canteen after you left."
Sherlock doesn’t answer this. He just watches John with a peculiar expression, lips slightly parted.
Once, he tried out the casual touch. On his wedding day. After Sherlock had poured his heart out - a heart John could never get a grip on, only sometimes glimpsed between all the seemingly sociopathic antics.
He kisses her wet brow, making a twirl on the way to the nursery which elicits a smile. She reaches for the mobile hanging above the nursing table, babbling a bit as he rubs her dry.
John let his knuckles brush along his cheek and Sherlock closes his eyes. John tucks a stray curl behind Sherlock’s ear and cups his jaw, stroking that lovely warm skin with his fingers. Sherlock swallows hard, and John can hear his breath stutter when John tilts his face towards him. Sherlock’s eyes are still closed, but there’s a pained expression on his face.
Either way, John is now determined to remind him. For all that John can’t get the words out, at least he can show Sherlock that this isn’t temporary. This isn’t inebriation.
Pretty alluring stuff for people like us. Only thing is, you have to lie a bit to yourself to be able to do it.”
"You mean she lied to your face?" John sounds sceptical.  "Even when you practically raged at her?  I don't think she's smarmy enough to pull that off."
. The guilt is still there, though.  Stronger in the middle of the night after a few too many brandies.  "I've overstepped," he manages, his voice quavering.  "I'm pushing you for things you're not ready to share, while all I really want is to not be left out.  That's what's important to me."  He sniffs and wipes at his eyes.  "The rest is irrelevant."
“He seems very thirsty and suddenly drinks a lot more. There’s more pee than usual in his nappies. What if he’s got diabetes?!”
He drags the tip of his nose down along Sherlock’s sweat-slicked neck. He wants to make him shiver, but that should be impossible in this heat.
“Don’t blame the rubbish collectors. It’s the aphids who absorb sap proteins from the leaves and produce honeydew dripping down. Sometimes it ferments by natural yeast on the leaves, but bees collect it anyway and then they end up drunk.”
"You've wrapped your hair," Sherlock observes.  "A damp cotton wrap to prevent the synthetic weave in your braids from melting by the heat of the flames.  I bet you scorched your hair last time, when you lost control of the fire.  If you'd remove that wrap, I'd see some melting."
She’s suddenly on the step below him, gripping his shoulders with both hands, so he worries ash will burn his arm. She stares intently into his eyes.
Someone had done that once before. Or so he’d thought. Which was cutting in an indescribable way. The doubt. The possibility that he’d imagined it all - the prospect of love, the unspoken emotional reciprocity. And that it all had ended in disaster.
"I am trying," says John, making a long, slow sweep over the area near Sherlock's ear, "to have a perfectly normal conversation with my best friend."
Sherlock doesn’t answer. The blood flowing out of him is hot, but he’s getting increasingly colder under John’s hands.
“No, I’m sure it won’t. Why bother with permissions. But, please, can you just check that Mrs Turner’s tenants aren't allergic. Wouldn’t be good to see one of them in anaphylactic shock with no Epi pen available. I bet you can do some sneaky detective work to figure that out.”
"Miss Badu was quite forward, though slightly annoyed about the late hour, when I first started to talk to her."
“You’re ridiculous,” John laughs and closes his eyes. If he hadn’t been so thoroughly warmed up, his shoulder would probably have protested from lying down on the firm dais. Now he feels ready for a nap.
"Well, who caused it, then?  You wouldn't be out here sneaking around in the dark unless there was some foul play to discover."
He’s grateful to have helped John strap it on a few times in the past, but it’s still a struggle since Rosie currently is contrary to everything. He eventually manages to strap her on, tummy to tummy, but she’s rubbing her tear-streaked cheeks against his chest, soaking his shirt, and straining against the carrier, bringing up her feet as she tries to get leverage on Sherlock to stand up.
Luckily, John had been drinking quite a bit by that time, or else he never would have been able to touch Sherlock that casually or let his hands stay on his shoulder, squeezing a bit, as if that gesture held no significance.
He doesn't know much about gardening, but he's pretty sure, in more rural areas, one is supposed to burn the fallen leaves after raking them into piles, or something like that.  Yes, it's definitely too early in the season; most of the trees haven't even changed yet.
"Sherlock, listen to me."  John searches Sherlock's eyes.  "Not every case coming your way is related to Moriarty.  Though, I'm sure that's what he'd want you to believe, just so he can mess with your head.  I know that verdict was a blow, but you need to get a grip.  Now.  Even when we first came out to Croydon, I saw that you were slipping.  That's why I wanted us to get out of town for a bit.  I saw you lying curled up on the couch in 221B for days on end.  When Irene Adler disappeared the first time, Mycroft and I agreed on you accepting one,
"When Miss Cushing retrieved the letters from the cupboard under the stairs, I happened to see there were rows and rows of jars with pickles of some kind.  Homemade, unlabelled.  And a couple of bags of empty glass jars."
"My eyesight isn't as good as it once was, so I never really look at my receipts.  I've only continued to bring them back home out of habit," Miss Cushing says, slowly gathering her things.  "Then, when I pack up my groceries, they go straight in the bin."
John hit back against it. It felt no different from punching the bullies in the schoolyard. Not one of his proudest moments.
"Don't forget to put out the candles," she says.  "I don't want a surprise call from the Fire Brigade.  And no shagging!"  She carefully presses the keys into Sherlock's outstretched bandaged hand.
He makes his way to the sauna, puts the basket on the shelf, and peeks in through the glass door. It’s already occupied by two retirees. He doesn’t like the idea of initiating any conversation of importance with people listening in.
Maybe he shouldn’t have argued that hard last time they saw each other. He should refrain from creating unnecessary conflict in matters where he and John have opposing beliefs. But he’d missed him, missed him to the point that his company wasn’t enough, that he just
"Ah, vaguely.  No, she's not dead," Sherlock says reassuringly. "But one of her tenants is.  Look up exactly what she wrote while I dress!"
John is so very touched when he realises what it is. He needs to rest his head in his hands and breathe, breathe. Sherlock comes to him and embraces him from behind.
"Right, so this stack from January to March has sixteen from Tesco Express, nine from Sainsbury's Local, two Lidl's and only one from Waitrose," Sherlock says as he points to each set.  "And then there's a few more from the bakery."
John reaches the landing. The woman stands in the open door, arms folded across her chest, dressed in a nightgown and a silk scarf wrapped around her hair. She's clearly ready to go to bed, and not at all in the mood for a chat with an obnoxious, dubious-looking nutter.
John laughs. At least there’s one area where Sherlock is inadequate. Sherlock’s brow furrows in confusion.
She stares at him. All his thoughts slow to a crawl due to the distraction provided by her very familiar eyes. Frowning, she draws in her breath, clearly about to ask him something, and just like that, Sherlock finds his voice.
John drops the phone on his desk and covers his face with his hands. He feels weak and ashamed. He longs to see Sherlock and he dreads it. He’s made such a fool of himself.
"The floor was concrete, admittedly with some significant cracks, but none wide enough to hide anything substantial.  Only some weeds growing in."  He quirks an eyebrow at John.  "Maybe we should have dug it out?  Hacked away at the floor to find this '
Harry turns on the extractor fan over the stovetop and pulls her chair close to the stove. She lights a cigarette and sits down on the chair, backwards, leaning forward with one arm over the backrest, the other hand effortlessly holding the cigarette within range of the fan to catch the rising curls of smoke.
Sherlock notes the tell-tale signs of a bad day at work: hair a bit ruffled, jacket unbuttoned, thrown on in a hurry, fists clenched until his knuckles are white. Clearly, John is upset, but Sherlock can’t quite make out what’s going on in his face. He looks devastated, but also ready to pick a fight. Sherlock can’t make sense of this.
And now he’s walking on a familiar street, her street. It feels like walking home. And why shouldn't it? That’s what she’s always been to him, a home. A home he hasn’t visited in years.
"Now, I see you're thinking that's a bit odd, and we're a peculiar bunch residing in this house.  But, this has been going smoothly for more than fifteen years, and we respect each other's privacy.  Once in a while, I let them inside my flat to use the kitchen, since their rooms only have kitchenettes, and I don't mind the company.  However I don't ever go into their rooms, unless there's a maintenance problem of some kind.  My tenants trust me, and I trust them, mind you.  I've happily left my key with Brian, in case he'd need the oven, when I've been staying at my sister's."
And John Watson walks out of their flat, forgetting his coat. Sherlock feels a bit unmoored by this conversation and its abrupt end. What the hell is John thinking?
"At my age, the bodily decline can stand in the way of being taken seriously, I'm afraid," she says, paying no heed to Sherlock's request.
It's a rare moment, but John is certain that Sherlock is nervous about the answer.  Or shy, he's never quite sure when it comes to Sherlock's more unreadable expressions.  "It's an, um, a special interest of mine, since a young age."
She looks away, shifting her feet, as if she might feel contrite, but John doesn't believe in such fast changes of conduct.  Still, he tries to relax and goes for levity:
Sherlock's phone buzzes again, and this time, he's ready to actually throw it away.  He fishes it out of his pocket and glances at it.  Two missed calls and one text.  All from Lestrade.  "John.  It seems we have an arsonist to deal with."
"I will never keep anything important from you, ever again, if I can possibly help it," Sherlock declares. John looks about to protest, so he barrels on, "I can't promise I'll always get it right and know what's important. But I swear, I will do my best to be completely, utterly, eternally transparent with you."
They can’t have been old, early primary school? It must have been when Catherine’s friend Dorothy lived in the bedroom upstairs. He’s got a vague memory of her sewing doll clothes for Harry’s tiny fairy dolls out of the polyester petals of artificial flowers. They used to live among the long stalks of the lilies.
He made it out of the bullying situation by pummeling other kids in the school yard, until threatened with suspension. At that point, a very wise teacher, dearest Ted, prompted him to try out for the rugby team. Obviously to give John an opportunity to be rough and physical within clearly regulated limits.
John blinks, reluctant to let his gaze leave the horizon, clearly not in case mode.  "Oh.  Really?"  He glances at Sherlock, standing very much in his personal space.  "About what?"
When they’re admitted inside the treatment room, they’re already soaked, especially Sherlock in his towel creation.
“It’d been a crazy day. That’s usually all fun and games with Sherlock. A little dangerous excitement. But not this time. I hated how he’d made light of addiction, never recognising the severity. But I didn’t intervene. Let him shoot up in a public bathroom. Followed him on a crazy case. It was all
“No. He won’t listen once he’s set his mind to something. Basically I stay around, ready to intervene, do something drastic.”
, his irrational fear of Sherlock being an actual sociopath. His fear of falling apart, losing control of his demeanour.
"No, and we assume his doctor didn't either," says John, sympathetically.  "Mr James died of an aneurysm, caused by a severe case of hypertension.  We believe an hypertensive emergency was brought on by his medication in combination with him eating a lot of pickles.  It's fatal without immediate intensive care treatment."
"No need," says Sherlock.  "Anyone with access to Miss Cushing's flat had access to all her keys.  You might want to check for fingerprints, though.  Because, contrary to the letters, this has
She catches it effortlessly, eyes narrowed.  "It's half past midnight and I want you out of here, right now," Sally commands.  "How did you even get in here?"
Sherlock sighs, but seems to be amused.  "Good riddance," he mutters, giving the stubble a final scratch.
They hear a sudden thump and the stems towards the garden starts to sway.  "Bloody hell... feckin' weed," says a familiar voice.  Then the young innkeeper steps into the pathway and startles as he sees them.
"Fall down, fall over, fall asleep, fall for someone, American autumn, a fall from grace, a fallen angel.
The train ride is relatively short and efficient. They’re surrounded by tired commuters. John doesn’t ask what kind of expertise Sherlock thinks he can provide. They definitely don’t talk about what happened when they last met.
However, old habits are hard to break. It’s not like they throw love declarations around every day. But this - experimental tugs of locks, answering gasps, breathing into each other’s mouths - it requires a high level of non-verbal communication. This is part of their language now. Their love declaration.
"Yes?" Sherlock breathes, standing his ground.  His phone buzzes again, and he's inclined to pick it up just to throw it deep into the shrubbery.
One was Ted, his teacher. For some reason, he’s managed to keep in contact with Ted and his wife Stella, through med school and beyond, through his years of deployment in Afghanistan. And now, they’ve been his most reliable overnight babysitters since he went to Morocco to retrieve his wife. They don’t know the entirety of Mary’s story, but they’ve been incredibly supportive none the less.
Always assuming the worst about him. Always thinking he’s a righteous, small-minded bigot, looking down on her and her shady acquaintances. He reminds himself to breathe. This is an exercise as good as any of those Ella has recommended. He relaxes his grip on the steering wheel and schools his mind before speaking, calmly.
"You whispered in my ear, you wanted my perspective on the case," John offers, a bit of desperation in his voice.  "You wanted me to show off my shooting skills, you wanted me to be in on the hunt of a criminal, even if he never existed--you wanted me
“John, I would like to talk more about this the next time we meet. I think it would be good if we booked another session this week.”
"You're too harsh, Sherlock."  John has returned to the sitting room, amused.  "She's quite an endearing old lady."
Sherlock sticks out his right hand from behind the shower curtain, one of his ziplock evidence bags covering the bandage.  He then sticks out his other hand to dump his pants on the floor, before turning the water on.
During the months of separation, John was as sad as he was angry with her. He had a small hope of reconciliation, and anyway, it was the only proper thing to do, seeing as she was expecting his baby.
The young man brings in the dessert, then quickly returns with a new candle for their table, as the other has burnt down and snuffed itself out.
John tries to imbue his voice with kindness as he asks the long-standing question:  "Why do you need to be alone?"
The following wailing makes Sherlock want to help the boy follow his cap over the railing.  "Completely predictable development."
"Either way, I want to be sure there's no lethal additions.  Pickled asparagus doesn't usually warrant to be burned in a futile attempt to conceal it's content," Sherlock says.  "John."  He indicates one of his coat pockets.  John sticks his hand in there, finding a zip bag.  He pulls it open for Sherlock to gingerly lower the jar into it and then zips it up.
“It’s not easy to change behaviour when you’re older. I realise that. But now, I can see how important relationships are. Without therapy, I would have felt your sobriety was another reminder of how I’ve failed you. And I would have been glad for you, but wouldn’t have kept up contact. I would have let it all slide, again.”
John gets up to collect the bamboo canes they found in the shed, and Harry brings out the cord she found in Catherine’s craft box with macrame supplies. Harry shows John how to prune the tomato plants, and they stick the bamboo canes into the ground and bind up the plants against them with macrame cord.
His flirting with E had been as much attention seeking and ego licking as it was a test of Mary's commitment. She was
John reddens slightly, so Sherlock abandons his fag and kisses him again.  And again, pulling him downwards until they're on their knees, holding onto each other tight.  When John pauses, and draws back a bit, Sherlock can clearly see the dilation of his pupils.  They're not anywhere near the parapet.  There's no danger at all.  Then John pulls him close again, and they're back to snogging, John's tongue in his mouth.  It's all a rush of nicotine and hormones surging through him, making him stupid and malleable--and he loves it.
John grabs Sherlock's elbow, trying to steer him away from Miss Badu to prevent further escalation.  "Yeah, and one of the people living here is dead.  Now, cut the shite and go pick up your coat--we're leaving."
Eventually Sherlock stops to examine the wall of an extension of the building. He crouches, then turns a brilliant smile to John.
"That's true," says Sherlock.  "Most parts of the plant are edible: young shoots, growing tips of larger plants and unfurled leaves on the stalk and branches.  It contains large amounts of health beneficial substances such as Vitamin C and Resveratrol."
“Oooh, this is clever!” He gives John a sly smile, pointing at a seemingly insignificant newspaper clip on the wall.
The fire brigade has, of course, stomped all over the lawn, leaving a mottle of footprints in the mud created by the mass of water used to put out the fire.
He blows his nose and is suddenly unsure of where to put away his snotty tissue. Ella discreetly sticks her toes under the table and pushes out a small rubbish bin.
John clicks his torch on to light up the pathway to their right.  He directs the light downward, holding the torch low to the ground to not give away their presence, and that's when he sees it: small ruddy sprouts peeking out through the gravel, in a very dense formation.  He lets his torch follow the direction of their growth, and sees that the stretch of grass alongside the path is infested too, the stalks higher.  The very foliage surrounding them is the same plant.  It looks like someone has been trying to cut the stems down, and now a new generation of sprouts are taking over.  The hedge-like form they're hiding behind is man-high.  John is starting to grasp the extent of the problem.  He clicks off his torchlight.
John presses his lips together, his temper rising by the second and he can’t, doesn’t want to, subdue himself.
"Right."  She studies him for a moment, then turns her back to him and puts her hands on her hips, sighing as she takes in the room.
"I'm a consulting detective, working with Inspector Lestrade who's in charge of this investigation."
He’s booked treatments for them as well, in case bathing in pools and steam rooms aren’t enough to make them relax. It’s very possible that it’s only John who feels the need to relax.
“Because you’re stubborn as hell. When you decide you’re in for something, you’re hellbent on following through. And the vague promise of
There’s something off with the tear, where Sherlock pulled the first stitch out. There’s no scab. It hasn’t started healing. It’s a small tear, but there seems to be fluid oozing out. No, it’s blood. It’s dark red, almost black, deep down in the tear, but it rises to the surface and starts dripping.
“So you consider treating me to a spa day as suitable atonement?” Sherlock turns over too, his bent legs still long enough to end up in John’s chair, bumping his knees. “I’m not disagreeing, if it works for you, then it’s good, very good. I’m just saying, to me it’s unneeded. I forgave you long ago. If I still had an issue with it, do you really think I’d ask you to move in with me?
"No, Sherlock," he says sharply, but with restraint. "That's it.  You're done interacting with people for today."
Sherlock huffs.  He knows what's bothering him, stealing his focus: his preoccupation with Moriarity's next move... and the worry that John might come to harm.  But he'd rather not tell John.  Instead, he shows John the picture Lestrade sent.
John enlarges the picture with his index finger and thumb.  "Yeah," he says, absently, as he studies the picture.  "Bloody hell, he must've gone off them years ago.  I bet his doctor didn't know he stopped taking them long before the prescription ended."
