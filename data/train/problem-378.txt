Twelve
"Now?" Victoria nods and smiles. "Yes, of course. Now," Sherlock says, and she only realizes after she is returning from Victoria's home that one: Victoria only let her walk her home so that she could carry everything and two: Sherlock walked out on the job. Oh no. She runs back to the store.
"Mm," he responds with an overly exaggerated smile. He doesn't like her, she's well aware and returns the sentiment whole-heartedly. It works, somehow. He slides out of the car and walk up to the door with a small wave to John through the car window. His fingers fumble with the keys but he gets into the flat and Mary drives away. He makes it up the stairs and has just flopped onto to the sofa with a loud groan when Mrs. Hudson enters with a thunderous but relieved look on her face.
Sherlock straightens her dress and grips the limp, and, frankly, pathetic, flowers tighter. She turns her face up towards the window with a smile when she hears it creek open. Three blonde girls poke their heads out, all chattering and giggling, which abruptly stops when they see Sherlock.
He moves to sit beside Sherlock, who is nervously fiddling with his phone, eyes on the door where Mary is. John bounces his leg anxiously and taps his fingers on the armrest of his chair. A particularly loud shriek from Mary makes them both wince.
Mycroft pauses, and Sherlock can hear a faint voice, abnormally high, in the background during his silence. "England."
He forces himself to buckle his seat belt before looking back at John. He stands upright beside Mary, the contrasting colors of red and black, and something in Sherlock's stomach twists at the sight of their hands entwined. He sits back, putting the two of them out of sight, and the plane takes off as his stomach drops, and not just from the plane's movements.
"Well, I- that is," she gestures to the flowers in her hand, "I was wondering if-"
Victoria puts a finger to her chin and says, "No, but you can walk me home."
"Sir," the man says. Sherlock looks away from the window as he continues. "It's your brother." He resists the temptation to roll his eyes- Mycroft wont even leave him alone while he's trying to die- and takes the phone.
Mary is tense beside him. He brushes her elbow with a finger. "Okay?" he asks. He's mostly worried about the baby, his only feelings towards Mary at this point is strained indifference.
glad you're home," she says, voice thick, and Sherlock's vision fogs a bit.
Sherlock feels adrift in sensation, of John's hand on his jaw, in his hair, John's thin lips against his own full ones, John's breath hitting his cheek, and he gasps out a sob. John immediately stops the kiss, and Sherlock makes a small sound in the back of his throat.
"John," he tries to chide, before giggling along with him wrapping his arms tightly around John's shoulders and hiding his face in the crook of his neck.
John interrupts him by grabbing Sherlock's hand where it's clutching the hem of the cardigan and squeezing gently, and Sherlock flushes again and shuts his mouth.
But John, John would feel guilty about it- wouldn't he?- or he'll think of him differently, with disgust-
, this is the
"Oh, I think it could work," Sherlock murmurs quietly, and John turns and smiles at him. Sherlock returns it- or tries to at least- only managing a small smile that fades almost as soon as it appears.
you probably know exactly what I'm going to say." John laughs and it's strained. "I just. You. You know. How I feel about you. I mean. You're my best friend. And I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to disrupt that in. Any way. Or..." John stares into the fire. Sherlock's eyes widen as he finally allows himself to deduce John.
- Sherlock -
- has John ever smiled this much in his presence, let alone
, My' ?" Sherlock asks, jerking her arm out  of Mycroft's grip and looking up at him.
- , and the courage that he's just managed to gather seeps away, leaving him cowardly and cold. He goes with the first thing that comes to mind to take the serious edge off; just to see John smile again, smile because of
"Now, you are coming down with me to my flat, and I'm fixing you a proper meal, no arguing." Mrs. Hudson stands and matches down the stairs, Sherlock behind her.
John shakes his head. "
Things happen quickly after that.
, this must be what Sherlock feels like all the time. John almost gives into the temptation to kiss him senseless right then and there, but he stops himself. He's still with Mary, if only legally. He decides that he'll get the papers tomorrow.
i'm going to try and update this fic once a week (on tuesdays)! i already have chapters 3 and 4 written and i know where i'm going with the rest of them so this will buy me time. thank you for reading!!

"Sherlock, slow down!" Mycroft shouts. He races after the ridiculously quick five year old as she moves towards The Wall. She manages to jump over the gap, Mycroft on her heels, and they get to the tree line before Mycroft finally snags Sherlock's arm and pulls her to a stop. "We're not supposed to cross The Wall, Sherlock, you know this!"

Holmes scoffs. "I did not

"Why would you ever think that something is wrong, my dear Watson?" Watson sits beside him on the couch.

"That is the same thing," Watson says as he passes behind Holmes and into the sitting room.
and thoughtless and sociopathic as Sherlock. He stares off into the middle distance with the [Mary] voice inside his head poking and proding at Sherlock's weak spots. He feels tears well up again and grabs a pillow to hide his face in.
John spends the next few hours worrying over Sherlock. He's fidgeting and pacing and running his hands through his hair and eventually Mary kicks him out. He goes to Tesco, wanders around, and leaves empty-handed. He sits at a coffee shop, buys a pastry, and only ends up eating about a third of if before he throws it in the trash and makes up his mind.
"No its- fine," John assures him, and smiles
Sherlock stands on the street outside of Victoria's house. She straightens her dress and smiles up where Victoria will appear. Victoria sticks her head out and sighs when she sees Sherlock.
John keeps staying at Baker Street. After the drugs are finally out of Sherlock's system they stay up late, night after night, talking for
, Watson. I was simply. Knocked unconscious," he says, turning his nose up a bit.
"Soon," is all John says in return.
John meets his eyes and smiles at him. "We're almost at the hospital. You might want to stay awake for a bit." Sherlock opens his mouth the whine but John cuts him off with a look. Sherlock slumps back into his seat with a pout and stares out the window. John smiles fondly at him and catches Mary looking at him oddly. He turns and looks out of his own window, avoiding her knowing stare.
"Yes, uh. Yes, it is. Still free. Yes."
"John," he says quietly as he turns around, voice cracking embarrassingly.
They eventually stumble into Sherlock's room. They're both chuckling as they crawl under the covers and John settles on his side and just. Looks. Sherlock looks back.
Sherlock breaks the kiss when he remembers to breath-
Sherlock places everything on the counter and asks, "May I perhaps. See you tonight?"
"John! Oh, well- She was- well, you see, she started crying and I- You were in the shower and I thought-" he stammers as John moves towards him.
going to see this, so he goes easy on himself, storing it away into his mind palace to be examined on this flight to his death, to be remembered and
He sits down hard on the sofa and scrubs at his face again.
John comes to Baker Street, but today he's got a small suitcase, a diper bag overflowing with clothes and toys, and a baby carrier. Sherlock rushes to help him with the bags and gets him inside the flat.
Sherlock drifts awake, eyes flying to the clock on the wall even as he rubs the crust out of his sore eyes. It's fifteen minutes past. John hasn't been home though, there's no sign of his coat having hung on the peg or his keys having arrived on the side table by his chair. Sherlock tries to get rid of the tear tracks on his face as he looks for some sign that John's been home [he's normally very punctual, excited to leave work, excited to see Sherlock] but there's nothing.
They get to the hospital and the doctors rush Mary into the back room, who's screaming bloody murder the whole way. John goes to follow but they shut the door on him. He can't help but feel a little relieved.
"Of course you're n-" he's cut off by a loud snore.
he thinks immediately. It's an exaggeration but its the first thing his mind supplies.
"You will be. You are. You have been, even as a friend. Though, I'm not sure if we were ever truly "just friends", now were we?" Sherlock laughs and John kisses him again. "I love you. And I'm going to love you until we get old together and die, and then I'll love you in the next life, and in the next, and over and over again. In every universe there's going to be us, like this. I swear to you." Sherlock pauses, eyes prickling. Then he rolls onto his back and pulls John on top of him, and hugs him tightly. John hugs him back and says, "I swear to you." Sherlock nods and pulls him in tighter.
the air huffing from out of John's mouth and into his own and-
"I am
"I've only been gone four minutes," he said.
, and pours it into the kiss.
"I'll keep you," she says to Mycroft. Then to Sherlock, "You need to go." She waves her hand and a fine green mist leaves her fingers. The grass and dirt holding both of them down moves back under their shoes. The witch walks towards her and taps her forehead, releasing another cloud of green and says, "There. Now when you cross back over you'll forget that this happened. Five minutes to say goodbye." She leans down and attaches a small chain around Mycroft's ankle, explaining that the chain can't be broken unless she dies, at which she laughs hysterically. Then she turns and walks towards a large yellow cart, tying the other end of the chain to a metal ring on the front, then climbs in the back. Mycroft kneels on the ground and takes out the sheets of parchment that Sherlock had stolen from their father's desk earlier that day. He takes out a pencil and begins scratching out a letter to Sherlock.
Sherlock is reaching for a slide a few minutes later when he spots the cardigan again. He becomes aware that he's only wearing a thin t-shirt and pajama bottoms, and the room is rather cold. He reaches out and tugs the garment closer, slipping it on.
"Ahem. Sherlock." John's eyes flick up and land somewhere above his right eyebrow. "So." He takes a long sip of whiskey, eyes what he's left in the cup, and throws it back as well. Sherlock raises his eyebrows. John sets his glass on the mantle and fiddles with it for a second.
John smiles even wider, and murmurs, "Do you want me to kiss you, Sherlock?" He blushes once again and nods- once, firmly. John's palm slides along his jaw lightly, guiding his face into position and tilts it to the side, and bestows one solid kiss directly onto his mouth. Sherlock can feel John's grin at the end of it, and John backs off with a small smack and Sherlock shivers.
That night, John stays at Mary's again. He tells her that he wants a divorce. She agrees and they talk custody over Rosie. Mary immediately says that she wants full custody of Rosie, that with his and Sherlock's lives there won't be time for baby-raising. They argue and argue for hours and John finally storms out. He comes back an hour later and says they can try or equal custody, and that he'll have nothing less. Then Rosie cries and Mary runs to get her from her crib. Mary walks to the kitchen and agrees to his terms, as John falls asleep on her couch.
John smiles at him again and sets the baby carrier on the sofa. "Watch her for me while I take my things up?" Sherlock nods and watches him ascend the stairs. Then he turns towards Rosie.
"59 missed calls. Mary," John says in a rush, still starring at his phone.
"Sherlock.
"Mycroft."
"Mm? Oh, yes, I'm fine I just. Wanted to." John clears his throat again and looks down, a hand on his hip. He breathes harshly out of his nose. "You. You're so bloody
"What's wrong Holmes?" Watson asks gently, plucking at his sleeve and leading him to the sofa.
“Ok. Off to get my kit. It’s hidden in the hazmat cart, secure in a sealed container so you don’t have to worry about cross contamination and obviously, I’ll be wearing surgical gloves but then, you’ve probably already anticipated that. Be right back,” Sebastian said, giving John’s shoulder a brief pat before he left.
“I doubt it,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock stopped and turned around, looking Moriarty dead in the eyes.
“What’s wrong with him, Seb? He shouldn’t be out already, should he?” Moriarty said with a pout.
“I hope so too. For all of our sakes. A Sherlock in love with a man on paper is an illogical Sherlock.”
“What’s in it,” Sherlock asked, looking not one whit nervously at the bag.
“Yes?”
“You might have to wait in line for that one,” Irene said and disconnected.
“We don’t have time for this. My job is to protect my team and I’m not leaving until everyone’s safely on board. Is Sturges strapped in?” They were now close enough to the helicopter that yelling over the spinning blades was necessary.
The Apiary
“Good acoustics in this alley,” Sherlock commented.
“That’s what happens when you’re new to day drinking, John,” Sherlock replied, linking arms with John as he tried dragging him down the street. He really didn’t want to have to carry this man to his flat.
“There’s something else that you don’t know about me, John.”
“Know what for certain?” Sherlock asked as he entered the flat. He studied the placement of both John and Mrs Hudson’s heads and recognized a conspiracy when he saw one.
Jim had been in a good mood for quite awhile which was unusual. Moran knew that it was due to the addictive properties of John’s blood. It was keeping him happy for a lot longer than was usual but Sebastian didn’t want to see what happened once Jim drained John dry. At least not before he could hunt down another Dhamphir - John wasn’t going to last much longer. They weren’t feeding him and fluids weren’t going to do anything to replace his blood, especially at the rate Jim had been draining John.
“Drugged? What are you talking about? I gave him my coffee by mistake and he decided just to drink it since it was similar to mine. Wait! It had been meant for me! Someone was trying to drug me?! Is someone after me?” Moran asked nervously. God, he was having a good time. He had to admit that this was some of his finest acting.
“Fine but if I wake up all the way, there’s going to be hell to pay,” John said softly.
“And…”
“Well, people will think what they want to think but I don’t want to make a bigger deal out of this than it is…” Watson hedged.
“Neither. I’m completely serious. Since the hospital is waking up, let’s you and I step out for some coffee and talk this over. I have a few things to tell you about yourself that I don’t think you’re aware of,” Sherlock said, standing up.
“Jim. You know that if I can’t fix John, Sherlock’s going to find us and kill us both.”
"Hold on, he said that? That's ridiculous, of course you are." Sherlock smiles and sighs again.
," Watson chides.
"Huh? Oh! Oh, yes, actually, um, I'll just," Sherlock mumbles to himself, mostly, as he steps over the arm rest and curls up next to John, but not touching. John's eyes never leave the screen- he's picked some sort of nature channel- but he brings his arm around Sherlock's shoulders and drags him down against him. Sherlock slides down even more, his head resting in John's lap and his face buried in John's stomach. He sighs quietly as John's fingers begin to comb through Sherlock's hair and he snuggles down into John's lap, beginning to doze off already.
"Its just- John, I." He stops to gather his thoughts.
"I'm not like.
"Someone's over there," Sherlock interrupts, pointing to the trees and Mycroft turns, pulling Sherlock along with him as he moves quickly back towards The Wall. Just a few feet from The Wall, Mycroft's feet get stuck. He looks down and sees the grass moving to cover his boots, effectively trapping him. A woman with frizzy red hair emerges from the trees. She walks over and grabs Sherlock's chin between two long-nailed fingers and turns her head towards her. Sherlock tries jerking away and the woman opens Sherlock's mouth, inspecting her teeth, apparently. When Mycroft goes to hit her, his fist stops in mid-air a foot from the woman's body.
, Sherlock thinks.
confused. Why had Sherlock overdosed? Why had he taken drugs before boarding the plane? What had he meant to say before climbing onto the plane? He wants to take Sherlock away somewhere where they can be alone and Sherlock doesn't have to hide, to shake the answers out of him, reach into his mouth and draw out what had almost escaped before he'd swallowed it away, washing it down with a thin joke.
"Hello John," Sherlock says quietly, eyes flicking up from where his fingers have begun nervously picking at a loose thread with a tiny smile.
"Yes."
"Who told you that? Those are just stories," Mycroft scoffs.
Sherlock nods and stands up. John smiles up at him and Sherlock pulls him up as well, keeping hold of his hands as he takes John's place on the sofa and pulls John on top of him. He shuffles down so that his face is buried in John's chest from beneath, his jumper soft and warm and smelling like John. It's dark too, and he can hear John's heart beating. He wraps his arms under John's armpits and puts his hands over his shoulders, holding him close, and putting his legs around John's waist for good measure.

Sherlock pauses, taking in John's face, seeing the confusion, the sadness, and... hope? He shakes himself mentally; John is married to Mary, he loves Mary, not Sherlock. He takes a steadying breath and starts again. "Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again I might as well say it now." He stares at the ground for a second, gathering up courage to say It. He's been silent for

"Who cares! It's better that way. You are better than him"
"Yes, Watson?"
Sherlock's own eyes close, and he bites his lip softly and opens his eyes. John is looking at him softly, eyes creasing at the corners and his lips stretching into a tentative smile. Sherlock smiles back at him in return, lifting his chin and adverting his eyes.
"There's nothing to tell, m'

He sits, wallowing in The Mood, circulating over everything Bad he's done or said or

"He- hello, Victoria," Sherlock stutters and mentally kicks herself.
" Watson's smile just grows and he picks up the top newspaper from the pile on the floor, flicking it open, blocking Holmes' view. He sighs through his nose, picking up his violin and scratching out a few notes. He stands and paces, holding his violin at his neck but not playing anything. He taps the bow on anything that comes within reach, the desk, an old tea cup, his Persian slipper, empty for now, even Watson's head, at which point the bow is taken out of his hand and the violin is lowered. Watson stands in front of him.
"Didn't want to be. Annoying or.
, you know," Victoria says.
It happens suddenly. He's lying on the sofa, waiting for John to come home from the surgery [3 more hours, his brain helpfully supplies] when The Mood settles on him like an overly heavy, suffocating quilt. It feels like his Belstaf, wrapping around him, but laden with mud, dragging him down and pinning him onto the sofa. It's the armor of his coat but its terrifying; the comfort of concrete beneath his feet then the sudden absence of it. It feels like drowning, like freefalling, and like being crushed all at once.
John clanks around in the kitchen, filling the kettle and setting it on the stove to boil as he leans against the counter and rubs at his eyes with a sigh. Sherlock goes back to scribble notes in his notebook, and is just turning back to his microscope when he feels John beside him. He looks up and to his left, where John is looking down at him with a small smile and he plucks at Sherlock's sleeve.
[pointless, of course. Nothing can be done about it now] and [oh, no, not this] heat rises behind his eyes. He turns his face farther into the crease where the back cushion and the bottom cushions meet as he lets the tears fall. An hour and twenty minutes [fifteen minutes, he'll need time to let the redness leave his face before John sees].
"I love you," he says again. He's spent so much time not saying it that it seems to be the only thing he

"What?" John asks. Sherlock opens his eyes and sees John's concern and knits his eyebrows together.
They do tests, and it's as unpleasant as always, but made ten times worse by John's presence. He doesn't want to have to see John's disappointed face, the lines in his forehead and around his mouth deep groves. He hates himself in this moment, hates Mycroft, too, for bringing him back onto English soil where he has to exist in John's presence when he's like this.
"There's nothing to be sorry for, love. I just want you to be okay. You don't deserve the bad feelings. Only good feelings. Nothing but the best for you. I love you."

"Mm," John says. "Thought so." And he's gone, at the kettle, filling it with water and placing it on the stove. Sherlock stares at him and sets a now-sleeping Rosie back in her carrier, fussing with her as he feels John's eyes burning holes into the back of his skull.
"So do you. And I hope that I can be enough." Sherlock runs his fingers through the short hairs on the back of John's head.
"You lost your job." Father says from the doorway of the kitchen and Sherlock closes her eyes in defeat. "I heard."

"Thank you," John says again. His mouth is still smiling but his eyes are serious. "I mean it. Thank you for saying it when I couldn't." Sherlock moves closer and puts one hand on John's jaw. He considers his answer before he says.
John moves away and Sherlock makes a sound of disapproval. John goes to the couch and sits down, picking up the remote and turning the telly on. Sherlock walks over and stands at the end of the couch, shifting from foot to foot nervously. Did John move away because he wanted to be alone? Would he be okay with Sherlock sitting next to him? What-
"Father told me."
"Okay." Mycroft turns Sherlock towards The Wall with a hand on her shoulder and gives her a little shove. She gets to the wall and turns back. Mycroft waves and Sherlock smiles tightly, then crosses back into Wall.
"John. Open your eyes." John keeps his head down and shakes his head. Sherlock ducks his down and places a tentative hand on John's jaw. John allows his head to be lifted but keeps his eyes squeezed shut and his mouth in a tight, unhappy line. "John," Sherlock whispers. "John. Look at me. Please. I love you. I love you too. Please look at me." John's mouth softens into a small 'o' and his eyebrows lose their sharp edge, sliding upwards. His eyes are still closed and he looks terribly vulnerable so Sherlock kisses him gently, right on his slightly open mouth. John's eyes finally snap open and they are dark blue, wet and red rimmed
"I know, you told me not to come. But I've got a surprise for you!" Victoria turns and shuts the window. "No, Victor- wait!" Sherlock turns around and walks down the street. Suddenly a hand is wrapped around her bicep and and warm body is pressed against her side.
"Hi, Sherlock. How are you feeling?" John asks, smiling back. His anxiety has lessened just from being here with Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock and all that's familiar and
"Are you a witch?" Sherlock asks the woman loudly.

The next day, Sherlock is working at Mr. Monday's Groceries. An old man places to bundles of herbs on the counter and starts to rummage around in his pockets. Sherlock sees wavy blonde hair in the corner of her eye and when she looks up, Victoria's walking towards the counter, ignoring the line.
"Bye Sherlock," Mary sing-songs, and Sherlock has the distinct feeling of being mocked, as he almost always does during any encounter with the woman.
The man in question looks up, with wide eyes and a slightly guilt expression as he sets down the tube of

"Don't you talk to me like that, boy." She goes back to her assessment of Sherlock and Mycroft makes a rude gesture with his hand behind her back and Sherlock snorts.

"Me too," he says, squeezes her a bit. She sits back and takes his face in her hands, smiling wetly at him. She thumbs away the tear that leaks out of his eye and pats his cheek fondly.
in it, and it's so
"How was that?" John whispers teasingly. Sherlock's eyes are still closed- he doesn't even remember closing them in the first place- and he nods once again and pushes forward blindly.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Don't know just. Felt bad. Then you came late and I thought you- thought you were avoiding me, had gotten tired of me." John's hand anchors itself in the curls at the back of his head, pushing his face firmer into John's neck. He leans back, pulling Sherlock with him, until they're both lying on the sofa, Sherlock on top like a blanket.
" he says and John's eyes fall closed and he stiffens. Sherlock blinks at the top of John's head for about thirty seconds before shaking his head and looking at John properly.
She's just woken up, it seems, blinking slowly, squishy face creasing in a big yawn. Sherlock sits next to her and turns the carrier towards him carefully. Rosie smiles and claps her tiny hands at him. Sherlock smiles back and Rosie grasps one of his fingers, immediately popping it in her mouth. Sherlock chuckles and moves his finger around, and Rosie bites at him with her little gums. He pulls his dripping finger out an hits the end of her nose with it, making her stop and blink a few times. He wipes his finger on a corner of the blanket that she's got covering her when John walks back downstairs and heads for the loo.

, but he still manages to look beau- Good. He looks good for how much he must be hurting. The telly is turned down low and Mrs. Hudson has taken off her shoes so that she can make as little noise as possible so as not to overload Sherlock's senses. John does the same an sits in a chair beside Sherlock's place on the sofa, and Mrs. Hudson takes her place next to Sherlock.

John stops, soft jumper brushing Sherlock's bare arm where he'd rolled up his sleeves. John puts a hand on Rosie's head and meets Sherlock's gaze. He smiles and his eyes drop the Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock flushes up again and John's eyes rise, locking with Sherlock's and he
"I know. I know, and I'm sorry that I didn't tell you. I love you. I love you." John squeezes their faces together harder, then turns his head and buries it in Sherlock's neck. Sherlock lets himself be pulled in and John rubs his back and pets his hair and strokes the nape of his neck, more for his own benefit than Sherlock, he suspects.
"Did you... Want to. Sit down maybe?"
"No its not," John says, bringing Sherlock back to the matter at hand- he's leaving London, he's leaving
Their lips meet too hard, and John drops his other hand guides them both to his own waist, where Sherlock grips the soft fabric of John's old army t-shirt. John grabs Sherlock's face and guides them together again, sliding one to the back of his head and gently rubbing circles into his scalp.

." Sherlock flushes and glares at him. Humphrey taps her foot with his walking stick. "Off you go now." Sherlock kicks it away. Humphrey turns and faces her. "Sherlock? Walk. Away." Sherlock just stares harder and picks up a sturdy looking stick and brandishes it like a sword. Humphrey scoffs and shakes his head at the ground, then suddenly strikes at her, catching her off guard. Victoria and her friends all call from the window, and Sherlock regains her footing. About ten seconds later she's landed on her arse with Humphrey's walking stick pressing into her breastbone. She huffs again and stands, smacking the cane out of her way and shoving past Humphrey roughly.
"What are you doing?"
"Because there's magic?" Sherlock asks.
it's actually happening, and John chuckles and Sherlock can
and he wraps it tighter around him.
. And it
"'Morning," John rumbles, breaking Sherlock out of his fantasy and into reality. He looks up and offers John a small smile- he wont be expecting and answer anyway, and Sherlock's not sure that he can trust what would come out of his mouth if he were to speak right now, still caught up in the vision of John's face between his hands, stubble catching on his palms, his breath skittering across his cheeks, the morning sunlight catching the silver in his hair, thin lips twitching up into a soft, tender smile.
"John there's... Something I've meant to say; that I've always meant to say and i never have..."
Leaning forward slowly, as if giving him time to move away, John rests their foreheads together and links the fingers of their free hands together and lifts them to him mouth, eyes closing, and presses one kiss to each of his ten knuckles.
His feet take him to Baker Street on auto pilot, and it's only when John's at the door, his hand raised to knock, when he realizes that he doesn't have an excuse to actually be here. He knocks anyway, swallowing away his panic, and Mrs. Hudson opens the door. She smiles brightly and invites him in, giving him a hug before leading him into her flat.
They are just heading up the stairs when John checks his phone and inhales sharply. Sherlock whips his head around, concerned.
it isn't Humphrey. It's just Sherlock. What do you want now, Sherlock?" Victoria shouts.
and-" Sherlock interrupts him by grabbing John's face and dragging him in kissing him with the extremely limited knowledge that he has, but takes all of his emotions, the love, his longing, he tells John of the pain of his two years away, the heartbreak of watching John marry someone
"Mary and I split up," John says. He seems very casual.
The joke pays off, and John chuckles a bit, and Sherlock smiles at him, small and tender, horribly infatuated, and he would normally berate himself for letting so much show on his face but
Sherlock is huddled into the corner of John and Mary's car as they drive off the tarmac. John is keeping an eye on him out of the corner of his eye. He's so,
"Mm, of course love. Tell me what it is when you wake up?"
The thing is, Sherlock
" 'M not even tired, John."
"Yes- yes of course." Sherlock moves to grab what she orders as she sprouts off her list which includes flour, potatoes, and chocolate.
you, John. I do. So mu-" he's cut off by John frantically kissing all round his face, the corner of his mouth, his temple, his jaw, his neck, where Sherlock lets out and embarrassing squawk, and back up to his mouth where he holds them, faces pressed together with their smiles touching, breathing into each other.
"Fine. Well- Not really, but. You know." He shrugs. John nods and they all turn back to the telly.
He comes and drops the flowers [three (3) daisies, two (2) green carnations, and four (4) tulips] and sits next to him, taking his splotchy, wet face between his [very very soft (?? lotion???)] hands. Sherlock says nothing, staring at him, red-rimmed eyes wide and mouth slightly open. "I'm sorry I was late, love, there was a nice lady selling flowers and I'd wanted to get you some, I didn't know it'd upset you." He kisses his cheek gently and pulls him into a hug.
"Yes. I'm sorry, father." She explains what happened and sighs. "Mr. Monday is write. Maybe I am just deluding myself. I'm never going to be good enough for Victoria-"
, and he is going to die anyway, but he has to say it.
"John," he begins again. "Why are you doing this." His voice shakes slightly and he looks at a point over John's shoulder. John tilts his head and opens his mouth to speak, but Sherlock continues. "I- is this because of M- Mary..." but John is shaking his head violently, grabbing Sherlock's face and forcing him to make eye contact again.
John stays the night. Sherlock has to bite his tongue to keep from protesting.
in his hand.
A few hours pass, and Sherlock hears the springs in John's bed squeak above him, signaling that John is going to get up soon. He's proven right, of course, when John stumbles down the stairs ten minutes later, pillow creases on his cheek and hair mussed to one side. Sherlock contains the urge to smooth it down with his fingers, to curl his fingers around John's jaw and tilt-
They stand there, smiling at each other and holding hands in the middle of their sitting room, for a few minutes before John moves. He slots their fingers together and runs a hand along Sherlock's cheek, just barely making contact. Sherlock's breath catches, and John squeezes his hand again.
"I should have said it earlier." John's arm settles at his waist. "I could have. I knew, to some extent at least. I knew how I felt, and I knew that you were at least
On his discharge from rehabilitation, Sherlock is appalled to discover that he been evicted from his bolthole in Montague Street. Forced to reside at his brother’s apartment, all his worldly goods in boxes, Sherlock makes his displeasure known by being as obnoxious as possible, to the extent that even the usually impervious Mycroft finally reaches the limit.
“Dr Watson, Mr Holmes, it was a pleasure to meet you again. I will have my assistant call you regarding your suits.”
John browsed a few more pages, “There’s a biography piece on the website about Abraham Garvey,” He read it aloud for Sherlock’s benefit. “Abraham Garvey, trained… ordained… married to Ruth, four children Lois, Leah, Lydia and Abraham Junior, known as Abe.. Says here that Abe is an assistant pastor at the same church specialising… oh holy moly… in the ex-gay ministry.”
“His right sleeve mainly, although I didn’t expect him to cave so quickly.”
Hoping that the silence meant that he was alone rather than the fact that Arthur was nearby but unconscious, John applied himself to his predicament. He was a doctor and a soldier and was trained in survival techniques but nothing in the Afghan desert really compare to this. But he had also studied under the master of deduction, as he relished the comforting flavour of the mint, he let his mind wander. What would Sherlock do?
“The dear boy, not really his area, and he rather snubbed the poor doctor’s feeble attempts at flirtation and as a result Dr Watson put up his defences, and they never got back on track. Sherlock was quite resigned to their being no more than friends for ever, but then he died and when he returned, he found his only friend had moved on, so to speak.”
John pulled Sherlock back into his arms.
“Who’s in charge here,” Sherlock demanded.
Mrs Hudson opened the front door to DI Lestrade, harassed as ever.
“Impressive, truly. But I’ll be more impressed once I’m out of here”
This one nearly broke me.
“Miss Sutherland, I cannot help you find your fiancé, that is a concern for the police, and I am afraid that unless they suspect some crime has taken place, they are unlikely to take the matter very seriously. All I can advise you is to try to let Ian Moody vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
He took another mint, and wrapped his arms around his chest, now he was more awake he was more conscious of the cold, he needed to make a decision quickly.
“I think I’ll join you.” Sherlock produced his own cigarettes, lit one, and inhaled with great satisfaction.
, we have to check out at eleven. Perhaps I will take advantage of that magnificent bathroom though.”
“Your late husband, I mean Sir Wilfred was a great promotor of your talents?”
Something soft fluttered by him, a breeze? A bird? no bats.
“Oh John,” she laughed, “you hum it and I’ll play it.”
“Pity, I thought it suited you.”
“Will you turn off the light?”
“Other side.” Crowley answered.
Sherlock answered swiftly, “James Wilder won’t hurt Arthur, the Duchess will pay up, whatever they are asking for will be no more than loose change for her”
“What do you think?”
John is ready to embrace his date for the night, as a prelude to a more exciting encounter. Instead he finds Mr Cheekbones standing on the toilet seat pushing at a hatch in the ceiling.
“What?” Both John and Steve responded in unison.
They sat in companionable silence for some time, the activity had apparently moved to another part of the house, and John wondered if the Duke had forgotten about them. After the way he had spent the last sixty hours or so, John thought, there was a lot to be said for sitting on a comfortable sofa, in a room with a burning log fire, while doing nothing much at all. He wondered if he rang a bell someone would bring them tea.
“Whisky. Why not? After all, tis the season...”
“And the keys?”
James Windibank looked at Sherlock and John with a cold sneer upon his pale face. “It was a joke that’s all, an ‘armless joke, we never thought she would get so caught up in it.”
Rescue comes from an unlikely source. Sherlock receives a letter from the recently widowed Martha Hudson, who apparently now owns a town house in central London which was converted, years ago and somewhat eccentrically, into flats.
“Sherlock would enjoy it then.” Distracted, Sally looked doubtfully at Greg’s suitcase. “Is that all you’ve brought with you? I hope you’ve packed your thermals, I didn’t like the sound of the weather up there, it’s snow all the way once we’re passed Kirkcaldy.”
Sherlock gave the young woman a long and appraising look that might have been misinterpreted by anyone who didn’t know him, John however could tell that he was deducing.
Today his favourite haunt is occupied by a recently qualified clinical toxicologist who moonlights as a tutor to the undergraduates at UCL. Sherlock deduces that he is thinking of going into teaching full time although he would have to widen his specialism. Sherlock doesn’t offer his opinion… but thinks he should.
Gradually his colour began to look normal, although Mrs Hudson still hovered around just in case further assistance was needed. Sherlock did not dismiss her for the same reason, instead motioned her to sit also as they all took tea. Now that he felt better, the visitor, obviously a client, was at pains to press his cause.
“Lucid?”
“That’s what I mean. I know him, could you tell him I’ll be ten minutes and ask him to wait outside.”
“Stay here.” Steve turned to Danny and ordered, before handing a torch to Sherlock.
Chris Taylor and his mother were already seated at a table in the pub’s dining area. John introduced Mary and Sherlock and explained the situation. Mrs Taylor insisted they call her Ruth and said that Sherlock was welcome to stay the night. Chris, Sherlock already knew, and noted he looked happier away from the company of Bill Murray; he did a quick inspection of Ruth and wondered how this elegant widow in her late fifties could afford to live in a large house in Fitzrovia on such a modest income until he deduced her occupation.
John picked up the letter, and skimmed the contents, “typed, no address, sentimental gush all hearts and flowers, swearing undying devotion and asking to do the same... what I would have expected.”
“Right up your street, perp’s obviously a chemist or some kind of scientific background”
“That’s good, because I love you too.”
He stole out of the bedroom and back the way he had come, on the floor below he could clearly hear Mr Fell and an elderly woman talking loudly and firmly, but without shouting. He deduced that both aunt and nephew thought the other was going deaf.
Steve thought for a moment, “To be honest not since the Spring, I brought a geologist, from the University up here for a visit.”
"What made you leave in such a hurry?" Sherlock asked.
In the alleyway the car was waiting, empty but unlocked. As Sherlock stood by it wondering whether to get in or to make his own way home, the cabbie sauntered up to him, chewing gum and smelling faintly of smoke.
He could predict 99% of their questions the moment they opened the door, but, Sherlock acknowledged the 1% did spark his interest and in what other work would he have people pay to have him deduce them?
“Today we move from I to we, Sherlock, take this ring as a symbol of my decision to join my life with yours until death should part us.”
Baker Street - Some weeks after Sherringford
Aziraphale looked thoughtful for a moment and then smiled, “you know, I really think it might work, that is just what Dr Watson needs, a rival… but where…” Aziraphale turned to look at Crowley.
“Good. Out of interest, how’s your Telugu?”
Sherlock wasn’t sure. He liked the sound of the word ‘stay’, but not so closely associated with ‘a few days’ so he said nothing.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Since when do you have deductions, the best you can do is hunches and then usually they are wrong. There’s something you’re not telling me.”
“Me?” John asked, wondering what the policeman was about to ask.
When Rosie woke from her nap Mrs Hudson and John wrapped her up and took her out for a brief walk, it was cold and none of them would benefit from being out to long.
A case Lestrade had said, with coded messages, no more than a five but with the potential to be a seven or even an eight if there was more than one body.
“The only evidence I can offer you is the evidence of the dancing men,” Sherlock admitted, “I will explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to ensure that justice be done. Will you allow us into your investigation, or will you prefer that we should act independently?”
“And Mr Wilder, how long has he been with the Duke?”
“The woman is the mother of the older man, a widow, she is used to having money and has a large disposable income. They’ve not been on good terms for years; he is something in the city by trade I would think but not successful.  That’s a Paul Smith suit, but it is at least ten years old judging by the shine on the seat and the wear at the elbows, his shoes have seen better days too. Plus his appearance has all the tell-tale signs of overindulgence, I won’t bore you with them but I would say a taste for living beyond his means, which is why he’s arrived in Wilvercombe to come between Mummy and her Beau. He’s worried about his inheritance, with reason.”
“This was left at reception for you, Madam, Sir.”
“I am not…that.” Sherlock said at last.
“I know.”
After two performances of the Royal Ballet (
This was greeted with a chuckle, and another silence.
John looked askance at this and decided it might be a good idea to check the time, and his phone; the café was filling up with surfers, so it must be later than he thought. He found three messages from Bill, and one from Chris, talking about food, beer and pool in that order. He felt Sherlock studying him intently as he read his messages.
And then it struck him, an interesting body part from Bart’s, his second wish.
After the detective had examined the body and compared his findings with Molly, (male, aged 30-40, 198 cm tall, 140 kilos, South American, possibly Brazilian, sailor, judging by his clothes and tattoos, and the specks of paint under his nails), Sherlock and Lestrade attended the scene where the body had been drawn out of the water. Here Sherlock considered the approximate time of death, the tidal patterns for the two nights before, the wind speed and other prevailing conditions and declared that the corpse had come from a container ship presently docked at Tilbury.
The man smiled and said, “You live up to your reputation Mr. Holmes, yes, I was born Richard Cubitt and my husband, Patrick Hilton.”
“Perhaps you gave away more than you realised in your letters to him,” John answered.
and the whole ceremony was over in less than ten minutes.
Shaved, he dressed again not in the grey shirt but in a favourite purple one.
“I had a change of heart.” Aziraphale announced defensively.
John nodded standing up and stretching, before pulling on his coat and handing Sherlock the notebook he had brought from the cabin. “Well thank you, it’s been an interesting day. Not quite what I expected.”
“The Windibanks and Mrs Etherege live and work closely to Mary Sutherland and know her intimately. They know her likes and dislikes and are supremely placed to create her ideal suitor. Mrs Etherege encourages Mary to advertise in the lonely hearts, they produce a reply that is so exactly her perfect man that even if she receives genuine replies, she will not consider them. She becomes so enamoured of this man that she willingly becomes engaged to him without ever meeting him, to the point that they are due to be married. Then fate intervenes, he does not show up, but he has not jilted her, instead he writes to her with the story of some unavoidable incident that has prevented their marriage at this time and making her swear to wait for him for eternity. Heartbroken she agrees, she will remain true, and single, working for Mrs Etheredge and with the Windibanks living off her the rest of their natural lives.”
Mrs Hudson appeared in the doorway of Sherlock’s bedroom.
Mike isn’t surprised, “well find something to keep you busy.”
******
The combined efforts of his mother and Mrs Hudson resulted in Sherlock playing a selection of Christmas songs on his violin, though it was John’s look of soft affection that made it all worthwhile. After he had had enough and put the violin away he went over to John who was having a fine time talking shop with Molly and Stefan.
Sherlock blinked, he opened his mouth but nothing came out. He blinked again, and again. In total he blinked fifty-seven times in twenty-two seconds. It hurt John’s eyes to watch.
“There’s something else, I wouldn’t bother you, only Mary has her heart set on it, and you are the only person I would trust…”
Reception, Food –
His confessional is the sitting room at 221b, his Confessors a socially inept consulting detective and his ethereal companion.
Sherlock continued his assessment and noted that his visitor wore a signet ring on the little finger of his right hand, and a plain gold band on the ring finger of his left. Sherlock could tell without closer inspection that the signet ring was Victorian, most likely a family heirloom whereas the wedding ring was probably less than a year old.
“I’ve some clothes at my brothers, it’s a nuisance but I can go and get them.”
“All right then, marry me.”
The Wedding Breakfast
Back at the castle they laughed until their sides hurt, then John made tea and the stranger emptied the gold onto the floor, hid the barrow behind the couch and threw the straw out of the window into the moat. Then the stranger said goodbye and vanished, and John lay down to sleep for what was left of the night.
“The explosion rocked the joists, the partition was unsound, the whole thing had to come down, and while it was down it seemed silly not to do the place up properly.”
Mycroft doesn’t deal in regrets, if he did he might spare one for the loss of his childhood shadow, but far too much water has flowed under that particular bridge. Instead he watches from a distance, through the capital’s CCTV network, the minutiae of his brother’s existence.
“So, forgive me if I don’t feel that thrilled about having a jolly in Scotland at the taxpayers’ expense rather than on my way home to London in time for my wedding day!”
The sign on the door had been the same for so long that Crowley no longer bothered to read it, he had committed it to memory at least a century ago.
“Well according to this website he is conducting a mission weekend at a church in Little Rock, and right now,” John looked at his watch, it was nearly five, “Right now he should be just getting into the pulpit to preach his sermon. Hold on there are some photographs, of the mission team…”
“One would hope the visitors to Wilvercombe could survive an afternoon without knowing they are going on a long journey,” Sherlock replied. “Right let’s be off. Perhaps you could kindly bring that notebook with you?”
“It was probably his idea to dump you in the Ragged Shaw, with both you and Arthur missing it would have been an open and shut case. The Duchess would have paid the ransom demand and you alone would have been blamed when the boy’s body was found. Your own disappearance would only have substantiated your involvement in the crime. No doubt the local plods would have placed you in Costa Rica, or South Africa or somewhere similar.
He handed a sheet of the familiar notepaper to Sherlock, another poem, a longer, complete one. Sherlock read it quickly, and then again taking his time.
“And you’re married to your work, but I don’t think either of those statements were entirely true that night in Angelo’s, and I think between us we’ve had enough of lies.
At some point in the midst of a childhood spent at odds with the world around him, one or other of his psychiatrists had labelled Sherlock thus.
Sherlock would have been happy to stand up with John at the Town Hall before the registrar and two witnesses but John, perhaps not wanting to give the impression that this marriage is inferior to his first, insists on a more lavish affair.
“We have discussed this before, Mycroft. You know you can speak freely in front of John.”
“I am,” John conceded, “I forgotten how good he is to be with when he’s on form.”
John groaned.
“Both James and Rueben are familiar with the caves, most of us are who live on the estate,” Steve replied. “There’s torches and ropes in the truck, as you know from this morning Mr Holmes.”
Rosie n-n-n-n-ned in agreement between mouthfuls of banana.
I can imagine Sherlock a somewhat over anxious parent, although quite happy to gift Rosie a full set of lock picks for her fourth birthday
“The Duke, what he said to us just before we left, that he wouldn’t have married if he’d known he had an heir?”
Once Rosie was safely delivered to Mrs Hudson with teddy, and a small bag containing a spare top and a couple of snacks, John made his way back upstairs to the sitting room where Sherlock was now dressed but nowhere near ready to go out. He seemed to be pithering around with John’s laptop and his own phone and still had nothing on his feet, so despite his assurances to Mycroft (and John assumed the morning’s proposed activity was someway related to Mycroft’s visit the previous evening), Sherlock did not appear to be acting as if time was of the essence after all.
“How did you come by the weapon?”
“She said that feelings are not my particularly area of expertise”
Steve started slowly, conscious that it wasn’t his story to tell. “Alexander was a country boy at heart, even though that branch of the family lived in London most of the year, his parents kept a house on the estate, Holderness Lodge, and his mother would bring him here during the school holidays. I got to know him quite well then.  He was always a daredevil, climbing things, or diving off things, the world was too small for Alexander, live fast, die young and be a beautiful corpse he used to say to me, well he managed the first two at least.
“Well, in fact Dinah proposed to me. I take your point, but I mean it. Marry me.”
On the other side of the room his phone buzzed. Sherlock ignored it, the corporate banker replying to his earlier message, he deduced. It would keep.
He tracks her down, not at Bart’s, but at home in her little flat. It is of course familiar to him. He remembers being holed up here after the fall, in Molly’s ‘spare’ room, waiting for Mycroft to spirit him out of the country. The last place anyone would have thought of looking.
John ignored them, he knew they were in for fair amount of hanging around and rang the bell for tea. No-one felt like talking much, but after an hour Hopkins came out and said that everyone apart from John and Sherlock could go.
“Well, I’ve brought plenty to keep you occupied. The venue has sent through the menu cards, they want us to whittle it down to a choice of three before we go to the tasting next month, and I’ve brought the brochures too.” Mary gestured towards the holdall, “I’ve marked the ones I think look best, there’s a couple of all-inclusive in Alicante, but I’d be happy with Cephalonia or Rhodes if you’re not keen on Spain.
“What if he’s not illegitimate?” John shot back.
“He was always pushing the limits of his endurance, there were always new mountains to climb, new seas to sail, new caverns to explore. I never really understood it, where he got his sense of adventure from; the bravest thing I ever do is ride a horse and my father was the same. Alex met Jo here, when he was staying with Mother at the Lodge, I was working in the city by then and our paths did not cross that often.
221C - Sherlock Holmes
John and Sherlock went back into the reception room of the suite to join the rest of the party. Molly and Mrs Hudson had sobered up quickly at the sight of the police taking Dinah into custody.
(Sherlock’s mental filing system is a mystery even to himself. He has deleted the solar system in its entirety; he cannot name the present King of England yet somehow without trying recalls that tomorrow marks another year gone by).
“Her hands?”
******
There’s no need for further explanation, they sip their tea; John sat on the edge of the bed.
When Sherlock and Rosie had finished the tree, John made her some dinner, he was in two minds about her presence at the party and was hoping she would go down before it started. He made himself a sandwich and tried to interest Sherlock in one, as he was sure the detective hadn’t eaten anything since breakfast but Sherlock claimed to be too busy, and disappeared into his bedroom where a few minutes later John heard him tuning his violin. John was amazed.
“So all those words, beauty, brilliant, hair, legs, lips… you were writing about me?”
“Miss Sutherland refers to her fiancé as Ian or Ian Moody if required to give his full name, but you will note that the signature, which is typed is IAN B MOODY. You are a great fan of crosswords are you not Dr Watson?”
“You’re married… to Mary” Sherlock is not to be toyed with.
“Taking your own life… Interesting expression. Taking it from whom? Once it’s over, it’s not you who’ll miss it. Your own death is something that happens to everybody else… hand it over”
She had sparked his interest before, Ms Mary Morstan; he’d sent a freedom of information request to his superiors after Aziraphale had first mentioned her. He was still waiting for her file, but he had done his research, and he had decided the best way to approach her.
sound which he knew meant him and
“Yes, they were drawn in chalk on the window ledge at the back of the house, I asked Maggie and she washed them off.”
Steve had wound down the driver’s window to call to Sherlock.  Sherlock reached the passenger door of the truck just as it was opened by a youth of around nineteen. That he was Debbie’s son was obvious to Sherlock even before Steve introduced him as his nephew, Danny. The boy looked half asleep, but he jumped down from the cab quickly enough and walked to the rear of the jeep and lifted down a bicycle.
“I wouldn’t want to put you to any more trouble.” Sherlock replied. “I can do my own legwork where John is concerned. As you say it shouldn’t take long to track him down.”
“Then what do you suggest?” Aziraphale said petulantly.
Camaraderie established, Debbie was instantly more talkative, “I am only going to help you because of Dr Watson, I really don’t want to lose my job, but he is such a nice man, no side to him, never talked down to us because we were just domestics.”
“Is it a case?”
No more flaky Harry One, no more lost weekends, no more benders.
Mycroft was not one for playing games, but he made an exception in view of Crowley’s special status. The demon did not say where he had had the clue from, and Mycroft was enough of the dedicated public servant not to ask the man to divulge his sources.
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t know where else to go.”
Might come in useful, he reflects, to make someone jealous… a certain Detective Inspector, for example, who, unlike Lady Smallwood, happens to know that Mycroft Holmes is a bossy bottom.
“Why would he be?” Mycroft continued “It’s been two years. He’s got on with his life.”
Garvey looked at John, the two police officers and finally at Sherlock and then something broke inside and the words spilled out.
“All you have to do is flirt, you know, make puppy-eyes, lick your lips and tell him he’s amazing. You’ll have him eating out of your hand in no time.”
Sherlock huffed in reply and fixed his magnifier on the mechanism of the lock.
“Naturally.” Sherlock echoed thoughtfully before turning again and leaving the room.
The congratulations of the Met’s finest were empty praise in the absence of his blogger, but Sherlock uncharacteristically opted to accompany Lestrade to Scotland Yard immediately to give his statement instead of making him wait until the morning; an anomaly which did not go unnoticed by the Inspector. Sherlock felt deflated, only he knew that he could have solved the mystery in half the time if he had not been so preoccupied by the knowledge of John’s new attachment. Finally finished at the Yard, he allowed the Inspector to give him a lift home.
Mrs Hudson immediately offered to keep Rosie and while this led to a slight discussion about not imposing it was soon settled. Rosie and John would stay the night at Baker Street and he and Sherlock would head off to Norfolk in the morning. Mrs Hudson offered to bathe Rosie while John made up the bed. With Rosie down for the night and the baby monitor in place, John found an old film on the TV to watch while Sherlock filled in him with a few details of the Bayswater Hotel case. It was warm and peaceful and John was filled with an old contentment, even Sherlock started to relax. So they both jumped when Sherlock’s phone and laptop beeped simultaneously signalling the arrival of an email. It was from Richard Hilton-Cubitt.
At his destination Greg paid off the cab and made his way through the porticoed doorway that was so familiar to him. He made his enquiries of the concierge but to his surprise was told that the person he was looking for was not in the building. Greg was about to flash his ID, not that he genuinely thought it would get him past security who at the very least were SAS trained. But he was spared the embarrassment of trying as at that moment the very person he was looking for came through the door. Or at least he could tell from their build and something in their expression who they were, nothing else gave it away. Greg stared open mouthed in shock, then as all the pain, frustration and misery of the last ten days fell away, he burst out laughing.
wept the tangled mess of his curls back from his face. Sherlock’s skin was pale, with two high spots of colour on his cheeks denoting the fever. He looked no more than twelve years old. Fortunately, the hospital had sent him home with a course of antibiotics and in the company of his own doctor.
“Well the boy’s nothing like him.”
“A couple of hours on google last night, plus what Debbie, Aveling and you Steve told me.”
The people who will not be quiet even when they are silent.
“Not like that,” the angel said hurriedly, “It was just nice to have someone to go about with.”
“Having a nap, she was worn out from seeing Santa.”
Crowley looked up, something the angel had said had rung a bell. “I’ve read that name just recently…”
It involves a drug cartel, the summary execution of a police officer, and one Frank Hudson, current residence, Death Row, Florida. Sherlock baulks and refuses to assist but she’s persistent.
Despite the fact the whole business was needling him; Sherlock found he was reluctant to raise the subject of the mawkish verse with John. He sincerely hoped that it was merely a temporary mental aberration on the part of his friend, something that would fade away as long as it remained unacknowledged.
John should have known better
John and Mary’s various friends accepted the news without much comment although John agonised over what was said behind his back. The vicar sent a card which John threw on the fire. Of Mary’s particular friends, the bridesmaids and Archie’s mum, only Janine seemed sceptical about the story of South Africa and Mary’s long-lost love but then she had grown up in Ireland during the Troubles and knew more than she would care to admit about disappearances and witness protection.
“You said Alexander told his brother that he wanted to do the right thing by the girl and the baby. You all took that to mean money and a roof over their head, but to me that sounds as if he intended to marry her.”
“Yes, ok. More than… really”
The woman hesitated.
John tore the letter into pieces and went to put them down the waste disposal, then hesitated. It was probably better to be known as Mary’s jilted fiancé than suspected of being her murderer.
“Come in.”
“I saw the blood and dust and sand, I could even smell the cordite in the air… I saw him hurt… bleeding out under an Afghan sky… before I’d had a chance to deduce the slightest thing about him. But I couldn’t tell him that, so instead I told him I loved him.”
Lestrade made his excuses, he was after all at work.  Sherlock and John called in on Hopkins, but she had nothing for them, so they made their way home.
“You are sure you cannot ask your husband outright?”
“No, just the unusual hand structure and fully functioning extra finger. Lived a perfectly normal life apart the inability to buy gloves off the peg.”
It explains a lot…
Mr Windibank held out his hand. “You may give it to me.”
The visitor went straight to the point, “Well Mr. Holmes, what do you make of that?”, indicating the printed out photograph that Sherlock had left in full view on the desk
So, the stranger took John by the hand, and they ran down corridors, climbed stairs and ducked behind curtains until they came to the Queen’s stronghold. There the stranger picked the locks while John overpowered the guards, then they went in and helped themselves to as much gold as they could carry, for they did not think the Queen deserved to benefit completely from her ill-gotten gains. Then they made their escape back to the heart of the city, distributing the gold to everyone they met in need along the way (although the soldier kept a portion back for his troubles).
“That’s crazy! Did she make the whole thing up, send the letters to herself?”
“Look Sherlock, I don’t want to make you feel bad or anything, but we both know that relationships are not exactly your forte. I hate to think of this woman making a fool of you or exploiting your inexperience for her own ends. Or coming between you and the things that are essential to you.”
“But how did the window come to be shut and fastened?”
She reviewed her list:
So, you wear the stupid hat, you flip your collar, and you pose on the steps of Baker Street and smile for the cameras, and all the while your heart (which you never knew you had until you met him) quietly breaks.
Mrs Hudson ventured to ask John if he was having a good day.
He glanced at the Doctor’s face and his expression caused Sherlock to add hastily, “so I am given to understand. I haven’t sampled them myself.”
As soon as Mary was out of earshot Mr and Mrs Windibank entered the room, obviously spoiling for a fight. Sherlock was on them before they could speak.
“I’ll tell you, if you’ll help me”
Sherlock does not dislike Mike Stamford, an unsuspecting character who genuinely believes that Sherlock has permission to be on the premises despite having met the real Peter Wesson on at least three occasions. Today, Mike is even more distracted than usual, having learnt on the hospital grapevine that his friend from his med school days, John Watson, is due to be deployed in Afghanistan. Mike is naturally concerned.
Next Molly shyly offered Stefan her cheek, which he deftly bypassed to give her a proper kiss on the lips.
Whether Harry Harkins had instigated the crime against his fellow smuggler, or the actions of the boa constrictor had been a happy co-incidence, Sherlock was yet to discover. He had been forced to shed his coat like a snake sheds its skin and escape through a port hole into the water.
“My number… my private number, let’s have a drink sometime. Call me” And with a sassy smile she’s gone leaving the British Government rather disconcerted.
Reaching the end of the market, he crossed the road to the hardware superstore. Seeing the work that had been done on Baker Street had made him feel ashamed that he had done so little to his own home. Rosie’s room in particular still had a bare walls where he had stripped the paper but never got round to redecorating. That was something he could do over Christmas.
“Wait!” John interrupted, “you know all this how?”
“Really?” Sherlock was nonplussed.
In Baker Street, a meeting
Aziraphale suddenly remembered where he was, and more importantly what century he was in, “forget I said that.”
Interesting choice of word, Mycroft thinks, not want, not have... need.
“Of course, I was glad to see you.”
John got up to take his sleeping daughter from her and together they made a nest on one of the arm chairs surrounded by cushions to allow Rosie to nap in safety.
“We met through friends, I was not involved in the investigation into Sir Wilfred’s death, that was handled by the Norfolk Constabulary.  I have of course informed my superiors of my relationship with Mrs Beckworth... I mean, Ms Shepherd, er… Dinah.”
As Sherlock was enduring the film for John’s sake, he had no objections and stopped the DVD.  He watched as John stood up, stretched and went about his evening routine, kitchen, bathroom and up to bed. It was only quarter past nine.
Inspector Martin perked up, “And do you have an idea who that someone might be?”
“You’re crazy! Is that even legal?” John exclaimed.
“Yes”
Lestrade sighed and signalled to the undertaker and the forensics assistants who were ready to collect the body.
“Mr King” Sherlock questioned the agent “You handle guns in your line of business. Do you think that it might have been two shots ﬁred almost at the same instant?”
Sherlock indicated the client’s chair.
Sherlock hurls the pistol into the Thames; the swirling water awakens a memory in his mind palace. When he emerges he finds he’s alone on the footpath by Hungerford Bridge
“Which one, Irene Adler…” Aziraphale’s went wide with shock. “not Moriarty?” he whispered.
Until John is injured on a case, that is.
Unfortunately, Sherlock doesn’t have time for him.
Dr Watson, you really did take everyone by surprised. You must tell us later, how you pulled it off.”
“No more than an hour, I’m only going to Mac’s on the Edgware Road. I’ll make you some toast and get going.”
“They’re going to let me know.” John replied.
Greg crossed the room in a stride, took Mycroft into his arms and kissed him thoroughly. He appeared he was engaged to the British Government,
“First set?”
While John took his shower, Sherlock allowed himself to cautiously examine his dream. Under no circumstances would he countenance any suggestion that he had a ‘gift’, he simply relied on observation, deduction and the marrying of the two with cold logic. But he could not deny that his dream had conjured up his worse fears for John’s safety, the very fears that had made him say ‘don’t go to Afghanistan’ before he even knew him. The premonition was for injury, though, not death, and if there was any comfort in this to be had, then Sherlock would grab it with both hands.
“Also true”
“To be honest, although it was incredibly painful, saying the words out loud was cathartic” she pauses and then adds “You should try it sometime”
On the last night, after a few too many tequila sunrises, she kindly lets him down and says as much.
Sherlock slid out of bed and grabbed his dressing gown. John caught a glimpse of the scars on Sherlock’s back, as he disappeared into the bathroom. He should be used to them by now, but they never failed to shock him.
“Then there isn’t a moment to lose!” The angel began hurriedly to clear bottles, glasses and other debris from the kitchen table, vaporising the clutter as he went along, “we have to make a plan.
Sherlock wondered
“What would you suggest?” Aziraphale snapped, “Nothing that endangers life, this time, please.”
Harry doesn’t meet his eyes, her usual tell.
“I am.”
Sherlock said nothing but gave John a thumbs up.
“I could get used to this.” He whispered.
John interrupted, “For heaven’s sake, a child’s life is at risk here!”
The stranger was perplexed at this and said so.
John yawned again “I’m sorry, I’d done in. Do you mind if we finish this tomorrow night?”
It revealed a sturdy, middle-sized man around thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner.
“Which was?”
“Oh” she oscillates between the detective and his effigy. “Of course… a dummy”
John had no idea if Sherlock was joking or in earnest so let it pass.
John woke to a darkness that was so absolute that, in the absence of anything covering his face, he wondered if he had been struck blind. He dimly remembered a blow to the back of his head, and the residual headache confirmed it.
John blinked and rubbed his face again. “Sorry, it’s just that I’ve always thought of you as married to the work.”
Having made this announcement there was nothing for it but to all say goodnight and go to bed.
For there were flowers, flowers everywhere. There were sunflowers, sweet peas, and snapdragons on the shelves. There were tiger lilies, tuberoses and tulips on the tables, there were dahlias, daisies and delphiniums on the desk. Each one the most flawless shape, the most vibrant colour, the most potent scent.
“In Birmingham though.”
“Fiancé?” Sherlock could not contain his surprise and glanced at the woman’s hands; this was a deduction he had missed.
John could usually be encouraged to snap out of the doldrums by a cup of tea, a Chinese takeaway, and a bit of sex, but she had only managed to engage him in the first two over the weekend and his grumpy mood continued. She would try again tonight, even though it was a ‘school night’. She hadn’t worked out what was behind John’s temper, though she presumed the dancing lesson hadn’t gone according to plan, or perhaps John was still smarting about Sherlock’s plus one. If so, she needed to nip that in the bud. She turned to the menu again.
“But it must have cost a fortune.”
“James won’t gain anything if Arthur dies,” Steve continued, “the estates not entailed, there’s no such thing anymore but there is a trust and the house, the capital, and the land go with the title, there’s a cousin in Australia who gets the lot.”
“More likely another CIA agent landing on Mrs H’s bins, knowing you”
Mycroft, turned then to Crowley, “And I take it that you have become embroiled in this hare-brained scheme to turn Dr Watson’s attentions from his fiancée Mary Morstan to my brother Sherlock.”
Mary had already realised that physically Dr Watson was her type, attractive in a stocky, military way, intelligent but not as much as she was, honourable but with an edge to it. Turned out he was good in bed, which was a bonus, a man worth hanging up your holster for. What surprised her and finally convinced her that Sherlock’s death was genuine, was that John Watson was completely poleaxed by grief at the loss of his friend. Although that made her job easier, lending a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. Within weeks John was practically living at her flat in Kensal Green, and within months he had asked her to marry him.
“In case Greg turned up and punched your lights out.”
“How extraordinary, it never occurred to me before, but you can almost see directly into Saltire’s room from here.”
Not working Fridays did give John the luxury of a three-day weekend but even so there never seemed to be enough hours in the day. John made a mental list of his usual chores, washing, ironing, shopping, cleaning, they all seemed to come round more often than once a week.
“Fine, shelve the takeaway until tomorrow night, in fact I saw in the paper that violinist you like is doing a live concert on BBC4 at nine o’clock tomorrow, we could watch it together.”
“Calm down. It may have escaped your notice but your family or at least one member of it has kept me and my division rather busy for the last few months. Just after some background. John’s already warned me not to ask about the Christmas dinners.”
John licked his lips and looked thoughtful but then admitted he had no idea.
After Crowley had run from his shop, a demon on a mission, apparently, Aziraphale had given himself a good talking to. This was not the time to be sitting in the doldrums, he was an angel and a principality, he could act decisively if necessary.
She laughed nervously, “Died aged sixty-eight, natural causes, left his body for medical research.”
“He would have known the game was…” Sherlock’s mobile began to ring, he answered it. “Yes… yes, good… I see… I will inform them, yes.”
The text message apprised him of the whereabouts of the person he needed to see; it helped to have an informant on the inside. Greg took a cab, despite the expense, he was too knackered to endure another jaunt on the tube.
By eight o’clock they were ready, Mrs Hudson had arrived early with a plate of cheese straws and the offer to put Rosie down and read her a story so that John could get changed. She seemed to have the magic touch as she appeared fifteen minutes later saying Rosie had gone out like a light.
“So it’s back to the suburbs for you. I can see that is a dilemma.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who has access to your vehicle?”
Mycroft took out his watch. “I wonder if I might interest you in a postprandial stroll?”
He was almost right, there was only one elderly demon on the desk, unfortunately he had a peaked cap and a clipboard.
John seemed to think this was the best plan. “I’m London bound myself, I’m staying a couple of nights with Chris’s Mum in Camden, before reporting to barracks on Sunday evening.”
Unusually Sherlock had stayed behind, unusual as in the months since John and Rosie had been in residence at 221B these regular excursions where the three of them went out
“How long will you be?” Sherlock’s voice had an edge of whine to it.
John cringed, he had been thinking that Sherlock’s questioning was insensitive and there he had managed to go one better. He blushed, apologised and looked at his watch.
In a previous life this would have been a precursor to John chatting Sam up and eventually asking her for a drink with the objective of getting her into bed.
“Why did he leave?”
“I hope you are not too disappointed about the job, although there might be something similar in London.”
John was not satisfied. “There must be something you can do; you can’t let them get away with it.”
True, John Watson had successfully breeched his defences, with his giggles, and tea, and woolly jumpers. Lestrade, Molly and Mrs Hudson, had started out as useful people to know but had been elevated to the status of friends by dint of tenacity if nothing else. But Ralph Fell, was a whole new ball game, Sherlock supposed this was not the first time a client had crossed the boundaries, Irene Adler drove him crazy with her texting, but she had been surprisingly helpful at times over the years.
Unsure quite where Sherlock was going with this, John agreed, “A tragedy”
He was now surreptitiously watching an instructional video on the art of napkin folding on his laptop while Mary went through the RSVPs.
“A filthy dirty, door to door salesman, who breaks into other people’s homes”
“So how did you meet your fiancée?”
Sherlock deduced there had been a slight falling out between the three men, possibly due to John’s aversion to spending the day surrounded by the temptations of gambling. He filed this for future reference and merely said, “their loss is my gain.”
Frankly, Sherlock didn’t think it sounded all that promising but he was always rather antsy the day after a visit to Sherringford and happy with anything that would occupy his mind, however briefly. So Sherlock made the effort to ready the flat for his visitor, including printing out the attachment, and putting the client’s chair in place.
Crowley was quiet for some time and then said nonchalantly, “well, I would,” which in his opinion settled the argument.
“Oh! Dr Watson! and Mr Holmes… I did not recognise you there at first.”
“You think that was her, that she did this before?”
Sherlock quickly found a hoodie for Rosie to wear on the way home and was just leaving the room when he noticed a scrunched up piece of paper on the floor, just beyond the waste bin, as if it had been thrown but missed the target. It was the same notepaper as the night before and Sherlock found it impossible to resist investigating further.
Sherlock chose that moment to come out into the hall. “If you’re here to gossip about me with my landlady I shall return to my own flat and let you do so without the inconvenience of whispering.”
“You were not on stage that night, Ms Shepherd, why was that?”
Crowley tried to persuade him otherwise but Aziraphale was adamant, in the end it was Crowley that caved.
“Aside from Mr and Mrs Windibanks, one other person has a great deal to lose should Mary Sutherland chose to get married. The Windibanks might lose their home and livelihood but Mrs Etherege was in danger of losing an exceptional secretary.”
, John thought, he was proud of her).
******
“Go on” encouraged one of the officers.
“The what?”
“Thank you, John, it’s not easy with my hip, and I’m not getting any younger.”
At this, Sherlock stepped into the ring, “Mr Hilton-Cubitt has been seriously injured and is at death’s door.”
The forthcoming wedding was the main topic of conversation round the table, unbelievably tedious but at the same time Crowley stayed tuned in readiness for any snippets of information that he could glean. It soon became apparent that none of the women present knew anything of Mary’s family or history or had known her longer than about a year. Mary seemed to have sprung from the womb fully fledged at the age of thirty-six.
They burst into the huge bedroom and were greeted by the sight of Dinah, lying face down on the bed with Sherlock kneeling over her and for one horrible moment John thought he had interrupted the start of the honeymoon. When his senses caught up with his eyes, he could see quite clearly the room was in disarray, the covers pulled from the bed and the Turkish delight scattered over the floor. But this was not caused by the throes of passion, Sherlock had one knee in the small of his wife’s back and was pinning her arms to the bed, while she was flailing around trying to evade him, kicking her legs up behind her to try to tip him off. Sherlock at some point had taken off his tie, possibly with the intention of binding her arms together but Dinah was putting up more of a fight than he had anticipated.
Mrs Hudson, made more tea and as it grew darker, drew the curtains and lit the fire. It was very cosy and John began to feel dozy himself. This was probably why Mrs Hudson’s next line of questioning caught him unawares.
“I spoke to Paul Cloete this morning, and he stuck to his story, he had returned from college unexpectedly as there had been an outbreak of glandular fever in his hall of residence and he had thought it best to come home. He had decided to take a walk in the woods and to pot a few rabbits while he was about it. It might give lie to Miss Baker’s claim that he wouldn’t hurt a fly, but it doesn’t make him a murderer.
“Except the Duke guessed at James Wilder’s involvement and confronted him with it. Then Dr Huxtable phoned the Duke, no doubt with the intention of exonerating the school. James answered, panicked and ran off to the Lodge, only the police beat him to it.”
“I don’t know game you are playing, but this is Janine all over again.”
He is distracted by Lady S. She appears to be waving a card at him
Sherlock continued his interrogation. “Who else drives it?”
“I know how these scams work, it is all based on tells and lucky guesses…”
The motion-triggered grenade had been particularly random in the damage it had caused. The sitting room had caught the brunt of it, while Sherlock’s bedroom had emerged relatively unscathed. The kitchen was a mess, not helped, no doubt, by the amount of volatile liquids that Sherlock stored there. The plasterboard wall in John’s old room had collapsed, revealing a huge space under the eaves which had, in his opinion, great potential. There was even an ancient hand basin fixed to the far wall, probably left over from when the household had a servant, but hopefully meant the upper floor still had a water supply.
Once in his flat, Sherlock changed and made himself a cup of tea and got to work on deciphering the stick figures. Having concluded the most frequent figure was an E the first message looked like this
“Morose, uncommunicative and taking all the joy out of Christmas.”
Crowley was secretly pleased to see that Aziraphale’s little kitchenette had been largely taken over by the most precious of the angel’s collection of books; a clear indication, at least he hoped, that the foray into floristry was merely temporary and a means to an end. Quite what that end was, he hoped to discover over a glass or two of Aziraphale’s excellent Châteauneuf du Pape.
In the sitting room of 221b Baker Street, chairs pushed out of the way, rug rolled up and the sound of Danny Williams singing
The glitter seemed to have got everywhere. John attacked the cuffs with a lint roller before placing the shirt in the washing machine. It was over all his clothes and not just the ones he had worn at work yesterday in the ‘Santa’s Grotto’ that had become of his office.
Sherlock gave a look which told John exactly what he thought of that suggestion.
******
“He’s really quite a famous actor, married Jennifer Aniston.”
“Was? You don’t think…” she trailed off, not wanting to voice her fears.
Aziraphale ran out of steam and Crowley took advantage to make a few observations of his own.
“So how are things really John?”
“I wanted more. And do you know something? I still do. I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. But that’s the point…That’s the whole point” John is close to tears as he reveals the magnitude of the crime he perpetrated against the person who loved him best.
“The nearest village is very small, more of a hamlet really; we all know each other well. I believe one or two of the houses do AirBNB but I couldn’t say for sure.”
At the end of the call, Sherlock knew more than John, but less than his brother, and had no idea how close he had been at one stage, to losing his life at Mary’s hands.
He sat down at his computer and googled Sherlock Holmes, he read the detective’s blog, he read Dr Watson’s blog, for good measure he googled Mary Morstan. She did not have a blog, which was disappointing. In fact, she didn’t have much at all, which was curious.
“Amazing isn’t it?” John reflects “That these plants taken in moderation cure, but an incorrect dosage kills”
Sherlock cannot resist a deduction “and the Burlesque”
Rosie seemed to think this was a good idea.
“No, the warehouse was a blind, a waste of valuable time; they have another headquarters closer to the wharf. I need to concentrate. Silence everyone!”
“Then she is to remain bound to this fictitious romance for the rest of her life?”
“I have nothing left to give,” John replied, “But even if I had, I wouldn’t.”
John gave Sherlock a grim smile,
As soon as Ralph had left, Sherlock had said something about getting changed and disappeared into his bedroom. John opened his mouth to protest, he was here to dance, and Sherlock was dressed for dancing, but he changed his mind; he had seen Sherlock in all manner of guises, from bespoke suits to pyjamas but the dancewear was a new experience entirely, he looked young, athletic and something else entirely. It was probably a good thing that Sherlock was going to change, he was altogether to distracting dressed like a kid from
“And I have a cabin with a two-foot six bunk.”
“James informed me that Arthur was quite safe. He knew well that I should never willingly inform on him to the police, Arthur would be restored, and James would be set up for life.”
This situation might have gone on indefinitely had it not been disturbed by the arrival of an early morning visitor to Baker Street, complete with frenzied banging on the front door followed by the aggravated sound of Mrs Hudson calling up the stairs.
“Dinah has come to the conclusion that her engagement to Inspector Lestrade was hasty, made at a time when she was beside herself with grief following the death of her husband, Major Beckworth. I have long admired Ms Shepherd and over the past two weeks that admiration has turned into something deeper. Likewise, Dinah believes that in me she has met her true soulmate. She now considers it would be unfair for her to marry Lestrade knowing that her affections are engaged elsewhere. The licence had been reissued in my name. As everything else is in place we saw no reason to wait or change the arrangements.”
The exact circumstances regarding Captain Watson’s injury are a mystery, particularly how the doctor came to be on patrol that day. However as an acknowledged marksman, his superior officers were known to regard him as a useful man to have on board in any situation.
“Pay no attention to Sherlock, Inspector; he got out of bed the wrong side this morning. I’ll make sure I pick an evening you are free. You can’t leave me to entertain with Scrooge on my own.”
“They have not been contacted. His Grace expressly forbade any outside intervention.”
“Both hands my dear, just so.” Mr Fell started fussing round her, and Mary dropped her handbag to accommodate him. “Right, let’s take a look in the mirror.”
Sherlock had placed his hands together during Mr Fell’s tale, in the prayer position, and while he appeared to be listening carefully this was a sure sign to John that the detective considered the case a three at best.
“What?” The man (client? whatever?) was staring fiercely at Sherlock, “What the hell is that about?”
“Woo-hoo!” Mrs Hudson was at the door, all agog at the sight of Sherlock in John’s arms. The two men jumped apart as if caught in the act of something far less innocent than dancing.
“I imagine she knew what she was doing.”
Subdued, Sherlock fell behind Steve as he led the way through the chasm. It began as a very tall passage, the walls of which were coated with a film of minerals that glittered in the light of the torches that Sherlock would have found intriguing under different circumstances. Instead he focused on following Steve’s light as he carefully negotiated the smooth rock path further into the cave, just as John appeared from a second tunnel some three hundred metres north-west of Goliath’s gate.
Harry is delighted to hear from him. “Johnny!” she exclaims before launching into an excited prattle about how amazing it is that he should call at this precise moment in her life.
“Really?” Sherlock looked at John in surprise, it had been so long since he had been on the receiving end of praise from the doctor.
The caller ignored his negative response and carried on speaking, until Mycroft, unused to being ignored was forced to elucidate “I’m afraid I must decline your kind offer.”
A shadow passes over John’s visage; he thinks of his forthcoming medical board. Time to face the facts.
in a row, he needed to get a grip.
“Quite sure.”
Steve immediately pulled over and they waited for Danny to catch up, it was a few minutes before the boy appeared. His face was pink from the cold air, and despite being young and athletic, he was panting with exertion.
Mycroft gestured towards Anthea who produced a folder and handed it to Sherlock. Sherlock took the folder and opened it, scowling at the photograph inside while his brother droned on.
The grip tightens. “Seriously… you must let me go.”
Flicking on the hall light to see the stairs Sherlock spotted two parallel tyre tracks on the tiles, slightly smudged, a Silver Cross Avia Stroller… John!
Sherlock looked up at where the outline of John was.
By Sunday afternoon John was ready to climb the walls, the rain had left off a little and he was preparing to take Rosie out for some much-needed fresh air. Normally, Sherlock would join them if he wasn’t engrossed in some experiment, so John knocked on his bedroom door. There was no answer, so after he’d knocked again, John tentatively opened the door.
There was no point trying to get out of it, the car would sit there idling and blocking up the traffic for as long as it took him to concede defeat. Sherlock reluctantly put his socks and shoes, slipped out of his dressing gown and into his jacket, coat and scarf, pausing only to retrieve his phone before going downstairs.
“Ok then,” John challenged after their order had been taken. “Who do you think they are?”
Sherlock acknowledge the comment with a subtle nod,
******
He glanced at himself in the tiny bathroom mirror and decided on a shave after all.
Hands up, I admit the surname of Lestrade's fiancée  is a total cop out in the grand scheme to once again use the prompt for the day as the last word of the chapter, but it has been a long week,

“Your traditional values took you into medicine and the army and is reflected in the way you look and dress, and your order of apple pie and custard for dessert, your maverick tendencies are revealed in the fact the apple pie is made with cinnamon roll not pastry. You were wearing a rugby shirt when we met, not a fashion item but a team shirt from a non-league side, I would imagine with your build you would be a fly-half. You’re not close to your family in that you would rather spend the last few days before deployment with friends than with them. You’re not abstentious, you’ve had wine with our meal, but you don’t like drunkenness as I could tell in the pool hall the other night. Gambling however has its attractions, there was a wistful note in your voice when you talked about the casino. Our coffee is on its way, and the girlfriend I overheard your friends teasing you about the day we met was called Lucy.”
The kind of error that comes naturally when you spend an extended period of time away from home. The mistaken belief that while you are away, whether it is for six months, a year or a decade, that the place you left behind will remain static, frozen in time.

at the
Juanita who turned out not to be from Spain or even Argentina but was instead born and bred in the East End and travelled daily into work no further than from Leytonstone. Disappointed not to have a chance to exercise his excellent Spanish, Sherlock proceeded to interrogate the cleaner on the subject of the missing key.
“But for some reason you couldn’t let him go, and you cannot fool me that it was concern for his immortal soul that caused you to trace him here and to make his life a misery, jeopardising and ultimately destroying the happiness he had found with a man whom he loved and respected. Bringing about the death of that noble man and driving the man you claimed to love to suicide. That’s what you will have to answer for.”
Harry has let him down many, many times since infancy but never has he felt so utterly betrayed.
“I think they hoped they had killed you, or your injury would prove fatal.” Sherlock continued. “They had to think on their feet. The place where they discovered you had followed them was right by the access track to the Ragged Shaw. They dumped you in the back of the truck and drove up as close as possible to the mouth of the cave, then I think they carried you in as far as they could, using the rug you had round your shoulders when you emerged as a kind of stretcher. They made the mistake of underestimating your resilience… and the thickness of your skull.”
The fire had died down and with the television and the lights off, the room was almost in darkness, perfect conditions for thinking so Sherlock retreated to his Mind Palace and the rooms where he kept his information on John. Sherlock had spent a lot of time in this wing of the palace over the past years, but his visits had become more frequent ever since he deduced that John was intending to move out of Baker Street. Every nook and cranny of the rooms had been investigated fully in the hope of finding some resolution to the present difficulty, but none had been discovered. The issue was simply that John’s room would not be big enough for the two Watsons for very much longer. His own room was larger but even that wouldn’t be practical for long. Sherlock had offered to move into flat C, but John wouldn’t hear of it. Sherlock was disappointed and relieved at the same time.
Sherlock returns to 221b and finds and unwelcome visitor
“I am sure. It happened while I was on leave in the summer, I wouldn’t usually take time off in the high season, but my daughter had a baby and I had a week off to help her. My grandson was four in June. It was when I came back to work afterwards that I found the key was missing.”
Over time, Mycroft has been minded to engage his brother in several cases with features of interest. Sherlock has been minded to complain of their dullness and in due course draw them to a satisfactory conclusion.
“She is wearing a considerable amount of valuable jewellery, the pearls round her neck for instance are genuine, as are her rings including the square cut emerald and the diamond cluster on her right hand, however on the left there’s only a small diamond solitaire but significantly it is worn on her third finger.”
Mr King looked at his wife and then at Sherlock. “The only Elrige I know of around here is Joe Elrige who farms over by East Ruston, that’s about fifteen miles away.”
(Both Molly and Mrs Holmes had brought the sweetest of party dresses for Rosie to wear. Rosie neatly dealt with this diplomatic incident by spilling juice while wearing the first and needing to change halfway through the evening thus appearing in the photographs in both outfits.
“I don’t find that amusing.”
It occurred to Sherlock that nearly an hour had passed and perhaps he should reply to John. He thought about going upstairs, but suddenly shy (although he told himself that it was due to a desire not to disturb Watson). Mind made up, he quickly typed.
He'd collected Rosie from nursery around five and picked up a takeaway on the way home. Now in the sitting room of 221b, replete and relaxed he was looking forward to a night of crap telly, maybe even a Bond film, without a running commentary from you know who.
“Just saving time. Yes, I have always known I am bisexual. No, Mycroft isn’t the first. No, I don’t miss tits. Will it last? I hope so!”
Instead, you return to find an infinite number of mostly minor changes that accumulate to show you just how wrong you are. The hardware shop across the road is now a pawnbroker’s; the branch of Lloyd’s bank on the corner of Lisson Grove has been a vegan restaurant for over a year; the 84 bus no longer goes down the Marylebone Road; myriad changes that disorientate you and sweep the ground from beneath your feet.
Then the stranger said, “What will you give me if I help you?”
“I didn’t think that.”
“Never mind.” Mrs Hudson knew better than to come between her boys and a case, “You’ll have a lovely time won’t you Rosie, helping Nana deck the halls.”
“Do sit down. You were not always Mr. Hilton-Cubitt I believe; you added your husband’s name to your own upon your marriage.”
a little darker episode
“Three minutes,” John checks his own watch.
John who had been listening to Sherlock’s ramblings while simultaneously amazed and wondering if he had unconsciously expressed his thoughts aloud earlier said with a start. “They’ve gone to the arcade” Then added tightly “We’re not joined at the hip”
“I don’t know,” John shrugged “I suppose I still wasn’t entirely convinced you weren’t up to one of your tricks.”
“The one that named her niece Mary Sutherland as the sole residual legatee.”
Sherlock could tell Ruth was intrigued but she tactfully said nothing, her son however had no reservations. “Go on see what you make of Mum”
Startled, Mycroft asked “What are you doing?”
“Certainly, Madam.” The butler replied and then bent to whisper something in Dinah’s ear. She  seemed to frown very briefly before turning to John and Sherlock and smiling.
“Let me think.” Sherlock put his hands over his ears and closed his eyes, “Quiet both of you”, he barked the order to the astonishment of his silent companions. “Just think, you have successfully abducted a boy but you’ve unwittingly gained a witness, you knock him out, kill him even but now you have a body on your hands, one that you don’t want discovered too quickly if at all so you and your accomplice… yes… you have to have had an accomplice, you couldn’t have overcome John on your own… you and your accomplice put the body in the car…”
“What did you really see?” Ruth asked.
“You didn’t go through it?”
Much later, lying awake in his bunk in the early hours of the morning, listening to Marcus’ gentle snoring, Lestrade thought of all those inconvenient subjects in the past who had been banished to the far corners of the kingdom as punishment by their lords and masters. It certainly felt like banishment to him, as the train rattled northwards, dashing through the snow.
“I suspect Watson’s fine motor skills are yet to be sufficiently developed to assist you.”
Lestrade succeeded in sloping of early on Friday afternoon. It was a quiet day the end of a relatively quiet week. Lestrade wondered if Mycroft had taken time to arrange that to his advantage, if not, then whoever
“Gracious,” cried the inspector. “How ever did you see that?”
“Sherlock, has someone been mean to you?”
They turned back to their respective screens and started searching. John found Hermione Etherege quickly, in fact he was soon inundated with pages and pages of results. She appeared to be the most prolific creator of lurid historical romances, all purple prose and heaving bosoms, with names like
“You’re soaked, come and sit down,” he told her turning to Sherlock, “Do you have any towels?”
With bad grace, Sherlock went into the back room and fetched a towel.
The unmitigated tedium of his everyday existence, without the violin or other stimulant.
Sherlock was personally affronted at her interruption of his conversation with the intriguing doctor and was about to tell her again to go away, but he had reckoned without the chivalry of his companion.
“Yes, he runs the surf shop on Dune Road.”
Crowley said, “I thought you wanted to win this game?”
John grinned and Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief; the danger had passed.
Sherlock released a breath he hadn’t realised he had been holding. “I am very glad to hear it”
Mr Chatterjee, once more in favour, appeared with platefuls of sandwiches and savouries, and said he would see them later. John cautioned Sherlock to behave “He’s a widower and his family come from Dhaka, stop winding the poor woman up”.
“Who told you that?”
Sweet Sherlock,
“Whenever you start saying my name like that…”
“If he’d wanted you to see him, he would have allowed you to see him but it was unnecessary. And, at the time, no one had been close enough to determine that you were a Dhamphir much less that you were clueless about your own nature. We were probably more surprised than you at this turn of events.”
“You’re even nuttier than the last time I saw you. Where’s John?!”
“Well, I do. I’m sure that you know where I live. Don’t bother contacting me again. Goodbye Sherlock.” John left, slamming the door behind him followed by a quick run down the steps and slamming the front door too.
“How is that news? That was always going to be the way this ended.”
“Are you?” John swallowed the next glass and reached for the bottle which Sherlock easily pulled away from him.
“Fine. I’ll give you that one. But a couple of blokes having it off together is quite different than taking a cock up one’s arse. You can see that in your logical brain, can’t you?”
“Anything else?” Sherlock asked, tired of all of these questions.
“Sebastian!’
“Not yet. But I shall…”
“You’re ridiculous,” Mycroft said but without real heat.
“Ah, well, I’m about to cut you open - just a small cut - and install a CV Port near your collar bone. I wish you weren’t going to be awake when I start but considering that it’s now 11:30pm, I can’t take the chance of Sherlock coming to the rescue before I’ve finished.”
"As if you working with Scotland Yard to find murderers isn't a job," scoffed Mycroft.
Picking up said object, John thrust the rounded tip into the jelly rocking it back and forth, coating the device generously.
Stuffing his mobile back into his inside jacket pocket, Sherlock stared intently at the hospital entrance from his vantage point across the street where he’d been sitting for hours. ‘I’m not breaking any rules,’ he told himself. John said that he didn’t to be walked home for awhile and he was honoring that request while taking advantage of a loophole: John had said that he didn’t want to see Sherlock for awhile but he hadn’t said anything about Sherlock being in the area and so Sherlock would remain unseen.
“As do I, Doctor. As do I.”
“Me either,” Sherlock said, with a twinge and rubbed his arse.
“Wait! Where are you going?” John asked nervously.
“It’s not like he’s a contortionist. His foot was clearly disjointed, cut off at the ankle and forced into his mouth. What’s your professional opinion, Doctor?”
His mobile buzzed and he pulled it out, checking the text as he hurried along.
Giving Sherlock a remorseful look, John pulled the script up and flipping to the last page, began to read aloud;
“You won’t get me out of here that easily, young man!”
“Not now, Mycroft.”
Sebastian made the cut and then began feeding the catheter through the vein towards John’s heart. Pausing, he looked John in the eyes and said;
“Hands and knees! Do it!” John said, applying a stinging slap to Sherlock’s buttocks simultaneously.
John, his brain at war with his cock, just stared dumbly at Sherlock, saying nothing.
“I’m very cautious and the area will be well sterilized before I begin. Afterwards, I’ll cover the Port with a waterproof bandage to keep the incision clean but once you get to the boss, we’ll be using sterile bandages between drinks until the Port heals.
“I’m sure that the cleaner’s is well versed in removing come stains from clothes. We are in the heart of London, after all.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll pick up her slack if you destroy anything.”
4:30am, 221B Baker Street
“Thank god for expensive robes and underweight detectives. I wouldn’t have been able to do this to anyone else. And you didn’t even fight back,” John said, pulling Sherlock back by the hair and baring his lovely pale neck.
“Yes, Jim.”
“Closed for…John, I want you now. Wake up!” Sherlock demanded, shaking him.
“So wasss this for,” Sherlock gestured weakly to the IV hanging on his bedpost.
John tossed him the mobile.
Taking Sherlock’s cock in one hand, John guided it slowly into his mouth, enjoying the silky feel of his skin as it moved past his lips, across his tongue until he has taken it in as far as possible.
“You don’t even know what I was about to ask,” Sherlock said, frustrated.
“How…how long…” Sherlock asked, just barely hanging on.
“Sherlock…um…” John began uncomfortably.
“Coming!” Becca said, rushing to exit the flat.
“How the hell would you know that?!”
“Ah. So you’re gay then. Which is fine.”
“I’m interested in letting you try to penetrate me.”
John was a quiet child who tried to keep himself out of everyone’s way and bring as little attention to himself as possible. He’d noticed that he had more accidents when his sister, Harriet was around so he tried to avoid her at all costs. It was just easier and safer that way.
John stopped and put his head back and rolled his eyes. Giving an exasperated sigh, he turned back to Sherlock and said;
“Open for business tomorrow though,” and fell back into a deep sleep, a satisfied smile upon his lips.
“You’re working late tonight, Doctor Watson. Important case?” Sebastian asked, pushing the hazardous waste cart against the wall preparing to chat.
John stopped what he was doing and looking up at Sherlock, asking suspiciously; “And just how would you know that?”
“Go away, John!” Sherlock yelled.
He tried looking around the room but his eyesight was still blurry from the sedation and he couldn’t quite make out his surroundings. Had he been in an accident?
"Oh. This is going to be good."
"I am not cheating, Sherlock. You're just god awful at this game. HAH! Paper beats rock!" John exclaimed, putting his hand over Sherlock's fist.
“Well, first of all I wasn’t joking, Moron. What’s a few more minutes. If he’s dead, he’s not going to get any deader.”
“Nope but here come medical services, on time as usual. Good thing their patient has already expired. I’ll get some gloves from them and be right back,” Lestrade said walking towards the ambulance currently pulling up to the curb.
John,
“What about John’s life? He’d better be alive or Moriarty will experience pain like he never has in his life,” Sherlock bit out.
“Apparently tomorrow’s going to be a busy day,” John said resignedly.
Sherlock threw his mobile across the room in a fit of anger. It hit the back of the couch with a heavy “thump” sliding down between the cushions. Sherlock hurried over and anxiously dug it out. He couldn’t let his temper get in the way of getting information about John. Especially if it was from Moriarty.
After watching Sherlock struggle to get to his feet without the use of his hands, John once again grabbed the silk cord binding his wrists and yanked up forcing a quick moan of pain from Sherlock.
“They’re not as motivated as I am, Mycroft, and you know it. Address. Please?” Sherlock asked, his voice hitching a bit on the last word.
“Yes, dear. I know. But, Mycroft?”
“Ok Neely. I’ve got some bad news for you…” Becca stopped reading a minute to wiggle her bottom closer into the chair, brought her feet up and rested the book on her knees.
“You were fortunate that your uterus was able to removed without abdominal surgery,” the doctor assured John warmly.
“Really?” John asked, curling his fingers against Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock moaned and pressed his cock against the duvet.
“I don’t need a babysitter. I’ll call you when I get home.” John walked through the bedroom door, picked up his coat from the coat rack without even a backwards glance at Sherlock.
“Hello.”
“I really do love you, you know,” John said, placing a kiss on the palm of each of hand.
Sherlock’s Flat
“What are you going to do with those?”
“What?”
“You know I’m a professional, Mycroft. Always label your work for the next person. Some HIPPA thing I think. I don’t know. I just do it because it’s polite.”
Bruises? Kids get bruises, they’re clumsy. What about Lawrence? He hardly has any bruises. He just has better balance.
“I’m on it!” John said eagerly, sore muscles forgotten caused by his appreciation of the magnitude of Sherlock’s gift.
“I said, I’m not a bloody alcoholic. It’s not my kind of high. It’s not that I can’t drink, I just don’t,” Sherlock got out between clenched teeth.
“I’m having trouble feeling anything besides this pain in my shoulder,” Anderson said, tears coming to his eyes.
“Come on. Tell me this isn’t romantic.” John said, kissing Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock turned onto his side and nestled into John’s arms.
They were all wealthy and had had important positions in government, and commerce.
Sherlock remained motionless on the bed, every muscle in his body quivering with excitement.
“Well, fuck face? What’s so bloody important that it can’t wait until morning, you insufferable twat?”
“Shouldn’t you be working on that murder case now?
‘I’ve got you now, Moriarty,’ Sherlock thought, hurriedly pulling on his coat and scarf. Taking the steps two at a time, Sherlock exited the building, the lighted windows of 221 Baker Street rapidly receding behind him as he rushed out into the dark night to find John Watson.
Using his other hand to flip through a few pages of the script, John said;
“It’s very wide. It starts out narrow which is what opened up your skin and allowed the wider piece to continue on before it broke off. It’s fairly impressive, actually. I’ve never seen anything like this before.” John said, sounding slightly in awe.
Let me repeat: I wrote this all in one go. I have not reread it but I hope for the best. If there are errors - and I'm sure there are - no sense complaining about them because this story is all a blur and I probably won't know what you're talking about.
“Hell NO it’s not comfortable! Just get on with it.”
Sherlock walked to meet John at the hospital entrance. He looked tired and no wonder! He should have been done and out by 12:30am at the latest.
“Here you go.” Lestrade walked up, exam gloves in a sterile wrapper and handing them to John who had reached for them at the same time as Sherlock Holmes. Both held onto opposite ends of the packet trying to stare the other down.
“Ivy is not plain. It symbolizes fidelity. Ivy is deceptively strong; once it’s attached itself to something it won’t easily let go. Reminds me of someone.”
“Ok. I might be a little gay. You just, you just smelled so good and suddenly I had to have you. You were irresistible. Is it always like this?”
“Oh, why not! I thought that you cared about me.” Moriarty pouted.
“I need a favor…”
“Very,” Sherlock replied, eyes now closed.
There was no reply for so long that John wasn’t sure that Harriet hadn’t just disconnected.
“Indeed they are and I’ll thank you not to mock them, John.” Sherlock said seemingly popping up out of nowhere, surprising John while Lestrade calmly took another drink, eternally unperturbed and unsurprised by the lunatics’ sudden appearances.
“That’s ok…”
"Then why must you persist in seeking out the people causing these pointless murders? You're only saving people who are going to die anyway. Isn't that what you're saying? Hmmm?"
He’s made himself the unofficial protector of his coworkers. He fusses over them. Makes sure that they’re healthy and god forbid that anyone hurt one of his ‘boys.’ He handles those types of situations immediately but he couldn’t do anything about this without the cooperation of the concerned parties so he suggested a solution.”
My text wasn’t cut off at the end. XOXO is an acronym for kisses and hugs.
Stopping suddenly, John looked up at Sherlock and said;
“Well, if my people couldn’t find anything and the great Sherlock Holmes couldn’t find anything either, it’s obvious that John was taken from a blind spot in the camera coverage.”
John couldn’t understand why no one could see the truth. Mummy was always distracted, she worked as a maid six days a week and didn’t have time for him. Although he did notice that she had time for Lawrence.
Looking uncomfortable, Sherlock didn’t reply.
“Yes. Please. Don’t stop. I want you so much!”
“I told you, Sherlock. We’re acting out the script. Right. Now.”
Sherlock
“That’s a little more difficult depending on whom you’re talking to and which religion they believe in. Oh! Can silver burn me?!” John, feeling a little devilish, interjected.
“Five minutes? Really? I doubt that,” Sherlock laughed.
“The baby’s looking for comfort. You could try suckling him. It might change how you feel. You might be able to bond with him.”
“Bet you wiillll,” Becca said in a sing song voice.
“Just read it to me and tell me what’s left to do. I hope that no movement is required. I don’t think that my legs could support me at this point.
Well, this kind of thinking wasn’t getting him anywhere. Especially considering that Jim had probably killed John by now. Just that thought alone had Sebastian pick up his already hurried pace.
“You laid hands on John first. And let’s not forget why that happened. You were attempting to attack Sherlock and although I don’t think that you would have faired any better had you reached him, I’d think that you would have realized by now that anyone who tries to hurt Sherlock is going to have to go through John first. Sherlock’s only likely to stop you, no more, no less, but piss off John? Well, let’s just say that his self-control right now is pretty impressive given how angry he is at the moment.”
“It really is. It’s bloody awful!”
“Ok. That’s enough. Let's get back to business.” John said, gritting his teeth.
“I wanted you to fuck me in public. No warning. No prep. No…uh…ohhhh…request…just…thissssssss….” Sherlock sighed.
“Don’t worry about it. I actually consider it a bribe to get you to take a moment to enjoy a conversation with you. Believe me, bringing you a cup of cheap vending machine coffee is a great exchange. You’re doing me a favor by taking the time to talk.” Sebastian said, taking another sip of his coffee.
“I’m going to pack up my stuff and leave. There’s no way that dad will take this better than Harry.” John stood up and started emptying everything in his chest of drawers into the duffel he kept beneath the bed.
“How do you think I am and why is that thing still here? I told them to get rid of it.”
When John finally came back to earth, he asked Sherlock;
Sherlock looked up again. Did…yes, Watson was closer now and Sherlock hadn’t seen him move. That was…disturbing. How could he have missed that?
“Oh, what now? I swear that you could spoil a dead man’s wet dream.”
“You said that Doctor Watson would ‘handle’ the clients. Did he accomplish this through violence?” Sherlock asked, completely ignoring Irene’s last comment.
“I’m sorry. You were telling me who you were,” John tried again.
“How are you feeling, Sherlock?”
“Yeah. I think she would. You were like a son to her, you know.”
“Ok. Ok.” Sherlock panted.
“Well, he did connect me with an apiary that was willing to sell a small, established hive to me.”
“Well, hurry up then! We’ll meet you at the car,” Mr Watson answered without stopping.
John looked through the curtain in 221B and watched Sherlock step gracefully from the back of Mycroft Holmes’ black limo. He did not look happy.
“Try again!” John demanded.
"You might consider locking the door if you're going to do something like...that." Lestrade said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of where John and Sherlock currently sat, nude, on the rug in front of a roaring fire.
John was beginning to suspect why Sherlock was so nervous. Time to test that theory out.
“I wasn’t aware that there was going to be a quiz.”
“How would you feel about leaving all of this,” Sherlock said, gesturing around the room, “And helping me in my work? There’s a spare bedroom in my flat that yours if you want it.” Sherlock waited for John’s response nervously.
And, for the love of God, use a condom this time!
"Rock, Paper, Scissors, again? Sherlock, you never win at this game," Mrs Hudson tskd.
“What did you do about it?”
“Looks like trouble in paradise,” Moriarty said with glee.
Anderson wiggled his fingers again.
He felt Sherlock’s fingers tighten in his hair and smiled as he pulled off of his cock with a suckle followed by another kiss. Looking up at Sherlock from beneath his lashes, John asked,
“It’s not supposed to be enjoyable for you. You’re not being submissive so much as subsumed by my character’s need to abuse you.” John removed his hand and sat back waiting for Sherlock to say something. Anything.
"Just get on with it," Sherlock said, feigning boredom.
“Ready?” John asked, Sherlock met his eyes nervously and gave a brief nod of his head but John had already scooped out a generous amount of the jelly, spreading Sherlock’s cheeks with his other hand.
“Why does it take so long to leave? What could you possibly be doing in there that couldn’t wait until tomorrow? It’s not like you’re saving lives.”
“How much later?” Sherlock asked, increasing his rhythm.
“This is crazy. You don’t even know me.”
Sherlock
“No sir. I won’t,” Sebastian said and hurried from the room before Jim decided that he wanted dessert too.
“It’s our house, John, and I want him to stay.” Mrs Watson said firmly.
“Awe. You’re no fun,” Becca said coming to stand in front of Sherlock.
Baker Street
“Sherlock, this is John Watson. I’m sure that you’ll have a pleasurable night. Champagne is on the house, a chilled bottle is being sent up as we speak. Enjoy yourselves gentlemen,” she said, turning to leave.
Monday
“Fine,” she said angrily. “Ask and then never call me again.”
“About this “Dhamphir” thing. Mind telling me what that’s supposed to mean?” John asked, deciding to continue humoring the man.
“John?” Sherlock whispered.
“Entering me? With your fist?” Sherlock asked, perplexed.
John moved into position.
“Oops. Sorry. Here, help me stand you up so that I can sit you on the bed. We’re going to end up there anyway.” John laughed.
“Nope. Nope. That’s not going to fit. I release you from our contract!” Sherlock said magnanimously.
“I love you too, Sherlock.” John smiled.
“Are they? And what’s so obvious about them?” Sherlock asked, a smirk on his lips.
“I swear I feel like we’ve had this chat before.”
“If you’re so keen on it, do it yourself. Go ahead. I’ll wait.” Sherlock said, brushing a nonexistent piece of dust off of his naked chest.
“Yes. Yes. Adopted back into the family. His mother is also his aunt. Abused by his mother as a child. Again, this is nothing that I didn’t already know.”
“Why? Because you’re delicious, Doctor Watson, and my Seb here was kind enough to bring me some Dhamphir carryout. I just love him to pieces!” Moriarty said, suddenly appearing at John’s head.
“Heat? What heat? I don’t have a uterus.”
“Still angry,” but his speech had slowed down considerably.
“Head DOWN!” John yelled and Sherlock instantly obeyed.
“What’s that?”
“There!” John said as he tied off and cut the last suture.
“It’s six o’clock in the fucking morning! Someone had better be dead! Who the fuck is this?”
Closing the front door behind him, Sherlock put his hand out and grasped the doorknob to Mrs Hudson’s flat. John stopped and watched him.
“You’ve hidden it here somewhere and I’m going to find it, my lovable menace.” John commenced looking under the bed. Between the mattress and boxspring; there were only so many places that Sherlock could have hidden it before John had gotten him into bed.
“Stop it, John! Stop it right this instant and act like an adult!”
Shrugging on his jacket, John turned giving Sherlock a long look from head to toe.
“What’s that?” Sherlock asked, looking up.
“It’s amazing. You’re amazing! It feels so good! I wish it could go on forever!” Sherlock said desperately.
“Fuck or be fucked. Seems simple enough.”
“Fine, but if I end up murdered with a note pinned to my tongue, you’ll only have yourself to blame.” John said, disconnecting the call without waiting to hear Sherlock’s response.
“Mind the…”
“Well, you do now. Let’s step over here and discuss this further,” John said, gesturing to a nearby alley.
Jim, finally opened his eyes and gave Moran his best puppy dog look.
“Right, right. Sorry. I must be a little more excited than I thought.”
“What? I guess so.” They stepped outside closing Harriet’s door behind them.
“Yes, everyone loves me there. They told you about the baby?”
“Right here,” John said, throwing it on the bed with the rest.
“Ah. You’re right, darling. I did. Goodnight sweetheart,” Sebastian said, brushing Jim’s hair from his forehead and placing a kiss there.
“Really? I must say that you hide your intelligence very well. One would never guess that you had something going on in that silver head of yours.”
’Sherlock, you’d better be right about this or I’ll kill you myself.’
“John. Oh my god! I’m going to come. Fuck me! Harder! Harder!”
“FUCK!! FUCK!! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!!” Anderson screamed.
“Yeah. That’s great. That helps how? Who will want to bond with a sterile Omega?” John put his head down so that the doctor couldn’t see the tears in his eyes.
John sat still, staring at Mycroft, mouth agape, saying nothing.
“No, I’ve never had my arse eaten before.”
John growled in frustration until he realized something; Sherlock was accessing his mobile through his iPad. John took out the mobile and said,
“Yeah, a Dhamphir friends with a vampire? I don’t think so. Why were you even there?” Sherlock demanded.
“Can’t type. Tired of waiting. Stroking my cock now. I’d hurry if I were you.
Although you wouldn’t know to look at him, Sherlock Holmes could barely contain his excitement. He thought that this case was easily an eight, possibly a nine, and he was beside himself with joy. The past few months had been deadly dull and despite Lestrade throwing him a metaphorical bone from time to time to keep his mind occupied, it wasn’t enough to stop his ever increasing craving for oblivion. He just wanted to get high and stay high until something interesting finally came along. Unfortunately, Lestrade and Sherlock’s twat of a brother were keeping close tabs on him.
Mrs Watson bit her thumb and nervously looked behind her but Mr Watson and Harriet were long gone.
“John, may I ask you a question about the murders?”
“Darling? It’s worse than we thought,” Becca said into her mobile.
Sherlock sat on the rooftop of 221B gazing intently at humanity as it walked along below, filling their limited lives with unimportant things for unimportant people and was annoyed by it all.
“I’d like you to move in with me.” *kiss*
“And, what type of…service does he perform here? Jack of all trades?”
“Oh. Not always. Sometimes…well, he’s a genius, you know and they can be peculiar sometimes…”
John stood up, glaring at Sherlock.
“Here you go.” Sebastian said, hands full of sugar packets, placing them in front of John on his desk.
He didn’t open the door completely; just enough to squeeze himself through the narrow opening he’d made. Why he thought that would make a difference, he didn’t know.
“Well, that’s possible in the language of flowers, a red chrysanthemum represents ‘love.’”
“And how can I help you, Mr Holmes?” John asked.
“But John! I have questions!”
“You’re pretty on a good day but I had no idea how lovely you’d be with tears in your eyes begging me to stop hurting you. I have to finish your beating but I won’t add anymore strikes. All you need to do is what you’ve been doing. Begging and pleading, and it’ll be over. Understand?” John raised his hand again.
“Oh, well, that’s good then. Proves you already know me.”
“”One hundred years,” eh?” John laughed again. “Seriously, how old are you really.”
“Just tell me what you’ve found before I do something that you’ll regret,” John seethed. His anger did seem a little over the top. Maybe he really should just go to bed…
“Well, that’s something, I guess,”
“Your reaction seems to be a little over the top for an army medical doctor. Seen a lot of action, have you?”
“I don’t think that I would,” Sherlock replied.
“If you say so. Well, case closed. I’m off.”
Yours in health,
Sherlock,
“Lord, no. He’s been relatively sticking to our, my agreement, plus he’s extremely over-protective and jealous. I don’t know what he’d do if he saw another man near me much less touching me.”
“Come on, John. I don’t want to hurt you. How would that look? Me beating up a cripple? I don’t even have a problem with you.”
Suddenly there was a loud crash followed up by a shout of “FUCK” from around the corner. John and Sherlock froze, staring at each other.
“John! I can’t hold it anymore! Come with me! Please! Can you come with me?”
“Yes dear. I know.”
“If you landed on something sharp and it hit the right spot, then yes, it’d kill you,” Sherlock was tired of answering the same questions that they’d already been over for what seemed like a million times.
The bartender sat Harriet’s pint in front of her and she took a big gulp wiping the foam off of her lips with the back of her hand and began to speak…
“John! You have no idea what this means to me! Don’t tell Mycroft but…I’ve always felt as though I was missing my other half. Well, I wouldn’t exactly say ‘missing’ but I knew something was out there for me…”
Eventually, it came to pass that John was so good at making himself invisible, he was considered a nuisance when he could be seen. If he had a question, he got the standard “children should be seen and not heard.” But they listened to Lawrence who now picked up Harriet’s slack in his abuse.
“I think so, Mrs Hudson but we’ll know for certain in…”
John reacted instinctively, pulling Sherlock closer to him and deepening the kiss.
“Danger, you say? How dangerous?”
“You keep calling him ‘Doctor Watson’. Is he actually a doctor or is that an appellation bestowed upon him by your staff?” Sherlock asked. His ears were still red and a faint flush had begun to rise up his chest towards his neck.
John and Sherlock looked at each other and smiled.
We love you too, Mrs. H. We love you too.
Sherlock moaned but quickly silenced himself.
Raising himself up on his elbows, Sherlock turned to page 15 and began to read.
“Of course I can!” Sherlock snapped, turning his head around to glare at John. “That doesn’t change the fact that someone’s watching us!”
“Aren’t you looking for a flat?”
Beads of sweat had begun to appear on Sherlock’s forehead, his breath becoming shallow. John realized that his cock had gotten hard as well, without him noticing and now he was wide awake and thinking about just bending Sherlock over and fucking him right then and there.
“You’re repeating yourself a lot today, dear,” Mrs Hudson said. Sherlock gave her a cutting look which did absolutely nothing to dull the twinkle in her eye.
"That was not a Limerick, John," Sherlock said primly.
Sherlock
“Admit defeat, John. I’ll be out when I’m damn good and ready,” Sherlock said, then began speaking in a normal tone of voice to someone.
"Oh for god's sake, make up your mind," he grouches. Then, interested at the prospect of going home continues with, "Who needs me this time?"
A few minutes later- his sense of time is slipping, the drugs finally kicking in- one of the flight attendant steps in front of him with a phone in hand.
, which is:
"Hello, Sherlock," she says, smiling brightly and fluttering her eyelashes. Sherlock smiles in what she hopes is a charming manner and ignores the man at the counter
. Then John smiles
- Sherlock -
Holmes
John covers Sherlock's hands on his face with this own, thumbs smoothing over the backs of them, and Sherlock sobs a bit into their kiss, eyes burning and tears collecting under his eyelashes. John echos it back to him, hands sliding under his armpits to haul him to standing, then moving back to rest one on the back of his neck and the other in the center of his spine. Sherlock's shaking hands stroke John's cheekbones, feeling the moisture and wiping it away.
? Now that John's seen it, it's like it's written into Sherlock's very DNA, he's absolutely
John's head is down, his hands completely steady except for his left one, which is anxiously clenching and unclenching. His breathing is harsh and his eyes are squeezed shut, brows knitted, and mouth twisted small. He looks defeated. Oh no.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you alright?" He drops his hands to Sherlock's shoulders and rubs- down to his elbows, up to his neck- as his eyes skitter across Sherlock's features.
"Well I certainly hope you've learned your lesson." Sherlock can hear the fake smile he's wearing as he says it and rolls his eyes. "As it turns out, you're needed."
"What are you doing? Let her go. Hey!" The woman smacks the back of his head.
"Wh-"
"You alright?"
unreadable book. Completely." He sits up enough to push Watson onto his back and climb on top of him, snuffling into his neck as Watson plants a kiss beside his ear.
Kudos would be hella awesome and comments, devine!
“The symbolism of the powders. Each color represents something. The man who did this understood that and although Holi is a celebration of happiness, he made some pointed references with his choice of colors.”
“What are you doing?” John asked. Not quite nervous, only curious.
“GodDAMN it! MOTHER FUCKER! What did you do?!
“I don’t want to do anything against your will, Sherlock. Are you willing?” John said, stroking Sherlock’s cock.
Eventually, daddy developed a temper. He went to work angry and came home later and later, smelling funny. The one thing that John knew was not to get his father's attention. He’d been beaten with a belt several times and on other occasions, the wooden cutting board because it was the closest thing to hand. John was black and blue constantly and no one questioned how it had happened anymore. It became ‘normal’.
“Not if my life depended on it,” Sherlock said with a snort.
“Ok. I guess. I still feel like I’m taking advantage of you,” John said somewhat uncomfortably, removing the lid from his coffee while Sebastian did the same.
Month One
"Ok. Enjoy being the bottom then," John smiled, reaching for the lube.
“’Sherlock?’ ‘Mycroft?’ What kind of weird ass names are those? Are they really their first names?”
Sherlock had an idea but he knew John wasn’t ready to learn about Soul Mates so he said nothing.
“Thanks, doc. Goodbye.”
“That you’d…that you’d…penetrate me with your fist,” and here he lowered his voice as if someone was listening in, “In my anus?” He finished lamely.
John laughed and continued in his ministrations until he finally began sucking on Sherlock’s cock.
Until then.
- JW”
“Why?” Sherlock asked now looking suspicious.
“Yes but I’m afraid that this will be my last attempt unless things can end to my satisfaction.”
Suddenly, it was as if a damn had burst inside Sherlock. He began shouting every thought as it entered into his mind.
TWACK!
John blushed.
“But he can’t have children and I wanted him to know that I didn’t care!”
“‘John comes inside of Sherlock and after a brief (and here, ‘brief’ was underlined) period of recuperation, sucks Sherlock’s cock to completion.’” John looked up.
“No. You can’t have your laptop…”
“Yes. Yes. Either way, this is my job now and I wanted to get an early start. This IS where I work, after all. You, on the other hand, shouldn’t even be here.”
“That wasn’t so bad now, was it?” Sherlock asked, leaning back a bit.
“Remember I told you that Sherlock finally found his mate?” Becca said.
“Doesn’t mean that Anderson has a crush on me,” Sherlock said, his cheeks pinking.
“Fine.
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling while he sifted through his thoughts.
Everybody gets busy!
“Same as usual?” She asked.
“You’re not ready to commit. I get it. I’ve been with my significant other for…well, a long time. We had our ups and downs too before we finally decided to give it a go. Oh, don’t get me wrong, we still have our ups and downs - for one thing, he’s moody as hell and has a scary temper - but he’s really a great guy the rest of the time. Lets me be myself. Doesn’t mind my hobbies. Actually. He’s very supportive of them and will offer suggestions and go out of his way to provide materials. Yeah. It was a good decision and I don’t regret it in the least. You have a roommate that you can confide in?” Sebastian asked, sensing that their conversation was coming to an end.
“Ah, yes. I need to finish you to completion. Wasn’t it?”
“F-f-f-fine!” Anderson said, flinching.
“That was…that was amazing,” John said, coming down from the high of being bitten and coming simultaneously.
“Yes. Ok. Yes. Just, try not to get anything on my trousers.”
This case. It was a complicated puzzle and he intended to enjoy it right down to its last bloody drop. To the outside world, he might seem ghoulish but inside, where it mattered, he not only recognized his ghoulishness but reveled in it.
“What changed?” Sherlock asked, sounding more alert.
“Yes. I would like to insert my penis deeply into your rectum, and out, several times until we both orgasm like what just occurred here.”
He’d heard his name called but ignored it, only picking up his pace instead. How had he been noticed? He was clearly out of practice at being invisible. That sniper had certainly seen him though.
“Oi! Who are you? You can’t just come bursting into a man’s house like that!” Moran demanded.
“See? That wasn’t so bad now, was it?”
“That’s fine, Jim. Here we go. Let’s get you out of those filthy clothes and put you to bed.” Sebastian said, hurriedly stripping Jim down to his pants and tucking him in.
“Oh yeah? Prove it then.”
Sherlock suddenly released his hold on the gloves, waiting for John to fall back from the unexpected release of tension but was surprised to see that the man had not only retained his agressive posture but hadn’t moved an inch. Military man, Sherlock noted. A Dhamphir in the armed forces? Well, stranger things had happened. He watched as John ripped the package open, cleaned his hands with the included surgical soap and slid the gloves on.
“…anal…”
Once John moved in though, he knew that he’d realize that of the two of them, Sherlock’s work was clearly the more important of the two and therefore took priority over anything John might have going on.
“I wouldn’t say ‘ashamed’. More…concerned than anything else.”
The amount of readily available alleyways in London was truly staggering at times.
“You’re thinking about doing it right now.”
His heart full of love and admiration for John, Sherlock returned the smile watching as John slowly crossed the room to his side.
“Do you trust me?”
“But…”
“I was about the disconnect the call anyway, you realize,” Sherlock said sleepily.
“Ask your questions. I’m very good at multitasking,” John said, his free hand now brushing the tip of Sherlock’s stiffening cock. And when had THAT happened?
TWACK!
“Obviously.”
"Good. Ok. Say the thing," John said shyly.
Will began to answer only to see Sherlock hold his palm up stopping his reply.
John’s brain was racing. Trying to parse everything. So… his father and his mother were his grandparents but his grandfather was also his father? His mother was now his grandmother AND his aunt? It made no sense. Then John thought a little more...so, that made Lawrence his uncle AND his cousin and his other sister, Catherine was now his half-sister and aunt? It couldn’t be true. It wasn’t just his imagination? They really HADN’T wanted him? And just what did that make him…
“I know,” John said reassuringly, putting an arm around Sherlock and walking him back to bed.
Unedited. Not Brit-picked.
“As is always the case,” John said sarcastically.
John felt the stick but it seemed far away. He didn’t think he’d left the morgue so why was someone injecting an unknown substance into his body without his permission.
“Must you allow anyone who asks, to give you drugs? Have you no sense of self-preservation? No. Of course you don’t that’s why I’m always cleaning up your messes.”
“Bastard!”
“Bob and Elizabeth Watson aren’t your real parents and Harriet isn’t your sister,” Sherlock said straight faced.
“He doesn’t look so good,” Lestrade said.
“Yes. I believe that we’ve shared enough adventures together to be on a first name basis. I wasn’t sure what the protocol was here so I maintained a professional distance. Keeping work and pleasure separated,” he said, taking her hand in his and turning her palm up to place an electric kiss on her wrist.
Following that path, John searched for and found Sherlock’s hole, slowly easing the tip of his index finger inside. Sherlock gasped, his hips stuttering briefly then he began fucking John’s hand on his own.
“Super strength?”
“…edge…” John finished lamely. He hoped that Sherlock got better quickly. Sherlock definitely couldn’t be trusted if John went out. He didn’t look forward to being trapped with a three year old for days.
“John. What are you doing?” Sherlock asked as John next began unzipping his trousers.
“The scene is muddy and I don’t want to get my coat dirty.”
“Well, that incompetent Sergeant Donovan, was going on and on about John this and John that, and you hurt John’s shoulder when you knocked him to the ground although, looking at you now, I can see that your shoulder was already hurt in the…Afghan or Iraq war? So I don’t see how I can be blamed for a preexisting condition. What about the old lady.” Sherlock looked at Lestrade, apparently considering the John matter a non-issue.
Becca stopped in the bedroom doorway, turned around and said;
“Um…you hit me with your fist and I don’t fight back? Is that what’s bothering you?” Sherlock asked.
“How do you think I handled it? I sucked their cocks then sent them on their way,” John said bluntly.
“That’s it. You like it! You like the attention. You do! That makes you no better than him! Encouraging him by meeting with him!”
“Turn over, please, John.”
“I didn’t throw it. John Watson and if someone could please help me hail a taxi so that I can get home and take care of this shoulder, I’d appreciate it.”
“Sally, please show John your badge so that he will stop thinking I’m some strange man who stages elaborate accidents to invite men to a pub.”
“Act like an adult? You’re the one playing bloody games! OW! My liver!”
“You alright, mate? Perhaps a visit to hospital wouldn’t be a bad idea. You’re white as a sheet.” Lestrade said, handing over his license which John no longer cared about.
With hard and fast strokes, John came on the mattress, relaxing into a boneless heap between Sherlock’s thigh. He licked the puncture marks closed and, with a final kiss, rested his head on Sherlock’s thigh.
“I’ll give you that one.”
“If he threatens you, John, I have to go.”
Sherlock was quiet for a few moments, the only sound his heavy breathing.
“They were obnoxious trust fund babies. All four of them had violent tempers. My employees always came away with deep purple bruises on their bodies, the pain obvious in their walk.”
“The case is solved so the party is over. For me, at least. I’m going home.” Sherlock said, turning to leave. John grabbed him by the back of his impeccably tailored jacket, because of course Sherlock would actually own a bespoke tuxedo.
John said nothing, only tapping on Sherlock’s hips impatiently waiting for him to think it through.
Molly blushed.
Baker Street
“Yes. Yes, John. I understand.”
“Knees on the seat, please.”
“How’s that?” John asked.
“That’s it! John! I’ve solved it! John?” Sherlock looked around and realized that John wasn’t there to share his brilliance. He’d really stayed in bed rather than step up to watch his genius journey to the solution. No one else could solve these mysteries. Certainly not NSY!
“God. What do you think is left?” John huffed exasperatedly.
“I’m aware of that too.”
“Should that happen, you’d be dead before his body was cold,” Sherlock said matter of factly.
