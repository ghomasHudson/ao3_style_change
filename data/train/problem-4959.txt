Bucky had been talking through everything with Sarah Rogers, all the while he knelt on the rug, he never got pins and needles, or any kind of discomfort.
Steve closed his eyes, shocked when tears rolled down his cheeks. "Bucky I love you. I always. I always loved you."
What did Bucky even have in his stomach to throw up that much? He'd been living on oatmeal and ginger ale since he woke up.
Peter stifled a laugh on the sleeve of his hoodie. He was admittedly a little bit scared of the woman. The only person alive that could properly reign in Tony Stark without so much as raising her voice.
Steve sidestepped Tony and went to sit back on the couch. His mind was racing as fast as his heart. What did he feel? It was a lot whatever it was.
Tony was having a hard time with this. This man was the reason he and Steve were at odds once again. And yet he was really an innocent party. After all, it wasn't him who kissed Steve.
Tony didn't like this. He didn't like going back to the scene of one of his greatest transgressions soon after it happened.
Bucky hated that he flinched at the sight of the suit. Hated that Peter felt it, based on the reassuring squeeze he got from the kid.
Bucky nodded, so that's why Tony's mouth tasted more like Strawberries than coconut today. "I'll send him. Thank you for understanding Tony. I luh---." He frowned, shook his head then smiled. "I'll see you after while?"
Steve had changed out of the Captain America uniform and washed his face in the sink but that was about it.
Bucky was left with a hollow and strange feeling in the pit of his stomach. He couldn't make head or tail of his emotions.
"No trying to sneak mimosas at the restaurant. I promised your hot aunt I'd take care of you." He pointed two fingers at his eyes then turned them on Peter. "Watching you."
Tony got a sheepish look, "I uh, Steve already. . . Fed me so. I'll leave you to that. Send Petey down to the lab when he's done though?"
Bucky shook his head, no, he felt something. Uncomfortable, a little violated. "Yeah, like kissing a little kid." He wiped his lips and went back to flipping pancakes.
"Sam said a fuel truck exploded, half a building went down, he can't get eyes on. . . On Bucky." His breath hitched in his throat, it felt like asthma, but Tony's hand on his shoulder brought him back from it. "Go, I'll get in the air. We'll find him"
Steve changed their position grabbing Bucky's hips and raising them. Instead of moving his hips he used his sheer Strength to move
Steve relaxed into it, letting his head fall to Tony's shoulder, be damned if anyone else cared. If they wanted to stare, let them.
Bucky got a bit quiet and seemed to shrink in on himself a little. "Yeah, always fighting one war after another." His smile didn't fit with his furrowed brow but he tried smiling anyway.
He heard the subtle metallic clicking as Bucky disentangled his fingers from one another and the scrape of one of his hands over the glass table top.
He almost looked like the Bucky he'd known before the war. Glowy and exuberant. His last memory of him had been a gaunt ghost of who Bucky had been. The war wasn't kind to Bucky Barnes. He had been a man suited for a nice plush life, suited for leisurely strolls in the park, for petting dogs and befriending alleycats and giving pennies to kids for candy. He was overcast skies, raindrops on windowpanes and long hot baths. He was smooth band music and pomade. Bucky was Ella Fitzgerald's voice when she sang:
"Woah! Hey, are you ok?" Steve exclaimed, steadying Tony with an arm around his waist. "Are you in pain? Do we need to call an ambulance?"
Once again, Sam counted down and soon a small click filled the room, acknowledging that the photo was, indeed, taken.
"What? Aren't you gonna talk? C'mon i know you can do it, i wonder if your first word would be 'mama' like everyone else or if it would be something along the lines of 'pain'?"
"See, that wasnt so bad was it? Now Let Tony kiss you Clint." Natasha said, while preping for another photo.
Steve got off the bike and then held his hand out to help Tony off it as well. Just as they were entering the entrance three other motorcycles parked beside Steve's and the people that Steve had had company with at the club was riding them. The long haired, blonde guy and the class clown with dark hair both rode on their own separate bikes. While the guy with the prosthetic and long, dark hair shared one with the red headed chick.
"No, well it’s  the truth so you're just gonna have to accept it." Clint replied while pulling a grimace into the camera. His eyes swept through the room and slowed down on the far back corner of the cell. Slowly walking over to it and bending over, pulling something up with him when he stood up. He made his way back to Tony (Which only was like 3 steps but whatever) who had noticed Clint had found something.
Now, he was acounted with kidnappings, granted the biggest and most noteable one was Afghanistan, but he still got kidnapped once in a while. With the whole Billonare, genius thing he did have a reputation to either get kidnapped because they needed money, or acually wanted him to build things for them. Once in a while they wanted both, but that was a rare ocurrence. In conclusion he had gotten kidnapped before, and knew way more about what to do an not to do than what he let up.
Clint and Tony just stared out into blank space for a second, before dissolving into laughter that made their eyes water. Sam soon followed and the three were rolling around on the floor laughing. Bruce was, once again, chocking on something. This time though, tea was the liquid thing that he needed to cough back up.
"Why aren't we just doing a trade instead, like Steve has to say he likes fried chicken and Tony and Clint has to do something back?"
And, you see. Tony had given him these new hearing aids that would be able to pick up about 99% as much sound as any normal ear and they were much more comfortable and made with a material that you could bend. So he could have them and the little earpiece for the comms in one ear and actually
"I understand your frustration, I really do. And that is why me, Sam and Thor already have come up with an idea as to how we are going to get these two idiots together. Because god knows Steve isn't any better." She almost sighted out, like it was physically tiring her to say that sentence, which, fair enough Clint guessed.
He came to when someone showed him a little to hard onto a cold, hard concrete floor. He layed completely still for a while, waiting for someone to either close the door and leave or punch him, thankfully it was the first as he soon heard a clicking noise.
They all had been complementing Bruce's chicken-abilitys when Steve had blurted out that he liked all chicken except for fried. And after that it had just been a war zone all around.
"He won’t wake up! How did you even escape?! What are we going to do?" He asked, panic clear in his voice. He was already lifting Tony bridalstyle into his arms as if he was made of paper. Which judging by Tonys calorie intake the last couple weeks, wasn't as far from the truth as he would like it.
"Fuck off, firstly let me tell you my dick is fucking phenomenal ok?" Clint answered, now done with tying the jacket and trying to mop up the blood from his head.
"UUuh, no, no, no I didn't, I mean, I.." Ty stuttered. The adonis punched him square in the jaw and then roughly let him down. Ty seemed to understand he was very much fucked and quickly got up from the ground on shaky legs and then proceeded to run out of there as quick as humanly possible. Hell it was almost as fast as he cummed, although that might be a bit of a stretch.
He thought that Tony would splutter and justify it by saying some thing along the lines of “Oh for fucks sake Barton, it was hearing aids.” But nope.
Her smile faltered for a moment, watching Steve get a odd face and break the syringe. But it came back full force once she realised what was going on.
“You can go first, ill just sit here and smile. Yeah, you have to look happy aswell. No not like you want to murder me, yes! Exactly like that.” Tony said, and then added after seeing Clint facial expression.
"Ew, for fucks sake Barton, please don't ever compare me to someone you once fucked, ever." Tony said with a grimace.
"I dunno, but what i do know is that we should hide it beacuse i hear steps coming down the hall.” Clint answered while moving to bend down and once again hide it in the far back corner. He pushed the last piece back and then sat directly in front of it, resting his back against the wall so the scraps of metal and tools were between his back and the wall. Invicible to the captors unless they moved him.
"Holy fuck are you ok?" Tony said while swiftly moving around the table to take Steves hand in his own and in spectate the wound.
So a free day was not going to be wasted just sitting around moping about in the tower. Plus both Bruce and Steve
"Ok, great, if that's ok with you that is, but I don't think you're capable of being alone now, m'names Steve, what's yours?" Steve, apparently, turned towards Tony to ask.
Clint is tired of seeing Steve and Tony dance around eachother and have decided to do something about it.
Back at the bunker/cave/whatever the hell it was, Clint, Thor and Natasha were done beating the shit out of the big and angry guards and were trying to get to the exit. That proved to be a bit trickier than expected, as every hallway looked the same and the stairs were sort of blocked by a big stone that apparantly had fell. It didn't help either of them that they didn't kown if their friend was alive or not.
"Uhhh, WAIT WHAT is that connected to the arc reactor!?? Imeanyeswhateveryousay." Clint exclaimed, clearly not expecting that level of seriousness.
In Clint and Natashas second part of their amazing plan, truth or dare is played, and somebody (Steve) finally loses their shit. As per usual Bruce will be trying to inhale things in this chapter too.
teammate yanno. But his hand sort of slipped halfway through lifting Tony and slid up a tiny bit. And boom, an assgrab. And it wasn't like he could let go because then Tony would fall, so he just stood there, awkwardly, while Tony got the glasses.
"Yeah isn't it, also, don't worry about my balls, it's not like it's freezing or anything." Clint complained, while he was tying the suitjacket to Tony's leg.
The door swings open with a swoosh and Tony almost falls out the door, quickly taking a left and almost running. He almost thinks he got away, when he sees a brick wall and stops. Fuck.
"Uh, no, of course not, it's just a.. -" Tony came up empty, because he could've said it was a hickey but who had hickeys on the back of their arm? I mean yes, maybe, but don't worry it wasn't as hard as the other ones.. Or wait I didn't mean that! Just- ok, he may be a bit abusive. "
Clint starts out by swaying his hips, slowly at first, to the beat of the song, then fast and faster as he takes himelf less and less seriously. Tony, intent to enjoy this piece of blackmail, spreaded his thighs and started laughing his ass of as Clint made his way onto Tony’s lap.
"Uuurrghh..." Was all that came out of his mouth before he threw up, just managing to not get it on Clint’s shirt.
"Hey Clint, wanna have a team night and force Steve to watch very sexual movies?" She proposed once the arrow-shooting had stopped. He paused abruptly from taking another arrow from his case on his back. And started talking a mile a minute.
"Ok, great, let's go, I have a bike that we can ride.-" He said to Tony then turned towards the rest of the group. Telling them that he'll see them back at the dorm before practically dragging Tony out of the alley, and towards a Harley standing against a lamppost.
"Natahsa, this is Bruce, Tony will be okay. I’ve changed his arc-reactor, i don't know about broken bones, but I'm pretty sure he cracked a few ribs, and his foot is definitely broken. He took a mean beating. We are almost back at the tower and there Helen and her team will take over, Steve has asked JARVIS to send a suit to you guys, it shoud arrive in a few minutes. I hope Thor can give one of you a ride while the suit can take the other one, just come right back to the tower."
I present: A angry-as-fuck Steve, self-sacrificing Tony, and a cute, but still slightly weird picture that led to the internet having a field trip. Enjoy!
"Yeah, well whatever, also you screamed like that one chick i had in Belgium." Clint answered, while slowly sitting up and leaning backwards until his back hit the wall.
I know that the first chapter has some misspellings and I'm just not using the correct grammar. But I'm gonna finish the whole book and then edit the chapters to make them better! Also sorry for not posting anything but I've been busy with school after winter break, I'm back tho and I'm gonna update more from now on!
Tony closed his eyes again as Steve rubbed the cloth all over his face, getting rid of all the dirt and blood. Tony was dozing off when he heard the door open and three voices fill the hallway. One was a lot lighter than the other one and Tony guessed that that voice belonged to the red-head. The two other voices were probably the long haired boys.
"That’s exactly why, we don't know if you have a concussion or any broken bones, therefore, the iron man suit." Bruce swiftly replied, while the suit had strode up to Clint and was now expectanly waiting on him to
Well, at least he seemed excited enough, she though as she threw a goodbye and a promise to see him later over her shoulder. He didn't answer, but she guessed he'd already gotten back into his "zone" or whatever it was. Either way she was now going to the common room and threaten the person there until they agreed that a team night was a great idea. And nobody could stop her.
"Hey, it's almost done, if you can get the cutlery and glasses we're good to go." He told them and Tony and Steve did as told and started getting the stuff neccesary. Tony went to get the glasses, but soon realised that
"Well, you see this thing that you and Clint aparantly have going on, is trending right now. So why not just go all the way and "leak" a picture of one of you kissing the other one on the cheek huh?"
But before Tony got down ha decided to add a cheeky comment, just because Tony felt like it would be awkward afterwards if he didn't.
No, he shook his head, no. That bastard abused him and it is not ok or alright to do that to somebody. He repeated this silently in his head while still grinding on somebody, at this point he didn't care what their monthly income was, and he certainly didn't care about gender.
"YES IT FUCKING DOES-" Sam had shouted and Steve had a wounded look on his face after that outburst. "I KNOW THAT I’M YOUR BEST FRIEND AND ALL OF THAT BUT JESUS CHRIST DUDE."
They arrived and went into the first clothing shop they could find, security had closed off parts of the mall. If any of the Avengers were going out in public, there would be a massive crowd, and now that the whole team was in the same public place. Well the city of New York would probably be standing around them if it weren’t for security shutting of a bit of the mall.
Steve did just that with a slight nod to his head, and Bruce went back to quickly cleaning the edges, getting them back to it’s clean, metal state. Once that was over, he took the new reactor, placed it gently into the socket, got it connected to the plate with a slight buzz, and then locked it in place again with the screws.
A big chunk of it is almost burned black with ash and the glass proteting the acual reactor has almost melted completely. Bruce looks for the small screws that he knows is on the side of the arc reactor and grabs his special screwdriver which was one out of three that worked, and needed his, Pepper, Rhodey, Tony himself or Happy’s fingerprint for the little tip of it to come out. After he was done screwing it out he twisted it just a bit and when he heard the click, pulled it out.
Lastly his eyes trailed a bit to the right, and holy macaroni Jesus take the fucking well. The guy seemed to be 6'0, maybe more, pale skin, and blonde hair. Tony couldn't see his eyes but he bet they were a deep, ocean blue.
It was tense a couple of seconds as they waited for an answer, but when Bruce’s answer came through all of them visbly sacked and let out a big breath. The speaker sparked but Bruce’s relif was clear in his voice aswell.
She knew that Clint would totally be on board with the whole team dinner thing. And acually be onboard with it, not just saying he was because she could kill him in 0.4 seconds. After she had kicked him in the balls one time when he didnt agree on pizza for dinner, he usually said yes to whatever she proposed.
"Well shit, now we're really getting into it, you wanna dirty talk while you beat the living shit out of me? Cause i can totally do it." Tony said, now a little bit slured and forced as the blood in his mouth made it difficult to talk.
After Tony, Clint and Sam were sure they wouldn't die from lack of air. And Bruce had gotten thumped on the back by a still very-much grinning Thor, it got quiet.
Apparently, the internet hadn’t forgotten thought. Because when Natasha opened the newspaper the next day. The joke was on the front page, along with the very obnoxious title.
They'd thought that was that. So everyone went back to the tower and got changed. But apparently that wasn’t the case.
"Honestly, you should've told me that earlier, if I knew it was that easy then I wouldn't have had to get all the glasses up to the top shelf." Clint joked back.
Tony made a fast jerk to try and get out, succeeding for a second until Ty's arms once again tightened, and he is now trapped way tighter than before. With Ty being 21, and Tony only being 19. It's pretty easy for him to hold Tony back.
He usually never went to the low-scale bars but it was the one least likely to have one of Tiberius' friends snooping around. So he guessed it was a fair trade, now that he thought about it, it was a pretty nice bar. The darkly lit dance floor was in wood, a couple of armchairs by the walls gave it a bit of a homey feel to it. The warm and cozy lights a big contrast to the strobing flashes of color there were in an expensive club in the middle of New York.
The three thanked the woman from the desk before heading out of the building, going inside Tony’s car. Steve took off his wig and the glasses before facing his husband and giving Tony his
Group two was certainly busy at the moment, finding info about the Parker’s couple in Stark tower. JARVIS helped them as well to make it easier and faster. They were thankful for it.
“We asked around and some of them gave us an interesting story… Well, it was about Richard Parker.” Jane said.
Pepper. I really can’t go tomorrow. Peter needs me. You know it’s been years. We, Steve and I, we had been trying to find our Peter and now that we finally have him back, I can’t….I can’t miss another thing in his life, Pepper. I can’t miss this opportunity to spend time with him even if it means taking him to see his aunt. Please Pepper?” Tony begged, and that was something because a Stark didn’t beg. No matter what.
to which Tony returned it determinedly, meaning he had made up his mind and was ready to tell or show Peter something.
Thought the effect only lasted once a year. Richard had been injecting the serum into Peter’s system each time he aged. Each serum was different; the first serum Richard had injected Peter with was the first serum that he had created.
“Sounded like they were trying to create a super soldiers like Cap here than a simple antidote to cure a disease.” Tony pointed with a hiss. Richard shrugged at that.
“Ah. Fair enough.” Bruce murmured. Soon they made it to the top floor once the elevator door dinged open. Peter looked around his surroundings. He was quite impressed of what Stark’s penthouse looked like from the inside. He had always dream of seeing and getting to meet Mr. Tony Stark. Now he was finally getting to meet the guy and not just that, he was also standing at the very building of Stark Industry.
It was the Avengers’ mission, well, new mission. It was also the reason why they didn’t want the younger members to know about it.
“I mean, no. It’s okay. You were trying to make me felt at home but really. I’m already quiet satisfied with the guest room as my own room. I-If it makes you feel better, we could maybe renovate the guest room into my very own room? I can see this room is very special to you and I can see you really don’t want to give this up to someone like me...so really it’s okay.” Peter answered.
The baby continued to cry and cry and cry, showing no attention to stop but before any of the man could do anything, the child stayed still; the beeping on the monitor went quiet for a moment – sending the scientists into disarray – before it beeped once again. This time calmly.
PS: You guys can go and re-read the new version of chapter eight. Thought she only change a few of it on chapter eight but, I just wanted to let you guys know. :3
“It’s used to endure blister. It also prevents from getting ripped off easily by a knife or any types of sharp object.  The contact lenses are made out of mainframe glass, to help you analyze your surroundings, yada, yada.” Tony explained as he continued to explain the rest.
Tony sighed in frustration at he was being interrupted. “Plan B was supposed to be ‘us trying to or make Spiderman to join our group’ not my idea it was Nick Fury’s idea.” Tony shrugged.
PS: Does the chapter story pages had any limit or no? Since I'm kind of worry about the whole chapter story pages limit like in the ff. ;/
Groups one was trying to find a way to get inside without being caught. Since, after all, Tony Stark was a well-known rival of said Oscorp Company. “Uh… Tony… Don’t you think that it would be better if you disguise yourself into something less noticeable?” Bruce asked.
He took out his resentment in a typical way; apprehending lawbreakers, throwing angry punches at them before hovering off once again. He wasn’t being snarky with his comments tonight. He just tried to calm his mind. He didn’t want to come back to Stark Tower with such a foul mood.
So in the end, Steve and Tony didn’t have any choice but to let Peter join the group, and made sure that he wasn’t alone. Tony was planning to do something about Peter’s Spiderman suit. He had found out when Reed handed him the boy’s suit, it was made of Spandex. Of all the things in the world, Peter was walking in night and day fighting villains in a spandex suit?! Seriously, his son couldn’t be this stupid? Sure, he was proud that his son was a genius, making a web shooter weapon on his own, and had a super healing factor.
Nova looked at him with a blank expression. “Eh? They did? As far as I know they wouldn’t let us, Younger members of the Avengers to get involved in it. Cap said it was an adult stuff or something. But hey look, you are now part of the Avengers. So it doesn’t matter either way.” Nova cheekily smirked.
He cursed, deciding to just head back to the tower or maybe going back to where Frank was to disturb him.
Frank and Matthew allowed the boy to join. It was a better option they had than letting their son go out there and do his superhero alone without anyone to keep an eye on him. Even people like Frank Castle and Matt Murdock were protective of their kid.
The couple was acting a little strange towards him lately, even before the death of aunt May. They acted like they were…related. It couldn’t be right? Did they find out he was their son? Were they only treating him as one because they saw him as a replacement for the child they had lost?
Peter swallowed deeply before saying in a small voice. “Uh…hey?” He said cheekily, dropping in a curl at the glare from his parents.
Everyone was there and Peter had to admit at how surprised he was at the numbers of people who came to pay aunt May her last respect.
(Well… That went well. Now, where do we go from here? What if the kid is not actually our guy?) Steve’s voice frantic but the sound was cut off by his husband,
“Tony, I know that you are worried and fear of finding out the truth if our son is indeed Spiderman. I know how you feel because I feel the same too. But listen okay?” He brought Tony’s face to his line of vision.
They got inside the office as the principal let Natasha sit on one of the chairs. He excused himself to go and get Miss Stacy. Just then there was a knock on his door as he said. “Yes?” He asked once the door slightly ajar. His secretary’s head peaked in, informing “Sir, Mr. Banner’s here to see you.” She said. The principal frowned before saying. “Let’s him in, Tina.” He gestured. Once Bruce stepped inside, Natasha sent a ‘what are you doing here’ glance. Bruce shrugged weakly, sending a calm nod her way.
“Yeah, okay, fine.” Clint moped. “Oh, and by the way, Steve, Peter and I will be leaving tomorrow morning. So I might suggest you guys stay the night. Clint, you need to wear this hat and shade just for safety. I don’t want Peter finding out that you’re among my friends; it would only make him more doubtful of us. And that won’t do.”
"Yeah but i'm pretty sure that my dick has retracted into my body, so excuse me for fucking complaining."
"Very well, then, take him." The small man told the bigger guards, who moved further into the cell to grab Tonys arm.
"OK, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?" Clint exclaimed while looking around trying to find the source of the sound. His eyes landed on Steve who were now holding a small shatter in his hand, water all over his trousers, and blood already dripping off from his hand.
The same thing could not be said about the rest of them. Bruce, who had recovered from the curry-rice-in-his-throat situation, was just taking a sip of water. And promptly began chocking. Again.
"That seems like a fair and rightful trade to me lady Natasha" Thor proclaimed, while scooping up rice on his fork with his right hand and once again thunkng Bruce's back with his left.
"NO, i mean no, I'm okay, really it's fine." Tony answered, but was proven wrong when Steve loosened up the arm and Tony swayed dangerously close to the edge of the stairs. Steve decided enough was enough and that was how Tony found himself getting bridal carried by Steve the rest of the way up.
It was late afternoon, and the Avengers had just smashed a couple of hundred spitting snails that Mr. Doom had been kind enough to send.
"I'll show you funny," Ty says and then punches Tony straight in the stomach so that he collapses on the hard ground. He continues to kick him in the face and stomach for a while until he takes Tony by his collar and yanks him up again.
And to the sound of Steve's deep breathing, the clatter in the kitchen from the other guys, and the silent reminder that everything was going to be ok that was Steve's arm slung around Tony's waist, Tony fell asleep. Tomorrow, he was going to have to face the world, get a lawsuit going on Ty, talk to Pepper and Rhodey and Bruce. Handle all the PR that came with a breakup. But for now, Tony was content right here.
Thank you for reading and hopefully you are excited for the final bit where it is proven that Tony+Clint isn't = love
Suddenly Clints laughing stopped abruptly, and Tony had just started to turn when he felt something hard and cold crash pretty hard on the back of his head, and the lights dimmed and the world swimmed away.
Thor was looking about as happy as a man could possibly be, Natasha had her usual i-am-way-smarter-than-you-idiots look on and Sam also looked happy, well, more relived than anything else.
Now, you see, once again it wasn't Clint's fault. This time it was actually Natasha that could be blamed for all of the chaos that came up once the picture was online.
"I’m guessing you either want money, my genius or just to torture us. I would like to also point out that my company have a strict no-ransom policy, so if you're gonna torture one of us, it’s gotta be me." He went on, Clint sitting in corner, his eyes widening when he understood the meaning behind it and wanted to say something, but decided against it.
Meanwhile back in the helicarrier, Bruce was pacing back and forth waiting on Steve to come barging in with Tony, the helicarrier wasn't that far away from the buliding that Tony and Clint was held in, but it was deep underground and not even the iron man signals could reach that far.
When dinnertime rolls around, Tony is just about as noticing of that as he is off Steve's feelings towards him. Which means he doesn't have a single fucking clue what time it is, never mind that Clint had told him just a few hours before, or maybe it was a day? You know, Tony didn't know. Period.
You see, though they slept together, they never actual slept. Whenever they were done making love, Tony would just… Leave. It hurt. Of course, it hurt but Steve thought he understood. The man was a genius, after all. And he had his own company. And he was a hero. There just weren’t so many hours in the day to do everything he had to do and be with the soldier. So he understood. He did. He just didn’t like it.
He’d still sigh touching the places where only Tony had touched before. His hands kept caressing each new patch of skin revealed as they undressed. Tony guided him to his bed and continued to touch him, running his hands up his abdomen, across his chest, tracing his broad shoulders and trim waist. He just couldn't let go. Steve didn't want him to. It soothed something inside him to have this, so slow and purposeful. It was his first time with anyone and Tony made him feel appreciated, wanted and even... Loved. He stole Steve's breath away with hard kisses and sure touches, pinning him down and riding him so sweet and tight. Their bodies moved like they were made for one another. Touching and kissing. Taking and giving. It felt so right. It was like… It was made to be. They made love many times after that one first glorious time, in so many ways it still got him dizzy just thinking about it and so many places that Steve is quite sure that somewhere in SHIELD there are tapes of them rutting against eachother in almost every office of theirs they have ever been. Tony was just… He was just too good. Too perfect. Steve loved him too much. He never wanted it to end.
Looking at Tony, seeing him smile to the team and make his little jokes, Steve can’t think straight. Maybe. Maybe—It hurt, but maybe that was it, wasn’t it? May he did...  Misunderstand? He really didn’t comprehend this new world all too well. Was this… His fault? Did he read too much into it? It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark, after all.  It was easy like breathing.
He hadn't meant to. Tony sure as hell hadn't known how to respond to his feelings. But he loved Tony Stark and not even heartbreak after heartbreak made that love smaller or weaker.
And in the middle of night, Tony’s fire burned him so intensely that when he left, Steve was only ash. He missed him. In his bed of cinders, he wondered if Tony missed him too.
“Oh shuuu, shuuu... Don't you worry, sweetness, I'm gonna fuck it soon enough. I'm gonna tear you open and reshape you. Nobody else will ever be able to satisfy you again. You're gonna have to make me your exclusive sugar daddy so you can cum.” Tony laughed at Steve's distressed moan. “You wanna cum, sweetheart? You want me to pound your tight, greedy hole till it's wrecked? Hm?” He nipped the back of the Captain's neck and Steve shuddered again. “I'm going to have you begging to come.”
Like clockwork, they came every three months. Sometimes he shared them with Tony. Sometimes he had them alone. They always left him aching. They always left him feeling bad.
It was so much more than he could've hoped or dreamed! He never noticed that there could've been more...
“Please, please, please. Fuck me, Tony. I need it so bad. I need you to ram your dick inside of me. I need-- Oh, Tony, I need--! Please. I want you to fucking use me. I want you to be your whore, your slut. Christ! Please! Fuck me hard and fast or slow and rough but please just... Fuck. Me.”
Steve moaned something that resemble vaguely the other's name and the kiss became even deeper. He heard the ringing of metal in the distance. Cuffs bit into his naked wrists and they came apart.
He missed Tony. He missed his light and his smile and the way those eyes shined when Steve remembered a reference the inventor made. Like a moth to a flame, Steve greedily wanted that fire all to himself. He wanted to burn forever and never feel ice again.
He dreamed of Peggy, in the army. He dreamed in open french fields, of taking her dancing on those stars. He dreamed of her kind smiles. He dreamed of her beautiful body in his arms as they kissed. He dreamed about saying all the things he had left unsaid. He saw a ring on a Cartier shop in Reins. He dreamed about asking her to be his wife.
So, one day, after an intense debate of what the proper toppings a pizza should have and gorging themselves in three different super-sized cheese filled New York giant pizzas, Steve decided to ask.
What he didn't know was that Tony recorded him in his ruts. He didn't know the recordings came with sound too.
Weeks pass and Tony never looks him in the eye again. Sure, he still respects him. Sure they still work together. But Tony isn’t there anymore. He looks his way. He talks at him. Never to him. They are colleagues and nothing more. And… It hurts. It hurts so much. Never to see those eyes or that smile aimed at him again. He misses him so much. But Steve guesses it was his fault. It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark. But he should have known better. Even if just his presence would make any sane person swoon. Tony is stiff near him and Steve feels guilty. They never said I love you. Tony made him no promises. They never even went on a date. This was his fault. It was all his fault. It wasn’t hard to see. What was hard, though, really, really hard, was to know that Tony Stark didn’t love him.
He touches Tony's shoulder once but gets brushed off. He strains to speak but Tony there are no words. Minutes pass in the awkward silence until Tony decided it's time to go. Steve tries to protest, tries to ask him to stay but Tony just repeats: “I gotta go.” Steve tries to follow but Tony turns and leaves. He leaves and he doesn't look back.
"I payed a pretty penny for your services tonight, sweetheart." Tony leered, his hands moving across the expanse of Steve's chest. "I expect to get my money's worth."
The thing was... He had a pack now. Without him noticing it, he had a family now. It wasn't one he would've dreamed up all by himself but, God! It was so good it almost hurt sometimes!
J.A.R.V.I.S had been the one to point it out. Tony kept a monitor on all of his pack. It was a little creepy, he admitted it but the moment one of them was in distress and/or kidnapped, then everyone would thank him. But alas, he had been working away when J pointed out that Steve's endorphin levels had been consistently showing up lower and lower after his ruts.
Even though he was content... that dream still burned incandescent inside him. It tore at his soul as he held Clint and Coulson's daughter in his arms or as he walked both his dogs, Gypsy and Danger, in Central Park, where families picnicked happily.
He got to his knees and looked up, expectantly. "Like this, mr Stark?" He smiled as Tony did, trying to be suave and charming when all he felt was excitment and need. They were on the roof of the building. So awfully exposed yet so comfortingly kept hidden. This was for them and only for them.
The soldier rubbed his sweaty brow against his lover's shoulder, eyes half open as his body refused to obey. Anyone from the event could come by, and see… And yet, he felt no shame. Everything... Every last resistance had been consumed by those flames. Steve’s face flushed as he pants and moans. He couldn't take it anymore. His own flesh is scorching now, infected by the fire that came from Tony. It seemed only to be still glued to his bones by sheer will power.
It took them both quite a long time before to come down from their bliss. Steve is a pile of ash beneath Tony's gentle ministrations and he has little in him to protest when he feels the other pull away from him. He knows he'll be pulled right back into his embrace.
Sometimes, he even preferred to have his ruts alone. He preferred it because then he could uncurl his tongue and let out all of those dreams out into the world with no fear of ruining what they had.
his omega? To actually be able to mark Tony and make him officially his? How could he explain that drive to
And then, when the rut left and Tony came back, he clung to him again and again. He kissed him deeply and thoroughly and Tony seemed so happy that it made the loneliness go away. Tony smiled at him and it made it all ok.
And… You see… Though Steve loved Tony with all his might, they hadn’t actually had any conversations about what they were to one another. They had sex, they talked about the world, about life and their interests. They’d made fun of eachother and make silly jokes. Tony would come to his apartment in the Tower and eat dinner or lunch that Steve was preparing. Tony would present him with the XXI century’s idea of music and they’d watch movies together. But Tony would never stay. They never did say “I love you”. They did not sleep in the same bed. They had no label. And don’t get him wrong! Steve loved what they had. It made him… Alive. Alive in a way that he never thought he could again. But he wanted… More.
“Go—AH!!” His lover's hand grasp his cock and there is a burning white light behind Steve's eyes. He bits his lower lip and wills himself not to end everything now; to wait; to burn for a little while longer.
It didn't make any sense. It would make sense if Steve was single and alone but he was Tony's and the billionaire was more than willing to take care of his super soldier. Was something wrong with Steve? Was he unhappy?
The cold hand of worry and doubt began creeping up his chest as the inventor left the gauntlet he had been working on and asked J.A.R.V.I.S to monitor Steve more closely for the next three months and bring up every surveillance he had on his beloved.
(For the rest of his life, he always thought through the cacophony of his body. His heart was drumming madly in his chest as he had to remind himself to breath normally and focus.)
He wanted Tony to stop making jokes about having sex with their friends. He wanted Tony to stop calling Bruce and Clint “the love of his life”. He wanted to be the only one that he called “beloved”. He wanted to be his one and only.
But Tony loved him. He had said so himself. And they had a family. Even if the Avengers would always be more Tony's family than Steve's, it was his family and that was enough.
When he was a boy, he had dreamed about his father. He dreamed how it would have been if he hadn't died. He dreamed about mom's smile at the end of the day when they both got home and not her exhaustion of her long hours at the hospital. He dreamed about his dad picking him up from school. He dreamed about all of them going to Coney Island together. He dreamed about his dad teaching him how to be a good man just like him.
The worshipers of Baal took on the challenge and made it so. They prayed two days and two nights but Baal did not answer them.
But when he made love to his omega, he dreamed about a heat they would never share. He dreamed about how Tony's sweet scent would be washed away of the bitterness of oil and burns and become ripe and delicious. He dreamed about mounting the hero, about tasting his overflowing juices and opening his quivering pussy with his hungry mouth. He moaned as he could almost feel Tony orgasm over and over as his slick dripped heavily from Steve's chin as his mouth worked ecstasy into him over and over.
“Tony…” He takes a deep breath, gathering up his courage to ask: “We’re dating… Right?” It’s a horrible way to start but Steve doesn’t really know how things are done in the future. He knows that people don’t wear eachother’s high school rings anymore and relationships are different now. But his mother always said it’s always best to be honest so he figures it’s ok, just as long as he’s careful not to be too blunt and willing to apologize for any faux-pas.
He fucked his own hand, locked away in his old room and bit white pillows as if they were Tony's slender, tanned neck. He growled and humped and panted as he said all the nasty, fantasies he had to the walls. His pregnant bitch. His beautiful whore. His Tony. He told the walls how much he loved him freely and with all the sap Tony teased him for. He buried his nose in the omega's clothes he managed to gather and rubbed himself raw thinking about the how that scent would change if Tony were pregnant. And when he did manage to fall asleep, he dreamed about Tony purring by his side, happy and loved and exhausted and sated, whispering again that he loved his alpha, that he couldn't wait to be pregnant.
He had loved Tony Stark, the soldier thought, since the moment their lips met. He would love Tony Stark, the soldier knew it as a fact, until the day he died.
There was a story he read once in Sunday School, about almost eighty years ago. About faith and flames. Steve thought of that story, now, while he knelt on cold concrete floors, half naked, as his hands were bound behind his back and his body glistened, wet and flushed, beneath the hands of his own personal god. Tony was kneeling behind him, his hot fingers pushing in and out of his hole, whispering the most filthy things against his ears as he stretched the soldier out.
Steve did not like to swear. He did swear, he had been in the army after all, but he didn't like to. It always felt... Wrong and rude; like his mother could still hear him somehow and Steve knew it would break her heart. Tony loved to hear him swear, though. He always said he loved it when he got to see the Captain's dark side.
“Yeah...” Is the only thing Steve can say back to that, dread slowly rising through his veins, filling him heart with doubt and ice. “Is… Is that wrong?” He tries, eyes a little wider as Steve attempts to read Tony’s stony face.
His body was so ready to receive, having been teased so long. The girth of Tony's cock was heaven sent and it scorched his skin when it finally fit between his ass. “Tony!” He moaned and those hands slide beneath his hips as the inventor thrust forward, pushing himself fully into Steve in one glorious go.
Steve doesn’t know what he did wrong. It wasn't hard to fall in love with Tony Stark. Tony smiled at the world and the world fell in love with him. It was inevitable.
It had been too much. He had been... too much. He had been too open, too vulnerable, too needy, too mad, too uncontrolled, too sad, too lonely-- too. Much. The climb and the fall had taken too much from him and he couldn't do it again. He didn't want to do it again.
Tony Stark was a flame. His dark eyes had a fire that so little people possessed; a gleam that shone both in madness and allure. His skin was sun kissed, dark in that olive way that made you think of mediterreanian beaches in the summer; of the fullness of life and joy; of libertines and well, on the occasions that there was a lot of skin showing, of sex.
The man was almost biblical in how amazingly attractive he could be. His smile was like the tower of fire that guided Moses beyond Egypt, through the sea and the desert, chasing away the shadows of doubt and loneliness that one could feel in this strange, strange new world. One could pass a lifetime trying to capture that smile and still fail. With his smile… He could make anyone happy. His eyes shined like the light the God Almighty himself, showing his brilliance to the entire world; his mind… What he could create…. It filled every hole that Time left behind with their incandescent glow, chasing away the darkness within. Those eyes, when they gazed at you, they made you feel like you were the only person that mattered in the whole world. Those beautiful brown eyes, flecked with pieces of gold, were one of the most beautiful things Steve had ever seen. It was inspiring, just to see him happy. He was beautiful in the way artists for the Renaissance thought angels would be. It kind of took your breath away. He was proud and fair like Solomon himself. And he knew it. He was funny and he was alive. He was just… He was perfect.
He’d still blush remembering their first kiss. Tony’s fire melting away the ice in his heart. Tony had captured his cheeks, pulling him down on day, out of the blue, making him dip his head and took from the soldier the third kiss of his whole life. Despite being taller and broader, Steve was completely at Stark's mercy. Tony kissed him like he was all he wanted. And Steve returned it, dazed and warm, letting Tony control the pace and depth as his strong arms slid around the billionaire's waist, pulling him closer and cherishing the feel of him. He'd been dreaming about this for quite some time. Their breaths mingled. And Steve was lost forever.
“Look at you...” The billionaire purred against the shell of his ear, the steam of his warm breath sending shivers down Steve's spine. He almost missed the words entirely, his heart was beating too fast for words. “Oh, sweetheart, you are worth every penny, aren't ya?” Steve moaned and then broke into half a sob as he tried to push himself against Tony. “Oh, sweetie... This perfect body of yours was made to be fucked. God, you are gobbling my fingers up. Such a greedy pussy you've got.” The wet squelch of lube completed the obscene symphony Tony was masterfully playing on his body.
. A boyfriend that loved him and fought beside him; that held him close at night and rutted into him on nights of fiery passion with all the passion and need Tony had yearned for in his lone youth. It was more than fine. It was great!
Dimly, he thought he could Tony curse. Or maybe it was Steve himself. He couldn't hear very well since his heart had taken to deafening him.
And Tony accepted him. Against all odds, Tony seemed to want Steve by his side! As a friend, by his side… Fighting the good fight against the evils that Steve thought to have killed over seventy years ago. And… As a lover, sharing his bed whenever Tony could spare a moment.
Tony smiled to a reporter, jumping in front of the Captain to flirt and Steve sighed. No. What was hard, truly, was to know that he never would be.
Tony was half passed out on the Captain’s lap, slipping channels on the television, trying to decide what they should watch as they nursed their food babies (his words, not Steve’s) and Steve was patting untamed hair, trying to get it just right.
As years passed by, there were a couple of things he decided he wouldn't do and were actually fine. He wouldn't take strange things offered to him by people that weren't from his pack, he wouldn't let just anyone in his pack, he wouldn't let being an omega hold him back, he wouldn't be tied down, he wouldn't be his father, he wouldn't have heats and he wouldn't have children. It was his life and those were his personal rules.
It got stronger now. More than ever. As they mended bridges past and rekindled their relationship. He wanted it in every story he heard about the subject. He needed it with every chance encounter on the street.
He took rut suppressants in mission but nothing more. The serum that made him Captain America made him a perfect alpha. It also made immune to alcohol, aging and long working suppressants.
He was so happy to be able to love and to be loved by Tony. It was a dream. He was so very happy with their found family of friends. It was like home.
“Tony…” He calls, capturing his attention by stroking the side of his face, making him look up. He’s so handsome! Steve just wants to kiss him again and again until they are both breathless.
"That wasn't in the deal, mr Stark." A token effort. They both knew Steve could break them with a simple pull.
had sex? Or the clench in his heart as he saw beautiful families on the street, so happy and at peace?
Steve moaned as he was kissed again. Tony's hands ran over his nipples and he was set ablaze. "I'm charging ah! Extra, then" he said into the kiss.
And then Steve came in like a sledgehammer. And then-- it was gone. Tony was a goner. Everything he thought he could never have because of his rules was right there. He had a pack; a real family he could love, and provide and protect. He had a
Tony kisses him sweetly and combs his hair. “Still with me, darling?” He asked, so tender and worried that it warms Steve from head to toe.
It was a game they liked to play. Every once in a while, in a very dull and repetitive gala or similar social event that required them to ditch their battle armor and don suits, they'd... Play.
Steve waited until he was asleep before he clung to the omega and take long, ragged breaths of his scent to know that his omega was still his.
It would he lazy to say it was because Steve was an alpha... but he wanted it so much, it had to do at least a little bit with instinct.
And all the dreams he had since had dwindled down to one. A very important one. It was just within his reach, just like the pack; just like the mate; just like the happiness...
It is only when he feels his orgasm tearing through him, as he moans Tony's name, low and long, that he notices he has been doing so as if it were a prayer. He comes all over the concrete floor and the billionaire's blazing hand.  Tony finishes shortly after him and hits Steve's insides with warm tongues of fire.
He dreamed his mother never died. He dreamed that she was still with him. That in the morning, she would be up and singing in gaelic as she made coffee. He dreamed she was there at night, holding his hand.
Steve moaned loudly as he felt the pads of those fingers caress and prod his sweet spot, his spine curving beautifully as he shuddered and panted against the solid heat that was Tony Stark's body. There bodies slided together in the most sinful way, like two flames becoming one, and Steve just wants more. Just... More. His blue eyes seemed sown shut as he tried to keep some semblance of the part he was playing but he couldn't find the strength anymore.
He dreamed of mounting the presenting omega. He dreamed about Tony's broken voice begging. Begging for his cock, for his seed... for his children. And Steve would pound into him, his cock finally breaching in that sacred womb and flooding it with his semen, planting the beginning of life inside that fertile soil.
When he was a teen, he dreamed of love. He dreamed that one of the nights Bucky dragged him to dances, there would be his love, waiting for him. He dreamed that, on his way to work, he would bump into them on the trolley. He dreamed that in school, they'd sit together and smile at each other. He lay his head on his mother's lap as she talked about her time with dad and dreamed that one day, he would tell such a happy tale to his own children.
Their moans filled the night sky, some times high, others low, broken and shameless. There was nothing else in the world except each other and the darkness. The rich, heavy scent of sex, hot and musky. The tight heat of their bodies meeting and mingling. The loud slick sounds of their thrusts and the moans and groans between them.
Tony’s reaction, however, is not at all what he expected.  "No one dates in the XXI century, Cap" Tony laughs slightly, leaning against Steve's lap.
How did it go again? Once upon a time, a messenger of God confronted the worshipers of Baal who were leading Israel astray. He challenged them in the name of God, saying that Elohim was so powerful he could send fire from the sky and set ablaze the wettest wood.
Stick around for the next chapters of our saga of tease and here's a small spoiler: Porn is coming. Yay!
"What?" Steve blinks, confused. No. No that doesn't seem right. He's seen people dating.  Feeling a hand clenching his chest, Steve clears his throat and hopes that Tony is just joking. "But I thought-- I thought we... Were..."
He dreamed of Tony round and pregnant. About his changing, growing body. He dreamed about taking care of his omega like he had done after Iron Man's rehab. He dreamed of walking hand in hand with him in department stores and having witty discussions about baby names and clothes. He dreamed about growing pains and long massages. He dreamed about breast milk and drinking it from Tony's growing tits as they made love.
“You can do better than that, sweetheart...” Tony taunts and his hand continues southward. Steve wonders to himself what would be more humiliating: coming with just Tony's hand or coming just by the sound of his fervent voice.
And it hurt the soldier more than he could possibly say. In the aftermath of a joined rut of theirs, Steve would fall into what he liked to call a seasonal depression. He would look at Tony's unmarked neck and pain, white and hot, would fill his heart. Omegas tended to cling to their alphas after a heat, for love and protection. But not Tony. Tony was independent and free and lovely.
Maybe he burned too quick. He wasn’t as interesting to Tony as Tony was to him. He was just Captain America, collector’s item number one. An interesting bed fellow to talk about in the future. Or maybe… Maybe it never was meant to be? He had read in past of such loves. Passing things that change you and leave. Maybe that’s what he was. Maybe he was like a shooting star in Tony’s sky, bright and quickly forgotten. The thought hurt, though. He didn’t want that. He just—Well… Whatever it was, he’s been burned too deep. The mark of Stark is now forever engrained in his heart. It stings everytime he sees Tony with some new girl or boy, smiling that bright charming smile of his and looking at them like they were his number one gal. Ash bleeds out of his heart every night, alone in cold (so cold) sheets.
Peter watched the door to the bathroom. “Might as well take a long bath.” Peter grinned. That night, he had a bubble bath.
“Really? So what do you mostly eat when your aunt’s not around?” Steve asked. Peter blushed in embarrassment before saying. “Uh… Takeout? Burgers? Pizzas? ” Peter shrugged and looked up at Steve who wore a horrified look.
“You take your time to recruit Spiderman. It’s been five months already and you people still haven’t gone anywhere with him. So I decided to handle it myself with the help of the rest of the SHIELD agents. Coulson also took his time into helping me to solve the problem into baiting Spiderman out. It wasn’t that easy, I know that. But we tried and look how it turned out. We found him skyscraping one night and surrounded him.”  Nick said.
On the bright side, Peter was starting to like living with the Rogers-Stark couple. The couple was very loving and supportive of him. Steve sometime even took him for a ride with his bike while Tony spoiled him too darn much.
He and Gwen weren’t together anymore as a couple, they had broken off their relationship a few months ago. It was hard but they were still best friends. Peter was single again, while Gwen was dating one of Flash’s football friends. Harry and MJ were together now, after everything that was going on lately. Harry’s dad still hadn’t accepted him dating MJ.
. Peter? Your lost son, huh? Does he know that you’re his father--?” Pepper asked. “No, he doesn’t know anything…” Tony said. “He has the right to know who you and Steve are. His real fathers and not just some guy-…you’re his father Tony, his real father, he has the right to know. Peter is yours. You can always have him back. He is your only heir, after all.” Pepper softly murmured. “I know. Steve and I are planning to let Peter know everything when the time comes…but for now? It’s better to keep it from him.”
Steve snapped out of his stupor and glanced up at Bruce before giving him a wide, happy grin and replied. “Never been better, Bruce. I feel just fine. Now let’s get inside the building and get the information for our dear Tony, guys.” Steve said as he walked ahead of them. Both Richard and Bruce glanced at each other, having a confused, wary look before following Steve close.
“You know you can call us, me and Tony, dad or pops or whatever you prefer to call us. We won’t mind. In fact we’ll be happy about it.” Steve said as he added. “I know that all of this is just too rushed to you and I know that you’re still trying to get used of us being your new parents. But really Peter, Tony and I will be more happy, proud and glad if you call us like that.”
“Go on buddy, go with Steve to the kitchen while I go and make some call, and inform my secretary that I won’t be able to attend the meeting tomorrow and my friends who are downstairs doing our….project. Well it’s a work related project, and no you are not allowed to go in there, mister. Got it? After you done eating your dinner I want you to go take a quick shower and head to bed okay? Steve will take you to one of our guest rooms here.” Tony said.
“Well, I’m just assuming that he might be.” Bruce said. “The only one way to find out if our guy is nothing but a kid...” Natasha said. “Wait! You think what I’m thinking?” Tony asked as Natasha nodded her head. “It looks like we don’t have a choice but to investigate here tomorrow and see if some of the students look like our target?” She said. “Oh… You guys don’t have to worry about looking for our guy… I know what his bag looks like.” Clint said. Everyone turned to stare at him. “Are you sure?” Steve asked. “Yeah. I remember the color of his bag despite quick and short dispute.” He said.
“You’re right. We won’t mind Peter, but sooner or later they are going to need to know the truth but if only you are really ready for the world to know that you are the son of one Mr. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.” Steve said which made Peter sigh in relief. “Thanks pop.” He said as he added. “Can I still continue to go and school at the midtown science high school?” He asked.
Peter nodded his head and said. “I-If I was that kid, I-I’m sure I’d be glad to hear my parents were still looking for me. At least they did their best. I would be glad my parents still want me. B-But w-why would you want to show me this?” He asked.
“So does that mean you won’t disown me?” Peter blinked. Tony and Steve gaped as they looked at Peter with a horrified expression at the statement before the boy was hugged
Clint didn’t even look apologetic. Tony turned to stare at his husband with taut shoulders, his voice empty and reverent at the same time. “Clint’s right, Steve. It means Peter will return to where he truly belongs. With
He was running out of time to find the cure and instead had instructed his two greatest scientists to create it by using any means necessary. This was why the Parkers were trying to find a way for it. They had tried animal test subjects and it worked marvelously and by the time they wanted to do a human test subject, they couldn’t find a suitable volunteer.
“W-What makes you so sure that you think I-I’m Peter Parker? I hate to say this but I think you might have mistaken me for someone else—” Peter stuttered.
“Good Captain and Iron Steel were making the fuck out like hormonal teenagers.” He settled deeper into his seat. Johnny gaped at the statement. The other gave the man a dirty grin. Well, screw them. What did they know? His soul was officially scarred now.
“But pops! No one’s going to see me when you’re up in a hundred floors building!” Peter said with a whine.
“Wow. Okay, so what will happen now?” Peter asked, looking at his fathers. Tony raised a brow, shaking his head. “For now we are going home and figure out a plan to deal with this- and no, young man. You’re staying in bed for days. Weeks or months or years, for all I care. It’s Reed’s order that you take a few days off duty as Spiderman and takes a rest. In the meantime, I’m going to fix your suit.” Tony said.
It took everyone four hours to stop Tony from rampaging everything and everyone. He finally calmed down and was now in their bedroom, sitting down on the bed while watching a recorded video of Peter doing his stuff in Tony’s lab alone with him. The boy looked somewhat happy, enjoying some time with the legendary Tony Stark. Everyone drifted out from the tower once Tony had finally eased down from his prominent temper and asked Steve if they were still going to continue the meeting tomorrow. Steve looked at him for seconds before he stated that they would, after Tony finally regained his composure back.
Clint pointed his thumb to said Captain America, who was nesting himself beside his husband on Tony’s special heart loveseat (Special made just for them both), looking all innocent with his wide blue eyes. Pssh, a mere façade. Clint knew Captain America could kick ass. Steve raised his chin, “What? I mean the kid doesn’t even look like it. He…to me he looks all innocent to pass up as the Spiderman we know.”
“It seems that the people live there had caught the couple one time in a rainy day, looking panic, leaving their son with his aunt and uncle before they took off. The next day they found the couple died in a plane crash from the morning news report.” Jenifer explained
Peter blinked his eyes, making up his mind. The boy jumped out from the bed, exploring the place since he hadn’t finished sightseeing yet. He opened the exit door and sneaked quietly as softly as he could, trying not to make a noise. He knew both Steve and Tony along with the guests were already asleep and he didn’t want to alert them.
“I don’t know Steve. I doubt Peter’s parents were around when he needed them. Didn’t Richard say that his parents were both professional genetic scientists? I don’t doubt that they somehow used our son as their sick experiment when they had him. And it’s sounded suspicious when his parents died in a plane crash!” Tony said.
The scene changed into Peter; taking a rest, resting on a couch while listening to whatever it was playing on his music player. Headset on his ears as he tapped his fingers on his knees and- yeah. They could see Tony in the boy. Not just interior but exterior too. Logan grunted, babbling archer was right. The boy really was a mini version of Stark. Gods help them; one Stark was already a pain in the butt.
The Starks stayed in Peter’s infirmary room, talking among themselves. Peter had told his dad where he left his bag and Tony called Agent Phil to inform him about Peter’s bag. Reed visited the room and Peter used the opportunity to thank him.
He also had found out one time during one of the Avengers’ meetings that Iron Man and Captain America were his parents. The leaders had taken off their mask one time when they had an argument during the meeting. Though, he was proud to know his parents were heroes themselves. Worried and proud.
“Come here Peter, I want to show you something.” Tony said, grabbing Peter from the kitchen and away from Steve as they went upstairs.
“Yeah. You too. Well then…I think I should go now. Farewell. Oh, and bye, Mr. Stark! See you on Monday night sir, and sorry about ruining your reunion.” Peter apologized before running back to the elevator, got inside and pressed the close button.
Peter remembered he was going to need a pyjama, fresh clothes for tomorrow and a toothbrush. “W-Wait! I…I need to go back home to get some things.” Peter quickly added.
Tony and Steve didn’t like the thought of Peter Parker not knowing the truth. They knew how it felt to be kept in the dark. Not knowing about anything and always wondering about what ifs. It was something they didn’t want their most treasured person, Peter, to feel.
The doctor looked at Peter, who was frowning at Tony. “I…very well, Mr. Stark.” The doctor gave in. Peter wasn’t surprised the doctor knew Tony. Who wouldn’t? Tony Stark was a well-known CEO, and not to mention he was the one who called the hospital May was in and arranged everything. The doctor, Tony, Steve and Clint scurried out of the room, while Peter was left behind to keep his aunt company. They entered the doctor’s private office.
On screen was a recorded footage of their experiment; a mere baby inside his incubator, crying while some of the scientists were busy doing their stuff.  Syringes and test tubes were lined around the incubator.
“I…need your help…I…I got a call from a place where Aunty May went to for her flower trip. She was involved in an incident. I didn’t know what to do or who to call for help. S-So I went here, h-hoping that you could help me out?” Peter said, lips trembling and was about to cry.
“Now for our new mission is to investigate all about Mr. and Mrs. Parker, no hard feelings again Reed, but this couple has been bugging me since yesterday the moment you mentioned about them unable to conceive children. I might have a hunch that they might be the people who stole our little Peter.” Tony said but stopped short, looking up to study everyone’s reaction. He could only find calmness and quirk of brows.
Clint looked all smug. “It’s the other way around. I’m comparing this child to you since you’re the child of Avengers yourself.”
“W-Wait! Stop right there! See there! What’s that?” James asked Johnny before calling Tony. The billionaire obeyed and strutted with narrowed brows.

Peter’s friends, Gwen, MJ and Harry had called him, asking about his conditions and it pained Peter that he had to lie to them. At least he was honest to them when he said he was adopted by rich parents after his aunt had passed away. Maybe one day, he’d tell them everything. Maybe. He didn’t know. Right now, Peter was bored but on the bright side? He was finally okay and healed. His body was in a good condition again thanks to his healing factor, and the wound on his hip was slowly fading.
“Well, the serum gives the injected subject a tremendous healing ability, perhaps to an extreme level where it only takes hours to heal for wounds or diseases that almost take months to heal, if not more. Judging from what I’ve gathered in this serum we’ve found at the Parker’s couple lab, it possibly can heal anything range from cancer, HIV and perhaps to an exceedingly deformed external. It may have the aptitude to replace dead tissues and fractured bones.” Richard explained.
Tony knew that he and Steve might not be good or better fathers to their child but they were willing to try to be the best parents to their own child. They had loved the little one that was growing inside Tony those years before, and was eager to try their best for the child, was keen enough to do anything just for their child, even if it meant giving up the Avengers duty.
“It’s Natasha. I prefer to keep my head where it is right now. Oh and by the way, Clint, please pretend that you’re mute. We don’t want to take the chances of Peter recognizing your voice.” Clint gaped.
I would like to say thank you to WookieCookie for being my Beta or editor and that I'm grateful and thankful for your kind offer to help me out with this story. :)
“What now? How can we tell if this is our guy or not?” Natasha asked. “Don’t cha worry ‘bout that. Bruce already took care of it.” Clint said with a grin that screamed victory. “Care to dig me in?” The men did just that, with a Cheshire grin plastered on their faces. Except for Steve of course, he looked rather regretful. Like a beaten kitten.
, and a fresh towel as well. No need to worry about that. Now go have dinner and I’ll see you within an hour, okay?” Tony implored. Peter couldn’t go against that wish.
Nick Fury eyed Tony before continuing. “As you can see here, gentlemen… Spiderman has been getting on my nerves...” He accused. Before he could continue on, Tony butted in. “So let me get this straight. You want us to check out on Spiderman if he’s on our side or if he’s a threat?” he asked. Nick’s eyebrow twitched as he gave Tony the look before he nodded and went on with the speech. “Yes… Coulson already has the information on where you can find or see Spiderman’s whereabouts. He’s mostly out during the nightfall.” He said.
They slowly explained everything to the boy: discovering Peter Parker was their biological son. They also explained to Peter about their investigation at the Parkers’ old house and found evidences about their experiment on him.
Instead, he settled with calming the boy down. His arms twitched to take the boy into his arms and shield him from the world. . “Shh…it’s okay Peter. Tell you what? Why don’t you stay the night here? And tomorrow we’ll take you there, to your aunt May with my private jet. And, I will also tell Steve to inform your principal of your future absence for a few days due to an emergency. Okay, sounds good to you?” Tony fussed.
The surprise look on everyone’s faces still didn’t deter. Except for Logan of course. He looked blank from the moment Peter came in and left . “That was stupidly something.” He harrumphed. “T-Tony… Is this the reason why you won’t tell us this kid’s name? Was it because he shared the same—” Henry couldn’t continue when Tony interjected.
“No.” Tony said sternly, face serious. “Just having an epic tea party with my epic friends because we’re epic awesome like that.” Everyone threw him a look. Under the table, Clint hissed when his head knocked against the table. Bruce, darn Bruce, had the tendency to kick him in the shin. The beast! If he was a puppy, Clint would have bitten his leg and then Bruce would turn into a Hulk and then they would have Hulk versus puppy!Clint fight. Clint huffed.
When students rushed out from the entrance, Natasha’s sharp eyes went through every face and stance before it landed on Peter’s smaller but lean form. Natasha walked towards him with a sleek grace.
