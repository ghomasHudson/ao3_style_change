“Not unfairly,” Sherlock allowed. “John. Look. I only want the best for her—and for you, though given the jagged edges of our last few years, I realise that may be difficult to believe.”
The next day was a game day against the New Jersey Demons at home, followed by a flight to play the Vikings in the Brawlers’ last game before their short holiday break of Christmas eve, Christmas day, and Boxing day. Sherlock had not been told whether he would get his tensely-awaited start, but he doubted so, given that LoPresti was on a hot streak and Sherlock was still letting shots go in over his right shoulder in practice sessions. John could not arrange a flight in time to attend the game against the Vikings;  Sherlock would meet him in Hamilton for Christmas eve and the next morning with his sister Kim.
He combed fingertips through the hair of John’s calf; scrubbed a flat palm over the hair of his chest. Licked in anti-clockwise circles, sucked, swallowed, kissed. Teased the crepey skin of his bollocks. Pushed into the weight of John’s hand pressing against the back of his head. Breathed. Held his breath.
It went on for another twenty or so items. John found himself laughing again. He turned the card to the back, and was surprised to find a hand-written note.
“Carolina tomorrow night,” John said between mouthfuls of citrus tart, bright with mandarin and yuzu, prettied up with a dusting of icing sugar and a mountain of ginger-flavoured whipped cream. “What d’you reckon?”
I love to feel you come. Love to make you come. Mm, yes. . .”
“Anyway, it’s late and I’m tired,” John said with finality, ending the discussion of whether he could arrange a hookup to sub in for the absent Sherlock.
“Yeah, fine. Whatever.” He had gathered up the items and moved to put them on the bedside table but seemed to think better of it. “Is that it?” he demanded.
“Been a bit of a rocky start,” John agreed, sounding sympathetic but not patronizing.
A pleasant silence, over a hateful distance.
John favoured him with a kiss on the temple, and they set aside their near-empty glasses, drawing each other low and close, the only sounds the crack and rustle of the fire and insects and frogs singing to let each other know they’d survived the day.
“I can hear you smoking,” John said, more teasing than scolding.
“Another glass of wine?” Sherlock offered then, surprising himself. “There’s another bottle of the same. Or. . .whisky?”
“You wouldn’t want that, Sherlock, don’t be maudlin.”
Sherlock grunted. “Chicken legs. Chapped lips.”
. It was
John pulled a face of exaggerated sympathy and cooed, “Poor you.” He pressed four fingers into the midsole of Sherlock’s right foot, squeezed, and dragged. Sherlock let go a moan; the sensation bordered on erotic.
“I’m sure he’s got endless advice. What I need is to start. All these disruptions in my schedule are wrecking my flow. Put me at the top of the roster, get out of my head, let me play.”
Because Rosie was mewly and pathos-inspiring in her weepy insistence John let her convalesce “at home,” they’d fallen back to the flat in Baker Street, which Sherlock reminded with a shrug was nearer the hospital, if nothing else. Secretly he was some inappropriate blend of relieved and smug as he kissed her still-too-warm forehead and left her room so John could do the final tucking of blankets and reassuring she’d soon be well and that he’d leave her door open a bit in case she needed to call for him.
“Gorgeous,” John growled. “Love making you come. Feeling you come.”
“For sex? How dare you,” Sherlock replied.
“Ah, here he is now,” Sherlock said, as soon as John crossed the threshold. Rising to greet him, Sherlock mouthed,
“Lovely.” John managed a smile though his eyelids stayed weighted in place.
John scooped and served, they carried on gently jesting with each other, and John got down on the floor to rearrange the cats per Rosie’s instructions until Sherlock told her it was time to clean her teeth and put on her pyjamas. With minimal moaning, she complied, leaving the two men to washing-up duty, Sherlock rinsing the spoons and John loading the toys into a basket.
. Ever loved. I can’t lose her, she’s all I have.”
“Know what?” John said, hoping to redirect her. “Talking of Christmas, if we’re going to have a tree, we’re going to have to get some things to tart it up with. What if we get dressed and brush our own hair—as you suggest—and go out to the shops to find some, I don’t know, strings of beads or silver snowflakes or whatever. The whole lot. What do you think?” He boosted and unfolded himself to stand, and arched his back so much he couldn’t help but look at a wavering, beige water stain on the ceiling.
“I don’t know how.” It was hideous how something true could sound like nothing but a lie. “I wanted to speak to you about it first, before anything went down in writing. But—”
Sherlock nodded, and brushed the pile of toys slightly aside with the back of his hand to make room for his plate. Rosie began straightening the figures into rows, a habit of hers that Sherlock appreciated: where there is chaos, establish order—to a degree. It all felt so familiar, but not comfortable. John was still wearing his coat.
And of course, sex. Sex, when they had it—which had also been a decreasing quantity in their last few years together—was like an inoculation against furious silences and sniping at each other and made the wet bath towels on the floor a bad habit rather than a personal slight. Even tired, or angry, or a bit half-arsed about the whole thing, the sex had always been good between them. Whether their growing resentments and communication breakdown had caused the frequency of their sexual encounters to decrease, or the decrease had made them resentful and distant, John wasn’t sure. Anyway, it was all of a piece.
Stick against the posts, a few tosses of his head to make his neck pop, a forward glide and a backward slotting-in. Sherlock looked at the snow built up between his feet, the haze of blue paint beneath, then up.
There was a long pause. Sherlock began to type,
“What?”
“Interested?” John murmured.
Sherlock’s foot was on the edge of the bed to tie his trainer laces, and Steven nudged with his own foot, sending Sherlock scrambling to balance.
“Dadda, you’re too far,” Rosie murmured, sounding plaintive.
“Course you could.”
like it.”
“I’m your assist-it. You need one.”
“Hey,” came his sleep-thick voice. “Morning. All right?”
“I’ve got matches,” he offered.
“Made up the sofa.” John tilted his head and Sherlock looked. So he had. “Didn’t know whether to wake you but thought, your back.”
“That really is beautiful,” Sherlock said quietly, once the top edge of the sun vanished below the horizon and the sky was painted pink and gold. “Thank you for thinking of this.”
“Flaming ginger!” John exclaimed.
“You’ve work today?”
Letting the hand holding his mobile drift down into his lap, Sherlock fixed his eyes on George despite not having the look returned—George actively avoided eye contact—and said plainly, “They say if you’re wondering whether it’s necessary, it probably is.”
“Mm?” John glanced up, looking concerned. “Oh. Hello.” His smile was beautiful.
John looked knowing, and contradicted with finality, “You will.” Sherlock’s instinct was to lodge a protest, but now they were talking around the edges of it, his brain was running a highlight reel of various oral encounters, and Sherlock’s mouth had become wet. He swallowed. John winked at him as his mother returned, killing his libido in order to bore and embarrass him with illustrated tales of all his most awkward years.
“So tight,” John marveled, and went on working Sherlock’s hole, leaned in to spit and lick around his knuckles. It didn’t help. Sherlock didn’t care. “Fuck, I want you dripping with slick,” John muttered, a rush of hot breath across Sherlock’s buttock that cooled his evaporating saliva in the crease. “Fuck these thighs,” he suggested, sounding pleased and decisive. He dragged fingertips down Sherlock’s quivering outer thigh, then up the inside, which made Sherlock shiver away. John withdrew his fingers and quickly stood to press himself against Sherlock’s back, kissing and biting at his shoulder and the back of his neck. Sherlock groaned pleasure as he unbent his knee to set his foot on the floor.
“Keep it to yourself,” Sherlock repeated.
The lady of the house had become preoccupied with the fact one of the hedges encircling her rose garden had died, a five-yard run of orange-brown interrupting the otherwise perfect evergreen circle. Though John had humbly suggested it should wait until the spring thaw, so that the old bushes could be removed and their replacements be planted immediately, she insisted she could not bear the sight of dead plants and would even prefer a bare patch to the burnt-looking shrubbery. Hence, John had spent a long morning lopping branches with pruning snips and a hand saw, then hacking stumps with an axe. Three wagon loads of discarded brush later–after lunch in the kitchen not long enough to unfreeze his toes in his wet, muddy boots–he went after the stumps, digging with spade and pick into the frozen ground to free them.
The truth of the thing was that he wouldn’t know until he got back his start, and faced down the long length of the rink, five invading men blazing toward him at speed, firing bullets, bombs, the occasional slow-arcing mortar. Thurston didn’t pull his shots, and Sherlock got in his usual practice time with the whole team, but none of it was real. He woke up from nightmares of ill-preparedness, in his goal without his pads, without his stick, even without his team. Though he tried to put it away and be present, during time spent with John—now somewhat rare and that much more precious—he was always thinking about what he could have done better, how many games, days, hours until his promised start in Seattle, his re-entry to the atmosphere, a return to his planet.
, John texted. There was the sound of the school bell and an immediate outward explosion of children from every door.
“Enjoy the weekend.”
“We should do some warm-ups, then, if there’s about to be a forest orgy.” John accepted a proffered glass of vinho verde—Portuguese, not local, of course—and found a comfortable place for himself amid the mounds of cushions, contrary to his own suggestion. “C’mere, then, and let me get an arm around the most handsome man in the Northeast Kingdom.” Sherlock accepted the invitation, curling up beside John, their arms in an ‘x’ as each rested a hand on the other’s thigh.
The two danced through the end of one song, and the entire next one, and Sherlock kept his eyes on Jordan’s snaking body, the roll of his hips, the way he tipped his head back and half-rolled it, exposing his throat. They touched each other at shoulder and waist, now and then venturing to drag a hand down the side of the other’s torso, up smoothing up his chest. The beat was relentless and Sherlock felt it in his belly, in his feet where they touched the floor. He licked his lips and drew Jordan closer by a hand on his shoulder, brought parted lips close to Jordan’s face, even brushing his ear, then teasingly near his mouth. Sherlock smirked and backed away; Jordan caught him by a hooked finger in Sherlock’s trousers pocket. They found the tempo, chest to chest, hips swaying and rolling, the perspiration dampening Jordan’s shirt at his low back where Sherlock pressed his palm, keeping his partner close.
“I agree,” Sherlock said. “But I’m waiting for the word, regardless.”
a 221B ficlet
He said none of these things, instead trailed his fingertip down the length of John’s nose. John leaned up and caught it with a brushing kiss, and a smile Sherlock felt more than saw in the blue-velvet dim. Sherlock asked him, “What is your wish, John?”
“Probably.”
“Wine bar,” Sherlock corrected. With restless fingertips, he adjusted the flatware, assuring it was parallel and evenly spaced.
Sherlock touched his throat, left his hand resting against the center of his chest.
“Drinks and h’ors deouvres. Before dinner so people don’t linger all night.”
“Stop
John rubbed his forehead and frowned slightly. “Meetings,” he replied, “Meetings, meetings. If I fall asleep right this second I can get three and a quarter hours.”
“There are other things,” Sherlock replied, a languid flirt in his tone; visits to his family were agonising, but John Watson’s presence made at least a few minutes of each tea-time or workday bearable.
“McDonald’s,” Rosie said with quick finality, before John could change his mind. He smiled and took her school bag off her. “Can I stay and play first?” she asked, her entire small frame practically vibrating in the direction of the climbing structure and swings.
“I know Thurty and Kocur have been working out with you. . .whatever you need, brother.”
“Sorry to wake you.”
John’s eyes stayed shut but he knitted his eyebrows together. “What? Why?”
“It’s all right,” John reassured.
Did you catch the 16 references to previous ficlets?
Year Two Teacher, Room 114
, so John was jarred by it.
Reliably, his mother arrived just as things had the potential to turn interesting, creaking back the wooden door with both hands and leaning only fractionally inside. If Sherlock had dressed to avoid manual labour, his mother’s white cotton blouse and crisp gingham pedal-pusher trousers made clear she intended no participation beyond reading out to-do lists and perhaps later pouring tea. Her cress sandwiches were unfailingly boggy and begged for salt, but she did manage to buy all the best biscuits.
John could hear Sherlock’s deep voice, then. “Oh, dear. What on earth is the matter, Watson? Are you hungry?”
“I do indeed,” Sherlock agreed, and forced a grin. “It’s a fine picture. I’ll tack it up?” Without waiting for a reply, Sherlock crossed to the fire and pinned the drawing up on the wall by the mantel, amidst an array of letters and photos he’d been lately rearranging, for a case that was no more than a three, but which paid a lot. “So, which will it be: zoo or
Once they’d shut themselves inside the flat and hung their coats, they stood at angles, directionless. Sherlock knew he should suppress every thought in his head; they’d been through it all, they were not getting back together. Hard to gather up the fact that only a dozen hours earlier, John had stomped in furious, raged at him, gone and returned and broken down and helped him with a case. Sherlock should be exhausted, but instead was a vibrato jangle, wired to the hilt. John busied his hands with things Sherlock had left on the kitchen table: dry biros, cup and saucer, unused microscope slides that jittered in their case when John flipped it closed.
“I can’t see a reason why not.”
“It’s Christmas!” Mrs Hudson fussed.
As if the few simple sentences might reveal more than he wished them to, Sherlock veered left.
“Too dark?” Sherlock managed. “Can you see?”
“Your sister was quite emotional. At least, that’s how it looked from where I was.”
Another pause, and Sherlock imagined the way John’s face would knit up and then unravel as he decoded it.
“Thank you for this,” Sherlock said, motioning vague indication of the bed, the empty room service trays and wine bottles, his sore quadriceps. “Sorry to rush off.”
Mike: My boyfriend’s taking me home to meet his family. Anyway, if it wasn’t planned for you to come out in a live TV broadcast during Stanley Cup celebrations in the Brawlers’ dressing room—did you have any moment where you regretted it, like, Oh, man, what did I just do?
“Help your father and I’ll go look. Stop in and say hello to Mycroft; he’s in the front room with his tea.”
The emergence of Alex George from his bedroom before ten a.m. startled Sherlock into looking down his front to reassure himself he was clothed.
“With plenty of practice and games to keep you busy, though,” John pointed out. “We meet up in Hamilton; I’ve got us a place booked for those two nights. If you can bear to be away from George for that long.” He smirked.
“I’ve missed this. Miss you. Yes.
Well, wow.
“I’m so lucky to have you,” John carried on, and Sherlock let his mouth fall fully open, let his sharp, quick breaths turn to urgent moaning. “Yeah, that’s it,” John encouraged, and landed a badly-aimed kiss on the side of Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock drew his focus inward, to memories of mostly-clothed, nearly-brutal encounters with a man who didn’t want to look at him while they fucked, and would never deign to kiss him, even if Sherlock would have allowed it. He pinched his own nipple, rolled it rough between thumb and forefinger, and listened to his own low moans vibrating in his throat and chest, loud enough not to hear John’s whispered encouragements, not this time, just this once, imagined the hand pressing his face sliding up into his hair and tangling up and pulling and pushing and his voice was sharp with urgency, cursing as he came, spilling wet warmth onto his belly.
JW: That’s not strictly true. I hated my place, and my lease was up, and Sherlock’s place was more comfortable.
“I love you.”
They’d been waiting with armloads of shopping bags--bedsheets and quilts, all from a display Sherlock gestured at and said, “That one”--at a taxi stand outside the  things-for-the-home shop when Sherlock’s mobile went. After listening, looking grim and humming now and then, for a moment, he’d demanded a police escort back to Baker Street for the parcels, and directed the taxi to a familiar address. John had neither been invited nor disinvited, and so had climbed into the back of the cab beside Sherlock.
as he took himself in hand.
John, with that smile of his, looking elder-hipster-handsome in slim blacker-than-black jeans and a horizontal striped shirt—maroon and beige, he had seven or eight of the same in various colourways—flat basketball trainers with a star on the inside ankle.
John grinned.
“That’s better.” They kissed with smoky-sour mouths; when John’s eyes closed he felt as if the whole room was spinning anti-clockwise. Sherlock reached between their bodies to take John in the curve of his long-fingered hand. “Ah, my own,” John sighed. “Bit soon, I’m afraid,” for they had already once driven each other over the edge of pleasure, not an hour before, “Not to mention the effects of the drink.” Sherlock caught his eye, and looked mischievous in a way that was so unlike him, John could not but be charmed to the point of his heart fluttering a bit.
A near-whisper. “Have you enjoyed it? The holiday? You seem so much more relaxed than you did at your parents’.”
Sherlock gave him a sly smile. “Even after a few drinks?”
“I can’t wait to see you again, Watson.”
“Shuttle-runs tomorrow,” John said threateningly, and Sherlock couldn’t repress a grin at his teasing, though it was immediately followed with a groan as reality set in.
Sherlock have said, since he had said nothing? John looked away from her probing gaze while he lied. “He said,
“Here, lean back here,” Sherlock prompted, wanting to take a selfie of the two of them with nothing but air and treetops in the background. The metal railings were strung with mesh nets, at a slight angle so that the walkways took on a v-shape.
“Yeah,” John agreed, shuffled his feet and crossed his arms with hands tucked against his ribs. He remembered how content he’d been to watch her sitting on a blanket on the floor between their two armchairs, passing a chain of plastic links from hand to hand. He could look at her face forever, and knew he’d never get bored. It really was like a kind of falling in love; the only other person he’d ever been so utterly besotted by was Sherlock. John would know them anywhere, by just their bare toes.
“I can’t wait to see you again, Watson,” he told her, as she trotted up to John and slipped her hand into his. To John, not coming closer, Sherlock said, “You’ll text me to confirm—”
Sherlock lay limp, muscles madly shivering, and he managed a sloppy-soft smile, but his mouth was too dry to speak. John’s rhythm shattered apart, holding himself taut and close to Sherlock’s chest with one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, the other clasping his thigh. Sherlock relished the ragged heat of John’s breath in stuttering gasps across Sherlock’s neck and chest as he came, cursing, sucking air, and Sherlock managed to wind his limp arms around John’s back, then dug in his heel to put a gentle roll in his hips. John let out a deep sigh, and his shoulders shook. Sherlock thought of these little aftershocks as their concerto’s coda.
Sherlock surrendered, asking John, “You’re all right on your own?”
at the top. He’d drawn spider webs stretching down from the upper corners.
Sherlock’s own eye-rolling and sharp-honed tongue had come along when John once and for all gave up any involvement in casework. Certainly he’d stopped running headlong into criminal behaviour as soon as he’d brought Rosie home from the prison hospital where she was born. Later he’d stopped taking time for the sort of paperwork he’d done a few nights earlier on the premature burial case. Then he’d even stopped updating his blog. If the work, and John’s part in it, was Sherlock’s mode of connecting with John. . .
“I owe you an apology.”
“I know that, Sherlock. But in that time when I thought I chose her, when she saved me from the grief of losing you. . . just for that little while she
He’d only barely had enough cash to cover the bill, did mental calculations of his bank balance (as ever) against their overnight excursion. Sherlock had said he didn’t eat much while on cases; John hoped that would translate to not having to offer to buy him breakfast, or tea on the train back to London. He was halfway to Christmas, without a job, unmotivated to find one, living in a room he could manage the rent on for exactly three more weeks. If he didn’t buy Sherlock breakfast and tea. For the first time since the army had forced him home, he could too-easily envision himself with nothing. What he had was meagre. Very soon it could be less, and then nothing.
Sherlock only nodded, and they shook hands.
On their last morning, they indulged in a luxuriant lie-in after first-of-the-morning sex in the big white bed. Eventually, they summoned the apparently unbeddable flirt, Jordan, who brought a carb-heavy breakfast accompanied by an heroic amount of coffee. Happy not to know the time, Sherlock couldn’t help but note by the angle of the sun it was already well past noon by the time they half-dressed and summoned up the effort required to remove themselves from the bed out to the sun deck’s umbrella-shaded dining table. The tide was in, waves breaking against the pebbly shore of their private cove with gentle heaves like sighing breath—p erfect, hypnotic noise-cancellation surrounding their quiet conversation. John’s toes stroked slowly up and down along the length of Sherlock’s own bare foot.
“You do always sleep better after you’ve sucked my cock,” Sherlock replied casually.
The car slowed, then pulled up alongside a curb in front of a glass and steel high-rise, and Sherlock seized the moment to resolve any lingering wistfulness and cue up the return of their deep need to be naked together at the soonest possible moment. “Is this the place? In the nick of time.”
“Don’t worry; you don’t have to be my wake-up call. I’ll always make it.”
There was always porn. He wouldn’t need much time. It would help drain off the last of his adrenaline, and a solo orgasm was better than none. He tapped and swiped, muted the sound, opened his trousers and looked around for anything slippery. He was already stroking his prick with a coating of perfumey body lotion from a tiny plastic bottle—hotels should stock lubricant, he’d often thought, but then, he would—by the time he even looked at the phone’s screen to see what video he’d landed on. A three-way, outdoors, all of them wearing thick cableknit socks and lumberjack boots. Sherlock set aside curiosity about how they got their jeans off without taking off the boots, and kept his attention on setting a pace to bring himself off quickly.
Sherlock felt scorn for the child in the book having such a dull imagination. Likewise the book’s author.
all keyed up!” Rosie defended with fresh indignation against a comment Sherlock had made the previous afternoon.
“It’s a wonder I lived to find you. You see why I think of you as my prize.”
Phew! Glad we got that one out of the way. Upfront answers to your most burning questions, in case you want to check out early and just get back to the silly stuff:
meet someone,” Sherlock carried on. “Tell me; I want to hear.”
to be had.
“It really wouldn’t.”
At last, Sherlock nodded a grin at him. “Not skunked, at any rate,” he allowed.
, and every sweater emblazoned with a white 18.  Sherlock had been denied a request to wear the number, even during the pre-game festivities, and so had used white stick-tape on his chest protector to fashion his own 18, beneath his Brawlers’ jersey; perhaps an even better arrangement, as he could wear John’s number for the whole game.
Urgent and taut, a hand guiding his and his hand guiding with no need for guidance because they know each other to the core, have known each other inside and out and inside-out, for years, and forever. Quick kisses and hectic breath and, “Yes, that’s it. . .oh god yes, I love feeling you. . .
“My apologies,” Sherlock grumbled. “I have somewhere I need to be.” Tugging off the barber’s cape, Sherlock rose to his feet and quickly pressed a fifty into the barber’s hand. “Same time next month.” Before the barber could form words to reply, Sherlock had claimed his coat off a rack by the door and was striding onto the pavement, dropping his phone with its unsent email into his pocket and reaching for his cigarettes. “Taxi!”
And so Sherlock found himself thinking about it. Then thinking about why he hadn’t mentioned it to John, and knowing he wouldn’t be mentioning it to him when next they spoke. Once off the bus at the hotel after the game, he idly flicked a thumbnail against the corner of Steven’s business card in his coat pocket, despite knowing it would make him seem desperate if he stooped to contacting the man for the third time in two days.
“I only hope, Sherlock, you’ll allow yourself the luxury of contentment for a change. You do have a nasty habit of self-sabotage.” Mycroft, whose admonishment sounded genuinely concerned for Sherlock’s emotional state, then added in a different, more skeptical tone, “Fear of success, I’ve often heard it called. Though why anyone should fear it is beyond my ability to understand.”
When they came, it was loud and harsh, nearly simultaneous; they were pent-up and fiery and it was no wonder neither could hold off very long. Sherlock’s hand around the edge of John’s neck probably held too tight; John was careless, wiped Sherlock’s cum off his hand onto the sofa cushion. Sherlock knew John would regret it later when his senses returned, probably try to clean it, leave the housekeeper a ridiculous gratuity when they checked out.
“Not many doctors come out of this post code,” Sherlock commented. “You must have been an exceptional student.”
.” Her head and shoulders nodded in emphasis.
There was little need for them to ever leave their sunny, wide-open pavilion room. The entire point of the trip being to spend time alone together, completely relaxed and removed from reality, they’d made sure everything they could possibly want was included or would be billed later, so whether they went to one of the resort’s restaurants, or the bar, or the clubhouse beside the golf course (“You play?” “I know it’s practically required, but I don’t have the patience for it.” “Agreed; boring as fuck.”), or ordered their meals delivered to the table on the sundeck or even directly to their bed, they had no care at all for any of it. Even the gratuities were paid offstage. By the third day, they’d been in two pools, three times in the ocean (once in full moonlight), drunk local rum and French champagne, and Sherlock had got a little sun on his nose and shoulders. They’d slept whenever and for as long as they wanted, sometimes dozing on lounge chairs or in bed, their eyes growing heavy as they read or gazed out at the endless turquoise sea and the expansive pastel sky.
“One for you, while I’m at it?”
“I hear your Dad’s flat has a little shop underneath, just like we have here.”
It was late, and he was tired, and his ankle throbbed, and his head was muzzy from the wine. He swallowed paracetamol and water, went through the motions, found his way in the dark to the bed, which welcomed him, but not to sleep, which waited on the other side of a shut door. There were shelves of pretty lacquer boxes, and he opened a particular one. Drew from inside it a weighty, high-polished piece of obsidian smooth as a river stone and just a bit too big for him to close his hand around. There was box on the far right, bottom shelf, which he thought of as
“Yes, well, it’s a tradition. Though there are troublingly few ways to say, Happy to have solved your brother’s murder, do keep me in mind for any future major crimes.”
John was certainly not going to type only-one-in-the-world
Standing well ahead of his goal for the anthems, Sherlock played a mental movie of his own highlight reel, reviewed what he knew about the Thrashers offense. Once wide-crouched in front of the cage, he set his jaw and steadied his gaze, thumped the bottom edge of his stick-blade against the roughed-up ice in his crease. He was perfectly at home, hunkered down in those ninety-six cubic feet.
A video was shown, of John’s career highlights—Sherlock was amused and a little heart-melted to see John in his early years, looking very much his young age of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one—and then followed speeches by Hamilton’s general manager and the coach under whom John had served longest, himself retired a few years previous. John stood by on the black carpet, wearing the Thrashers’ blue and white home sweater, and when the scoreboard flashed images of his face, it showed him alternating between a wide smile and blinking away tears he struggled to keep at bay. His sister Kim stood  beside him, also wearing a blue Thrashers jersey bearing number 18, and she frequently reached up to wipe her eyes with a series of crumpled tissues.
“Woke up in a stranger’s bedsit,” he said, his gaze traveling up and over as he recalled. “Robbed him of all available cash. Vomited several times on the walk to the nearest dealer’s flat. Shot up in her attic room. Next thing I remember it was New Year’s Eve.”
Their tube of slick was where they’d left it, beneath a rumpled pillow, and John fished it out, twisted off the cap between his teeth and spit it. A cold spurt against Sherlock’s hip bone, the tapping rattle as the tube hit the floor somewhere off to their left, and then a sweep of John’s palm, and he pumped Sherlock’s prick with slippery fingers. Sherlock arched his back and gasped.
“I like them.”
. Sherlock tapped to answer but before he got a word out, John said, “Let me tell you all about how I’m going to eat your arse out for hours, when I see you.”
High summer, the air too still to allow them much motion, a moon-dark night and a sky riotous with stars. John lay on his back on top of a checkered picnic rug he’d pilfered from the linen press, assuming (probably rightly) that Molly would forgive him adding to the laundry chores once he’d brought her a bouquet and shuffled apologies. Sherlock had started out seated on the wrought iron bench John had installed at the edge of the burial plot, but eventually had been persuaded down onto the blanket, but refused to recline and so sat upright with the bench-edge bisecting his spine. John’s head rested on his thigh, and they spoke in hushed voices. The lantern he’d carried to light their way sat dark and cold beside them.
“I was thinking the same about you,” Sherlock grinned back.
“That should have been a shutout,” John told him. “They got lucky as hell on both those chances.”
“Quick as we can. If we survive, I’ll buy dinner.”
“Of course I wish I hadn’t had that crash. A concussion was my dealbreaker, but I can’t say I don’t wonder if I’d have played one or two more if that hadn’t happened.”
“Pinch his nipples, get my hands on those pecs. I bet he’s smooth all the way down.”
“Yes. Something troubling.”
Sherlock did not protest.
“Of course you don’t. Why would you?”
They identified themselves, Sherlock acknowledged he understood his rights and responsibilities, and John affirmed his consent. Rosie explained that John was her dad that had made her, and Sherlock was her other dad, and for a while they both were too angry to live together but now they were talking to a man who was helping them be more nice to each other. Yes, she liked her teacher and did well at school. Yes, she was glad it was summer holidays and was looking forward to beginning Year Three. Is it time for me to read the card on that present?
Sherlock raked three fingers through the fringe across John’s forehead and hummed.
“Good luck to him,” George shrugged, sounding as if he felt John would need loads of it, if he’d taken up a banner in favour of persuading the league to treat head injuries more seriously.
Mercifully sensitive to John’s sorry state, Sherlock declined a cup of tea after dinner and invited John to join him for port in his room. No sooner was the door latched shut than John was pulling off his boots, even peeling off his socks, and stretching himself as long as he could go, down the length of Sherlock’s bed. He adjusted the pillow beneath his neck and would have closed his eyes except that he liked to watch Sherlock remove his coat and unfasten his cuffs, remove the necktie and collar, until he had softened as if on a long exhale. His own Sherlock Holmes, with his shoulders at ease and his pipe between his teeth as he puff-puffed to get it going.
“You could write your own,” Sherlock said, a bit indignantly. How dare anyone assume his man was not articulate and brainy, just because he’d gone to the NHL instead of university?
“He only did commercial work.” Mycroft’s pinched smile belied the familiar glint in his eyes; Sherlock was missed. “In any case, Mother’s afraid without the compulsion of maintaining the family pile, she’d never see you again.”
They drank, and didn’t talk much, and once they’d drained their glasses, John accepted the proffered light bulb, and his courage failed him--they’d only just met, and they were neighbours, and anyway maybe Sherlock didn’t go that way, though it seemed like he probably did but one must never assume--and he retreated downstairs to the much-inferior armchair and the clamour of the interior of his own head.
“How was the first day of school?” he asked, shedding his jacket and folding it over the back of a kitchen chair.
“I have parents I can put,” Rosie volunteered. She drew a ring around her
Sherlock threw him a wink.
Thanks once more to kind friends and chapter sponsors LonghornLetters and K2DangerGirl, who got to name characters Alex George (Sherlock's new teammate/suitemate) and Iain Westcott (John's writing partner)!
“I know the ones,” he assured her, “but maybe it was Emma’s mum who took you in there once after school?”
“Of course,” Sherlock said. “In that case, Watson, we’ll have time tomorrow to continue catching up with everything we’ve missed, so it’s time to get you off to Bedfordshire.”
“Doing some science?” he asked smirkily.
Still breathing but aware he’d be bruised, Sherlock let himself be held by the throat, pumped desperately into his fist until the momentum of the entire encounter fired him over the edge, and he whimpered as he came, in a way unfamiliar even to him, and which humiliated him into instantaneous regret. Steven punctuated his self-pity with another derisive snort of a laugh through his nose, released him, smacked the side of his arse, rolled off and away onto his back. Sherlock had forgotten Steven was still mostly dressed and when he noticed, he felt his own nakedness in an abashed way that drove him immediately off the bed, in search of his heap of discarded clothes.
“We should get together for a drink sometime,” Iain suggested, once they had dispensed with the dull small talk of where are you headed, I’ve heard mixed things about that film, hate how early it gets dark now.
“I didn’t authorise this,” Sherlock said, cool and even, to balance John’s storming anger.
The psychologist picked up on the thread. “Frightening themselves just a little, and getting through it, is a bit of a test they give themselves and sometimes each other. Surviving and conquering a little fear helps them understand they have internal resources they can draw on to confront larger worries and difficulty.”
. John followed, chasing more kisses as Sherlock backed away toward the bedroom. When he turned, John followed close, so that when Sherlock stopped at the side of the bed, John cozied up against his back, stroked his delicate hands up and down over the surface of Sherlock’s chest, his belly, feeling for his shirt buttons and beginning to work them free of their slots, all the while pressing his lips and the edges of his teeth against the back of Sherlock’s neck, grabbing the collar in a bite and pulling.
“Thanks. No.” John tugged at his nose with thumb and knuckle. “The toddler seemed OK, a little quiet, kept an eye on me, suspicious. The boy was hyper, all over the room, interrupting, touching everything.”
He called out to Bouchard, skating the long way around to take a defensive-end faceoff. Bouchard glided up close and Sherlock quickly told him, “Furney is terrified of you and will jump the gun to get thrown out. When Carroll comes in, he’ll hesitate. Throw back to Hatch and skate like hell.”
“I don’t excel at filling up empty hours, you’ll recall,” Sherlock reminded.
; that John was seeing the things Sherlock missed by virtue of his expertise and the particular way his brain was coded, and that it added up to
Emerging onto the landing, John encountered a low cloud of pale grey smoke. Sherlock stood by his cooktop wearing an oven glove, plastic eye-protecting goggles hanging just below his chin, and yet another dressing gown, this one wine-coloured. He waved a tea towel at the nearest smoke detector.
“We’re not staying,” he asserted, once she had gone. The second book featured pictures of the Holmes boys, the elder two school-aged and Sherlock toddling. Sherlock lingered over one photo of the three of them stood in a stiff row in front of the semi-detached house. “My first and only year at the infants’ school. Enoch and I both wished the dinner lady was our mum.”
“You’re a worker,
Sherlock smiled. “You had that idea right at hand.”
Sherlock paused to sip from his glass. John’s expression remained open, if not completely unguarded.
“I promise I will not smoke cigarettes. Are you a police officer? Putting the petnapper under arrest?”
“Yours is far and away the best project, Watson; what prize have you won?”
a 221B ficlet (my first, in all these years, I think)
“Normally I’d beg off,” Sherlock said. “But is this a teammate invitation, or a boyfriend of your sister invitation?”
“Yes, see? Here’s the bee picture and—I think—yes—there is Mrs Turner walking her Chihuahua around in the alley. It’s nearly half-eight; are you tired?”
,” Sherlock urged, and pulled John by the shoulders, until at last he was flat on his back with his thighs open and John lying heavy between them, rocking his hips in impossible, serpentine motions. Sherlock leaned up to nip at his ear lobe, then requested, “More.”
John had huffed a sigh out his nose. “I’ll make phone calls and do web-searches, come along to crime scenes, and whatever else I can do with corpses or at a distance from criminals. But no more late-night skulking in dark alleys.”
Sherlock tilted his phone’s screen, though no one on the team bus was paying him the least attention. A glance out the window let him know they were already rolling up the hotel drive.
Sherlock persuaded John backward a few steps, pressed his shoulder to seat him on the bed.
“General pain in the arse,” Sherlock summed up.
“All right then. I can’t bring you back anything? For later?”
“It’s fairly revolting and would require three times its price in renovations just to be habitable.”
“You’re not too sore? Too tired?” he called through the half-open door, and the taps ran.
“No, I should get some sleep. Game day.”
“Tell Rosamund I said hello.”
“Don’t you look wonderful!”
“Just an hour,” John soothed. “Talk me through the photo albums, another cup of tea to appease your mum, and we’ll go. Order in dinner, then a movie in bed?”
They lay side by side, breath quieting, with their wrists touching, and Sherlock felt as gratified and satisfied as ever he had with some tall, short, clean-shaven, hairy, dark, pale stranger with a moniker like PapaBear or TwinkyBoy. All that, and kissing, too. Evidence Sherlock was capable of making good choices.
“No, we can say good morning, tomorrow.”
“Ah, so you’re not jealous,” John nodded knowingly. “You’re bored.”
“Too far. Sherlock’s big as the ceiling. Turn out the light, please, Dadda,” she whined, and dissolved into tears again. Both of them went into a frenzy of petting and stroking, trying to comfort her. John cooed and Sherlock kissed her forehead.
Sherlock adjusted his shirt cuffs beneath the edges of his jacket. He gave a skeptical, not-quite-apologetic hum, but what came out of his mouth surprised him.
He still required tea, and food, and those were as good as any excuses to put it off a bit. He looked at the clock near the refrigerator. Had it really been nearly twelve hours since last he’d eaten? No wonder his head ached, tea or no. In the fridge was the jam Rosie liked. He’d bought bread he doubted the healthfulness of, as Rosie refused any with seeds or nuts or bits of dried oat anywhere in evidence. He buttered toast and slathered on jam—sugar was good for headaches, at least in the short term—and then repeated the process twice. Toast in his right hand, phone in his left, he could not stop checking for texts or email which did not arrive.
Mrs Hudson appeared in the kitchen as John finished rinsing his dinner plate.
John scraped this thumbnail over a nick in his phone’s outer shell. Picking at something felt appropriate.
Above the sink in the kitchen John shared with his landlady, there was a small greenhouse window--a glass box jutting out from the wall, with two shelves on which to set houseplants. Mrs Hudson must not have the greenest of fingers, because there was only one lonely pot on the middle shelf: a miniature ivy with a yellow satin ribbon tied in a bow, tucked into the soil on a plastic stake. John imagined it must have been a gift once upon a time. It seemed not to need much tending; it was hardly exuberant but none of its leaves were dry. After the first few trips John had made to the kitchen, he’d stopped really seeing it; it was just part of the run-the-taps scenery, same as the glass surrounding it, same as the chipped brick wall beyond.
“No,” John contradicted, and he couldn’t stop himself grinning.
John had arranged for Sherlock to stay until the last possible minute—one more night and another half day in paradise, then Sherlock would fly to meet the team in North Carolina—but John had to return to Boston.
“If I wanted it, I’d have asked for it. Let’s remember this for the future.” They each walked out carrying their paper cups.
RE: Parent/Teacher Meeting
There was only a takeaway menu, the notice that his army pension had been deposited in his account on the tenth of the month, and something he at first took for one of those come-on’s disguised as something important, as it was stamped Open Immediately On Receipt and Official Document Return If Undeliverable. But just as he was about to tear it in half and bin it, he realised it was from the office of the Crown Prosecution Service. Half afraid of what he might find, John slid the envelope open.
“I’ll probably always love you, Sherlock. For a bit, there, I thought we might, I don’t know, try again. But. We’re never going to find a way past all these same things that wrecked us. It’s just not something we were made for. If we could have, we would have by now. Long ago.” He gestured at the distant past, way out of their reach. “It’s too bad. But what’s to be done?”
“It’s not a threat, John.”
“Step-cousin,” Sherlock offered.
“Let me try,” Sherlock intoned, low and lower in his velvety voice that never failed to bring a tingle to the back of John’s neck. “It’s an order.”
, both pointing at
John was visibly disappointed in what remained of Sherlock’s childhood bedroom: two narrow beds pressed up against perpendicular walls painted beige, linens and curtains navy blue and bland. No cuddly toy propped against a pillow, no trophies, not even a pin-up of a lusted-after pop star or an admired hockey pro. The one shelf hung between the windows held only a dictionary and two volumes of fairy tales Sherlock had never owned in childhood—mostly likely his mother’s spoils from a car-boot sale, with spines that matched the décor.
“That’s true, and not something you often see in life-cycle presentations. Thank you for sharing it.” The mother and grandmother smiled, and Rosie’s chin went a bit higher.
Sherlock set himself on his knees, and rested his hands on John’s thighs, calming him with soft stroking. John touched his jaw, and the edge of his ear, and traced his eyebrow with one fingertip. Gazing up at him, Sherlock reached for his belt and said. “Forever and only yours, John. Never doubt it. Never fear.”
“Well, hello,” John smiled at him, and they embraced, one arm each, more like friends. Sherlock took the handle of his case and stood by while John checked in. “Flight was OK?”
“I don’t usually see a man more than once,” he’d said, even as Steven was already unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, backing him across the open-plan living space toward the back of the flat where the bedroom was stocked with condoms and lubricant and more ink-on-paper pornography than Sherlock thought necessary in the internet age.
John arrived then, followed by three footmen, every one of them carrying flower arrangements to decorate the table and sideboards.
“Make no mistake, I feel the same.” John lifted himself fractionally upward in his seat, shifted, resettled. “But it’s not a foundation for anything. It’s backsliding.” He grumbled a discontented hum. “It’s complicating.”
“Yeah, I know.” John’s shoulders went up, then down, on a hearty, head-clearing sigh.
“I’m right here, darling. You’re not feeling well and it’s giving you a bad dream.”
Sherlock clicked through to his suitor’s profile; a series of photos so compelling Sherlock immediately suspected they were fakes. A towering, thick-chested muscle queen with a voluminous, hipsteresque beard. Sherlock checked the backgrounds of the photos, the different expressions on his face, and decided he just might be real after all.
“I don’t need to.”
Sherlock’s jaw ached, his chin was wet with saliva, and John’s prick in his mouth was a thrilling discomfort. It took effort to school his breathing, nostrils only, but it was easy to open his throat for his man’s heavy cock; Sherlock was grateful for it, so turned on by his own ability to elicit moans and curses, setting the pace and defining the boundaries, even there on his knees. John’s fingernails scratched loudly over the fabric of the chair arms. Sherlock was aware of the time of day, the open doors, his man’s bitten-down noises becoming less well-controlled.
“It’s a terrible idea.”
“Stay down. Your tibia is broken.”
!) But when Sherlock Holmes’s people contact your people (note: “our people” are Mike and me; we are our own, only people), offering an exclusive interview with a pair of hockey hotties who happen to be hot for each other, you don’t say no. (Incoming gif from
Sherlock steered their bodies clockwise. Colin’s hand skimmed down Sherlock’s buttock, gently cupped and pulled, drawing him closer.
John had been running on empty for months. In two hours, he was filled to bursting. Exhausting as it was, even with his noise-induced headache and the discomfort of the costume, he felt luckier than ever he had.
John was writing an Op-Ed for the Boston Globe, with some behind-the-curtain scheme to have it talked about by sports radio, in social media, and elsewhere, all of it designed to surround the night of his number being retired in Hamilton.
Hotel key card; billfold; cellphone in a case with slots for cards on the back, platinum credit card and driver’s license visible. Folded bills—probably not more than thirty dollars—and some loose change. Two bars of Xanax. A squat plastic vial with a disposable rubbery cap, a residue of light-coloured powder left in it. Sherlock stepped back until he hit the opposite counter, less than a full stride, and kept his eyes on the pile of detritus lest it make any sudden moves. He went on staring at it for as long as it took him to finish his drink. Using thumb and forefinger only, he turned George’s phone face up. He found the information he needed—it was 2:43 a.m.—and also caught sight of a notification of a
“That I’d ask you.”
“Where were you last Christmas?” John asked, grateful Sherlock had seemed neither discomfited by the realities of life in wartime, nor morbidly curious about it.
“Thank you, no,” Sherlock told him. “So commences two days of recipe testing,” he said, in a tone that made plain he looked forward to the culinary adventure.
“Privacy is paramount; I’ll destroy the notes once I’ve solved the case and returned the property.” Sherlock rubbed his palms together, glancing over John’s shoulder into the flat. “And given the need for secrecy, I wonder if I could trouble you to host the meeting here? Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee my own flat is free of government surveillance equipment.”
John was so still and silent Sherlock couldn’t locate him, didn’t want to disturb him but still slid a hand along the mattress until his wrist met John’s warm skin. Low back, he was lying on his side, facing away. Sherlock dragged the backs of his fingers upward beside John’s spine for a few inches, then left him to sleep. The brief encounter gave him a map; drapery-covered French doors to his right, bath to his left, suitcases open on the floor in the corner past his foot. Hotel bed so high his feet would not touch the floor if he sat up on its edge, which he was tempted to do—sometimes it was best to surrender the fight and leave the bed, get on with other things. Sleep seemed near enough, though, that it might find him again, and so he stayed, and drew out one leg from beneath the covers, rested it on top of the duvet.
“It’s all right,” Sherlock said dismissively. “I’ve work to do and won’t sleep much. Take the bed. I’m fine here.”
“You’ve done more than enough, John,” Sherlock’s mother said, uncharacteristically sweet. “Visiting, and Sherlock’s put you to work. . .Put that away and let me get you a cup of tea.” She guided him by the shoulder, though he moved to protest, and Sherlock ducked out lest he give in to his urge to take John by the wrist and pull him out of the shed, the suburbs, indeed the country. A private jet to Thessaloniki could be arranged in under two hours.
“Sometimes guys get shaky. You know this. It’s not a crisis.” Lestrade had been scolding him for the better part of an hour, picking apart his performance not just in the previous night’s game but over the course of the season to that point. Sherlock agreed with most of what he said. Sherlock missed easy saves. Sherlock was in his own head. Sherlock was probably having some post-championship letdown. Things all right outside the arena? All good at home, and that?
Sherlock dove into his t-shirt and jumper, began turning the legs of his jeans the right way out. “Stay and talk about what?” He meant it to sound like a challenge but it came out plaintive.
“Christ, Sherlock. That’s Paul McCartney!” he hissed through gritted teeth.
JW: I’m liking the meme thing.
“Thanks, but don’t trouble yourself.”
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock assured. “How good it was to get your big cock in my mouth. I wanted to make you come.” John kissed him, returned the favour of a wandering hand, wrapping his perfect fingers around the rapidly-plumping shaft of Sherlock’s prick.
John had such impeccable timing, even on the other side of the country.
Two short strides and Sherlock was taking a knee, sideways-glancing at his folded profile in the tall mirror hung on a sliding closet door. He drew in his belly with a muscular shift, to make it vanish. There was a bruise on his tricep he hadn’t noticed before, and one inside his opposite forearm. He raised his gaze, lifted both hands and beckoned with two quick come-to-me flicks of his fingers.
A few hours later, they were in a taxi on the way back to Baker Street. Sherlock had spotted his man shortly after they found a vantage point from which to view the techie’s home, texted his police contact, and sent John to spill the contents of his pockets on the pavement in front of him, a distraction just long enough for Sherlock to pick his pocket. A handful of useless computer parts, and a scrap of paper torn only in half, bearing the address from where they’d been pilfered. A pair of women’s red-soled sandals in the gym bag he carried—he hadn’t even gotten far enough away to ditch them—and a shimmer of tears in his eyes as the cops descended. Amateur.
In fact, John had felt a pang of regret upon his refusal to join Sherlock in chasing down a potentially-related but tangential lead on Christmas day. And then something like compassion for Sherlock; his face had gone soft for a half-second before the mask of down-the-nose aloofness was fully assembled. Probably no one but John would have even noticed it. For a moment he’d reconsidered, but then Sherlock changed the subject and opened his laptop, and John took Rosie to “the park at home” for a twenty-minute energy drain before bundling her up to leave, and that was that.
“Sure. Of course.” He smiled, feeling off-balance. He thought, too late, that he should get up and walk Sherlock to the door, but Sherlock was already nearly there. And then he was through it, and out of sight.
even as he protested.
“Oh, John. I hope you helped yourself to some of that cake in the fridge,” she said, and laid her hand maternally upon his shoulder.
“You are.”
John looked skeptical, as if tempted to remind Sherlock he was not a particular fan of meeting people, but followed him, glass in hand.
The man looked deeply considerate of the information.
John fished in his pocket and came up with a handful of folded bills. He shuffled quickly then started to offer her a quarter-folded twenty. Sherlock intervened, liberating a fifty, which he handed over. The clerk tried to refuse but in the end accepted with profuse thanks, though her gaze darted between them, unsure who exactly she should be grateful to.
Once the staff had passed platters and tucked in to the meal of wonderfully warming mutton stew and mounds of roasted potatoes, and were busy with lightweight gossip and the buttering of bread, John leaned his knee against Sherlock’s beneath the table and caught his eye. Sherlock’s expression remained stoic, but he lifted his eyebrows and asked, “Will you join me for a glass of port after supper, Watson?”
Mycroft averted his gaze beneath raised eyebrows, indicating he was backing off the topic.
“Right. What’s the surgeon’s name? I might know of him.”
“I also have a rather pressing need for outside opinions. You’ll do.” The man beckoned near-violently with one hand and John found himself following him up the stairs to 221B--a much larger if not necessarily nicer flat than his own. The man skipped one of the steps near the top of the flight; when John hit it, it gave a deep squealching groan. “Giveaway stair,” the man said, absently.
, he replied—a reminder of danger signs he’d already blown past and which he should direct himself back onto the correct side of—then added
“Kind of you to let them win,” John joked.
Sherlock snatched two non-Hob Nob digestives off the small plate beside Mycroft’s saucer, bit one in half and brushed falling crumbs off his shirtfront onto the carpet.
She offered him ice water in a plastic cup which he gratefully accepted; he was over-warm in the heavy velvet suit and his well-polished army boots, not to mention the blanket of facial hair and the hat with its built-in fringe of white hair around the ears and neck.
“No scold about how I should feel lucky to still have some,” Sherlock commanded, and exhaled a blue-grey cloud that quickly dissipated in the breeze. He ashed out the window and let his eyes close.
Steven had taken off his trousers, lay on the bed in his polo shirt, boxer shorts, and calf-high, brown socks. The condescending smirk returned to his face, accompanying a reprise of the derisive laugh. “Right. You play a game and call it a job. I took three days away from actual work to come here.”
The same group he and John had met previously—minus a few, plus a few others—welcomed him to take a seat at their corner of the bar. He ordered a silly drink, eavesdropped on the half-shouted conversation—some friendly gossip, the usual complaints about jobs—and eventually followed some of his new friends to the dance floor, grateful for the opportunity to move. He dreaded to think what his weigh-in would look like his first day back in the training room after a week of indulgent food and fewer than usual workouts. The two women who joined him on the small but crowded floor were young, probably recent university graduates working one last fun job before entering the real-world workforce—their version of a season in the minors—but the man was an adult, probably near Sherlock’s age, a local with a shaved head and an almost comically stereotypical muscle-queen physique: muscles created in a gym, fed a powdered diet, and built for display rather than practical use. He rested a hand on Sherlock’s hip as they moved in time to a song not quite familiar enough for Sherlock to place.
“A bit, yeah.” John’s shoulders were tense, and his headache showed in the creases around his eyes. He shrugged, not genuinely, but because it was expected. “Well.” He cleared his throat. “Just one of those things.”
Sherlock sent a terse reply to the email, insisting he planned to be mobile after his follow-up on the wrist a few days later. He was reminded of years spent arguing about how much danger was acceptable, and of John’s slow-growing resentment that Sherlock kept going out on cases while John paid the psychological price of a self-imposed sidelining. Sherlock had grown used to John coming across more angry than sympathetic on the few-and-far-between occasions when Sherlock came home with injuries. The disapproving frowns and barely-disguised eyerolls he’d gotten from John in response to his current heavily sprained ankle and lightly fractured wrist had been no surprise. It was the most injured Sherlock had been in ages, and John was furious at him. A faint tickle at the back of his mind told him John’s reactions were unreasonable, but whether or not, it was clear Sherlock was being punished.
“You know, I mentioned something to Rosie about how I used to help with your cases, and I don’t think she believed me.” John offered it as a point of interest. It had nagged at him a bit in the intervening days—that Rosie didn’t know or remember him as Sherlock’s second. Of course, she wouldn’t; he’d stopped doing legwork well before she was aware of the things the adults in her life got up to that didn’t center solely around her. But he’d kept up writing the blog, for a while. She must not remember that either—suggesting his Christmas ornament should be doctorly rather than writerly—and he’d been thinking rather a lot about how she saw him. How everyone did.
Sherlock wasn’t sure.
He was late—unforgivably, sloppily so—and so served his time in the skybox, perspiring beneath his suit, watching the clock more than the game. John texted to ask what had happened, expressed shock when Sherlock told him he was being punished for bad behaviour. He blamed an over-long nap, the car service, a broken GPS unit.
John laughed again. “Thanks, no. I’ll just wait for my cheque,” he joked.
. John had gone on doodling, making crosshatched shadows beneath his cubes.
“You’re amazing,” John said. “You and your perfect words.” He pinched the ring out of Sherlock’s grasp and slipped it on. “Fits,” he smiled, and leaned in, begging a kiss Sherlock happily bestowed. John rubbed his fingertip over the whirled engraving on the ring’s surface. “Is this a fingerprint?”
SH: Not remotely. But the machismo is thick, it’s true. In the end, though, we’re individuals, and we know each other quite well in some ways. The personal relationships, friendships outside of work, and so on, vary like they do in any group of colleagues.  So those who know us well for our personalities and ethics and whatever other qualities are valuable to them, were sort of instantly supportive and then let it go.
John hummed noncommittally and sipped his drink. “What are you working on?” he asked, keeping the conversation going—a reason to stay—but leaving aside anything with much weight—a reason to argue, or to sigh, or ultimately to leave. Sherlock was grateful for the chance to talk over his latest project with John, his friend once more, it seemed. The only man on whom an explanation of his cases and case studies was never wasted.
John.
Mycroft tapped at his mobile’s screen, and before Sherlock had made even a half-step forward, said loudly, “I’ve summoned my best IT specialist to assist you, Father; he’ll arrive in thirty minutes. Why not have a cup of tea while you wait?” Sherlock allowed himself to smile his relief at Mycroft—well connected, when it suited him—and Mycroft added, “I’ve just finished mine so you’ll be on your own, I’m afraid. Sherlock has an appointment.”
“Two and a half.”
Glancing around the kitchen John was willing to believe it was not on fire, and left the extinguisher alone in favour of raising the window sash to let some air move. He couldn’t suppress a grin at evidence that Sherlock had found something at which he did not excel.
, this meeting was torture on multiple levels, and what had Sherlock done to deserve being cast into such a hell? At least some of whatever it was, he’d gladly do again), and went straight from Lestrade’s office in the Garden to the practice arena across the street. Surely there’d be someone there—some of the women players whose home arena it was, even an equipment guy, anyone who could skate and shoot—who could fire a few at him. He had an excess of weird energy to burn.
But the bed was warm and the night was a black icy chill. He drew the quilt up around his shoulder and sought Sherlock’s bare skin beside him. His belly moved against the back of John’s fingers but his breath was silent, all the lengthy rest of him slack and still in his sleep. John longed for the lamp, or a candle, or even a match, just to see him at rest, all his curves and angles, the muss of his hair, his curled-open fingers.
could be saved? Sherlock had trusted John since the day they met, trusted his judgment. And John had judged them a failure. Could he be wrong?
Through misfortune or mercy, at that moment the cab rolled to a stop in front of their door. Sherlock leaned forward to pay the driver, who looked momentarily puzzled by the fact of notes instead of the usual swipe of a card. Inside, all was quiet and dark but for a little decorative lamp on the hall table, just enough to show them the way up the stairs. They took off their shoes and carried them, skipped the giveaway stair, so as not to wake Rosie or Mrs Hudson—who still waited up for Sherlock, or at least tried to.
Sherlock growled frustration and rolled away before they got carried off on that particular tangent.
“Are those birds or bats?” John asked, motioning out to their right, above the trees.
“I’m not gonna scratch you, or put you on leave, nothing drastic,” coach Lestrade assured him as they faced each other down across his desk. “I’m not worried. I know exactly who you are and I know I can depend on you. If things are rough, just get back to basics.”
Sherlock waited.
“You’re right, of course,” Sherlock said blandly.
“Undoubtedly.” Sherlock stole a glance; the agent’s back was to them. “The trousers could be cut a little more carefully across his arse. I imagine he looks better undressed.”
“A lot of players go on wearing their beards for at least part of the summer. I think Sherlock looks quite handsome—like a university professor.”
“That’s not really how you use that phrase.” John wrinkled mouth and nose, shaking his head.
Steven laughed a bit, returned the nod even though he was already looking down at the menu rather than at Sherlock.
John couldn’t help but smile as he wiped his hands on a ktichen towel, then folded it lengthwise and draped it over the handle of the oven.
“Someday Rosie will be old enough to know about this, and I don’t want to have to tell her that, oh, Richard Brook in that story about Sherlock’s two-year disappearance really
John favoured Sherlock with one of those smiles he had that seemed at once grateful and puzzled, the ever-present,
John looked chagrined. “Sorry,” he said, and shook his head at himself. “I swear I don’t mean to.”
“Great.” John started clearing plates and bottles, crumpled paper napkins. “I was thinking maybe a movie?” he asked, mercifully changing the subject, offering Sherlock a few hours to focus his thoughts elsewhere. “There’s that new horror one, with an actual rubber-suit monster instead of just people pulling each other’s thumbnails out with pliers. At the Common; we can even run over and back if you want to get some conditioning in.”
Sherlock gave John a look that scolded him; he knew. They both did.
There were a few more pages, and John scrutinised photo after photo of a much younger Sherlock, smiling mild affection at each image. Sherlock could barely stand to see them. Each picture told its story, background and context clues reminding him this was just after those boys emptied his hockey bag onto the frozen pond and kicked the contents in fifty directions so Sherlock had to scramble, this was the flat with the always-dripping taps that kept him awake nights, that was his dead brother’s jumper that Sherlock wore every day until it unraveled, and even then he couldn’t cry, and it was then he knew it wasn’t just teenage self-absorption that made him think there was something wrong with him. And this was the winter he got hurt, got pills, got hooked. That bruise on the back of his hand was not a hockey injury.
“Unlikely,” Sherlock said. Six months before, it would have been sniping, but it was mild; Sherlock was watching the children, tracking Rosie’s movements with his eagle eyes.
Game day.
“I could get used to something like this,” John agreed.
Sherlock imagined whatever Watson was getting up to in school, it was far less disappointing than her mild refusal to drink her milk. John’s throat-clearing reached a crescendo as the army of women arrayed against the two of them took up their positions on the opposite side of the table. Their smiles seemed suddenly viper-like; Sherlock raised his guard.
“Course I do.” The look of concern flickered once more in John’s bright blue eyes; that revelation had come amidst a larger discussion of how Sherlock’s addictive tendencies, even after several years clean, made everything he did either a badly-needed distraction, or a struggle to ignore his darkest urges, or both.
“Oh.” John frowned sympathy. “Sorry.”
, about a still-loving family that has undergone a divorce.
Sherlock’s shoulders pinched back upward. He’d asked John a similar question when Rosie was still an infant, squalling—an appropriate word; she stormed in short bursts between periods of sunny tranquility—through every night, deepening Sherlock’s forehead creases and putting shadows under John’s already puffy eyes.
John nodded, half-frowning. “That must be difficult.”
“Call me Sherlock.”
It reminded him of someone.
“Watering can—yes. Can I show you it?”
, actually. He’s Irish.”
Sherlock gathered his glove and blocker off the top of his goal and gladly followed his man off the ice and back out into the world.
The first line offense was center Michel Bouchard, with Thurston and Mellon on the wings, always reliable. Their first-of-the-season opponents, the Milwaukee Muskies, had given the Brawlers the business in the post-season, but already were down a second-line forward and a veteran D thanks to pre-season injuries, and had four new offensive players due to trades and two retirements. They had already begun not to look too strong by mid-September. Sherlock predicted he might stop thirty; his team would win the game easily, probably by at least two. He was focused, but also confident, as the puck dropped at center ice.
“You’ll email me a link?” Sherlock asked, rising from the table. “You still have my card.”
Sherlock put in, “Stay thirty minutes and you’ll save an hour off your journey, this time of night.” He straightened a pile of papers—spreadsheets, accounting, another dull case of embezzlement and blackmail Mycroft was using to keep him busy—and slid them into a folder, wound up the string around the tabs to tie it shut.
“Not when I have to say goodbye to you again so soon,” John said. Sherlock and the team would fly back to Boston immediately after that day’s game; John’s flight left later in the day and would get him back on the east coast in the earliest hours of the next morning, and he had a short turnaround before a lunchtime speaking engagement. He picked up his phone and typed a text to Thurston as Sherlock made his way to the bathroom.
Sherlock tilted his head and gave John a penetrating look that lingered. John’s shoulders dropped.
“Sherlock doesn’t want me to think there are family photos anywhere, but I have to see him in his school uniforms,” John said pleasantly, which made Sherlock kick his shin beneath the table. John mused, “Little bare knees and all.”
John looked pleased. He was easy to please. Not due to lack of discernment, nor some failure of imagination that made him think anything out of the ordinary was automatically impressive, but only because he seemed, recently, predisposed toward contentment. Sherlock welcomed this happy-go-lucky attitude but would not go so far as to credit its existence to his own. To their partnership, perhaps. Regardless of the root, the bloom was John’s freely-given, frequent smiles, and Sherlock was glad when the sun turned them his way.
They arranged a meeting; Bam_Bam would come to the team hotel. Sherlock wondered if the aforementioned partying would occur en route, or if his new friend would bring his supplies along so that Sherlock would be made into a spectator. Recognising a miscalculation on his part—saying he didn’t mind one way or the other—Sherlock half-seriously considered sending a message to cancel the whole affair, but just then the bus parked at the hotel entrance and there followed the deliberation-disturbing bustle of thirty men engaging in vaguely noisy leavetaking behaviour. Sherlock slipped his phone into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and took up his coat and bag. Let his “date” get high out of his head; Sherlock only wanted to suck him off and then get some needed sleep. Early flight to Boston next morning.
John went on opening folded sheets of all sizes, no two--of course--exactly alike.
“Watson,” he corrected.
“I’ve something for you, John.”
There was a pause, a shorter one, before Sherlock replied.
“Pity,” Sherlock commiserated; it really was. He had at last fully unwound, but John had never seemed to, sometimes stealing glances at his phone, checking email and texts when he thought Sherlock wasn’t looking. Sherlock offered, “I know you’ve been thinking about work.”
“You were always—” Sherlock started, but cut himself off and started again. “I know you were always bothered that I still took on cases you thought might be dangerous.”
“Absolutely it is,” John answered too quickly, then corrected himself, “Well, I mean to say it’s vital. And there’s much to admire about the organisation, but I’m just a doctor, doing my job.” He was pleased with the recovery.
At last, three consecutive days—two of them a weekend—at home together in their flat, and Sherlock was determined to make the most of it. He met John for dinner at the place where they’d had their first date (though John had not known it was a date until months later) on Friday night, and ordered wines to match all three courses.
“Yeah, I think so, too. I suppose you know by now how to determine if you’re concussed.”
By the time they’d had quick and noisy reunion sex; seared and oven-baked the chops; made a quick mint pesto and a risotto tarted up with spinach, lemon, and feta cheese; stuffed themselves; and fallen into bed with John’s laptop between them to watch a crime documentary about an imposter who was obvious to everyone but the mother and siblings of the long-lost loved one he pretended to be, it was half past midnight and Sherlock was struggling against sleep. For no other reason than that he was back with John, cocooned in their sometimes-smelly, clutter-riddled love nest, and for him to fall asleep meant morning must come. Morning meant reporting to the coach’s office for a dressing down or, worse, a “we’re all here for you; what’s going on?” sympathetic faux-therapy session.
“Maybe another time,” Sherlock said, and gave another off-putting smile. John thought he would rather be shot in the other shoulder than have to go through this humiliation again; he would not be asking Sherlock Holmes to a movie, a concert, or a walk in the park, ever again.
JW: True enough. Fire away.
“You’ll have to answer the door; I can’t move.”
Sherlock looked up; the men were suddenly on the move, nearly out the door. He got smoothly to his feet, wrapped his coat around himself and started out after them. Once out the door, he watched as they split up and moved toward three cars, nodding and muttering goodnights at each other. Sherlock stood beside the pub’s front door and drew out a cigarette and matches, a bit of stage business to make him a less obvious observer. In his pocket, his phone went several more times.
“Has she been vomiting? Came on suddenly?”
Rosie was pale-lipped, pink-cheeked, perspiring and limp-limbed, looking terribly tiny on the padded and paper-upholstered gurney. Upon seeing them—or, more specifically, John—her face fell and she collapsed into tears. He embraced her so completely she nearly vanished, just her sparkling trainers and a bit of her jeans showing. Sherlock scanned the space and quickly located the tablet computer tucked into a metal pocket on the wall, left open by the receiving nurse so he didn’t even need to guess at a password. He reported Rosie’s vital signs, and read out the notes.
“More practice time. Maybe get Bouchard or Mellon to meet me off-hours.”
Sherlock and John had taken Rosie north one weekend the previous summer to visit a kiddies’ theme park, and told her the manor house B & B where they stayed had had all its pillows stolen the previous week and Sherlock left clues all around the place for her to discover. On their way back to London, they’d had Sunday lunch with Clara and Archie, the former gentle and welcoming, the latter an overgrown pup on the verge of leaving school.
“No--thank you--I wouldn’t ask.” Sherlock’s posture was languid, his mouth turned up softly at the corners. “However, I’m glad you’re still here.” He went into a kitchen cupboard and brought out a bottle. “I’d like to drink to another successful Christmas drinks party, and to do so alone would be too sad.”
John brought him along to the point of aching, then eased himself away, swiped saliva from his chin with a brush of his fingertips.
I would like to meet with both of you at the earliest mutually convenient time to discuss some recent ongoing concerns about Rosamund’s work product, topics of conversation, and peer interactions. I wonder if she may be having some trouble coping with changes to her routines, and perhaps not handling her emotions in the most beneficial way for her. I understand you were separated over the summer, and I have often found in the past that when children have these kinds of adjustments to make, there are bound to be bumps along the way. As we all want nothing but the best for Rosamund both in school and at home, I feel it would help me better address issues during school time if I could speak with you about these issues.
“I’ll do my best.” He smoothed her hair, then her shoulder. Her fingernails were glittery pink. “Go on. Dad’s waiting for you downstairs.”
“Must rush not to miss the last pickup at the post box,” Sherlock said, almost apologetically.
“I only get three tries at this, and it’s really too cold for public sex in the shrubbery,” John admonished. Sherlock rubbed hard at his chest through layers of hockey jersey, dress shirt, and vest, trying to harden John’s nipples with brushing fingers.
Not too cold, though. Well, cold of course, but the air is so still and dry. See there, the snow doesn’t even stick to my shoes.
Sherlock, unbuttoning his shirt cuffs beside the kitchen sink, replied, “And you.”
“A bit. Woke for an hour or so in the middle.”
Sherlock dabbed at his coat’s sleeve with the end of his blue muffler, then raised the cuff to his mouth and licked off a blob of foam, which John found unexpectedly cute.
“Up against the bookcase—see that mirror? So I can watch your face.”
“I was—” Sherlock blurted, then caught himself. Took three steps back in the story and started to explain. “I have a case,” he began. “And Watson was occupied with other things. I only needed to cross-reference some topographical maps against tide schedules and—”
“We can’t stay,” Sherlock told her, lying just enough to spare her feelings. It was John’s good influence that he hadn’t stated plainly that he didn’t want to stay.
The rest of their afternoon was spent in the local park, where Rosie played with some school friends and Sherlock and John received congratulations and prettily-decorated cupcakes from Mrs Hudson, Sherlock’s parents, and others in their small social circle. Rosie required an extra-long bath to calm her down after a day so far out of her routine, with so many people asking her variations of the question, “Are you very happy?” She and John had only been living back at the Baker Street flat for a few weeks, and while of course she was happy, she’d also been out of sorts—waking at night needing reassurance and cuddles—and she’d expressed worry about whether she was really at home for good, not to John and Sherlock, but to their family therapist in a roundabout way during a session that had mostly centered on her playing with a dollhouse and then drawing a ferocious, dragon-like monster with triangular teeth, once she’d had enough of talking. Sherlock patiently combed her hair and read to her, then traced the alphabet across her pyjama-clad back until she dropped off, the judge’s handcrafted mystery animal tucked up beneath her chin. Downstairs, John awaited him with celebratory whisky and then a half-growled invitation to bed.
He watched the deliveryman leave, and after a few seconds went to check the lock. He started up the stairs to hand Sherlock his box.
“Children are resilient,” Sherlock offered, knowing it rang hollow. His hands were folded together on his lap.
“My private cell number,” Steven told him. “I have some things I can rearrange tomorrow afternoon, if you’ve the time.”
“Time’s it?” John pushed at his head, flinched from the tickling of Sherlock’s hair against his skin.
Sherlock’s party was sparsely populated with only a haggardly handsome cop (”DI Lestrade, best man at the Yard.” “Nice to meet you, John. Greg.” “Mm, I don’t think so.”), a pretty coroner (”Molly Hooper. She lets me abuse corpses now and then.” “Sherlock, you mustn’t keep saying that.”), Mrs Hudson (”Don’t you look handsome! Be a dear and pour me some punch?”), and John.
“Well, I suppose I’ll just play it by ear. There’s always porn.”
“We’ll have to leave here in twenty minutes, not to miss our train.”
And I can’t wait.” She was working up a whinge, her face set in a narrow-eyed frown.
“Right. Love from Unky Mycroft.”
“Firefighters have children. And helicopter pilots,” Sherlock had argued, reminding John that he was not so special. Because he was a father and because John admired him, Sherlock added, “Lestrade.”
Sherlock, dirty-smiling, let himself be guided. John was firm-jawed and his voice was low and rough in a way Sherlock relished; their dynamic had a beautiful fluidity, crests and troughs of give and take, but now and then he found just this sort of dramatic imbalance—a stormy and sudden fifty-foot wave that put them both off their feet a bit—was a welcome curiosity. By the time he’d been backed into the bedroom, Sherlock was willingly pliant and thrilled with imagination of what might unfold.
“You just look a bit off.” John reached and Sherlock allowed him a feel of his forehead. “Sort of flushed. And you’re sweaty.”
“Tell him,” John suggested. “Maybe in less demanding terms.”
John caught Sherlock’s gaze, raised his eyebrows. Sherlock grimaced over Rosie’s head and shrugged.
“Keep trying, I suppose.”
Sherlock patted his pockets.
Sherlock grinned and put pen to paper.
John sank into the armchair and Sherlock brought glasses of wine for each of them. Once he’d assumed his own usual place, John tilted the glass in his direction, and Sherlock returned the gesture. “I was not consulted about sending you that letter. Those papers,” Sherlock began. “I never would have approved it. The timing. The way things have been between us, the last month or two.”
“Neither, but I meant the drinks thing.”
“—ended our relationship, but if you consider her security and my vow of deference—”
“What’s your day like?” Sherlock asked.
“Are you tired? Need sleep?”
“Very well done,” Sherlock congratulated them both, eyes closed, but grinning. He squeezed his lips forward and John obliged him with a kiss upon them, then another.
“It’s not safe for her here,” John replied, mechanically lifting out objects from Rosie’s basket and dropping them into an army-issue canvas bag he held open. “
John gave it up for lost and switched to playing a mindless, anxiety-soothing game wherein he fired coloured balls at other coloured balls to explode pairs. The sound effect when the balls landed was satisfying. The high-pitched, unearthly swooping sound when they burst was tolerable.
She looked up to her left, checking in with herself. “Maybe a little? But not yet.”
“Mm-hmm. . .”
“I swear,” John told him, “Most of the day I felt like they were going to come for me. It’s the first time I haven’t reported to training camp in over twenty years. Kept getting this weird panic I wasn’t where I was supposed to be.”
. We will discuss the members of immediate and extended families in order to build vocabulary with new “super words” like
“At least if Watson grows up to be a psychopath, you’ll know it’s not my influence that’s done it.”
“Mycroft would never let that happen,” Sherlock began.
“Me, Rosie.”
“Not that we can’t. Only that we haven’t had to.”
“I’ll see if I can wedge it in.”
“Oh my god,” Kim exclaimed in an excitedly high pitch. John threw a puzzled glance Sherlock’s way; Sherlock shrugged.
He bit back noise, huffing air hard through his nostrils and then his open, silent mouth as he came, cum shiny and nearly the same shade of white as the marble of the floor it streaked. He panted away the last of it, felt the welcome softening of every adrenalised muscle. The quieting of his ever-racing mind to something like a dull howl, at least low-key enough to let him fall asleep. Optional morning skate. Maybe he’d go. Rather than fastening his trousers, he stripped off all but his boxer-briefs, tossed a hand towel at the mess on the floor and smeared it with his foot. Using dexterous toes to save him bending over, he deposited the towel in the tub.
“Something to do with illegal labour out of eastern Europe.”
They were barely inside before clothes started coming off. John yanked out the tails of Sherlock’s shirt and thrust grasping, groping hands up and under, stroking hard up the surface of Sherlock’s belly and curving rough around his pecs, teasing hardening nipples with his sweeping thumbs, while Sherlock unfastened his trousers and pushed them down his hips and thighs. He reached for John’s belt, feeling his way as John’s arms and his own shirtfront wrecked his view.
John returned to the bed, lay on his back in the dark, just listening, getting warm. Reminded himself to breathe. . .breathe. . .
He closed the distance between them with a half-step forward. John, gazing down at his hand being held in Sherlock’s, sighed again, then opened his eyes—deep blue, soft, with the evidence of all his life’s joy and pain etched around them perfectly; Sherlock knew each line by heart—and opened his mouth for Sherlock’s kiss.
He said it so casually, as if it were usual to order an 800-pound bottle of whiskey just to appease one’s downstairs neighbour. John felt his ears heating up.
“I’m off, darling,” John told her.
. As he neared the finish, John cleared his throat and snapped the dishtowel before returning it to its hook over the sink.
“You sure? I don’t want to step on your toes or whatever, but you brought it up.”
“Like I said!”
“Love you, Dadda,” she said. Another echo of their past; the name she called him before she began to worry what her playfriends might think, when all of them had already graduated to calling their fathers
Once outside, they started the walk back to their wide-open room, diaphanous draperies and the skylight over the bed with its view of bright stars in a black sky. John kept a firm hold of him, first by the hand, then around the waist, then with his fingers hooked into Sherlock’s back pocket. Had Sherlock not known better, it might have felt possessive, but given who John was—who they were together—Sherlock assumed a quite literal spell of can’t-keep-my-hands-off-you. Sherlock relished it, and their pace quickened as they neared their pavilion.
“Could you not just have played the part yourself? You seem pretty clever. Maybe did a bit of drama at the all boys public school, eh? Juliet? Or maybe Cleopatra.”
“Yes.”
“No?” John replied, half-listening. While his phone was in his hand, he texted Sherlock,
“Well, no, not fun exactly,” John corrected himself. “But I do enjoy the writing bit. That op-ed, too. If I could just write the words, stand up and read the words, and leave without having to talk to anyone, it would be ideal.”
Back on the sun deck, he passed John the sunglasses, then cast a glance toward the turquoise water and wondered, “Swim?”
Sherlock intoned, “If you’re trying to dissuade me from public sex in the shrubbery, you’ll have to try harder.”
“You’ve been very helpful,” John told her. “Thanks again.” As the two turned away from the desk, John dug his elbow into Sherlock’s ribs. “You minx.”
John let out a sigh of mixed relief and disgust, shaking his head. “Selfish idiot.”
When it became clear John was not going to respond to Rosie’s inquiry, Sherlock asked, mimicking her casual non-inflection, “What do you think?”
“I imagine perhaps less time than that, if you wear something memorable. Your red jumper with the pigeon on it.”
“Mad snogging in the too-small bed,” John told him, and there followed nuzzling kisses on throats, and nips along summer-stubbled jaws. “Trying to be quiet.”
“Not fine. I’ll be there in ten minutes.”
“Cold coming on?” Sherlock asked, knowing it was not the case. “I’m a bit of a germaphobe.”
Rosie’s feet had emerged from her rain boots pale and clammy and wrinkled, her socks damp with perspiration that smelled of absolutely nothing. She dressed for bed, self-reliant but still unself-conscious, delivering continuous patter while Sherlock fluffed her pillow and pulled back the bedding to make an envelope for her. A tilt of his head and a comically expectant look from Sherlock reminded her to drop her clothes into the round pink laundry hamper. Sherlock didn’t rush her; it was the weekend and so the schedule could be left a bit of breathing room. Once she’d arranged cuddly toys and blankets to her liking, put on socks then taken them off a few minutes later, and yawned twice, Sherlock assumed his station on the edge of the mattress and opened their book. Of course it had been several days since they’d last read, so he had to reverse a bit and remind them both of recent story-events. While he read out the chapter, Rosie wordlessly guided her fashion doll through some basic balletic choreography.
“Have you got any children?” Sherlock asked, leaning close and squinting at her as if in the midst of interrogation. Rosie giggled.
Just when too much became not enough, and Sherlock contemplated interfering on his own behalf, John hummed a knowing little tone, and began to stroke, tight and steady, inviting Sherlock’s complementary motion. “That’s it.” Sherlock gripped John’s arm, tight there just above his elbow. “Mm, fuck me,” John murmured, and Sherlock did, letting slide the last sense of self-consciousness, moaning, hips rolling, body rocking up to meet him. His orgasm began as a spike of lightning that liquified, molten, to ease him into softness, and he let go a long, low,
“I like to sit in the shop, though.”
“Has a bed?”
Sherlock crouched and settled, working from his right to his left, while the three took shots at him, a random assortment of high and low shots, with a third of them aimed at and above his right shoulder. A rhythm was established, giving him just enough time between shots to look for the next one. He saved anything they threw at the five hole, all but one down low on either side of his leg pads, and most of the shots up top, on his glove side or in the middle. Out of about twenty, he only saved one that came in high on his right.
Boston kept control most of the remaining four minutes of the second, had some good chances the Gold Rush goaltender robbed them of.  Just before the horn, Sherlock dropped a puck and covered it, though it should have been one he brushed aside; Kocur was nearby and with his long reach could have scooped up a well-placed rebound. The faceoff in his own end meant more pressure from the Rush, and they took three more shots before the siren went. Sherlock was at the bench in seconds, stomped down the tunnel without raising his mask.
“Should I worry if I get up for something to eat at three a.m. and you’re not around?” George’s question held in it the story of the previous night, without prying for details. Obviously he—liked everyone else in the league—now knew Sherlock was in a relationship with John, and it could hardly be missed that John was clearly not the one Sherlock had spent his after-game hours with.
“Which is why it’s very good.”
“I want to.”
Steven grunted, cursed, held his head and fucked his face; Sherlock was eager and repulsed, his own hand loose on his cock now and then, aching, catching his balance with a balled-up fistful of the bedspread, a scrabbling not-quite-close-enough grip of a table edge.
Sherlock felt boneless and blissful—of course, his man was a wonder—and after some awkward rearrangement, they found space to share the length of the sofa, eyes closed, John’s arm draped possessively around Sherlock’s waist. He was smiling. Sherlock wanted to sink into the sensation of weighty exhaustion, sleep away a few hours, wake up and fuck again, then eat, then fuck, then sleep, eat, fuck their way through the next three days. What was wanted and what was required were, tragically, so seldom one in the same. He rolled his head against the sofa’s arm, searching for a clock.
The day after Christmas found Sherlock and John closer to their own shared home in Boston, at a gathering of the huge, noisy Porter family, who had taken Sherlock on as one of their own years before, when he first met his young friend Jeremy and began visiting him regularly, to defend their backyard goal against Jeremy’s tennis-ball backhands. John knew not to score on Sherlock, only took his turns lobbing easily saved shots, and the two spent more time in the yard with Jeremy than indoors with the family, which was to all of their satisfaction. John swooned with pleasure at the buffet tables groaning with grandmothers’ recipes for ham, meatballs, chocolate cake, and iced sugar biscuits, and at the barely-contained chaos of seventy-five people of every age from infancy to old age all talking at once, balancing plates on their laps and unwrapping gifts. Sherlock seemed to be the only adult on hand who never tired of playing peek-a-boo with little Natalie; he found her genuine surprise to see him again after he’d vanished behind her pink security blanket as fascinating as it was adorable.
