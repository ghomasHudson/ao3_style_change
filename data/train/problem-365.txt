He didn’t have a long time to remain ashamed. The prince pushed him down onto his back until John could see nothing but pale flesh and hungry silver eyes.
The man grins at him, "Clawed his own way out mate. Went to hell and back and was reborn a different man. Last I heard, he'd turned a new leaf and opened up an Italian restaurant under his name in the middle of London." John smiles genuinely at Angelo this time.
“It’s just, you’ve been very distant lately. I mean, happier, for sure. You’re the happiest I’ve seen you in a long time. You don’t even need the cane anymore, and I know that there’s more to it than your physical therapy. But you’re also…shut off.”
Mycroft sat still in his chair, waiting for his brother's response. Sherlock twirled his fork around the pasta, which had long gone cold. "Tell me Mycroft, why are you so desperate to get him back? He wasn't even on your radar before I showed up. Now here you are, offering me dozens of lives and the safety of a country in exchange for one man. Why?"
Sherlock had checked his message machine several times from his mobile, but there had been no messages from John. Perhaps the man had forgotten about their encounter? The thought made him irrationally angry, but he dismissed it quickly. John had no reason to forget and he had seemed eager to meet again, so what was the hold up? Sherlock practically burned to talk to John again. He could be patient when it was required, but the repeated tapping of Sherlock's foot on the pavement showed he was close to his limit. He needed to be in John's space, to occupy his head and to know John and see him and hear him. It was time for another "accidental" meeting.
The friction lessens somewhat, and it just becomes hard and slick. Their hips move in time, their coarse hair bringing startling sensations. John is the one to come first. His movements become more frantic, more desperate. His hands can't find what to grip first. Sherlock's hair, his shoulders, the sheets. Sherlock swallows his aborted moan, and it feels like an anti-kiss.
Jim hushed him, but John hadn’t realized he was making sounds. “It’s as Sherlock said, we’ll put it away when you plead for us to fill you in its place.”
memories of them being in marital bliss, when they could barely smile at each other. Both of them wanted to be reminded why they had chosen the other in the first place.
“Why are you asking me?” The words left his mouth before he had the chance to know that was what he wanted to say.
And Sherlock hasn't even done anything but apply the ointment. After dinner, Sherlock will come in with a different movie (always one of John's favorites). They'll watch it like they did the first night. John in the corner, Sherlock on the couch, neither of them saying a word. Once it's done, John will come over without being asked, and sit still while Sherlock applies the cream. The whole time he does this, Sherlock will go on about how much more enjoyable their 'relationship' would be if John just gave in. Sometimes John has a retort, but mostly he sits in stony silence.
“Sherlock, a word?” John curtly requested as he jerked his head towards the kitchen.
Oh, glorious John. Wonderful, spit on the wound on the face of danger and rub salt in it, John. This was turning out to be so much fun.
So where could the attacker have gone? Sherlock dashes back into the alley. No fire escapes, no footholds he could have tried to climb up but-ah!
“Do you notice anything else?” John asked before the thought had come to fruition.
He didn’t knock on John’s door when he entered. An illusion of independence was fine, but John should always be reminded of Sherlock’s status. For John to think differently was to invite trouble upon himself.
Sherlock's used that time to look so thoroughly disheveled that he almost clutches John, slipping in his desperation. Though not in the way John thinks. "Thank you" Sherlock babbles "Thank you thank you so much the cab's this way." He runs a hand through his hair while briskly walking, and John's features tighten in concern as he scans the street. His lovely doctor attempts to diffuse the tension by cracking "If this is an attempt to get me to your apartment, all you had to do was ask."
Sherlock blinks, and his lips tighten fractionally. "Do you really not remember? Please tell me you are only acting the part of a complete idiot."
John stumbles a bit, suddenly dizzy. He's near the damned stool, and he has no choice but to lean on it. His vision is hazy and John can feel panic creeping in. He thinks back, but he hasn't eaten or drank anything since Sherlock's been in here. Maybe it is just a head rush? But John can hear something now, a whistling?
The chill wound its way through his stomach.
Sherlock has barely left him during this time. He lets John use the bathroom privately, but that's about it. He's there to sit beside him when they go back to their old routine of watching movies. Though Sherlock has skipped the facade of paying attention. He mostly types furiously on his laptop or his mobile while John stares blankly at the screen. Occasionally, he'll reach out from whatever he's doing and rest his hand against John's knee. John doesn't move toward or away from the touch.
Instead he sought to reign in the boy’s ego a little bit. Even if he can already tell that’s a laughably feeble task.
"You talked to him?"
“C’mon,” John encouraged, “this place has loads of stuff you haven’t been able to try yet. Museums, theatres, restaurants. There’s got to be something that can occupy that mind of yours.”
There was a distant screeching in the background, and it took him a full second to realize it was the kettle. How long had that been going off? He stomps to the kitchen and fills the mugs, not having looked at the mythological creature in his sitting room the whole time. Reflecting on his words, Sherlock realizes that he may have overstepped himself for good.
“What was that about?” John finishes, unmoving in their doorway even though the milk is leaking all over the carpet.
Sherlock pulls him forward a bit, so John is centered on the cushions. Now John has no choice at all but to curl upward. He grits his teeth against the pain and breathes through his nose. He's still got the device buzzing happily inside of him, but it's shifted slightly. Now it's edging his prostate, only promising stimulation. The teasing is maddening, but it's better than the constant press on his gland.
Warnings: Non-Con, Asphyxia
The slow surge back and forth feels as inevitable as a tide. There’s no stop to the sweetness of being filled, then left bereft, then filled again. Sweat trickles down John’s temples, and his hands clench with the need to twist through Sherlock’s hair, or scratch down his back, or entwine their fingers together.
“It’s absolutely worth it,” John promised. He scooped up a bit of cake and mascarpone onto his spoon, and held it out towards Sherlock. “Come on, just try a bite. God knows when we’ll get to eat here again.”
It’s John clenching around him in the throes of torment that gently pushes Sherlock into his climax.
Worms wriggled and crawled inside of him. They swam in his veins like salmon in a stream. They pushed and prodded their way through the blood dark tunnels, finding his secret places and burrowing inside of them. In and out of his body they dug furrows, tracing old paths and creating new ones by chewing through his skin and tissue.
“There was a new story printed about Sherlock today. It’s practically a tell-all. Here,” she handed him the newspaper she had been clutching, and John quickly flipped it onto the front page.
The entire time, Sherlock watched as John’s fingers disappeared inside of himself. His unnatural eyes barely wavered from staring at him, half-lidded and depravedly content. A low rumbling akin to a purr filled the space between them. John shuddered at the sound.
John's heart is in his throat, and he finds no way to express his gratitude. "Listen, if there's any way-"
John blinked when everything slotted together, “You live next to me?”
A telegram was dated to the first day he’d met Sherlock at a medical conference, which John had snuck into. “Encouraging new prospect. Look up Watson family at earliest convenience- SH”. John’s heart impaled itself on his ribcage.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes," John says, throat tight with shame, "I don't have an excuse." He really doesn't.
“Or, you panicked and dove for the nearest hiding spot.”
She took a gulp of coffee to get herself to stop talking, and then spluttered when the searing liquid hit her tongue. John pushed his chair back, but Molly waved her hand at him to get him to sit back down.
"Yeah, believe me, I know you can. Still doesn't mean you're talking to her."
It was when he got to ‘Ever since he was a young boy, Sherlock Holmes was figuring out the origins of mud stains on carpets,’ that John exploded, “Mycroft!”
“Your proficiency in underestimating your own charms never ceases to amaze me John. If someone truly got to know you and see you for the rare man you are, I’m sure they’d consider your status an obstacle rather than a deterrent.”
John didn’t say anything. Mycroft took that as a positive sign. He pulled out a small white card, and placed it on the counter beside him.
“No, but I’m not fond of mushrooms.” Sherlock said, and he looked a little amused at the question.
"Yes," Sherlock sneers, "What an amazing sense of character you have." Angelo's face twists, and he steps forward. The guns cock, and John shouts.
“What would you have me do then?” John frustratingly retorted, “Rave about like a madman about my visits from you and the supposed memories that are as lost to me as a sealed chest in quicksand? I’d be lucky if all they did was lock me away like a shameful secret.”
John felt cold sweat trickle down his neck. Did the cause of his ailment really contain so devastating an answer?
While he wanted to scream about what had been changed and hidden, he knew better than to draw attention to it. He’d already been thrown into doubt from the altered documents. To try and say that they had somehow replaced the doors, and swept away the glass in that brief span of time, would only discredit him further.
Moriarty opened the door. The previous incidents should have prepared John. He still possessed enough sense, or despair, to be surprised at the unaffected appearance of the room. Even the plants were perfectly upright.
“It’s rather urgent, if you wouldn’t mind,” Sherlock firmly said. He looked at John apologetically, who waved it away.
Sherlock laughed derisively, “No, actually. My first response was not to start partaking in hard narcotics. I was, regrettably, far more pedestrian.”
Sherlock works John’s trousers off of his hips, and John knows that now would be a perfect time to prove him wrong. He could slam his head into Sherlock’s nose, or twist away from Sherlock’s steady hands. Instead he raises his hips so Sherlock can slide his trousers down easier.
He and Sherlock were alone in the lot.
"Johnny" hefts a sigh that Sherlock sees more than hears in the din of noise. The woman continues to ramble on. "I tried calling you earlier, but you hung up! Rude!" She swats half-heatedly at his stomach and the man doesn't even flinch. "Hey Harry," (definitely sibling, not even close friends can get away with a nickname like that) "talking to Clara again?"
? Is this some sort of elaborate joke? The so inferred ‘mastermind’, behind a rag tag group of child drug pushers, is the bloody superintendent?”
But to John, in that instant, Sherlock was moving to place him back in the box. All because John hasn't responded to him. So John replies to Sherlock's answer. He's still got self-preservation left, then. Because John
Jim grins and says, "What a sight you are, and we get to have it all to ourselves too. Is it Christmas?" John smiles softly, his self consciousness appeased at Jim's genuine eagerness.
The loss of time, the feeling of dizziness, the aches and pains in his body when he awoke after bouts of amnesia. He hadn’t been poisoned, he’d been routinely sedated. In order to make him more cooperative, more pliant. To have him become a sexual plaything to two deranged and powerful men.
“Easy, easy,” John murmured. Sherlock’s whole being was alight with energy. John didn’t want him to burn out before they’d even started.
After that, there was only distant and murmured voices. A brief feeling of coolness over his abused skin. Then nothing.
“Oh, come on, John! I’ve been in your house. If it wasn’t for a sense of obligation and pity, she would probably be sleeping in the upstairs bedroom.”
All of it was hideously tedious. An accord here, a disciplinary action there, and occasionally a merciful pass thrown in for good measure. It made Sherlock’s teeth grind.
After what his punishment was for masturbating, he really doesn't like what might happen in an escape attempt. Probably not something as mild as extreme orgasm denial.
“No,” John said past the cotton dryness in his mouth, “I don’t. But I only held the poison, I didn’t consume it,” he opened up his hand that had held the leaves. On his palm, right below his longest finger, was a small cut.
"Sherlock dear! I'm glad I caught you," Sherlock isn't, but the way her eyes are tightened in worry makes him stop. But he still drums his fingers impatiently on the banister.
. Sherlock gives one fond pat to John's behind, then shuts the door behind him when he leaves.
Sherlock stared at him again, but this time it wasn’t out of disbelief. He seemed far more analyzing. John was resolved to not feel uncomfortable.
Consternation crept into John’s voice, “Sherlock, you can’t just skip classes because you feel like it.”
He moved like a shadow, quick and flitting, and John’s head was between his hands before John could even look behind him.
John inwardly cursed but replied pleasantly with, “Certainly. Though I wouldn’t call a cup of coffee suitable sustenance.”
Jim had been the only one disappointed at the disregard for a lavish celebration. “It just seems a shame. We finally have a chance to celebrate something and yet both grooms have opted for a ceremony so sparse it would make even the most frugal soul weep.”
It was a long chain of golden links. The chiming sound of them hitting each other was close to his ear, and when he numbly felt along the back of the device, he felt the soldered part where they attached to his collar. The word rang through his head like a tolling bell of doom.
. If he had one.
When John's foot touches the outside of his walls, nothing goes off. No one rushes him and electrocutes him, it's still dead silent. John takes one more step, then another. The anxiousness of waiting for the other shoe to drop makes him almost taste vomit.
Sherlock soon transformed and carried John to his new home. In John’s mind, it was more accurate to term it as his prison.
He followed after Sherlock, who took the stairs two at a time. Mrs. Hudson, didn't come out to greet them or see them off. She was too busy being caught up in her afternoon 'soother'. They reached the outside and Sherlock flipped up his collar against the slight chill.
your first demand? It's certainly a good thing you weren't a hostage negotiator. You do realize I could have small countries named after you before I'd ever let you out of my sight again?" Little chuckles shake Sherlock's frame, but John tries to push his point.
The gargoyle stands in front of him, but he is hunched. He continuously looks over Sherlock's shoulder, clearly ready to bolt to the relative safety of the rooftops if anyone comes near. Sherlock needs to get him inside before he takes off again.
John hasn't allowed anger to spur his words in a very long time, "That's enough Sherlock. I already said I wasn't going to do anything. So get your damned knickers out of the twist they're firmly lodged in and let's go back to-"
Apparently, the mixture of well tailored refinery and base protective gear is an unsettling one. And Sherlock doesn't attempt to fix what isn't broken. Also, the previous bloodstains are a nice touch.
Sherlock was already achingly hard, and had been since he had pushed the serf onto the bed. This had to be the longest he had drawn out his own pleasure, when most of his dalliances had been quick fumblings towards a mutual goal. But he found that forestalling himself held its own merits, such as watching the boy become a messy and sweaty heap. Sherlock noticed John had started to curl in on himself, as if he was preparing to sleep.
“Yes,” John hastily agreed as he tried to stand. Pain speared through his foot. When he started to fall, Ms. Hooper was there to balance him.
says the Voice. John clutches his head. There's nothing to concentrate on to ease the torments from his own mind. Nothing but blackness and his shaking breath.
them.
That was it. John orgasmed with all of the intensity of a sudden punch to his gut.
He paused in smoothing out the invisible wrinkles in his suit. “Sherlock will assume you’ll be easy to sway because of your sentiment towards him. But I’m beginning to see that you’re rather stubborn when it comes to his welfare.”
, John tells himself,
"Listen," Jim said into his coat, "When you bring back the doctor, just teach him his lesson. Let him know that any attempt at leaving you is pointless. That's the only push he needs Sherly. His stubborn streak will break when he sees just how far you can reach, and what the consequences are for trying to get away from you."
,” Sherlock snapped. “I haven’t seen him all day and we haven’t had a real opportunity together for some time, thanks to his ‘illness’.”
London was a city that was practically made for Sherlock. A place that he could map inside and out and still be surprised by it. Which would be something that John would love to be a part of.
He hears Sherlock hiss above him, but he doesn't lose his concentration. John licks a steady line from the bottom of his cock to the top, where he covers the head with his lips. Sherlock's hips stutter at the sudden heat. John groans around the stiffness. Sherlock was right. The presence on his tongue and the friction from Sherlock's prick helps ease some of the warmth from his mind.
She lingers her glare at Sherlock, but addresses the question. "Still mentally checked out."
“What?” John sputtered.
That chastised Sherlock well enough, for he nodded and said, “You’re right John. I apologize. I should have realized that I could entrust Moriarty with your well-being.”
When Sherlock turns back from watching him leave, the rain is finally showing him what he’s wanted to see this entire time. As if it needed John’s presence to coax it into behaving. Sherlock sees ‘yellow roses’, ‘lapis lazuli’ and ‘shield’, and knows that John is feeling just as loyal and content as he was the last time they had such an enlightening storm.
Something started dripping onto his face, and before he could register what angle he was in, a tube was placed directly on top of his lips. Eagerly, John wrapped around it and sucked. It was much like the bottles in hamster cages. The tube was plastic, and only admitted the glorious fluid whenever John pulled from it. Greedily, he kept sucking, only stopping for air. When he'd emptied the bottle of the last drop, it was pulled away.
“You always seem to share unique insight with us when Sherlock and I face a business dilemma.” This was true. While John was no expert at trading or economics, he helped them both unlock problems by offering the simplest solution he could think of. Even if it was the wrong way of approaching things, it helped steer them in the right direction.
In between time watching John, he's read up on all the advanced behavior modification techniques. While they have proved useful, he's unsure of how effective they will be. Or even if they will be too effective. He knows that he wants John to belong to him and only him. He wants John broken down, then reconstructed to fit his needs.
Sherlock had expressed concern but John waved it away. “A light dizzy spell, nothing more,” he’d reassured Sherlock, “a good night’s sleep and I’ll be perfectly fine tomorrow.”
Warning for Explicit Masturbation in this Chapter
Sherlock moaned openly when he thought about the lines in John’s brow becoming pronounced when he scrunched his face in disapproval. Would those same lines be deeper, or smoothed by the feeling of pleasure? Finally he would know for certain.
John jumps when he feels something being wrapped around his waist. He frowns behind the cloth. It feels, like a belt. Except that its somewhat elastic, and hugs his pelvic bones without a buckle. John knows better than to ask what it is. Something plastic crinkles as it is clipped onto place beside his hip.
Several people exclaimed their shock. From the opened door John could see a curious crowd gathering outside. Good, he thought, let everyone know what sort of people lived at the top of their town. Even if bars, or the hangman’s noose, laid waiting for them in their immediate future, mass gossip was just as bad as a public burning.
Sherlock grinned. So, either Mycroft still couldn't locate his headquarters, or, the much more likely route, his brother found his security as impeccable as always. They certainly had the motivation to be at their very best when it came to their bosses' place of work. Sherlock and Jim both had made the last incident an example of what happened to those who tried to seek employment elsewhere. The spy and the incompetents who had let him slip by had been begging for death by the end.
Mary had accepted, but refused to marry him until he got back. “For further incentive to not get shot,” she had explained, grinning to mask the wet sheen in her eyes as they’d stood together at the airport.
The unintelligible murmurs become clearer when John turns his head to face the door. His eyes remain unfocused, staring at Sherlock's silhouette. Over and over again, he whispers please.
"Oh John, you really have no idea why you're here do you?" Sherlock sneered. He stood from the chair, placed both hands on either side of John's head, and leaned in minutely. "Let me lay to rest any sort of theory you have spinning around in that head. You're here because of me. You're here for me. Because I want you, because you fascinate me, you're here in this cell. And you will never leave, until I know that you won't run from me."
Clearly carnivorous, it's a wonder why he simply doesn't just eat his victims. That thought was possibly Not Good.
John’s hands spasmed on the table, grabbing up fistfuls of cloth. He took twenty seconds to remember how to think beyond the heady fog in his head. He shifted in his seat, because to stay still meant he would go insane.
Mary’s side of the bed was clay cold. He tried not to roll onto it all night.
“My—my
"I'll be passing them around now, and if you have any opinions about your grade, I suggest you keep them to yourself." John hears the shuffling of papers, followed by groans of dismay and sighs of relief. With each step closer, John slumps further in his seat. When he sees Holmes' shiny shoes beside his desk, John squeezes his eyes shut. The paper is placed, and his teacher moves on. John opens his eyes, his heart in his throat. The paper is placed face down, and John slowly brings it over to him. He wishes Holmes had just left it face up, and let him get it over with.
It's John's turn to look surprised. His mind races, but he can't think of any conversations he's had with Sherlock that had anything to do with an important function. They had their usual argument over whether or not they got to have a night watching a mindless movie or going out to see a play. It's always John that wants to go outside, and Sherlock that doesn't want to share. But that had been resolved as quickly as it had begun, with the normal outcome. Sherlock had gotten his way.
John moaned, and one of his hands gripped the arm that still kept him trapped against Sherlock’s chest. He clutched at it as if it were an anchor. That seeking for something stable to ground himself spurred Sherlock on, “Were you truly unaware John, of how much seeing you like this affects me?”
John was sure he had fallen asleep at some point. He had been exhausted enough that sleep seemed as inevitable a calling as death itself. Yet he was staring at the wall of his room, wide awake, with Sherlock now pressed up against his back. The only significant difference was the empty sockets of his sister boring into him from her crouched position by the bed.
As they both stumbled into the cab, weary beyond belief, John couldn’t remember when he’d felt so at peace. His body had been pushed beyond its limits, but he had done it for a good reason. He knew he would gladly do it all over again.
When John starts to awaken, he thinks he's still in the box, but that his subconscious had finally taken pity on him.
John nods, "Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Police are on their way. Um-" John rubs the back of his neck. He already owes this man, he doesn't want to trouble him further, but-"listen, is it okay if I stay inside, until they get here? I won't be any trouble, I swear."
“Oh shit,” John said, “my gun. If they found it--”
John feels Sherlock’s fingers pinch the back of the knot to keep him from moving his head too much, while he sees the free hand reach for something in the top of the closet. Sherlock pulls down what he was looking for, and dangles the black leather cuffs in John’s peripheral vision. He’s just letting them swing there, giving John ample time to fight back.
John hopes he's convincing when he says, "Yeah, fine," half truths, half truths are the only things that will work, "just, a woman sat down as soon as you left, kinda threw me through a loop." Best to come clean with the gender now. Sherlock might be able to tell from a fucking trace of perfume or something, and ambiguous wording would only get him into trouble.
He rushes over to the sink, and turns on the tap. The cold water splashes the sides of his hands, and John breathes, trying to get himself under control. He looks up at his reflection, and almost doesn't recognize the deathly pale man staring back. His eyes have deep, dark circles that bring his deep blues into sharp contrast. John feels a bit of acid leak onto his tongue, and spits into the sink. It gets lost in the water, and flies down the drain. A few more deep breaths, and John leans his head against the mirror. The cool glass helps to ground him, and John can feel some of the anxiety leave his soul. He feels tired now. Tired and so, so relieved. Fuck, but that had been close. Way too fucking close. If Sherlock had come by any sooner-
Before John could ask how Sherlock knew he even had a gun, the boy flopped back onto the table and groaned in deep pain. The medics rushed through at the next second. After that, it was a whirlwind of questions that John had to lie about. He could have broken the secrecy. He could have tried to spin it as a teenager’s idea of a prank, but something in him told him to trust Sherlock. Which was absolutely baffling, since he had just admitted to lying to him for over a month.
His indecision dearly cost him.
And the gargoyle's face is suddenly filled with an overwhelming amount of greed that it makes Sherlock's eyebrows raise. Quickly, he brings it back under control, but there's still a desperate hope in his eyes.
The lovely detail that Sherlock keeps to himself is the butterfly chrysalis John is unknowingly carrying in his coat pocket. John had practically flown after their culprit, and Sherlock gets to see freshly discovered limits sparkle with possibility in John’s eyes.
When they arrived home, John was grateful that the cabbie accepted cards, as he didn’t have nearly enough cash to cover the expense.
He pulled himself out of bed to immediately wince at the soreness that made itself known. No matter the preparations Sherlock had thoroughly bestowed him, such aches couldn’t be avoided. He sighed and resigned himself to catching up on medical books while he recovered.
He would have thought Sherlock would be like any other teenager being seen naked by a new lover, awkward and self-conscious. It was as if Sherlock didn’t have the time to be worried about himself. He was too focused on John, as his eyes never strayed away when he slowly lowered himself down.
“Yes of course,” Sherlock said as he stood up. He registered John’s words and looked down at him, perplexed, “You didn’t think dinner was the only thing I had planned for tonight did you? It doesn’t take me six hours just to set up a reservation.”
It was John’s fault, so he would fix this. He breathed in through his nose, and turned the heat of his shame into a forge that would give him the strength to do what was necessary.
The word ‘instigate’ was quite a funny word to hear underneath a stream of blood and a wad of tissue, but John didn’t bring attention to it.
“Ah, nonsense, it’s worked for me all these years. But you certainly require more hardy fare yes? I believe the cooks left something for you when you awoke. Join me and sit, I’ll retrieve it.”
"Just, you know, told her the seat was taken and that she should get lost. She was pretty sloshed though, turned out she didn't hear me. Otherwise I probably would've had a face full of wine. I think she spotted her mates, just hobbled off in that direction. " John points vaguely behind himself to where Mary disappeared. Sherlock briefly looks where John is pointing, and he hopes to God she isn't in the pub anymore. Sherlock's eyes come back to scan John's face, and he prays and prays that he's as convincing as he sounds in his own head.
"Um, wow, there are not enough ways for me to say no." Sherlock's head tilts to the side.
The tiny doctor part of him is screaming at the absence of a condom and the consequences of unsafe sex. The slightly larger soldier part of him is planning how to break Sherlock's bones in several places once the drug's worn off. But the rest of John is struck dumb with horror that this is actually happening to him.
John would have gladly joined his wailing sister in the sewers if it meant his escape from this nightmare.
John’s startled laughter bent him forward. “What? What are you talking about?”
His eyes glow white when he turns to face down his attacker. The leader from earlier lets his bloody knife drop to the ground, and he backs away, his skin chalky and clammy in the sickly yellow streetlight.
"I think so, but she was too busy picking her jaw up off the pavement to really respond. I dove into the cab with a promise to fill her in later." John's closing the cupboard above his head, when his hand is entrapped by one much larger and paler than his own. The empty bags flutter around his feet when Sherlock presses against his back. His growl ghosts over John's ear and neck.
John inwardly shivers at how accurate that metaphor is, to equate Sherlock with Afghanistan. They’re equally as alluring to John’s fucked up addiction with danger. Sherlock twists his fingers on John’s thickening member, and his deep voice continues to unravel John’s mind.
The last of the sleeping gas has worn off. There is nothing muffling his sensations, no excuse for the crest of pleasure overtaking his body. It's just him and Sherlock now. And John is forced to enjoy it.
Forgoing gentleness, she yanked the rest of it down with the ease of a butcher and a hung rabbit. His arm bone glistened black with his own blood in the moonlight.
“Oh,” Sherlock seemed to deflate, and it was hard to tell if it was out of relief or disappointment that what he’d researched had been for nothing.
Sherlock gave a small nod.
He stood there in awkward silence as water dripped onto the floor. “I—uh—just went for a walk. Didn’t think it would get so bad.”
, and saw the photographs of Venice framed on the walls, heard the low murmur of conversation and sonorous music from unseen speakers. There was the scraping chime of silverware against plates, and the soft pat of wine glasses being set back down onto tables. Nearby, a woman laughed in a way that suggested she wanted her companion to enjoy the sound of it.
his mind whispers triumphantly. He grins into the offered wrist, and covers the arm in the same way as the pair.
“Sherlock, really,” John chided, “you’re acting childish. I know you’re busy, and Jim makes good company. Come join us when you’re finished.”
John spluttered on his ill-timed sip of coffee.
Each desperate breath he took rattled in his desiccated lungs. His lips were withered and pulled back against his teeth in a hellish grin.
Sherlock groans, throwing his head back against the couch in exasperation, “John, that was awful.”
“I take it you stopped him then?”
John often forgets how strong Sherlock is. From squirming uselessly to suddenly lying flat on his back, he barely had time to realize that the room was spinning around him. And there’s no pain from the abrupt shift either, as Sherlock’s made sure that he doesn’t jar anything on the way down.
Mycroft pursed his lips, and didn't answer. Sherlock glared at him, his eyes searching. When the answer clicked in his mind, Sherlock smirked. "Ah, I see. He may not have been on your watch list, but he does have a very useful set of skills. Skills that would only fan the flames of my progress. Not exactly easy to have an assassin get the drop on me if I have a trained fighter by my side, is it?"
Sherlock’s hand reached up to turn John’s face towards his own, “You really are quite striking. Prone, helpless, unable to resist the sensations inflicted upon you.” His eyes took on a considering light that made a keen stab of betrayal flare in John’s chest, “It tempts the possibility of a repeated performance.”
He's almost licked his plate clean when he realizes something's wrong. When he gets up to get a drink, he fumbles, and catches himself on the table. His vision narrows, and he concentrates to keep himself awake. The last thing he wants right now is to go unconscious again. He tries to put weight on his legs again, but it won't work. He feels like his legs are cut off from the rest of his body. The sensation is so believable that he stupidly looks down at his own legs to make sure they're attached. That's why he doesn't see Sherlock come in, or see him wheeling in something large.
He stared down silently like a judge who held the weight of John’s life in his hands.
Sherlock laughed again, and John smiled with him. He was struck with the urge to say something. John knew he shouldn’t fluff up the kid’s ego like this, but he needed to make sure that Sherlock understood this.
The only time Sherlock will have cause to worry is when John completely stops reacting to his own mind. Sherlock distinctly remembers that as the time Sebastian had broken. When he'd stopped screaming, yelling, mumbling, or even glaring. The man had taken everything, from knives, whips, electrocution and solitary, in dead silence.
“John, please,” Sherlock begged, “you aren’t making any sense. I know this must be confusing for you, but come home and we’ll sort this out after you’re safe.”
Sherlock’s clearly caught on to John’s realization, as he stares unabashedly as John gulps down the water. When John takes a moment to breathe, Sherlock is pushing the glass back up to his lips insistently. John only complains by rolling his eyes before obediently swallowing the rest.
"No," Sherlock waves his hand in dismissal, "go whenever you want to, just be sure to pick up what I asked."
Sherlock twitched. A brief look of regret passed over his face, but he answered honestly, “I believe that you see these apparitions. In regards to them having any real substance outside of the fanciful, no, I do not.”
With a frustrated huff of breath, Sherlock pulled away first. John was about to rectify that, but realized Sherlock’s intentions were to get his own shoes off.
he thought to himself. He knew that to be true, but if there was a chance he could talk to his sister, then he wanted to try, no matter the validity of the sentiment.
“John,” Sherlock said in a way that suggested his patience was at an end, “you didn’t come over here to talk about how I arrived home.”
He could attempt to break into the locked section himself. John wasn’t an expert at picking locks, but Harry and he had learned a few things in their mischievous and daring youth. He’d need a few tools, but they were easily acquired or fashioned. After that there would be no delay to head into town. Sherlock could try and run in front of the horse himself and he’d be shoved out of the way or learn to dodge.
John felt air in his lungs in the deep places that can only be reached when one is desperately running for their lives.  He realized that the gunshots had stopped. He thought about the kind of handgun a teenager would own, how many bullets it was capable of containing, and how many times the kid had fired into a wall or at nothing.
Even with his eyes open, Sherlock could only see John’s navel. He had no way of knowing if John was twisting the sheets or clenching his fists on open air. Was he gritting his teeth or was his mouth open in a soundless exhale?
John yelled as he flew through the air. With his breath knocked out and exhaustion finally catching up to him, he wasn’t planning on another ill-advised dash. Sherlock’s claws came down around him anyway.
“Yes, absolutely. You really…that was all because of my kit and my—“John cut himself off from saying cane. He realized that, ever since this strange boy had walked into his infirmary, he hadn’t been using it. It was unobtrusively propped up against the wall, where he’d last put it.
Turns out his doctor voice was right as usual. He creaks as he stands up. He's uncomfortably sticky, and John really doesn't want to remember why. But the memory of a shuddering body pinning his sharpens in his mind anyway. John swallows his bile. He slinks to the sink, his throat tightening when his steps are awkward. In his peripheral he spots the blinking red light in his prison.
“No!” Sherlock and Jim both shouted. John reeled under thoughts of metal gags, rooms with stuffed sacks along the walls, and surgical steel rods, unable to protest.
Blood divination, however, is something he can perform with admirable skill. Though for some reason that always seems to put people off more than the thought of a corpse being re-animated.
He swallowed against the hurt that thought brought.
“None of that Johnny. As much as I understand that you would be sincere in whatever you were about to say, it’s quite unnecessary. Sherlock and I only deal in truths after all. Now let’s get back to the house before your food becomes unpalatable.”
He would run, John decided. It would not be an easy escape and an even harder life. For he would never be able to interact with another community, lest Sherlock burn it to the ground out of revenge.
John pulls away, turns his head towards the source of the noise, and all higher functions of his brain abruptly stop. His crush of a whole month is standing in front of him, topless and, judging by the tent in his trousers, completely aroused. He's all milky planes of skin and sharp angles. The only clear thought John can form is that he can see Sherlock's ribs. Dumbstruck, John's hand touches the torso in front of him before he even realizes what he's doing. Coming into contact sends an electric jolt straight from his arm to down his spine.
“Easy now Johnny,” Jim murmured. He undid the stopper to the bottle, attached to which was a dropper filled with the tincture. As he pinched John’s nose closed he said, “We don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“It’s a candlelit meal….in a hospital?” He needs to make sure. He needs to make
John, ever the soldier, turns to face him. He's backed up against the wall, Sherlock's hands on either side of him. He doesn't look away when Sherlock practically snarls, "What I'm interested in is the little coup d'etat you two
John went to sleep in a most fitful state. It seemed that no matter what excuse he thought of, his mind looped back to the strange drink and the secrets being kept from him. Sherlock never returned to bed, but that was no wonder. They had yet to discuss their argument and reach a civilized conclusion.
John frowned, but nodded. The man had conceded defeat, and John would be the worst sort of scoundrel to attack now.
“I think…I think I would like to tell you everything else.”
Holmes peers at him from across his pointed fingertips, and sighs from his nose. "I've told Mr. Moriarty about your blunder. He seemed rather surprised as well."
"And this wouldn't be losing. I'd still win. I just wouldn't be able to see it happen." John grins, feeling some of his old self slowly seeping back. But it's different now, his soldier training is not focused on escaping. It's focused on Sherlock. The gauntlet has been thrown, and he needs what he once was if he wants to win this fight.
“So,” Molly tried again, holding the styrofoam cup between them like a shield, “having a good morning?”
The man catches her attention by placing a firm hand on her shoulder. Sherlock darts off to the side where he can watch without being seen. He wants to analyze a bit more, there is still something about this man that speaks to him. That says there's more for him to deduce if he just waits a little longer.
John breathed deeply, which soothed out his sensitivity so it wasn’t as encompassing. “Okay, go,” John said. There was no hesitation in his voice. Little by little, Sherlock eased himself inside.
"Very ambitious of you. When you're done with exhausting all of your options, come join me." Sherlock pulls something out of his coat, a tiny device with a button. When Sherlock turns it, the lights dim down almost entirely, and John's kind of reeling from the sudden change. He hadn't realized how long he'd been living in constant light until just now.
The benefit of going against a group that thought themselves clever, was that they had no reason to worry about a plan backfiring. None of them noticed as Sherlock stood in the doorway. The benefit of going against cruel people, was that they tended to take their time.
He reaches up with his other hand to lightly pinch and twist John’s nipple, cataloging what John sounds like when he gasps around wet silk.
Sherlock picks up a new set of pliers, inspecting the gleam from the fluorescent lights. The man is yelling behind his gag, thrashing even though it causes him intense pain.
“Oh no you don’t,” Jim crowed. He leapt and tackled John to the ground. “Ready to leave so soon Johnny? We were just in the middle of a conversation. It seems rather rude of you to leave,” he continued to speak while John grappled with him on the ground.
He found a group of about a dozen teenagers lounging about on pilfered or salvaged furniture. Some were playing a card game, others were having a quiet conversation while drinking some terrible beer, and a couple were standing next to what had to be at least one hundred ounces of cocaine, all of it was neatly packaged in white bricks on a table.
John escapes the next day.
A low growl reverberated through Sherlock’s throat as he stared at his captive, “You will not be free of me John. Not ever. You are
Sherlock looked at him with a touch of his own confusion, mixed with a slight bit of wonder. “You don’t mind then?”
He sat amongst the flowers, listening to the gentle patter of snowfall. Very soon, his acknowledgment of his luck and privilege no longer felt like an ill-gotten gift, but a genuine blessing.
When Sherlock starts to look embarrassed, John peals into more laughter.
Warm adoration spreads through Sherlock’s chest at the sight of John’s mindless blabbering. It takes a great deal to break John down to this stage, and it’s always a marvel when Sherlock manages it.
"NO!" John screams, and three things happen at once. The chair he's flung himself from hits the floor, the windows from the front room crash in, and the door to the kitchen is blown wide open. The sound rings in his already swirling head, and John ducks down to avoid any debris.
“Don’t you dare,” John snarled, “don’t you dare use that word with me. Not after all that you’ve done. All of the vile things that you’ve enacted upon me, and you dare to say you’re in love with me. You don’t deserve love.”
“But I value you more. You know I do. They only care about your skills as a physician. I won’t have any need of that.”
“If you agree to give me updates, nothing untoward, just to inform me of how he’s doing, then I will relocate his handlers onto more productive projects.”
John remembers the hallucinations. He remembers feeling adrift and forever tumbling through a vast expanse. He remembers the imaginary thrashing of waves against his tiny cage. He remembers being helpless to the demands of his body.
, and then scaring me half to death.”
The target was clear across the warehouse, and the support was thin, but a tense second after he had pulled the trigger, he heard the sharp ricochet of metal on metal over the yells of the boys below. If the sound of the gunshot wasn’t enough to distract them, the horrible screeching of metal giving away and iron smashing into a concrete floor from a six meter drop certainly did it.
“Appreciate what?”
He sees the woman being dragged into an alley across the street. Unbidden, a growl works its way up John's throat. He works his way back, and glides to the other street thanks to a lucky updraft. He lands a little more silently this time, granting him the element of surprise.
John cleared his throat, “Can we talk? Inside?”
“You could have been fallen, you could have died! What would you have done if I hadn’t just arrived to catch you?”
"By the rock, what's happened to your flat?" Sherlock turns around in alarm when he hears the outcry, but nothing is amiss.
“The circumstances are not ideal,” Mycroft’s dry tone carried through the connection with pointed emphasis, “but I would be a fool to not notice how he’s behaved differently around you. Staying in his classes, a stable and routine schedule intermingled with yours, and an actual interest in another human being’s welfare. You should be awarded some international prize.”
Honestly. Idiocy knew no bounds.
Sherlock inspected the rest of the alley, trying to find anything discarded that could lead him to the perpetrator. Infuriatingly nothing. Quickly, the novelty of the scene was wearing off. He was starting to find this annoying.
Lestrade nodded, "Torn to shreds, starting from the stomach. Bastard looked like he'd been mauled by a bear. One of the rookies threw up when they saw him," he grimaced at the memory, "there were others, but all unconscious and breathing. Though some had some serious concussions and internal bleeding. Police were on the scene right after the dust had settled. No sign of the guy that beat them bloody."
“Looks like he’s back with us,” Jim drawled, prone beside John’s body. He trailed a hand down John’s skin and dragged his thumbnail over an exposed nipple. John shifted, his moan cracking in his dry throat.
It had felt good. More than good, it had felt great to see that humor in her again.
“I just—I don’t think I can take a trip right now Mary. It was a good idea, really. But—I’m not sure a vacation is the best--”
“Oh,” Sherlock looked like he wasn’t sure how to proceed. “Good then.”
“It’s all in your mind,” John told himself, his lone voice seeming loud in the anticipatory hush. “It’s only stress,” he reassured himself, “you’re mad at Sherlock, and that’s playing tricks on your perceptions.”
Sherlock gives a reassuring squeeze to John's shoulders, but still backs away. John stumbles forward for a step, seeking out the only human interaction he's had in quite a number of hours. But nothing's there. He gropes, not leaving the soothing rush of water, but no hands reach back.
It's two days before John starts to feel close to human again. He still has to leave the lamp on before sleeping, and if he feels clustered in any way his breathing starts to shorten, but he doesn't flinch at nothing anymore. He doesn't scream thinking he's being pulled down into bottomless water. He can move, breathe, sleep and, (he's never taking this for granted ever again) piss normally.
He thought about all of the pitying looks he got in the shops. He thought of the way people respectfully moved out of his way in the halls. He thought of the x-rays that hadn’t shown anything wrong with his leg, yet it still ached enough for it to be an integral part of him. The image of the unused master bedroom upstairs flashed through his mind.
John smiled at her, “I think that’s a fantastic idea. I’ll let him know.” It would help, John thought. It would help that Mary wanted to be involved as well, that way he wasn’t the only one who appreciated Sherlock’s genius.
John remembered the delight he’d seen in Sherlock’s eyes at having someone who recognized his genius and praised him for it, rather than envied or scorned him. Crushing guilt threatened to buckle his resolve. But John needed answers. And no one was willing to give them to him.
The man has, once again, managed to beat him to the best thing he's ever discovered. He wonders if the creature is even working for his brother, which sends skitters of displeasure up his spine. But, no. That doesn't fit. Mycroft would have a creature of this kind working in top secret missions across the globe, not dealing with the underbelly of London.
“My goodness, you are worse than an easily distraught mother,” John teased as he reached for the vessel to pour his coffee. Sherlock grabbed it before he did, as well as his cup and saucer.
He rests his chin on his folded hands, watching as John still refuses to answer. His silence is far from withholding. Sherlock can see every conflicting emotion play out as if John’s face were a screen.
“I,” John needed to find out why words kept slipping from him today. “I’m married, Sherlock.” Like he didn’t know. As if they weren’t standing outside the door to John’s home right now, where there were two sets of plates, and toothbrushes, and chairs, and a large bed in the downstairs room that hadn’t been a host to coitus in well over a year. As if John wasn’t wearing a ring on his left hand, one that suddenly felt like a link to a chain.
Harriet always promised to take him away if that ever became a reality. But it was always easier to simply put up with their monster of a parent and tend to the farm. When they’d received the news that he’d had his head smashed in, John hadn’t wept.
Sherlock sighed and waved his hand for emphasis, “Haven’t you been listening? I said a major drug ring has nestled its way into this lazy town, and you think it will come toppling down with one spoiled teenager? No, either he says nothing out of fear or misplaced loyalty, or his cohorts find out about his arrest and either flee or destroy the evidence. I just needed to see him after he’d come back from wherever he gets his supply. His clothes and shoes told me all I needed to know about their location.”
He considered sleeping on the chair in the room. Probably slightly better than the floor, and he couldn't be paid to sleep on that damned bed. Thoughts of sleep were chased from his mind when one of the armed guards rushed in, brandishing his...taser?
Sherlock's eyes gleamed, and Lestrade tried not to be too disconcerted about it.
He went back to occupying his time in the greenhouse and his studies. He felt he was making steady strides on his goal towards learning the complexities of human health. He was confident enough in his abilities that he brought up the possibility of attending medical school to his husband.
It wasn’t like it would be hard either. He was a smart kid, and charming when he wanted to be. His inadvertent fame meant he would likely be getting offers from many other teenagers. It didn’t hurt that Sherlock was far from bad-looking.
“No you don’t.” He says it with such confidence that he might as well be proclaiming that he’s clever, “You don’t because you value your life too much.”
John has a huge grateful smile on his face and gushes, "Hello sir, thank you again so much for-" John stops when he notices Mr. Moriarty.
The sensation is more than a little weird for John. It borders on the edge of painful. An area that has never been penetrated before is suddenly being filled. He doesn't move though. Just breathes unsteadily through his nose as the soft tube travels through his urinary tract. Sherlock keeps adding more lubrication as he sees fit until John can barely register just how much is being fed into him.
And even then, Sherlock doesn’t clutch or squeeze John in surprised gratification. He just opens his mouth. And now John can mostly taste champagne on Sherlock’s tongue, but without any sour flavor of alcohol. Their tongues press gently against each other, simply exploring the other’s mouth in lazy pleasure. John wonders if Sherlock can taste his heartbeat as much as John can taste the champagne.
The wheels on the chair are obscenely loud as Sherlock pushes himself towards John. Suddenly, the soldier is lying on his back, his head is swimming from its impact to the floor, and there's a very shiny shoe pressing down on his midsection. Sherlock grinds down, and John is scrambling for purchase on the carpet. He's not sure if his lack of air is the wave of euphoria, or Sherlock still steadily pressing downward with his sole. The pressure eases back, and John bucks up to get more of it.
Then Sherlock's thrusting with intent, and he's hitting the prostate dead on. John breaks, and his pant for breath turns sharply into a moan. John can't cut off his next moan. Or the next. Or the next. Sherlock slathers more lube onto his fingers with his free hand, and continues to drive John insane. When he adds a third finger, John whines through his nose.
God, the man's mouth is positively sinful. One hand is on his hip, while the other gently cradles the back of his head. Sherlock playfully nips at John's lips, and the teen is so distracted that he momentarily forgets there's a second person.
Sherlock carefully set his violin to the side. He stood up in a fluid motion, like a massive predator conserving its energy to prepare for a lunge. “What?”
something worn and tired reminds him before he slips into slumber.
Yet the sight of Sherlock nude and unashamed continued to take his breath away. Sherlock noticed his dumbstruck look, and smirked at it. He stepped forward into John’s space, lifting his unmoving hands away from his shirt.
"Good boy John," Sherlock says, carding dry fingers through his hair. John wants to tense in indignation at that, but he stays pliant. If he's going to survive this, he has to play along for now.
At first, he relegated the sound to branches moving against the glass from the icy winds outside. But there were no trees that hung so close to the greenhouse, and the air outside appeared still.
John sighed as he felt his anger evaporate. Sometimes John forgot just how new and foreign such feelings must be to a dragon. “I do enjoy your company Sherlock, and I care for you a great deal. But we have lives and experiences outside of each other,” he placed his free hand over Sherlock’s and the dragon flinched but didn’t release him.
"So then, you're just accustomed to taking in weirdos with bad fashion tastes?"
“It’s nothing,” John deflected as he sat down at the table, “just a troubling dream last night.”
Warnings: Non-Con, Orgasm Denial/Forced, Fingering
The only thing he didn’t like was how far it placed him from Sherlock. If he was immediately needed, there wasn’t much he could do aside from providing a distraction.
“I-I don’t know,” John rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. He deeply ached in an intimate place, which started to alarm him. How had he been injured
Its movements aren't random. From Sherlock can see from its back, the stone is moving up and down in a steady rhythm. It's...
Most of it is just stories. A few forward-thinking witches and their supporters work to undermine those pop culture references. Articles upon articles about why it is harmful to view all types of witches (even necromancers and blood-whisperers) as destined to become bent crones, mad wizards, or manipulating temptresses.
Sherlock must be able to see that, because his laughter deepens.
John chokes, and passes a hand over his eyes. There’s an empty pressure in his head, and if he squeezes hard enough, maybe it will make his skull explode all over the dinner table. “Some life,” he mutters, not caring if Sherlock hears or not.
Furious indignation twisted in John's gut. Who exactly was to blame for his 'rectum' being scratched to bits? Before John can even curl his fist, Sherlock's gripping his wrist tightly. He forces John close, and murmurs dangerously. "The cameras are still rolling John. Don't pretend to be an idiot." It's a lie. The only access to the live feed is from his laptop. He's the only one allowed to see John like this. Ever.
He pushes open the door with his shoulder, and sends a wry, "I'll just get this myself, shall I?" to the form splayed on the sofa. Of course John doesn't expect help or a reply. He doesn't mind. John actually likes doing the menial chores that Sherlock can't be bothered with. It keeps him occupied.
At the shop, it was an entirely new battle to get Sherlock to pay attention. Every other aisle it seemed Sherlock wanted some food or sundry item to test its flammability or other random experiments rather than use it for its intended purpose. Sherlock made up for the headache by airing everyone’s dirty laundry.
“I’ve had the weirdest day,” John offered by way of explanation to his improved mood.
“Ah, yes,” the boy’s voice suddenly sounded rather abashed, “that was the other thing I’d meant to point out. Your limp is psychosomatic. Which, as a certified surgeon, you probably already know but haven’t been able to cure. I suspect it’s to do with adrenaline and the subsequent loss of it due to a repetitive lifestyle, but it’s dangerous to jump to conclusions without sufficient data.”
John shifts the blankets off of himself so he can get more popcorn and calls out, “Change it to something else will you? I’ve had my fill of depressing things for the day.”
John led them directly to Jim’s room and the safe. “It’s been a night since I’ve uncovered their secrets,” he warned the officer, “so I would like to impress upon everyone here, that a complete lack of documentation in this safe should be deemed as curious, if not outright suspicious.”
By the time John was done with his shift and nearing home, the novelty of the day had worn away. He felt absolutely ridiculous. What was he doing, getting such an entertaining and almost fulfilling experience from a whip smart teenager? Was he really that desperate for something different in his life?
“Meanwhile, this will all be nothing more than an extremely vivid dream when you awaken. You may remember everything, and dread each night, but you will have no proof of it,” Sherlock’s words rumbled in John’s head, as timeless and terrible as thunder.
Then Sherlock moves, and John can't help but cry out, "NO! DON'T!", but his words are abruptly cut off when the door clangs shut. The lock clicking into place is horrendously loud.
It's when Sherlock starts to pull off John's cheap and generic socks that he catches on. Sherlock slides the box closer to him, and pulls out one of the cashmeres. Before placing it on John's foot, he brings it up onto his knee, and John idiotically panics that his feet will somehow leave a stain on Sherlock's suit. Sherlock seems to sense this somehow, and runs his thumb soothingly along the arch. He leans down, and places a reverent kiss on the skin he was caressing, before gently sliding the sock on.
It takes John a stunned second to process what the fuck just happened.
Sherlock meets his demands, picking up his pace until John has no room left for any thought except ‘more’. Each thrust is punctuated by a wrenching noise from John’s throat. Sherlock is murmuring gentle reassurances, and it’s then that John hears his desperate pleas that he had mistaken for moans.
“Clearly I should have sent for a tutor a while ago,” Sherlock wasn’t necessarily shouting, but his words seemed to fill the room with a malicious miasmic quality, “if you come up with these ridiculous theories in order to cure your boredom.”
John managed to imperceptibly nod his head in thanks. They were given another dish, something with crushed ice that tasted slightly of rum and sparkling wine. John’s not sure if more alcohol is really advised at this stage, but it tastes good and cleanses his palate.
Sherlock begins picking up speed, and any hit to his prostate is painful and explosive. John's groaning in time with Sherlock, and he starts to hear the whispered litany of his name above him.
John dumped the contents into the toilet, lit a match, and burned the plastic bag. Molly came in a little while later and complained about smelling something strange. John denied being able to smell it.
, it's that you're so damnably obvious about your disgust for me that even a nosy cunt like her can sort it out. Is that it?"
"Calm down Sherly," Jim said, eyes intent on his partner and his pet.
John keens as he spills over Sherlock’s hand. His body spasms several times, before he collapses back down onto his own arms.
John had expected for Sherlock to go for one of the pubs. Instead he was directed towards the only decent, and therefore ritzy, restaurant the town had to offer.
(See the end of the chapter for
His head was turned by Sherlock’s hand, and John was staring into a pair of sharp silver eyes instead of one steady black one.
John was stunned, but not surprised that Sherlock knew which shoulder had been shot. “I—yes. But he didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident Sherlock, it’s not a problem.”
Sherlock covers the prick with his hand, gently rubbing his thumb over the leaking head. John shouts, bucking for more or to get away from further stimulation. Sherlock continues to do it, watching the way John’s neck arches or how crumpled his face becomes.
The hands grasp him a little tighter when John starts stroking. Slowly, one of the hands unwraps from around his midsection, and travels. Across his chest, across his nipples, his stomach, his navel. To John, it doesn't even feel like a lustful caress. It feels exploring, trying to map out John's body in complete darkness. It feels like the most intimate thing John's ever done.
He's on his knees for most of the night.
John made a noise that the drugs prevented him from stopping. Moriarty cooed, “I do so love that broken look. It took quite a bit of self-restraint on my part, from doing anything untoward when you were having your little meltdown in the greenhouse.”
“…What more is there to discuss my lord? Do you need my help right now?” Sherlock could tell that the serf was trying hard not to appear insolent. John did want this job, and was grateful for the king’s generosity, but an eccentric lord showing up after sleeping hours was cause for mistrust in anyone with sense.
“So does that mean that you’re going to tell someone who did this? They’ll hardly be able to get away with it.”
It had taken a well-timed water manipulation spell, with John using himself as a moving target to tempt her into firing, before they’d finally been able to bring her down. Even with the electricity sparkling over her spasming body, she still hadn’t died. She was too powerful. But it was enough for John to restrain her until the authorities
There's nothing that I can't take from you, so why are you even fighting?
John opened his mouth to scold him, but Molly interrupted him, “It’s alright John. I’m actually looking to become a coroner.” She gave no indication of having been offended, but her hands wouldn’t stop passing over each other in nervous energy.
“You weren’t there,” Jim said with grave assurance, “he was holding the damned stuff in his hand. Like a child caught with a sweet. When I considered what he might’ve seen, that he was possibly making preparations to flee out of fear, I lost the grip on my control. He saw what was underneath this veneer for that brief instant. It might be temporarily put to rights for now, but the mere possibility of him leaving arose a monstrous need to
Sherlock blinks, looks at the creature’s face for a trace of mockery, but none is there. There is only open and pure wonder.
“For God’s sake, he’s a teenager!”
That night, as they laid next to each other, John couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities of what he and Sherlock would do next time they saw each other outside of school.
John felt his absence suck the life out of the room like a black hole. Frustrated, he kicked over a metal stool. As it clanked to the ground, his leg gave out. John gripped onto a table at the last second to keep himself from collapsing on the floor.
Try as John might, his eyes constantly closed but never found peace. He let out a frustrated sigh. When he opened them, Harry was holding his arm.
A short examination of the small space reveals a bundle of ratty blankets, cast offs that not even Sherlock's network would use. So it gets cold, or is only subject to extreme cold. Which would be easy enough to achieve this high up, his coat and hair have been flapping in the wind this whole time. Not to mention the icy breeze from the Thames would make this a freezing hell during the winter.
The man hadn't had a phone on him when he searched him, so he checks the glove compartment. Nothing. Not even under the seats. What kind of man in this day and age doesn't carry a bloody mobile? John checks himself, breathes. Nothing for it. He just has to keep walking. He's still dangerously close to the compound.
"You do realize that the cameras haven't been turned off right?" Sherlock makes a pointed look at one of them, the red light blinking at the pair. "The guards outside have a small handheld that has a live feed. If you attempt anything, they will restrain you without killing you, as per their instructions. And then you will wish you were dead when I'm done." Sherlock says all of this without breaking eye contact with John.
John wasn’t sure which was worse. To be misled and then literally stabbed in the back when he least suspected, or to be genuinely treasured by these men. ‘Better to join the worms than be trapped in Hell’, his sister’s words rang in his skull. All this time she’d been trying to warn him of a fate worse than death.
He leans forward, placing a hand by John's head. The man doesn't even notice the sudden closure of distance, he's still focused on the hand that holds the bottle. A wicked smile plays over Sherlock's mouth, and he brings it forward to his own lips. John watches desperate and painful envy in his rapt attention. Never taking his eyes off of John's, Sherlock takes a long drag from the bottle.
A smirk quirked over Sherlock’s full lips. He flared open his wings like a peacock displaying his feathers. It was then John realized Sherlock’s new form didn’t include clothes.
Sherlock extends and arm, and shuts off the cooling water. Tenderly, he rises John from his leaned position into the wall. He turns the man around, grabs a towel from nearby, and proceeds to dry him off. John relaxes into the warmth and comfort the action gives him.
Sherlock's eyes flicker with recognition. "Ah, Angelo. I was unaware that you were released from prison."
“Like I’ve been dragged back from the dead,” John lamented. He turned around to face his husband, who was watching him with concern and affection. “What happened?”
There was a ringing sound in John’s head. It was fairly similar to the aftershocks of a bomb that detonated a little too close for comfort.
He has fresh, purple bruises around his wrists and knees to go with the faded green on his arms. A tiny, delirious part of John almost thinks that they're beautiful. He tries not to be distracted by them every time he sees his hands.
Sherlock shoved away the newspapers onto the ground in disgust.
"I do hope I never see you again Mycroft. Take care, and I wouldn't eat the pasta if I were you. I think the waiter switched what plate I was supposed to eat." Sherlock said, his back to his brother. Mycroft let the fork full of carbohydrates go. The cold fury around him practically boiled, and he lamented the second biggest failure in his life. The first of course, had been allowing his little brother to ever discover Jim Moriarty in the first place.
Sherlock holds the glass out expectantly, and John slowly takes it from him. John briefly entertains the idea of refusing to drink it until Sherlock explains himself, but that impudence would only lead to more punishment. And John wants wherever this is leading to be finished as soon as possible.
Here, at the top of the curve of the hill, the horizon became nonexistent. The distance between sky and land appeared miniscule. Like sweets to a child, the stars beckoned just above John’s head. Without thinking, he reached out a hand to try and touch them. Even though he grasped at nothing, he felt like he could pocket a few of them and keep them on his nightstand to ward off the loneliness.
Sherlock only smiles, “A tad late for that, isn’t it?”
His grip tightens on the mobile, and the plastic creaks in protest. So what? Just call somebody. Call the police, tell them you've been kidnapped. Tell them what's happened. There must be something left behind. If nothing else, his story would match up with the break in at Angelo's, and they could move from there.
"Oh, yes. Another little enhancement. Contributed mostly from the ecstasy. This won't end until this lesson is very much carved into your brain. And even then we will still keep going." He pulls his feet off of John's body to rest them on the floor.
Sherlock think he might have to try and convince him to come down, but then the gargoyle is crawling quickly down the wall, wings tucked in to prevent any damage. Sherlock immediately realizes that he desperately wants to see this magnificent creature fly without being carried.
In the second it takes for the realization and the planning, Sherlock buzzes John's room several times in earnest. He waits exactly two seconds before buzzing again several more times. Hasty, impatient, and desperate, he needs to give off the idea of helplessness immediately. It's one and half seconds when John answers with a groggy "Hello? Who is-" Sherlock cuts him off "John! John I'm so sorry, I need your help!"
John grinned, pleased to see that he had caught Jim unawares. “I am eager to know how you knew there were two. But yes, that is entirely correct. Apparently two lowlifes were no match for one half-aristocrat who used to occupy his time in the less savory boxing rings.”
Sherlock shifted himself down until he could see his pale fingers moving in and out of John’s dripping hole. The sight caused his own cock to throb in need, but he ignored it. He carefully added a third finger, watching as the skin stretched around his crowded digits. Sherlock saw John’s muscles spasm with pleasure, and he suddenly felt overwhelmed with the need to make the boy
John watched as the green cells turned dusky with a distant horror. He was too paralyzed to do anything, and the ability to scream was quickly fleeing with each panicked pump of his heart.
John laughed some more, and eventually Sherlock joined in. “I swear, you could out preen a peacock,” John said when his giggles had died down.
John reaches the end of the street, and there, a blessed car is rolling down towards him. John waves his arms, hoping against hope that he doesn't look as crazy as he feels. The car slows down, pulling up close to the curb John is standing on. The window rolls down, and a concerned man's head pops out.
“Is that what this comes down to? A spiteful desire to keep me at your side, even when it hinders my future? Are you truly so selfish?”
As the door shut, Sherlock wondered if he would ever hear from him again. He pondered what would keep Mycroft away for good. Shame in what his shared blood had become, or shame in himself for failing to stop it?
"I've found someone Jim, I just thought you should know that I absolutely won't be bothered for work until I call you first." There's stunned silence at the end and Sherlock pulls away with a grimace when an ear-piercing shriek of delight is heard through the phone. "Sherly-pie! I'm so happy for you! Oh, when do I get to meet the pet?"
A strange and unbidden chill flashed down John’s spine at those words. Images of grinning teeth and tight grips flickered like candle shadows at the edges of his mind. John smiled, and hoped it wasn’t strained.
deny me yourself. If you want a trade for some temporary and monitored freedom, or for someone's continued pathetic existence, then you offer a piece of yourself. Something creative. Something I want. Any attempt at a counter offer is an extremely stupid mistake. I hope you will learn that within the next six hours."
“I-you didn’t have to tell me all of that,” John said hesitantly. Sherlock whirled around with anger burning in his eyes.
The grinding of car tires over gravel halted close to where John was stuck, and he heard officers shouting at each other to ‘cut them off’. Before John could alert them to his location, a hand reached for him.
. He doesn't realize he's kneeling on the ground until he looks back up at Sherlock when the man speaks.
Sherlock stopped staring at the wall to smile at John, while Mary’s body loosened in relief.
John was quite certain these were the real deal, not the knock-offs you bought for fun at a sex shop. John heaved out a frustrated sigh, and slammed his head back against the mattress. He then viciously berated himself for the resulting waves of nausea. The drugs weren't entirely out of his system then, fantastic. Guess he would just have to lay here and wait for the steady migraine to pass. Thank god he didn't need to use the loo just yet.
At least he didn’t have to worry about calling in for a second time. He was sure Molly wouldn’t mind, but his paycheck would. He was also certain his employers wouldn’t look sympathetically on it either, mentor to the town genius or no.
John couldn’t help but scoff at that, “Somehow I doubt that. But hell, even if you never do actually finish the job, you’ll still bring me close to dying.”
John heard sirens closing in. “That’s—that’s great then! You can go to the police with that and they’ll--”
John was quickly bored with his surroundings, and began doing crunches in determination. Sherlock watched him fight off his solitary anxiety with something akin to adoration. He had wondered if John would try and disobey him, but it appeared John at least understood he was being watched. An interesting theory formed, maybe it wasn't the cameras that put him off. Perhaps John's pride absolutely forbade him from touching himself to the thought of Sherlock binding him down and forcibly bringing him pleasure? That sounded like his doctor.
"And what did he say?" Jim ground out, quickly losing patience.
Sherlock grips the base of John’s cock, enough that John jolts in surprise, dragging his long fingers up and down the length. He forms a tight channel for John to fuck, and judging by the bubbling noises emerging from his throat, he’s very grateful about it.
He turns around, holding two mugs in his hand, and fully expects the room to be empty. Despite the fact that he would have heard him treading down the stairs no matter how quietly he moved over the floor. Instead, the gargoyle is still standing there, but his face is completely neutral.
Quickly, John strips himself of his shirt, and rips the fabric into strips. He should be doing this farther away from this hell hole, but he doesn't trust taking another step. Tetanus shots only go so far.
John choked off his words when Sherlock moved immediately for the crux of his neck and shoulder. Whether Sherlock had figured out that was one of John’s sensitive spots, or if it was just a lucky guess, John didn’t bother to wonder. He curled his hands into Sherlock’s curls for something to hold onto. Sherlock’s hair clung to John’s wet fingers like sentient calligraphy ink. Sherlock hummed with delight and nibbled, apparently not bothered when John tightened his grip.
“I knew you’d come,” Sherlock praised as he came closer. John didn’t walk any further, and waited for what would happen when Sherlock reached him.
"Since two very intelligent adults can vouch for your academic prowess, then it stands to reason that this exam was a very rare flop-up. I am being very generous Watson, please don't take it in vain."
“Handcuffs, really? I thought we both preferred the leather. These things are fucking painful, Sherlock!”
John winces. He deserved that, "Mr. Holmes, I-"
Lestrade explained all of this while Sherlock slammed the door to his room. He dressed hastily, hanging on to everything Lestrade was saying and filing away the important bits.
The sound above John was the driest example of derisive amusement he’d ever heard. “Or perhaps you’re hoping to observe my ‘abilities’ and find some fault in them, so you may conspire with John about it and bond at my expense.”
No doubt his multiple interactions with the army doctor have sent up red flags. In fact, between Pickner and now, Mycroft could've already "talked" to John. Warned him even. Told John all about him. His face pulls into a furious frown, but then into a vicious grin when a plan shoots through his mind. God, but he does love being brilliant. He needs to act fast, Mycroft's cronies are either phoning the police or his brother. Neither of which he wants to deal with.
“I know that,” John smiled to provide his own reassurance, “but you don’t have to do it alone anymore, remember?”
He shivered as he exited the cab, looking up at his driver. “Care to join me Mr. Hope? You’ll be sure to catch your death out here.”
John’s being shifted gently onto his back. He does cry out in protest at that, unable to help himself. His arm prickles with fire, with his back and shoulders strained into stiff cords of muscle. Glancing down, John can see the slowly blooming purple spots from the riding crop along his torso. Combined with Sherlock’s tight grip, bite marks, and whatever in God’s name has been done to his shoulder, he’s going to be quite the picture in a few hours.
John felt justifiable anger heat his face and blur his vision. He took a step forward, to accomplish what he wasn’t sure, but was halted when Lestrade held out an arm to stop him.
arrived.
"God, they really aren't paying me enough to deal with your smarmy arse, no matter how brief it will be." Pickner snarled, eyes darting behind him. The man really was an idiot, brandishing a gun at a high profile crime lord while having his back to the open. He was quickly realizing this, so Sherlock needed to distract. At least long enough for whatever mildly competent security tail Jim had sent yesterday.
“Oh, it was hardly difficult to create,” Jim tutted, “it makes this next bit easier and harder to recall, but it doesn’t invite reaction where none existed.” He flicked John’s nipple again, and the doctor’s hands spasmed on the sheets. “Turns out your precious husband isn’t as sweet and innocent as he lets on,” Jim smiled down at John, who was certain he’d never seen a more salacious expression.
Snow’s eyes widened. Once he composed himself, he motioned for Sherlock to continue. “I—get bored at school. I don’t have friends. The thought of being stuck at some boring temp job scares me to death. I thought—I wanted to find you, and ask you if I could be initiated.”
"You know, it's not as easy as you think to try and follow a black car at night across unreliable rooftops."
He reached out to check, and did not feel the thrum of magic that surrounded all fellow witches. That made things far less complicated. Perfect.
John floundered, “I don’t know, talk to him? Help him with moving? See if I could request my death to look like a heroic and painless one?”
Sherlock catches the movement and pure panic that he won't be able to find the creature this time makes him shout, "No! Wait!"
Sherlock? Why are you trying to break my doorbell?”
She turns to point behind herself, then follows her own finger with her gaze. She waves to nobody, then starts to walk in that direction. When she turns back around to wave goodbye, John can make out the tight concern in the corners of her eyes. John can't help his own dumbstruck wave. Her back faces him completely, and she gets lost in the swarm of bodies. John releases a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. Crisis averted then, Sherlock will never know.
His recovery to strength brought few nightmares apart from the occasional fitfulness. John began to wonder if his confrontation of his own stress had banished the visions entirely. As he thought about it, it even explained his earliest sightings of his deceased father, before maintaining the household with Harry became his priority. He’d thought they were real. Harry had even been accommodating and supportive, often inquiring about their frequency and severity.
John let out a slow breath, and lowered the gun back down. Then he picked up his phone and aimed it back at the children who were in way over their empty heads.
“I’m out of my wits,” John incredulously shouted, “are you trying to be humorous now? It’s you two,” he pointed to the both of them, “who are completely insane! Or do you somehow believe that poison and murder are normal behaviors?”
After that, his awareness rose and fell in that same disjointed continuity of all dreams. His body never seemed to move, but time had surely passed. He would notice Sherlock’s hand against his cheek, tilting John’s face up to stare directly into his unfocused eyes. He caught the clipped ending of an argument that had occurred in some unknown span of time.
One day, I will write something that is of a sane fucking length. *Day Two*
The man shakes his head and takes a bite, "Nah, mate, just lost souls."
If John couldn’t motivate him into a field of study, then at least a prosperous acting career wasn’t an impossibility.
“So you just knocked on a random stranger’s door for sugar? Rather than walk and purchase your own?”
John didn't even try to make it quiet anymore. What was the point if what it was saying was true?
He needed to retreat and recuperate. If he did see the logical explanation with his own eyes, he’d either collapse from shame or scream his frustration to the heavens. John required time to gather his wits before they scattered like dandelion seeds beset by the wind.
John looked torn for a second, but he was too polite to turn something from uncomfortable to embarrassing. And he was far too trusting to question Sherlock’s words. “Poor girl. That’s awful.”
“How?” John repeated, “A lot of good you’ve done, telling me cryptic messages. I don’t know where to start Harry, and they took away the one thing I had to cling to. It’s all well and good to tell me to act but not offer a lead. I thought you were meant to try and protect me?”
Jim giggled into the crease of his thigh. “Oh, you are. Just not in the way you’re used to, or rather, in the manner you have so heartlessly accused us of. We
Sherlock leans down, eyes shuttering closed, reciprocating the unexpected kiss. One hand supports his weight, the other moves and caresses John's hair. His mind is on sensory overload. John's tacky scalp give him a bath later, his sweaty skin, the press of John's firm lips against his more supple ones. Sherlock darts out his tongue, tastes salt, and then John gloriously parts his lips.
When time passes again, John's squirming on his back. He has to use the bathroom again, though for an entirely different reason. He's been banging continuously on the door, though he doubts Sherlock either hears him or cares. God, he really doesn't want to do this here. Urinating is bad enough, but,
He nearly comes to a dead stop in the middle of his stride. Is that….music? Faint strings and gentle flutes wind their way through John’s ears. He can at least tell it’s not a live band, but he has no idea what piece this is. Gone is the ever present scent of bleach. In its place are the lingering remnants of sharp smoke from a lit match, as well as the barest traces of something edible.
Sherlock slowly licked up and down John’s shaft. It swelled underneath Sherlock’s tongue, twitching when Sherlock gripped the base to lick the underside. As he continued to tease, John’s moans grew from pleasured to desperate.
"-and who in the Moon's name decides to try and stop a thing that can fly by almost
Panic wells up sharp and acrid in his throat, and he does his best to swallow it back down in a hot lump.
Sherlock moves, and sheer panic and fear fill John up like a balloon. In hindsight, the man was probably just shifting to get more comfortable. Or getting up to take a piss.
John didn’t hear any apologies, but he assumed by Jim’s silence or some gesture he acquiesced. Then his hips were being pulled backwards by long pale fingers. Unable to move his body, his rump was left exposed to the air while the rest of him was as lax as a doll. He couldn’t even rub his face into the sheets to scrub away his shame.
“Did you read this? He remarks that as a child I was ‘reserved but polite’. Polite! I once made a woman cry into her cocktail when I was eight!”
He cupped the back of John’s head and looked at him with such devotion that John couldn’t decide to be heartbroken or disgusted. Sherlock’s hands reached behind John’s head. Before he could understand what was going on, there was the soft sound of his claws having ripped through skin. Sherlock winced in pain, and then brought his bleeding wrist to John’s mouth.
"Of course not John," Sherlock grins at him, "that would spoil the surprise."
“Sherlock,” John asked seriously when the boy slumped into a chair, “are you being bullied again?”
The sheets catch against the sweat of John’s body, just as cloying as the lover on top of him. It drags along his cock, giving delicious sparks of friction that do enough to tease him without sending him over the edge. The driving of Sherlock’s cock into his body is just as fleeting.
“You can join in you know,” Jim lewdly suggested, “as a gesture of good faith. I daresay he’s wishing for your participation.”
Mycroft was back to looking at him like he was a cockroach that had somehow learned human speech. “Oh, am I?”
Now that his old instructor has retired, John can't help but stay awake and alert. If only to hear that deep voice in its entirety. Or watch him stalk around the room like a predatory cat. Or to meet those piercing eyes in a passing glimpse before they're focused on something else. Or to watch those long, long fingers trace delicately over a glass flask and imagine them--the bell makes him jump in his seat.
Sherlock was silent. It was impossible to discern if it was from shock or understanding. “You do not enjoy it when he’s afraid of you, I perceive?”
At the final digit, the lock clacked open. John waited, the door loose in his hand, for Jim to spring up in alarm from his bed. The man snuffled in his sleep, turned over, and was still again.
"That's it, your brain's gonna paint that wall before-" he's cut short from a punch to his kidney, and he gives a howl when John wrenches the gun away by getting him in an arm lock and snapping the bone at the elbow.
, even through the thick walls, the bellow could be heard through several areas of the compound. It could even be distantly distinguished in the lower levels from where the sound originated. The intention of murder and pain could only be fully appreciated in the highest floor of the compound, where said Jim was filing some paperwork.
John’s thoughts struggled for purchase. He’d already considered it beyond possible to have met and befriended a dragon, yet here he was being wooed by one. Finally, John admitted, “I don’t know how to respond to that.”
Striding past the crowded booths, Sherlock bumped into someone. A snarling curse was ready to pass his lips, but he stopped short. He can't believe he missed this man when scanning the place, but he can see why he did. The man at first glance is entirely unremarkable, but the eyes are what catch his interest in the way nothing has for a very long time. The man is short, stocky and has golden brown hair. Almost immediately dismissible, except for the eyes, which are an honest but sad blue. "Sorry mate." The man muttered before ducking his head again and striding past him.
The hand holding his hip moves down, to softly cup his balls. John moans, rolls his head back into Sherlock's shoulder. The man stiffens, then begins shifting back and forth across John's wet backside. Sherlock releases his own moan, gripping John's cock more firmly now.
Even while his body was so thoroughly abused, and his mind whirled in confusion and terror, his cock remained turgid along his belly. His brain slid over earlier words of a suspicious tea, but he couldn’t deny that the sweet slide in his insides and the salty taste of Sherlock’s member in his mouth did much to arouse him beyond compare. While this all seemed so real, and more frightening because of that, his flesh was not susceptible to such uncertainties. It was quite content to enjoy its carnality when it could, even within a feverish nightmare.
“I’m not trying to parent you, Sherlock, I’m trying to look out for you,” John said in frustration. “You clearly haven’t been sleeping, I doubt that what you’ve eaten, if anything, has been good for you, and you refuse to tell me the cause of it. You’re running yourself ragged, and you won’t even tell me why. You won’t even give me a chance to help you.”
John comes in short spurts across his abdomen, and he sinks into the mattress. Sherlock braces himself on John's shoulders, and thrusts onto John's wet belly. The man whines from his oversensitive penis being abraded, but Sherlock pays no heed. He grinds once, twice, and John's semen is joined by his own.
John felt the floor dip down. He kept himself steady, but his voice wavered when he asked, “You mean, he actually--”
John ended up in his favorite armchair, holding a mug of tea that he didn’t remember making.
“Believe me, it would take an unearthly force to make me forget this time,” Sherlock promised against John’s lips. His slicked fingers fell between their bodies, and John felt the slow intrusion sweetly open him. He gasped against Sherlock’s mouth. He wished he could feel irritation at the smug hum his husband made, but he was too consumed with sensation to care.
But then Mycroft truly considered the question. And his face softened into something far more disgusting. Pity.
Nothing snaps under him, which is a definite good sign. The street before him is empty of wanderers. Streetlight keeps everything well lit, and a few of the shops look like they cater exclusively to the night owl crowd. While John knows he's not in the heart of London, he must be pretty damned close.
This relies on the hope that Sherlock will even care enough to turn him over. John ignores that train of thought as much as he can. He hasn’t survived this long on ominous speculation. No use worrying about what might come if he can’t truly predict what Sherlock will do next.
enough, then you are far more stupid than I could have imagined.”
He entwined their fingers together and leaned forward to purr, “And you
He doesn't feel good about lying, but he feels somewhat guilty that he's getting this special pass in the first place. He knows that a lot of students would love to retake the thing, and John doesn't feel right that he gets to be the only one. He also doesn't want to come across as a suck-up. Plus, if his friends found out, he'd never hear the end of it.
The creaking groans of the house and the tempestuous weather had lent itself to some truly imaginative amounts of noises over the years. John had grown inured to all of them. This was something different.
John choked on his own scream. He tightly squeezed Sherlock’s neck with his arms, helplessly riding the sensations. Each thrust hit unerringly against the entrance to his vaginal passage, making him slicker and itching for just the right angle.
