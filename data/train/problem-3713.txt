“Novak seems to be enjoying himself,” Jo said appearing at Dean’s side and pressing a drink into his hand.
"It's not that easy!" Castiel said pushing Dean away from him and rising from where he was sat on his bed while Dean quickly whirled up from his kneeled position.
“I like to think so,” Cas said with a smile.
“I’m sorry.”
“At least we can dance without popping a bottle of pills.” Rachel said before Hester could get in there.
"No, where did you hear
“No Dean, not right now.” Cas sighed finally looking up from his laptop screen, his blue eyes looking tired and drained. Dean knew he’d put Cas through hell over the past few days but he was trying to make amends now and he needed his boyfriend to listen to him. “I’m sorry but I just can’t right now,” Cas added.
"Shit, Sam's plane is getting in soon." Dean said when Cas gave Dean’s phone a confused look.
“Your brother? I didn’t even know you had a brother.” Inais said sitting up in his bed. “Are you ok? You look like you’re about to be sick.” He asked with concern. Samandriel shrugged as he picked up his laptop, laptop charger, phone and phone charger before putting them into the bag along with his clothing.
“I’m sorry...I’m sorry this happened this way.” Cas said after a few minutes of silence.
"Um yeah...I can tell." Dean said nodding at the running shoes, shorts and large hoodie Castiel was wearing. "So do you always run in the rain?" Dean asked cocking his eyebrow.
“No I mean it, I’m not having a bullshit fight with you over this shit right now,” Dean said making his way back toward the front door.
Looking back at the envelope he instantly recognised the handwriting of the neatly written address. Someone, who went by the name of Anna Milton, had a lot of explaining to do.
“I’ve honestly zoned out whenever she starts talking about it. It’s the safest thing to do. “ Michael explained as he launched into several stories about Naomi near neurotic planning that had Dean nearly doubled over with laughter. It wasn’t until they’d been talking for nearly an hour that Michael changed the subject to the one thing Dean was convinced they would end up talking about. “So how is Castiel? I watched his TED conference talk and it was fascinating. Half the nurses back in London are in completely love with him, despite the fact I mentioned he was taken.”
He didn’t want to think anymore, he just wanted to do what he had wanted to do since getting to know Cas.
“Do you want any help with that?” Castiel offered. Mary shook her head and chuckled quietly.
run away from things and you always have. Why do you think I took it on myself to send off your MCAD application?” Anna said.
“We’re two minutes out Mr Novak-Reeves.”
“I did what I needed to do. I couldn’t leave you and Sammy.” Dean reasoned hoping that his father would accept this but he greatly doubted it. When John’s mind was made on something very little could change it.
“I don’t have doubts Cas. I promise that I don’t have doubts about us. I just worked hard to get where I am, and so did you, so I don’t want people to think that this thing between us is so I can get surgeries.”
"Well what I wanted was for my family not become a broken mess but I guess that things don't always go according to the plan." Samandriel shot back leaving the room before Castiel could say another word.
Without saying another word he took off in the general direction of his bathroom for a shower. He was glad Sam was here, heck he hadn’t seen the giant doofus in months and they needed a proper catch-up, but he really needed space right now to think things through and Sam had a tendency to not let things go even when he knew they were pissing Dean off.
“No I’m not.” Castiel scratched at his neck as he felt heat rushed through his skin. “I’m not in any kind of trouble so you don’t have to worry about that.”
"Full time?"
“This isn’t about salmon though I do have to sort that out. I just wanted to know if you were bringing a date to the wedding.” Anna said.
"Stop flirting and get in the car. I've got a job to do here."
"Yeah...I got to hold the heart." Dean said still smiling from ear to ear at the memory. “The old heart, not the transplanted heart, but it was still amazing.”
“It’s not yours either!”
“You missed his one-man performance of Cabaret. Complete with top hat” Amy said before giving Cas a good morning kiss on the head. “Don’t worry, I recorded it,” Amy said when she saw Cas’ mock distraught face.
"Yeah, the asshole thing…that probably wasn't either of our finest moments. That day was pretty stressful though...no what I wanted to say was that...that day wasn't a mistake at all for me...I mean I've been wanting to do that for too long...kiss you that is, not call you an asshole. Though thinking about it you deserve to be called an asshole sometimes Cas."
"I saw her heading off to breakfast with Ruby," Meg replied. "You don't need to worry about her so much, she'll be fine," She added sounding surprisingly soft for once.
"Of course, it has nothing to do with the fact that this is where the mini apple pies are being kept at all," Cas said motioning over the table covered in party food the waiters were meant to be bringing out any minute. Dean snorted but Cas did have a point, he'd already sneakily eaten four mini pies. "I know you too well Dean," Cas said with a small laugh.
No, just no. He couldn’t fucking think about this. He had spent so long drowning himself in alcohol trying to forget that day but now everything had come rushing back. All it had taken was for Cas to reappear and now Dean couldn't think about anything else but that day.
Trips to the bar became a part of Dean’s routine after that first week. Occasionally Dean and Jo were joined by Charlie and Sarah and even more frequently by Adam. It had taken a while for Dean to make friends when he was at KU and Yale but here in Chicago, he felt like he needed friends more than he had needed them before. Maybe it was because he was far from home or maybe it was because he felt like a different person now but having Jo and the others around him made him feel less out of his depth. Nights spent in the bar, laughing and joking along with Jo over her spot-on impression of Castiel Novak, debating which
“Someone’s touchy, Novak really pissed you off today didn’t he?”
“Me? Why’d you want to know about me?”
? When...
“If only you weren’t middle age,” Krissy said almost wistfully.
“I hate fucking legacy ballet boys and their nepotism," Meg groaned. Dean shot her a questioning look and her response was pointing over to Cas.
“Danyael.” He whispered as the name came flooding back to him. It had been there like fog in his brain for days but now it crashed against his skull like a fierce wave. Zachariah had called Dean by that name, Castiel was only remembering that now, so the name had to mean something.
“You’re not using muffins the same way that Inias uses coffee syrup are you?” Castiel asked furrowing his brow. Jo pulled herself up to her full height, which still wasn’t that tall, and folded her arms across her chest. It was actually terrifying how much she looked like Ellen when she glared.
“The last I heard Lafitte had a trauma thing he got pulled into. He'll probably be down in the pit if you want to go grab him.” Dean called as he turned in the direction of the on call room.
“Bela Talbot," Dean said, giving Bela a look that Cas had found impossible to decipher.
“At least they’re going to see me on stage. Have fun watching the show from the wings," Hester snapped back glaring over at Meg. There was no lie that Hester and Meg had never liked each other. It had only gotten worse over the years.
"Yeah, that's going to be a snooze fest so we normally do a cut-and-run, then do something fun in the city. Plus Sunday is the day of rest," Meg said. “Only fucking losers stay for the whole gala,"
“No but I’ll try.” Castiel said shrugging his shoulders. Anna muttered something under her breath and, with a shake of her head, climbed out the car. “Come on, you know you love me really Milton.”
“Dean we need to go. They’re going to notice I’ve gone any minute.” Cas said from where he was standing next to the Impala. His bright blue eyes were full of fear.
“I know a thing or two about complicated.” Castiel said gently. Dean stilled for a moment before talking.
“I don’t remember learning half the stuff that was written down on that damn test,” Sam grumbled before downing nearly half his coffee in one go. Thank God for Coffee Mate. “Luckily I read ahead because there were questions from chapter thirteen when we’ve only studied up to chapter ten in class.”
"Dr C Novak." Dean said remembering the name that had been written on the letter the hospital had sent him the week previous.
"Since when are you in a good mood?" Castiel asked. True Gabriel was the jokey sibling but he also had a temper that could rival Michael and Luke's, recently that temper had been shown more often thanks to the rising animosity between Luke, Michael and their father. “Did they finally discover a make of candy that doesn’t cause diabetes?”
“I don’t know Cas, it depends on when you’re being an ass.” Dean said smirking. Castiel rolled his eyes causing Dean to smirk even more so. "The party at Meg Masters' house when you were spectacularly drunk and commented on how I could probably bench press you...the night you helped me with my portfolio...the day I saw you run for the first time; I don't know really, take your pick." Dean said. "That day though, after you punched Alistair in the face, I was so freaking angry-"
“Shall we take this inside?” Cas asked, an eyebrow cocked. Dean nodded and followed Cas back into the sumptuous suite.
“More ready than you were. I, for one, am sober.” Jimmy said sounding incredibly smug. “Plus I’m not getting married by a fat Elvis.” He added.
, we’re going up there after our last classes. You should join us if you want to,"
Ok, no smiling. Dean wadded up the bloodied tissues and disposed of them quickly. Sucking in a shaky breath before heading out back into the restaurant.
“I want to believe you.” Dean said warily. He wasn’t sure though, Cas could just run out on him again.
“Yes, the aneurysm is of a large size and we want to remove it before it bursts.”
“Are you ok? Did I say something wrong?” Cas asked. Dean shook his head. “You’re not ok or I didn’t say something wrong?”
"Aw dang it." Claire and Jack said in unison.
"I just felt like I needed to do that before you left again."
“So, are you ok?” Dean pressed.
"Wait,
"There's more?" Dean asked. Cas nodded. "Great, this is where you tell me you cheated or some shit."
. Once Dean had pulled out and thrown the condom in what he hoped was the general direction of the bin he pulled Cas down to lie next to him on the rapidly cooling, albeit uncomfortable, sheets. Dean lay contentedly stroking Cas’ arm for several minutes before Cas turned to him with a tender look
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean rolled his eyes and gave Cas an apologetic grin. They hadn’t seen each other since the day before, Dean really hadn’t been joking when it came to running out of clean shirts to wear to work. Then again he wouldn’t have run out if Cas didn’t keep stealing them on the grounds that they were comfy and ‘smelt like Dean’. Once Jo and Sarah were out of hearing range, getting Jo more coffee most likely, Dean moved closer towards Cas.
"I...you haven't heard?" She asked. Dean groaned. That phrase was never a good sign. "Our assistant DP just got a job with Nat Geo, Ryan is going to be the new assistant DP. That's why Crowley brought him back." Charlie said.
“Wait…you’re not gonna get into trouble for this, are you? It’s not against the rules to date residents, the hospital just gets pissy over it.” Jo said looking worried as hell which was pretty dumb as she wasn’t the one freaking out over potentially losing their job. “I know I shouldn’t have said anything but it was an accident. I swear I didn’t tell anyone who would tell the chief though!” Jo added quickly.
“Sexy,” Dean said with a snort. He glanced down just in time to see Cas rolling his eyes. “So, wanna grab some coffee?"
that as well.
"He could probably do it," Cas said nonchalantly.
“Because I don’t really talk about this sort of stuff with anyone,” Dean admitted as he felt a slow creep of heat crawling up his neck. “I don’t really let people in that often but…but I did with you and I promise you that I won’t run again. I’m done with acting like a scared idiot because I nearly lost you and that’s the last thing I ever want.”
“I ain't gonna lie to you kid. There are risks with every single operation, Krissy. There will always be risks but Dr Novak is damn good at what he does and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that your surgery goes without a single hitch. I promise you.” Dean said.
"Yeah, are you insane? Do you know how hard it is to
Both Dean and Cas were beginning to drift off when Cas’ phone bleeped with his email notification. Normally Cas would just leave it but he was still waiting to hear back with the results of his boards. While Dean curled up under the covers Cas slid out the bed and went to retrieve his phone from the other room. Dean listened out but Cas remained silent as he padded back into the bedroom. Dean sat up and his brow furrowed as he watched Cas’ face for a sign of either relief or disappointment.
“Those fuckers have it out for me,” Dean said defensively.
“Dammit Cas, this has nothing to do with you being a guy at all, it never has and it never will.”
"What's up, Charlie?" He asked.
“In my defence…it is
"What was that for?" Cas asked.
“Yes.”
“I do but it doesn’t mean that I like it. I’m not one for hiding away my feelings or relationships Dean, if I can walk down a street or a hallway holding hands with the person I love then I damn well will do that but if you don’t want that because you’re scared then what I am really supposed to do? How am I supposed to react?” Cas asked, his own voice growing louder until he was shouting just like Dean.
“It’s
“Thanks, mom, I love you.”
“’We’ as in, Miss Masters from this morning right?” Dean asked.
"Mary, stop crushing the poor boy, he can't operate with a collapsed lung," John said from where he was stood next to Mary. Mary let go for Dean, somewhat reluctantly, as Dean looked over towards his father. "It’s good to see you, son," John said pulling Dean into another hug which was thankfully less bone-crushing than Mary's.
“Hey, what are you doing here?” Dean asked.
"Dude, it's three in the morning, why are you sneaking out of my brother's bedroom looking really shifty?" Charlie asked raising an eyebrow.
“Congratulations on the role, Balthazar said that you were fantastic in your auditions,” Richard said.
“No I just think you haven’t been living it.” Dean said bluntly. “Sorry but it’s true. I think you could be so much more than this.”
"I was right when I said you and I were going to have fun this year," Cas whispered into Dean's ear.
Cas had to admire Dean’s bluntness. He was used to catty people more than he was used to blunt people.
“Ow, you’re such a jerk. I’m going to stay in California the next time I have some time.” Sam whined.
“Is everything alright Dean?” he asked. Dean shrugged his shoulders absentmindedly. “What’s the matter?”
"Maybe you should go back and see Pamela because you really need a therapist."
"Yes so shut the fuck up and stop being so damn sarcastic for once." Dean snapped. “Why can’t you just tell me what is going on and why you’re acting like this?” Dean asked as the anger from his voice ebbed away.
“Thank you,” Cas said, making sure he didn’t falter even a fraction of an inch. As Balthazar walked away Jo snorted.
“It’ll be great Dean, stop freaking out.” She said.
"So if it were Meg or Jo or even Charlie who kissed you then you would kiss them back?" he asked.
"It's just... never thought we would be here again, y'know?" Dean admitted. "It feels weird."
“No. No, there won’t be a problem. I guess I don’t really know him…we met once that’s all.” Dean said hastily trying to desperately ignore the sinking feeling he could feel in his stomach.
"Please, there's only one place you're ending up tonight." Cas said to Dean.
“Fuck no, these are great,” Dean said handing on muffin over to Cas and swiftly digging into the breakfast muffin.
“Dean…” Cas whispered. Both of them moments away from drifting off to sleep. “I...I love you.” he said. Dean was silent for a beat before Cas felt him wrap his arms around Cas’ waist.
“It is.” He pressed when no one looked, apart from Castiel, looked convinced.
“Yeah…sorry about yelling at you like that. I mean I know it was like a month ago and I was really pissed but yelling at you in the OR wasn’t the best thing to do.” Dean said. “But you could have picked a better nickname, Budweiser is the shittiest of beers.”
“Hey Dean.” Sam said. “How’s the party? I know Anna’s pissed I couldn’t be there but I’m gonna get there for the wedding, don’t worry.”
“We can’t risk that Sam. Adam is right. This is Jo; of course I'm going to find her!” Dean snapped. “I don't give a shit if God himself is there and wants to smite me; I'm not going to lose Jo…I’m not going to lose her
"But... but you were all distant after." Cas pointed out.
“If it’s alright I want to make sure she’s ok.” He said hoping that Cas would be more ‘Cas’ and less ‘Scary Resident Castiel’.
Dorogoy - Sweetheart
Cas leapt out of bed and grabbed the nearest shirt. The shirt could have been Dean’s, he really wasn’t sure and shoved his feet into his shoes. Dean wasn’t far behind. The pair of them sprinted to the elevator and down to the girls’ floor. When they got down there the floor was packed with students and RA’s.
“Please, you would have preferred a family meal followed by a movie washed down with cheap beer.” Castiel said and his tone was harsher than he intended it to be. Jimmy’s eyebrows shot up in surprise and Castiel instantly felt guilty. “Sorry…I just have things on my mind.” Wasn’t that the truth?
“Well, I figure you’ll have Dean there to keep an eye on you, you would just whinge if I preferred you to go to UDub.” Chuck said. Cas let out a laugh as he pulled his father into a hug.
“It’s not fucking funny Winchester, I hate these damn galas,” Jo said bitterly while Bela checked her make up in a small compact mirror.
“Man, I thought our kitchen was clean…” Dean said with a low whistle as he look around the kitchen.
“Shit…Cas…
"Best pie in the city." The smile he gave Dean should have been made illegal.
“And I thought Sammy and I were bad,” Dean said between snorts of laughter. Cas laughed along with him as they walked back into the living room.
“Bring on the bad news Dr Model, I can take it like a pro,” Krissy said. Dean rolled his eyes and Krissy snorted despite her pain. “Ok, what’s the good news?”
"Yeah, I do know that, me and Cas have had this conversation a few times. We're not letting it affect us at the moment."
"Please, give me some fucking credit Dean Winchester. Like I could have fucked an ass better than yours." Cas said. There it was, the famous dirty Cas mouth. "No, I think I left because I was scared. I heard what you said to your father then I thought about it, I realised that the last crazy thing I had done had been marrying you in Vegas. That had been two years before. Two years. It shook me up. I panicked."
"So, Jack and I will be seeing you at Thanksgiving." Cas said to Claire. Claire nodded but Dean could see the tears in her eyes.
"She means that as a compliment." He said. Cas gave him a weak smile and went back to watching the show. By the time the first commercial break started Cas was back to looking like a nervous wreck.
“Your brother is so in love with Jess.” She said grabbing a glass of champagne from the nearest waiter. “I’ve even moved seats around so they’re sitting next to each other for the rest of the evening. I’m so good at this.” She added, looking even more smug than before.
“Yeah we’ve heard that a fair few times. Where will you go after you've found Castiel’s brother?”
“Aren’t you tired after the flight?” Cas asked.
Photos of both Mary and Dean dancing adorned the walls, dappled in the early morning sunlight that began to filter through the windows.
"And?" Meg asked while expertly applying a thick layer of eyeliner.
“You’re not gonna run are you? You’re not gonna end up running off somewhere while I’m in Wisconsin…”
"A cake? For what?"
“Adam is so jealous of us.” She finally said after two minutes.
"How's that working out for you?" He asked between snorts.
“I don’t really have much time to read, I’m always working at the hospital and when I was at Yale I was always studying,” Dean said. “I keep seeing patients or their family members reading those bestsellers that get turned into TV shows but I never get round to reading them myself.”
“I doubt it," Cas replied, taking some pleasure in the way Rachel’s face fell before she and Hael turned away and marched down the hall.
“And you’ve done it ever since?”
The three of them were pretty quiet in the car and Dean could tell that Sam wanted to ask him about a million questions. That was mainly because Sam was shooting him about fifty bitchy looks from the back seat.
“Cas, most environmentalists would just recycle or chain themselves to a tree.” Dean pointed out. Cas turned around to face Dean, a huge smirk on his handsome face.
“Sarah will be happy though, she really likes neuro," Dean added with a casual shrug.
“It’s going to be ok Gabe.” Castiel said as Gabriel’s eyes flitted around desperately. “Gabe…Gabe
“I’m not…Jimmy, nothing is going on.” Castiel said. He hated lying to Jimmy, hated it with a passion, but he just couldn’t tell his brother the truth…the truth didn’t even make
"Yeah, it's just us." Ben said with a shrug. “Well there’s my nana as well but we don’t see her that much because she lives so far away.” Ben added sadly. Dean tried to keep the kid talking for a long as possible as he sutured the cut. It turned out that Ben was in Little League and had hit more home runs than any other kid on the team. Once Ben found out that Dean played baseball in high school there was no stopping the questions the kid asked. It wasn’t until Jo hurried over that Dean even realised that he’d been sat with Ben for nearly an hour.
“Dean, are you trying to propose right now in the middle of an airport?” Cas asked.
"Apparently so."
“Castiel I don’t want your money.” Daphne said quickly.
"Great, just enough time to get a cleaner in here. Seriously Dean, it smells like sex, chicken and my expensive alcohol in here." Josie said, her nose wrinkling. "Good luck with this one Collins, don't fuck him too hard because there's a good chance his heart will crap out by the time he's thirty-five. Would it kill you to eat a salad?"
“No Dean.” Anna said holding him away from her so he could look at her. “I hate him. I
“Oh yeah, she banged one of the cameramen and then got thrown out. It was all over the internet.” Ruby said, sounding far too amused by the whole thing. Dean sighed and tried to ignore the conversation. “That’s true, right Dean?” Ruby pressed. Of course, it had been all over the goddamn internet. For a moment Dean mentally cursed the fanbase of the show and Twitter. Fuck Twitter.
"Like I could be annoyed by you turning up." Dean snorted. “I’ve missed you since I moved here.”
“Hey come here, it’s gonna be ok.” Dean said walking over to Bela and hugging her tightly. When they were back at Yale the notion of hugging Bela would have made Dean laugh until his sides split but he knew when someone needed comfort.
“We’ve been there
“Harvelle what’s up?” Dean asked as soon as he picked up the phone. He hadn’t spoken to Jo in months but it would actually be good to hear her voice.
“And this was a necessary time for you?”
“Dean, they drive off a cliff at the end of that movie.” Cas said with a frown. Dean couldn’t help but laugh at his serious expression. “I know that's not how you wanted to tell Sam and that’s certainly not how you wanted that interaction to go.”
“You’re really thinking about the show right now?” Charlie asked.
..." he tried to explain but he knew he was doing a piss poor job of it. It wasn’t really possible for him to explain exactly why he couldn’t be with Dean and part of him wondered if his reasons were actually genuine. What if it was all in his head and he’d managed to convince himself that he wasn’t worthy of having someone want him? That thought scared him more than the fact that he was actively pushing Dean away more than he ever had before.
“Probably not, but they can’t really say anything if they do seeing as it’s my apartment,” Dean said jokingly but he could see the worry in Cas’ eyes. “Cas we’re friends, I want you there and it would be cool for you to meet Sam,” Dean said firmly.
“Yeah, she’s my baby.” Dean said sounding like an incredibly proud parent instead of a teenager boy talking about his car.
“Huh?”
Dean’s face had clouded over as Castiel listened to the lake lapping against the shore. There was sadness in the man’s eyes that tugged at Castiel’s heart. Dean had lost his father and so he carried the same burden that Castiel did.
“I just...I guess that what Charlie said just stuck with me. Movie night was great and a good distraction but...I feel like a fraud.”
dwinchester@hotmail.com
He really hoped that they could work something out. That would be hard though. Cas had spent that last two years wandering the globe, hopping from country to country. He hadn’t even been back in the States before the week of the wedding, as far as Dean knew anyway. How could they even try and sort out their fractured relationship if Cas wasn’t even near Kansas? Dean’s whole life was there. He would be starting work with Jimmy once the summer was over and he had firmly planted roots in Kansas. He couldn’t up sticks and follow Cas around the globe.
“It was near the end of summer, I wanted things to continue because, bad handjob aside, it was nice having someone care for me. Dad was so wrapped up with Mom leaving and you were gearing up to become Little Miss Popular. I was lonely and Michael helped in making me feel better. He didn’t want that though. He didn’t want anyone knowing that he liked all the fruit in God’s great garden and broke up with me. He said if I told anyone he’d ‘beat the living hell’ out of me. What was I going to say? Michael Donner sucks at handjobs and likes nipple play?”
“I don’t remember Harry Potter being a classmate.” Cas said.
“Gabriel once turned up in short shorts and a shirt that said ‘As Seen In Porn’. It was quite the conversation piece at dinner” Cas said. Dean’s eyebrows shot up and he tried to hide a snorting laugh.
“You know most teenagers would want to go to Tijuana.” Gabriel said.
Back in medical school one of Dean’s teachers had told them how surgery was like a battlefield. It had nothing to do with the pain, or the trauma or the blood. She had said that surgery was like a battlefield because of quickly things changed. One moment you are standing the middle of silent calm, a swell in your chest from knowing how you had conquered that which tried to destroy you; then, like the changing of a rapid tide, a gunshot would ring out across the expanse, pain ripping through your chest and blood spreading across your chest like ink running across a blank page.
"I guess I did the same thing. I lost myself in work and booze."
"Bela?" Dean asked walking into the room. Bela looked away from her father's bed to where Dean was stood. Surprise flashed across her face we she saw who was standing there.
“Yes, but this is more interesting than chaining myself to a tree.” Cas said, he even glanced down to take in Dean’s body.
"Is he...does he do what you and your father do?" Castiel asked.
“Cas” Dean let out with a heady and breathy voice.
“Cas?” Dean called out as he unhurriedly walked into the studio. He stopped in surprise when he saw a huge stretched canvas, at least six feet high, propped up against the farthermost wall. A riot of colour spread across the canvas, giving of a sense of rage that Dean could practically taste in the air. Dean was so focused on the sight of the canvas that he nearly missed Castiel sat on the only piece of furniture in the room, a long couch, with his head in his hands. His chest was rising and falling rapidly as if he’d been crying. “Cas?” Dean asked though this more apprehensively.
“I’ll be in the gallery watching and waiting for you when you get out,” Dean said. He had to stop himself from just kissing Cas when he gave Dean a grateful smile that would make even the coldest of people’s heart swell.
“I know but she’s my roommate, I should have said something or at least noticed more. The signs were all there.”
“Zachariah was an angel. He fell though during The Great Fall and ended up in Hell as chief torturer and asshole.” Dean said. “He still retains some of his angelic grace but it's been twisted by demon powers over the centuries. He's not an angel but he's not a demon either.” Dean said shuddering at the thought of Zachariah’s twisted grace. “You can say it if you want.” He added noting Castiel’s horrified look.
"Cas, we gotta get up. We need to leave for New York soon. You gotta go back to your room."
“If we’re out of here before midnight shall we go for a drink? I haven’t seen anywhere that wasn’t this hospital or my apartment for the better part of a week.” Cas said giving Dean a knowing look.
Dean turned to stare at Castiel, his green eyes full of horror. “Cas, I-”
Dean was waiting for them once they drove into the student parking lot. Anna parked next to the Impala and Dean gave Castiel a huge smile as they got out the car.
“Yeah well, my back isn’t gonna mourn the loss of this couch.” Dean muttered darkly.
“Dammit Cas, will you please just listen to me?” Dean asked, his lack of sleep finally getting to him and making him suddenly furious.
"And live my life like it was a lie?" Cas asked with a frown. "I would have thought that you, of all people, would get why that is a stupid idea." Damn, he had a point. Dean had been out and fucking
“That girl, I swear. Send to camp for the summer Dean, she won’t get into trouble in Maine Dean. Last time I listen to Sam. Ok kid, where’s Claire? Is this gonna be a job for her dad, the sheriff or the FBI?” Dean asked and for what felt like the millionth time he wished that parenting, especially parenting Claire, was easy.
The flight back to New York was uneventful. Dean held onto Cas’ hand throughout the whole flight with a terrified look on his face. Cas tried to keep him distracted by asking him about cars, something of which Cas knew nothing about but it surprisingly worked. Dean spent a long time talking about the Impala, a classic car his dad had once owned before giving it to Dean. Talking about cars seemed to calm Dean down.
“No, he seemed surprised that I was studying this early. You might see the award winning trauma surgeon when you look at him but I see the guy who tried to talk me out of going to medical school countless times. I love him but he’s never really been the most supportive of fathers.” Dean said with a sigh as he moved towards his bed, pulling Cas along with him as he went.
Dean on the other hand mentioned college a fair bit. After Charlie had been accepted to Harvard, with a full scholarship after they’d seen her coding skills, and Sam had started looking at studying at Stanford once he’d graduated Dean had looked at several colleges, Castiel had seen the brochures in his room. They didn’t talk about it in depth, Castiel really didn’t want to think about the fact that Dean could be hundreds of miles away from him in just a few short months, but Castiel knew that it was something Dean was thinking about heavily even if they didn’t talk about it. It was a niggling worry but Castiel had gone long enough with niggling worries so he learnt how to push it down until it was barely noticeable.
Eileen asked.
They settled in their seats, Cas opening two bottles of beer and sliding one across the table for Dean. A playful smile on his lips. "So, Dean Winchester from Lawrence, Kansas. Tell me about yourself."
Oh, Jesus Christ. These kids were going to be the death of Dean. And damn, if both Claire and Jack weren’t giving him the puppy dog eyes.
“Your full name is
“Damn Cas, you really need to see more of this city.” Dean quipped with a quiet laugh even though he didn’t really feel like laughing at all.
"It ain't gonna be news to you that Novak pretty much lives at that hospital. I was a third-year resident when he was an intern but I still noticed he never spent time with his other interns. He keeps to himself most of the time so it's good he's got someone now."
"Why Cas? Because you hate me that fucking much or because you're scared?" Dean asked moving closer to Castiel still. Castiel's pulse quickened as Dean pressed his chest against Castiel's own. His heart was slamming violently against his chest and he was terrified of even breathing. "Just tell me, do you want me to leave because you hate me or are you just scared?" Dean asked moving closer still, his forehead rested against Castiel's and it would only take an inch or two for their lips to meet. Castiel could already taste Dean on his tongue, that musky, heady taste he’d been thinking about ever since Dean had kissed him. The taste was so intoxicating it all but crumbled Castiel’s will power.
It was surprising how easily the two boys slipped into something that felt so easy and natural. Castiel’s initial doubts where still there but as the first week became two those nerves and doubts began to sink. They didn’t disappear entirely but they were less prominent than they had been. What surprised Castiel so much was how understanding Anna, Charlie and Jo were. True Anna had been angry that Castiel had been keeping things from her, especially the truth behind what had happened between Castel and Dean after the fight with Alistair, but after a few days of endless coffee Anna softened up. There were days when Castiel would go into a blind panic and doubt everything to do with his relationship with Dean, after all doubting himself was all he ever really knew so why would he stop now?
“Yes, this is it.” Castiel said trying to fight the nervous roll of his stomach.
He really was getting in over his head.
"Ah yes. Kissing Bandit Bradbury." Sam said with a snort. "She even got me."
“God bless Amy Milton. Here’s hoping that next year is just as eventful.” Michael said. “Were you back home in Kansas with your family?” He then asked Dean. Dean nodded.
“Oh my God, what happened?” Anna asked as her voice lost all severity
“Not really. Where is he?” Dean asked noticing that there was definitely so sign of Cas.
“And you were right. I was trying to fuck a priest. Or, you know, get fucked by a priest.”
“Anna it’s me…you have to believe-” Castiel tried to say before the line went dead. Her reaction didn’t surprise him but it still hurt. Anna had been trained just like Castiel and his brothers. Castiel, along with his brothers, had been trained by James Novak from a young age to never trust anyone or anything, no matter what they thought because it could always end up being used against you. Castiel tried to ring Anna again, on both her cell phone and her home phone, reversing the charges each time, but Anna refused each call. Next was Samandriel’s phone which rang out until it went to voice mail thus breaking the main rule Castiel had instilled upon his youngest brother; always answer your phone. He tried Gabriel’s cell phone but it had been disconnected and that sent a wave of panic through his body. Gabriel could be anywhere but at least he knew that Samandriel would be at school in Boston while Anna was at her home in Essex, Illinois, which wasn’t far away from their childhood city of Pontiac.
“I know…shit I should have just told him that I loved him before all of this. I do as well, I do love him and I’m past giving a shit over how sappy that sounds. He’s the smartest guy I’ve ever met, he’s such an asshole sometimes that I want to punch him but then he’ll turn round and say something so sappy it’s insane. I…dammit I do love him but I couldn’t say it and now…now I’ve fucked up.”
“Yeah, but if it’s blueberry then don’t even bother,” Dean said before taking a generous gulp of his mocha. He wasn’t one for mochas, they were more Sam’s drink than his, but damn it was good and just what he needed. Well that, a huge slice of pie and Jo, Charlie and Sarah staying silent for as long as possible.
, he wanted Cas. All of Cas.
“So you told Jo about last night?” Dean asked.
that’s like one of the best medical schools in the country not to mention one of the most expensive…you’re kind of a princess.”
“No, no I wasn’t fine with it because it was the first time I had to introduce them to a guy. Back then, it was because of me dating a guy but it’s not now. He was at Yale with me, he was a student just like I was and not my resident.” Dean said. “My parents wouldn’t be pissed at me because I’m dating you, they would just be worried about what people would say to me. My dad has worked in a hospital since he was in his twenties, he knows the kind of shit people say about interns who date residents and that’s why I didn’t tell them, I told you all of this and I thought you understood it.”
"So far they like Amelia, Anna, and Ruby." Charlie said. Dean punched the air with a shit eating grin. "Seriously Josie, stop giving Dean all the good ones." She said with a groan.
“Come on in,” Cas called to whoever was outside.
"So what happened?" Cas asked.
“I get to say goodbye to Gabriel.” Castiel said sternly. “He will never forgive me for this if I don’t talk to him before.”
“Don’t act like it isn’t true Winchester, everyone knows that you’ve been screwing Novak and now it’s clear to us all why you got this surgery. Actually, it’s clear why you got to scrub in on so many of Novak’s surgeries before this. The two of you bump uglies then he rewards you with a gold star and a nice gory cardio surgery. It’s cute really…well if ‘cute’ meant ‘sickening to the core’. At first, I thought you were buddying up to Lafitte to get ahead but you went even further than that, had to keep all your bases covered, just in case Lafitte saw through it?” Ruby said sounding so sanctimonious Dean was tempted to smack her across the face. And he never thought about hitting a woman.
“Yeah, I’m guessing there’s history there," Dean said with a smirk.
“Ok. From the very top, tell me what exactly happened.” Cas said, sliding his phone into the clip-in phone holder his assistant Hannah had given him at Christmas. On the screen, his former ex-husband grinned sheepishly. “Don’t smile at me like that Dean, it won’t work.” Cas added.
room!” Gabriel interrupted.
Naomi glided into the room with a fierce look on her cold face. Clearly, she was planning on putting the entire class through their paces. Cas could already feel his muscles groaning in protest.
"Nope. I swore I wouldn't. Besides, who hasn't eaten weed brownies in university?"
"This will be yours then. Black with no sugar." Cas said handing over the cup. For a moment their fingers grazed one another. How many times had Dean held that hand? More times than he could count really. Now it felt weird to even look at Cas' hands.
“You haven’t told me everything that has happened!” Gabriel snapped.
“No. Feet off the dash,” Dean said, whacking Sammy on the leg. “Were you raised in a damn barn?”
"Can we
." Cas was saying on screen. "
"Alistair said something about Mom ok? He tried to say something about her so I punched him." Castiel said and Luke's face darkened. "I know I shouldn't have done it but he pissed me off by being mean to Charlie and then that just made me see red. I can apologise to him but for that moment I just needed him to shut up, I couldn’t hear him say anything about Mom…"
"At least I use a towel and don't walk around ass naked."
“You too Mr Milton.” Dean said politely.
"You know what I mean. Charlie is…well she wears Doctor Who sweaters and looks like she’d happily live at Comic Con whereas the detention crowd...well they seem more like your kind of people even if I don’t like it" Anna said with a slight smirk. "Hey I'm not saying it’s a bad thing that you’re friends with Charlie, she seems nice enough-"
“Oh…ok. Well I’ll see you in Algebra on Monday” Dean said, clearly Charlie hadn’t told him that she had invited Castiel to the Winchester’s house that night. The thought actually made Castiel happy because it was easier that way.
“Pliés in first, demi, demi full, port de bras and rise, same second. Port de bras back, fourth, no grand plié. Press through the feet and your heels. Repeat until we tell you to stop. Music please.” Balthazar said.
“You have money and a freaking huge house but can you really tell me that you’ve lived? You went from school to college then back home I’m guessing, working for your father until he died and you were given the position of CEO. That ain’t living.”
“I just hope that Balthazar and Naomi liked it,” Cas said, still breathless from his dance.
The animosity between Luke and their father had started when Luke was around fourteen and had gone on ever since, though Castiel wasn't too sure as he'd always known that Luke and their father did not get along. Luke was brash, determined but incredibly in tune with his emotions. He had his moments of vanity and selfishness, his ways of getting what he wanted weren't always the most conventional ways and sometimes he acted without as much compassion as others, especially when it came to his family but Castiel couldn't Luke like Michael no doubt wanted him to. Castiel amused Luke, he had told Castiel that much several years prior. He amused Luke because of his general way of looking at the world but Castiel secretly thought that Luke's amusement came from the fact that Castiel wasn't, despite Michael's attempts, a clone of his eldest brother. Castiel lacked Michael's determination to stick to which ever rules set down by their father. Luke, and Gabriel on numerous occasions, commented that Michael was like a blind solider going off into battle when it came to their father, their father would give the orders and Michael would follow them until the end no matter what really. It hasn't always been like this but when Castiel's mother had walked out on them things had changed.
go back to watching the movies?" Charlie asked pleadingly

“Do I look like a fat naked diaper wearing harp player to you?” Dean replied with an arched eyebrow. From the look on Gabriel’s face he was itching to say something uncouth or overtly acerbic but Castiel shook his head. There was a time and a place for his brother lack of tact or penchant but now was not it.
“I’m sensing the date between you and Milligan didn’t go very well,” Cas said as he dried a dinner plate.
Who that was he did not know, but whoever the name belonged to had to have something with where Castiel was; they had to have something to do with how Castiel had become free from Hell. He was not sure how he would manage it but Castiel was determined to find out who it was and track them down. He had to know how and why he’d been freed and at what cost.
He was as well. He thought he would be scared but Dean would be with him, Dean would make sure he wasn’t alone in this and that’s what Castiel wanted. He wanted Dean by his side until the end.
"So Dean, how are you settling into Lawrence?" Richard asked. Dean looked startled at being addressed.
“Yeah ok…thanks for talking to him Sam, I owe you,” Dean said. He said his quick goodbyes to his brother before hanging up and sighing loudly.
“Well?” Bela pressed, looking between Dean and Cas expectantly.
"Michael-"
“I…I don’t know Anna.” Castiel said shaking his head. The name Danyael flashed through his mind once again but that was all there was; a name with no face. “I don’t have any memory of leaving The Pit…I saw a light and that…there was nothing but light.” He tried to explain but he couldn’t. “We need to find Gabriel. I tried ringing him-”
“Dean if you’re going to do what I think you’re going to do then it’s dangerous and breaking more rules than I would even want to count!” Sam said grabbing onto Dean’s arm again with such force that it would bruise if possible. Dean gave him a scathing look as he ripped his arm from Sam’s vicelike grip.
"Hey...it's Dean," Dean said wincing at how awkward he sounded. This was
“Excuse me? How did I not know this? How does no one but you know this?” Jess asked.
"Huh?" Dean asked as he placed a new filter into his coffee machine and added the necessary coffee.
“No, you don’t. You’re gonna tell me all about why Novak was asleep on the couch and why he was in the shower once I’m at the hospital.” Jo added making it clear that Dean had no other choice in the matter.
Jo yawned loudly and looked like she was going to cry with happiness when Bela and Dean appeared holding trays of coffees. Dean handed Cas his large coffee with a tired smile and sat down next to him. Dean had hardly slept the night before, Cas had heard him tossing and turning all night.
Castiel sighed with frustration as he asked “Because I told him that he had no right to worry about me?”
“How did you get hold of this?” Adam asked Sam while Dean looked at his closest kin with caution. The weapons of both Heaven and Hell that the angels had tracked down were normally kept under strict guard. Sam held a lot of importance in Heaven but still getting hold of the weapon would have taken a lot
"Gabe says that every year." Dean said while on screen the show kicked into gear. Cas was introduced to the audience with various shots of him in New York.
“Dean-”
Part of Dean was sad that he couldn’t just reach over and kiss Cas goodbye but he didn’t want anyone to make some sarcastic comment. He saw a fleeting sad look on Cas’ face and wondered if Cas was thinking the same thing. Instead, Dean reached over and gave his boyfriend’s arm a gentle squeeze. Cas’ face actually lit up and the giant goof walked off with the sappiest smile Dean had seen in a while. It took Dean a moment to remember that Adam was even there and wanted to talk to him.
"Yeah, I'm sorry it must be the middle of the freaking night where you are. I forgot about the time difference." Dean said looking down at his watch and yeah, it would have just gone past one in the morning over in England. Fuck.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck.” Sam muttered as Jess followed his gaze. Instantly her face clouded over.
going to tell me about your acceptance to MCAD?” Dean said finally opening his eyes and looking at Castiel.
“Why, what does he do?”
"What are they like?" Michael asked. Of all the things he could have said Dean wasn’t expecting that.
"No I don't. What's the point of dragging this all up again?" Dean asked. "Jimmy, I loved your brother. I really loved him. I would have done anything for him and yet he just walked away. He left me, I'm not going to put my heart on the line again. It was hard enough stitching myself up the last time."
Over the course of the next several weeks Castiel found himself slipping into an easy routine of which he never attended to slip into. He tried so hard to deny himself of it out in the end it crept up on him. Routines used to be something he shied away from because they reminded him too much of being in hospital and the few faltering weeks after when he’d come home. It reminded him off being woken up every single morning by Gabriel, he had refused point blank when it came to having Michael or Luke wake him up, and being given the medication he’d been on back then.
"ETA on cars?" Dean asked.
"It's Sammy's turn." Dean said ruffling his brother's hair.
“I’m going to the bar.” Dean said before he actually did hit Ruby with a damn chair.
“Sounds like me with Charlie and Sammy.
left. I didn't want you to."
He still walked away.
"There's no need to stand there like a statue, I heard you coming." Dean said as he watched the smoke disappear into the night air.
"I know your father nearly died from a heart attack but he's an asshole." Cas said.
"He thought that was what you wanted." Jimmy said. "He told me why he did it."
." Jo said almost pleadingly. That’s when Dean knew it was important, Jo had never pleaded with him. Over the years when Dean had been able to hunt Jo had joined him a few times. Her mother Ellen had hated those times, thinking that Jo would be in danger. He hadn’t been on a hunt with Jo in over five years though.
"Your mama is gonna freak." Jimmy said.
“What do they look like?” Dean guessed and Castiel nodded. Dean scratched the neck of his neck as he tried to search for the words. Sam had only asked him about souls once. It had been eight years ago and Dean had asked Sam not to ask him again, the image of his own swirling black soul contrasting against Sam’s bright gold forever burnt into his brain. “They’re…every soul is different. Different colours and different ways that they move under the skin. Some are bright and move like water, others dark and moving like smoke. I notice them by people’s hands normally, others notice them in other ways but for me it’s the hands.”
Cas yawned loudly, stretching out his torso as he lifted his arms over his head. That did not help matters or the serious situation going on in Dean's brain from the sight of Cas' hipbones.
“That’s perfect!”
“Well?” she asked as Castiel came to sit down in the chair opposite her.
"Cas I...I don't..." Dean mumbled.
"She's not going to die Cas," Dean said as he pulled Cas close to him and kissed his head. "Like you said, she ain't her mom. She's not gonna die," Cas hoped that Dean was right.
"Ben...my name's Ben. Is my mom gonna be ok? She looked really bad in the ambulance." The kid asked looking around the ER. Dean's heart went out to the kid, he was obviously scared out of his wits.
“Good, his plan would have been awful.” Sam said. “Look kids, I know damn well that Dean still loves Cas and judging from what you’ve told us, Cas probably still loves Dean. Just let them fight it out, turn whatever movie you’re watching way up and see how things are in the morning. I know these two idiots pretty well, you can’t force them into anything.”
"What is it with this Jess girl? Who is she, Helen of fucking Troy?" Dean asked. Sam and Gabriel stared back at him blankly. "Homer? The Iliad?
“That’s lovely honey. Dean, does Castiel want to stay for dinner?” Mary then called. Castiel glanced over at the clock on the fireplace and swore under his breath. It was nearing seven in the evening and Michael was expecting him at the dinner table any moment. His brother was going to kill him.
"We did talk, it ended in me yelling at him." Dean pointed out.
“Yeah, I might get round to replacing it one day,” Dean said absentmindedly.
"If you're looking for sympathy you're not going to get it." Dean warned.
That was never really a good sign.
“Like you said, I haven’t got long left here. Do I really want to waste my time trying to socialise with people?” he added.
“Balthazar said you were all having drinks and said we should join you.” Amelia said. “We’ve been bored all day and we needed this. The bright red teenager is right, some of these women are dumber than a bag of rocks.”
"I’m fine. I just needed to ask you a favour."
"I rarely have drinks with colleagues if that is what you are asking." Castiel said taking a small sip of his beer. Dean wondered if the guy was loosen up after a drink or two but he doubted it, actually he doubted this whole evening but maybe if he got Castiel to smile for once then the dude would go easier on him.
“I’ll never really understand you Castiel, Jimmy is so straight forward but you…you really are something else entirely but I love you.”
“I guess I sometimes worry that everyone wants to see me fail.” Castiel said with a weary sigh and Dean felt nothing but empathy for the other man. The two men sat in Castiel’s office, occasionally looking out the window to the skyline below. Castiel reclined in his chair with a heavy sigh while Dean watched him. “I might not have wanted this career but it’s all that is left of my father. I can’t lose it.”
“Sammy did always love me. All the Winchesters did," Jo said smugly.
"Sorry to interrupt but aren't you Cas Reeves?" Castiel spun round, his heart hammering as he prayed that he wasn't hearing things.
rock star with a scalpel.” He added.
They warmed up and worked through various positions at the barre. Once that was over Naomi made everyone get together with their pas partner. Bela looked like she was chewing a bee.
“About Dean finding Novak attractive,” Jo said before Dean or Adam had a chance to say anything.
"Are you thick Dean Winchester?" Anna asked rolling her eyes. "The past two years have been a massive cluster fuck."
Dean gave him a thankful smile and went back to looking at the noticeboard. Most of the photos were of Castiel with his siblings but a few were of younger looking Castiel with a blonde guy, both of them always smiling in the photos.
Amelia placed a hand on his arm and nodded over towards the main entrance to the dining hall. Castiel made his way over to the other man without even a second thought.
"Forget it Cas, you said it yourself after all. We could never be friends." Dean hissed. "You come back here after two years acting like nothing happened. You act like nothing happened between us. It did though, it happened. You're right, we can't be friends because we never were friends. We're just two guys who fucked each other in the same bed for a while."
"Sam?" Dean asked when he opened the door downstairs.
good," She added with a sniff.
“Nothing stronger than Pepsi, sir? What was that?”
Dean dug his nails even deeper into his palm, his other hand gripping onto the hot coffee mug. They had somehow moved closer to one another and Dean was sure Cas could hear his heart pounding loudly for it was all he could hear. That was until he remembered that this was Cas. This was
“I don’t think I’m emotionally intelligent enough for this! The man drives me
There it was, that
Gabriel shrugged as someone called out his name. Both Gabriel and Sam spun around, Sam instantly feeling his face grow hot when he saw Jessica Milton gracefully walking over.
After a few hours of semi-interrupted sleep Castiel woke groggy and irritated. His dreams were always so realistic that even when he got more than few hours’ of sleep he still felt tired. His dream the night before had been just as realistic as all his others though a small part of his brain knew that there was no way he would sit on the hood of Dean's car, Dean next to him, in the middle of the woods that backed Castiel's house. There would be no way that he would sit there and just talk to Dean, tell him about his family and especially about his mother. There was no way he would learn over and kiss Dean when he told him everything would be ok.
“Right sit down, man are you in for an education!” Dean said motioning for Castiel to sit down on the couch. “Never seen
“Oh my god,” Cas muttered, burying his head in his hands. He raised his head to glare at Gabriel. “I can’t believe you showed my
“Fuck sake Jimmy. These fucking boxes weigh a goddamn fucking ton.” The guy said with a voice like gravel. Dean knew instantly that it wasn’t Jimmy, even if the guy looked shockingly like him. Jimmy would never let his hair grow that long and he certainly didn’t have tattoos running up and down both arms. He also shared Dean's hatred for Bon Iver. “Fuck, you’re not Jimmy.” the guy said when his shockingly blue eyes fell onto Dean.
“I’ve seen the way you two look at one another and you’ve been jumpy ever since he turned up at the party.” Jimmy said. He was always so observant, even when they were small children. Jimmy knew nearly everything about Castiel, sometimes even before Castiel knew it himself. “You’d tell me if there was something right?”
“Well yeah...I mean we’re friends so why wouldn’t I?” Dean asked.
An hour later Dean, Claire, Jack, Sam and Eileen were all standing in the arrival lounge waiting for Cas to appear.
"It's our morning smoke and bitch time," Cas said.
“Dean! What the hell are you doing in there? Will you hurry up?” Sam yelled from right outside the door. He was going to come into the room and see way more of Dean and Cas in a second.
Dean and Mary were sat in the living room, TV on low in the background, talking through everything when the house phone rang loudly. Mary rolled her eyes, she generally hated answering the house phone because it was nearly always for John, but went to answer it anyway while Dean gently sipped on what felt like his tenth cup of tea that evening.
“You’re a damn good resident, I hope people tell you that more often,” Dean said giving Cas a kiss before going off in the search for desperately needed caffeine. Well, caffeine and maybe some advice from his brother. Pulling out his phone Dean quickly sent a text message to Sam.
“She what?” Dean asked and that was finally when Dean looked at the kid. Really looked at him. “Wait…Jack? Jack, is that you?” Dean asked looking down at the kid. The kid’s face broke out into a nervous looking smile. “Oh, holy shit.” Dean gasped out because of all the people he was expecting to see today, Jack was not one of them.
It wasn’t until Dean was midway through brushing his teeth, slightly hindered by Cas nudging him with his hip, when he realised that he’d never seen or heard from Jo since before he’d come back to the apartment. She was always up when Dean’s alarm went off so it was obvious she wasn’t in the apartment; Dean would have to send her a text message as soon as he had the chance. It was nothing new for Jo not to come back to the apartment. Actually, it was nothing new for either of them not to return to the apartment after work. Sometimes Jo would end up asleep in either the on-call room or the intern’s locker room and Dean had taken to sleeping in the hospital when he’d been waiting on a heart for Krissy.
“Yeah…you’re going to take out my old crappy heart and give me a brand new shiny one,” Krissy said. “He said a load of fancy words but I think was to impress my parents because I didn’t have a clue what he was on about half the time. He’s hot though…not as hot as you but still hot. All my teammates are going to be so jealous that I got the hot doctors.” Krissy said smugly.
He couldn’t watch this happen again. He couldn’t let another loved one die in front of him. He couldn’t have the blood of someone he loved soak his clothing again but he couldn’t leave Gabriel. He couldn’t let Gabriel die alone. He shouldn’t be letting Gabriel die at all.

“Sam-”
“Call Anna.” Samandriel finally managed say after several moments of deep breathing. “Send me your coordinates and I'll be there as soon as possible.” he said firmly because it was easier to slip the role of the leader, the role Castiel had so easily slipped into after their father’s death, than it was to let himself become overcome by the news of his eldest brother’s death. “Don’t do anything rash or stupid.” Samandriel said before hanging up and storming back into his dormitory. Kevin groaned at the light coming in from the hallway and once Samandriel turned on the main light to the room his swore loudly.
As a way of either teaching Dean, or making him doubt everything he’d ever learnt since medical school, Dr Sands asked him endless questions from the moment he entered the OR. He really wasn’t sure if Dr Sands realised that she was making him feel more nervous than he was already but damn if he was going to let her know that.
“You’re a first-year resident who smells like whiskey,” Cas said rolling his eyes.
“Excuse me?” Anna cried with an affronted look. “You don’t think that I did
you that Mr Novak-Reeves was in a meeting. Kindly remove yourself from his office and wait.” Hannah said, her posture straightening to give herself more height. Zachariah whipped round to glare at her in a way he probably thought was menacing before he looked back at Castiel.
“Yes Gabriel it’s really me. I promise you that this is me and that I won’t go anywhere.”
"Thought you'd never ask," Cas said, holding out his hand as if to invite Dean back to the couch, back to him.
“Oh Dean, you sure know how to treat a woman.” Anna said. Dean snorted loudly. “I’ve got to go Dean, the caterers are here. Call me when you’re nearly at mine ok?”
"There's no need for you to be. We were never that close and they weren't as supportive of my career choice as I wanted them to be. My brother is married and lives in New York with his wife and Anna, my sister, lives in Italy at the moment but she travels all over the world.” Cas said.
“No dude, he’s still at work.” Gabriel said. “Why, what’s happened
"Says the girl who uses every single towel when she's showering."
I apologise for how choppy some of this seems, I mainly just wanted to write the Josie as a nun scene and the final scene. Once again my editing software is playing up so some of this will seem off. Once again I am sorry.
“How the hell do you know that?” Dean asked. “What did Jo say to you?”
“No…not exactly. I assumed from all your prayers that you’d find our family first and your younger brother was at Red’s house so-”
“Don’t worry, I know all about it,"
“Of course it was.” Cas said smugly. Dean rolled his eyes. “I understand that this puts you in a terrible position but I can’t ignore my feelings either. I can’t pretend that I don’t care about you. I think you’re a better person than you realise.” Cas said. He leaned in a captured Dean’s lips with his own yet again. Dean melted into Cas’ kiss and he felt himself just slipping deeper into something he was truly scared of.
“No, he’s still the same annoying ass he’s always been.” Cas said.
How could Dean say that he was up on the roof moping because he'd seen Cas talking and laughing with some scrub nurse? It would sound stupid and completely ridiculous but maybe Dean was being ridiculous. He had no claim on Castiel whatsoever and they were just friends. They would only ever be just friends as well.
Cas. To have him take Dean to the very brink and back again, just like he had in New York.
"Got anything you want to tell me?"
"Yeah 'Cas', she can take care of herself so just walk along." Alistair sneered in that haunting voice of his.
“I’m sorry…I’m sorry for bringing up Jo but I have to do this, I don’t need you to help me-”
“Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. I remember reading about them back in med school. Has Novak thought about it?”
“Ok, what is Conn’s syndrome?” Sarah asked reading from one of the study cards she had made.
“No, if it had been the Impala then I would have thrown her fucking body into Camden Lock. It was still my 1975 Jensen-Healey," Dean said but he still sounded mad. Cas had zero idea of what that meant.
The Novak family had many, varied and sometimes not exactly moral, talents. Subtly was not one of them. As soon as Castiel walked through the back door, his running shoes caked in mud from his run, and into the kitchen on a Saturday morning he knew something was up. For starters his father was sat at the table eating breakfast which was a miracle in itself as their father was never around on Saturdays. Secondly both Michael and Luke were sat at the table and they weren’t fighting. The final thing that proved something was up was that Gabriel was smiling broadly and handed Castiel a full mug of coffee as soon as he kicked off his running shoes. A pool of fear settled in Castiel stomach because something had to be wrong, it was his family after all and something was always wrong.
“Cas is camping on the couch tonight, we’re going over some more research for my exam before rounds.” Dean lied.
“I would love to but I haven’t been paying attention.” Castiel said grinning once again. This time he heard Anna groan into her hand while several others snickered more loudly than before.
“I worry about your intelligence if you have to ask that question.” Castiel said while Anna flipped through the remaining cards and licences. Once she’d finished fishing out those belonging to Castiel she held them out to him so he could choose one.
“Don’t look at me.” Dean said quickly.
“So no detention? Dad and Michael will be so proud…I so hope there’s cake.” Gabriel said.
“Ten minutes of kissing then get up?” Cas offered. Dean shook his head. “Fine, fifteen minutes but that would be cutting into coffee drinking time.”
She gave him a steely look but sighed heavily and flopped back in her seat.
“Hey I was a political prisoner just like Castiel.” Dean said giving his mother a bright smile different from the smirk Castiel had seen him give others.
“Yeah I need to go now. It’s kind of serious.” Samandriel said as he pulled his jacket off the nearest chair. He patted it down until he found his car keys. “I’ll email you or text you once I’ve found my brother.” He said absentmindedly as he made his way to the door.
“And I should take your advice? We were all trying to get you and Cas to talk for ages. You were too stubborn to take our advice.”
During the break between
For a moment it looked like Dean's brain was rebooting before he reached for his phone and, with a smirk, fired off a text message.
“Hence the light sabre fight; you know he always did fancy himself as Han Solo when we were younger. It used to drive Sam up the wall.” Charlie said with a small chuckle.
“Don’t give him any ideas.” Dean said. “Hey babe, in the kitchen.” Dean called out towards the hallway as the crashing sound could only have been Cas.
“Good choice, I’ll have the same.” Hot Sweary Priest said, giving Dean a secret look of solidarity despite them having never met before.
“Dean just go away.” Castiel snapped quickening his pace until he was at a near jog. He heard Dean groaned loudly and he took off in the Impala. Relief surged through Castiel until he realised that Dean had parked on his driveway and was now climbing out the car to glare at Castiel.
“Blinked at me several times and told me he looked forward to working with me this year.” Dean said. “He’s probably going to kill me and use me as a cadaver in the skills lab.” He added with a moan.
“Don’t give us that shit, we already know you’re both naked.” Came Sam’s voice. “Jimmy texted Anna about his emotional scarring.”
“Sam I was trying to get some independence. I was at a damn good school and I’d worked hard to get there.”
Castiel looked away from Krissy for a moment to give Charlie a firm look.
“We can make it work Cas, I know we can 'cause...I love you Cas. Always have. Always will.” Dean said, pulling Cas in for a kiss.
Without any finesse Castiel began pulling at Dean's t-shirt, desperate to feel the heat of Dean's skin without material getting in the way at all. Dean's lips left Castiel's clavicle momentarily as he pulled the worn and faded t-shirt up over Dean's head and once again his breath hitched as the shirt fell to the floor.
“How do you think he’s doing you moron? An eighteen-year-old kid died on his table and now
"Are you sure?" Amelia asked. Dean nodded.
“Dude if you don't want my pity then I won't give it you.” Dean said in an attempt to stare right back at Castiel. Dean couldn't help but wonder if Castiel ever tried just staring a creature in the eyes, the intensity of his gaze was off to gank anything.
“I hear that congratulations are in order,” Ruby said with a voice dripping with sarcasm and disdain.
. It’s so good I want to break every bone in his feet,”
“You’re quitting.” Dean said. Josie’s nostrils flared. "Fine, someone get her a box of Marlboros! Menthol!” Yet more assistants and interns went scurrying. “I’ll find him. I promise.” Dean said back to Josie. She gave him a rare smile, which still looked kind of scary, and let out a sigh.
“Like what?”
“Darling, so glad we caught before you fled,” Amy said with a smirk before kissing Cas on the cheek.
“I’d like to remind you that I was the one who said that skipping dipping was an important part of any road trip.” Castiel said with smug justification.
“I’d probably be able to watch more of it if you didn’t talk all the way through.”
Gabriel’s breathing was becoming laboured as Castiel looked up towards the sky. His mother had told him as a child that he was blessed, that angels watched over him and his siblings but nothing looked back but the inky black sky littered with barely visible stars.
“For the moment I'll settle on knowing that you are indeed Danyael as well as Zachariah's true identity.”
“Dean Winchester, of course I want to marry you, you idiot.” Cas said, sighing with exasperation. “That’s why I was going to propose...tonight...at dinner.”
“Yeah, I remember your uncle alright. Ruined our damn couch.” Dean muttered darkly.
“Nah, just let me get some coffee and I’ll be good,” Dean said accepting the travel mug of coffee from Cas. “What’s the emergency?”
“You’re coming to dinner. With me. At my parents’ house. We need to get out of here.” Cas said. “Everyone is walking around like zombies and acting crazy. We need to get out of here before we go insane right along with them.” Cas himself could feel the slow creep of cabin fever settling in. He needed to be somewhere that wasn’t the academy and eat food that hadn’t been prepared in the cafeteria.
She and Meg might have snipped at each other in the past but they were friends deep down. Weird friends but they were friends. Bela would never have wished something like this on Meg. Cas pulled her into a tighter hug. There was a commotion in the hall as Dean barged into the room.
“I work with my father, we travel around a lot solving cases, so I get the whole not wanting to be close to people,” Dean admitted and Castiel’s eyes lit up in interest.
. For fuck sake, why was it that everyone he loved would tend to leave him? Was he so damaged that they couldn’t stand to be with him for too long?
"Where are you going?" Cas asked.
“I’m still very upset by our last meeting Danyael. You stole my chew toy then left me hanging quite literally; it was
“Personal errand? Personal errand, my ass. You went missing for
“Sammy I’m sure. I mean it, I’ll see you in a few days.” Dean said. He gave his brother a quick hug and bid his goodbyes before watching Sam drive off. Dean missed driving from place to place on hunts but time was of the essence here so instead of driving he found other ways of travelling to Long Island.
“Yeah. I know she’s terrifying and totally inappropriate but she does have a heart…it’s probably hidden deep…deep…deep down but it’s in there.” Dean said. Cas chuckled and they finally made their way back to the control room. Before Dean walked back inside Cas lowered his voice and pulled Dean to one side.
"But you still love me?" Cas asked looking hopeful.
"Hey, I'm just doing my job." Dean said.
“Yeah…Jack, how did you know that?” Claire asked. Ok, this was no longer weird. This was getting freaky.
A dark sick feeling in Dean’s stomach twisted itself into a furious knot. The woman was standing too close to Cas, her chest practically pressed against his as she laughed along with something Cas had just said. Everything about her stance, the look she was giving Cas and the way she was holding onto her drink screamed ‘flirtatious’.
"Wait, I doubt I'll be able to do this for a while." Cas said, pulling Dean in for a chaste kiss and swiftly deepened until Dean was light-headed. "Dean...I could just walk away from the show...buy out my contract..." Cas said, his bright blue eyes full of hope.
you ok? I’m completely and
“Oh...oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for asking.”
Sensing that familiar pull in his gut Dean quickly turned to Sam with a desperate look.
“Are you offering your services there?” Adriel, said scoffing loudly. Dean whipped round to glare her harshly.
"You know, I'd pay good money to see you do one of your old cheerleading routines."
“Ok ok, no more talking about the precious kid brother.” Tessa said rolling her eyes. Dean could feel his hackles rising but he knew better than to antagonise Tessa. She might have looked like your average girl but Dean knew that Tessa was not someone to mess with or get on the wrong side of. “I have a name and you need to be in Colorado as soon as possible.” Tessa said sharply.
. The two of us being together.”
“Well, Sam can hear all about it when he gets back. Let me grab a sweater or something then I’ll make you a coffee if you want.”
"Bullshit, Cas has been sleeping in your room every time he's been here for months. You guys are not subtle with your dirty secret sex."
- Basically another word for stitches. It sounds fancier but it's still stitches and it still hurts like a bitch (this is coming from experience)
“Cas, I
Cas stared at Dean for a long beat before his whole body seemed to slump.
Dean snorted as he went into Krissy’s room, a very smug grin on her face.
I saw how you were looking at the delectable but grumpy surgeon.” Bela pressed with the same knowing look she used to give Dean when he pretended that he hadn’t eaten all her fries back in the dining halls at Yale.
“Nice to know Josie, we’ll be back soon.” Dean said before turning his walkie off.
“He does this every Saturday morning.” Charlie said to Castiel.
“And what?”
“Dean? Do you want some coffee?” Cas called.
"No.” Jo said with a loud, throaty sounding scoff. “It's your business, not mine so why would I?"
A weight that Dean didn’t even realise was in his chest lifted as he pocketed the phone. He had been wrong putting off calling Michael but now he was making amends. He reached for the coffee sat on a chair in front of him and wondered if Cas was finished with whatever it was that he needed to do, if so they could probably change and get something to eat soon, which was good as Dean was pretty damn hungry.
Cas had always been lean, built like a runner, but with strong muscles gained from years of dancing. The boy in front of him resembled a football player, even down to the All American looks and a flannel shirt. It wasn't hard to guess that this was Dean Winchester, he was the spitting image of his mother.
“I’d honestly recommend you all see a therapist.”
"Christ Jess, the
"You." She said, pointing a finger at Cas. "Can shut up, stop waving your penis in Dean's general direction and
“Yeah, it has.” Cas said looking incredibly uncomfortable.
“What the hell have I missed?” Jimmy asked. “You and Cas fuck off to the airport and now you two are practically fucking again and Sam is in love with Amelia’s cousin?”
“Take a seat.” Becky said, snapping her fingers towards the chair across from her desk. “One second.” she added, holding up a finger as she typed with her free hand. “Now, Castiel...people see you as somewhat…”
"You two are going to have to talk sooner or later." Amelia said.
Yeah, he was never agreeing to let Jo cook for a while. Ellen Harvelle’s cooking skills obviously hadn’t been passed down to Jo.
Dean raised a full glass of whiskey to his lips and drained it of its contents. In a matter of days everything had begun to crash around him and t felt like he was fighting against a great storm. He’d lost two fellow warriors and Heaven had lost two of their leaders. With Camael now active that left Heaven in the hands of him and Raphael which was not a pleasant thought. Hopefully the whiskey would help drown those thoughts out. As he moved to refill his glass a shadow near the doorframe to the room caught his eye.
“Silence.”
“Or go to the Smithsonian!” Claire offered.
“Like…’together’ together?” Meg asked. Cas nodded. “Fucking hell Milton, you work fast. I fucking knew it. I knew that you would get into his tights.”
“Well, no one ask Cas what he was up to because then you’ll hear nothing but ‘fabulous’ stories about Paris,” Meg said, giving Cas a nudge. “I’m still waiting on my invite by the way,” She said snippily.
"Nothing, it's just easier sometimes sleeping at the hospital. I'm there for rounds first so I can get on the good cases which will help once I'm taking my intern exam." Dean said as the microwave pinged loudly telling him that his dinner was ready. "And since when did you talk to Jo?" he asked while plating his food up.
Dean’s stomach dropped at the mention of his name. He felt his face flush red as every single intern in the room turned to look at him.  While his stomach flipped over several times Dean saw Jo give him the widest smile he’d ever seen on his friend’s face. She was one of the only ones smiling though. Sure, Charlie, Sarah, Adam and Benny were grinning but that was it. Most of the other interns and other attendings just looked pissed, really pissed.
"Holy shit….Dean….God, you're so beautiful like this." Cas croaked out. "Takaya krasivaya…" Dean's humming chuckle sent vibrations of desire through Cas' whole body, making his head swim in the best way.
“My money is always on Meg.” Adam as Dean came up to the table with two coffees.
“You…you don’t think it was Cas do you?” Jo asked with a frown. Dean snorted loudly and shook his head. “Hear me out here Dean, he could have told the chief so it looked better than it coming from a nurse or someone.”
"I'm saying yes, just not right now ok? Ask me again in like six months, you know, when we've sorted stuff out."
“I don’t blame them.” Jimmy groaned.
The climax of their scene was when Dean, as Romeo, appeared to stab Cas during an elaborate lift. Male lifts were always difficult. Naomi was never a fan of them, but when she was forced to incorporate them she insisted on a slighter dancer being lifted. Dean and Cas were of the same build and the lift would have to look seamless for everyone to be impressed. Gabriel and Balthazar were counting on them to make it look perfect.
“Yeah well next time any of you get into a fight remember not to include me or any of my business.” Castiel snapped. He heard footsteps behind him and whirled round to see Dean standing in the doorway looking worried. If his chest had tight before it was nothing compared to how it felt now seeing Dean standing in the doorway. “Gabe I’ve got to go. Say ‘hello’ to Kali for me and I’ll talk to you soon…tell Dad…tell Dad that Luke wasn’t right about what he said.” Castiel said quickly.
“A jackass?”
“Do you really want me to answer that?” Cas asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Very well then.” Bela said even shrugging her shoulders. The woman Dean had just hugged to give comfort was long gone and replaced with the woman he’d known at Yale; cold self-confidence but wicked humour and fortitude. “You can operate as soon as you want. I have to make a few phone calls.” Bela said hurriedly as she strode out the room. If they were back at Yale Dean would have made Michael go after her to see if she was ok but they weren’t at Yale anymore. Dean was in Chicago slowly drowning under his internship and the knowledge that his resident probably hated him, Michael was across a freaking ocean and Bela’s father was lying in a bed slowly dying. How things had changed in just a few months.
“I’m pointing out the good scenes!”
"Are you busy this evening?" Castiel asked as if he was talking to a small child. Condescending dick.
“Oh feisty! Maybe later, maybe later.” He said in a quasi-coquettish lilt before bringing the whip back down upon the young man’s back opening up a brand new wound. “Did you know how much I do love an easy bleeder?” the whip bearer said to himself almost gleefully. “And you Castiel Novak must be my favourite easy bleeder of the lot. There is something special about breaking your soul until it is irreparable. I do enjoy it so.”
“You still told Adam.” Jess pointed out.
“By ‘things’ I assume you’re talking about the whole ‘reaper’ thing.”
“Well while you all enjoy this little family reunion I’m going to grab some wine…maybe a enough for a vineyard.” Gabriel said as he sauntered out the room.
“That was a lot of information,” Castiel said, sounding slightly dazed.
"What if he leaves me again?" Dean asked. Jimmy stopped. He didn't have an answer for that. "Exactly." Dean said.
“Oh please!” Charlie said snorting loudly. “You just couldn’t be bothered to get off your lazy fat ass to drive him home, admit it.”
“I love you too Cas.” Dean said as they staggered out of the small chapel. The late night streets were full of people, none of them seemed at all surprised by two drunk as fuck men stumbling and kissing as they made their way down the street.
It barely felt like he had any sleep before Dean was being woken up by a hand gently shaking his shoulder. Dean groaned sleepily as he opened his eyes to see Cas stood over him, dressed in just a t-shirt, jeans and a hooded jacket.
“I should probably being going, I have a coronary artery bypass graft tomorrow that I should prepare for,” Cas said rising up from the bench gracefully. He looked over at Dean, biting his lip as he did so. Damn, he was going to be the end of Dean even if he never realised it. “I was…wait never mind.”
"You break it you pay, remember?" He muttered.
“I guess it’s because I’ve never really shown them to anyone apart from you, I never actually took any classes at my other schools…I sort of signed up for the one here on a whim you know. The school is a pretty liberal place and it felt like the right thing to take an art class.” Dean said. “It’s worked out for me so far though…well I guess it has anyway.” Dean added slightly under his breath. Castiel glanced over at Dean’s sketch pad then back at the boy himself. Dean looked back at him and frowned slightly. “So…are you going to tell me why you spent the week ignoring me after Meg’s party?” Dean asked with a voice full of frustration.
“Oh your shameless flattery will only get you so far Castiel.” The demon said as she actually fluttered her eyelashes, which was no doubt in a sarcastic manner. “You get one minute. One minute or nothing at all. Deal?”
"Good evening Sam. I hope you're well."
Annnd we're back. Posting schedule should be back to normal now. As always, thank you for all the lovely responses to this fic so far! We're meeting the Winchesters in this chapter (yes, including John) and establishing some more characters. Things will start to heat up from here on out, I promise!
"Lucky Charms are nothing but sugar pretending that they are a breakfast food, I have no idea how you can eat that stuff." Castiel said pouring Dean a generous bowl of cereal despite him not actually believing that they were edible let alone a breakfast food. He was busy concentrating on the cereal that he didn't notice Dean moving ever so slightly and he wasn't aware of it until Dean was resting his chin on Castiel's shoulder then gently nuzzling into Castiel's neck. "Excuse me but I'm trying to be a culinary genius here Dean." Castiel said fighting the smirk creeping across his face.
“Meg I’m fourteen now,” Anna said proudly as she lifted her chin, her vibrant red hair looking even redder in the late August sun. “I’m not so little anymore.” She added. Over the summer Anna had grown at least two inches, she was still a small thing though. Years and years of dance had built a strong but lean frame.
- Castiel said.
"I know, I crawled out the grave."
“I don’t know…I just…I need to think,” Dean said grabbing his keys.
“You scared me so much and I didn’t think you were coming back,” Cas growled as he kissed Dean’s hips, stomach and chest.
you, Dean Winchester, I
She pulled her phone out of her coat pocket and handed it over to Cas. A photo of the pas list was on the screen. Cas scanned for his name while Dean lit a cigarette up for Bela. Once Cas found his name he swore loudly.
"I'm sorry about your mother Dean." Cas said as he reached out to take Dean’s hand, squeezing it tightly. Dean could feel a lump forming in his throat but he fought it back, there was no way he was going to cry right now.
"For being such a good friend. For being there for me. I'd be lost without you Anna." Dean said. Anna had been the one to help him get his shit together after being Jimmy became too painful. Over the past few years, she had grown from just being Jimmy's sister to being one of Dean's best friends. His rock.
"You sure?" Josie asked. "I'd make you a showrunner and everything."
Anna, Amelia, and Ruby all made it to hometown dates along with Hannah, one of Charlie's girls. If this was any other season Dean would have been there, pretty damn thrilled that three of his girls had made it to the final four. Instead, he sat in ratty sweatpants and drank Josie’s imported beer. He just had to sit there and watch as Cas and Hannah walked hand in hand around the streets of Baltimore. Cas and Ruby exploring Los Angeles and her introducing him to her skeevy looking friends. The worst by far had been Amelia and Anna’s hometown visits. Cas won over Anna’s incredibly conservative parents and siblings in Ohio, all of them claiming that Cas was just
"Rescuing the damsel in distress." Castiel said. "Charlie wasn't in a fight Mrs Winchester, some people were picking on her and I tried to stop them." He explained. “Charlie’s fine, she’s a bit shaken but apart from that she’s perfectly fine.”
“Please, it might help in waking me up,” Cas said groggily. He pulled himself up off the couch and Dean winched when he heard several bones pop. “You weren’t joking when it came to that couch. It’s a menace on the joints.” Cas declared.
“He was in town, that’s all Jimmy.” Castiel said, desperately trying to sound casual as he watched the moon’s reflection rippling on the lake. Jimmy sat down next to him with a mocking snort.
"I can...
Anna was waiting for him with coffee and bagels like always on Monday morning, though he noticed how her eyes raked over the dark circles under his eyes as he got into the car. She didn’t say anything and didn’t even try to play her morning playlist of Passion Pit and Gold & Youth because she knew how that music drove Castiel insane.
He could feel that familiar heat pooling in his stomach as Dean's hands roamed over his skin, fingers dancing across his flesh and leaving goosebumps in their wake. Tender kisses peppered his chest and Cas let out a surprised gasp when he felt teeth nipping at his hip bone, a move that Dean knew always sent Cad mind swirling. Another gasp hitched in his throat as Dean kissed along his thigh, his mouth ghosting over his erection before Dean took him in his mouth, skillful and heated. A moan of pleasure rumbled deep in his chest as Dean took him down further, freckled cheeks hollowing out.
Naomi leant over and whispered something into Balthazar's ear while Dean walked back to Cas. Cas knew what she was thinking. Dean’s technique was completely different to what Naomi knew and loved but there was no denying Dean’s talent.
“I’m here to do my job Dean. Josie might have fired me but I’m back, I am here to do my job.” Ryan said trying to square up against Dean. It didn’t work seeing as Ryan was a good few inches shorter than Dean.
“Keep an eye on each other?” Dean offered, his eyes searching Cas' face.
. Thank you.” Balthazar said before leaving the room, Naomi following him. Everyone packed up their things, the room a hum of noise.
"This is my version of bagel withholding,” Cas said with a smug smile. “There’s just you left now.”
The pair sat in comfortable silence for several minutes as they drank their wine.
“Thanks for the support, it’s nice to know my friends are so nice to me.” Jo snapped with a voice dripping in sarcasm. “You’re all assholes you know.”
“This fucking sucks ass.” Adam said looking down at the files in his hands like they were covered in pee. “Winchester you were right, the guy is an asshole.” He said with a groan. Charlie gave him a pitying look as he went to sit down at the nearest desk to work on the stack of folders.
