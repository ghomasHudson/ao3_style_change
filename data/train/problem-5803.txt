Steve paused. “...You haven’t come across anyone?”
The entire cage was falling, swallowed whole by darkness. For a few seconds, they tumbled through the dark until with a monstrous splash, they hit water.
“JARVIS, lights please,” Tony requested, landing at Rogers’s side.
“Yeah, you do,” Rogers breathed, suddenly tense again.
Steve was glad to be asleep.
“Thanks,” Romanoff shot him a quick but radiant smile before marching to the beds by the windows with Barton in tow.
The line cut out.
“Christ almighty, I’ve nearly died both times we’ve been together. After today, I’d appreciate it if you kept your distance. It’s like you’re- ” Rogers rubbed a hand over his face. “It’s like you're bad luck.”
“JARVIS, buddy, god I’ve missed you, and I love you. I’m currently… let’s call it ‘indisposed.’ Uh, can’t really throw any punches of my own, so I’m gonna need you to engage offensive maneuver 2C to take this fucker down for me. Sound like a plan?”
“Stark! Stop fighting back!” Steve yelled over the tumult of the room. “You’re too close to the edge!”
Steve, internally: OH NO HE'S HOT
A good portion of his thoughts were still hung up on the magazines piled in the rack behind him. Seeing them had irked him, and he wasn’t sure why. Maybe it was that it appeared that Tony Stark’s life was thrust under a spotlight to nearly the same degree Steve’s was although in a much less flattering light. Stark’s life might not be taught in schools like Steve’s, but by the looks of it, Steve couldn’t compare to how much Stark got flocked by paparazzi. The magazines seemed to have no shortage of images of Stark in a variety of compromising states, be it a grainy photo of his younger self sleazily dressed or his much more current self passed out in a hedge. Stark certainly got up to a lot.
“Stark?” he called out, against his better judgement to keep quiet. “Stark, where are you?”
“I said open the suit, J!” he screamed, suddenly horribly claustrophobic in the metal shell that was usually practically a second skin to him. Holy hell, his head was
“In time, we’ll let you in on our secrets, but not until you’ve served under us long enough to prove your worth to the boss. Who knows, maybe once you understand our mission, you’ll develop some loyalty,” the man hummed.
“You don’t deny it then.”
“Oh, for the love of god,” Steve groaned, snatching the remote back up and shutting off the television.
hunk of metal. Steve didn’t really own much now that most of his belongings were scattered across the country, behind glass in museums. He had tried telling himself it was an honor, but that lie hadn’t held long. He couldn’t ignore the way his skin crawled at the thought of his things, his life
Clint shook his head, impressed. Romanoff just asked, “Who shot the ship?”
Rogers.
Okay, nevermind. Apparently, Steve
“Alexei, buddy, calm down.” Tony lay a hand on his arm and gently pushed down so that Alexei let go of the steering wheel he’d been gripping. Alexei had been his driver for three months now, and, despite his skittish demeanor, he’d seriously grown on Tony. “They’re probably just coming over to make sure we’re okay or maybe apologize.”
Steve felt sick. He had to get to Stark. Had to hear the man’s voice, so gratifyingly filled with life.
get to tell me what to do. And I’m sorry the whole Captain America shtick has gone to your head and that you forget that humankind wasn’t made to do your bidding, that the world isn’t hanging on your every word.”
As repugnant as one-on-one dinner with Hammer would be, Tony could still be grateful that dreading the occasion would take his mind off that other unpleasant experience. He was a futurist afterall. Better to focus on the oncoming trouble than to bemoan past mistakes with a man who was a relic of the past himself and nauseatingly patriotic and prim and self-important and maddeningly-
“Can you put me down?” Rogers asked, eyes still shut tight and clenching the iron man armor with such ferocity that it was denting.
There was nothing but the rustling of grass for a bit longer until eventually Rogers smoothed a hand over his hair, stood up with a grunt, and walked up to Tony holding out a bloodied hand.
“You’re drunk right now,” Steve said. “Aren’t you?”
, Steve thought with a shaky smile that hurt as it pulled on his split lip. He almost laughed, delirious with the fear as the earth raced towards him.
He was reaching for the buttons when Barton shoved his arm between the closing doors and blurted, “I’ve got coupons!”
Steve slammed his shield into the face of a guard before swivelling and lobbing the shield at a gunner on the roof. Before the remaining perimeter guards could round the corner and take aim, Steve scaled the wall and hurriedly snatched his shield back up to deflect their fire. As the bullets bounced off, Steve glanced behind him into something like a courtyard. There were a few guards, okay at least eight, down there who hadn’t run out at the sounds of a scuffle in favor of defending the door. To saner people, a fairly small space enclosed on four sides and packed with men carrying guns would have little appeal. Scratch that. It would have none, no appeal. But, Steve wasn’t saner people, so rather than apprehension, it was a feeling akin to giddiness that grew in him at the sight. Mind blazing through the calculations of necessary angles and force, Steve leapt off the roof and into the courtyard’s center.
“Alright, navigate us a way out of- ”
Shit, had Tony said some of that aloud? Shit.
“Reached th’ command room. I’m on some overlook, it’s got a rail. Crazy rusty. Which door now?” Stark asked.
“Welcome back, Mr. Stark,” an unfamiliar voice crooned.
“It was hilariously easy to lure you both here, you know,” he continued, standing to smugly saunter around the room. “Just cart in some machinery, swarm the place with guards, and spread rumors that we’ve got radiation, and we got ourselves on SHIELD’s radar as a high-level threat in no time. Fill the place with complex tech, and they’ll send Ironman. Use a Hydra base, and they’ll send the Captain.” He grinned at Tony like he was expecting an impressed nod or applause or something. When Tony again didn’t respond, he went on, “Of course, not everything went to plan. We were really just supposed to get you both into the ship’s core and gas you, but I guess we hadn’t disguised our entrance well enough.”
“You don’t even like moose tracks,” Pepper grumbled.
Fuck, wind. That could only mean that the nazi bastard who had just skimmed him with what could only be described as a fucking death ray had opened the ship’s hatch and was seconds from escape. Gripping his side and gritting his teeth, Steve managed to get himself to the door onto the ship’s cargo hold. And-
But, shit, he was spent. It was only two hours ago that Steve had gotten off a mission to recover SHIELD files from a terrorist group in western Colorado. He’d been unlocking the door of his neglected apartment (it had taken him a full half hour to find the key to the place), so fucking ready to fall in to bed, when Fury had called him back to the compound. Being the mature adult he was, Steve did not burst into tears at the prospect of another day’s exertion between him and blissful unconsciousness. He allowed himself a quiet whimper and went down to climb back onto his motorcycle.
“Parachute?” Tony asked.
“Really sorry about touching it, but I didn’t want you forgetting it. But, you can punch me if you want, and holy shit, is this thing heavy,” Barton babbled.
“A terrific plan, sir,” JARVIS replied, and the suit launched forward, seizing the man by his arms and crushing him into the wall.
Climbing the stairs back into the city, Steve shrunk into his jacket as not only the chill of the night but of that reminder from Stark sunk into him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony felt the energy surge through the suit as he took aim on the nazi aircraft. From this distance, it was only a dot on the horizon. But, being Tony Stark, his systems easily zeroed in on the target and fired. The force of the blast sent him whaling backwards, and the air around him blistered with heat.
Grating his teeth, Tony snapped, “They messed with
Blue eyes…
Oh fuck. Oh fuck, oh fuck. He was falling fast, and the room he’d stepped out of the suit in was like miles of winding tunnels away. Fuck, Tony still had life left to live, people to meet and things to fix and all that. Apologies to make.
“My shield,” Rogers breathed. “Lost it. Wouldn’t have drowned if I…”
Pepper frowned. “What, why not? Chicken noodle would be perfect right now.”
“Truly a man of business, eh? Your father would be proud,” the man leered, clearly aiming to strike a nerve with Tony. When Tony gave no such response, his face darkened, and he leaned into Tony’s space. “Three years I’ve waited to have you, Stark.”
“This tunnel lets out in a half mile,” Tony said to the wall.
Rogers’s grip slipped slightly, and his face twisted with panic.
“They didn’t believe you were essential to the vision, but I’d read your papers. I’d studied your work like religion,” the man whispered, appallingly fervent. “I knew you’d be an asset unlike any other, that you’d bring forth machines capable of unfathomable devastation. With you on our side, we could purge the earth of its wretched impurities with ease. The boss said all I had to do was get him the Captain, and I could have you to myself.”
“Whoa, dick move,” Clint huffed.
“That’s still a possibility, you know.”
“Actually, I’m just picking up on a reason why now. There is another individual on board. Male and not in the ranks of known members and associates of this organization.”
“I, uh, I have no idea who you are,” Steve replied. “I’ve met a good few Brandts in my time, so you’re going to have to be more specific.”
“There’s unfinished business here,” Rogers responded, his voice controlled. “There wasn’t any radiation, but I’ve reason to believe a fair share of this facility’s recruits may be allegiant to Hydra. From here on out, you need no longer concern yourself, Mr. Stark. All I ask is that when you get aboveground, send word to SHIELD for backup. Without the threat of a nuclear explosion hanging over us anymore, we should be safe to storm this place.”
“Hey, hey! Let go ‘f me!” Stark whimpered, suddenly distressed. “No- no grabbing!”
Shit. Fuck.
“What? Since we held hands?” Pepper’s frown deepened. “But I’m always dragging you around at galas.”
Pepper pulled out her phone to place the order but paused, looking at Tony with concern in her eyes. Tony turned away and fixed his gaze on the cheesy magnets stuck on the refrigerator. He used to wake up to a new reminder tucked under one of those magnets almost everyday, even though Pepper could’ve easily asked JARVIS to relay the message. She’d known Tony liked the visible evidence that other people were around.
“Yeah,” Tony answered, momentarily thrown. He hadn’t realized Rogers wouldn’t know that.
Steve shrunk away from the door.
“I’d like it to be known that I’ve since realized not informing our guards of our plans with you and Stark was a misjudgement. You could’ve been shot, and then I wouldn’t get my fun,” the voice continued from the speakers. “But, I wanted to make their resistance as convincing as possible, and I didn’t doubt you could handle them. Mostly though, I wanted to relish in the dumb look on your face when you realized that serum had done you no good, and you’ve been outsmarted all the same. Come on now, Rogers, tell me how it feels to be bested by the oh so lowly Brandt.”
“He’s the one who suggested it, not me,” Pepper added, looking only slightly apologetic. “You know Hammer, he’ll just pester us about it every time we see each other until one of us agrees, and it wasn’t going to be me again.”
Did not intend to cut this chapter off at what could be considered a cliffhanger, but it really was the best place to split things, I swear.
“Wait. Hold on,” Stark cut into his thoughts. Steve halted his increasingly aggressive shutting of lab drawers. “This little section looks brand new. There’s… there’s a button. Imma press it.”
-Smh, Steve with hypothermia chose violence.
Tony took a second to catch his breath and clear his head that was dizzy with the prospect of a living, breathing Steve Rogers waiting in the ship above him.
He couldn’t remember what series of drunken decisions had gotten him here, and he wasn’t sure if that was because of the drunkenness or because of the pain in his head that was making all of his thoughts drag. Not just his head though, he hurt all over, and fuck was it cold.
Tony would not recommend taking on a high stakes mission while more than a little drunk.
. He needed out. He needed air. “Goddammit, open the suit! Open it now!”
“No, sir. And might I suggest waiting before taking off again to retrieve the wreckage? Your heart rhythms need a moment to settle down.”
“I’ll order dinner. The pad thai will cheer you up,” Pepper said, patting him on the back and leaving the room to make the call.
“Should I?”
It turned out that it took a whole hour and a half to fully discuss Hammer’s latest instance of mind-numbing incompetence, by the end of which both Tony and Pepper were in considerably higher spirits but starving for dinner. After finding nothing satisfactory in the fridge, they’d started rummaging through the cupboards.
Suddenly, there was a flash of shining red and silver, and two of the bastards reaching for him toppled over. Tony shoved back the remaining one and turned his head towards the yelling.
Steve was seconds from collapse. Unhappy with being chased off for a week now, sleep was pressing in on him from all sides. The tiled floor of the SHIELD compound had never looked so inviting. Fuck, he was genuinely considering laying down in the middle of the hallway and passing out. It was two am, nobody would be coming up to the briefing floor. Only anyone watching the security feed would know. He should totally do it.
“I’m not fucking joining your team,” Tony growled.
, he did not think as the words he and Steve Rogers had screamed at each other did not replay in his mind.)
He was sitting in an exact replica of his father’s old New York home office. It was identical to the room Tony had come to dread as a child, down to the scorch marks on the rug where Howard had once drunkenly stomped out a cigar and the mauve tie around the man’s neck that Howard had worn the day he’d nearly strangled Tony after hearing word of his son’s latest escapade at MIT.
owned more precious.
Really, striking up a friendship with Stark was an impossibility and a foolish thing to ever have hoped for. Stark thought being Captain America had only made Steve arrogant and rued the day they’d met. Stuff like that didn’t exactly feed well into relationships.
“Holy fuck, J! You weren’t kidding!” came a modulated voice from the metal man.
“It better be.”
That last bit, an echo of every lecture Howard had treated him to, touched a nerve with Tony, and he couldn’t stop himself from spitting back, “Yeah, golden boy, I wouldn’t expect you to know, but being drunk does that to a guy.”
After Greenland, Tony had thrown himself into making it up to Pepper for all the headaches he caused her (namely, that speech he’d ditched and press conferences he’d stumbled in late to or missed altogether). Stark Industries was Pepper’s now, but Tony was still involved. So, he’d attended board meetings, tuned in for conference calls, and schmoozed at every stuffy dinner that came his way. He’d even sent a box of bagels (the woman considered donuts to be sugary abominations) to Pepper’s office although at the last second he’d replaced the cream cheese with a strawberry-flavored brand.
“What?” Tony choked. “Come on, J. Is now really the time to pull my leg? I just shot down a plane, I’m not in the mood to be reminded of the raging crush of my childhood. Okay, and teenage years. Okay, maybe I never really was able to shake that one. Regardless, I thought I programmed you with better sensibilities than this. Or at the very least, a better sense of humor.”
Certainly scratching his wrist couldn’t be qualified as an attack, right? And, if his hand just happened to brush up against the latch on his thin metal bracelet, thereby summoning the iron man suit, that would only be by accident.
Before the curiosity killed him, Tony rose through the hole he himself had blasted into the ship.
“I warned you not to come on this mission in your miserable condition,” Rogers shot back.
“It would seem so.”
Stark wasn’t wrong.
“From before, whatever that was all about… you want to talk about it?” she asked.
Now face to face with the legend himself, Tony couldn’t help but whisper, “Holy shit…”
Half of him was still stupidly loyal to Stark while the other half wanted to believe that Stark meant nothing but trouble and that it was best that they’d cut ties. He might’ve remained split between the two if it hadn’t been for Stark’s words playing back through his mind.
Yeah, most people probably didn’t pray for a solid punch to the face to keep them awake. But Steve wasn’t most people (it’s not like a swig of coffee could do the trick), and he’d been searching through room after dusty room for anything of substance to bring back to SHIELD. Turning up a whole lot of nothing wasn’t exactly stimulating. Where the fuck did these people keep their incriminating files? Steve had no more of a clue who this group was than he had flying in. He might end up having to take someone back for interrogation.
But no, it couldn’t be Tony yelling because Tony could hardly breathe out of exhaustion. Then who-
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupted his thoughts, “it appears as though, despite our thorough research into this particular excursion of the nazi scum, the man was not sitting in the cockpit as expected, but for some reason was compelled to stand in the cargo hold, where our hit landed. He has now fallen out of the plane.”
Tony noticed the captain’s eyes catch on his helmet and remembered that it must be uncomfortable for Rogers to speak to an emotionless faceplate.
“Nope.” Tony shrugged.
Then he jumped.
“I’m- ”
“Too late. Don’t worry, JARVIS told me it’s not wired into anything big.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you’ve heard of me, I guess,” Rogers sighed. “And, before you ask, I’m sorry, but I’m not at liberty to explain how I’m… not dead and all that. You really should forget you saw me at all, Mr. Stark.”
His glare dissipating, Rogers whispered, “But, I… I saw you fall.”
Steve’s mind went blank with white hot panic, and his fists flew into an onslaught against the glass wall. The water was flooding in now, soaking him to his waist.
Steve couldn’t drink his smoothie.
Suppressing the flare of annoyance and the accompanying fifty insults he wanted to sling in Rogers’s stupid stern face, Tony simply raised an unimpressed eyebrow and replaced his helmet before firing up his boots.
“Uh, sorry, how much of that did I- ”
, he thought as he shot out of the pressing darkness of the tunnels and back into the vast openness of the tundra.
“It’s good to see you back on your feet,” Scarlet Hair told him warmly.
Tony was roused by something puncturing his left forearm. At first there was nothing except the pressure of whatever was piercing through his skin, but that only lasted a few blissful seconds before the pain of all the other injuries riddling his body came slamming into him like a semi truck. He groaned.
“I’m so sorry about that,” Steve said, blushing horribly and backing away.
Oh great. Yet another crazy fucker obsessed with acquiring the coveted brain of Tony Stark.
His breath caught in his throat. Steve Rogers. It was unmistakably Steve fucking Rogers. Tony would recognize that sharp jaw, strong nose, and bold eyes anywhere.
Shit, of course. What hot headed crackpot was Fury going to shove him into battle with now?
“I know, I know. I know I told you all that crap. But, now we’re here, and I wanna blast some baddies, Cap, let me blast some baddies,” Tony had whined.
“Thank you,” Steve took the shield from him and gave him a genuine smile of gratitude. Barton smiled back, and Steve was brave enough to think he might be forging the beginnings of some sort of human connection when his stomach gave a monstrous growl and broke the moment.
Apparently Samson hadn’t mentally prepared enough for Captain America and Ironman strolling into the room, and throughout his rundown of the mission, he was incessantly either readjusting his glasses or shuffling papers. But despite Samson’s nerves and how horribly distracting Stark’s slowly drying hair curling over his forehead was, Steve managed to grasp most of the information.
“I opened that laptop in the middle of my biggest presentation of the month,” Pepper groaned.
Tony’s mind cast back to the earlier stages of this trainwreck of a mission.
Cheeks heating, Rogers bit his lip and turned away, and Tony’s heart leapt into triple time because that was possibly the goddamn most precious thing he had ever witnessed.
Rogers waved a hand. “Fine, fine. Just glad to be on solid ground again.”
“See, this is exactly why we need a brain like yours on our team!” he exclaimed, clasping his hands together. Alright, Tony had had enough of this creep.
Fuck. No. No, no, no. That time had been a sacrifice for a mission and a worthy cause. This time, Steve had already failed his mission, but this excursion had only been a small step in a much larger operation to take down this nazi resurgence. There was still evil to be quelled and lives to be saved, damn it.
“That’s exactly why Fury’s pestering Stark to sign on to SHIELD,” Romanoff said. “He needs to be put on watch or at the very least told what not to get in the way of. Yours is not the only mission that hothead’s interfered with. He’s blown my cover on three separate occasions. The man’s a menace. Thinks his shiny suit gives him the right to blast into and blaze past anything.”
He rolled his shoulders and straightened up a bit. “Annoyed, actually. Not at you. At other things. People. A person. Shouldn’t be, though, not after they... I shouldn’t do a lot of things, but that never stops me.”
Pleased with his aim, Steve caught his beloved shield out of the air and swiftly finished off anyone still standing with a few more throws and punches. Once everyone was down for the count, Steve turned to ready himself for the next wave of guards, the western patrol Steve had snuck past during his trek through the foothills who undoubtedly had heard the shouts and gunfire by now. He had two minutes left on the clock to finish them off so that Stark could-
Um so, apparently I finished this chapter more than a mf-ing month ago.
,” Steve stopped listening in.
Knuckles rapped on the back window, and Tony raised his head.
Romanoff gave Clint a shove. “And yet, here I am still friends with you when just today you misplaced the harddrive we’d been tracking down for a week, among other complications to just that one mission.”
Tony sighed. “This time’s different.”
Falling sideways and hitting the wall hard, Steve fought to keep his eyes open against the fierce pain screaming through his body. He had a target to keep in his sights. But, his vision had gone blurry, and the wind ripping through the ship and blasting his face really wasn’t helping.
Right as Steve opened his mouth to ask just that, the distant crunch of snow under a mass of boots reached his ears along with the humming of charged air. Steve rushed to the open gates of the courtyard and stared out across the barren expanse to see Stark zipping around and haphazardly blasting the western patrol.
In his dream, he was facedown on a smooth floor. It wasn’t a particularly exciting dream, but that was more than fine to Steve.
There was a man--he had a sallow face, and his hair was buzzed close to his scalp--seated in a wooden chair immediately beside the couch. A wool coat was draped over his shoulders, and a long hideously mauve tie spilled out of his three-piece suit. He was watching Tony intently.
“Sorry! I only flew so fast because I had to counteract our momentum and- Nevermind. Are you okay?”
Clint scratched his chin. “Well, if I had my own flying armor, I’d probably ditch the stuffy interviews, too. A ride in that thing’s gotta be insane.”
Regaining his balance after the shockwaves hit him, Tony set off to make sure the ship didn’t crash into anything important. It was nothing but untamed prairie rolling for miles, but Tony figured he didn’t want the smouldering wreckage starting any wildfires. It would be easy enough to extinguish the wreck and then call in some local officials for its disposal. He might even make it back in time for that press conference Pepper had been on his tail about all week, which was good since he kind of owed her one after the fiasco at the governor’s-
“Captain America is alive.”
Whoa. Okay then.
Replacing his helmet, Tony mumbled, “That wasn’t a dream, right, J?”
Defeated, Tony fell back onto his stool.
“M‘kay, hanging up now. Bye-bye, sweetums,” Stark drawled.
“Alright, well do you remember which bed you had?”
“You’re drunk, Stark.” Rogers shook his head and jogged off without another word.
“What do you mean? You’ve flown around in the ironman suit?” Clint asked, eyes comically wide.
Steve really wished they would shut up and put his mother’s lullaby back on, so he rolled over to say so. And oh fuck, that had been a mistake. Pain erupted all over him, a burning in his legs, a pulsing ache over his ribs, and a twinge from his nose. Shit, all that pain was very much real, so he definitely wasn’t dreaming. Steve blinked around at the bizarre room he was in. It was a glass cylinder, six feet in diameter, stood upright in a cave someone had half converted into a laboratory. There wasn’t a soul in sight.
“Took too long. Got bored,” Stark replied breezily, plowing down a row of guards with a beam from his hand. The guards promptly fell to the ground, slightly twitching from the hit.
Biting down on a laugh, Tony stepped out of the elevator and started towards the kitchen where his friend’s voice had come from. With her jam-packed schedule, Pepper stopping by the tower had become increasingly rare, and Rhodey’s responsibilities to the Air Force had taken him overseas. These days, Tony’s correspondence with his friends consisted of 1am text conversations, his weekly video call with Rhodey, and whatever under the breath commentary he and Pepper shared at galas. Tony had become accustomed to the stillness of the once lively and glittering pent-house. Which was just fine because Tony was a busy man with plenty of projects to occupy his time and plenty of AC/DC to fill the silence. Still, an evening with Pepper was a welcome change.
Suddenly, the distant sounds of a struggle reached Steve’s ears. As much as his hyper sensitive hearing gave him trouble, he was glad to have it in cases like these. Hope reignited, Steve shoved past and leapt over the sparking machines until he caught sight of a passageway that the faint shouts were issuing from. And then Steve was racing through passage after passage, around bends and down stairs, following his ears until he skidded through an archway and onto the top of a wide staircase. He stared down into a scene of chaos.
“And you couldn’t have just called? You nearly totaled us,” Tony frowned.
“Tony,
He had to get to Cap because Tony wasn’t some asshole who left his mission partner behind. And because, well it was
head, so who’s to say they couldn’t mess with yours?”
As he slid into the backseat, he was already closing his eyes again, expecting a car ride spent in silence as was typical of SHIELD. Much to his dismay however, not long after reentering traffic, the agent cleared her throat.
Glaring at the grimy floor of the train car, Steve mulled over what he knew about Stark. Beyond being an absolute knockout, Stark had been the first person in a long while to show him kindness and concern, and in return Steve had hurled back insults. Steve let his head fall back against the window and peered through his eyelashes at the poster on the opposite wall. It pictured Ironman blasting through a wheel of cheese and brandishing a bowl of crackers. Besides perplexing Steve, the advertisement reminded him of what Romanoff had to say about Stark. Apparently, it wasn’t uncommon for him to, as Romanoff had said, “blast into and blaze past anything” on missions, and Steve wasn’t alone in thinking Stark could be infuriatingly flippant.
“Whoa there, kiddo. Don’t hurt yourself,” the man exclaimed. “Lay back down. You don’t have anywhere to go. We’re here to just talk.”
Steve’s face twisted as his grip slipped, and he gasped in a choked voice, “Please. Help. Can’t you- ”
“Your fault,” Rogers looked him in the eye, something like clarity coming over him.
“I remember,” Steve said, glaring at the ground.
Usually JARVIS would have given him a name and profession, maybe even a rundown on their background. Tony frowned. “Any identification?”
“STARK! Don’t you- ”
“No. I only bring it up because it’s not exactly wise to go into battle disoriented. You’d be putting the success of the mission as well as your life in danger. You really shouldn’t come.”
Horror flooding through him, Tony shot downward after the quickly receding shape of a man. After half a minute packed with maybe the most potent anxiety Tony had ever experienced, he made impact with the super soldier and hurriedly redirected their course away from careening into the dirt at over a hundred miles per hour.
His left repulsor illuminated the scene, and Tony’s heart dropped at the state of his partner. Shivering violently, Rogers was collapsed on the ground, and his lips were blue.
“How long have you given me?” Steve mumbled, crouching behind a tall rock and eying the base’s first watchtower thirty feet ahead.
Apparently annoyed that Steve wasn’t cowering in fear, Brandt spoke up again, “Here comes your nightmare, Captain, tailored perfectly for you.”
There was a strangled noise, which Tony realized must’ve come from Rogers, who was squeezing his eyes shut and doing his best to bury his face into the unyielding metal of the armor’s shoulder plate.
Flying through the hallways towards the surveillance room JARVIS was navigating him towards, Tony cringed at the memory. But, besides being another stellar example of Tony Stark’s limitless idiocy, the exchange in the valley had given Tony reason to believe that Captain America was kind of deserving of all the admiration. And Tony wouldn’t let a man as enduring and sweet as that suffer at the hands of… whoever the fuck was behind all this.
“Hydra’s not taking me anywhere,” Rogers growled. “I don’t care what robotic advancements they’ve made; I’ll tear you apart just like the rest.”
“You better get flying then,” Rogers replied.
“I- I’m sorry,” he whispered. “But we really need to- ”
But it was
“He certainly wanted to get his hands on
“We haven’t got the time to argue all day. You told me you’d let me handle the busting in,” Rogers had said.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, straightening up.
“Yes, sorry about that,” the man said, withdrawing the syringe from Tony’s arm and placing it out of view. “But, I had to wake you somehow.”
“Let’s just say neither of us had the most quintessential of childhoods. We weren’t ordinary children. My mother despised my gift and left me. My only hope was my father, but with all that time he spent away on a boat hunting for his loathed Captain, he was hardly ever around for me. You see, you robbed me of my father, too. But when it comes to methods of revenge, him and I differ. He cared about science and advancing mankind and all that bullshit grandfather had instilled in him. Me?”
Tony: *removes helmet*
“Yeah,” Rogers replied in a faint voice before jerking himself out of whatever trance he’d fallen into and turning on his heel to march off through the grass.
“Yeah, I’m fucking sure. Walked around this ice pit three times already. Maybe this rust bucket was capable of some serious devastation back in 1945, but it sure as hell isn’t doing anything now.”
Tony wasn’t afraid of the dark, but that didn’t mean he liked it. Honestly, send anyone into a pitch black maze of tunnels, and they wouldn’t fancy staying long. Of course, the suit’s night vision view was activated, and every so often he might pass by a lit sconce, as if this were some fucking dungeon. But, neither of those things made for a particularly friendly atmosphere. The good news was JARVIS had zeroed in on Rogers’s heat signature, and Tony was fast approaching.
was propped up between two heavy bookends on a shelf. Tony knew they were heavy because one of them had left a bruise on his back for two weeks.
Because flying was still unnerving for him, and apparently drunk Tony Stark wasn’t much of a conversationalist, Steve spent the flight fighting off both nausea and sleep. Ironman sat in the opposite corner of the jet, unmoving. Maybe he was asleep in there?
“Will do,” Steve huffed before launching into a sprint.
“What? You’re not saying you’re staying here, are you? What the hell would you do that for?”
Blue eyes locked on…
Steve gave him a polite nod of acknowledgement, but that only seemed to further tie his tongue.
sorry, oh my god,” his driver squeaked.
“Yeah, it sure was,” Steve mumbled, distracted by a magazine cover picturing a barely clothed Tony Stark grinning like an idiot and throwing the camera a blurred middle finger.
The regret must have been showing on his face because Romanoff cocked her head and asked, “You okay, Rogers?”
“Alright, I’ve got a block on their communications and security footage. But I can’t hold it for long or they won’t excuse it as a system malfunction,” Stark’s voice spoke through the device in Steve’s ear.
“Evening,” Steve returned.
Clint gestured at something with his straw, and Steve turned to look. A rack of magazines stood by the door, and more than half of the covers were emblazoned with the face of Tony Stark bordered by various accusations.
Steve rubbed at his eyes. He hadn’t felt this run down in his life. And that was saying a lot. Yeah, leading charge after charge in World War II had beaten him down, but he’d had Bucky and the rest of the howlies to sternly shove him into a cot or stay up with him talking about the stress and ugliness of it all. And sure, a good deal of his childhood had been plagued with draining sickness, but he’d had his mother to swaddle him in blankets, hold his hand through the coughing fits, and distract him with a recount of the day’s workplace drama. And to put him to sleep, she’d hum an old Irish melody. The notes still played through his dreams sometimes.
“Sorry, I’ll have JARVIS restock our ice cream stores. Billionaire, remember? I’ll get you all the moose tracks you could want,” Tony laughed. He eyed the strands of hair spilling out of Pepper’s bun and the pinched look on her face. “Ice cream before dinner, Miss Potts? One of those days, huh?”
In the second it took for the door guards to begin to raise their weapons and for the perimeter guards to burst through the gates behind him, Steve hurtled his shield to his left and watched as it shot around, either knocking down a guard or knocking their weapon out of their hands. God, he loved that thing. It was stupid to be so delighted by how elegantly it sliced through the air. And it was probably worrying how fond he was of what was essentially just a hunk of metal.
“Ah, ah, ah,” the man waggled a finger at him. “If I don’t want you off that couch, you can’t get off that couch. You might think there’s nothing holding you down, but all the same, it’s quite impossible for you to stand. So long as you are under my employ, Stark, you will be completely incapable of any harmful move against me.”
There were hands grabbing at Steve again, tearing at his sleeves, and seizing his arms. Steve pushed back, fighting to stay upright and keep Stark in his sights.
Rogers glowered back at him, clearly unconvinced. So, Tony removed his helmet.
Tony looked down at their intertwined hands.
No, Fury would chew him out when he found him napping “on the job”. But, the thing was, Steve was never not “on the job”. If he wasn’t punching bad guys, he was retrieving and compiling intelligence and then strategizing for the next time he went out to punch more bad guys. That wasn’t entirely Fury’s fault, though. Steve liked having something to do. If Fury didn’t provide him a mission, Steve wandered down into the recesses of the SHIELD compound to hunt through their archives for a trail he could pick up.
“Stark! Whatever happened to waiting for my signal?” Steve yelled down the line as he ran to join the fight.
“Holy shit…” it mumbled, something like awe in its voice.
-This has been a rough chapter for the boys and a tricky chapter for me to work out. Some parts will be explained later, but others might be confusing because of how I wrote it?
“Rough.” Tony grimaced before breaking into a smile. “Tell me all the stupid shit he said this time. I could use a laugh.”
“I’m warming up by the minute.” Rogers pointed to the fog of his exhale. “By the time SHIELD arrives on the scene, I’ll be good to go. I’ve had worse.”
Tony Stark was a dick, and that was that and Steve didn’t have to think about him anymore.
With substantial effort, Tony opened his eyes.
The train slowed to a stop, and Steve rubbed at his eyes. How had he spent the entire train ride bemoaning Tony Stark?
“I told you, I turned my whole apartment inside out,” a man’s voice responded. “So, unless Lucky ate it- ”
“You’ve got five minutes. Better hurry and get to fucking shit up.”
“Good.” Fury nodded goodbye and left.
At the time, Tony’s logic had been that if he just kept arguing, Rogers would eventually relent and let Tony have his fun with mowing down the base’s defenses. But Rogers's patience didn’t give, and his level gaze didn’t waver.
“This is my decision, Cap. Not yours,” Stark snapped, waving a finger at Steve. “If we’re going to be working together, here’s what you need to know: if I say I’m fine, I’m fine. End of discussion.” With that, Stark stepped into the ironman armor and the helmet shut over his flushed face.
Tony shook his head. “Far from it. Just a person wrapped up in SHIELD regulation, stuff I don’t intend to mess with.”
Fuck, oh fuck.
“That’s not true, Stark,” Rogers told him, brow furrowing. His eyes were sad as he regarded Tony then, and Tony wanted to ask him what he was so worried about. “Listen, I need to get going. Wait here in the valley. You’ll do your part once we get inside. Wait for my word.”
Yet, all thoughts of the mission that had been consuming his attention just seconds before had fallen away at the sight of the staggering drop two feet away from where Steve stood pressed up against the wall and dragging in sharp breaths.
“Speaking of first meetings, I should’ve let your plane crash that day,” Tony said, taking ample pleasure in the way Rogers’s jaw clenched. “Or better yet, I should’ve shot it again to make sure you stayed dead this time.”
“Stark, are you sure?” Steve asked. Stark was drunk. People weren’t exactly at their most observant in that state.
“Was in the middle of finally apprehending the guy when the ship we were on gets blasted out of the sky. Ironman caught me before I hit the ground, though, so I guess I got a bit of a ride.”
“Stark, I think you should wait before going in. Assess possible- ”
Tony peered through the glass, scanning the woman outside’s uniform. Sure enough, there was the SHIELD emblem sewn over her shoulder. Most likely the real deal, then. What the hell could they possibly want?
“Okay,” Pepper said, standing. “So, it’s a no to the chicken noodle soup. We can just order takeout. How’s Thai food sound?”
Clint rolled his eyes. “Tasha, anyone who causes so much as a wrinkle in your operations automatically lands themself a spot on your blacklist.”
Tony shot upright, the events of the mission rushing back to him: the iced over core, the secret entrance, the low-ceilinged room stockpiled with tech, stepping out of his suit to more freely rummage through the circuitry, the ambush of guards, the chase through the passages, the cavern where they’d closed in on him, fighting on the cliff, and the horror on Rogers’s face when he’d jumped. Sitting up so fast had been a bad move, and Tony winced when his muscles screamed in protest.
“There’s a lift in here. Looks newer. Where do you think it’ll take me?”
Stark stared back blankly for a few seconds, the words apparently taking a moment to register, before finally raising an eyebrow. “And that concern would be what exactly?”
“You love strawberries.”
“I don’t- ”
“And who is this lovely gentleman you’ve found?” JARVIS asked with that same what-in-god’s-name-have-you-managed-to-get-yourself-into-without-me-around-to-supervise air.
your skillset. Lives are at stake, sir. Are you going to ignore that and crawl under your covers?” she snapped.
He left his sentence hanging, waiting for a name. Shaking his hand and laughing nervously, Tony supplied him, “Tony Stark. And it’s no problem at all, Captain Rogers. It’s more of an honor than anything. If that’s not insensitive to say, I mean. I don’t want to imply that I took any pleasure in your peril. Really, I was scared shitless when you dropped, so really this whole experience has given me enough anxiety to last me half the year more than it’s given me any enjoyment. This has been terrible. Except for saving you, I’m happy about that. I’m sorry, I’m not making much sense. I tend to ramble when I’m high on adrenaline. Also, you’re Captain America, that’s kind of throwing me for a loop here.”
“Yes sir,” Steve said in sync with Stark’s somewhat slurred (Was he drunk? Oh, he might be. Steve could smell the alcohol through the cologne now.) “Yeah, okay.”
Yeah. Tony’s eyes were on the future, and Rogers was in the past and of no concern of Tony’s. The man had said so himself. Tony didn’t need to wonder whether Rogers still had that tightness around his eyes, like he was battling against a kind of exhaustion Tony wasn’t sure he could comprehend but all the same felt familiar. There was no reason for Tony to still worry over the half-second long but unforgettable look of astonishment on Rogers’s face every time Tony gave him a smile. Tony shouldn’t be wondering if Rogers’s hands had healed and if they needed holding.
“I should get going,” Rogers announced once he finished expertly wrapping up his side. “Like you said, this thing’s going to start stinging, and I’d like some heavy duty drugs to help me cope. It’s been a pleasure, Mr. Stark, and thank you again. I was lucky you were in the area.”
“JARVIS?” Tony breathed. “Give me his vitals, JARVIS.”
“Fuck!” Tony cursed. “JARVIS, deploy auxiliary mechanisms T27 through 38!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“For real?" The man's voice exploded in volume. Shushing intermixed with a slight giggle from the woman. "Everyone’s been talking about him, but I haven’t seen the guy once.”
No, he was being ridiculous. The suit’s systems must’ve been fried by the long distance blast from earlier because Steve Rogers alive was just- just impossible. His brain must still be sluggish and gullible from waking up so early. What else could explain the tightening anticipation in his chest as if he was going to fly up to find anything other than smoldering metal or at the very best a Steve Rogers look-alike?
Rogers let his hand fall from where it was pushing through his wet hair, and he reciprocated the murderous glare Tony was sending his way.
Steve watched as bullets bounced off his shield and lodged into the men around him. There were no fatal hits, but they still crumpled to the ground gripping an arm or thigh. Steve still had no idea what this operation was guilty of, if anything. He’d rather not anyone get shot. So, he charged the huddle of guards who were firing, redirecting the bullets upwards into empty air, and tackled them to the ground, making sure to snap their guns in two.
“Yeah well, maybe I’ve had enough of chicken noodle soup being so perfect,” Tony snapped. “I mean, it’s all gone to chicken noodle soup’s head, really. Thinks that just because they’re a classic meal and so adored by the American people that they’re entitled to boss everyone around. Just because they’ve been around for so long, it doesn’t mean they automatically know everything about everyone and who’s like their father or not. And I’d thought that chicken noodle soup sure was great, and god, wouldn’t it be something to be more like them. But nope, they’re just a pompous prick who can’t bear to be talked back to and won’t ever- ”
“I’ve got you, don’t worry. I’ve got you,” Tony assured the other man.
“His pulse is weak, but he’s alive,” JARVIS assured him. “He might be suffering from hypothermia. Although, with his enhanced bodily systems, I can’t discern to what degree it will affect him. I say we play it safe and get him someplace warm, sir.”
“Oh, I’m delighted you finally caught on,” the man responded. He flicked the mauve tie at Tony’s face with a bony finger, and Tony couldn’t help but flinch away. A smile stretched across the man’s face at that. “It’s freaky, right? Good to know we got our money’s worth. I’d say you’re quite thoroughly disturbed, and this is only a gentle testrun. Yes, this will work magnificently well on the others.”
“Sounds mouth-watering.”
A siren wailed in the distance, but all Steve heard was the scream of his best friend as he plummeted off the train and into the ravine. The lid of a dumpster clanged shut, but all Steve heard was an explosion reaching his ears as he shoved his way through the underbrush, too late to warn his men that their camp had been discovered. Music blared from a window, but all Steve heard were the jazzy tunes they must’ve played at the Stork Club if Steve could have kept his promise.
“My hands, Stark,” Rogers said, thrusting them in Tony’s face. “You think I smashed them to bits on a nonexistent wall?”
“No elevator music, that’s lame.”
The water crept up to and over his chest, and the cold sunk deep into his lungs. All he could do was beat his fists against the glass. He could only punch and scream and punch and-
“Evening, Captain Rogers,” she said in greeting even though it was the middle of the night.
He would’ve hovered there gawking for the next half hour if he hadn’t registered with a jolt the way every last fiber of Rogers’s body was tense and those blue eyes spread wide in fear.
“You alright there?” Tony asked.
Steve needed to focus. He was making his way over the craggy foothills of the mountains, and slipping would probably hurt. Stark was reluctantly waiting in the valley behind him for Steve’s word (After a heated argument, Stark had sourly agreed that he shouldn’t be firing the suit’s repulsors when he was still quite drunk). Once Steve reached the base’s west side and cleared it of guards, Stark would fly in, and they’d enter together. The guards had to be taken out quickly and quietly, which was why SHIELD had asked for Steve. A full-frontal attack on the place would have risked the weapon being set off right then and there.
"Captain Rogers and I," Tony interrupted, "ran into some trouble in Africa. When we went out of touch, Bruce—"
The lab buildings were unremarkable, screened from the local road by trees, but far more extensive than Tony had expected.
"... gnome. Leastways, I can't think of nothin' else it coulda been...
He had just added cream to his coffee when he saw Jan making her way back through the cabin. She paused to lean over and check on Hank, whose face was buried in the pillow, then Lieutenant Storm, who was sleeping with his head flung back and his mouth open, before speaking a few words to Natasha, who jumped to her feet with every appearance of enthusiasm and made her way through the door into the cockpit.
Sleeping in the comfort of Tony's private plane was almost too easy.
"So she definitely knew Hawkeye's real name. And Natasha's – Pepper originally knew her as Natalie Rushman... or did she? I'm beginning to wonder. Natasha might have told Pepper her real name, as might Coulson, but there would have to have been a good reason.  Coulson hardly told me anything, and SHIELD was trying to control both me and the armour from the beginning. But I can't see either of them having any reason to mention Hawkeye, let alone his real name. I was careful not to do so. Jarvis? I don't suppose by any chance you still have a recording of Steve's conversation with Pepper to confirm that exact wording?"
"You have not seen what I have seen. Why do you think I needed T'Challa not only biddable but deprived of his ability to speak to the Panther God?" Hunter asked. He drove the point of the syringe into his arm. "How long before it takes effect?"
"An odd one, but it seems efficient enough."
"Why?"
Tony's eyes flew to Barton, who grimaced. Natasha was frowning. Hank looked worried.
"I'm going..." Steve turned away, his shoulders slumping, his voice unexpectedly bitter. "I should have known you wouldn't understand."
There was movement in the mists, but what was causing it was never clear. Angry and frustrated, Steve let go of Xavier's hand, and tumbled down into the mists, seeking whatever was hidden there...
"Well, you own it, I guess, whatever Howard said about me."
There was a small, affectionate smile as on Steve's face as he absently rubbed Tony's thigh. "Maybe he was one of those people who can't tell other people how they feel about them. I suspect he never shut up about you to his friends and colleagues."
"My contacts are better," Natasha said. "And SHIELD might help, particularly since Thor saved the east coast from hurricane Sandro."
"According to Jarvis, it did. If I hadn't been – if Nat hadn't listened – if you hadn't been so damn reckless– I was on the other side of the continent and I nearly lost you!"
"I'm not sure I should be hearing this," Storm said.
"What again?" Though Steve knew.
Once in the bathroom, Steve tried to locate Jarvis's speaker, failed, and said, plaintively, "Jarvis?"
"But Tony was."
And it wasn't. Steve wasn't flirting with Pepper. In fact, Steve didn't flirt with anyone, didn't even flirt back at Tony, the way Bruce did very occasionally, that Rhodey sometimes did....
Okoye smiled at him. "Let us find out."
It made no sense. Maybe if he wasn't so tired...
"She is a truly courageous woman," Shuri said. Then, still suspiciously, "How do you know my brothers?"
"And aren't you ... er... supposed to be at a board meeting in ..." Bruce looked at his watch. "Forty-five minutes."
Then Jan burst out of the dust cloud, running from whatever lay within it. She jinked to avoid Steve, then swerved around Tony before disappearing through the door to Hank's lab.
"His war record should have told them that."
"It appeared to explode," Tony said, his mind only half on the conversation.
"Drowning, Captain."
Jan stepped back for a moment to scan the words floating in the air. "Panther God?"
Steve's eyes went a little wider, not at the sight of the bald man but at the flame-haired girl standing beside him and the tall young man in the thick sunglasses glaring protectively at them both. Both aroused emotions of respect and fear.
"Well, not so much, obviously," Tony said, his voice muffled by the contortions needed to don the suit while sitting in a car, "but it should be adequate for a guy in a cab."
"Took off after them. At a dead run."
"Well, at least I'm not dead and as for fucking, get on with it, will you."
Tony flinched.
Incredible had been right. It had been Hank's experimental particles that had shrunk the giant Chitauri machine to something they could load into the back of a helicopter. And his lab at Culver had been ransacked only hours after he and Jan had moved their equipment to a Stark facility.
"Yeah. Me too."
And, unexpectedly, that dismissal was what hurt most.
"Natasha and Clint?" Steve nodded towards the ambulance. "Minor injuries. I found them trying to disarm a bomb while holding off a series of attacks. We got out just in time."
By the time they reached the hospital, Tony's vision had begun to return, in that blobs were floating over the blackness. He pointed this out – loudly – to Bruce, but it didn't stop the other man threatening to call out the Hulk – or wait for Steve – if Tony didn't take off the helmet and come with him.
"I don't blame you," Steve said, with his best reassuring smile. "But that portal confirms that you were kidnapped by or at the request of Hunter's allies. I intend to deliver you to King T'Challa and let him explain everything to you. Meanwhile..." He opened his comm. "Colonel, go really high, head for New York, but maintain stealth mode and radio silence. Oh, and watch out for airliners and drones."
"Yeah. Then second left. We'll just go on to my apartment. I'll have to let you into the parking lot. Tony can bail out there and, if the cab's still with us, take the driver into custody."
"Hi, Natasha," Tony said. "Haven't you heard of Pacific Daylight Time? It may be... what?... six-twenty am in New York but it's three-twenty here."
"Yes, I did," Tony said. "And I'll still be very angry unless you promise me you won't do that ever again."
"Yeah, well, someone's brother stole my watch," he said, glancing towards T'Challa in the hope of seeing a reaction, but the man's face was still hidden from view. "So sorta lost track of time, and other things."
"What about the cockpit crew?"
Tony sighed, but opened his eyes. "We're really doing this now?"
"That's the one sure way to make sure it's pirated all over the world, and a future tactic for when we've made our money and improved it so much the competition will be forever playing catch-up. Also
It was a vast relief to admit the truth. "No, I don't even remember my name."
"Right and justice and international law," Tony retorted. "And I was invited in." He carefully neglected to mention by whom. "Right now I'm trying to save your lives and stave off an international incident. So put down your fucking weapons because you would be outnumbered and outgunned even if I weren't here. Put them down, fuck it, if you don't want to die, because otherwise I can't save you."
"Why should you think that? They have insurance. Actually, I may buy the place. They wouldn't normally allow us back, but I have a fondness for the penthouse suites. Good memories," he added, with a theatrical leer.
"Does Fury know you have that?" Steve asked.
They looked at him with identical expressions of apprehension touched with guilt.
Tony shrugged.
Gotcha.
"I did. The first night when SHIELD had too much on its plate to keep track of something so big and inert that no one was likely to make off with it. Or believed that there were any nerves to fry. I don't think anyone's going to get anything much out of the Chitauri tech except us—"
When he pointed this out to Clint, the response was bitter: "You really don't like us, do you, Stark?"
Tony dismissed both of them from his mind and poured on the power. Oddly, though he wasn't in the least scared of his next objective, he was increasingly nervous.
It had woken at his touch.
"Well, Tony did find you. And he likes you. A lot."
"I tell you I don't need—"
Only it hadn't, not really.
"Not since that last message where he said he was going looking for Thor."
Inwardly, Steve winced. Challenging Tony to snark never ended well.
While their attention was on her – though one mercenary at least was still watching the tunnel entrance – Steve picked up the rock he had selected from the rubble that had been dumped into the ruins of the planting, and then leaped upwards, onto the top of one of the shipping containers, then on to the next.
"You became Iron Man at sixteen?" Despite this confirming what Howard had said, it was still difficult to believe.
Her sharp honey-brown eyes assessed him but she did not comment.
He managed to stop himself smiling at the quip. "So how much has Fury been paying you for your information? Though now I come to think of it, you've played Government advocate at every turn, so they've probably been paying you too."
The woman he had rescued was on her feet beside the closed gates, looking quite commendably composed.
"Oh, Tony," she said, without turning, "what
But it was the girl who strode over to where Suit-and-Sunglasses lay bound and unconscious. For a moment Steve thought she was going to shoot him and so, apparently, did Storm, who said, "Hey, Princess, he's valuable—"
There was another sound now, faintly familiar, on the edge of his consciousness, a fluttering, like none of the noises that had echoed through the helmet in the past... how many hours?
"How to do that – to do everything you like – for you."
"I don't know," Tony admitted.
There was no point at which their lives really touched, no shared experiences or points of reference.
Though he wasn't sure that, "I'll have that drink now," was actually meant as a statement of surrender.
"That wasn't the Hulk." Tony found he was saying it in chorus with Jan, who suddenly appeared perched elegantly on the arm of one of the overstuffed sofas. Instantly, Natasha had a gun in her hand, and Clint was wielding a commando knife.
"Jarvis, there are nine people in the lobby with guns, together with five times as many of my employees, and an unknown number of visitors who may or may not be clients. If I went in wearing the suit, how many innocents would be alive afterwards?"
But suddenly it wasn't Steve standing there, arms folded on his chest; it was Captain America, with a half smile on his lips, and determination on his face. "Give Director Fury my compliments on his ingenuity, and on your loyalty," he said.
"Or in," Tony corrected him. "There's someone out there with a device that can create teleportation portals. Something more like the Stargate than a Star Trek transporter."
But Tony had recognised it and was turning back. "Can you pinpoint the source?"
N'kendi lowered the nearest window, stuck his head out of it and spoke to the warriors in a language that Tony did not understand. Then he said something in the same language to the driver and the doors of the SUV slid open. "They need to check over the vehicle," he continued, in English. "We will enter the palace compound on foot. There is breakfast waiting for you."
"That's what we aim to do."
This was interrupted by a shout of surprise and rage. As he came to his knees, Tony saw that one of the gunmen was twisting in circles, trying to dislodge Jan, who, clad in nothing but her dignity, was riding his shoulders, her naked legs wrapped about his neck, her fingers locked in his hair, dragging his head backward until his neck seemed stretched out of shape.
"It's a helluva comfortable bed. And you don't have to share it. I'm not gonna push. You can have the floor or one of the sofas if you really want to rough it. It's your choice. Really. What do you want to do?"
"No," Steve said, "but I occasionally had to deal with Generals who weren't much brighter."
"Indeed I do, sir."
"Shut up, Tony, or I'll leave you to rust in the middle of the lot."
The one thing he couldn't tell him.
transporter – you know
Before, he had been dreaming, content, if not thinking was contentment – but now he knew he was not alone. Recognition followed.
Steve wandered round the room, unable to settle, as Tony called room service, then pressed the control that set screens sliding across the dining alcove, so the work could go ahead out of their sight.
But of course he had to pull the goddamn family card.
“It’s not going to be you. That’s not happening. It’s going to be me.” Steve gazed right back with a determined look in his eye.
“That is true. I do love you.” Steve smiled softly.
. So he called Steve and agreed to do it.
“Tony, please don’t make this harder than it has to be.” Steve sighed in frustration and ran a hand through his hair like he usually did when he was stressed.
Steve knows he deserved it. He didn't disagree with anything said. He was a terrible person. He left Tony alone for so long when he had promised he wouldn't. He didn't deserve Tony's forgiveness.
. A way to get people back, undo the Snap. Steve jumped on the opportunity. He rushed to Tony.
Yet it hadn't been. They brought Tony inside and he snapped. Mostly at Steve. Saying that he hated Steve. Steve left him all alone. Tony had needed Steve, and Steve hadn't been there.
“I told you it was going to be me.” Steve snapped back.
“I don't really know. I think you’ll have to do it again.” That earned a laugh from Steve. He shook his head fondly.
“Like shit.” Tony answered with a humorless laugh. The air was filled with an awkward silence after that. Neither knowing what to say.
No one would.
Steve knows Tony drank himself to the point of passing out every night. He wishes he had called and prevented that. He wishes he had apologized. He wishes he hadn't fucked up so bad.
what Steve was thinking that qualified as “wrong”.
Steve was a self-sacrificing dumbass and that needed to stop. Tony wanted him to think for himself for once. Just
One question was in his mind and it wouldn't go away.
“The Accords. Siberia.” And there it was. The Steve Rogers Guilt coming back to make the situation even harder than it already was.
The kind of guilt that feels like a constant weight in your chest. It's the constant having a hard time breathing. It makes you hate yourself to the
The guilt continues to the point of finding Bucky and finding out that Bucky killed Howard and Maria Stark. Steve knew it wasn't Bucky's fault. He was brainwashed and used by Hydra. But that didn't exactly matter. It still happened. And Tony didn't know. And Steve didn't tell him. A stupid decision. He knows that. He knows the way Tony found out was possibly the worst way to and he regrets it. He feels guilty for keeping that from Tony for so long.
He lost the Avengers, his family, and Tony, the love of his life, in one day. And it's all his fault.
The hug lasted a lot longer than a normal friendly hug should. Tony was not going complaining though. It was actually giving him hope. Maybe he had a chance. Maybe the feelings were mutual. He hoped to god they were.
Now he’d have to fight Thanos without his other half...
Everything else was hell to learn because Steve was Steve. He liked to hide his feelings, bottle them up. He liked to be a stubborn asshole. He liked to not get close with people because of the fear of losing them like he had all his buddies from the 40’s. He liked to be cold and off putting. More fears of getting close with people.
The guilt starts at the point of Steve keeping his feelings hidden from the world. He knows he should've said something, should've acted on his feelings. He knows, he knows, he knows. He knows because Natasha had told him plenty of times that Tony felt the same. He knows because there were signs that Tony gave that said he felt the same. Steve had just been too stupid. Too
“Tell my family I love them.” He turned to run to the edge of the cliff, but Steve grabbed his ankle and yanked him to the ground.
Tony ended up slamming his arc reactor into Steve's hand while hissing ‘
“Why don't you show me just how cute I am?” Tony licked his lips teasingly.
“Thank you.”
He also feels guilty for what happened after Tony found out. The choosing Bucky over Tony. The fighting. The almost killing. The leaving Tony behind. The not speaking to Tony for two years.
“Like what?” Tony was glaring at Steve now with arms crossed over his chest. “You literally are the reason we won World War 2. You’ve saved the world plenty of times as an Avenger. What have you done wrong?”
“Now that right there is bullshit, Capsicle. You’re going to jump off the cliff because you feel like it’s the right thing to do and that is the
No matter how much you talk to someone about it. No matter how much you try and lie to yourself and say that you're over what happened and that you accept it. It won't be true, and it will never go away. It will always be there to haunt you day and night. To make you feel like an awful person. To drag you deeper into the dark hole of depression.
“NO!” Tony screamed as he tried to grab at empty air as if that would do anything. A sob cut through his body and tears streamed down his face as he watched Steve hit the ground followed with a sickening thud.
More sobs plowed through his body as he clutched the dumb, orange stone in his hand.
many things that went wrong with them. And most of those things are his fault. At least that's what he believes. You can try to tell him otherwise. That it wasn't all on
. Funny because that's what he said about lying to Tony about his parents for so long. Clearly he didn't know right from wrong anymore.
“Yeah well with the position we are in right now it looks like it's going to be me anyway.”
reason. We
It's the thing that eats away at you for days, weeks, years. It makes you feel worthless because you didn't do enough or because you messed up and didn't fix things. It makes you
The worst part of his guilt is the time heist. Yes, the other things were a big and bad part, but the time heist was the largest and worst. Easily. Everyday Steve lives with the fact that he asked Tony to help them. He brought Tony into this. It's his fault. He knows it.
He didn’t look back before jumping and god he hated himself for it because as soon as he jumped, something wrapped around his waist and suddenly he was attached to the wall and Steve was right next to him.
“Make me.” Tony grinned his usual Tony Stark grin. Steve wore a grin that matched and took this as his moment to press another kiss to Tony’s lips.
know that.”
“How do you suppose I do that?” Steve ran a thumb across Tony’s cheek.
He had a plan; one that involved a living Steve. It went something like this: make Steve thing that he can be the one who is going to die. Then shove Steve to the ground and fucking haul your ass to the edge of the cliff. Then say sorry before jumping and trading your soul for the damned soul stone.
The door opened slowly, revealing
“Tell them yourself.” He got up just as Tony hit the ground and took off. Tony cursed under his breath before pulling out one of his gauntlets. He fired at the ground near Steve’s feet which caused the blond to jump out of the way, but he lost his footing and tumbled to the ground with a yelp.
Take Steve Rogers as an example for major guilt. You mention Tony Stark's name, and he shuts down. The guilt consumes him. Granted it's always there, but if you

“How are you feeling?” Steve asked, genuine concern easily detected in his voice.
Then there is major guilt.
Then sprinkle the guilt of the Accords on there. He should've just signed the papers. He really should've. It would've saved them a lot of pain and fighting. It would've saved the Avengers as a team. But he was stubborn. He was dumb. He thought that he was
Tony had essentially told him to fuck off. He had a family. He didn't want to get involved with the superhero gig again. He was done.
Steve shook his head. “But I hurt you. A lot.”
“I have a feeling that we mean two completely different people.” Tony gazed at Steve with a slight frown in his brow.
“It's okay.” He said barely above a whisper.
close. So close that Steve’s breath was fanning across Tony’s face. It made his lips tingle. He just wanted to feel Steve’s lips on his. They looked so soft and wonderful.

. It makes you wish that you could go back and fix it all. In a similar manner to minor guilt, but the feeling is more extreme. It's more drowning and drowning and drowning. It's more unbearable.
Steve seemed to relax.
“It’s not heroic bullshit-” He tried to say, but Tony was not having it.
“I know.” Tony felt tears of his own form in his eyes. This was all he had wanted for two years. Just the two of them together again.
it, it always gets worse.
. He can wish all he wants, and nothing will change. He can't change the past. Sadly, he knows that. All he can do is thank the gods for Peter Parker. That kid is the reason Tony stopped drinking. He's the reason that Tony was happy and actually enjoyed life most of the time. And Steve loves the kid for that. He really does.
. That’s what Tony wanted.
Minor guilt hurts. It hurts a lot. It makes you wish you could go back and change things. It makes you hate yourself to an extent because you didn't do the right thing and it cost you.
Steve had wasted no time rushing to him and hugging him. He remembers feeling terrible when Tony said ‘
Steve shifted from foot to foot from his spot by the door. He opened his mouth and then closed it again. It looked as though he was trying to find the right thing to say.
. “Nononono. Shit,
Before he could think more about the terrible situation a small knock sounded from behind the closed door. Tony let out a small sigh before calling out, “Come in.”
It had taken a while to break through all of that, but Tony finally did and he learned a lot about the supersoldier. He noticed things that the others noticed, and he also noticed things that the others
“No, Tony, it's not okay. I fucked up. Like a lot. I hurt you so much and I'm so sorry for that.” Tony finally looked into Steve’s eyes and that's when he noticed the tears in them.
Tony was sitting on the bed in the infirmary. The doctor had just finished bandaging up his side and left him alone to rest for a few hours because he apparently needed it. He didn't plan on sleeping though, so he settled for staring blankly at the wall.
Plain and simple: it makes you suffer. It holds you in its clutches and there is rarely a way to get out.
“Steve, I
“I’m not the one doing that. You are with your heroic bullshit.”
Before he could get any words out Steve was speaking again. “You’re cute when you blush.” Tony’s blush darkened, but a cocky smile lay on his lips.
“You have a family. They need you. Morgan needs you.”
Steve took a step into the room and shut the door. “Um...hey.” He sounded nervous. He also looked nervous.
“Sorry, Cap.” Tony called and sprinted to the edge.
of it.
Guilt always wins. And that won't change.
Also, there was the part about Steve being extremely attractive. That made it hard not to observe him. It was hard to just ignore all that muscle and pretty blond hair and mesmerizing blue eyes. It was
“Steve, don’t you fucking dare.” His grip was slipping.
Major guilt hurts. It hurts so much. Way more than minor guilt. It's the kind that feels like a constant weight in your chest. It's the constant having a hard time breathing. It makes you hate yourself to the
And it cost them. Half the universe to be exact. With a simple snap of a finger.
There's a longer story behind Steve's guilt than there is behind Peter's. Steve's guilt is rooted from many different things that went on between Tony and him. Not just one. There are
.” Tears filled his eyes as he realized that his plan didn’t work and Steve was going to
But the guilt continues on. Yes, Peter was there and that's great, but Steve still wasn't and that's why they lost against Thanos. The Avengers weren't together. Steve and Tony weren't together. They only win together, and that's a known fact. Loki was defeated because they were together. Ultron was defeated because they were together. Thanos wasn't defeated because they weren't together.
That conversation didn't go well.
After a few more minutes he finally found that thing to say. It wasn't what Tony was excepting. “I'm sorry.” Guilt was evident in his voice. “For everything.” Tony couldn't help the way his heart felt lighter with that apology.
When Steve pulled away, Tony frowned a tad bit. He missed the warmth already and just wanted to be held forever. He knew that wouldn't happen though so he just kept his mouth shut.
This kiss was longer and more meaningful. It was a kiss two people shared when they were helplessly in love.
“And I told you I wasn’t letting that happen. It’s your fault for believing me when I said that I’d let you do it.”
And all of that is major guilt.
And Tony was gone. Or at least he was until Carol Danvers appeared and found him.
A chorus of “no’s” left Tony’s mouth. It’s all he could manage to say at that point.
.” His hand was slipping more and more with each second and panic was rising more and more with each second. “No, Steve, no, please.”
Guilt.
Then we enter the two years of not speaking to Tony. So much guilt is there because of it. Steve knows he should've been there for Tony. Tony lost the Avengers too. Tony had no one. At least Steve had Natasha and Bucky.
It was a delicate kiss. It wasn't rushed or anything, just them getting a feel for each other. It was adorable in every way and Tony was mentally freaking out. Never in a million years did he think this would happen, but he was so glad it did. He was
Tony latched onto Steve’s wrist that had been wrapping whatever the hell around his waist.
Take Peter Parker as an example for minor guilt. He didn't stop the robber, and it cost him Ben's life. He lives with that guilt. He wishes he could change what happened. But he can't and he knows that. All he can do is sit and feel guilty for the rest of his life. He does just that, but it's only minor. He feels the real guilt on Ben's death date and when he's having a bad day, but for the most part he's gotten used to it. It doesn't drown him as much. He's doing okay with it.
He knew
But Tony was Tony. And he cared about Peter Parker too much to not take part in the

“Fine. Do it.” He opened his eyes and looked at that wonderful face one last time.
when they had been a team.
.’ It was true. They all lost. But they lost together. And that was at least something.
did he sound so calm?
Tony pulled that card
“Luckily I love you too.” Tony’s fingers found their way into Steve’s blond locks. “I like the beard by the way. It makes you look hotter.” Steve snickered.
He hadn't really gotten a chance to see who was still alive since his wound had needed immediate attention.
If he had known how it would end, he would've never told Tony. He would've let him live his life with his
It's the kind that you can never get used to.
They both pulled away with large grins on their faces. A light pink blush found its way into Steve’s face. “Did you like that?” He asked sweetly. Tony smiled mischievously.
“You fucking asshole.” Tony bit out while trying to tighten his grip on Steve.
“I hate you.”
There was one slight problem with ending the hug besides Tony missing the warmth. Their faces were close,
. I know it’s not what you want, but come on, it can’t be you. We both know that. You have too much left for you. You need to live your life. I’ve done that already.” Steve pressed his forehead against Tony’s. “Please.” Tony squeezed his eyes shut and sunk his teeth into his bottom lip.
Tony almost died right there and then. He looked so different. His hair was longer and slicked back. He had a beard that made him look really attractive...Tony wanted to smack himself. He shouldn't be thinking that. They hadn't spoken in two years and they weren't even
But where the hell was the Soul Stone?
"I was not trying to kill my—"
The first thing that struck Steve was how young Storm looked, though he was older by a couple of years than Steve himself had been when he joined the army. The woman at his side was even younger, probably no more than eighteen – just a girl, really – but she moved with the instinctive balance of a dancer or a fighter: not a soldier but a warrior.
Hill's dark eyes fixed on his face. "But that's not why Fury asked me to talk to you. That's more about these... space-dragons—"
Unexpected hope lit Pepper's face. ""Tony, just listen: I was only trying to protect you—"
"Army brat, remember? Research scientist on a top secret project. Yes, Tony, I know how to keep a secret."
The seemed to be confirmed when Hunter suddenly appeared, the mercenary leader at his back. He said something to T'Challa in Wakandan, and T'Challa roused himself to reply angrily.
Steve heard Tony's intake of breath, felt it against his back. "That came out wrong," he said quickly. "I don't regret you... I can't... but today I stood beside Peggy's grave, and realised everyone I knew was gone. I hoped you'd help me forget the grief. I didn't realise you'd drive everything except you out of my head."
"Are you threatening me, Stark?" Fury sounded curious rather than angry.
if anyone else tries," Tony reassured him. "The damages I demand are going to be enormous. They may fund the Avengers for the next ten years. Okay, Jarvis, let's have the rest of it."
"What an interesting tradition," Tony drawled. "Want to try it out, Cap?"
"Well, yes. Rushman asked to be put through on the secure line, because it was urgent that she speak to you, and if anyone knew how to contact you, it would be Potts. I said that if Potts knew, she wasn't talking to me. Rushman said Potts might talk to her. . I put her through , but, apparently, Potts didn't know how to contact you either."
"That's the American way," Tony said.
"She— Okay, I guess I understand why she did that, but then it's her job to be concerned with the SI Board and the stock market and to make money. I have a wider concern: I want clean energy available to everyone in the world. God knows, there's enough profit involved from the Electronics division and Repulsor Technology division for her."
What he had just overheard changed everything.
One or two of the agents gave him very suspicious looks indeed at that statement; they probably spoke Italian, and had much the same attitude to magic as Tony did himself. Or they had believed the WSC's propaganda about that nuke.
"And I know that the same fucking murderous bastards are still in charge."
There was a pattern to Tony's actions that Steve had come to recognise. To Pepper Potts, who loved Tony but, Steve was beginning to suspect, loved her work and the company as much – he hoped, for Tony's sake, that it was not more – Tony had gifted the company itself, or rather, the thing she most wanted, which was the power to run it as it needed to be run.
"But then I wouldn't have been in time at the mine. They were about to leave, with some vibranium, at least, leaving the portal generator hidden. They can't get back here right now, but as to where they've gone and who's behind this, we need to question your prisoners. They're our only lead."
"Dad knows about it. He's supporting me." Tony hoped he didn't sound as defensive as he felt. Rhodey's moral sense could cut in at the most inconvenient times. He supposed it came from having a father in the military and a mother who was a lawyer. Or maybe being made to go to church. "But it wouldn't be the first time you disapproved of my actions and I turned out to be right."
The reactor was glowing steadily now, and the suit's eye-slits were bright with power. Steve wished he could see Tony's eyes behind them, to judge if he was telling the complete truth.
"Asgard? It really exists? What's it like?"
While Steve and Lori watered the horses and stowed the fresh supplies in the refrigerator and freezer, Rhodey pulled Tony aside. "Tones, what is going on?"
Then Thor and Sif were galloping along the Bifrost and Steve's horse was galloping with them. Steve gripped the front of the saddle, wrapped his legs as far as they would go underneath the grey's belly and attempted to find his balance.
Jan and Betty were both quiet. He suspected that they might well be thinking the same things.
"Yes. Possibly even back in time to when Doom first arrived. But here's the thing, Tony, Doom or the Doombot wasn't after you or your armour or even Steve, but some sort of magical thing or person—
"I know all about Buck Rogers," Steve said quietly. "But I'm amazed you've even heard of him. And my Bucky... played at being him when he was a kid. Nickname came as much from that as from Buchanan."
With all his security activated behind him, Tony felt a rush of relieved tension as the computer displays came to life and the bots trundled out to greet him.
"Fucking bows and arrows, yet. Where the hell is Hawkeye when you need him?" Tony complained.
"I didn't have any; I was sure he was dead," Tony said. "You caught me at a weak moment – I was ready to clutch at any straw."
"Pepper, he's my best friend. I won't let anything happen to him."
The thought that Tony or Natasha might be coming through the door stayed Steve's hand, but all the same he dropped into a fighting stance.
"I was. But I have an emergency which one will get you twenty is tied in to your current problem. I had to borrow this civilian jet to get to you, so clear me for a goddam runway right now. If Storm is still on base, grab him and hold him, together with whoever came with him and lock the whole bunch away until I can sort it out."
Iron Man was flying high – high enough, Tony hoped, to avoid attention from the ground, though he had, on this particular occasion, filed the appropriate flight plans. Of course, he hadn't mentioned that Iron Man was, in this case, the centre of a swarm. The transporter pods clustered about him, protected by his new stealth technology. Most of them contained equipment eventually destined for Stark Special Projects in Seattle where, no doubt, the staff were still frantically working on preparations for their arrival.
"Then just ask," Tony said. "You're intriguing me. Com'on, Steve, give."
Tony said, "My witness. You have each other, I have Captain Rogers."
Steve had never been more grateful for the gift of his super-soldier reflexes than when threading the Harley through Manhattan midday traffic through the one-way maze leading into the Holland Tunnel.
Clothes had been laid out on a chair next to the bed; white boxers, a soft blue button-down shirt, grey chinos and black sneakers and socks. To his astonishment, they all fitted perfectly.
"I would not say no to meat and ale," Thor admitted. "Your hospitality would be most welcome, but I have to find Jane."
"Not even if I knew."
"You waited specifically to say this to me," Tony said, in revelation. "Because you're taking the same risk."
Until now.
"I'm picking something up now," Hank intoned, from the rear seat. "Think it must be communications traffic from their ship."
Tony gave a gasp that was half surprise, half pain. Steve pulled his hands away as if burned, but Tony hung on tightly.
Just.
Steve shook his head. "Tony ordered Jarvis to revoke his privileges."
"Ah." Bruce's lady, Betty Ross, worked at Culver. "Don't you find it suspicious that suddenly you're the only Avenger available and then Fury calls
He reached down for his own cock, but Steve's hand was already there.
As they disembarked from the limo in the private garage under the Tower, Jarvis said, "Welcome back, sir. You have a visitor."
After a raid on a particular cupboard in the kitchen, a search of the closets that Tony usually left entirely to the cleaning staff produced a thick quilt – possibly an antique – which he carried back into the living room and tossed over Steve's shoulders, then slid down to the floor beside him.
"The only thing I'm accusing you of is telling SHIELD too damn much. What about my tech? What have you handed over?"
"Yep, though I hadn't installed the latest version. And I'm hoping it was one of the things Rhodey kept quiet about."
The air had the dry feel of air conditioning, which convinced Tony that the computers were somewhere close.
The brush of his shoulder and the warmth of his breath forced Tony to clasp his hands around his knees and think desperately of Pepper – but that took his thoughts into dark areas he did not want to visit. Damn it, he'd gone through this with Rhodey so long ago and come out the other side – and that was a place he did not want to visit either, thank you very much.
"Madam President," Iron Man greeted her.
"But how come we're here – in Stark Tower – presumably at the aftermath of the Battle of New York—?" Natasha asked.
Talking slightly louder than he would normally have done in order to mask her words if, by chance, it did, Tony said, "I'm showing an associate around a research facility in which he has some investment." Even if it was an emotional rather than a financial one. "And, Colonel Rhodes, I have to tell you that this is not making a good impression." He made a desperate attempt to avoid Steve's eyes, but could not escape his inappropriate grin. It fuelled the anger he was already feeling.
As a distraction, he turned to look at Tony who was still, after over four hours on the road, driving with verve and precision. It was pure pleasure to watch his competent hands on the wheel, the concentration of his eyes on the road.
"Tony," Steve interposed, without force, but there was a note in his voice that blocked the other man's flow of words. "Not Rhodes, then, and Bruce is fine, so..." He suddenly looked alarmed. "Is something wrong with Pepper?
As Tony rolled away he heard the 'thwok' of a bowstring and the crackle of high voltage electricity, whether from the arrow or the Widow's Bite he wasn't sure. Just behind that came the unmistakable sound of a gun, probably silenced, because he couldn't locate the source, but the target was immediately obvious by the thud of a falling body and a call from Nat to Clint in a language he didn't know.
"Then trust me," said Natasha. "It's not Sharon's fault, Steve. The psychiatrists said that you were on the edge of a breakdown, that you needed something to anchor you to the present, a link to the past. There wasn't anyone. Except Sharon."
"No, sir. SHIELD were apparently satisfied on their access of the dummy database. They do not appear to harbour any suspicions that it is not what it seems. "
"Mine?"
"And you," Steve went on, in a whisper, "you saved us both just by being Tony Stark."
And now it was Tony – Iron Man – riding the missile into the Tesseract vortex, falling helpless through the sky, lying on the ground, the ARC reactor black and silent, his face still and pale.
"Jan," the woman herself said, "has to go see Betty and explain what's happened to Bruce. And she would prefer that Tony went with her, because he is closer to Bruce than she is."
"Gotcha." The aircraft shuddered as Danvers applied air braking.
"It's part of the Seattle complex," Pepper told him absently. "Well, he'd better be back in time for the charity gala. I'd better go look in his wardrobe and make sure he has a clean and decent tux."
that flashed like metal and buzzed like insects and that ... that were flying
"Hey, you saying that I'm not loved by the NRA?" Tony protested. "I would have thought they'd adore me for being a living embodiment of the Second Amendment. I'm going to send back my membership card."
Tony thought. What he said was, "Sorry, Nick, I have more important work."
The noise of engines startled not just him, but the entire team.
"He can't be happy about that."
Steve's modified bike. Tony bit back an angry comment: Steve would not have objected. "But how did you know—?" His eyes went to Jan. "Traitor."
"Unless you want to be formal, and then it's Princess Shuri."
"Ha! I had reasons." Jan said, but now she was keeping her fists to herself.
"That's okay." Tony grinning widely. "Right now I'd forgive you even if it had been Pepper. Who I'm not dating, by the way. If you want to cut in, it's Happy who you should worry about. He packs a mean punch nowadays."
"Not sure about your security," Tony replied. "Not after what happened tonight."
"And you're going to marry Stark?" Hawkeye asked, his voice dripping with scepticism.
"My plane, my rules," Tony said cheerfully, grinning as he sashayed across the cabin to where the case containing his armour was strapped to the wall on its own custom fixings. Unfortunately, the plane chose that moment to hit a stretch of broken concrete and lurch.
"Don't get too—"
It took time, but he managed to reach the far side without a ducking. Thankfully, he scrambled clear of the water and into the scree accumulated downstream of the landslip.
"Wait and see."
"SHIELD agents have moral standards? Well, Coulson did, of course, but he's dead, isn't he? Fury certainly isn't above using sex—"
"Long story," Rhodey said. His attention having been brought to Steve, he was eyeing him with some suspicion. "You are?"
"Do you think they're after you?" Jan asked.
Tony smiled his most winning smile at Julia, wriggled an eyebrow, and said, "Let me in?"
"You've given me exactly what I needed," Steve said. "That... that we can do this without fear of arrest almost makes this century worthwhile."
"Okay, Iron Man, go get them. I'll handle below," Steve ordered as he pulled a tiny but powerful flashlight from one of the pouches of his utility belt.
"On speed dial. But it goes straight to voicemail."
The weight on his back was resolving itself into a warm person, maybe human, probably female to judge by what were almost certainly breasts squashed against his back, and his nose brought him the scent of leather and a familiar perfume.
Pepper's admonition against facial hair had suddenly made him more determined. A Van Dyke, maybe. Unlike a goatee, that had a moustache and would therefore annoy Pepper. It would still be different from his father and more dashing.
Tony snorted.
"We've got rivals?"
Then her expression of shock and suspicion vanished in a friendly smile. "Captain America. Jarvis told me you'd left the building and Tony had gone to find you. Was there trouble?"
