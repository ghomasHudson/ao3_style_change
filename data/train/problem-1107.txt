“Not at all. I haven’t got anything better.” There was a buzz and John pulled out his mobile. “Jesus. Harry’s left me twelve messages and now Mike’s texted on her behalf.”
“Don’t. Don’t start with me right now. I have absolutely zero patience left for this…” He couldn’t find the word he wanted, so John just gestured at the leather he’d removed so far. “How far before we can pull over?”

I've seen Victor Trevor referenced in several fics before now, but now that I've read the original case involving him (not sure if that's the only one he's in, haven't read all the ACD stuff. Not remotely. I've read maybe a handful) I'm sort of curious about his image in fic thus far. Hm. Maybe we'll see my take on the character a bit more in future chapters.
The walk across the glen to the apparition of his brother was slow as Sherlock stepped carefully on the dew-laden grass and moss, his arm supporting John. The army doctor was set and determined, he leaned on Sherlock for help but not nearly as much as the detective thought he should.
“Do you find you’re feeling a bit put off, working this case with me?” Sherlock asked, regarding her.
They stopped in a nearby coffee shop for him to read and mark bits, while John looked up anything he could online. He found nothing, unsurprisingly for the boonies out here. He was lucky to get data at all.
John leaned forward and tapped a finger to the plastic. “You’re telling me to leave Baker Street. Is that really what this is?”
John glanced at the clock. It was 7:45am. “Yeah alright.” He threw off the sheets and stretched, testing his leg. It was sore, but not as bad as he’d expected. “Where are you going?”
Tilting her head, still dusted with the vague remembrance of her smile, Cennerous but a hand on John’s shoulder. “Why then, Heira, are you here?”
Mrs Hudson winked. “You don’t live with Sherlock Holmes for any amount of time without learning to notice a few things.”
It hardly mattered just now, the important bit was the danger. “Moriarty will be viciously pursuing us for the foreseeable future.” He offered somewhat blankly.
Bluebell accepted her teacup with an amused smile as Mrs Hudson put out the tea and a few things to snack on. The older woman didn’t look like much, but she wasn’t at all put off by her eccentric tenant. In fact, she’d watched him go with matronly affection on her face. Then she turned and clapped again.
Sherlock watched him, panic in his heartbeat but stern resolve in his face. A part in the backdrop of his mind noted John was unlikely to pick up on even that simple a tell. “You made it very clear.” He said seriously; a reminder.
“Yeah?” John crossed his arms and put his weight on his good leg. “Why’s that?” When, after a moment of silence, it was clear there’d be no answer, John’s frown deepened. “I have to. Bluebell can’t drink any longer, she needs a fluids IV drip. I can’t kludge one, I need to go fetch it.” He studied Sherlock carefully, but there was nothing he could pick up on. “Unless you can give me some valid reason I can’t, I’m going to get one as soon as I’m able.”
“Stay here!” John was already jogging as he rushed out of the house and down towards the gate. God, something was wrong… As adrenaline pumped through him, he struggled to push down the instinct to shift into his faster and stronger body. He hadn’t even heard Sherlock in the crashing din of voices, but he knew, just knew, he was there.
“Oh.” Sherlock stood all at once and stepped on and over the coffee table to sit opposite John. “No, this is Bluebell, but not.”
John sighed. Telling a story like this, instead of typing it out one letter at a time, was intimidating. But most of the others shared stories.
“But he didn’t ask me anything.” Kirsty pointed out, frowning at him as she bit into her apple. “He’s here to find my rabbit, isn’t he?”
One sickeningly choppy ferry ride later, John slumped into his airline seat and wondered what the procedure was if a passenger refused to get up when they landed. He could sleep for a week.
“You did say you’d be up all night.” She replied with a warm smile. “Should I bring yours and Mr Holmes’ meals as well, or will you be dining with us?”
As predicted, the feather finally fell to earth and rested still around dusk. John hadn’t seen any fae during that part of their trek.
And with that, John rolled over so his face was in the hay and thought about the time when he'd once again wake up in Baker St.
John watched, transfixed, as with that simple phrase the creature seemed to dissipate. In it’s place was a little ball of black light with eyes like fireflies. It seemed to blink, and then it floated off into the woods like a wisp of fire.
“I feel…” Bluebell interrupted, sounding like death trying to be pleasant, “my current vocalizations are pretty indicative of this scene…” she barely got the sentence out before retching again. Punctuating her point.
“There wasn’t time, they’re too slow.” Sherlock huffed as John cut away the fabric around his wounded shoulder. “Careful.” He hissed as John cleaned the gashes. They weren’t too deep, wouldn’t need stitches at least.
“Not exactly, at least not in the traditional sense. They wouldn’t kill me. I’d just be recaged. You and Captain Watson ruffled more than a few feathers, so I think they’ll be busy enough to leave me alone. They might think I’m dead. I was supposed to be. But I was lucky. See, none of the other Shifters Dr Stapleton worked with had her daughter’s name.”
Again, Bluebell had no reason to trust that he was telling her… anything, really. But she felt in her gut he was, and something very important at that. “Alright then. ‘Redbeard’. I’ll keep it to myself.”
John frowned deeply. She had a solid point. “Is there someone we can call?” He’d finished his assessment of her physical state, now he was looking for a way to get off the device around her neck.
John sipped his tea, lips thinning. “Don’t bother. I’ve tried. You can’t get it from him, or keep him getting any. He’s yet to damage anything but cutlery and the toaster oven.”
John opened his eyes to see his detective was right in his bloody face. “What?” He huffed, still not remotely calmed down.
Sherlock has taken on a normal case from Lestrade while he works on the Ritual. John comes along but can't leave the beach house. Bluebell gets uppity. Papa Lestrade is tired, but that's not news.
Turning to say goodbye, John answered the look with a frown of his own. “What? Have something to say?”
“Sherlock…” Mrs Hudson sighed. She was obviously worried, but she didn’t push. He allowed her to move his hand out of the way and opened it up to the last two thirds of pages. Here were older photos, a few sun-bleached business cards, and an old preserved feather. “I made some friends overseas.” She explained shortly. Bluebell felt out of the loop after the knowing nod from Sherlock. “One of them, who was close to my husband, was into some very weird things. He’s usually jumping around too much to find, but he was always fond of me.” Her words were honeyed by the sort of nostalgia Bluebell was too young to understand. It was unclear what sort of ‘fondness’ she was speaking of. “I could always reach out easily when I needed a favor.” She took out one of the cards and pressed it into Sherlock’s hand. “I have a feeling whatever political nonsense is keeping your brother from telling you things is exactly the sort of thing he can help you uncover.” She hesitated, but pulled the feather out as well. “You’ll need to show him this, he won’t recognise you otherwise.”
against the tile. “Take the week, Doctor Watson. Say your goodbyes. Gather what sparse possessions that hold meaning for you. Look over this file.” He tapped it with, of course, his damned umbrella. “Then I will have a car collect you.”
“Yeah. We’re nearly there. It’s not your last stop, not yet. But I wanted to see you beforehand. I won’t be around for a few weeks.”
There was one clearly inhuman footprint in the mud of the pond, though mostly ruined by intruding police investigators, that if he could place could be the last piece he needed.
“It has come to my attention, and I feel you’d agree, that as of late… my brother has been slightly more… requiring of care.” Mycroft began finally.
The only other floor was the top, where the light was. It was a directional lamp, so though the space in the light’s path was clear, the rest of the wide room was well furnished; a cushy yet moderately sized bed surrounded by thick curtains, drawn back until he had use of them, a similarly styled wardrobe. Apparently the snooty twit fancied himself an artist, because there were plenty of supplies for painting. All unused.
“Hm. You give me far too much credit, it seems. It would appear we have quite a pest problem. More than, I admit, even I was previously aware. Likely the crew were standing by as soon as the base here began researching something very different than their reports would lead you to ascertain.”
John’s entire body throbbed as he ducked and rolled, covering his face. He could feel his jumper burning but the flames hadn’t found flesh for the most part. He crawled away from the heat and dark smoke, and a hand grasped his, pulling. It was soft and dry, something wasn’t right…
He suspected that's why the old proprietor’s body still lay on its front in the dirt of his exhibit. In the last week, it had begun to stink enough that John had stopped shifting at night for warmth. Any attempt on his part to bury or move it had
Flinching as a handful of fingers touched his cheek, Sherlock was shaken from his reverie and opened his eyes. God, he looked… concerned.
John grabbed Sherlock’s wrists to stop him, he wasn’t listening. This was ridiculous… “I’m a bloody doctor, I can handle it. I have some bruised ribs. I’ll be half blue up one side for a few weeks. I didn’t see what happened too well, he hit you too.”
“You can see, he can’t exactly take on cases at the moment.” John said calmly to the DI over a cuppa.
Bluebell turned back to Sherlock with a swivel of her stool, her posture still and closed again. “Now. I know you well enough to assume you’ve come for a reason, and not just to harass me.”
But Mrs Hudson didn’t seem to miss a beat at all as she led Strel back to her flat, much more careful about being too familiar with her, talking about what they could see on telly around this time.
Sherlock flicked the climax of his song off with a defined flourish, the last two notes dipping then coming sharply up before they were cut off by a steady hand. He smiled at John, who was groggy enough with his meds and sleeplessness and a full belly that he clapped. “Fantastic.”
“Right.” John cleared his throat. “Lead us to where the spell we need starts.” Then he tipped his hand so the little black feather dropped out of his palm. At first, it drifted down like a regular feather, but then the wind kicked up. John couldn’t see anything controlling the breeze, but he started forwards after it. You could easily brush off the feather’s path as just caught in the wind, though it took a distinct path through the trees.
“Thanks.” Faas’ voice portrayed a sad smile. “I have a sibling, too. Younger brother. We’re a Shifter family, so it was easier on us. We knew the rules going in.
I hope this somewhat makes up for yesterday's very short chapter. I now have 20 chapters planned. I do not promise I'll update daily, I will just write as I can and post when it's ready.
Now she knew she had his attention, the older woman smiled warmly at Bluebell and pulled her gently into her kitchen. “Now, dear, you look as if you haven’t eaten in days. You’re not like Sherlock, I can tell. He seems to think he can sustain himself on the air alone.” She joked lightly, sitting Bluebell at the table while she put on the tea and got out a dish of bread and jam.
John watched, and Sherlock blinked. “Yeah. That’s what it’s like.” He stood and took two steps closer, so he was looking down and Sherlock tilted his head back to look him in the eye. “Who am I to anyone who doesn’t know me?” Sherlock gave him a look. “Humor me.”
I’d rather not.”  Sherlock shot back as he sped up to leave his out-of-shape babysitter behind and catch up with the two people carrying John’s gurney.
Instead of trying to talk again, he nudged against Sherlock’s ribs on their next step and motioned his head towards the little group in front of them by a hundred or so yards.
The door clicked, catching John’s wary attention, and opened. A plain-ish brunette (still quite nice, John thought) made up to look taller than she was (John sympathised) walked in, followed closely by two men in suits. They were made up to look as anonymous as possible.
“Well.” Andrea tucked her phone away and gave John her vacant smile. If he was an outsider and had to guess, he’d never say she looked as if she’d seen him before. Just as that began to irk him, Andrea swept out the door, and her familiar gave him a polite little wave.
Having a gun in his hand, waiting for the signal to move, John felt real again. Grounded. His leg was still on the mend, of course, but he’d gotten a brace to leave him use of both hands. It was cumbersome, and not as helpful as his cane, but when doing a raid he had to prioritize.
She would sit at his feet, reading something on John’s laptop in a language Sherlock didn’t know, likely from the look of it something close to Spanish or at least from South America. Given her shift, if it had anything to do with her heritage, it made sense. He also noted though she could speak it, she could not read or write in English.
As it was, John was content to watch the performance and follow along. A ridiculous performance it was, too. They pulled up right to the front doors as if they owned the damn place and as Sherlock got out of the car, he took a deep breath and raised his arms as if gesturing to the entire house.

“John!” The familiar, lyrical voice rang out as it's owner's bobbing white hair came out of the crowd. After a second’s hesitation, John opened his arms, and a huge smile preceded a tight, full hug.
“Hello again.” John greeted, moving his weight more onto his cane. He'd found he liked the wooden one, and kept it.
Bluebell sipped her tea and nodded, impressed. Hidden in plain sight, it seemed. “So what is it actually?”
Only a half-tick of surprise before the same sideways grin that her son possessed rose on her lips, and she took the hand firmly in hers. “Least I could do.” She answered. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Shall we?” Finally looking at Sherlock, with curiosity, she added, “We parked very close but we should be quick about it.”
The butler didn't have time to scream as the creature descended upon him, taking all of him in its maw.
Sherlock followed and stood in the bathroom doorway, leaning on the frame and crossing his arms. “You should sleep in my bed.”
“Not forever.” She tried to push off the ground with her powerful legs, the assailant was already off balance from bending awkwardly, due to her height. “Just until I can fucking tell what it
“Have you ever seen anyone seek out a photo album if they didn’t think it was about them?” Mrs Hudson tsked.
Baskerville had been stripped, in the few hours they’d been gone. The tire tracks around the yard told him intimately how the equipment had come and gone, large heavy trucks, cement mixers, two semis as well. He read the ground like a school-child’s book as his heart pumped his head, pounded in it. John was already inspecting the fence at the front, a simple chain and lock on it now, even the motors that opened the gate at the guard post were gone.
In John’s case, he was human again and starkers. They were threatening him with their cattle prods and a set of chains too big for the Warrah. They kept shouting at him to do something, he couldn’t understand… more Shifter terms he’d never learned. At least they’d finally given in and fed him something reasonable before the transfer here, though he was still nearly skeletal now. He didn’t let them back him into a corner, standing his ground. They’d learned he had combat training, though, and they’d looped a catch pole around his neck before unlocking the cage. They weren’t currently using it, thus it hung loosely. As a reminder, John could guess, that he was not in control here.
As John and Sherlock settled into what would be their day aboard a train, neither spoke of the confusion at the end of the day before... though both had it on their mind.
“Harry! That’s enough! You said all this already, before I shipped off for god’s sake, why do you think I never call?! I’ve had more than enough of your self righteous bullshit! Why don’t you sort yourself out before coming after me, hm?”
I apologise for this oversight and any harm it may have caused. I will endeavour to improve in the future.
I sort of feel like that amount of information about wolves wouldn’t be something Sherlock would think to ‘keep’ in his head, but it didn’t fit in the story to tell you he researched it after seeing John’s first shift. He knows a ton about wolves now because he had to identify the particular kind John is, and it’s extinct.
He gave the CO a nod, and the striker tossed in a smoke grenade. They couldn’t use a traditional flashbang because of how sensitive Shifters’ senses were. It could permanently injure them.
“Consultant.” He muttered, looking around and determining he needed to get inside for anything relevant. He sidestepped Lestrade.
The worst part of any of it was how amusing it was to apparently everyone else. Including, somehow, both Mike and Lestrade. The former had come over at the behest of Harry Watson, to be sure her ‘brother with a death wish’ was actually in once piece. He still hadn’t returned her calls or texts, which he explained to Mike was her being overprotective of her new adopted daughter while he assured him Estrelle was as fine as he was. He’d have to take John on his word at that, because Strel didn’t seem at all fond of Mike. She hissed at him and hid behind Sherlock, holding his hand in both of hers. When Sherlock had looked over to John for help, both the other men just laughed.
“Christ…” John swore under his breath, moving in and putting his hands to Sherlock’s face. People had stopped throwing things, but the shouting continued. “Sherlock.” John spoke clearly, tugging minutely at the defined cheekbones. “Look at me.” It was like his detective was completely zoned out, but now he blinked and lowered his chin a bit.
“You sure as hell think you can, that’s what you’ve been doing your whole life! Playing soldier and now running around with your
“You’re not taking this seriously at all.” Sherlock accused, sinking his neck further down in his scarf, and not due to any chill.
“Hm.” John finished his assessment and, deciding their captive wasn’t in any medical danger, turned to the Shifter. “Sorry. In the odd circumstances I forgot to introduce myself. Doctor John Watson. And the other man is my partner, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Yeah. Rhetorical.” John looked over the article, which was about the recently found body of a man about his age, found in a field out in the English countryside… he couldn’t fathom why Harry wanted him to see this, it wasn’t even an overly special case. Sherlock certainly wouldn’t take it. Cause of death was massive physical trauma to most of his body, obviously dumped there by a truck… identified as a boy who-
“No. I’d just say ‘change the subject’. I’m actually thinking about it.” John laid his head back down and stared at the roof. The painkillers were starting to wear off and his stitches were starting to throb.
Staying silent, Sherlock watched almost as carefully and many times as accurately. They stood there at least a full moment before the tension was broken by a single word.
John looked up, first at his friend’s determined, cold face… then to the thing sticking to the wall directly above their heads. It flicked out an overlarge tongue, a spit of fire flickering only a second around it's lips.
“Very well,” the older man sighed, “I will spell it out for you. To be blunt, these,” he pushed the file towards John, who made no move towards it, “are everything you’ll need to relocate to a therianthrope community in America.”
“Tell me.” He goaded, eyes narrowing with interest. He didn’t miss the tick of a grin pull at John’s face before it was smoothed down in the serious nature of their discussion.
The paw in her hand shook harder and moved, bones beneath skin. The agitated though weak cries of a rabbit changed as her body did into wails of pain.
Moran finished clapping with a last resolute smack… and took the mic out. He turned in one motion, his back to them, and addressed the audience.
Sherlock’s lips thinned and he pulled his arm back out of her reach. “Mrs. Hudson.” He said, a few notes lower than usual. “You were saying about a lead?”
of his weight, among other things. He even had on bracers that could be linked together like handcuffs.
Sherlock’s features scrunched and his body shook. John sprung up, by the time he’d crossed to the sofa Sherlock was already half his normal size and still shrinking. He held back his voice, his jaw locked even as it transformed.
Mrs Hudson let Sherlock go, out of sight and back up the stairs, then turned to take Bluebell’s hand again. “My, you certainly have a silver tongue. Best keep that for folk your own age.” She joked.
Out on the road, after about ten minutes of driving at high speeds, Sherlock pulled over into a disused drive. He turned to John and took off his shades.
“Sorry I didn’t visit you since the hospital, mate. I didn’t know you’d been released until today.” The DI chuckled, slapping John on the back and withdrawing.
Bluebell was barely conscious, humming under her breath… she didn’t look right, even for someone going through severe withdrawal. “What were you doing?” He asked, using his Captain’s tone. He took out his pocket torch and checked her pupils.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock growled, not fast enough in his shock to stop them strapping him down to the stretcher and the helicopter started up again. “Where is John!” He yelled over the deafening hum of the blades above him, pushing whatever of his dark curls weren’t matted to him with dried blood.
John looked at Sherlock as if he’d forgotten he was there. “Sherlock, come here.” He said suddenly, moving to meet him halfway.
“Seven. Fine. Of those seven, only one knew what they were doing. Or at least, weren’t mucking about randomly. The rest of the room is gibberish and things made to
“Fine.” Sherlock huffed, pulling off his gloves. He’d been killing time, mostly. He’d gotten what he could already.
John’s eyes went to the doorway, though his attention never left the boy on the bed. The real Faas stood there, wearing an expression of worry and anger John had never remotely seen on him. He walked into the room, giving his brother a wide berth.
“Obviously…” Sherlock huffed, putting the rabbit down on his chair and tugging his sleeves back down to cover his cast, “because I can’t see them, and you can’t go running all over the planet until you weigh more than a hundred pounds.”
He sighed. They needed to come out. He'd much rather use the proper tools, but given the situation, he'd have to improvise.
“Still managed to get an entire crew in here, all within a few hours.” The thing pinning his legs lifted out of the mud and off him by a few inches, and he decided he definitely would have full use of them again. Now he could feel the cramping and pain, less than expected actually, and the absence of anything broken (in his legs at least) was fortuitous.
John chortled a bit, his head shaking against the backrest. “Well I'm glad for it. Even after we finish this case, who'd want to date a werewolf? Other than vapid fan girls who wouldn't know a real one from a silly romance novel.”
John snorted despite himself. “No kidding.” He said under his breath as the roar of an approaching engine took his attention toward the sky.
“John.” Mycroft said a little less smugly after a moment. “Regardless what you might think, I do not have a personal, private jet. Last you made such a request, that was not
Mycroft looked from John to Sherlock and back, huffy as ever. “I suppose it’s no use to ask you to trust me.”
Sherlock stood again, the docile rabbit resting in the hinge of his cast, and came within a foot of John’s legs to gaze down at him. “Enjoy holding an animal?”
This was Mads’ seventh story, and each one was completely contradictory. Strel added something now and again, but she kept quiet for the most part.
“Of course, though I realize you wanted to spare your husband the pain of knowing what his first-born was capable of, that hardly justifies striking him in lieu of reporting it.” John added to the sickly woman in whose bedroom they all stood. She had indeed sucked the blood of her infant son… but it was to remove poison from the wound. Of course that had rendered the woman quite ill. “Luckily, the concentration in your system isn’t enough to kill you. You’ll recover in a few weeks.”
I've plotted out twenty chapters for the next part of this story, Part Two. Twenty seems to have worked here and for the arc of the next bit, it seems like a good bet. Reminder that chapter lengths will be varied in the extreme. Unlikely there will be another 5 part chapter though. Many characters will be recurring! Please let me know in the comments which (other than John and Sherlock, obviously) you liked best, and I'll include more from them in Part Two!
Driving further and further away from the city lights was somewhat soothing, and somewhat terrifying. The darkening prairies around them seemed to stretch on forever with nothing, just nothing, as far as the curvature of the earth would allow. The roads were smooth enough when they started off, but as the sun dipped below the flat dirt and grass, they turned off the highway onto gravel. Dust kicked up terribly, the scent of earth nearly painful in the noses of every person in the dirty SUV. Nothing behind them was at all visible.
Everything was in full swing when they got there, and maybe it was a mercy John was seen as a pet, because he was led around the back instead of entering in the front with Sherlock. And seeing as he’d apparently proven the day before he behaved himself, there wasn’t much in the way of security around him after he was put in a small sitting room and told to wait. He’d been instructed ‘his kind’ wouldn’t be allowed in until the second half of the party, when the Madame’s new acquisition was presented. Then he and any others would be ushered in. John hoped fervently no other Shifters would come, because it would be hard enough getting one out with planning, let alone someone unexpected with new circumstances.
“I was shot straight through, from the back. When the round entered it was cleaner, and it takes a lot of force to get through everything in its way. So it sort of takes bits of whoever it hits with it when it comes out the other side.” John was not used to teaching, and he wasn't sure any of this was appropriate… but he also felt he should be honest with them when he could. He would almost certainly have to lie about something crucial later.
John didn’t allow himself to snap his attention away from the handlers, but they all turned to look at the young Shifter who’d shed in his cage. There wasn’t much room, as the kennel was meant for the forest cat, so Faas knelt.
“Estrelle, this is Mrs Hudson. Mrs Hudson, this is Candace Estrelle. She’s my niece. My sister and Clara adopted her.”
At least playing catch up was normal, as far as John’s part in cases was concerned. He’d had to stop the lanky bugger before he dashed out of the bathroom, starkers and soaked.
Oh and if anyone was curious, Sherlock got John's gun on the plane with Air Marshall credentials. It actually helped that it was a military issue handgun.
John smirked and tossed Sherlock’s coat at him. “There’s something for you in the pocket.” He said offhand, going to the case and getting out his own clothes. “I’m having a shower. This entire thing has made me feel gross.”
Bluebell stifled a giggle, but instantly regretted it… Sherlock had been staring, but now he tried to steel his face. The faintest rose tint could be seen in his cheeks, though.
“They’re traditionalists.” Sherlock, who was leaned against the door and had looked as if he were sleeping, spoke clearly without moving. “Anything against the norm is in danger of being met with hostility.”
Compared to the nine odd hours from Baker Street to the continent the week previous, a three hour flight to the tiny island of Grimsey in Iceland was nothing. Even if the silence pervaded until they walked out into the cool sea air.
No more words were spoken, glass of water and pills given, glass collected. Easing John back and pulling covers up. Walking out, hesitating half a tick, pulling the door shut after himself.
Then Sherlock emerged, back to himself sans the coat, which was hanging by the door. He walked right past John and pushed a button John had missed, close to the bottom of the door, with his foot. Then he joined John on the bench and put one leg over the other.
Why was his vision already blurring? It wasn’t as if he’d never been stabbed before… but this… was the blade laced with something? Because as his blood continued to take the warmth out of him, a terrible acidic burn spreading from the wound inwards, like a very, very slow burst of lightning as it struck in erratic lines of heightening agony.
“Why would I care anymore, it’s basically random.” John answered as he poured himself a cup, downing it without regards to temperature.
Passing the wood down even as John slipped lower, John tried to grab for Sherlock’s other arm, but missed. They had a good grip on each other, but with only one arm each. “I can’t, use the cane!”
“Y-no, no, Sherlock just…” He huffed. All that genius and he couldn’t understand. So many things, though, so many that John couldn’t say because to Sherlock the work came first and nothing came after it. This was home now; with Sherlock, running through London or the moors or wherever else there was something interesting going on… but it had been Sherlock’s home much longer, and it was his gate to keep. He took a deep breath and pressed his face into his hand, the cool air pushing into the small hallway making him feel just a bit better. “Sherlock.” He shouldn’t have said the name first, that made it harder. “I worry that you won’t take me
“John.” She greeted warmly, her tone changing again once addressing him and not Sherlock. “Glad you’re still in one piece, more or less.”
“I think I’d be upset if I didn’t get to at least try these.” John said as he popped something he couldn’t identify into his mouth. It was salty and tender, and he reached for another.
As Moran’s look began to drift into the territory of staring, a ripple of power surged through the auditorium. John’s skin crawled from the hardwood beneath his feet to the crown of his head. Moran’s attention turned back toward the audience in alarm.
“Sherlock!” John gripped hard onto Sherlock’s upper arms and wrenched him sideways, away from the wall. Just as a burst of very real flame shot down upon them.
“And… you need an in with the Shifter community, since you’ve never touched on it before and there are no obvious doorways to them. You’re not using the Captain-”
“You could…” John replied slowly, waking Sherlock to the fact it had only been a second or two in real time, outside his head. John ran his tongue over his lips thoughtfully, still not overly perturbed. That could be for a myriad of reasons… “But,” John locked eyes and concentrated fully on Sherlock. The devoted attention made the detective shudder. “Are you?”
“Yes, Mr Holmes…” Bluebell sighed, irritated. “Really, you’re very dramatic. Do you need to spell everything out?”
Sherlock bowed again, snapped at John to follow, and went through the house to the front. Without the discerning eye of Steward on the house, no one looked twice at John exiting with him instead of around the side.
The hatch opened, flooding the place with light that made John, and everyone else with hands, put one up to guard their eyes. Boots clicked as they came down, shutting the hatch after and making everything seem that much darker. John turned to face out but didn’t stand. He sat up straight as his eyes adjusted to reveal the grinning figure in front of him.
“Tsk tsk…” the villain turned his hand to waggle a finger at them. “Do I have to start counting? Let go of your pet and step back. Three.”
There's a bit in here inspired by a comic done by my goddamn idol, Reapersun. Here's a link to the page itself:
“We don’t have to.” Sherlock blinked at him, as if he’d forgotten something basic. John fought a grin and failed.
the animal. We have some time. I was going to teach a little Shifter culture to the girls, if you’d like to listen. They haven’t said where they’re from, but they don’t know much about themselves either.”
Finally stepping into John’s path and stopping him from moving other than clenching and unclenching his fist, Sherlock put out a hand. John looked at it, not understanding.
“Fine, fine.” She croaked, not seeming very cognizant as she sank onto a puffy old lounger as if in slow motion.
"Because, brother dear, the folk around here do not like technology. When we get back to London, you’re going right back into hospital.”
John turned, and the man grabbed his face by the chin. He flinched, but kept control of his reflexes.
“But…” Sherlock knew he needed to finish the thought, that John couldn’t. But he was correct, this was not his area. He would try. “But it’s important that I… don’t say anything? John, they may have covered everything up, but they have the tapes of you in the lab.”
John watched, feeling abandoned, defeated, and confused. But the black curls bobbed over the side to look at him.
Trekking over the Irish countryside was a little harder than John had anticipated, the feeling of the alder cane Sherlock had given him after they landed strange in his hands. He couldn’t adjust the height of the solid wood, but Sherlock had measured it properly for at least flat ground, and insisted his would be safer than aluminium. They’d left their phones in an airport locker, along with anything else higher tech than the compass Sherlock had with him.
She paused before replying, Sherlock picked up on it as her not sharing the real answer. “Maybe they came to their senses. Magic isn’t real, Detective Inspector.” She looked him dead in the eye as if to dare him to challenge her. “In any case, whoever lead this group was versed in a very old, Celtic-originating folklore. There aren’t many copies I know of, for the books they’d have learned this from.” She turned to Sherlock and held out her hand. He lowered his brow but handed her his flipbook. She pulled the small pencil out and scribbled down a title, then ripped out the page and handed it to Lestrade before returning the paper to it’s owner.
The master criminal stepped forward, his attention off the men against the wall, and gingerly picked up the little brown bunny by the scruff. He stood tall and held the ball of brown fur at eye level. “Lights down.” He drawled lazily. Somewhere unseen, a lackey dimmed the lights. The grin that slowly spread across the maniacal man’s face was illuminated by an eerie green glow. “Miss Bellefeuille. Your return causes Dr Stapleton quite a problem.”
“I could tell you I didn’t, no matter the truth.” Sherlock drawled, feeling impatient and cold even as another part of him berated him harshly.
She stopped, laying still. Panting, she opened her eyes to look at John. He saw no fear or pain in them, which greatly surprised him. She pulled the white fluffy ruff down on her neck, and John saw the same tall jeweled collar she wore at auction.
Now dressed properly, the uniform over the uncomfortable pants and a shirt, John slid the last touch over his face; the plain white mask which was essential to this plan working. Too many people in the house would be able to recognize John, but now he was properly hidden. He hurried off to find where the young girl was being kept.
Sherlock knelt in front of him, eyes running over the brace and identifying what John was having issues with. “You’ve exacerbated it, the top hinge will unjam if you start at the center.”
. If it wasn't for the throbbing pain that slowly returned to him, John mused he might fall asleep again under the care…
“How you interact with people… if you really don’t respect them, you just play a facade. But with people like K, or those you hold some regard for like that homeless woman we spoke with… you tap into something to portray what you want to. I don’t think that’s something you’ve always been able to do. It’s more believable, sure, but it’s… well, it looks as if you’re wearing a costume that wasn’t made for you, like it doesn’t fit you quite right.” Bluebell tried to read him, but she’d found when she did she got less than if she was more casual. “If you’d been doing it all along, you’d be more adept at it.”
I apologise for this oversight and any harm it may have caused. I will endeavour to improve in the future.
The whipping wind around them had made conversation hard enough they hadn’t bothered trying, enjoying the ride instead. Besides, by now John knew Sherlock had adapted to having him along enough to tell him if he needed any details for his plan.
While John stayed beside Bluebell to observe, Sherlock took the cube over to the desk in their room to examine it. “We need access to a lab, John.”
John looked a little annoyed, but mostly unimpressed. If someone wanted to push his buttons, they’d have to do better. He’d lived for some time now with
If so, I will begin plotting it more seriously. Also, I should say, this fic will not get into NSFW territory, but the continuation will, if that helps :P
“No, though to be fair you were inflicting savage electrical shocks for the fun of it. If you don’t listen to John…” Sherlock stood, pushing the little table away carefully, and stretched his arms up over his head. He swooped down to collect the bottle of wine he’d had before and turned it over in his hand. “Montrachet 2003.” He read off the bottle. “Hm. Impressive. There aren’t many left, are there?” He tossed the bottle end over end in the air. Blythe gasped. Sherlock caught it. “In case that went over your head, Monsieur, I will begin to pour your collection out into the ocean.” He looked smugly at the horror and disdain on their captive’s face. “Bottle opener?”
“Ah. Mycroft must have already started then. Tell her the deal Bluebell struck is the one she’s held to.”
Sherlock locked his phone and replaced it in his pocket. He suspected DI Lestrade had been ordered by his brother to keep tabs on him, and the case was just a means to that end. But he couldn’t be sure, either. He looked up and over to Bluebell and Kirsty, who were supervising and climbing a tree, respectively. He replaced his gloves against the chill, just as his phone buzzed again. He ignored it for the moment.
“I saw the only other Shifters I’ve ever known, before Baskerville, abducted. I was with them, it was close. Harriet saved me. She’s the only person I ever told about me. They couldn’t even report them missing. I was scared, and then… I didn’t want to be able to see the things I can. When I read about it, all I found were children’s stories about monsters. I was eleven. I never thought about it again.”
“He’s’n interesting sort.” Faas cocked his head and pushed his hands into his pockets before following leisurely.
She hissed in his face and he thought he was losing his grip a moment. But her face morphed until she was baring real fangs, and she slipped from her clothes and down the hall before Sherlock had recovered enough to catch her.
She look disappointed, but resigned. “I’ll have Daniel bring around your vehicle, then.” She glanced behind her, and a servant standing there ran off. “I’ll see you off here, then. I’m afraid I must retire. Such a great deal of stress…”
Sherlock came out of the kitchen holding a round-bottomed flask full of something white and milky. “She's got a familiar?” He asked with a deep frown, looking at his brother.
’ It seemed to say. Which was contradictory, in logical terms, since taking on the ‘curse’ and becoming a Shifter too would only serve to bring them closer. But in John’s personal terms… he’d given Sherlock the data to see them quite clearly. This was a part of him he resented and hid from, and not for unsubstantial reasons. Even though he hadn’t said it, it was obvious John blamed himself for the abduction of the boys who showed him what he could do. That and his sister’s terrified reaction had made that event solidify in it’s power in his mind, even now.
Including the silver-haired woman who’d spoken with him, the others all had their backs turned and were on the far side near the bars, giving him space and what privacy they could afford. From what he could make out in the dank hold, there were six others; two small girls who were likely about seven years each who huddled together, a stocky man without a shirt on who was either bald or shaved his head, what looked like a very large fluffy cat on it’s side, and something a few stone larger than a man that was curled in the corner opposite the rest. All those in human form wore similar drab garb, and he was reminded of slave trade. He pawed the trousers closer.
As the DI reacted to that, John considered he was likely far younger than he looked, and a lot of that weariness was most certainly due to Sherlock's role in his life.
“Shit. Shit.” John lifted his other arm to clasp harder to Sherlock, who was being pecked and clawed at without either hand to defend.
There was a tinny, short bark from the area of the kitchen that made Lestrade jump. He managed to not spill on himself, and replaced his cup carefully before looking over. Sherlock had twisted himself to face them with just his tail, his paws were still, and he was obviously glaring.
The fae creature put a finger to it’s mouth and winked, flying past him to the fairy ring and diving excitedly onto the watch. It clutched it and snuggled against it like a long lost pet, then flew out of the circle. Or at least, it made the attempt.
Sherlock’d hit Miss Kar with his cast to disable her, which would have been a hilarious image if it wasn’t in the wake of yet another bullet passing through John’s body. Only this wasn’t the war, and there weren’t other doctors on hand.
Both men scrambled to grab at the glass, but John was already closer to the ground. He smashed his fist down as hard as he could at the awkward angle. ‘
Sherlock looked at it a moment, then bowed politely and fully at the waist, as he might at a formal celebration. “Apologies.”
“Don’t… Sherlock, jesus.” John pulled back, anxiety rising up his esophagus at how close their faces were, how Sherlock was honing in on him and reading
With his eyes closed, John missed the sincerity of Sherlock's replying expression. “Put your leg straight, best wrap it in the position you'll be using the next few hours.”
At one point, someone had tried to pet John and Sherlock backhanded them hard enough to send them spinning to the floor, but that was expected to happen at least once, according to the guests around them.
“Fae-folk can’t eat regular humans, who don’t have the Sight.” John said, trying to pass it off as a comment to Sherlock, who frowned deeply.
Staring, John couldn’t begin to understand what she was thinking of. “This bloody thing made it so you couldn’t fight back... or, I’m assuming, escape?” He asked while carefully sitting her up and inspecting her pupils with his pocket light.
Then the handlers were on him, cuffing his hands behind his back in thick silver manacles. He was too shocked to fight them, or maybe he just trusted Sherlock… he really didn’t know. But he watched the bright intelligent eyes as he was pulled off-stage. They were full of confidence, the exact look they put on when Sherlock was waiting to be asked how he did it.
The girl, Mads apparently, smiled and didn't hesitate to come right up and investigate the scars both front and back of John’s shoulder. It was still quite stiff some days, and both his shifting and being restrained brought out some old aches he'd been done with for some time.
He had to turn it around, just for a second. He stood up straight and took off his mask to look his enemy in the eye. “It’s not close to time for that, not yet. So why are you checking on her? Are you bitter about all the attention she’s getting, all the special treatment for some
John, on the other hand, was focussed entirely on the now. While Moran, the patrons, and presumably any staff were distracted, he slid the gun out of the pocket of Sherlock’s coat. Raising it with one quick, efficient motion, he levelled the gun at Moran, center mass, and pulled the trigger.
John plays peacekeeper in more ways than one and gets to lean into his medical training a bit. Sherlock begins to understand things John would rather ignore. Mrs Hudson is enjoying this probably more than she should.
“We can't raid the place without his connections, Sherlock, and if you're not going to compromise I'll just go with him by myself.”
I apologise for this oversight and any harm it may have caused. I will endeavour to improve in the future.
“Oh.” She looked disappointed but nodded. “Yes, that would be quite a shame. Sit, darling.” She looked down at the cat to give the command.
“You think you’re a saint, do you, Monsieur Holmes? I know who you are, what you do. You might have different measurements, but you’re more full of yourself than I am. Everyone is but a child at the feet of the superior enqueteur Holmes. At least I do not seek them out to tell them how little I think of them all. I stay here, alone, out of the way. I did not even want her here, I only wanted my brother to back off.”
“It isn’t so hard to conceive. Remember what Mycroft told us; many of these Shifter families and groups are old and powerful. But they can’t seem to stop their people being taken and sold.”
Bluebell watched carefully, staying out of the way, as Lestrade let his arm fall back to his side and looked at Sherlock with remorse.
John thinned his lips. “Yeah, I can’t say you’re full of it even. You seem not to notice when I’m there or gone.”
“You’ll catch cold like that.” John spoke in monotone, mouth dry as his brain tried to reboot. They’d passed the point of laughing off these sorts of things a while back, but he was in no way ready to face things further than the one session of kissing they’d had before starting up work again. Distracted, busy, exhausted… the way Sherlock handled detective work, especially with a new avenue of cases at his disposal, wasn’t exactly conducive to any sort of traditional courtship. That suited John alright, mostly, though sometimes he’d lay in bed, the detective beside him with his laptop most often, on special occasions also sleeping, and thought about the feeling of kissing Sherlock on the couch. They hadn’t spoken on it further; any time John considered breaching the topic he lost his nerve before he could articulate anything. He’d even often gone to bed as the warrah, telling himself it was to get more used to being a Shifter openly (in the appropriate company), though he knew it was mostly to soothe his anxiety at sharing a bed after taking a step towards mutual romance.
Sherlock looked down, obviously unhappy they’d stopped, but stuck his hands in his pockets and answered. “The map just leads to way points. We will meet the fae in those places and follow them to our marked Shifters from there. None of those points is in this country, so we need to go back and regroup. Once we do, seeing as you passed their little test, we can hand off the feather to Mycroft’s people and split our job in half. He’ll be able to show the feather as proof of the spells contract.
John walked up, kept himself from jogging, to the building where they’d taken the lift underground. The security system had been removed, all that remained were the holes that fed wires to the card readers. Nothing was locked, security doors completely gone. And the outer lift doors were open, lift itself gone or... Dusty boot prints littered the area, not military but still professional. He sat on his haunches beside the open doors and put one finger to the grey grit settling there. It was still wet, wet enough for him to write his initials or a heart or whatever else people wrote in wet cement. His heart thumped and his brain turned over itself. This is what happened, when they’d finally found the proof. It was gone. They’d done what they could to save a life, even after John was exposed. But they’d lost the bigger battle; military experimentation on Shifters. Now they had…
“John.” The familiar voice was frantic, hands moving over his throat to his face, pinching open his watering eyes to examine him. “John, it’s me. Breathe.”
“I do not. But I cannot back that opinion with fact. I did not interact with him.” Swivelling to look at John with a critical eye, Sherlock wore a stoic face to ask the same thing. “Do you?”
Once around the back, the place was bustling with a forensics team. Lestrade stepped down off the stoop where he’d been speaking to a policewoman with a camera and looked oddly at Bluebell.
John turned back to the sylph and thinned his lips. “We have a deal, you can collect once it’s done.” He said firmly. He tuned out Sherlock’s little laughs off to the side.
cross with me, told me to turn back and never show anyone, ever again. To never talk about it. She was older, even though she isn't a Shifter, she understood the danger better than I did. I didn't take her
Sherlock picked up the bow now and played one long, sweet note. “Why is it you chose not to live in that world, or to shift at all?”
“Why is she out of her dress then?” Steward was obviously trying to catch him either in a lie or a confession.
Strel pointed at him, John pushed her hand down, and she pointed with the other. She looked right at John and said “You used to talk about him.”
In a posh sort of cell in the back of the theater(, something like a green room), John sat rubbing his temples on the plush bench. He’d been given a set of clothes (his own clothes, which though were comfortable and familiar, gave him a very off-putting feeling of being violated. Where had they come from??) and a shaving kit, then left and allowed to shave, check his wounds, even have a hot shower. The cell, though barred locked and sealed magically, was otherwise like a hotel room. It all felt surreal.
As he rolled onto his belly, panting a few breaths and smacking his dry tongue in his mouth, John could see a little collection of figures in the larger cage he’d spied across from the one he’d originally woken in. They’d moved him in with the others. He didn’t feel up to attempting to shift back until he could stand, and he was still too dizzy to make an attempt. So he looked at the folk locked in with him.
Mycroft studied his baby brother a moment, letting his mouth curl downwards in pity and disapproval. “I’m afraid we aren’t exactly certain.”
Sherlock’s only reply was a fast flick of the eyes from John to Steward and back. Then he checked his watch and tsked. “Damn it all. That’s the time, is it.” He turned to fully face Ms De Mueron, taking both her hands in his. “I have another engagement. I cannot thank you enough for humoring my selfish whims, my dear.”
“Oh, absolutely. I am sure he’s happier being entertained on his own level. I’ll have Stewart fetch him. The garden is lovely, he can run around if he likes.”
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
“I’ll get right on that,” came the sarcastic reply. “Why don’t you tell us what you’ve found out about the case, then.”
, and now you’re running all over the world! What are you thinking, John?! That dead man in the field would have been you if I hadn’t shown up-”
It tugged at John, but things had become much too busy to bring it up. He couldn’t assume anything where Sherlock was concerned. He didn’t seem to understand the norms of regular human interaction, let alone romantic ones.
He remembered carefully from Sherlock’s instructions. Apparently, the blueprints to this place had been easier to access than almost any others Sherlock had looked for. That’s how historical sites worked, he supposed.
Here's hoping two chapters today makes up for the unplanned hiatus. Issues with my doggo were more pressing.
Kneeling just inside the circle without touching any of it, she put a finger to the red paint and scratched a little off with her finger. Underneath was a line in black. “Mmhm.”
Breathing carefully in the wake of the experience he’d just gone through, John held on and looked credulously up at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes squinted a second, then he folded his hands behind his back and stood a little straighter. “‘Shifter’ then. Yes. Not just ‘werewolves’, though that’s what you are. A warrah. Falkland Islands wolf, Antarctic wolf, dusicyon australis. An animal researched by Charles Darwin preceding its extinction in the late 1800s. I doubt you’ve been around that long, so it’s not directly related to the species itself. And Dr Frankland... he was a larger variety, grey wolf, canis lupus. Black, though. Ironically. He spent most of his time in a half shifted form while wandering the mist, meaning you don’t need to or perhaps not all can become fully shifted. As you can. The formation of…” He stopped, looking at the expression on John’s face and scrunching his brow. “John.” He wasn’t impressed, relieved, annoyed. He still looked tired, very tired, and had basically stopped listening. “Did I get it wrong? No. That’s not…”
Smirking slightly, Sherlock pulled John’s fingers from his face. He didn’t let them go. “Far from the worst thing done to me, I assure you.” His eyes flicked around at the spirits that circled around and above them. The largest swam through the air in languid circles, looking as a large turtle though transparent and much, much larger. The Shifters took care not to touch it; it was probably keeping the mob from getting violent.
-Lestrade accidentally hits a sore spot by mentioning John while he's not helping look but makes up for it by giving Sherlock John's coat
John took a deep breath, Sherlock watching closely as he could tell there were bouncing thoughts the doctor was considering articulating. “Do you think about…”
Sherlock honed in on him, making John’s skin prickle. “Since getting back, does it ever become difficult not to?” He spoke low and careful.
“How was mummy’s aloe?” Bluebell swept lightly past him and took Kirsty’s hand, talking breezily to her as they went out to the garden together, leaving Sherlock with his cooling tea, abandoned biscuit, and deductions.
“Yeah. She did, didn’t she?” The brother picked at his teeth with a fingernail and checked it, casual though staying in that crouched position overlong should begin to get hard on his legs soon. “Gonna tattle?”
Sherlock blinked. Then his expression softened. “Being considerate will be more difficult than I’d hoped. I’m not used to thinking it’s worth my time.”
Lights further up began to flicker on, orbs lining the road kept aloft by something unseen, and Miss Kar shut off the lights on the SUV.
"They led me out to an outcropping and showed me what they were. They asked me to do the same. I didn't understand, exactly, but it was… instinct, I suppose, at that point.” John stopped to think. He didn't like this story. Taking a deep breath, he continued. “Even though they told me it was a special secret, I asked my sister when I got back to show me what she was. She wasn't happy with my little jab, but she got a bigger surprise when she watched her brother become a wolf cub. She got
About to begin helping the other Shifters, John was nearly knocked over as Sherlock rushed past him.
“-not, because you’re being a condescending arse, and not in the usual way!” John stormed into 221B, tearing off his osprey vest and throwing it down inside the door.
By the time he'd gotten them all out, including a very small bit embedded in his palm, Strel was ready.
John stared adoringly for another moment, until the darkness made it difficult to see. The other fae still hadn’t come back. “Now what?”
John sighed, but he couldn’t raise his objections before Sherlock had grabbed his hands. He quickly dropped the uninjured one in favor of investigating the cuts. He rubbed one with his thumb, and a thin layer of something translucent peeled off. A slow, thick bead of blood followed. “Glue.”
“What the hell is going on?!” A familiar voice yelled, and the small crowd parted to let her in. Miss Kar stormed towards them, though she also did not cross the line the Neighbors had created. She turned to address the mob. “
Sherlock knocked her on the head and she stopped. “You can’t shift here. Your buyer has your cat form registered to her and it’s very rare. If you want to stay away from her, you have to be a human girl until we can ensure your safety otherwise.” Sherlock shoved past the congregation they’d made in front of the door.
“John stop!” He roared, but keeping air in his lungs and pumping his legs AND keeping his brain going all at once was hindering all those things. He allowed an exhale to curse and stopped, doubling back just a few feet to the rover. Henry’s passenger door had the window smashed out, likely the sound they heard. Sherlock didn’t bother shutting doors, though, he just twisted the key John had left to keep the headlights on and shifted, turning the wheel at the same time. As he lurched forwards, petal on the mat, the light that came with him caught the moment John lunged at the closest man. Henry yelled, muffled by the bag over his head, as he was jostled to the ground. The hand holding him had been ripped off as John tackled one of the dark figures to the ground. He didn’t bite into flesh, just kicked off at the next. By using the fallen figure’s abdomen as a launching pad, he knocked the air out of him.
“She’s nice, eh? Little bunny, right? I hear she glows in th’ dark.” The boy leaned over John’s shoulder to speak in his ear. It made the hair on his neck stand on end.
The mistress of the house stood forward and the crowd stopped mumbling about the warrah Shifter from Ireland.
Sherlock played, not saying anything, straight-faced until the bell rang. He didn’t look up, but before John could even try, Mrs Hudson was shouting up the stairs.
Mrs Hudson came forward to greet them but stopped when she saw them in the midst of a row. “Oh dear…”

“You… I really wish you’d talk to me. About this, about Bluebell, about… other things.” He spoke to himself quietly, scrubbing gently much longer than he needed to. He’d never really touched Sherlock’s hair much. It was kinda… nice.
b) have written important points down and left them in the notes at the bottom, please scroll past this chapter and read those. You won't have missed anything.
“I don’t tell you this to recruit you or to entice your pity. I want you to realise your position here and why it’s creating tension. You’re still better off than Mr Holmes. You share a side of our culture, though you do not understand it. The fact he is cursed… we tell our children stories of people nasty enough to be cursed as a Shifter, even if by way of the Unseelie Court.” Looking him over carefully, she gave a genuine smile. “It helps also that to us, you look small and unthreatening. With your knit sweaters and diminutive stature.”
Sherlock’s mind whirred with (finally) new information, and Bluebell took a gulp of her tea and a biscuit. “Kirsty Grant.”
Softening his features a bit and relaxing his shoulders, John blinked and spoke more clearly. “You need to tell me what you’re thinking. I can’t guess, most times.”
“Dunking your head.” John warned blandly, thinking Sherlock wasn’t paying attention anyway. Holding his detective’s nose closed, he pushed him under the soapy water and back up, taking up the conditioner (they’d packed Bluebells as John was certain Sherlock used it but couldn’t find any in his bathroom)...
John knew Sherlock didn’t have any sort of magic. He’d already been in danger since he’d learned about John. If Moriarty had him write to Sherlock, it was unlikely he’d died on the moor. Still, what sort of dangers John would have to face were a mystery even to him.
Sherlock followed her gaze and hiked up his scarf against the cold. “That’s entirely up to her.” He said, voice as chilly as the weather. Then he went around, told the driver “Baker Street.” and got in.
Sherlock pushed forward against John’s weak grip, little hands forcing him back against his face. John laughed, which made it hard not to smile.
“The next time a Neighbor asks you to follow them into the Faerie realm, ask them if a human can go.”
As Kar spoke to the angry people, John led Sherlock out through the space she’d created and back towards the villa. Faas moved once they passed to the middle of the road.
“Keep on the CCTV surveillance and ensure all relevant documentation is delivered to my brother, provided he stays in hospital and listens, at least somewhat, to his physicians.” Mycroft huffed silently and looked out the darkened window distastefully at the totalled rental rover as his investigation team combed over the site. “If he behaves, return this to him after it’s been to the lab.” He added, tapping his fingers on the plastic evidence bag, one of many collected. This one contained a black Haversack coat, with leather patches on the elbows and shoulders.
It was eerily reminiscent of the night they’d taken Henry into the Hollow to find his great beast. John shuddered, his mind forcing him to think back to a time before all this began. Back when he was a doctor, a soldier, a (as Dr Franklin had said) live-in PA… and nothing else. Nothing odd or really special, and certainly fulfilled in the ‘dangerous excitement’ category.
; I stopped. They netted the elk as well, but before I could even move… there was Harry. She’d tossed my clothes at me, grabbed me back… I dunno why, but I shift- shedded. Changed back. By the time the men saw us, we were
“Oh?” Sherlock let his current deductions go unspoken, sitting up and looking at the paper hiding John.
“She can’t come with us, there’s some sort of tracker. If she leaves the immediate area, the collar goes off.”
Sherlock thinned his lips, but didn’t disagree. He shut his eyes, and Bluebell sat quietly for a few minutes.
“Or, alternatively… Kat?” Sherlock looked down at her through the mask, angling his head just so to let the light through, making his eyes sparkle.
“Fer folk who make their stock in solid facts, ya both communicate almost completely subtextually.” Faas drew John’s eye; he’d forgotten the other Shifter was in the room.
Shaking his head again as the wind blew his hair around, as the spirits danced around and talked to him and told him they could help him, John became irritated. “Stop it!” He commanded as he slapped his hand into Sherlocks.
The girl grunted in reply, shaking her head and rubbing at her ears. The engine must have been grating from in there.
“Trying ta shake things up? Find buttons ta push, sait his curiosity… That sorta stuff.” Faas sank into a cross-legged position on the floor and leaned back against Bluebell’s chair. He pulled his legs to his chest and held them there, resting his chin on his knee. “She okay?”
“Also on the block is Sight-less consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. Some of you have heard of his fame in London since his cases have gone viral, but for those who are unfamiliar- Holmes’ modus operandi is a sapiosexual one. Give him a puzzle and watch him dance. Or, if you prefer, use Holmes the younger as leverage against Mycroft Holmes.” There was chatter beyond the blinding veil of stage lights. “Yes, with powerful friends spanning the Western world, a chit to play on Holmes is invaluable on it’s own.”
Heaving himself up, John shot a look down at the detective. “No. Just… I have work to do.” He left his gun with Sherlock and limped off back towards the office.
Blythe looked at Cennerous, who looked blankly back. She was careful not to jostle the cable running between her collar and Sherlock’s computer.
Sherlock had gone down to the end of the block and was turning in a stationary circle very slowly as John approached.
The visage before him when he came into the living room and accepted it'd be where he stayed for the next few minutes at least, was Mycroft. Close behind him, as he sat in Sherlock’s chair, was ‘Anthea’.
John sat back against the railing. It was definitely preferable to the last case, but this seemed almost too easy.
Sherlock approached the cliff’s edge in the direction John had pointed. He stayed a few feet from the edge. “Is there anything else?” Sherlock looked down the cliff face, as well as he could from where he stood.
“I wouldn’t want to impose, dear lady. Are you certain? After just a month, I know training can be at a difficult point. Mine came already knowing it’s place, thank the lord.”
He looked curiously at John, taking a long drag that finished his cig. He drew out and lit another. “People…. No, not in most places these days. But that isn’t what you or her are, is it?” He grinned a yellowed smile. “If a pig could talk, would you stop eating bacon?”
After a moment under that sharp scrutiny, Lestrade buckled, dropping his chin. “You should have told him where you were going.”
“Stop.” She interrupted. “I know you, as well. Mr Holmes. You with the razor eyes and the silver tongue… that is, when you so choose. You will not talk your way out. Not another word from you or I will kill Doctor Watson.”
He looked up at her as he put his phone away and tented his fingers. “You seem to think you already know.” He answered dryly.
John shook his head, “What do you know about cursed Shifters, Mr British Government? Had a lot of experience with curses?” He looked right at Mycroft now, daring him to be contradictory.
“What?” John gripped the sink for balance and stood, testing the weight on his bad leg and cursing himself for running up the stairs, among other things.
Hearing that, Sherlock pushed himself up so he was sitting on the top of his seat and swiveled around to look at them. “Oh yes. I am Sherlock Holmes.”
“Sherlock, there.” John stirred them both out of their minds, pointing out over the cliffs past the crashing waves. “Don’t tell me we have to go on the ocean…”
“How is it possible we’ve been home this long and the kitchen is still mostly functional?” John lifted his head again and looked at Sherlock suspiciously.
“Can’t figure that out for yourself?” John asked, turning to look out the window as if bored and unimpressed.
“Sherlock, it’s fine.” John stood and faced him. “I get it. I’m just…” He pushed his hair back from his face. It’d been too long since he cut it, though it was by no means very long. “I can’t handle this as well as I should, sometimes. I didn’t expect her to be the first one, there’s no reason why I didn’t, but. Jesus, Sherlock, she’s just a kid.”
“I assume you don’t have a passport.” Sherlock said as he wound his scarf around his neck and descended the stairs. He didn’t pause to let her back up, and she was lucky she had rabbit-like reflexes or he’d have barrelled her over.
Sherlock wasn’t really listening. He leaned forward and moved his head around, keeping the giant orbs on John’s face. It was so different from this perception, yet it remained comfortingly familiar. It was so much easier to determine changes to his vision when he had a control to refer to.
“If you weren't delayed trying to fetch it back…” Mycroft started, as John huffed and fell into his own chair.
Sherlock frowned, turning towards the retching sounds from the other side of the room. John was rubbing Bluebell’s back as he carefully inspected everything she’d purged.
John had already talked his way out of two stops from other servants, and he was beginning to get nervous. Though he’d gotten away without arousing suspicion, he doubted that would work with the regular staff. He’d only met people hired for the event, who had assumed he was part of the household and didn’t give him much trouble. If Steward found him, he doubted his mask would protect him. Especially if the bogle was still with him.
Then he was choking on the gas, doubling over as he gasped. It only fed more of the flavorless white smoke into his lungs, and he collapsed slowly down the metal mesh, not giving Moran the satisfaction of a curse.
“Why? Why set it all up and then not do it? We didn’t get the tip until it’d been abandoned at least a few hours.” Lestrade asked, seemingly sinking into Bluebell’s credentials.
Lestrade wrankled a bit; he’d never seen John like this. He’d always been stable when frustrated. Anger was controlled or very focused. This was… uncharacteristically open emotion.
Mrs Hudson sat her up gently, unperturbed by her exposed body, and guided a straw to her mouth. “Oh hush.” She admonished gently. “You’re capable of more than getting through this nasty business.”  She said as she coaxed her charge to sip at the water. Bluebell started coughing, so she removed the water and rubbed her back. “This won’t take you down. You know, Sherlock went through something similar shortly after I met him. You can’t tell me you’re not at least as stubborn as he is.”
The girls, whom John now strongly suspected were twins at the sight of their identical features, were the first to turn back to him. One eyed him warily, while the other came right up to him. John looked down at her and blinked.
Sherlock slowly stood, mind both locked onto this man and scanning their surroundings. Nothing behind them seemed to have changed, no personnel were there, he could hear none approaching.
“Why yes, that seems to be the case.” John deepened his frown. “How is this different from the week you slept in my bed? I won’t be using it.”
Sherlock had opened his case and was going through it on the bed. When John approached, he saw why… apparently at some point between packing and leaving, his flatmate had packed his own things in with John’s.
Unable to sleep while Sherlock was working, even if he wasn’t there, was a part of life John had long since accepted. He took another cup of tea (he’d lost count how many this would make) and tried in vain to read a novel he’d randomly selected. The elder Kar brother was perched nearby, though John was never sure if he was awake or sleeping, to keep him company.
He could hear another struggle nearby, voices echoing and ringing. But he could make it out. The twins were resisting, and a handler threatened them.
on a case.” Then he turned away, flexing his fingers wide and fisting them again and again before running at an angle towards the wall. He pushed off a tree next to it and managed to grab the ledge of the mossy stone. He reestablished his grip carefully, then hoisted himself up.
Grinning and elated, Sherlock began to look carefully as he tracked the other direction of the scent… until it cut off abruptly, as if the suspect had circled there several times and doubled back. Curious. Suspicions formed quickly and Sherlock’s awareness pushed itself out around himself, because this-
“Really, playing possum? Mundane, even for you, brother mine.” A familiar sardonic drawl said beside and above him as he felt movement on the other side of the overturned vehicle. Sherlock opened his one working eye to a pair of ostentatious leather shoes and most of the accompanying trousers as Mycroft had crouched next to him.
“Hey. Here’s the shower, you can shower, right?” John swept his hands towards the copper pipes and clawfoot tub.
“Yeah,” John agreed, smiling, “moreso than usual. Other than that, we could use someone watching imports, updates on underground deals involving things from other countries in the UK. With things as they are, using the homeless network isn’t-”
“Yeah…” John stopped himself asking the obvious next question; why. Instead he put his shades back on. “Oh.” He clapped his hands and looked at Sherlock, who had put his shades on too at some point. “The butler, when he came back, had something with him. Looked like a scarecrow.”
a) apologize for not listing them in the tags, I hadn't planned this specifically until I wrote the chapter. And
“What am I looking at, Molly?” Sherlock asked, distaste in his mouth. He had an idea what was happening. Well, nine ideas. But one especially stuck out.
“John…” Sherlock allowed himself to whisper. He tore his eyes off the man he’d spent a month searching after and scanned the area. Still nothing. There was a commotion of some kind on stage, that likely helped. But there was still no telling… “We have no time, you have to come
Sherlock took a deep breath and stood straight, looking over what he could see from where they stood. “No. Regroup and return in the morning. By car, this time.”
Moments ticked on, Sherlock only watching John’s face with interest and a smug, satisfied grin. His body ached and he felt he would begin to perspire from the exertion again soon, but he could push away those physical sensations easily in his more familiar body. The wolf in headlights before him was much too engaging to bother with transport issues.
So Sherlock had taken off alone to stroll around out of sight, do his own legwork. John didn’t know which scent to track anyway.
When she wasn’t spitting, the woman could be categorized as attractive by current social standards. She stopped, wisely, several feet back. Gripping the handle of the trolley and looking at her hands (gathering courage), she huffed and looked up. She ignored Sherlock entirely. Irksome.
“No, though we do live on the fringes. We’re still accessible to humans. The paper, milk delivery, all those sorts of things come here.” She kept on the main road as the structures grew and became more modern, more pristine, though they had to still be at least 50 years old. At the end, where the road became a bay encircling a very large tree (John couldn’t place the species in the dim light), she slowed before a great fence of moss-loved stone. The gate before them swung inward to let them pass to the old, well kept Tudor.
“Sherlock…” John rubbed his temples wearily. “Why haven’t we been tracking them? We’ve been home for a week already.”
“Holmes.” Sherlock finished for her, standing up straight and turning to the small young woman who had come from the house. She had a plain sort of brown hair, but with oddly spaced bits of a much lighter color. As if her hairdresser was attempting to mottle it. Sherlock let his mouth turn up a twinge. He’d been right in one. He processed her (
Between the dark moods of his compatriots, Mike seemed jolly enough by comparison. Entertaining, he might call it. “Nice he’s worried after you, though.” He suggested.
“No, no, Johnny.” Moran rumbled in his face, showing off his daggered teeth. “One bullet is enough, don’t you think?”
Sherlock finally looked up, folding the Haversack over one arm and tucking it close to his person. “Yes.” He turned on his heel and walked away, Bluebell following a foot or so behind.
There was a boy who looked nearly identical, if it weren’t for his hair… it was much shorter, spiked and pushed from his face with a bandana. That was not the disturbing part of the image, though; he was leaned over Bluebell as she sat, vacant, in the high-back chair beside the window.
Undressing Sherlock wasn’t as difficult as he’d guessed, not only from a physical perspective (he moved and held himself wherever John pulled, like a doll), but from a psychological one. Sherlock was never overly conscious about his own nudity, which made it silly for John to make a fuss about it. It was long before now he’d grown accustomed to whatever state of dress Sherlock had ever employed. He’d been worried their kiss had derailed his thoughts enough to make this awkward, but somehow the way Sherlock was completely distracted and the emotional aftermath of the mobbing made it easy to deal with in comparison.
Sherlock looked quite interested at that. “But that’s…” he read the nervous agitation on John’s face, “not what you want me to say. Not… what you’d prefer to discuss.”
The cat-shift had been gone two days. He hadn't said a word about where he'd been or what happened. Only his voice, which sometimes cracked, betrayed a hint of the encounter.
Again, they waited until evening to go out in search of the sylph. Though they walked lightly around the cliffs that accentuated the beauty of the island, neither man felt that way. And neither wanted the other to notice. And they were both so busy hiding, neither did.
Sherlock found himself a little impressed, despite himself. John must be rubbing off on him. "Very well, then. Why don’t you tell me why you’re living in this house, as a human, and where Dr Stapleton has gone.”
But the hair on John’s head was darkening into a thick auburn, his ears pushing up on his skull. He didn’t break stride for more than a second to kick off his shoes and shake off his clothes as they loosened on his changing frame. The tail finished sprouting, the tip a shimmering white that caught Sherlock’s shrewd gaze as the clouds shifted enough to let the moonlight cast down on them, if only for just a few seconds. He tried his best to keep his breath in him at the sight of it, now ahead by several meters. He pushed harder, but he knew he wouldn’t catch up. He had to distract him, get his attention-which at the moment was laser focused on what John Watson did best; saving the life.
“I’m afraid I can’t let you have that.” The little bird-girl dashed away at the last second as Sherlock put his hand on John’s, guiding his outstretched finger back into a fist. John looked up. “Not as bad as last time. That’s good.”
At that question, Kar put her cup down and looked carefully at John. Even now, there were several sprites hanging off him that he either didn’t see (at their behest) or chose to ignore. He didn’t look overly special, nor did he give off any odd energy. His Shift was rarer than most, but that’d happened plenty without this result. “Maybe it has to do with your character. Beings of magic have a better sense of these things. Or, do you maybe have an odd birthmark, tattoo… some jewelry you always wear or something else that you always keep on you?”
After a moment for the two of them to process that, Faas burst out laughing. “Pfft, is that what you meant?”
“Bugger this…” John mumbled under his breath. He set his face and threw off his coat, letting it flutter behind him.
“Listen, I… just come ‘ere a second.” Lestrade sighed, moving past them to his car. The lights were still flashing about. “I meant to do this earlier, but your brother…” Lestrade trailed off, smart enough to avoid another outburst. Sherlock stalked up as Lestrade pulled a clear plastic square from his back seat and straightened up. “Here.”
So they left. And the woman’s entire demeanor changed from a sharp-tongued socialite to a weary woman closer in class to John himself. She also immediately took off her heels.
And by the end of her tale, no matter how embellished some parts seemed, the smile on Sherlock’s face was completely erased.
…” He began to hiss, jabbing a finger at Lestrade. The older man looked taken aback. Then Bluebell gave Sherlock’s shoulder a tap, palm clapping on his coat. He turned to her, spinning on his heel with a rage bubbling in his chest. She didn’t flinch away from him.
“You haven’t told me ‘no’ outright, though you’d rather do so. I know you haven’t any qualms about setting boundaries, at least with me, which leads me to believe you’d agree to some sort of exchange. I’ve already given you my word on your only request thus far. What else do you want, that I be given leave to observe your shift?”
Bluebell lifted her brow, then turned and removed her gloves. She tossed them into a bin near the door, then folded her arms behind herself and faced out into the room. “Everything in this room, including the carcasses you found, are inconsequential… except the circle.”
Mrs Hudson came in past her, not seeing, and gasped at the abandoned clothes Sherlock was just releasing.
Sherlock watched, not dissatisfied nor assauged, as Doctor Watson returned to action and John Watson vanished for the time being.
Sure enough, as John stepped onto a little hill, he saw a little ring of tiny mushrooms in the moss in the dim light.
John pushed down his many objections and his strong feelings about that sort of thinking. “Well we’re here to take you somewhere you won’t be a slave.”
Bluebell kissed her on the cheek and moved past her. “I’ll try to remember that, if I end up having the time.” She said, feeling hopeful and energised as she turned the corner and started up the stairs. She didn’t make it up even three.
“Con- hold on, Sherlock.” The DI followed Sherlock inside, putting a hand up to stop Bluebell following. “You can’t bring whoever you like, you know. What sort of person do
” He practically seethed. His assistant made her way out quickly, though she made it look casual all the same.
. He did frown harder, however, when Moran gave him a full look over… down his broad chest to his thin trousers and back up, resting finally on his scar. Having the mercenary stare at it as he was was heaps more uncomfortable than Mads poking at it earlier. He didn’t look away until a beeping started, and John could hear the mechanical whirr of landing gear lowering.
Unexpectedly, Sherlock gave him a smirk (which John was reluctant to attribute to anything but pity) and came over. He knelt at John’s side, put down the kit, and opened it. “Tell me if I hurt you.”
Left with an unfamiliar and unsure feeling, Sherlock backed up and allowed himself to be shut out, the door locking audibly. He stood there, trying to think, until he heard the water turn on. Then he rounded back into the flat, hung his coat on the hook where it lived when not on his person, and went into his bedroom.
“Detective Inspector.” Sherlock interrupted loudly, looking perturbed. “Did you, or did you not, come here with a case?”
“The fae, to begin with…” Gigi started, but Faas’ ears perked up and he raised his head towards the ladder up leading to the rest of the plane. “Girls.” She said in a hurried, hushed tone. Both came over to her, the bald man stood and though he had to duck a little he moved over to where the cage was locked. Faas seemed to vanish somewhere.
“My mother will be thrilled.” Sherlock replied distractedly, back to work at gathering samples. “I really do need a centrifuge to properly determine if this was toxic.”
Even John didn’t know why that was his last straw, but it was. “You want to be in London, don’t think I don’t know that! You want to be working cases
. He threw out the snide accusations that he’d been at fault for prioritizing his flatmate. Here, starving in a pit in god knows what country… he had to admit he could have dated while living with Sherlock. The detective rarely insisted on John’s company or help, he tagged along of his own accord. He could sleep when Sherlock didn’t, on a case. But he didn’t want that. He wanted to witness it, to be right in the thick of it.
Releasing his grip, John nodded, turning to Sherlock and Faas. The springy youth was watching Sherlock carefully from beside him, and it didn’t seem to bother him at all he was being ignored. “Come on. She’s right. We should leave as quickly as we’re able.”
I met Sherlock. I've been around enough to understand why, at least to start. But now I'm his family as much as you are. And you can accept that and start working with me again, or you can keep trying to get rid of me. I'm prepared for either. My point here, Mycroft, is that I'm bloody tired of your petty bullying and I'm not doing this again. Not even once more. The next time you piss him off for this reason, the next time he drops you on your arse… I won't help you back into his life.” John used his unique talent for looking down at people taller than him. “Goodnight, Mycroft.”
Mycroft.” John said again, with finality. Then he left the elder Holmes to the black Sedan that pulled up, walking towards the Main Street to find Sherlock.
John tugged him further from the cliffs, backing up a few extra steps. “We shouldn’t be near the edge.”
“How did they get her in the first place, then? And why wasn’t there more fuss about her going missing?”
’ Bluebell thought to herself. She put her arms up and helped her charge down, the girl having executed her goal of pulling an apple off a higher limb. “I’ve answered your questions, Mr Holmes.”
Taking in and cataloging the looks and movements and ticks of John for closer examination later, Sherlock blinked, decided on the wisest course, and opened his mouth. “He wanted it for himself.” Putting his hands behind himself and folding them meticulously there, Sherlock stood properly and felt his height. He spoke down to John like a parent or teacher, and knew only partially it was to offset the tension of the stakes of this tale. John didn’t seem to notice, or if he did, mind. The familiarity of explaining locked in and Sherlock became more sturdy as he went on. “He has such deep disregard for life, significantly for his own, so he procured Fairy Ointment and went about raising the displeasure of, I believe he said, the Seelie court. I supposed he must have been distracted or showing off as he was notably surprised by the outcome in addition to his great displeasure. I went in search of his knowledge of Bluebell’s condition, as I’d said.” Lowering his chin and calculatedly softening his features, he finished his report. “I did not intend to become cursed, nor did I passively allow it. I was physically unable to anticipate it.” He tapped beside his eyes to illustrate his point, to be especially clear. Then he replaced his hand behind his back and waited.
.” John seemed to be getting more strength in him every second he stood there, Sherlock’s hands not steadying him but ready to, immediately, if needed.
She looked up at him. He was very different, right after accessing whatever ‘Redbeard’ was. She shook her head. “I need to shift, it’s very uncomfortable to go this long without. I couldn’t shift after leaving Baskerville. Not around K.”
“Come on.” John encouraged, seemingly getting his energy back from the short stay at home, the beginnings of progress, and Sherlock’s new admirer. “You seem to have an easier time around kids than adults anyway. Is it really so bad? She’s not really bothering you.”
John turned away, coughing, and the smile faded off Sherlock’s face. Because he knew exactly what that was, John had told him already. His nightmares about Baskerville.
John couldn't tell if Sherlock was asking normally or poking fun. “Why… why are we talking about this?”
know. You’re right. But this is not the first time you were put in danger because you chose not to learn about this. You don’t have to acknowledge them to teach yourself what they can do and keep it in mind. If something makes you uncomfortable, you can’t push it out of the way until it gives up. You need to learn to deal with it, what you can and can’t do, what you’re willing to do.”
“Still touchy I see, even after our heartfelt discussion.” Mycroft hummed. But it made John grin when he got up anyway, and approached the doorway where they stood. “Any progress to report, after they no doubt confiscated your mobile?”
“You idiot… she told you clearly not to go out there when it’s light out.” John sighed, still pulling Sherlock along behind him. He wasn’t resisting, but he wasn’t keeping up properly either. “You’re damn lucky that’s the worst that happened.”
John dug carefully into where he knew he kept his charcoal and took it out, as well as a set of medical gloves.
Finally hitting the swell of bodies, John forced himself through, making himself small and dense as he wormed, pushed… he broke out and stopped, catching his breath. Sherlock didn’t appear injured as he stood tall, defiant, in the middle of it all. Around his detective there stood an empty space about a metre in radius, between the mob and him. Stomach dropping, John realized the mob was throwing more than curses at him.
, John opened his mouth and finished the tale. “Until Baskerville, I never shifted again. Not once.”
“Miss De Mueron!” Sherlock exclaimed, twisting on his heel as she appeared in the doorway in a tailored sundress and impractically large hat. John wondered, amused, if the flowers sewn into the accessory were alive as they looked. “Such an honor, my lady, to finally meet such an esteemed figure as you.” Sherlock continued, taking her hand dramatically and kissing the large jeweled ring adorning it.
-Bluebell, who is like 5 feet tall, walks around a crime scene like the queen she is and figures out some stuff
When she was finished, Bluebell sat up on her haunches so she could see up far enough, her fur midway through it’s seasonal change from white to brown.
Ignoring the fact a teenager was lounging about ten feet up on a very old looking wooden bookcase, John smirked and leaned back. He took up a paper from the side table and starting glancing over it.
John did, shooting a glare at him. The wanker was as calm as you please, face neutral as always. Because why the hell wouldn’t… And then the image, the voice, of Sherlock from a couple weeks past emerged in John’s mind.
“Did you intend for either of you to attend tonight’s party?” The butler looked smug, he thought he’d finally found the right question to out John’s betrayal.
“If yer interested, I’d like ta tell ya mine. Something I didn’t want the girls ta hear… they should feel ok telling folk they trust, and… this tale isn’t one’a those.”
With that, Sherlock scooped up his clippings, left the remains, and walked out. John let out a little annoyed huff as he helped clean up, then paid for their drinks.
“Hm. Mostly. But it’s not rare to see them in a family without any connection, either. What is rare is one that gets to your age without being discovered.”
“Fine. I’ll take on your ridiculous request.” He tented his fingers again. “Now, tell me everything you know about Shifters, and start from the beginning. And don’t be boring.”
“Yeah…” John looked from the closed off Strel over to Mads, who was pacing around and looking at everything around them. He hadn’t forgotten for a second where he was and what it meant. He was starting to suspect these two children didn’t either. “Yeah, it’d be good to catch up on things.”
“The feather. Yes. Part of a skin. That’s why it smelled so strongly, to you at least. And Bluebell, when she first encountered it. And recently I have learned how they authenticate and use these skins, these pelts. Another auction guest told me at the party.” His eyes flashed and he stopped to look John dead in the face. “Places like that, even with their reputation… this particular item is bid on after a ritual of sorts.” He stepped closer, close enough he was looming over John. “They bring out a Shifter as human, force their animal form, and they
He was about to be surrounded by Shifters and likely Neighbors, the former of which certainly didn’t take kindly to cursed Shifters. His only allies therein were a woman he’d threatened to kill and who had shot his partner, and an inexperienced child.
They hadn’t spoken again, even once they were a safe distance from the lighthouse. And it wasn’t because John got the distinct impression they’d been seen, even if no one seemed to be following.
John watched him walk past and out, unilaterally finishing their discussion, then looked back at the bed.
After a comfortable silence and the Icelandair safety demonstration, the lights dimmed in the plane. John was already drifting.
“Yeah, I thought so.” She said, looking smug with a twitch of her nose. John eyed her but didn’t ask.
Permeating dulcet tones flowed, getting louder until they swirled about and encompassed the room. Sherlock stood for better movement of his arm, swaying a bit as the tune swelled. “Who could love a werewolf… how novel. You’ve no intention of seeking out a community, then?”
“I wanted to find her.” John answered, doing his best to sound dense. He tilted his head a tad to add to the image.
Sherlock had his face in the local paper, tea poured out but cooling, plate empty of even the attempt at something solid. Either something had caught his attention, he was avoiding something, or both.
Shaken back again by her hand on his… but damn, the heat. He put his forehead to hers, then sat back with a frown at her unknowing face. “Your damn brain is being poached in your skull.” He said, more to himself, with the taste of rot in his words.
Sherlock’s smile came back, curling. “She was unexpectedly helpful on that case. You rather liked that one.” He picked up his violin again and his voice began to drip with superiority, “What ever became of her?”
“Damn it Harriet you always throw this bollocks in my face! I’m a bloody adult, I can take care of myself!”
Sherlock was perched atop the lounger, with his arse settled on the back and his feet curled on the seat. He was balancing the paper pad provided for letter writing on his knee, and was already tearing off another sheet. “Yes.”
“Don’t mind him, he’s just… well, you know. For show. It helps he’s a doctor as well, such a helpful creature really.”
By the time Faas returned with a large and very expensive-looking microscope, Bluebell was asleep and John was monitoring her vitals. They’d been consistent, at least as far as the last few days.
Standing in military posture, John grew collected and cold. “You may want to try that again, sergeant.” He narrowed his eyes just enough to give his posture the chill of danger, and he could tell without deductive powers this man hadn’t seen so much as a drunken knife fight in his life. Likely why he acted like this, in all honesty.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock reappeared, empty handed, and stalked up to glare point blank. “Just tell us the markers you're taking, I'll hand over the artifact, and you can scurry out of here.”
’ He allowed himself to think it as a joke, huffing a laugh to cement the fact it was only humor. But the brisk walk in the cool air, in the ambient atmosphere, next to the stoic figure in his trademark coat… it soothed a portion of John’s anxiety.
John hissed, and Sherlock whipped back around. “Yeah. Sorry about the floors, Mrs Hudson," John motioned at the small trail of blood he'd left, "though I’m sure with him here they’ve seen worse.”
John looked at the woman, who couldn’t have been more than 15 years his senior, as if she wasn’t petting a cat he couldn’t with certainty say was not a person. As if she was making things up. “Mages? You expect me to just…”
The minute the door closed, John got to work. He took off Sherlock’s coat, which had been baggy enough on him to easily hide a few extra things in it. John was thankful as he changed his ridiculous top for an 'a' shirt, and took off his other accessories as well, stowing them in the coat and taking the little package in their place.
From the corner of his eye, he watched them move one of the unfamiliar shifters in her cage. They seemed to want her to stay as she was; a snow leopard. They collared her with something that looked more decorative than restraining, and led her out while the other men dealt with John.
Sherlock gave John a few moments to sit, both torches off to keep themselves from being seen. They didn’t light them again until they were well within the line of trees.
Sherlock looked at him, not missing a beat no matter where else his attention seemed to be. “You can say no.”
“Yeah.” Still uncomfortable, John adjusted his stance yet again. “Why have you changed into… that? And you’re not demanding something. You’re asking. Politely.”
“Yes…” Mrs Hudson sighed, both fond and sad. “Those’re my boys. Greg was nice enough to take it for us, the dear.” She squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder. “I don’t think you’ve seen this one before. You didn’t notice us take it.”
The drive over was the shortest and longest ride of his life so far. John felt anxiety creep up on him, not because it was dangerous, but because of both what he was wearing and what it represented. If people wanted to dress themselves like this, in other circumstances, that was their business. But here it meant he was lower than the others, the ‘real people’ who would be there. People like Sherlock.
She screwed up her face as she tried to hang on to cognizance. “Today… god, how long had today been?”
Lestrade pondered that. “I never knew John before I knew him around Sherlock. Was he really that different before going overseas?”
John blinked. He'd been watching his memory for the first time in many years. He couldn't remember their names or what the men who took them looked like. Couldn't even remember returning to their cabin with Harry. His next vivid memory was leaving in the car a couple days later, wondering why there were no police, no posters.
Sitting on the provided antique chair and giving the waiter his drink order, Sherlock considered, even briefly, that Harriet Watson might be right: John should never shift again.
Backing up just enough to meet the slightly shorter man’s eye to beam at him, “Family’ll do that to ya,” Faas chirped, before hugging him close again.
“Escape to where? I have nothing, no currency nor identification. How would I get from this island to anywhere?”
“How precious. Visiting with her uncles.” The woman sighed dreamily. “I’ll bring by a tray for her in the morning.”
She looked much more comfortable in a sleeveless Union Jack tee, denim jacket, dark green trousers, red high tops and a baseball cap. She looked extremely like a tourist.
Until, that is, they began to roll ‘lots’ into place. Some were deceptively mundane or things you’d expect at an ordinary auction, such as vases or books, worn clothing, animal hides. Then there were more… exotic things. Some were empty cages Sherlock was fairly certain had fae in them he just couldn’t see, someone wheeled past an enormous cylindrical water tank. In that, Sherlock thought he saw glimmers of something large and dark in the blue-green of the water. No sign yet of any Shifters. ‘
Without another word, Sherlock huffed and got out. He looked over the building carefully before sweeping into the alley beside it. The front was still boarded up.
It wasn’t more than a chore at the moment, as he was in a dressing gown and sleeping trousers and nothing else. Out here, he didn’t have the need to stuff tissue in his ears, either. That only lead to him shaking his leg as he missed London, a living creature of a city and far closer to him than the fluttering Neighbors he’d finally gotten the ability to see. God he could use a smoke. John had been vigilant about disallowing his pipe from their luggage. Downside of sharing.
“I am sorry, John. It has been so very long with just the two of us. He's never had anyone else he could trust, though he has tried.”
Steward narrowed his eyes, and John saw his hands turn something over… the glass orb. Looking more closely… it was definitely tied to the bogle. It was astounding John hadn’t picked up on it before…
“Don’t bother, John.” Sherlock called, as quietly as he could while being heard. “They’ve filled it. Everything underground.”
Turning from laughter to a wicked grin, John hoisted Sherlock under the arms and held him up. He was dense, but John was strong. Only the fluffy tail grazed the floor. “This could be useful.”
“Jesus, Sherlock…” John sunk to his knees, hands ghosting over the twisting body beneath the throw, afraid to touch during the process. It didn’t take long to end. Taking great care, John rested his hands down and pulled up the cover to see the shaking ball of fur, it’s long tail curled up around it’s arm with just it’s rump still in the now loose trousers. “Does it hurt?” He asked, hesitating to put his palm to the thick reddish-tan poof covering his detective. The little head, eyes shut tight as if in defiance, shook enough to answer.
As he spotted something move, only a shadow from this distance, on the far side of the grounds, John wondered why he hadn’t seen anyone at all in the village. Not one human, Shifter or Neighbor.
Even though it was a fair enough temperature out, Sherlock was wrapped tight in his scarf and coat, the collar up without pretense for once.
“Yes, indeed. Though I regret to say I must keep him as he is for now. You can see he’s gone and hurt himself. If he changes around too much, it might scar.”
“Well, no. Why would I. Obvious. Boring. But I don’t have the data to extrapolate a magical background.” He played two short, sharp notes.
. “What? So you can’t tell if I get blood on them.” John didn’t even laugh at his own terrible joke. "You know, because I keep getting shot? Nevermind..."
Lestrade sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Sherlock watched her critically. She continued. “However many people were involved-”
’ Between the disappearance at the beach and those frantic words, the idea had stayed with him the rest of his life; you can’t have both. And if he kept going the way he was, the human in his life is what he’d lose.
“See. Easier.” Sherlock took another bite of apple. Annoyed, John snatched it from him and made his way up the stairs. “Hey.” Sherlock followed.
Looking down in surprise to see Sherlock had finished (an excellent job, needlessly symmetrical even) and was holding up his baggy old trousers, John swallowed.
Sherlock turned around with his med kit to see John was wearing bright red pants. Sherlock blinked, eyes drawn in by the striking color and
John helped her out of the boot, since she seemed to be shaking and unsteady. “Are you alright? I’m sorry it took so long to get out of there.”
She looked over the aisle past the window as they gained momentum. They were the only two in the small private jet apart from the pilot, co-pilot, and one steward. The path to get them there was winding, confusing, and Bluebell was certain she couldn’t replicate it if pressed. She wasn’t even sure if they were leaving from London.
Sherlock watched Bluebell closely, this transformation was nothing at all like the one he’d seen on the plane. She shook, her bones cracked as they condensed down, and she was shivering excessively. It made him clutch harder at John, to keep out the pitch Sherlock himself couldn’t make out. He didn’t let go even when Moriarty clicked off the little black box and replaced it in his pocket.
As usual, Sherlock was staring intensely. Watching with a discerning gaze, collecting data. And for reasons he didn’t understand nor care about, John didn’t begrudge him. He didn’t feel like a slide under a microscope, or a crime scene, or anyone unlucky enough to be around Sherlock when he was bored. He felt the eyes on him and all it gave him was comfort.
“You’ve always got to look for something else, anything you can focus on instead of your own problems. That’s all this is, this you don’t like my job, you don’t like my military service, you don’t like my flatmate… it’s easier that facing yourself and your own problems. Stop pretending you give two shits about me and my circumstances, Harriet.” John spoke in a faux calm, low and measured. “I’m going home. Don’t call me, don’t text me, don’t leave messages. And for the love of god, delete Mrs Hudson’s number so I don’t have to help her change it.” John turned and walked towards Sherlock and the cab.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but shut it again as he heard a call from downstairs. He left without a word to check on Mrs Hudson.
Yes I left a fairly literal cliffhanger and yes this doesn't resolve it at all. But I'm not the showrunners. I'm not going to give you bullshit, I'm going to actually explain things properly. Because I'm not a dickhead.
It was like a bucket of ice water to the face. The Neighbors had quieted, back to the wisps they were usually in John’s periphery, the pull in his chest subsided, he no longer felt itchy… he was as he’d been; a bit knackered but focused and neutral.
Sherlock’s lips twinged, but he tented his fingers and stared, eyes locked on but slightly out of focus. She had to admit, it was both intimidating and impressive to watch him work on something he didn’t immediately understand. “You’re put off by the prospect of being vulnerable, the most logical solution is to equalize the situation. I doubt something as crass as nudity would solve it…”
After glancing over the article quickly, a son was arrested on suspicion of killing his father, John smirked and huffed a breath out his nose. “That’s pretty suspicious right there, isn’t it.” But when he looked up at his detective for confirmation, his smile faded into a quizzical look. Sherlock had on his smuggest of grins. “On the contrary, actually. That indeed was what led me to doubt his guilt altogether. It isn’t a far leap to feel guilt and shame when you’ve just been quarrelling with family before they die. Thinking he’s deserving of punishment, though not for the crime with which he’s being charged… he is either an innocent man, or one with prodigious self-restraint and control.”
“‘Petty bullying’ is so far from what that was, Sherlock, it was a bloody angry mob. The only clue missing is torches and pitchforks.” He pushed into the front door, which had been left ajar, and up the stairs to the bathroom.
“Enough!” She yelled, moving her finger to the trigger. “I’m starting to think a minute was too generous.” She seethed.
Sherlock arrived at the small residence in the back country surrounding Dartmoor around 5 that evening. He didn’t bother knocking, rather he let himself into the garden by way of the lattice gate and strolled along around behind the house.
John furrowed his brow, looking up at his detective’s scheming face as it hovered above him. “You know they can, as long as they have the Sight.”
No leads… That wasn’t at all what he’d said to Mycroft, and he absolutely said nothing of the sort to Lestrade. He supposed he could go there before Baker Street, at least see what had the DI squawking at him. If it wasn’t just Mycroft, the nagging git.
Frowning, John crossed his arms above the satchel. “What does it matter she glows? She was kept by the same people who took your son, and for a lot longer. You knew that much.”
“You absolutely cannot crash us into the ditch.” Sherlock said, dead serious. He made a whole thing of doing the seat belt and checking the mirrors so Strel could see with them.
Leo Kar’s eyes raised, flashing. He stood, dropped off the bed, and took a step forward so he was right in Faas’ face. “Make me.”
John tried his airline tea, spat it back into the cup, and put it down in disgust. “We can’t go into a fairy ring.”
“Fine, we can walk. But you need to slow the fuck down. I’m navigating terrain and this cane and my leg all at once, so work on your compromising skills and stop leaving me in your dust. At least until I can walk normally again.”
If you happened to get off a flight at Heathrow airport in London England, at 3:45 in the morning, on a very particular winter’s day… here’s what you’d see:
Sherlock blew a huff out his nose and walked swiftly up the stairs. He found John sitting on the edge of the tub, his thick trousers off (he wore a light pair underneath as cushioning) and working on removing the brace that was obviously digging into him hard after all the strain.
“Leave?” John asked fretfully, a few paces behind. His hand pressed firmly against Sherlock’s cheek. “Why…” Ah, there it was. The realization. The proverbial shoe. “Because you’re cursed.”
Mycroft waded through the organised chaos as his people rolled John carefully on an old cloth gurney, and stood before his irritating, idiot brother. He grabbed Sherlock’s arm, forcing it towards him though Sherlock jolted, pulled back, and yelled. “You took off your cast.” Mycroft dripped with fury.
John started over towards Sherlock, worried because he’d taken a blow to the head. He stumbled on the way and put a hand to his head, the other to the wall, and slid down onto his haunches as he tried to fight off the dizzy spell swimming behind his eyes.
Sherlock had picked up his violin, but not his bow, and was plucking at the strings. He was also cooly watching John.
John felt the rush of air and things seemed to return to normal as the sprite danced around him, and his body felt suddenly very heavy. He took his hand back to steady himself as he intentionally fell backwards on his arse. He leaned forwards, pushing his face into his hands and breathing slowly.
Sherlock positively glowered. There was no missing persons case for John due to the abnormal circumstances, but he was sure his brother had informed Lestrade at least that John was abducted and that he couldn’t get involved. The fact he’d done nothing, as ordered, was telling. And it made Sherlock lose a majority of what respect he’d afforded the DI over the years.
an artifact we had in our home… the seals there to protect it dun work on regular humans. He’s alive, but… it’s not good.
“Explain here, then.” John insisted, somewhat irked, as he dragged a towel over Sherlock’s scalp probably harder than he had to.
John sighed and gave in, concentrating on getting his pajama trousers back off without either hurting himself or taking too long.
He surmised, though the boy was at least 18 and could pass for older if he didn’t act so energetically. He also noticed something in John he found he liked… a gentle hand, perhaps? Or the fact he hadn't nearly as much color in his cheeks or vivacity in his demeanor for a long while...
“Oh! Yes I should have remembered. My girl told me there were some amazing doings there. Such a shame I missed it but I simply cannot be expected to be everywhere I’d like to.” She looked pointedly at John now, and he blinked at her meekly to play it up. “Ah yes. I as well. I missed out the last time, those sort are very rare and only a handful are available each time it’s hosted. I am very fortunate as well, she’s just darling. Would you like to see her?”
“John.” Sherlock said invitingly as he gazed down at the doctor with a grin. Some of the color returned to his cheeks as the familiar adrenaline pumped through his veins. He knew what that look meant; imminent, fantastical danger… of the sort they could handle, in Sherlock’s opinion at least. He stood with fervor, the chemicals in his blood allowing him to forget his physical distress.
“Did you know even people without Sight can temporarily see what you do, in certain circumstances? Inside a fairy ring is one of those circumstances.”
Because he was unable to risk shifting accidentally, Sherlock went after dark to the scene of the murder, a pond sitting between two properties, to collect information.
The DI wore a wonky smile and finished his tea. “Ta. None issue, far as I’d consider. Just glad it turned out in the end.”
Before he could answer, Strel emerged, her cap on backwards now. She walked over to the table, pulled the chair John had been using over to it, and sat on her knees to eat.
Completely outside the ring except where it’s hands held the gold trinket, the sylph glared at John. He blinked and moved his head back.
I apologise for this oversight and any harm it may have caused. I will endeavour to improve in the future.
Bluebell was made to feel a little better as she sunk into her seat across from Sherlock, barely ruffled while the detective was flushed and catching his breath. Being a rabbit-shift had advantages.
John nearly felt embarrassed, like he was reading into things… but he trusted his gut. “Sherlock…” He stopped himself. There was no point, he wouldn’t…
Sherlock quickly found the glass shards wrapped in a cloth napkin. “John.” He looked up and bolted over in time to catch the bathroom door before it closed. “Show me.”
Leaving John to his professional purview, Sherlock was already pulling out his clothes and getting dressed. “Your brother, hm? And where might he be?”
Shout out to my Dad, who helped me discover whether bringing John's gun would be realistic. It wasn't. It's still hella illegal for him to have it in London and travelling outside the country with it would be Not Good, even for Sherlock.
Then his gaze idled over to the skeletal creature shuffling across the living room (or sitting room, or whatever. Not that it mattered.). “And how are we today, Miss Rabbit.” He asked, as if she were capable of telling him anything he couldn’t figure from looking.
John took it, leaning heavily on his detective’s support to avoid jostling anything. Sherlock guided John’s hands to his shoulders, bending down a little to make it easier, and tugged the pajamas the rest of the way up to sit midway up on his hips.

As Sherlock fastened the second to last button, there was a rush of air and a great whirring as the curtain beside them lifted. Both caught in the blinding brightness of the stage lighting, John had the sense to quickly and stealthily slip his gun into a pocket as he raised the other hand to shield his eyes.
Sherlock stood and escorted her to his seat. “It’s been a very trying evening for you, Kat-” John turned away to make a face at the pet name, “is there anything I can do?”
Lowering his brow now, Sherlock crossed his arms. “Honestly, John. Of all the things I could possibly resent you for…”
“Magic?” John finished, turning around and crossing his arms. “Why didn’t you take the case from Lestrade, Sherlock?”
“What do I…” Bluebell thought briefly, she really didn’t know. The only reason she hadn’t shut him down was she wasn’t entirely against letting him see. Though she’d be nude to start, she doubt she had to worry about Sherlock Holmes staring or making her feel judged about it. “Why don’t you guess?”
A sly grin matched John’s glare, looking him in the eye and then obviously scanning the doctor up and down with invasive scrutiny. Then he turned on his heel and traipsed lazily down the stairs to meet with a girl John didn’t know how he could have missed; she had long, curling locks dyed a bright turquoise. She looked very worried, but she also seemed to only have eyes for the younger Kar brother, and they went off out of sight together.
John stared for a bit, heat rising up his collar. “Out.” Sherlock let his head tilt slightly. “Out, I need a shower, that’s why I came in here.”
She pushed him over on his arse, glaring. While Sherlock laughed, she walked past to the bathroom and closed the door.
Tenting his fingers, Sherlock went about scanning the car he was in for the third time. That damned woman with the West Highland terrier was here again, apparently since deciding to not grant her son's plea for money but instead to move in with him until he cleaned up his act. It made Sherlock frown. The man wasn’t neglectful of his obligations, he was a victim of circumstance. But it was far from his problem.
Without turning, Sherlock replied. “You had more than adequate space, it would have been cumbersome to bring another case.”
Sherlock waited, hands resting on John’s wrist but not putting any weight on it. He watched his huffing flatmate wind down, having gotten things out a bit.
Sherlock smirked and lowered to his belly to extend a hand. “Come on. Unless you think you can climb this without my help.”
Sherlock, still grasping his legs like a teenager at a sports day on the grass, watched with interest even though he could only catch half of the conversation. John started to ask him for help when the wind kicked up in his face, full of innocent laughter.
“What puzzles me, John, is why are the Fae not helping? Bluebell cannot be the first to think to seek their assistance. And given what we’ve learned about what they keep calling you, ‘Heira’, they like your kind just fine.”
. Three of whom were on his list of missing persons from the supernatural community. He suspected the other two, Andean Cats, hadn't
The rattling of the SUV bumped once on each set of tires and stopped. John leaned sideways to look, since the light hadn’t changed from the dark of the deep prairies. The headlights looked as if they were shining through fog, though it was clear out, and instead of being shook they now glided as if on a newly paved parking lot. But it wasn’t asphalt or cement. Running ahead and under them looked as if made from large rocks that had been smoothed and fitted together so the only way to tell they weren’t all one stone was by the differing colors and patterns.
John came over and put a hand in the table, leaning on it and wiping the other down his face. “How?”
Deciding at that moment this man didn’t possess the logic needed to have a discussion, John turned to see what Sherlock wanted to do now. He wasn’t there.
John let his face sink into resignation, then ran his hand down it. “Yeah. Right. I’ll…” He was going to say ‘
“See what you have to say about him after a few days in his company.” John chuckled, hiking up his satchel on his shoulder and dragging the wheeled case behind him.
Planning out the second part of this, I have a solid plot (that was originally going to be part of this one) and some bouncing ideas, so that's happening.
Sherlock’s heart pounded in his head as he unlatched the shackles, picked the locks, lifted the muzzle carefully… It, too, had a circle carved into the silver. And he wished for the first time in his life he couldn’t read everything so easily…
Back to sour, then somewhat smug, “And you, Doctor Watson? All those years of avoidance, suddenly now you’re so well informed. Quite impressive.”
they’d forced him to shift and tased him, but done nothing else John could find. Even the dead man had
Sherlock stared for a moment, then leaned forward. Before John could react, Sherlock dipped sideways to catch the rabbit, which had hopped off his chair, before it hit the floor.
I am the god of run-on sentences, and I'm leaning into it. My excuse is that I've been reading original canon and Sir ACD is nefarious for it, too. Wanna complain, leave a comment.
John looked up to see a Neighbor the size of a child, with small horns and a cloth hiding it’s face, dressed in robes. He got a bad feeling from it. He tried to ignore it.
He watched the tall, broad back of his detective. What was he thinking of now? Surely the case at hand… or was it silly to think maybe this reminded him, too…
“Alright, alright.” Lestrade put up his hands, surrendering. “I don’t want to get into anything. Probably best we just take a little time off, yeah?”
Sherlock turned to look at John and huffed at him. “Yes. The Quebecois accent is scores different from the French accent. How is it you didn’t pick up on it?”
“The warden wasn’t a Shifter, nor was she a caster from what I could tell, though how would I know? Most of the evidence is invisible to my eyes. Do you have any idea how frustrating that has been since this began? It doesn’t factor in, regardless.” He stopped a moment, turned, and started pacing counterclockwise. “She used a skin, a very particular skin. Rare, because it’s difficult to tell whether it’s genuine unless you’re a Shifter yourself. You’ve been close to something similar before, you couldn’t hide your reaction every time the reek hit your nose.”
It seemed like Sherlock wasn’t going to give him anything, so John turned and grabbed his Haversack off the hook. As he turned, sliding his arm in the sleeve, Sherlock stood. He strode forwards, pulled the throw tight around his shoulders with one hand (as the towel fell to the floor), and was in John’s space before the shorter man could react. Letting the jacket hang on one arm, John tilted his head to counter the intense stare Sherlock wore.
There was a long pause (two minutes, thirty-six seconds) before John spoke again. “I don’t like calling in favors like that unless I really have to.” Sherlock abandoned the thought entirely, searching his database for a redundancy to fit the voice on the other side of the line. “No. I don’t have an alternative. Yet. I have a little time.” That little rub of friction; he’d moved his weight off one leg. He was irritated but submissive, to the person or the facts they presented Sherlock could not yet tell. He was also wearing jeans. The list of things that indicated flashed through Sherlock’s mind and he picked out the most damning (he was railing subconsciously against his ties to the fae, he felt out of control of something and wanted reassurance, and he either wasn’t leaving the flat today or he was going to a pub. Most likely the latter. Frustrating.) before tuning in for the end of the call.
He was also doing his best to ignore the Neighbors, which were everywhere and mostly aware he could see them. Some were monstrous and terrifying, basically a block of void with random eyes set everywhere. There were also wood nymphs, which liked to point and giggle behind their branches, and be more tree or more human-like depending on their mood that second. Small pudgy brown things ran around on twig legs, something shimmering silver stayed way out in the woods, drifting around in John’s periphery but never enough to make anything out. He could also almost always hear bells, far off and echoed so he couldn’t pinpoint a direction. At one point, something huge flew overhead and John was tempted to ask if Sherlock had seen the shadow it cast. But he didn’t. All of this made him anxious; like Pandora’s box he felt he should not open this part of his life any further or really at all. He didn’t like what it was doing to him, and he didn’t like how distant Sherlock seemed the longer this secret was out in the open. Not on a personal level, but on another one John didn’t understand. Mycroft’s warning rang in his head. ‘
“My dear, I do believe it’s about time you called me simply Antone. Do you not agree?” Sherlock replied, pulling her in a bit more as he led the dance.
“Right.” Sherlock looked vacant for a minute. When he came back out of it, he smiled. “Excellent. A bogle, a malevolent spirit who attacks liars and murderers.”
John didn’t realize he was still holding Sherlock’s hand until he asked for it back to buy the tickets, and neither of them spoke of it on the ride back to London.
The servant scurried away as De Mueron gestured dramatically, her arm thrown up and around. “Someone here has absconded with my property! No one leaves!”
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
“A what?” John looked between the three of them, the grey creature waving shyly when he looked at its master.
Bristling with irritated energy, he tapped his fingers on the arm of the wheelchair where he sat, waiting for his cab. He’d never have put up with this nonsense, except there was Mrs Hudson, hand on his shoulder. He’d finally made Mycroft relent, but he’d only agreed to give Sherlock the go-ahead to leave if his landlady came and gave her approval, and saw him off. Sherlock mused it was because he was supposed to have some reaction, as if seeing her would remind him not to be overly reckless. As if that were ever the case. Nonetheless, he’d made the agreement to not remove the cast on his own. With his coat on and if he held himself a certain way, most people wouldn’t notice either way.
“I’ll be entertained either way, you know that.” The Frenchman revealed a small black box with a wicked grin, and the other Shifter crumbled down into the tall grass.
“Of course it’s a bloody collar, what the fuck else would these pricks ever use?” He mumbled, trying to check for a latch or something. Sherlock was much better at this part. Where the hell was he?
The detective came in behind him, shirt and bow tie undone. “Oh good, it fits. Don’t look at me like that, this society regards Shifters like glamorous pets. And you won’t be wearing it long.”
John turned in surprise. He did not want to answer honestly, but with Sherlock that hardly mattered. “That has nothing to do with it.” He cleared his throat and spoke normally again. “How are we going to do this thing safely, then?”
Sherlock nodded, loosening the ring in the middle first. John let out a hiss as it retracted from where it was biting into his skin through the fabric underneath. “Will you tell me why you’re so angry?”
“If it’s too dangerous to be around us, there’s no way I’d ask you to come to the flat.” John laughed it off, though nervously.
“Mum wun let ‘em do anything.” Faas yawned and rested back, hands behind his head. “You’ve got more wiggle room’n most.”
Finishing enough to satisfy himself, John stood and tossed the large fluffy towel at Sherlock without looking back. “Lemme find some other clothes.” He mumbled. “Stay here until I get back, yeah?”
“Yeah…” John mumbled, remembering his toothbrush was still in the bathroom and going to fetch it. “That’s what concerns me.”
Laying on a stuffy, much too firm sofa and tossing his phone in the air, Sherlock pondered his choice to send John out on his case. He caught the mobile and tossed it again. After all, it had been less than a week ago they were having a toff over John going around anywhere right now by himself. Here, he rationalized, there were scores of Neighbors everywhere (part of the reasoning behind having the mobile out and in full sight; they didn’t like it for the most part, and therefore gave him some space. Even if they didn’t seem as taken with him as they did with John…) and that seemed to give the wolf-Shift an advantage. Besides the fact here was ‘home turf’ for him in other ways.
I referenced two ACD stories here; the Sussex Vampire and one other I hope is obvious. In the Vampire case, which I cut and shortened due to the length of the chapter, I do not mention a disability in one of the characters. This is because it has little bearing on the case itself and I thought throwing it in there would be tactless, seeming sort of like an afterthought. I will be the first to admit, I do not know if this was the right call. Please let me know in the comments if I should have included it, and if so, how to do so properly.
By the time they arrived, Bluebell had made a few very strict rules about Sherlock’s listening skills. She had the feeling he’d have ignored them much more often if John weren’t at stake. Still, she was completely drained from dealing with the detective even for a few hours, and was happy to pad along behind as he shifted gears to whatever had summoned them to St Bart’s.
“I’d already cleared this with your boss so if you have a complaint, take it up with him.” He spoke boldly into the black box he pushed to his ear against the crackling caused by the gusty environment. It looked as if it would storm soon, and the pilot of the jet Mycroft was supposed to send for them was none too happy with that possibility. “Yeah, I’d ‘feel the need’ to get him involved. Right, good then. We agree. Twenty minutes.” John brought the phone down and pushed the ‘end’ button before sliding it into his pocket with a sigh. He looked at the darkening clouds another few moments before turning to the shadows beneath the little air traffic control building. Well, more of a shack, but it still had overhanging eaves that mostly hid the stoic form of his partner. He turned with a sad frown and joined him.
Meanwhile, thinking Sherlock was still playing with the microscope upstairs, John sat and had after-dinner tea with the lady of the house. Both of them were exasperated and weary.
.” Mycroft said, and as Sherlock’s one good eye grew wide and he opened his mouth, his brother stood up and away. Two people took his place, one on either side, and steadied the car as a jack pushed it up. A third was on Sherlock, and they pulled him out onto a stretcher before releasing the jack and letting the wreckage fall back into the dirt.
“Bluebell.” Sherlock said softly, standing and approaching her. “You can say no.” He stopped about two feet back and folded his arms behind his back.
John started to get cross but stopped himself, putting the file down on Sherlock’s desk and retreating to his chair. Sherlock watched him but didn’t comment, and soon was back to looking over the file. John watched him, thinking. He’d proven beyond a doubt that he cared, he
“I suppose it depends on how you define a case. Certainly that was the first where I attempted to engage my deductions towards solving a murder.”
John turned to Moran with a fierce glare as the smoke swept around his feet. The chill and damp made him instantly feel freezing. He grabbed the mesh, which lay inside the larger metal bars to keep the smaller Shifters from getting out, with his free hand. To preemptively steady himself when his body failed him.
“Shame.” Moran tsked, resting his hands on his hips and looking up at the hatch. “Later, Johnny.” He pulled down the gas mask. Nozzles John had missed, one on either side facing into the cage and just outside the bars, hissed as they pushed white smoke at them. John stood quickly and put his hand over his face, looking around. The group huddled in the corner were already resigned, just making sure they wouldn’t injure themselves when they fell unconscious. Only Gord, baring his teeth and keeping his face far from the center of the cage, seemed to still be fighting.
John had seen it before, Dr Franklin had roamed the moors that way before they’d caught him. “I’ve never done that," he said to Faas, then turned to spit at his captors. "I don’t know how.” At least now he understood the large muzzle…
Sherlock walked over and sat on his haunches, bottle hanging loosely from his hand as it rested on his knee, and looked over Blythe very carefully.
It was the first time John had seen him as human, and he could tell why the not-so-rare Shift was taken; sparkling ice blue eyes, hair white as the face and ruff of the cat he had been, skin a deep tan… he was hardly ordinary now. He was beautiful. John scowled at the thought… whoever wanted him was likely a disgusting creature who’d lay hands on him. He looked barely 18.
Looking down and away, John raised a hand to rub over his face. “I don’t… know if we can. It was hard enough to get into one of those events, how would we possibly find where the lots went?”
“You know that.” John took his pint but kept his eyes on the DI, narrowing them. “Which Holmes sent you?” He took a draw of his beer, eyes locked and dangerous.
The Neighbor leaned in a bit, watching closely. John felt a chill in his spine, and realized this creature would be able to tell if he lied.
Shifting his weight to jut out a hip with a huff of air through his nose, John raised a brow and smirked though Mycroft couldn’t see him over the phone. “Really? You don’t need to put on airs for me.” He remarked in a faux-sweet tone. Exactly as he’d hoped, he could hear Mycroft’ breathing change as his feathers ruffled the wrong direction.
Behind him was a din of voices, but he didn’t pay them any attention. His mind started to fog and he ripped away from grabbing hands, nipping, drawing blood and curses. He was dully aware of Henry being pushed down into the mud beside him and away from the sedan, then… his mind flooded with fear as someone, he couldn’t see his vision was black, someone snapped a muzzle on him. He howled in terror, trying to yell for Sherlock, to find if Sherlock was safe, but as a full wolf he didn’t have the vocal cords to do much but yelp desperately.
” Sherlock felt his throat burn as he said the last two words, unsure if the bile rising in his throat caused it, or if it was the rage. He watched John’s face fall, took in and analysed every tick of the regimented expression that betrayed fear, hurt, anger… “It’s surgical, of course. Can’t ruin such a valuable item. The pelt can grant shapeshifting abilities, regardless of what type of Shifter it came from, most animals are accessible. They didn’t do it to any on our list, I assure you. They wouldn’t. You’re all pure breed. They prefer to use
Sherlock stood, though it looked as if he used self-restraint (who knew he had any) to keep his hands to himself. “We’ll be in the air about eleven more hours, I suggest you’re human when we land. Until then.” Sherlock sat back down in his seat and pulled out a laptop he’d gotten off one of his contacts. When he looked up again, he couldn’t see the rabbit-shift anymore.
“Here, it says when he was arrested, he admitted he deserved to be. But then he also says he’s innocent.”
Sherlock flexed his fingers, slowly unraveling from himself. Oddly, he felt less hot in the little furry animal’s body, less jittery and weak.
But John didn’t move, solid as he ever was. “Sherlock.” He raised his face to look, to be sure. His voice was still rolling off his tongue like gravel under heavy tires on a grid road. But he did not allow himself to feel relief. “We’re right here, we can’t leave them.
