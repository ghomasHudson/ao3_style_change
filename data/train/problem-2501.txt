“Yes John, I know you’ve been playing it through in your tiny little mind ever since I mentioned it…’A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread’…”
John Watson
Mycroft Holmes
Now Sherlock and John were back in 221B, Mary and the fake pregnancy was a dim and distant memory, and Lizzie had invested in noise cancelling earbuds, what with all the caterwauling and creaking of bedsprings from upstairs, the two women had planned a special Christmas present for both of them. It had been Molly’s idea originally, she’d  found the pattern free in Cat and Kittens Monthly, and tonight, probably just before the opening credits of Strictly Come Dancing’s final rolled, there would be two rather garishly patterned Christmas jumpers hanging on padded coat hangers in Lizzies wardrobe, just awaiting one evening next week when the “girls” were getting together for a mince pie, sherry, and wrapping party for two, the quality of the wrapping would very much depend on at what end of the evening the present was trussed. Molly had great plans involving ribbon, bows and matching gift cards, Lizzie was more of a cheap paper and five yards of tape girl.
“Shall we take this into the bedroom?” John asked as he felt Sherlock harden against his thigh, the taller man nodded against his chest in agreement, so John rose to his feet and made to move across the room, turning, he gave Sherlock a very lascivious wink and beckoned him with his finger.
You’ll be at your desk in a few hours. I’ll get Anthea to ring you and set up a meeting…or should I call you myself? Why must it be so complicated? What is the worst that could happen? If you turn me down, I could have you deported. I can still do that can’t I? I should get Anthea to check…
Sherlock chuckled as he watched John stir a teaspoon of honey into his tea and turn to fetch it over to him.
If I used Sherlock as the pretext for an invitation to dinner would you say yes? You know how I worry, and he has been so quiet since John moved back in. Please God let him be clean. We could eat at my club, it’s quiet and you’d like the food, it’s not too fussy. I expect you have a good appetite, would that extend to other things I wonder? I mustn’t stray too far down that road, but dear God I want to find out. You have systematically dismantled all my self-control, how did you do that? From day one, when you refused my money and told me to go to hell. Congratulations Gregory, I’ve taken up permanent residence there…
On Christmas morning neither of the nifty knitters were present as John and Sherlock opened their presents, although Lizzie was woken up by peals of laughter, which were afterwards revealed to have come from John in response to the face Sherlock pulled when he realised that he would have to wear the red and green monstrosity, covered in cats wearing elf hats and bows, during lunch at Greg and Mycroft’s house, to which both women had been invited. John’s laughter died in his throat when he opened his own parcel to reveal a large grey cat pictured sitting in the snow, the snowflakes drifting down over the royal blue background picked out by sixty four white and silver pompoms lovingly sewn on by hand.
“Mycroft. Please don’t shorten it.”
I wonder what you were thinking, looking at me like that? You always seem so damned serious, like if you smiled your face would crack right open. You should smile more often though, you're really handsome when you smile. Not as obviously pretty as your brother, but then they broke the mould when they made him, thank Christ...But there’s something about you that makes me want to get underneath that mask you wear. If you’d let me. Huh...Like you’d look at me twice? A shabby old cop who’s not had a date since his wife walked out 3 years ago. Yeah, what a catch…
“I don’t think you can know that, though,” Sherlock counters, but he lets John pull him in anyway. “Not for sure. There are a lot of would-be Moriartys out there, you know. Lots of would-be Marys, too.”
It’s been fifteen hours and countless kisses since John woke up that morning, and everything is different now.
did that you have to keep paying for so that things can go back to the way they were—you don’t, all right? Debts cancelled. I don’t even
And looking at Sherlock in the flickering light, for the first time, John feels like he can
“What is this place?” John had asked finally, following Sherlock in and looking over the hodge-podge little sitting room.
“Because you’re an idiot,” John says, as fondly as he can manage around the cold in his gut. He takes the empty wine glass out of Sherlock’s hand and sets it on the table again. “You weren’t fine either, were you?”
After a moment, his toes start to drag back and forth again through the water. Back and forth. Back and forth.
, John, honestly, I’m not
“Hey,” John soothes, “Hey. Of course it’s been enough, Sherlock. It would’ve been enough if it had only been once, yeah, and you’ve solved hundreds of cases. Some really important cases. You solved
“Don’t finish that sentence.”
It wasn’t the laughter, though, that had made John pay attention. It had been the silence in the wake of it—the way Sherlock ducked his head and studied his hands when the story came to an end, the quiet turning thick and contemplative, a little melancholy in the low light of the kitchen.
John looks at him. His gentle hands, his cautious eyes. The fire is barely hanging on to flame, holding them both in eerie, flickering shadow, and it feels like just a step away now, just within arm’s reach—all that grief, and all that fear, and all that doubt.
It does hurt. It is horrifying. But John is neither shocked nor surprised—only determined. He know that Sherlock knows they are in this for good. He knows that Sherlock knows that John will follow him anywhere, whether to bad restaurants or right into bed. And he knows that Sherlock knows that John wants—wants this, wants this life, wants him.
There, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder at the end of a rickety dock, with a fishing pole balanced precariously against John’s knee with only one hand holding it steady, the other hand holding onto Sherlock, holding
He looks at Sherlock, at his toes swishing back and forth through the water, scaring away any fish that might have been inclined to investigate their baits, and thinks about the chances he might still be missing.
John laughs. “Yeah, right,” he says. “You play the violin when you’re thinking. I remember.”
“Yes,” he breathes, rolling back onto his side. “John, I—yes. Of course. Obviously.”
They stand, for a moment, just standing, just breathing. John breathes deep and even, drawing one hand up Sherlock’s back and then down again, guiding his own breath, in and out, in and out, in,
Not surprising, John thinks, with a wry smile. Sherlock always looks beautiful when he’s thinking.
“You should see your face,” Sherlock had said then, his smirk contorting into a full-out laugh. “You look like I’ve just shoved you out onto the street without so much as a how-do-you-do. It’s an
“Easiest deduction in the world, isn’t it? If you didn’t love me, I wouldn’t be here. At this cottage, in this bed, I just—would probably still be married off to someone else and struggling to keep my head above water. Or maybe I’d already have drowned. But you love me, so I’m here, and I need you to know this because it’s important, all right?” He waits until Sherlock sighs and nods his head. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t love you.”
“Forever, then.”
“The life together, or the crime-solving?”
And they turn to face each other in the dark.
Sherlock likes it too, if the way he relaxes into it is anything to go by. He seems familiar with it, though he doesn’t say how, or why. John doesn’t ask.
“What made today the right time?”
Sherlock is a warm, sticky mess beside him in the bed, sweat-damp and beautiful. He’s staring up at the ceiling, but he’s smiling, so that’s all right.
That’s the magic of him.
John thinks about this, and he thinks about why Sherlock is thinking about this, and he bends to set the mug of tea down next to a bunch of daisies, rotating the base a little into the dirt so it stays put, and then he pulls Sherlock into him. Sherlock doesn’t unfold himself, doesn’t uncross his arms, but he lets John pull him to his chest, lets John hold him with both hands.
“Countryside. Nothing dangerous; wear something comfortable. I’ve got your toiletries together already, bring a change of clothes or two.” There had been a pause, and the hand on John’s wrist lifted away. “Two, I think.”
The whole place feels like a secret treasure, a hidden sanctuary tucked away into an English countryside that feels more like wilderness than farmland. There’s something almost sacred about it, about the pillars of the trees and the vaulting arch of the sky, and as John watches Sherlock pass through the neatly trimmed garden and out into the meadow beyond, the long grasses and bright wildflowers reaching all the way up to his knees, John feels like he’s only just brushed the surface of everything there is to discover here.
John had taken Sherlock’s face in both his hands then, brushing his thumbs over Sherlock’s cheeks, and he’d kissed Sherlock, just once, hard and a little fierce. “I said it every single day that you were gone, Sherlock Holmes,” he finally managed, resting their foreheads together. “I said it
“Good,” John says, and kisses him.
“John,” he says, clearing his throat, eyes darting away into the shadows. “It’s fine.”
He sees sunshine.
, and John had kissed Sherlock up against the trunk of some great oak until they were both trembling with it and he’d had to step away.
“Put me into your mind palace?”
, Sherlock. It’s just what you do. And it’s been brilliant, and fantastic, and so will anything else you decide to do. So do whatever you want, all right? Try a few things on. Be a writer. Get a half a dozen dogs and drive us both crazy. Be a beekeeper, or a gardner, or take up knitting, if you like. Become a pirate finally.” Sherlock laughs. “Doesn’t really matter, Sherlock. Are you happy being a consulting detective? Are you excited, when a new case comes in?”
He lets John kiss him, gently, and if John pours everything inside him into making his kiss feel like a promise, like a vow, Sherlock’s feels like one too.
When the evening had wrapped itself firmly around the cottage, they’d gone back inside together, rummaging through the fridge for something to make for dinner. John had found himself making spaghetti carbonara while Sherlock had sat on the edge of the table, telling him a story about a dog he’d had as a boy, laughing and gesturing.
Sherlock shrugs, pulling back just enough to reach down beside them and pick up the mug of tea again. It’s probably gone cold from its seat in the cool, shadowed dirt, but Sherlock just wipes off the bottom a little and takes a sip before offering it to John, who shakes his head.
John thinks he’s beginning to understand why they’re here.
Sherlock breathes out. “However improbable—”
It’s about cataloguing, the careful way he kisses John’s palm and the cautious way he skates his fingers up John’s ribs, taking John’s shirt with him, up and up, over and off, like he’s making notes to go over later, like he’s keeping track of something for himself. Recreating John in his mind’s eye.
“Stay with me, Sherlock,” John whispers into his dark curls, laying his palm flat so he can feel the beating of Sherlock’s heart, so very like his own. Strong now, beating slow and even, beautiful as the breeze creaking through the eaves.
things to go back to the way they were. I want things to be the way they
. We’ve been separated. Apart, from each other, and I just. I just want to live our life together now. Any kind of life.”
“Well,” Sherlock says, smile cracking at the corner of his mouth, “maybe a bit better than all right.”
He sees a chance to get away, a chance to slow down, a chance to finally take some time for just themselves. Paris. Cairo. Bangkok. He sees French villas in the countryside, long rows of grape vines that smell sweet and earthy in the afternoon sun, fruit that makes Sherlock’s mouth taste dark and luscious. He sees tall windows looking out over foreign skies, the heart-pumping excitement of the crowds in the marketplaces, the sound of different languages in Sherlock’s voice. Ancient wonders and modern marvels, tourist traps and hidden gems. Flowers tucked behind Sherlock’s ear that he’ll scoff at and blush over but won’t take out.
“So you do know.”
“You’ve had plenty of partners you didn’t—”
at you, and it was so stupid, Sherlock, because I was so
Sherlock kisses him back.
“John,” Sherlock says, and John can hear him rolling his eyes, “don’t be obtuse.” He pulls back to look at John properly, his eyes cleared if a little pink, his mouth softened, and he adds, “I thought it was the right time too. Well, bit late, maybe, but then I always am waiting for you to catch up—”
John almost laughs, thinking of all the different times and all the different ways he’s imagined kissing Sherlock. “I’d have kissed you at the breakfast table at 221B yesterday morning, too, if I’d thought it was the right time.”
John looks at Sherlock, laid out on an old worn sofa with a sag in the middle and throw pillows that smell like cherry pipe tobacco, and he sees an answer to every question he had ever wanted to ask.
“John,” Sherlock says gently, guiding his gaze back to Sherlock’s with two fingers on his chin. He cranes his neck up, kisses John softly. “You are a good man. You
There’s a fog rising off the surface of the lake, settling low around the bulrushes, curving around the bases of the old oaks along the edge. The sunrise has been a creeping, lazy thing, peaking only here and there through the clouds, and other than the occasional birdsong, there’s nothing but the sound of Sherlock’s toes, dragging slowly back and forth through the water.
“We’re going to be all right,” Sherlock says, minutes later, or hours, maybe. He’s ended up on his back, stretched out underneath John with one hand petting over John’s lower back as if to make sure he doesn’t slip away. His hair is a mess from being pressed into the cushions and it makes him look unbearably soft; John doesn’t bother to resist the temptation to slip his fingers into the curls. “Things are going to change, but we’ll be all right. We aren’t the men we once were, and I think—it’s okay. Good, even.”
Nipple tight and erection now straining in his pants, Sherlock fought to keep his voice even. “Is it common practice to attempt intercourse with produce?”
“Take the lube,” John said, grabbing the tube from the side table. “And coat the rod, then smear it into the slit. Get everything as wet as fucking possible.”
When he finished chasing the tease of his own hand on his prick, Sherlock reached for John—sliding John's warm palms around his hips, and planting them on the curve of his arse.
, and I return the look with a challenging arch of my eyebrow.
Compelled by something he couldn't explain, Sherlock placed a gentle kiss to the skin. Marking it with reverence.
“Neither did I, until a few hours ago.”
I slip my hand down between my legs, palm at the ridge of my aching cock. It’s almost too much—the friction sending shivers of pleasure up my spine as the weight of John’s prick on my tongue reminds me of why I’m on my knees. Through the haze of it all, I realize I’m only a few strokes away from coming in my pants. And that’s fine. More than fine. Oddly poetic, given how this all started.
Buttercup.
“Most humans are scared. Even if they voluntarily seek our company, they still have an instinctual fear. Something in the hindbrain that says
But John did. He broke away, smearing his lips across Sherlock’s jaw and groaning into his neck. “God, you’re so hard,” he murmured into warm skin. “Like a fucking iron rod.”
Officially looking for a tactical retreat, Sherlock pushed past the DI and approached the bodies. “There’s an actual crime with actual victims, Lestrade. Let's focus on that, shall we?”
Nothing could have prepared him for the flood of arousal that nearly takes him out at the knees. John's mouth is commanding, capturing Sherlock’s top lip, bottom lip, top again. His tongue plays against Sherlock’s with soft brushes and teasing flicks. And when John pulls away, Sherlock can't help but chase after him.
The petting had started off innocent, with John's small, warm hand running up and down his side, his hip, his thigh. His fingers had played in the patch of hair on Sherlock’s chest, followed the line that ran down from his navel, and tickled at the trimmed thatch over his pubic bone. Not overtly sexual. Just a gentle petting.
He laid down next to John, pressed into his side, and began to trace his fingertips across John's skin. He didn't always indulge like this. In fact, most of his meals were taken with brisk detachment. But John smiled at him, talked with him. And,
“I was in the middle of an experiment when you texted,” Sherlock answered, relieved by the confidence in his tone.
He spears into me, hot and wet—stretching my rim around the point of his tongue and curling deep. And,
“Sherlock. . .”
Thrilling.
“Hair accessories don't ascribe to any particular gender,” Sherlock snapped, a touch offended. “And no. It holds the hair out of my eyes while I'm working.”
“You want more? Tell me you want more.”
Here is the next installment of this varitable porn parade! Enjoy some lactation kink!
. But,
He shifts down, mouthing just under my jaw. His teeth scrape along my throat and I gasp, turn my head, whisper, “God yes.”
Towels and sheets rearranged, Sherlock curled up against John's side, one leg tossed over his hip and arm slung low over his stomach.
John smiled—a warm, fond look that reminded Sherlock of murmured confessions and tender kisses. He shifted in his seat. “Did you like it?”
“Okay. But why does it have cat ears?”
I press my lips against his ear and whisper, “Finger me.”
He shudders, full bodied. “God.”
John sighed and let his head fall to the side. “Yeah, I guess.”
Sherlock slides his hands up John’s thighs, his hips. He slips them under John’s jumper and feels the heat of his skin. His fingers trace this newfound landscape—up the angle of John's waist, over his ribs and down his back. He desperately wants to see what he’s touching, but doesn’t want to pull away long enough to remove John’s jumper. John shivers, smiles, and seems to read Sherlock's mind as he grabs the hem and pulls the shirt over his head.
It felt as if the air had been sucked out of the room. I couldn’t breathe through this vacuum of depravity. So I did the only thing a person could do in such a situation. I bore down.
“I'm not.” Sherlock whispered, mouth against John’s ear. “This is all you. Neurochemicals and hormones. Want and desire. Need. You need this, John.”
“Mike’s out, but I don't know when he's planning on coming back,” John explains as he pulls Sherlock into his room. “We won't be interrupted in here.”
“It was great. For the first thirty seconds,” John admitted. “But the skin fell apart after about a dozen strokes. After that it was just wanking with a fistful of warm mush.”
, that’s fantastic. It takes everything I have to not just throw my head back and howl, but I want to see the heat, the conflagration, that flares up in his eyes as I begin to ride him.
John laughs. “Of course I knew. You may be a genius but you're not all that clever sometimes. I could see right through you.”
“Oh. I think I can get a bit more creative than that.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock taunted. “Help the detective inspector see why this isn’t one of his victims.”
John blinked his eyes open and looked dazedly down at Sherlock. “Give me a minute. I just. . .” he sighed, almost a whine. “I need a minute.”
“Yeah?”
“Nghuh-huh.” John nods.
He darts a quick look around the cafe, as if anything has changed in the last few minutes. It’s still the same milling students and preoccupied office workers—people far too focused on getting their caffeine fix to notice the man in the corner slip his hand under the table. John trails his fingers along the inseam of his shorts, scoots down in his chair, and cups his palm at the apex of his legs.
“I don't.”
“Jesus.” John pulled back the blanket with a gasp.
I drop my head back against the wall with a thud. “Christ. We’re never going to get anywhere like this.”
“Oh my God,” I groan, mortified. “I'm leaking.”
“John…” A high, thin whine.
He reached down, took his plumpened cock in hand, strafed his fingers over the slippery head. "Oh, John," he gasped. He squeezed himself, milking more clear fluid from his prick. "John, I'm so wet. John. . ."
“Good kitties don't touch themselves.” He’d said as he peeled off Sherlock’s clothes and gave his half-hard prick a stroke. “Show me you can be a good kitty and I’ll pet you.”
He ducked under the police tape and made his way to Lestrade, long strides and billowing coat taking him down the alley. “Have you managed to keep your team from trampling the crime scene?”
I swivel my hips—feel the tip slip around my rim, tease at my hole. Again and again, pressing down a bit harder with each pass, letting the head slip a little deeper, a little deeper. Finally, I settle my weight—letting gravity and my own grasping, hungry hole take over.
John looked back up, a proud smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, and didn’t say a word as he began to work at Sherlock’s flies. Sherlock joined him, making quick work of his shirt buttons. They left the clothes in a pile on the landing, to be tended to along with the other soiled laundry that the evening would undoubtedly produce.
“There you go,” Sherlock says, a low rumble that makes the hairs at my nape stand on end.
“How many men have you been with?” Sherlock asked, hand skating from John’s hip, up his side, cupping against his ribs.
"Fuck!" He gasped. Then, raggedly, "John!"
Sherlock didn't know how much longer he could wait to sink his teeth in.
I know sounding isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed writing this so I hope y'all give it a shot!
John's grip spasmed, fingers tightening, relaxing, tightening again. He pulled Sherlock in closer, suckled him down. His breath huffed through his nose, tickling at the trimmed thatch of Sherlock's pubic hair.
I’ve got half his shirt buttons undone and he’s managed to push my jumper up to my armpits and open my belt, when laughter finally overtakes us.
John scoops his fingers under what are surely come-heavy bollocks, and closes his hand. He pulls, releases, pulls again. His left hand has moved to the head, kneading. I zoom in, and
“But you have the patience now. Oh—” Sherlock sucked in a breath as John’s hand slipped under fabric, fingers unerringly seeking out the hard bud that had been teased into exquisite sensitivity.
“Forensic Examiner.” He turns the page with a quiet rustle.
John smiles and Sherlock can feel the curve of lips against his too hot, too tight skin. “Is that a yes?”
"Fuck.
I want all of those things too—
Sherlock looks up and around, as if he’s forgotten where they are. “What for?”
He clenched and released his arsehole in a bid to draw John's attention, and rumbled deep in his chest when those three slick fingers plunged deep. The tingling returned twice as strong and Sherlock could feel himself leaking steadily. Everything from the tip of his cock, to his hanging bollocks, to his stretched rim, radiated warmth and pleasure. It pulsed deep and spread like hundreds of fingers stroking him. It was nearly unbearable and he sobbed out cries of pure bliss as the sensation built and built and—
With the flip of a switch low light diffused through the room, like a warm summer evening, tinting the world gold. “Sorry about that,” Sherlock said, closing the door and turning to his meal. “My brother has a condition that makes him an insufferable prat.”
Loathe as he would be to admit it, Sherlock was a bit enamored.
John twists again and that’s when I feel it. A warmth sliding down chest.
And there it was, just under the skin—the quickening thump of pulse that accompanied a rush of adrenaline. But was it fear that had John’s heart racing? Or excitement?
“Don't play with your food, Sherlock,” he chided, his tone the tedious drawl of exasperation at correcting his little brother's social foibles.
John looked back, puzzled. “Yeah. I mean, it’s pretty much standard procedure. Most vamp—er... hemophages—”
“Quickly,” I say, sharp and commanding.
“John.”
Sherlock felt a sympathetic twitch in his own pants, and for the first time that evening, he acknowledge his own aching need. It wasn't uncommon for the act of feeding to result in an erection, but it was rare for Sherlock to feel an urge to actually do something about it. It was a side effect, little more.
I have a fleeting thought of dexterity. Of clever fingers running up and down a fingerboard, coaxing beautiful music from the strings of a violin. Those same fingers are coaxing quite a different sound from me now.
“Ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh.”
Knowing that he'd been caught out should have been embarrassing in the extreme. But. It wasn't. To know that there was a voyeur, however unintentional, to this facet of his life was actually. . . a bit titillating. He'd been on display, vulnerable to anybody observant enough to notice. Perhaps it wasn't the humiliation itself, but the threat of it that Sherlock found so intriguing.
And here we have my first foray into water sports. That's right... we got piss kink on the horizon.
John laughed, amused but not at all teasing. “What guy hasn't. How'd it go?”
By the time he pulls back for breath I’m babbling into the sheets, cursing and begging. Without his face tucked between my cheeks, I can feel cool air against my saliva-drenched skin.
The first touch—the press like a wet kiss against my pucker—makes me gasp. It's foreign and familiar all at once. It drives me wild. I want to slam down, ride him hard and fast.
After the wind down—the twelve hours of sleep, two servings of panang curry, and a thorough dicking down by one, John Watson—Sherlock retreated to the catacombs of his mind palace. Processing the case was hardly a task. No. There was something else that required examination.
“Why should it be?” Sherlock leaned in closer and laid his hand high on John’s thigh. “You of all people know I like to experiment.”
John scoots up Sherlock’s torso, stops when his knees are nearly in Sherlock’s armpits. He's so close, Sherlock can feel the heat rolling off of him, smell the musk of John’s arousal. And still, Sherlock wants more.
And he was coming, pulsing down John's throat. Emptying himself again.
He sat down next to John, crowding up against him, feeling his warmth and the steady beat of his heart. His hand skimmed up John’s throat and over his jaw, cradling his head. He dropped his face to John’s neck, ran his nose along the thrumming pulse, and inhaled John’s scent—the tang of sweat and sweet aroma of pheromones. Thirst clouded his thoughts, but he quelled it and cleared his mind.
“You could just get a haircut,” Lestrade said, teasing but not unkind. And just like that, it was dropped.
John gives Sherlock a slow smile. “Care to elaborate?”
John pulled away and brought his come-covered hand to his own aching prick, stroking himself in a flurry. He’d been so focused on the beauty of Sherlock’s exposed undercarriage—his hanging cock and balls, that delicate seam tracing up the ridge of his perineum, and the delicious furl of his anus—that John had ignored his own need. But now, in the wake of Sherlock’s moaning, trembling climax, John felt it keenly.
Sherlock groans. “Don't be absurd.”
I stand up, dust off my filthy knees. “You wouldn’t have me any other way.”
Sherlock went limp, but John didn't remove his fingers. He pulled back to play with his rim, giving him a moment of reprieve. But it didn't last. As soon as Sherlock caught his breath, John's fingers were sliding deep once more, rubbing a small circle against his prostate and stoking the flames again.
A case, a chat, and one thing leads to another.
They’d been snogging under the heavy down duvet for ages. Like bloody teenagers. Exchanging body heat with roaming hands and panting breaths until John had to come up for air.
John sits back, a look of consternation on his face. “Oh, God. Is this where you tell me you have a boyfriend?”
“Oh, God. John.” Sherlock moaned, breath catching in his throat. “John I'm already so close.”
Sherlock presses the blunt pads of his thumbs in, sliding them alongside his slick shaft, and tugs. John goes half delirious with the sensation. He groans so low and so loud, he can hardly believe it’s his own voice.
John whimpered. “Yeah. Yeah, do that. But slow.”
Sherlock scoffed, though more out of reflex than actual offense—for once Lestrade wasn't being hyperbolic.
He’s fully hard now—a fucking lead pipe running down his thigh—and not for the first time, do I consider just how lucky I am.
This chapter underwent a few different iterations in my head, but I think it's safe to say that this is just about the best idea I could have had. Special shout out to everyone in The Chat (tm) that helped shape this into the grossly inappropriate, deliciously sexy fic that it is!
He stroked up to the head, then stilled. Squeezed. Slowly, as if unsure, Sherlock rolled his back and flexed his buttocks. When John offered no correction, he did it again—thrusting into John’s fist.
His brow lifts, his expression surprised at first, then patiently expectant. His hands continue to move.
“Good,” John mewled. “More.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is for you." John held out the glass of water.
He fucks into my mouth once, twice, then buries himself deep into my throat as he unloads. His hips roll in time with each hot pulse and I swallow and swallow.
Finally spent, John fell back on his heels. His hands drifted to Sherlock’s hips, his forehead dropped to the plush curve of Sherlock’s arse. He panted against come-stained skin and tried to calm his racing heart.
Sherlock grins. “Like I said, he was an idiot.”
The cab rounded the corner to Baker Street and Sherlock's bladder pulsed, a delicious reminder of what was about to come. He savored these last few minutes—didn't rush as he paid the cabbie, took unhurried strides across the threshold and up the stairs. The urgency was there, but he denied it.
Sherlock pulled back and licked his lips, tasted salt and musk. John ran his fingers through his hair again, pushing it off his brow. He smiled down at Sherlock with such adoration that Sherlock had to wonder what he saw. Eagerness certainly, submission perhaps. The idea didn't bother Sherlock as much as he might have once thought.
John held himself just behind the crown of his cock and pressed in—dipped the very tip into the divot of Sherlock’s hole. It sucked at him, pulled him in another fraction of an inch, and John shuddered. He pulled back, rubbed around the pucker, and teased in again. He held there, pumping his tight fist along his shaft and letting the movement of his hand urge his cock to slide in… in…
He huffs a laugh and I look up to see him shaking his head, fond amusement gleaming in his eyes. But he doesn’t protest. He slips his hand back and grips the base of his cock firmly. A little shake of his wrist and the length of his erection moves up and down. The distended fabric shifts, the sheen and shadow undulating around the contour of his prick.
finally
My cock surges in my pants.
Sherlock pushed back—no patience for John’s overly solicitous tendencies. He rolled his hips, encouraging John's prick the slide deeper, and deeper still. Until he bottomed out with a grunt of relief.
John shrugs and settles back against Sherlock’s chest. “It was fun to pretend.”
"Roll over,” he said, a hushed command. “Put that gorgeous arse in the air.”
Sherlock ducked his head, looked at John from under his lashes. “I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.”
He sags back, panting, and rubs his hands over my rotund belly. The baby is kicking, no doubt in response to my elevated heart rate and the flood of orgasm induced endorphins. He presses his hand down and grins fondly.
Sherlock leaves her sputtering at the door and saunters across the room, his eyes locked in John. One of the people at John’s table must notice his trajectory, because they perk up and point. When John turns around, everything seems to slow down.
“Bit obvious isn't it?”
There must be something in my tone that conveys my sheer desperation, because he doesn't hesitant to withdraw his fingers and move around the mattress. He settles back and looks up at me with a kind of curious expectancy.
“Not as a dildo, no,” John answered, a bit chagrined. “I cored it, warmed it up in the microwave and wanked with it.”
John pressed a soft kiss into Sherlock's hair. And another. And one more. "Anytime, love. Anytime."
I grab his hands and pull them up, slide his palms over my shuddering core, and bring them to rest on my chest. I guide his fingers to pinch at my nipples.
John returned his attention to the body—with its blank, bloodshot eyes and bruising across his throat. “The signs of strangulation are all there, just like the other three victims. . .”
“How long have you been like this?” John asked, ghosting his fingers along the prominent veins of Sherlock’s shaft.
“Here we are, gents,” the cabbie barked, apparently not keen to have two grown men dry humping in the backseat.
“What's in the full experience?” John’s question carried the slightest hint hesitation.
The woman wrung the tissue in her hands. “I don’t know—”
I was harder than I’d ever been, teetering on the edge of orgasm—but my body refused to let me fall. Just a few strokes. That was all I’d need.
about to piss his pants.
“So exactly how many chemistry labs have you blown up?” John asks. He shifts in his seat, turns closer. His foot taps against Sherlock’s.
“What?” Lestrade blinked, then bristled. “All right. First, you hardly solve
John didn't flinch. He noticed—of course he noticed—but he didn't flinch. “Does that mean you're also gonna turn out to be an insufferable prat?”
“I didn't have that much patience at fourteen.” John’s fingers had turned purposeful, slipping buttons open down the front of Sherlock’s shirt.
John held up an arm, pulled the sleeve of his t-shirt up, and displayed his biceps. Sherlock’s eyes were drawn to the firm, round belly of the muscle and the hint of blue ribbons that ran just under the skin.
My mouth skims over the cutting edge of his cheekbone and he tips his head back, meeting me halfway. I close my lips over his, and my tongue teases at the seam of his mouth, poised to slip inside the second he opens up. The temperature in our immediate proximity cranks from simmering to scorching as my tongue slides against his. Our breaths rasp out, lust-drenched and ragged, as his fingers clench and his hips kick up harder. I pull away before we completely lose control and look directly into his eyes—wild verdigris swamped by ink black.
“Can I suck you?” Sherlock asked, more a plea than a request. “When you come, can I wrap my lips around your cock and have you come down my throat?”
Lestrade huffed. “She’s in the kitchen, but Sherlock. Try to be nice, yeah? She’s pregnant and she just found her husband dead in the bathroom.”
When John scoots his chair closer to scribble his corrections on Sherlock’s paper, Sherlock lets his knee fall wide. It brushes it against John's, the contact sending a thrill through him. John doesn't back away.
“All right.” Sherlock sat back on his heels and held up the crochet hook, holding like an orchestral conductor would hold a wand. “Now what?”
John took a sip of water. "I've been waiting a bloody age. Ready?"
When Sherlock can once again open his eyes again, he sees John straddling his hips, one hand shoved down the front of his open jeans. He looks a bit lost—a bit wild—as he strokes himself. Sherlock leans up, reaches out, and demands, “Come here.”
“You want more?” John asked, kissing Sherlock’s hip. “Take it.”
Sherlock spun on his heel and began his search—behind the aquarium and under the table—jingling all the while. Ignoring John’s protestations, he climbed over a chair. Indelicate in the display of his arse, he bent over the back and reached down.
John whimpered, hips rolling in time to the frantic pace of Sherlock's strokes. “P-pull it out. Oh God. So close.”
"Say it," John groaned, breathless.
Some part of my mind is shouting—a primitive response to the feral quality of Sherlock’s voice.
A spike of arousal crackles through me, white hot and so intense that I almost come on the spot.
Sherlock squints down at the reaction mechanism he's written out, presses his lips together in a show of concentration. Of course he knows where he went wrong. Just like he knew the error he’d fabricated in last week's S1 reaction and the nomenclature mistakes he’d made the week before. But it would make for a rather boring tutoring session if he got everything right all the time.
"For whatever it's worth, if you ever need anything... you just let me know."
Sherlock ground down, swiveling his hips to stir up the most sensation he could. John was right there.
I press into him, reach down and cup him through his shorts. He groans extravagantly and pulls his hand back just enough to catch the waistband. I help him tug his shorts down his hips, let the stretch of elastic press his cock down and down and down, until it springs up, throbbing crimson and wet at the tip.
“Come, Sherlock,” John growled into the hot, wet skin. “Come on.” He smeared his tongue around his rI’m and pushed in as deep as he could.
John’s body rolled, undulating from head to toe. His feet caught on the bedding as he pushed himself up into Sherlock’s mouth. “Yeah,” he panted, tossing his head against the pillow. “More.”
Sherlock hums in agreement. “I guess he didn't appreciate my correction. Or when I questioned how he managed to tie his shoes in the morning. So he tried to embarrass me. He asked if I was so smart, why don't I just recite the Periodic Table.”
John traced his fingers over the tips of Sherlock’s ear and hummed in consideration. “I think I'll be free. Did you have something in mind?”
John smoothed his other hand over Sherlock’s arse—palmed that luscious curve—then, mindful of his rhythm, lowered his face once more. He laved his tongue over and around Sherlock’s hole, flicked and licked. Sherlock cried out at the touch, pushing back harder and bearing down to offer up his greedy hole to John’s probing tongue.
came.
John squeezes his hand, runs it along the inseam. “A little.”
He has a sense of being on the verge of discovery—about to learn something as profound as gravity, as momentous as splitting the atom. He pulls at the waistband of John’s boxers and hooks them under his round, full bollocks.
Sherlock nods, unable to form even the simplest words at the moment. Maybe he pulls back, maybe John pushes him. Either way, they tumble onto the bed, with John on top.
“Wait.” John was breathless as he tugged at Sherlock’s curls. “You can do that again once we’ve got this thing in.”
Sprawled out and indolent, Sherlock held his phone out. Head tilted down and bottom lip caught between teeth, he snapped picture after picture—sending John a series of increasingly lewd poses.
Sherlock gripped the slick rod, pulled out and eighth of an inch. A quarter. Then, with the care and precision he’d apply to his most delicate experiment, pushed it back in.
After what was surely not much more than an hour, but felt to Sherlock decidedly more like a decade of cascading euphoria, John slipped his fingers out. He stroked his clean hand down Sherlock’s back and reached with the other between Sherlock’s legs. John tugged at his heavy bollocks and tutted at the low fricative—the beginning of a not very kitty-like
. But you. You don't seem very afraid.”
In the stack of milk crates that served as a bookcase, he found his answer. “A lionfish...” Oh. “Oh!”
Sherlock swallows. “Hello, John.” He cringes inwardly at the formality in his tone. Relax. “Have you been here long?”
“Sherlock!”
“I’d say.” John gave him a sympathetic squeeze. “God. Just look at you.“
I'm sitting at my own, low table, about fifteen feet away. From this seat I've an unobstructed view of John—shifting in his chair as his eyes dart around the bustling cafe. I can't help but feel a bit like a child playing Spy, except I'm 21 years old and this little game is anything but child's play.
“Oh...
Sherlock cocks his head. “Going where?”
I gasp as hot spit lands squarely on my anus. That was. . . unexpected. But in no way unappreciated.
I reach back, feel his hand spreading my cheeks wide, and back farther to weave my fingers into his silky curls. Tug. “Sherlock. . .” I moan, breathless with the relentless roll of his tongue just inside my body. “Yes, Sherlock. Eat me out.
“I've had all types of clients.” John answered, a smooth deflection.
. That’s perfect. Brilliant.
“Good boy,” John murmured. He ran his hand, a slick, tight circle, along Sherlock’s length. “Now. Fuck my fist.”
He doesn’t hesitate this time, instead running his hand slowly over the shaft. A more defined bulge is starting to form behind the slick, silver fabric and he lengthens his strokes.
He fucks Sherlock like he’s cutting out his own heart and offering it to Sherlock’s pleasure.
John’s tongue slipped out, broad and flat, and Sherlock whispered—whimpered—"John…“
“When I was a teenager.” Sherlock answered. His hand slid unconsciously to his throat. “I used the sash of my dressing gown and a slippery hitch knot.”
He opened his mouth.
It wasn’t an empty platitude. Not just a sweet nothing meant to make Sherlock shiver. No. Sherlock was harder—thicker—than John could remember him ever being before. His hand stretched wide around the hot shaft as he pumped and pumped.
“That’s not—those aren't public spaces, Sherlock,” John said with a huff, and Sherlock knew he’d scored a point, even on a technicality.
In one smooth motion, Sherlock slid the crochet hook out of John’s slit and replaced it with his own pointed, probing tongue. He only had a second to spare a thought for the bitter taste of lube before warm, salty come flooded his mouth.
With feral cobalt eyes and the hungry flash of a smile, John flipped me onto my stomach. He leaned over me—one hand on my hip, the other on my shoulder—and nuzzled into my curls. Not gentle, but base; not sweet, but scenting. His lips brushed against my ear as he growled for me to hold on to the headboard.
John pressed against Sherlock’s frenulum, slipped his tongue over the weeping slit, and rolled it around the plump head—once, twice. He sank his mouth down, letting Sherlock’s girth part his lips and stretch his jaw with every inch. Where he would normally bury his face in the musky tickle of Sherlock’s pubes, tonight his nose barely brushed against the springy dark curls. He moaned—part disappointment, part fascination.
The tips of Sherlock's fingers tucked under the hem of John’s pants, tickling at the crease of pelvis and leg. So hot. Blood pulsing. The craving damn near impossible to ignore. John whimpered and it rang in Sherlock’s ear like a siren song. He was drawn in, drawn down.
“Or.” Sherlock lifted himself up, no longer sitting on his heels. “You can sit there in an orgasmic haze while I use your body like a canvas for my spunk.”
“No.” Sherlock moved his hand, trailed his fingers up John’s blushing chest. “No. Of course not. But it isn't a binary system. There’s all manner of possibilities. Tell me, what is it about being with a man that you enjoy most?” Sherlock skimmed John's throat, jaw, lips. “The scent? The hard angles? The feel of a hard cock between your lips? Or pounding in your arse?”
"Not the first time you've said that."
John croaked, a moan cut off before given a chance to fully form. Sherlock smirked. He’d always enjoyed a challenge.
“Sherlock. . . What’s? Oh. Oh!” In the span of about five seconds, John's voice morphs from confused to understanding to pleasantly surprised.
Pressure and pleasure are building, radiating, warning me in lapping waves that I don’t have long. “Getting close,” I growl.
“Why not?”
“Basilic and cephalic veins. Safe and discreet,” Sherlock said approvingly. He cupped his palm over the muscle, pressed his fingers in, and ran his thumb over the warm skin. “Oh, and yours are beautiful—nice and fat.”
He moans, full throated and unrestrained.
The wet staccato of John’s strokes was torturous, bringing visions of small, capable hands wrapped around a ruddy, wet glans. The glide of pinked foreskin over a fat, flaring crown. Sherlock could only whimper.
, you arrogant knob. And second, it's a little difficult to concentrate when you're wearing that.” Lestrade gestured with a jut of his chin, his eyes focused on Sherlock’s hair.
Pleasure surges through me and I moan, deep and resonate, as I come—throbbing inside my trousers, spilling into my pants. My body shudders through the aftershocks and I can do little more than hold my aching jaw open for John's pumping cock.
He drops his head back and curses at the ceiling. “Christ.”
John dragged his eyes over Sherlock’s gilt body. Christ the man was beautiful. He kneaded the dense muscle at the top of Sherlock’s thighs, framing is deeply flushed cock and hanging bollocks—wanting nothing more than to lavish him with pleasure.
There was moaning and slurping and a high pitched whine that turned out to be my own voice caught in my throat. His lips were soft, but his stubble scratched. And nothing in my life had felt as wicked or as wonderful as the flick and probe of his tongue inside my leaking hole.
So Sherlock had put up the Goddamn poster.
. The cascade of responses was instant. His shoulders dropped down and back, his spine went loose, and his cock plumped. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table and crawled onto the bed.
John shuddered, his eyes fluttering closed. He brought the hand under his head down to encircle Sherlock’s wrist and pull him back. “Jesus.” He was breathless. Delectable. “I thought you said you weren't going to enthrall me.”
John pressed fractionally harder, dragging his middle finger more firmly over Sherlock's prostate as he pulled back to the first knuckle, then sank back in. A little faster. A little rougher. Teasing at Sherlock until he was trembling, bucking back, and crying out, “O-oh, God! Yes!”
. But Sherlock can only blink dumbly. It sounds like a chat up line. But why would John. . . “Oh!”
Heat and pressure build, until I’m ready to explode, a brimming supernova of pleasure. I slam back down, burying him deep and clawing my way from the precipice. Quite literally, it turns out, as I look down to see the pink furrows I’ve left on Sherlock’s chest. He doesn’t seem to have noticed—he’s got his hands wrapped tight around my hips, pulling me hard onto his cock.
He starts slow, carving into Sherlock’s body with careful consideration. But that pace simply cannot be maintained. His thrusts grow faster, stronger—until they’re frenzied, grunting things.
John’s fingers sank into his curls, blunt nails scratching at his scalp. “You know this doesn't mean you're not still in trouble.”
. His fingers dug into the flesh of Sherlock's arse, pulled him down roughly even as his hips kicked up harder.
He’s lost all that carefully crafted composure. With eyes half-lidded and rosy pink lips parted. He looks downright indecent.
Surprise. Pain. Pleasure. John's voice rang out, filling the room as his blood filled Sherlock's mouth. He squirmed. They always did when they were left awake. And Sherlock reached out to pin John’s leg to the mattress.
It takes a bit of maneuvering, but soon John has once again secured his grip on the headboard—giving himself the leverage to impale himself over and over on the hot spear of Sherlock’s cock and those thumbs tucked just inside him.
“And that,” I say with a breathy sigh, “is what it means to be a power bottom.”
“I still think you’re a menace,” John says as he tucks himself back into his gym shorts.
“Aching?”
Still writhing, chest heaving with each breath, John groaned, “Why’d you stop?”
With one last savoring pull, Sherlock let him go. He licked his lips, imagining he could taste John's bliss.
Infatuated as he is, even Sherlock has limited patience for incomplete thoughts. “Spit it out, John.”
“I um. . .” John looks at him, then away. “Well, I was wondering. . . I mean. . .”
“You said the wife found him. Where is she?”
John lifts his brow in assent. “Yup.”
His voice was a bit too loud and just shy of a nervous ramble. Sherlock shifted again and smirked when another clear chime prompted John to continue. “Though I'm not sure who’d want to kill him. Doesn't look like they'd have much to gain. The nicest thing in this place is the fish tank, and even that's empty.”
Sherlock had always thought John had a beautiful prick—long and thick, straight save for the gentle upward curve that never failed to hit his prostate when they fucked face-to-face. But it looked absolutely spectacular at this moment: the entire length blushed a deep red, nearly purple at the tip where lube and precome covered the head in a shiny, slippery mess. And all the while glinting metal filled and stretched him.
“Contrary to your belief, we are professionals,” Lestrade answered, turning away from a young constable. The CP took one look at Sherlock and scurried off, throwing a second look over his shoulder along the way.
John nodded. “Sanitized it. Yeah.”
“However,” I interject, before he can work himself into a tizzy, “
—and somehow the least important was the one that tumbled out. “Where’d you get a crochet hook?”
But even the frantic, lust-addled press of their mouths was not enough to distract John Watson once he’d set his mind to something, and Sherlock quickly felt the questing tip of two slicked fingers. He moaned into John’s mouth, a low rumble of
as the head of his cock pommels my prostate, sends shivery pulses of pleasure through my body.
“Take off your clothes.”
No longer teetering on the precipice, Sherlock swiveled his hips, let the thickness of John’s cock stir inside him. He hummed, an amber-dark purr of satisfaction. Arousal pulsed sluggishly through his veins, peaking his nipples and plumping his cock. Sherlock wouldn't get hard—not in this state—but he reached down to tug at himself nonetheless. He circled the crown with only his index finger and thumb and rolled his foreskin over the head in quick little jerks. The sensation was a lot scratching an itch, sending a shiver through him—from the tops of his thighs, through his bollocks and up to his nape.
There’s a coil of pleasure wrapping tight around the root of my cock, pulsing liquid heat and pleasure through my core. Filling me. Filling me.
“Yes, John.” With his right hand Sherlock worked the rod in and out, and with his left he used just the tip of finger and thumb to quickly slide John’s foreskin back and forth over the generous flare of his glans.
He closes his hand around my hard shaft, leans down again, and runs the flat of his tongue over my other, untouched, breast. My body responds eagerly, a pearly drop welling up from my nipple. He flicks a few more times and I gasp as the milk begins to flow.
“This and a whole lot more. . . If that's what you want.”
Sherlock’s smile widened of its own volition. He wasn't typically so expressive, preferring to appear aloof and disinterested: it had the dual advantage of meeting people’s expectations and keeping them at a distance. But he found himself disarmed by John’s fearlessness, confidence, and quick wit. It didn't help that John was such a beautiful specimen—shaggy blond hair and dark blue eye, fit without being bulky and just tan enough to suggest he spent at least some of his free time on the pitch. A bit on the short side, but nobody’s perfect.
Sherlock sat back, quiet and contemplative as he retreated into his mind palace. He sorted through years of conversations and observations: John’s browser history and his stash of masturbatory aides under the bed; a parade of sexually satisfied, if not boring, lovers; embarrassing anecdotes told over several rounds on John's 38th birthday; and most recently, late night whispers as fingertips explored skin. But he could find nothing to answer the question in his head.
I need more.
Sherlock drew himself up, going as far as to lift his chin and set his jaw. “If you don't like it, leave. Or better yet, I'll take my dinner to bed. Would that soothe your delicate sensibilities?”
Sherlock looks around the room, anticipation ratcheting up his heart rate. He spies John at a high top table, standing with his back to the door. Sherlock would recognize the nape of John's neck anywhere.
He wasn't accustomed to admitting he didn't know something, let alone asking for help, but he had no room for pride in his endeavor. He peered up from between John’s legs. “What do I do?”
Clearing my throat, I try again. “Roll them. Yes. Oh, that’s perfect, John. Go ahead and give them a bit of a tug.”
He descended upon me like a wild man, licking deep into my mouth and sharing the musky, bitter taste of his semen and my own arse. I moaned into the kiss, wrapped my arms around him, and clawed at his back. I sucked the flavor of our fucking from his tongue and rocked up in desperation. Friction would be enough. The plane of his belly made slick by my own precome and the taste of rutting in my mouth. It would be more than enough.
,” John whispered, one part prayer and one part blasphemy.
They leave the balcony door open when they finally go to bed—letting the moonlight and jasmine and soft crash of waves join them.
John smiled back, dark and knowing. “That I do.”
John shuddered. He had a weakness for Sherlock's more domineering side, and a fondness for crude language—facts that Sherlock didn't mind taking advantage of, given the right circumstances. And these were absolutely the right circumstances.
John’s heart hammered now, heavy beats against Sherlock’s palm. “It’s not—I've never. . . I'm not gay.”
You know when an idea sort of gets away from you? Yeah. This is that. Luckily, it got away from me in some of the best ways possible.
from John’s chest. He tugs on John's sac, releases, tugs again.
“No, no, no,” John said, pressing his palm against Sherlock’s jaw. “It’s fine.” He smoothed his thumb over the blade of Sherlock’s cheekbone. “More than fine.”
When the sweet pull of John's mouth tipped from perfect, to too much, Sherlock tugged him back by the tuft of his fringe. John released him with a sigh, letting his mouth fall open and rolling his tongue to offer one last caress and Sherlock slipped free.
He’s beautiful.
John must not notice my embarrassment as he licks his lips and says, “Yeah you are.”
John shrugged and pinched at the peak of nipple visible under Sherlock’s shirt. “Got the job done.”
Sherlock hadn't even realized he'd closed his eyes until he dazedly blinked them open, let his bliss-addled gaze drift down. Soft candlelight glistened in the droplets clinging to John's stomach, trailing down the inclined plane of his torso, and pooling at the hollow of his throat.
“Yes, John. Please, yes.”
Sherlock groaned with relief, immediately kicking his hips forward to slide his prick through that perfect aperture. He curled his fingers, digging into the mattress for purchase, and raised himself up off his knees. He wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but then, he wouldn't need to. Desperate and panting, he rutted into John’s fist.
John’s glittering eyes go dark. “Yeah?”
A half-hearted shove on his shoulder. “C’mon. Roll over.”
John is fucking him and fucking him and he could swear he’s still coming long after the last pulse stops. His whole body is surging with bliss as John thrusts again and again, rough voice telling him he’s gonna come, gonna come, gonna—
The sun is just dipping below the skyline, the air crisp but not uncomfortably cold, as Sherlock walks through the door of Low Key Bar. With its blacked out windows and garish neon sign, he had expected to be assaulted by obnoxious music and the smell of cheap booze. He’s pleasantly surprised.
I bring the mic close, lick my lips, and rumble a command, “Put your hand in your lap.”
John stood halfway between the kitchen and the couch, the warmth of the afternoon light paled by the incandescent heat in his eyes. In his right hand he held a tube of medical grade lubricant—pilfered from the surgery and kept in the first aid kit under the sink—and in his left hand, held tight by a pair of tongs, he brandished. . .
“Not just name. Name, symbol, atomic number, and mass number. He finally told me to leave once I reached radon.”
“I stopped in uni,” John continued, slipping his hand between Sherlock’s thighs. “Didn't have the time or the privacy for indulgent wanks. And honestly the idea hadn't crossed my mind in years. But now that I'm thinking about it. . .”
“Yes.” Sherlock sat up. “Yes. All right.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone mid denouement and felt his words dry up on the tip of his tongue.
“What’re you doing in fifty-six days?”
He looks up at that, opalescent eyes tracking my movement. “No?”
I don't realize I've said it out loud until I hear a husky, “Sherlock. . .”
“Yes!”
Sherlock's movements were careful and considered—slipping his belstaff from his shoulders and hanging it on the hook by the door, bending slowly to untie his oxfords and pull them off his feet. He breathed through the throbbing urge to let go and rose back up with all the poise and dignity of a man
John tips his head side to side, noncommittal. “I was thinking about it.”
Head tilted back, Sherlock cried out again. He couldn't. He couldn't, but he needed to. But he. . .
Despite the burgeoning erection tightening his trousers—or perhaps because of it—Sherlock took the stairs two at a time. He bustled about in the kitchen, listening for the sound of John’s tread on the step. The front door opened and closed, but instead of coming upstairs, John knocked on the door of 221a. Sherlock frowned down at the worktop, wondering if he’d somehow misread the heat in John’s gaze.
He looks back down to me, eyes hot and hungry—an all-consuming wildfire—and I scramble to flip over. No need for words, I know exactly what he wants. I end up on on my knees, arse high in the air and face buried in the mattress. Presented. I feel cool air on my exposed arsehole, and the heavy weight of my cock and bollocks hanging between my legs. I love this. Love offering myself up.
John’s hand sweeps back up, cups me again. He squeezes lightly—mindful of possible tenderness—but I'm not sore today, so I place my hand over his and squeeze harder. He takes the hint, kneading my full breast while he mouths across the line of my shoulder.
As the afterglow began to fade, Sherlock rolled to the side, careful to stay clear of the damp spots. He ran a clean towel across John's chest and stomach, down to his pelvis and over his hips. He did the same for himself, running the towel between his legs and up the cleft if his arse. This would do for now, until they had the strength to leave the bed and clean themselves up properly.
Arousal flares deep inside, stiffens my prick and makes me slick. I start to squirm and moan and John sighs against my skin. “I'm gonna come all over you if you keep moving like that.”
John snorts. “A little?”
He nibbled, felt the play of texture—supple and wrinkled and malleable—against his lips. Then against his tongue as he began to lap, slow and savoring. Wet open-mouthed kisses followed, trailing up once again from hanging curve to musky-sweet perineum.
“Taste it.” I can hardly recognize my own voice, it’s so rough—a tumble of sun-baked stone.
“Hmm?”
They fall back to the mattress, John’s weight pressing Sherlock down. There’s no rhythm, just writhing, as they kiss and grope. Sherlock runs his hands up John’s back, curls his fingers over John’s shoulders and holds on, anchoring himself against the growing tide of passion.
Sherlock looked up, startled. He recovered with a flurry of blinks, recalling where he was: a modest first-floor flat in Hammersmith, not the sitting room of 221B with curtains drawn and plastic lining the floor; and with whom: a tired DI counting down the minutes to a cold pint, not a retired army doctor with hungry eyes and tented trousers. He cleared his throat. "No need to sound so surprised. I always give you a statement."
John’s attention shot up, his eyes wide. Of course he’d know that sound. His gaze darted down to the open vee of Sherlock’s shirt, where the butter soft, black leather of a bespoke bell collar cinched comfortably around Sherlock's throat. John looked back up—expression scandalized.
At John’s desperate keening, Sherlock changes tack. His strokes turn into a flurry, focused in the tip. The crown catches in his tight fist on each upstroke and punches a breathy
Growing bold, he runs his hand from root to tip, squeezes and pulls back. His fingers are wrapped, as much as possible, around the girth and he strokes again and again. Ostensibly wanking. Under the table. Of a crowded cafe.
"A bottle of water would be lovely." Lestrade looked up as he unlocked the car, brow pleated. "Not really what I meant... But, all right."
“Oh. . . John.”
John sucks in a breath as he feels Sherlock’s thumbs slide along his raw rim, already stretched thin around his cock.
John's fingers teased into his curls, twirling and tugging. "That was lovely, buttercup."
But John didn’t stop there, he continued up, running his tongue over Sherlock’s hole—pressing against the resistant rim and slowly coaxing him open. Filthy sucking kisses had Sherlock moaning into his pillow, arching higher and seeking more.
He carefully pulls his shorts back down, sits back in his chair. He even makes a show of taking a sip of his coffee. Gone cold now, I’m sure.
But the encroaching winter seemed to have sent the criminal classes into hibernation. Now they finally had the time to luxuriate in front of the baking heat of the fire and grind their bodies together until they remembered what it was like to be one.
“Touch me.” John pleaded. “I know. I know it's wrong of me to ask. But I. . . I need it. Oh, Christ.
“Sherlock?”
John sank his clean hand into Sherlock’s curls, raking through them like the soft cotton coat of a smokey Persian. His other hand he extricated from between them, and wiped off on the soiled sheets.
John pushes up the bottom hem, revealing long thighs and the plush curve of his arse. He bunches the fabric at the small of Sherlock’s back and holds it there with one hand. The other is running over his arse, slipping toward the cleft. He slides a dry thumb between Sherlock’s cheeks, presses lightly against his hole. It’s only a suggestion. A promise.
Sherlock hated it.
John groaned, voice scraping out a rough litany of
He tapped at Sherlock’s knees, encouraging a wider stance, exposing the swaying delicacy of his undercarriage. Now that was a sight: Sherlock’s cock hanging, heavy and dripping; the sparse auburn hair of his balls glinting copper in the firelight; the thick ridge of his perineum leading to his tightly puckered hole.
“Mmm. . . not when it comes to you.”
“What would you like to know?”
Sherlock chances a look down, sees his prick moving in John’s firm grip. The crown, blushing red and glossy, disappears, reappears—over and over as John twists his hand and pumps.
Sherlock spun out of the room, coattails billowing behind him, John and Lestrade close on his heels.
He crawled up the chair, settling his knees on either side of the cushion, straddling John’s lap. His cock ached for attention, pressing against his briefs, but rather than simply taking himself in hand Sherlock gave into a moment of self indulgence. Head tilted back, he traced his fingers down neck, over his chest, and plucked at his nipples. A fresh wave of need washed over him, pooling low in his groin and making his prick throb.
He helps me out of the bed and into the tub, where he runs bathwater cooler than I prefer but as warm as is recommended for my state. He washes me with a thickly lathering soap that fills the bathroom with the scent of lavender, and dips me back to wet, then rinse, my hair.
“So dramatic, John,” I tease, holding the line to my own matching mic close to my mouth.
Sherlock let the barest hint of a smile curl his lips. "John's in a bit of a mood. I think it'd be best to give him some time before I head back home."
Trying to still John once more, Sherlock pressed down on his hip. He could feel the heat of John’s prick, so close to his hand, and sucked harder. The urge to touch, to curl his fingers around that hard length and stroke, nearly overwhelmed him.
“I uh. . .” Lestrade plucked the fish delicately from Sherlock’s fingers, though his eyes remained fixed on the base of Sherlock’s throat.
“Oh my God.” John passes a hand down his face, already predicting where this story is going.
John left to do the shopping and apparently decided to pick up milk and beans by way of Edinburgh rather than the Asda around the corner. So Sherlock had been left at home alone. He'd been left to his own devices and he was bored. Well, not bored per se. Irritated. All right, not so much irritated as amorous. He'd been alone and on just this side of gagging for it.
“I can't believe you're here,” John says on an exhale. He pushes himself off the door, takes a step towards Sherlock.
Sherlock arched up, a moan slipping past his lips. “The last few days have been… ah. Frustrating.”
“No.” I confirm, patting my Union Jack pillow into adequate shape and collapsing into the chair. I make myself comfortable, confident this is going to be an entertaining conversation. I just wish I'd had the foresight to make popcorn. I give him a placid smile.
With his unoccupied hand, John traced down Sherlock’s hard chest. He tweaked playfully at a nipple, then slid his fingers over the gentle hills and valleys of Sherlock’s ribs. Down the ripple of his abdomen and finally cupping the jut of his hip.
“Hey,” John slides his foot against Sherlock's again. “You wanna get out of here?”
. Jesus, I want more. Need it.
“Just one more reason it’s amazing I made it to thirty.”
“I'm going to start recording.”
prefer to enthrall. It's easier, faster, less. . . messy.”
“Swear to God.”
They already know the beats and rhythms of the end of a day together, the way Sherlock likes to take forever in the mirror to inspect his hair, the way John brushes his teeth while humming
PFFFFFFFFFT BET YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS ONE COMING
to have you back.”
There’s the locking of doors, the turning out of lights. John pours glasses of iced water in the kitchen while Sherlock uses the loo, taking them into the bedroom—tiny, wallpapered, lace-curtained, with little blue flowers printed on the sheets—before sliding alongside him in the bathroom to share toothpaste, jostling elbows, watching Sherlock as he inspects some invisible grey hair in the mirror.
This is a meadow that has had time, John thinks. This is a meadow that someone has loved, that someone has wanted, that someone has raised carefully from worn ground back to fertile land.
Sherlock shakes when he comes, clenching down hard around John’s body, arm wrapped tight around John’s shoulder, knee hooked hard around his better leg. He shakes like it hurts, gasping and wrenching John closer, and John follows after him.
“Even you?”
, he’d thought.
John would like to know more about that. About Sherlock, satisfied.
“How can I prove it to you?” John murmurs, watching him. “You’re so good at seeing this in other people, when someone’s crossed that line for someone else. Do you want to measure my heart rate? Watch my eyes dilate compared to different people in different light? One of the first things you taught me, even—what do you say? Hesitation on the pavement always means there’s a love affair?”
“Broadly speaking?”
It’s just him and Sherlock, still themselves, maybe even
“Well, a
“With the fishing. I don’t mind, you know. I’ll follow you fishing, if that’s what you really want to be doing. But I’ll also follow you down whatever back alleys and dead ends, too. I’ll follow you onto whatever crime scene you want to see, through whatever locked door. Into whatever, I dunno, really bad restaurants. Whatever mad, ridiculous adventure you can conjure up, I’ll follow you.”
with letting Sherlock be afraid.
that’s protecting Sherlock. It’s not these wide open spaces that’s going to catch Sherlock when he stumbles, and it’s not these wildflowers that are going to ease Sherlock into unfurling.
to himself to get the timing right, the way they each look in t-shirts with worn collars and pyjama bottoms that tend to run too short on Sherlock and too long on John. They already know how to move around one another, a familiarity born of late nights stumbling home from cases, of caring for concussions and bullet wounds, of meeting in the hallway drenched in a nightmare’s sweat, too exhausted to care about things like the privacy of sharing a sink.
This is it.
“I’ve always been yours,” Sherlock says, and it sounds like acceptance, like believing, like,
John goes, and it’s about shifting over, it’s about aligning together, connecting to each other like stars, a constellation of
“I missed you too,” John says, and then the last thread of cold in his stomach finally dissipates, letting John go, letting him breathe for the first time in years, and John hadn’t even known he was holding his breath until all the air comes rushing in. “I missed you too.”
There are the gentle brush of mouths and the eager grasp of hands against hands, the shift of Sherlock closer and closer across the mattress, calves tangling against calves, knees curling around and hips shifting up and everything pulling close and hot.
An alternative to Sherlock.
splayed across the blue-flowered sheets, sparking up spines and flashing into thighs, drawing tighter and tighter, tenser and tenser.
Sherlock has a talent for doing the strangest things and making them seem so normal that there’s nothing one can do but go along. It’s dragged John loads of places—into absurd foot chases up and through buildings and back down, through locked museum back doors, down abandoned Tube tunnels—and while John hasn’t always been
Just the one bedroom, with a lilo.
“Not for us,” John says, shaking his head. “Not the way we were. You asked me to believe in you, Sherlock, and I did, I did for so long, and then right when it mattered, I stopped. And we both paid that price, and we’ve both done some pretty awful things, so whatever you think
Sherlock has a blush riding high on his cheekbones, but he nods. “Just being—well, ridiculous, I think.”
John leans in, slowly, and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, lingering there for a moment. He’s never kissed someone’s forehead like this before. It’s deeper than affection, John thinks, with the warmth of Sherlock’s skin, with the night-sky smell of Sherlock’s hair. It’s tender. It’s
They’d spent the better part of the day exploring that space, that familiar distance, to see how it might move differently now. They’d wandered through the afternoon, finding paths through the wildflower meadows, curving along the edges of the trees. They’d ducked in between the branches, to where the air was still cool and dark, smelling of earth and of something undeniably
When John thinks about everything that’s changed, now that Everything is over, he thinks mostly about the pill box. About how he has his own bottles, locked away in a cabinet because one of them is an opioid painkiller. About how the cabinet is in Mrs Hudson’s bathroom, because one of them is an extra-strength sleeping pill.
“See what I mean? You know how to see it in everyone else, Sherlock.”
John’s going to keep asking it.
“Hush, you,” John says, grinning, and he kisses Sherlock, quick and light, just to prove the point.
He could be thinking anything, just then. About wildflower types, grass breeds, soil pH levels. He could be thinking about the patterns of seeds, what he could tell about the history of this land from the swell of purple cornflowers on the slope of the hill, from the scattering of meadowsweet along the forest edges. He could be thinking about the ancient days when these lands might have been soaked in battle-born blood, or when these fields might have been forests, ancient and tall, or when this cottage might have been abandoned, derelict, forgotten and left to the birds to nest in its rafters.
. It’s that easy.
“All right,” John agrees, then he grins, and bumps his shoulder to Sherlock’s. “Just all right?”
, right up until he hears, “John, come here.”
you weren’t going to be. But I was, and you were, and I—I missed you.”
“I don’t know.” Sherlock looks away, squinting back out over the water. “Either, maybe. I’m not the easiest person to live with.”
Back and forth.
It’s nothing like London, and John isn’t so naive as to think that the
“Didn’t he, though?” John had asked gently. “It’s been thirty years, and you still know his name. Isn’t that how we survive, in the end? Isn’t that how a life goes on?”
each other, reaching for each other and finding another hand reaching out in the dark, it’s about the breath in their lungs and the tremble of their thighs and the twist of their hands together, moving in sync, moving as one.
“—must be the truth. Do you trust me?”
He can imagine a lot of things he’d never imagined before, and as he stands there, watching Sherlock sleep, he imagines what the rest of their lives might look like.
He had thought Sherlock might have been aware of that too, but he hadn’t done it, the same way he hadn’t turned his hand over upstairs. “You’re sure you’re going to be all right if I sleep?” he had asked instead, ignoring the thing about popular fiction.
John wipes his hands on a dry tea towel, makes a fresh mug of tea, and follows Sherlock out into the back garden.
He’d woken up again as the car rolled to a stop, and then he’d had to blink away the disorientation for a few moments.
From the corner of his eye, John sees Sherlock swallowing hard. “I don’t know if it’s been enough. All the—all the people, the cases. What if it wasn’t enough?”
Sherlock is, how irrefutably
“Yeah,” John says. “All right. Come here.”
about Sherlock at all, and there probably never will be.
“You kissed me on the dock this morning.”
Of everything there is to discover about Sherlock.
He sets his wine glass down on the coffee table and sits on the very edge of the sofa near Sherlock’s waist. Up close, he can study the line of Sherlock’s nose, the creases around Sherlock’s eyes, and auburn undertones in Sherlock’s curls, and John knows every detail of him better than he knows his own face, every line and wrinkle, every spot and blemish.
He sees rolling green hills and gardens bursting with lavender and honeysuckle and wisteria, two pairs of slippers side by side at the end of a bed, the grey dawn filtering through lace curtains. Well-worn paths trailing along babbling brooks and clandestine retreats under weeping willows. The flair of Sherlock’s coat as he crouches down to see a toad or a mouse, the excitement in his voice as he learns something new, the shine of his smile as he looks back up over his shoulder. A writing desk pushed up against a window, sacrosanct space in a workroom overflowing with pictures and books and test tubes. A skull on a mantlepiece; fresh laugh lines around the corner of an eye.
He feels it enough that it seems worth saying out loud:
Sherlock sniffs. “I didn’t think you were.”
, and he knows now that Sherlock doesn’t actually want John to let him go.
The cottage had been at the end of it, shadowed by an enormous oak and gardens bursting with fresh greens and marigolds and stalks of foxgloves, with bright blue shutters and a matching front door.
Maybe it should be, but it isn’t.
Sitting on a thick wool blanket at the end of a rickety dock side-by-side, legs dangling over the edge, a styrofoam container of wet, dark dirt between them, they’re fishing.
“John,” a voice had called. “John, we’ve got to get going or we’ll miss it.”
name?”
“This is really why we’re here, isn’t it?” John asks quietly, brushing a kiss into Sherlock’s hair. “You’re trying it on. Sherlock Holmes, out of London. Sherlock Holmes, someone else.”
had been on the tip of John’s tongue, but he hadn’t asked it in the end. Instead he’d let Sherlock take his bag and herd him into the passenger seat, and wondered at how much it didn’t bother him not to know.
But Sherlock doesn’t say anything. He studies John for a long time, there in the moonlight, and then he rolls over onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. His profile is pale and soft in the darkness, and John can’t tell what he’s thinking.
Known, understood, trusted, believed: told in lips and those short breaths Sherlock makes when he’s worked up about something, told in the gentle movement of Sherlock’s jaw and the hard clasp of his hands and the human sound of his heart.
Sherlock had turned the ignition off and sat quietly for a moment, following John’s gaze out over the water. “Fishing,” he’d said finally.
“You know I love you, right?” John asks, at barely more than a whisper.
But now?
He turns his head again to look at John; gets snagged, a little, on the sight of John’s fingers, stretched out between them. His eyes are so blue in the dark, his gaze unwavering, like he’s daring John to say it doesn’t matter—it doesn’t matter if Sherlock never says it back. If he never says so.
Eventually they’d managed to separate, all small grins and lingering touches, and Sherlock had driven them about a mile back through the winding copses of birch trees and pines before the two-track had given way to a gravel drive.
John had not done it.
He thinks Sherlock is thinking about the pill box, and their inbox bursting with cases, and the way lives can start over if only there’s love enough to raise them carefully from the ground.
So when Sherlock turns to hand him a rod, baited line swinging precariously out over the water, John does the only thing he can think to do.
(That’s the only way to talk about it really—
And it doesn’t.
Through the grasses, John had just barely been able to make out a narrow dirt path leading to a rickety old dock, extending low out over the water.
Sherlock always looks beautiful.
About how even though they’re barely over forty, some days it feels much older.
Sherlock’s jaw works for a moment, like he’s trying on various answers to see how they feel. “What makes you think I need to know?”
Sherlock nods. “Three weeks,” he repeats. He laughs again, and this time it sounds rickety and frail. “I thought by then you’d be fine. I don’t know why I thought that.”
It had still been mostly dark, with just the barest hint of dawn approaching through the blue and violet shadows. They were pulled over just off a two-track road along the edge of a long, winding sort of pond, lined with long grasses and tall reeds still frosted in the dawn. The heavy mist rolling off the water nearly obscured the line of trees on the opposite shores, ancient oaks and creaking pines that rose up like sentinels.
A year ago, two years ago, not knowing what Sherlock was up to would have made panic well up in John’s belly, oil-slick and black, but things had changed. John knew better than that now. John
looks. John looks back, absolutely unflinching, and says, “You don’t have to prove we can have a quiet life, Sherlock. You’ve been
They’re fishing.
It’s a promise, then, that Sherlock needs. It’s the easiest promise John will ever make.
Whispered without words, exchanged without sound.
John can go over to him. John can sit next to him, and brush the hair off his forehead, and rest his hand over Sherlock’s on his belly. John’s allowed. John’s
Something cold settles into John’s stomach, but it’s not as sharp as it used to be. It’s more like pressing on a bruise so faint it can’t even be seen on the surface anymore—nearly healed, though tonight it’s here
“Come on, you’re okay,” John says, pulling him a little closer, and Sherlock tenses and then crumples all at once, collapsing into John’s hold, hiding his face in the curve of John’s neck. “It’s okay to be tired, all right? It’s okay. You’re okay.”
“John,” Sherlock says like a chant, like a prayer, and John slips his pyjama bottoms down and kisses damp against his navel, against his hipbone, down. “John, John, John,
Moonlight streams through the lace curtains, milky and sweet in the velvet dark. Outside, the crickets chirp and bullfrogs hum, the breeze rustling in the leaves, but in here, it’s only the sound of Sherlock breathing on the other side of the pillows, and too many years worth of silence.
. Everything that had happened, Sherlock’s suicide and Mary’s martyrdom, each as fake as the other, Moriarty and Mycroft, two sides of the same coin, the drugs and the gunshots and the drinking and the baby. It’s easier to just say
Sherlock is still looking at the trees when his bobber dips, once, then twice, and goes still again.
more than with this place, wearing faded denims John’s never seen before rolled up to the knees with a white button-up that might actually be flannel, sleeves rolled up to just below his elbows. His shoes and socks lay abandoned behind them on the slats of the dock; his toes go back and forth through the water, back and forth, back, so slowly, and forth.
“Popular fiction? Does that seem like something I know anything about?”
It had been uncomfortable to think about, actually. The unknowableness of it. Sometimes even frightening. John had not particularly wanted to examine all the wheres and hows and what-ifs of a life he couldn’t be sure he’d get to live.
John thinks, watching Sherlock through the window over the kitchen sink as he meanders through the back garden.
Sherlock, not against him: an empathetic understanding that only makes John want to hold him close. “When you died?”
themselves than they’ve been in a long time.
Sherlock’s toes go still in the water, and he looks at John,
They’re both being a little ridiculous, but it’s surprisingly comforting, actually, to not be the only one. John nods too. “It’s not like we’ve never slept next to each other before.”
Sherlock is watching him, a little, through half-lidded eyes, his gaze hazy and wandering as if he’s not really paying attention. But of course, Sherlock is always paying attention, and John wonders if this is just what Sherlock is like when the map is complete: when there might be more yet to know, but he doesn’t need it yet. When Sherlock is satisfied.
John thinks, watching Sherlock wrap his arms protectively around himself, turning his face up to the early afternoon sun. Something more than the confession of shared breath and soft kisses exchanged in the early morning mists. Something more than just the thing sparking between them. Something about the quiet, maybe, or the peace.
Loving Sherlock out loud is about words, whispered right into his skin,
“But not you. I haven’t had you, because this is different. And for a long time, I wasn’t completely sure, and I knew I couldn’t do this if I weren’t sure, not with you. And now I’m sure. I was sure this morning on the dock and I’m sure right now and I’ve been sure, actually, for a while, just—waiting. For the right moment. So eliminate the impossible, all right, and whatever’s left—”
Sherlock had had the key in his pocket.
John thinks to himself.
For years, John had not done it, because in all the ways he’d imagined it, he’d imagined that they’d
John had grinned then, wide and a bit silly. “Yeah,” he’d said. “All right.”
John starts again, quieter this time. “I told you once that you were the best and wisest man I knew,” he says. “The most—the most human human being. I meant it then, you know, I really did, and then I spent two years being
“’course not. Butterflies are kept under glass, first of all, which seems like a pretty pointless exercise when I’m hoping for a repeat performance. And you’re less—Lepidopteric. Broadly speaking.”
It’s about hips. Elbows. Necks. Gasping breaths and parted lips and eyes that focus too hard and on too much and hands that lose their way, beautiful in the moonlight, desperate in the dark.
Looking over at Sherlock on the dock that morning, John had finally known.
seem to like him, at least.”
John meets his eyes. Wiggles his fingers between them. Knows, in his heart of hearts, that Sherlock trusts him. And slowly, steadily, Sherlock reaches out to take his hand.
, out loud.
It’s the way the kiss lingers, the trail of John’s mouth down Sherlock’s jaw, down his neck, down his shoulders. It’s in the way Sherlock tilts his head back and gasps, a little, when John bites down where neck and shoulder meet. It’s in the way his curls crush against the pillow and the way his hands pull at John’s shirt and the way his hips rise up and up.
were going to be all right. I should’ve known you’d end up taking care of me.”
Maybe it should. Maybe it should be shocking or astonishing or whatever else—how simple it feels, how smoothly their edges align as soon as they step together. Maybe it should be uncomfortable, how easily that familiarity moved into intimacy, how easily the distances between them pulled closed.
John knows how to live with Sherlock. It’s living without Sherlock that John could never manage.
John feels like they’ve been reaching out toward each other for years, orbiting around each other, and it’s not so much that they are changed as it is that their fingertips have finally met across the space they’ve been trying to close for so long.
“I know this hasn’t been easy,” he finally says, curling his fingers closed and then open again, aware that Sherlock is aware of him even when he’s not looking. “I know I’ve made mistakes, and I’ve said things I didn’t mean and did things I didn’t want to, and I
Sherlock’s hand presses into John’s back as he says that, as though he can feel the tension about to unspool along John’s spine and wants to stop it at its source. John exhales under the weight of it and finds he has to look away.
“That’s not what I meant,” John says, chuckling, and then Sherlock says, quick and interrupting, as though he’s about to lose the nerve to say it: “I’m tired.”
“Are you?”
Sod the distance. It’s not
Sherlock had snorted. “As if that’d stop me. No,” he had answered, seriously then, “I couldn’t have bought a house without you because I’d be rather hoping we’d be buying it together.”
, he had thought, sitting in the dark next to a date he didn’t really want to be with,
He’s quiet. He’s peaceful.
They’re here. They’re both
John shakes his head. He wants, badly, to take Sherlock’s hands, to pull him close, but instead he only sneaks his own hand across the mattress, waiting for Sherlock to take it on his own. When he’s ready.
“It’s a cottage,” Sherlock had responded cheekily. “You can put the bags in the bedroom through to the back—there’s just the one but there’s a lilo, ought to be fine.”
He’d dressed in a daze, packed a few things without thinking them through, and gone downstairs to find Sherlock waiting with the same sort of Land Rover-type thing he’d driven before, way back when, idling at the kerb.
Sherlock shrugs; there’s new tension in his shoulders. “It was a perfectly understandable reaction.”
Now, he’s here, in some hideaway cottage with Sherlock’s hideaway heart in his hands, looking at a stack of books Sherlock might read aloud to him before leaning in to kiss him with poetry on his mouth. He’s here, watching Sherlock sleep by the light of the fire, watching Sherlock as he breathes in, and he knows the way Sherlock’s mouth tastes, the way Sherlock’s hands feel, the way Sherlock’s heart beats, as fast as a hummingbird’s, in time with John’s own. He knows how
His eyes, when John dares to look, are wide open, and John can hear the sound of his breath in the silence between them. “I think,” he says, a little shakily, “I think I could be. When I’m with you, it feels like I could be.”
The little line between Sherlock’s eyes, right above the bridge of his nose, flares into being. “How?”
It feels like breathing out, like release. It feels like breathing in.
It’s quiet. It’s peaceful.
Sherlock has all the building blocks, all the individual pieces that make up the feeling that lives in John’s chest, in the insides of his elbows, the corners of his mouth. He just needs to thread them all together.
A hand sneaks into his clean one, huge and loose and gentle. “John.”
Across the pond, the sun has crested over the tops of the trees. The dawn is filled with the sound of birds singing and frogs chirping, with the breeze and the warm smell of sunlight in the grasses, and Sherlock’s hand is cool when John finally reaches out to take it.
, it’s
There’s a curve of a smile against John’s neck, and only a moment later, the press of a kiss to the corner of John’s mouth. “Yes,” Sherlock promises too. “Forever, then.”
John knows Sherlock. Knows how to move with him, when to move around him, whether to move for or against him. Knows how to live with the noise and the music and the science in the microwave, the panics and the vague, roundabout apologies, the laughter and the constant running, running, running.
Sherlock shakes, and he holds John close, and he says, “I love you too.”
John looks, and looks, and looks, and he hears and he sees and he listens and finally, he
It’s in his eyes, John thinks. That’s always been Sherlock’s giveaway: his eyes.
“No, right, it’s not—not even like we’ve never shared a bed, what with that whole case with the paint, do you remember?”
Sherlock’s eyes focus on him, studying him a little deeper than he had been just a moment before. John looks back as steady as he can, trying to find whatever question Sherlock is still trying to ask, trying to make sure, after all this time, that he knows the answer.
A kiss good morning. A kiss good night.
It had been a soft awakening that morning, despite the early hour; almost coaxing, almost gentle, a sing-songing whisper and a cool hand on John’s wrist.
better than that now, a solid, grounded sort of trust, so totally unlike the blind, worshiping trust he’d had before Everything.
So John had nodded, and he’d settled his head back against the makeshift pillow, and with the heat blowing warm on his feet and the smooth rumble of the car beneath him and Sherlock’s steady, watchful presence beside him, he had been asleep again before they’d even hit Marylebone Road.
He’d imagined it standing in the sitting room, catching each other’s gazes in the mirror over the fireplace: what it would be like, just then, if he turned, if he took Sherlock by the wrists, if he asked, “Now?” He’d imagined it over the breakfast table, sharing newspaper pages back and forth, laughing into each other’s tea-tinted mouths, on the sofa, reaching across the distance between their two chairs.
"Sherlock?" Sherlock didn't think before the words came out.
"You never..." John stopped, the rest of his sentence dying before it could even be fabricated.
"What's going on here Zaveri?" Lestrade asked. The man warily walked up the John and slung an arm around his shoulders, eyes watching Sherlock as he did, challenging him.
"If I have to dance with one more of these interminable people I fear Lestrade will have a mass homicide to investigate. Shall we leave the festivities early?" John nodded enthusiastically, and Sherlock lead him through the croud to a discreet door John hadn't formerly noticed. There was a blur of dark hallway, and then the click of a latch. Sherlock had lead John into a rather large closet.
"I'm fine."
Thank you all for reading!!! I hope you enjoyed it!!!!!!
The beginning of the infamous party.
The swimming pool. Cliché? Probably.
"Push me away John." It was a challenge. Sherlock ran his fingers up John's clothed inner thighs. John shivered. "Push me away." Fingers ran up John's sides, threw off his shirt and found the muscles in his chest. "Push me away. Show me you don't want me." A tounge replaced the fingers, it traced the grooves of his chest, and found his right nipple. Sherlock lavished his tounge on John's nipple, fingers teasing the other. John moaned in pleasure, and nearly screamed with it when Sherlock's teeth gently grazed the aching nub. Sherlock glided back down John's body to his clothed erection, and Sherlock bit down on John's lower stomach as he undid John's trousers. Sherlock palmed John through his trousers.
John had a nasty habit of self control. Nothing Sherlock had tried had worked. Not nearly kissing him by "accident" throughout the day. Not laying his head on John's lap while John watched Tele on the couch. Sherlock was beginning to wonder if he would ever crack the former soldier. That nasty self control. When Sherlock had laid his head on John's lap John had almost petted Sherlock's head, but stopped his hand, and held it clenched against his side until the program ended. Sherlock debated, once again wrapped around John in bed, how he could get him to admit it. Lestrade had texted today. Sherlock had ignored it. They'd get there soon enough without him. Sherlock had his Blogger to crack, cases, for the moment, came second.
"Where did you get a ladder anyway?"
"No need to shout." Mrs. Hudson unlocked the door. The flat was dim, with the smell of mildew and the sound of leather on flesh.
Sherlock's pov, his attempts at cracking John
"Bollocks!" Lestrade proclaimed and ran down the stairs. The question was, which number was John? Was he the first soldier boy? Or would he be the last ?
"Lestrade. Bring bolt cutters and two ambulances."
"It's 4:30."
"Cliches apply if they're true. I don't like seeing other people touch you. I want to be the only one that gets to. I want exclusivity," Sherlock grimaced, as if considering something terrible, "but only if you agree to it." John thought for a moment, and then stood.
In which Sherlock acts very differently than a high person. (I think? I have no experience in that area and therefore no clue). Let's be real. This is just porn. That's it. Just porn.
"Niice note you left by the way, shame it was a lie." The singsong grated on John's fraying nerves. "Poor Sherlock. He just found love! And now? Now to take it away." John tensed, anticipating pain, a wound, something that would kill him. "But not yet. There is a game to play first." The light shut off, and a door opened. "Goodbye! Little lover boy!"
"John? I never what?"
"SHERLOCK." It was obviously not the first time John had said his name. Sherlock hailed a cab, and they were off on the scent of a killer.
"People are going to start dying."
"You are mine." The words are a growl, truthfully almost a snarl. Sherlock pulls out of John, and collapses next to him, pulling John to him. Sherlock is asleep in seconds.
"Isn't he here? What's going on?"
"Milk! We're out of milk!" John proclaimed suddenly, rushing out of the flat. What was he going to do? Sherlock had been bound to notice the change. Even the least observant person could notice it fairly easily, it must have been child's play for Sherlock. Maybe Sherlock had seen through him, and maybe that was why Sherlock had let himself be ignored and avoided for so long. But why the sudden confrontation?
|~~|~~|
Sherlock smiled to himself, faking sleep on the couch. John was still been blushing profusely from whatever assumptions he had been making when Sherlock shut his eyes. What would he see now if he opened them? He opened them a sliver. On the coffee table sat a note. Sherlock's stomach sank.
"Sherlock, dear what happened to your head?"
"One choked his little self, and then there were nine" Lestrade sighed, handing the note to Sherlock. The body it had been attached to was being carted away.
"Not until after my third date with her!"
"God Sherlock, cliche much?" Sherlock smiled smugly.
"What are you doing?" John nearly shouted.
"Why didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend?" The man asked John, too calmly. The man walked over to John, and kissing his hand. "I guess I'll just have to steal you." The man smiled menacingly at Sherlock and walked away.
(See the end of the chapter for
The practicing was delightful torture. John's heart leapt at every touch, and his mind frolicked though meadows in worlds where Sherlock loved him back. But John's reason always won. Hold back, it demanded. To Sherlock it's just a game, he had to remind himself. He couldn't become attached to those touches. As much as they meant to him, Sherlock felt nothing, and would end the whole thing when the party was past, or whatever experiment he may be conducting was over. Now if only John could convince his heart of that, and make it remember. But it wasn't listening. Every morning when he woke up in a warm embrace, every careful touch, his heart danced a jig in glee. John had never had an addiction, but was this what it felt like? This craving for something, constantly. John didn't know. But he knew once it stopped, it may destroy him.
"I know the danger signs." John turned around to see the umbrella wielding Holmes standing against the wall. "Let's get to work."
"Bollocks! We've got to find him!"
"I love you." He whispered. "Love me?" The second part came out as a plea, and Sherlock felt prepared to get down on his knees and beg.
Everyone at New Scotland Yard knows the rule. "Only touch John when absolutely necessary. And never for more than a few seconds". They knew the rule, and they followed it. Sherlock was the jealous type. Lestrade had seen Sherlock punch a paramedic one day because her hand had strayed too far onto John's lap. No one really knew what would happen, but they didn't dare risk it. Not even Sherlock seemed to touch John often in public, but maybe that was because they were still hiding their relationship. Anyway, the author digresses. The long and the short of it, is no one touches John. Ever, if at all possible. That is until the Yard gets a new guy, and one that everyone forgets to warn.
"He hurt you."
"Oh please Sherlock. John is mine. He loves me."
Practice makes frustrated.
John looked back at the night before, guiltily.
"Are you following me on dates again?" John interrupted. Sherlock was silent. "My God Sherlock! What are you so afraid of?" John stormed back upstairs, spilling his coffee on the way. He left Sherlock standing in the living room, and was too angry to stay and hear the answer Sherlock whispered.
"What the hell was that?" The other man was up, and holding the side of his head. John looked at him. "Ricard? Are you alright?"
Sherlock makes a blunder, and John makes assumptions.
John's having a rather interesting night.
The ol' switcheroo. Conversation between Sherlock and Mycroft.
"There's nothing we can do about the case. The only thing we have is the altered wording and we have nothing to go on we can't get IDs for the victims so you're going home." Sherlock sighed. Resigned. He walked up the stairs to the flat, and the door was ajar. A knife was rammed into the table, pinning another note. "Your little lover boy, closer than you think, but be warned as he sits on the brink. Life or death await him on which way he falls, meet me at the swimming pool? You haven't got the gall."
"Take me down there!"
"Do you want exclusivity?" John raised his eyebrows in surprise, but considered.
"Of course he touched me. We were snogging. You can't snog without touching."
"Damnit Sherlock!" Lights flew past Sherlock's eyes.
Sherlock is being distant, and John goes on a date.
That should do it.
Logical: what?
"Taking you home. You need to sleep."
(See the end of the chapter for
This was so much worse than a bit not good. Sherlock had been insisting they practice being engaged to make it believable. This meant a lot more physical contact, and a lot more times John had to concentrate not to just kiss Sherlock right then and there and blurt out what he felt. But it was all a game to Sherlock. The countless touches a day we're a facade. Sherlock insisting they share a room and John waking up to Sherlock's pajama clad body wrapped around him, himself holding on just as tightly, were just an act. What looked like genuine emotion in Sherlock's eyes was fake. Wasn't it?
"How is he?"
I'm out of service. Getting it where I can.
"Push me away. Tell me you want Ricard Zaveri more than you want me." It came out almost as a plea, but John could not respond. Sherlock pulled his pants down, licking up John's member. John was approaching the end. Whatever Sherlock was doing with his mouth was amazing. Sherlock raised his head, and looked at John, pupils wide with lust. "I've changed my mind." John's heart hit his toes. Sherlock didn't want him. "You're fucking me." John was dumbfounded. Sherlock produced lube from who knows where and began preparing himself. Sherlock's eyes were closed, concentrating.
John was not happy. He'd woken up in another man's bed, alone. He was currently doing the walk of shame, and he didn't have the money to hail a cab. He didn't even have his wallet on him. He was just getting back to Baker Street, turning the corner, and he stopped dead in his tracks. Several patrol cars were pulled haphazardly on the curb by John's door. He ran, fearing, well, to be honest with himself, he didn't know what. Donovan looked at him like he was the worst kind of regurgitated bile on her shoe. Anderson looked at him like he'd killed someone. John dashed inside, up the stairs and into the flat. Ms. Hudson was puttering around the flat worriedly, and Lestrade was slumped in Sherlock's chair. He flew to his feet when he saw John.
"Maybe you should get dressed before you go running through all of London." Sherlock went to his room dressing quickly. Where were his shoes? Ahh. Yes. In John's room, where he'd left them the night of the party. Sherlock ran up the stairs. He put on his shoes and turned to leave John's room, a knife was stuck in the back of the door, a note pinned beneath it.
John wants to take Sherlock’s hand in his. John has wanted to take Sherlock’s hand in his for a thousand years, it seems like.
He still doesn’t know everything, but now John thinks he might know enough, and all those endless, cascading possibilities, all those whethers and hows and whys and ifs, are all beginning to coalesce, to connect, taking the shape of something happening
who is stuttering his own breath against John’s mouth, who is making that noise in the back of his throat, and God, Sherlock kisses in exactly the way John had always imagined he would: with everything he has.
“No? Not an expert on house-buying?”
He looks away. “I’d have thought you’d have had enough of all that.”
, and about knowing, once and for all, that this is it.
There’s something captivating about Sherlock in the firelight.
Maybe it always has been.
John had glanced over. Sherlock had been concentrating on the road, or so it had seemed, but Sherlock was usually concentrating on more than one thing at a time, and John had known just then that Sherlock was
It’s up to them what comes next.
The time has just come for him to love Sherlock out loud.
The night in Sussex is deep and dark, sort of hushed in a way that London never is. There’s no faraway pulse of music or rumble of lorries or  wails of sirens. There’s no light from the orange streetlamps filtering in and no lingering smell of grease and onion on the air, and it feels smaller, somehow, closer, but also wider and broader, like falling into the sky itself, like being lost at sea with nowhere else to be.
They’re here because of the pill box.
John had imagined it again for the first time in years, indulgent and furious and heartbroken, the night Sherlock had reappeared, breathing and standing and
And John is here.
John kisses him, and the mist rising off the lake starts to dissipate in the morning light, and John’s fishing pole lists precariously to the side and he has to let go of Sherlock’s hand, startled into laughing, to catch it before it falls, and Sherlock takes both their poles and lays them down next to him on the ancient planks of the dock, lines still suspended somewhere out in the water, and he cups John’s face in both his hands and kisses him back.
Across the pillows, Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “You make it sound like I’m pinning you out like a butterfly.”
, John thinks again, kissing Sherlock down into the sofa cushions.
each other somehow, that they had both known in some ephemeral way that this was it: this was their choice.
John doesn’t have to say anything either. He kisses Sherlock’s forehead one more time, and that says it all.
John sees: cups of tea.
Sally Donovan had said to him once: an alternative to the rush, the noise, the uncertainty. An alternative to the strops and the shouting, to the drugs and the danger. An alternative to strange and unbelievable and improbable.
It wouldn’t have, but this does.
Sherlock’s hair catches in the breeze, just the tiniest bit, lifting the curls from his forehead as he looks up toward the line of the treetops, and John wonders again what they’re doing here, but he still doesn’t ask.
, somehow, even with all the evidence of time in the land and the cottage around them. Like when the world was made.
looks beautiful out here, standing among the flowers as he raises John’s tea to his mouth and drinks.
John doesn’t know if Sherlock’s ever been this open with anyone, if he’s ever been this vulnerable before. The look in his eyes says no. The look in his eyes says that he’s afraid right now, and John is
John doesn’t think Sherlock is thinking about any of that, though. He thinks Sherlock is thinking about how this place feels
It’s about pausing and catching their breath; it’s about rushing forward, shifting clothes out of the way, finding new places of bare skin. It’s about places they have touched before with worry in the place of joy—changing bandages, inspecting wounds—and rewriting a history here for themselves.
The breath hitches audibly in Sherlock’s throat. “I know we can’t sustain this forever,” he says.
John’s not dreaming, but he could be. It feels like a dream: out of place, out of time, a little bit. Sherlock is somehow incongruous with
, he thinks at Sherlock’s tall figure, the dark of his hair and the white of his shirt stark against the soft greens and yellows of the fields around him.
He’d imagined it eager and earnest and sweet; he’d imagined it sleepy, so soft it could almost not even be real. He’d imagined it relaxed, and stressed, and biting with anger, slow and lingering with disbelief and uncertainty; he’d imagined it in the shower, pressed up against the tile, slick-hot and desperate, and he’d imagined it on the front step, pressed up against the door, giggling, in the back seats of cabs and behind trees in parks and in Lestrade’s office and between the open doors of an ambulance, as a whisper and a reprimand and a demand and a giving and a total, unadulterated relief.
Sherlock’s smile had twitched. “Yeah, of course,” he had reassured. “I’ll wake you up if I need it.”
This must be what Sherlock feels, John thinks, when the case is coming together, when the dots are connecting, when he’s seeing everything laid out before him like so many dominos. This must be what it’s like to see everything in alignment, to see everything combining, consolidating, sorting itself down from a jumble of information and impressions into a picture-perfect map.
Sherlock curls around him instantly, a pile of limbs, a puddle of loose muscles and bare skin. John’s fingers find the curve of his lower back, feeling through the space where a bullet should have gone through him and didn’t, the place where he should have been ripped apart and wasn’t. The mess of organ and muscle and nerve endings that he would have gladly given if it would have kept John happy.
John knows how to love Sherlock, too.
of John, of the angle of John’s head against the window and whether it would make his shoulder sore come morning, of whether turning the heat up a degree or so would help him go back to sleep.
“I know what you’re doing, you know,” John says suddenly, breaking the silence.
“Not really,” Sherlock admits. “I thought that because I was doing the logical thing, it would be easy to do. Leaving my life behind, chasing after Moriarty. Maybe it would have been once, but. I forgot to account for you.”
He sees Sherlock’s hand, in his.
It’s quiet. It’s peaceful.
,” Sherlock starts, but John cuts him off.
The silence now is like a cocoon, broken only here and there by the sound of the fire, drawing them closer to one another. Sherlock’s eyes sweep over John in the flickering light with the bare suggestion of a smile around the corners of his mouth, and John hears every deduction Sherlock could be making without him having to say a single word out loud, because they all come down to one thing:
He could be thinking about when it was revived, renewed, a love for the
John laughs, and carefully pushes himself out of bed to trek out to the bathroom, cleaning himself with a wet flannel in the sink before throwing a clean one in to Sherlock. He takes their glasses of water for refills—entirely necessary after the physical exertion of the evening—and then climbs back into bed.
Sherlock’s fingers tremble along the fishing line as he reaches out and adjusts it, twanging it a little.
, the back and forth—”
It’s Sherlock’s hand in John’s this time. “You missed me,” he says quietly, examining the nicks and burns left behind by reckless experiments, the violinist’s calluses, the blue veins in the wrist. The cold in John’s stomach shivers around itself, waiting for an answer, the last answer, to the very last question.
It doesn’t matter, because—“I already know,” John says quietly.
He’d imagined that it would have changed everything, and maybe it would have, but maybe it wouldn’t have. It hadn’t mattered, because John hadn’t done it.
“Beautiful out here, isn’t it,” he says, holding out his mug of tea for Sherlock to take.
It’s quiet. It’s peaceful.
“I did,” Sherlock had admitted, his eyes darting away, and John had wondered if Sherlock had ever said that out loud before. “But I thought—you know how children are, before they understand how everything really fits together. Things make sense in a different order.” He huffs a little self-deprecating laugh. “His name was Redbeard,” he says. “I thought that if I’d loved him better, maybe he’d have lived.”
Kissing Sherlock could only ever have happened like that: in the light of the dawn, with their hands clasped together, coming home.
It’s the only answer John can give, where Sherlock is concerned. The only answer John wants to give for the rest of his life.
to want them. And I don’t know—I don’t know how to take all that back. Or how to let you see past it. I don’t know how to show you what you need to know, so you’ve got to tell me.”
Sherlock shifts ever so slightly on his chest, and John suspects he’s looking up at him, though he doesn’t look down to check. “For as long as you stay with me,” Sherlock says.
“You all right?” John asks finally, steadying himself with one hand on Sherlock’s arm.
“I think that no matter where you go, what you do, I’m going to follow you,” John tells him. “I think we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together. That’s the way I think things are.”
“I like
It’s about a heartbeat echoing through both their chests,
They’d kissed again, just there inside the door, and again in the kitchen, with Sherlock propped up against the kitchen table. Kissing to cheeks and to wrists as they put together a couple of cold sandwiches from what was in the fridge, as easily as if they’d always done it, as if they’d always been this way, slotting kisses into their usual domesticity as though it’d always been there, even though it hadn’t been tangible.
So they’d kissed there, with the sound of the water lapping at the dock, and as Sherlock had gathered up his socks and shoes, giggling a little, and against the side of the car, as though to reassure themselves that they were taking it with them, that they weren’t leaving this just for the pond.
“What do you think?” John dares to ask quietly, reaching up to flick a curl off Sherlock’s forehead. “Shall we head to bed?”
It doesn’t surprise John, how easy it is.
In that primal, elemental way only certain things can be known, John knew that whatever he might imagine, it would only ever happen because they both knew: that this is right, and this is now, and this is them.
This must be what it feels like to
And he pulls Sherlock in, Sherlock, who is warm and who is heavy and who is grabbing John back, Sherlock who is
Sherlock had finally looked back at him. His eyes had suddenly seemed fragile, and he had taken a deep breath, and he had asked, “Did you ever say
“Hey there, stranger,” John says, stepping through the meadow as he comes up next to Sherlock, following Sherlock’s gaze out over the rolling hills, toward the line of trees and the dip in the land where the fishing pond must be hidden from view. There are birds calling into the sky, bright and joyful, and the breeze is soft through the wildflowers, turning the heads on the tansies and the buttercups, the ox-eyed daisies and the cornflowers, ruffling them like the soft hair of raucous children, while the stately poppies look on, dotting the land with their coppery-red blooms, and the odd scattering of oxslips and wild parsley play in the undergrowth.
“Mm. I think we just understood, right then, that this was it, didn’t we? We’re going to be together, and that’s the way it ought to be. Was it not the right time for you?” he teases. “Should I have waited?”
It’s an unobtrusive thing. Sherlock keeps it on the top shelf of the medicine cabinet behind the mirror of the bathroom. It’s nothing special; it’s got a compartment for each day of the week, which Sherlock refills every Saturday night after John goes to bed. He’s inspected them, of course—there’s an innocuous little white pill, a bigger oblong one, and a soft-gel. The soft-gel’s just fish oil, of all things. John doesn’t know what the other two are; some other doctor must have recommended them. A vitamin, he suspects, and if he had to guess, just a regular aspirin, which makes John think about Sherlock’s heart, and about all the things Sherlock’s done to it, and all the things John himself has.
“Yeah, it is,” Sherlock answers, though he still sounds a little faraway. John thinks
“More Vitruvian, if you ask me.”
Someone should always be asking Sherlock that question, John thinks.
It had been comforting, actually, in the way deeply familiar things are comforting, to know that Sherlock was aware of him, watching over him in some instinctive, deeply ingrained way, and for a moment John had wanted nothing more than to reach out and put his hand over Sherlock’s on the gear lever.
John looks at Sherlock and he sees
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Maybe I ought to go see about the lilo after all—”
Sherlock doesn’t look at him, though, keeping his eyes on the grass, and John ducks, trying to find them, catching Sherlock’s gaze from underneath. His eyes, his giveaway eyes, are wet.
“The Speckled Blonde, wasn’t it?” John teases.
Sherlock hums, but he doesn’t startle. He must have been paying closer attention than John thought. “Don’t know what you mean.”
When he pulls back, Sherlock is watching him.
god, he’d forgotten how Sherlock had laughed, and he’d imagined pressing Sherlock down into the black-and-red tiles of the Landmark, pressing him back into an alleyway because he couldn’t wait to get home, pressing him back into the dusty sofa at Baker Street, filling it again with warmth, with life, following through, following down, telling him, telling him everything.
Sherlock’s not perfect. He’s better than perfect. He’s
Sherlock frowns. “I never take us to really bad restaurants.”
It’s nothing like London, and Sherlock sits next to him, silent and still with his jeans rolled up to his knees, one foot trailing through the water, back and forth, back and forth, like someone else entirely.
Sherlock’s smirk had grown. “What, don’t you like it?”
of kissing Sherlock Holmes might mean they’d reached some kind of end. There’s nothing
“It’s important that you know. Before I go to—well, we’re already in bed, but before I—before I cross this space. Between us. It’s important that you know I’m not just trying this on for size. I’m not just taking what’s on offer.”
