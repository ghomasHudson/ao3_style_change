“Thank you,” he said softly. “For allowing me to ride you. I needed this.” Sherlock glanced back at him, golden eyes glimmering and made a series of whistling happy noises. They flew for another hour before Sherlock headed back towards the base, aiming for the back of the hospital tent. He landed smoothly, wings tucking against his side as John slid down, wobbling on his feet.
“When would we leave?” John asked next, ignoring the dragon's huff of annoyance behind him.
“Can we get back to what exactly we'd be doing?” John asked with a sigh.
“Is that camp?” he blanched, seeing a group of buildings and tents in the distance. Sherlock chirruped happily, glancing back at him with one golden eye. “You must have been hauling ass for us to have gotten this far.” The dragon chortled, looking rather proud of himself as they started descending.
“Ghivashel,” he muttered, eyes closing and letting sleep take him.
“John I am a dragon,” Sherlock huffed. “I can go a very long time without sleep.” John chuckled and settled in to a companionable silence with the dragon leaning against him. They spent the rest of the daylight hours like that, only getting up to make a small meal and relieve themselves. When it was getting close to dark Sherlock went to wake the general and Lestrade as John started gathering their things and putting only the necessary things in their packs. The rest he sat against the base of a nearby tree to hide under some branches. He wanted Sherlock to be as unburdened as possible for this mission, especially since there wouldn't be much room inside the compound anyways. The dragon sidled back up next to him, rubbing against him like a cat and allowing the doctor to put his harness back on.
“Sherlock answers to no one but John,” Bowen chuckled. “It's both or neither.”
“He looks tough,” Mike said appreciatively.
When John woke again the sun was rising and he realized his coat was almost completely dry. He sat up slowly, rolling his shoulders to release the tight muscles and looked around curiously.
“We'll get you some pain meds and you can get some much needed sleep,” Mike told him as he took a bottle and syringe that Molly had ready for him. John took the injection without so much as blinking and eased down into the cot gingerly, allowing Sherlock to curl up against him. It didn't take long for the drugs to take effect and he was letting the darkness take him as gentle fingers carded through his hair.
“Won't let anyone touch him,” John sighed, glancing up at Sherlock who snorted in derision. “But he's passed all his tests with flying colors.”
“That is...unusual,” he commented. Sherlock glared at him, continuing his work until John's entire back was covered. “You never showed interest in any I showed you before...”
“It's all him sir,” John chuckled. “I'm just along for the ride.”
When they arrived at the army base John led the way to a large warehouse looking building and stopped at the desk to check in. Sherlock looked around, noticing a few other dragons nearby. Most of them were collared and chained, being led around like dogs by their masters. The ones that weren't looked so miserably beaten and depressed that had the opportunity to escape risen they probably wouldn't even have tried taking it. Sherlock found himself growling under his breath when John realized what his source of distress was.
“Sorry?” Sherlock shrieked. “You almost die and you're sorry!” John winced, hands moving to massage his temples delicately.
“Oh...” John mumbled. “Sorry.”
He was finishing up when he heard a branch crack behind him. He spun around and let out a yell as he was tackled to the ground by a dragon. He cried out in pain as a clawed foot slammed into his shoulder holding him down. The dragon pulled its head back, flame gathering in the back of its throat and John clenched his eyes closed waiting for the end. Suddenly the weight was knocked off of him and he gasped for air, curling to his side and trying to push himself up. Something was standing over the top of him and he quickly realized it was Sherlock's scaled belly. John could feel the tremors of Sherlock's snarls all the way through his body and almost whimpered in fear. The dragon that had attacked him was getting to its feet a short distance away, shaking its head and pawing at the burnt flesh on its side where Sherlock had struck him with one of his lightning blasts. The dragon was a yellow orange color and had a frill of dark orange spine down its back. It was well fed, John would venture towards chubby and it's dark green eyes regarded them both in annoyance. It started talking in chirrups and whistles, almost seeming to scold Sherlock to which Sherlock stared back in stony silence. Once it was finished Sherlock let out a couple indignant huffs and snorts, slamming his paw on the ground near John. The other dragon snorted but turned and started walking away, limping somewhat and making Sherlock chuckle haughtily.
“Took out the whole group!” someone yelled, smacking him so hard on the back he almost went down. “Destroyed all of them!” Sherlock was making concerned chirrups behind him, growling at men that were trying to pat him in congratulations too. “Never saw anything like it!” John smiled awkwardly, trying to make his way out of the group and towards his tent until finally Sherlock shoved through the group grabbing John by the back of his vest and lifting him away from the grasping hands. John flushed as men started laughing but was pretty happy about getting away. When they were near the tent Sherlock let John down gently, pushing him again.
“I've got a mission for you two,” he explained softly. “A private mission.” Sherlock and John glanced at each other and crowded in closer. “It will be just the two of you. There's a package pickup, two days flight from here. I'll provide you with a map to the pickup location. This is confidential boys, no one but us knows about this.” John nodded firmly and Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly. “Pack your overnight bag, you're heading out in the morning.” He got up and disappeared into the crowd as quickly as he'd appeared. John hurriedly ate the rest of his meal, noticing that Sherlock hadn't eaten any more of his and was looking rather put out.
“Sherlock, darling…” John climbed off his love’s lap and kneeled on the floor by Sherlock’s feet, reaching out to take his hands in his own. “You do please me, even without sex. If this makes you uncomfortable, we don’t have to do it right now. Not ever, if you don’t want to.” Sherlock was definitely quite a ways on towards a full-blown panic attack, the first since The Incident.
“I’m going to sit on the bed now,” John said softly, wanting to make sure that he didn’t startle the detective. He got up from the floor and sat on the bed to Sherlock’s right, placing his hand on the man’s shoulder.
After many minutes spent like this, Sherlock finally began to calm down enough to speak.
“John....” Sherlock questioned worriedly.
“He wants a completely obedient killing machine,” the first argued, injecting the syringe in to a port that led in to the pedestal. “If you want to keep this job you better keep your mouth shut.” They left the room again and John looked around carefully before hurrying towards the glass doors, Sherlock shuffling behind him.
“John!” he squeaked out as soon as he was able, scrambling closer. John smiled dazedly up at the dragon, clutching his leg tightly against him. “let me see,” he said firmly, dragging one of the med packs closer. John's eyes closed tightly, a tear leaking from the corner of his eye. Sherlock pried his hands away and took in the painfully burnt and blistered skin. It was bleeding sluggishly, and the burns were most likely 3
“Sherlock I don't really have time for this,” a deep aristocratic voice sighed. Sherlock snarled at the man, wings flaring slightly in challenge. John glanced up and was surprised that Mycroft looked completely human. He didn't carry wings on his back like Sherlock and no horns were nestled in his hair. He was like a serpent, a roiling predator hidden and ready to strike. To John's amusement he did have a bit of a belly and in his slightly delirious state he laughed a little. Mycroft looked very annoyed, glaring down at the doctor. Sherlock chuckled behind him, hands still smoothing cold water over the cuts and cleaning them.
“I'm sorry John,” he said softly against his ear. “I'm sorry you ended up with me and that I don't make things easy.” He squeezed John a little tighter, lips grazing his earlobe. He let out a breath like he was going to say something more but pulled away, leaving John's hair prickling with static. He shifted in to his natural form, shaking his wings out and John noticed the scorch marks around his shoulders and across his wings.
“Those....creatures!” he spat, fingers curling in front of him and John watched his claws lengthen slightly. Sherlock was barely under control, his whole body shaking. The soldier took a step back fearfully and Sherlock's shoulders dropped slightly, claws shortening. “They're experimenting on children John. As if capturing and enslaving dragons wasn't enough, they're performing experiments on our children! Trying to make us more obedient, just soulless killing machines.” He looked sad now and when he looked up at John his eyes were that icy blue again.
“It's your funeral,” he grumbled. John went to the human sized door, watching as one of the men unlocked it and opened it just enough for him to squeeze in. He stepped inside and immediately the door was slammed and locked behind him. The dragon was backed into a corner, electricity still crackling over his scales, but he simply watched John, no act of hostility...yet.
“Extensively,” Bowen grimaced simply. John wanted to ask more but sensed this was not the place and leaned back with a sigh.
“Okay I think that's enough time in the cold water,” Sherlock grumbled, climbing up the bank and helping John up. The cold water had numbed his back completely so Sherlock was able to scoop him up and carry him up in to the cave. He sat him next to the fire, digging through packs until he found a change of clothes and a small towel and tossed them over near John.
“You make an interesting pair,” Zane commented. “You practically treat each other like equals.”
“Sherlock please,” John pleaded, picking up the clothing again. “We'll be fine. Bowen wouldn't send us if he didn't think we could handle it.” He urged Sherlock to take the jumpsuit again and it was snatched out of his hands but Sherlock didn't put it on. He stepped right into John's bubble, glaring down at the soldier in annoyance.
“Sorry,” John mumbled through a yawn.
“Sir, we're partners,” John started as calmly as he could. “We have to trust each other to work together.” Bowen was smiling softly, hiding it partially behind one of his hands as Zane scowled.
“I don't like this,” Sherlock said immediately, putting his hands on his hips. John flushed, scrambling for Sherlock's jumpsuit and trying to hand it to the dragon who knocked it away. “We know nothing about what we're picking up. He's sending us by ourselves. This is dangerous and a death trap.”
“Think you can ride?” Sherlock asked after giving John a few minutes. John nodded, accepting Sherlock's help as he wrapped an arm around the man and lifted him gently. John swayed slightly but steadied himself and released Sherlock to stand on his own. He nodded once and Sherlock stepped away, sliding into his natural form and towards his abandoned harnesses. John shook his head to clear it then bent to help Sherlock get into his harness. Sherlock laid all the way down to make it easier for John to climb up and gave him plenty of time to get adjusted before he took off again. He headed back into the cloud cover, wings pumping steadily, trying to fly as gently as possible. John meanwhile was just concentrating on holding on, bending low over the saddle and trying to keep his head clear. He must have hit his head on the ground harder than he'd originally thought. His eyes were getting heavy, the world around him skewing and he vaguely wondered if Sherlock was doing spins through the sky. That couldn't be possible though because he wasn't even holding on to the saddle. The wind was blowing and he turned his face in to it and realized the ground was getting closer. He thought he heard a shriek then it all went black.
“Wouldn't hurt to have just in case,” John reasoned. Sherlock visibly sighed, wings drooping.
“Fucking dragons,” he grumbled. He switched out stones for the egg, put the last of the meat in to their basket and resolved to gather more vines today. He knew the dragon wanted him to come join him, so he resolved to get revenge and leave him shivering in the water for as long as possible.
'Where had he gotten an umbrella?' John thought and started giggling again.
“I am not immortal John,” he hissed. “I can be killed, there's no guarantee of your protection.” John's whole face was flushed as Sherlock stared down at him and realized he'd gripped the sleeve of John's jacket tightly. “Please do not do this mission,” he pleaded, eyes softening.
“Right...” he mumbled to himself. “Patrol. I'll be back by nightfall.” John watched the dragon drop his shorts, struggling a little, then shift awkwardly and head out of the cave.
“I think so, what are you doing?” John asked, but Sherlock didn't answer only slid into his dragon form, nostrils flaring and eyes narrowing up at the sky. He pumped his wings a couple times making sure everything was in one piece then nuzzled against John gingerly. He took one last long look at the soldier then shot into the air, disappearing quickly. John tried not to hyperventilate as he tended to his leg. Sherlock was a more than capable dragon, he'd seen it himself at the camp that the man could hold his own. But now here he was, alone in the jungle, didn't know where the hell he was, with a very injured leg and a still injured shoulder. “Please come back,” he pleaded.
“Come on in,” Bowen called. John entered the tent, glancing back at Sherlock who was sliding in to his human form and yanking a pair of shorts on to follow. To John's surprise General Zane was also seated nearby and he quickly saluted both generals, fighting back against the twinge of pain.
“I'll be okay,” John promised, meeting Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock dropped his hand to John's shoulder, pressed his lips to John's forehead a moment then stepped away, sliding into his dragon form before John had fully realized what had happened. Sherlock stood at the cave entrance waiting patiently for John to put the harnesses on, securing bags and saddle, his cheeks flushed pink. As John climbed up Sherlock swatted their fire out with a smack of his tail and headed out into the night. Once the soldier was situated Sherlock was in the air, enjoying the crisp breeze, wings stretching and pulling rhythmically. John sat comfortably, holding the handle in front of him as they climbed higher. They broke through the clouds and the stars shimmered overhead, giving just enough light to gleam off of Sherlock's dark scales. John ran a hand over the scales absentmindedly and felt the vibration of a pleased purr underneath him. He smiled softly and settled in for a long haul.
“You okay?” he asked softly when John winced. Mike was scrubbing the burn clean, intent on his work so John allowed himself to lean his head into Sherlock's shoulder a moment.
“Ain't seen nothing faster,” he relented. When John turned back around the dragon had come closer, allowing him to get a better look. It was almost cat like, sturdy but graceful and when the light caught the scales just right there was a purple sheen to the bottom arc of each scale. His golden eyes took in John as much as John was taking in him.
“I think you two will make a fine pair,” he finally said, stopping in front of them. “Dragon form please!” he demanded,taking a step back and placing a hand on his own dragon's shoulder. Sherlock grumbled, getting to his feet and unfurling his wings to full width.
“It hurts,” John mumbled, trying not to sound totally pathetic. Sherlock smiled gently, hand ghosting through John's hair a moment before he was digging through the medical bags again. He came back with a water bottle and a few pain pills, handing them over one at a time.
“Ya have no idea wha' you're dealin' wif,” a man missing quite a few teeth snapped. “Lucky te be alive in the 'morrow,” he mumbled and went to his position by the cage door.
“That...” Bowen breathed out heavily. “Was some damn fine flying.” John grinned, he didn't need told, he knew how amazing Sherlock was. Seconds later an explosion rocked the ground below them and panicked yells could be heard through the dust and debris.
“Your lackey attacked what is mine,” Sherlock grumbled. “You will wait until I am done caring for him.” Mycroft turned and glared at the dragon who was staying in his natural form a good distance away. “I do need you to do something for me though.”
John didn't go back to sleep but lay there and listened to the brothers arguing softly with each other. Across from him, the egg was still in it's nest, stones glowing softly with heat around her. He started thinking about plans, what they could do to stop Zane, then cursed himself for slowing them down. Why had he run? If he'd just stayed still, he'd be fine. He got angrier at himself the longer he laid there until he was shoving himself to his hands and knees with a grimace. Trying to keep quiet so Sherlock wouldn't hear him. He was tired of being a burden to the dragon. Finally, he managed to get to his feet, swaying slightly, and took a few steps towards the entrance. His vision started to darken around the edges and he tried to push past it, and groaned when it tunneled worse. “Fuck...” he moaned as he started to fall.
“Ambushed by a dragon sir,” John answered as Mike finished up his wrapping. “Got hit with a fireball when he attacked. I think he must have belonged to the enemy.” Sherlock, who knew exactly who the dragon belonged to, looked down and kept quiet.
“We had an incident last night,” John explained softly, still trying to tug away from Sherlock's hold. “I had to bandage him up and we must have fallen asleep here.” Sherlock finally let him go, curling in on himself and wrapping a wing around his body.
“Your back is in shreds,” Sherlock growled softly. “I think this warrants using some.” John shook his head again, letting his face flop in to the wadded up blanket. He heard the dragon sigh and shuffle closer, fingers running through his hair gently. “Mycroft can bring us more supplies,” he offered this time. “Please take these.” John rolled his head enough to peer at his dragon with one eye, seeing how it pained him to even suggest asking his brother for help. He held out his hand finally, taking the pills Sherlock dropped there and popping them in to his mouth, followed by a swig of water that the dragon offered him next. “Do you want to change position? Maybe lay on your belly for a while?” John thought for a moment then finally nodded, sitting up with a cringe and letting Sherlock help ease him down.
“We want to see that your dragon has some instinct to protect. It's hard to have a partner that has no interest in your safety whatsoever.” Bowen was scratching away on something on his desk then paged fitters to come measure Sherlock for his harnesses. “Looks like you found a good one John Watson.”
“Sherlock what is going on? What was all that about?” John demanded, yanking the pack out of his hands. When Sherlock's gaze snapped back up at him his eyes were glowing gold, the dragon barely contained beneath this human guise.
“I was understandably upset about being put in a recovery facility. There was nothing wrong with me.”
“Right in here sir,” he explained. “This is where we keep the ones strong enough for the military.” John stepped into the dank area, scanning the cages on either side of him. Dragons in various forms from ones that looked fully human to ones that were quite cramped in full dragon form littered the cages. The ones in this part of the facility were meant to have more of an attitude and power so most the dragons he passed were glaring obstinately at him. They came to the end of the row and he started to follow the man around a corner when something caught his eye. An obsidian scale glinted in the dim light and he followed the shape up to a pair of golden eyes that were staring back at him intensely.
“Couldn't sleep?”
“What about this one?” John asked, when the man had skipped over him in his endless sales pitch.
“Sherlock!” John snapped after the third shock, shaking the numbness out of his hand. The dragon looked sheepish, turning and shoving his muzzle in to John's arms. “Just calm down, okay?” John urged, rubbing between the dragon's eyes. Sherlock finally nodded, turning and continuing towards the general's tent, scales no longer crackling. By the time they reached the tent John was exhausted and sore and Sherlock was chirping worriedly, but the soldier stubbornly kept walking. He rang the bell hanging outside of the tent flap and straightened as best he could, a slight grimace to the corner of his mouth.
They climbed until they were above the clouds and smoke, Sherlock leveling out and allowing John to sit up a bit. The air was cool but refreshing, the moon a sliver above them and the stars gleaming gently. The dragon beneath him settled in to an easy pace, mostly gliding with the occasional flap of wings. John reached in to his jacket pocket and pulled out the tube of ointment he'd sequestered there and squeezed out a decent amount, looking for the worst of the spots first. When the cool balm touched Sherlock's pebbled skin, he jerked slightly, glancing back at John in question then his eyes closed and he let out a purring moan, shoulder shifting and pressing in to the soldier's hand.
“You hit him though,” John argued as Sherlock wrapped bandage around him. “Like really badly.”
Finally he headed towards the cave, needing some rest. He pulled the egg out of his pack first, sitting it in a cushion of clothes carefully before digging for something for them to eat. Sherlock was ambling around, shoving rocks in to a small circle with his nose then startled John when he let out a puff of lightning, making the stones glow white hot and sizzle. He looked pleased, then grabbed the egg gently from where John had put it and placed it in the little nest. John watched in amusement, chewing on a granola bar as the dragon fretted, pushing rocks closer and adjusting the egg until he was happy and wandered back towards him.
“The thing about dragons is, they're very possessive of what they deem theirs,” Bowen explained. “And to them, we are their most prized possessions. They want to keep us for themselves. I understand Sherlock was going to be put down and that's why you chose him?” John nodded, still taking in everything he'd been told. “Then he feels he owes you his life. He'll protect you till his last breath John. Cherish what you have together.” John nodded again and Bowen took his leave, patting Lestrade's neck affectionately on his way out. There was no one in the medical tent that day so John dragged a chair out front, stretching out and letting the sun warm his tanned skin. He'd almost dozed off when a shadow blocked out his light. He squinted up and smiled at Sherlock who was in his dragon form still. The dragon chirruped, pushing his face into John's hands asking to be scratched and John complied with a chuckle. Once his itch had been sufficiently scratched Sherlock curled up around John's chair to bask in the sun, even letting John prop his feet up along his back.
John woke to a woman's shriek and a horrendous snarl and went flying out of bed. “Damn it Mrs. Hudson,” he snapped as he went flying down the stairs. The woman in question was cowering on the floor at the base of the door and Sherlock in full dragon form was in the middle of his living room, wings fully extended and teeth bared in a snarl.
Silence
“With onions…?”
It wasn’t just in between cases, and those moments seemed to scare him the most. Because he could never predict when Sherlock would push him into the nearest secluded place and have at it, condoms tucked away in her trench coat pockets for easy access. In the lab, at the Yard, or even some poor bloke’s apartment during a sweep of the murder scene, whenever, wherever, Sherlock got her way
I just hope I meet y'all's exceptions
After she announced her pregnancy so casually, it seemed to be all The Yard would talk about. Whispers and stares, more than usual, came their way whenever they went anywhere, and Lestrade was cutting back Sherlock’s consulting time to the point he just didn’t call her at all, worried about her and the unborn child she harbored
“Mother has been giving me cases half my life now” Junior responded, standing a little taller and squaring his shoulders like he always did whenever he felt he was being underestimated, something that happened often given his age and admittedly adorable face, a habit he must have picked up from his father as it was John’s usual stance whenever someone mocked his wife, snapping into a military straight pose that always seemed to make people second guess their initial estimate of his strength and patience
Sherlock Holmes was a gorgeous woman, and in all honesty, John always felt a small swell of pride whenever people asked him how long they’d been together, but always, he quickly squashed the feeling, because, it wasn’t his to have, right? He couldn’t be happy that people thought someone like Sherlock would go for someone like him, because it hardly seemed fair to her
It’s happened before, when their eyes locked in moments like this, each holding their breath, and for once, Sherlock didn’t seem to have all the answers, her mind blank of words, of deductions and reasons; she would just stared at him, with a look John, if he didn’t know any better, would call confusion. Like in that moment she didn’t know what to expect, what would happen, because the tension was so thick and the air was thinning, each knowing what a risk it would be to lean forward, but wondering if maybe, maybe it would be worth it to just feel each other’s breath on their skin, the promise of their lips, the taste of their tongues
But, I'll still make the effort to update
If you wanna read what I've got done so far, hmu on
“To go to your family dinner”
(See the end of the chapter for
Standing as tall as he could, he shook his head with a sense of finality and turned towards Lestrade “I’ll be heading back. Can you send over copies of the files? I’m going to go pick up some things at the market for Sherlock” and with that he left, going down the stairs of the victims flat and slamming the door at the bottom hard enough to echo
“Using one’s own heightened skills of observation achieved through years of discipline is hardly cheating, John”
But to his surprise, she shifted, moving down a little on the bed until her feet threatened to hang off so she could rest her head on his chest, already wild curls looking more like a lion’s mane
“Do you plan to keep my nephew from me?”
for fanfics I don't publish on AO3 (Tho it's mostly just anime tbh)
He stared at her for a few seconds, in shock she’d even have to ask him, his gaze darted down her body then back up to meet her eyes, his arms snaked around her waist, pulling her closer so he could roll his hips against her thigh
John shrugged, one of his hands resting on Junior’s shoulder, even at 10 the boy was pushing 5’2” and John was starting to worry he’d be taller than him by the time he hit puberty. “Sherlock’s right. It’s not dangerous”
“What?”
“What do you want, Mycroft?” she growled, lip curling back like a cat’s hiss
John padded down the stairs, face sleep ridden and clothes rumbled
Later that night, once they arrived home, Sherlock made her way towards her violin, dabbing down a bunch of notes before picking up the instrument and repeating the main theme of the play by what John assumes was entirely ear
Imagine his surprise when the doors of Bart’s swung open to reveal a woman, a few years his junior, with curly brown black hair reaching down to her chest in a waterfall of natural spirals and eyes that seemed hell bent on being every color available
“I have always said that caring is not an advantage, merely sentiment found on the losing side, but it seems that Sherlock was not able to fully lock herself away from such emotions, and thus has found herself where she is now.”
“You’re the one who insisted we no longer use the janitorial closet at Bart’s”
“John, how often do you intend to have this conver-”
So I did not actually update yesterday, but we got home around 10pm and going through her candy, showering the infant, taking off the cosplay makeup, it was late and I didn't wanna actually bother with a computer
Finally, it was over, and Sherlock found herself feeling almost
Sherlock Holmes was rudely awakened from within her mind palace by Ms. Hudson’s cheery voice and the all too familiar sound of an umbrella being casually tapped on the floorboards below
“What, John?” she asked, voice curt
John, finally having his brain catch up with him, finished changing junior’s diaper, lifting him up to rest him with his head on his broad shoulder, and rocking softly
“It’s not an unfounded observation, if you chose better men, it is a possibility. You aren’t the most incompetent member of your team, and have proven on more than one occasion to be of above average intelligence”
“What’s her problem with you? I know you’re not the easiest person to get on with…but there is a limit”
“No, John, it is not alright.” She frowned, plopping down onto her chair and crossing her long legs, torn fishnet ripping further up her legs as she reached into her loose tank top, her bra, and removed her wedding ring, slipping it back onto her finger
“Don’t think she notices me much, though. Just the girl who sneaks her in” Molly said, her tone light and accepting, before flushing again “Oh, sorry! That sounds really…”
“You’ve been idling playing with your ring since our wedding, I’m simply informing you that it will continue to be there unless you remove it”
“Not like this” he said, his eyes closing for a second and he breathed in deeply, visibly trying to strengthen his willpower when his body was all for the idea of their usual rough and quick sex “I, I want to go slow” He confessed, his cheeks turning an adorable shade of pink she would appreciate more if it wasn’t for the fact she wanted to get off in that exact moment
It's short, so apologies, but we've officially hit the place where Parent!Lock will become a thing, so if you're no interested in that, or if pregnancy gives you the heebyjeebies, I advice you stop reading from here on out

But no, she didn’t move, just smirked around his shaft and sucked, because she enjoyed this, unraveling him, turning him into a puddle of want and need, and turning off his other senses until he could only chant her name through his orgasm
“-ou see him? He’s so short”
“Sh-Sherlock!” he groaned, his hands gripping her hips tight as he pressed her down against him, bringing her as close as possible as pulse after pulse of his release hit him
“Fuck off” curt, vulgar, and she enjoyed the wrinkling of Mycroft’s nose at such crude language she so rarely used, never pointed in his direction unless with necessity to convey overwhelming emotions.
Halloween is tomorrow night and I'm gonna go trick or treating with my daughter and my spouse, so I may not be able to update, but I will try
“I swear Sherlock, if you say you’re sociopath one more time I will walk out that door right now” he warned, hunching his shoulders
“Was that her name?” she held her clipboard to herself again, though more like a shield, like the topic wasn’t a comfortable one for her, but she still wanted to know. “Sherlock just called her ‘the Woman’. Bit important, she was…? Was she her girlfriend?”
“Sit” he said, and they both did at the edge of the bed, his hand once again cupping her cheek as he leaned in
“It’s our wedding, Sherlock” He said defensively
I'm gonna be writing for NaNoWriMo so I'm actually gonna try to get this fanfic posted entirely before then
A thrill racing up his spine at the soft moan of surprise that echoed down his throat
“Please” Sherlock rolled her eyes, more of habit than actual annoyance. “It is a simple string of break ins, no weapons, no danger. There are limits to what I would allow my son to be exposed to”
for the Google Doc link
He blinked a few times
He snorted at that, hiding his half laugh with a cough, though it was obvious she heard it anyways
With his eyes squeezed tight, he could have sworn the world ended just then, lost in the white behind his lids and the blankness of his mind, a climax so intense it hit him in the gut and swept the breath right out of his lungs, and he panted, trembled, resting a sweaty brow to her lean shoulder in an attempt to collect himself
A response no better fit than in that moment
He was holding up a hand to a passing waiter to tell the man he wasn’t quite yet ready to order, his usual jumper and cardigan combo switched out for a nice suit and tie, and clearly not used to wearing such attire, his fingers danced along the edge of the tie a few times, loosening it and tightening over and over until the once straight triangle looked as though it was tied by a toddler
But for what good was his decision? Because all he could do was wait. He just stood there, with explosives strapped to his chest, with his heart sinking into his stomach while the two bantered, compliments actually being said back and forth, admiring each other’s work, intelligence, the way their minds seemed too similar.
John put down the book he’d been reading, standing up from the foot of the bed and straightening his cardigan and insuring all the buttons were properly in place
Cold case files stood in mini pillar sized stacks all over their flat, a fire hazard no doubt, and so far she’d solved an average of 5 cases a day, cases that had left Lestrade puzzled and at his wits end for months each
Getting her brother to leave the flat, Sherlock noticed, was getting much easier with the new development with her flatmate, just yet another thing added to the list of reasons she enjoyed sleeping with John Watson
At being caught then. She frowned
“It was fairly obvious” Sherlock replied with a fake smile of her own, one that anyone besides John would read as genuine.
Finally, he looked up. And when he saw her, he was visibly stunned; it took him a few seconds to process her image
Funny how I make Donvon such a bad guy here and yet I've literally written Sherally smut before lmao
“Is this a bad time?” The DI asked awkwardly
Letting out a sigh, he closed his eyes, and slipped right back into sleep

“She didn’t seem like the type” Molly said absentmindedly, before blushing “O-Oh! No! I didn’t mean a lesbian, not that there’s nothing wrong with that, and you can’t really tell, now can you? Since people can be… I-I meant, just, about relationships, I didn’t think she was interested in that kind of thing” she stumbled over her words, though John didn’t draw attention to it
As if reading his mind, she did just that, soft caresses at first, as if she was mapping out his shape through his cotton boxers, even the simple touches made his heart pound, intense in ways a hand job shouldn’t be
“By today if all goes well” Mycroft replied, craning his neck just slightly towards his nephew, a subtle gesture, as if he was afraid to be caught being curious about his own flesh and blood.
Again, I'll be updating as often as I can, since writing/updating/networking was part of my New Year's Resolutions, so yay?
She found it beyond amusing, slipping it into conversations every now and then to see his face burn up
When they arrived, Sherlock’s leg was all but a blur with how fast it was twitching, the nervous energy and twitching had him thinking that she was able to tell exactly where they stopped at, though, nothing could actually prepare him for her reaction once they were out of the cab on onto the street in front of the theatre
Hope you like the story so far, as you can see things are starting to heat up a bit
“Deduce” he rolled his eyes, running the pad of his thumb gently over her sole, feeling slight inflammation under his delicate touch
I'll update as soon as I have a chance, sorry I kept y'all waiting
She shifted slightly to better adjust their positions, and went back to her thoughts, though John noted, with relief, that there was the slightest smile that appeared almost shyly on the corner of her lips
Hushed, poorly concealed ‘whispers’ could be heard as they approached the dinning room, and the doctor set his jaw at the comments obviously about him
“Ugh!” Another fling of her arms, sending the hammer off to the side, skittering wildly before thumping against the wall, leaving a dent Ms. Hudson was sure to notice later
“Did Halloween come early this year?” Anderson smirked, his eyes roaming up and down Sherlock’s figure, taking in the sudden change in her usual attire
More like it (mostly of different shows) can be found on my DeviantArt, in which I go by the same name
“Sherlock, so kind of you to join us” A familiar voice cut in, and John controlled the look of surprise his face almost made at the slumping of Sherlock’s shoulders, like she was actually relieved to see her brother for once
“I know, I just-”
She looked at him, her expression completely serious
It wasn’t just them anymore, they had a child and with that a reason to make it home at night
She found herself doing this, every time a case ended within a few hours, trying to get home as soon as possible only to have John glance in her direction before ignoring her the rest of the day, the ‘silent treatment’ having gone on for over a month now was no stranger to her, and there was no way of John knowing she was rushing through the work, she was so desperate to do just to arrive at the flat early, to spend the rest of the day with a crying infant and his passive aggressive father
“What are you doing?” she asked, raising one brow but making no effort to stop him
John sighed, sinking deeper into his chair and running his hand over his face
“Um…Sherlock…?” John called softly, testing if his flatmate could even hear him, or was too deep in her ‘mind palace’ to
She looked at him, as if she had forgotten she was bloody half naked on the couch, and he stared back unmoving, already used to the way her eyes flickered over every inch of his face, deducing everything in a simple second
“You should’ve picked some bloke closer to your height for this” John gestured vaguely with his hand
John flinched, glancing back over his shoulder where Sherlock stood, her arms crossed and a glare, an actual glare, cutting through him, he felt it like a slap across his face, a physical force that hit him, the obvious disappointment and plain anger directed at him were so thick in the air that everyone was starting to look uncomfortable
Silence
One heel had broken during the commotion, and she had tossed both it and it’s pair into the streets and left them there, leaving John to carry her into the cab to avoid having her step on anything dangerous
“You’re angry”
“Great, now can we PLEASE get back to the case? This one is actually an 8”
She didn’t bat an eye
“What are you doing here?” she asked, her tone betraying no emotion, though a mix was bubbling inside her
Sherlock smirked at that.
“Same thing he did with you. He offered him money in exchange for information on me. Though he wasn’t nearly as principled, he accepted, to which Mycroft made his detest very clear… I never heard from Victor again”
“John was providing training in self defense” Sherlock spoke when the doctor seemed incapable, not bothering to lift herself off the floor, only roll onto her stomach and propping herself onto her elbows
“Off” she commanded with a tug on the denim, her index finger hanging loosely off  one belt loop
Sherlock’s arm snaked around John’s waist, grabbing at the gun hidden beneath his jumper to retrieve it since his arms were currently pressed against her slender hips, holding her in place so she didn’t slip out
(See the end of the chapter for
She simply lifted her hips, allowing the fabric to come off and hang loosely on one ankle, the stubble on his chin tickling the inside of her thigh with a kiss, two, moving just slightly higher each time his lips met her sensitive skin
When he didn’t reply, Sherlock sat herself on her chair, one suit clad leg crossed over the other
Together, they found their release in eachother's embrace
That put her uneasy nerves to rest, not fully understanding why the idea of John and Donovan made her skin almost crawl
She jumped, jumped from the bridge after a the suicidal man that had killed his wife, her only intention on keeping him from getting off as easily as taking his own life, and dove right after him, under the waters and out of sight for almost an entire hour
She blinked a few times, processing the information and discovering it fit perfectly with all the signs
John switched feet, giving a slight shake of his head
“You alright?” He asked, concern seeping into his tone
“As was I when I started investigating my first murder case, this is nothing more than robbery”
But, it was never like this. Normally she was dressed as usual, trench coat over a flattering suit, but John couldn’t ignore the figure hugging dress she was currently in. Its pitch-black color matching well with the smooth expands of her pale body, making her look ghostly white, flawless, untouchable, a statue carved of marble; an angel among humans. The thin strapped, sweetheart neck line dipped low, drawing eyes there as intended, and whatever she was wearing underneath held her chest up in the most flattering of ways, a teasing show of skin John unconsciously licked his lip to. The silky fabric continued downwards to her mid thigh, short, which was both flattering, as well as practical, John noticed, in case this ended with a chase. Even as ridiculously tall as she was, she didn’t hold back on shoes, strapped silver heels reaching around 3 inches high, and when he stood to greet her, he had to tilt his head up just to meet her eyes
Hesitantly, he placed his hand there, running rough fingers through the softest of hair, untangling and combing as he went
She met him, parting her lips instantly, but he pulled away a fraction of inch “let me” he said softly, his lips closing over hers in soft movements, and after a few minutes she wondered if it was possible to gain more sensitivity over time because it felt different, not like when he’d kissed her before, where it was hot and passion and desire, but now she felt warm, felt treasured, felt loved, and a tremor ran up her spine
And the detective turned her eyes back to microscope after a second and mumbled, almost under her breath but loud enough to hear ‘cheater’
“Dull” they said in union, rolling their eyes in sync
“But I try” He added after several minutes of silence, his voice piercing the speechless air and caused her to tense just slightly, before relaxing again, shoulders slumping
“Sherlock…?” He asked, cracking open one eye and blinking at the new level of brightness in the room
“We have visitors” she gestured towards the door
With a limp in his step, and the damage etched throughout every line and wrinkle on his face, he knew he didn’t exactly scream ‘great choice’ during first meetings
This chapter is very fluffy, enjoy
Sorry it took a while to post an update, and this chapter is a lil short :/
As would be in the future, she seemed to be moving a thousand miles a second, already deciding to move on in the conversation and it felt so much like being lost at sea, swept away where all he could do is nod and listen to her with an awestruck expression as she offer him an address
Let it be known the writer of this story is just as tall as Benedict Cumberbatch, and yes, I AM a girl, thank you very much. 183cm, exactly 6ft tall.
“That’s not the point. You should marry someone you love, not just someone who got you pregnant”
Reaching for the coffee table, he retrieved the remote, and allowed the flood of relief her words brought forth
“You’re giving me a massage”
According to my Word doc, we are exactly halfway thru the story! Let's go
Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
Yet what could he say, what could he possibly do? The red dots from snipers bounced and played across the expands of his body, threatening death with every slight movement, telling him to keep quiet, to let the geniuses talk
This chapter is longer so hope y'all can forgive me about my fickleness
“Your word against my own, I wonder whom John will believe” she chimed in, sounding much more smug than necessary
Who would ever want a flatmate like him?
“Lestrade isn’t”
“It would seem Lestrade and his wife are officially divorced” Sherlock deduced as she lazily swept her eyes over the DI’s desk “his character traits and personality compliment yours well”
He giggled, and she smiled, planting a feather light kiss to his lips before pulling back a fraction of an inch, her next words caressing over his skin with warm breaths “I’ve discovered I’m able to express certain emotions I’m unable to speak aloud at this point in time, certain sentiment that I once mocked a time ago”
I'm shit I know but here's the next chapter, sorry it's so late
Why was it every girlfriend ended like this; yelling, angry, and lacking in proper orgasms?
But when he and his flatmate were forced into a new twist, he was less than pleased
John beat her to it, handing it back with the soft smile he used whenever dealing with a jumpy patient
“Last night, after you accepted my proposal, that takes care of immediate family, including your sister”
tw for brief mentions of captivity
This was about how he felt completely and utterly useless when she wasn’t within arms reach. This was about how right then, in that very moment, he’d never felt further from her.
Clearly, the older Holmes’ knew his sister more than Sherlock would probably like
“You don’t just tolerate me. You actually enjoy my company and not for anything in return. You follow me into danger wherever it may be, and you never once doubted my abilities, nor wished I were a different person.”
“Trapping you like that. It’s so petty, but I guess I should’ve expected it, seems right up her alley, now, looking back.”
Completely escaping his notice (Sherlock would be so disappointed in him) was Ms. Holmes herself, arms crossed on the bed and head resting on them like a schoolgirl falling asleep on her desk, her shirt was still stained with blood, as was the hand that was closest to his, the area suggested she had at some point been holding his hand before falling asleep, knowing her it’d been out of making sure his pulse was steady rather than rely on a machine, her form of showing concern, not much support to be offered to an unconscious person anyway, she’d never hold onto him without a logical reason
Of course he was the one responsible for her disheveled appearance, Sherlock having pulled him into a nearby alley, telling him to hit her, something he would never do in a million years, so she repeated pushed, slapped, and actually punched him until he grabbed a hold of her to stop the attack, restraining her in the gentlest way possible as she thrashed about, leading to a rip in her too expensive of a shirt, the seaming pulled free in two places, buttons popping onto the floor, her hair more wild and disarrayed like she’d been through something serious, and he felt horrible even though he hadn’t done anything wrong
“Mycroft, really?”
Hands placed on the porcelain sink of the yard’s bathroom; she stared at her own reflection in the well-worn mirror.
“Is John with him?” she continued, and Sherlock sighed heavily
He didn’t reply, just continued to stare at the blank TV screen he hadn’t bothered to turn on
Hand over his face, annoyance at Sherlock’s assumption, like it was far off base
John Hamish Watson Jr.
“Sounds like her” John chuckled
“He’d do anything to make Mummy happy” she replied, leaving out the bit where her brother was entirely convinced the two would end up together anyways
Thanks for reading til the end!
Tea is more difficult to make than I had originally thought –SH
But the alcohol was wearing his stamina and far too quickly did he have the sense to pull out, his cum spraying over her nightshirt as he trembled, wordless cry leaving his lips and resting his forehead against her silk-clad shoulder
“So… That’s it? No threats?”
“John and I are to be wed, date pending, should you matter at all you’ll receive further details via email” She said with a tone of complete indifference, turning back towards John, who was turning a soft shade of pink, and rolling her eyes “There, now they know”
“Love like this only comes once in a life time, Sherlock.” She countered, “Now quiet down! This matters to John”
She was sorting, putting pieces of information gathered through the case in some special room in her mind palace to look at later, deleting what she found useless
“Has there been any word from Mycroft?” she asked after a few moments of silence, and John blinked a few times as if coming out from a daze
Her desire was insufferable, and…. –god yes-
John opened his mouth, before closing it again; pursing his lips in thought “I’m…not really sure, actually. Maybe”
this is honestly my longest fic I've ever written and tbh I'm proud of it, even if I'm no longer in the fandom (stopped watching after season 3)
“Keep trying different things and I’ll let you know” he grinned, before she bent forward and stole it from his lips
An hour in, and no disturbances, John wondered if tonight would be the night he finally managed to take someone home
Looking back, he realized it was at that very moment she seemed to capture all his attention, like the world had narrowed, tunneling his vision to the beautiful, tall genius. It wasn’t until much later did he realize just how much that Sherlock Holmes managed to take from him that day
Silence.
“I’m a doctor, you know…I know pregnancy…” He sighed as another message tone rung, his fingers already working their way back into his pocket to read it
“But of course,” her response was automatic as expected, before her lips twitched up at the corners “though there is a room similar to the one in which we are, modeled of 221b”
He joined her, because why the hell not? Curiosity getting the best of him, he shut his eyes and tried to imagine the inside of his head, only to be greeted with Baker St behind his closed lids
“Sherlock!” John huffed, turning towards her with a look of disbelief “You just had a baby!”
As if on cue, she heard the stairs creek in protest of her brother’s arrival, and she left her room with a vague mumble of ‘tea’ to John before greeting her brother at the doorway into the flat
“I don’t see why not. With a mattress this size there is at least a foot between us, even when we are both comfortably settled”
His fingers tightened around the plastic bags he held, clutching tighter than necessary as he slowly climbed the steps one at a time
He groaned, “Don’t remind me”
She couldn’t have made it clearer that nothing was different at the hospital, and in the month they’d be home, she hadn’t so much as held their child outside of feedings
“No, I get it.” John interrupted, holding up a hand with a friendly smile “Sherlock doesn’t really acknowledge anyone, just the way she is”
He stared, wide eyed at Sherlock, who remained unmoving across the couch, fingers pressed together under her chin
If it was up to her, she’d just sighed a marriage license, no hassle, no guests, or church, or ridiculous looking attires. Just her and John, as it should be.
“She was wrong, you know.” Sherlock answered his unasked question as she strolled into the flat, hanging her coat and stripping off the jacket underneath, leaving her in her silk button up shirt that probably cost more than John’s entire outfit combined
It was clear from his expression that it was something important to him, and she sighed before giving a “Very well”
for fanfics I don't publish on AO3
She froze in an instant, though; her body growing ridged and she lowered the violin, turning to face him, her face a controlled blank
Not that didn’t matter much to Sherlock
“Are you hurt?” Lestrade asked, his eyes quickly working over her slim figure, hunched shoulders, and the sporting new gash across her forehead that had been neatly cleaned and bandaged by the paramedic, one who had insisted on going to the hospital, only to leave with a frown, mumbling curses under his breath when Sherlock had refused and openly deduced his entire life to the rest of the ambulance
She was quiet for a few seconds, blinking at the sudden change in tension of the room, the turn of the conversation
Darting off gaze, sheepish posture
Sherlock did what any woman uninterested would do, her hips didn’t stop but her hands covered the strangers, pushing them down in rejection which the bastard took as invite to slide them down to her thighs, and John’s vision blurred with red as he saw him working his fingers up into her shorts
John raised one brow “And?”
“Who taught you?” He asked one day as she swayed in front of the window, the sleek instrument held gingerly in her hand, her chin propped on the rest. The melody of the day was something peaceful, lazy almost, like film music played during happy moments, not overpowering but something enjoyed nonetheless, touching the room with a feel of ease
He cleared his throat, and she didn’t mention it at all
The swarm of doctors monitoring every little thing to ensure a safe birth, Sherlock’s cries of agony, the biting pain of her strong hand squeezing his, and the beeping of machines became a blur of worry and sweat, until finally, John heard what he swore was the most beautiful sound in the world
Immediately the child clung to it, though kept his eyes closed
Tw: Drugs/mentions of past drug use
“He wouldn’t know”
If he shifted up an inch or two, those soft looking locks would caress his face
______________________
“I love you”
She heard the sound of footsteps slowly receding, and was pleased to know the woman was gone by the time she turned around
if you wanna get in contact with me
But this wasn’t something she could let up
I won't be picking up any of my Sherlock fics, tho, sorry y'all, this is the only one I'll be finishing
“How?” He asked, though he wasn’t exactly sure he wanted to know
It wasn’t that he was curious about her sex life, or that he felt he had the right to know, but the idea of Sherlock not having been with anyone, tall, beautiful, genius Sherlock, it didn’t seem plausible, but she hadn’t denied the nickname Mortiary gave her, leaving John to believe that maybe he was right
Annoyance, embarrassment, and though she’d never admit it, a small swell of pride
Seemed children were not his strong suit
She realized a second late that she was coming; it hit her, hard, and she lunged forward, fingernails digging into the forearms still holding her, her forehead resting on the curve of his good shoulder as she shuddered, moaning something the could’ve been his name, if it wasn’t half cut off with a gasp
“You want me, your flatmate”
“Hmm…” She hummed appreciatively, weaving her fingers into his hair and giving a jerk of her hips and his lips met her folds
John looked back, having already gone off in his own thoughts on what else was needed to maintain Sherlock’s healthy diet, a shopping list halfway made in his mind
“Repair man, works exclusively in motels. Look for a middle-aged man, overweight…” She paused only to use a nearby stick to lift the flab of the dead man’s coat “His Manager, he was to be fired, things got physical. Accidental death” she finished smoothly, pulling off her gloves to shove them in her coat as she stood
Her long thin fingers dug their way into her unruly curls and pulled them loose, allowing them to fall around her face in uneven waves of brown that looked almost red in the noon lighting flickering in from the window
For a few glorious seconds, he looked completely at a loss for words, such a rare sight, before closing his half open mouth, turning on his heels, and quickly descending down the stairs
After all, that’s what he’d become for her in the two years he’d known her, right? A blanket to wrap herself in during moments where the world wasn’t allowed to see what she chose to hide, and so she hid, behind closed doors and only in his presence was any vulnerability allowed to be seen, only in his arms did she sleep, trusting and relaxed
She looked up at him, surprised, as if she hadn’t noticed he’d woken up
Beware that the chapters start to get kinda short as the story progresses but there will be a lot more before the story ends
I have a daughter, that's my only excuse for not updating more often, especially considering I finished this story like two years ago and just don't update? Idk, I forget tbh, I only remembered cause someone commented recently
There was no room for him to sit, as if she made sure of it every time she dominated the sofa. Deciding to take the risk, he simply reached down and lifted her legs by the fabric of her trousers, smiling softly at the widening of her eyes in surprise, the contact snapping her out of her own thoughts. He sat himself down, before replacing her legs upon his lap, reaching for the control to turn on the telly
He froze, squinting his eyes and moving his left hand to look at the piece of jewelry, “Well, I know that bit, Sherlock” he said, still not grasping what she meant
The sound of the steps being climbed was drowned out by the mix of laughter and the string of curses John threw around, their legitimate training dissolving quickly into a half assed wrestling match between the two, evenly matched, while John had much more experience, Sherlock’s cleverness and overall flexibility were working in her favor, and when the door of their flat was opened, they were rolling about, ending with John on top, pinning Sherlock’s wrists to the floor with a “Ha! Got you!”
“I was present when Mummy gave birth to you, I find it fitting to attend the next Holmes’ birth as well”
“John…” she half moaned, fingers applying gentle pressure in encouragement
“You want me to sleep there, with you?”
He could only handle so much, after all
“Better?” She smirked, staring at him through half lidded eyes as she repeated the motion, swirling him inside herself and searching for ah yes…perfect, she sighed, giving a half crazed smile which he responded to with a giggle
He peeked an eye open, looking at her surprisingly peaceful face, and if it weren’t for the fact it was Sherlock lying there, he would’ve assumed she was asleep
She had something to do that didn’t involve breaking, burning, or slicing something, and that was a definite improvement, he could deal with a few random moans now and then if that was the trade off
“You’re…asking me… That’s not how it usually works” John cracked a small smile as her words slowly sunk in
So lets get this chapter out of the way, and I'll tell y'all something else at the end of the chapter
“And why not?” She sighed, the sigh she reserved when John was being especially slow at seeing something
“There were plenty of other women interested in Victor, and my physical appeal only went so far. The difference in intelligence was rather vast, something he was prone to sulk about; as if it was my fault he wasn’t particularly bright”
Sherlock hadn’t reacted in the slightest, simply looking around, noting all the details and announcing where the other children were being held, immediately departing after that.
He couldn’t argue with that, that lust and jealousy could drive people to do insane things, but at its core, he couldn’t see sex as anything but beautiful, if done the right way
“Come on, Sally…I’ll… walk you out” John tried hesitantly, glancing at Sherlock as he spoke to check her reaction
Mycroft looked towards the child with a sheepish expression, softly shaking his head
This was to be expected by now, of course, he’d grown so accustomed to Sherlock’s fits of boredom, but never once had it gone this far
“I’ve been injured before”
He had gone out on a date for his birthday, the flavor of the month girlfriend taking him out to dinner with a couple of her friends, so he got ready like he always would, shower and shave, not hearing a word about the date from Sherlock, though by the fact she’d stolen his birth certificate at some point she knew what day it was on, but either she couldn’t be bothered to say anything, or was so lost in their case slump to care for what day it was
“Explain”
“Any others you have yet to voice?”
“It kinda is” he laughed, gesturing to the mess of his and her wedding attire tossed about the hotel room floor, the sheets tangled and sweaty underneath them
“Good” she replied, standing and heading towards the kitchen to her bedroom to hide her embarrassment “I’ll go check on our son”
A little sign that meant so much to any potential women in John’s life
The second it closed after Mycroft walked in, the older sibling got right to the point, rare as it was for him to not talk around the issue until Sherlock wanted to claw out her eardrums
Mints for the nausea are also needed –SH
I no longer write for this fandom so sorry to see y'all move on to different authors, I hope you enjoyed my work
Lestrade cleared his throat, and John looked up, Sherlock tilting her head back on the floor to follow his gaze
And there were other cases, like whenever she acted, pretending to have been a robbery victim for Irene, she slipped into the role so flawlessly John’s fingers twitched to hurt the imagery men that harmed her
By John's remembrance of the map they should be reaching the area where the item was kept here soon when a shout came from behind them. Sherlock chirruped and like John was guessing, struggled to turn around in the narrow hall. He could see guards coming, swords raised and yelped when Sherlock shifted beneath him. John hit the ground rather hard but struggled to get back to his feet, reaching for his dagger. The dragon stepped between them though, wings stretched protectively and a snarl ripped through the man. The first guard lunged wildly and Sherlock sidestepped him slightly, grabbing the hand holding the sword and knocking him in the back of the head with his other hand. He tossed the man aside with ease, sword still in hand and turned to face the other guards who looked a little more worried now that the humanoid dragon had a sword in hand. John watched Sherlock grin then spin in to the first attack, driving the man back, parrying every blow he tried then knocking him in the side of the head with the flat of his blade. John didn't know it was possible for the dragon to be much more impressive than he already was, but as he stood there gaping at the dragon taking on all four of the guards at once, sword swinging gracefully, he smiled softly.
“John?” Mike stuttered, dropping the rolls of bandages he'd been holding. “What happened to you?” He quickly moved to cut the ropes John had tied himself down with, helping the man down and pulling his arm around his shoulder to help him move into the medical tent. John was sat down on a cot and Mike quickly went to work, cutting away the soiled bandages around his leg. Molly was at his elbow in a second, a bowl of clean water in her hands and clean bandages tucked against her side. Sherlock was in the tent a moment later in his human form, a pair of shorts pulled on haphazardly, and the bag with their package tucked under his arm. He sat the bag next to John and took the spot on the other side of the soldier, pressing into his side gently.
“Your brother?” John exclaimed and almost fell off his seat if Sherlock hadn't grabbed his arm to steady him. “Why did your brother attack me?”
“I am general Zane,” he finally called out when everyone had settled. “I am in charge of the dragon division of the army.” As he talked an obsidian dragon made its way onto the stage, settling itself in and staring down all the dragons lined up. Beside him Sherlock started to growl softly and John hushed him. “For the trip over your dragons will need to be in human form. We simply don't have the space to accommodate that many dragons in full form. You will be filtered through 3 rooms where your dragons will change and don their jumpsuits for the journey. Convene outside for our departure.” As they were dismissed Sherlock shoved his way towards one of the changing rooms with John jogging to catch up and offering apologies to people. As the door shut behind him John breathed a sigh of relief and flushed as Sherlock changed. His nudeness never bothered him so he walked without any show of shyness to gather the jumpsuit from a stack in the room.
John was close to drifting off when his branch shook, making him gasp in fear. Sherlock's big head was thrust into his arms, deep purring noises instantly calming him as he stroked the dragon's crest gingerly. Big golden eyes looked up at him, taking in his face and examining his injuries. He chirruped sadly and John shook his head, smiling up at the dragon.
John opened his mouth a few times, blinking in confusion, before shaking his head in disapproval
Keep it and lose her life, or terminate it and lose John
“Are you alright?” then, “You bloody idiot, I could have really hurt you!”
“Of course”
“Hmm?”
Their worst one had gone away, apparently losing interest in Sherlock when she developed a taste for ‘ordinary’ and she was no longer fun in Moriarty’s eyes, John was grateful to the madman for his short attention span. Moriaty never made any effort to contact either of them once Sherlock had gotten pregnant.

“Sorry?
“It would appear so” Sherlock replied, flipping open her mobile to read and reply to the message
“Ridiculous rule, but John refused to let up on it”
“Come, then, John” his flatmate said, leaning her slim body against his door frame, one perfect brow raised in annoyance and expectancy
“Perhaps in your emotional state, it’s best to-”
Tall as she was, she leaned over him, and their breath mingled together, causing the humidity in the air to rise as quickly as his heart rate, their noses brushing while she stared from out the crack between the doors, intensely focusing on the room
“Regardless, what I was trying to express is the two are one in the same for me. And it’s obvious that you love me” she looked at him, though her tone strong and confident her eyes holding a sense of uneasy “or am I wrong?”
“Love. Sherlock”
But there were some things that didn’t change, some habits that never went away, and that bit was obvious every once in a while
“Hmm” she responded, and did as he asked

“How’s your son?” Donovan’s voice cut off the detective’s train of thought, her glove hand running over the dust trail left on the window panel

“Mycroft will be by to pick you up after school” John said, kneeling down to fix Junior’s school tie “No deleting information you find irrelevant without first asking me, not your mother, no deducing or insulting the other children, remember that people aren’t here for your entertainment, and even physical games can be fun”
‘Leave us’
“Four in total. Three men, one woman; and she’s the ring leader.” He titled his head just slightly “Um…They’re all big, very big, taller than you, Mother, but she’s just as short as Papa” he gave a vague wave towards John and the doctor felt his cheeks pink at being called short by his own son “They’re close, closer than people normally are, since they haven’t been caught yet and they follow all her instructions. I want to say siblings, but… It doesn’t feel right”
“Just brushing up an bit on my own ‘mind palace’, obviously not as good as yours”
“Has he finally gotten old enough to follow you onto cases?” Lestrade asked, turning towards them as they entered the building
“Yeah. He phoned earlier. Your parents decided against the baby shower”
“He did. Though switched to the piano out of humiliation, more fitting for him anyways, seeing as it’s more common for the musician to remain seated during the entire performance”
“Still got that tongue on ya, huh? Thought you’d take care of that by now, mate” the man laughed, nudging John with his elbow and the doctor let out an uncomfortable laugh
(See the end of the chapter for
She just stared at him, expectantly
Anyways, there's only four chapters left in this fic
She rose on brow before smirking “Hmm, I wouldn’t have taken you for a man with a stocking fetish, John” She moved, placing on knee on his chair and moving to straddle his lap
This was bad, it wasn’t good at all, because now she felt like she was on fire, parts in her starting to melt, ice she didn’t even know was there, was slowly thawing away with John’s warmth, his affection, his very bit of feeling he poured into each movement, and it was overwhelming, she blinked rapidly before squeezing her eyes shut at the unexpected tears building, having no place in what they were doing, yet she was hit with the strongest urge to cry, to weep with either joy or pent up pain
“Sherlock” John warned under his breath
“Will I be able to solve crimes like you one day, mother?” Junior asked as she approached the two, readying to leave
tw: mention of drug abuse
She simply wiped her lips with the back of her hand, walked off, and locked herself in her bedroom, leaving him flustered, confused, and oh so turned on, having to make an awkward walk up to his bedroom to take care of the problem himself
As if having a son born from their actions would change anything, she would suddenly realize she had a heart, she wanted something outside of endless puzzles of mutilated bodies
He let out a hum of appreciation and relaxed further into the touch, trying to remember who it was he shared his bed with last night
I'll try to update soon, but no promises, since it's pride month and a lot of ppl are buying my LGBTPN merch off Etsy, I'm gonna get a lil busy making them as well as coming up with new designs
“Moriarty,” Sherlock finally mumbled, blue eyes glancing up at John. “He's very interested in me for some reason. I haven't yet figured out why.” John sat up and started as Sherlock climbed up beside him, pressing into his shoulder.
“ 's all right,” John chuckled. “I needed one too. I'm hungry and gotta pee.” Sherlock's eyes scanned the surrounding area suspiciously before nodding with a grunt. He started digging through their food supplies bag so John wandered off into the woods to find a suitable tree.
“I remember you saying adventure, you're clearly army. Army requires their higher officers and medical professionals to have dragons these days. You're a doctor which is how you ended up with me, so where are we going? Afghanistan or Iraq?”
They flew for hours, Sherlock's steadily beating wings the only sound in the night. John was stiff and getting tired, hands frozen around the saddle handle and eyes watering. Sherlock chirruped suddenly, drawing John's attention forward to where Bowen and Lestrade had started to descend.
“It looks great!” John declared, turning his leg this way and that to examine the new splint. It was exactly what he was wanting for some extra protection. “Thanks Sherlock.” He smiled up at the dragon who was blushing from the praise, but snorted and looked away at John's gaze. “It's almost sunset, we should head towards the gate.” John watched Sherlock's shoulders slump and the dragon let out a sigh before changing back in to his dragon form. He helped pull the harnesses over the drake's head and strapped them in to place, attaching his packs.
Sherlock was hotter than he'd ever felt before and nuzzled in to his neck, purring happily. He started to shift which was very strange when the dragon was on top of him and John turned bright red when he had a very naked Sherlock crouched over him, smoke still trailing from the corner of his mouth. His pupils were still cat-like in his blue eyes, wings widening in an impressive display. “Mine,” he growled lowly, bending and kissing John possessively. The soldier moaned, opening his mouth to that talented forked tongue and felt Sherlock's hardened length press against his leg. He was rutting slowly and languidly against his thigh, slightly clawed hands running down his sides and then grabbing his hip. John pulled away to gasp for air and Sherlock moved to his neck, lapping, sucking, and biting at every inch of skin he could find. His teeth had sharpened so the occasional nip made John gasp and his hips would surge up in to the dragon's, making him growl.
The doctor caught him as he fell and sank to the floor, his love cradled in his arms. “Hey now, it’s all right. I’m here.” John continued to whisper reassurances and stroke the man’s dark hair as he took stock of the situation. He began to create a list of facts as Sherlock had taught him.
“I… I almost…” He glanced at the pencil and the words began to flood out. “I wanted to, but I knew you’d be disappointed. I wasn’t going to do much, just enough to clear the fog. I wasn’t even going to use a blade, just the pencil, but I knew it would upset you, but here I am now upsetting you anyway. God, this is hateful.
Sherlock didn’t pull away at the touch this time and John decided that was probably a good sign. They sat like that, John rubbing the back of Sherlock’s hand with his thumb, for a few more minutes before John realized that he should probably try to clean and bandage Sherlock’s injuries.
John hesitated then quietly said “Come on. You know how I feel, surely. You’re bloody Sherlock Holmes.”
was hateful. Not only did his body betray him on a regular basis with shuddering breaths and hands that shook so much he couldn’t even play the violin, but his mind had denounced him too and that was something with which he just couldn’t cope. He needed something to ground him, something to clear his mind of the raging emotions clouding his thoughts. He looked around for his mechanical pencil.
Sherlock didn’t resist. Quite the opposite. Finally feeling somewhat at peace for the first time since the crime scene, he laid down curled in a loose ’S’ shape with his head in the doctor’s lap.
The scene changed again, this time to an imagined scenario. Sherlock didn’t have control over these. They invaded his mind with what-ifs and pain and fear even though none of the things had ever actually happened.
John.
help at the moment.
Sherlock couldn’t figure out why John was being so kind to him.
“Sherlock? Sherlock, listen to me. You need to breathe.” The doctor took their entwined hands and placed Sherlock’s palm against John’s own chest, making his breaths slow and deep, trying to project calm.
Eventually he gave up his worrying and settled down for a good night’s sleep.
Sherlock carefully took the teacup from John’s hands and placed it on the table.
Sherlock spoke very quietly. “I had a… a friend, Kai. In secondary school. He did what you came in on me doing a lot.” He couldn’t bring himself to say self-harming or cutting out loud. “He used a combination of emotional manipulation and threats to convince me that he needed me in order to be safe.” Sherlock couldn’t keep a few more tears from slipping down his pallid cheeks.
it when you called me those things.” Tears began to leak from his eyes and John reached with lightly trembling hands to wipe them away.
“Stupid, stupid, stupid!” he quietly berated himself. This mantra of self-loathing was an almost nightly ritual by this point, giving voice to the anger and fear he felt. The entire situation was hateful.
“But,” he said, throwing words out jerkily through the hyperventilation, “but you… you like sex. You c-can’t argue that you d-d-don’t.” He glanced meaningfully at the bulge visible through John’s sweatpants.
John looked at him with an expression that was a mixture of concern and exasperation. “Yeah, but part of what makes it fun is having both parties equally invested in the whole process. I don’t want you to force yourself to have sex with me if you don’t want to.” He paused for a moment before going on to compare sex to cases.
TW: Referenced Self-harm
“The sofa springs. Uhm, your, your hand in my hair.” A hand reached out to try and find another sensation. “And my dressing gown.”
From somewhere deep within his mind palace the logical part of his brain was screaming at him that this wasn’t true and that John really did want to take care of him. Unfortunately, that part of his brain hadn’t been in control for weeks.
John was just leaving the conference center when his phone rang. Lestrade.
“No. No, no, no.” He looked into John’s eyes with abject terror. “Please, no, don’t!”
After a minute or so more of (rather passionate) kissing, John suddenly found himself being pulled onto Sherlock, straddling his lap, with Sherlock’s hands on his arse. They had never done anything like this before, and John was somewhat surprised, but altogether too aroused to argue with it. He involuntarily began to grind lightly into the detective’s lap as they kissed, fingering the hem of Sherlock’s simple white t-shirt.
The younger man was still gasping for breath, but he seemed to be more aware of his surroundings.
“‘M srry… Shouldn’ be ths way…” he slurred.
John entered the sitting room with a teapot and two teacups on a tray belonging to Mrs. Hudson. As he placed the tray on the coffee table, he glanced over at his friend who was sitting back on the sofa, trying much too hard to look relaxed. The doctor planned on keeping Sherlock up for a bit until he seemed calm enough to sleep, and then trick him into sleeping in the same room. Somehow. He wasn’t completely clear on that part of the plan yet. Sherlock was looking at him, a slightly strange look in his eyes.
you like he did.”
The call with Lestrade was harder on Sherlock than he’d like to admit. He’d had to state some very specific things for the slightly-less-idiotic-than-most Detective Inspector which had made his knees feel strangely weak. Even so, he thought that he had managed quite well. Surely Lestrade wouldn’t notice anything was wrong.
“John, I’m sorry,” the detective whispered, tears still trailing down his face.
John’s voice held no anger, but the words were accusatory.
“At first it was just a casual friendship. Then one night he called me and told me he wanted to commit suicide. I talked him down. From then on we talked every night until very, very late. The habit I built in that year is why I barely sleep now. Our conversations were average, at first, with some extra attempts at comfort from my end. Eventually…” The man shuddered, and John looked at him with concern, but he continued. “Eventually he started telling me he loved me. I was only 16 at the time, John, I didn’t know what that meant, so I said it back. I made it clear I meant it completely platonically and he… didn’t take that well.”
Lestrade humpfed. “Right. Well, this is Kylie Horan, 24, reported missing two days ago.”
Kai was using his name. Kai didn’t use Sherlock’s name. He managed a slightly deeper breath and looked up at the person on top of him. Blond hair. Kai had dark brown hair that bordered on black. Why was this hair blond? Why was he being asked what
. He lay on the couch the whole day, not getting up for anything more than a cup of tea at 4pm.
Sherlock didn’t speak. He just stared at John, eyes wide with panic, chest heaving shallowly.
Suddenly though, as Kai reached his pulse point, the kisses ceased. “W-why’d you stop?” asked Sherlock, scared for what would come next. He was sure he’d done something wrong. He usually had.
The frantic apologies continued, though it was obvious the detective was beginning to tire. His words were slurring together at this point and his shaking had evolved into the occasional full body shudder or convulsion. Finally, some new words entered the picture, though unfortunately, not ones John had hoped to hear.
of Sherlock’s prior abuse. Kai had convinced Sherlock that it was his job to keep him happy and pleased, even going so far as forcing him to undress and show himself to Kai over a video call. The only reason that hadn’t carried on to actually physically forcing him was that they hadn’t seen each other in person, though not for lack of trying. Thank God for that. He was fairly sure that Sherlock had never been with another person until he and the detective had begun their relationship, so naturally, Sherlock’s only experience with romantic partners was as a means to an end, namely, his partner’s pleasure and emotional wellbeing, and if he didn’t fulfill that end, he believed he would be punished.
The scene changed again.
“Thank you, John.”
“Sherlock, look at me.”
If John’s heart was already shattered, that statement pulverized it into dust. “Sherlock, you are the single strongest person I know. Whatever happened, whatever trauma caused this, I will never think less of you for it.” He eased his arms around the still-trembling man in front of him, and Sherlock relaxed a bit into his embrace, still clutching at John’s jumper. John leaned down into him and pressed his lips to the top of Sherlock’s head in a not-quite-kiss and stroked the other man’s damp, curly hair.
“Six, so far. Background?”
As he once again tended to the taller man’s wounds, John thought about what to do next. Obviously leaving Sherlock alone wasn’t really an option at the moment. The man really needed some sleep, but knowing him, he’d probably force himself to stay awake to avoid a nightmare if John was in the room with him. John decided on a plan of action.
“No…” he said weakly. “Don’t… don’t take it…”
, he supposed. John shouldn’t have to put up with this, but Sherlock was going along with it anyway. Just another way he was weak. It isn’t John’s job to take care of Sherlock. Sherlock is the fixer, never the one needing to be fixed.
John kneeled on the floor in front of Sherlock and gently took his friend’s hands in his. “It’s okay, Sherlock. It’s all right. I’m here now. Whatever happened, it’ll be all right now.”
“Yeah?” John asked, trying to keep his voice level and reassuring. “What about my hair?”
Sherlock sat up out of the embrace and slowly rolled up the sleeves of his blue dressing gown, revealing pale forearms covered in blue and purple splotches. Some were fading to green or yellow and some were only a day or so old. Refusing to look John in the eye, he turned his hands over so John could see the broken skin on his knuckles from punching concrete.
away before they caused him any great difficulty, but this time it seemed that was impossible. Five weeks and… how many days? He couldn’t remember. His mind was too full of the past to be aware of the present. John tried to help but Sherlock kept insisting everything was fine.
John’s heart did flips as he tried to navigate the combination of relief and sadness that welled up inside of him as he took the thin, long arms in his hands and inspected the self-inflicted injuries. He tried to think of what to say that couldn’t be twisted by Sherlock’s mind into something negative. Eventually, he spoke. “Sherlock, I’m glad you told me. I’m not disappointed. I wish you had come to me earlier, sure, but I’m not disappointed. I’m not angry.”
It had been several weeks since Sherlock and John had returned from their mission. Sherlock had remained if possible both incredibly distant but constantly near. The dragon was always within sight, but he remained in his dragon form most of the time, avoiding talking to the soldier. John spent most of his time resting his leg and reading. There was a small collection of books at the camp and it didn't take him long to work through most of them. Sherlock seemed to find the books fascinating and would slide under John's feet and listen to the soldier read aloud. This is when the dragon was most relaxed, eyes heavily lidded and wings drooped across the ground. John was reading rhythmic lines of Thoreau when he was summoned to meet with General Bowen.
“Well,” he huffed, glancing at the egg. “That was interesting.”
“Test passed,” the general chuckled. “Very well done.” John turned back to the general, Sherlock reluctant to let him out of the protection of his wing.
“If it wasn't for you I'd be dead,” Sherlock said simply as he drew away. He ran a hand through his curls again and got to his feet. “I'm gonna keep watch for a little while, go back to sleep.” He stepped forward sliding into his dragon form before John could say anything else and slipped out the door. John scratched his head in confusion but curled back up on his cot, pulling his blanket up around his shoulders.
“This is Molly,” Mike introduced, gesturing to the dragon next to him. “Had her about 3 months now. She's an earth dragon.” Molly refused to make eye contact with John and especially Sherlock.
When Sherlock finally returned a couple hours later John had a roaring fire going and had even heated up some stones to trade out of the egg's nest. Sherlock chirruped happily at that and dropped the deer he'd killed at the entrance to the cave. He changed as he walked, scooping up the shorts John had left out for him and ruffling his golden hair. He yanked them on quickly, the waist band hanging lower on his hips than usual and went to check on the egg.
