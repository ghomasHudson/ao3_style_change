Sherlock says, averting his eyes from the terrifying werewolf poster. “How was your first day teaching?
221b is thankfully quiet, and John instantly relaxes. Mrs. Hudson is baking again, and the whole flat smells like biscuits. He’s home.
The last weeks have been trying for them. With Mary returning out of the shadows, taking Sherlock as hostage, hurting him until he fell unconscious and then killing Mycroft with a shot in the head, well. They haven’t got much sleep. Mycroft’s funeral was two weeks ago, and Sherlock has just now started resting, trying to recover from years of neglect, drug abuse, torture, malnutrition and dangerous injuries. On top of that, John had to spent days laying in bed, resting his bad shoulder, which was strained pretty badly when he killed his wife.

Old Marley disappeared into the night, and suddenly there were loud screams everywhere.

Sherlock boasts.
John asks worried.
His fingers wandered to the small fabric, and he ripped it away. The slave was now completely naked, and John could enjoy the view. The gladiator settled in the space between Sherlock’s legs and opened his own tunica. It gathered around his midsection, and he had to get up to kick it away. He was now standing in front of the bed, and the two men studied each other.
The toilet has only two stalls and the smell of cheap cleaner reminds Sherlock of a hospital. He starts throwing water into his face and rubs his eyes, hoping that it will make him feel more awake. If he wants to go through with his by seducing John into a kiss at home, he needs to be a bit more functioning. Functioning in this case means that he is able to climb the stairs on his own, an ability which Sherlock is not so sure of at the moment.
“Good,
While John was looking at

Sherlock wonders if John likes small talk, or if he is as bored by this kind of socializing as he is. One glance at John’s shaking hands confirms it.
We are done here, Miss
He gesticulates wildly through the room. Nevertheless, the two start to sort through the huge piles. Molly throws two more strings around the shelves, why Sherlock drags the kitchen table from Mrs. Hudson’s living rooms to the store.
By Merlin’s beard, no. A growing mountain of paperwork forms itself in Sherlock's mind.
“I’m disappointed, Mr. Holmes!
"Are you sure?“
“And you haven’t even caught a glimpse of our brand-new bed.
“That is good to hear, dear. Who is that?
Usually, Sherlock and John return from their adventures after a few hours. Not this time, and they did not pack their black bags either. Only John returned for a few minutes one evening, getting a new jumper and taking a quick shower. He mostly ignored Gladstone apart from a bit of scratching his ears. Gladstone could smell blood and worry on John‘s jumper, and he noticed his lips pressed tightly together.
Sherlock shrugs: “Write a note to

“Maybe we can send Mycroft in there tomorrow.
Mary had strapped him onto the table with long belts and ropes that cut into his pale flesh. She had discarded his ridiculous coat, his dark jacket and the polished shoes. The detective looked deliciously exposed without his armour. An IV bag with the precious hallucinogen was hanged on back of the chair and had carried the substance into his arm for over 50 hours now. Another one had been added to get some fluids into him. Mary didn’t want him to die too soon.
Luckily, the game only takes a few more minutes now. Their team won, and Irene, Molly and Sherlock hug each other in celebration, while the commentators voice can finally be heard.
“You are my friend Sherlock. In fact, you have become my best friend. If anything bothers you, you can tell me. Whatever you are going through, you won’t have to do it alone.
His trousers and pants were now down to his knees, and John saw the abomination at once. His face did something complicated. Shock, horror, sadness and then so much anger. His eyes were shooting sparks.
John whispers into Sherlock’s ear and rubs his back.
“Sorry.
Sherlock nods, suddenly wide awake: “I will get my coat.

A glass wand separated the interrogator from the prisoner, and John is glad for that. Mary’s head jumped up immediately when she saw him, and a big smile broke out on her face.
The man coughed awkwardly: “Unfortunately, his body is weak, he must be suffering from an illness. We don’t what it is.
John needs someone healthy in his life, someone with stability and empathy.
Sherlock cries. “Christmas is ages away.
“A bit, yes.

John shushed at Sherlock, who started crying again, and rubbed his belly.
“Anything for my best gladiator! Come with me now.
“I know this was your last class, I peeked at your schedule. Don’t tell me you are still forcing them to do homework.
I am going to start the auction now!

The slave tried to push against his masters, but they hold him tight and finally cuffed him to the stake. There was an iron collar around his long neck, which must be quite uncomfortable, manacles around his wrists and ankles, and the seller pushed a gag in his mouth and tied something around his head to keep him quiet. He was wearing a bit of fabric around his waist. There was a big bruise over his left eye and several others across his body. One foot was whitened with chalk, indicating he was a new one from abroad. The young man also wore a
Mycroft obviously had some plan of occupying John's time in order to take him away from the clinic, in fact it would scare him if Mycroft ever DIDN'T have several plans waiting in the wings for whatever things he wanted done. And knowing how much Mycroft probably still wanted him to look after Sherlock, it was probably a damn interesting one that didn't take up too much time and wouldn't interfere with Sherlock's own mad schemes or schedule too badly. He wondered how long he could keep it from Mycroft though, that smarmy bastard would NEVER get the smirk off his face if he thought he had won so easily, and Sherlock would never forgive him if he gave in without a fight.
A young man raised his hand. "Trained phlebotomist Sir."

"So few people, away from their compound, without an astronomical event, note, video, any sign of connection, or the signs of a suicide ritual? John do try to keep up."
“Yeah.
The two men smile carefully at each other.

whispered Sherlock in a very small voice. It went quite as a tomb in the room. John regarded him nervously, licking his lips.

The bus is crowded as well, and some 14 year old shout over the sound of their phones at each other. John just wants to go home.
“Wow.
"You tried to commit suicide."
Moriarty smiles and points his wand again.
“How about I stay there in the corner with my tea, and you come over to me in your break, and we will continue talking?
again.
John pondered the question of Sherlock’s strange behaviour right now, when he suddenly realized it: Sherlock must not have seen London in who-knows how many months, and Sherlock loved his city.
“John, I have a terrible headache.
“Of course, my men confiscated everything. They are looking through her electronic devices as we speak.”
“That’s amazing, Sherlock!
Professor Watson, Professor Holmes!
Sherlock shouts, drops the poster and nearly the cactus, before John’s arms envelope (Jesus, his new muscles!) him and rip him right off his feet, like he has done since school. Christ, Sherlock loves this man so much.
Not that he can go to a hospital.
"There is actually one thing I would like to change.“
The sound was loud and nauseating, worse than a gunshot, and Sherlock’s boneless body collapsed to the ground, like his brother did.
The assistant smiles relieved.
“I have not received any complaints so far.
“Alright, I just have to ask.
. There is no reason to go anywhere. You haven’t got nearly enough sleep. Rest, Sherlock.
Sherlock follows the voice, and then John is crushing into him, strong arms winding around his waist, Sherlock's phone safely in his hand. John must have caught it with his fast rugby reflexes.
“Hey.
A warm arm settles around his shoulder. Sherlock doesn’t have to look to see that it’s John, he can recognize him from his smell, a bit of wool, tea and something that says purely John Watson.
"I had to throw it all out to make room for the gingerbread.“ Sherlock explains, as if that’s a perfectly normal sentence you hear everyday. The detective is sitting at their kitchen table, drinking his tea.
He whispers, voice quivering in fear while he searches for any marks on John’s beautiful body. By every god that is supposedly out there, please did not let him hurt John Watson.
Santa explains, and gets out his pocket knife. Or was it already in his hand, and Sherlock didn’t notice it through his blurry eye vision? He looks at it warily. Somehow, this knife brings back bad memories, but Sherlock isn’t able to say why.
John pressed a short kiss on his forehead: “Of course. Take all the time you need.“
He patted his cheek. Sherlock's world dissolved into nothingness.
“We had a fight a few hours before Mary kidnapped me.
“Are you worried I forgot my name?
“Nice of Mary to take care of us. We must have been absolutely wasted.
John Watson was sitting on Charles Augustus
“Remember what you said to me, on our first shared evening at Hogwarts? I am not haunted by danger, I miss it. Together with you, every day is different from the last, because you brought the thrill back into my life. I will not let a stupid bite deter me from keeping you for the rest of our lives.
“Everything okay?” John asked nervously. Did Sherlock detect someone suspicious?
“Our boys are fighting again. On our holiday!
“SHERLOCK!
„Don’t cry, Sherlock. Parents hate it when you do. I am sure someone will come pick you up soon too.“
Their marriage is supposed to hold the piece between the two kingdoms and bring their families closer together. Sherlock knows that his family is nowhere near as strong as the Watson’s and that they would have lost the war sooner or later. The Watson’s know that too, and that’s why he was sent to their kingdom to live there, and not vice versa.
Sherlock sinks down deeper into his chair, fiddling with his collar. He resists the urge to touch his lips, where he can still feel John’s touch.
Sherlock whispers, and John pushes a sweaty curl out of his face. Their breaths grow slower.
He had read Love, Simon on the train journey. Sherlock had expected the book to last for his whole trip, but it turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining and funny book. Of course, he figured out who the mysterious
’s home, who looked way to pale for an ice-man, and they waited.
Sherlock answers.
Tomorrow, he will take the time to delete their accidental kisses from his mind palace. John clearly does not feel the same way, now probably even less that he knows Sherlock is a werewolf. Sherlock has more he ever dreamed off, there is no reason to endanger this.
“I’ve missed you.
John finally found the courage to cut open Sherlock formerly white and now completely grey shirt. His clothes would wander into the bin immediately. Sherlock’s ribs were way too visibly, and again, dark bruises were everywhere. John took a look at Sherlock’s back and gasped in horror. Sherlock’s back was filled with whip lashes, none of them treated, and several looked infected. John laid a hand on Sherlock’s forehead, the detective was burning up.
The voice says again. Sherlock is now truly alarmed and begins to sprint away, hopefully away from the mysterious person.

time. Sherlock wishes Mister Watson had given him something to eat, his stomach is hurting from the hunger.
John exclaims a bit lamely. They have both momentarily forgotten what they originally set out to do.
A few months after he travelled away, Sherlock had followed his fathers on a day trip to the next bigger city. His father had spoken to the slaver, received a purse of money, and left. He probably told his mother that her youngest son had run away.
Mrs. Hudson’s request saved him from any more inquiries, since Molly looked ready to burst with questions.
, at the electronic store it’s “Driving home for Christmas
Sherlock teases. Then he grows serious again: “I love this country, because it’s so much like you: beautiful, wild, but very soft underneath.
“We could play wizard
Gladstone snuggles himself between Sherlock’s neck and his shoulder.
They all eat a bit more biscuits, and John tells the Queen that he would be delighted to join the family on Christmas.
He blinked.
“WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!
“Don’t ever do that again.
. Most important for him was the storage with his prepared medicine and instruments. John noticed his slave looking at it with interest.

Wait, I know that one
John greeted Mrs
John wondered if this was the first time Mary had been honest with him.
The Ghost observed
“Christ, it’s hot in here.
While he was sitting there, John made up a plan. It couldn’t have taken more than a few seconds, but everything moved so much more slowly at the moment.
He searched through the guests. Mary didn’t have many family members, and most of them, his fiancée cheerfully admitted, did not like her. They were situated at the back of the room. After that came a few of his university mates (who also hated him, thanks Sherlock!) and army buddies. Bill winked at him, and John smiled tightly back. The rest were some random relatives on his side who he didn’t really care about.
corpse!
"For weeks. Or to be honest, since the day I met you.“
He hurries back to the counter and ignores Molly’s inquiries about his hand. Sherlock quickly finishes up John’s tea, and then pulls out the fresh chocolate cake as a present for John’s quick action.
He whimpers and is answered with another hard punch, this time against his eyebrow. He can feel blood slowly running down his cheek.
The first day of school arrives with a handful of nervous students and even more nervous teachers.
It’s a wonderful evening with this chaotic family, indeed. Always surprising, sometimes infuriating, never easy. As long as Sherlock is by his side, John can do everything, and if Sherlock happens to be the Prince of Wales, well. Nobody is perfect.
The man was done with his shirt and he caressed his waist. His now uncovered hands were ice-cold.
Sherlock managed a nod and Johns hand moved to his entrance while his other hand rubbed his stomach soothingly. It hurt for a few seconds, but then that thing was finally out of him. Some blood was rolling down his thigh. John starred for a few seconds at the plug, then he threw it away. They both could hearfeets running down the corridor outside of the room, and John hastily redressed him. When Lestrade and two other sergeants finally entered the room, they found them both huddled together with John trying to raise every trace the man had left on Sherlocks body.
Gladstone knows he is not allowed in there, because he does not like being washed in the bathtub and always tries to scratch whoever holds him, so he runs of to their bedroom and jumps on the covers. Sherlock does not mind sharing their bed with Gladstone, and the dog hopes he can make up for his mistake earlier.
Sherlock crumbles the letter and drowns it in his orange juice. His barn owl Athena happily takes a sip from it, then flies off again.
John says back. Sherlock can hear the King giggle. This must be amusing to him.
“I did not expect the rules to be so tough here.
John approaches them and hands a bowl of biscuits out to the two. Molly happily takes one, but Sherlock shakes his head. John helps Sherlock fluff out his many pillows. It helps to relax his aching back.
Sherlock gasps.
John catches the wandering hand before it reaches his trousers.

Except Sherlock feels himself slipping closer to the edge that separates his sanity with the looming insanity in the back of his mind palace.

John says reassuringly, “But did anything happened afterwards? I only remember Mary tugging me into bed, and you were gone.

They stayed like that for a long while, just enjoying each other's presence and trying to calm themselves down.
The assistant gently takes one of them in her arms and gives them over to John. It’s an Irish Settler, like Redbeard was, he has similar red fur and dark brown eyes, and his face is just as gentle. John lets the small puppy climb onto his lap. His paws play with his woollen jumper, and John carefully starts to stroke his deep fur. The puppy yelps excited, which makes John giggle.
Dozens of people were gathered in the Great Hall around the four long tables. Sherlock wondered why all of them were staring down, whispering together. A few noticed him approaching and took a few steps aside. Sherlock stepped through.
At half past one, he is suddenly fully awake, with an unbearable need for a hunt and a hunger for human flesh.

“Do you have any ideas?
“Come on,
Sherlock Holmes, his best friend and love of his life, is a beautiful and temperamental merman. They spent most of their days together, swimming in the summer side by side, resting on a couple of large rocks in the sea, and in the colder months John joins him with his boat. Sherlock showed him seals, delicious clams (Sherlock himself is, as all mermen are, vegetarian) and even one time a whale. John has shown him his smartphone (getting Sherlock dry enough to touch it is a hassle), his dog, Redbeard (who Sherlock adored), and the internet. John had taught Sherlock how to read and write, and later the merman had helped him study for his A-Levels, and the merman was soon better at every lesson than John, with only one exception.
Sherlock hears the annoying beeping of the automate, and thanks her again. “Yes I am, he should be waiting for me here.
John asks.
“Unfortunately he is quite a mouthful, very unpredictable and likely to run away, so you have to train him. However, there is nothing a bit of training and chains won’t fix!
“Do it again!
Later, Sherlock will beat himself up for his grand stupidity that he did not notice the foreign smell editing from his hidden cupboard sooner when he gets the wolfsbane potion out.
“I will kill her.” John announced and tries to get up, but Sherlock drags him back down.
John has made it his life’s mission to prove Sherlock sometimes wrong about him. He never actually spoke that out loud, but it’s a thing nonetheless. He had a few big wins these past months. First, teaming up with Mycroft without telling Sherlock to get rid of Mary, then kissing him during The Great British Bake-Off and now that John likes his job at the clinic.
, who answers enthusiastically. He buries his hands in her hair and the two nearly fall over the table. Sherlock hears Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Hudson engage in romantic actions too, and he decides not to look too closely.
“I told you, I was bored.
John said in his honey-like voice.
In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,
Sherlock replies cheekily.
“John. John. John.”
John takes a break. Gladstone licks Sherlock‘s cheek.
Except, it is not, because John can hear Mycroft’s helicopter and Sherlock is gasping breathlessly on the bed. And Britain’s most powerful media mogul is dead at his feet.
"Go away.“ He muffled, hoping to sound strong, but his voice was way too weak to achieve that.

Yes, John could be a friend. Sherlock has already more friends than he ever expected. He did not get along with about ninety percent of his school peers. He said too many deductions out loud, and he stopped too late. The next seven years, Sherlock was shoved down the stairs, kicked under the table, his pens were stolen, his books were ripped apart, and every
The snow is laying thick on the ground and on the tree branches, the sun has disappeared a while ago, but the stars and the moon shine enough light on the white snow. The view is magical, but Sherlock and John only have eyes for each other.

A year later, he met Mary, a fellow nurse, funny and smart and kind, and John figured that this was his best and possibly last chance to find happiness. If he could not have Sherlock and crime-solving and Baker Street, then Mary and a job at a local clinic and house in the suburbs had to be enough.
He shot that bloody bastard and with the help from

Sherlock nods. John continues with his plans.
Sherlock is laying curled on the bed, hiding his head in his arms. He is still wearing his shirt, his trousers and socks, his shoes are peaking out from under the bed. John doesn’t spies his coat, scarf or mobile. They must have been lost in the explosion.
“Us. Together, for the rest of our lives.
“I told you to choose dry bones. He is perfect for you.”
Sherlock prepared himself to throw a fit like only a real teenager could: “If you would ever listen to me, you’d know that I absolutely hate pineapple on my pizza!
With that, John presses a teddy bear into Sherlock’s small hands.
“That is a very unusual name.
“John. John, please. I am so, so sorry. I will always be sorry, for the rest of my life.
“It’s not any mirror, it’s the Mirror of

“No thank you.

Kissing Sherlock would be an activity John wanted to perform for the rest of his life. Their relationship wouldn’t be as restricted as
“So, how come you can see the

“Shame, really. Must have been a perfect hiding place, for you know…
Sherlock asks softly, and John doesn’t pretend to try to control his emotions. He gulps, and looks at the kissing Sherlock in the Mirror and the gangly teenager who is right next to him.
“What is your name?
Gregory’s wife asked. He shook his head. “Unfortunately not, he claimed the counting-office is too busy and Old Marley needs his assistance.
“I have to go, sweetheart. My seminar starts at 8 o’clock tomorrow.”
Sherlock is exhausted from these few seconds and sacks back against John, who wraps his arms around him. John tries to understand what apparently happened (MAGIC?!), but also knows that Sherlock is too tired for a drawn-out explanation.
“Oh, definitely.
His mother would die two months later, and the police would rule it as a suicide. John himself was not so sure. Their father disappeared with a small pension and John hopes he drank himself to death.
“Fine.” Mycroft agreed. John coaxed Sherlock out of his well-deserved slumber, and the three men made their way to the waiting car. Lestrade waves them goodbye, and John promises to call him as soon as they settled back in 221b Baker Street.

“I am sorry.” He whispers, his voice filled with shame.

“Next time, we will take the bus.

“If you don’t mind me asking, but how did it happen?
Staring at the mysterious door a little longer, he came to his senses. This was probably just a very small room, with maybe the power box and the pipes in it. There was no door lock either, just a latch. John opened the door and stepped into the room, which was as expected tiny so tiny that a grown man could not stretch his legs, and also smelled horrible.
, Flitwick?
Now, it’s time for their sixth Christmas, and John is determined to finally make it a good one, for both of them. A lot has happened in the last 12 months. The baby is now safe at David’s, and they both are very happy with the arrangement. David had sent John a photo of them in July. John had moved back to Baker Street, and soon into Sherlock’s bedroom as well.
She ordered multiple fake bumps of different sizes over her colleagues amazon account and let it send to their office on John’s off day. That worked out rather well, especially because John spent the majority of her ‚pregnancy‘ at Baker Street, caring for a whining Sherlock. That detective was getting on her last nerves. She should have just shot him in the head and be done with it, but then John would have gone immediately after her and shot the murderer of his precious friend on sight. That was not an option.
John introduces the two newcomers.
and John had worked out the plan while Sherlock was in recovery. John was supposed to stay with Mary until the baby could be given to David, and
"Thank god for that.“

went off to do his so-called essential government work, and he would start studying for his a-levels. He planned to concentrate on chemistry and biology, and it would mean a lot of work. The anticipated stress coupled with the pleading eyes of his mother brought him to this hotel room, where he had to share a room with his seventh years older brother.
, his brother drawled and let his eyes roam all over Sherlock. His mouth formed a surprised
The auction drowns on, and Sherlock wishes he could hide his face in his hands, but they tied him up like a bad dog and told him they would light his fresh collar around his neck on fire if he tries to run away or talks. Sherlock is all alone, and no one cares in the whole world.
"Choose yourself."
“Someone messed up my potion, weakened it. I fought to stay human for hours, until the wolf smelled two students close by.
Sherlock shakes his head, hoping for a romantic love confession.
“That took rather long for a simple payment action.
“You will be visited by three ghosts.
John jokes, noticing Sherlock’s discomfort. Sherlock chokes on his hot cup of tea, and John claps his back until he stops coughing.
Greg and Molly were hushing together right now, it looked suspicious for John. Tom seemed to think the same, he kept throwing angry glances at the two of them. John hoped Molly would not choose today to blow the engagement off, Mary wouldn’t want a distracting drama on her wedding day.
John pushes the first finger into Sherlock. It burns, but they wait a few seconds until the feeling subsides. John moves the finger around, and soon, the second finger joins in. Sherlock moans into the pillow. The stinging is nearly unbearable for a second.
A girl giggles, only about 50 meters away from him. “Do not go without me!

Sherlock handed him the money he got from his mom. The boy’s eyes stayed for a second on his arse, his face was unreadable.
John slowly shakes his head: “I thought it was all a dream.

„Children, we have a new guest in our house! This is John, and I want you all to welcome him!“
“I know!
The next three hours were such a flurry of activity that John hardly bothered to keep up. He and Sherlock moved back to Lestrade’s sofa and Sherlock received an IV for hydration and finally some proper painkillers. Mycroft walked around, giving orders, observing public cameras from his laptop and somehow, that bastard still managed to gloat at them. John watched the sun go down slowly. It had been a long day.
comments dryly as she rushes away, holding a glass of red wine in her hand.

"Okay. I will be here."

he whispered, and John could detect a sense of fear.
“Beautiful.” John mumbles before their lips crash together, and Sherlock forgets everything and everyone around him.
John explains, then discovers Sherlock’s predicament and hurriedly presses his quivering head against his chest.
“I just asked the right questions to Mrs. Hudson.

John growls. Sherlock’s hands find his trouser zip and finally, John is finally completely naked as Sherlock is.

The noise was probably coming from the pipes, and although Mary had reassured him that it was probably nothing, he still wanted to check, just to be sure. It wouldn’t be good to wake up someday with burst pipes and a flooded house.
Sherlock sits on the bed and kicks his feet away. John advances and careful lifts the veil away, so they can look at each other properly.
Sherlock looks up to check for John’s reaction. The teacher however does not study the footstep, but instead stares at Sherlock.
John was now more surprised than before. Such an educated slave must have been born in a very noble family. Maybe they wanted to get rid of him and sold him, or his family was called in a siege. The young slave looked absolutely terrified after the dark haired man's suggestion. He tried to wriggle out of his tight bounds again, and the seller slapped him in the face.
John bites back, his face purple with anger. Smith steps back a bit, although he tries to make it look natural.
Sherlock teases her.
The detective was even more pale than usual, his face gaunt and cheeks hollow, lips bloodless. Someone had shaved his unruly curls to a short, prison-like hairstyle. There was a yellow bruise under his cheekbone and a deep cut on his upper lip. Both eyes were sluggishly held open by pure will, rolling around the room until finally stopping on John. Sherlock always looked at the doctor like he was the only person in the room, the only important noteworthy person on this planet, and today was no different.
“Is this alright?” John asks quietly, his lips directly next to Sherlock’s ear.
What they didn’t say: “Stonehenge is a few stones stapled on top of each other. It’s going to be cold, rainy and dark. You will share a room with your brother. We are sleeping just one door away.
A few calls confirmed his terrible suspicion. He drove to
, the one with Colin Firth and the infamous lake scene.
Every thought dissolved into garbled mess, burning mess and an unstoppable hunger for air.
Lestrade never thought he would see that the day that he wished that Sherlock Holmes would be a bit more selfish and less considerate. The detective clearly loved John Watson, everyone, and he means everyone, could see it. Apart from the clueless doctor of course. Sherlock always looked at him with so much adoration in his eyes, he laughed so openly with him, his body language relaxed, his hands calm. Sherlock Holmes was hopelessly in love, had been for years, but the man was married. John would never go back to him anyway, now that his wife was expecting the baby. The whole thing was a complete mess, and Lestrade had no idea how to fix it.
emits something close to a whinny.
’s obvious dismay. John Watson happily blew out the candle and stood there hopefully.
No one answers either.
At least he now had enough to buy a present for Mrs. Hudson, probably a good whiskey.
Mary takes a few steps closer and is now in Sherlock’s private place. Sherlock resists the urge to push her away.
"John… Have you really thought about this?“
with his parents. Maybe he could try getting internet connection again.
John looked confused for a second, then regained the posture of the soldier.
The picture of a sweating but glowing John running towards him with open arms comes to Sherlock’s mind. Delicious.
It was like an explosion. Sherlock tasted so sweet, a bit of the wine, but also like adventure, a promise of a far away land John had never set foot into. John sucked Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth. The brunette gasped and arched, and the gladiator could feel the gained pleasure pooling directly to his groin. John pressed the younger man’s body deeper into the mattress and laid himself on top of him. Sherlock groaned, if in pain or pleasure, John wasn’t sure.
“It’s just not that easy, Paddington.
and probably fingered his hole.
“Oh, no.
Only one hour beforehand, the first year students had set off on their boat ride over the Great Lake. It has been a long tradition for the school and is beloved by the first years. They would have seen Hogwarts for the first time, and Sherlock still remembers exactly how enchanting that felt for him; he experiences this feeling every time he walks up to the castle. Only now, he sits on the other side of the Great Hall, at the long teacher’s table under the ever-changing sky of the Great Hall.
You could read something.
, Irene and Molly? They must be worried sick about you. We have to tell them!
Sherlock shakes his head again.
Sherlock muffles into John’s mouth. John’s tries to lift himself into a more dignified position, with his lips still pressed on Sherlock’s. John scrambles with his weak legs, while Sherlock has to figure out fast what to do with his hands or lips or is he supposed to use his tongue and oh dear, they both must smell of whiskey, and why did no one ever taught him kissing?
Sherlock nods: “Thank you, you already have quick reflexes for a medical student.
Sherlock says and sprints down the stairs.
Sherlock remembers the first time he rode on a broom, with John calling out to him from the sky.
It all comes crashing down on Monday, when John falls down on his seat next Sherlock at the breakfast table. The former healer appears to have got over the spectacular hangover better than Sherlock did. He bites enthusiastically into a piece of toast.
John returned to the bathroom. Sherlock was stirring now quite a bit and mumbling to himself. The doctor undressed him (and he forced himself not to let his eyes wander too much). The ghastly socks made a weird sound when he dropped them to the floor, and something fell out. Something familiar.
Sherlock blinked again. It was a bit of a deja-vu day.
Sherlock says and winks.
“Yes, we talked a bit. He suggested starting an amateur
“Sure!
John has found a lot of dangerous, weird, and most of all disgusting things in their kitchen at 221b, but this is the first time he opened their cupboards and sees only gingerbread. Lots, lots, lots of gingerbread.
Who is missing?
John blinks, then his eyebrows furrow: “What the hell were you thinking?!
Your room.
“Since when do you care about breaking the rules?
Of course Sherlock would notice John’s dark mood immediately. John sighs and sits down on the sand. Sherlock doesn’t wait for permission and just crawls in his lap, his long fishtail hanging over John’s knees. The merman’s face is pressed against John’s shoulder. He can survive outside the water for approximately seven minutes before the air is becoming a problem. Usually, John just carries him into deeper water until then, so Sherlock can easily scoop his head underwater every few seconds. John uses the salt to float, and Sherlock entangles his long body with him. There are no more positions they haven’t tried out so far.
Warnings: Minor Character Death.
John hold his breath for a moment. He wished he could turn around to Sherlock, see his reaction. His hands were sweaty in Mary’s. She let out a small awkward giggle, and some guests joined in. No one ever expected someone actually objecting.
“I’m going to keep you company for your last hours. I’m Santa Claus, and I’m bringing the presents on Christmas Day.
said the ghost.
He would do it tonight. He would allow John to take his virginity, before John made the decision for him. John was well-built, a beautiful man. Sherlock had to believe he would not hurt him.
Sherlock says into John’s ear while his boyfriend is clearly adamant to carry Sherlock around for the rest of the evening.
“Maybe someday, but until then I’m gonna carry you through the snow masses. Like they do with the Hobbits!
“Humph…
"No, I won’t.“ John claimed resolutely and stopped next to Sherlock’s bed. He didn’t wait for any invitation, just untied his shoes and shed his Gryffindor robe, before climbing into bed. Sherlock tried to roll away, but strong arms curled around his waist, and he found himself pressed against John’s warm body.
Yes, he had done that. He came back from two years away and this woman had mended John Watson together. She made him smile and he loved her. So how could he hate her or try to take John away from her? Loving John was so easy and being loved by him in return was the greatest gift he could imagine. Sherlock truly believed that Mary had loved (loves) John, because how could she not? But her love was not good. John had called it a selfish form of love and Sherlock agreed with him.
Sherlock says. He never had a friend, and he desperately wants one.
Sherlock had been eating gingerbread for nearly eighty hours now. So far, there had been no obvious complications, although he is starting to look a little green everytime he bits into another piece. At least there is enough room in the kitchen now, so John can make pasta. Sherlock leaves the flat whenever John starts cooking, and John guesses it’s because of the delicious smell.
Sherlock says, playing with his wet coat.
In the meantime John had raised the upper part of the bed and carefully wrestled the white hospital gown over Sherlock’s thin shoulders. Lestrade caught a glimpse of more large bruises on his arms and chest, and even more worrying, two burns over his ribs. Christ, what have those monsters done to him?
) who did it
“I can take over the jogging until your leg is healed.
John spread one of his blankets over them both and blew the candle out. Sherlock was still lying curled together on the far side of the bed, facing the wall. John decided to spare him from any more unwanted touches today and closed his eyes. 'I hope he won’t try to throttle me in my sleep', was his last thought, before his eyes fell closed.
, his landlady.
(4) How long had she planned to imprison Sherlock, and what exactly did she plan to do with him?
"I broke up with Mary when I finally noticed what nasty character lies behind her smiling persona. I also ended our relationship because I stopped being a coward and understood what I really wanted all along.“ He plays with one of Sherlock’s soft curls. „It’s you, it’s always you, and no Sarah, Janette, Kara, Lina or Mary could ever compete with you.“
He loved Mary. Not as much as Sherlock, never that, never the burning, all consuming, endless love, but still. It should be enough, it must be enough.

This is how John finds himself, on the 18th of December, on the grand family room in the Buckingham Palace, holding the hand of the third heir to the throne of England.
His bedroom door had a large knocker, and
Lestrade walked into the room without either of the two noticing him. He walks around the bed to finally greet the detective.
“Likewise.
The cellar door flew open with a loud bang and
"Sounds lonely, and exhausting."
Anderson hated the fact he hadn't seen it, when he KNEW what to look for, the coverup, the denial, the defense of their own abusers... Anderson felt sick. He wanted to punch John, throttle him, make him feel what it was like to be helpless before someone else, not in defense of Sherlock, but because John had fooled him. Anderson had trusted him, liked him, and now... now he wanted to shoot him with the man's own gun.
Traditional hard cider or wine Wassail with apple, orange, and spices.
John was ushered up to the east wing of the third story, where he had a suite of four rooms all to himself that included a bedroom with a huge wardrobe already filled with clothes in his size and style, though a few were more formal. There was a sitting room with soft squashy couches, armchairs, and a plasma screen TV, an office with a hand carved antique mahogany desk and bookcases, and a bathroom with a garden tub that seemed large enough to comfortably fit four people in it if they were rather fond of each other. There was a double sided wood burning fireplace that serviced both the bedroom and the sitting room, and the sitting room even had a real dumbwaiter that went straight to the kitchens. He started thinking about hidden rooms and secret passageways and all of the mysteries a young Sherlock would have investigated in a house this old and large. His windows overlooked a series of gardens, and off in the distance a ways he could even see a hedge maze garden with a tower folly in the middle of it. He could just imagine Sherlock dressed as a pirate and using the folly as his ship, or the island where he had hidden his treasure. He would have to explore it himself when he got the chance.

Jim's smile was all teeth as he sat back and poured himself another cup of tea. “So Sebby, what do we know about the restaurant business?”
But Anderson wasn't afraid of Sherlock, not at all. "Your plasters came off with the mask, but it's too sore for you to notice them gone right? So what's the story, you tripped by the table, slipped in the shower and hit the soap dish, walked into a door, turned into the corner of an open cupboard? My mum had a mark just like that once from the edge of a ceramic vase, after my father hit her in the face with it. She told people it was the car door when she had bent down to fetch her dropped keys. So what's your excuse? I'm dying to know."
cleaned him up so thoroughly. He cuddled up behind Sherlock, letting the taller man be the little spoon, and just let Sherlock bask in the feeling of being held and cared for.
There was small talk and reminisces of the good old med school days before they realized they didn't know everything. They talked shop, and about relationships, Mark had been divorced for five years, and had apparently been dating this spitfire of a redhead named Natalie for the last eighteen months who loved nothing more than showing him off like he was the prize stallion in the stable, even though she was fourteen years younger than him and a classy executive that made her minions cower in fearful respect everyday. She was currently in Germany on business.
Amanda Addlesby was the lynchpin like Sherlock had thought. She had been the girl who had rejected Devin, and was supposed to be away in Italy for a month, which is why she hadn’t been reported missing. Devin had two enforcers that he had significant amounts of blackmail on to make them do the kidnappings for him. He had blindfolded everyone with silk blindfolds so they didn’t even see each other until they were so weak or out of their minds with drugs that they had just torn into each other instead of joining together and overpowering their captors. He had also prevented the escape of his victims by binding them with long swaths of fabric that hung from the ceiling, similar to aerial silks that were grommeted and held together with locks. The fabric covered such wide areas of the victims, that not only did it keep them immobile, but it also didn’t leave noticeable binding marks anywhere. With the final person on his original list finally in his grasp, Devin killed all of his tormentors one final time with her at the center of it, the catalyst for what he believed was where his life had gone wrong.
"That's right." Mycroft nodded to Steve who still stood behind John, and grabbed his hair, forced his head back and pressed a vicious looking Bowie knife under his chin. Dead serious, steady, a trickle of blood trailing down his neck from the razor-sharp edge. Yep he was fucked.
It was special forces they sent in after him though, and thank goodness for that. Because once the police had Devin cornered, he had sprayed hydrochloric acid at the officers from a large air pressurized ‘super soaker’ style water gun, which had burned several officers severely. As they were dealing with that he had then thrown down several dozen water balloons which were filled with either bleach or ammonia, forming deadly chloramine gas as they broke and combined with each other. That allowed him time to give himself a huge overdose cocktail of insulin and morphine before they could reach him and bring him into custody. Several officers were still in hospital with severe acid burns and toxic gas inhalation, one was blinded for life. Lestrade and his team were thankfully not involved.
“As is the safety of your customers, and this glass will not only not break over their heads, but will also reduce your insurance premiums for having it. It's free of charge, honestly, why are you protesting this so much?”
"Wonderful." He turned to the one he had ordered to do the picc line. "I also want you to get a pint from her and get it here as fast as you can." He turned to the other woman in the group.
“Sherlock-”

"Excellent. How many men do you have at the moment?"
Two blinks.
Sebastian and John got on like two peas in a pod, both former military, Royal Marines at that, both doctors, but Sebastian had been a black ops sniper whereas he'd been a combat surgeon and commando. They still never ran out of things to talk about, there was that camaraderie that came with having a similar background, understanding where someone was coming from, and the things they had seen. Jim always smiled when the two of them got to talking, he was a small, very wealthy looking business man with an Irish burr to his tone and a fondness for very expensive bespoke suits, but he was always polite and very generous with his smile. He and Sebastian seemed to be lovers, though John couldn't say for sure, they got on well and Jim was always talking about business dealings they had going on all around the world, China and France, Hungary, Switzerland, Columbia, Russia, the Cayman Islands, The Americas, Greece, always waiting for deliveries to arrive, or people to call in, or another client requesting a special order. He wondered if Jim owned a shipping business of some kind, whatever he did, it paid well. Jim was a charming sort of fellow who always smiled like he had a secret. It had always been slightly off putting, like it was with most career business men because it was hard to tell when the smiles or sentiments were real and when it was just a show in order to get you to sign your soul away without knowing it. Something in his gut told him Jim could be very dangerous if he ever decided to be, but his smiles towards John were always genuine and they reached his eyes. For some reason that always assured John that he was safe enough, Jim liked him, and therefore he had nothing to worry about.
“Sure. Greg probably prefers me to do the paperwork, seeing as I am a lot more patient with him than you are,” he teased and Sherlock rolled his eyes in mock drama. Almost as an afterthought John said:
Just as he pulls all his wits together, heaving in a large breath and gearing up for what he cannot circumvent, John nervously licks his lips beside him and clears his throat.
“I am starving, let’s go have dinner.”
John shook his head.
__________________
John pursed his lips.
The blood rushing through him fills his ears with white noise when he leads John out of the kitchen and through the dark hallway to his own bedroom. He doesn’t bother to switch on a light. John keeps silent and closes the door behind them, still holding his hand, before they get into bed together and under the cool sheets. It is approaching 1:30am and after days without sleep and scarce nutrition Sherlock’s movements are quite wooden. There is still so much to say, so much to ask and so many possibilities as to how to proceed now. Not to mention the prevailing  case and its serious setback. But right now Sherlock is just so unbelievably tired. Turning around to face John he sees him stretch under the covers and stifle a yawn behind the back of his hand. Their eyes meet when Sherlock’s head hits the pillow and for a moment both of them are waiting, poised as if for more but unsure about what that could be.
and when Sherlock awoke he’d felt lonely and confused.
“Lie back, Sherlock, I want to touch you.”
.” John stares at him before a moment later something shifts in his face again and he smiles a fond smile, completely and utterly throwing Sherlock for a loop.
“John— I realize I want us to be something else,” he finally says, “Something
God, he really hates cases where everything goes wrong and nothing leads to any kind of solution. To save his honour: It doesn’t happen very often. But when it does it absolutely irks him and usually leaves him moody and stroppy for days.
“How does it feel to be ordinary for once?” John teases him lightly. He shifts a bit, his bum at the counter now, his stance relaxed, with ankles and arms crossed loosely.
John nods and pads the small of his own back protectively. “Cabbies seem to be quite bad a bunch. Where are we going?” He looks up expectantly, eyes impossibly blue and ablaze with light.
Suddenly Sherlock has to grab him again and sling his arms around his shoulders. He takes one urgent step forwards, walks into John and crowds him backwards into the wall where his gun makes a dull thudding sound on the wooden door frame of the loo. “When exactly did you know?” he asks in a low whisper, voice urgent and feels John shiver. “I need to know, John. Tell me.”
Lestrade only cocks one eyebrow, unfazed and patient in the face of rudeness. Sherlock eyes him over the manila folder in his hands and thinks about the distraction this current case could have offered him. He’s missed John so much last night it had truly frightened him. His mind palace is in chaos. But if he’s honest, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that, always having been prone to carry things to extremes and then spectacularly losing himself, the feelings his heart holds for John prove to be very intense and over-whelming in their manifestation. He’d grabbed his violin to calm down and enable logic thinking again but in the end he didn’t play a single note.
“Have you ever… Don’t get me wrong…” John breathes, floundering for words, his face flushed now and Sherlock wonders if John has planned what to say in advance and his stammer is just a belated nervous reaction that has him tongue-tied now that they have so obviously moved beyond glances. “You have done this before—”
is just
“Oh, yes. Change of plans,” Sherlock answers merrily and while he unwinds his scarf to throw it onto a lab chair, he notices John and Molly locking eyes. John has stepped behind him to remove his jacket, his back turned so Sherlock cannot see his face and Molly is frantically gesturing at him, her face a bit flushed and mouth taut. Sherlock frowns. Since when have these two become conspiratorial?
Though he turned to address Lestrade Sherlock cannot ask his question because, again out of the corner of his eyes, he notices John’s blue eyes on him and again it feels like Sherlock has caught him doing something utterly private. Even though they are in public.
“Tell me it’s not flowers, your present”, Sherlock rasps, leaning forward and tightening his arms around John’s stalwart form. John’s answering laughter is deliciously ragged and breathless.
“John, I really…”
John gives him a present. Not to mention
John sighed again.
John shook his head, trying to clear it and passing the pictures off as an aftermath to the earlier conversation in their sitting room. There was no time now for idle daydreaming, or for pondering potentialities.
He shakes his head slightly in confusion, mouth parched. “You don’t want to— “ He cannot find it in him to state the somewhat painful obvious and the unsaid words hang like weights between them, while moments drag by and Sherlock feels the increasing need to just jump out of bed an tear off but John only tightens his grip on him to hold him there. He looks at Sherlock for a moment before he leans in and chastely kisses the bow above Sherlock’s top lip. His breathing is a bit ragged, his hand on Sherlock's waist rigid. “Believe me I do. Very much so. I am not messing with you on this. It is way too important.”
“Isn’t that what people need when they had want to relax in the morning after a stressful night?”
Mutely, he leans forwards to claims John’s mouth again but then just bashfully pecks his lips, twice, and hopes that’s enough of an answer. John’s eyes follow his mouth as he straightens himself and as they lift upwards to once again lock into his, Sherlock thinks that, the last time he’s looked into a lover’s eyes, he has looked into darkness. Now, however, as he looks into John’s where they are standing together among the dark patches of lawn at Regent’s Park, with the street lamps so far away it feels as if the world has sunken into an eternal night, the only thing he sees is light.
It is 2am in the morning and Sherlock lies in bed. Sleep is eluding him and his mind is positively reeling with pondering possible solutions to the mystery of whatever it was that has happened between John and him in the sitting room earlier tonight.
Mrs. Hudson interrupts by tuting at him. “Oh, look at you being all peeved because no one has given you flowers,” she says with a teasing smile. “I’ll talk to John, he’s supposed to do the job.” She frowns at him. “Really Sherlock, since he’s making you live in sin with him, he should at least buy you flowers to lift up your mood today.”
Sherlock had always lived according to his own rules and nothing else…
It is a really messed up case. He loses the young woman’s trace after she’s left the cab that had taken her and her boyfriend from the club to the banks of the Thames and has to restart. It’s heavily frustrating but then he is able to get a hold of a member of his homeless network who has seen a man and a woman getting abducted in the surrounding to where Sherlock thinks they got out of the cab the night they vanished. It solidifies his theory. The Pakistani cabbie, to his annoyance, had been an utter disappointment on that matter but the imbecile are always hard to rely on.
“Come here, Sherlock.”
It’s desire.
John smiles, a secret kiss tucked into the corner of his mouth and Sherlock thinks how well that goes with the twinkle in his eyes. John, oblivious, lowers his hands and dabs at the toast crumbs.
“Did he send you here to torment me, the meddling busybody?” He turns on Lestrade. “I will not work for Mycroft. Brexit is
They’d tumbled onto the sofa at some point in an uncoordinated heap of limps and there was nothing in John’s life comparable to the sensation of lying on top of each other while kissing. The way Sherlock had looked up at him, his eyes shy and innocent and at the same time so full of want and lust. How he had pulled John down for another kiss, his hands warm now, his lips pliant, his chest heaving against John's, could only be described as utterly overwhelming. Sherlock had always possessed a certain strange and virile beauty, but John had never felt so drawn to it before.
“The two drug dealers Scotland Yard let escape were just seen driving to a storehouse in London Harbor. I'll get dressed."
The display in front of them is gruesome, probably one of the worst things Sherlock has ever seen in his life. He doesn’t know about John, though, who must have come across similar wounds and mutilated bodies in Afghanistan. They catch their respective eyes and look at each other for a moment before Sherlock inches closer. His clothes are thoroughly damp and dirty, his hands clammy and raw but he doesn’t pay it any attention as he beckons John to bring his torch a bit closer.
“When will be the time for explanations, Sherlock? This is madness! Will you talk to me?”
“You said it was something I needed, John. What is it? And why would you…” Sherlock trails off and gestures to John with his free hand. If he can coax John into revealing what exactly the present entails, then it would be another clue. But John only huffs another laugh.
The man replied by clenching his eyes shut tightly.
"Do you know how you were compromised?"
"It would be very hard not to like John," Lestrade agreed "he's sincere, kind, and has a soothing presence, makes you feel like nothing can hurt you while he's around, though I don't know why that is."
"No Sherlock, I was never kidnapped, he comes in here about six days a week on average, at 7 sharp, even if it's just a takeaway order. He's always been very polite, but I had no idea you were related, in fact he's never even mentioned you. The most personal thing he's ever said about himself was that he's a clerk to the minister's undersecretary. Until you said his name I wouldn't have connected it otherwise, 'Holmes' is a rather common last name after all."
"Alright. That's more than enough to go on. Agent Fletcher, I want to let you know that you have done us all proud. You protected the information. They never found the chip, and nothing you may have said under torture will aid them in any way. Agent Langley is already in place with a task force to take them into custody. They won't get away with it. If you want to watch or even give the order yourself I will arrange it personally. I don't abandon my agents, especially ones who have gone so far beyond what was asked and who have endured so much for Queen and country. If you want to take an early retirement you will be set for life, if you recover to the point you want to stay on you will have your choice of positions and still be set for life when you retire. You are also still on the clock even now, and your current orders are to heal. Rest, I will keep you updated."
“I live with Sherlock, tactless is what I'm used to.”
"Yes, shirts and trousers, aren't you listening? Many signs add up but others are off, and there's also a slight tang of fruit in the air don't you smell it? They must have been given a cocktail, it's the only possible explanation, and if it wasn't given intravenously or orally that leaves subcutaneous or muscular injections. Look for needle marks." He lifted up the first shirt and saw exactly what he expected to see. "John, if someone came to you complaining of desperate thirst, constant hunger, abdominal cramps, nausea, and dizziness, what would be your initial diagnosis before running any tests?"
"Yes, I purchase boxes of lost mobiles from Heathrow in bulk every month, wipe the memory clean, and also have a deal with an electronics recycling company for the chargers. I then give them and a phone card out to my network. They take out the sim cards when they aren't in use, in case they get stolen, but also so they can sell the phones if they have to, it's not like I can't get them another one, I have two full boxes at home."
He had to stop at that point, the idea became too much.
John called him lovely and that he adored him. Sherlock hugs his blanket to his chest and commits every single moment of the evening to a special room in his mind-palace. Nobody had ever said something like this to Sherlock, and Sherlock never expected it, even if he lived longer than Nicholas
He stops in the middle of his sentence.
A security woman quickly checks John’s bag (thankfully John did not bring his gun or else they would have had a problem right now) and they are in.
When John walked down the aisle, he felt dozens of eyes on him. This wouldn’t bother him so much, if he hadn’t heard about the audience number the BBC alone expected. Probably half of the country was watching him now, in the dark blue suit he was wearing. Millions of people would see if he tripped over his feet. They would laugh at him and make reaction
, so he only has his suit jacket and his thin white shirt. His arms are stretched above his head and tied with a chain to something at the wall, Sherlock can’t see it. His ankles are tied together with cuffs too, which forces him into a sitting position which is going to hurt soon. The manacles have already chuffed at his wrists, and the uncomfortable and worsening pain in his shoulders remind him so much of Serbia that this alone can throw him into a full-blown panic attack. Unfortunately, he has no time for that, because Santa Claus has sitting down in front of him, and the smell out of his mouth reminds Sherlock that he hasn’t eaten or drunk anything in hours. The lack of food may not be that bad, but the missing water may soon prove to be a problem. Especially coupled with the painful hit to his head.

“Yeah, sure.

His best friend from his childhood, Bill Murray, has noticed his constant moping and dragged him to a Christmas party. It’s unbearably cold, and the couple of small fires they built on the stones doesn’t help. The students have split into several small groups, with John’s group closest to the river.
John is his own person.
Sherlock whispers. They spent another few minutes in the cooling bathtub, then get out and dry themselves.

Sherlock exclaims.
It’s amazing how much pain a human being can survive without breaking down. The human body was amazing, the human brain was even more amazing, and all these amazing things put together, adding jumpers, blond hair with a grey hairline, a hidden gun, warm blue eyes and an open smile, that could transform into a deadly gaze in an instant, adding all these amazing parts together, combined, was John Watson.

Thank you.
John says a word, and Sherlock hopes it isn’t something negative
She spread her arms and indicated their whole kitchen. Their was next to no decorations, and their fridge was always empty.
John couldn’t believe that he was really going to be the first — and possibly only! — to touch this man.
“God damn it.” Lestrade cursed, and wanted to take his badge out, but did not find it. “Where is my badge anyway?”
“Mycroft will pay for attacking our citizen.
He wanted Sherlock, and he just spectacularly made all of that known. He needed to salvage what was left.
“I don’t want to miss a moment of this.
Sherlock sprints down the hill, but a spell of dizziness hits him and his knees give in. He falls down hard on his hands, a surge of sudden pain radiating through his wrist. Sherlock rolls a few more meters before he can stop himself.
He pulls the blanket closer to his chest. He and John are going to kiss in eight minutes!

The worst thing is, is that John clearly figured out that something is wrong. He constantly knocks on Sherlock’s door, and Sherlock has taken to using the headphones Mrs. Hudson has sent him as an early present. It serves him as a convenient excuse not to hear him, since his violin playing isn’t loud enough. John invites him for strategy meetings for their
„Are you satisfied with me?“, he asked John. The gladiator chuckled and rolled his hips a bit, so the cock in Sherlock shifted to the side. Sherlock purred.
John’s heart stopped for a second. Sherlock looked white as a sheet, his eyes rolling to left and right. He was biting his lip and seemed ready to throw up.
Till death do us apart,
“It sounds nice.
Gregory finishes his speech, and John Watson started to clap, but immediately noticed his frivolity and hastily busied himself with his paperwork again.
“It is too dark. My muscles look best in natural light. Be careful, a large fish is approaching.”
“Have you figured out why I’m murdering especially these people? Do you know why I do it?
In short, there he is. Sherlock throws the wet towel over the rack and grabs the book orders from his table. He will send his barn owl, Athena, this evening to Flourish &
She admonishes them. “I want to take my shower in peace, and John, you should have been in bed half an hour ago.
John asks. “Your parents are still on their opera visit, so the bathroom is free for us. We could take a shower.
, they said.
John muses and ruffles his hair.
John had never been more sure of anything in his life, even not when he signed up for medical school. That step felt natural to him, the same feeling when he proposed to Sherlock Holmes, second in line to the throne of England.
He spoke too early. The clock gave one last deep, dull, hollow, melancholy sound. ONE. At once all the candles came to life in the room, and the curtains were thrown open.
John says and kicks at a non-existing stone on the path. The two British wizards stand there in the forest on Halloween, not knowing what to do with their limbs.
The homeless began shuffling in, nearly all of them men, Sherlock of course observed that they were all former military because they all had a certain look to them. They got some food and hot tea or coffee, then sat down to eat, a few eyed the little door that John had gone into, as though working up the courage to go in. The tenth ones to come in was an older man carrying a much younger girl, probably about five to seven, and she was sobbing. The man looked scared to even be inside and kept looking around nervously. The staff ushered them straight into John's office, the female waitress turned assistant following close behind. The man began shouting once the door was closed, but there was no harsh reply. Lestrade was getting worried once silence fell in the office, but the female assistant emerged a few minutes later, carrying the girl in her arms wrapped in a blanket, along with a file of paperwork and talking on her cell phone rapidly as she dashed out the door to hail a cab. John came out with the man, who was the one crying this time. John set him in a chair and set the soup and coffee and bread in front of him.
! But it's hurting you and I have to destroy it, and Anderson's right, you never fight back, why don't you ever fight back?!"
Anderson couldn't stop himself, he was angry, he couldn't let this lie, this was one issue he just couldn't stand silence on, that's what let it continue unchecked. "I thought you were some sort of mixed martial arts, boxing, street scrapper. You took out five armed men on your own once, I SAW you! You could have fought back, you don't have an excuse, why the hell didn't you fight back?!"
Two blinks.
"Do you have any problems with opiate medications?"
Three blinks.
I'm no expert on bone and nerve damage, but even I can tell it will be a blessed miracle if he walks again. God only knows what else they did to him before they got down to hard torture. We could be dealing with complications from unknown drugs, infection, septicemia, starvation, and he was probably raped too. He's in the middle of receiving full body X-rays and a CT scan so we know what we are dealing with. We also put him on a two bag saline drip to combat severe dehydration and gave him an injection of morphine. It's all I knew that I could do without causing harm. We've staunched the bleeding as best we can, but he's a mess internally and I didn't want to close him up when it looked pretty obvious that he needs internal surgery. There's no way on gods green earth he escaped under his own power with these injuries, they dumped him to die or to be found, so we have to check him for tracers, as well as see if the information he was carrying is still intact.
Sherlock mellowed considerably under John's influence, and his brother no longer raged alone against the world, frustrated with things he couldn't understand, he now had a guide, an interpreter, and someone, Mycroft was infinitely grateful to learn, who had a protective streak for his youngest brother that was a mile wide that he could encourage whole heartedly. So it had been a double blow when he'd seen the first tape of Sherlock's 'abuse'. He wasn't used to misjudging a person so badly, especially someone as transparent as John. But on the second time through, he realized what exactly it was that he was seeing. And for the first time in his life, Mycroft felt torn on whose side to take. It didn't last long.
Johnathan Mitchell was a fireman judging by the varying ages, shapes, and sizes of the burn scars he'd observed on arms and neck, and Margaret Wileston he was sure had been an active duty armed police officer. He knew that type, John was that type, especially in an emergency. These people were the very definition of 'take charge', the alpha protectors, the heroes or group leaders, the ones the others would have immediately looked up to in a crisis, the ones who kept their heads in bad situations, the ones who don't care if they got hurt if they were protecting others.
“Please fix it for me Jim.”
Pie parfaits. Fresh marscapone cream custard layered with crushed graham crackers and either apple or pumpkin pie filling served in a parfait glass and topped with whipped cream and a gingerbread biscuit.
"Fuck your security, do you want me to save this man or not? Give me my bloody phone."
"Only four points. He would have fallen unconscious long before that."
“See that broken part there in the tree? There used to be a branch that hung out over the water, Sherlock climbed all the way out there once when he was little, alone, after dark, in the middle of winter of course, and the branch broke and he fell through the thin ice. He nearly died, would have if a grounds keeper hadn't been passing by and seen it and managed to pull him out. We might not have found his body until spring, that night was well below freezing and it had started snowing heavily. We would have never even known where to look once the hole froze back over, because no one had known where he'd gone. As you can imagine our mother was beside herself when he was brought back badly hurt and hypothermic, and Sherlock couldn't understand why she was upset and crying, because she wasn't the one with the broken bones.”
"John, I only need you to say one little thing for me alright? 'Please fix it for me Jim'."
