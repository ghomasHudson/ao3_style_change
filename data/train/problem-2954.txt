It had been his third week working the closing shift when he had met Benny, one of the line cooks. Usually, all the chefs left well before the bar staff, but he had stayed late to do inventory.
“Something troubling you,” Cas said more as a statement than a question. Dean looked at him taking another big drag of his cigarette, blowing the smoke away from Cas.
“Don’t start Sammy, you know High School was never for me” Dean interrupted. They had had the same argument ever since Dean had told Sammy that he was officially dropping out.  Sam, however, was not about to drop the topic and was gearing up to continue the old argument with his brother when Dean started the car, turning the music all the way up as he did so. The noise retelling the windows.
“Sam, I swear to God if you don’t drop it” Dean had slammed the cupboard shut. Sometimes he envied how little Sam remembered of their mom and
Cas passed the other homes in his middle-class neighbourhood in a blur, turning towards the edge of the town before the got to the road with all the private estates, where he had lived before his father had left. He had made a habit out of running towards the pig farm, but instead of cutting through the town centre, he’d run around it past the old Oak. It had been years since he had been up to the old tree, which is why it was weird that he now felt compelled to run up the grassy hill.
As soon as they had walked in through the doors and Ellen saw Sam she had ushered him into the kitchen so she could ice his bruised cheek. Dean, after standing awkwardly in the doorway to the kitchen watching as the blonde woman tended to his brother, slipped into the bathroom to wash up. Bobby’s warning, still fresh on his mind. If he had seen correctly there was a pie cooling on the counter for dessert, and no way was he risking being denied pie just because he had some motor oil under his fingernails.
“Or worse, she’ll come out looking for us herself.” Ash piped in picking up some of the snack wrappers shoving them into the plastic Gas-n-Sip-carrier bag.
“Don’t tell Pam, she’s awfully precious about her liquor license” Benny had come up to lean against the wooden bar next to Dean gesturing to the beer in Dean’s hand. Dean huffed a laugh “It’ll be our secret”
“Just had a long day that's all” Dean sounded too defensive even to his own ears, and he’s right. Cas put down the dishtowel and turned to face Dean, squinting.
“So, Jo, what new?” He leaned against the counter next to the blonde offering her his best come-hither look. She turned to face him with narrow eyes.
“My-” Cas frowned down at his bare legs, but Dean interrupted him before he could finish his thought.
The other boy looked up, frowning. Dean had never seen him before, maybe he was new or went to the other primary school in town. Dean smiled and waved down at the boy. “What you reading?”
He hadn’t lied when he told Cas, that Bobby had basically threatened him into taking Friday-Sunday off, which had already put him on edge, but then when he realized what the date was it had pushed him over it. The anniversary of his mom’s funeral had been a few days prior, when he had gone home, Sammy had instantly known he was upset and it hadn’t taken the brainiac long to figure out what it was and then nagged him to talk about it.
Right. His bedroom in the trailer. Sammy asleep in his own bed behind the wall in the bigger bedroom. With a sigh Dean throws the blankets to the side getting out of bed, pulling on his jeans from the day before, and pads out into the dark hallway past Sammy’s door, one of the floorboards is a bit lose and creaks under his weight, the sound loud in the night.
It was almost two hours later that they finally made it to Jo’s. They had stopped by the Gas-n-Sip to get snacks for later and when they walked through the centre of the town Charlie had spotted the new Marvel X-men comic in the window of The Comic Center and insisted they went in. “Come on! Rogue is hot!” To which Ash had rolled his eyes and Jo had just crooked an eyebrow, but they both had followed the redhead into the shop anyway.
Dean hadn’t been fully convinced, which is why he had taken the opportunity to sneak out while Mary was putting baby Sammy down for a nap. He simply had to see for himself. The Oak was just down the road from his house on the tallest hill in town and was perfect for climbing with thick, sturdy branches spreading out evenly around the trunk, but once he had climbed as high as he dared ( which was impressively high even if he said it himself) and had started to edge himself away from the trunk of the tree, the branches had swayed dangerously in the light breeze, almost making him lose his balance and fall to the ground.
As the night went on they’d split into smaller groups. Jo and Charlie were dancing if you could call it that Jo was mainly busy holding Charlie upright. Dean was sitting around the coffee table with Ash and Cas playing Egyptian Ratscrew, Cas had been unbeatable for the last two games (“it’s a game of speed, I’m assuming the alcohol is having an effect on your reflexes” Cas had said with an almost smile and a shrug. Smug bastard.) They had just dealt out the cards for another game when Ash let it slip Jo had a crush on Dean. Before he could react Jo heaved Charlie onto the couch and went to the kitchen to grab her a glass of water, making Charlie drink it. Returning back to the kitchen for one of her own.
Dean spent his morning taking apart the RV heat pump, hoping to find what was wrong with it while Sam had his face buried in a Spanish textbook. It was past noon when Dean came back in rubbing his face, he could probably fix the unit himself had he had the right parts. He took a quick shower to warm up as rain from the morning hadn’t let up before he and Sammy headed to the restaurant. It was a hole-in-the-wall type of palace, but the furbishing was cozy with mismatched furniture and picnic tablecloths on the tables.
The older boy was, for a lack of a better word, beautiful. A defined jawline, straight nose and a smile took over his whole face creating wrinkles by his eyes that would turn into crows feet once he got old.
The food was fantastic. Sammy had ordered a Shrimp Étouffée and Dean a Po’Boy Sandwich with extra fries from a dark-haired waitress, her name-tag had read ‘Pam’
The beers quickly became a regular thing, Benny, offering to do the inventory on the nights Dean was working. The beers turned into flirty touches that quickly turned into make-out sessions in the kitchen after hours and they had graduated to hand and blow jobs in the back seat of Impala a few weeks ago. It still made him feel weird to think he was in a relationship. Dean Winchester did not do relationships, so to be in one made him want to run away and curl into Benny all at once.
“When my father left I blamed myself and I know it’s not the same, but for the longest time, I would lay awake at night praying to God to forgive me for being so bad my dad left” He sighs he hasn't thought about that in years. The memory of him lying awake at night, alone in his bed, looking up at the painted stars on his ceiling with his hands crossed begging God to return his dad to him. It was his dad who had painted the stars on his ceiling so he'd feel closer to the heavens. Now the stars were painted over and no one had heard from Mr. Novak in years. Truth to be told he had no idea if his dad was dead or alive, the last time he ever saw the man he had been eight. “Like I said, not the same but I understand the guilt, still doesn't make it your fault”
“Dean, stop it. You can’t blame yourself, you’ve no way of knowing what would have happened” Cas hops down from the hood to properly face Dean, who only gives him a tired look there’s something else in his eyes too, but Cas can’t place it. He keeps his eyes on Dean, studying his face trying to decipher what he is thinking. It’s Dean who turns away, running his hand down his face.
“That’s awfully inconsiderate of them” Cas stated with a straight face, earning a genuine laugh from Dean as he stubbed out the finished cigarette.
“She’s so pretty and smart and funny. Her impression of Wakko from the Animaniacs is fantastic ” Sam smiled down at his food glancing up at his brother.
Charlie laughed at that. Ash had a tendency of ending up in detention every-other-day ever since middle school. According to him, it was his way of sticking it to the man and raising a little anarchy.
“Dean, perfect you can help me with the dishes” Ellen slipped out of Bobby’s arms, the shuffling must have been him moving across the kitchen to wrap his wife in an embrace. Ellen turned towards the skin, already filled with soapy water, not waiting to see if he would listen to her or not. Bobby clapped Dean on the shoulder on his way out. Dean grabbed the dish towel and started drying the dishes Ellen handed him.
They managed to climb higher than Dean had on his own but they failed to see the farm regardless. The leaves were way too thick and branches too narrow for one, let alone two boys walk or sit on. Instead, they had climbed down to the lower branches and just sat there. Dean was explaining all about Batman (a gazillionaire, with a dead mum and dad who wore a mask and fought crime with the help of his butler and Robin) to Cas. Then all about Star Trek (apparently it was way better than Star Wars and set in space), all about transformers (cars turning into robots, which was friggin amazing!) and even about something called the muppets and the two best friends on there called Bert and Ernie (a show for babies like Sammy, Dean’s brother). Cas could sit there and listen to Dean forever, the way he spoke about the things he loved, especially Sammy made him light up making Cas feel like he was sitting next to sunshine.
Jo snorted “In detention, he got caught in the computer lab again. I’ll ask him when I see him in history.”
With a sigh, he poured the berry filling into the crust, before sticking the whole thing into the preheated oven. Setting a timer for 40min, he sat down in their living room with the book he had found at a flea market:
Castiel was resting his head against the cool metal of his locker, hoping the coldness on his temples would help subside his oncoming migraine. The lights in the hallway were too bright, the chatter of the surrounding students too loud and the mid-September weather too hot making the air too thick, feeling heavy in his lungs. The locker next to him slammed shut, the metallic screech making Cas flinch, the sound driving a knife through his frontal lobe.
“Oh yeah, thanks, Oprah. If you don’t shut the hell up you are walking to the library” Dean grabbed the car keys and headed for the door
Dean was wiping down the bar, having already cleaned the nozzles of the beer taps while Pam was cashing out the till. The bar was cast in deep shadows the only lights still on in the restaurant hung above the bar; Dean saw his reflection in the big windows, where the bright neon sign now read 'Closed'. The  Music had already been turned off so they worked in comfortable silence. He really liked Pam, she had an air of authority about her that instantly grabbed your attention, but still managed to come off as laid back. Dean had seen her throw out enough bikers to know that she wasn’t to be messed with when it came down to it.
He had politely refused, the cabin was his home, it was where he had lived and it would be where he died. The stubborn look his daughter had shot his way after he told her so, was so identical to her other dad it had made Cas laugh and kiss her forehead as he had done so many times her growing up.
The argument with his father had been one of the worst ones they had ever had, Dean had to physically get in between them. Somehow, Sam had convinced their dad that it was the best for him, and so John had agreed to let them go back home, with the condition that Dean would look after his brother. A ridiculous condition, Dean had always felt responsible for the kid ever since that horrid afternoon almost a decade ago.
“Thank you, Jo,” He says awkwardly. Carefully sifting through the silk paper in the bag he pulls out a light blue planner with bees on the cover, flicking through it, each week had a pollinator fact in one of the corners.
“Listen, Sam, in my experience no 13yo girl- She’s 13 right? It’s not like you’re crushing on the lunch lady or anything” He teases, which prompts Sam to kick him under the table
Cas had no idea what to say to that. They fall silent again and Cas can feel his finger start going numb from the cold. “What happens? In your dreams?” This it’s Cas that breaks to silence. He’s not expecting Dean to actually answer him, so he’s surprised when Dean sighs next to him.
The rest of the afternoon and evening was a blur. A lot of people had gathered in the street in front of their house. The police had closed off their house with yellow tape. The ambulance people had come and carried out a black bag. When it got dark outside the blue and red lights from the cop cars flashed on the walls of Ms Ackers small kitchen, mocking Dean. His Coco stood abandoned on the kitchen table, the tiny marshmallows had turned into mush ages ago.
“I saw the way you reacted when Sam mentioned college, don’t you want him to go?” Cas kept looking at him, Dean tried to match his stare but had to look away.
“Don’t you think I know that? But they aren’t- John Winchester isn’t the type of man to accept charity” Bobby’s voice tired making him sound a lot older than his 42 years. Dean’s grip on the plate tightened.
“Mornin’” Sammy yawned grabbing a cup of coffee sitting down at the kitchen table where Dean handed him a plate with a few pieces of bacon and two fried eggs. “Aren’t you going to eat?” Sam waved his fork at Dean’s cup of coffee. Sam’s tone was cold, he was clearly still pissed from yesterday.
“Hiya, Cas!” Dean balanced the receiver between his shoulder and cheek, gesturing to Sam to get the groceries.
Blink once and it was Halloween, blink once more and a month had gone by. November had brought with it the early onset of winter, evident by the frost clinging to the windshield of the Impala in the mornings and the number of bent bumpers Dean had had to straighten out for customers caught by surprise by the slippery roads.
“No, NO don’t touch Sammy. NO” Dean was full-on crying now holding his brother tighter to his chest, the idea of letting his brother go made panic swell in him. A hysterical Sammy clinging to his neck did little to ease Dean's panic.
“Dude you’re weird” Dean shrugged. “That’s alright I’ll tell you everything you need to know, but that means I get to be Batman, for now, you’re Robin cus you're my student in the fight against crime” Dean’s grin filled his whole face when he looked at Cas. “ Next time we play we can pretend to be Captain Kirk and Spock on the Enterprise”
“You are quite good at that, son” a burly voice sounded behind him. Dean shot up, hitting his head on the propped-up hood. He turned around, rudding the back of his head not having heard the older man walk up behind him.
“It’d be a lie to say there was love lost between us”  He turns, facing the other teen, their faces were closer than he had expected, he could feel Dean’s breath on his face, he could smell the mint toothpaste. Thank god for the darkness hiding the blush burning spreading across his cheekbones. Could he hear how fast his heart was beating?
It was too late as Jo was leaning up to meet him and their lips met in an awkward, beer-flavored kiss. They both pulled back, blinking.
Cas was perplexed. Next time? Had he finally made an actual friend? Most other children found him too weird to hang out with, even his older brothers, with perhaps the exception of Gabriel, preferred to play without him. Dean seemed like a nice kid and he hadn’t made fun of Cas yet as all the other kids at his private primary school did. Cas climbed higher to catch Dean.
They played a few rounds of Egyptian Ratscrew while the casserole finished cooking. Cas won three out of five rounds. (Dean did NOT pout, no matter what Cas said)
EDIT 17.3 *** Sorry I have just gone over this chapter again. I must have updated the wrong version as I was being v careful fixing the errors in this chapter.  The amount of mistakes I had to fix is embarrassing! No telling if I got them all, but a fair bit***
“Castiel you need to stop letting her dictate your life” Jo has said this to him before, of course, but it still grates on him. He never had understood the concept of teenage rebellion. The concept of teenagers had only existed since the 50s so how could there be an innate desire to rebel just because of your age? What would his grand act of rebellion even be?
Exactly one week later John Winchester had his Impala packed with minimal belongings, his sons in the backseat. None of them said anything as they pulled out of their driveway and drove out of town.
As per usual leaving kudos and comments are highly encouraged and welcomed.  They help me a lot, any criticism is welcome but be kind or I'll cry.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas reached out to grab Dean’s hand. Dean squeezed it in response. He took a few moments to calm his breathing until he managed to reply.
Jo, who had followed her mom out of the kitchen, reappeared in the room. The hope of burrowing Bobby’s truck had been squashed. To their surprise, Dean offered to be the designated driver as Sam intended to spend the night catching up on work for when he started school on Monday. Dean had nothing else to do with his afternoon, but the offer was probably just an excuse to escape the studying gaze of Ellen, Jo’s mom.
Jo, Ash, Charlie, and Cas all rolled up just shortly after 8 pm, all soaking wet after having to walk in the downpour from the entrance of the park where they parked. Dean didn’t know why he suddenly felt awkward having people in his space, none of them had said anything or cast any sideways glances, but he couldn’t help but feel they were judging him. He had stood there shifting his weight around watching as the four other teens chatted among themselves, continuing the conversation from the ride over while putting their beers in the fridge.
Cas visibly deflated, “You’re right Dean. It’s” he took a deep breath. ''It's complicated. My whole life I’ve tried to please my family and my whole life they’ve told me I don’t fit. That I’m the square peg, in the round hole. So if following what they want on this one thing will make me fit, then that’s what I’ll do. Of course, there are things I want, but it’s pointless to wish for things I can never have.”
“Yeah, Castiel here is following his mom’s dream of Ivy league medical school” Jo busied herself by downing half of her beer.
“It’s not like that. It’s just intense when I’m the only one living at home, Anna is still in Europe so mother focuses on me more than usual that's all”
Once at the farm, they headed to the logs behind the main house, someone had dragged them there as a makeshift campsite. The weeds were almost elbow-high, but the path to the campsite was well trampled zigzagging around rocks and long since disregarded wheelbarrows and other rusting scrap metal. Every single wall of all the buildings was covered in graffiti, from actual elegant works of art of sunflower fields to random “wuz here” tags and penises in the elegant form of self-expression only known to graffiti artists. Part of the charm of the farm was how it felt like time had forgotten the place existed, packed its bags in the '80s never to return again.
“You sleep on the side of the wall,” Dean said handing Cas the quilt from the back of the sofa to use as a blanket. Cas crawled in as close to the wall he could, the wood panel chilly against his arm. Dean laid down next to him switching off the light before doing so. “Night Cas,” Dean muttered before pulling the covers up to his ears, laying on his back.
Dean stirred under his touch, he quickly retrieved his hand holding his breath waiting to see if Dean would calm down again. Instead, he sat up, his back towards Cas. He was just about to apologize for waking him when he heard Dean stifle a sniff, the apology dying on his lips. He closes his eyes, trying to breathe evenly pretending to be asleep, he doubted Dean wanted him to hear him cry. Cas watched as Dean snuck out of the bedroom, his steps soundless on the worn carpet, it wasn’t until he heard the front door open that he sat up. He waited only a few minutes before getting up and walking out to the living room, he spotted Dean through the window leaning against the hood of his car smoking.  Judging by the temperature in the living space, it must be freezing outside.
“Fuck Dean, go be with your brother. I was told they had sent the cleaning crew already” Dean just nodded at his dad’s words, turning around to walk back down to the car in a daze. Dean stopped mid-way down the steps to take a picture off the wall. It was of him when he was 3, his mom hugging him from behind, kissing his cheek.
He was drumming his motor oil-covered fingers against the steering wheel impatiently watching his brother cross the school parking lot. The greeting died on Dean’s lips as soon as he caught a glimpse of Sam when he heaved himself into the cabin of the truck face, a hefty shiner decorating his left cheek and eye.
Cas didn’t say much in general but was more quiet than usual. If his friends noticed they didn’t mention it. Eventually, they all quieted down, a result of the weeds calming effect and the relaxing crackle from the fire. Crickets chirped in the tall grass surrounding them and somewhere in the woods behind the farm an owl had begun to hoo, and Cas thought he could've sat there forever. It beat going home to an empty dark house, his mother and Zachariah were out of town and he didn’t even remember when he saw any of his siblings last.
“Which actress would you say I’m most like?” Jo asked without looking up from her magazine. “Winona Ryder, Liv Tyler, Jodie Sweetin or Claire Danes?”
Life kept on rolling, as life tends to do. No matter what earthshattering event rocked one's personal life, the universe had the audacity to keep spinning, planets spun around their stars, the stars spun around the centre of galaxies that in turn travels around space. There is a theory within astrophysics. Every point in the universe is at its centre, so in a way, everyone is at the centre of their own universe and a tragedy could easily rip it apart creating an all consuming black hole.  John Winchester and sons leaving, an insignificant blip as far as the universe was concerned, but it did move an entire town, creating a temporary black hole. The murder of Mary Winchester had been the talk of the town for months. Mothers wouldn't let their children outside alone, husbands bought guns to protect their families and everyone would make sure their doors were locked at night. A perfectly natural response from a small community, previously operating under the assumption that nothing bad could ever find them in the little corner of the world they inhabited. The News Papers had kept the townspeople informed of every small development in the case, there had even been a mention in the paper when John and the boys had left:
“Why would you say that, of course, it isn’t your fault” Cas looks at Dean aghast. Dean’s laugh is humorless “It is. I was late that day. Dad had gone out looking for me. Had I just gone home-”
. His mother’s wail echoed in his head, bouncing around his skull like a ping pong ball. His leg started to bounce with anxiety, he had to straighten it to make it stop.
Two weeks later they held Mary Winchester's funeral. Dean was standing in a cemetery, watching his mothers coffin being lowered into the ground. Sammy was clutching Dean’s hand soft tears rolling down his still baby round cheeks. Dean hadn't cried since the day it happened and he didn’t cry now, not in front of these people.  He had seen his dad completely break down, screaming at the coffin with treas streaming down his unshaven face. No, Dean would not cry in front of these people, he needed to be strong for Sammy and for his dad.
He vaguely acknowledged the front door opening, he poured the cream of mushroom over the dish before putting the whole thing in the oven. “
Sam burst through the door just as Dean pulled the dish out of the oven. “Dean!” Sam squealed, filing his school bag onto the raggedy couch, his cheeks red from the cold, eyes shining with excitement. “ Imma go to college! My English teacher thinks I’ve got a real shot at getting into an Ivy league one!”
Cas had no idea of what to do so he said the same thing his father had told him when his Grandmother had died.
, it’s all business in the front and party in the back” Ash sipped his beer throwing his legs up on the coffee table. Jo had dug out a CD handing it to Charlie.
“Did you at least get a few good punches in?” A real parent might have reprimanded him for getting into a fight during his first week, but Dean felt a slight twinge of pride. Leave it to Sammy to defend the kid.
) fished out two beers out of the fridge handing the other to Dean, which he accepted without a word.
“You ready?” Dean asked when he saw Sammy look out at the house sceptically. Neither of them had seen Bobby since they left. Sammy said he didn’t remember the man at all, and all Dean could recall was a man in a dirty baseball cap.
“Mom?” He called up feeling small and scared as he walked up the steps passing their family photos hung on the blue wall.
It had been years since he last had had that specific nightmare. It made his skin crawl, and he itched to punch something. The last time he had had a nightmare about their mom he had gone out and punched a lamp-post outside their motel room, breaking his index and middle finger. The pain had been sobering, making him feel grounded in reality helping him to shake loose from the clammy grip of the dream. The look on Sammy’s face, when he bandaged his hand, had instantly brought him crashing down making him feel even worse. Sam had made him promise to not do anything so stupid again, a promise he was trying to keep.
He had only read a few chapters before the timer went off, he set the pie to the side to cool off. Emma would arrive in a few hours, leaving him enough time to take a short nap. (why don't they warn you about how exhausting getting old was?)
Please leave kudos if you enjoyed it and comment with anything you'd like. Any feedback helps me a lot :)
After uploading the uncheck and unedited chapter last time and didn't realize until a few days later. I want to make sure I don't do THAT mistake again T,T.
They stomped out the remaining embers. None of them thought of bringing flashlights with them, leaving them to stumble back to the car in the darkness. Dean dropped them home one after one, Cas was the last one left, besides Jo.
Dean pulled his Impala into the driveway of Bobby’s house. It had been the shock of the century when John handed Dean the keys to his beloved chevy and told him it was now his car.
“I hope that’s OK? Michale and Lucien came home early for Thanksgiving and the atmosphere is….tense.” Cas sighed, at which Dean crooked an eyebrow. He wiped his hands on his jeans, moving past Cas into the living room.
“I wanna climb this tree, come on Cas. Old times sake.” Dean offered him a hand to pull him up from the ground. “I’ll let you be Batman,” he winked. This time Cas was the one to laugh.
He’s glad he didn’t as soon as Ellen brings out an Apple pie for dessert. Ellen must have seen the excitement on his face as she cuts him a bigger slice than anyone else. If he moans around the first forkful he won’t ever admit it. It’s then that Bobby informs them he received a phone call from John, he had organised for Sam and Dean to move into their own trailer in the trailer park on the edge of the town in two weeks. Dean felt a surge of relief, no matter how grateful he was for the Singer’s hospitality and Bobby offering him a job he could not wait until it was just him and Sammy again, the way it had always been. A quick look at his brother, however, he could tell Sam wasn’t as enthused by the idea. His expression had grown dark, he quickly thanked  Ellen for dinner and hurried out of the warm kitchen. There was a short silence, broken by Dean grabbing his plate of pie and hurries after Sam muttering an apology to Ellen.
“Speaking of which, have you started your scholarship applications yet MIT doesn’t open up applications until January but I’ve been revising the old material?” Charlie asked sitting down next to Ash
After a while when Dean is positive his dad won’t be brought up he relaxes, they work in silence that’s not exactly comfortable but almost reassured. They finish the dishes in silence, Dean is drying the last plate when Ellen finally breaks the silence.
“Oh, don’t tell me your life is the poster for a Hallmark movie” Dean poked him in the arm, teasingly. Cas squinted at Dean, not sure what kind of answer he was expecting. “I guess my mother can be a bit overbearing and my step-father he’s unpleasant” Cas cringed at his own words. Dean huffed a laugh “Family can be rotten”
Dean looked over at Cas who was giving him a confused look. “Why would you shake or stir a can of coke? That is a terrible idea”
He was brooding looking out the passenger side window, watching the mix of post-colonial and craftsman houses, neatly collected into all American neighbourhoods, zip past. It wasn’t until Dean squeezed his shoulder that he looked up.
“Yes,” Cas sat down next to him throwing his head back against the backrest “Lucien changed his name to Lucifer and my mother is furious” Cas spoke at the ceiling causing Dean to erupt out laughing. “Wow and I thought my family was messed up”
“You serious? You don’t know who Batman is?” Cas shook his head no. His parents didn’t allow him to read or watch anything that might entice him with the Devil.
“If you did, you’d know that’s no longer a thing” He whispered, before standing back up leaving her personal space.  “We could pretend it’s last night on earth,” He said low enough so the other three sitting in the living room, pretending they weren’t ears dropping, couldn’t hear him.
He opened his mouth to decline the offer again, but instead, he heard himself say: “Thank you, I would appreciate it”
Dean blinked, he had never met someone willingly reading that stuff. The few times his mother managed to drag their family to church Dean would hide his Game Boy in the pocket of the itchy blue cardigan his mother insisted he wore. He’d then hunch down at a bottom of a pew so he could play during the sermon.
The two boys sat on the lowest branch facing each other, curiously studying each other. The dark-haired boy was dressed in a white polo shirt and black trousers and looked way too serious for a kid his age. His dark hair a mess, sticking out in every direction imaginable, but his blue eyes had the same mischievous glint in them as Dean’s own.
Heaving themselves up onto the branches was a lot easier than it had been at age seven. The whole tree seemed smaller, the branches slimmer and less sturdy. The sun was licking the top of the tree line, it would disappear completely behind it in under an hour, engulfing them, the tree and the town in the dim light of autumn twilight.  They were dangling their feet off of the branch they were sitting on.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to alarm you” Cas took a few deep breaths to even out his breathing. Dean huffed a laugh “Nice knees” He eyed Cas, before leaning his head back, eyes closed.
“We better start heading back before Ellen sends out a search party again.” Charlie finally said standing up stretching her legs. The fire had almost completely died and without the warmth, from the fire, the nightly dew was gripping at their clothes making the chilly night air feel a lot colder than it was.
On rainy days they’d sit in Dean’s room where Dean would show Cas his Batman comics, Cas even got to be Batman once. When Sammy wanted to join them, he got to be the Robin to Cas’ Batman and Dean offered to be The Joker. They would run around the house trying to Nerf each other. When they got too loud, Mr Winchester yelled at them to either be quiet or take it outside. As it was still raining they opted to play Super Mario Bros on Dean’s Nintendo John had gotten him for Christmas.
Every time I talk about anyone cooking I'm referencing a real recipe, would you like me to link the recipes?
He inhaled deeply feeling the crisp morning air fill his old lungs and sighed loudly on the exhale. These early autumn mornings out by the pier of their cottage had once upon a time been his favourite, now they filled him with a melancholy that made the sorrow in his bones ache. Cas looked down at his wrinkled hands wrapped around the chipped “Best Papa in The World”- Mug and tightened his grip around it, his wedding ring making a quiet 'click' against the porcelain, the warmth travelling up his tired arms giving him little comfort.
“Yeah, let’s go” Sammy opened the door stepping out. Maybe things would actually be alright for once.
His deflection worked. As the discussion steered off to other topics. Dean and Ash both complained about the music again when
I struggled with this chapter for some reason, and I think it shows a reading it back. I promise future chapters, in my opinion, get better .
Again this isn't betad, so the mistakes are all my own. Spell check and  The free version of Grammarly helps a lot but dyslexia is a mighty opponent.
For a while after Dean’s death, Cas would walk down here with two full cups, only for the coffee in the “Bert and Ernie”- mug to be left next to Cas on the bench to go cold. The person it was intended for no longer there to drink it. Now Cas left the mug empty on the counter in the kitchen.
“Happy Birthday Cas”  Looking up he saw Jo holding out a blue gift bag to him. “Don’t worry, It’s nothing special. It just made me think of you” she let the bag dangle from her ring finger, voice nonchalant.
There was a small spark in the back of his mind that acknowledged that he found this stranger attractive, but over the years he had become a master in snuffing that spark out every time he felt drawn to other men. He was so good at it, that he had convinced himself his same-sex attraction did
It was a Thursday. Dean swung the front door open, throwing his The California raisins- backpack on the floor in the hallway before peaking into the kitchen looking for his mom. He knew he was late, he had lost track of time playing soccer after school. Peaking into the kitchen expecting to see his mothers scolding face, ready to reprimand him, instead, the kitchen was empty with the ingredients for dinner on the counter. The oven clock read 4.05. Odd, his mum and brother were nowhere to be seen and the house was eerily quiet. There was a loud thud from upstairs as Sammy started crying. Something felt off as Dean approached the stairs, Sanny's cries growing louder.
The whole kitchen smelled like caramelizing onions and cooking pork, the raspy vocals of Robert Plant in
Sam had pouted the whole way to the library, refusing to look at Dean. Fine by him. After dropping his brother off he had driven around without a destination the music loud enough to hurt his ears. Somehow he had ended up in front of their old house. The once white house had been painted a pale blue the people who lived there now must have kids. There was a pink tricycle in the driveway and a doll-stroller on the lawn.
They quickly assembled and lit a bonfire as it slowly got darker around them. The light from the fire cocooning them in a snow globe of light.
“That’s it. We’re having as many movie nights as it takes for me to get you caught up on pop culture for the past three decades”  Dean told Cas as he was sitting down in the front seat of Ash’s 87’s Volvo. He was tempted to ask Cas to stay the night, using the move as a pretense so he didn’t have to be alone, but he refused to be that pathetic. He watched as they drove away dreading to go back to the trailer and to sleep. Afraid that he’d have that dream again, he wasn’t nearly drunk enough to have a dreamless sleep. Instead, he busied himself by walking to the ATM at the Gas station half a mile down the road to withdraw the rent money due the next day, only to be met by an ‘insufficient funds message’. John had once again forgotten to deposit the rent money. He’d have to use the money he had earned at Bobby’s. The rent would eat up most of his paycheck. He’d have to get another job. With a frustrated groan, Dean punched the brick wall, splitting his knuckles open. The pain was almost cathartic.
Dean overheard John tell Bobby that he was planning on taking Sam and Dean and leave town. Dean wanted to scream that they couldn’t leave, what if mom decided to come back? How would she find them if they were no longer living in their house? Dean could feel his tears burn the back of his eyelids. He would have run to his room but he refused to go upstairs in case the stain was still there. So Dean ran out of the house, ran towards the large Oak and kept running until he reached the top of the hill. His breath burning in his lungs.
“Yeah yeah just stop ruining one of my favorite films with your logic” Dean stood up to turn on the ceiling light and grab the tape. Now that the film was no longer playing, Cas could read the time on the player again, it was almost 10 pm, he should head home.
“MY MOM IS DEAD! CAS SHE’S DEAD!” Cas flinched when Dean started yelling, his voice breaking when he started to cry again. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean hugging him close. He felt Dean’s arms come up to hug him back, face buried in his neck.
“Bobby told me to take the weekend off, and if I showed up at the garage he’d fire me, total BS but anywho. Sam is at the library again, he’s too smart for his own good. So I- I went for a drive and I don’t know man, this place is full of memories I guess” Dean made a subconscious reach for his cigarettes, only to realise he left them on the ground with his jacket. Cas gave him a confused look.
“I just- Dean I don’t want him to show up and up demand, we follow him to god knows where!” Sam’s voice rose the more he talked
“Don’t think so, that’s what has my mom is all up in arms, doesn't want them to live on their own, 'they're just kids Bobby'."  Jo mimicked her mother's voice "What happened exactly? I didn’t live here then” Jo leaned in over the table.
Arriving in a new town, surrounded by new people with new expectations and starting anew was something Dean Winchester was accustomed to. It was all he had known for the majority of his life. Moving to a new town, city or state, never really belonging anywhere was how he had grown up. Never making any genuine connections or relationships, never getting to know people well enough for him to care whether or not he disappointed them or not. It made everything so much easier when John unavoidably packed up their life again and moved them to the next town. Saying the whispers and looks they would never bother him would’ve been a lie, he had become an expert in converting in up, throw on a come-hither-smile and a charming persona got you far if you didn’t stick around long enough for people to see through your facade.
“Must belong to Bobby’s friend, his son’s are staying with us for a while” Jo shrugged, taking two porch steps at a time up to her house.
Sorry, it's taken me so long to update! I had some major writer's block. I do have a semi-plan of what needs to happen it's filling in the gaps that sometimes has me blocked.
He felt a familiar warm hand slid into his, giving it a soft squeeze. It was the hand of a much younger man, slightly rough from working on cars every day, otherwise smooth unaffected by old age. A soft smile tugged on Cas' lips as he closed his eyes and fell asleep his joints no longer ached, his breathing no longer laboured, he felt light and peaceful.
That’s how they all had ended up in the black car parked out front. Jo, Cas and Ash in the Back with Charlie in the front alongside Dean, she had been mature and called “shotgun” from the porch.
Once he rounded the hallway into the sunflower yellow kitchen he instantly spotted who the laughter belonged to. Leaning against the counter was a boy, about his age, wearing an oversized leather jacket laughing at something the lanky teen, with shaggy brown hair, next to him had said.
“I have a junkyard full of spare parts, help yourself” he threw the part back, Dean catching it with both hands. He had hoped Bobby would say yes if he asked, but never expected him to offer for Dean to sort through the old cars for parts so freely.
“If it’s working” he winked “ And to your other question, I don’t kiss and tell” He smirked around his beer, trying to exude false confidence.
. Cas knew nothing of cars but thought it to be impressive and couldn’t resist running his fingers over the shiny hood.
I still have dyslexia so my mistakes are all my own. I do go over older chapters to fix stupid mistakes I spot, somehow it is easier to spot mistakes after you already pressed 'post'. A free trial to Grammarly only gets me so far : D
“SCREW YOU CAS!" Dean was still crying but his voice was steady "I HATE YOUR STUPID GOD!" Dean stopped to swallow his tears "HE TOOK MY MOM! I HATE GOD AND-" Dean paused to catch himself "-I HATE YOU!” Dean’s arms shook while he stood there yelling at Cas.
“Yeah, my dad taught me a few things, I had to know how to take care of my Baby” He tried to cover up, how startled he was by the light-hearted tone in his voice failing miserably.
The house, if only judged from the outside, could use some love, the white paint was peeling off in places and the once green window sills had seen better days, some only hanging on by one or two hinges. But once inside you’d find a home, with mismatched furniture and floor to ceiling bookshelves lining the walls, filled with books on every topic imaginable. Both Bobby and Ellen were avid readers and book collectors, which may have been odd for a bar matron and a mechanic.
“It was enjoyable, however, Jones plays no part in the outcome of the movie” The look on Dean’s face fell. “What do you mean?” The end credits had stopped and the TV showed the standard blue standby screen. The light highlighting his straight nose, high cheekbones, and the curvature of his upper lip, his lashes casting a shadow on his cheek. Cas found it harder and harder to look away from the other teen.
“Last night on earth, I’d like to spend it with some self-respect” she whispered in his ear. Now it was Jo’s turn to crowd him, as she pressed up against him her breath tickling his neck.
“Me? Ha, yeah right. I couldn’t even finish High School, don’t think the fine institution of higher education is for me” he flashed them his most charming smile, hoping it’d deter them from any further questioning. He felt Cas’ eyes at the side of his face, purposefully looking in the other way to avoid catching Cas’ eyes, scared of seeing what he might see there.
Dean didn’t know what came over him when he jumped up and followed her,  with a wink to Ash and Cas.
“You need me to come?” Dean asked, soul work wasn’t his forte but he’d be willing to do it if it helped Bobby.
Once Dean was fully sheathed he pulled out until only the tip was inside, he waited a few seconds before pushing back into the angel with a powerful thrust. Castiel moaned as he clawed at Dean’s back, feeling the full force of Dean’s thrusts. Castiel pushed his hips up meeting the kitsune’s thrusts and soon the two beings fell into a nice fast paced rhythm. Dean wanted to reach down to stroke at Castiel’s dick but he resisted the urge, knowing that it would make him explode like a rocket and Dean didn’t want it to end so soon.
With one last suck to his head, Dean felt his orgasm wash over him and he shot his load into Castiel’s mouth. The angel swallowed it all up until Dean’s dick stopped spurting. Dean took his dick out of Castiel’s mouth and panted from the aftershock of his orgasm.  That was probably the hardest he’s ever cum in a long time, he should have Castiel to do this more often.
Dean decided to give the angel mercy and let him have what he wanted. He lifted the waistband off his skin and Castiel lifted his hips making it easier to slip the last of his clothing off. The angel moaned in relief as his erection fell against his stomach, he reached down to try and relieve himself a bit, but Dean’s loud snarl made him stop. “No touching! Didn’t I tell you that? I guess now you need to be punished now,” Dean smirked.
The rhythm that he had created quickly turned into erratic thrusts as he felt himself getting closer and closer to the edge. He groaned in ecstasy as he felt himself dangling right on the ledge of pleasure.
Dean twisted and squeezed the angel’s head, fingering the slit at the tip, “Come on Cas, cum for me.”
Nope! He wasn’t going to be a part of this. He quickly teleported away letting Dean and Castiel relax in the feeling of after sex.
Speaking of the angel Castiel whimpered drawing Dean’s attention. “Well, a deals a deal.” The kitsune smirked, “You still want me to touch you?”
Castiel’s nails suddenly dug even harder in Dean’s back and Dean was almost sure he could smell blood, but he ignored it, instead feeling pleasure at the action. Castiel shrieked as Dean’s cock hit his prostate and continued to pound into him with no mercy.
“A coke, shaken not stirred for Red, back there” He joked. Jo huffed a laugh opening the can and tried to get Charlie to drink some.
“You hate the government” Cas pointed out at the same time as Charlie asked: “You think you’re smart enough?”
Once Dean reached the top landing he understood why. He could see right into Sammy’s room where his mom was pinned to the wall by a tall, skinny man. Sammy sat in his bed face red from screaming, snot and tears running down his face, desperately clutching his Flint Stone-blanky. Dean stood there staring at his mum and the stranger feeling tears burn the corners of his eyes.
Cas was tired despite having just woken up he could feel the tiredness in his soul. He had felt himself grow wearier and wearier, ever since Dean’s death. If he closes his eyes he can still hear Dean’s laugh carry over from the garage, where he'd work, first on his own car later on multiple others when his body shop took off.
, he knew his habit of staring at people tended to make them uncomfortable. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to-”
While Dean took his turn in the shower, Sam explained the show to Cas (apparently it was centered around bringing light to unsolved murder cases, this week it was the case of Alicia Showalter) Dean made them grilled cheese sandwiches for an evening snack, the melted cheese filling deliciously gooey offsetting the slightly burnt bread. They finish the episode while they eat, Cas sat there listening to Dean and Sam bicker and joke around, feeling like an outsider.
They fell into a comfortable silence, the setting sun turned the light golden but with the loss of the warmth of the sun, the October breeze was quick to remind them of what season it was. Castiel had turned his head to study Dean’s face and how the light bounced off his cheekbones highlighting the freckles dotted there.
“You guy’s laugh, but I was grounded for a month!” Jo stood up from where she’d been sitting next to Dean, shuddering at the memory of the last time they had stayed out until daybreak only for a furious Ellen Singer to come and drag them home. “Beware, Dean, my mom will not hesitate to lock you up if you defy her.”
“Yeah, but you see ‘troubles’ as you put it, don’t wait until you become an adult” Dean’s voice had a strain to it. He busied himself with the almost gone cigarette.
With the money from both the garage, what he made at the bar, and to his surprise, John had remembered to send the rent money on time, Dean had enough to buy actual groceries and to put some in savings. (Good thing too Sam was going to need a whole new wardrobe, the kid kept growing like a weed)
Dean followed Cas’ directions until he pulled up in front of a green postcolonial with a manicured lawn. The house was a dark silhouette against the night sky.
“What’s wrong with tea?” He asked seriously, tilting his head at the boy next to him. “It’s leaf water, Cas!”  Dean finally reacted, raising his voice, but continued to sip it.
Cas looked at the stranger properly for the first time. There was something familiar about those mischievous eyes and that freckled face. Then memories of summer, Oaks, lakes, and bike races flashed across his mind, glowing with childhood nostalgia. Could it be?
“Earlier, when you asked what was bugging me” Dean clarified, his voice hollow. Cas tried to catch the look on Dean’s face, but he avoided his eyes on purpose. Then he realised what Dean was referring to. It was almost exactly ten years since his father had grabbed him and Sam and left town. Ten years since -
When no new case updates came, the town moved on as if nothing had happened comforted by the illusion once again that nothing bad could ever happen to them. Everyone assumed their daily routines. Cas no longer went to the Oak. Life simply rolled on. Ten years passed bringing new people into town with them came new routines, over time these new people became old people with mundane routines. Nothing ever changed, but at the same time, everything did.
“Castiel, as long as you live under my roof I expect you to show me some respect and answer my questions. Do I need to have a conversation with Naomi?” Zach’s tone was as condescending as ever.
“Awesome! I’ll grab you a towel, you can shower as soon as Rapunzel gets out.” Dean said, clapping his hands together.
On especially warm days they’d go swimming in the clear water, diving down for blue mussels, prying them open with sticks, hoping to find pearls. Dean was much better at holding his breath, making him the superior diver. They'd also climb the rocks by the shore trying to push each other into the water playing 'King of the Hill'. It was during this game that Dean had shoved Cas, making him lose his balance and instead of landing in the water Cas had hit his forehead on the rocks leaving him with a permanent scar on his eyebrow. Dean had apologised profusely, but Cas had insisted that it only made him look more badass.
“Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place, to begin with,” Cas frowned.
“Of course I do! It’s not- it’s nothing Okay? Drop it Cas” He sunk his hands back into the soapy water, still hot enough to sting his hands, and fished out a second plate.
Dean didn’t say anything. Cas settled back against the car and they finished the now cold tea and watched as the sun came up. By the time Dean suggested they head inside Cas’ fingers were so stiff he could barely hold on to the mug.
Their living room/kitchen was freezing, meaning the heating must be broken. Oh, fucking fantastic another thing he’d have to add to his to-do list. The trailer’s previous tenants hadn’t cared one way or another, leaving Dean with a laundry list of things to fix before the winter months. Dean grabbed his leather jacket and stepped outside, sitting down on the front steps to smoke. The slight drizzle was a perfect fit for his mood. The hit of nicotine and the chilly night air did little to help shake the last bits of the nightmare still digging into him like a splinter.
“Sam. Drop. It.” Dean snapped slamming the front door shut marching to the Impala to wait for his brother.
“I got it out of your cupboard” Dean hummed into his drink at Cas’ statement. “Yeah- hmm. I got it for you. You said you preferred this crap over coffee. The honey is a nice touch” The big gulp he takes must burn his throat.
“Is she the reason why you’ve been basically living at the library?” Dean cocks his eyebrow at his brother “So why haven’t you asked her out yet?”
Yes, I did Google how to change a water pump in a muscle car. I know nothing about cars or how to fix them so if i'm wrong plase take it up with Googel.
Digging through the cupboards above the sink, he found two packs of tea and a tub of honey. He put two mugs of water into the microwave, stopping it right before the ‘beep’ so he didn’t wake Sam. Dropping a bag of Earl Gery into each mug, grabbed both the tea and his jacket and headed out.
“Huh? Attempting to reinforce it and hopefully, it’ll last until I can find a replacement” he scratched the back of his sunburnt neck feeling uncomfortable under the mechanics questioning gaze.
of his feet hitting the pavement in time with his breaths made it easy to slip into the runner's trance, where the only thing in focus was the steady ground and the road ahead. Cas loved it. It allowed him to completely empty his mind, he didn’t even listen to music while he ran. Jo called him psychotic for it, he in return would give her the definition of psychotic, which would only earn him en eye roll.
“Good” Ellen smiled at him. “Tell Bobby that I went to the Roadhouse if he asks” With that, she heads out.
“I promised dad I’d take care of you after he agreed to let you finish High School in one place, and I will” It had been Sam’s idea to convince John to let him attend one school. The kid was a genius and Dean would be damned to Hell if he let Sam turn out like him. A 17yo drop out with a rap sheet. No, Sammy wouldn’t turn out like him, not on his watch.
“What’s wrong with her?” Bobby asked, coming up next to Dean. Ignoring how flustered the teen was, for which he was grateful.
Please leave kudos if you enjoyed it and comment with anything you'd like. Any feedback helps me a lot :)
The newcomer decided to break the silence first. “My name is Castiel, it’s nice to meet you,” he said with a polite smile.
Jo just gives him a pointed look but doesn’t say anything else. Perhaps, the reason Jo’s words and the idea of rebellion made him bristle was due to it going against everything he had been raised. To follow rules and live up to expectations his family had of him, and he knows he’ll never be able to fulfil the number one expectation and wish his mother had for him. He knows he won’t ever be able to have children and get married. Let alone marry a girl like Deacon Bartholomew's daughter, or anyone for that matter, not as long as he was- well as long as he was who he was. Michael had once said he was bent, a square peg in a round hole.
The sun rose to its full position while Cas mixed the ingredients for the pie crust, Dean's voice echoing through his mind. "
They would still go out to the Oak a lot, once Dean had managed to sneak his dad’s knife with him. John would kill him if he knew Dean had taken his knife. They used it to carve their names into the trunk of the tree, while Cas told Dean all about Angels and how REAL Angels were terrifying warriors of God, how they didn’t look like people but actually had six eyes, eight wings and their bodies were spinning iron rods. They could smite a Knight of Hell with a single blow. Dean had been thoroughly impressed (“That’s so friggin cool! I always thought Angels were these guys in dresses playing the harp!”)
They sit in silence after that, watching as the sun sunk below the trees. Once it was dark Dean lowered himself down from the tree. He had to go pick Sam up from the library and offered to drive Cas home, which he gladly accepted. Castile found that he liked the interior of Dean's car, it smelled like the mix of worn leather and pine air-freshener underlined with a hint of cigarette smoke. It was a comfortable ride, the drove in silence only sound coming from the car stereo playing some rock song on a low volume. Dean must know it well as he was quietly humming along. Cas didn't have to give Dean directions to his house, he must remember from the bonfire night. Before Cas got out of the car, when they were parked in front of his house, he invited Dean to join him and his friends the following night. Dean accepted, and after giving Cas the phone number to his trailer home so they could exchange details later, he drove off. It wasn't until now that Cas realised how cold and stiff he was, sitting down for hours in the lowering temperatures probably wasn't the smartest idea. Cas jogged up to the house excited for a hot shower and the idea of crawling into bed with a good book.
They made french toast for breakfast (Cas on dipping duty and Dean was manning the pan) and brewed a pot of coffee and okay Cas had to admit if he put enough sugar in his, it took away the bitterness, and made it drinkable. They didn’t mention what they had talked about outside again, but Dean did seem a bit lighter in spirit and maybe, he did too.
Dean didn’t know what to say, he just stared at Cas' mouth open waiting for words to come out. So Dean did what he did best. He went on the defensive and since a good offense was the best defense... “Oh yeah? How about you Cas? Huh? You’re letting your family dictate your entire life. Going to the college of their choosing, going after the career they chose for you. Stones and glass-houses Cas. Why don’t you choose for yourself huh? What do YOU want”
The next few weeks felt like a dream. John had come back late at night to take them to Uncle Bobby’s after an unsuccessful mission to track down the man. He had simply disappeared like black smoke out of the chimney.
“You sure you’re OK,” Jo asked with a crooked eyebrow, Cas had always envied people who knew how to only crook one eyebrow. When he tried it he just looked either slightly confused or slightly surprised.
The murder of Alicia Showalter is still unsolved, but as of 2019 the police were still accepting new tips and leads on her case. They are optimistic that her case can be solved.  https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Police-still-hoping-for-leads-in-1996-murder-of-Alicia-Showalter-Reynolds-506717641.html
They talked more about Sammy’s school and Dean told him about the garage and Rufus Bobby’s other mechanic who would go on and on about his time in ‘Nam painting disturbingly vivid pictures. By the time they exited the restaurant it was pouring down. They made a run for groceries, getting some basic food items, and a bunch of Kraft Dinners. They made another pit stop at Gas-n-Sip for gas and Dean took the opportunity to stock up on Marlboro’s, a six-pack beer, and a bottle of Wild Turkey.
“Dammit. Yeah, of course,” Jo stepped away going to check on her friend who was dozing off against Ash’s shoulder.
“Oh no brother, be careful or she’ll eat you up,” A baritone voice with a strong southern darl says behind him making Dean almost jump out of his skin. Turning around he was face to face with a broad-shouldered man, who looked to be only a few years older than him with pale blue eyes, sandy blond hair, and beard.
“HEY! What ya reading?” Dean shouted down, smiling wide when the boy jumped and looked around confused. “Up here!”
“Yeah, well. I just pointed out what an embarrassing defeat the Vietnam war was and how the moon landing was funded by public funds, making it a socialist program, and how praising the victory in the space race as a capitalistic win was false and full of government propaganda! Oh man, the only difference between us and the USSR is that they left dogs up there. I bet we did worse, not that our government would admit I Besides the Soviets beat us to actual space, so if space was the goal they won!  So obviously his grand act of revenge was to send me to the office for dress code violation” Ash said around a mouthful of tater tots. They all groaned in response.
Cas rolled out the dough over a pie tin, pressing it down and pinching the edges. The song now playing was
Dean was quiet for a long time staring into the distance, before letting go of Cas’ hand. Dean tightened his fist at his sides, his whole body going stiff. “My mom is dead,” Dean said in such a quiet whisper Cas wasn’t sure he had heard him right.
Losing his partner had been the most painful thing imaginable, it had felt like an ice dagger buried in his chest. Cas was so utterly grateful for the life they had had. He had gotten dealt a better hand in life than most people could dream of. Looking at the fog still clinging to the surface of the lake, dancing over the water, Cas could swear he could make out little shapes in the mist. Figures playing out the memories of his life; meeting Dean, becoming best friends, falling in love, falling apart, that night in Charlie's kitchen, getting married, raising their daughter, her graduation, her wedding, the birth of their grandson, Dean’s diagnosis, the last six months and finally the funeral. The 57 years he had gotten with Dean, over a lifetime spent together, was now only a string of hazy memories.
“Do you wanna come up here with me? I can try and show you a murderous pig farm” Dean climbed down further offering his hand down to pull the odd boy up into the tree with him. The dark-haired boy hesitated at first but evidently decided to trust Dean as a warm hand grabbed on to his allowing Dean to pull the other up next to him. The catechism disregarded on the ground.
