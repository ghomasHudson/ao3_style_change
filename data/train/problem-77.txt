“What diference does it make if I tell you or you read it in that bloody file? Why do you care now anyway? You didn’t care before. You never did.” Spat Sherlock back and tried to free his arm of Johns grip, but the doctor did not let go.
“I can’t just leave everything I have and take care of Sherlock 24/7. I have a life, a daughter I have to provide for. “
He took a deep breath trying to calm down the rising panic in his core. Suddenly he lost his footing on the icy ground. He tried to catch himself but he realized that there are two things you need to know about life after an arm amputation: First, your center of gravity changes dramatically when you are suddenly 8 pounds lighter on one side of your body. Second, while your arm may be missing physically, it is there, just as it always has been - in your mind's eye that is. Sherlock can feel every muscle move, he could even feel the arm of the shirt being wrap around his right wrist. When he slipped, he reflexively tried to break his very real fall with his completely imaginary right hand. Of course that did not work … instead the fall was broken by his nose, and his nose was broken by his fall.
“Anybody else?”
Till next time,
“You did it for me didn’t you John? You did it to avenge me. To get justice for my death …” John followed the hand and saw a familiar face. He felt his heart drop when he looked in to the eyes of his beloved.
“If she wakes up you play with her. If she falls -  which she will not, the couch is ginormous compered to her -  you just comfort her.” John truned away from little Rosie and went to grab his jacket and wallet out the kitchen.
“You don’t get a say in this!”
“Did you feel my touch upon your soft skin?”
“No John that’s not true I –“
This was one week after Mary’s funeral. The day Moly gave Sherlock the letter from John. The letter… that’s right …
“Or even better, we can bring little Gorgy in here and you can watch me play with him” there was something twisted in the voice now. There was an ominous undertone to it.
“Has he still not woken up?” John hadn’t been in the hospital for about a week. He had to catch up on his work.
“Hello, it’s been some time! Listen can I call you later, now is really not a good time,” as she said this she decided to continue with the autopsy. She had 2 more to do today so she could not afford to slack off.
Thought the detective to himself and tried to concentrate on his tea again.
John was just about to storm out of the waiting room and demand some information about the operation when the door opened slowly. An older doctor that they have not met yet came in with his surgery mask and cap still on. Before John could realize what he was doing he was already standing and walking towards the surgeon.
“But he was my friend. And when he offered me a hand to help I spit in his face. I almost killed him, Mrs Hudson.”
His head was spinning again the voice ringing in his ears. He was in the cellar again. Locked up, with his hands and legs in shackles. His mouth gagged as to prevent him from speaking – from saving himself. He could feel hands all over his body. It made him feel sick.
Now John knows that Sherlock was just putting up a strong front as to not get hurt by others or be seen as weak. Or did he maybe do it to comfort John? His mind was running wild, he wanted to go and scream at Sherlock for not telling him how he felt, for not reaching out. But then again even if he did John was to focus on himself at that time to even notice the seriousness of the situation.
John buried his face in his arms and let out a deep breath of air. He was tired but he knew that he could not sleep, the nightmares would just wake him up again. His mind slipped away and he did not realize that he started to think about Sherlock again. Today was the first time that he saw him like that. He knew that Sherlock was using again and that he was in a terrible shape even before John beat the crap out of him. But for Sherlock to be so wrong about something? No that could not be. No matter what Sherlock took he would never make a mistake in a case right?
It was just 15 min away from the hospital if you knew your way around the streets, so John arrived there before Mycroft. He didn’t know why he didn’t just tell Mycroft the address and let him handle it. It was truly strange but something in him made him go to this old dump and check it out himself.
“Sherlock, I –“
“You’re right… I could never shoot you. Not you… Everyone, but not you,” Sherlock looked at John’s tired but worried face. Sherlock slowly bend his arm and soon the edge of the gun pressed against his temple.
“Of cour - … Of course I can bloody hear you. I’m not deaf” the voice was little and beardly audible. It even broke mid sentence. He did not move, did not look at John, but still stared in front of himself looking at seemingly nothing.
“So boring, Sherlock! Just shoot yourself already! You are nothing but a bother to everyone! To Mrs Hudson, to Molly, hell even to Mycroft! And most of all to John. You make his life miserable! You are the one who puts him in danger all the time! How many times did he almost die because he was with you! You were even the reason why his wife was killed! Except it Homes, you and that mind of yours are nothing but a curse to everyone around you! Just go and kill yourself already!” Moriartys voice was ringing in his head again, screaming, screeching at his brain.
“Fine. I will come around tomorrow after I’m done here.”
This chapter is a bit darker. It involves mention and actions of torture and mentions suicide. It is dark but it is something that happened to Sherlock and what I think he was going through.
Sherlock looked at Johns face again, his eyes jumping from corner to corner as if he was searching for something. Then he started laughing.
“Well I think that he wants to try it again.” He said it with a firm voice, indicating that he didn’t really think it as much as he knew it. There was a frown forming on Mollys face.
“Thank you ... The file that you have before you everything I have on Sherlock drug use. Everything that I know he ever took is written in here. The time from which we suspect he started to take it, up to how much of what he used when he overdosed.”
“Hallo to you to John, no of cause I have time to talk to you no problem, not like I have to arrest one of the most influential people in the city!” John just looked at Greg kind of confused and then it hit him.
Suddenly the door of the office opened again. Sherlock pulled his legs close to his chest and covered his mouth with his hand. Loud and slow footsteps echoed thru the room. Sherlock looked at John who was still sitting next to him. He wanted to pull him closer to himself and try to hide him from the stranger’s view. But John was having none of it and moved further away from him.
If his calculation were right Mycroft would pull his security on him in about two weeks – three tops. John will probably want to leave tomorrow after the evening they had (he would probably move back in to his apartment. Sherlock could sneak and check up on him from time to time just to make sure that he was ok). Mrs Hudson could be distracted. Mycroft was the only real problem really.
“John?!”
“You a regular here?” John asked as he nodded at the cup of coffee.
“Hey, hello. Listen, Molly? I need your help. It’s about Sherlock.”
And remember Your KingOfHellLovesYOU :D
“Ugh the room stinked like burned flesh for weeks after that… and the maggots that got in there after that- ugh. How they crawled … Tell me Sherlock could you feel them move?”
“Mycroft what the hell is going on? I don’t understand a thing that you are saying. Why are you showing me this if Sherlock doesn’t want me to know about it?”
“You swore to protect Mary.”
Sherlock eyes looked glassy to John. There were small drops of sweat forming on his face and he was pale, ow so pale. John could see how his shoulders were shaking, and he really had to contain himself from stepping forward and hugging the shaking detective.
She did not know what he had done to her. She did not understand yet. But one day she will. And then she will hate him. No matter what he did he could not change the fact that he had a hand in Marys death. Sherlock knew this just too well. He did somehow manage to get John back after Mary’s death  (but only with Marys help of course, or batter said with her CD), but he was not sure he could win Rosies love or even just her forgivnes once she found out the truth. And that send shiwers down his spine.
"She might never be. We need to talk her if we are to solve this case at all," he replied before sitting across from Joan, "Take a seat, Miss Miller."
"And you were also present last night at the bar?"
"Funny that you can so easily read my instincts in a bar full of vampires."
He took her home.
Thank you for reading! As always kudos and nice comments much appreciated. ❤🥰 I hope you enjoyed this chapter
"Yes. And we don't know what this poison is, who's killing vampires, or even why." Sherlock was frustrated, he hated not knowing.
"I hope you have a key. We'll waste valuable time if I have to pick the lock," Sherlock said, his mind racing in a million different directions.
"Of course."
Joan tried to be as calm and gentle as possible but her hands were shaking and it took a bit longer than usual to inject in the IV. She’d been to war and had seen her friends die bloody, she'd operated on a soldier on the battlefield while bombs went off around them but her hands had never shaken. Her old wound whined at her emotional instability and for some reason, it hurt her to see Sherlock like that more than it would hurt to be in his place. She watched his motionless face as the blood poured into his body through the IV.
especially in Sherlock's case as he'd been avoiding feeling in a long time.
"I know, John."
"The knife?"
"Yeah, I suppose you have a point. Do you have any leads yet?" She asked, turning her head to look at him.
So Joan and Sherlock met Venenum. Is that gonna effect what's between them? 🤔 Happy reading!
"What is it, Sherlock?"
Once Joan was ready, she couldn't help smiling at her own reflection in the mirror. As she descended the stairs, she could hear Sherlock playing the violin in the living room. She walked over and saw him standing in front of the living room window, wearing a black suit.
A few minutes later, the Holmes brothers and Joan were out of the Venenum's original hall. As the three of them walked into the corridor, Mycroft offered Joan a polite and formal smile.
"Well they're unique, beautiful and extraordinary."
existence of their kind. Plus, this woman had saved Sherlock's life only two days ago; Wouldn't it be monstrous of him if he didn't at least try to help her?
"Enough for a lifetime, far too much."
Sherlock chuckled dryly; "Neither do I. So I'll get straight to the point then. First things first, you must know that some vampires keep human companions and there's a rule amongst us that prevents vampires from hurting one another's companions. I've been told that companions are considered as a sort of private property."
"And his relationship with your daughter?" Sherlock asked curiously.
"Yes."
Sherlock looked up at Oleander; "I've been helping you for a very long time -because I want to keep our peace as it is- and I understand why you suspect me, but you're wrong. And you're wasting valuable time with the wrong suspect while the real murderer may be killing another one of our kind as we speak. I've brought this matter to you NOW because I'm sure this is the work of a vampire and you have the proper weapons to kill one. If you lose my alliance, this incident may start a war. I'm willing to help you with this issue and I've been trying to do so but we're running out of time."
Then came the guilt. How could she -a doctor- let a wounded man in need of her help walk away in a state like that?
3: self care; The companion isn't allowed to deliberately harm herself in any way.
He shook his head in disagreement."You see but do not observe. The blood tests showed no sign of alcohol or drugs. The bottles were planted by the murderer to distract the police, even if for a short while, an absurd and childish trick to buy themselves a little bit of time to escape."
"I can testify that he had nothing to do with any of these murders."
"Yes, idiots. If they're not always the same thing, then what's the point in beauty?" He put the violin and the bow down in the case, then sipped a few drops from a glass which was next to him on a study table; the glass was filled with... blood!  Joan’s stomach was made of steel by necessity due to her job but just seeing that glass filled with blood made her feel sick so she was forced to tear her eyes away to avoid throwing up.
"A snowflake?"
"This is not a one sided thing, It's a bond and if we have one, I'm one half of it. Don't you think I deserve to know if I'm a part of a supernatural bond or not?"
"That is not the point. The point is that you took my free will. And I think deep down, you know what I mean but you just don't want to talk about it."
"I have asked the companion of the case's last victim to meet me here. I intend to question her and I'd be glad if you could join me."
Suddenly a scream was heard from the dance floor and it drew her attention to itself. She'd been so caught up with Sebastian and this new vampire that she'd lost her focus on the case.
"Most probably."
"And why not?"
"That's strange…" Sherlock whispered thoughtfully. "Our laws don't allow vampires to hurt other companions. Why did he feel like they'd be a threat to you?"
He tried to calm himself down as he returned to the living room.
"Understandable how?"
"I can't trust you like this even if I wan-" She coughed and then sneezed. The cold was getting worse by the minute, her eyelids were heavy and her whole body ached. Her voice had been hoarse too and she was sweating.
Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed this chapter. 🥰🙏🏻
He smiled,"Shall we?"
"Just felt like it." I say with a shrug.
"Because the killer may feel threatened, they may notice that someone is chasing them and become even more violent and hasty. Also, there's not much you can do about this killer. You may have the weapons to take this criminal down, as I have no doubt that this murderer is indeed a vampire, but you're not smart nor fast enough to catch them on time. If you keep me and my brother out of the case, this murderer will have killed half the vampires in town before you can get your hands on them. Do you really want to risk so many lives?"
"What difference would it make? Weather I felt it or not doesn't change anything."
"Interesting," he grinned wider.
As he looked around in confusion, one of the newly dug graves caught his attention. *'Joan Watson'* was carved on the gravestone. He took a few unsure steps towards the grave but he immediately regretted his decision.
Sherlock smiled a little. "I didn't know. I saw. It's not too complicated honestly. Just seeing a few short golden hairs on your shoulder was enough to let me know that you've been holding a small girl. My other deductions only lead me to the assumption that it was your own daughter."
"But I can't go to a party dressed like this. I'll stand out horribly. And I don't have any other clothes than what I'm wearing."
"No, I wouldn't change it for the world. These are so beautiful. Thank you."
"I think we are." She sighed.
"I ordered dinner for you. Should be here in a few minutes," he said casually without even looking up from his microscope. "Oh, by the way, was it Afghanistan or Iraq?" He asked, now abandoning his microscope and picking up a file.
He was tall and pale skinned with black curls but she couldn't waste more time to notice anything further about his physical features.
"Doctor Watson," Mycroft sounded surprised to hear her voice.
"About?"
He turns to look at her."I found a series of texts on his phone. I have a theory but I need you to confirm it, Sophia."
Once he'd finished, he handed the page to her.
"And what is it that you exactly want?"
It was a fine flat; not too big but not too small either. A fireplace, a desk, two armchairs, a sofa and a coffee table made up the whole living room. Antiques could be seen here and there but overall, the owner's personal staff were scattered all over the place, making it look very untidy. One wall was almost completely a huge bookshelf which was filled with a considerable number of various books. A mirror was hung above the lit fireplace and a clock ticked steadily somewhere out of sight. Another wall was contained three large windows.
"What happened to you?" I ask.
"Bit of trouble too, I bet."
"About me." Sophia stepped into sight and stood next to Sherlock. Jackson was shocked but also pleased to see her.
"Don't. You heard me perfectly. You're just buying time to come up with a lie. But after what you've put me through, I deserve honesty. I'm asking again; What. Happened. To. You?"
"How did you-"
"Hmm… is that so? and what exactly makes you think that?"
"Good." He was about to walk out the door but then turned around and shot a final threatening glance at her, “Don’t even think of trying to trick me. Don't play games with me. I'm warning you, it won't work." That being said, he was gone in a heartbeat.
He could see why Joan had become a doctor as he watched the two women shake hands. She had a way of soothing and healing people and he could see that it had already begun to affect Sophia Miller.
"Are you gonna tell me?" He asks.
We each have a plate of his favourite, but anxiety has made me lose my appetite. Angelo smiles at me mysteriously when we leave the restaurant. Afterwards we walk through our favourite spots of the city while we talk and laugh about anything and everything.
Oleander brought up his right hand to stop all four of his men. "Joan Watson. Sherlock Holmes' companion," he muttered, bemused.
"If you already knew that, why did you ask me to look at these?"
Her heart was about to jump out of her chest as she was surrounded by dangerous vampires but no-one even looked at her. It was very strange too because she saw vampires who had more than one companion and some vampires even exchanged their companions with one another to taste the blood of the other companion(s). Seeing all this awakened something inside her, she suddenly wanted to do something rash and save the companions. Fear and anger grew inside her veins; as if they were tiny pieces of ice crawling under her skin and through her entire body.
Joan nodded. "Ok." She gently took it and stood in front of the mirror above the fireplace as she put the necklace on. Her hand stroked it as a way of silently appreciating its beauty.
"You're his companion. The feeling in your gut was your subconscious bond with him, it warns one of you when the other one is in danger. It's an advantage nature grants vampires with companions, a reward of sorts I suppose."
"They know I have a companion now and it would look really suspicious if I show up alone."
"He's a companion," Sherlock stated.
He jolted awake and exhaled in relief when he saw Joan standing safe and sound by his armchair. "Joan..." he breathed out.
"The music," she elaborated.
"I found Sebastian's phone  - it really wasn't too difficult to guess the password- but there was something in it that I thought you two should see."
"Yes. What's wrong with that?" He frowned in confusion. Why would she care? Why would this worry her?
"Oh, God... "
"Shouting is pointless, if you haven't noticed yet. No one will hear you," he said as he walked over to her.
"Look, I'm the only one around here who's putting any effort into seeing this case from your perspective, the only one trying to help you. Talking to me will be in your benefit."
"That is easily got."
"I'll be in touch," Sherlock said with a nod and left the big hall without awaiting a reply.
It was snowing that day.
"What did you see?" Oleander asked.
He noticed a shopping bag on the counter. "What's this?"
Now, after God knows how long he'd been wandering the streets, he was on his way back home. It was late so he expected to find Joan asleep but the lights were still on. He walked steadily up the seventeen steps and saw her sipping a cup of coffee in the kitchen.
Then an idea occurred to her and she searched his pockets for his phone. Luckily, Sherlock had actually set emergency contacts beforehand. 'Mycroft' was the only contact available and as Joan now knew he was Sherlock's brother, she chose to call him instead of an ambulance. She held the phone with trembling hands and dialled the number.
She wanted to talk more about this issue with him but his phone buzzed in Sherlock's pocket and interrupted their conversation. She moved to leave the room but Sherlock motioned her to stay.
"Sherlock has just passed out. I tried to wake him up but I couldn't. His vitals aren’t steady and he's ice cold. I… I really don't know what I'm supposed to do."
"For what?"
"I've examined the bodies myself. At first I thought that this is impossible but it's really true."
Joan really didn't mind dying, to be honest, never have actually but whatever Sherlock had planned for her was far worse than death or torture or imprisonment. To her, death with dignity was much better than becoming… whatever he wanted her to be.
What surprised the DI most was when Sherlock introduced her as his 'colleague and flatmate'."Doctor Watson has been kind enough to help me with a few cases lately," Sherlock introduced her as he sat down.
"So you're saying that someone's killing vampires by poisoning them?"
Joan had gone right back to the flat after the meeting and Sophia was immediately transferred to somewhere safe with her daughter but Sherlock had decided to take a long walk in London's streets to calm his nerves. The meeting with Venenum had gone just as he'd expected. Sherlock knew exactly how dangerous and risky capturing Sebastian would be but he simply had no other choice. A lot of vampires, companions and even ordinary humans could die if he didn't do something to stop Sebastian's violence.
“They plan on waking him up in 10 minutes, and hope that he will be enough in his right mind that they will be able to explain him what is going on and get his consent for the procedure.” Mycroft let out a tied breath and stepped to the chair next to the wall. He let his tired body fall in to the small chair not entirely sure that he will have the energy to stand up again later.
He brought the letter closer to his nose to smell it, making sure to not crush Rosie as he did so.
But good news, the next chapter is already half written so it won't take me this long to post again.
They took me back to their camp and kept me there for about a week. Sebastian –
But John really needed to hear this. It would help him move on and live again. If that meant that John would hate him even more then before so be it. John deserves happiness and Sherlock had no right to stand in the way of that. He promised himself back in Siberia that he would do everything he could to make John happy. And later on Mary asked him to always watch out for John. This was the least he could do now.
He looked around himself to find something with which he could distract Rosie from the letter. He did not want her to destroy some clues. He noticed the rattle on the table next to him and have it to her. Her little fingers closed around it and a big smile grew on her face as she started to shake it. Sherlock put his arm around her as to prevent her from falling of his lap, yet still have the ability to inspect the letter. God damn it! It would be so much easier if he still had two arms! Or at least if they amputated his left and not his dominant hand.
“Maybe you deserve to be caught by him. To be torched again and locked away from everyone. I mean what good did it do that you came back after the fall?” John was now sitting next to him, looking at him with cold eyes. The eyes of a solder.
“No Sherlock that’s not it I- “ John tried to move towards Sherlock. He wanted to look at his wound, treat it, help him but for some reason he did not move an inch.
“Of course its true! You have never in your life cared about anything. I’m sure your mother cried because of you many times. She must have felt sick to herself knowing that she gave birth to such a monster like you –“
“Sherlock … What are you doing? Sherlock … don’t do this, come on let’s talk. Put the gun down.” John’s voice was soft again, but Sherlock could hear it tremble. John chocked down a whine. It was the same as all those years ago when Sherlock was standing at the edge of the hospital roof.
After John managed to convince Sherlock to get checked out by doctors he demanded to be taken home to Baker Street. John tried to talk him out of it but it had no use … Sherlock wanted home.
“After you killed the big bad dragon everything was supposed to be ok, right? And what was I supposed to do in that time? Wait for you like a fucking dog? Face it Sherlock, you’re just a manipulative bastard, just like Moriarty.“ John’s face was like made of stone. Sherlock could not find one kind expression in it, it was as if this wasn’t his John. Like this was just a cheap replica of him.
“Hey Sherlock… Surprise!
“Well, as you know Sherlock hasn’t been doing so well lately. And that’s putting it mild.” Said John and nervesly looked down at his drink. He did not know why but he was extrimly nervus to talk about this to Molly. He didn’t know how much she already knew and if it was even ok for him to talk to her about this but he was at the and of his rope and he needed help. Mycroft could not provide that so he had the right to search for it elsewhere. Right?
“Ow stop it John, it would be my pleasure. And I'm sure Sherlock would do nothing to hurt her” said the (not) housekeeper.
“If you would have done a better job of protecting Mary, she would still have a mother!”
Mycroft was shaking and John could see tears form in the corners of Mycroft’s eyes. This man never shed a tear or displayed any kind of emotion, yet now he was like a child trying to save a little puppy. John stood up from the table and Mycroft almost cried out in desperation.
“Drama queen” thought Sherlock to himself and picked her up.
But he could not end his life just yet. He had to make sure everyone was safe, that after he died everyone would be ok. Plus, Mycroft must be watching him 24/7 now. He knew that people knew that he was suicidal so they were keeping a close eye on him. He was sure that there were at least 3 camaras in his room right now. Even if he did try to kill himself - if people were to find him they would try to safe him again and he did not want that. This time he wanted it to be final. He will convince everyone that he is fine. That he can deal with it all. And when they finally leave him alone – that will be the time that he will end his suffering.
“How the bloody hell did it come to this?” John whined silently and gently kissed Sherlocks hand. He stayed by Sherlocks side the whole night, waiting for Sherlock to wake up. But as the morning came, Sherlock still didn’t wake up, and John knew that something bad was coming.
Suddenly a hand touched his shoulder and John was kneeling down next to him. Mycroft didn’t even notice when the man had stopped pacing up and down the room. Now John was completely calm and focused. The kind doctor extended his hand towards Mycroft in a sign to pass him the phone. The Holmes brother looked at him, gave him a little nod and handed him over the phone. John stood up and went out of the waiting room in to the hallway to talk to the parents. Mike could still hear the doctor talk but he was too tied to pay close attention to the muffed words. He felt as if a heavy burden was lifted off his shoulders, like he could breathe a little easier. But soon another feeling flushed over him, one that he did not feel in a long long time. His vison began to blur and he could swear that something wet slid down his cheek. A soft cry spread thru the room and Mycroft thought that it came from the hallway. Was this his mother crying thru the phone? Could he hear it earlier too? But the crying just grew louder and louder and soon he realized it was his own muffed, broken cry. Tears were streaming down his cheeks and he was shaking. The pressure of the past months, the worry for his brother, his duty to the country – everything came back up and burred him under its weight. He felt as if he could not breath, as if the air had turned to water.
“I said no! No cutting of my arm! Put me into an artificial coma and dissolve the clot part by part.” Sherlock was shaking with rage now. The pain had made him less patient.
“Sherlock, it me. I’m real. No one is chasing you. It’s just you and me. Come on, let me help you. You’re save. Sherlock look at me.” John moved in to the eye line of the detective. “Look at me.”
“It’s ok Sherlock I got you. You’re save now.” John tried to wrap an arm around the shivering detective, but he moved out of his touch.
“Are you sure about this?” Asked Mycroft and the doctor almost at the same time. John looked down at the floor for a brief second before he confidently looked back up again.
“Yes Mrs Hudson. Could you go and take Rosy for a late walk. I have to deal with this child first.” Shouted John back downstairs. Mrs Hudson said something back but Sherlock could not be bothered to listen to it. He just needed a hit ... Maybe cocaine or morphine? Did they find his stash in the wall behind his closet yet? Was he even able to move it now that he was missing an arm?
“I said don’t touch me. I can do it myself. I’m not broken.” Said Sherlock as he struggled to get himself back on his legs. John stared at the man realizing how the detective thought everyone saw him.
“Mycroft are you alright?” John was really concerned for the older Holmes brother. The whole situation with Sherlock must have really left its mark on him. John often forgot that the hatred of the brothers was only one-sided. Mycroft loved his brother, but he always tried to hide that fact – why John did not know. He never really thought about it up till now.
Slowly John shifted his gaze from the old couple to the hospital bed. One could not even see that Sherlock was missing an arm form this perspective. His right side was turned away towards the window, all that one could see from Johns perspective were all the cables and machines to which Sherlock was hooked on. He slowly stepped to the sleeping detective and gently touched his left hand. The hand was cold to touch and so thin you could feel the bones throe the shin. John turned his gaze to where Sherlock right arm should be, but there was nothing but a hospital sheet. It was so surreal. Did this really happen? Did he really instruct to cut off Sherlocks arm?
John also fell because of the push, falling back in to the living room on his ass. The painful shout of the detective pierced his ears and without really thinking he leaped towards Sherlock again. The detective was squeezing his amputated limb as his face became a sweaty and disfigured image of his boney face.
Sherlock did not look at him, but kept looking straight ahead. John waited for a few more seconds before repeating his question.
“I can’t really explain how I know this, but I just do. The thinks he does, the way he does them … It reminds me of me when I came back from the war. The jumpiness, the stiffness in his shoulders, the pain of losing his arm, the trying to convince everything is ok just to be left alone to die. His PTSD is also getting worse by the day. I’ve got a bad feeling Molly, and I need your help with him. He won’t talk to me, he won’t listen to me. But you. You could always make him listen. I know that you studied psychology once before you switched to medicine. Please you have to help him.” He was practically begging her now.
Sherlock almost fell out of his bed at the sudden noise.
“I’m sorry John. I’m so sorry!” Cried the broken detective wraping his arm around the doctor.
He leaned on the first table he saw and scanned the room for a hiding place. Suddenly his legs gave out and he fell to the ground like a sack of potatoes. While going down he hit his head on the table edge. Amazing, not as if he wasn’t in enough pain already. The fall disoriented him for a moment but the sound of someone walking up the stair made him come back to it. He crawled behind an office table and hoped that it managed to cover most of him.
“Then put me in to an artificial coma! That way my body can regenerate itself.” Sherlock was breathing fest and deep now. They needed to wrap this conversation up fast or it would not end well for the Detective.
He tried to enjoy the time with his little angel but his mind slipped to Sherlock again. He could hear how he was taking out the mug for his tea and cursing as he had to put everything out of the cabinet, just to be able to reach it.
The detective looked at the little girl with a blank look, getting slowly lost in all the voices that started to ring around him.
It was 2 P.M. the next time John looked up on the clock. He just spent the last two hours sitting is his chair, crying his eyes out over a man that he thought he hated.
“God Mycroft, I thought we went over this. We have to-“John tried again but Mycroft cut him off.
“I think he wants to kill himself again. JW” the text was short but down to the point. He knew it would freak Mycroft out, but he needed his immediate attention.
Shortly after that the door to the room opened and Sherlock held his breath. If he were to be found now he had no chance of escaping he was too weak for that. One footstep, two footsteps, stop, another footstep and the sound of the door opening again.
Hello!
“He is not himself. He is trying to convince me that he is fine but he is not. He is distant, barely talks and is not eating. It’s like he is in his own world.  JW”
The sweat was still dripping down his skin and his shirt was drenched. He decided to take his shirt off… it was all wet from the sweat either way and there was even some blood on it from his broken nose. He threw it on the ground and covered his missing arm with the bed covers. He still could not bear to look at it.
“Lestrade?”
Age: 6 Suicide attempt no. 2 &3 –Took mothers sleeping pills. One week later jumped out the window in the second floor. I found him both times. Ambulance was called both times. They think it was an accident. I know it wasn’t - Letter found. Content: “Solution to problem found” “
“What the f-“
“Already on my way. I’ll be there in 20. Thank you, Molly”
“I would appreciate it if you would not interfere like that in to my job. Yes, I’m young but I was trained for this. I worked hard for this. You do not have any authority here. If this happens again I will have you removed from here. Did I make myself clear?” Without even waiting for an answer the doctor turned on his heels and walked out the room.
Mrs Hudson was looking at him with kind eyes and a faint smile. She knew what he meant even thought in her eyes John was still a good man, no matter what he said or did. But she understood and so she said nothing. She just gave a little nod and squeezed his shoulder a bit before turning around and going down to her apartment.
He swung open the door, already asking Sherlock why he didn’t pick up the phone when he saw a scene of utter beauty.
Now that John thought about it he himself noticed that sometimes Sherlock would be very careful about his right arm. Sometime when he thought no one was watching he would squeeze his lower arm as if he was in terrible pain. Now if that was true than maybe that’s the reason why he started to use morphine, for it would dull the pain. That’s when John remember something else. He started to panicky search thru the pile of papers until he finally found the MRI pictures. He looked at them closely and then he noticed it. A small little dote in Sherlock right arm. It was so small you could barely see it but it was there and it was the reason for Sherlocks pain.
“The 30
“I’m sorry mister Homes, I just wanted to help a nurse with a gone rouge patient and that was when he stormed out the room. He was running so fast I could not get a hold of him. And then I lost him somewhere on the ground floor. We locked the hospital down but he still somehow managed to slip out.”
Just like Mary…
Yes, that was the plan. In three weeks he would take his life. This time it shall be final.
“It seems that you have all the answers that you want in that file of yours. I think ..- I think I will go to bed now. I don’t feel that well. I need to -“ but just as Sherlock was about to stand up John reached for his hand and looked him in the eyes.
John bumps their shoulders together once, “Too bad, I was thinking I could start a fan club.”
Sherlock looks puzzled for a moment, and John inhales deeply before continuing.
John fights to finds the words that can express everything that's happening inside his head right now, and only manages to say, "I want to give you everything, Sherlock Holmes."
This Sherlock is in love.
"I haven't had the time," Sherlock says, eyes fixed on Matthew's tie.
All of it.
It will be.
John tries not to think of everything they’d talked about, and swallows around the lump in his throat, "Earlier?"
“How do you feel most comfortable?”, John asked as he reached for the lube, gently running his hand across Sherlock’s abdomen. As much as he liked to push the other further into the grips of pleasure, he felt like they both needed just a moment to calm down again.
“Are you seriously telling me that this airport can’t managed to let any aeroplane take off?” äSherlock almost yelled as soon as the woman looked up, “Do you know that there are countries where it snows most of the year and I don’t see them cancelling all of their fli-”
XX67: I… Yes.
"Hi," John breathes, a smile on his lips.
You said at the end of your letter that you want us not to be afraid, but the truth is that I am. Just writing this letter is scaring me to no end. I am not allowed to ruin what we’re slowly building. I can’t be the source of what goes wrong or else I would never forgive myself. I can’t let my inexperience get in the way, can’t let my fear of what’s all yet to come be in the way. But at the same time, I can’t remain silent. I can’t do that to you. You deserve to know, deserve to be trusted with these feelings I can’t seem to be able to control. You opened yourself up to me, bared your thoughts and left nothing to hide. How could I not do the same?
“Good luck, baby brother,” Harriet says, winking as she goes inside.
“I’m taking care of that,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock wants to say.

“Promise me, Dad,” Rosie asks again.
He checks the time, 22:19. Another sigh. They should be at desert by now, no? That means less than a hour away from coming home. He can wait a hour. Right? Rolling to his side, he stares at Sherlock’s pillow, giving in to the urge of bringing it closer. He had woken up sleeping on it the very first night they share and it was already the last. And Sherlock wasn’t even there.
John can feel it building, low in his abdomen, warm and dangerous. With every movements, every glances, it keeps on growing, taking all of his breath away. The fact that Sherlock isn’t even trying to hide it makes the whole dance more and more thrilling. Anyone watching them would know, without a single doubt, what is happening. Actually, John is pretty sure Greg got the message already, considering his wink earlier and the discret thumb up. John had laughed, shaking his head but actually finding it harder to breathe properly.
Sherlock shrugs, sitting back against his chair.
“Victor needs to have a solid case to present his associates,” Sherlock explains. “That means we need to be very detailed since they’re obviously idiots.”
: 10:34
Sherlock moans, pushing against his cock, “Please.”
09:34
There was an audible huff which John took as affirmation.
I know. But I’d rather
She has most of Mary’s features, but all behaviour, she takes from John. That’s for the best, I think. We never talked about it (we barely talk anymore) but John never mentions Mary to her, or at least not when I’m with them. Is he trying to avoid the subject because of me? Does he still resent me? Is it why he’s drifting away?
I wish I didn’t too, but
Sherlock looks at him, "She seems to believe, and apparently for some time now, that Rosie, you and I are a family."
John laughs, following Sherlock’s stare to the dog, “Can I come with you?”
"John," Sherlock pants, shifting closer and, fuck, that feels amazing.
Sherlock wants to tell him this is ridiculous, that he has no doubt he’s going to be a gentle, soft, caring lover and that he hasn’t trusted anyone like this before, but he finds himself unable to open his mouth. John doesn’t need to hear any of this, he realises as he watches the concerned lines around his eyes, but something else entirely.
Yeah?
“Brilliant,” John smiles, kissing him once more. “Absolutely brilliant.”
He takes long enough doing so, taking the time to remember what he just told himself minutes ago. Victor is talking - again - in the living room, and John only understands bribes of a college story here and there. He gets out only when the doorbell rings, hoping to get an excuse to leave, but Sherlock is already looking for his wallet and going out.
“No. Later?”
there very soon.
"I told you, I don't have time for this," Sherlock says, now walking back to the living room in a hurry.
“Small talk,” Sherlock asked, “really?”
“Dearly beloved…”
I'm going on vacation next week so I probably won't be able to update every day. I'll try my best, but no promises...
“You know Stamford?” Sherlock asks in return, surprised.
* * *
"John?" He hears outside the door, almost hesitant.
John shrugs, "I know."
“I guess I’m going to need something to do too,” John sighs, looking up at the sky for a second. “I’m tired of the clinic, and besides, I’m sure the closest one is a long way from here.”
XX32: Sherlock, I’d pack and come right now if I could. But that would be rushing into something I haven’t quite wrap my head around yet. I really, really don’t want to mess it all up by going too fast.
Further Internet researches turned out unproductive, as expected. There is no such thing as parallel universes. No such thing.
: (no subject)
"All the time you kept it all inside," Sherlock says, feeling desperate for more, more, more.
Sherlock watches in awe as John’s entire body shiver with pleasure when he presses his own thigh to his pelvis. The heat radiating from John’s lower body, from the erect shape of his cock trapped in his pants, makes Sherlock want to ravish him. He shifts ever closer, if possible, and soon their faces are only inches apart. Staring down at John’s lips, Sherlock feels himself grow harder. But he looks down, focusing on all the point of contact between their bodies. Another sharp thrust of John’s thigh makes him gasp, and he pushes himself harder against John.
Rosie bursts out laughing just as Sherlock finally joins them, walking all the way to the sink without meeting his eyes, and John has to stop himself from staring too much. He can't be the one to give them away when Sherlock is so obviously trying to keep it all a secret for now. After all, they haven't even discussed everything yet, Christ, they haven't even kissed.
you, face to face.
If that’s alright with you
He decides to walk back home just as the front door opens, “Sherlock?”
“You should go to bed.”
“That wasn’t there last time,” he says, falling back into his previous position.
"Do you really think I would let Sherlock live with him if I wasn't?" Mycroft asks, not giving him the time to say anything else before hanging up and John lets his head fall backward, tears of frustration pearling at his eyes.
Sherlock feels his own lips curl into a smile, “She did?”
2) Ella would have probably loved to hear this one, and yet I’ve never managed to get it out, but I’m going to try. I, and it really shouldn’t be so bloody hard to say, always felt romantic/sexual attraction to both women and men. Even when I was just a kid, playing at school and pretending to get married to my best friend, Pierre. We didn’t care, not the slightest, and when his big brother told us boys are supposed to love and get married to girls, it only striked me as very unfair. Pierre grew out of it, probably, but I didn’t. I kissed girls in middle school but dreamt of holding hands with this boy in my math class every night. It’s not that I didn’t like kissing girls - I enjoyed it a lot, in fact, but when I finally kissed Mark Steven in High School, I realised kissing boys was just as enjoyable, maybe even a bit more so. And, Christ, enjoy kissing him I did. Still now, those are some of my most cherished memories, hidden in the back of the rugby field, hands daring to explore the other’s body freely. And yet, I continued to date women in public, cutting all relations with Mark and boys after graduation and focusing on women only. At least… At least until the army. Maybe this should be another number on this list, but let’s just say the army turned out to be much more open than I had imagined. I kissed and held and touched men, letting myself discover this part of my sexuality that I’d always feared. And then I was back home, back to women, dating and even marrying one. If I were to be completely honest (that being the purpose of this letter in fact) I’d say that I’ve always prefered being with men, but felt more comfortable being out with women. It doesn’t take your genius mind to know what it means…
So much more.
"There was a time you wouldn't have bothered to call back," Mycroft counters.
You’re no fun.
Sherlock doesn't reply, doesn't trust himself to say anything really, and for another long minute, they both remain silent. Trying to regulate his breathing, Sherlock focuses back on the feeling of John's hand in his, on the sound of his laughter earlier, and the certainty that he'll find him waiting back home.
“Don’t be cocky,” John replies, leaning back and sighing a bit louder. “It looks like we’re gonna have to spend the night without heating.”
“Of course”, John smiled and composed himself back into parade’s rest, “Do what you need to do and tell me when you actually need muscular help.”
Without a doubt, John knows it won’t take long for either of them to fall over the edge. Gently, he pushes Sherlock down on his back, settling between his legs above him. Sherlock’s entire body arches on the mattress, head thrown back at the added pressure. John leans back in, kissing the offered neck and resuming his thrusts, each one more desperate than the other. Sherlock is soon shaking from head to toe, eyes open wide and fixed on his, and John knows he’s there, right there.
Closing his eyes again, he tries his best to go through each minute of the evening they just shared, storing each and every detail in his Mind Palace, going from room to room and putting all of John’s smiles and laughter in boxes, just in case. He makes sure not to forget John’s quiet moan when he had tasted the sauce Sherlock had agreed to make to help him, and he remains in that room for a long moment, playing that very sound over and over again.
me when we’d stop by
"Yes," Sherlock replies, smiling widely. "You made it quite clear it isn't anyway."
“Another fan of mine?” John asks teasingly, and Sherlock rolls his eyes.
Sherlock,
“A list?”
“Thank you for the tea,” Sherlock smiles, or at least try to, standing up.
Let’s begin by putting it out there: I have never experienced sex. Never bothered to try or, more accurately, never believed I’d found someone interesting enough to be willing to try with. I’ve grown up hearing about sex at school all the time, boys my age never shutting up about it despite never having had any. It became even worse once they were old enough to do so. But by then, I had stopped listening entirely. I didn’t care, not in the slightest. I wasn’t interested in people, so why would I wonder about something that requires being intimate with someone else. I understood the logistics of it all, what goes where and the purpose, but it never appealed to me. Or at least, until I heard about… other types of sexual relations. Men having sex with other men. All of a sudden, I found myself wanting to know more, not yet exploring, but being more aware of it all. So I did what I always do, I researched it, and the results were both scary and strangely never enough. So yes, there was a time where I almost tried, just to get it out of the way, to know for myself and never wonder again, but I never acted on it. Never did what had to be done to find someone, and then it felt like it was too late. I had missed my chance and, in complete honesty, I felt like it was something I just wasn’t meant to experience, and I was fine with it. For a while, at least.
"What is it?" John sighs, having learn to be careful when both Sherlock and Rosie seem way too content with themselves. "I thought this was just a simple restaurant."
“No, thank you.”
XX32: No, that’s not what- Christ, this is not what I called you for.
out of there?
Tomorrow, yes. I’ll
“And the second one?”
“I was worried sick!”
This other me, he knows the exact taste of your lips. He must know the exact taste of every inch of your body. God knows I would have learnt each curve, each sharp angle by heart if I could have you in my bed. Christ. I thought I could move past this, that the distance would help, but of course something like this has to happen!
What about what you want, then?
“Oh,” John breathes, looking down at his tea. “You were just… in the neighborhood.”
“I refuse to think we can’t,” Sherlock replies. John is almost close enough for their breath to mix between them. “Yesterday, a week ago, a month ago, that’s when I thought that maybe I should give up. That maybe time had finally caught up to us, and that it was too late to do anything about it. That we would share a home but never a bed, and I was ready to accept it because it meant that I would still grow old with you and get to share a lifetime with you.” He shifts closer, brings John’s forehead to his. “But you kissed me.”
“Everything. Afghanistan, London, my lack of excitement?”
XX32: …
"John!" John pulls his finger almost all the way out, giving Sherlock the time to adjust to the sensation. "That..." He pants, hands clenching the sheets. "You..."
XX67: Angelo’s?
The first time John wakes up, it’s still the middle of the night. The moon is casting a faint light in the bedroom, and John’s eyes meet Sherlock’s, staring back at him. They don’t say a word, their breathing filling the air. And when Sherlock slowly rolls onto his back, one hand closed around John’s arm, John goes willingly, falling back on top of him. In the end, Sherlock gets to experience only kisses and friction, their moans dying in each others mouths and the feeling of
Sherlock is already on his way to the bathroom, stopping, “Oh. I forgot.”
John rolls his eyes, remembering a very similar gesture from Greg at his birthday. It had all seemed very close then, the promise of more hanging in the air, and now a whole week had passed, filled with chases and arguing and criminals trying to take both of their life. John is afraid this could mean they’ve missed their chance, that it is going to take another month, or two to get there. He doesn’t want to wait this long again, doesn’t want to pretend they weren’t going to kiss at that party.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmurs, blushing again but apparently not caring about it anymore. “Better.”
“Yes.”
anymore, but are you
John takes the time to digest the information, asking, “Why?”
“You’ve been so impatient the whole time.” John growled, pulling Sherlock so he was sitting squarely on his lap, “Now you can show me how prettily you can fuck yourself.” In contrast to his words, he was already planting his feet on the mattress because this was only thought as an illusion of control for Sherlock. “Go on, you wanted more. Take it.”
“I need a shower,” John says, knowing all too well when to walk away from his own anger. “And a coffee for that matter.”
“With any luck, yes.” John grinned and stalked back towards the bed. “God, you are a sight to behold.” He put down the condom and lube on the side table before practically attacking Sherlock’s nipples with his lips. It wasn’t the most comfortable position, bend over the bed, but he didn’t much care at the moment. His hand grabbed Sherlock’s and with their fingers entwined he first let it wander down the other’s body, coming tantalisingly close to the straining erection before picking their joined hands up and placing them on his own chest.
“John.” He called as he approached, John looking up without letting go of Marks.
Remembering how to breathe, Sherlock inhales sharply, “I was…” They stare at each other, words dying in Sherlock’s throat, “I…”
The hand in his shirt tightens, and John brings their bodies closer.
“Right over there,” Sherlock says, pointing towards their left, “is where I used to come when I was a teenager.”
XX32: So you just expect me to believe you got a letter, no wait, TWO letters from another Sherlock in some other universe. (
"Christ, Sherlock, yes," John moans.
_________________________________________________________________________
“Over there,” Quentin says, pointing to a door down the hallway.
hears me," he exclaims, one fist hitting the counter. He runs a hand through his hair, focusing on his breathing and trying to regulate his pounding heart. "Is this for a case?"
He catches sight of a pirate and a cowboy exchanging whispers in each other’s ears quickly, and he orders a glass of water without looking away. He needs to remain focused, and alcohol isn't an option, no matter how tempting. He tries to guess what Sherlock might be saying now that they aren't glued together anymore, and it doesn't take a genius to guess he's deducing the three men sitting not far away. He watches as Matthew laughs, and laughs some more while Sherlock smiles at him, and John freezes. He knows that smile, has seen that smile before, has once said that he could tell Sherlock wasn't a machine just because of
. The agonizing months he spent living alone when John still lived in his old flat had seemed endless, the thought of storming in and all but kidnap the man had crossed Sherlock’s mind more than a couple of times. But in the end, John had simple moved back, bringing back with him old jumper, soft smiles and a brand new list of possibilities.
, Sherlock needs more. Rutting just a little faster against John, he forces himself to open his eyes again, and this time he doesn’t look away. John’s hand slides from his neck to his hair, holding on to his curls and panting directly against his mouth. It now feels a thousand times more powerful, John’s entire focus on him as their bodies act on their own volition, seeking pleasure from the other without shame. And Sherlock loves him, loves him, loves him.
“Do you really think I don’t care? Do you really think I hate you that much?”
“Here you are again Sherlock. Lying on the ground like the trash you are.” Sherlock looked to his left, seeing the man laying on the ground next to him.
“Go to hell Sherlock. Go and this time - don’t come back!” The knife came speeding at him again with Johns eyes looking cold as ice. Sherlock tried to move away but he was frozen. There was nothing he could but wait for the person who he once trusted most to deliver the final blow.
“Yes of course. But I’m afraid that he will sleep for the next couple of hours. The surgery was hard on his body and because of the nature of the whole situation (him not really knowing that we amputated his arm) we put him on strong sedatives.” Mycroft just nodded and followed the doctor out the room.
“Mycroft? Honey, what is it? Is Sherlock ok?” there was panic in her voice now. Mycroft could see her starting to shake and father stepping closer to her, trying to somehow calm her.
“Sherlock, we need to cut your arm off. It’s the only way to-“
“No- no that’s not true, I’m nothing like Moriarty. Everything that I did I did to protect-“ Sherlock was stuttering. He never stuttered.
“Age: 36 Suicide attempt no.34: He hung himself. Was saved by a spy that I had him watched. Heart stopped – was able to revive after 2 minutes. Ambulance was not called. Was taken to my house. Stayed 3 days – managed to run away. Letter found. Content of it: “
“Listen Sherlock I need to go meet someone. I will be gone for about an hour. Is that ok with you?”
“Everything you touch dies, Sherlock. Face it, you are the problem – always have been” The voice started to lough again making Sherlock scream and beg for it to stop. But the voice grew only louder and louder making Sherlock cover his ears and closing his eyes shut in an attempt to escape this torture.
John did not hear when the door downstairs opened or when a pair of little feet slowly made their way up the old stairs. He just felt two little hands touching his back as he was still in the living room on his knees, sobbing over Sherlocks words.
John gave him a smile and walked out of the café. He called a taxi and went home. As soon as he came home he opened the file and started reading. His eyes got immediately caught by the title of the first page. He read it multiple times… not believing it really being written there. The title was “SUICIDE ATTEMPTS”
“Jesus, Sherlock. How long did they have you captive?”
he thought to himself.
Everyone in the room was holding their breath. No one dared to say anything. Mycroft slowly backed out the room to get the doctor but otherwise everything was still. After what felt like forever Sherlock took a deep breath and then looked at John.
“What do you mean he ran away? You were supposed to be there to prevent this from happening!”
“John, is everything ok? What did Sherlock say to you? I swear I will strangle this boy one day! How can he be so rude, when all you want is to help! If it were not for you –“
PS: Just so you know... its 3 in the morning in my home country. i start editing at like 1 in the afternoon. I don't know what took me so long. I'm stupid :D
“Ow shut up would you …”
“I swear to god if you ask me this one more time I will scream.” The detective rolled his eyes as he said this but he could not help but get a bit worried.
As Sherlock opened his bedroom door he could hear a faint little voice that belonged to John saying:
He tapped on the phone screen and looked at the hour. “Twenty past midnight … mommy is probably asleep. But I promised her …I swore… god damn it!” He whispered to himself. He nervously tapped his leg on the floor, cleared his throat and then tipped in mommies’ phone number. He slowly pulled the phone to his ear. The ringing was echoing in his head and he could swear that it was ringing for more than an hour. Suddenly the ringing was interrupted and Mycroft recognized the sweet sound of his mother.
"I want to help." she blurted out suddenly.
"Oh, I never know if it's beautiful or not. Only if it's right."
The next day; she woke up around noon, feeling even worse than yesterday. She had been sleeping for a long while but now she was running a fever and it made her restless.
"Is that usual?" Joan asked, now looking at Sherlock.
"No need to worry about that." Another member of Venenum spoke up as she stepped forward. Sherlock knew her as well. "He's already been taken care of." She was a brunette woman, wearing a white shirt and a black skirt.
"But it doesn't make sense. Doesn't that mean that your family is-?"
"No! This is supremely serious, Sherlock. According to your companion, you haven't fed in over a week."
"Tough. I don't want to be locked down in a vampire's flat but here we are."
"Oh don't bother. I'm a quick reader. Photographic memory is handy sometimes."
"Try and remember she's mourning, and that more people might die."
"You care about how she feels?" He frowned.
"I can't see any sign of struggle on the body. No wounds either. She passed out, probably choked on her own vomit. Could have been alcohol or drugs. I see a few half-empty bottles of alcoholic drinks on the table in the photos so that's my best guess based on just a few photos."
After a minute, her pupils widened in shock. "Oh! He's a vampire..."
"One of the only five weapons on earth that can kill a vampire," he explained, "YOU had those weapons sealed away to guarantee the safety of our kind but my attacker had the knife. So evidently someone's got access to these weapons without your knowledge," he said in an accusing tone.
Hi! I'm back with a new chapter! This is actually where things really start to get interesting. 🙈 kudos and comments much appreciated. I want to hear what you all think! Hope you enjoy reading my fic 🥰
He shrugged, "Well, the window is already locked and too high up to reach. I'll handcuff you to that bed and then lock the door from the outside. I don't think it will be very comfortable for you to sleep like that though." He paused but received no answer. "So? What is it going to be?"
"What are we looking for?" Shes asked him, once they'd stepped inside.
"It doesn't bother me too much so I don't mind," he shrugged. They both refocused on the photos. Joan was wondering what she was to do with the photos but Sherlock already knew that so he continued; "You've been in the army and you're a doctor. What do you do first when you find a dead body?"
"But?" His grin was still there.
Joan sat down (or rather sank down) into a nearby chair, trying to progress all of it. She used to believe that vampires were fictional creatures and don't exist in the real world but now here she was, in the grasp of an actual vampire. What she knew and believed to be true was at war inside her own head with what was happening in front of her eyes. All of this was just too much to take in.
"Why's he so-?"
"Are you going to make any more trouble?" He asked, looking at her. Unlike Joan who was looking around the room, he was merely leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes scrutinizing her suspiciously.
He nodded. "While I can."
John got up and got a bouquet of blue roses. " I saw these and they reminded me of you."
Sherlock sighed, it couldn't be helped now; "...for my companion. I didn't know I had one at that point though."
*'Wrist? No, that'll take too long. Neck is a much easier target.'* She thought to herself.
Neither Mycroft nor Venenum were pleased with Joan's wish to speak to Sebastian for safety reasons but as she'd been told, a luxurious black Jaguar XKL took her to Sherrinford, which according to Mycroft, was a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what's inside it, especially vicious vampires.
"Perfectly sounds analysis but I was hoping you'd go deeper," he said, intrigued and impatient.
"It's quite alright. This is detective inspector Lestrade."
Joan was right and they both knew it. There was no one else to put an end to these murders. Even if there was, Moriarty would kill them before they could do anything. Besides, Sherlock knew that he couldn't avoid feeding on Joan forever, she was his companion after all; it was inevitable… sooner or later it was bound to happen, one way or another. All he was able to do was to try and control himself the best he possibly could.
"Like I said, I know that you won't hurt me. I'm your companion so this is the main reason I'm in your flat in the first place. I wouldn't accept being your companion or the contract if I didn't trust you. Plus, this is beyond just the two of us now; is it not? If you don't stop Moriarty, how many will die then? Because I know if you don't put an end to these murders now, no one else can. And if you confront Moriarty in this state, he and his people will kill you and afterwards they'll be unstoppable."
"Oh, they can but this is extremely rare. He's the only one I've seen with my own eyes so far. I have solid reasons to believe he's the only one alive."
"I know and I never meant for you to find out. I ran away when you tried to call an ambulance so that you'd remain oblivious but our intentions don't change anything," a pause, "Now, your turn. Why do you want to know all this?"
"A deal?"
And for what?
2: The companion will have all her stuff returned to her and will be able to go back to her work.
Joan had her doubts about the contract at first, but it actually made everything easier - except for having to make up an excuse for her absence at work to her boss (flu and a broken phone- which couldn't be considered a complete lie really) - she didn't have much difficulty. Sherlock had returned her handbag and he'd had her stuff brought over from her flat alongside anything else that she might need. She had to clear the fridge to make space for human food in it (and to limit the blood bags to one of the drawers) and she also had to make Sherlock put his books and papers -which were scattered everywhere in the flat- into at least some form of order but none of these changes felt unpleasant to either of them.
Sophia nodded and they both started looking around. She was obviously overwhelmed with emotions and memories but he decided to leave her be. She was entitled to be emotional after all.
"I told you not to try and trick me but you didn't listen. You tried to escape and this is how you'll pay for your disobedience. Plus, you asked to help with this case so you'll have to take the risks that come with it," he replied coldly and walked to his bedroom.
"Joan -you need to understand that in order to maintain peace, both humans and vampires sacrificed a lot. Vampires stopped killing humans, stopped feeding in public and stopped taking companions by force. And as you know, a few humans agreed to be companions. Every and each companion is here because they choose to be here. You can't change free will, no one can, not anymore."
"I don't frighten you," Mycroft stated, thoughtfully.
He inhaled deeply (another attempt to calm himself) but still kept eye contact; "What you did will not be forgotten. And make no mistake, I am not the forgiving type. This is far from over. Don't think for one second that you won't pay for your disobedience today," He said firmly and still evidently angrily but then he took a deep breath again and paused for a moment before he continued, "but you're obviously not in a fit state right now and neither am I. Go upstairs and rest before you make the cold even worse than it already is. We'll talk about everything later."
"Ok... what am I looking at? A murder?"
Joan was already halfway home when she heard a loud scream. It wasn't really difficult to find the source; a young man was lying on the ground and squirming in pain. Joan didn't think twice before rushing over to him, her medical instincts had immediately taken over her. Once she was by his side, she could see that his white shirt and both of his hands (which were trying to apply at least some amount of pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding but failing horribly at doing so) were tainted with his own blood which was pouring out of a wound to the left side of his abdomen.
So Joan's having a cold (given the circumstances of the first chapter, it's not surprising 😁) what will Sherlock do? What's awaiting them?
"There was nothing else I could do to stop it. I can only slow it down a bit."
Silence fell on the room as the two detectives stared at each other. "Yes, I do. God help me," Lestrade sighed and rubbed his forehead in desperation.
"I have very important news," Sherlock announced.
A couple of days later, It was seven P.M when Joan felt well enough to finally leave the bedroom and descend the stairs.
It was already too late, he was quite dead.
"Do catch up, John. I've been in love with you for so long, I don't remember a time when I wasn't."
"And help."
A pause... "I've disappointed you."
He copied the paper so that each of them would have one. Joan signed the papers first and then Sherlock did the same.
"But why would they ask Benjamin for
"There is no going backing away from this, Joan. Are you absolutely sure? One hundred percent?"
"I'm grateful for your honesty."
"I don't know why you insisted on coming here in this weather," he says, a bit annoyed, but I know he secretly loves this place.
I hate myself for not stopping him. I hate HIM for leaving me behind... all alone. I hate the world for all the dirt they threw at the most extraordinary man I've ever known.
"With multiple vampire murders going on, I don't think this is really a good time for such a conversation." He moved to walk away but Joan blocked his way out of the kitchen.
Joan, on the other hand, remembered every single detail. How he'd held up her wrist and inhaled. Then his eyes had turned red and she'd seen his fangs come out for the second time. They were sharp, pointy and long. He bit her wrist gently but effectively and she could feel his lips wrap around the wound and suck the blood that was pouring out of it.
"You don't like small talk," he grinned.
London is full of art, history and centuries-old secrets. The human citizens of this mysterious city often tend to automatically assume that vampires are fictional creatures, made up for fantasy novels and TV shows for the sole purpose of their entertainment...
The memory came back to her mind almost immediately. "No, I didn't. You just walked away. You didn't even let me call an ambulance."
"Of course. You are my brother's companion," Mycroft nodded at Sherlock who nodded back,"I'll be in touch," he said as he walked away towards his black expensive car which was waiting for him outside the building.
"Look. I don't know much about companions and bonds. I don't know how it's supposed to be, how it works. I'd never cared about it. But I can tell you one thing."
"I'll see what I can find out. In the meantime, keep this between the two of us," he said in warning.
"What?"
"Thirst makes vampires weak but also mad; it's one of the reasons for the war that had existed before the peace arrangement between our two species. They lose control and they don't really know what they're doing. It's just instinct and reflex, not actions based on thought. When they feed, things change... heighten. They still have control but they tend to act more like a savage animal. They see themselves as superior, common sense and emotions are lost to them to a great extent. They see humans as blood bags, slaves and nothing more. This is when they most tend to go too far and get out of line."
"Are you alright?" Joan asked, meeting his gaze while holding her own left wrist as he pulled away.
silence.
The minute John finds himself outside 221b, he feels regret pour down his body like the rain. He's exhausted but he knows he has to do this and now or else, he will never be able to look into a mirror again without shame.
How could any of this be real? The fresh crimson blood on her trembling hands was the only valid reminder that this incident had actually happened and that it wasn't some creepy, twisted production of her own mind.
"What can you tell us about that night at the bar?" Sherlock asked thoughtfully.
"Look, We need to have this conversation, Sherlock. It's very serious."
"What is this?"
"I understand how difficult this situation is for you and it means so much to me that you agreed to this," she smiled.
"That's beautiful," she descended the last couple of stairs as the song came to an end.
"Why are you asking this of me?"
"I know. And I know you went through hell to protect me. You have the scars to prove it."
"Not exactly. I'm just saying it's probable, that there's a good chance which we must consider. Nothing less, nothing more."
"Well, I think secrets break trust just as much as lies do."
Neither of them was gonna give up easily but Sherlock turned out to be at least twice as strong as his opponent. "SHE'S MY COMPANION! MINE!" He growled as his hands tightened their grip on the other vampire's throat. Sherlock didn't know why his mind had chosen those words. It was a slip of the tongue, but it had come out so naturally, like a long-held truth finally being given a voice. He was so blinded with rage that he doesn't really remember what happened next, but his anger seemed sufficient to set the other vampire running off at full speed once he saw the first opportunity to escape.
"I trust you, Sherlock. As you said, we've been working together for a very long time now. Find whoever is doing this. Bring them to us. Justice will be done and the peace will be restored. This is no joke," Oleander said cautiously.
"Yes! I felt so low, so alone after you left me that I attempted to kill myself and the baby I was carrying," she said with a sad tone. Sherlock remained silent, not knowing what to say. Jackson's expression spoke plenty; shock, sadness and pain all at once. "You know who stopped me? Who gave me shelter when I had no one else to go to? Who was by my side while I was in labour? Who willingly did everything a dad is supposed to do for my baby while you… her biological father were neglecting your duties to her? Who stopped her from crying the nights I was too exhausted to do it? It was Benjamin. I wanted it to be you, I desperately wanted… no, I NEEDED you by my side, I really did but you were gone and you didn't look back, not even once."
"No."
Pointing towards Joan, he said," And this is-"
"Will caring about these people help save them?"
"She was a companion too. I was sympathising with her."
"I am angry - no, I am furious but it doesn't mean that I will kill you. Although, I admit that I underestimated your desire to break free."
"Oh; so some of the stories are true," she said with a smile.
"Do you know him?" She asked, turning her gaze back at Sherlock.
"I had no idea. I wish I had known about it sooner. I don't even know if he knows about all this,” she looked towards Sherlock's unconscious figure.
"Yes. Which is exactly why you shouldn't be there."
Joan wakes up in Sherlock's flat and she has some questions. Let's see what happens. Kudos and comments much appreciated as always ❤ Hope you enjoy and happy reading!
Sherlock nods silently, he understands that John needs this.
but then something caught her eye: an empty glass on a wooden coffee table…
"Now and then, yes." He grinned.
"Sherlock? Sherlock?!"
"Then you’re not going to be much use to her."
"Sherlock?" She picked up.
He chuckled; "Fair enough. Vampires live much longer than humans do but make no mistake, it doesn't mean that we're immortal. We can be killed, if someone truly sets their mind to do it and tries hard enough. However, I can't tell you how I received that wound. As to how I survived it, vampires heal pretty fast. And also because of your timely interruption, my wound wasn't deep enough to kill me or to cause me any lasting damage."
She removed the bloody piece of cloth from her wrist before entering the bathroom, her wound had healed nicely. She found some clean towels in the bathroom so she tried to focus on relaxing and enjoying the shower she'd longed for since she'd stepped into this flat.
But the reality of it all downed on her pretty quickly.
"That's obvious, surely. We find him and stop this madness," Oleander looked at Joan.
"If you were ruthless and brutal, I would have been dead by now; wouldn't I?"
"No. I'm coming with you," She shook her head.
"I understand. I really do. And Sherlock will find this murderer. You just spend time with your daughter until this whole thing is solved. Ok?"
"Sherlock?"
"But you're a vampire. Don't the corpses... the blood-"
It had been a very long, stressful and exhausting day for her; she'd been puked on twice by her patients and had gotten blood all over her uniform three times in less than twelve hours. She lived close by and a short walk always helped to relax her so she often took a walk back home instead of taking a cab, unless she was in a hurry or the weather was exceptionally terrible. At that moment, she just wanted to go home, eat some takeaway and then catch a few hours of sleep before she had to return to work the next morning.
"It's rare. Most vampires wouldn't like it but it's a matter of choice," Sherlock replied, confirming her assumption.
She walked over to him and began with a gentle but certain tone."You're not what I find intolerable, Sherlock. What I can't bear is being locked down in a flat  and being deprived of my freedom and my ability to choose how to live."
"You got Benjamin killed; that's what Sherlock is going on about. He was smart, he'd managed to hide but you gave him away. Me and Benjamin were never together. I concealed his identity, lies to you to keep you and him from harm's way but you got the man who protected me and your baby for years killed. You found out what Benjamin was but you couldn't put together that I was a companion?"
"I'm done with this conversation," She got up and left the room.
"Yes."
Joan spent the first few minutes of being alone in the flat searching for a way out. She'd started to feel the symptoms of coming down with a cold since she'd woken up in the morning but it was getting worse by the second and by now had become impossible to ignore. She kept searching for as long as she possibly could but she hadn't eaten anything since yesterday so she was getting physically weak and drained. The fridge had nothing but blood bags in it when she checked it and there wasn't any kind of human nutrition anywhere in the flat. Joan had never felt so desperate before. She was hungry, thirsty, sick, hurt and locked down in a vampire's flat. It would take a miracle for her to make it out of this place alive.
"Joan-"
"How so?"
"I'm starving actually."
"I'd noticed his fangs earlier."
She was very surprised to find Sherlock standing under the moonlight coming from the window in the kitchen. He had his back turned towards her; slightly bending over the counter as his hands were gripping the edge of the counter and supporting his weight, his head hung low.
"That's too general, doctor. I have multiple situations all at once I'm afraid. You'll have to be a little more specific as to which one you're referring to."
"But who is she?"
"Oleander what, Sherlock?"
It's clearly traumatized him so I don't push him. "You should have told me. I could have helped."
'Oh... Are you sure? I mean-"
"One last thing," he took a jewelry box off his desk and handed to her. "Joan, if I ask you to wear this tonight and not to question why, would you do it?" he asked softly.
Seeing (and smelling) all the blood made him crave it more and this dark desire made him sick. He tried to shout, tried to cry out, tried to move, but all in vain. He just fell to his knees due to gravity as his legs wouldn't hold him up anymore and his body shivered uncontrollably. Joan was the only one he didn't wish to hurt in the whole world, the one person he'd done so much to protect (even from himself... no, SPECIALLY from himself) but now he'd given in to the monstrous side of himself and had taken her life. He wished that the earth beneath him would open its mouth and swallow him whole right there and then.
"NO! Leave her alone!" He heard himself yell but could hardly recognise the hoarse scream as his own, "I said let her go!" The other vampire growled in protest but Sherlock tore him away from her and threw him over to a nearby wall before really realizing what he's doing. The vicious vampire was back on his feet in a second and growled as he ran towards Sherlock. The two of them quarrelled for a while, growling with each punch or kick and growing more impatient by the minute.
Well anyway let me know that you think about it and till next time stay awesome.
Before he drifted off in to a nice slumber he could help but think:
“For the love of God Mycroft shut up!” Another shot fired, John retreating a bit again. It was all too much for the detective. His mind, now the hallucinations, God damn him for not taking a bigger dose of the drug, than his mind would be too intoxicated to function. For the way that it was now it was working even faster than usual. Sherlock could simply not catch up to his own mind. John tried to move forward again and Sherlock pointed the gun at him.
“Wow, ok I really don’t need you of all people to tell me what a crappy father I am. You have no right Mycroft!”
After about more 5 minutes the doctor gave a final nod to the Holmes brother and left. John watched as the now small looking man was left standing there like a deer in front of headlights. John slowly walked towards him and put his arm on his shoulder. “Mycroft … how is he?” was all that John could get out at that point.
“Don’t you dare say it’s for the best! Don’t you dare do this to me again you selfish prick! Do not leave me behind!” John’s voice cracked at the end and Sherlock could see rage flushing over his face.
“God damn it John, calm her down!” he was shouting now, making Rosies crying even worse. Now even a phone started ringing in the background. “Come on Sherlock… Lets go and play again! Let me play with you” said the voice in his head again.
After he heard the door to John’s room close he shoot of of his bed and made his way in to the kitchen. He needed those pain meds if he wanted to sleep at least a little bit today or simply didn’t want to lose his mind.
“I’m no solder John, I’m a civilian. I can not deal with this! I do not sleep, I feel sick every time I try to eat and truth be told I’m literary just waiting for a chance to slit my throat and be done with this shit. Also stop bringing Mary up evey time you feel like you need to lecture me. She is dead, stop making her in to a saint or martyr or what every you are tying. She is dead, let her be.”
“No that’s not true!” Molly almost jumped up from her chair and stepped closer to John. He wanted to move away from her but she grabbed him by his arm.
Pain … thats right he felt pain again. It shot thru his arm again. Like his skin was being ripped apart or as if he was getting burned alive. He wanted to grab his arm, squeeze it to somehow lessen the pain but that was the time he was reminded – he has no arm. All that pain is just in his head, it was not real. But then again what was real?
John was stunt. Did Sherlock feel this way this whole time? And John was just telling Mycroft yesterday how well Sherlock is doing. Shit, he really didn’t know Sherlock that well anymore did he? Usually he could feel if something was wrong with Sherlock before the detective knew it himself. But now? Now he has no idea what was going on in his head. I mean he never really knew what was going on, hell it was Sherlock but he felt as if they had a bond. That bond was gone now. And that comment about Mary left a weird aftertaste in John's mouth. Did he really use Mary as an excuse to lecture Sherlock? He decidet to ignore that for now. He had more important issues to deal with.
thought of them that way. I think Moriarty was just using him for his talents and maybe even for fun. He always did like his pets. And as to why not kill me; killing someone is eazy. Its quick and not really satisfying. Even a monkey can do it. Torture - now that is something that can go on as long as you want it to. If you torture someone for long enough he will break and when he does you can do what ever you want with him. It's a form of humiliation as well as submison. No matter how strong, how proud a person is, if you torture him for long enough you can make him your toy. And when that happens, well ...
“Why did you do this to me? Do you really hate me that much? Why didn’t you just kill me?” said the young detective again this time in a more aggressive tone.
“Mycroft told me about it after Sherlock ran away from him again. He asked me to keep an eye on him. Not that I could do much to protect him really. But again John that wasn’t you. That was the pain and grief speaking. I know you, you are good and kind by heart.” Said the lady with a weak smile and gentle eyes. Her voice was smooth and confident. John wished that he could be so confident in her words too. But truth be told, he wasn’t confident at all. Was he really a good person? Did he deserve all this trust Mrs Hudson was putting in him?
Sherlock stopped and held his breath. It felt as if the name alone was a painful knife to his chest.
“I’m fine John. Don’t worry about me.” His voice was faint and husk, like he had just woken up. Or not slept in days.
Just a warning!
“What? No, Mr Smith, please don’t do that. I know I’ve been late a couple of times but please.”
Sherlock bowed over to pick up the little plate with his right hand when he was (annoyingly) reminded again that he has no right hand… or arm for that matter. But it was funny tho… he could swear that he could feel his arm starch out towards the ground, feel the cold air on his fingertips. But when he looked at it, there was nothing. Rosie started crying shortly after that as she was still missing her little plate. Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself.
“It’s not that simple Mycroft … I can’t just come here every day. This is 2 and a half hours away from where I life now. I can’t leave Rosy with relatives for so long –“
John stared behind him with an expression of shock on his face. After a minute he smiled to himself and thought: “One hell of a doctor you are, you didn’t ween check on your patient until he went in to shock.”
“Sherlock! Sherlock listen to me. You’re in a hospital. Sherlock” It was no use. The detective did not see him. No for real that is. He needed to get the Detectives attention. He grabbed him by the shoulder and shook him slightly. “Sherlock! Listen to me, listen to my voice. Concentrate on my voice, forget the pain. Focus on me!” Sherlocks eyes shoot to Johns face and his screams broke for a brief second. “John, it hurt …” Sherlock was lifting his left arm up trying to grab Johns shoulder. He wanted to convince himself that that was not a hallucination. That his John was really here and not just in his head.
“Nothing of importance.”
“Sherlock! Listen to me! Put the gun away! …What did you take?” That’s right … He used again … Damn it, he was doing so well. John was so proud of him for being clean. But his drug dealer came by just a few minutes (could have been hours for what Sherlock knows) after John had left. And his mind was already a huge thunder storm. He just couldn’t resist. John was so close now. Just a few feet away from him. Sherlock turned away pressing his hands against his head. It felt as if his head was going to explode … He could feel the cold iron of the gun in his hand press against his forehead. He endured all kinds of torture; physical in Serbia and mental his whole life, but this, this pain that he felt right now was the worst. He could not escape it, retreat in to his mind palace and block out the world that caused him the pain. This time his mind was the enemy, the pain maker. He wished to stop it all. To stop the pain of his mind collapsing in on itself again and again. He pointed the gun at John looking at him with cold eyes.
"Why did you want him dead? He never did anything to you," Sophia asked.
The only time I feel a bit of peace is when I'm by his grave. I talk to him, pour my heart out. I beg him to take me along. But I see his answer as if he's standing before me. He would tilt his head to one side, give me a sad smile and then look down.
"Because he's killed someone. I can prove it and he knows this. I wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for..." he stopped, not really eager to share the rest of that sentence with the likes of Venenum.
Three more seconds and she'd be ripped apart right there and then.
"The man who had stabbed me would have finished what he'd started if you hadn't intervened. It would cause too much trouble for him to kill me in front of a witness. So he'd be forced to kill you too. But he couldn't risk killing a human because, while a vampire may get away with killing another vampire -which has happened before- they would never get away with killing a human and the risk of exposing our secret to the police and then to the public. So he was forced to postpone his plans and to try his chance with me another time."
“Then move back in and bring her too. I can take care of her during the day when your busy. It would be lovely to have the little cup cake here,” jumped Mrs Hudson.
“What are you talking about? I don’t act as if-“
He let out a breath of relief. That was a close one.
“What the bloody hell happened Greg? He was almost killed!” John could not contain the rage in his voice and truth be told he was surprised that he was angry. He thought that he didn’t care for Sherlock, not after he almost beat him to death.
“There is no other way Sherlock. We have to or the dead cells from your arm will poison you!” John knew that Sherlock would not take kindly to the idea but he had to convince his former college that that was his best shoot.
“Damn it, Mary!” he said quietly to himself and started walking home. His apartment was empty, Rosie was with relatives… He needed some time for himself. Everything that he saw somehow reminded him of Mary, but also of Sherlock. He blamed Sherlock for her death. Sherlocks big mouth, his ego were the reason that Mary died. He promised he would keep her save! He made an oath and he did not uphold it! Mary died right in front of him and he did nothing. John knows that he is just shifting the blame on Sherlock to make himself feel better, for deep down he know that Sherlock could have done nothing to prevent her death. It just happened. If someone were to blame then that would be John. He let Mary go along, he was not at her side when it happened, he could not save her.
“Sherlock?” John almost whispered in Sherlock direction. He squatted down next to the shaken detective and placed his hand on his cheek. “Sherlock can you hear me?”
(Sherlock almost just rolled his eyes)
After a long afternoon of research John figures out why Sherlocks in so much pain. His condition is serious and demands immediate surgery. But what to do when Sherlock does not agree with the plan of treatment? Will John be able to convince the  Detective or will he have to cheat in the game for Sherlock life?
“Looks like I will have to finish your friends later.” She said under her breath as she began to stich up the Y incision on his chest.
“Hello, yes this is Dr Watson.”
“I thing I have been selfish and cold long before Mary died,” said John after a couple of minutes past in silence. His voice sounded broken and another sob escaped just as he mouthed Marys name. Mrs Hudson wanted to say something in protest but John cut her off.
“It’s on the table in the kitchen. Mrs Hudson brought it up earlier. I think there is a letter there for you.” Sherlock did not say anything as to acknowledge Johns answer, but John could hear paper being thrown around. “
“Emm yes. I wanted to take a picture of Rosie. She is sleeping so soundly.”
“Hallo Dr Watson? I need your help.”
“No John…” he stumbled towards the door and opened it, “that’s the part where you leave.” John looked at Sherlock with shock. Did he really mean this?
He needed some air and some time alone. Just to be able to breath, without John or Mrs Hutson fuzzing over him or the little Rosy running around his legs. He stood up from his bed and peaked though the door. John fell asleep with Rosy on the couch, Mrs Hudson should be at the shop right now. That was his chance! He grabbed his coat and an old cap and quietly left the apartment. It was mid-winter now, he could feel the cold air hit his face and fill his lungs – making them ache in an unfamiliar way. He looked up and down the street deciding where to go. It wasn’t that late yet, but because of constructions down the road the street was as empty as ever. He was finally alone. He pulled his coat tighter together and then just started walking. He had no real destination he just wanted to clear his head for a bit and return before John could notice that he was missing.
John watches as an answering smile blooms on Sherlock’s lips.
Thanks.
“New case,” Sherlock finally says.
“The two of you,” Greg continues, almost daring him to say something now, “you are good for each other. No matter what people say about him or about you, you truly are good for each other.”
The two of them manage to get it down the stairs, staring in silence at the mattress. Maybe John could try and figure out exactly what burned that hole, make one into his own mattress next time.
"It needed saying again," John smiles, feeling Sherlock's leg closing around his waist again.
“That was…”, he stuttered slightly, blinking a few times, “How did you know that?”
XX67: I- (
02/27/2016 - 03:23 am.
“I’ve received a text on my way to the station,” Sherlock says, choosing to keep for himself the exact nature of the said text for now. “She did seem happy.”
Sherlock goes willingly into a hug, John hiding his smile by going to get Rosie.
The fire is burning between them.
Rosie is crying.
Sherlock sighs deeply, the hand that had been playing with John's shirt holding on tighter, "No, I didn't need to."
John resists the urge to roll to his side. “Yeah?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Does it really matter?" Sherlock replies too quickly.
“It’s not,” John replies, shifting closer and closing his own eyes. “But we’re worth fighting for, yeah?” Sherlock smiles, nodding slightly and John seals their lips again for a tender, gentle kiss. And before either of them can do anything about it, sleep finds them snuggled together.

"I figured that was it," John replies, unable to repress a relieved chuckle. "I take it you got what you wanted?" He asks, kneeling next to him to take over, having no remorse in adding a bit more pressure to the hold.
There is no way I’m
: Letters.
He hears John sighing, and then the sound of his elbows hitting the table. Face in his hands? Afraid? Angry? Tired?
Six days ago, a version of myself from a different universe sent me a letter. Well, I say sent… I found it under a lath in my bedroom. Still, I had it expertised and there isn’t any doubt, the handwriting is mine. Plus this other me proved himself, and despite everything I ever believed in, this is truly happening.
“A murderer?” John asked and Sherlock clearly saw a spark of interest in the doctor’s eyes.
my way back. Do you
Sherlock studies him for a moment before nodding, the promise of what’s about to happen making it hard to move now, and John slowly takes Sherlock’s hand before pulling him away from the window, “All right?”
"Dr Watson has moved in."
Leaving now. The usual spot?
Sherlock shook his head, chasing away the unwelcome fantasy of John’s strong body above him in a entirely different situation. He only needed to finish the case, and then maybe Sherlock would consider exploring the further possibilities of his companionship with John Watson.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What about yes or no question?" John asks, burying his nose in his hair and breathing him in. Sherlock nods slowly after a moment, and John considers his first question for a long moment, enjoying Sherlock's warm and pliant body against his. He finally asks, "Are you comfortable with what we've done so far."
“That’s the plan, as long as your Pa’ allows it,” John says.
“I’m bored, John,” Sherlock finally lets out when they part, sighing quite loudly against his lips.
He stops twice to catch his breath, considering both times to go home instead and let this go. If Sherlock realises he's following him, and he will being Sherlock bloody Holmes, he's going to get mad and for all the right reasons. John already doubts his jealousy wasn't obvious earlier, and Sherlock and him go without mentioning it. He won't do the same twice, and then John won't have any other choice than to justify his behavior.
“Oh come on,” Rosie replies, laughing, “You know he couldn’t ask you to move out even if he wanted to, which he really doesn’t.”
The hot water almost makes him miss 221B and all the private, silent moments the four falls of the bathroom bore witness to. Unable to stop himself, John is already thinking back on the first time he took himself in hand, barely a week after having moved in. He doesn't dare to think about the last time, the mere thought making something ache inside his chest. He stares down at himself, his flaccid penis showing no signs of arousal despite the few images going through his mind, and for just a second, John wonders if Sherlock hadn't been right, if they're not too old for some things after all.
Sherlock looks around them. “I guess the library could be reorganised.”
“I know,” John replies, leaning into him, and Sherlock’s breath catches.
Sherlock can’t help but smile at this too, and John is the one to squeeze his hand this time, silent questions dancing in his eyes.
“Not Italian,” Sherlock cuts him.
John turns around, finding Sherlock staring at his bed.
Sherlock turns in his arms before John can register what is happening, and two strong hands are now cupping his face, Sherlock's panting breath against his lips. They stare into each other eyes for a small eternity, John finding it harder and harder not to bring those lips to his. "I love you," he says instead, the words having remained stuck in his throat for too long. "I should have told you, the very night we met, right when we were leaning against that wall and I thought to myself that this was being alive felt like, that you were the one. You had brought me back to life with sharp deductions in cabs and chases around London."
“Perfect,” Sherlock whispers.
"You've apologized already," Sherlock cuts him off. "There's no need to do it again."
"Did Horsen notice you too?"
"No, my office is-" Lestrade begins but Sherlock is already gone. "Well, after you," he smiles, letting John go first.
"For about a month," Mrs Hudson replies, sighing. "I was very surprised when Sherlock introduced him to me, and at first I thought he was working one of his cases again, but Matthew continues to come home every day."
"Oh come on," she sighs, "I haven't come all the here just to hear just ‘fine’."

“John, I feel I should warn you about some habits of mi-”
"Bee," Rosie repeats, still examining her outwear with tentative fingers.
John chokes on another laugh, “Yeah?”
That’s good.
That’s why, as he came into the next of the airport hotels, walking into a fully decorated foyer, John had to bite his lip when he spotted the dark mop of curls in front of him. He could just walk past Sherlock and hope the other would either not see or simply ignore him. But that was too much effort, and in total honesty, John had learned not to let a second chance pass right before his eyes. So he stalked up behind Sherlock, ready to face whatever the night would offer.
"I trust she's well," Sherlock breathes after another beat of silence.
The sun has not quite risen yet when Sherlock wakes up choking on air, a hand clasped on his chest and the sensation of drowning still too real. He rolls to his side purely based on instinct, breath still coming short and shallow. His hands find John first, sliding up and around his waist until they’re settled against his lower back, secured, safe. Then, his entire body collide softly against John’s, legs and arms and chest fitting into the spaces made for him - and him only. He finds his breath again in the creek of John’s neck, where his skin is warm and just a little sweaty, just enough for the scent to infiltrate Sherlock’s skin and bones. He sighs, low and quiet, the shivers he hadn’t yet noticed coming to a stop. He allows himself a second more before closing back his eyes, the cold, freezing air from his dream fading away with every rise and fall of John’s chest against his own. He lets one finger trace the familiar mark of the scar on John’s back, a out of shape circle acquired after a case in Wales, the memory of a knife that had come too close. He strokes the scar over and over, copying his breathing to John’s, revelling into the marvelling fact that they’re both here, alive and warm and close. He kisses the skin offered to him, silently worshiping the man still asleep in his arms, and with one last ragged breath, follows him.
Women died after drinking from a glass of someone else. No poison could be detected in the glass, yet she didn’t drink or eat anything else. The glass was empty at the time of her death. “God help me they are stupid, the poison was in the ice of the drink! The lid of the cup was opened ... she opened the cup to eat the ice cube in the drink, common habbit. God how boring!” Sherlock screamed and threw the case file in the wall.
“Mr Hutson heard her crying from downstairs and came up to check up on us. When she saw what state you were in she just grabbed the little one and went out the house. You didn’t even notice her comming here did you?”
“How low you have sunk brother dearest. Being confused by hallucinations. Can you not see the obvious solution to your problem? You must be a bigger fool than I thought.”
“Is that so? Can I see it?” said Sherlock as he came out of the kitchen with his mug of tea.
“Moriarty threatened to kill me … that’s why you …“
“Funny … I thought I heard you pick up the phone before the first alert ... As if you wrote first.” Said Sherlock back, his voice a bit raspy.
“Hello mother. I’m good, I’m good. Listen … Sherlock is not doing so well. He … he …” his voice broke and for a second he was sure he forgot how to breath.
Suddenly he could hear an old familiar sound again – the sound of dogs paws hitting concrete. The sound of a dog tag swinging from side to side.
“Fair enough. But still, don’t you -“
