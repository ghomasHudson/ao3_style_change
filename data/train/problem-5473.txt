“Yeah, Cas?”
They get to work, Dean on the Impala and Bobby on dismantling an old car that has seen better days but it’s still good for scraps. The music is on, loud to be heard under the clanging of the tools, but not enough to discourage talking.
“Oh, you know the way. We’re going to the Roadhouse!”
’re the reason I had to cancel?”
The following hours are spent on researching the furniture he thinks is gonna look good in the house, based on the pictures he has (he’s gonna visit it the next day, when all the construction work is done), then he starts his computer and launches the program where he’s gonna create a model of the house and work with that to present a project to the customers.
. Deal?”
So, it’s Friday.
“Huh I- I did my best, Doctor Novak! And please, call me Dean.”
They still kiss some more before Cas finally gets out of the car.
“Alright, let me see what this pimpmobile is doing to torture you. Open the hood!”
“It seems like you’ve followed my instructions. Are you flossing after every meal? At least after lunch and dinner?” he frees the other man’s mouth to let him answer.
The drive home is occupied by weighing out the pros and the cons of creating a profile on one of those dating apps. Maybe he'll ask Charlie's opinion on this, she's the geek tech after all.
An ugly one, preferably.
, with his eyes closed and a very peaceful expression. Castiel’s brain flatlines, but his hands keep working, ineffectively cleaning the same tooth he was done with probably what? five minutes ago?
“I’ll have a double cheeseburger
Not too much time later he’s sitting in the shop’s office, already changed, and eating with Bobby one of his BLT sandwiches that are more B than L or T.
You know
“No, but you can blame your
“I- I suppose my- my harsh judgment on the car was- rushed?” he really doesn’t know what to say.
“What about you, Cas?”
But the fact that the other man insisted to come pick him up, even if it was because
“Really? Why? Did he stalk you? You were worried about being a creep and
Yes, he was scared of what the third time they saw each other would’ve resulted in, but at the same time he was curious. Maybe the third time everything would’ve been normal, maybe it would’ve been another embarrassing accident. He’ll never know.
Because apparently this is what he’s doing today.
“Thanks Chuckles, I knew I could count on you” he grumbles and crosses his arms. He’s absolutely not pouting.
“Cas, you don’t have to work tomorrow, right?”
loud.
Not that they spend all the time talking.
“No, no, it was by chance. I think. I didn’t ask him. Oh man, is he following me to sue me?? Fuck, that’s why that Meg chick told me to call today to reschedule the appointment! It’s a trap!”
“That’s what I’m familiar with. When I was a kid Sundays were spent working on Baby with Dad in the morning, then baking pie with Mom in the afternoon. Happy memories, y’know?”
Basically, last month was torture and he was starting to dread the checkup appointment of one Dean Winchester, but despite of that he found himself disappointed when the green-eyed man didn’t show up.
They move in the same moment, erasing the distance between them and their lips.
Before he can answer, Mr. Singer says “He thinks I’ll give him a discount if he brings the car every other week.”
“No, no, Doc- I’d like- it was a joke. That’s all.”
It should be easy, right?
“Buddy, there was nothing wrong with your car, it’s fine.”
Before he can think he hears himself asking “Dean?” and sees the other man facing him and Mr. Singer, with one hand over his head like he’s massaging it. That’s probably what the thud was.
But the clinic was just starting to have a good amount of patients and finally he was making some money. It was so nice to finally relax and not stress over bills, paying up loans, and making ends meet.
He likes the old and rusty Lincoln Continental, he’s fond of it, but lately it spends more time at Mr. Singer’s auto shop than in the building’s parking lot. Or doing its job and transporting him around.
“Oh buddy, this car is perfectly fine, you on the other hand… you’re lucky you’re cute.” Dean shakes his head and turns off the car “C’mere.”
“Nah, don’t worry. It was nice seeing you outside of those scrubs and not around the disinfectant smell.” Dean smiles easily, making a disgusted face at the mention of the disinfectant smell.
After that Dean makes himself dinner, some pasta with a pesto sauce whose recipe he saw the other day and seemed pretty damn tasty, then parks his ass in front of the tv for the newest Doctor Sexy episode. Yeah, his day took a weird turn, but
This is when he would try to flirt, saying something like “would you mind if I’d do it again, on purpose?” but Cas looks uncomfortable and he doesn’t want to risk this… thing… they’ve got going on.
Castiel sighs, thumping his forehead once on the table and growling a “
“It was a very nice first date, Cas. I don't know when was the last time I had this much fun at the Roadhouse with someone who wasn’t family."
Dean is a bit dizzy.
For one second, before freaking out.
To put his grape flavored gloved fingers
“I thought Meg was your wife, we’re square.” Dean waves him off and there’s a lull in the conversation.
“Hey, sweetheart, it’s not a problem. You’re not getting rid of me easily.”
The kisses become more heated and there’s teeth involved, grazing lips and gently biting tongues, they move in the front seat and Dean ends up straddling Cas’ lap (and hitting his head on Baby’s roof), groaning happily into each other’s mouth as they realize that their dicks are very interested in the situation.
Figuring that Meg won’t leave him alone until he looks busy, he steps into the dental chair’s room and checks that the assistant readied everything he needs to operate, and does his best to ignore his friend’s knowing look.
“Free dental work? I’d be a happy guinea pig too!”
“Will you let me watch under her hood or should we stay here ‘till sunset?”
“You work too much. You spend your spare time at home, reading. Which is nice, once in a while, but not always.”
is the reason. You only have to find out if he’s a homophobe, then.” with a wink she resumes eating, and Cas follows, not wanting to end up in another argument. And also because he’s busy subtly looking for Dean in the crowd of the bar.
“I had no control over it! They tasted good!”
"Was this the first one?"
And today,
Cas is warm and solid between his arms, Dean can't help but press a kiss on his head before looking up at the night sky.
, I guess I’ll have to hop off and let you get your beauty sleep so I can have you at your best tomorrow?”
“No, God, no! But you work here sometimes, I figured you’d know their seasonal beers…”
Castiel takes a sip of the beer and wow. There’s some coffee and chocolate in there? Also licorice? What? Is that a beer? Are we sure?
“You’re right, but I still feel like I owe you.” an idea blooms into his mind and before he can second guess himself he says “Can I offer you dinner? As a thank you. I know a place that makes great burgers and pie.”
He just wanted to eat a burger.
In the end he’s only five minutes earlier than agreed, but to his surprise Cas is already in front of the building’s door, looking around nervously.
Traveling at that time seemed just like a waste of time and money, so Castiel kept saying “maybe next month, Mick” until Mick wasn’t there anymore.
Dean learned that the doctor uses a lot of emojis and especially likes the bee one, he used it so much that Dean had renamed his contact as
“His secretary did! Said it’s routine!”
he’s here at the roadhouse
Today’s problem is that it won’t go faster than 20 mph. There must be something wrong. Maybe the spark plugs? Gabriel said something like that when Castiel called him earlier.
On his way to work he keeps thinking whether there is something he can do to get out of this hole he crawled himself in, but the only reasonable solution is just bailing.
Cas looks up and fuck, that’s a sight. Dean gets a playful smile in return. One of his hands is busy playing with the doctor’s hair on the nape of his neck, the other rests on his cheek.
Dean can play.
“Well then, Dean, take a seat! I’ll check if your teeth are clean and then we’ll begin removing the cavities!” with a hand he guides Dean and then takes a seat on his wheeled stool.
Slowly, very slowly (and collecting more than one angry shout by some drivers), he arrives at Singer’s Auto Shop and parks outside.
“Whatever. I have another appointment next week, how am I supposed to face him?”
They get to the car and Dean, still trying to be the gentleman, opens the passenger’s car door with a little bow. Cas laughs and gets in, thanking him. Dean walks to his side of the car and a couple of seconds later is ready to take off. The doctor gives directions once again swiftly, and it’s not long until they’re outside Cas’ building.
. Dean shifts on his seat, uncomfortable in his pants all of a sudden.
partner’s work, and also that his decor style is beautiful so maybe he can hire them (Dean alone, preferably) to renovate the apartment.
“I don’t know Meg, you know I don’t care. And I’d love it if you three would stop.”
Maybe because Meg kept pestering him about the whole finger-licking thing. His hopes of her not knowing were crushed only one hour later that fateful day, because Alfie didn’t think it was wise to not divulge this particular story during lunch break, and once he started talking Meg was like a dog with a bone.
“First of all! It was his fault. He told me to open my mouth
Castiel knows he’s rambling as he stands up and discards gloves and mask. Still talking, he walks to the door and before going out of the room he gives Dean a curt nod. He’s in his office in seconds.
Cas knows what he’s doing, there’s no doubt since his smile is now a smirk. Dean wonders what his own face is doing, but he probably looks like he received a bucket of iced water on his head. He quickly ducks his head and starts eating, feeling Cas’ gaze on him.
“Meg. You knew it, don’t pretend you didn’t. Why did you bring me here?” his tone is accusing, but he tries to stay calm.
“Give us a call tomorrow, so we can reschedule your appointment. It’s a pity your teeth are so straight,
His mind goes immediately to the next time he’s at the Roadhouse and Jo doesn’t give him their special pecan pie as a payback, so he takes a breath and uncovers his face.
“Do you prefer motor oil and exhaustion gas?” Castiel tilts his head, watching the other man as he steps towards his own car. He follows.
He should really take Mr. Singer’s advice and dispose of his car, the older man has repaired it so many times that if he says it’s time to buy a new one, then it must mean something. He’ll have to ask Gabriel for help, since he’s the only one he knows that understands cars. Bal would just tell him to buy a Tesla or something equally expensive and Meg would insist on buying a very impractical sports car. Maybe Mr. Singer has some suggestions? He will have to call him.
Surprisingly, Cas is a good navigator. They chat about their day, but the doctor doesn’t miss a beat and always signals the turns they have to take on the right moment, so their drive is not that long.
“I am
Dean smiles softly and climbs off Baby first, then helps Cas, who honest to God stretches and yawns loudly when his feet touch the ground.
And holy shit, maybe that’s not the only thing that’s hard, because the commanding tone of the doctor shoots right to Dean’s dick. Which, right now? Not good, at all.
bitchface and takes out of the bag two wrapped burgers, setting one near to Dean. “Yours has barbecued eggplants, black beans, onions and I told them to add tons of BBQ sauce. Mine has a lentil and chickpeas patty and some avocado sauce that I have no idea what it’s made of, but it tastes really good.”
If the car was a pet, Castiel would say that Dean is caressing her fur. He pats his hand on the black roof, looking at her fondly while talking.
He asks Hannah, the secretary, if Mr. Winchester left any messages, if he’s late, but the answer is negative. Dean was his last patient for the day, so he takes advantage of this “free” time and does some paperwork, checking the records for tomorrow’s patients, filling out some new patients’ records, and before he knows it, Meg is knocking on his open door to catch his attention.
They could’ve met differently, like when Dean wasn’t making a fool out of himself by saying or doing inappropriate things to his dentist.
With a nod he writes down their order and walks back, as fast as he can without it looking like he’s running away, to the kitchen.
It's not a date.
He stays there, watching Cas retreat into the building, but before he gets inside he turns around.
Phone, check. Keys, check. Wallet, check. Leather jacket, check.
“You speak lots of languages?”
“Kevin! Kevin, my man, I can’t serve table 14. You take care of them, okay?”
Charlie!”
In the end, he forgets about Novak and the idea of dating apps. The new storyline of Doctor Piccolo's relationship with a nurse to make Doctor Sexy jealous is a very good distraction.
"Just the important ones. I learned as a kid in case I got lost and had to find my way home."
He’ll take it slow.
“Dean, please don’t tell me you sucked this poor man’s finger.”
“So nothing weird could happen, if you keep yourself in check! It’s a quick routine checkup, right?” Dean nods at his brother “There you go. Just don’t be a creep!”
Dean had a day off so he’s not tired, on the contrary he’s actually fidgety and in need of something to do. Getting drunk was a good option to forget about the appointment he purposefully missed, but destiny or God had some other plans.
“C’mon, let’s get out there.”
Sadly the same can’t be said for Cas’ job, since the one time that he described in detail how a wisdom tooth extraction is done Dean had told him to shut up.
” Castiel grits through his teeth.
“Mr. Winchester! How are you? I hope you followed my orders this last week!” he aims at a joke, but the other man tenses and smiles nervously, and he’s not so sure his attempt was successful.
"I live to serve, man."
“Great, there goes my plan! Do you have any idea?”
it’s a very accurate word.”
taken.
They’re both smiling so much that at first it’s a bit weird, but they fit together easily and the resulting kiss feels like fire is burning in Dean’s veins.
“Are you tired of me yet?”
wouldn’t mind putting my fingers in your mouth!” and she winks. She fucking
So yeah, even if he wanted to forget about it, he couldn’t. His brain was scheming with Meg apparently.
“That’s very good to hear. I’m glad you had supportive parents.”
A low frustrated grumble is his answer, then a forehead on his chest.
do something stupid. Dammit, why is he like this? His brain to mouth filter really needs to be improved.
This feels like pining over the straight popular boy in high school all over again, but he’s 34 and has stopped losing his very precious time to straight men.
He startles, caught red-handed, but tries to regain his composure as he closes the laptop and stands.  “
“Good. Then… I guess it’s time I go?”
Lunch time arrives and Dean calls Bobby, asking him if it’s too early to get there, but the older man tells him to move his ass so they can eat and then work in peace.
“Yeah, sorry Doc, I, huh- should’ve called to say I was recruited to help here, it’s been a busy evening! So…” Dean tries for nonchalance and clears his throat, again “are you and the missus here to eat or drink?”
” he hears Charlie lets out a relieved breath “I- I just licked them. Insistently.”
it’s not the time, approaches his car. He sees that Dean’s ears are redder than before, but he’s still smiling and it feels genuine so he just doesn’t question it.
He wakes up later than usual, but 9 AM is still early enough to do some chores before heading to Singer's Auto Shop. He spends the morning working around the house, music loud enough to be heard in every room and singing just as loud. His neighbors never complained so it must mean he’s not
“Because he either really is a homophobic piece of shit, and we won’t see him ever again, or he gets the hint and makes a move on you, maybe puts his tongue to work again to loosen you up.” the wink she adds is gratuitous, and Castiel fights the urge to throw at her some peanuts.
“No, I come here often so I know what I like. But thank you. Maybe recommend me a beer? I’m sure you know what they have on tap better than me.”
He really doesn’t want to go to the shop but he needs the car, he can’t keep asking rides to his brother and friends, he just doesn’t have any time to go car hunting so this will have to do.
Or, he's treating it as a date, common sense be damned.
And maybe. Maybe
stops him. Dean is a little embarrassed that everyone knows what happened with the man, but this is not the time. Kevin grins and turns around, looking for Jo. Dean knows he’s fucked.
Castiel sees Mr. Singer walking towards him and steps out of the car, ready to be scolded. Again. He’s relieved that it’s Saturday and the older man is usually alone, he doesn’t like when there’s an audien- oh.
does something to the blue-eyed man, because he licks his lips quickly before leaning in while opening his mouth. Then he wraps his pretty lips around the fork. Keeping eye contact with Dean and basically sucking on it. Then he retreats against the booth’s backrest, munching while smiling.
The next morning Dean is still tired from the impromptu shift at the Roadhouse. He went home later than he wanted but at least he’s not hungover. It would’ve been bad for business if he was, since he has to meet some new clients and a headache and red eyes don’t make a good first impression.
Cas pushes the plate towards Dean, stating he knows how much he loves pie and doesn’t want to take away even a bite from him, but he shakes his head.
In the 10 years of his practice Castiel has never felt like this for an appointment.
“He? Dude, no. Oh my God, no!” he throws back his head, laughing hard “Charlie is a girl. My best friend. A big
He’s gonna pick Cas up.
“You just told me to not harass him anymore?”
“I’m sorry, you
but I won’t be hearing anything about finger-licking, or Dean Winchester, I will walk away with the burger if you only say
He hopes the pie is worth his brother’s meddling.
you. I should introduce you to each other.”
For a second he doesn’t understand why the man’s eyes become twice their normal size, but as he sees the blush on his cheeks he mentally kicks himself and prays that Meg isn’t around lurking. Nonetheless, Dean opens his mouth without saying a word and so Castiel gets to work, talking only when he needs another tool from Alfie or if the saliva ejector needs to be moved.
With a big smile Dean puts Baby in reverse and they’re back on the road. He tries to figure out the way from where they’re now, and it takes only a couple of wrong turns to be back on track.
He couldn’t lie to himself though, and even if he didn’t lick the doctor’s fingers on purpose, it was something he had really liked.
“Do you really want me to answer that?” he grins then swallows the bite.
That’s awesome! Charlie would
, a date), he worked with half of his usual attention on Baby.
The blonde girl walks around the counter and guides them to a booth in the corner “I don’t think you need a menù, Dean, but tell me if you need one. I’ll send Kevin in a second to get your order!”
Nope, no, absolutely not. Because a) Novak would be insane to accept a date with him, Dean knows that he’s not date material, because his life is boring, and 2) what the fuck? He’s his dentist and their business relationship is weird already, there’s no need to add hitting on him explicitly to the mix.
The texts they exchanged in the past days were nice, he feels like they know each other better even if they haven’t shared any real personal information.
It takes a couple of seconds for his words to register in Castiel’s brain, but none on Meg’s, who’s already snickering.
“Meg, please! I’m trying to forget about the accident!” he flicks some water at her face, feeling childish.
“You sure? Not even the burgers from the Roadhouse can convince you?”
“What did you do this time?”
“Fine, suit yourself. Maybe
” another kiss lands on Dean’s lips, stunned by the endearment.
He just has to find out if he feels the same. His flirting is rusty, but he can give it a try.
“I thought it was time for some finger-licking, Clarence.”
“Cruel. Why does Charlie put up with you?” Dean grumbles but he’s already circling the counter and taking one apron to tie on.
A couple of minutes later, Dean straightens up, turning to face the other man.
” he sounds a little hysterical now.
“Good. Remember to floss before bed.”
They never met when he was working there because Cas was studying in Chicago, and then they just had different days, aka Cas was mostly there on Fridays or Saturdays and Dean preferred Thursday's crowd to the weekend’s when he wasn’t trying to hook up with someone. But even then he never hunted at the Roadhouse so he was never there. He regrets that now.
“Yeah, well, don’t worry. He won’t see me again.”
"Hey, Cas. Let's get you home." he murmurs, and the doctor nods, but doesn’t move.
Meg smiles at that, a genuine and soft smile that’s so rare on her it makes Castiel wonder if he’s already drunk with only half a beer glass.
“I don’t think I can sleep now, and I’d love to invite you upstairs…”
Dean, please.
“No, because to me it seemed like you were harassing him!” Castiel leans back on the chair, deflating.
“Ah, well... considering I spend most of my days at the clinic, I’d suggest your friend to book an appointment if he wants to see me.”
“What’s the problem today?”
They keep talking for a while, but then Charlie has to go and Dean too, so he leaves his phone on the passenger seat, hits once more the steering wheel with his forehead (and now it’s beginning to hurt) and starts the car to get to work.
“... Winchester did a number on you today too?” her tone is teasing as always.
“We agreed on eating lunch together? Did you forget?” Sam lifts the takeout bag and looks around for a free space on Dean’s desk, who readily starts collecting scraps of fabric and binders.
slowly killing my car! It’s the car that’s slowly killing
It’s probably the abrupt stop that makes Dean open his eyes in panic and Castiel knows that that is the moment Dean becomes aware of what he was doing. The flush on his whole face is only a confirmation, and Castiel is very grateful for the mask that hides half of his face, because he can’t help but smile.
"Hm. I'm sure you do." there’s some heat in those blue eyes.
“No, I did.” his answer muffled against the pillow under his face.
It wasn’t an entirely conscious decision, but on Thursday Castiel made sure to wear his bumblebees scrubs, with the slightly tight pants that he had stopped wearing because they were uncomfortable.
“Oh well, my parents were surprised when I told them I wanted to become a dentist, they figured I was going to be a bee farmer or something that had me surrounded by books, like a librarian or working in a publishing company. But they supported me and actually, my Father was the one I worked on for a couple of practical exams. He was a very happy guinea pig.”
“You want to know how I knew?” He leans in so he can press a wet kiss on Cas’ neck. His mouth finds it’s way to his ear again and he breathes the words into it. “Because I’ve been pretending to ignore how much you want me for
.” He reaches out and tugs on the sleeve of Cas’ trench coat. “And I’m gonna need you to hand this stuff over. You’ll be wearing what I tell you, when I tell you for the next week.” Cas nods and starts to step into the bathroom. Dean’s hand clamps down onto his forearm.
“Dean, wait, please-”
that.” A shudder runs through Cas. He knows that, in a way, Dean’s right. He’d been wanting to do something like that with him for years. The situation as a whole is all wrong, but touching Dean, being touched, can’t
Dean sits on the edge of the bed, one of his hands sliding through the cum coating Cas’s stomach. Cas sucks in a breath, his skin still oversensitive. Dean’s brow furrows as his eyes glide over Cas’s naked, abused body.
Cas’ mouth falls open in a gasp of shock and pain. He’s further violated by Dean’s tongue slipping into his mouth. Dean licks deep into his mouth, which forces a whimper out of him. His face burns with shame. How can he feel pleasure from such a situation?
“How about you take a shower, get nice and clean for me.”
Cas nods. He slips a second finger into himself, eager to avoid more punishment. This is the
“What? Dean, what are you talking about?” Cas shouldn’t be afraid of Dean, not really. But he can’t keep from flinching as Dean’s hand snakes up to grasp his throat.
“I suppose.” Dean finally drops his hand, but immediately slides his own up Cas’ arm to settle on his shoulder.
“Yes, you will.” His arm shifts away from Cas throat, letting him breathe unimpeded. He stays on top of him, holding him down with his body weight while he fucks him. Each hard thrust forced a soft, breathy whimper from Cas’ mouth. At first Dean’d been surprised at how cute the noises Cas makes in bed are, but over time he’s discovered how high and desperate his voice can get. He shifts up onto his knees, his legs spread so his cock stays inside.
“Shh, shh, shh.” Dean attaches the toy with a oddly menacing
"That's right." He drops Cas' head. It's all Cas can do to not suffocate in the sheets as he's held down and fucked. "And I've got so much more to teach you." He wraps his free arm around Cas' neck, his entire body pressed against Cas'. He murmurs into his ear, his voice low, "Like how to get your throat fucked. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Giving little thing that you are, I bet you'd enjoy getting used like that. No pleasure for you, you'll just be serving me. You want that?"
Dean laughs at his bewildered expression. “What? Never seen one of these before?” Cas shakes his head. “Yeah. I figured. But lucky you, you’re gonna get a
"Yes, Dean, please!" His voice is strained from the pressure on his throat. Even beyond that, he can barely figure out the words for what he wants to say. His head spins with every slap of Dean’s hips. “I’ll do-” The pressure on his throat makes him cough. “I’ll do anything you want.”
“Oh, angel.” Crowley pulls his chin up with a single finger. Cas opens his eyes. “You should have asked for my help writing up a contract, eh? You’ve made a right mess of it.” Dean snorts behind him.
“Think you’re ready for the final step.” The smugness is completely gone from Crowley’s voice and expression. He looks at Dean, as if asking for permission. Only when Dean gives him a curt nod does he actually start pushing. Cas’ eyebrow furrow, he doesn’t understand the suddenly serious mood, nor the gentleness. Everything is suddenly going against his expectations.
that’s hot.” Dean’s filthy commentary is almost expected at this point, but it still sends a rush of shame and arousal through him. He does his best to relax as the machine slowly forces the toy into him. It burns, he can’t quite relax around it. A pained moan is forced from him as it’s shoved too deep. The pain sits low and hot in his gut as the toy presses far deeper than Dean’s fingers had been able to reach.
“Dean.”
“Damn, it feels like you’re naked
flashes through his mind. When had that happened? And why? Why does Dean insist on keeping Cas like this when he already has someone that
over him in the past. The expression quickly slips off his face, replaced by the now more common crudeness, but it soothes Cas’ anxiety regardless. He lies down, surrenders himself. Just six more days. He knows he can do it.
A stab of fear hits Cas’ heart. Dean presses his lips to his neck. he kisses his way up his neck until he can murmur into his ear again.
“Ah, wait. What should I wear? I didn’t bring any clean clothes.”
Cas stares up at him with shock. He’d never acted like this towards him before. “A friend... An angel.” He resists the urge to cower under Dean’s intense gaze.
“What’s that? Speak up.” Dean releases one of Cas’ thighs in favor of grabbing his chin. Cas’ eyes shoot open to meet Dean’s.
His eyes squeeze closed. How many times has he thought about Dean touching him like this? He can feel himself getting hard. He’s ashamed, he can’t help but be, but it’s not enough to quell the reaction. His enjoyment outweighs his discomfort until Dean’s hand slides up and gives him a gentle squeeze.
Cas turns to face him. He’s still facing forward, watching the road with a slight smirk. Cas grabs his hand and pulls it away.
“Dean, I’ve been ashamed of my feelings for you too.”
“Dean- stop!” In any other situation, he would have given himself over to Dean without question. But in this one? While Dean isn’t
.” Cas obeys the best he can, but he can’t quite quell the way his hips jerk up with Dean’s strokes.
“I want him back, Dean. I want
“Good job.” Dean’s voice’s soft now. He give Cas another soft kiss before pulling out of him, making him gasp. He collapses down next to him and pulls him into his arms.
Dean pulls his head up so he can press a peck onto Cas lips. Cas smiles tiredly.
“Hmmm. I don’t know.” He shoves in deep and stays there. “I don’t know if you’ve earned it yet.” The sudden stillness is agony for Cas. He throws his head back, tears in his eyes.
“Got some shit to take care of. Stay in the house, do whatever you want. I’ll be back later. You can just go to bed if it gets late before I’m back.” Dean watches closely as Cas pulls his clothes back on.
“Didn’t ask if you’re alright. Asked
“What? I’m... ready. This is enough.” Cas knows that he’s pushing it, arguing like this, but he wants to get this whole thing moving.
.” Crowley’s voice drips with sarcasm, but Cas can’t muster up so much as a glare as a pinky joins the fingers inside him. He whimpers as he’s stretched uncomfortably wide, he can’t relax for Crowley the same way he could for himself. Crowley languidly fucks him, like he plans to do it all day. The discomfort slowly turns to a hesitant pleasure as the slow thrusts continue. Cas tries to hold back on expressing it, but he can’t help but make quiet, pleased sounds. Crowley, for once, is silent. He seems entirely focused on what his own hand’s doing. Shame creeps up into Cas cheeks as he watches Crowley observe his hole getting stretched open. Cas glances over at Dean. He’s already looking at Cas, his focus entirely on the blush spreading across his face. He’s still slowly stroking himself.
“Wha-”
. He’s surprised at how much it stings to be treated like a servant by him. In heaven it was common, but now that he’s considered an equal? It feels like a thorn in his heart. Nevertheless, he does as he’s told. It’s just for seven days, he can handle it. Anything for Dean.
“Fun? Sam and Hannah need me to-” Dean advances on him so quickly that his heart skips a beat. Before he can react, Dean slams him up against the wall, making paintings rattle.
“Now go get cleaned up for me.”
Cas places himself in the middle of the large bed. Before he can ask Dean for further instruction, he’s leaning over and grabbing his wrists. Cas tries and fail to quell his panic as his wrists are bound to the bedframe with sturdy leather cuffs. His arms are stretched out, each hand near the bedposts. He’s confused by the strange metal bar Dean holds up with a smile. He’s about to ask, but Dean shushes him pre-emptively. He watches with trepidation as Dean spreads his legs and straps his ankles into the loops on either side of the bar. His heart rate picks up as Dean attaches ropes to the ends and pulls his legs up. He ties them to the headboard, forcing Cas’ legs to stay spread and held up. Cas’ breathing is mildly impeded by his knees being pulled up to his chest, but it’s nothing dangerous.
“Aw, can’t a guy bask a little?” Crowley’s rough voice drifts in from the living room.
“Mmm!” He twists his head away. “Dean-!” Dean twists his fingers into Cas’ hair and forces their mouths back together. Cas’ body floods with heat despite his protests as Dean licks the tight seam of his lips. He shoves against Dean’s chest with all of his diminished strength, but Dean only laughs against his mouth.
“Little angel’s enjoying himself, I see.” Crowley croons from above him.
“What... is this?” Cas stares up at Dean. He’s confused, he’s behaving himself, why does he need to be restrained? “What are you doing?”
He gasps out, “I do. I do!” There’s no room for his embarrassment in this situation. He can only do as Dean asks, so he’ll answer honestly, degrade himself at his request. Dean returns to his chair, pulls it to the edge of the bed, right next to them.
“Get back in here.” “Just where do you think you’re going?” Dean and Crowley speak at the same time. They laugh, as if the situation is just a friendly get together. Cas forces himself back into the room. He obeys Dean’s crooked finger until he’s standing just inches from them. His heart pounds as Crowley’s hand reaches out and strokes down his cheek. It slides down his neck until it’s playing with the neckline of his shirt. Cas shudders, disgust and fear slithering up his spine. His breathing picks up as Dean’s body presses against his back, shoving him up against Crowley. He’s pressed between them with two sets of hands roaming over his body.
Dean has more hang ups that I can count. That guy couldn’t imagine doing
“That’s what I’m saying.” He holds his hand out for a handshake. Cas can’t help but hesitate before sealing the deal, he has a feeling he knows what sort of things Dean want from him.
. He can feel Dean’s erection pressing against his through layers of fabric. He can’t dispel the thought of what it would feel like if they were both naked. The thought of their bodies intertwining is an old one, as well as a shameful one.
Crowley rolls his eyes. “Yes, yes. I get the message.” He turns his attention back to Cas, his demeanor arrogant once again. “Now
“You saying you don’t want me?” Dean turns Cas’ head and presses their foreheads together. Cas shuts his eyes, feeling overwhelmed. “Look at me.” Dean’s voice is a growl; It makes a shiver run up Cas’ spine. Cas forces his eyes open, forces himself to look into Dean’s intense, yet all-too-calm eyes.
“Dean, I’m-” He whines, high and humiliating. Dean laughs above him.
“I-” Cas takes a deep breath. “I like it.” His voice is quiet, but Dean and Crowley are completely focused on him, not missing a thing.
Cas goes limp into the bed. He pulls his fingers loose with a slick sound and lets his legs fall wider open in submission. Crowley’s eyebrows raise, but he doesn’t say a word. Crowley’s hand trails up his bare thigh. Cas hears the lube being opened. He clenches his eyes shut and awaits the sensation of Crowley’s hand forcing it’s way inside him. He tries to keep his body relaxed as Crowley’s fingers brush against his loose hole.
, which earns him a glare from Dean. Cas accepts his fate with little more than a sigh. He’d promised himself that he’d do
He’s secretly grateful for the kiss Dean gives him before he leaves the cabin.
The confession sinks in.
“Don’t be. I want you well rested.” He strolls to the bed without any urgency and plops down on the edge. He’s so casual about it all that Cas can almost forget the situation they’re in. His fear won’t stay unacknowledged though, it creeps up the back of neck, makes the hair stand up. There’s a air of danger around Dean that can’t be ignored. He fights to resist the urge to put more distance between them. His anxiety spikes as Dean reaches over and rubs his thigh through the blanket.
Dean’s boot slides forward until it rests against Cas’ groin. He presses hard enough that Cas sucks in a sharp breath. Cas shoves the urge to shoves Dean’s foot away and forces himself to stay as still as possible.
“I’m not making anythin-” His voice is cut off by Dean’s hand clamping down over his mouth. Dean leans over the center console so he can get right in his face.
“I know, angel. I know.”
“Why?” Cas can’t help but ask. “Didn’t you want it?”
“Damn that’s fucking nice. And you can’t puke if you don’t eat, eh? Convenient.” Dean snickers. It’s cruel, but Cas can’t complain about it. He knows that this is what he agreed to. He braces himself for more and manages to avoid gagging on the next descent. He dares to brace his hands on Dean’s thighs and Dean freezes momentarily.
“You love it.” Crowley slips a finger in Cas’ gaping hole. With a flush of shame, Cas realizes that he can barely even feel it.
Dean pulls him close and gives him a deep, claiming kiss before handing him over to Crowley. Cas had been hoping that Crowley’d just... help or maybe even just watch, but Dean willingly hands him the reins. Dean seats himself in an armchair that’d been placed in the corner of the room, just a few feet away from the head of the bed. Cas sends a pleading glance in his direction before turning to face his task. Crowley looks him up and down, hungry, and smirks like he’s just won some kind of contest. Cas’ filled with the irrational urge to cover up his already clothed body.
sounds, today’s not the day for that.” Crowley forces Cas to shake his head by his grip on his chin. The tears suddenly spill over.
Cas reaches into the small bathroom and sets the clean clothes on the counter. With stiff, nervous movements, he turns back to Dean and slips his coat off.
Long time no see!
His words send such a powerful jolt of arousal into Cas that he moans out loud. He has to reach up and grab the headboard to ground himself. His clenched fists and gritted teeth help him hold back his helpless sounds, but high-pitched whimpers escape him regardless. The machine speeds up without warning, leaving Cas reeling.
be pleasurable. “Not take these off.”
“What? Not happy to see him?” Dean’s face is a picture of smugness. “I thought you’d like to see an
over and over with each of Dean’s ruthless thrusts. Dean lets go of his chin, returns his grip to his tense thigh.
“Too deep, huh?” On the next thrust, the machine pushes in more shallowly. “We’ll work up to it.” There’s still a twinge of pain as the dildo hits deeper than is comfortable, but Cas relaxes a bit. He’s relieved that Dean listened to his plea, he’d half expected him to just laugh. Or even set the machine to push deeper.
Cas makes a questioning noise. Since when does Crowley care?
?” Dean’s face is serious, as if getting Cas to parrot back Crowley’s words is of the utmost importance. Crowley looks up at him with a raised eyebrow, but doesn’t interrupt.
Dean’s warm breath tickles his neck as he speaks. “Just having some fun. Just stay still,
. That’s the most important thing. He can give up things like privacy and pride for a week,
“Happy to see me?” He hangs his overcoat on a hook as if nothing’s amiss. Cas’ still silent from shock as Dean saunters into the living room, firmly locking the door behind him.
Dean’s smiling face pops into his head. He can’t give up, no matter what he’s put through.
Without another word, Dean strides out the front door. Cas listens to Baby peel out as he pulls a blanket over himself, too worn out to bother showering before sleeping. With a promise to himself that he’ll do it before morning, he slips off.
Dean’s standing over the unconscious man he’d been fighting, expression blank. He turns slowly at Cas’ voice with a smile on his face.
“Damn,” Dean’s voice is a near growl. “You’re just eating it up, huh? You like that?” Cas squeezes his eyes shut and forces himself to answer honestly.
“It feels strange. Invasive.” His voice is high with strain. He cries out softly as Dean’s fingers pick up a quick, stinging pace. He instinctively tries to shut his legs, but the bar holds them wide open. He lifts his head to find Dean staring down at his own fingers sliding into his hole. The humiliation forces a flush to spread across his cheeks. He drops his head and stares up at the dark-painted ceiling.
while the man he loves (and lusts after) is slowly jerking him off through his clothes. While it’s physically pleasurable, it multiplies his shame tenfold. He just feels so
Cas lies on the bed, spread out and sore. As the afterglow of his orgasm fades, the shame rolls back in. He can’t help but picture himself: begging, hard, and ultimately
“Thought we’d get away for a little while.” Dean’s sharp grin makes Cas take another step back. “Have a little fun.”
Dean rubs himself through his pants. Somehow, inflicting such
Cas reaches out and grasps his hand. After one more moment of hesitation, he gives a firm handshake. He won’t, no he
He makes eye contact with himself in the mirror and whispers a promise.
“I, ah, I am.” Dean’s quick, tight strokes are making his orgasm edge closer every second. “Oh, Dean.”
Crowley leans in until he’s speaking into Cas’ open mouth. “Don’t forget who’s playing with you right now.” He presses against him, forcing him to walk backwards until they hit the bed. Crowley shoves him onto the bed and pulls his jeans off. Cas follows Crowley’s gesture to scoot up the bed until he’s nestled comfortably in the pillows. He glances to the side as Crowley strips off his jacket and and rolls up his sleeves. Dean catches his eye and blows him a kiss. Not quite the reassurance Cas’d been hoping for, but it’ll have to do.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty. You slept so long I had to come make sure you weren’t dead.”
Crowley murmurs, softly, “You mustn’t be rude, pet.” Cas knows well that it’s a farce of kindness.
“I’m sure you haven’t done this before.” Dean’s voice is only slightly muffled by the table. “At least you better haven’t,” His fingers tighten enough that it must hurt. “So I’m gonna lead you through it, show you what I like.”
“Y-you did, Dean.” Cas’ voice breaks on a particularly brutal thrust.
Sorry about the wait! Hopefully this extra long chapter with a bonus character will make up for it ;^)
“Good thing the walls are thick, ‘cuz you just can’t shut up, huh?” Dean’s words are harsh, but they barely register past the pleasure of his cock grinding deep inside him. He whimpers against Dean’s painfully tight grip. “
Dean’s sharp voice cuts through the quiet. “Thank for reminding me to make the most out of these
“You need to come with me, Dean.” His words come out tinged with desperation. He’d wanted to sound strong, but their separation has affected him even more than he had realized. Dean’s death and rebirth as a demon has been such a painful, lonely experience. Sam and Hannah have been there for him, but no one can replace Dean in his heart. Just seeing him again nearly takes his breath away.
“I’m- I’m going to cum for you, Dean.”
.” Cas wraps a desperate hand around his aching cock. He jerks himself off as Dean resumes fucking him. He’s on the edge in mere seconds, the combination of Dean’s pounding cock and his own hand forcing him there even quicker than he’d expected.
“An angel huh? You like being with other angels, don’t you?” Cas’ fear is replaced with anger at the derision in Dean’s voice. He sets a hand on Dean’s chest and tries to push him away. He’s too weak to move him at all.
Cas rubs his eyes, just how long had he slept? He looks around the room, but there’s no clock in sight. Dean laughs softly.
“Want me to jerk you?” Dean’s voice is pitched low, gravelly with arousal. He squeezes Cas’ cock, not quite hard enough to hurt. Cas’ desperate whimper makes his hand move faster on his own cock. He slides a teasing finger up and down Cas’ until he abruptly breaks.
, don’t you? Now, just
Crowley’s quiet voice floats over to him. “Think he likes it. I’m impressed by how much progress he’s made in, what, three days? You’ve got a real talent for this.” Humiliation flushes his skin. They’re sitting just feet away from him, shamelessly talking about him like he’s some kind of
“You alright?” Dean’s voice jolts Cas out of his stupor.
“What is this? What am I doing?” He murmurs to himself, quietly so Dean can’t hear even if he’s still in the room. He reminds himself that he’s doing this so he can get Dean
“That’s different...”
let this opportunity slip away. He’ll do whatever it takes.
“-ey.”
“Dean?” Cas takes a step back, away from the men.
“Three of your fingers are as big as my entire hand? Don’t flatter yourself.”
“Please, Dean. I’ll be good. So good for you.” He turns his pleading gaze on the man above him. He seems unmoved. Cas can’t hold back a sob. Tears wet his face as he cries from desperation.
to save Dean and he meant it. Although he’d never admit it, he’s a little glad that it’s someone he knows, rather than some random demon Dean’d met.
, but he hadn’t been expecting such violence.
before, but having Dean do it? It’s so much more painful.
“Glad we can agree on so much these days.” Crowley turns his attention to Cas. “And I must say,” A sneer spreads across his face. “
“I- I don’t know. It’s strange.” Cas’ overwhelmed, unsure of what he’s feeling. “It’s big.”
“Please, Dean!” He clenches his hands hard on the bedframe. If he were at full power, the metal would warp and bend. As it is, his desperation has no affect on anything but himself. Dean’s taunting fingers combine with the ever-moving machine to bring his need to near agony. “Please, Dean, let me come.”
“Didn’t he tell you to get going? I didn’t hear a ‘stop.’”
“That feel good, angel?” Dean’s voice is rough from both sleep and arousal. Cas nods up at him. It’s not a lie, the pleasure is building up in him despite the sharp edge of pain. Dean’s chuckle is breathless. He leans down and kisses Cas, slips his tongue in his accommodating mouth. The intimate act brings Cas’ arousal to a boil, he whimpers into Dean’s mouth as he makes a mess of Dean’s still-stoking hand.
“Just hold still, angel.” He slices a straight line, watches the blood bead up from it. Cas’ soft cry of pain is like music to his ears. He adds a longer, curved line to his design. Cas grits his teeth. Sure, he’d been sliced up before,
Cas’ head snaps to the side. His cheek throbs from the strength of the slap. But what hurts more is the increasingly loud rasp of Dean rubbing himself through his jeans. Crowley shoves him back down and yanks his underwear off without so much as a warning.
Cas’ hands still on his top shirt button. He takes a moment to take a deep breath and steel himself before slowly working his way thought the buttons, letting the shirt fall open bit by bit. He can feel Dean’s eyes working their way down his exposed chest and stomach. Dean’s attention feels like it’s branding his skin, his catcalls deafeningly loud. He sheds his shirt and reaches for his pants button.
settles warm in his gut. To his amazement, he realizes that he’s getting hard.
“One sec.” Dean leaves the bedroom and returns a few moments later with an armful of folded clothes. Cas takes them apprehensively, he’s half expecting them to be something perverted. Instead, he’s greeted with what appears to be some of Dean’s clothes. Blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and blue boxer briefs.
The last thing that Cas sees before the door is closed are Dean’s eyes sliding down to get one more look at his lube-slick ass.
.” His trails his hand down Cas’ chest, his fingers dragging over the fabric. “And to think I was gonna go easy on you.” A chill runs down Cas’ spine. It turns to a full body jolt as the knife slips under the neckline of his borrowed t-shirt, icy on his overheated skin. It yanks upwards, tearing through the fabric like it’s nothing. Cas whimpers in fear. He doesn’t want to look weak in front of Dean, especially not when he’s like
The thought is knocked from his mind as Crowley’s knuckles press against his rim. It’s not the brutal invasion that he’d been expecting, but it still stings.
Dean’s voice shifts into a growl. “Under. The. Table.” He grabs a handful of Cas’ hair and forcefully guides him into position between his spread knees. He opens his belt and unzips, Cas’ heart quickens as Dean slips his half-filled cock through his underwear and strokes it slowly. He watches with rapt attention as Dean’s fingers work himself to full hardness.
on Cas is almost as arousing as fucking him. He doesn’t bother trying to cut through the jeans, just pulls them off and throws them towards the corner of the room. He slowly slides the knife under the elastic of Cas’ underwear.
.” He sets his hand on the other man’s shoulder, casually, as if they often touch each other.
be ready. He wants to keep Cas.
“Ah, I love it when you say my name like that.” Dean’s praise makes Cas’ arousal swell up inside him until the dam breaks. He gasps and lets out a shuddering moan as he makes a mess of Dean’s hand. He shivers helplessly in Dean’s arms as his hand slows and comes to a stop. Cas turns his head to watch as Dean licks his cum off his hand with a deep groan.
Dean groans appreciatively. “That’s real nice, babe. Been waiting forever for this.” He steps forward and runs a single finger down Cas’ chest. He veers to the side to pinch a nipple and chuckles at Cas’ flinch. He runs his hand around until it rests on his lower back and uses it for leverage to pull Cas in and peck him on the lips.
Dean’s hand slowly pushes his head down. He accommodates his cock the best he can, but he can’t help but gag when it slips too deep. He’s about to pull off and apologize when his head’s shoved down further, making him retch.
“Please Dean, let me cum. Please.” Cas knows how much Dean loves it when he begs. He repeats
to him. A shudder runs through him at the memory of the machine taking him, Dean pleasuring himself to his abasement. He can’t quite brush off he arousal warming his groin, but he can try to ignore it.
“You almost done in there?” Dean’s voice carries through the bathroom door.
Cas is left alone in the small, but nice room. He looks around and is only slightly shocked by the state of it. There are various concerning things scattered around. A large, sturdy hook attached to the ceiling, a shelf with several bdsm implements displayed proudly on it, and even the bed has bondage hook-ups along the headboard and footboard. He opens the closet and chest of drawers and isn’t surprised by the many toys and bondage equipment.
Dean slips away from him for a moment so he can push him onto his back. Cas doesn’t contend the manhandling, just falls into position. Dean pulls Cas’ pants and underwear completely off, but only slides his own down his thighs. He straddles Cas’ legs so he can wrap his hand around them both. The dry friction makes Cas wince. Dean laughs, lighthearted in a way that makes Cas smile despite the ever-present unpleasantness of his situation, and grabs a tube of lube from the bedside table. He slicks up their cocks and sets a quick, rough pace. It’s a little much for Cas, almost painful, but he doesn’t complain. He just watches the way Dean’s head tilts back in pleasure. He can tell that Dean enjoys the slight pain and files the information away for later.
does these things for him?
in front Crowley is a deeply uncomfortable experience for him. He sighs and yanks his t-shirt over his head. No sense in dallying, he knows it won’t change anything.
“Yes, Dean.” After a moment of consideration he whispers, “Thank you.”
what Dean and Crowley had done to him. Never, in a million years, could he have predicted this. And never, in a million years, will he forget it.
to, an escape method might end up being necessary.
, per se, but the whole thing feels... off. Dean had been strange. Moody. Cas lays his hand over his heart, the fresh cuts throb under the bandages. While Dean had left without a word, he also left a first aid kit and fresh clothes laid out on the bed.
“Dean?” Cas shifts to move up with him but Dean’s hand comes down heavily between his shoulder blades. He doesn’t resist the rough hand, lets Dean shove him down flat. The position leaves him uncomfortably restrained, with much of Dean’s weight pressing down on his spine, and the rest on his sore thighs, but he doesn’t complain.
Dean’s gone by the time Cas wakes in the morning. He flops over onto his back and lets out a deep sigh. He has to admit to himself that he’d enjoyed the previous night, Dean’s arm wrapped around his middle, his head nestled under Dean’s chin. He’d stayed awake long after Dean’s breathing had slowed. He’d breathed in his scent, enjoyed the sensation of their bodies pressed close. Like that, he’d almost been able to pretend that Dean hadn’t done such
, and you won’t get hurt.” He slides the knife down to Cas throat. He keeps it flat against his skin, lessening the chance of accidentally cutting him. “But if you fight me, I might have to punish you. With how you are right now, even just a few nicks would do the trick.” His voice drops low. “Or maybe I could carve my name. I’d like that, my name in your skin.
Tw for a mention of (implied) suicide.
“Oh, Dean. Dean!” Cas only realizes that he’s crying when a tear slides into his mouth. He sniffles, presses his face into the sheets. Dean barks out a callous laugh above him.
in it. He knows that Dean’s compliments are really thinly veiled insults, but it leaves a warm feeling in his gut. Part shame, but mostly arousal. He cries out on a particularly brutal thrust that shoves deep enough to hurt. Dean must like the pleading tone in his voice, because he repeats the movement until Cas is trying to squirm away.
“Yeah, isn’t this what I wanted?” Dean turns away, his back to Cas. “Isn’t it?” His shoulders are held tense. His head lowered.
“Nice, nice, the pants too.” Cas stands so he can slip the jeans off and gets back into position without being prompted. Dean’s lips curl in a sneer. With his teeth bared like that, Cas gets that feeling of being prey again. Prey that’s about to be eaten.
“Dean...” His name always sounds so sensual in that gravelly voice, it’s enough to send him over the edge. He groans low in his throat as he cums on Cas’ parted lips. He rubs his thumb over Cas’ messed mouth as he comes down. He presses his slick thumb onto Cas tongue, rubs the taste into it. Cas stares up at him with wide eyes, breath coming in little pants.
“I said-” Dean’s eyes flash black. “Go on.”
Dean is silent.
“Are these...?”
“I’m gonna teach you about something.” Dean’s smile promises danger.
“Aren’t you supposed to be doing whatever I say?” Dean seats himself and waves towards the cupboards. “Bread’s in there.”
“Why?” Cas leaves the
clothes?”
“We’re gonna do something a little different today, angel.” Dean’s voice is low and breathy against Cas’ ear. His hands abandon his gentle groping in favor of pulling something from his jean’s pocket. Cas tenses as the thick black blindfold slips securely over his eyes. He can’t see a thing. “All you need to do is sit still and stay calm... if you can.” The words strike Cas with a pang of fear. He’s quickly found that Dean’s
“It... hurts, a bit. I’m alright.” Cas pulls at his bonds without thinking. They prove to be much stronger than him in his current form.
Cas gasps. The cold metal’s pressed to his groin. He’d been hoping that Dean’d spare him this, but no such luck. He’d knowingly angered him and now he’s suffering the consequences. He’s grateful for how slowly the blade cuts the fabric, less room for error, but at the same time he wishes it’d be over already. Even without seeing him, he can tell that Dean’s enjoying himself. The blade isn’t working efficiently, it’s sliding all over his skin as it cuts the fabric. Caressing him. In his mind, the hands from his dream turn to shiny silver blades, glinting in the low light of the abyss he’d been trapped in.
Dean’s broad grin unnerves him.
Dean winks playfully. “Good doing business with you.” Cas huffs in annoyance, which just makes Dean laugh. “Kidding, kidding. Now, it’s getting late, huh? I figure we should start tomorrow.”
“I’m not saying that.” Dean’s smirk returns and he lets go of Cas’ chin. He leans back and continues driving down the dilapidated road. “But-” Cas considers his words for a moment. “This doesn’t feel right. Not while you’re... like this.”
There’s no warning before it speeds up, a strangled groan momentarily covers the sound of the machine moving. The slick slide of the toy inside him makes Cas’ blood burn hot. The burning in his hole is slowly being overtaken by an unfamiliar pleasure.
“Shouldn’t make assumptions, angel.” Dean’s snicker slips through Crowley’s statement. “I’m not going to fuck you... not tonight at least. I am however, going to see how much that little hole can stretch. Like I said,” His eyes flash red, threatening. “I’m here to give you some much needed training.” Cas looks to Dean, silently pleading with him. Dean winks at him and pulls Crowley into another kiss.
. Dean’s hand slips down his thigh, onto his straining erection. It startles a cry out of him. The hand stays still, just lightly gripping him. He has no leverage to thrust up into it, so he grits his teeth and bares it.
.” Dean grabs him by his arm and pulls him around the corner of the building. Cas is too weak to put up much struggle, although he’s not sure that he would anyway. He can’t stand the thought of leaving Dean now that he’s found him. Dean shoves him roughly into the car parked behind the building.
need to come with
that, you
“Ah- huh?” Cas wakes slowly, confused. “Dean?” He feels an arm tighten around his waist and a hand rubbing him through his pants. A low moan in a familiar voice answers him. He can feel Dean’s erection rubbing against his ass through the layers of their clothes. Cas can’t help but get hard, can’t help the arousal that burns through him as he thinks of Dean taking pleasure from touching his sleeping body. It should feel like an invasion, being felt up and rutted against while unaware, but it’s
to get you back.”
“Dean- Dean, please! I-” He squeezes his eyes shut, overwhelmed.
“Deaaan-” His name draws out into a moan as the machine begins pressing deeper. It’s still painful, but Cas’ surprised by how little he minds. His gut feels warm and tight with arousal as the toy pounds him. He picks up on the slick noise of his wet hole over the grinding of the machine’s movement. Embarrassment sends a new flood of blood into his burning face.
“Almost done in there?” Dean’s voice carries through the bathroom door. Cas sucks in a deep breath and opens the door.
“Ahh,
is clearly visible. It takes a moment to make out what follows it in blood, but it makes his stomach turn when when he figures it out.
“That’s better.” Dean’s hand slides down his front, taking a moment to tweak one of his nipples hard enough to make him whimper, and loosely grabs his cock.
“That’s real nice. Now lick it. Nice and slow.” Cas complies almost instantly this time, the orders are starting to feel more natural to him. He slides his tongue from root to tip. Tasting Dean like this makes his mind go fuzzy with pleasure despite the rest of the situation. How long had he dreamt of this?
Cas’ hand automatically comes up to rest on the
“You wanna cum on his fist?” Dean’s voice is low, even for him. He reaches out and runs a finger up Cas’ cock. Cas’ hips jerk towards the stimulation. Dean’s other hand moves to hold his hips down, to keep him from hurting himself.
Dean’s expression turning taunting. “Riiight. Well, whatever. Sleep ok?” He pats Cas’ thigh.
“Crowley.” Cas says it quietly, he doesn’t want to admit what his eyes are seeing.
.” Dean reseats himself on Cas’ legs, takes in the sight of his heaving, sated body. He releases Cas’ softening cock and resumes jerking his own. He’s pleasantly surprised by Cas shyly reaching out and running his fingertips over the head of his cock. He moans low in his throat, grabs Cas’ hand and presses it beneath his own. He forces Cas’ hand into the pace he prefers before letting go and leaning back over him. He kisses Cas’ neck, making him suck in a surprised breath. Dean drinks in his soft whimpers as he nips and licks his way up to his mouth.
“I love it.” He has to force his voice above a whisper.
Crowley winks at him. “Why, thank you.” Cas would roll his eyes if he had mental capacity to do so. He feels full to bursting, his insides stretched tight. The hand shifting slightly deeper makes him whimper. Crowley edges it in more, keeping a careful eye on Cas’ reactions. He doesn’t try to form an actual fist, he knows that the girth of his relaxed hand is almost too much on it’s own. He slides it outwards until the flare of his wrist catches. Cas tosses his head back into the pillow with a breathy cry. The slow thrust in has him clutching the sheets with a whine.
Cas gapes at him. What kind of question is that? He considers what kind of response he could give when all his thoughts are knocked from his head by Dean pressing a forceful kiss to his lips.
lasts longer than him, but it’s the worst when he fucks him like this, leaving him sore and over-sensitive.
“Now, now, now. You’re not thinking on running out on me, are you Cas?” Dean turns to stare into his eyes, despite the cars continued movement.
“Go on. Take them off.” Cas’ been avoiding looking directly at Dean’s face, but he can
Dean’s silent throughout the first few minutes of the drive. Cas tries to speak several times, but Dean just shushes him every time. Cas glances at the door handle. While he doesn’t really
“Oh, yeah. That’s real nice.” Cas opens his eyes to find Dean biting his lip, looking extremely pleased. “Alright, get yourself off. I wanna feel you cum on my cock.”
“Mmm, did that feel good, angel?”
“Whore.” Crowley throws the familiar insult with ease. The playful punch Dean lands on his arm only makes him laugh. “
like that not many people have seen you like this.” He leans in close, pressing their bodies together. He grabs Cas’ chin to keep eye contact. “I guess I’m just possessive like that.”
He’s whimpering, his voice higher than he realized it could go. If he was with anyone else he would be embarrassed, but he can
“Go ahead, wanna feel your hole squeezing my cock.” Dean’s filthy words shove him over the edge. He gasps and goes stock still as his cock pulses. Dean doesn’t slow, ruthlessly fucks him through it. As Cas comes down, he realizes his mistake. Now he’ll have to endure the overstimulation of Dean using him to get off. Dean
Cas’ brain shorts out for a moment. He thinks over Crowley’s words, thinking that perhaps he misheard.
thrusting. Cas clenches his hands in the sheets as the idea that  settles in his head. It’s filthy. Extreme and vulgar and somehow arousing. The idea that something so unbelievable is happening just because
Dean grabs the shorn edges of the shirt and easily tears it fully open. He uses the knife on the sleeves and lets the ruined shirt fall off of Cas. He yanks the fabric out from under him and tosses it aside. He pauses the take in the sight.
“You’ll see.” Dean grabs the lube from the bedside table and sits on the end of the bed. He reaches out and runs his fingertips up Cas’ inner thigh. Cas sucks in a surprised breath, Dean’s touch is always electric. “You’re gonna like this. Well, you might not at first, but you’ll learn to like it.” He slicks his fingers before rubbing them gently over Cas’ exposed hole. Cas shudders, he’d been expecting this, but the bondage and thinly veiled threat has him on edge. He takes slow, deep breaths as one of Dean’s finger slides slowly into him. It feels strange, somewhat unpleasant. He’d never allowed himself to try things like this when experimenting with himself. It’d felt wrong somehow. Now he’s wishing that he had, so he’d be more prepared for the sensation of Dean wedging a second finger in him. It burns, but he’s just grateful that Dean had decided to prepare him at all.
. it’s the idea of him bringing other people here. Cas flops back on the bed, the exhaustion of the bizarre day suddenly sinking in. He toes his shoes off and doesn’t even bother to take his trench coat off before slipping into a fitful sleep.
“You should come see this.” Crowley crooks a finger at Dean. He oozes self-satisfaction. Dean hefts himself out of his chair, pauses to press an oddly chaste kiss to Cas’ lips before retaking his position next to Crowley. A smile spreads across his face as he looks down at the result of Crowley’s work. Cas tries to press his legs together, humiliation flooding back into him. Dean and Crowley each grab one of his knees, keeping him open and exposed to their gaze.
“No, I don’t have the energy for this. Get your ass up, we’re leaving now” and with that she storms off.
So he says nothing, but glances at the doctor’s fingers. It was nice having them in his mouth, maybe without gloves…
“The black car, is it your Baby?”
Castiel pops open the hood and stays on the side of the car, watching as Dean inspects its insides.
“An American Pale Ale for Doctor Novak, and an iced tea for Mrs Novak. Burgers will be out in ten minutes, I’m sorry for the waiting but Ellen and Ash are doing their best.” Dean says while putting down two cardboard coasters, the drinks and some snacks, then smiles apologetically and nods, already turning to walk away.
The brunette woman laughs at that, a whole-body laugh.
“Dean?”
The other man is already preparing a flashlight and an under car trolley next to the Continental, but waits until Castiel turns it off and gets out before sliding under it.
He has six days to freak out.
Bobby had been surprisingly easy to deal with, his only comment had been
They get up and walk to the bar counter to say bye to Jo, who gives Dean a knowing smirk and a wink once the doctor is not looking. He flips her off, smiling innocently.
“Huh, yeah, I’m doing my best. We don’t want any cavities, right?” Dean replies with a little laugh.
“What a coincidence! He works here, who would’ve thought!” Meg feigned innocence, but Castiel doesn’t fall for it. He knows her too well and her tells were not hidden like usual, so it was clear that she wanted him to know.
If Castiel thought that Dean’s body was the only interesting thing about him, in the short amount of time they spent together he was proved wrong.
It takes a moment to kick back online and he removes his hands from the other man’s mouth to exchange the tools he was using with the ones he needs to remove the cavities. He sends a silent prayer to Dean, telling him to stop, but telepathy still isn’t in his skillset, so his prayer goes unanswered.
Forty-five minutes later they’re sitting in a booth, waiting for Jo to take their orders. It looks like it’s a busy night so they’ll probably have to wait longer than usual. They kill time on their phone, both used so much to the other person that there’s no need to fill the silence with mindless chatting.
“Hey, it’s not like I planned on hitting on the dude. I didn't know
“I have your number. Well, no, technically I don’t, it’s in your record at work but I can-”
"You know any constellations, Doc?"
romantically involved with me in any way.” he feels suddenly very warm under Dean’s eyes, who looks embarrassed and two seconds away from bolting.
“Dean? What is this?”
Truth is.
Looks like the gruff man is not alone today. Hopefully it’s one of his employees used to the scoldings.
“Oh, yes. Although mine are more around reading books and drinking tea with my Father and learning languages with my Mother. He was a writer, she was a teacher.”
“Meg, listen-”
“Look who’s here! Drinking or eating?”
“Huh, I guess I did, sorry. Didn’t sleep much last night and this new project sucked me in. What d’you got there?”
“Nothing out of the ordinary. Can I take a look inside? If after that we can’t solve this mystery, we should call the Scooby Gang, ‘cause she’s definitely cursed.”
guess what. doc’s gay.
“Doctor Novak! What can I get you?”
“What can I talk about then? No ex, no finger licking, no Dean, which is stupid since he’s our waiter, am I missing something? What do you want to talk about? Work? I don’t want to hear about Adler’s periodontitis or the dental implant that Marv can’t seem to keep intact for more than three weeks! Aren’t you tired of being this boring before your 40s?” she snaps, and Castiel shuts up.
"You missed out big time, doc. But now you know the error of your ways, and you can also try their other pies!"
But Charlie doesn’t speak so he takes a peek, opening one eye, and Dean sees his best friend of fourteen years trying not to laugh. As soon as she sees his face morphing into an annoyed scowl she totally loses it.
“That kid reminds me of when I worked here during college. He’s a lot smarter than I am, though, he’s 18 and he’s a sophomore. At 18 I was still wondering how to tell my parents that I wanted to study interior design!”
"I have an idea of something that I'd like to do more."
“Well I don’t anymore! It was an accident, okay? I know he’s hot but I’m not that dumb! I didn’t actively try to harass him! God, how can I go there next month for the checkup?”
“Don’t hurt yourself, Castiel. I heard you, I won’t touch your boy toy.” she picks up a stray piece of mushroom from the plate and flicks it at him. It lands on his half eaten burger.
“You’re gross.” Sam chuckles with a grimace and digs in, and for a couple of minutes they’re too busy eating to engage in small talk.
Yes, he knows the other man gets flustered easily, and loves his car and pie a bit too much, that was easy, but Castiel could’ve never imagined Dean as the carefree nerd sitting in front of him.
He clears his throat to catch their attention when he gets there, and as soon as he sees the doctor’s blue eyes become bigger he wishes he could disappear. Still, he puts on his customer service smile and tries to be a professional.
“Well,
” he winches as he pushes away the phone.
Cas smiles almost shyly for a second, then one hand smacks Dean’s ass.
“So, how did the appointment go yesterday? You’re good to eat pie?”
“I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but you have to stop! He’s a patient, Meg. I told you.”
“Hello, Mr. Singer. I don’t know what happened but... it doesn’t go faster than 20 mph!”
“Cas here will have the BBQ and a Stout, for me the usual but with a Lager.”
“Save your breath, Meg. He didn’t show up. Is it closing time?” one hand rubs his face, suddenly feeling tired.
Castiel groans and rolls on his back, watching the ceiling instead of her face.
Castiel is almost vibrating with nervousness and he hopes that Dean won’t notice.
Castiel had never had a strong opinion on pie, but right this moment he kind of hates it because it’s the cavities’ fault that he’s going to put his hands into Mr Winchester's mouth again.
"Then yes, I would like to say this was our first date."
“Ya think? Hey, at least car’s good for now!” Dean’s laughing again.
!” it’s Dean’s turn to become a tomato now, and he can’t even protest because it’s the truth.
Conversation, while frequently interrupted by both of their jobs, flowed easily.
“Well, huh he- he said something about us being strangers or whatever and I- well, I said
the creep?” Sam is incredulous.
He wipes a hand on his face and pockets the phone, right on time as Ash deposits two burgers in front of him, saying “Table 14’s order.”
“When was the last time you went out with someone that’s not from the clinic or your brother or Bal?” she knows the answer already, it feels like when your teacher in high school asked you a trick question knowing full well that you were not paying attention.
“I hope it won’t be the last time that happens."
Dean explains what he wants to do under Baby’s hood and Bobby gives his input, suggesting what should be done more urgently even if he knows the younger man won’t listen, having his plan already made.
Dean parks in the back, away from potential threats to his Baby, and being the gentleman that he is, he opens the door to let Cas walk in first into the bar. It’s not because he wants to ogle the other man’s ass, absolutely not, how dare you.
“You want me to list you the menu?”
"I don't want this to end, trust me, but if I don't sleep in the next ten minutes I'm going to die. Believe me when I say that there's nothing I'd like more than driving around in Baby."
Sam gives him his
and- and then he had
And that’s when Castiel freezes, because the man he was perving on is Dean Winchester. The bowlegs now definitely make more sense.
he expected.
"Yeah, it involves less talking, but more lips moving."
“You sure? I swear I heard something about a mouth being occupied for twenty minutes. That’s a looot of time, Clarence!” her smile is teasing as she leans on the door frame, and if Meg wasn’t his friend before being the resident orthodontist, he would’ve had to fire her a long time ago for inappropriate behavior at work.
. He realizes he’s perving on a stranger, and he really shouldn’t perv on a stranger but there’s something about those legs…
The meeting goes fairly well, the house he has to redecorate with Benny, his partner at Winchester & Lafitte Renovations, has good bones and the style the owners want is one of his favorites. It's a two story house, with a basement and a garage, three rooms, two bathrooms, a big open floor kitchen with a living room. He can definitely work with that. The front and back yards are gonna need all of Benny’s knowledge on landscaping though. They’re gonna do amazing and he’s very excited.
, thank you, Dean. And a beer, whatever you have on tap. Meg?” Novak answers before she can, with a stony face that’s so different from the tiny friendly smiles the doctor was sharing before.
Being at the Roadhouse relaxes him enough to try and enjoy every second of this dinner. It kind of feels like a date, but he won’t push his luck asking Dean if it really is a date.
youve never met him tf you saying?
"Sweet." he's smiling dumbly, and Cas' intense gaze softens with another kind of warmth that resembles affection.
Then Cas steps into the building and Dean drives home, smiling the whole way.
” he says, stressing the title “it’s
, well, it makes him hope.
nerd.”
“Yeah and I meant you have to keep your hands, or well,  your tongue,” Dean flips him the finger “to yourself! You just have to face him and show him you’re not… restraining order material!”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
“Dad thought I was going to study mechanical engineering and design cars. Mom wanted for me to do something that made me happy, so she wasn’t a problem to begin with. But yeah, Dad had some ideas and I was scared I’d disappoint him. Turns out I was worried about nothing, ‘cause the old man didn’t bat an eye. He said they’d be my first customers once I graduated.”
“Thanks man” he puts the plates on the tray, turns around and carefully opens the door with the elbow, walking to table 14 like he didn’t just discover one of the most interesting things about the blue eyed doctor.
“But it’s Doctor Novak! With his wife or fiancée or whatever the hell she is! I can’t serve them!” Dean followed him inside, trying his best at using his puppy dog eyes.
He’s almost done and he just wants to stretch and go back home to take a long hot shower, a stranger won’t distract him from his plans.
“Well, thank you, Dean. I- I feel very stupid right now. I should have checked that before coming here.” he chuckles, unsure of what to do with his hands. He’s fidgeting.
how to live a little?
"C'mon, get here. It gets cold quickly, we gotta huddle together to keep warm." he spreads his arms and laughs when the doctor scrambles to sit next to him.
“Why? Because you outed me to a patient?”
“Heya Doc! Car problems?”
Dean bites back a smile at the excitement of his little brother, trying to keep a scowl as he unwraps his burger and- okay, the smell is not that bad. Maybe this hippie crap will be good.
They stand there, eyes locked into each other. It’s Dean who breaks the silence.
can score a date with Ken Doll. He’s not one of my patients, after all.” Meg flashes him a sly smile.
good! JO! We have to call Sam
Dean reluctantly draws back but Cas just follows him and gets busy kissing and nibbling his neck, his hands groping Dean’s ass.
Meg is right, he knows that. He knows that he’s always been considered boring and reclusive, preferring the company of books to people’s. He knows that since they set up the clinic he’s been working hard, but since Mick… well, since Mick broke up with him a couple of years ago he just drowned himself in work. To not think, ironically.
“Oh, so
“Oh Dean- you’ve exceeded yourself this time!” she’s still laughing “So he’s hot, huh?”
And it was his own idea to have dinner together so if he wants it to be a date, it can be a date, right?
He still keeps up a front for his brother, eyeing suspiciously at his food before taking a bite. Sam is hyper focused on him, so he needs to dull his reaction as he chews.
“Okay, open wide, now,” he smiles under his mask as Dean complies.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, then?”
They finish eating the pie silently, then they have a brief argument over who has to pay and settle it with Cas paying the food and Dean tipping (and because it's Kevin he leaves a few dollars more).
“I’ll have you know I go out plenty. I run every day and at least once every month I go to that bee farm outside town! Pardon me if I'm usually too tired to do anything else.” this time he really grabs a couple of peanuts, but decides to eat them and not waste them on Meg.
“Four other than English. I know German, French, Italian and… Quenya.”
“I found a new place that makes vegetarian burgers,” Dean grimaces at that “and a delicious organic blueberry pie.” Sam smirks, satisfied at his brother’s change of expression.
"Hey, fuck you, I was fifteen! I obviously stopped when I grew up. I had other methods then." he wiggles his eyebrows.
He won't regret it.
None of them move, they just stare at each other, smiling.
“Why are you, Bal and Gabe so interested in my love life? I don’t have time to date around, and if I ‘make my moves’ on every attractive male patient we take, we’re gonna be jobless in a couple of months.” his eyes track down a stray droplet of condensation on the glass’ side.
“Then I’ll do my best to be polite. My car, on the other hand… I guess it really is time to scrap it. It’s starting to cost me more than what Mr. Singer pays me at the clinic.”
“Hello, Dean. And hello to you too, Baby.” he strokes the dashboard gently and Dean knows he’s just fallen in love.
Instead he drinks some of his beer, the taste is slightly bitter but refreshing and he enjoys it very much, and thinks.
Cas takes a couple more forkfuls of pie, eating those normally. Dick.
It’s not like he has a long maxillary sinus lift in the morning, one dental work appointment (because the dental hygienist got sick at the last minute and they didn’t have the time to call the stand-in), and two other patients in the afternoon before Dean.
He can't help but laugh, throwing his head back. It takes a while to calm himself, and when he sees Cas again he’s rewarded with the most beautiful gummy smile the doctor has shown him.
She gives him her usual
Bobby doesn’t speak much and once Dean’s in the zone he forgets everything except the movements of his hands and what needs to be done. It’s the same when he’s busy looking up throw pillows or lamps or helping the contractors with installing the cabinets in a kitchen. He just loses himself in what he’s doing and tunes out the world.
As he puts them on, he hears Alfie’s voice, his assistant in training, leading someone into the room. Castiel takes a long breath and steadies himself before greeting the man who’s been haunting his thoughts.
” his raised voice alerts Kevin, who approaches them while rolling his eyes.
So what if he just didn't want to meet Cas there (he doesn't even know where there is) and there is no way he would sit inside the Continental once again. He's got standards.
A throat clearing makes Castiel look up and what he sees it’s not
Still, he’s sure he managed to not do anything stupid or inappropriate, but why does it feel like something happened anyway? Novak all ramble-y was kind of cute, but why did that happen?
He was so focused on being grumpy and annoyed that he didn’t notice that they were trying to help, especially after Mick.
was faulty from the beginning and the previous owner knew.
It’s been almost five years now, and he still hasn’t been off work more than he absolutely has to.
It’s bothersome, but safer.
“Then,
Castiel only knows he is tired of overthinking and worrying over what could happen.
“Oh, please, angel. You know it’s not that, you’re just being an idiot! As he is, clearly. Who else sees a man and a woman together and automatically thinks they’re married? Idiots. And homophobes. I did you a favor, you should thank me.” she rolls her eyes, taking a sip of her cold drink after she’s done with her little speech.
Whatever happened earlier at Novak’s clinic has fried his last standing braincell, maybe. The others were gone as soon as he saw the doctor’s leg wrapped in very tight pants. He tried not to look at him but one glance was enough and now that image is burned in his mind.
“Okay.”
He sees the blush from the alcohol spread on Cas’ cheeks. He looks adorable.
“Don’t talk about Mick.” he sends her a warning look and Meg throws up her hands.
“Oh. Right, you don’t know.” he groans and sinks into the chair “I didn’t go. I didn’t want to embarrass myself further, or really harass the guy. Yeah, yeah, keep the bitchface away, bitch. I was at the Roadhouse and Jo made me work, I couldn’t have gone anyway. But I think the universe or God hates me, because guess who showed up at one of my tables?”
after work too!” she turns around and walks into her office without waiting for an answer.
“HEY! I do not use my dick as a brain!”
. What did you do?”
“You see the floor mat? Come closer. See that? See how it’s way higher than it should be?”
“Thanks Kev!”
While he’s grocery shopping (his fridge is empty and as much as he doesn’t want to cook, being super tired, he doesn’t want to order in or eat another frozen pizza) he keeps telling himself that next time he’ll be super extra careful, and luckily there’s two months to try and build back the stupid filter.
His ex boyfriend wanted to travel, to show Castiel where he grew up in Great Britain, show him the places he visited in Europe.
“This is me. Thanks for the ride, Dean. I enjoyed it very much, Baby is truly a beautiful car.”
He doesn’t remember to swallow before letting out an offended “I haven’t done anything!” and a bit of eggplant flies from his mouth to the table. He picks it up and eats it again, Sam looks disgusted and Dean grins.
It’s been a month since the last time Castiel saw Dean Winchester, but just like the previous time he couldn’t stop thinking about him.
It's definitely a date.
“You do know your beers! I’m curious about the BBQ-Stout combo now, so I think I'll have that. Thank you, Dean.”
well?” Dean slides out from under the car, grinning. Is he joking around with Castiel?
“You’re no fun Clarence. Fine, as you wish.” her smile is suspicious, but Castiel doesn’t press it, the promise of burgers is too enticing.
“Hey, she might be old, whimsical and nothing like my Baby, but she’s still a lady. C’mon!”
“You’re a dense idiot, but we care about you. Now, are you really against dipping your fingers in Ken Doll’s mouth again because he’s a patient, or because he’s hot and you want to dip them somewhere else but you think he’s out of your league?”
Castiel is speechless. And very embarrassed.
Half an hour goes by and he’s in the middle of clearing table 11 when he glances up and sees Doctor Novak coming in, with a petite brunette woman at his side. Figures, the man is straight
A couple of minutes later Kevin puts down one slice of pie and two forks saying “Sorry, it’s the last slice. You okay with sharing?”
“And after work?” the small brunette woman winks, laughing “relax,
He knows the
Mr. Singer’s voice drags him back into the real world, preventing his thoughts from wandering.
he doesn’t want to watch Charlie’s face, so he just closes his eyes and lets his head rest on the loveseat’s back.
“Not officially, but hey! I won’t charge you anything!” he winks and Castiel’s brain dies a little.
Castiel is on lunch break alone because he doesn’t want to deal with Meg, sitting at his desk. He's writing down notes on Mr. Singer’s record while eating a chicken salad when he sees a new appointment pop up on the clinic's Google calendar page.
. You should know your next hot date is not due for another ten minutes. That’s what you were checking, right?”
Meg was about to retort with something, probably a crude comment on Dean, but she bites her bottom lip and smiles at someone behind Castiel’s shoulder.
"Smart since a young age, it doesn't surprise me. I learned to pick up chicks, it's not the same."
He’s 32 and his reputation as a player says otherwise. He’s pretty smooth (most of the time), it comes with knowing his charming points and having no qualms in using them with women and men alike. In his younger years he liked to say he had a big heart and his mission was to give some love to as many people as possible. But once his 30s approached he started thinking it was time to settle down and he slowly stopped picking up people at dive bars, much to Sam’s relief.
) and Star Wars, and a lot of other movies that Castiel isn’t sure he even heard talking about.
The walk to the car is silent but not uncomfortable. Dean’s mind is spinning with the events that unfolded in the last thirty minutes, so he really needs these precious minutes to get himself together and not crash the car on the way home.
He's good at this, he's done it for years and it's like riding a bike. He hasn't since he was sixteen, but if you gave him a bike right now he'd be able to ride it.
“I told you to knock it off. Why are you making him uncomfortable? You know you can’t drive away patients, we need them!”
“Right.”
He can’t make himself say anything to Dean, he can’t look Alfie in the eyes, so he’s forced to endure a very hot tongue licking his fingers. His face feels hot and his breath is shortening, but he keeps working and tries to stop the wayward tongue with the mirror when he has to fill the holes left by the cavities.
“You’re an asshole.”
And maybe try to meet someone new so he’ll stop thinking of his sexy dentist, especially now that he had a good look at those beautiful thighs, when it's not the right time.
“When will you learn to swallow before talking?”
“And you’d be right. Sorry, I was joking. What do you like? I remember you drank an American Pale Ale last time I saw you here, right? So you don’t mind a little bitterness. You can have an IPA, that’s a little more bitter, it pairs well enough with a cheeseburger. If you’re looking for something stronger, and maybe have the BBQ burger, a Stout or a Porter is a good idea. It’s more bitter but the aroma is rich and kind of smoke-y, it’s a good pair. But if you just want something nice that goes well with almost everything that’s on the menu, the Lager is your friend; it’s fresh and light and that’s probably what I'll end up having since I have to drive.”
The thing is.
“No, I don’t.”
Behind the closed door he can finally lie face down on the small couch and lament his frustrations in peace until Meg comes in later to give him a lift home.
“Yeah, sure, I’ll- I’ll keep that in mind.” once again he tries to walk away, but she keeps talking.
In these hours Castiel learned that Dean isn’t how he pictured him.
It’s nothing, let’s be real, if anything it’s a dinner between acquaintances.
Castiel hasn’t been able to forget Dean Winchester since the moment he saw him stepping into his clinic the week before. The accident only made it more difficult than it would’ve been anyway.
“Hey!” he’s offended for five seconds but then he sighs, resigned. “He’s so fucking hot Charlie, you have no idea. Any possibility I could’ve had with him? Shot to hell. He got so red! He kept working as professionally as before, but it was obvious he was embarrassed! I can’t even blame the breathing gas, cause he didn't use it!”
"Fine. Watch the stars and shut up, it was supposed to be romantic, you asshole."
“O-kay, I’ll be back in a second with the drinks and then as soon as the burgers are ready.”
“Someday you’ll be thrown out of this bar, Dean. What would you like to have, guys?”
Dean and Benny are done with the latest project, the homeowners were very satisfied and assured them that they'd recommend the studio’s services to all of their friends, and they already have two new houses to deal with, so Dean is very happy.
“Listen, we’re too busy tonight, either you give us a hand or you go home, you can’t get drunk here ‘cause I can’t babysit you!” Jo doesn’t even stop to threaten him, filling beer glasses and arranging them on a tray.
“You did and you know it!”
Dean Winchester is not a teenager who doesn’t know how to act in front of hot people.
. "Are you asking me out for a second date?"
After setting his number on Cas' phone and saying goodbye, with the promise of texting soon to decide on a date (not a
The problem with the situation is that Dean doesn’t want this to end, it’s not even that late and tomorrow is a Saturday, they could do so many things, they could-
“Oh shi- Dean, I’m so sorry! My hand must have slipped. Does it hurt? Alfie, why didn’t you notice?” Castiel panics slightly, pushing away carefully the instrument so as to not hurt Dean more and almost shoving it to Alfie.
He can’t let go, his hands find Cas’ face and caress his cheeks, gently holding him while their lips keep moving. He buries them into the doctor's hair, tugging a little. His breath stops for a second when Cas’ head tilts and his tongue swipes Dean’s bottom lips, but he immediately gets on with the program and opens his mouth to reciprocate that gentle touch with his own tongue.
Dean is surprised to know that Castiel has been at the Roadhouse fairly regularly in the last years.
"Yes, Dean, please keep name-calling me, it's very romantic." he says dryly.
“Don’t make me spit in your beer, Winchester!”
“Hello, Dean. Let me put on a mask and gloves, and then we’ll take a look at that mouth of yours.” he turns around to do just that, and if he hears an aborted snort from Alfie’s direction, he ignores it.
“Hello to you too, Handmaiden. Care to elaborate?” she mumbles on the other end of the receiver, sounding like she’s just waking up. At 11 AM. There’s some serious envy for a second.
And he promised him a ride in Baby.
“Aight, thanks.”
“I know when and how to use my tongue” she winks and he mockingly gags “take on tables 10 to 15, c’mon!”
. You’re on thin ice.” Novak's voice is hard and unyielding.
“Couple more minutes, bro!”  Ash replies without looking up the prep table.
"You were right, Dean. This pie is delicious! I suppose I've always skipped dessert while eating here because of my job. Too much sugar is good business usually, but not when I'm the one suffering."
“One mushroom, onions and Swiss cheese for the
confuses Dean. Surely his brother is not that stupid.
“What’s the verdict then?”
The phrase “there's no two without three” has been stuck in his head since the day he found out Dean was coming back. And yes, he was shocked enough that he realized running off to Hannah’s desk to ask her if she was sure the appointment was real was a bad idea only when he heard Meg’s evil cackle from the other side of said desk.
Wait. Why is that something important?
“Relax, Admiral Ackbar. Who’s Meg?”
Alfie puts a paper towel on the patient’s chest, then readjusts the chair to a reclined position and the light above his head. Once everything’s done, Castiel takes the dental mirror and the scraper and approaches the chair while saying “Open your mouth for me, Dean.”
“I’m ready.” He leaves his fingers inside, remembering Crowley’s previous instruction.
“So, I do what you say for seven days... and you’ll let us do the ritual?”
Cas is mildly surprised at the lack of strange devices set up in the room. No tables or bars or toys laid out on the bed. Somehow, that only serves to make him more nervous. Dean slips off his boots and flannel and seats himself on the bed, right in the middle, his back to the wall. Cas follows Dean crooked finger and crawls up so he’s sitting between his spread legs, back to chest. Dean’s hands slide all over his clothed body. Despite the anxiety still nagging at him, Cas can’t help but relax against him. Dean’s body is warm and steady against him. It’s pleasant, reminiscent of their embrace of the previous night.
over his heart. He takes another step out of the room.
.” He draws the word out, how you’d speak to a young child. Cas pushes down his annoyance and focuses on letting him in. Crowley’s hand inches in farther and farther until his knuckles pop in. Cas gasps. It only hurts a little, but the sensation of it rattles him. He vaguely notices Crowley exchanging a look with a still-stern Dean.
demonstration!” Dean carefully positions the table and locks the wheels. Cas’ view of what he’s doing is blocked by his back as he rifles through one of the drawers across the room. Dean hems and haws as he picks things up and considers them. After what feels like hours, but Cas knows couldn’t have been more than a minute, he presents his chosen object to Cas. Cas’ confusion grows momentarily as he examines the average-sized black dildo. As Dean returns to the machine, the realization of what it must do strikes him.
“Wait... Did you put this on me?” Cas runs his fingers over the soft blanket that had been spread out on him. “I don’t remember this being here.”
“You’re crying?” He shoves his hips forward, forcing Cas to let out a sob. “Can’t take it, huh?”
of getting fucked hard, and the
“I don’t remember discussing it.” Dean’s breath is hot on his ear as he speaks.
“Take ‘em off right here. I wanna watch.” He lets go and steps back until he can sit on the edge of the bed. “Go on.”
“Fine... thank you.” Cas is surprised by how kind Dean is being. His whole attitude seems different today. “So, what happens now?” Dean’s smile stretches wider.
“How about this, angel. You spend a week here with me. You do whatever I ask for seven days and I’ll let you take me to Sam. You guys can try to cure me, although who knows if it’ll even work.” He pulls away from Cas and takes a step back. He looks at Cas with a nerve rackingly devious smile. Despite how nervous the agreement makes him, Cas can’t imagine passing up the chance of curing him.
“Stop.” Dean’s order startles him. Isn’t this what he wanted? Dean steps up until he’s just inches from him. Cas tries to ignore Dean’s obvious erection, but the fact that he’d become aroused by just watching him take his clothes off worms it’s way into his brain. Dean reaches down and pops Cas’ button himself. He chuckles at Cas’ soft gasp. He slides the zipper down and steps away.
“Gonna cum for me?”
a demon. The idea fills him with hope. But as soon as Dean’s display of emotion comes, it leaves. His sad expression is replaced with a leer.
-” He reaches around and grabs a handful of Cas’ ass. “Without feeling like a sick freak who’s taking advantage of his best friend.”
“Wait, Dean. That’s not-”
“Dean- Dean!” Cas gasps out Dean’s name with each brutal thrust. His strained voice is cut off by a hand clamping down over his mouth. Dean’s weight presses down on him, forcing him flat on his stomach on the bed. Dean’s breath is hot and damp in his ear.
Dean cradles his cock through his underwear and whispers in his ear, “Damn. You didn’t just
“Mmm, how about you go get cleaned up while I eat?” Dean’s already heading towards the kitchen as he speaks. Cas nods to the empty doorway. He sighs, stands and stumbles to the bathroom. He takes a long, hard look at himself in the mirror. The lower half of his face is coated in Dean’s cum, dripping into his mouth, off his chin onto his bare chest. The humiliation stings, but a weak stab of arousal heats his stomach regardless. He’s glad that he’s too tired to get hard. He takes a longer shower than necessary, giving himself more time to calm down.
“Dean-”
creative when it comes to their activities. His concern is halfway quelled by Dean’s hands resuming their fondling. He allows himself to sigh in pleasure as he’s touched all over. He doesn’t bother responding to Dean’s self-satisfied snicker. He’s only mildly perturbed by one of Dean’s arms locking around his middle. After all, he does seem to enjoy holding him-
Crowley sits on the edge of the bed near Dean’s chair. He rifles through the bedside table and tosses a particularly large tube of lube by Cas’ legs.
He hears the distinct wet sound of the toy being lubed. He braces himself, but he still jolts as the machine whirs to life. The tip of the dildo slides forward to press against his tense hole.
“Relax, relax.” Crowley’s voice is oddly soothing. “Can’t have you getting hurt.”
“Huh?” His head is still fuzzy from the intensity of everything Dean had done to him (and made him do.) Dean answers him by yanking him up and manhandling him into his lap.
over there. He’s warned me well enough about-”
“Yeah. You’re damn right.” Dean slides his hand down Cas’ thigh until his fingers are pressing in with Crowley’s. “He’s amazing like this, didn’t I tell you?”
“I never will.”
They corral Cas into the bedroom. He tries to bring up the issue of
Both of their heads turn towards Dean’s cold voice. He’s glaring at Crowley, his eyes narrowed.
Cas glances at Dean. He’s disheartened, although not surprised, to find him leisurely stroking himself through his jeans. Dean shoots him a pleased smile. Cas gasps as Crowley’s hand squeezes a handful of his ass.
Cas slips his pinky in. The stretch stings, but he pushes past it. Dean wolf whistles from his seat, Crowley murmurs something that Cas doesn’t quite catch. Cas shoves his fingers a little deeper. The feeling of four fingers up to the final knuckle is uncomfortable, slightly painful, but he feels that now familiar stir in his groin.
“Open up.” Cas opens his eyes to see Dean’s gleeful expression. He opens his mouth and accepts Dean’s fingers. His brow furrows at the strange taste, but it makes his cock fill even further regardless. “Good boy.” The praise leaves a warm feeling in his chest. “Now it’s your turn.”
“If you say so.” He pulls out, making Cas whimper. He roughly flips Cas over and shoves his legs apart. He takes a moment to re-lube before shoving in, easing Cas’ struggle. His hands hold Cas’ thighs open wide as he fucks him. The new position and slickness leaves Cas grasping at the sheets. Dean’s thrusts are faster and deeper, quickly bringing Cas to the point of begging.
“Anything, huh?”
Crowley rolls his eyes. “You’re both idiots. Say, what’s in this for you anyway?” Cas’ about to answer when Dean’s voice covers his.
Cas wakes with a start. He jolts up, momentarily forgetting where he is. He glances around the unfamiliar room until his eyes land on the man standing in the doorway.
are much more agreeable these days as well.”
, so be it.
He sits on the edge of the bed, feeling slightly nauseous. Somehow, the thing that’s bothering him most isn’t the idea of Dean using this stuff on
Dean murmurs directly against his lips, “I’m gonna come all over you, angel.” Cas nods wordlessly. Dean pulls Cas’ hand off of him and shifts up his body until his cock is almost touching Cas’ mouth. He briefly considers making Cas suck him off again, but he’d meant it when he’d said this was just a warm up. He jerks himself off, quickly bringing himself to the edge.
