John suddenly felt very exposed. He felt as if he’d been woken from a deep sleep and thrust into the light of day. He suddenly didn’t want to meet Sherlock’s eyes, an unexplainable heat creeping into his cheeks. He slid out of his friend’s personal space, cleared his throat.
“I do,” John hastened to reply, “I do. I just - are you sure it was them? You were standing far away, could - ”
Mike introduced John to some other Doyle boys - they all smiled at John as he and Mike sat down on the long, wooden benches. It was roast chicken on offer that night, something John hadn’t eaten for a long time. It was something his dad had always cooked.
Just as John was debating whether or not to quickly explain misogyny, he felt a drop of rain land on his face.
John went through a doorway into where Mike must have found the mattress and the violin. It was bare now. There was a window to his left. It was open. John climbed through.
Sherlock took a step back as John held the rugby ball in front of him, poising to kick, aiming for the posts, H-shaped. H for Holmes, for home, for happy, for hungry, for him, for J H Watson.
, as he settled in with Sarah – fingers entwined – next to him. The chatter of the room was like a massage to his aching head; meaningless, unintelligible, not fraught with stress, not talk of cases and Latin and experiments and there was not a tall, skinny, boy-detective in sight.
“Put this on,” he instructed, before reaching into John’s sports bag and chucking John a pair of trainers. “These too.”
John felt the urge to shift closer, to wrap his arms around this soft, sleeping boy, to slip back into the realm of dreams, like he felt the urge to breathe. Innate.
“Wait, wait, wait,” John interrupted, amazed laughter pulling at his voice. “You’re saying you’ve been stalking that Instagram page? Barty’s bulletin?
Sherlock was watching his friend talk. He could see him thinking, see him assessing all the practicalities and timings and domestic things that Sherlock never thought about.
“But why would anyone want to…?” he asked quietly, and all traces of teacher-like sternness had been replaced by grief. John remembered what Anderson had said about Bradstreet loving his pets more than his kids and suddenly felt a wave of sympathy for the man.
“Unless you want a lap dance, that is. That’d get me the extra point five, right?” John grinned as Sherlock swallowed.
There was a pause in which Sherlock seemed to be scanning the room, but his eyes kept flicking back to John’s steady gaze.
“The crisps you bought when you went to the tuck shop with Mike this afternoon, no doubt mainly discussing me on the walk. You didn’t eat them, but put them in the drawer in your desk and subsequently forgot about them.”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft said in a tone of voice that made Sherlock turn around. “Remember that you can’t go gallivanting around being the detective of the school forever.”
“What? Just tell me why you – ” A click as the line went dead. “Fucking hell…” John said to himself.
“It was a car crash. Boring, huh? It was my sixteenth, as you’ve probably worked out, and we were having a bit of a family get-together down at my grandparents’. Dad handed me my ceremonial ‘first’ beer and took me outside like something was important. I asked him what he wanted, because there was nothing out there except his old Ford Fiesta and the rest of my relatives’ cars and it was cold and I wasn’t wearing any shoes. Then he swept his arm towards his car and said,
“Yes, we do.” John said, firmly but gently. Sherlock felt a wave of shame come over him. Here was this boy, so kind, so worried about him, and
John held up his hands in defeat and got into bed. Sherlock was coming more and more to remind John of that one kid in every primary school that sat in the back of the class and made snide comments like '
Dave was smiling at him still, amiable and pleasant. “And you, Sherlock. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“Yes, it’s a very lovely view, now let’s leave John to say goodbye to Sherlock,” Harry was saying, bundling their mother back towards the attic. John looked at Harry now to thank her with his eyes, and she looked back as if she wanted to die.
“Not only does this volunteering system give you a taste of the world of work outside the sheltered environment of St. Bart’s, it gives you an insight into the huge logistical task that is running a boarding school.”
“In all fairness, Jo,” Sherlock piped up, the voice of reason. “It seems as if trouble comes looking for us.”
Doyle’s chants had dissolved into intelligible screams of encouragement now, and the boys lining up for the next race were shouting from the poolside.
Silence fell again, and John began to understand the rhythm of the competition, a cycle of dead silence and deafening noise.
“Nope, sorry’s not going to cut it. Phone Ella as soon as you can – in fact, what are you doing now?”
He’d been chatting merrily away with Mrs-Watson-call-me-Jo about school, mainly, evading the topic of family as always. Harry and Clara were finding something about this whole thing very amusing, and kept laughing at not entirely funny moments.
“Christ, Sherlock,” he said, smile breaking into a grin now, “don’t look so scared. You’re forgiven. And I’m sorry about all the things I said. There. We’re all good. Yeah?”
“Let’s have a look,” Raz prompted, holding out his hand. John gave him the phone, and the boy flipped through the pictures, squinting at them.
When John had told Sherlock this, the taller boy had nodded solemnly. When John had awkwardly asked what Sherlock was going to do to fill his time – an utterly transparent cover for saying
He considered staying quiet, but despite not having told a soul before that day (maybe even because of that), he felt compelled by the game to be honest, tongue loosened by the drink. The boys around him had been made soft by the alcohol and tiredness, and everything seemed safe and warm. So he took a breath, clapped and put one finger down. And immediately regretted it.
“Uh, I don’t really know,” John replied. “Your sister is waiting for you at school, don’t worry about her.” He was interrupted by a small scuffing sound on the stairs and he turned, expecting to see his roommate. “Sherlock, he’s woken – ”
“Yeah, ice, colder and harder than you thought, right?” John asked, extending a hand. Sherlock glared at him but took the proffered help.
He stood up. He was on the roof of the house, a flat part, and for a split second he forgot why he was there as his breath was taken away how high up he was. Sherlock was sitting a few metres away, his legs drawn up to his chest, swathed in his coat. John felt his chest loosen. He exhaled.
Sherlock looked as if he belonged in London, John thought: eyes everywhere at once, taking in the buskers and the Christmas lights, off in the weak winter daylight; taking in the people wrapped up against the soggy chilliness of the day.
John closed his eyes. He could feel himself shaking. “No,” he was saying. “I don’t believe you. Stop it. Stop it, now. Come down.”
“Goodnight,” replied Sherlock, already feeling sleep sitting upon his eyelids. He pulled the duvet up around his chin and pressed his face into the pillow, inhaling the familiar smell of John as each breath deepened and lengthened, until sleep dragged him under once more.
John felt his jaw fall open as Sherlock indicated for Angelo to lead the way. John attempted several times on the walk to Dickens to catch Sherlock’s attention, to ask him
He scrolled through his pictures to find the ones of his piece, sending the one without Sherlock in, and then going back to find the one with Sherlock smiling.
John rolled his eyes and continued with his sketch. He was starting to find Sherlock more amusing than scary, and smiled to himself.
A photographer appeared out of nowhere, and the team got into a formation, posing. John’s smile was his real one, and Sherlock felt warm.
Room twenty-one was still empty when John returned to it. He pocketed his wallet, grabbed his backpack, and had one foot out of the door when it occurred to him that he should let Sherlock know where he was. He tore a page from the back of his English book, having failed to locate a pad of paper, and quickly scrawled a note. He folded it in half, addressed it and left it in the only place Sherlock was guaranteed to see it – the middle of the floor.
Sherlock ripped his goggles off, rubbing his face with his hands. He bobbed in the water for a moment, eyes closed, before turning to Doyle. The corners of his mouth, open as he panted, turned up shyly at his congratulations, and then he turned away, making his way to the side of the pool when he was told.
He swung his legs off the bad and stood up, ignoring the blood rushing too fast away from his head and refusing to wobble as he walked out of the room.
Lestrade gave a monstrous roar, and the shrieks of the boys were infused with hysterical laughter. John reached the top of the stairs and split from the Year Nines and followed his own year into their corridor. He slowed down, catching his breath and marvelling at the lack of spillages.
Sherlock sobered a little at this. “That was only because you put your timed essay in the same sentence as thinking I was dying as if it was of equal importance.”
, John glanced down at the programme and felt his heart stop. There was only one song remaining between Doyle and the stage, and he cast a quick look to Sherlock to see if he’d realised.
Sherlock’s hand hovered still, now millimetres from John’s ear. It would have been so easy to just drop it an inch, feel the softness of John’s hair beneath his fingers. To push his hand through it, smooth it down. Cup his head with his palm.
John was almost more astonished that he’d got a straight answer from the boy for once than at the ridiculous experiment itself. “Why?”
Sherlock studied John. He was breathing shallowly, jaw set, weight on his left leg. He made a conscious decision to relax under Sherlock’s gaze, and explained, “She’s got a work do tonight. Probably won’t come home at all. Stay over at her sleazy boyfriend’s,” John’s face distorted as he pronounced the last word.
He could hear Lestrade chuckling quietly to himself on the landing. As John entered room twenty-one, the housemaster called goodnight to the house and made his way back downstairs.
It wasn’t early enough that John could allow himself to lounge in bed much longer, so he heaved himself out of bed and made his way downstairs.
Sherlock made a face and rolled his eyes at his friend, who laughed quietly. “I was doing some research into the sources of the school’s food.”
That seemed to be the right response, because Mike grinned at him. “Well, all you need to know is you’re going to be hoarse by the time this is over.”
John stormed down the lower sixth corridor. He had been annoyed about Sherlock interrupting his one night of peace, then angry about Sherlock doing that thing he did with the deductions. Then worry had slid into the corner of his mind –
There was something Sherlock wanted to say to John, wanted to clarify. It was pressing at the base of his skull but its blade was blunt and he couldn’t remember its form.
“Don’t be obtuse, John,” Sherlock huffed. “I believe it is said that gifts are all the more appreciated if hand-made, and you are very good at art, and painting especially is one of your fortes,”
His friend still had his shoes on, so John set his glass down on the bed side table and began to unlace them. He pulled them slowly off the other boy’s feet and set them neatly by the bed. He pulled the duvet folded neatly at the end of the bed over the sleeping body, and was tempted to lie down on the bed opposite and take a moment to rest, but he could hear someone opening the door to the building.
“John, catch,” Mike instructed a split second before a bottle came flying through the air towards John’s face. He managed to catch it, just, and as he turned around to look for a bottle opener, Lestrade moved past him and handed one to him.
“John Watson? A sound for sore ears.” Mycroft sighed. “I truly apologise for my brother’s behaviour, turning up at your house uninvited, he really has no thought for anybody but himself – ”
“…are you?” the driver finished, what seemed like several minutes later, shaking John out of his thoughts again.
John had been hoping for some sort of grace period after the half term holiday, but lessons were just as intense and confusing as usual. During his free period that fell during the last lesson of the day, he fell unconscious onto his bed, only to be woken minutes later by Claus’ snorts of laughter as Glen drew a penis on his face in Sharpie.
Sherlock panted, looking over his shoulder at John, then back to the small puddle at his side. If John wasn’t mistaken, he thought he’d seen a glint of panic in his friend’s eye.
Somehow, his tangled, stupid, infuriating brain had begun to equate the incident in the bathroom earlier that day with a betrayal of John’s trust, of his kindness, of… of him. Of John.
Play had become even more frantic. Half the boys on the pitch were limping, chests heaving, and John was yelling something, gesturing with his hands in frustration. Then, all of a sudden, there was a flurry of activity and all the players stopped moving. A gasp rippled through the spectators, and Sherlock turned to Harry.
He hated saying those words to that cold stone, because sometimes he’d catch himself hearing a reply.
He looked out onto snow so white that he had to squint. He felt like he’d just stepped into a Christmas card, or into the North Pole.
“Wow,” John said, upon going to the desk and seeing that the tea was, in fact, real. “Thanks.” He clutched the mug in his hands, absorbing all the warmth he could. “So. Are you feeling, uh, better?” It was only then that he noticed what looked like three large, circular plasters on his friend’s arm. “Are those… is that
“Not necessarily, I was just – it was a bad example,” Sherlock muttered. “If it makes you feel any better, if we aren’t correct I will likely be very embarrassed and you can gloat about it.”
John turned away, glad that Sherlock could no longer see his face. He was suddenly too tired to keep it neutral. He had one hand on the cool metal of the ladder when Sherlock spoke again.
“This potato salad is fantastic,” Sherlock said, indicating the bowl from which he was getting a second helping.
“Oh, shit,” he mumbled thickly, his mouth full. He scrambled to his feet. “Where are the sweets?” He swallowed prematurely, making his throat hurt, and ran into the kitchen. They were nowhere to be found, and he became more and more frantic until –
Sherlock smiled, and John was surprised to see that it was a genuine expression. “I suppose not, no.”
Sherlock had told him not to bother with a gift, but John’s steps faltered as he passed a twenty-four hour supermarket.
Sherlock gave him a tight smile and after a pause, abruptly turned on his heel, grabbing his blazer, and slipped out of the room.
John was struggling to keep a straight face. His mouth twisted and his skin crinkled at the corners of his eyes, and the sight made Sherlock warm in his stomach and all of a sudden he thought he might be sick – but Dr Hope glared daggers at them from the front of the classroom, so they both lowered their heads and focussed intently on the paper in front of them. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see John convulsing silently with laughter, and Sherlock’s stomach was still turning but he felt the very opposite of ill.
The head of Doyle stood up from his seat on the sofa, threading a hand nervously through his dark hair.
Sherlock refused to go to dinner with John. John did not bother asking if he wanted the apple he brought back for him, but left it on his desk. Just in case.
“Just go, Sherlock,” John interrupted. His face was no-nonsense, his voice the one that Harry had only heard used on her when she was being unnecessarily difficult. John had learned it from their father when they were small. Harry remembered him imitating the man behind his back.
After a shower, it was suddenly difficult to decide what to wear. He was standing in front of his open wardrobe with only boxers on, a pair of jeans hanging over one arm, considering his options, when his phone chimed.
For most of his life at St Bart’s, when he’d returned to the house after a holiday, stepping back over the threshold into the building had made his throat tighten just a little and his mind do something like raise its hackles. But now, as he stepped over Lestrade’s ‘BEWARE OF THE KIDS’ doormat, he was able to process the usual rush of information as it came, what Lestrade was cooking for his dinner, how many boys had already returned, this and that and whatever else. Lugging his suitcase up the stairs was no longer a chore. The Lower Sixth corridor no longer felt endless, not with room number twenty one at its end.
Someone had the idea to congregate in Vlad and Glen’s room, but they could barely walk in there without treading on something, so they moved into Mike and Ollie’s. They started talking about the house rugby competition, lamenting their loss of first place, then someone found a pack of playing cards somewhere, and all order broke down.
“So you’re saying your brother Muhammad has been kidnapped?” John said gently to Nadia, recapping what she had told them on the walk over.
He realised he was still gripping the books he had taken out of the library. He opened one of them, the spine creaking. He looked at the front page. The book had last been taken out in 2002, by an M Holmes.
And then her mother turned, and Harry turned, conversation with Lestrade broken off, and John was running towards them, as best he could through the throng.
He walked down the passage, following the sounds of cooking. Lestrade was making an omelette, in his pyjamas still.  Which was a bit of an odd sight.
He tried not to feel anything about that. Sherlock had promised him, and Sherlock very rarely promised anything, so John knew he’d get it. He sent him a text.
His plan was flawed, however, in that he was so eager to sleep that he couldn’t. He tossed and turned for what felt like an eternity, before plugging his headphones into his phone and listening to his waltz as a last beacon of hope.
Sherlock cursed silently. He was now obliged to face John, as the other boy had engaged him in conversation. Sherlock put an arm in a sleeve and turned around.
“Oh, yes, but you aren’t having them, my dear,” she smiled at him. “Those papers are mine. They’re a part of my aegis, you see. My protection. Not everyone likes the idea of sixteen year old girls sleeping with, well, anyone, let alone the people I have. So I
In truth, John could never eat when his family was fighting. His throat would barely admit oxygen, let alone anything solid.
“Hi mum, it’s me, it’s John. Uh, it’s about two forty-five on Monday. I’ve got a detention tonight for – well, I’ll explain when I see you. Anyway, I’ll be home about six. See you later.”
Eddie considered it a moment. House competitions were about collaboration, team work, volunteering one’s natural strengths for the fun of it, and building good relationships between houses. And winning. Eric was in.
His friend looked at him for a second, with those eyes he could barely see in the night air, and then took the small cube from him.
“Got it,” John said. “Bye,” he called as Smith rounded the corner out of the waiting area and into the corridor again.
Since their altercation two-and-three-quarter days ago (roughly), things between them had been a little fragile, like a vase on the edge of a mantelpiece.
Sherlock looked up at him from the floor, a little confused. After a moment, he stood up and picked up the eye patch from the sofa, putting it on.
“Alright, then,” John said. “I’ll have a good old think, but first let’s down this and you can teach me how to talk dirty in French. Okay?”
John sent him another message, something about ‘you gotta have consent’ and ‘check yourself before you wreck yourself’, but Sherlock didn’t bother replying.
“Don’t take another step towards your - your precious roommate,” John said, and Sherlock saw a red light flash above him.
“I’ll tell him,” he called after her. When she turned around, he smiled. “I’m sure he’d love to go with you as a friend.”
“Okay, fine,” replied John, “but will you at least help me pick out a suit? I’m no good at choosing between cuts and - and lapels and between single or double back... ventilation…”
John looked around him in awe – he wouldn’t have recognised the room as the same one he had sat in assembly in that morning if he hadn’t known. The stage was fully built; wings, lights, microphones, instruments all in their places. The back of the stage was lit red and purple, and the main hall lights were yet to be turned off, so John could see in great detail the other houses’ costumes. The girls across the aisle from them – Sarah’s house, John realised – were all in bright yellow; the boys across the other aisle seemed to all be in ridiculously flared jeans and headbands; each of the girls in front of them wore a white karate gi, if he wasn’t mistaken.
“This is the corridor with all the lower sixths’ rooms,” he explained. “Luckily, all sixth formers have our own rooms – well, I say 'our own'; us lower sixth don’t have to sleep in the dorms like the little 'uns, but we do have to share a room. If you stick around, John, you'll get your own room next year. What a privilege," he said sarcastically. "Anywho, this is where our whistle-stop tour ends for today. You’re in number twenty-one, right at the end, here.”
and a heavy sigh from their mum. They decided to leave her to it and settled down to watch the film together regardless.
“Stop shouting, for Christ’s sake,” Lestrade poked his head out of his house and looked up at John. “If you’re going to have a conversation about boobs, can you please not do it with three flights of stairs between you?”
“Why?” Sherlock replied, thankfully matching John’s volume. “It’s not as if any of those idiotic rules about respecting the dead apply to animals,”
“Sorry to break this up, boys,” came a silken voice from beside them. “But some people have a competition to win.”
They ate the pains aux chocolat on the walk back to the Holmes’ house, the heat of the pastry a welcome relief from the cold.
It was Sherlock’s first lesson in John’s biology class after his expulsion from the year above's, and John turned around as his and Sarah’s conversation reached a lull to check on him. It didn’t take very long to find him. He seemed to be having a heated argument with his lab partner, some poor soul called Robbie, who was in Dahl house, according to his tie. Robbie was looking increasingly flustered as Sherlock got increasingly frustrated with what he would surely later deem as Robbie’s lack of competence. It wasn’t easy to read Sherlock’s emotions from his body language, but John was steadily getting better at it with all the practise he was getting.
“I was at army, you - ” John chose not to finish that sentence and sighed. “What was your question, Sherlock?” he asked slowly, as if he were talking to a toddler –
“I tried to just walk out, but he got up and was all like, are you okay? Do you need anything? And I was like, I’m fine, I’m fine, but he was having none of it and he sat me down and gave me a tissue.”
“John,” Sherlock said, and then there was a hand curling itself around the fist John was pressing against the rooftop.
The buzzing of the light was now in the centre of his head, and it was not unpleasant at all. It felt like a massage, and it forced out all unwanted thoughts of John and guilt and John and his father and the boys and the police and John.
“Can I see what you’ve already done?” Sherlock asked, standing and feeling each vertebra in his spine click.
John looked back at Sherlock, waiting for him to do something. He supposed he was going to have to. John probably thought it to be important, for whatever reason, and Sherlock
His friends avoided his gaze, and John knew he’d got his message across. The last part of the story was the part he really didn’t want to tell, but he had to now. So he decided to get it over with.
Two minutes later, Sherlock let John try to play the song by himself. He watched as John sang quietly to himself.
“So, um, how did your sister, like, come out?” Her voice was quiet and confidential. “It’s just, I haven’t yet to my parents. Precarious situation, seeing as everyone my dad teaches knows, but he doesn't. I know I need to sometime soon but I’m kind of scared to.”
He felt his heart rate drop, his breathing slow. He tried to calm his thoughts but they were swirling and his brain felt slow. He decided that was a job for tomorrow.
John looked down. It was Sherlock’s hand. John closed his eyes for a moment, just a moment, before forcing himself to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock scowled. “Thinking,” he said shortly. “About Angelica. If we are dealing with some substance – of which there are many, I’ve checked – that makes people forget things, then if must have been put into her bloodstream without her knowing.”
Some days, John knew what he was going to draw well before he had taken his pad out. Other days, like this one, John sat with it open on his knee, pencil ghosting out images and shapes for a long time, unable to represent the maze of his thoughts, how his synapses had sparked that day. So he began to sketch out his view from his lofty new bed. He roughed out the metal of the frame, Sherlock’s one across from his, and a little of the view from out of the window. The sun was setting, casting deep orange light into their little room and onto his legs.
Sherlock took John’s confused silence as a response and clarified. “I helped out the head of sport a couple of years ago. I covered up something that he definitely did not want becoming common knowledge; thereby I am excused indefinitely from compulsory games.  Sometimes I swim, however. But late at night, when there is no chance of running into other... humans.”
“You seem pretty upset he missed this study sesh.” John knew he was being a little cruel, now. That he should let Sherlock just dismiss him and his case.
– Sherlock remembered, looking up at the whiteboard momentarily, where the date was scribbled in the top right-hand corner –
Once there, he sat down on a bench, as far away from the entangled couple on the other end of it as he could. He laid the flowers next to him gently, and then rummaged through his backpack until he found his scarf, gratefully wrapping it around his bare neck.
“I’m going to post you your Christmas presents, so text me your address?” John asked, turning to his best friend.
“He was a rubbish kisser,” Sherlock deadpanned, and John burst into laughter, attracting stern looks from some police officers but not caring in the slightest.
Before his mum dozed off and Frodo left the Shire, John reluctantly broached the subject of unemployment.
“I’m quite comfy here, actually,” he said, and he again heard laughter, but this time in his favour, giving him the courage to feign nonchalance. “Thanks, though.”
“I’m glad you didn’t see that. That was unspeakably undignified.” He muttered, gingerly getting to his feet.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, and John felt the anger dissipating. Anderson had disappeared into the crowd now anyway. Sherlock took off his blazer and went back to his monologue about that Mrs Turner while brushing off the remains of the tomato, seemingly unshaken, but John couldn’t mistake a certain darkness that had come over his face.
“Staunton?” Sherlock queried, turning around as if he’d forgotten Angelo was there. “Oh, he’s been two-timing you. Some girl in Shelley. He’ll be there right now.”
John shook his head. “But still, why is this happening at some random secondary school in the countryside?”
Robbed anything worth more than ten pounds; slapped a sibling; had sex in public; had sex outside; got with anyone in more than three counties of England.
Sherlock groaned. “Don’t make me go to lunch,” he pleaded, practically burrowing back into the mattress.
, thought Eddie. “No matter what he does, do not let him back out of this. He will try, believe me, and prepare to have all your secrets spat in your face, but do not back down.”
John risked a look at Eddie, who was sitting a few seats down from him. The boy was white as a sheet.
It came to be Glen’s turn. He was struggling to think of something to say, and people were getting restless.
By the time they reached the village green, John’s stomach was beginning to rumble and his feet were beginning to go numb.
“Oh, um, sure,” he said, trying to focus. He tried to remember some of the more gory medical books Harry had bought for him over the years, tried to remember autopsy procedures.
A couple of minutes in, John felt his phone begin to vibrate with what he knew would be texts of felicitations. He took it out, smiled at the incoming messages, from Mike, Harry, Dan. He sent quick replies back, then pocketed the thing as soon as he could. He looked up, and Sherlock was looking at him. He grinned, and Sherlock grinned back, and they both turned back to the television.
John made sure to be as gentle as possible, beginning with Sherlock’s left cheek. He placed the two paint-covered fingers just by Sherlock’s nose, and drew them outwards towards his ear. Then he switched hands and did the same on Sherlock’s right cheek. The finishing touches were the same pattern of dots on his forehead as John had drawn on his own.
Upon stepping across the threshold into his home, John heard the sound of the radio in the kitchen blasting the end of a song at full volume. He supposed that Harry must have got up, and he walked through to get Sherlock a glass of water, knowing his friend was behind him.
After lunch, the atmosphere in Doyle had become palpable, thick with stress and excitement. John could feel it as soon as he stepped through the door.
“Half eight,” Harry replied as they passed her and Clara on the stairs. “Why is mum shouting at you?”
“Great. Sherlock; dinner’s at normal time, and for God’s sake, go with John, at least for the next few days, so he knows how it all works and where everything is.” Sherlock made a face. “I know, but please?”
John grinned. “That was all you had to say,” he said, climbing down from the ladder and handing one of the parcels to Sherlock.
John was too busy admiring his own cushion arrangement on the sofa in front of him to see the look that his sister and mother exchanged.
“Get lost,” Sherlock called. It had taken a while to get used to, Sherlock knowing who was behind a door by their step and knock, but now John generally ignored it, and tried to answer the door before Sherlock could open his mouth. He was too late this time, however.
“Out with what?” Sherlock gently lifted a slide out from the clips of the microscope and set it on the desk, his back still to John.
“I will not. It won’t help. Besides, it sounds as if you’re more than competent to take care of my injuries, Dr Watson.” John couldn’t help smiling at that.
John grinned at his ridiculous friend. The haircut looked good – his hair was no longer an unruly sponge of curls, but had a shape, curving up from the nape of his neck. It looked softer. It wasn’t a big change, but made him look older, gave his face a frame. It was only then that John registered that he was still holding Sherlock’s hands. He dropped them, swallowing, and it was only
Despite the substantial discount the scholarship earned him, and the modest bursary on top, John was painfully aware of how many digits these two years of schooling were about to drain from his mother's bank account. The deal was that he'd pay part of it back from his inheritance once he turned eighteen, and his mum had assured him that it wasn’t
There was a movement from the bed on the left side of the room. John did a double take. He hadn’t noticed the other boy in the room - he had been so perfectly still, lying on his back on his bed. Now, he was sitting bolt upright. He took in Mike with one swift glance and remarked in a baritone drawl, all tight consonants and a lifetime of private education,
“Oh – yeah, sorry, I was miles away,” John apologised, hoping he hadn’t been staring at her or anything. “Just a hot chocolate, please,”
Sherlock felt as if his heart had stopped. He didn’t remember much about his death, having chosen to delete it. His last few days had been hazy anyway, shrouded in mist. But those initials, the first mention of them, made the fog clear.
“You going to fight me, little man? Huh?” Angelo taunted, grinning like a shark. “Are you and your boyfriend going to take me on?”
“More of the same would be great, Sherlock,” Mrs Watson said, smiling at him, and Sherlock wondered at the back of his head how she could be the same woman that her kids hid from.
John frowned and went back to bed. He had slept through the Rising and the nights of the Pale Wars. This was nothing.
“This article,” Mrs Watson elaborated, pulling Sherlock back to the grey sky and the chill of a winter breeze and the sound of the crowd.
“Wrong. Mrs Hudson has a flat in London, on Baker Street. Used to be her husband’s. Now she lets it out. I’m sure she’d kick out her tenants for me.”
He looked tired. Beyond tired. Beyond exhausted. Worn to thinness, worn to the edge of his limits. But then all of that disappeared.
, the headline proclaimed, and Sherlock sighed and stopped reading. He made a mental note to inform John that his melodrama helped no-one and nothing when he saw him next.
A few days later, John arrived a little late to the san. When he entered, he breathed a sigh of relief to note that Dr. Smith was nowhere to be seen.
“On the grand scheme of things, if you look at it from above, it is. I have to delete some things to make room for others which are more important,”
“I never want you to point a gun at me ever again,” John said, looking at it. “It scared the bloody life out of me.”
“Come on, Sherlock. See you later, girls,” John said, leading his friend out of the kitchen, not being able to resist the urge to add a “Have fun!” over his shoulder.
John furrowed his brow as he read over those messages. The poem had come an hour and a half after the text wishing John goodnight. It rang a bell in his head – something about an immortal man longing to die and Tennyson, so he copied and pasted the first line into Google.
John was standing very close to the girl, Sawyer, Sarah Sawyer. His back was to the door, their faces were close, his hands on her hips. There were two mugs of hot chocolate resting on the countertop next to them. Sherlock could see the girl’s smile drop away as her eyes flicked from John’s to Sherlock in the doorway. After a pause, John caught on and turned around. His face showed recognition, query, then annoyance.
“Hello, Johnny,” their mother replied, a rare smile breaking across her features. “It’s nice to see your face again.”
They moved around her bed until they were in front of her feet. John took the right, Harry the left, and they began to tickle the soles of her feet. Soon enough, they were all three in the kitchen. John made them all tea while Harry tried to drag them through into the living room.
“I am perfectly capable of doing two things at once,” he said, and John almost didn’t want to continue. Sherlock could certainly be intimidating when he wanted to.
He tried texting Molly, asking Mike, even tried to find someone with Irene Adler’s number – all to no avail.
John laughed, partially out of surprise that the boy had said anything at all. “I said that when I first came here. But Sherlock – my friend, the one who’s asleep – said to me ‘don’t be daft, John; the country is not immune to dark intrigues.’
Having retrieved her wallet, she jogged back down the stairs and was on her way to the front door when she halted as she passed the living room. The door was ajar, and through the gap she could see the dark shape of Sherlock on the sofa, knees drawn up to his chest. The room was lit solely by the light from the telly, which appeared to be showing the Jeremy Kyle Show with the volume turned down so the roars of the crowd were barely a whisper. She pushed it open a little further and the boy turned to her. He put a finger to his lips and there was the ghost of a smile on his usually-serious face as he inclined his head to the space on the sofa next to him. Harry shifted and saw what, or rather who, Sherlock was indicating to. John was slumped next to him, head resting on the arm, mouth open slightly, fast asleep.
If John had been the praying type, he would have been on his knees in the mud. Which, by coincidence, he was.
“You’re not getting any information out of me, John,” Sherlock insisted as they walked through the woods at the edge of the St. Bart’s grounds. “We’re going to get detention for skipping - ”
They had all but stopped moving. They were swaying, still, like trees in a wind. John didn’t know how much time had passed. All that he knew was the space between him and Sherlock and the way his palm felt, those long fingers curled around his own.
“The way I see it,” Sally said as they walked back into the kitchen, Anderson carrying the Guinea pig in a plastic bag. “There are two ways of dying: naturally or murder. I think we can rule out all three of the family pets dying naturally within minutes of each other, so that leaves murder. And there are more two types of murder: intentional and unintentional. Now, it could be that the pets’ food supplies got contaminated with something without the family noticing, but that’s the only way I can see that they could have been unintentionally murdered.”
“Wait, he went to St Bart’s? Oh my god. Holy fuck.” John ran his hand over his face. “Jesus… are you okay?”
The unmistakable sound of Anthea’s heels behind him made John turn around. She and Mycroft were walking in front of Sherlock, Mycroft speaking into his phone in a low tone. They brushed past John without a word, making their way over to a sleek black Jaguar parked a few metres away across the road, a bored-looking chauffeur in the driver’s seat.
Lestrade ushered them into their seats, and tried to halt a Mexican wave that one of the year tens started, but with little success.
“No, you’re going to go take a shower, nice and cold, okay? You’ve got to sober up before mum comes home or she’s going to kill you.”
“More or less?” Mycroft drew a breath. “Well, it sounds as if he’ll be fine. He’ll wake up in a few hours. This is the first proper night’s sleep he’s had in a while, yes?”
He had barely been able to catch snatches of John and the Turner girl’s conversation, but he had confidence that his phone, placed in John’s chest pocket, having been assured that no diving on the floor with weaponry was to occur today, would have recorded what he’d missed.
“She won’t come down for another – ” Sherlock began, but noticed the look on John’s face. “Uh, yes, let’s clear up, that’s probably best.”
“Alright, yes, I know,” John hastily interrupted. But something about this story was making him feel more and more uneasy by the minute. He shivered: a gust of wind blew through his uniform, and he remembered that he could have been in Doyle having a cup of tea. Another raindrop, this time on the back of his neck, and John found himself saying something he never thought he’d say to the boy standing before him: “Look, Anderson, I’ve got to get back to house, so I’ll message you, okay?”
The shopping centre was bright and glittering with seasonal decoration, elaborate light fixtures in the shapes of snowflakes and swirls and reindeer hanging from the ceiling. Signs advertising post-Christmas sales were already everywhere, and the atmosphere was buzzing with chatter and footsteps on the polished floor.
She quickly looked away just in case he saw her prematurely. Her heart gave a little skip – she hadn’t realised how much she’d missed him.
John grinned back, and felt something spark like a fuse in his stomach. “Oh, here comes the French bit, listen,” he said, tugging on Sherlock’s hands to pull him closer. He wound himself around the boy, still dancing terribly (he knew) while singing,
“…but unfortunately, as much as you deserve it, you don’t get a lie-in tomorrow, so I think it’s bed time – for all of you,” there were assorted groans and protests at this, but Lestrade insisted and in a few moments, the foyer was almost clear of people.
, it screamed at him. He ignored that and sent John a text. He paused for thought, checked his watch, then sent another two in quick succession. He wasn’t quite sure why – that age-old illusion named ‘politeness’ probably had something to do with it.
John sniggered, a combination of adrenaline and the fact that Sherlock was acting like they were about to rob a bank. Sherlock, however, looked him dead in the eyes until John’s nervous smile faded from his face.
He forced his mind away. That memory felt somehow private, as if he should avert his eyes from it. Somehow sacred.
John lifted the flap of shirt and inspected the bruising on Sherlock’s stomach. He pressed and prodded, noting when Sherlock reacted and when he didn’t.
John got the ketchup and two biscuits, and scouted the room for a place to sit. He found one, the very end of a bench near the entrance, and sat down while Sherlock got the drinks – another routine they’d fallen into in recent weeks.
Blinking, John found himself in a very old, disused classroom. The paint was peeling from the walls and there was a snow-like blanket of dust on the furniture. What was most surprising, however, was the impeccably dressed man standing in front of the blackboard, leaning on an umbrella.
He broke the placid surface so slowly that it almost tickled as his limp body turned so that he was lying on his back, his lungs singing in rejoice of the abundance of oxygen he was allowing them. The residual ache and light-headedness that he was left with after having pushed his brain cells to the point of passing out reminded him that his body was still there, his godforsaken heart still shoving blood through his hollow veins, as if it mattered.
“It was about ten at night, so I flicked on the head lights and I watched the flies in them for a second. Then dad asked me if I was ready, and I said ‘Hell fucking yeah,’ and he didn’t tell me off for swearing because he never did, that was only mum.
“Calm your tits, mate,” Raz replied. “Looks like Michigan, maybe. Not something you can get from the art block, definitely.”
“It was an elderly man, maybe late sixties, and he was dead. His eyes were still open. Later on I found out that he’d died instantly on impact. Snapped his neck.
John couldn’t believe what was happening. He felt as if he was in a dream, but he knew that this time he wouldn’t wake up gasping for air and trying not to sob in the darkness.
“You’re going to help me anyway? Even though I didn’t comply with your deal?” asked Sherlock, incredulously.
“Goodbye, Richard. Have a good day,” Sherlock called over his shoulder to the boy. “What the hell were you thinking?” he hissed at John, guiding him firmly by the arm behind a building. “You remember what we said about not being able to tell a soul?”
“’Yes, but more specifically that you, Glen, are more spectacularly boeotian than the rest. Oh, and, just between you and I, your penis is not going to get any bigger, so you need not continue to measure it every morning with Vlad’s ruler when you think no-one else is awake.’ And Vlad, whose bed was right next to Glen’s, was like,” Mike put on an overstated Russian accent, “’You do
“Are we going to have fireworks?” John asked, thinking of New Year’s Eves back in London, the sky coloured into sunrise.
John gently straightened the arm, the blue veins carving meandering rivers of blood beneath his skin. He traced a question into the cluster of puncture marks in the crux of Sherlock’s elbow with a finger, and looked to his friend’s face for the answer.
“And thank you, love, but I’ll manage just fine. You two go and have fun.” She shooed them away. “And call me Jo!” she added as the two walked down the corridor.
“Remember, none of this leaves this room,” John said, wanting to coax whatever was there out of him. “Right, everyone?”
“Well, not in as many words, but he might as well have done,” Mrs Watson replied. “You ought to read it, Sherlock, it’s interesting.”
John thought about Mary. Wondered what she was doing, and whether she still wondered about him sometimes.
John’s feet drew him to Sherlock’s side outside the sports hall. Mike and Molly had waited for him, too, but it was Sherlock’s shoulder John brushed with his own as they walked back to their houses. It was Sherlock’s opinion on the exam John wanted to hear.
While Sherlock did so, John fetched a box of matches. Sherlock dropped the tiny candle into the pumpkin’s cavity, and John lit the wick in a small flare of light. He blew out the match and closed the door before turning off the lights.
John was sitting atop his bunk, fruitlessly trying to think of something to draw for the house art competition. Sherlock was sitting on his desk, absently ripping up bits of paper and burning them in the flame of the Bunsen burner which was waving languidly in the stillness. John’s thoughts were more concerned with his roommate than the competition – he was being quiet. Not unusually so, but he was being the kind of quiet that John’s worry spilled into; it was a hole between them, and Sherlock was still in the bottom with a shovel.
“He’s an upper sixth, they get away with murder,” Sherlock dismissed. “Did Angelo send you a list?” John nodded. “Do you know any of them?” John waved his hand in a
“I went up to the corridor. I tipped out a basket of laundry and stood on it. I pushed on the hatch around a bit until I found the ladder, and pulled it down. I climbed up into the darkness, no idea what I’d find.
“Go back to sleep, John.” It was Sherlock’s voice, calm and quiet. John opened his eyes to see him standing by the window again, in pyjamas and a dressing gown. He was looking out into the world beyond the window, bathed in argentate moonlight.
Sherlock turned his head around very slowly and his eyes met John’s. John tried to hold his ground, but after what he hoped was a respectable length of time, the force of Sherlock’s gaze boring into his eye sockets forced him to turn away. He handed Sherlock the list.
There was a huddle of boys clustered together, seemingly concentrating on a particular patch of grass. They appeared to be talking over one another, glancing at each other every now and again. Sherlock was about to turn away when their coach jogged over. He pushed through the crowd, which parted just long enough to let him through and for Sherlock to see the form of a boy lying on the grass, before the circle closed up again.
“The woman who always wears that hideous necklace, the gold one with too many pendants.” Sherlock elaborated, as if that explained everything.
“Right.” John didn’t question why Sherlock was holding his sister’s foundation, because he was sure he’d get an explanation soon enough.
“Hey, girls, John thinks I’m just about good-looking enough to let me stick my dick in you,” he said sarcastically. “Not exactly a killer pick-up line, is it?”
John put his head in his hands. “You’re insane. Utterly mad. Brilliant, but completely off your rocker.”
The following Tuesday, John was walking out of Dr Day’s classroom after the Herald meeting when he heard a voice call his name. He turned to see Kitty Riley sitting on a desk. She beckoned him over with a finger; he complied.
“What, that you can throw a strangely-shaped ball whilst wearing spiky shoes? Hardly essential for a doctor.”
They fell into step, something John had once thought impossible due to the fact that Sherlock’s legs were at least double the length of his.
John woke the next morning to a bleary vision of Sherlock’s face two inches from the bars that stopped him rolling out of bed in the night.
The score was thirty-two all in the last minute, and Sherlock’s heart was beating irrationally fast.
It was the last day of the half term. John’s bags had been packed since the night before. Sherlock’s stuff was still strewn all over the room, Sherlock himself scribbling something in a notebook.
I know it’s not as momentous as John and Sherlock finally getting their shit together, but there has been another sneaky gift for you in the works for a couple of months which I am thrilled to finally get to share with you all and which I have been (rather unsuccessfully) teasing on
“Oh,” Sherlock said. “So – you and her – ?” Sherlock mentally kicked himself, but pressed on. “Broken up?”
“That’s got to be a school record or something - just-” she checked her watch- “Twenty five minutes! Twenty five minutes into a new year and Sherlock’s already peeved off his teacher. Oh! You’re in his house, aren’t you?”
The tea was cold. Disgusting, really. Why did he let it lose its warmth? How long has he had it in his hand? Did John give it to him? He must have done. Who else would have?
Sherlock made to go and find him, but Mrs Watson laid a hand on his arm. “He’s fine, Sherlock. He’ll be back on in the next fifteen minutes, no-one can keep that boy off a rugby pitch, not even himself. Relax.”
It was Mike’s turn to laugh. “Because you seemed like you were into Sherlock, man. I just got the vibe. Anyway, I know you’re not, ‘cause you told me so, but that’s what I thought at the time.”
He and Harry danced in the falling snow. The flakes were only small, and didn’t seem like they were going to settle, but it was snow, and that was good enough.
“I invited him to parties, but he never came. He never saw any of my friends, I never saw any of his. I only ever saw him or his dad. No siblings, no pets, his mum worked late. So we kind of existed in our own little bubbles where the only points of intersect were each other. It was weird, he was kind of depressing to be around sometimes, but we became quite close anyway. I think because he knew about things my other friends didn’t. I could be a little more open with myself around him, I think.”
“Humans lose skin all the time, it’s nothing big. Did you know that every thirty minutes you lose – ”
Before he could find the scarf, however, he had to find the right platform. He pulled out his phone again and followed Sherlock’s instructions, leading him up some stairs, over a bridge, down some more stairs and to where he was meant to be.
No – it unlocked without obstacle. John clenched the object in his fist and returned to the bathroom.
The old building was filled with people, and they all looked like they knew what they were doing. Even their laughter sounded confident. Harry brushed her hands down her front, trying to smooth out wrinkles she knew weren’t there. She glanced at her mother, who wasn’t much taller than her now.
John and Dan were walking through the park to the tree they had commandeered in the summer between year six and year seven, when they were too big for their boots and the world shone with boyish potential.
“No, I’m fine,” Sherlock said shortly. John watched him struggle with one of the buckles for about thirty seconds before sliding off the bench and crouching in front of his friend. “No, John, I’m – ”
There was a crack, a pause, then blood, and a deep and throbbing pain in his hand, which he made sure not to react to. The faces of Angelo’s cronies were ones of shock, and John looked at each and every one in the eyes before spinning on his heels and walking away.
Sherlock was expecting a ‘thank you’ of some kind, as John had a tendency to do that sort of thing. But he didn’t receive one - not a verbal one, anyway. There, both of them with elbows on the windowsill, breath fogging up the glass, Sherlock realised that was gratitude, and that was enough.
Sherlock cocked his head. “Hm. I shall follow. The lead is usually the taller one, but…” But John wasn’t paying attention to what Sherlock was saying because Sherlock had grabbed John’s hand and was placing it on Sherlock’s waist, slotting their other hands together. Sherlock nudged John’s appendages until he deemed his frame to be correct enough, and then trailed his fingers up John’s back to encourage him to stand up straight and John had to physically fight down a shiver.
John felt as if they were all posing for a camera, a perfect picture of family life. Polite conversation, caring gestures, respectful jokes - complete ignorance of the countless nights of slamming doors, shouted expletives, smashed plates and blood-shot eyes that they had all been reduced to not so long ago. A glass vase, teetering on the edge of a mantelpiece.
“You thinking of doing that work experience thing?” John asked Sherlock that afternoon. Sherlock looked up from the eyepiece of his (stolen) microscope and fixed John with a look that could have caused entire armies to drop their weapons and scamper away in retreat.
“I didn’t speak until I was five,” he said flatly. “Did you read the bit about me swimming? She’s implying I was involved with Carl’s death.”
No-one apart from Sherlock, that is, but John wasn’t exactly over the moon about his roommate’s method, either.
“‘Seeing as you can take your test in a year, I thought now would be a good time to start to teach you to drive.’
His teacher said something about going to print off a sheet and left the room, and John let out a small breath of relief. He took out his phone as chatter erupted around him.
Her mother was fishing about in a cupboard for something, and before Harry could even form a rough draft of her apology, she turned around and jumped.
John watched the people around him. There were lots of younger kids, going too fast for their ability and skidding into one another and the walls. A couple of pre-teen boys were racing each other, weaving in and out of the rest of the crowd with ease. One girl must have taken lessons, because she was doing all sorts of tricks – one leg, spinning, even jumping – in the middle of the circle where there were less people. And, of course, plenty of couples using gripping onto each other for dear life.
judging by the post-it stuck to the front cover of the one her pencil case sat atop, her name and house scribbled in a middle-aged woman’s writing.
The hand on his shoulder squeezed reassuringly. He could feel the skin of John’s wrist just below his collarbone, warm against Sherlock’s wind-chilled chest.
Smith folded his arms. “Mm. They met at a swimming gala. From rival teams. Don’t get me wrong, my nephew probably provoked him, but Powers broke two of his ribs. My sister was distraught, it was very annoying.”
Doyle’s senior team’s first match was against Dickens, and John and Sherlock caught each other’s gaze as someone shouted through a megaphone that two minutes remained until kick-off. Sherlock’s expression was serious, but he gave him the tiniest of nods, and that was all the encouragement John needed.
“Oh, stop fretting; no, I’m not,” Sherlock snapped, halting John mid-lecture. Then his voice turned softer, and he pointedly glanced at the girl now nearing them as he said, “Wait.”
“So you say that he you just walked in and he was fitting?” John asked as he, Sherlock, and the boy, whose name turned out to be Percy Phelps, strode down the road to Dickens.
Sherlock looked down, eyebrows drawn together. He touched a finger to his nostril. It came away smudged with dark liquid.
“The school sent a policeman 'round to Doyle to get rid of the syringes from Sherlock’s lair, and search turn his things upside down for anymore cigarettes or drugs or generally dangerous things. Only once that was done was he allowed out of bed, after about a week in the san. Lestrade boarded up the hatch to the attic and Sherlock moved back into the dorm.
“I’m not. She obviously knows exactly what dog whistles to blow to convince her skeptical readers that she’s confirming their beliefs about me, while giving herself plausible deniability
John nodded, somewhat reassured. “I can see why Viola would want to set you two up, though. You’d be a good couple. Aesthetically, I mean. You look quite similar.”
Minutes later, Doyle burst into the night, laughter echoing off the buildings into the arctic air that was making their breath cloud in front of them.
The next day, John found himself, at Sherlock’s behest, standing by the door of Tolkien house when the bell rang to close the final lesson of the day. Gradually, pupils began to appear from doorways, and soon they flooded the street in front of John. He shot tight smiles to Tolkien boys who looked curiously at him on their return to their house and scanned the crowds for a small head of dark hair.
John was avoiding the gaze of his maths teacher. So far, he had only been called on to answer a question once, and was currently concentrating on making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible. He could feel his phone vibrating every so often, but decided against running the risk again. He knew Sherlock would sulk at him later for it, but John decided he could bare it.
“I know you do,” Mike said in a tone of voice John couldn’t exactly work out. Before he could question the boy, however, the head of the music department started speaking again.
John considered how to respond to that, but decided not to retaliate as Sherlock dropped his arms a little at Mike’s words, giving John an opportunity to slide the tray away from him. “You know, I don’t think you have ever asked to borrow anything, you just take what you want when you want it,” he said, and Mike nodded as if to say
“Well, she’s been sneaky. She’s not said anything outright. But, she mentions a long stay in the san, something about epic lows and
John sighed, and said, “By that he means that it was our pleasure. Well, not pleasure, but you know. You're welcome.”
A look at Sherlock told him his friend was feeling the same thing. The coloured lights from the stage danced over his pensive features, and John stifled a yawn as the song ended to copious applause.
He hadn’t looked at Sherlock again, shifting and swallowing when Sherlock had answered his name with a loud “Present, sir.”
“Hi,” John replied. There was a pause in which whatever they had been arguing about hung between the two parties, but neither seemed to want to break the awkward stalemate with John in the room. “Do you want to speak to Sherlock, or…?”
John shook his head, his gaze finding something in the middle distance. “One second I was on a bench, the next I was in the changing room, wearing that - that vest, and the earpiece was already in my ear. He told me my instructions and I carried them out. I didn’t see another soul apart from you.” Sherlock sighed, mind already turning itself upside down. But John spoke again. “I did recognise the voice, though,” he added. “It was Richie. Richie Brook.”
John could feel Bill’s presence on the other side of the aisle in his English Literature classroom. He could feel his restless energy. The boy was buzzing.
“Best costume now. I think it’s fair to say there was a clear winner here, but we must also give mention to Pullman for their impeccable Elvis quiffs. However, congratulations and kudos to the boys who bared their legs for us all; Dickens with
Sherlock shrugged. John heaved a sigh and got down from his bed, quickly changing out of his uniform before the two boys left for the dining hall.
There was a pause. Harry and Clara exchanged looks. John discreetly kicked his sister in the shin with his heel, and with a grunt, she pulled Clara away, back into the lounge, leaving Sherlock and John alone.
“Nope,” John sighed, sitting up. “Practise starts again at eight. Good thing I haven’t got any homework.”
“So why couldn’t you talk earlier? Was I interrupting something private?” John asked, with an expression that Sherlock had sometimes seen other people use when they were being lewd or suggestive, and Sherlock suddenly realised that John was joking about something sexual, about Sherlock himself doing something sexual – but John knew that Sherlock had no sexual partners since Victor had been taken into the iron embrace of the law, so what was he-? Oh.
Judging by the speed at which Anderson’s eyebrows reached for his hairline, he was just as surprised at that proposition as John was. But the rain, now audible on the leaves of the trees they were standing under, seemed to hurry his acceptance.
“Sherlock! What is wrong with you?” John’s face was angry, covering up his concern. Sherlock could see that. Angry about what? He hadn’t said anything. Or did he – did he say something? Victor had told him once that he couldn’t control his mouth when he was high. He’d just been deducing, but that was involuntary – did he say it aloud? Oh.
If Sherlock concentrated, he could feel each of John’s ribs through their shirts. John was hot, skin almost burning to the touch, and slightly damp, and Sherlock could feel every inch of it that was pressed flush against his own, from his legs up to his neck, and he had never felt someone so close to him before, so close he felt they might begin to fuse together.
“You’ve met him; how many friends do you expect he has? No, I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock has.”
John felt each movement of the bow, each press of Sherlock’s fingers on the strings. Felt the pull of something he didn’t quite understand. Felt his feet on a cliff’s edge.
most enjoyed of the house competitions, so don’t knock it ‘till you try it. Oh, and if I hear one single person say anything about it being ‘gay’, I will supervise their Saturday detention myself.”
They slipped out of the kitchen. John put his finger to his lips and took exaggeratedly careful steps down the corridor, arms out for balance, and Sherlock felt a giggle bubble up inside him. He put a hand over his mouth to keep himself quiet.
His roommate had caught up with him, and was now walking beside him, a little breathless. Doyle wasn’t far now. Would just have to get to their room without John seeing him – and then what? Lock their door? How? With what? Barricade it?
Sherlock scoffed and looked away, but after a moment, his eyes flicked back to John and he seemed to be fighting back a smile.
Which was why he was a little taken aback when his father turned to him in WH Smith’s and said, “Parents aren’t supposed to write their children’s eulogies.”
She had then said something about leashes and 'having dinner', and Sherlock had ignored the message.
“Mmm, if they play loud enough they should be able to drown you out, dear, don’t worry,” his mother agreed with Harry.
John stood froze. The man was smiling, but it did not comfort John in the slightest. It made the man look like a reptile. John instantly knew this was not a teacher standing before him.
John hummed. It was rare that Sherlock said something he actually meant, and comments like that were often the tip of the proverbial iceberg – a metaphor John thought particularly suited to his arctic roommate. John had voiced this thought to Sherlock once, and he had responded, “You should meet my brother.” John had argued that he had, and they had bickered before forgetting the conversation entirely. Or pretending to. As was their way.
At first, John was glad for the water cooling his cheeks, as he felt immensly clumsy, as if he had no control over his legs. Throughout, however, Sherlock was talking to him; giving him pointers and tips and advice, telling him to straighten his legs or concentrate on his hips, and soon enough, he told John to work in the arms.
John laughed, then. And laughed. And laughed. And Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh with him, John’s mirth infectious.
Gloves firmly wedged on his hands, he was back out again, and wandering down his street with few objectives.
Sherlock was stretched across her sofa, a book in his hands. John was sitting cross legged at the other end, facing Sherlock, one hand resting on Sherlock’s feet where they lay in his lap, the other arm resting on the back of the sofa. The lights were low, the fire popping and crackling merrily in the grate.
As he rambled on sourly, Dr Smith rounded the desk and John followed him into the waiting area, Sherlock behind. The man reached through the doorway of the small office and retrieved a coat.
He stopped walking, his hands stilling in his hair, his mouth falling open, revealing the neon blue of his gum shield.
Mrs Hudson was waiting for him at the foot of the staircase. “We know you can’t quite… you know. But we like to have you sit and chat, dear.”
John took a sip of his beer, and only then did he realise that there was a distinct lack of grumpy sarcasm in the room.
John straightened up and his face was so laced with disbelieving joy that Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth pulling in relieved response. John was laughing silently, faced florid and screwed up with the effort after having run so far so fast, and scrambling up the old oak like there were rabid dogs at their heels.
He felt his breath catch and his smile fade. Mike had been right. He did have to tell him, and now. Sherlock deserved to know the truth before agreeing to John’s proposal. John couldn’t let him get so excited about a life he might not even want if he knew how John felt. That wouldn’t be fair, that wouldn’t be right. And if Sherlock agreed without knowing and John settled his heart into their new home and then Sherlock found out and wanted to end it, to leave -
“Thank you,” John said, and turned towards the gate. As he heard the car pull away, it struck him that he had no idea where he was.
“That graffiti of a pig in the head master’s gown that appeared on the side of the cricket pavilion last half term.”
When he returned, John found Sherlock in the same spot he’d left him, thankfully. He was half expecting him to have got bored and run off during the two-minute interlude of John’s absence.
John didn’t reply, dancing enthusiastically but dismally, and Sherlock couldn’t help snorting a laugh. After a moment, he went to the mortar and scooped up a handful of the thick potion. He stepped up behind John, who was too focussed on his thrashing dance moves to notice, and, the composed part of him screaming in horror at his behavious, smeared the potion over his face.
“Well, there probably is some zinc oxide in there, actually. Plus some magnesium silicate, not to mention the dimethicone and polysorbates, and all the – ”
As Sherlock was making his way out of the hall, he heard his name being called. He turned around to see the Head Master and the head of Year Eleven standing expectantly, arms folded across their chests.
John scrubbed a hand over his face in frustration. He lamented the organisation – or seeming lack thereof – of Boots under his breath and continued raking the shelves with his eyes.
John did so, and caught sight of Léa, rooted to the spot in the middle of the room. She was wearing an expression of shock that instantly changed into a scowl as her gaze met John’s.
“Of course. I was just headed there myself. I’ll show you, come on.” She walked off, her surely-not-regulation heels clacking on the concrete. As they walked, the girl pulled out her phone, a Blackberry, and her long-nailed fingers darted with expertise on the keyboard, typing faster than John had previously thought was possible. After a few moments of silence, John said,
“Yes, well.” Eddie cleared his throat. “The music has to be live, no backing tracks allowed, so in order to pick a song, we – myself and the rest of the Upper Sixth – need to know by the middle of this week who can play an instrument to performance standards. Any instrument; sitar, harpsichord, castanets, whatever. If this applies to you, please come and see me by Tuesday night. We need all the talent we have.”
. He was aware Sherlock was watching him out of the corner of his eye, so he picked up his fork again and scooped up some peas while he took out his phone.
“I should hope so,” Sherlock said, going to her and retrieving the small plastic box from his pocket. “I need you to text me what chemical compounds you find in this mud.” He handed her the container, looking directly into her eyes. “Now, please.”
“Good, thanks.” Mike turned to leave, but spun around again. “Oh, and by the way, Gregson wants to see us all in the common room at seven, he told me to tell everyone. And John, I’m in room nineteen, if you need me, or if Sherlock gets too… well,

As John shifted to the fridge, Sherlock tracked his movement, and as the shorter boy crouched down to rummage for something, Sherlock’s eye was caught by a pile of letters on top of the fridge. One letter, specifically. It was three down in the pile, but the name written on the envelope was clearly visible due to the boy who collected the house’s post that morning being late for his first lesson and so being less than careful with the way he put down the missives. A name written in exactly the same handwriting as the three words emblazoned in yellow on the east-facing wall of Sherlock’s mind palace.
Washing detergent and deodorant. John smelt plain. And Sherlock wanted to bury his face in his skin so he could smell nothing else.
“But how could M have known about that? And why would M be telling us about danger when M was the one creating the danger? It makes no sense.”
“It’s not,” Kitty said, her voice a little less brash now, her gaze a little more serious. “I promise, it’s not me.”
Sherlock had been fifteen years old, and trying to break into the head of the music department’s flat. He hadn’t been as adept at lock-picking in those days, and so it was no surprise that someone inside the apartment heard his frustrated efforts and approached the door on feet so soft that Sherlock was taken completely by surprise when the handle began to turn. He was even more taken by surprise when, crouching as he was, the door opened, he found himself staring straight at the pale, naked form of a girl. Her pubic hair would remain in his mind for a very, very long time; so dark against her porcelain skin, trimmed neatly, not a curl out of place.
Sherlock had jumped out of his skin when he heard the door open and had turned his back to the rest of the room, trying to subtly burrow into the clothes hanging in the wardrobe.
The kiss was hard and messy and there was too much tongue – Sherlock was trying to fish the pill out of Victor’s mouth but it seemed the boy had other ideas. He was moaning into his mouth and Sherlock fought the urge to shudder. Once one pill was in each mouth they broke apart and swallowed – Sherlock trying not to think about the other boy’s saliva going down with it – and almost immediately Victor’s lips were back to crushing his.
Over dinner, John didn’t mention the news report because he already knew what her reaction would be.
The sun was beginning to sink as John’s train pulled away from the platform. He plugged in his earphones and rested his head against the window. His thoughts wandered as he closed his eyes, to Mike, to Lestrade, to his teachers and even the rising bell and the horrible metal bed frames.
“Answer my question, John,” he said. John yanked the boot off his foot with a little too much force and it went flying out of his hands, nearly knocking over a lamp.
The rest of Doyle’s swimmers had commandeered a space of poolside by the changing rooms, sitting on the towels they’d laid on the wet tiles. And it was then that John finally spotted Sherlock.
While she had been talking, Sherlock had been rummaging through the drawer in Muhammad’s beside table, and now he straightened up. In his hand he held a large tub of something, and before John could ask what it was, Nadia explained.
He had previously thought that rugby was a mindless game, for thugs and brutes with more muscles than sense, but watching John play, seeing so much of his friend in those calculated movements, the dodges, the quick flicks of the hands making the ball spin so precisely, the shouts of encouragement – he was beginning to rethink.
The applause afterwards had no visible effect on the boy – his face remained stony as ever – but John could practically see his ego swelling. However, the moment was deflated somewhat when Eddie called on the rest of the house to sing along.
It was nearly seven, so John ran downstairs and out to Lestrade’s dustbins as quickly as he could. He buried the package deep inside the non-recyclables container and had just entered room twenty-one when the bell rang to signal the start of another week.
Sherlock fumbled, and John watched him totter, but he regained his balance and tried again, with a little more success. “Who made you the font of all ice skating knowledge?”
The door of the nurse’s office creaked open, the pupil emerging. John slid off the desk. He could feel Jamie’s eyes on his back as he walked out of the room.
“So. Obviously, you two being the only two who ran, one of you got head of house and one of you got deputy. Do you want to know which of you got which?”
John frowned. “No, it wasn’t Sherlock – why does everyone think that?” And then hoped no-one would answer.
Sherlock felt John’s laughter in his own throat, felt it bubble. “That’s a little more difficult. If you look – ” Sherlock began, but was interrupted by a violent buzzing in his pocket. The laughter was extinguished instantly. He sighed and took out his phone. It was Mycroft. He answered the call and put the phone to his ear. “Yes?”

After the fireworks had ended in a blaze of light that looked as if the sky were ripping apart, the camera panned back to the crowd, who had begun to link arms.
He left Sherlock in his kitchen and positioned the vegetable on his front step, the rain having dissipated to a light drizzle. When he returned, Sherlock was still standing in the middle of the room as he’d left him.
Sherlock stopped underneath the goal post, looking up at the horizontal bar above his head. He spun in a slow circle. John watched him.
John watched Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. “No promises,” he replied, and there was just enough wryness in his tone to comfort John that the conversation hadn’t upset him.
