"Sorry, what?" Sherlock blinks.
All night, he dreams of William.
Just before noon, the two women insist that Sherlock return to Baker Street in order rest up. Sherlock argues, but John urges him to go. He’s been there for nearly two days, and besides—John will likely spend the entire afternoon sleeping.
But before he rests, John has got to shower. So he fights back his exhaustion, steps into the tiny stall, and turns the tap as hot as it will go. He lets himself enjoy the water that pours over his body, washing off whatever remains from the day—all of the dirt and grime and blood and emotions and death.
“Hm.” John tries to craft a response only
Anderson tilts his head in thought, his eyes flitting to John for confirmation.
That's when he catches John out of his peripheral view. He turns, and they lock eyes. Sherlock’s grow wide. He pulls himself up from the grass, the glow of his skin fading as if all the blood has rushed from his head.
"What am I doing?" John inquires, though his smug visage conveys that he knows
"Stamford."
John lifts his hand, extending his fingers as far as they'll go. "I believe we're supposed to put them on for each other."
"Hey! It wasn't obvious to you either, Sherlock!" John protests.
"Not at all," John says. "I'm glad to be working with you."
Sherlock snorts a laugh. "Uncanny!"
John turns to face him. "Lie back."
Sherlock watches him go, delighted that he is still entirely naked. In fact, he watches him very, very closely. Studies him, really. Every move. And John is giving him quite a bit of material to work with, so he keeps his eyes fixed on him until he’s out the door.
"You've got something on your face," Sherlock responds listlessly.
When I began writing “Dive” in December of 2019—just six months ago—the world was different. “Sheltering in place” and “essential worker” and “Zoom sessions” were expressions that hadn’t yet made their way into the public consciousness. George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s murders had not yet spurred a revolution.
“Sounds really lovely.” Sherlock stares at him for several seconds before responding, appreciating a side of John he's never seen: childlike sentimentality.
Sherlock's breath hitches, and he audibly swallows—but he tilts his head, offering the rest of his neck in invitation.
“That’s a lovely necklace you’re wearing,” Sherlock remarks, noting the tiny crucifix hanging from a gold chain around Brook’s neck. There is an inscription on it:
The way Sherlock feels as he slides into John's tight, warm, perfect heat—the throbbing, aching pleasure—is something he's never even imagined. Something of dreams, of fantasies, ridiculous things only poets write about. Every sensory cell at his disposal is buried into the most wonderful and beautiful human he’s ever met. How on earth did he become lucky enough to even know this man, to become his best friend, to share a bed with him?
“Atom,” John reminds him.
Mrs. Hudson doesn’t seem too bothered.
“I’m not
would have sufficed.”
He steps closer towards Sherlock. “First things first, though!” He returns to his pleasant Irish lilt. “Here’s what I was envisioning: you watch as I torture that...angry little pet of yours. John, was it?” Another step closer. “Seems the two of you get on quite well. Should I be jealous?”
one of John's pretty body parts. He mentally scolds himself for being so perverse, and fills his head with unappealing images.
"Oh." Sherlock freezes. His stomach twists and his throat goes dry. “Mrs. Hudson must have taken too many herbal soothers and forgotten to clean the shelves.”
"Such as?"
Following their unscheduled—though enjoyable—rendezvous, John and Sherlock don their spectacular couple’s costume. Each of them wears a chest piece, created by Sherlock—with twelve small foam balls masterfully glued together at the front. Thin wires are wrapped around their shoulders and waists, forming large circles; three additional foam balls are attached to each wire. And of course, to ensure the highest accuracy possible, there are exactly six balls of each colour.
"I'm a complete idiot." Sherlock doesn't wait for an invitation, bursting into Brook's flat without explanation.
"You're being ironic," Sherlock observes. "Because we are already boyfriends. But I'll take bait. Yes, I will be your boyfriend."
It is.
William opens his mouth to speak, but John cuts him off.
"John," he says roughly, taking John's face into his hands and kissing him. The kiss is not soft, nor tender. It burns; it’s possessive, and it's charged with Sherlock's desire. John gives himself over, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist to scoop him in closer. As water pours over their soft naked bodies, they glide their tongues messily over each other's lips, their hard, twitching cocks sliding together. They kiss feverishly, until their mouths are red and chapped and fatigued; their skin all dried out from the water.
"Getting to hold you close like this," John whispers, "—is the most incredible feeling in the world. To be with you here and now, in our temporary safe space, while the skies collapse around us. Experiencing the sound of your breath, the scent of your aftershave, the sensation of your cool skin against mine. It all makes me happier than I ever thought possible."
"That's wonderful! Congratulations!" she says. "How long have you two been married?"
“We also did a minimal amount of sleeping. Is he...what?”
”You were into Texas?”
“Mrs. Hudson suggested it awhile ago. We’ve been working to make it suitable for your return. We weren’t planning on it being this soon, but it will have to do, I suppose. I’ll transfer most of the items that could cause potentially harmful chemical reactions as soon as I—”
He's been in love with you forever, hasn’t he?
“Sherlock, get into the limousine,” Mycroft demands. “Immediately.”
Sherlock cannot subdue a wave of utter indignation. "I most certainly am not."
"You're touching me," Sherlock observes.
“There are some things we should probably tell you, John.” Molly places a hand on his shoulder.
"As you wish," he says, brushing a kiss over the crown of Sherlock’s head and bringing his fingers to rest at his temple. He trails them slowly over Sherlock's cranium, combing through the thick curls and retracing his path.
"John!" he calls out, moving quickly to catch up with him. He takes his hand.
“What do you think, eh?” Stamford waggles his eyebrows over his spectacles as he gestures towards the women at the booth. “Their names are Marci and Elizabeth. Met them at the pool table. Told ‘em it was my birthday, and they asked if they could join us.”
is the
“Irene.” His words are as steady as her grip. “I’m going to ask one more time: is Moriarty dead?”
So he walks to his bedroom, takes his phone from his pocket and checks it one more time. Nothing. He sets it on his bedside table and puts on his nightgown.
Sherlock feels light-headed and a bit out of breath. Something stirs deep in his stomach; he prays it’s something he ate.
"I am ten times the man he was," Moriarty roars.
"What, Sherlock?" John groans. His eyelids fly open and he stares up at him, displeased.
And it bloody well is. His encounter with William is the first thing on his mind when he awakens in the morning. And when he makes his breakfast. And when he takes out the rubbish. And when he showers—especially when he showers. It’s the first thing on his mind as he collects his textbooks and school bags and walks to the cafe to study. And as he orders his regular tall soy latte, and as the couple sitting next to the window offer him their seat, and as he opens up his anatomy textbook to his favorite chapter.
“Funny thing.” Moriarty’s voice drops to a furtive whisper. “I know I delivered John earlier. So where has he run off to?” He steps closer still, his predatory gaze drifting up and down Sherlock’s body. “I would love to play with the both of you—but he can watch, instead, if that’s more his thing.”
Until we meet again: I love you, I love you, I love you.
Sherlock fumbles for his phone in his pocket and pulls it out. It promptly flies out of his hands and next to John's head, just as a second text alert chimes in.
Anderson snorts. "Freak's boyfriend. She's referring to you, Doctor Watson."
"Yes."
"Hmm. Something you don't know? I'll have to think about it."
“Of course,” Sherlock responds, raising a suggestive eyebrow. “But we’ve gone to bed together for the past three weeks, you know. Shall I expect this to be different?”
Sherlock digs his fingernails into the skin of John's shoulder.
"You must," Sherlock insists.
William dips his forefinger slowly into the bottle, not breaking away from John's grip. John brings his hand back to his mouth, and William moans as John flicks his tongue over his fingertips.
Sherlock lays his head back on his pillow. And with John next to him, the cyclone in his brain fades into a light breeze on an autumn afternoon, bright from copper leaves.
“...What did you say?” he asks.
We're in the midst of a heat wave!"
William’s eyelids fall closed. “Yes.”
assumed that we're a couple, haven't they? Of course! Then why would they be surprised to hear it?"
"Jesus Christ! Will you shut the hell up!" Another voice hollers from an adjacent building. “Do you have any idea what bloody time it is?"
“Did he drag you off somewhere to question you about me?” Sherlock asks, but he already knows the answer. “I’m sorry.”
"Oh, for god's sake, why?" Sherlock doesn't think he can handle another moment of John's pensive silence.
"From geese?" John is nearly in tears by now.
is when he notices it.
Sherlock brings his hand to his mouth; he can still taste John on his lips. "Ermmmmm..." he answers weakly.
"There are two."
He’s just learned from his doctor that he'll be going home tomorrow. The reality of the situation has finally caught up with him. It's his last night here, and he's going to have to figure out how to tell Sherlock.
Sherlock gazes back down to their joined hands and the rings that they exchanged just a couple of hours prior. And John is still left to wonder: for Sherlock, is it all in the name of the performance? A bit of extreme method acting that he’ll be able to turn off like the flick of a switch? Completely unaware of John’s very real feelings? He wouldn’t put it past him.
John groans, rubbing his temples harder as if to revive the memory. “I was...in the casino… and a woman slapped me…”
“Not foolish at all!" John blurts out. Apparently, he still knows a couple of words. He takes another drink of wine, hoping it may lubricate his vocal chords.
“That was amazing.”
“I—can’t thank you two enough," John says. "After I quite literally ruined your lovemaking session—“
Sherlock dips his head to take John’s mouth into his, kissing with a passion and emotion that John has never felt. Not in real life, and not in any dream. Sherlock makes love to him with his whole body. And although John knows that they’re in their bed, in this dream—inside their humble abode—he swears he's ascended far above that.
They make it to the top of the stairway and through the front door of their flat before John’s strength begins to wane. Sherlock must sense it happening; he lowers one arm to his waist to steady him, walking at his side as they make their way to Sherlock’s room.
“Alright.” Sherlock thinks John shouldn’t need to do anything alone now that he’s got him—if that’s what he wants, however, that’s what he’ll do.
John hesitates. “Sherlock…”
Sarah groans with embarrassment. “Gab, do you really have to flirt with my ex?”
They’ve got a few hours to kill before The Woman arrives, and Gabriela convinces him to hit the casinos. He wins thirty dollars and loses forty-five, but he’s thrilled to discover that drinks are free. As the day goes by, he tries not to feel guilty about passing the time so idly; deep down, he knows there’s not much he can do until he talks to Irene. So although Sherlock is at the forefront of his mind, he allows himself to take in the sights.
"It's only been a couple of weeks," John says. "We've told nobody, and yet—”
And the love he has for Sherlock fills him up whole; fills his body and brain, and soul, and somehow surges far beyond that.
Gabriela kisses her on the cheek reassuringly. “I’ll be thinking about you when I’m playing with the dominatrix.”
“Yes.”
And behind a locked door, the two men bring one another to ecstasy with their hands and their mouths and their hushed words. In the evenings, while Sherlock stands over John’s wheelchair, palms flat against the wall while he rocks his hips into John’s mouth. In the mornings, hands beneath the bedsheets, Sherlock’s cold lips pressed to John’s neck, both of them still groggy from sleep.
John frowns. “Pardon?”
“Perhaps not. Neither should you. You can't simply allow someone to force you into a life of exile."
They return to Sarah’s car, which, by the grace of god, has not been ticketed or towed. Sarah turns the stereo back on, and John makes her promise not to play any love songs.
Gabriela gives him a half-smile and nods. “Let’s not decide anything right now. Let's get some food and some coffee. Maybe after that, we can figure out what to do next."
"Okay." If it weren't for the pesky pull of gravity, John would be in no hurry whatsoever to leave Sherlock's arms.
As he takes the first step away from the door, he hears the locks of the entryway clicking loudly, followed by wind slamming the door open. A posh baritone voice calls out over the howling breeze.
"Yes." Sherlock takes John’s hand into his and slowly guides it downwards. "How very observant, you are, Doctor Watson,” he says as he moves it further to the space between his legs. "...Where it counts, anyway."
John smiles at her. “Thank you.”
“Hmm. Suppose I use a fake name?” John muses.
They’re high on adrenaline and the hunger to seek comfort after all they’ve endured; the only thing on their minds is each other.
“Because, you know...I have a job? And because I occasionally go on dates? Thanks for bringing
Because as confused as Sherlock is about whatever he’s feeling for John, there is one thing he does know:
“It’s a bit unconventional. Slightly morbid. Definitely dangerous.”
John can't help but wonder—for Sherlock, is this all simply a means to an end? When he kisses him like this, when he moves his hips like this, is it really all just an act?
"You've got some very good ideas," Sherlock reassures him.
She laughs again. “It’s fine,” she says almost timidly. “I get that a lot. I’m 23, actually, but I was homeschooled, so I started university early.”
And Sherlock loves him, too.
Sherlock turns on his side away from him. “Goodnight, John.”
Sarah greets him at the door with a warm smile and a soft kiss on the cheek. “John,” she says, embracing him tightly. “It’s so great to see you. You look fantastic.”
“It’s my tiresome elder brother, Mycroft,” Sherlock says with a roll of his eyes.
John laughs again. He hasn't once looked away, nor missed a beat of music.
"Talk about what?" John asks with a roll of his hips.
“Blankets!" he declares.
"Irene said something similar," Sherlock muses. "Molly, too."
Hoping to beat him there, Sherlock executes his characteristic long, graceful strides; John, his characteristic scamper, and yet, remarkably, the smaller man catches up.
Sherlock’s not expressly concerned.
"And whose fault is that?" Sherlock takes a bite. Mmm, delicious.
John shakes his head, shoving his hands deeper into his coat pockets. “I shouldn’t have come here, actually. I was just leaving. I’ll...bye.”
Does Sherlock love John, too?
Sherlock tilts his head back to look into his eyes—royal blue and full of certainty.
something? What did I miss?"
"There's got to be a button for this," Sherlock sighs. "I can't seem to find—”
Sherlock’s patience is already wearing thin. He lifts a brow before leaning in very, very slowly.
They glance at one another again—this time with utter confusion.
“Used my last one.” (He’s got two left.)
Sautillé - a short, fast mid-bow stroke with a bounce or rebound of the strings.
Sherlock smirked, "Well, I don't think anyone would ask you to do anything straight, after that."
“I’ve been overlooking another instrument. The voice.”
"Mm. And the Woman."
John laughed. "Much good it did us before. Good luck to them. Though perhaps this one stuck?"
tell," snarled Sherlock.
His breath stuttered as he caught sight of John, sitting on the porch with an empty chair beside him. His eyes were closed with his head leaned back, bathing in the daylight.
His time with Victor tested then cemented this belief. His descent into addiction placing the final seal, goaded by the acrid debasement of accepting Mycroft's assistance to get clean. All his struggles, all his brilliance yet he collapsed into dysfunction over something so trivial as a passing taste of bliss in another being's arms. Soon replaced by the soul-gutting want of chemicals. It was comical. He could recite the formulae, the chain of processes affecting his exceptional mind. But knowledge this time was no shield, provided no defense. If anything it plunged him deeper into a spiral of self-deprecation at his inability to logic himself out of the trap of his senses.
"This Victor," John bit out. "Whereabouts might I find him?"
for your continued encouragement, and inspiration as talented writers in your own rights.
John raised an eyebrow. “Sounds pretty innocent.”
There was something about her he could not name that seemed out of place. He had Mycroft continuing to dig. But his own judgement was that despite any secrets she may hide, her love for John was true. Whatever was necessary and possible to protect his friend, he would take those steps. Even from his own sadness and regret. John had suffered far more than his share. He deserved this happiness.
Sherlock grasped both of John's wrists tightly and pulled them to his chest. "You can now. You can do anything you'd like."
“No one. Just what we knew before, that
Distracting, complex, and so very human. But boring, John Watson was indeed not.
Sherlock? I'm sorry. I know you hate sentiment. And I told you that already. Repeated myself. Horrors. I'm sorry. I'll never say it again if you don't want. But give me this moment. I
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "No need. It's literally the least I can do to support someone who's spent his day fighting to keep us from turning back the clock a century."
, Nana, Uncle My..”
A clatter arises. To Will it seems that every voice shouts in his ear at once. He stands motionless, a bit shell-shocked at the anger thrown his way a few moments earlier which is still dispersing. His hands hang at his sides and students shove past him. Several hard stares come his way. An older youth steers a sniffling smaller child to the arms of an adult.
Sherlock grinned, watching their child direct his husband as he yet again ran against the wind to try and race the wheeling kite aloft. The gusting wind dropped suddenly and broad brown and purple wings tipped tail over tea kettle. Sherlock winced as the dragon's maw whacked John in the head. He half rose to run over and assess the damage, but remembered their explicit bargain about this particular activity. With a deep sigh, he settled back down.
John Watson had slipped through his armor from the first. And Sherlock had given himself wholly to the man, no coming back. No regrets, and also no hope of ever having these feelings returned in full. No hope of the miracle now in his arms. Sherlock had lived without hope for so long. What was one more silent hunger?
She never understood how both Sherlock and Mycroft had missed who Mary really was. Although, Sherlock was so blinded by his feelings, wanting desperately to not want more from John, she could see him making the oversight. But what's the point of being an overwhelmingly over-protective mastermind of the former British empire if you can't even protect your brother and the person he cares most about from a ruddy assassin taking up residence in their very home? Mary had been in the same house with their parents even!
Sherlock leaned towards him. The light of the fire flickered across the nut brown sheen of his instrument. "You can ask, John."
"No, love. Course not. Quite the reverse."
"You haven't been doing your exercises." Sherlock's tone was accusatory.
The detective sat on Mrs Hudson's couch and cradled Rosie on his lap in the curve of his arm. The bag and extra nappies were neatly gathered on the table. Martha sipped her last cup of tea and pondered his continued presence.
“I promise.”
"Sherlock.." John's voice was breathy and low. The detective answered, muttering the man's name repeatedly as he scattered tender kisses across John's mouth, his cheek, temple. Whisper soft he set his lips to each eyelid.  Then Sherlock slid lower in John's hold to lavish a line of burning kisses down his neck.
"In your hand. Oh, good. Please do take that shirt off."
They sat in quiet together. Rosie finished her bottle. John set it aside. She waved her hands and cast her head about, beginning to fuss.
John had enjoyed a long quiet time watching her from his place lying on the blanket. His latest novel cracked open in his hands, husband tucked into the crook of his arm, long forgotten phone slipped down on the sleeping man's chest. The puffs of breath from that beautiful mouth proof of life, like their child's happy cries beneath a wide open sky. John breathed it in again in memory. Deep and solid and his.
Inquisitive fingers retrieve the object and hold it up to the light. A small brow wrinkles and eyes shift sidewise skeptically. "It doesn't look different."
Rosie nodded, dismissing his heartfelt lecture and accepting the conclusion as simple common sense. She returned to the question at hand, gesturing to their chart. "So if I examine my assumptions here, Papa, it’s not very accurate to say that if someone plays an instrument or sings, that they can read music."
. Sherlock supported him, but he could see the pride the detective felt in Rosie’s independence and ambitious planning. John had to laugh thinking of his own slapdash relationship with school until he found medicine, and his sister Harriet’s disastrous career in academia.
John retreated back upstairs. He tossed and turned, watching the sky lighten. Then, a sound arose.
Sherlock recognized familiar voices. Lestrade from one direction, Molly from another, converging on him asking what should be done. Watching the tweens, their families and consulting his memory, he deduced for them the circumstances of the events: “It was a dare, an unrequited crush, a three-way tangle caused by--oh, hm. Perhaps you should direct the ambulance closer, Lestrade? Molly, I think we have quite enough help at present, could you let gawkers know we have it in hand?”
(retitled)
John was distracted from the words Sherlock was saying, by the expression that was lighting up his face. It looked like expressions he'd seen on his detective's face before, but in superimposition. It combined the fervor he brought to a particularly hard fought solution to a case, with the easeful ecstasy that took him over when the violin gave him what he sought. John nodded thoughtfully and rose to take the finished bottle from Rosie. He lifted her from the chair and brought her back to his place by the fire.
"Quite."
“Not very polite way to treat one’s parent is it?”
So why on earth was he introducing an unknown variable into this intricately constructed life he'd made for himself?
"Of course! I hadn't considered it prior, but yes. Certainly. No, I'm wondering what it means to you. Is this your way of telling me I should be supporting you in something?"
The weight of the clouds had lightened, but the soft
“Good, Bee.”
Swabian
The light was eclipsed now. John looked devastated. "I asked you to be my Best Man."
John frowned. “None of them are new to town, they must have known it was dangerous. What possessed them?”
"Right. Gold warms your tone. Silver brightens. Copper mellows the sound. It's good for beginners."
She heard footsteps from John’s room above. She recognized the light rapid patter of Sherlock’s footfall. Moving swiftly from her place, she avoided him as he came down the stairs. Didn’t know exactly what would happen if one of the living walked right through her. She did not want to find out.
The detective gestured dismissively, but John's loving, stern head shake gave him pause. "Alright. I grant that." A raised eyebrow from John. "And some. Both of us have suffered. But why then do we keep coming back?"
It was simple, really. There was never anyone, Rosie aside, who could compete with what he felt for Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, Only One in the World. Only one in John Watson's heart. His only.
“Yes, I do.” Silver green eyes stared into John’s inquiringly.
"Sherlock," John turned tiredly surrendering to his husband's ministrations. Sherlock tugged impatiently at the jumper John was wearing, spinning him back to face him again. "Oh, yes," John shook his head, reached up to pull his own outer layer off and then wearily began unbuttoning his shirt. Sherlock leaned down to unbuckle his husband's belt and pants.  John could only summon the energy to suggest a deeper smile and raise one eyebrow slightly as he said, "Let's take mercy on Mrs. Hudson and move this inside."
Mrs. Hudson shook her head, frustrated. She touched John’s free hand as he spoke to her doctor.
Rosie stirred. “Sh’lock?” She grabbed at his fingers. “Time to play?”
No, he hadn't imagined it. There was a banging coming from the floor below him. From terror, John's emotions took a 180 turn to fury. He scrabbled out of the bedclothes and grabbed with shaking hands for pajama bottoms in a drawer. His heart pumping, he stalked to the first floor and flung the door open to his flatmate's room.
The bar was brightly lit in the deepening twilight. Music and laughter rang out into the street. All seats were taken inside, so Sherlock leaned against the bar. He paid the bartender for a foaming glass of the ubiquitous local draft and exchanged polite nods with a couple he'd worked with to bale straw a few days prior. All hands were needed on Mrs Radu's farm and he'd been judged fit enough to render service until his departure. Looking around he saw other familiar figures. Unconsciously plucking details from the worn shoes
Sherlock pulled himself upright and said offhand, glancing away, "I'm as interested to hear this from you, too."
Rosie straightened her back. The blonde head tilted and the tip of her small pink tongue made a brief appearance. “
John stopped thinking and pulled Sherlock close. Their grateful, impatient bodies clung together. Their hearts...
With that same glow in his eyes, he looked up at Mrs Hudson. "I have some plans I could use your help with."
Last week, the teacher had reached out to them. Sigur took the call and discussed with her what was proposed before agreeing. Mr Shadid wanted to speak with Will. He understood that Will was choosing to reject the instrument and wanted to offer some other options. He thought it was worth trying to find some arrangement more agreeable to the young man, before he lost the benefit of the time he'd already spent learning. And the potential of what he had to gain.
John’s shoulders slumped in relief. “Is that all?”
"Thank you."
observed in Islam. Asr is afternoon prayer. Maghrib is at sunset.
"He hurt because he cared for you, you know. And that was because of all you'd done for him."
She felt different. Lighter. Her eyes opened and she breathed deep. Thoughts of walks and baking and things to do whirled in her mind. Images of the people she loved - Rosie, John, Sherlock, Mrs. Turner, her sister, her mother - people she hadn’t seen, much less thought of in years or decades - all opening before her mind’s eye.
"Oh God, Sherlock." John's own desire was evident. He shifted, increasing the contact between them. His eyes opening wide in appreciation as he found Sherlock in a similar state. Their kisses became more urgent and Sherlock maneuvered John's body to lay back against the arm of the couch. He tugged impatiently at the burgundy jumper John was wearing. He looked a question and John struggled to rid himself of the garment.
Sherlock was telling the story of how he and Mrs. Hudson had met. His voice was tense, his storytelling rushed. John watched him with warm, care-filled eyes.
“Daddy?”
"That goes both ways then."
And finished! Thank you so much to all who read. I am so grateful for your comments and kudos.
They exchanged a speaking glance. Sherlock began a different tune. John remembered it, but couldn't place it.
"Sherlock, that's almost sweet."
Later, Mrs. Hudson sat on the stair. The sweet strains of music had ceased and shadows began to shroud the dusty corners of 221B.
Injuries?
Sherlock leaned in to nip John's ear lobe lightly. He spoke quietly into John's ear. "You're sure?" His hand resumed its attentions. "We can stop any time you'd like?"
It was harder and harder as the weeks wore on not to slip near and enclose that warm heart in his arms. To touch his lips to John's. To sigh into his neck.
The two men traded silent glances as they slipped down the street. Solitary stars showed their faces overhead, glimmering in the refuge of darkness created by Regent's Park's lightless expanse of green.
“John Hamish Watson,” she said to him, stroking his short silvered hair, “If you think I didn’t know how much Sherlock and you all loved me, maybe you are the idiot he’s accused you of being all these years.”  John’s shoulders shook in odd giggles for a moment, then his breathing calmed, slowly.
He shook his head. Glancing out the window to see the detective pacing irritably back and forth on the pavement. "Not that. My favor. I need a favor. From you."
Sherlock enlists Rosie's aid with a song. John gets a surprise.
“Mycroft saw fit to remind me that I’d never had a relationship last this long without something going terribly wrong.”
“All?” Sherlock snapped, “Isn’t that enough?” He frowned and put his face in his hands. “I’m sorry, John. It’s bringing back bad memories.”
He paused, sheltered by the remains of a shattered building. Close now. He broke cover to make the last dash to reach them and felt an impact like a jolt. His dreaming mind recognized the moment and he suddenly saw the scene as from two vantages. His own body dropping, eternally falling to the ground. A view from above: the enemy forces converging on the ISAF troops, then receding as the thundering force of air fire and pelting winds from rotors sent them scattering.
Mr. Shadid swallows his regret and looks directly at the boy. "That was not what I meant."
Musing happily on the day before him, John headed down to the kitchen to tackle his own contribution to the start of the day. A proper British fry up.
After a few minutes, Rosie dropped off in her father’s arms. The coast seeming clear, Mrs. Hudson joined her boys and leaned against the kitchen table next to Sherlock.
Will realizes that the people around him are making motions as he sees the young girl beside him raise her hands. He searches for a source of this action and finds that Mr Shadid has drawn a series of symbols on the board indicating a rhythm. The children around Will try to clap in time. His eyes narrow and he glares over at his father. The elder Holmes smiles and nods at his son encouragingly. With a huge sigh, Will finds where the group is in the pattern, interprets the meanings quickly, and claps along. His timing is impeccable. His shoulders sag. His eyes roll and he sighs again.
Crashing into independence, the Work had rescued him. In it he had found allies: Lestrade, Molly, the homeless network, and--so very grudgingly it was admitted not even to himself--his inexecrable brother.  And a place, a purpose, in his self-sworn mission.  A new bliss to decipher the hidden mysteries of crime. In the core of the city that had laid its mark on him, even as he had made it his own. London had cast him down to his depths, yet she had raised him again. The balance he had found now was precious. He felt cautious hope that the experimentation that lay behind him had put him on a road that could lead somewhere beyond oblivion.
His eyes rested soft on her. "You've always understood."
Sherlock relaxed. A half smirk quirked the corner of his mouth. "I shudder to think."
John and Sherlock spent some quiet time beside the shifting cove after the ambulance left and the drama ended. The glowing jellies were undisturbed. They’d surely seen this untold times, John reflected. Humans stumbling in where they weren’t wanted and didn’t belong.
"Yes, soon."
time later found Sherlock nervously walking through the margins of his yard. Past the apple trees, blossoms now quiet, the bees tucked up tight in their hives to hide from the rain. He walked beneath the rangy maple that caught his eye earlier. It spread its arms wide above the head of a winding suggestion of a trail. A route Sherlock had taken to reach John's house so many times.
John caught his breath. He barely ever spoke of either of his parents to his child. "Yes, Rosie. How did you..?"
“We see what can be eliminated from the investigation. What doesn’t matter. Then we…” She paused.
"Someone had to." She curled her hand around his and felt it clasp hers in return. "Though I have to say I despaired when you let him marry her." His grip tightened. "I dredged up every last cliche about people moving on when they marry, trying to get through your thick head to tell you how much you were letting go." His face softened with remembered grief. "Oh, Sherlock. You've made your own life as hard or harder than his. And given it up even. You can't keep breaking yourself to try and save the people you love. Try just letting them love you for a change? Maybe?"
"An arrogant asshole," Victor  grins happily.
“So, John, what do you think?” Sherlock repeats his question and returns John’s attention to the dead body on the floor.
Making the tenth cup of coffee John suddenly realizes that it is rather dangerous to add any additions to the coffee without any asking because Sherlock can have an allergy. That’s why the next cup with coffee if followed be a little saucer with ginger and a glass of pure water. Molly is surprised . She raises  her eyebrows  up but doesn’t give any comment. She stands a little bit longer near Sherlock’s table and John is catching their eyes and is very nervous. They are speaking about him. When Molly returns John tries not to stare at her.
“I don’t need any charity,” answers John and his face flashes but Sherlock covers his hand with his cool hand and John’s heart goes galloping.
Sherlock giggles and kisses John lightly:
And name the place she’s passing by. And something awful happens next. John’s ear catches the screeches of brakes , gritting of metal and  the clatter of the smashing glass. John’s hands begin trembling, he is looking unconsciously  at his phone and he isn’t able to call Harry by her name. The call is ended and John returns to himself.
Baker street is rather far away from John’s dormitory and there is no money for cab (as usual). To tell the truth, he doesn’t have enough to the tube and he runs to the centre of London as if it is the most important marathon in his life. He has a trace line in his head to show him the shortest way to Sherlock’s home and John follows it strictly  without any deviation. He  runs throughout the crowds like a shell. Some people give him  a way, others  say something  to his back but nobody stops him. John really isn’t able to think about different  trivia like the culture in the  street, because he is sure that something bad has happened with Sherlock and he is afraid to be late.  It can’t be just jealousy, says John to himself, as he explained everything right there, in the café. The real reason is that Sherlock has got into a pretty mess. And his wild imagination presents him a lot of horrible pictures:  from a ripper maniac to common heart attack. John is in a hurry, he whispers to himself something like:”Hold on, Sherlock, I’ll come soon!” and people  dash aside him.
“My breathe  doesn’t hurt me,” agrees Sherlock, “A couple of  bruises, nothing more serious.”
This moment a tall  man with grey temples (obviously he’s a policeman) is going to John’s and the rest of idlers place.
Oh, John would like to tell him a lot: that he shouldn’t  neglect his health, he mustn’t   take any crimes detections without thinking, he can’t follow the criminals alone, he’s not allowed to… But John’s acting like a careful mother with her good-for-nothing and naughty child: he is keeping silence and watching Sherlock eating the doughnut and having some coffee, and his checks are flushing red eyes are closing. Sherlock is weak, but he looks better. John thinks that he must have a good rest, sleep well, have a good meal – some broth and, of course, to have a cup of tea, but John doesn’t say a word as he remembers to keep the distance. Sherlock opens his eyes as if he was roughly woken up.
"It’s a dead end. Nonsense,"  she is speaking in a weak voice,  close to whisper, "because this is Sherlock."
John’s hand moves to take the tablet but he hears a cold but well known voice saying:
And in the evening a nice nurse named Clara sent by the social service   and a doctor comes to inform, that the necessary medicine was found in the  special stock of the hospital.  John is deeply surprised by Sherlock’s acquaintance abilities and , being sure that Harry gets on with Clara, he returns home.  He supposes that during his absence he lost his work, his place in the university and  his place in the room. But instead of scandal Mike demonstrates his  sympathy and asks about Harry. With a great fear John asks his questions about the university and Mike answers that  everything is OK, John’s absence was covered by Mike and lections can be easily  caught up as, frankly speaking,  John hasn’t lost a lot.  When John asks why Mike  knew about his problems with Harry, Mike answers that  it was John’s friend from Chemistry Faculty who came to him in the day of the crash and warned him about the situation. John is shocked with  the revealed   circumstances  and fins his charge. His phone is alive and John sees an endless number of missed calls and messages from Molly. John opens the last one and reads that  he was given a short vacation for the time of being with Harry  and he is welcome to return to his work anytime it is possible for him. Surely John guessed about  the reason but he calls Molly and she also says that Sherlock warned them about Harry and her hospitalization. John is angry and pleased at the same time.
He touches him gently, pours the scratches, bends and blows to reduce the pain and his cheek is close Sherlock’s one and puts a plaster on. Sherlock seems not to breath at all and John blushes as he  thinks that Sherlock could guess about the emotional storm in his heart and soul and fears it a lot.
The deep voice powerfully interrupts him: “Hello, John. It seems to me that you’re looking for Sherlock.”
John keeps silence. He wants to thank Sherlock but his tongue  doesn’t obey him.
John makes a little swallow of the very hot coffee and tastes the most amazing croissant  in his life.  John give the packet to Sherlock and  says: “So must you.”
Last time Harry often quarrels with her girl-friend and spends all her free time in bars, being drunk to death. And she  meddles in   John’s student life as he must look after her in different clubs, sits near until she falls asleep and not let her choke in her own vomit. John is a good brother and he can’t  tell her to go elsewhere. He tries to influence her  but Harry  never pays any attention to opinions of other people and she mangles her life and brother’s one. John neglects inorganic chemistry: a lot of missing lections and  failed lab works.  Somehow or other, he copes  with other subjects (due to his good schooling) but the problems with inorganic chemistry  means only the possibility of sending down.  John doesn’t sleep for three nights in a row, falls asleep during Latin and is drowsy at his job. There is a note-book with tasks and nibbled pen in front of him among the napkins, coffeepot and cezves.  John hardly makes him return to the  data of  the example but  his brain is indifferent and disregard – all it needs is  dreaming. John  rubs his eyes and misses Sherlock’s appearance. Being in a fog of exhaustion he makes coffee and  lays some lemon slices on the saucer. Molly takes the order and John feels he is falling asleep.
John watches a figure in black and finds that Molly makes a mistake. It is obvious there is no Sherlock’s interest   there, especially the way they want to convince him. If there is any interest it is close to interest of the researcher. And John again thinks that he is a little guinea pig whose heart is ready to burst  out of his chest  when he sees his personally vivisectionist. Has John thought about love? Oh, are you kidding?  Surely  not. It is just  admiration, adoring an art masterpiece . John tries to calm himself  with these false explanations and images but somewhere  deep in his heart, in the background, he  knows that he is in love… Head over heels.
“He?”  John’s cheeks are flushing.  He hesitates but stretches his hand to the cup of drink he made a moment ago, returned by Molly. His eyes find Sherlock’s eyes  and John winks being shocked with Sherlock’s frowned brows and angry look. John  knocks the hot coffee back and tastes nothing but takes a slice of lemon and eats it with peel. Molly sighs with sympathy and maybe it is the first time in John’s life he sees Victor trying  to be friendly:
The last boyfriend destroyed their family as he beat their mother to death, was close to  rape Harry and only John’s absence save him from the jail as he would  killed the  stinker without any doubts. Certainly, the rat was caught and landed in  prison, but it didn’t help neither  their dead mother nor them. It was a kind woman, their neighbor, who  saved  them from the orphan asylum.  John and Harry lost everything except each other. And It was harry to be John’s constant in all this damned world until Sherlock came. John couldn’t leave her alone, couldn’t let her die.
Oh, I've finished. This is my favourite chapter which made to begin all this work. I hope you will like it as much as me. Enjoy)
“Oh, it were you there, in the park!” exclaims Sherlock and slaps his  head,” You were there, and it wasn’t my imagination.” John is surprised a lot.
And John feels warm in his  heart that he guessed the author of the unknown number SMS. A couple of times he understands that some teachers give him an easy time and he thinks that it is also Sherlock’s influence. But as he has no evidences, he decides  to let everything stay as is.
“Any pain? Are you sick? Dizzying?” asks he to hide his embarrassment with care.
" Frankly speaking, I’ve heard something,"  says Molly, "that he needs the only look to tell everything about a person . And sometimes he helps the police. It doesn’t mean I was very interested to spy him."  Molly’s face is hot and she stops speaking.
“you don’t hear without aid, do you?” clarifies John when Sherlock turns his head to him and  Sherlock nods.
“And there in café? Did you have your aids? You remember that story with a fatty . And with Victor’s pill. You worn them, didn’t you?”
"You gave me..." repeats John patiently but the fatty doesn’t listen to him and continues his show. The queue begins to trouble and some   people are getting close being attracted by the hot atmosphere of scandal.
John  quickly  draws back his hand  from the pill lying at Victor’s palm and makes a step back.
He spends his night solving an endless number of chemistry problems and doesn’t allow  his thought concentrate on anything but inorganic  chemistry. But every moment he doesn’t look at  formulas his thoughts and dreams run to Sherlock. Why did he suggest  his help? He did it by himself, didn’t he? John wasn’t drunk and didn’t have hallucinations. It wasn’t  a mirage. May it be, John disappointed him with his behavour there, in the park. But it any case it wasn’t a great problem  for Sherlock just day ‘hello”.  The matter is Sherlock could, but didn’t and made out like they weren’t acquainted. Might it be possible he was ashamed of John’s company? Or he doesn’t take their acquaintance as something important, does he?
Sherlock is absent for next week and these  days are the worst ones  in John’s life . He goes to work, prepares hard for his seminars and labs, works in the café but he doesn’t live at all. Molly expresses her sympathy  with him but her sympathy is worse than  having a knife in the heart. It seemed so right cause John just wanted to become free from Sherlock but now his world doesn’t have its colours, smells and sounds. John squirms and every night he is waken up with erection  after dreams in which Sherlock takes his hand and looks at him without saying a word. Just takes his hands. And John wakes up and cries in his pillow trying not to disturb Mike, and then masturbates in the shower trying not to say Sherlock’s name. Awful days.
John feels his tongue frozen but he hears the tones in his phone as nobody is waiting for his gratitude.
“Yeah, Mycroft is my elder brother “ Sherlock’s explanation is very necessary. “That time he visited the café to get acquainted with you as he said that there too much your presence in my life.” Sherlock smiles and adds: “He liked you.” And John smiles at the answer.
Sorry for such a long pause - I was just eaten by my work.
But Sherlock leaves without turning back and all his figure demonstrates that he will not offer his help twice and he wants everyone to react his words immediately. If you are so foolish that you can’t make your own tongue to obey, you can stay alone. John is ready to burst into tears but another client helps to return back into the world full of latte and cappuccino. The information about  the drugs addiction in Sherlock’s anamnesis doesn’t disturb John at all.
"I don’t understand your words about the British queen," Molly frowns.
He hasn’t ever  given John such an open smile and John doubts that he has ever given such a  smile to  anybody. John is surprised and doesn’t understand anything but Sherlock hugs him and whispers  somewhere to his  crown:
He tumbles out  back to front from the café
"It’s obvious," says Sherlock calmly , " it’s just enough to look at you a bit closer. But if you are really interested in the way I have known about it…"
“No pain, no dizzying, no sick,” answers Sherlock in a moment hearkened to himself.
“I was angry,” answers Sherlock and he is confused.
"He is from another world, "  concludes John. He notes the expensive clothes  and the proud posture. "He is not for us, isn’t he?"  He turns to Molly to be sure that it was exactly that she tried to say.
"What is between you? " asks she trying to catch John’s eyes.
A stranger visitor come to the café like a prima to the stage of Covent Garden , resting his umbrella-cane he  stops at the door for a moment. Maybe, he’s waiting for applause. An expensive suit, ideal shining shoes (in spite of this wind and weather, notes John), his like look like he has just left the barber-shop – everything shows that he is a prosperous and successful man and he is completely the other-world alien for their little students’ café. The man looks around the cage and his eyes stops at John and a minute  later he is openly examining him with a great interest.. Then he nods to himself as if  he has taken a decision and moves to the bar . John gives him a look of inquiry having great doubts such man can decide to have a cup of coffee here but he says in a powerful studied voice:
John wants to give him a smack but he holds himself in check as he doesn’t want to lose the job. Sherlock make the first swallow and it seems to John that Sherlock  smiles looking at him. This moving of the corner of his lips can be called smile, can’t it? John decides to take it this way and he begins to make a classificatory of Sherlock’s smiles. Doing this he tries to do his best not to feel like a schoolgirl in love.
“I’ll bring the first aid kit,” says Sherlock and disappears in his flat.
“I must examine you,” says John gently as if he asks a permission and Sherlock nods in agreement. John checks the ribs with light touches. “Thanks God, they aren’t damaged,” his smile slightly appears on his lips.
“You will tell me what you got in this time,” says he angrily and begins cleaning his face with a soft sponge without asking any permission.
“OK,” says the voice. “Good bye, John.”
“You can hear, can’t you? You wasn’t looking at me when I was speaking about my feelings…” He doesn’t want to slug it out or to bring Sherlock to light. He   just  wants to clarify everything.
"So, is he a chemist? " asks john thoughtfully and  he hardly suppress the wish to make inquires.
“This is my assistant,” says Sherlock to the arrogant policewoman and pull John by  his sleeve to the corpse. “What do think, John?” and he turns to his lover  to see his answer and John smiles. Sherlock still doesn’t like any  aids that’s why he tries  to have John in view. And John touches Sherlock’s shoulder if he wants to say something.  They cooperate and interact ideally,  take each other’s hint s or looks and seem to be a pair. They don’t kiss  or hug each other in public, don’t shock anybody .
“Harry, please, just stop the car and tell me where you are. I’ll be there in a moment,” he sais firmly and hopes Harry can hear him. Ok, she has heard him  and she laughs
Though he is still knelling in front of John, he looks ideal and  unapproachable, aristocratic and cold (but it is a puzzle how he is able to do it in such position).  And John is completely surprised with this information and he can’t stand amazing. Certainly he understands that this problem  is  loathsome for Sherlock but his admiration is connected with Sherlock overcoming it.
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders and then moves from knees to heals and then he just sits down on the last step. His trousers are wet and dirty but Sherlock  pulls them up/ His is close to John and he stares at him as he sees him for the first time. He stretches his hand and  wipes the blood on his cheek. He frowns as it is impossible for him to see the blows on John’s face.
"Black without sugar, John."
“Harry, Harry,  where are  you?” John is making ristretto, Sherlock forgets about his phone and suspiciously looks at him . John hopes that it is jealousy but Sherlock’s emotions are still closed and incomprehensible  for him.
John can’t believe him:”I cried as an elephant  in rut/ Only a deaf man  couldn’t  hear me.” His voice is full of  distrust and  resentment.
“A pure accident…” Sherlock echoes his words,” A pure accident… Oh my god, John, I’m scared when I think that you wouldn’t come and I would lose my temper.” He looks  completely shocked  and frightened. And John also finds this idea frightening.
"Do you think I believe that you put my money into the  cash desk? Empty your pockets!"
John is shocked  and amazed by Sherlock’s perspicuity cause the usual reaction he could count on after the changing of the habits was a question or request to give some explanations. John nod to Molly and takes Sherlock’s words into consideration. But Molly doesn’t leave him and it would be silly to hope for this.
“Mine. You’ll be mine. Bitch. Move your legs and you will like it. As daddy Victor has a big tool, it will be enough for your asshole…”
And Sherlock just shrugs his shoulders before raising his eyes to John.
Due to Molly’s dreamy look  and air of reverie John realizes that Sherlock has come. John doesn’t look there by himself pretending being very busy with a honey raf  and when Molly says the cherished words “black, two sugars” , he gives the order to Victor. Molly looks at him angrily but John ignores her with might and main. Victor hems and says some scabrousness  about Sherlock and John squirms – even in this condition he can’t hear any bad and rough words about Sherlock. Unfortunately there are no clients at all and John raises his eyes and meets lost Sherlock’s look full of desperation. Coffee made by Victor stands in front of him but he hasn’t even touched the cup yet. Smartphone is gripped in his hand and the under lip is bitten with even white teeth. Sherlock is staring at John, scanning him, prying in his thoughts, trying to understand him and John is angry with him and his offence raises in his heart like a dirty soap foam.
South Indian Raga - A raga is a system of musical performance and composition that is used to build a melody intended to create a particular emotional mood. Each raga is organized around a group of notes or scale. There are 72 central ragas part of the South Indian or Carnatic musical tradition.  Further discussion can be found here:
Not long after, John came down the stairs, his steps slow and deliberate. As he reached the bottom of the stair, she saw him hesitate. The unlit rooms of the house telling him the tale of where Sherlock lay.
legato bowing
John drifted towards consciousness, a sensation tugging at him. Something was odd. He was warm, yet uncomfortable. The blanket rested on him - oh, he'd fallen asleep on the couch. His cheek rested on something smooth. A soothing heat met his flesh.
‘’ ’S’nothing’’ the detective mumbled, embarrassed.
Mrs. Hudson’s little cough brought him back to reality. He lazily turned his head to look at her, his drugged body wanting him to go to sleep.
, had told him he wanted nothing to do with him anymore. So many times, Sherlock had felt like telling him why he was « like that ». When Mary had left, they had gotten so close, it felt as if they were back to the days before Sherlock had faked his death. He remembered one evening in particular…
‘’Wait! You’re not going to help me?’’ Sherlock said in a small voice, as John was slowly turning his back on him.
John glared at him, clearly not buying his lie. The younger man sighed and explained what happened, changing only the faintest of details (when and why). The doctor put his hand on Sherlock’s neck, trying to figure out how bad it was. He pressed slightly near the detective’s nape, which made him hiss in pain.
Sherlock’s face fell. It was only for an instant, because a cold mask replaced the pain John had seen for a second, from the corner of his eye. He reached into his pocket and found said card, which he handed to the detective. Their fingers brushed ever so slightly while they exchanged the small piece of paper. Their eyes met, neither letting go of the card.
— Who’s asking?
He looked across from him, John’s empty chair mocking him. He felt like a coward, in that moment, but he knew that he couldn’t handle another heartbreak. The wedding had been bad enough, but apparently his life just had to be a series of heartbreaking moments. Just when his and John’s relationship had gotten stronger, Mary had died. John had put the blame on Sherlock, and he had never felt more rejected in his life. The man he
‘’Sherlock!’’
. John felt a pang in his chest at the thought of the man getting shot by his wife. A sour taste in his mouth, he remembered everything the detective had done for him in the few months where Mary had left. He had taken so much time to help out, to locate her, to take care of Rosie. He didn’t deserve someone like him in his life. That’s why he wrote him the note. It broke his heart to pick up the pen and write those 9 words. He felt even more like a dick to ask Molly to give it to him but he was a coward, so that was what he did.
‘’John!’’
— Well you are misinformed, I don’t work with Sherlock Holmes anymore… I don’t know how you got this address, but I can’t help you-
‘’Well… Er- Hello. Do you need anything? I was just about to go out and do the groceries-‘’
‘’So… Is that the only reason why you came here?’’ said the younger man, looking down at the business card.
The detective couldn’t look away from John, who had come here on his own. Who seemed to want to talk again. He was wondering if this was all a dream like the others he had had in the last few months, but the card and the slight touch of John’s fingers against his felt so real… He decided that even his mind couldn’t make this up.
What on earth had he just agreed to?
Just as he was about to look away from the windows, from the corner of his eye, he spotted a familiar figure in between the strangers. His head moved to the side so fast that he hurt his neck. He felt his heart pound in his chest, and his knees were weak. He quickly turned around and started to tidy up the place. He threw the cushions back on the couch, and tried to get rid of any syringes he could find, dumping them in a trashcan near the fireplace. He turned around helplessly in the middle of the room, not knowing where to go next and caught the reflection of himself in the mirror. He almost didn’t recognize himself. His hair was patted down on his forehead, his skin looked like wax and his cheekbones were pointier than ever. His eyes were still red, and he overall looked like he had spent the last months in a ditch. Sherlock ran to the bathroom, his legs wobbly. He splashed water onto his cheeks in an attempt to bring color back to them, to no result. He threw his robe in his room as he tried to quickly change into something decent.
‘’Wryneck, that’s what I thought. Just be careful and try not to move it too much and you should be fine by the end of the week.’’
‘’I understand. You don’t want to see me, its uh. It’s normal, after what I did.’’
‘’What happened?’’ he asked softly, pushing Sherlock’s hand away.
John opened his mouth but nothing came out. He had never felt guilt quite like this before. His heart was aching and his stupid brain couldn’t come up with anything at all to make Sherlock understand it wasn’t his fault.
‘’No!’’
‘’This wasn’t- Mary… She didn’t… You couldn’t-. Ok. Listen to me, you fool. This wasn’t… It wasn’t your fault. What could you have possibly done? Just how exactly she threw herself in front of you, I don’t know. But I do know this: she decided it’s what she had to do. So… If I made you feel like… No, I’m sorry I made you feel like it was on you. It wasn’t. Was that clear?’’
The two men were quite flustered to meet again that way. John could feel the flush of his neck as he quickly glanced away so Sherlock could dress himself. The detective was silently cursing himself and his cheeks had never burnt that much. He zipped his trousers up as he got off of the floor.
Sherlock looked up from his feet. His brows furrowed, both anguish and incomprehension showing on his features.
‘’No problem. Alright well I should probably go now, I don’t want to bother Mrs. Hudson too long with Rosie… Good luck with that case, not that you need it.’’
"Oh, Sherlock… Why don’t you open that note, dear? You’ve been sulking about it for months now… At least you’ll stop wondering, and you can move on…"
Sherlock faded back to consciousness still feeling John's warm weight in his arms. He'd been dreaming of their kiss. Again. The velvet contact of mouths suddenly famished for the touch of the other. The gleam of sunlight on John's kiss-wet lips as they parted for breath. The devouring look in those ocean dark eyes. Then the hushed sound of rain on the roof as the vision broke apart with the return to waking.
Rosie blinked at him, considering. He went on in a gentler tone of voice."One of the strongest people I know is your Dada. One of his strengths is that he is willing to see where he is in error, and listen to others who are correct. It makes him very strong."
"What would that be?"
"I told you Rosie can stay with me as long as you need. It would be nice if you could text me when you get a sense of that."
Sherlock carried a very tired child on his back. He was refreshed from his nap earlier, though he'd sooner hug Mycroft than ever volunteer that fact. But he could never pretend to regret the inviting smile, stirring kiss, and quiet "hello, beautiful" that had greeted his awakening.
John was parched. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. The heat surrounded him. He squinted his eyes against the glare.
He was lying half on top of Sherlock.
As he'd gone about his business during the week, John's location had been on his mind. Like the hum of distant electrical lines, invisible yet palpable.
John realized he'd not said what he meant yet. Instead, he blurted, "Its our anniversary."
Well, they’d likely sort it out. "I'll just be downstairs if you need anything..."
Sherlock came back into sight holding his violin. He stood near the fire and placed the instrument on his chair. He tightened the bow. "I've wanted to share this with you for a long time. It's a piece I learned while I was traveling."
John hurriedly finished stuffing the car full of crates and bags bearing oddments he and Sherlock had been too exhausted to pack up the weekend before. They'd moved his boxed things already, and all the largest pieces that John was keeping: book shelves, changing table, a lovely maple rocker that Harry and Clara had bought them. Rosie had just grown out of both the bed extender and bassinet she'd been sleeping in. So a crib had been ordered and should be waiting at 221B to be put together fresh. Rosie might spend a night or two in the portable baby carrier turned car seat, or the foldable play pen which was her favorite place for a nap.
Mrs. Hudson saw the calculation in John’s eye. Could he reach out?
"Yes," John thought he understood. "Oh, of course, we haven't talked about the noise. You'll have thought of getting ear plugs, I'm sure? For those few precious moments you do sleep of a night, the last thing we need is for Rosie to wake you up." Sherlock had a non-plussed look on his face. "You, know I actually have some. Mar--we sometimes would use them when the other was up with her." He made to stand again, "I'll be right back."
"Ah, yes. Well, we did want to get an informed opinion about whether it was worthwhile to pursue."
The man accepts the shining cake of rosin. "It's a bit unusual, actually."
John breathed. His body pulled in the air, a deep draft of life. He felt the solidity of the warm body beside him. He allowed himself, very lightly, to feel a place in himself he'd left behind a very long time ago.
"Sounds like I may need to give him the head's up if we do."
“Excellent, Watson. That place of unknowing may be uncomfortable, but it is actually an important place to come to. You have a solid understanding of the limits of your knowledge. Rather than making an uninformed guess based on incomplete information, you can make a judicious decision about what you ascertain to be true, and how much trust to place in that conclusion.
"Says you, who's supposedly quitting smoking. Don't think I haven't smelled it on you."
Sherlock gave a curt nod and moved on to his task, most assuredly not holding back tears. He was fine again by the time he came back to the pair and offered the bottle with a friendly dispassionate air. John eyed him thoughtfully.
“Exactly, Watson. Follow that instinct. Use your lines of investigation.”
“Mrs. Hudson…” Sherlock’s voice broke, clearly surprising himself.
John makes a mental note to look up the clinical studies, and mind never to feed any to Rosie. "But anise is less harmful?"
Sherlock moved closer to his flatmate. His shoulders tensed. He'd been expecting something else. He nodded. "A ruse. I apologize." He made to lift the bag out of John' hands, but it was moved out of his reach.
Sherlock glanced over to them. Joy trembled in his eyes, in check. "I'm not overly presuming, am I?"
John released Sherlock's hand. He crept his up Sherlock's forearm. "Show me."
At present, Rosie was making the low, oddly mechanical sound Sherlock referred to as 'winding up' which signaled she was getting ready for a proper cry. She was belted safely into the car seat of the small economy model he'd reserved. Mycroft had offered to send a car round but John put his foot down and ordered his own. His independence from the smug bureaucrat's influence might be an illusion--made even more transparent by this move back to Baker Street--but it was one to which he would cling.
"I'm not sure, Papa." She stood up, scattering the blocks, and walked over to John. Climbing up into his lap as she spoke. "I'm trying to figure out if you can read music, Dada. By process of elimination."
"What are these?"
It is expected for the Best Man to dance with at least one of the Bride's Maids, I am given to understand. I have done so. - SH
"Oh, goodness, no. He insisted on getting an instrument for Christmas. And since then he's been knocking about with it on his own. Got some books out. I think he may have watched a video or something."
"Sherlock, spit it out."
Ignore last. Aim me toward goal. - SH
"Yes." John offered her the block he'd been holding. "I'm so glad they were useful." She accepted the object, and placed all three on her lap. As she reached her hand up to cradle her chin, her tongue peeked out between her lips.
"I am."  He felt her lift her head up slightly. John brushed against his side. Speedy's was in sight now.
Ten minutes later finds Will taut with impatience and temper. The students each hold an imaginary violin beneath their chin, real bow stroking empty air. Will quivers with the need to ask a question, to complain about this useless activity. He wants to be working on smoothing out the long strokes of his
She scooched back, cross-legged on the blanket, until she could see both her fathers properly. John picked up the block he'd been touching and eyed it critically. Rosie considered, pieces falling into place. "You made them, Dada."
"Well, I did once." John was looking down at his child.
"Or ahead, once or twice," John broke in.
Sherlock stilled and tensed as he often did when John touched him. But John was quite unable to let go. He inhaled the scents of wood smoke and cedar-saffron hair product that clung to his flatmate. His chin resting on a tall shoulder, John heard the reassuring sound of his friend's breath. He held on. In the absence of rejection, John took this moment. Pent up need for contact overriding the careful distance he maintained to respect his friend and protect their connection. Water lapped over the dam. Today, it was just too much.
"Papa, I'd like to start by memorizing all the pauses. Dada can help me find clever ways to draw them so they are easier to remember."
"Yes. I must apologize for all that. I was a bit. Jealous."
Sherlock surfaced from memory to smile wryly into John's eyes. "You have no idea."
Mr Shadid nods and smiles slightly. "Yes, I can understand. It's a lovely instrument. I didn't start playing until when I was older than you." He pauses, searching Will's face to see if he is engaged, then continues. "Music was part of my life. I played in my village in Iraq. Played the drum, the jawzah and the oud. Violins were less common. Very expensive. It wasn't until I was almost your brother's age that I was able to get one, with the help of my family." His eyes become distant, then return Will's gaze again. "When we had to leave I brought it with me. We lost so much, but the songs helped me carry some of home."
Two slender figures stood near one of the large windows overlooking Baker Street. One tall and dark, the other diminutive and golden haired. Each held an appropriately scaled-violin and stood half facing the other, half facing well-burdened music stands. Rosie Watson’s sheaf of papers was topped by a chart showing the
“No, flower. Your fathers will be here in a moment. You’re not on your own.”
But then they brought up the loads from the car to his and Rosie's room.  John laid eyes on the gleaming, newly assembled crib. Sherlock's vulnerable apologies about taking liberties with setting up and assurances that all could be re-arranged made the source of the effort all too clear. It pushed the new father far over the line into sentiment.
The little family, now reduced, huddled around the hob in the kitchen. More tea was in order.
Sherlock was learning that 221B looked very different from within the circle of John Hamish Watson's arms. Partly because it entailed a close up look at the doctor himself. John lay quiet beneath Sherlock. The breath moving slowly in and out of his body. The heat of his skin warming the detective inside and out.
Sherlock closed his eyes as brutal weight sloughed off his back. His arm hung still, but on reopening, the light in his eyes caressed. A small smile warmed his mouth. He shook his head gently, gesturing towards the living room.
John put his hand on Sherlock’s forearm and squeezed lightly. “I’ll make the calls,” he said.
The detective's look of impatience deepened. "Then you'll understand how urgent it is that we get moving. John?"
Rosie beamed.  A romantic already. "That’s sweet, Papa."
"Oh, what is it that I'm thinking? Please,
"Where ever you want." John nudged him with his knee, in a companionable way. "Actual compatibility. Partnership. Desire." He smirked at John saying, "Not the imitation." He shifted to his knees again. "All right. I've said my part. Why don't we move somewhere more comfortable for your disclosure now?"
John is at a loss, he creates the weirdest  suggestions, he is jealous to the dude with  the umbrella though he didn’t see him more and misses their looks and glances in the café, which became some kind of a ritual at the entrance and after John makes coffee.
"What do I see? Little Jonny is upset," Victor is drawling the words and it makes John sick, " but come here and daddy Victor will console you!" he tries to draw John up and hug him  but John  tears himself from his embrace and pushes  him away.
“Are you driving?” John starts and hardly keeps the ristretto in his hands. He quickly gives the change to the client and looks for Ted. John’s eyes asks Ted to  help and replace him. John feels Sherlock’s  glance with all the surface of his skin.
John doesn’t take care if Victor doesn’t pick on Molly. By the way, Molly goes earlier today as she has a date. She tells about it and her face flashes for a moment. John looks miserable but wishes her to have a good time and looks around the near-empty café. They are going to close in an hour. Victor hides to the utility room. John is trying  not to think ,what Victor is doing there and turns over the pages reading the theme on osteology. When the door opens and let the cold wind into the café, John is busy learning  structure and texture of the temporal bone. He looks up at the late customer and misses his breath. There is Sherlock at the door, standing without any movement. He is staring with his hard look at John having his hand in the pockets. He looks bad. John notices that he has lost his weight and can be called skinny. He has dark blue shadows under his eyes, dry lips and  bitter  wrinkles near his lips. They look at each other for an eternity and then Sherlock makes the first and  irresolute step/ And John feels  a triumph spreading deep in his chest, and he can’t stop looking at Sherlock, trying to remember all his features and  doesn’t notice that Sherlock is staggering. Sherlock reaches John’s bar moving  staggering gait and sits on the stool. His hand are still in his pockets, he is shivering and his eyes are dark as agates. They can’t be black, cause John has seen them in day light, but now they look like two fathomless wells and they are magnetic. And John is dizzy and understands that he  lost himself in these wells long time ago. Sherlock is still looking at him and John is making the only thing he can do really well – he is making some coffee to him. Black,  two sugars. When coffee is ready, John moves the cup to Sherlock , Sherlock sighs convulsively  and looks at it. Then he Takes his hands out of the pockets and John notices that they are  shivering.
“Am I Neo?”  John smiles. “ Red or blue?”
Next morning Harry comes to consciousness. Doctors are sure that it is a miracle. John is just happy. His sister cries and heaps unprintable words in turn. But the problems don’t want to disappear.  They need some expensive medicines and an orderly approved nurse. And Harry needs a rehabilitation clinic . John gives way to despair and understands he has no way except Sherlock’s cars. Being  embarrassed and having his cheeks red he takes the card but there is only a phone number there. Without any name. John  feels foolish and can’t imagine how to begin his talk. But after the second dial tone he hears the male voice. It is the voice he heard in the café. It was the strange man with umbrella. John can’t say a word. He wants to hang the phone up but the strange man with the umbrella  doesn’t give him any chance:
And it seems to John that  everyone in the queue looks at him with blame and agrees that he is a real thief. And the worst point is that Sherlock is present and he  hears all the insults John is given.
“Your brother?” John jerks up his head “I thought he…” And John decides  not to reveal his suggestions.
Sherlock looks up at him and he looks hurt, then he licks his lips and says; “You were kissing a girl.”
“Maybe  I’m the wrong man to all  these feelings and emotions. I have no ideas how to show my interest to anyone.  Emotions, relationships… I ‘m always getting lost in these  spheres. And beside this I had a very unpleasant experience.” Sherlock speaks fast as he  doesn’t want to forget to say something important.
But the fat man presses  splashing his poor coffee around.
Molly’s cheeks  are glowing  but she just nods with agreement. The talk between  Victor and Sherlock(it is so easy  for John to change the neutral “guy”  into his proper name) is turning into drama. Victor   lost his dominating position looming  over him and  took a step back. His face is  ravaging with red spots, he is chewing  his lips and his hands are trembling. Sherlock is telling something to him just scanning his strained figure. At last Victor drops something in the answer, turns around and runs away. He even doesn’t give any glance at shocked and surprised Molly and John, hides in a storeroom and John has another client. Before taking an order, John gives Sherlock  one more quick glace and shudders after catching his  look. It is a strange look. Sherlock is staring at him in a strange way, as if he scanning or studying him. And it can’t be understood easily. John must feel uncomfortable under this piercing  eyes but he just smiles in reply – he doesn’t like Victor at all. When John gives  the latte to the client and looks up to see Sherlock he can see only the cup with unfinished coffee standing on the edge of  the free table.
An evil and unpleasant incident  happens on Wednesday. John head is going round due to an endless number of clients. The lines of cappuccino, latte and espresso are made in some kind of trance, without any thoughts or words. He is working on automatic pilot.
"Oh, you’re mistaken," answers John in a low voice as he tries not to get attention of other  customers,  "you gave me.."
"He is a chemist, I have seen him some times at the uni," Molly’s voice is pacing and trembling. It’s very suspicious." He doesn’t have any relationships. He is too..." She takes a pause as if she can’t find the necessary words.
“No, Sherlock, it’s not your fault, “ he tries to reassure Sherlock. “it was just a pure accident, you know.”
John is embarrassed and  breathes out loud. Sherlock puts all his medicines back and John understands that it is high time to leave . But he doesn’t want to leave Sherlock and this cozy, in spite of the mess, living room. The second armchair is so attractive but who John Watson is to  be a burden. He doesn’t have any reason to stay at the flat in baker Street. And even his ribs are calm and demonstrate that they aren’t broken at all.  Sherlock stops making himself  busy with the kit  and glances at John and John can’t understand his emotions.  John makes himself to stand up and says with the most false smile he can  put on his face:
For a moment  Sherlock sets John free
John doesn’t want to stop but on the other  hand he doesn’t want to disappoint Sherlock. That’s why he gives Victor his last hit straight into the blood paste where was his cheeck face and takes a step back. His fists covered with blood and don’t want to obey John as he has got a cramp. He can’t relax or stretch them and Sherlock has to hit his fingers for some times to make them alive.
John smiles  because it is really good information for him. He is always afraid of  putting his foot in it again or to tell about his feelings. It can’t be said that John didn’t speak about them but he announced that to the world but it can’t be taken  seriously as Sherlock didn’t hear him . This situation is similar to a false start and John isn’t against to  start again.
“What?” John amazingly looks at Sherlock  who  has come to the bar counter and Victor aggressively moves at him. Sherlock doesn’t pay any attention to Victor’s  bulling  and threats but he stares at John for an endless long time before he talks again.
Frankly speaking, nothing has changed: Sherlock types something in his phone and John makes coffee but sometimes their eyes find each other and there is no aggression in their mute dialogue  but only friendship and supporting. As if one of them asks: “Are you here?” And the other answers:”Yes, I am. I am here.”
J'ai une histoire à te raconter.
“I say, that it’s fantastic” answers John.” Nobody can guess that you’re deaf. You are a detective, you help the  police and you are deaf. How can you do it?”
She is waiting for coffee and John is making it with awe. Before giving it to Molly he add some cinnamon as it is one of the John’s favourite combination which was found when he experimented with different additions. Molly takes the cup silently and puts it on the tabke near the window. Sherlock stops  for a moment before  having a swallow and John can’t stand looking at him. When their looks meet John’s cheeks are flushing. Oh, his cheeks betray him. This is his reactive possibility to colour different parts of his body in the colours of his mental turmoil. This is exactly that  awful possibility to be blamed for his redden face under Sherlock’s examining look. John doesn’t look away in order not to show his weakness but at this moment he understands the guinea pigs. He is a little and helpless guinea pig under Sherlock’s eyes, as he is examining him carefully. Certainly, this foolish flirting will not have any good end.
a slaughter. John escapes from the crowd leaving some lying anomies behind. He doesn’t want to  crush them off as he can’t waste any time- Sherlock needs him. But now John scares the passes-by not only with his purposefulness but with his appearance too. In passing he feels that his lips have salty taste (they get bleed), something heavy under his eyes (hematoma), a pain on his cheekbones  (a lot of  scratches and may be  a cut), and a boring pain in his chest (as it not the same hurt which he felt during the first quarrel with Sherlock, maybe he has two lungs broken). Surely, John is very vivid and may be Sherlock will not appreciate his exterior view but it doesn’t matter. He wants to be sure that everything is all right.   The rest of the way is  free from accidents. John finds the door under the number 221D and stairs up the porch and rings the bell. He doesn’t hear anything and that’s why he begins to knock with his fist and then he begins to kick it.  But the door stands still and John, to his regret,  understands that there is nobody in. The windows  on the second floor are dark  and closed and it is a bad sigh. John wants to run somewhere else, to do something more,  but he  doesn’t know where he must run and what he should do. Baker street is the only place connected with Holms besides the café. But he is not in the café or Molly would ring  John. And John will wait for Sherlock here. One day he will return home and they will have a talk. John  slips down on the porch and  leans against the door. It is cold and it is unpleasant drizzling rain but John doesn’t care. He is concentrated on  his thoughts about Sherlock. John closes his eyes and tries to pray waiting for Sherlock but he soon falls asleep.
Sherlock kissed him, breaking off his attentions. He raised a hand to caress John's face. "I'm afraid she's got plans for tomorrow with her sister. She was happy for us to steal Watson away when were finished. But we do need to go tonight."
"Will Holmes?" says the instructor to an answering nod. He smiles at the young serious face. "You've come just in time. We'll do a few exercises first, so just leave your instrument for now and come find a place to stand." On a marker board behind him the name 'Mr Shadid' is written in bold red letters.
Lestrade picked up the mug and eyed Sherlock mildly. "It's not what you think."
"Licorice is dangerous, now?
Scraping a raw nerve was so much more likely then. When John's very self was shattered and worn from wounds of battle. And his spirit was still seeking firm ground on which to stand.
"Hubert."
"Of course."
Sherlock hummed appreciatively. "Mrs Hudson outdid herself." He made no move to relieve John of the biscuit. Took another bite. A fine pink tongue peeked out to lick sugar from his lips.
Sherlock stalked over to the doorway. He pulled it open eagerly. "You've got those case files, then?"
Will's father brings his instrument over. Will grabs at the cloth and wipes down the gleaming chestnut body of the violin, cleaning the strings of excess rosin and attending to his bow.
"'My friend, of course we'll bring you with us to Timișoara. I've spoken with Miri, she has an instrument she would be willing to loan.'"
John said, "You always call her Watson."
Dusk found the trio packing up amid lengthening shadows at the park. The afternoon had been full, involving a great deal of time at the playground for Rosie. Several new friends' contact information had been retrieved.
Mrs. Hudson walked out letting John, followed by a thoughtful but happy looking Sherlock, rush past her into the small room.
John looked out of the corner of his eye, fascinated and unable to look away from Sherlock's mouth. His tunnel vision making him miss entirely how Sherlock's eyes were blatantly fastened upon his lips in return.
The sounds of battle answered him. Gunfire bursts. Cries. He peered through a break in his cover, trying to locate the pinned down members of his unit. His ears strained to hear the thrum of helicopter rotors in the distance, but there was nothing. His heart sped up. He readied himself to break from his location to find cover closer to the conflict.
Likewise, I'm sure. - SH
Clara had some music at the fair.”
Sherlock remembered Mrs Hudson's words again and took comfort in them. She believed it must be true. That his feelings would be returned. Sherlock had thought so many times of how to tell John. How to broach the topic that was submerged in their friendship. Buried in the blood and broken remains of lives both of them had shed in the making of a new, simpler, yet far richer life. They were joined through the child they both adored. And so close to acknowledging the full dimensions of the care and affection they held for one another.
The shadows had long since claimed the streets when John and Sherlock returned. Rosie drowsed after a long day of shopping, cooking and making visits. The girl had been thrilled to get some 'woof' time as she called it. Martha's sister in-law Mrs Turner had a pair of German Shepherds who were both wrapped around the young girl's finger. After lunching there, they'd delivered a set of newly knitted sweaters from Mrs Turner to the women's shelter one tube stop down. Martha got to amiably not correct anyone when they exclaimed over her beautiful 'grandchild.'
"Ah. Ahem." John leaned in for a kiss, his eyes softening with affection. Still finding their way with one another, their noses touched. A wordless negotiation ended with tilted heads and John's warm mouth partaking of Sherlock's. The detective savored the softness, then nibbled at the corner of John's lips. His tongue sought entrance and was happily welcomed, with a sigh of pleasure. Sherlock felt John's arms encircle his neck and he surrendered to the moment. All thoughts and worries swept away by a wash of affection and desire.
Sherlock considered how to respond, then decided on honesty. "I was more going for a nostalgic recall, actually."
Sherlock worked to find many traditions of the instrument to broaden her young ear. Recordings supplemented his offerings and led the direction for his renewed explorations.
Rosie was deep in thought. "Aunt Harry didn't play before college and she didn't pick it up.
I know you want to, you berk. No more speeches. No more cases. But I can't let you go without dancing with me.
"During Advent, musicians played at church. There were violins, violas, cellos." Will closes his eyes and can hear the lead violin soaring over the others, filling the rafters with glorious sound. His smile disappears and he shrugs. "I'd learned to play the piano a little. So maybe I could learn the violin, too." Guarded, he looks the teacher in the eyes.
Dark brown eyes in a time-weathered face open wide in surprise and the instructor shakes his head. "No, no. I don't mean that he's hopeless. Quite the opposite. He's motivated, shows excellent instincts and has insights far beyond his years. But I think that learning in a large group context like this is more likely to hold him back. Especially given his..awkwardness around other children. How long has he been playing?"
Will nods, still looking unsure.
She had to ask them about using the second bed. Couldn't be helped. Shame John seemed so insistent on it. Well, perhaps it was early days yet.
John thought, reveling in the simple attention. His nose caught a delicious scent. He looked down at the plate by the chair.
As Lasho released him he spoke. Ecaterina translated, "He said, 'you're a long way from home, aren't you?'"
. Because you are clever."
Mrs. Hudson contented herself with slipping out of Rosie’s direct line of sight and then headed back down the stairs, following John.
Sherlock, I know you didn't want to be my best man. I don't understand at all why you didn't get that of course I would want that.
No, we didn't. You left before the slow songs were done. You bloody dance with Janine and you won't come back to me.
"And you, Sherlock."
How to express all that? He had pondered what to say. Nothing served.
Some more time passed.
“Dada!!” High and low voices shouted.
“Yes, I recall.” John smiled at the memory of ardent toasts at their recent celebration, and the ensuing taste of tart wine on lips and tongues. He studied Sherlock’s face, searching for a sign. “Has something changed?” Tension bloomed in John’s stomach.
"Pizelles. I've noted that you enjoy the taste of
"Oh, don't bother, she's close to done with them. This was fine for all my sister in-law's children, and it's been just fine for young Rosie. No need to change at this late date."
John watched his daughter engage, her face full of inquisitive attention. There was something... John realized that Sherlock was holding back revealing his face for longer and longer intervals. Catching her attention if she got distracted. Through subtle cues he encouraged her to linger, waiting in expectation for the reappearance of that beloved face.
Martha put a pot of water on to warm up a bottle for Rosie and absentmindedly tied a bib around the young girl's neck. "You're not serious! What was it, a run-away from the zoo? A kidnapped police horse?"
