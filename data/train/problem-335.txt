He wonders at the sharks and other marine life, whether some staff has been permitted to remain to watch over them. He will need to be cautious.
"Why is it
After returning home late at night on his birthday, Sherlock discovers an unexpected gift.
"Well, I wouldn't know, would I?" John asked, frowning down at the table. He picked at a bit of lint on his jumper, fidgeted where he sat. "I don't—I don't bake, I hardly even eat sweets. I didn't even do this—" he gestured wildly around, "—for my own wedding."
In any case, clearly John had made the right decision in giving Sherlock space to pursue . . . whatever it was that he was pursuing. No sense in John hanging around needlessly.
"But I do feel," Sherlock said. "Deeply. For you."
"Twenty-four," a dry voice piped up from the seat in front of him. "There's a headwind. And I do hope you're not going to spend the entire time whinging."
He'd been so small, his father's embrace had surrounded him, made him feel safe and secure even as he lashed out in misery and anger and resentment—
Sherlock nodded down at Pete, cuffed and writhing on the floor.
Janine glanced at him, shot him a sheepish grin. "Sherl hates the way I pack."
Amusement flickered on John's face. "I'm right, yeah? Not something I hear every day."
He wants to walk back to the idling car, slide into the back seat and direct the driver to leave. He does not want to be here as the engines fire up, as the plane gathers speed down the runway, as it disappears into the sky. He does not want to watch as it shrinks, becoming just a glint of silver off the horizon.
Sherlock shut his mouth, looked back at John. It was not what he'd been expecting John to say.
"There's nothing wrong with my computer."
Sherlock breathed, slow, steady, even breaths. He was a deep sleeper, when the urge took him. There was something almost devastating about the sight of him, his body loose and unguarded, his face mashed up against his pillow, his curls in disarray.
"Well," Harry said.
He shifted where he sat, painfully conscious of the gun tucked into his waistband.
Sherlock hissed as John's chilled hand met sleep-warm skin. John dragged his hand up, his palm splaying open to cradle the rise of Sherlock's ribs.
For God's sake, he'd been dangerously bored playing at domestic life in the suburbs once already, and that was
He had not seen Evan Bell in years. Hadn't even thought of him. Not since—
Except—
"To survi—" he stopped, shook his head. "You know what? I don't want to know. What do you mean by well-connected? If Sherlock were—if he were in trouble. Would you be able to help?"
The barista had looked right through him, and he'd felt old, and foolish, and then he'd thought of Eurus. He'd thought of her smiling face and her bright eyes and the way she'd leaned towards him on that bus, the way she'd hung on his every word.
Mycroft stared at the frozen on-screen map.
The way Mycroft pronounced the word “you” immediately caught Sherlock’s attention. Deductions flashed quickly through his mind: Mycroft’s discomfort in sharing this news when he was usually so fond of meddling in Sherlock’s life. The frequency and sincerity in which his lesser emotions, normally suppressed with a dictatorial hand, had risen to the surface over the course of his visit.
“Noted. I’m sorry, John, I won’t—”
explosion! Yes, thank you, that makes me feel
“But, John—”
There was something wrong with the gun. The streetlights flashing through the window made getting a clear look difficult, but- The way the man held it was wrong. There wasn’t enough tension in his wrist to support its weight, grip too loose, no accounting for recoil. John strained his eyes, forcing himself to focus each time light flashed through the cab. Shadows didn’t fall the right way over the surface; lines were missing where there should have been space, and several of what should have been moving parts looked fused to the gun.
of all incompetents into his flat, but Lestrade wasn’t looking at him.
Sherlock put all of the plaster boxes back in the kit where he’d found them and reached for a pad of sterile gauze instead. He’d apply pressure to the cut and determine the reasoning behind John’s behavior while he waited for the bleeding to stop.
“You’re lucky you didn’t have to go to A&E!”
Harry was twenty minutes late to their coffee date, which gave John just enough time to complete three Sudoku puzzles on his phone: two medium, one hard. It said something about their relationship that he was more annoyed at having his puzzle-solving streak interrupted when Harry finally arrived five minutes later, than he was at her being late in the first place.
He caught Sherlock’s eye and winked.
Sherlock straightened and stopped watching the other patrons to focus on John.
“You found the honey then. Do you like it?”
He was pleased by the flash of satisfaction in John’s eyes—nearly as good as if he’d called him
John gaped, his lips silently forming Sherlock’s words as if sounding out a foreign language instead of plain English.
Sherlock was going to have to keep an eye on him in future. It couldn’t be healthy for John to be enslaved by another of his preposterous neuroses. He might need Sherlock’s help to snap him out of it.
“I’ve been excited to try these out, but I wish it could have been under better circumstances.”
“Oh my
Mycroft stared at him a moment. Sherlock dropped back onto the sofa as petulantly as he could with only a few centimeters’ distance to work with.
“Yes, bees, ok. How am I wrong about bees?”
“You’re sure that all of the ways into the office were monitored?”
Sherlock shuffled to the side without glancing away from his mobile, but the voice followed him.
Sherlock’s brain, ceaseless machine though it was, stuttered, and his thoughts slowed to the pace of treacle. Heat suffused his entire body and the dull throb in his neck and upper back which he’d been attempting to ignore seemed to vanish entirely.
Out came a bit of plain white packing paper, beneath which laid a lumpy object in a rather vibrant shade of yellow. Sherlock lifted it out, aghast. It appeared to be covered in little cartoon bees weaving stitch-mark trails behind them. It was also heavier than expected, shifting as he held it, and smelled faintly of lavender.
Sherlock treats Molly absolutely abysmally and she doesn't deserve it, so I made her the Love Guru as cosmic comeuppance.
“Sherlock-”
“Please, God, let me live.”
But everything went wrong the moment he stepped into Morstan’s office.
In answer to John’s startled look, Sherlock only smirked and raised an eyebrow.
“If the weather had been colder your bloody dramatic coat would have saved your suit and your arms. You’re going to have to wear something less fitted until you heal to avoid irritating your skin.”
John clenched his jaw and glared at the little pills in their transparent bottles. Four people dead because some bloody unhinged bastard paid to have them killed.
His optimism lasted up until he arrived at the restaurant, was personally greeted by the owner who’d been prompted to recognize him on sight, and seated at a table by the window with a candle “to make it more romantic.”
“Now, hang on,” John protested, “everything I’ve given you is something you can use easily enough on your own. That has nothing to do with me.”
Sherlock stared at the ghastly fabric in renewed interest and poked the heat pack again with his finger to test the density of the barley.
“So what does it mean?”
Conscious that he was the hanger-on for what was Sherlock’s actual job, John fell into step behind the detective and didn’t see the person—presumably Sherlock’s client—until the door had shut behind them and it was too late.
Having someone respond favorably to his deductions for once was pleasant, but Sherlock couldn’t rely on flukes if he hoped to impress Mummy. Their initial meeting had indirectly introduced The Work, convenient as any interpersonal relationship Sherlock initiated would need to recognize it. Once he had a better understanding of Doctor John Watson he’d be able to determine how to behave, how much of himself could be worked into the facade. This would be the same as any of the other personas and disguises he’d adopted for The Work.
“Blood pressure control,” John agreed. “And sometimes for migraines. I’d need more information to go on.”
Finally, when John had begun to shift on his feet in a manner that meant he felt Sherlock had forgotten him and needed to be told again, Sherlock raised his head.
“Shot in the dark. Good one, though. You’ve only been back in London for a few months, not long enough to need your yearly physical. You don’t show signs of having been sick, and your shoulder hasn’t been paining you. The therapy appointments are inconvenient enough. Doubtful you’d visit anywhere that reminds you of your injury without cause. If the visit wasn’t personal in nature then it was for professional reasons.”
“For later.”
John returned with Sherlock’s mobile in hand, but as he had done earlier the instant Sherlock reached out to claim it John pulled it out of reach.
“Here,” she pushed a coffee into his hands before slumping into her chair with a clatter of china.
“Oh, god, you’re traumatized now, aren’t you? I should’ve been more careful. I have friends I could’ve set you up with, I was just too eager to prove how bloody right I was.”
was Sherlock’s serial suicide murderer. Not the passenger, but the cabbie. He ran through the case in his head, narrated in Sherlock’s confident baritone.
Sherlock grit his teeth and scowled at the screen, but the Mycroft in his head was right. Other people with intellects vastly inferior to his own managed to go on dates every day without sending their partners off at the end of the night in taxis driven by murderous cabbies.
“Right. Look, we can talk about this—”
Harry snorted and crossed her arms over her chest.
Every action a study in grudging acquiescence, Sherlock put aside his experiment and threw himself across the sitting room and onto the sofa.
“W-Will you deduce what types of massages people should have? Mud baths for cheating spouses and the sauna for corrupt politicians?”
“I was expecting better, to be ‘onest. Everyone’s so stupid- even you.”
John nodded affably at the assembled officers staring at him, eyebrows rising when he saw Lestrade.
“Busy, Mrs. Hudson. Go away.”
gun, he realized. Obvious. He’d been too distracted with John’s safety to notice the signs when it was right in front of his nose. Dull.
“Sherlock,” John called from the kitchen doorway, “we’re almost out of honey. Should I order more, or do you want a different kind? Or,” his voice became hesitant and Sherlock looked up from checking his email, “I don’t have to if you’re tired of it. You like cane sugar. Should I get that instead?”
Tomorrow he’d meet with Sarah at the surgery, touch base with Harry. He hadn’t forgotten how he’d felt in the cab before realizing he was being kidnapped, just pushed those concerns aside in the rush of everything else. He’d need to re-examine those thoughts again soon, but not tonight.
“For god’s sake,” Mycroft finally snapped, turning back into the sitting room. “I will not have this conversation while fighting with a hair dryer. You have some idea why I’m here. Please give me the honor of your attention so we can both have done with this.”
John had lost all of his steam while Sherlock was talking and now sat staring in surprise.
"I’m not a child you can entice by offering a favorite sweet.”
The kiss lasted barely longer than the ones John had pressed to his knuckles, and John pulled away far too soon to fix whatever was now wrong with Sherlock.
“Alright, let’s get this off of you.”
“I thought this would be a simple request considering your interest in alternative remedies where I’m concerned.”
was the result? The last thing he needed was to remind John of his uncertainties early in their relationship. The plan was to hook him with the Work, distracting him from the boring normalities of dating Sherlock couldn’t be bothered with,
“This is just what you’ve needed, dear. I hate to think of you lonely up there.”
"Feels like a waste of time, coming all this way. Tomorrow's speaker cancelled."
He stood in the doorway to the flat, looked around at its cosy familiar chaos. His chair and Sherlock's, tucked by the fireplace. The sofa, the coffee table, the desk piled with papers.
"Well," she said. "Sussex is a bit far for a daily commute."
"It was fine," Sherlock agreed, because it had been. Mostly.
There it was again. That feeling of being watched. Of being
"Why are you here?" Sherlock says. He is not sure why he is bothering to ask again. He is unlikely to receive a satisfactory answer this time. He is not sure there
"Right," he said. He scratched at the back of his neck, suddenly very tired.
A little bell had chimed over the door at the dress shop when he'd stepped inside, rubbing his hands together to warm them. There was no attendant at the front desk, but he could hear muffled voices in the back, and so he'd made his way down the narrow aisles, brushing past full skirts and overdressed mannequins with eerie blank faces.
He opened his mouth for a sharp reply, stopped. Mycroft's face was pallid and weary. "You've been lying to me."
Sherlock shook his head, did not take his eyes from the urn. "No. You're not. Why aren't you?"
The music had been timed perfectly. The procession had… proceeded. The guests looked appropriately misty-eyed. Mary was resplendent in vintage lace.
Sherlock watched him. His eyes were very pale, nearly colourless.
Psychosomatic.
"Sorry," Janine had said, gesturing to the window. "I get a bit carsick."
"Yes, but—"
"You think I don't know that this—that it won't last? Can't last?" John says, softer now. "It's already not working."
"There's more to it than that," John said.
"You're wrong."
Parting in anger and sorrow and harsh words—that he could handle. Parting peacefully, shaking hands and going their separate ways as friends because whatever was between them had cooled—
strange. So she called us,” Lestrade said. “And—what are the odds? I mean. The missing Black Pearl of the Borgias!” He made a gleeful sound, slapped his knee with his open palm. “Hopkins is on vacation. She’s going to be bloody furious that she missed this!”
"Tomorrow," Sherlock had said, when Lestrade had approached John for a statement. "He's in shock." And then, after a pause: "Be sure to check the airing cupboard."
"What the hell is going on?" he asked.
"Don't apologize," John said. He could have laughed from the relief of it all. "I thought that—well. Never mind. You just—you just—lost phone signal."
"Sherlock, what—"
"Stop," he said. He looked down at the ground, at his own shoes against a bland grey carpet. "I can't see him. I can't—why is everyone so desperate to reassure me? I don't need to be reassured. Even Mary—"
"Jesus," John said. "You startled me." He put his phone in his pocket.
"I don't mean that you
Sherlock's parents had not known the truth.
They have stopped beneath the imposing skeleton of a sunken ship. Bits of aged wood jut out overhead. Wide wooden boards creak underfoot.
John takes another swallow. He sucks in a ragged breath that feels suspiciously like a sob.
He sagged against the wall, closed his eyes. "Shit," he said again.
Sherlock swallowed. He very carefully did not think of the years in which John was very much a constant presence in his life, but living elsewhere. When he was
"They're gone, now," John said.
incompetent."
"No."
His trousers were damp almost up to his knees. His feet were bare.
His chest tightens. He is able to hold his breath for just over three minutes. He has practised, over the years. Sort of thing that comes in handy in his line of work. (Still, there is always room for improvement. Three minutes will tick by quickly, and he's likely to be intercepted when he returns to the surface for another breath. There will not be an opportunity for a second dive.)
Sherlock was silent behind him. Silent and terribly still. Even his breathing had gone quiet.
John's vision swam.
And John—
she'd said. Her voice had been so flat, so detached.
John laughed softly in agreement. He flexed his hand, looked down. He did not like to think about that time. It was tied up in—other things. Unpleasant things.
"Yeah," John said. "There was a bit of a struggle and it—well. Went under a lorry."
Sherlock smiles, a wicked smile that promises things to come, and nips playfully at John's lip. Then he relaxes his grip, steps back. Takes a deep, steadying breath.
"I can't
John scrolled back down, reread the comments. Pete seemed supportive. Friendly. Familiar. Not just a passing acquaintance, then. Someone she knew. Someone she knew well.
John smiled, looked down at the ground, feeling a bit like a smitten schoolboy. His eyes stung and his chest ached, an onslaught of emotion threatening to claw free. He squeezed Sherlock's hand, let the pad of one fingertip roll over the wedding band.
"My room is right next door."
Molly came in the door. She was smiling, but looked flustered. Strands of long hair had worked loose from her ponytail. It was windy outside.
He doubted he'd like the answer. It did not stop him from thinking about it.
John thinks. It is only with some effort that he manages to drag himself away.
"Sorry," Sherlock said. He did not sound particularly sorry at all. "Were you under the impression that no one had noticed what you were up to?"
"I don't understand," Sherlock said. He peered down at John's face, seeking to unravel all of his mysteries, finding nothing. "You've been angry with me without a reason for weeks, but now that you have a reason, you—"
The snow had piled against the windshield, cocooning them in a strange half-darkness.
"So. The stag night," John said. He spoke into the mirror, holding eye contact with himself as he fumbled with his bow tie. He very carefully did not look to his left, where Sherlock was fussing with his own tie.
Sherlock turned left, set off into the crowd at a fast clip. John hurried to keep up.
"I did!"
"Because I wanted to get out," he said, with a sharp little laugh. "Wouldn't you?"
John stood at the foot of his bed, staring at him. His face was difficult to read.
No, not bravery. Necessity.
Sherlock crept forward, sweeping his hand behind him to indicate that John should follow. They advanced slowly.
"Half?"
"Don't feel sorry for her," Janine said.
John felt a pang as he thought about it, about the weeks and months that Janine had resided at Baker Street. She'd made herself at home, and Sherlock had enjoyed her company. There had been no romance, but they'd got to be friends. Actual, proper friends. And, he thought, Sherlock was going to miss her a little bit when she was gone. Even if he'd never admit it.
The man turned back, balled up another wad of wet, icy snow, hurled it in his direction.
John raised his brows, waited. Thought about Sherlock's face, about blood in his eyes.
They'd exchanged brief, stilted pleasantries. She was married now, she told him. Had two small daughters. She was happy.
The phone buzzed again. Insistent. He had always been difficult to ignore.
His voice trailed off. There was no need for him to finish his sentence. The stairs were their best option. Possibly the only option. They certainly couldn't go up through the ceiling.
Molly did not live in the victim's building, or anywhere near it. She was smiling (or, at least, she had been smiling before he approached), so it was unlikely that she was a friend or relative of the deceased. And as she'd most emphatically declined his last request for crime scene assistance (
"Ah—" John held up both hands, as if such a simple gesture could ever keep him at bay. "Doesn't this go against the whole—well, the whole spirit of the thing? Switching partners? I thought I was meant to dance with someone I've never danced with before."
"What happened to his son?" Sherlock asked.
John was sitting on the other bed, back against the wall, reading. He glanced up as Sherlock's bedsprings squeaked.
Sherlock swallows. He should keep speaking, he thinks. There are words he ought to say.
He winced, pinched at his nose again, sniffed. Already, there was a tickle building in the back of his throat, a maddening irritation just out of reach. His mouth had gone dry.
"Henry," John said. He looked at the dog. There was a ghost of a smile at the edge of his mouth.
Sherlock had not gone anywhere, not really, but John missed him. He missed him
"Sherlock," John said again, and his hands were cool on Sherlock's flushed face. If he had to go, this was acceptable. It wasn't what he wanted, but he'd take it. It was enough.
"Sherlock," John said. His voice was quiet, patient, and Sherlock thought it likely that he'd disappeared into his own head for longer than was generally considered appropriate.
"Just don't drag this out any longer than you have to," John managed. He clenched his fist, released it. Breathed out hard.
"His name. I assume he has one."
"I just didn't know you'd kept following his career," John says, his words flat and defensive to his own ears. "That's all."
He excused himself and went into the bathroom, looked at himself in the mirror. His face was pallid, tired. There were dark circles under his eyes. A bruise was slowly blooming from beneath the bandage on his forehead. Flecks of dried blood—his own—on his shirt.
Well. Sherlock had either heard him, and elected to ignore him, or—or he hadn't heard him at all, had tuned John out the moment the bartender had caught his attention. It wouldn't be surprising. He filtered. That's what he
"You heard me."
"—but, as reported, there is indeed a noise, perhaps a car backfire. Difficult to say for sure without a detailed audio analysis. The horse spooks, Thomas hits the ground at a bad angle and rolls under the hooves, and suddenly it's not a wedding but a funeral."
He turned away, walking off down the pavement without another word. Sherlock stood and watched him go.
"If it's a sore subject. Or—" John stopped again, breathed out through his nose. Stared straight ahead, not really looking at anything. He only did that when he was uncomfortable, when he was trying and failing to find the right words.
"There. See? Solved." John turned back towards the woman. "Come on."
Up close, the footbridge does not inspire much confidence, the boards are rotting and rickety, but the wooden supports are thick and driven far into the ground and it will have to do. They will not be able to outrun the storm, not now, not on foot.
"Take your
Sherlock parked their hired car next to a gleaming sports car. Watched John swivel his head to admire it.
He glanced over his shoulder as he walked, frowning as he saw the car slowly following in his wake. He stopped, straightened up. The car stopped as well.
"Mmadoctor," he mumbled, his head lolling backwards, his eyes squinting shut against the daylight.
She shifted in her seat, looked at him curiously.
It cannot be pleasant for John, being here.
She patted him on the arm, turned away. He listened to her footsteps as she left the flat, carefully descended the stairs. Then he returned his attention to the fridge.
things of you anymore."
The red rug was scratchy under his cheek. There was grit caught in the fibres, little bits of dirt and gravel. Sherlock could probably identify where it had all come from, could map his steps through London by the dirt he'd left behind.
He breathed out hard, went to the window, looked outside. The sky was grey. He dialed Sherlock's number again while watching the people walking on the pavement below. Listened as the phone rang and rang and rang, his heart sinking with every second that passed.
John took Sherlock's hand, twined their fingers together. Listened to Sherlock breathe.
"You're not alone," Mary said again.
"Yes," he said. "Yeah. I'm—I'm going to owe a lot of favours. But yes."
"Right," he said. He hesitated. "So he's—not coming, then? To the wedding."
wish you could have done it a bit more kindly. Janine had mascara all down her face when I saw her, poor dear, looked like she'd been crying for hours."
He thought of Reginald Teller, sprawled stiff and dead at the altar, crushed flowers from the mangled bouquet strewn all about his body.
So he tunes out the words that John is saying, instead takes the time to look his fill, to memorize all of the curves and planes of his friend's face. There are laugh lines around his eyes, deeper now than when they first met, and although he is not laughing now it is easy to remember the times they have laughed together, laughed well and loud.  He's never laughed quite the same way with anyone else as he laughs with John Watson. Their association has left its mark on John's skin. This pleases him.
Mycroft nodded. Folded his hands.
like that."
"Calls herself Irene," John said. "Pretty sure she stole your dressing gown. Well. One of them."
John put down the half-eaten scone. Cleared his throat. "Look, Mrs Hudson—"
people involved in creating that one perfect day."
"Are you—? This isn't—" John stopped. Breathed out hard through his nose. A frustrated sound. "What, exactly, is this?"
"Is he—is everything all right?"
Beyond John’s shoulder Sherlock saw Mycroft emerge from his car. He caught Sherlock’s eye and raised an imperious eyebrow. It was one thing for Mycroft to manipulate Sherlock’s internet search results. It was another for him to threaten his heavy-handed nosiness in person.
“Uh.”
“You know what, Harry? No, just no. I won’t be- Jesus, you can’t just expect me to
The more he considered it, Mostan’s involvement actually worked in his favor. People attributed all variety of idealized emotional twaddle to former lovers with no basis in reality to easily refute. John was already inclined to favor him after the cabbie, but solving a case together would make obvious the difference between the reality of Sherlock’s brilliance and whatever ill-fated fantasies John had once nursed about Morstan.
“The first bullet recoiled off the leg, went out the open window. The second didn’t miss.”
The question went unanswered in his race to catch Sherlock at the door. He wanted to ask as he struggled with his coat, but realized from Sherlock’s satisfied smirk that he’d planned this and was so flustered the words disappeared.
For one blissful second he was alone, and then everyone started breathing again and the silence was ruined, but the one second had been enough. Clever Jennifer Wilson, planting the phone on her murderer, using her blood to leave a clue to locate him. ‘Rachel’ hadn’t been a
"Don't be ridiculous," Sherlock said. "Who else is there?"
"I am not even going to pretend I know where you're going with this," John said.
They walked.
"You have to move,“ she said, frantic now, feeling her pulse pick up. "If you don’t, it will all have been for nothing.”
"It doesn't bother you at all, does it?" John asked. He was frowning, his eyes difficult to read in the fading daylight.
“No one says the name, and neither will I. It’s five times now I’ve played for what I wanted. Maybe God just loves me.”
“No. He was skimming too much off the top, or taking jobs on the side, haven’t figured out which yet. His colleagues were displeased, but whoever they hired for the job botched it; you can’t get information from a corpse.”
“Sherlock is a lovely young man,” she beamed. “He helped me out of a spot of trouble with my late husband. I’m so pleased to see him finally bringing home a date.”
Two things:
Hope’s eyes were glazed; he was having trouble focusing. Sherlock shook him hard, pressing in until their foreheads nearly touched.
“It was the building manager, of course.” Instantly all attention in the room turned to him. “But he’s being blackmailed by the owner to conduct the arson as a ransom scheme. There’s something in these properties he doesn’t want found and he needed a fall man to take the suspicion away from himself. He’s been nervous about this from the start, and rightly so, but his desire to move to St. Croix has nothing to do with the stress of the situation and everything to do with wanting to get out of the country to enjoy his illicit millions.
“I’m not- I’m not sure exactly,” Andy Galbraith said as he looked at Sherlock’s mobile. “I don’t know as much about calligraphy as Soo Lin— That’s Soo Lin Yao, my coworker who quit unexpectedly. She’d really know more about this than I would.”
men, it’s true, but every so often… There was the one boy in secondary, Toby, who you were utterly mad for until his family moved away at the end of  the term. And I’m
Sherlock moved further into the room to offer his hand, giving John a clear view of the man rising from behind the desk for the first time.
really happened. He laughed once in sheer relieved delight and shoved his phone at Harry.
“Nonsense.” He finished whatever he was doing and pocketed it. “I might not have caught Hope if it hadn’t been for you. Your assistance was invaluable. It’s the least I can do.”
John bustled back into the sitting room, steaming mug of tea in one hand and a plate of toast in another.
Mrs. Hudson jumped and shut up about the taxi.
“Dead.” He said as if there was any doubt after that display, and, in a surprising show of compassion from someone whose disgust for Hope’s activities had been obvious, closed the dead man’s eyes.
“Don’t tell me they’ve called you in on it.”
Nobody answered at De Kleine’s apartment and Sherlock’s theory on how the intruder entered the bank was confirmed when he let himself in through De Kleine’s unlocked balcony door. Already suspecting the broker’s fate, Sherlock took his time looking around the rest of the flat.
“But I’m not sure if she’s in on it or just a middle man. I need to get behind the counter. Do you think you could distract her for about five minutes, just long enough for me to—”
Sherlock was waiting for him at the escalators, looking at something on his phone.
John turned a page with a jerky too-fast movement, clearly aware of Sherlock’s stare despite his attempt to appear otherwise. The paper rustled as he shook the contents back into alignment and his hands clenched on the edges of it, now chiding himself for overcompensating while Sherlock was watching. Still pretending to read, John reached for his empty mug and had raised it to his lips before he realized his mistake. With a loud, aggrieved sigh John put it back down. Sherlock smiled in triumph and closed his eyes as if he hadn’t been watching John the entire time. There was the crinkle of cheap newsprint as John closed the paper and set it aside, and then the creak of John’s chair and the dull thud of his footsteps on the rug.
“Friend.”
“Right, that’s it. Pull over. Now.”
a coward.”
“There’s another important aspect of the Work you could assist me in, if you’d like.”
It would be easy, really. In fact, Sherlock could treat it as a new experiment. He’d never tried to hold another person’s attentions for longer than a few days. It would be a matter of weeks, maybe a few months, before Mummy was convinced and so pleased with his supposed romance that she had Mycroft sign over the financial independence Sherlock needed to continue The Work.
“Before you inevitably go haring off into the street,” he found whatever he was looking for and set it down triumphantly on the table next to Sherlock’s coffee, “here.”
John swallowed and tilted his head back to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
The cabbie ignored his sarcasm.
Sherlock spent another minute staring fixedly into his microscope, not wanting to encourage John too much. As per his caregiver personality, John found gift giving a way to demonstrate his aptitude as a provider through tangible objects. Though an excellent doctor, his efforts in this regard were frequently wasted on Sherlock. As with many other things he routinely failed at—lying convincingly, keeping a hold of his temper, maintaining a “normal” dating life—John was simply not as good at it as he thought he was. Sherlock had long since made it clear such gestures weren’t necessary, but John stubbornly persisted in being disappointed.
The server appeared at that moment with their food, saving John from having to reply immediately.
“Right. Yes, you did say you might…” Arthur looked at him, glanced back at John. “Colleague?”
“Why are you doing this? You said you had a ‘quota.’ Is this just some sick way for you to get off?”
Louder behind him, the sound of a new voice. John had finally arrived. Sherlock didn’t raise his head, only waited for John to join him by the body.
Mycroft cut himself off, tapping his umbrella harder upon the floor than intended in his shock. Sherlock would have liked to relish the look on his face, but he wasn’t motivated enough to move from where he lay facedown on the sofa.
Sherlock, ostensibly engrossed in an experiment testing the absorption rate of lung tissue with various liquids, didn’t respond. Despite hearing each of John’s footsteps as he walked over, he still startled when John, instead of calling out to get his attention, removed the heat pack and replaced it with his hands instead.
“You mentioned you liked honeybees.” John looked positively chuffed at this pronouncement. “So I hunted down an online store that sold them with bee fabric. Molly helped me find it. Site called Etsy with loads of different options. I just chose the one I liked best.”
John groaned and scrubbed a hand over his face. Trust Harry to go and ruin what had honestly felt like a bit of a moment between them.
Even the day before a comment from her on his blog would have evoked annoyance at what he’d view as a push for a phone call that would inevitably end in an argument.
Ignoring Lestrade’s protests, Sherlock completed another circuit and rounded on John.
. It’s normal, and if you hadn't deleted self preservation you'd understand that."
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Let’s not,
John raised both eyebrows and walked over to sit in his armchair.
A waspish retort died on his tongue, because John wasn’t wrong. Compared against the pictures on his mobile, the brushstrokes of the reproduction
“You don’t, John,” Sherlock refuted bluntly. “The last time I followed you on your lunch break you called me to ask if we needed milk and didn’t notice that I answered from the other side of the cafe.”
He stood up without looking at the laptop to avoid attracting Lestrade’s attention. They’d notice the still-open tracker after he’d left, but that couldn’t be helped. It wouldn’t matter if they followed him, but he couldn’t risk being bogged down by their inane questions when every second brought John closer to death.
“Sherlock, why are you wearing that?”
Harry greeted her coffee with a relieved sigh, and John took the opportunity to study her. She hadn’t been lying about oversleeping; this was probably her first source of caffeine after rushing out of her flat. She’d only bothered with makeup to cover the worst of her exhaustion, but couldn’t do anything to hide her red-rimmed eyes or the general paleness of her skin. Harry was sober again and struggling with it. He stared for a moment too long and Harry’s eyes opened, lingering satisfaction over her coffee shifting instantly into annoyance.
The instant the words left his mouth John realized they might be insensitive. Thinking back, Sherlock had spent more time talking than he had eating. There’d been girlfriends in the past who wouldn’t eat in front of him on the first few dates, nervous he’d judge them for their orders or having an appetite. Sherlock didn’t seem the type to care, but maybe John was being sexist for assuming only women did that and a cad for drawing attention to it.
“Sherlock, can we
Sherlock looked again, desperate for anything he’d missed. On closer inspection Lestrade was staring at the wall in lieu of the corpse because John, now the official presence hadn’t censored him, had moved closer to it.
Mycroft’s information was barely useful. He already knew the doctor’s surname from the back of his phone. His first name was hardly important—Sherlock needn’t ever use the man’s name so long as he had his number—and he’d learn it eventually. The blog he found provided little beyond confirming the desultory relationship with his therapist Sherlock had already guessed. He was interested to note in the comments that they shared Mike Stamford from Bart’s as a contact, but couldn’t see how that might be relevant and returned to his original task.
“Who told you? Was it your sponsor?”
, and there was the steel. John
Sherlock grunted what could have been agreement or what could have been a florid deprecation about Mycroft’s metabolic rate into the cushion. Mycroft left without another word.
He picked up Sherlock’s other hand and began covering those cuts as well.
John stuttered to a halt in a rant about paisley, for some reason.
“All right, what have you got for me, Sherlock?”
Some of the confidence with which John had presented the lip balm faded. He was obviously uncertain of Sherlock’s reception of his gift from the way he’d begun to nervously fidget with his coffee cup.
John opened his mouth and closed it without having said anything. Talking to Harry was marginally better than talking to his therapist, but several months’ worth of strained conversations with his sister hadn’t made either of them better at expressing themselves.
“Don’t move!”
John was beside him suddenly, both hands prying Hope’s jaws apart as if he could reach in and pull the poison capsule out, but there was no
Sherlock waved his bee-adorned hand in John’s face and frowned when he only rolled his eyes and reclaimed Sherlock’s hand.
“John.”
John finished with the ointment and began unwrapping one of his honeybee plasters.
“Potential dates should know the worst about each other, don’t you agree? Give me your phone.”
you’ve a therapist.”
Sherlock’s attention sharpened.
Much like John himself, his technique was firm and determined, seeking out and locating all the tender spots Sherlock hadn’t even known existed, steadily wearing away at them with rhythmic motions from his hands and fingers. He found a knot and pressed into it, pressed and held, and Sherlock’s hiss of pain turned into a moan of pleasure. He tried to stifle the sounds, but gave up when they were ripped from his throat every time John worked a kink out of his muscles.
“Now, what was that about carbon monoxide?”
Sherlock beamed, pleased with John for having finally caught on.
, Sherlock! And you told me we did even though when I came home there wasn’t any!”
“Look,” John put his cup down and pushed the saucer away with a grimace, “I’m just not ready to date yet, Harry. I’m still settling in.”
“Now where would be the fun in that? One’s safe and the other isn’t. You pick one and I’ll take the other.”
"Not me," Janine said. "Well. Not only me. Us."
John was still frowning towards the woman, his lips pressed in a tight line.
"Right," John said, grateful for the chance to escape with his dignity intact.
There is something tugging at his subconscious, something too large and terrifying to comprehend. He ignores it, because if he lets his thoughts stray in that direction, he does not know if he'll be able to pull them back.
John looked back. Shrugged. Put his hands in his coat pockets, his shoulders hunched a bit against the chill.
John huffed a laugh. He was very aware of the sound of approaching sirens, growing ever louder. "Might have saved you some trouble. Would have created some for me."
"It wasn't your fault," Sherlock said. His voice was low, careful.
boyfriend. Together less than two months, yes? Someone so obviously fixated on her appearance wouldn't be comfortable letting her guard down that early into a relationship."
"Clearly, in his mind, implicating Jimmy McCarthy in the murder of his father would remove all of McCarthy's influence from his daughter's life," Sherlock said. "Two birds, one stone. Isn't that the saying?"
he could read years' worth of history in dust, he could trace his way backwards through every book the man had read, every single move he'd made in the flat right up until the moment he'd—
had been the subject of their conversation.
There were trays of seasoned chicken breasts, steaks swimming in marinade, bowls of chopped vegetables ready to be roasted. Nothing seemed out of place.
"Sherlock, you—"
He thinks he has, likely, always wanted some variation of this. He's learned to live with his inaction.
"That was," John said, breathing hard. He did not show signs of wanting to flee. "I—just. I've wanted. I've wanted this. For years."
And so on and so forth. They made him uncomfortable, much like the platitudes that had poured in after Mary had died.
He stood up. He stepped forward.
He looked at his phone. Swallowed. Shook his head.
He presses the EXECUTE key, starts a new line.
"Of course she knew. Her life depended on knowing things, on
"Ten minutes," she said. "Anything past that, you'll need to take it outside."
"You'll miss," John said. His own hand was quite steady. "But I won't."
Camera batteries drained, car engines stalling at inopportune moments. Faulty hard drives. Lost data.
"Turns out they didn't need me," John says.
On the other side of the door, the party seemed to be in full swing. There was music, and the indistinct swell of conversation and raucous good cheer.
There was an officer posted outside of Sherlock's door at St Caedwalla's, but he merely looked up and nodded wordlessly at John as he approached.
Sherlock is grateful for that. He will always be grateful for that. There was affection there, between him and Mary. It was the sort of affection that felt a bit like a gunshot to the chest, a bit like surgery, painful and wrenching and skirting the edges of fatal, but it was there all the same. He liked her. He is sorry she is dead. He is particularly sorry that she died in his stead. He thinks John is sorry about that too, though they do not talk about it. He does not want to talk about it. Thinking it is one thing, but hearing John admit out loud that he'd rather Sherlock had died that night at the aquarium might be worse than that gunshot to the chest in the end.
What had he said when Sherlock burst into the room? First, concern for Sherlock’s health even though
“Yes well,” Sherlock said briskly to discourage any prying questions, “I’m not exactly flush with friends, am I? Are we done here?"
Sherlock belly-flopped onto the sofa in a way that made his dressing gown flare eye-catchingly wide. He turned to look at John expectantly, sat in his chair with the newspaper open in his hands and an empty mug of tea on the table at his side. His flatmate, doctor, blogger, and more recently, personal masseuse didn’t even twitch.
“It’s the biggest case the Met has on at the moment. Not hard to guess you’d heard of it. Finding the fourth body after the press conference has the media in an uproar.”
to maintain a relationship with a dull doctor going through a sexual identity crisis, at least the man in question appreciated Sherlock’s Work.
had been in the most danger. Then, an inquiry about the police, repeated out of desire to see the cabbie handed over to the proper authorities.
Instead of the boxes of generically flesh-toned plasters normally found in the kit he pulled out a box decorated with—
Mycroft and his bloated ego appeared, and settled a hand on John’s back. Mycroft’s smirk grew disgustingly smug, but he took the hint and turned towards where Lestrade was standing. He also had the pleasure of seeing Sally’s mouth fall open in disbelief, too shocked to affect inattention.
“I want you to kiss them.”
Sherlock shifted and John caught the flash of pale eyes in his direction before he drew himself up, tall and impossibly elegant.
Sherlock circled Morstan’s desk to examine the contents. A ceramic cat painted by an unsteady hand, and a pair of framed photographs. One of Morstan and his deceased wife with their very young daughter, the other of the girl several years later—taken within the past six months based on the frame and lack of fading—in a garish pink dress with clashing costume jewelry. His papers were disorganized, but there wasn’t a hint of dust anywhere, including the thriving plants by the windows. Morstan’s watch was expensive and flashy, his clothing older, tie and jacket rumpled. Incautious with money in his youth, he’d learned care for his possessions only recently. Gambling, if Sherlock had to guess, which explained John’s former attraction to a man who was now the epitome of responsible single fatherhood.
“What’s dreadful is this blanket. As if you haven’t seen worse deaths over the course of your career.”
Sherlock ignored Donovan’s skepticism in favor of inspecting De Kleine’s legs, smirked at what he saw, and removed the right shoe and sock. The foot revealed was flesh-tone and stiff from something other than rigor mortis, the company name
“You did enjoy your Fencing Club for a time early in your University career.”
“Er, actually, that is-”
“Are all of your dates this exciting?”
“Sorry, when did you say the police are coming?”
“Okay,” Harry declared after they’d composed themselves. “You have to actually
“We’re done here, John.”
“Really, John. Another heating pack! This one covers a limited surface area and I have to wait for the microwave whenever it loses heat. Both of those problems could be remedied if I had a spare.”
Barely a minute later John pushed his way into the office backwards, both of his hands occupied with cheap paper cups of what the Met considered tea. He set one down on Lestrade’s desk and wrapped his hands around the other as he turned towards Sherlock. Automatically, his eyes dipped from Sherlock’s face to his lips, just as they had the past fourteen times Sherlock had repeated the experiment under similar conditions.
“I know in the past you’ve considered me a challenge for finding ‘the perfect gift,’ but if I’d known it would launch you on this single-minded campaign, I might have rethought accepting your birthday present.”
“Sherlock,” John sighed when he could breathe again. “You can’t make everything better with kisses.” The way his entire body was still angled in Sherlock’s direction belayed his words.
“For god’s sake, Sherlock, just open the damn thing. You don’t need to listen to it, or smell it, or whatever. You’re going to open it anyway.”
“I’ve learned everything I needed already.”
Sherlock sniffed and looked down his nose at the shorter man, which had the anticipated result of making John puff out his chest further in aggravation.
By the end of her list John’s face was a dull red, and though he told himself it was from anger, he couldn’t deny that Harry wasn’t at least a
"You could have called."
"You'll have to be more specific."
"It was either that or—" Sherlock stopped. Unbidden, in his mind, he saw himself, desiccated and pallid, strung up in sticky gossamer strands. His own mouth, wide open in a silent scream, his eyes alert and still somehow alive.
"No, John," Sherlock said. His voice was slow, very patient. He kept his eyes closed. "I am not."
Molly had stood next to him in the morgue and watched the spider push out from between Moriarty's cold dead lips. It had rattled her. It had rattled them both.
Culverton Smith, dead in his cell. And, worse than that: the uncomfortable realisation that Mycroft had listened to the tape, that he'd sat at his desk and poured himself a glass of something expensive and listened as Sherlock's unwavering faith in John finally cracked under Smith's smothering hand.
"Hi," Mary says, and she is still smiling, and then she is shaking hands and saying something to Molly that makes her let out a nervous peal of laughter, and it seems all right.
"Mm, likely, given what we know about his credit card debts and gambling habit." Sherlock looked back at the bloodstain, dark against the pavement in the fading sunlight.
Well, no matter. It was a lovely day, and Vivian had agreed to meet him for lunch.
It comes to him, as it often does, in a flood of white-hot realization. He breathes out, rests his fingertips against his mouth.
"You don't need to thank me," she said. "That's not—I didn't do it for thanks. I did it because. Because that's what friends do. And I'm Rosie's godmother, and I love her, and she needs—" Molly paused, bit her lip. "I mean, she
A shifting next to him, a rustle of cloth. John.
"Sherlock," John manages to gasp out, and he thinks he may humiliate himself by dropping to his knees on the floor. He takes a shaky step, and then another, and then he is gripping the back of his chair, holding himself upright. He is trembling.
He frowned, pushed it shut and checked the lock. The carpet just below the window was damp, faintly dirtied. Rain must have blown in during the night. He turned back to look at Rosie, who rummaged through her toys, unaware.
"I made a vow," Sherlock hissed, abandoning his efforts at the door and whirling around to face his brother. He was surprised at his own vehemence, at the depth of the anger that came bubbling up.
He breathed out, hard, then squared his shoulders and climbed the stairs.
"Favourite case," he said, which was a great deal better than
He swallowed, looked uncomfortably towards the door. "I'm sure that's not true."
Sherlock said nothing. The furrow between his brows had disappeared. He looked away, stared at the darkened fireplace. He looked—
"Which isn't to say," Sherlock said, and hesitated. "That they aren't. Nice."
It is
He left everything as he'd found it, shut the door quietly behind him. The corridor was silent, empty.
John was speaking. And Mary. Exchanging sentimental words, no doubt.
Mycroft is speaking, but Sherlock is not listening. He is memorizing John's face.
"John?" Sherlock's voice, low and strained and worried.
Sherlock nodded back. His brow had furrowed up.
"Nothing besides the obvious, you mean."
The smell of the lilies reminded him, chokingly, of Mary's funeral, of the endless floral arrangements that had arrived with heartfelt condolences from friends and family he rarely saw.
He hesitated. Thought of Sherlock, pinned by laser sights at Appledore. The look on his brother’s face as he’d pulled the trigger on Magnussen.
He wants to whirl around, wants to seize John by the lapels of his coat and shake him, wants to bring their faces close together and demand an explanation for John's presence here.
"West!" She calls back. "Near Billings. NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles on the dryline!"
"That's when the fun begins," Sherlock said. He succeeded in liberating his trouser leg from Rosie's iron grip, hoisted her up to sit on his knee. She seemed to feel that was an acceptable compromise and settled down.
"Well done, you’ve found it,“ Sherlock cut in.
The flowers were worse than the cake.
with her. Hell, he might as well marry her for real, the way they got on. He certainly didn't need John hanging around, filling up the space with uncomfortable silences.
The commenter was a woman. Someone named Julie. He'd looked her up months ago, when he'd first started his research. A solicitor, he recalled. Not someone anywhere near the wedding industry, but perhaps he'd missed something.
sacked," she said. "You still had to show up for the—you know. Actual sacking."
"Right," John says. He clears his throat, shifts to look out the window.
"Sherlock—"
"Mm," Sherlock agrees, his voice mild. "And look where that ended up."
He did not like that laugh.
John held him. He held him as he'd always wanted to, close and safe. Listened to Sherlock's unsteady breathing as they stood together in the dark.
"Yeah," John said, finally, after far too much time had passed. He held Sherlock's gaze. "Mary."
"Christ," he said, and lifted his hands to his eyes. His cheeks were wet.
"Signed and ready."
"Oops," he said, giving an exaggerated look around. "Wrong shop."
Mary's silence is quite conspicuous.
"And what is it you think you can do?"
He double-checked the window before he left. It was shut snugly, and locked. Already her room felt warmer.
"Don't let my bad timing be the thing that ruins Dr Hooper's birthday," he said. "Please."
John staggered back like he'd been punched, his head thudding hard against the refrigerator door. Sherlock's lips were harsh and insistent against his own. There was no trace of the morning's hesitance.
he thought miserably.
John looked at him. "What do you mean?"
Sherlock made a sound that might have been agreement or might have been dissent. It was difficult to say for certain. His eyes remained shut, his face a wretched study in defeated misery.
John reaches past Sherlock to pick up the book that Rosie had discarded in her earlier excitement. It is a field guide of sorts, photographs and descriptions of various dog breeds. Rosie has carefully marked an X in pencil next to several entries. Below them, in his distinctive hand, Sherlock has written in the dates.
"Yes," Sherlock said.
he'd said.
"Oh," John said. He frowned, looked at the bag. Stooped to set it on the ground. Straightened up again with a groan.
John washed his hands, studiously avoided meeting his own gaze in the mirror.
"Another," he said, when it was over.
They were dancing.
"What makes you so sure?"
"Hm? Me? Fine," Sherlock says. "Why do you ask?"
"He got so much more than he'd asked for," Sherlock said. "Instead of a quick laugh at a romantic rival's expense, he got to play the hero, rescuing the damsel from the cruel tyrant." He paused, smiled. It was a sharp smile, predatory. "And then he got a taste for it."
"Sleeping together."
"Not happening."
He'd push the stilted politeness aside, he thought. He'd sit back down in his chair next to his empty cup of tea and he'd tell Sherlock everything. He'd tell him about Mary, about the way his guilty conscience kept her close. He'd tell him how fucking sorry he was, and how grateful he was, and how badly he wanted them both to just
Except—he'd done quite a few things he could never have imagined himself doing, hadn't he? He'd proven, time and time again, that he wasn't the man he thought he was. That others thought he was. That he wanted to be.
"Oh, I've been keeping busy," she said. There was a bit of mischief in her voice.
"You were willful, defiant, forever set on your own course. There were times when the things you wanted made no sense to me whatsoever, yet you rejected any and all attempts to steer you to more appropriate waters."
Ice seeping through his veins. Dull shock. Mary, speaking to him. Bleeding. He hadn't tried hard enough. He hadn't—he should have—
John went for his neck, hot mouth latching on and, oh,
There was a pack of cigarettes in his pocket and he reached for it, turned it over in the palm of a gloved hand. John would smell the smoke on him. The thought made him hesitate for longer than it should have, and then he shook it off, lit a cigarette.
He walked past the Baker Street flat a handful of times. He did not let himself stop to look up at the windows.
She grunted, reached for the papers again. He shifted her on his lap so she was facing in a different direction.
John jolted in his seat, looked up. The laughter did not sound hysterical, or crazed, or desperate. It was a slow rising chuckle, deep and rumbling.
"Oh," Mary says. She frowns at the barrel for a moment. "That's—well, I'm sure that's very exciting. But is there a purpose to all of this, beyond scientific curiosity?"
"Hearts and flowers and pretty butterflies," Sherlock says impatiently, unable to keep his voice from edging into a high, mocking tone. "I know."
"Yeah, well, thought it might be good for him," Greg said, finally. "Hasn't been having an easy time of it. You know."
Plot-wise, at this point in the story Mary is meant to have killed Moriarty. Her actions bring her to the attention of the authorities, and her identity is compromised. Mycroft pulls some strings, and Mary and John are offered placement in a witness protection program. Sherlock has come to see them off.
After a moment, he lifts his curious face to regard Sherlock. Gives a tentative wag of his tail.
He reached his floor and crept down the hallway, treading lightly on the threadbare carpet. Nothing seemed unusual or out of place.
he reminded himself. This was not the time to be making any sort of soppy declarations, regardless of how lovely Sherlock looked.
"Just—" John said. "Hold on."
"Sorry, what?" John says.
She is speaking. She has been speaking for quite a while. Perhaps it is time to tune back in.
"I have not always been the best at articulating my feelings."
He put the plate down. Swallowed. Cleared his throat. Looked up at the ceiling.
Well. It was the most likely possibility. He'd read the situation wrong. Had flung himself into action without thinking it through. Wouldn't be the first time.
"Well," Mary said. "There was a shortage of legitimate job opportunities for someone with my skillset. Thanks to your organization and its
"No," John says. "No, it's fine. I'm—I don't do this anymore."
without encountering a single creative murder. Months! And half the time when the Yard calls me in on other matters, it's because they've placed wagers on how long it will take me to sort it out."
No, it would have to be a direct confrontation.
"Sherlock," John says. "There are so few areas where I have the upper hand on you. But this is one of them, I think."
Sherlock's mouth twitched into a smile. He ducked his head, cleared his throat. "Well. Also, there's been a murder in town. I assume the police will be by shortly to request our assistance."
"You haven't been here in a while," John said, breaking the silence.
"I've been—" Sherlock said.
Sherlock had cleared his throat, sat up straight. Folded his hands conspicuously under his chin to hide their trembling. "Your room is, of course, free."
he corrects himself a moment later. Sherlock is watching the
Sherlock shakes his head. None of the words coming out of John's mouth make sense. "You don't need to be here for this."
He sends it, puts the phone back down on the table. Thinks to himself that the Abominable Brother does not seem quite so abominable after all.
Christ, at this rate he'd be lucky make it home before the clock struck midnight.
The faint amusement around John's mouth drops away. He looks older, suddenly, and quite tired.
"Well," Sherlock said, springing to his feet, moving to the window. "If you'd been paying attention,  you'd have noticed—"
"The fuck?"
"I don't know," John said. "Are there standards for that sort of thing?"
"Actually—" Sherlock said.
"Oh," she said. "Was it that bad?"
John was in his chair by the fireplace. He looked over his shoulder at them as they came through the door. His expression was wary.
kissing him, his mouth hard and determined. His hand has come up to curl possessively at the back of John's neck, drawing him closer, his breaths unsteady.
John smiled back. His heart felt lighter than it had in years.
She was the last to accept Alice's Facebook request. She did not send a message.
It would be even more efficient, John thought, if Sherlock were to strip down entirely. If they were to press, skin-to-skin, beneath both the wool blanket and heavy coat. If Sherlock could dry off and warm up without wet clothes clinging to his legs.
Sherlock ignored him. "Doubtful, as you've not mentioned it. You've not taken any extra precautions when a case takes us out of London, nor have you had any adverse reactions over the years."
"And then—" John winced as he thought about the horror of that moment, of Christopher Thomas tumbling under lashing hooves. The chaos, the confusion that must have followed.
"Hm?"
The wall.
"Because I can save your brother's life with one phone call," she said. "It might not be too late."
He rolled his eyes, turned back. "As ever, you fail to give yourself enough credit—"
"I know," she said.
It didn't matter what he'd thought. He'd been wrong.
"Why are you here?" John asked him again. He was not quite sure he wanted to hear the answer. He was not quite sure he could bear
John looks at him, says nothing. He is leaning against the wall near one of the viewing windows, arms crossed. His face is bathed in rippling blues, his expression unreadable.
"Have a look," he said.
"Right," John said, after a long moment. He reached for the remote. "Food will be here in about twenty minutes."
This was the shirt she wore on the first day they'd met, he noted absently, the warm soft fabric slipping through his fingers. And this is the one she wore the day she put a hole in Sherlock's chest. There's the red turtleneck she favoured at Christmas time.
"Which is it? Two? Or three?"
"Sorry," John says. He is not smiling. He looks tired and uncomfortable and unhappy.
"You made him part of it," Moriarty said.
Now this.
John stared after him for a moment, then jolted into action. "Wait!"
He jerked in his seat, caught off guard. Met her gaze. Frowned. "What do you mean?"
John had shut his eyes, was making the face that usually meant he was calling upon great reserves of inner patience.
"No," Sherlock said. "If I'd followed you, all of this could have been avoided."
"I'm not particularly fond of roses," Janine said.
John felt suddenly quite exposed, as if his every thought, every confused muddled feeling was on display as he breathed in Sherlock's scent, as he swayed slowly in Sherlock's arms. He did not want Pete to see him as a kindred spirit. He did not want Pete's pity.
There was an uncomfortable familiarity to the scene playing out before him—John's discomfort and sudden retreat, the invocation of Rosie as a convenient excuse. A year ago, Sherlock had held his tongue, had let John walk out of the flat and (so it happened) out of his life. Then, he'd mistaken John's behaviour as lingering anger over Sherlock's role in Mary's death, as resentment over his perceived obligations.
"It's not any of the florists," Sherlock announced, brushing past them and taking the stairs two at a time. He seemed energetic, invigorated.
John looks at him somberly. "I think this might be the only place I've ever been happy."
After an interminable period of chitchat, she goes. She leaves the box behind. He cannot quite bring himself to look at it again and so he takes himself down to Tesco. Buys a newspaper.
"Nothing," John had said, smoothing his face back into what he hoped was a reassuring smile. He'd provided a boilerplate list of instructions for caring for a simple bee sting, and disconnected the call.
The lovely
did not feel like an appropriate reply.
He sighed. "Sorry," he said. "I have a—it's a bit of an emergency."
It was ridiculous. It was useless. He could sit here all night fiddling with the phone and not getting any closer to getting through. Sherlock Holmes had placed his trust in the wrong person, and he was going to pay for that error with his life.
"I can wait," John says.
now, but she should be in the clear. You'll need to speak with her, and you'll need to be discreet."
John hears the admiration. Sherlock has always appreciated a good trick.
John's face changed. He shoved the pillow off of his lap, stood up. Stared down at his hand.
I leave them here, happy and smiling in the home they've made together.
"Then kindly get out of my way and let me finish my work."
She put a hand on Sherlock’s arm, felt the jump of his traitorous pulse. The sheet shifted minutely, stilled. He was holding his breath.
"Oi!" John grabbed the man's shoulder, hauled him up, and punched him.
"No, just—it's fine," John said. He shook his head. "I'm sorry. You've—um. You've made it plain that you don't want to talk about it, and I keep pressing, yeah? I'd just thought—well. We've already established that I'm an idiot, yeah?"
"New Year's Day. Yep. Got it." John looked over at his old chair. Rosie had clambered down, was making her way with clumsy, determined steps towards Sherlock. She caught his trouser leg in her fists, tugged.
Sherlock was going to be all right.
"In an hour? And do let Mrs Hudson know."
"It was in the chicken!“
The morning sun painted the front of the cottage in pale gold. The warm light belied the chill in the air. The wind was bracing, and carried a hint of salt.
about lack of sleep—"
She was not inclined to be cooperative, but he finally wrangled her into a fresh nappy and new clothes. She went scrambling off towards her little toy box and he turned to watch her, his attention snagging on the window in the far corner of the room.
"Because that's what people do on birthdays, Sherlock. You have cake. Someone puts a candle in it and sometimes there's an entire chorus of waiters to sing to you and it's all terribly embarrassing and you'll absolutely hate it and we should go, we should go
"John," Sherlock says. "I realise that you have little cause to trust me. But I—I had a very good reason to do what I did. I swear to you."
these people?
John knew exactly what it felt like to be that close to him.
"And that's my cue to leave," John said, leaning forward to press a hasty kiss against Sherlock's lips.
It couldn't hurt to check. One more time. Just in case.
"It's the first Saturday in April this year," Sherlock said, his tone slightly defensive. "Besides, it seemed fitting."
Sherlock had looked up at that, frowning. Under the laboratory's fluorescent lights, his eyes had looked almost colorless. "What?"
He'd spent much of the day preparing himself to deal with the fallout from his own stupidity. But he'd clearly underestimated the damage he'd wrought.
John smiles tightly, shrugs. "So. Care to explain why I just spent the last several hours hiding in the gents?"
"Time to find out," he says.
Not leaving, then.
But it hadn't been a dream. He knew that.
He watched the dots. Blinking and blinking and blinking. They disappeared. Started blinking again. He felt oddly anxious, watching them.
His shoes whispered across a threadbare carpet. Down the hall, past staff bathrooms and a small locker room. It was quiet, the sounds of merriment distant and indistinct.
John looked over his shoulder. His expression was strange—resigned, a little amused. "No, it really wouldn't have. Well. She'd have been upset about the carpet. But not about—you know."
“Could be dangerous.”
Sherlock licked his lips, suddenly nervous. As he normally did, John had accepted his conclusions easily enough, taking the results of Sherlock’s experiments for granted even though he hadn’t been detailed on the experiment parameters or the controls. But telling John something was one thing, and asking him was another. Usually Sherlock ordered, firm in his knowledge of what John would and wouldn’t do on command. He didn’t often make requests unsure of John’s response.
But it wasn't just about him, anymore. He had Rosie to consider. And Sherlock as well, Sherlock who had—who had given up so much of himself, over and over again. Was it fair of him to keep asking for more?
tweed jacket and kiss the blood from his lips and make him swear never to disappear again.
"Not sure I can promise that," John said. He took a deep breath, stepped inside.
"Sherlock," John said, following. "What—"
and just—"
"Sherlock."
Sherlock's face, sad and expectant.
Thought of Sherlock, waxy and cold, unmoving on the banks of the Thames. John had thrown himself over the railing and into the water without a second thought. Had gotten his arm around Sherlock's chest and had pulled Sherlock's chilled body against his.
John stared at him, thought of the way he'd beamed that soppy, false smile into the security camera, the way he'd held up that ring and bit his lip like he was nervous. He thought of Janine, sleep-rumpled and clad in Sherlock's shirt, wearing an unashamed smile, moving around the flat like she lived there. Thought of Sherlock, still and pale on Magnussen's floor, blood seeping from a hole in his chest and that damned ring still in his pocket.
Sherlock had gone. His blood-stained clothes lay in a neat pile on the gurney, next to the discarded sheet.
"I'd have caught that eventually," Sherlock said. "I
"So you solve things," Harry says as he comes through the door. Her voice is a little too bright, a little too interested.
"I kept the chair."
anywhere."
"Mrs Hudson," John said, pausing as his mind caught and stalled on
John did not move. His hands gripped the footrest, knuckles gone quite white.
The hallway was no cooler than the room, although it had the benefit of being empty. He leaned against the peeling wallpaper and thought about the photographs. Hattie in her wedding dress, going through the motions, her hands shaking, her eyes on another.
"No reason," John says. He hesitates for a moment longer, then goes.
She took it with a coy little smile, went over to join Lily and Evie.
Sherlock thought. He pressed his lips together.
John had been on his second beer. Sherlock was squinting into the viewfinder of his camera, fiddling with the settings, his brow creased with concentration.
"Second date. Obvious. The first didn't exactly light your fire, but as it clearly wasn't an absolute disaster you felt obliged to try again. Not
"The aquarium," John says. He smiles, but it is an unhappy thing, a sad twist of his lips. "That's what I—what I was trying to say last night. When I told you that it was all right. Being there. That it didn't bother me as much as I'd thought it might. It's not that—look, when I think about it, it's all a bit, erm—"
John was right, of course. The soles were slick.
"Is it always this much fun, solving crimes?" she asked over her shoulder as she started up the stairs.
"No," John said, but he opened the window anyway.
John was moving through the crowd before he knew what he was doing, before he could even hope to stop himself, because Sherlock was alive, Sherlock was
John could not recall what he'd said in response. He supposed it didn't matter. He'd made his excuses and left, had gone out into the rain and walked until a taxi took pity on him and picked him up. And he'd gone home to his quiet little house in his quiet little suburb and had passed out on his quiet little sofa because he couldn't manage to tackle the bloody stairs.
"All right," Sherlock said.
And then he'd inched his hands along the stone mouth, had scrabbled for purchase and finally found a ledge for his feet, had dragged himself up, gasping and bloodied and frightened, and had lain there in the tall grass, panting.
"Tell Sherlock I said hi," Moriarty says, and turns away.
Sherlock chuckled, made a small pleased humming sound, and sagged more fully against John. His head came to rest on John's shoulder, hair brushing up against John's cheek. The smell of him filled John's nose; heavy, smoky, unwashed. Somehow not entirely unpleasant.
He finished the croissant. He did not recall tasting it. His coffee had gone cold.
"Oh," she said, finally. "Oh. That. That would be—that would be good. Really good, John."
"Hm?" Sherlock asks.
"There's not much to mention," he said, finally.
"What? What is it?"
Right now, though, it didn't feel like a problem. Right now, it felt just fine.
and John had known what he meant. He'd known it. And he'd done nothing. Not until it was almost too late.
John had looked at Sherlock, and Sherlock had looked back at him. There had been something in his expression that John could not begin to parse. He'd nodded.
Had Sherlock . . . missed her? The idea seemed too absurd to even contemplate, and yet—
He went down the stairs without looking back, his heart light. Rosie departed Mrs Hudson's sofa without a fuss, a warm sleepy weight against his chest. He cradled her close as he hailed a taxi, and turned to look at the darkened windows of 221B as it pulled away from the kerb.
All around them, the sky is alive. Hail rattles against the windshield.
He sniffed, deleted his text unsent. Put his phone back in his pocket. Started walking. He ignored the unpleasant voice in the back of his mind that said he was still running.
"So sorry—" she said. One of her patients had had an emergency. They'd need to reschedule.
"Oh, don't worry, police are already on their way." Sherlock holds up his phone, then drops it back into his coat pocket.
There had been an ache, a sense of incompleteness, the feeling of something important left unfulfilled.
"She might have—"
"She ruined his life, yeah?" John says, finally. He breathes out through his nose, looks at the ground. "Letting him believe they were happy, and just—running off. Like that."
John's mouth twitches.
"Oh," he said.
There was a creak behind him and John startled, turned around.
