Cas looked down at it apologetically. “Hold on. Hey, Kelly…” Cas’s voice drifted off into a different conversation.
“Home. You and Cas obviously have a lot to talk about in the morning. I don’t want to get in the way.” She grabbed her purse and walked over to Dean. “Let me know when you two figure all this out.”
Dean wanted to smack the smug bastard back to the British Isles. He threw an arm around Lisa. “Someone is just protective of his friends.”
He gently nudged Dean out of the way. “Michael, I have moved on, and I’ve changed. I’m not the same man who would follow you blindly no matter how much you hurt me.”
The boy shrugged. “It happens.” He clapped his hands together. “Now, Sam has an idea regarding Chuck.”
Dean shushed him. “He can probably hear us!” He plopped down at the map table next to his brother. “He’s not happy. Cas isn’t happy. He’s going to leave again. He’s already talking to Jack about it.”
“Yeah.” He led Cas to the stairs and settled against the railing. “No more putting myself in harm’s way. No more trying to save everyone. No more ridiculous deals that just come back to bite me in the ass.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted happily when he saw his friend descending the stairs of the bunker. “How’s it hanging?”
Dean chuckled. “It is for me.” He picked at the label of his beer nervously. “So, Cas, will you go out with me?”
“They call themselves the Gathering. Those woods attract all sorts of ‘interesting’ people.” He threw up air quotes in such a familiar fashion that Sam had to do a double-take.
Dean leaned in and brushed his lips lightly against Cas’s. His fingers danced along the other man’s thighs before they were caught in a strong, confident grasp. Cas pulled him in, kissing him more firmly, more sure than Dean had been.
“Just for a little bit, and it was a straight path with no cars around. Besides, three hours each way is a long time to be driving,” Dean mentioned casually.
“No, I’m not, Dean,” Cas said with a heavy sigh. “Sam is. I accepted long ago that you would always put your brother ahead of everything else in this world, above me and your own wellbeing.” Dean started to protest, but Cas cut him off. “It’s okay. I’m content with what we have.”
“Cas, if you hadn’t gotten them out of that house, they could have ended up dead. That would have been worse.” Dean reached over and put his hand on Cas’s forearm. “I never told anyone this, but my dad was pretty abusive too after my mom died. The minute I was old enough, I took Sammy, and we got the hell out of that house. It wasn’t easy. We lived out of more motels than I could count, but we survived. Now Sammy’s at freakin’ Stanford studying to be a lawyer! They’ll be okay. You did the right thing.”
Dean and Lisa were lounging on the couch together, casually scrolling through their respective phones.
Dean smirked. “I might have had a couple while I was talking to Eric.” He emphasized the name suggestively.
“His mom has this conference, and she didn’t want to leave him alone. I said it’d be okay for him to stay the weekend, but I can’t get Friday off. Jack’s a good kid. You’d like him.”
Sam couldn’t help but laugh. Cas put a hand on his shoulder. “Dean, I don’t think it’s wise to go after three witches for an ill-fated date.”
Then there was Lisa to think about. His girlfriend. His girlfriend who was ready to take the next step of moving in together. His girlfriend who had no idea he had kissed someone else last night. Sure, he could play it off that he was just helping a friend fend off an ex, but Dean wasn’t certain that was all it was. He needed to talk to Cas, and if Cas wasn’t going to bring it up, he would.
Cas turned his gaze onto Dean when he made a quiet choked sound. “Are you okay?” he asked, eyes full of concern.
Dean looked back down at his hands. “Jack, I’m sorry I ever said you weren’t family. You’re Cas’s son. Of course you’re family.”
Dean leaned in. “Well, Professor, why don’t I take you out to dinner tonight, and you can tell me all about the interesting occurrences around here?”
“No, it didn’t,” Cas laughed. “How about that place across from the diner? We can grab dinner there first.”
“You want to see weak?” Dean pulled back his fist, ready to launch it at Michael, but Cas held his elbow in place.
“That’s not the first time I’ve heard that,” he joked. “I’ll be right back.” He gestured towards the restrooms.
The nurse returned, and they loaded Sam into a wheelchair as the younger Winchester protested that he could walk just fine. Dean shushed him and grabbed the handles to push Sam into the hallway. They stopped several doors down.
“Oh.” Cas looked over to Dean, who hoped his eyes didn’t show his apprehension. “Well, that might actually work out for the best. I have an interview for a supervisor position next Monday, but the position is in Dodge City.”
“The way he talks about you, I just assumed you two loved each other.” Jack shrugged as he shoved a handful of cereal and marshmallows into his mouth.
Lisa took in the exchange between the two. “What happened Saturday night?” Dean opened his mouth and shut it immediately, unsure of how to answer her question.
That didn’t happen though. He didn’t get to save Cas. Jack did it single-handedly without even consulting them. He guessed gods could do things like that, even new ones.
Cas froze, his bottle midway to his mouth. “Oh.” He paused. “Is being me an important part of a successful relationship?”
“Lisa is out with her friends, so I want to go out with mine.” Dean paused. “That didn’t sound right.”
“But?” the kid pressed. He picked up a box of cereal as he awaited Dean’s answer, examining its contents.
“Hunters and Men of Letters live in the bunker. I’m retiring.” He held his hands open at the big reveal.
“I ran into my ex, Michael,” Cas told her. “Then Dean made me realize how much I’ve grown as a person since then and that I have to keep moving forward. So this interview is my way forward.”
“If I ever hear you disrespecting Cas again, I will make sure those are the last words that ever come out of your mouth.”
“Sure. I’ll make the coffee.” An awkward silence loomed as they finished preparing breakfast. Cas finally spoke as they sat down. “So… I thought you were okay with me bringing home guys. You made a whole fuss about it being my home as well.”
“Do you see me laughing? I was talking to Jack this morning, and he made me realize that I don’t want to live without you.” Dean looked down at his hands, too nervous to meet Cas’s eyes.
Dean picked up a pair of pants that had landed by the door and threw them at Crowley. “I said get out!”
“Call me,” Crowley purred, pecking Cas on the cheek. He pushed past Dean and waved to Lisa on his way out.
Dean had forgotten about the babysitting gig until Friday morning when he awoke to a stranger digging through their fridge.
He walked her to the door and turned around to face a quiet apartment. He stopped at Cas’s door but stopped himself from knocking, deciding to wait until morning.
“It’s Officer Franklin,” the man corrected. “Please go on into the room. I’ll be there momentarily.”
Cas pushed him away playfully. “Dean, I am not having sex with you while my nephew is staying with us.” The way that he was panting seemed to contradict his words, but Dean wasn’t going to argue.
Dean pointed at Crowley. “You, get dressed, and get out. You,” he pointed at Cas, “we need to talk.”
Dean let out a low whistle as the instructor greeted the class in the front of the room. “I’d like to try him out. I bet he’s extra flexy.”
A third finger shot up. “Then back into town to Lisa’s. That was awkward listening from outside.” Jack shuddered from the memory.
“Are you going to tell me what’s bothering you?” Dean finally asked. “You don’t usually have that bad of judgement.”
“Oh.” Dean turned away, blinking away what were certainly not tears. He was not going to let Cas see him cry.
Sam sighed. “We just have to get past security and find the cursed object before it gets on the plane.”
“Is that the sob story he fed you?” Michael leaned over to address Cas. “You do know how to get someone to pity you.”
“Yeah.” His hand instinctively went to the cheek where the bruise had long since healed. “I saw them at the soup kitchen yesterday.” Dean dropped his fork and sat back, indicating he was ready to listen. “It’s like I took them out of one bad situation just to drop them into another. I want to help people, Dean, and all I seem to do is make things worse.”
“How many times do I have to repeat myself?” Dean slowed his words, making sure Cas understood each syllable. “I want to grow old with you.”
Dean shook his head. “No, this past year. You haven’t been truly happy. I know about your deal with the Empty.”
Dean rolled his eyes. He threw his hands up. “You’re asking that like it’s a tough decision. And if we hate it, we can move back into the bunker, but whatever happens, we’ll do it together.”
They had just ordered a couple of whiskeys when they’re approached by a man with long blond hair and a somewhat familiar face.
Dean popped up and ran into his room. He reappeared with a Walkman and a pair of headphones. He knocked on Cas’s door and shoved the items into Jack’s hands when he opened the door.
“I’m thinking about it. I’m trying to convince this one to move in with me. What are your thoughts?”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean agreed before his brain could stop him. He cleared his throat and changed the subject. “Thanks for getting dinner, man.”
It had been exactly 14 hours and 37 minutes since they kissed, and they hadn’t talked about it. Dean knew this because he had laid awake all night watching the minutes tick by on the clock. Now it was morning, and Cas was just sitting at the table, drinking coffee and reading his book like nothing happened.
Cas smiled lovingly. “I’ll come with you.” He followed Dean down the hall to his bedroom. “Dean, is something wrong? You seem troubled, more so than usual.”
“Zeppelin is best played as loud as possible,” he told the kid. “Keep the door closed too. Thanks!” He pulled the door shut and turned his attention back to Cas. “Now, where were we?”
“Dean,” Sam sighed. “Cas loves you. He just came back from the Empty. Give him some time to readjust and help Jack adjust to his new role.”
“Hey, that one place was Charlie’s idea, and I had fun!” Dean swung back around as their server walked up. “Two steaks, one medium and one rare, with fries and two more whiskeys, please.”
Dean nodded. He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans. “Right. No need to get on the plane,” he assured himself.
“What? What the hell does that mean?” Dean looked to Sam for answers. All he received in return was a shrug.
Sam covered his eyes as Dean shined his flashlight in his direction. “Watch where you point that thing! Anyways, what I’m saying is that you seem to have a type, a certain look that all your dates seem to share.”
“That man gave me the worst case of blue balls I’ve ever had in my life!” he hissed while adjusting himself.
After a quiet pause, the door creaked open, and Dean was greeted by the sight of two naked men. Crowley was on all fours on the bed with a very clear handprint on his butt cheek, while Cas stood at the doorway, condom in hand. Dean kept his gaze up, avoiding a very prominent body part.
“It’s my apartment too. I don’t want him here,” Dean argued. He couldn’t avoid Cas’s stare; looking at the rest of his naked body was off-limits.
The sound of keys at the door made them pull apart immediately. “And there’s my point proven,” she said, straightening her blouse.
Dean sat back, reeling from the secret Jack had just unveiled. Cas had made a deal with the Empty. He had traded his life for Jack’s, but that wasn’t the part that was bothering Dean. Cas wasn’t happy. Granted, it was hard to be truly happy with everything that’s been happening recently - Michael, Lucifer, Jack’s soul, just to name a few. But they’d also had great times snuggled in bed with Cas giggling about Sam wearing a cardigan or planning the next game night. Hell, they’d even had sex since the deal was made, but none of that was enough to make the love of his life truly happy.
Dean brushed his way past his brother and shined his flashlight around the trees. “The man’s got a PhD, and he’s still an idiot! How can you be writing a book about the supernatural but refuse to believe that any of it’s real? We argued for most of the night about the existence of ghosts and fairies and everything else that we’ve literally ganked in the past month!”
“This is me choosing us, our happiness over everything else. I don’t want to die in my forties fighting some vamps in an abandoned barn in the middle of nowhere.”
“Shame,” Crowley said as he got dressed. “I quite wanted to see how that pretty angel face would look debauched.”
Cas rubbed his temple. “I’ve been trying to… nevermind. Dean, you’ve spent the entire day ignoring my calls, and now you just drop this on me. It’s a lot to take in.”
Several hours later, he came home with a smarmy man who made Dean’s skin crawl as soon as he walked through the door.
Naturally, Dean went with the obvious course of action. He let it fester. He let his anger get the best of him, blaming Cas for Mary’s death, for Jack’s death, and finally for Rowena’s death. That’s when Cas walked away from him, and much to Dean’s relief, that didn’t make him truly happy either.
“Cas,” Dean started, raising himself up off the floor to face his lover. He took Cas’s hands into his own. “I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like you’re second to Sam. Maybe that was true in the past, but it’s not true now. I know we’re about to die, but there is no one else I’d rather spend my last few minutes with than you.”
“That’s not it. He hasn’t been happy in a long time. I have to make this right.” Dean dropped his head in his hands.
So there they were together again at the bunker, one big happy family. Cas was seated next to him in the kitchen, one hand rubbing his knee reassuringly. Dean grasped the hand in both of his, needing a physical reminder that Cas was really there. His boyfriend’s attention, however, was on Jack. They were discussing changes they were planning to make in heaven. Dean’s breath caught in his throat. Cas was going to leave again.
“Thanks for that,” Cas giggled awkwardly, sliding back into his seat. “I didn’t think he was going to leave us alone.”
Dean moaned against Cas’s mouth, and his friend took that opportunity to explore his mouth with his tongue. “God,” Dean thought, “he’s good at that.” A spark of jealousy flared at the idea that other men had a chance to experience this before he did. He wanted nothing more than to erase the memory of Benny and Crowley and fucking Michael from Cas’s brain. Dean pushed him back against the couch, taking charge. He kissed the other man needily, nipping at his bottom lip until he heard Cas whimper loudly.
“I don’t sound like that!” Cas argued. He brought the bags of food to the couch and took a seat next to Lisa.
“Is it bad that the restaurant recognized my voice and knew our order already?” Cas asked as he dropped everything unceremoniously onto the dining table.
It had been like any other weekend. Cas had finished an early shift at the coffee shop and had swung home to drop off some day-old pastries for Dean before going to volunteer at a soup kitchen. He had happily chatted with Dean and Lisa as he piled some canned goods into his bag. By the time he returned home, his entire demeanor had changed.
“Good for you, Cas! I’m so happy for you!” Lisa squealed. She pushed herself away from the counter to give Cas a hug.
“We had some things to do,” Dean answered vaguely. He strolled past the other man into the kitchen to grab a beer. He handed a cola to Jack.
Instinctively, Dean grabbed the back of Cas’s neck with one hand while the other swung him around at the hip. He planted his lips against Cas’s, pulling him into a kiss. He heard Michael murmur something, but he just flicked his middle finger up in response, his lips still occupied. By the time he pulled back, Michael was gone.
“You deserve so much better than that guy could ever offer,” Dean said, hoping it didn’t sound too sappy. “Hell, you deserve better than most people could ever offer.”
Jack gave Dean an encouraging thumbs up before disappearing into Cas’s room. Cas led the way into the living room with Dean following cautiously behind him. Cas sat down on the couch, and Dean took a seat beside him. When their knees touched, Cas scooted over in reflex.
“He’s got the personality of a grapefruit,” Dean countered. “You would have been strong enough to take care of the situation yourself, you know?”
Dean grinned. “I love that kid.” He looked back up. “Now earmuffs, kid. Your dad and I have to christen the new house!”
Dean puffed his chest out and took a step forward, pushing Cas protectively behind him. “I’m the man he’s been living with for the past three years.”
He led the angel from the Impala, down a sidewalk, and up a small set of steps. He fumbled with a set of keys and guided Cas through a doorway.
“Oh, hello. I’m Jack.” The teen stood straight up and gave a little wave. He tilted his head to the side in Castiel-fashion with a frown. “You forgot I was going to be here.”
But all that was before they’d gotten together, before he watched in horror as Amara kidnapped and tortured Lucifer in Cas’s vessel, before he’d jealously watched Mick fucking Davies flirt with his angel, before Cas professed his love as he was dying in a barn. Even then, Cas didn’t think he was enough for Dean. The realization made him sick to his stomach.
“No problem. The waitress gave me her number again. I don’t have the heart to tell her I’m gay.” Cas looked down at his burger in remorse. “But these burgers are worth it. They make me very happy.” His lips curled up into a smile after his first bite.
“Freaking witches happened!” Dean dug through his duffel bag furiously. “Witches and mind-sucking demons!”
“But,” Dean hesitated before letting it all out. “It’s in Dodge City. It’s three hours away. He’s going to have to move, and I won’t get to see him every day.” He knew he sounded like a petulant child.
The man peered over his glasses to see the screen. “Well, one of these looks like the Wampanoag symbol for water. Other parts of it look Japanese. It’s hard to find a unifying trait. Is this related to the cult?”
“You talked about how you want to move forward with your life, and I do too. I want to move forward together.”
“Dean, there is something I wanted to ask you, and it might be a bit uncomfortable,” Cas said apprehensively once they were alone.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “They look nothing alike! One had long blond hair. Another had a soul patch.”
He felt two strong arms wrap around him, and he could have sworn he heard the flap of wings moving to encircle him as well. “Dean, I’m happy with you.”
Cas nodded slowly. “Okay then.” He pushed his eggs around the plate before shoving his plate to Dean to finish.
“Cas is on his way home and wants to know if he should pick up dinner,” Dean said, looking up from his device. “Should I tell him the burger place?”
“Dean! I got the job! I can’t believe it! I’m going to see if Naomi will let me leave early so we can celebrate!” Dean couldn’t help but smile at the happiness in Cas’s voice even though the thought of Cas leaving felt like a punch in the gut.
“No, Cas, there’s nothing wrong with the house… at least I hope not.” He took a deep breath. “I was thinking about buying the house.”
Dean nodded, not trusting his own voice. He leaned in to kiss his angel but yelped as he was shoved back onto the ground. He watched in horror as Billie broke through the door, and both she and Cas were sucked into the black ooze of the Empty.
“I know.” They sat silently for a moment before Dean decided to defuse the tension. “You really need a breath mint.”
Cas tilted his head to the side. “How do you christen…” He didn’t have time to finish the question before Dean started dragging him up the stairs.
“Come on,” Dean said, slapping his shoulder, “it’ll be fun. My treat! I’ll even buy you one of those beers they serve in a cowboy boot.”
Cas pulled the cloth down and took in his surroundings. “Why did we break into this house? Is there a ghost? Cursed object?” He spun around, trying to sense any impending danger.
The thought of putting something else ahead of Cas yet again made him nauseous, but Sam was right. No wonder Cas didn’t ever think he was enough.
Dean nodded and made his way toward the tree. “I don’t know what it is, Sammy. Every guy I’m into just doesn’t seem to work out.”
Dean apologized in Purgatory. He prayed like his life depended on it. He had lost too many people. He wasn’t going to lose Cas as well. It didn’t matter; he was going to lose him anyway. He watched as Cas prepared himself to take the Mark of Cain. Luckily, or unluckily, their plan never came to fruition.
Dean caught up with Sam at the edge of the woods that night. He was seething so much that Sam was surprised that smoke wasn’t coming out of his ears.
It wasn’t until they were both about to die that he found the courage to ask. Locked in the storage room, hiding from Billie, Dean looked up at his angel with tears in his eyes.
“Man, we need to stay in these nicer hotels more often!” Dean plopped down on the bed and moaned. “It’s like laying on a cloud!”
“Yeah, his dad’s a coma patient here. We got to talking by the coffee machine, and now I’ve got a hot date tonight!” Dean plopped into the chair next to the hospital bed and started flicking through channels on the TV. He patted the cast on Sam’s arm. “I’ll drop you off at the motel and get you set up with dinner first. When did they say they’re releasing you?”
Dean doesn't want to say what he's thinking. That he's pretty sure he can tell the difference between Cas staring at someone in curiosity and Cas staring at someone because he wants to.
Jack is nodding along with his typical studious frown as Cas talks but Dean is barely paying attention, the words rolling over him.
"I understand. My apologies. I thought because you were staying here, you wouldn't mind. From now on I will always gain your consent to touch it."
He’s leaving. He’s still leaving, he’s turning away and suddenly Dean’s legs are propelling him through the kitchen of their own accord.
Cas’ smile fades as his face turns a little more sincere and Dean wishes he could remember when his face got so emotive. If there was a particular point when he was able to notice micro-expressions like that.
He knows Cas can take care of himself - and the whole of earth too, besides. But something makes him feel a little off at the idea of seeing him walking around alone in an unfamiliar place with weapons.
"I- yeah. Or just, y'know. Dating. All of that. Like Claire and Kaia, right? They're gay. Or lesbian, I guess."
Cas pulls away and Dean feels a longing form deeply and harshly in his throat that barely stops him from yanking him straight back in again. He forces himself to open his eyes, wondering if Cas can see water pricking in the corners of them.
"I know that sometimes I struggle to be inconspicuous on a case. I was wondering if it could be used for networking. That way, it doesn’t have to be spontaneous. You could coach me on what to say."
He hears the water before he sees it – an honest to god babbling brook with a stream running from it out from the trees towards a source of dawn light. He follows the path of water, tuning into the sounds of birds above him and the crunch of leaves under his feet.
“That you, Cas?” The bee approaches him further, maybe smelling the grass on his skin, before flying away in the direction of the stream. Dean watches until it disappears and then feels his smile grow further, self-pitying. “God, what’s wrong with me?” He shakes his head and laughs a little at the absurdity. “Ah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m cracking up. About time, huh? I should try getting some sleep one of these nights.”
Dean thinks about all of the times he’d woken up, in the early days, to find Cas stood over him staring at him intently. Rifling through his bags. Asking invasive questions, with no concept of what humans do and don’t share. It did bother him a little, sure. But he’s used to it by now. That isn’t what’s bugging him.
"Yeah, but.." Dean trails off. He remembers that conversation, somehow. Remembers the feel of Cas' tie in his hands and the innocent perplexion on his face.
"It's a shame you didn't talk to him, man.” Dean breaks the silence first. “I think you should've gone for it."
Sam emerges from facetiming Eileen and Jack traipses after him, leaving Dean and Cas still sat in the kitchen on the same side of the table.
"I'll bet." It should be another chance at innuendo but it isn't - Dean finds himself smiling fondly at Cas as he does the same back.
The sun rises in oranges and pinks, hue spreading over branches and the bare skin of Dean’s ankles as it slowly envelops the horizon. It doesn’t last long before it’s replaced by the light blues of early morning, rays beating down on him.
There's a sudden sick feeling in the pit of his stomach even if he'd seen it coming. He picks up his beer bottle to delay an answer but Cas' voice cuts through the thrumming in his head.
There’s stubble scratching his face and he tries fleetingly to explain away the flushing burn on his skin as a by-product of it, but then there’s a hand riding up his shirt onto on the bare skin at the small of his back and it’s on
They’d been engaged in a hushed conversation about EMF readings and potential demons for the last couple of minutes, and when a bartender approaches them with a drink they’re quick to shut up. Dean thumps his foot against Cas’ under the table.
“Yeah, I think Dean’s right.” For once, Dean is glad of Sam’s eyes on him. “There’s some weird people on those apps, Cas, the last thing you want to be doing is sending nudes.”
There's a strange pause before the word and Dean isn't sure if it's the end of a sentence or not, but it doesn't matter because at that moment the door opens and Dean drags his eyes away from Cas to look at the looming figure of his brother in the doorway.
"Just, y'know. With friends. Or say if.. I don't know, man, remember when we met that dude in that bar who bought you a drink and he made that comment about giving you a bed to sleep in?"
Cas is frowning in confusion and Dean pulls a ‘never mind’ expression, closing his eyes and shaking his head a little. Cas, incredibly given the heat, straightens out his trench-coat and leaves through the open motel room door with a nod.
“I won’t argue. Not now. But I hope I can make you understand that you deserve it. Happiness, peace.. love-” The word has Dean’s mind reeling, flashbacks and heat rushing “– I spent a long time believing I couldn’t accept them for myself. I thought too much had happened, or that I wasn’t built to be capable. You allowed me to think differently. I want you to do the same.” Cas looks down and taps his hand on the edge of the table as though he hasn’t got Dean’s heart in the palm of it. He looks up again and his expression is breath-takingly earnest. “Dean, the things I said barely touch the sides. I don’t know if I could ever put into words the impact you’ve had on me since we met. I just wanted you to understand. I needed you to understand how other people see you, even if you can’t see it for yourself.”
Cas smiles, but it dies again. There's a touch of awkwardness in the air. "Sometimes I forget how young Jack is to be unfamiliar with so much about humanity that I've started to take for granted. You said he'd asked you before about dating."
Besides, Cas is his friend. His best friend. And it isn't like either of them are in a position to start risking those. They basically have each other and Sam.
He can see that Cas is actually considering it and it makes him feel like he’s burning up. He’s not homophobic – he feels a little weird when he thinks about Cas with women too, even when he’d been the one initially encouraging it. Maybe he’s angel-phobic, he tries to convince himself. Except no, he had sex with Anna.
He thinks it sounded convincing. A little fast to respond, maybe, and Sam is giving him a side-eye. But no obvious jealousy or barely-contained lust.
He lets her in eventually and she begins to ask questions that have Dean zoning out, Jake skirting around the topic. Tension gives way to frustration again but then Jake's mom is asking him about his date to the prom and Dean's ears prick up at a silence that follows. When he does finally look up at the screen, it's just in time to hear Jake say the words "I don't think I like girls at all".
said something. He places his fingertips inside and runs the fine dust through them, wondering if its morbid.
“What?” Cas frowns. “That was a kind offer, if a little odd. Do you think it was suspicious? He’s human, but..”
Guys have hit on Sam in front of Dean before. He's always polite, and cracks a joke, and wishes them a good night with a smile on his face. He doesn't get weird or nervous or start stuttering.
He doesn’t say goodbye. He doesn’t make another sound at all actually, until he’s back amongst the trees and a sob escapes his throat.
"Dean told me that for humans it's an important moment when you share your attraction with people you care about."
Dean takes his time, registering every mini-movement of expression in Cas’ face as he understands what’s happening. His hand comes up to Dean’s wrist but doesn’t push it away, rather grips it for dear life as though he’s afraid it’s going to disappear. When Cas’ eyes travel down his face Dean takes it as invitation and closes the gap between them, pressing his lips lightly but surely against Cas’.
"Are refills your personal responsibility?" He knows Cas isn't trying to flirt. He can hear the uncertainty in his voice, almost as if checking if the man has an actual job as a territorial drinks re-filler. Still, the words make him queasy as the man smiles.
"Uh. Good for Jake, I guess." Dean leaves the room feeling irritated and confused, and more than a little swirled in his stomach.
"This seems a simple enough case. I thought I would take the opportunity to practice some of my practical hunting skills. In case there's ever a time I'm without my grace, or.."
Night hunting meant time to kill, and bars were always good for that. Sam and Dean are one beer down, but Cas in true Cas-style had taken a long enthusiastic swig of his when given it and has entirely forgotten about its existence since then.
“Hey.” The man’s voice is slow and a little awkward and he accentuates the word with a look back at his friends at their table. “I’m sorry, my friends were bugging me to come over.”
“I’m still here, though. Just about. Mom’s gone, Crowley’s gone, but we’re carrying on. I feel like I’m going fucking insane but the world’s just.. keeping on turning.” The words feel bitter and Dean runs his tongue over his teeth. “I don’t know, man, maybe that’s not fair. I know I’m not the only one that’s lost you.” And that – that feels foreign on his tongue. He can barely even admit it in his own head. “Sure feels like it sometimes, though. Every time I close my eyes I just…”
"Nothin', Cas. Ignore him. Look, it doesn't matter, alright? I just.. want you to be more careful if you go out hunting on your own. You’re taking my weapon you've never used before as protection."
"I’m sorry, Dean. I can see I’ve crossed a line you aren’t happy with. You're very attached to it, I wanted to experience how it feels holding it.”
Dean can’t remember how many times he’s seen a windmill in real life, but he has to imagine it’s less than a handful. This one is dilapidated and old, wood splintering but bricks fair and sun-bleached. He stares up at the blades, illuminated by some far-off floodlights, wondering how it would look if they were turning.
Dean watches as Cas says something that makes the man laugh, a twinkle in his eye. He forces himself to look away.
“I had no intention of sending anyone nudes, I understand the limitations of undercover work. But I suppose you’re the experts, so I’ll defer to you on this.”
Well. It’s making the things Dean tries to convince himself aren’t possible with an angel less possible to deny.
He checks his phone. 11:37am. 5 missed calls, which he ignores. “It’s not past 12 but you aren’t gonna tell Sammy, huh? Between you and me.”
"Perhaps there's other material that will shed some light." He nods in decision and fuck, it's endearing. Always has been - watching him learn. He's so.. sincere, with the way he talks about the most ridiculous topics. Dean has seen fancy kitchen appliances fascinate him.
Dean brings his hands up to cup Cas’ face around his ears on his neck and jaw, in a way he has before and convinced himself wasn’t ever possible when they weren’t battling life or death. Cas’ stubble is a little longer than usual and he strokes the line of it with his thumb, watching as Cas’ mouth falls open just a touch in the echoing silence.
"I think you're probably right, Cas. See? You're learning." It's practiced kindness from Dean, more a show for Sam than anything else, but it makes Cas preen in a way that makes him feel like an asshole.
The conversation dies but there's a strange desperation in Dean's stomach to find a way to circle back into it. The weight of Cas' eyes on him as Jack spoke still burning. "Hey. Sorry I... uh. I mean, I guess I assumed stuff. Sorry about that."
A couple of hours down confined to research in the stuffy but shaded room, Cas is enjoying his popsicle sat outside the open front door on the wooden ledge that surrounds the building. Dean can see he’s enjoying it, as he's currently inserting the entire thing into his mouth at once and licking along the bottom of it as he removes it from his mouth with a pop. Dean’s watching in utter disbelief as he does so, his lips turning red with liquid and his tongue flicking along them. It's utterly obscene.
Sam snapped the lid of the laptop shut and glared at him. “None of your business.” He got up and shuffled over to sit against the wall.
“You should stop by the nursing home sometimes.” Vicki said, straightening out her shirt. “She always complains that she’s bored there.”
Dean laughed as Thomas finally figured out that he could eat the cake and was now jamming as much into his mouth as he could. The laugh caught in his throat when a shriek filled the air.
Dean hummed and hooked his hands under Cas’ hips, prompting the shorter man to jump up and wrap his legs around Dean’s waist.
Cas was pale as a ghost but nodded. He slowly sat down in the chair and watched as both Dean and Gabriel finished with the clean up.
“Hey guys, we have health codes we have to maintain.” Dean warned as he grabbed his keys from the counter.
“Actually he works at a gay club.” Bobby filled in, watching them with amusement. “I can’t recall the name.” He mused, brain a little foggy from the margaritas. “It’s got the same name as that popular one in Miami.” He shrugged.
“Stop teasing me.” Cas grit out. His hands had moved from the sheets to Dean’s hair, he was probably gripping it too tightly but the other man didn’t seem to mind.
dean sensed his uncertainty and moved them both around so they were in a comfortable position and Cas' hand was resting over the mark on Dean's shoulder.
Steeling himself, he knocked three times on the front door before fishing the key out from over top of the door frame. He opened the door up just as Cas was moving into the hallway.
When the aftershocks wore off, Dean carefully rolled Cas off of him before discarding the condom. He left briefly but returned with a warm washcloth to wipe them down with and a bottle of water, which Cas drank down gladly. “I hope you’re okay with aftersex cuddles,” He said, pulling the blankets over them as he slid in next to Cas.
Once Sam got cleaned up and everyone had a slice of cake, he and Gabriel called Olivia over to help open presents.
“I’ll have the same but with a coke” Dean said, trying to catch Bobby’s eye to glare at him so he would stop analyzing Cas.
Castiel followed him meekly and watched as he dropped the tools on the floor and studied the door. “I hope you know I can’t pay you for any of this,”
“I think I will.” Dean said, stepping passed Cas. The entry hall was small and artwork obviously done by children was hung up on every available space on the walls.
The man nodded and refused to look him in the eye as he pulled up his jeans and walked out the door without a word.
“I’d like to make it up to you.” Dean said sitting forward, glittering green eyes taking on a note of seriousness. “In any way I can.”
He toyed with the idea of going in. After all he was already here and Cas was clearly up, maybe a cup of coffee wouldn’t hurt.
Cas’ entire face sparked with excitement and he straightened up so fast he dropped all his papers on the floor. “Oh!” He knelt down, face right red as he began to gather them up. He chuckled nervously as Dean came over to help. “Thank you,” He said sheepishly as he took the papers. “I have a few things to sort out here but I can meet you at the restaurant if that would work?”
Sure enough Cas stood waiting for him. It looked like he just got out of school for the day, he was wearing his trench coat and was clutching his briefcase, looking uncomfortable and out of place.
“Look, let me explain.” Dean said quickly, holding his hands out in a placating manner, or perhaps expecting Cas to lunge at him.
He pulled the computer out and opened it up, smirking as it whirled to life. He wasn’t worried when the computer asked for a password, that is until Kansas82, the password Sam usually used, didn’t work. He tried a few other options and groaned, thumping his head back against the wall. He looked around the room, searching for ideas. He spotted a picture of Jess on Sam’s beside and he bit his lip. He carefully typed in the name and felt his heart drop into his stomach when it began to load.
Cas was busy admiring the shape of his jawline when he was shocked out of his daze by a nurse slipping a file into his hands. He plastered on a smile and told the man to sit down on the examination table while he slowly leafed through the information the man, a Mr. Dean Winchester, had put down.
"I know it is." Cas frowns at Sam’s words in a way that equally makes Dean want to smile and run for the hills. "Hypothetically, yes. I don't see gender in the same way as people do on earth. I find human men physically attractive. Practically speaking, though, I suppose it's a little more complicated than that."
"Look, I'm not saying give him a demonstration, I'm just saying you should be, y'know.. supportive. Give him basic advice when he asks for it. It's not like he's got anyone else he's interested in, is it?"
Freddy is Jack's favourite character, though Dean doesn't get why. The guy's prickly and a jackass half the time, never saying what he really feels. Jake can do better, actually. He's home-schooled and sheltered, though, so Dean guesses rebellion must taste good.
His mom’s voice calls out to him and Jake picks up his bag and disappears up the stairs before she can reach him but soon she’s knocking on the door and Dean can feel a panic rise in his throat as he watches Jake pace around his room.
." He’s self-conscious and a little petulant and he’s expecting Cas’ eyes on him before he feels him actually turn. Dean doesn’t meet him halfway and so he looks back again at Jack.
“Yes. I don’t have much by way of reference but I think that’s important to me. I’d like to know them down to their soul.”
Dean pulls open his rucksack and retrieves two glasses and the last of the bottle of whiskey he’s been clutching like a life blanket.
is more like it, Dean’s barely able to think as Cas’ mouth opens and his tongue plays along the line of Dean’s own lips, his heart hammering in his chest as he hears a noise in Cas’ throat as he allows him entrance.
He pulls a couple from the branch and places them into his mouth. They’re sharp and bitter, juice filling his mouth spilling onto his lips as he tips his head back. He takes one more, then another two, and feels the wind on his face as the sky changes colour.
“There’s nothing else. We just haven’t talked about it, alright? Maybe I assumed when I shouldn’t have done, that’s on me.” Dean interjects quickly and covers what he hopes will be the end of the discussion. Sam raises his eyebrows and exhales, but doesn’t push further.
"You’re judgemental of media content. Claire says that you use 'classics' as synonymous with 'old'."
“For me, it depends on the overall experience. Just because it’s longer doesn’t necessarily indicate the quality is better.”
. Whatever adults have instead of a crush. But didn't have to mean anything. It was probably natural, actually, when someone spends so long freaking staring at you like that. But it’s not like that has anything to do with Sam. He can’t
Although, the more he thinks about it, the more he realises a lot of the times he could be filling with dates, he's with Cas. Going for drinks. Watching old movies. Those are pretty date-y activities.
"Not in that case, no. But sometimes..” Dean catches his eye again in the rear-view mirror. Cas’ eyes darken a fraction.
"Freddy might not-" Sam just raises his eyebrows and Dean scowls. He doesn't know how he let Sam make such a dumb bet in the first place - he'd only agreed so Sam would stop trying to talk about it. It's TV. What does Dean care who they want to PG-13 make-out with?
“Right. That’s… right, sure. I get it. You could probably do with some more practice at some point, but I’d rather you didn’t do that on your own when we don’t know what we’re up against. Let’s just stick to what we know.”
"Guess not." Dean manages to offer and if Cas is disappointed at him taking the easy way out his face doesn't betray him. It's the closest they've ever come to talking about it - this abstract
A scene at debate club follows which is painfully awkward, Jake and Freddy on opposing sides but both of them refusing to do anything to engage the other. Dean’s getting more frustrated now watching the two of them stare at each other, and in his head he’s questioning how anyone can stand watching them dance around each other like this talking in code.
Sam had pity in his eyes when he said it, Dean remembers. He’d hated it. It felt like a betrayal – some kind of weird form of gossiping behind Cas’ back that Sam could admit that they had something extra beyond Sam that Dean had never once allowed himself to vocalise to Cas when he was here. Because of.. well, because of too many things that he was far too fucked to start to entertain in a meadow at 7am on a Thursday.
"Must be a tight squeeze, all of you in one bed." There's a questioning quirk in the man's eyebrow and Dean feels a little sick.
"Right. But no, he doesn't interest me." Dean thinks for a split second about asking why not. Cas has never actually spoken about what specifically he's into before, and sometimes he wonders... "I don't know him well enough."
Dean nods, and he can feel the faintest of blushes threatening to form on his cheeks again. He swallows a big gulp of his beer and it dies quickly, even as Cas refuses to take his eyes off him.
and Dean feels breathless as he lowers his hands from his face to his neck and then to his hip, pulling Dean sharply against him as Dean’s own hands cup his jaw and try desperately to gain a semblance of control.
This place is nice. A windmill, river and trees, and a meadow alongside a honeybee farm. He can’t think of anywhere else that would make him think more of Cas, actually, but that thought hurts somewhere sharp in chest and he puts it to one side.
"Yeah, I'll bet." Cas tilts his head in confusion and Dean shrugs him off, refusing to speculate on what Cas might have thought he meant by that. "You love that cheesy stuff."
He knows the way Cas acts towards him sometimes isn't how two men act towards each other. But Cas isn't a man, he reminds himself. He's an.. angel male? He isn't sure, to be honest. He looks like one, at least, and for Dean that's enough to sound alarm bells when he feels eyes train on his.
Face wet and elbows on the ground Dean lies down on his back and feels Cas surrounding him – in the grass, in the sun shining on his face, in the wind that spreads him. He closes his eyes.
Cas disappears off towards the bar and Dean watches the back of his head as he stands, a little too straight and poised to be human, and waits to be served. When he returns a few moments later with two fresh beers in his hand, he clears his throat.
"I'm sorry about that. He didn’t mean anything by it. He still isn't sure about the norms of conversation and what is and isn't acceptable to ask."
The second time he'd been in the room when Jack's favourite teen show Raise Your Voice had been on, Jack had turned to him and excitedly asked if he wanted a recap on what he'd missed. He'd looked so innocently thrilled at the prospect that Dean had said yes before he could stop himself. It's a tradition now: whenever Dean happens to be around for an episode, Jack fills him in on all the latest goings on in his favourite fictional high school debate club (seriously). He likes talking about it. No harm in Dean indulging him.
“Don’t give me space, Cas. I don’t want it.” He manages to say though his voice sounds foreign and weird to his own ears, like it’s formed by someone else. There’s that smile on Cas’ lips again and he feels a desperation to say something,
And that.. that throws Dean for a loop. Jack goes back to eating his burger, apparently satisfied, and Dean feels like he's frozen in time for a second. Like he's the only one who heard it.
Considering how long Cas has been around, Dean isn’t sure what that says about him. “Not sure if that’s a compliment or not.”
Cas places the gun into Dean’s hand slowly. His fingertips are warm and Dean pulls away. There’s enough blood rushing to unwanted places already.
“Really, if I’m going to be hunting with the two of you I should be pulling my weight on things like that.”
"So yeah, Jack's here. I guess you know that, though. He's.. well, he's probably a little bigger than you were imagining. And he - he looks like you, actually. Which is-" hard. confusing. gut-wrenching. "-weird. You'd probably get a kick out of it if you could see him."
If Dean looks up sometimes for a couple of minutes when the show gets loud, so what? His body reacts to loud noises. That's just science.
"Are you afraid I won't like yours as much?" God, he must be fucking with him. He and Sam probably planned this.
“What – like having sex? Oh yeah, you’ve never once brought that up in conversation.” Dean makes a half-hearted noise of irritation but his heart isn’t in it. After a moment Sam looks at him more carefully and frowns a little. “Look, if there’s something else-“
Sometimes Cas needs context clues but he doesn't now, that much is written on his face. He knows what Dean is referring to and it sends a familiar white hot terror coursing through his veins as he finds himself desperate to somehow walk it back or leave or otherwise dismiss it.
“Shut your face.” Dean sits back down in his chair, feeling the sweat caked into its back from where he’s been leaning against it. "How in the hell did we get here?"
He begs that Jack's gone to talk more about Jake and Freddy. Serves Sam right, he's the one who brings it up. Dean chuckles to himself.
“Sweet.” Dean nods and tips his head away, running a hand through his hair to try to gain some composure as Cas smiles at him as though nothing’s happened.
"Right. Because the population of men who are sexually attracted to men is significantly smaller than that who are attracted to women." He nods stoically.
“C’mon, he’s a pretty innocent guy. He doesn’t realise humans make everything sexual. You’re the one who always makes this stuff out to be worse than it is.”
"No, I-" Dean interrupts. "I don't think it'll work. It's a nice idea, but I think the way we do things works just fine."
"C'mon. What's the worst that can happen?" His voice is a little coaxing almost and how the fuck did Dean end up in a situation where innuendo laden filled three-way conversation led to this brother telling him to make moves on an Angel? “See you.”
He's glad that, because it's Jack, he moves on without a thought, but Dean can feel the weight of Cas trying very hard not to look at him as the conversation diverts to other aspects of the show and Dean tries to temper the humiliation he feels at the way he'd frozen.
"Dean, you know that I have." It's loaded and there's a quiet almost urgency to Cas' tone. He meets his eye for a long moment. "Sometimes there've been moments when I've thought something might.."
There’s a frown of confusion on his face and in his voice that makes Dean feel a little guilty and he just about manages to push aside a little of his fuckery to respond. "No. Y'know - hey, kid, there's nothing wrong with it. Alright? Nobody should feel bad about it. It's just.. it's a big deal when you tell someone something like that. Jake probably was thinking a lot about how he'd tell his mom and what she'd say, so he was feeling a little emotional. People sometimes get upset when they come out."
Cas is standing in the middle of the room in an ill-fitting sweater and his hair is dishevelled as though he’s been tossing and turning. He looks so unremarkable, so human, so it makes Dean’s breath catch in his throat at the reminder.
The man, James, bends down and writes his number on a napkin that he pushes towards Cas with his fingers. Cas nods and offers a small smile and James looks at Sam and then at Dean, and Dean isn’t sure what’s evident on his own face because suddenly James is out of there as quick as he can manage.
“I’m not gonna make some big speech. Not now.” Not when you’re not here to hear it, Dean thinks, though that’s a pointless exercise because he knows he can’t say it face-to-face now either way. Still a coward, even now. “I just hope you’re alright wherever you are. I hope you’re at peace. And if not then.. well, you’ve got this place.”
“I mean, I guess like you said. Sometimes I can’t tell what you’re thinking. And then you start talking about things that throw me, man.”
"Oh. Really?" Cas looks back over at the table where James is now blushing, any confidence immediately dissipated now he's back around his guffawing friends. "It's difficult to tell sometimes."
“Whatever.” Dean eventually responds half-heartedly, resettling himself in his chair and burying himself behind his laptop screen. “I can’t concentrate in this heat.”
“I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem.” Dean stands up swiftly before conversation can devolve anymore, and Cas’ confused expression only grows. Dean claps Sam on the shoulder. “C’mon, man. Wanna make sure you don’t get lost.”
The motel is right across the street from the bar, and Dean guides Sam outside and points him off in the direction of it.
"Alright, well. Rule 1 of online dating. Never use a blank profile. That's what people do when they wanna invite you to their houses to eat you."
He pulls the second glass from between his legs and tips it up diagonally, watching drops of the liquid land across the grass.
"C'mon, Freddy, man.." Dean finds himself saying under his breath as he watches the boy stare at Jake through a windowpane, new girl hanging on his arm.
"Yeah, I.. uh. We were talking. I just covered the basics. Sorry." How the hell does an angel know more about humans than he does?
It's a hot day at the end of a hot week at the end of a hot month. Days had stretched out endlessly and Dean had been thanking their lucky stars once again to have the bunker as a home base. Travelling is torture, endless stuffy motel rooms with broken air-con leaving them ratty and exhausted.
It’s the first thing Dean’s said since he sat down. The first noise he’s made full-stop, barely able to breathe. His voice sounds strange and sharp against the sound of the stream and the birds and he shuts his mouth again.
He opens the box and looks at the ashes. Sam hadn’t said a word when he’d found him on his knees collecting them, which had somehow been worse than if he
“I can give you space to think about things if that’s what you want. I know I’ve put you in a difficult position.”
Dean stays for a moment watching Sam cross the road before heading back inside, feeling alcohol start to fuzz the edges of his own head.
It’s the truth, in a way. He hasn’t thought about it. Dean's made it his responsibility before to try and hook Cas up with a girl, and part of him deep down knows that his motivations for that are fucked up on ten different levels but it's different contemplating Cas with a man.
"I'm just asking, that's all. Or maybe I'm telling you that it's.." Oh god, Sam's about to tell him it's OK to like men, isn't he?
"I assumed it wasn't my place. I may not know much about romance but I do understand traits like tact and empathy."
“OK. Good. I was worried that after what happened things might be weird between us, but I suppose that’s unavoidable.” Cas pulls a face that’s a little self-deprecating.
“Honestly? I’ve never believed it. I don’t know why you give me the time of day half the time, man. And you don’t have to.. argue about it, or anything. I know you want to. It’s just how I see it.”
"I don't understand why he doesn't ask Jake why he's upset." Dean can hear the frown in Jack's voice as he muses out loud.
"It's- yeah, it's not as common. You don't meet as many people who are.." Dean doesn't know all the words and god where's Sam when you need him? Or hell, Google? "-Who aren't straight. So it can be a big deal when you tell someone. Especially because you don't know how they're gonna react."
Gabriel was nowhere in sight which wasn’t a surprise. But at the counter, watching the older woman walk out the front door with mild shock, was a very attractive man in a tan trench coat. His black hair was tousled in the perfect “just had sex” look and his sun-kissed skin was smooth and flawless. He turned to look at Dean and the taller man nearly gasped when he fluttered his baby blue eyes and smiled a pearly white smile.
Ty hummed and nodded. “Been close with him ever since Benny moved to this area. Can’t remember how they met but he’s a good kid. He’s one of those bisexuals though.” He said with a shrug before chuckling.
The blond haired thief from before strolled in, carrying a red cooler. “I was half way through getting your groceries when I remembered you didn’t have a refrigerator, so this will have to work until we can score you one.” He explained before setting it down on the table that the two had just placed in the center of the room. And just like that all three of them left.
Dean briefly explained how he had met Bobby, omitting certain details of course, and apologized for his weird behavior.
Cas walked over to him and handed him his glass before turning to the cupboard to retrieve a glass of his own.
The door opened a few minutes later to allow in a shockingly handsome man with shaggy blonde hair and the brightest green eyes Cas had ever seen.
“Don’t act like I don’t know what you’re doing,” Gabriel snarled. “You’re only doing it to get back at me for dating Sam!”
Dean watched as Cas mixed two spoons of sugar and a dash of creamer into the #1 teacher much. He was so touched that Cas remembered how he liked his coffee that he didn’t have the heart to tell him that he started drinking his coffee black years ago.
Cas had stopped by after school that day to see if Gabriel was there, then told Dean that the other man hadn’t come home Wednesday and he wasn’t answering his phone. He didn’t seem too worried. Then again, he said this wouldn’t be the first time Gabriel had a fit and dropped off the map for a few days.
He didn’t come back and Dean was fuming for the rest of the morning, cursing Gabriel both out loud and mentally for ruining his good mood with his stupidity and leaving him alone on one of the busiest days they had in a long time.
“Its fine,” Cas said crawling up beside him, depositing the bottle of lube and the box of condoms on the bed next to him.
Dean was panting heavily and his cock was twitching. “I was going to come,” He said once he caught his breath. “Didn’t want everything to end too soon.”
When Dean didn’t respond, Bobby thankfully dropped the subject and slapped a few pancakes on his plate and told him to dig in.
“We were just talking about our sons, is all.” Rowena said shifting to lean away from Ty and towards Bobby. “How are Dean and Samuel doing?” She said with a hum. “I know Samuel was interning under my Fergus for a while. Is he still in law?”
“Enjoy your date with my brother yesterday?” Dean asked, tugging off his leather jacket and hanging it up in his booth. He pulled his keys out of his pocket and made sure that his Impala was locked.
The man gave him a very odd look before smiling tentatively and adjusting the strap of the briefcase he had over his shoulder. “Hello, I’m Castiel. Gabriel’s brother?”
“It’s Gabe’s brother,” Dean said, before responding to the text. “I said I’d do Career day thing down at the school.”
Cas frowned and took in Dean’s appearance. His hair was disheveled, his face was pale, he was shaking, covered in a thin sheen of sweat, and he looked more terrified than Cas had ever seen him before. The only good news was that there was no visible injuries.
He recounted some of the hunts he went on, he told them about how he went to hell although he omitted certain details, and he told them about the fight, John had caught him with one of his partners, a black haired, grey-eyed beauty that was notably of the male persuasion.
The other man went red and nervously ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry, I jus- Well, I thought that maybe… I’m sorry I must have read you wrong, I thought you might be interested in…”
Ty hummed, a commercial break had begun so Rowena had his full attention. “Naw. Doc said Benny couldn’t play anymore after he got injured. He did open a restaurant though. Nice Cajun restaurant. It’s doing really well. I’ll take you there sometime if you want.” A grin spread across his face. “We can share a milkshake too. Just like old times.”
Dean sighed and pulled away from Cas. “I’m going to kill your brother.” He said as he made his way over to Sam’s room. “Not if I get to him first.” Cas grumbled, answering his phone. “What did you do now, assbutt?”
Ty seemed pleased with her answer though as he flashed a toothy smile and continued. “It’s amazing what that boy has done. You know he made so much money off of that restaurant that he bought his best friend’s favorite bakery so his friend can have all the pies and baked goods he wants for free.” He laughed. “I don’t even get to have any for free. Benny even jokes that one of these days he’ll start charging me double.”
“Yes… I wanted to get it for you and… Well… I didn’t see the security guard behind me and… they booked me.”
Chuck let out a laugh. Much too boisterous and far too long to be appropriate. “They must be pretty close then.” He remarked picking up his new drink.
“I think it’s time you got undressed,” Dean said, pulling at Cas’ shirt. “Better yet, let me help you.” He flipped them so Cas was on his back and he was hovering over him. Within moments, Cas had been stripped and Dean was swallowing down his cock like a pro.
Dean laughed before sucking down his length once more, slipping his finger out to get more lube before pressing two back in.
Cas was about to retort when Dean finally walked out of his father’s quarters, looking relieved, the king trailing after him.
Dean paused before slowly setting down the items in his hand. “Last time I saw him he made it pretty obvious that he didn’t want to see me ever again.”
“No!” Cas shouted, gripping his hair in his fist and tugging. “I can’t believe you’d do this to me!”
"Very well," Cas said hesitantly. He made sure that Dean was safely back into bed and under the covers before heading for the door. "Sleep well, Dean." He said before clicking off the lights.
He sits down and adjusts his chair a little so they’re not awkwardly crammed into one side of the table. Just a little, though – not enough to take them out of each other’s space. "Look, the uh.. the stuff before. That was a joke. I was just messing with you."
that causes Dean to always be the one to look away first and to bolt at the first sign of a conversation like this. "Should probably go and warn Sammy that Jack's coming round with questionnaires."
Dean’s hands drop to his sides of their own accord, suddenly absolutely terrified, but Cas doesn’t move away in return. In fact, he brings his hand to Dean’s cheek and Dean’s sure he must look like a fish opening and closing his mouth in stunned silence before suddenly Cas moves in to kiss him again, other hand coming up to grab his face and hold him in place as his lips are ferocious and impassioned against his own.
"Light in there's good for reading. Kid follows me around." It's an easy excuse, pathetic and transparent and a little mean actually but it makes Cas duck his head with a smile all the same.
It's a risky question even with the clarification tacked on the end and Dean is sure Cas must know that. Of course he's... thought about it, but he's never
"Some people, they think that.. their God, the God that people pray to, they think he says it's a sin."
The kiss slows steadily and then all at once as Cas’ lips lighten against his, and he feels him exhale against his skin in a release that Dean himself is desperate for. He knows it’ll come, eventually: in every moment he allows himself to open like this, touch on his skin making him feel alive.
‘Last week’ meaning when Cas had got himself into trouble with a particularly determined group of demons, and Dean had felt his heart leap into his mouth for a split second as Cas got thrown against a wall before he managed to smite the first couple and Dean and Sam took care of the rest.
"I will let her know that Dean and I's friendship does have some benefits, but not of the type she's referring." Cas points to the laptop, where Mila and Justin are in bed.
It's quick and without hesitation and he hasn't thought it through but maybe that's a good thing in the circumstance.
"Maybe." Dean looks away to drink but Cas keeps looking at him. "Sam told me that perhaps there were other reasons for your reaction."
“I know exactly what you are, Dean.” The words are clear and sincere and Dean wonders if there’s anyone else in the universe capable of arresting him so simply. “I’ll leave you to it.” Cas eventually nods at Dean’s breakfast and smiles, dipping his head as he starts to leave.
He can barely look at him, if he’s being honest with himself. He knew he’d find it hard because of who Jack is but he didn’t expect that added dagger, driving deep into chest when he looked up and saw the kid tilt his head in confusion.
“Message received.” Dean responds like a fucking asshole but Cas smiles all the same, warm and knowing and in a way that fills Dean with the relief of being understood.
"I'm not sure. But I think the theory is that you have the casual sex without the romantic feelings."
Dean would never tell him to his face, but in the last episode he'd been around for he could see where Sam was coming from. He's not intending to give him the satisfaction any time soon, though. Nor Cas, who Dean never asked for his opinion on the matter but also never spoke up to take Dean's side, rather looking at him with a judgemental flicker in his eyes.
have a mini-freezer. Sam had gone out for lunch earlier and came back with a pack of half-melted popsicles that Dean had fallen on like a child. They’d put the rest away to re-freeze, but found themselves back at them an hour later.
“I like them.” Cas says simply, a smile at once transparent and unreadable taking over his features.
He’s sitting now between Dean and Sam at a table a little too far from the bar in the only joint in town that was open at this time on a weekday.
He knows Cas is comfortable on earth but it still feels like Dean's domain. Cas is a visitor, after all, and he doesn't know all there is to know about humans. So yeah, maybe he's a little protective.
“Don’t apologise. That’s – god, that’s the last thing I want. I’m just.. trying to get my head around it.”
but now he's looking at him like he's trying to gauge his reaction and Dean doesn't know what to do with his hands.
“Mine. Alright? You don’t need it.” His voice sounds sharper than it should and he feels guilty but turns away anyway, opening and closing the chamber a couple of times. Awkward silence stretches out.
He claps his hand on Cas' shoulder and feels like an asshole for it so he lets his hand linger for a moment. That feels even more absurd, so he retracts it entirely. “I’ll try to be less confusing in future.”
He returns to the table with trepidation, tuning into the conversation as early as he can before arriving. He gets Sam a refill too, because he’s trying.
Because.. he hasn’t been imagining it, right? He can’t excuse it anymore. Not now that fact is out in the open. And maybe there
Dean lets himself in through Cas’ open bedroom door with curiosity. Cas is watching something on a laptop with a typically inquisitive expression.
"That makes sense. I downloaded it to investigate and a lot of the men seem to post pictures of their torsos."
about it, and it's one thing to barely allow himself to wonder only for him to come out and say it one day.
The bartender nods disinterestedly and leaves. Cas looks at the mystery beer with a frown, and then up at Dean.
“Yeah. I’ll bet.” Dean smiles in what he hopes seems supportive and not at all pathetic or guarded. It seems to satisfy Jack either way.
“A lot of the time you do sincerely confuse me with these references and innuendo. But recently I have been.. confused about other things when it comes to our interactions. For a relatively simple species, you can be impossible to understand.”
He closes them now and sees him. Shadows of wings behind him in a disused barn. Smiling at him on the side of a highway at night. Blood pooling from his mouth as he begs him for his life.
“I can’t believe he’s wearing a full suit and coat in this weather. There’ll be people in bathing suits on the street. What happened to him trying to blend?”
"OK." It's a small word but a smile is playing on Cas' features. Ice broken. Just like that. "You know I'm not exactly the expert in these things."
Dean knows they’re both right, but the thought still turns his stomach. Usually he’s all for planning for worst case scenarios, but that one puts him on edge.
Jack is silent at this for a moment, and when he does speak again his voice is quieter. A little sad. "Castiel told me that the human God is loving and cares about people. That it's OK to let them believe that. Why would humans want to believe in a God that says things like that?"
"It’s pretty simple, I think, Cas.” Sam cuts in with a little interest in his voice. “You set parameters of the type of person you're interested in, and then get shown people that fit them in your area. So like for me, I'd choose women between the ages of.. say, 25-40. But it’s totally up to you what you want to see. So if you wanted to just see.. men over the age of 70, for example, you could pick that.”
"What-" Dean leans forward and moves the mouse to check the title. "Claire told you to watch Friends with Benefits?"
Cas continues looking at him until Dean can hardly bear it. He looks away. Cas stands up. Dean doesn’t look back again until he sees him walking across the room towards the table.
Cas’ hand emerges from the duffle bag holding the gun and he runs his fingertips over the barrel. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the motion, subconscious movements, before approaching him and holding his hand out.
"It's because Jake is gay." He levels his voice carefully, thankful for the briefest of seconds that having an angel as a dad means Jack isn't always entirely in tune with human emotions.
Dean just about managed to avoid choking on his burger, patting the centre of his chest all the same as he looks across the table at Jack. He doesn't look at Cas' face, sat next to him, but he feels his leg shift.
He feels heavy all of a sudden, his breathing increased from standing up, and he takes a couple of deep breaths to try and settle himself. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
“I don’t know if I’d say ‘weird’. I can’t pretend that I haven’t thought about bringing it up in the past.”
Cas tilts his head in fascination as they kiss. Dean gets up from his bed and pushes past a guffawing Sam.
And god, he wishes Cas would stop doing that. He knows, really, that it's a normal thing to ask. Friends ask each others’ opinions on dating all the time. So why does it feel increasingly
There’s something growing on green leaves around him and he stretches to pull a branch towards him. It’s blackberries, he thinks, then wonders how ashamed Sam would be if he knew he wasn’t sure.
"I thanked him for the drink but said I'm having a 'Boys Night'." Cas looks delighted with his memory of the phrase, air quotes included, "-with my friends. His friends suggested that was what James was interested in too but I suspect they were talking about a different kind of 'Boys Night'."
They’re two hours into a seven hour car-ride, and suddenly Dean wishes for nothing more than for Cas to do one of his sudden disappearing acts.
"Oh yeah, and it was prom last week. Freddy took the new girl Sophie and they kissed and Jake saw them and then he left upset."
"Sure. Yeah. You protect people you care about. You never think.." Sam goes to continue and then thinks better of it.
Through the trees is a clearing, and in the distance a meadow runs down a small hill. He pauses in front of it, looking down, and thinks this is the spot.
“Thank you, Cas. Thank you for.. every single damn day.” He lifts his glass towards the sky, before downing the small measure. It tastes dull.
“It’s certainly not helping make this any easier.” Cas talks as he re-enters the motel room and for a brief second Dean’s heart is in his mouth as he wonders how much else of the conversation he’d heard. The popsicle stick is in his mouth and he pulls it out, assessing them quietly with it for a moment before placing it in the garbage can below the desk by Dean’s feet. "You should stay inside in the shade, I'm going to head out again."
why is there a lump in his throat? “It means something. To me. It means a whole lot, actually. Maybe if it didn’t it’d be easier to talk about. There’s stuff that I wanna.. stuff I need for you to hear. That you deserve to hear, when I get my head out of my ass. Because I don’t feel like I deserve any of that crap you said to me, but you deserve to hear things back.”
Before Dean has time to react properly the man is coming over to their table and fuck Dean wishes the ground would swallow him up. Quickly, preferably.
