“No trouble at all, Dr Watson. Actually, since this is your daughter, we better not confuse the little girl too much. If we’re going to have regular meetings, I will get to know her and you too, but let’s establish this. May I call you by your first names? It will be easier for us, but her most of all. You can call me however you like and Rosie can call me however she likes too as we go on. Doctor Chloe or just Chloe or Miss or anything, I’m okay with most.”
There’s gentle pressure against him. Soft tufts brushing against his temple. “I forgive you…” Sherlock whispers, lips against John’s ear. Leans into him. Just as surrendered, and weathered as John is. Taking refuge. Trusting. Melting the last of the ice away, into spring.
It’s John through and through, seething, more beneath the surface than over it. And yet it’s rough and undefined all over. A molten mass. Sherlock dislikes it at once, what has John feeling like this. What stands between John and his daughter, John and his recovery.
Somewhere downstairs, water starts to run. Sherlock going for a shower probably. John’s smile is slow as he starts humming with her. He takes the small, child-safe hairbrush from the bedside table, slowly combs it through her tangled curls. She doesn’t even object. She’s just humming, looking at the point her fingers are clutching at his chest. The teeth press between curly locks and separate small knots of sweat from the last two days. They’ve been thorough with cleaning her up and keeping her healthy, but they couldn’t risk a bath with the fever and the chilly weather outside, making the inside more difficult to warm up too. They’ll be certainly giving her one tomorrow. In the meantime…
Sherlock rolls his eyes in agreement and is about to turn the screen off, when a weird curiosity gets the better of him. He sits back in his armchair, with his free arm bracing around his ribcage to ease the movement, and checks his messages. His lips are pressed, pulled inwards a little, his forehead creased. Turns out there was no need to be prepared; nil. Zero. Nothing at all, an empty list, save for one unread and unanswered ‘good morning’ from a few days ago, when John blacked out at breakfast. Sherlock huffs.
But he wasn’t trying to hide it anymore. ‘Was he? Is he?’ He has opened up now, let John help… ‘Truly?’
Now Rosie threw an arm around his neck and fought to climb even higher on him, as if to reach his shoulder. He balanced her on his other hip and the movement offered him her forehead. His lips pressed against the reddened, hot skin, and kept moving, shushing, murmuring. His left hand was shaking as it reached to card through the golden curls.
Sherlock does not try again. John is panting. Standing over ruins, the ruins he created, the ruins he deserves. And then he looks up.
He watches the way Sherlock holds her; different than his own. The way he strokes her hair, pats her back. John observes for the first time this rare occurrence that must happen every day when he’s not home. He realises little by little how much more Sherlock knows her, understands her. He has been her main caretaker for the better part of a month and already knows everything there is about her. John remembers all the times Sherlock has given him a full report of all her activities throughout the day, his tone indicating that nothing was amiss, so much that John didn’t even register the fact that Sherlock knew everything because he did everything with her. John has been thinking of him as Rosie’s family no matter what, but hadn’t actually attributed him all the credit he should get for it. He remembers Sherlock’s young and childish face, all bent on the mission, the work, the next case, chase, the new puzzle, in search of a higher class of criminal he could take down. With a pang of unexpected pride, John realises just how much the image differs from this new, a few years older, countless painful mission later Sherlock. How much Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective, distant, cold and unfeeling could change and mellow through the years. Or was it just the resurfacing of his actual self what was happening…?
Sherlock kisses Honeybee’s forehead again. Her skin feels like a pebble burned by the sun against his lips.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock lowers himself beside him, eyes narrowed. Rosie’s bag, a thump, as he places it on the floor.
“Good. Listen, I am sorry to call on such short notice but I’ve been called for a conference after Thursday and I won’t be able to make it for our appointment.”
“Ah... sorry... um.” John regrets his defensive tone. “I mean, we mainly talked through my own feelings on the matter. My thinking process and guilt... inadequacy as a father and-” He stops.
Sherlock sets out to prepare breakfast for all three of them, indeed at first reaching for coffee when it comes to John’s mug -and tutting to himself for it.
). Honeybee, too (why would she miss someone she has barely known?). Their worlds will keep spinning. They will forget (and replace). His world has come to a screeching halt and exploded, and now there is only particles floating in the space of his mind, echoing when they clash. He’s only a junkie, anyway. (Freak). Still looks like one. (Will never not carry the marks). He can lie here for as long as he wants, nothing will come of it.
“Yes, Rosie?”, Sherlock responds without missing a beat, now on his armchair-sofa part of the route.
John is frozen. Because Sherlock is having bad nights. Sherlock is having dreams. Sherlock has trouble sleeping and John hates the fact he can’t -for the life of him- think of a single thing to help him. Sleep medication strictly not allowed and all kinds of restrictions and tips of how after addiction the body needs to find its own rhythm again, floating hatefully through his mind.
“Oh god, thank you… Thank you…” John closes his eyes, and leans against the wall for support. Relief, pale green and blush, emanates from his body.
“I want-” John cuts in. Wrong turn. Stops. A deep breath. What to say? And how to say it? The words are tangled up in his throat, his thoughts are a network of dead-ends.
He stood on a ledge. The ledge. Cement one. High up. At least the stairs weren’t for nothing. He panted in smoke, choked, breathed, fell.
There’s fire in his head and he can’t put it off. He tries, yet again, but it persists. Anger, it’s called. Hot, burning, consuming anger. He’s on his own. Hopeless. Helpless. A mess.
Every time John is home, Sherlock retreats, leaving them father-daughter space -or so John supposes. But still, it’s a weird kind of retreat, one that feels forced and accepted at the same time, one that speaks volumes. John worries and he knows, whatever this is, he needs to fix it. They need to. Sherlock is her godfather after all and above all else, he’s family. Rosie’s little family. She’s going to need as much as she can get.
A mug, salvaged? No, cracked. The army one. Of course. Plate, chipped. Toast crumbs, everywhere. Everywhere. Too many. He pulled the edges of the cloth together in a bundle, tossed the whole thing on the table.
They are shoved and prodded, and John is now beside him. Sherlock cannot physically turn so that his eyes can remain locked on him and has to stare ahead to a random point. There are murals and posters on the curved walls, for musicals and ads, and the fonts and colours coil and hiss into his mind. Other, other, he needs to find something else. Breaths flocking in his throat, he looks around him. Lady in the pink hat. Pink... Pink... Baby pink? Blush? She has golden earrings... And... Is that... Is that a promise ring? Heavy makeup. Is that contour?... Where did she come from? High heels. So... not much walking? Her stride is small... Not used to them? Hurts? Uncomfortable? Her dress is ironed... So that means... That means... Other, other! That man in the tuxedo. Tuxedo. It's barely nine forty. Then... required by his job? What job requires the employees to wear a tuxedo? This early in the morning? Maybe an important event? This early in the morning?! Can't be going far -has he sweated? What if he has, if he hasn't? His hands are smooth, so not manual, but then can't be... Can't be... He hasn't shaved! He... He's... His hair is... matted... at the back of his neck, so... Improper grooming? Rest is polished. Someone matted it -no, he did? Other! Focus! ‘Don't be stupid’. That woman in black! Widow -no. Lipstick. Adulterer? What? No- the boy in the uniform. Easy –‘come on Sherlock!’ Which school? Where? How far? 'I don't know'. Stupid. 'I don't know!'. Stupid. Other! The girl the man the one in the green shirt no the white no the tie why too young too old office worker what rank what company don't know stupid don't know don't know don't-
John works his jaw, eyes slowly opening. Harry is shaking, so pale that her make-up shows now, even more ridiculous than before. She’s a leaf on a tree in autumn and the first wind has just blown. John is sure he is mouthing Sherlock’s name, his lips barely moving. He can’t move. That was it. The ace up Sherlock’s sleeve. Yet, it sits wrong, and it’s not because John didn’t want him to push to the offensive with that furious energy that made Sherlock who he is but because he hasn’t seen him do it for months and now he’s scared. Scared of the consequences. Of Sherlock’s wellbeing. Because there must be a reason he hadn’t. There
John muffles his pants, face buried in his duvet, teeth biting his sheets. He’s trembling, aching and the night is quiet again. Oh, so quiet he might cry.
He woke up later than he usually would, to find that he had forgotten to set an alarm. His phone vibrated again instead, and he blinked before he groggily reached for it. The screen popped to life.
He feels Sherlock take a shaky breath. John pulls back enough to look at him, truly look. Sherlock casts his gaze low, hiding its light away. ‘No…’ Two fingers under his chin and he guides him to bloom again, to let the bright skies of his eyes free.
Rosie’s wails can possibly be heard through the whole building. He tries to brush her hair, give her reassurance. She flinches away.
John is already up, shaking his head, enjoying the protectiveness deep down. Oh, his overgrown child genius will never get old.
John looks up. The scents of fresh breakfast and tea have brought some semblance of colour on Sherlock’s cheeks, although his voice is rough with disuse. He’s pleased to note the dark cloud hovering over his friend’s eyes has eased. He just looks tired now. Resigned.
“Don’t worry about it.” He pauses, pursing lips as he examines his handiwork, straightening up, hands on his hips. He must make such a sight. He ducks back into it.
He had not expected John to be angry or harsh, because he knows this is not who John is. John would take care of him, would help him calm down -he had done so just a few days ago, when he had panicked about Honeybee’s fever. But John cradling him, softly, ever so softly…
John hums and points at a man fifty yards away, changing the subject, wanting to keep Sherlock talking in that sweet way he does when Rosie is listening, using multiple words or expressions with the same meaning, so she’ll get the childish gist of it all however she wishes and won’t ever feel left out. He’s like a proud sycamore tree animated by heavy wind, it’s one and only love. Tall and strong, at the mercy of the weather’s wishes for when he could have his lover back, ready to be made to dance.
“Mm? Yes.” Sherlock’s arms rock their little girl up and down as his head tilts to her for some small encouraging coos.
Sherlock’s hands don’t move to hold Rosie into them. She’s thankfully so deep into sleep that she doesn’t know or see what’s happening.
Everything? Together? Friends? Whatever way Sherlock wants them to be? He doesn’t know. He doesn’t even know if Sherlock will understand his meaning completely, but he wants to try. Deep down he always wanted. He wants Sherlock to know him. To have him. He’s got a second chance. He’s not screwing it up.
John sweats himself to wakefulness. Uncoordinated legs try to untangle from the duvet. His breathing is erratic and he curls into a ball once again. The clock on the bedside table showing the date and time punctually. The 17
And they leave the cosy space as Rosie waves excitedly at her new Doctor and Chloe sends her kisses at John’s utter shock and amusement and Sherlock’s highly raised eyebrows.
“You and your big brain”, John repeats, chuckling. “I only meant that whatever you need… I will help with. If I can, however I can” He smiles reluctantly.
The cupboard hinges creak, glass chinks against glass, and then a thud. The tap running. Silence. Not for long.
Again, that knowing look. The same one as when she saw him dancing alone, almost three years ago. When she saw him give the best man’s speech. When she saw him return from John’s house, the day Molly told him John would rather see anyone, anyone but him.
“I let her sleep without it. I put it in the washing machine this morning. After you called me.” Control. He needs to have control. Regain control.
John serves their food, pleased with himself, ruffling Rosie’s hair and hums their little melody as she keeps waving her spoon around like a proper little maestro. ‘Look at that!’
“I would offer tea.” He gestures to the kitchen. “But I believe the matter at hand is of the utmost importance, isn’t it?” His head tilts an inch.
His eyes travelled from his daughter -on the floor where he’d just left her, his face covered with the baby food he’d tried to wipe from her hands-, to Sherlock -on his armchair, phone in hand- and back. Both sets of eyes averted their gaze; again.
Sherlock’s head snaps, surprised at being addressed. John turns, securing his baby girl on her baby seat and she pats his face in a playful manner, trying to get a hold of his nose. He lets her, getting down on his knees to accommodate the angle, and she squeezes his nostrils closed.
Sherlock’s throat is clogged. It is only the first bite, and he feels like choking.  He swallows, and his stomach lurches, but he does keep it down as he tries for the second bite. John is still looking at him. Sherlock shifts, exhales, reaches for the chamomile. It scalds his tongue, jerks his mind awake a little more.
There’s a gasp and a click and he doesn’t hear the ignition but he’s sure the gun has been fired. He’s not the receiving end anymore though. There’s someone jumping in front of him. Tall and thin and skeleton-like but strong enough to catch the bullet in his chest a second time.
“Hm…”  John is biting his lip. Sherlock’s eyes remain on him, like a caress. John takes a deep breath, his chest puffing. “I loved them because… I could lie down without thinking of… without hearing
“I’ll get the ice then.” John declares after a moment of silence. He rushes out of the room, rubbing a hand to the point of collision with a final ‘ow’. Sherlock has already taken over Rosie’s care inside the humid bathroom and John’s heart flutters at hearing him all the way to the kitchen, as he opens the fridge, takes two bags of frozen peas and slowly walks back. He pauses at the door when hearing Sherlock’s voice.
“I would never believe I deserved it. Not one bit. I would only… I would only think you… you believed you deserved what happened, what I did to you. I knew I couldn’t live like that. I didn’t want
That was what Sherlock expected, nothing more, nothing less. That was not to say he would be prepared for it; he had come to understand that in the matters of John Watson, he never was truly prepared for anything, after all. But at least it was a familiar scenario. He would know how it would feel, broadly speaking.
!”, he exclaims with a loud ‘boop’ kiss to her nose. She giggles and boops him back, and he is already up again, in a flurry of messy curls and blue dressing-gown, rummaging the drawers of the desk for something to write on -something must have survived Mycroft’s stupidity in this house. “Eureka”, he grins, pulling out a journal with John’s initials embossed -routine gift from the clinic for the holidays, most probably, to note down appointments and the such. Finding a pen is easier -Mrs. Hudson keeps some in the top kitchen drawer for her crossword puzzles.
Honeybee babbles the way she does when she wants to call him. He hurries to her side, presses a kiss to her chubby, pink cheek. She shows him the new tower of blocks she has made -four stacked this time- and the more he stays the more he is absorbed, until they’re playing together. He hands her the blocks and she stacks them, starting new every time a little tower topples over. Every time she points on the numbers or letters on the blocks and he names and pronounces clearly for her.
does.’ This should not be happening this way. Everything that could be true and beautiful was marred. Every kind word and glance made Sherlock feel like the executioner, smiling sardonically over John’s suffering.
“You two will be alright, do we need anything?”, he asks, and the way he does it is so casual Sherlock could get used to this.
Honeybee again stops babbling when she sees her father; but does not pout this time. She is holding her elephant tight in her arms. John reaches to brush her curls away from her face, and she pushes the elephant against his arm. Sherlock stays still, as if careful not to scare a feral cat and her kit when they are trying to accept each other again after being contaminated with human contact.
He has stepped down the stairs without noticing. His nails are digging hard into the tapestry of their corridor.
Sherlock places them on the table. Harder than usual. John isn’t sure if it is because he couldn’t hold them longer or on purpose. His voice was deeper, harder when he spoke. John’s hands have already withheld back to his sides. His fingers are itching.
Sherlock shudders, and the grip tightens in response to steady him. His bandaged hand stings from the cuts, his head hurts, his chest heavy from breathing so hard. John is ever there, ever his soldier, his shield, his anchor.
John does never want to let go. But of course, there comes a moment when they have to. There comes a moment when John has to give up this warmth, this feeling he’s like in a bee hive and there is honey dripping all around him, all over him. So he steps back. He lets go. But he hopes… dares to hope… it’s not going to be for long…
“She thinks any symptoms must be due to some psychological response. But she will need more appointments to make a more informed judgement”
For a moment it all stops. It is the moment where the roller coaster ride has reached the highest point and is preparing for the plunge. It crashes down on him; the sound of his heart, his lungs, his thrumming veins. He gasps, scrambles for a way out.
Shivers run down John’s spine and he holds Sherlock tighter, closer. He would do anything… anything at all, to maybe one day truly deserve this. To keep his promise. His own vow…
There is one... two… No, three thuds -something being unloaded onto the pavement from the boot. Then silence. Sherlock tilts his head to the side, lingers with one hand on the staircase's handrail. A door closes, and the engine revs again. Now there is only the mysterious passenger and his cargo across from him, out onto the street, hidden from view.
“Breathe… Breathe, you git, I can hear you thinking”, John chuckles, and it’s white, and honey-gold.
John tries not to look at any exposed skin, to note at the paleness of pectorals, the hairiness -if any- and the colour. He tries and he doesn’t succeed. Sherlock has unbuttoned his pyjama shirt halfway to let Rosie rest her head over his sternum. Her blankets are untangled, covering both of them, keeping them warm. John can see him breathe with every melodious small hum, can see the lines of his ribs, can’t help but note that his nipples are covered with his shirt’s edges and that Rosie is covering most of the soft auburn curls of his sternum.
little flower, taking a midday nap. John’s hours don’t agree too much with hers but he means to amend that the soonest possible.
Jacket off his shoulders, he takes the few steps up the hall, hangs it on the peg outside 221A and takes a tentative step to the door.
John prepares their dinner with his thoughts running rampant like the free willing horses of old times in the grass planes of the world. Rosie hadn’t always been his first priority. When he learned of her existence he could only think about how and why. When he swallowed that down, it was only concerns about his own life and the changes he needed to make to accommodate a child. Then it was all filtered through her mother’s actions. He wasn’t sure when he finally let himself feel the least amount of love he could spare, closed off all the rest far away, deep inside. He wasn’t sure when that love bloomed and when he managed to treat her as his own child for the first time. As he should. He was sure of all the times he blew it all away however. His memory was perfectly accurate of all the moments he disappointed her, let her go, didn’t make her his first and foremost goal and priority… He’d like to think she had been now. For a while. But what if he’s been starting to get distracted? What if…
He reads again. Tries to feel the words as if they were touches, wonders what they would be; a hand brushing on his, a soft caress on his cheek that wouldn’t mind the stubble there, a gentle kiss on his forehead. John’s words. Words of praise, happy words, caring words; saying he is glad to receive the photograph, that he is proud, asking about how Sherlock feels. Sherlock imagines the words like a soft summer breeze, like gentle afternoon sunlight, and lets them wash over him.
John startles. Sherlock has left his plate on the tray again, his leg twitching. ‘Christ, I’ve been making him anxious. Fuck.’
John sighs, then inhales, sharply. He can’t let this end here. They can’t just… agree to disagree. They need to solve this. Somehow.
“I don’t- think so. We did run full tests at her birth. And she understands what we’re saying and when we refer to her or call for her.”
It all brings him too close to darkened swimming pools and memories of flickering betrayal in stormy grey eyes. The following recognition and then overflowing fear, cutting in soft blue hues. Devotion. Given. Unconditional and never-ending.
Eventually all their belongings gathered, all their lives packed away. John called the cabbie, feeling like doom itself. Didn’t even say goodbye to the house he -mostly- shared with his wife and daughter. Three boxes. Two suitcases. The cabbie gives them a sour look but doesn’t mind. They get in.
Sherlock tries to look away, lest he reveals too much, but John’s gaze keeps him in place, taming the frightened side of him.
Sherlock blinks, then realizes John is referring to his gelled and styled curls. Them being ready, which he always leaves last in his morning routine, signifies he’s done with his turn in the bathroom.
It is structured as a safe place, suitable for children, schools close-by, amusement parks, a health centre and metro just minutes away from the whole area. He could get a job easily. The pay would be good. The lifestyle better. The air smoother. Their walks longer. Easier. He would have more time for Rosie. Wouldn’t need to leave half an hour earlier due to commute. Would be home early, have more open and cheaper choices of where to do the shopping, maybe find fresher fruits and vegetables and a wider variety of local products.
Sherlock blinks slowly, his head tilting a little to the side before he speaks, as if John has his full attention. Like it used to be. But then Sherlock looks away again, as if he’s stopping himself from something, and the indifference returns.
“Yes. Yes, I… I suppose you could phrase it like that, if you want”, John huffs a small smile. “Of course it is fine if you say no. Totally fine. I promise”
John presses the dressing on the wound, starting from the middle of Sherlock’s palm, down to the tender skin just below the thumb. A small wince. John keeps steady, eyes on his work.
“You are free to do as you wish, of course. But having said that, I also need to tell you that you don’t make a shit-show out of anything”
He had not stayed up all night in the kitchen for John to find him. John had found him anyway. It was sudden; he was drowning, and then there was a raft, and it guided him to gulp for air and wade to shore. The clouds, the hamster-wheel of thoughts, they were still there, gnawing at him until he was raw. But it was two realities at once, as if his mind was torn in two: one half trapped in the whirlwind of fear and doubt that told him the man in front of him would be better off if Sherlock was dead, the other half reaching feebly for help.
A door is opened and John has half the mind to let Sherlock go through first, his hand outstretched behind him; instinct in case his friend needs a gentle nudge. Where were the times John was trying to catch up? The times Sherlock always strode forward in exhilaration?
John turns around, then. Slowly, his eyes narrowed in surprise, perhaps in a newly-found discovery. Sherlock greets him with a small smile of his eyes. “What about the other things?”
Sherlock is afraid; it just takes a wrong step. But then again, he has taken many, and there was no reprimand, no abandonment. Perhaps this could be the same. This is a responsibility he is not just allowed to share, but wanted to share. And it is Honeybee, after all. Honeybee, and the pleading, deep-sea eyes that turn tranquil again with his reply.
John had stood with his hands on his hips, puffing out constrained breaths of air. His left hand was coiled into a twitching fist, and as he had sniffed, the lines on his forehead had deepened. Sherlock berated himself over having done all the washing up and tidying; he should have known John would need a let-out. “Tea?”, he had asked, persuaded it was pointless. But John had nodded, and gone about making tea the way he always did, efficient movements, and standing on tiptoe lastly to reach the sugar.
John was handed Honeybee to put to bed, and Sherlock made the table, opening the cartons to curiously peer what was inside. His stomach growled with curiosity at the spicy, rich scents wafting towards him.
John must have felt him, because his shoulder-blades curve inwards, his spine arching above the sink. Now he is all cornered animal.
Then he steps away to let them have their moment, stealing a glance when Honeybee giggles with a kiss on her cheek.
“Thank you”, John sighs, body sagging with relief, letting go of tension Sherlock would never have known was there. And then John leans forward, until he can rest his forehead on their entwined palms.
“Yup.” John sets to work, first of all getting the little only slightly miffed sunflower down from his shoulders at which movement she squeals. “There’s some mail for you on the table.”
Sherlock looks down at a Honeybee securely strapped on his chest and can’t hold back a smile. She looks up, as if she has felt him looking at her, the back of her head pressing against his sternum. He smiles more.
Sherlock’s toes are flexing under him. He kneeled to reach John and now stays there, by the fire, sitting on his heels, enjoying the extra warmth, feet spread behind him, curled to maximise their heat, soles wrinkled by the position. John can’t help but look. Look and think. He wants to look higher, pass the affection into something else in its entirety, brush his gaze over the curve of Sherlock’s thighs and behind resting on his calves, the way his dressing gown is engulfing his thin waist, leading to a muscled torso… He wonders if Sherlock would ever look at someone that way, mapping every muscle and bone underneath clothes… if he would ever look at- ‘Ahem.’ Seriously, how could Harry think- ‘Oh fuck it…’
If there’s one thing John knows by now, is that Sherlock will never let Rosie be hurt. Whatever his decision will be regarding yesterday, Sherlock will always be there for her and John believes it, knows it, wants it, hopes for it. Even when he wonders if this is enough, if in a couple of months Sherlock would want to run around London chasing criminals, John can’t ignore what he has seen in Sherlock’s eyes when he looks at her. So, it is indeed no surprise the way Sherlock looks at her now and the way he responds with a definite
Leaving the tray at the kitchen table, covering the plates with a tea towel to keep the food warm, John manages to drag his unwilling body to the corridor. A closed door is all he can see. Definite. Exact. Precise.
“It had leaves and black spots and I couldn’t let her keep it with her of course, I needed to clean it up and make sure she’s-” He stops himself. His pulse is thundering.
it. At the very least it hides the circles under your eyes, how tired you are. You are not used to the high-class profile demanded of you, but you have no alternative, given the massive debts you have accumulated over the years. I suppose this alone would be enough to make you just as unfit as a candidate by the social services, don’t you think?”
“Why don’t we start with what’s easier? I understand no information is mundane concerning one’s child but, please, John, try to start with easy, small, mundane facts anyone could know.”
John watches as he gets up and settles Rosie with an extra blanket at her small portable bed they kept in the living room. He goes to stand beside him, stiff and remorseful.
“Feeling any better?” Sherlock’s tone is sweet like honey, deep like a double bass and tentative like the first bird to break into song every morning.
John places the tray on the table and goes to sit beside a bundled-up Sherlock Holmes, bare toes huddled under the edge of the blanket, pushing out to steady the fabric underneath his soles. John smiles with private affection, itching to touch and hold, steady Sherlock’s shivering body against his own and shoo away whatever ailment plaguing him.
That kind of love. How could this be love? How could this be anything? They’re broken. Oh, so broken…
“What is your name? I can let him know you’re here… Though I do not think the boys were expecting anyone-”
John doesn’t know why he repeats himself, needing to check this is still real by hearing his own voice, not knowing what else to say. Posture defensive and closed off, it’s obvious even for the stupidest man to realise Sherlock is bracing. He doesn’t want John anywhere near him, especially in a private space that is his room.
“Sherlock? Was just wrapping things up with Ella” He sounds calm, casual, even. Oh god, how is he going to tell him? “Is everything okay?”
He scoops up some of the cream in a bowl, finds a green baby-safe spoon, and sits on the chair beside Rosie’s. “Time to taste-test?”. He places the bowl and spoon in front of her. She eyes it suspiciously, but her puffed up cheeks make her pout; a hungry hawk chick. Demanding. He can’t help but smile, as she clutches the spoon, and brings a small mouthful to her lips for a catlike taste-lick. He waits past the necessary stages of making a face, whining, and then licking again, for a second try, his head pillowed on his forearms against the kitchen table. “Hmm… Not good?”
John pauses, closing his mouth with a click. Reconsiders. How could Sherlock have any fault in that? After all, even when he got tense and angry, it wasn’t Sherlock who triggered it. He leans forward, patient. His rational thoughts scream danger. Sherlock believing in his moral code, his noble-ness, whatever, so much to think he deserved a beating, to think it was his fault every time John got angry- John shut the thought down. It was dangerous, yes, but Sherlock would see, right? He would understand.
John wants to. Sitting beside him, he wants to run a finger over those lines, understand their architecture and strength and grace. Instead, he speaks.
. A confession of weakness. A recorded video of a dead person. It was all a problem now. A virus. John’s knowledge. It didn’t match well with avoidance. It never could.
Rosie's body is still, except for the quick tempo of her breaths, little baby-bird chest fluttering against his own.
John wonders. He wonders where Sherlock’s violin is stashed. He wonders if Sherlock has tried, if he feels his hands are steady enough, if he hated himself for not being able to play all those months, to practice, to compose. He wonders if he will play again, if he will fight past the barriers of being rusty, if he wants to. He wonders and he hopes... Hopes to hear those notes again. Floating in the air. Brimming everything they touch with emotion. Maybe he could ask... Maybe for Rosie... Maybe a lullaby... Maybe just to see those shoulders curve just so, shirt stretching as the virtuoso hugs his most precious possession close, places the bow with an elegant hand, and sways...
He whirs around and rushes to her, transferring the precious wailing bundle to her. And then finally collapses on his armchair, pressing the heels of his palms in his eyes. “Could you please… take her… for a moment…”
Words. Repeated so many times. Bitter acknowledgements of the world he was living in. With that deep voice. Undoing him from the inside.
John opts to open the door immediately at Sherlock’s whiny voice coming from somewhere closer to the floor than he’d like.
hurting you. I hurt you. Right now…” Now surely… Now is the time Sherlock will see reason… It’s obvious. Hurting him; that’s all he can ever do.
John stands with a small grunt, begins to gather their plates. Sherlock reaches a hand to stop him, but John grabs his plate anyway. “It’s okay. Tomorrow’s your turn. You look tired today. Then it’s evening pills and sleep. Will do you good”
And what threatens John is the word. The notion. The world’s notion of the word. The world’s notion of who John is, every time he could accidentally be seen as
Two mugs in the sink, the sounds of someone else sharing the space and the silence. But the more they share it, the more they drift apart.
The singular reply. Even if there was already a half-finished mug on the coffee table. John hadn’t stopped to look. All he truly remembers now is the glimpse he got at the tensed up, long figure, contemplating him knowingly. Was it hurt he saw? Surrender? A posture suggesting the simple fact the owner had given up on life itself? John pushed it all away. Yet again. Coward.
He tucked his hands under his thighs, childishly. When he realised, they came to rest on his middle, self-conscious, fingers tangling together as if in prayer. Imitating casual.
“Oh”. The waitress looks from John to Sherlock, and back to John again, as if she were given a riddle she needs to solve. Sherlock can almost touch her moment of eureka when it arrives. “
And then John seemed to reach out. To care. It gave Sherlock hope. Perhaps, with time, things could be better; the silences could be bridged, the words be less restricted, the deep-sea eyes sometimes dance his way. Then the things, the not-good things Sherlock had done, could stop to matter so much; he could be worthy of something, once again.
His chest opened up free at the pride he suddenly felt pooling in. Pride in himself. For once. Even for just a tiny moment.
He feels that gaze on him, and yet it does not make him shiver with the ice at its core. There’s an intensity to it. It’s Sherlock looking, seeing, observing. Looking to deduce? Something’s off? John almost smiles when he registers Sherlock’s perseverance as the confusion it is. Sherlock looks away, lips pursed in a way that might indicate a bitten off smile or anger; both.
His voice struggles to break through the blockage at the root of his neck, a prisoner rattling his chains, throwing his body against his cell walls. The gates of his eyes remain closed. There is an acid pool in his mind, thick liquid like milk. It drowns any thought that dares approach, throttles it in its abyss-like deep. It has spread over his body like a blanket, and as if in hibernation, Sherlock is trapped into the lull of its familiar humming, familiar, sweet siren’s song.
He settles Sherlock against the headboard and checks his pulse. Two fingers against warm skin. He prefers to do it on his neck, so he can at least look in his eyes and make sure. Silent diagnoses fly inside his mind but he doesn’t pick one. He can’t possibly know the whole experience of being Sherlock Holmes, not until Sherlock communicates again, but he knows it is mental. John knows it’s something that could have happened to him as well. PTSD patients usually have some kind of unresponsive behaviour, phasing out, closing off. John had been one of the lucky ones where adrenaline gave them life. Others might have ended up empty and numb for the rest of their lives in order not to feel it again. They have to check this out later, but for now all he needs to do is snap Sherlock out of it.
At first, he had doubted John moving back signified anything much at all – at least not with regards to himself. John had given him no indication he wished their relationship to mend, at least a little, towards what it had been five and more years ago. And as much as he was willing to take John’s presence over his absence, even on these terms, it turned out to be impossible to bear. Sherlock could not keep his strength from ebbing from him, bit by bit, from finding it weakened every morning. The drawn-out silences, the bitten off greetings, the punctual avoidance the deep-sea eyes subjected him to. It hollowed him out like an old, gnarled tree-trunk.
It rings, once, twice. Keeps ringing. Sherlock is sure that he should probably hang up and wait for John to call him back, when John picks up.
! Sherlock, who let his chances pass by one after the other and doesn’t care. Sherlock, who is meticulously stubborn on not having any emotionally charged human contact at all. Frankly, John was sick of this. He couldn’t let him do that anymore. So, he told him so. Multiple times. The damned genius just wouldn’t listen.
John doesn’t want to intervene. As much as he tries to avoid -and he doesn’t even want to try- there is affection rising in him. Affection at what this man will put himself through just to make sure of Rosie’s wellbeing. The always energetic, when upset or anxious, Sherlock has lied there, still, to help a sick toddler sleep. It feels too perfect a moment to break. He has seen him help Rosie sleep like that before but now his expression is simply too open. Strained by worry but overflowing with love as well. ‘Oh, Sherlock…’ They are both lucky to have him…
"It's alright", he adds, almost cooing, when little Bee complains and tries to shift again, not finding comfort in being held like that.
Nappy change and morning bottle all done, she nestled into his arms, eyelids droopy with exhaustion. At least her temperature was lower, thirty-seven point three. Sherlock could only hope it would stay low, and not peak again. Every time her small body was wracked by a sneeze or a coughing fit, he ached with the frailty of her, with how delicate she was, all hidden away in his arms in search of comfort, and warmth. He held her head in the cup of his palm, guiding her to rest it over his heart, hoping this could calm her even now.
John takes the duvet over Sherlock’s shoulders with a gentle hand. It doesn’t really make a difference; Sherlock doesn’t reach for it or grip it tight. John folds it lower, taking in Sherlock’s skeleton form, only in his too big now striped pyjamas. He makes sure the tray is secure and sighs, heart aching.
“Papa is okay, Rosie”, he murmurs into her ear. There has been a major change in their lives, and she needs to be updated on it. “You will see him tonight, I promise. He is working on getting better. It will be alright soon”
“Don’t we want to know what are malamutes bred for, little love?” He teases her, arching an eyebrow when Sherlock doesn’t chime in at once. She raises her head, lips pouty in concentration, trying to follow the exact meaning of his words, suspecting a trick by the playful tone of his voice.
A lean and a tug and John stretches as much as his body allows, tiptoeing, bringing both palms to frame Sherlock’s face and… he’s there.
“That’s the reason I am asking this now, John. You have stated before again and again how Sherlock helps, how he thinks you’re doing, how he encourages you.”
The first gulp is a burning hot snail of lava down his throat. He raises his glass to the barista in mock-gratitude. He’s been a regular to this particular pub, one road away from Baker Street, just enough reassurance that whatever happens he might actually make it home.
The water stops. Cut off. A tap turned off. John is sighing into a peace that would soon be broken. By his mind.
John shivers. Sherlock is always there, unwavering, supporting, believing. He already believed John is that man, that soldier, brave and facing up to what he’s done. And John did it. He is doing it right now. Proving Sherlock right. Sherlock already believed John was the man he deserved. All along. Always. No matter what.
, he will never deserve Sherlock’s acceptance. No one would accept anything from the man that almost killed them in an anger fit and that’s that.
-To anyone who cannot relate/understand out of personal experience/expertise/general knowledge (and that's alright!); Our Sherlock has depression anxiety, panic attacks -and a number of other things (see tags). More details in later chapters, obviously. Just to leave this here for anyone wondering why the heck his POV in this chapter makes no sense (because it will be a long way in the story until what Sherlock feels and struggles with is named)
She’s unphased by his tightly closed knees and tense arms. He’s sitting as if on attention in front of a high-ranked officer.
He laughs, once. “I bet.” He rubs a palm to his face, then tangles his fingers over his chest, sinking in his chair.
“Sherlock. Me. Him. I mean like… I can’t-” His eyes well up. He can’t. He wants to. But he can’t. There’s a knot on his tongue, not letting him say it. Not aloud. Not to anyone. Certainly not Sherlock. Or maybe only Sherlock?
My beta saved you all from a potentially heartbreaking cliff-hanger so give them some love. (I [@angel-loving-star] wanted to stop at the knife falling so... yeah, I imagine you owe them if you've reached this point down here ^^)
When John trotted down the stairs, they resumed their positions on the kitchen table, the ones they had that morning and the previous night -and many years ago, for every single day. John pushed a container with sticky rice and steamed vegetables his way, light enough for an abused stomach. Sherlock found himself smiling.
). Right. Any medical personnel that meets him have that tendency, it seems. But there is something deeper than aches in his bones. Even when these let him sleep, it is the nightmares that punch him awake. Nightmares in the form of a void. And these have been left where they are for a very long time.
Sherlock has pushed them to the point from which there is no return. But that’s exactly what now makes him take a step forward. And another. There is nothing that he has at stake, anymore. He may have lost John. But he cannot let John be lost.
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest, but is silenced when John actually takes a hold of both his legs and repositions them over his thighs. “There”, he seems very satisfied with himself. “Stubborn git”.
John nods. Sherlock has forgotten a trembling left hand at his side. John takes it in his. Feels his pulse with two fingers at his wrist.
John rolls his eyes. ‘Come here, you git.’ He pulls him in, pulls him close, presses a kiss over the curly head, totally incredulous by the turn of events, squeezing tentatively until Sherlock grumbles and pulls away free.
Rosie left a small sniffle escape the quiet. Her screaming had stopped. John’s hands were coiled at the sink -white, white. A sink brimming with more things broken.
Sherlock is suddenly welcomingly present in the moment. He’s leaning back again, more relaxed, brushing a palm over Rosie’s forehead in soothing motions. She whimpers but with a look at him and a gentle prod and tickle of her chin, she opens up to receive the rest of her spoonful. John breathes in, grateful, and fills the spoon once more. It’s comforting how they exchange emotions and roles with complete synchronisation and as it’s best needed without even talking.
He needs a distraction. Anything to get his mind off his useless self. Off the people he is disappointing. Over and over.
He wants to say it, to tease him, to joke, fall back into their playful banter of the first years, the first oh so perfect moments of their ‘association’ as he liked to call it in his own writing. For him, as he quite realises now, better than he did before, it was affection he was trying to mask under the formal title. Love. His knees creak when he gets up to gather the shopping back to a decent state.
Surprisingly, they both look up from their plates at the same time, both thinking about little rose, peaceful in her cot. John smiles and gets blinded. Because Sherlock’s answering smile is small but powerful. Bright like the sun. Or as he would say if ever commented upon:
“So…” Sherlock can imagine her animating her words with gestures as she speaks. John’s will be still; one framing the side of his face with index and thumb, the other a fist on his lap. Harry’s voice, when neutral, is not unpleasant. It almost seems like a higher version of John’s voice in its softer tones. “I believe there has been a number of misunderstandings between us, John. I am genuinely worried about you. Since Mary died, and since that scandal in December…”
He goes out a moment later, giving John some more space to manoeuvre as Rosie kicks and grumbles with his ministrations to get her clean and ready. John is surprised Sherlock didn’t stay to fix his hair, he even seemed to have forgotten, calm and peaceful even though he had to chew his pills today. ‘Look at that…’ John smiled. Their Sunday had been well judged to be spent in Bake Off marathons and relaxation.
John’s shoulders snap back, as if Sherlock had gotten a hold of them with his hands and yanked them back himself. The only response is a growl.
my, my those chapters are getting longer :P how do we manage to follow our decision not to cut important scenes but end up with clifhangers anyway?
“Here. We better wake her up for a moment. She needs to take this. As soon as possible.” John puts the ibuprofen on the table, their gazes catching. He contemplates. “How long she’s been sleeping?”
Sherlock helps her out of her chair and walks beside her, as she trots to the fridge, drawing in one hand, pink stuffed elephant clutched tight by an ear in the other.
The words stuck. Deep. Twisting in his chest. It hurt. His shoulders fell, but he kept a straight face; glaring. Brow a dark line over his eyes, jaw clenching. He turned to the sink, plates falling from his numb hands in the semi-cold water. His fingers managed to curl on the cold edge; tight. What had he done?
They fall into a companionable silence again, the songs and judging continuing in front of them undisturbed, images flashing and flicking through the screen in various colours with red in the lead as the show’s logo, reflected on the wallpaper, making it seem burned. They are shifting closer together and by the end of the night, knees and shoulders so close to brushing... Only a single pillow stuck between their hips as if to keep up appearances.
But the way John’s eyes had crinkled when he said how he wanted to care, how it had not been pity, how he asked Sherlock if he remembered… Sherlock had seen the chance, the answer, and grabbed it, and held on for dear life.
Sherlock’s fingers, now resting at his thighs are starting to shake. John blinks and makes to reach again, like they both had done once, keeping their trembling hands together. Sherlock buries them in his dressing gown with unimaginable speed, looking pale, eyes flickering from John’s hands to his face, then all around the room, blinking as if trying to block out the light, as if adjusting his focus, as if everything is too much to handle right now.
Rosie coos and stands, her pink elephant plushie held tight to her chest. Sherlock can’t help but smile, and gets up. “Good morning, Honeybee”. He walks to her, lifts her up into his arms with a grunt at the strain. Her laughter is worth it, so he spins her around until he is dizzy and panting, and has to sit on his armchair, and clutch her tight to his chest.
He awoke with a start, Rosie whining persistent in her cot. John got himself up, sweat trickling down his spine, legs tangled with the heavy double duvet he used with hopes the weight would be enough to keep him in dreamless slumber for as long as possible. Reaching for her, he was blind, his vision blurry, making out only the sun-kissed curls of her small head in the dim light.
This time around there was darkness. Void. He blinked, passed a palm over his eyes. No difference. John’s body was numb. Restrained. But free. The sensation all too familiar but there weren’t flickering lights or echoing emblazons around him. Just a veil of thick black.
We are sorry for taking a while, but we had told you it was a difficult period for both your writers. Good news is, we are settled now,and going back to weekly updates (same day as always, Thursday).
This chapteeeer. Easy peasy. Pfff... no, seriously, this chapter goes a tad darker. Just a tad. Not too far. Just heed the warnings dear wonderful readers and you'll be just fine ^^
“We must have set a record” John snorts as he leads the way out of the bathroom and into the kitchen. Honeybee begins to mouth at the lapel of Sherlock’s dressing gown.
“Sorry. She’s been-” A trembling hiccup. “-not sleeping well…” John says anyway, a nervous smile making his lips slant sideways.
He knows bits and pieces from random conversations of course, but there were mostly about past cases, no clues on how Sherlock lived back then. What brought him to want to move at that particular time, for example? Besides, it would be impossible for John to remember them all. A plus would be that John has met Sherlock’s immediate family. Most people haven’t. But still… He didn’t even know his birthday up to a month ago.
Blue. A sea of blue. With not much to see inside of it. Not now. Not ever again. Broken glass. The once sky blue of those eyes in front of him now broken to pieces with such proximity. Precious stones. Sapphires with faces of colours. There’s teal and indigo, warm and welcoming. But no… now most of it all has turned an icy arctic. Lifeless. Beaten. Dead.
“Want to play? Mm? Where’s my girl? I’ll catch you!” John sing-songs, as he pretends to fail to catch Honeybee in his arms. She giggles and runs in a circle around his legs, convinced that he truly isn’t fast enough for her.
The disappointed hum is just so innocent and pure that John can’t stop a soft chuckle from escaping. Sherlock has overworked his mind with anxiety about such simple matters before. John, knowing him, lets him rest quietly as they watch Rosie play across the room. He can’t think, for the life of him, why would Sherlock react in such a strong way about the small penguin. It is usually far above him to worry about how someone or something should be appreciated and loved, or that’s just what John is used to expecting. Because now, Sherlock’s delicate fingers are clutching the little plushie tight as if holding on to life itself.
as Honeybee grew up, and if then she could perhaps feel it too. If being here with him helped John as much as John being here helped him.
He is standing in a hall. Three walls are still left standing, but the wallpaper is torn and hanging off them, tattered. The spiral staircase with the wooden, carved banister ascends to nowhere; the ceiling has collapsed, and he can see the crumbled walls of the floor above. There is no roof above him, but no sky either. It’s dark, and whatever light reaches eerily from above is white, hospital-like. He looks and looks, the muscles of his neck straining and sore, but the more he does the more his eyes travel aimlessly upwards without finding beginning or end.
Sweet peppers and onions, paprika and coriander, sizzling chicken and a lemon cut at a corner, the garlic gloves at another, thin tortillas on a plate. Sherlock cooking, preparing their dinner. In his own words
John’s fist rises, just a little, but then just rests on the counter without force. “She called. When I was finishing. At work. She’s mad. Mad that I live here, mad that I’m not letting her see Rosie”
He calls John. A message would possibly make him more anxious, and at this state, Sherlock would never know what to write anyway.
Sherlock shakes his head, not comprehending. Refusing. Denying. In vain. “No. You will not do it and I won’t let you. John. Listen to me.” Sherlock reaches a careful hand.
They stay silent, two companions contemplating the coming nightfall. A streetlight outside is sending its yellow light inside their windows. The weather is frosty, more than expected in the middle of February. The heat is on high in their bedrooms but the living room was always a bit lacking because of it being connected with their kitchen. Only one heater couldn’t do the job. Especially, when they leave the door to the corridor wide open. John finishes his lukewarm tea first.
anticipate. It was a why about himself, not about Sherlock. A why that kept nagging him, teasing him at the corners of his vision. A why that grew bigger every day his nightmares lessened. Every day he sat in the kitchen with Sherlock long before dawn; looking.
A waitress brings their order, at long last. Sherlock looks away, on instinct and habit both, in anticipation of the smile John will flash her, the innuendo-filled comment.
The elderly woman walks closer to them, her arms crossed in front of her body. “Who was that rude woman asking to see you yesterday, John?”
It has been a good day. For all of them. Despite Sherlock’s and John’s early start due to nightmares and insomnia. John catches another glimpse of Sherlock’s gaze drifting towards them. As soon as their eyes meet, it’s gone. Instead, Sherlock appears to examine a point on his screen with intense focus, but truly... John can’t be fooled like that anymore. Not when it comes to Rosie. Certainly not by Sherlock. The man has always been practically smitten with her. It is a wonder John has managed to ignore it before…
Molly’s message still hurts, the words angular and steep. Sherlock lets them cut through his skin, and this time, pass through him, and let only him remain.
He was not planning on telling him up to now anyway. Tonight’s confrontation with Harry, and what Sherlock heard because of it, do not change that.
He gets up, sweaty. He has let his mind wonder too far, too quickly. Brushing a palm over his hot forehead, John tiptoes down the stairs, throat parched for a glass of blessed water. He serves himself in the dark, gulps it down and breathes, standing there in the quiet of late night.
Cathartic. His entire chest roars with life, with colour, with joy so sharp it feels like pain, relief so overwhelming his knees go weak.
“Time and careful planning. Never put yourself through too much at once. Take a step back, you can spread everything out as much as you need to. And if planning is too much, if you are overthinking, I’m right here. Sherlock is there too. You can ask for help.”
Honeybee giggles. The moment is broken. She runs to hug his legs, both arms thrown around his knees.
deserves her. She deserves a big and happy family. She deserves so much John knew he could never give. Since the beginning.
It puzzles Sherlock how John learned to be like that, so soft and gentle, if he had no one to show him how. Of course, he is like that with Rosie only, and being a parent is supposed to have the ability to change a person in ways Sherlock would not know. But still. John is, broadly speaking, a man of action, decisions, bluntness, matter-of-fact and potentially coarse with everyone else. Not that John Watson is not a man that never fails to surprise him. But it is a rather remarkable transformation.
But noble as it may generally be, in its wish to make things better, John’s responsibility hurt. Being ignored was straightforward. Being pushed away, denied, the same. Not-good. Wrong. He could be those things. He could bear it. But being treated as a living reminder of failure, of a situation in need of a fix-up, was worse. He wasn’t even not-good anymore. He was a means to an end. He might as well have had any name, any shape, any face. And so he had none.
. Sound asleep against her father's chest in the baby carrier, all bundled up in a little fuchsia coat. Short sun-kissed curls a little riot on her head, small chubby hands curled into tiny fists beneath her chin, dimpled cheeks a lovely shade of pink. They're closed now, but Sherlock knows her eyes are bright and big and blue, like a clear morning's sky. She whines at something in her dreams, and her little button nose -the exact tiny replica of her father's- sniffs like a rabbit's. Sherlock’s brain whirs.
He put his phone away, and his eyes narrow. John turns to him. The deep-sea eyes do not quite raise to him, and the circles under them are still there, like two dark moons. But there is the ghost of a smile on his thin lips. Sherlock’s head tilts to the side.
Sherlock breathes in relief and begins to recount Honeybee’s schedule and activities for the day; when she ate and what and how much, how many times he changed her diaper, with what she played and when, for how long she napped.
John had been afraid… afraid Sherlock will take it. Whatever happened. He would take it and still believe he deserved it and still absolve John of all blame and still believe in his ‘noble’ John Watson. John had seen it happen. In his head. Countless times. He had seen it again and again until he was left raw and hurt and empty. John sees it now. He can conjure it up if he wants to. But…
Sherlock watches as John breathes, tries to work his way through his thoughts. He was not expecting him to reveal more, when he speaks again.
Rosie is sitting at her baby chair, moved low to the floor. The grey elephants on it swim in John’s eyes. She’s quiet, stopping whatever she’s doing if she hears him come close. He tried to stand by the mirror in the morning and repeat his anti-guilt, anti-inadequate facts like Ella asked him to but couldn’t. He feels like a child, standing and talking bullshit to himself. He has failed Rosie anyway. Changing his feelings about it is not helping.
A small muffled breath breaks the silence and John turns around with a grunt - his shoulder straining - to gaze at that particular little reason. Why he can’t abandon this world. The pleading of his dreams and nightmares. The epilogue. The result. The little one, curled up in the crib with a leg folded under her small stomach and her bum raised childishly in the air, a finger in her mouth and soft purrs coming out of her lips like a warmed-up kitten. Rosie. His daughter.
John had bent over the sink, head hanging, palms gripping had enough to crack it. He was shaking. Sherlock’s shoulders had fallen, his back straightened. Fear had gripped tight around his diaphragm and squeezed.
The breaths ease. The heartbeat slows down. The last faded images that haunted him retreat, like hissing snakes scared away by fire.
He wants to cure this. He wants to scare the ghosts away, smooth out the cracks with his fingertips, make the depths of these eyes smile again. But… Could he?...Could he?  His thumb brushes over Sherlock’s cheek,  in awe of the strength… The fragility… The discovery and the thought itself… Forbidden. Needed. Unattainable. Like the stars. The moon…
Sherlock frowns. There must already have been problems for the fights to occur, and for the mother to disappear. John’s father must already have been an explosive, threatening person. So why she did not take her children with her is beyond him. Beyond John, too, judging by the look in his eyes. Beneath the courage of a soldier, straightening his spine and looking the enemy in the eye, there is the confusion of a child left to cope with a monster. Sherlock shivers.
“How are we, today?” John walks towards his daughter hesitantly. Sherlock washes the first bowl as slowly as he can, watching over his shoulder.
There’s a soft cling at his side, creating a chain of echoes in his ringing ears. He dares to peer from one open eyelid, only able to make out the shape of a glass at the table beside him. Two plops and then sizzling. John imagines the small flick of the bony hand that threw the effervescent tablets in. His mind roars and it all crashes down on him at once.
He was right. He was right. Staying away was right. It will happen again. He will only do it again. How can Sherlock not see? He has to make him see. He
“Well, I… I thought… Since you have decided to… You know… Live together again, and are working on things together, that you…”
I am too exhausted to check if we need to mention anything else in the end notes apart from the title but if there is something, we'll add it tomorrow ;)
“Sherlock…”, she tuts when she took in the mess in the sink and the kitchen table. “Is this from my good china set?”, she lifts a cracked cup from the top of the pile, keeping it away from her as if it were a dead rat.
All positive changes aside, the skies were still dark. There were moments were both faltered, fell silent, could not achieve a smile. Then they just kept company to each other, spent the time over cups of tea and small nibbles, waiting for the storms to weather.
And now John is here, presumably to stay, at least for a while. The thought of John living in 221B again is peculiar. So familiar, at first -two mugs of morning tea in the sink, a good morning and goodnight, someone to share the empty space with, the small sounds that indicated someone was there with him; a running tap, the telly, the clicks on another laptop keyboard. Maybe the odd smile.
John was kneeling before him, gaze lowered, shoulders squared. Apologizing. Asking for forgiveness. Laying his heart bare, like a lamb offering its head to the sacrificial table, trusting it in Sherlock's hands. Sherlock had never been given a heart before.
John needed to feel he could be his good-doctor self again. Loyal, useful, caring, strong, a person to rely on… The thought alone made him glow from within. And if this is what would make John feel better, if this would give John a reason to fend off the monsters that raged inside him, then that is what Sherlock would provide him.
Sherlock looks at him. Blankly, for a moment. John’s chest constricts because he knows that look. It’s all Sherlock. Sherlock trying to control himself, hide something. Is it anger? Disappointment? He sees the black curls fall around the so well-known face, sees the genuine attempt to say what needs to be said and John just can’t let him.
"You don't have an Oyster card, do you?", John asks as he flicks through his wallet at the entrance to the station. Sherlock tries to say 'no', but the word gets choked down as a group of people rushes by them. Hearing no reply, John hums and raises his gaze to him, to which Sherlock nods, out of breath.
And just like that, the tether snaps. John’s eyes widen and his whirlwind of a mind clears again. Like it did yesterday.
Sherlock’s long fingers remove the teabags and bring their mugs over. His knuckles are only a tad redder because of the heat. John bites his lip, lets it slide free, and strives to reach and help.
It is the fact this area is so great for children, that makes this appointment so special, John keeps reminding himself. The walls around him constrict, shift, loom over him, like the trenches he used to hide under to escape death, fate, destiny. The sorrowful line of a bullet fired, released from its keeper to the forces of mere luck. The mantra of qualifications rolls like credits in his mind, following the elevator’s small noises and Rosie’s puffy breaths against his chest. She’s nestled, curled up, not looking around anymore, and John can’t reassure her. He can’t even reassure himself.
Up the stairs he goes, head lowered. Falling still. But has already failed now. Not merely failing. He is a loser. In every sense. He’s lost them. The chances. He’s lost them. His daughter. His best mate. The fall, however… it never stops…
“Her-her pink… elephant plushie was too dirty when we got home. I took it away, as I should have, as I need to and-”
Sherlock is kneeling on the floor, arm stretched under the cabinet, buried to the shoulder, his face is flushed pink and he is now biting his lip, wide nervous eyes fixed on John. His curls are a mess again -even though he brushed them after breakfast- and it is obvious as hell that the position he’s currently in, makes his breath hitch.
“You’ve made it clear, how I don’t have any say in this... But... I’m worried, you are destroying her life.”
Rosie's eyelids flutter, and she sleepily clutches the curls at the back of Sherlock's neck and hides her face in his throat. He presses a silent kiss to her curls, unsteady because of the watery tremors of his chin.
Sherlock fills his lungs with air and dives. He swims into a cold current, does not open his eyes as he kicks and pushes and strives to move forward. He does not question where he needs to go; he just needs to move, to not remain here. The water weighs him down, there are bubbles breaking through his lips. He breaks to the surface for breath, his hair slicked back, away from his face.
John had not given any indication that he would want to move back in. Perhaps his brother pressured him. But no, John would never do something he did not want to do, would he, stubborn as a pack mule. Especially given the way he treated the prospect of seeing Sherlock again yesterday… Grim chances. Not choice, then. Need. Short on money? John
John curls his fingers tight around the rough texture of a cheap blanket, thumb rubbing the fabric carefully slow, concentrating, categorising, holding on to the sense of touch as all others have seemed to abandon him. His throat tasting only bile and his nose blocked by the smoke of a dream. Holding on to reality, persuading himself he’s not running, not chasing, not burning up.
She shifts, sniffs, small fists clutching at his wet t-shirt. When he pulls her away to coax in the bathtub again, she clutches his fingers tighter and the look on her face is pure and utter betrayal. She screams.
She was already giggling with grabby hands towards her father but one look at the penguin and her whole face lit up. She grabbed it by one little wing and threw it over her plastic table. John smiled, giving Sherlock a nervous shrug.
“She needs to take three of those. It’s one and a half for her weight but I don’t want it to spill.” He explains, just to fill the silence and keep Rosie focused on his voice.
“Mm?” John pretends not to hear. His eyes stray down to Sherlock’s chin. His hand reaches, his thumb and fingers gentle brush over the auburn stubble that left unchecked could grow into soft curls, cleaning it up as much as he can, cherishing the feel of Sherlock’s chin, the place under it, tracing it, mapping it. So soft. Tingly.
“Alright. Your way, little brother”, she says, as if this is a sacrifice not worth making. With her next exhale, she murmurs “I have only ever wanted what is best for you”
She settled with a sniffle; meaning she stopped fighting his embrace. He whipped a palm over his face with a long suffering sigh. Took it away and found his fingers wet. Thumb, index and middle brushing together in confusion. He felt it all over his cheeks then, frowned and almost heard the dried streaks crack at the edge of one eye. Had he been dreaming? Did he wake her in the midst of a nightmare? God help him if he couldn’t even let his daughter sleep properly anymore.
He needs a drink. Just one. A drop of alcohol. Just one. He would give everything to damp it all down. Just a bit. A tiny bit. Tesco at the corner by the clinic had been a challenge. But he didn’t budge. Wouldn’t. Couldn’t. Not today.
“Took the day off”, John he announces, peering in from the door. A towel is draped over his shoulder, and his hair is wet. “Does little dove want to come downstairs? Change of scenery might help -and we should air this room”
He’s panicked. He’s pleading. It hits Sherlock through the head, kicks whatever mechanism operates in his brain into working again.
Now an interesting collection of pink shapes has been assorted, accentuated by some blues and purples, dots and lines. He smiles. Waits for her to finish with her creative frenzy and address him.
Sherlock has already gathered the dishes and is about to get up and wash them too. John smiles. He knows how Sherlock values being left chores. It’s part of the ‘no pity’ rule.
“Some water, please? A bottle?” John’s voice is polite and kind, and, as always, dashing, show-off green. Sherlock wants to pick it apart, to stop it from doing the inevitable.
Hum and voice become one as the identical blond and silver heads move from side to side together and John’s heart races proudly. ‘She
John’s heart is hammering inside his chest. He feels he’s been sitting there forever. His leg has gone numb. Sherlock is breathing. Even and slow. Too even. Too slow. John almost can’t feel it. He gets up and walks around the bed, sitting in front of the bundled-up figure. Nothing moves.
He decides to wrap John with the blanket that is usually folded at the back of his red armchair, and then places a pillow -the Union Jack pillow- beneath John’s head, too. All he has to go on is instinct. Guesswork. John mumbles at being moved.
‘I think about it all day anyway and nothing can take that away, so what’s the point of not doing it?’
She giggled, patting his cheek with a sloppy little palm and sticking her tongue between her lips playfully. He pushed some curls away from her face, sighing. God, he was tired.
Sherlock hears the door opening and closing, steps trudging on the stairs. He shoots up from bed, in a flurry of bedclothes flown aside, and rushes to the corridor. It’s a short flight; he pauses just outside his bedroom. When the blood thumping in his ears subsides, what he is met with is silence; there are no more footsteps.
But John will tell him. He’ll tell him everything. Every little bit that made him lonely, closed off, angry and sad and who he is… who he wants to be… what he feels… It doesn’t matter if he’s brave enough or not anymore. He’s gone and done it. He’s gone and fallen in love. Admitted it. He’s gone and pressed his lips against another man’s. A most desirable lip-lock. What he’s been craving for years. Just once. Just a kiss. And there is was. And here he is. Fussing about in their living room.
John shakes his head, his hands grab a rail of a staircase and he’s up the stairs, forehead against the soft smelling wood and he’s so relieved. Relieved he can smell this above all else. Relieved the unforgiving car engines haven’t washed this scent away. Relieved he is not so numbed by fear and alcohol yet...
“I was cruel. Sherlock…” John takes a shaky breath. “I knew you deserved someone… someone who would stay. Someone who would fight for forgiveness, to earn it. Someone who would help you get a better life, be brave, face up to what he’s done, be better himself. For you.
John plops on the chair across from him with his mug of steaming coffee. Sherlock’s eyes rise from the pancakes to him. John gives him a curt little smile and his eyes dart away, fluttering like a butterfly that doesn’t know where to settle. Sherlock looks down at his plate.
Sherlock is sinking. From within. Water is flooding his ears, his nostrils, his mouth. His lungs are stiff with it, his limbs fumbling, powerless to push him to the surface. He is trapped, bound to sink because he can’t let go, can’t let anything go; the same walls he built to keep himself safe the chains that bind him to the seafloor, the deep-blue abyss spreading beneath his feet. He needs to breathe. He can’t breathe, he’s choking, choking on his own heartbeat. He needs to force air out of his lungs, out, out,
This was a world where Sherlock didn’t dare to touch or speak, approach or even glance at John without being asked. A world where John put up walls around himself to manage. Cope. Avoid and not care. Even if they had touched, they had embraced, they had soothed each other’s souls… Just for a moment… Maybe that could happen again… No. That was something else. That moment in the sea of many existed only because, as always, his-damned-self decided to make the problem his own and start crying. Selfish.
His dream returns, then, as if in vengeance at the audacity of his train of thought. He sees the angry, accusing stare, feels everything the two of them ever were for John drain away from him, and sees John’s eyes cloud over, the world winning inch by inch as they saw in him a stranger, a freak, a psychopath. Because it was his fault. He broke his vow when he had promised. Once again, he was not enough.
John pauses for a moment but then he smiles. “Mmm yeah. But she was first, I will give her credit for that” He clears his throat, and rolls his weight on his heels and forward again, hands clasped firmly behind his back.
Sleep refused to be of assistance that night. Sherlock lay on his back, his hands collected over the hollow valley beneath his diaphragm. His chest was first heaving, unevenly, like a bird’s wing beating viciously against the wind. Then it eased into the low sighs of full-bellied waves. And last it was barely moving at all, and quivering.
As expected, she thrusts her spoon in his direction. John pretends to eat a mouthful and thanks her.
Their actions were different, but their words the same. They were forged out of the same materials, the same clay, blood, tears, the same fears and shadows. And perhaps, the same sunshine rays, same spring flowers, same summer breezes. Where there had been walls, now there was a way. A hand reaching to him, a beacon’s light shattering the night.
He looks at himself in the mirror as he passes by it. White shirt tucked in meticulously, black trousers. The same man, a different body, a different face. He raises his chin. The eyes that stare back at him are calm. They know who he is and who he should be.
There was no reply. ‘No, no no no, don’t go now’, he gritted his teeth. Stupid brain. Stupid. Rosie’s hands slipped from his palms and patted his cheeks his nose, his lips. A butterfly’s touch, as it landed here, there, glimmering in the sun. He sucked in a breath, tried to keep his heartbeat calmer than it had been. ‘What do I do. Tell me what to do’.
“I should not have lost my bloody temper like a five-year-old!” John’s voice cracks into a higher register as he falls back into the cushions. Unbelievable.
John’s mind was pleasantly filled. He had his routine, giving him security, protecting his sensitive senses of any pointless worry that might lead him to procrastination and eventual alcoholic drink. Rosie took up most of his time, but Sherlock was always there now, more than he had been. His previous reluctance not gone in its entirety, but less apparent. He had held Rosie in his lap just the other day, when John was doing dishes. John could hear them coo to each other from the kitchen and remembered that first time he’d seen them like this after they moved in.
“Alright, little one. Alright”, John soothes, but she is not buying it. “Right… Should get cooking, then-”
A heads-up: When you comment please keep in mind and respect that this is a personal interpretation of the characters and story.
I do not believe I am that man. I don’t know if I’ll ever manage to be. But I have gone over those days, what I did, what I felt, many times. I know what I was doing and what I didn’t want to do. I know what matters now. The DVD that I kept talking about, my supposed grief that drove me to… well, they don’t matter. I was trying to prove I wasn’t that man, a good man, while not doing anything to change it. I don’t want to do that again. What matters now is that I am ready… I’m ready to ask for what needs to be asked. To do what needs to be done. Honestly. Truly understanding and meaning it.”
? If John waking up here, beside him, will have the same effect as everything else that has caused the chasm between them to appear?
