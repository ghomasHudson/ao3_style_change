Dean tried offering a bite of his burger to his coyote head.  The coyote's point of view was suddenly primary in Dean's mind, and he grinned slyly at the thought of stealing just the meat paddy in the middle of the bun.  Only the realization that his other heads would then get stuck eating the rest of the meatless burger stopped him from following through with that desire.  Still, the coyote head really enjoyed a bite of burger.  Next Dean tried offering a bite to his squirrel head, but the smell of the meat alone made his squirrel side gag.
They hadn’t even gotten to the pie yet when Cas sensed other humans coming, forcing Dean to stuff his protesting wings back into his backpack.  The new group of over a dozen talkative college students clearly thought that this was a great lunch spot too, because they were quick to settle down right next to Dean and Cas and attempted to make friendly conversation with them despite Dean’s frosty reception of them.  The strangers didn’t seem to get that they were intruding on something (not that this was a date).
"No, my superiors will be angry when they find out.  To my knowledge, this should not have a negative impact on Dean's ability to hunt down and capture Lilith as planned.  But forming such a Profound Bond with a human would be considered an act of rebellion had it been intentional.  But given the circumstances, I most likely will not be killed," Cas explained, hanging his head.
<You look a little pink> Dean teased Sam with a sly grin, which earned him a “bitch face” in return.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, feeling a chill from the implications of Cas’ words, disrupting his otherwise  good mood.
"He is a devote man. He actually prayed for this," Cas replied. Dean raised an eyebrow at why anyone would pray to become some angel's prom dress.
“I don’t want to fly,” Dean stubbornly insisted, refusing to acknowledge the part of him that actually did.
The flight with Cas was actually quite short, and Dean noticed that they were descending when he saw the scenery coming closer.  Panic momentarily welled up in Dean as he feared they would somehow crash, but of course they didn’t.  Cas gave his hand a reassuring squeeze as they sailed right through the surface of the Earth like it was nothing, flying down into the cave system underneath.
"Jerk," Sam retorted. Both brothers tightened the hug even more for a moment before eventually pulling back.
“I… can’t get near it either,” Dean reluctantly admitted.  It sucked to have to say it out loud, almost like that made it more real than it already was.
“Is it safe to turn the headlamps on?” Sam asked.  Dean froze.  Wait – how had he just assessed the layout of the cave if there was no light?  Dean was fully aware of where the walls, ceiling, floor, stalactites, and stalagmites were – but he realized that he wasn’t actually seeing them with his eyes.  His brain was creating a mental map of the area for him.  This must be what Cas had been trying to teach him – his wings were picking up on all the tiny vibrations around him, and his brain had finally figured out how to decode it.  It probably helped that his new flight feathers were much better at channeling vibrations to his nerves than his down feathers were.
Dean tugged at whatever it was wrapped around him, and was even more started to discover that doing so actually hurt. What the hell? It felt like Dean had tried to yank one of his own arms out of its socket, but last time Dean checked, he didn't have any fluffy arms. Whatever this was, it was softer than silk, fluffier than a pillow, semi-transparent, and it glowed softly with a shimmery iridescent green. If Dean hadn't been so freaked out, he probably would have felt spellbound by the graceful way the green light seemed to dance around. It practically looked like whatever was smothering him was made of pure energy.
“You mean like the ability to see things most humans can’t, like that invisible paint for the warding?” Sam countered, somehow still being able to turn it back around on him.
The gas station was completely deserted. It was actually kinda creepy just how much of a ghost town this whole area was. Dean's skin crawled with the suspicion that whatever pulled him out had to be a seriously powerful badass if his presence had cleared out the whole area.
“Look – we’ve all died a few times.  At some point you’ve got to just bury the past and move on with your life.  Gabriel killed me a few dozen times, but I got over it when he eventually came through for us in the end,” Dean began, frowning at Sam’s wince.  Sam never admitted to just how many Tuesdays Gabriel put him through, but from the way Sam was avoiding Dean’s eyes now it was like Sam had under-exaggerated the number . . . . but Dean couldn’t worry about that now.  Cas needed him.  “Anyway, my point is that you and Balthazar go way back.  If he’s alive again then maybe you can come back from this.”
“Then I’ll just have to learn quickly.  Good thing I have a great teacher,” Dean replied with a sly smile, meeting Cas’ eyes for a moment.  He tried not to let the look of skepticism on Cas’ face faze him any.  They’d figure it out.  Dean couldn’t help but envy how easily Cas slipped his intangible wings through the Impala’s exterior, coasting on the wind as they drove.  Dean wondered what it’d feel like to have the wind in his feathers like that.  His own wings were now only about a foot long each – not quite long enough to fill the large backpack that Sam had bought for him, but too large to be comfortable inside it.  Dean could feel them constantly twitching inside the backpack, longing to be free and ride the wind like Cas’ wings were doing.  This was the first time he’d tried restricting them and it was bothering him a lot more than he’d expected it to.  He was glad now that he’d chosen a destination only about two hours from the Bunker rather than some of the trails further away that he’d considered.
<You learned more signing!  For me?  Thank you!> Eileen signed, a big smile spreading across her face.  She attempted to initiate an awkward hug with Sam, and succeeded after two false starts.  It reminded Cas of the awkward learning experience of his first few hugs with Dean.  Eileen clearly didn’t have much experience with hugging either, but perhaps like Cas, she could get better with practice.
“Awesome – now this is more like it.  They might still be a bit small, but they are finally starting to look like warrior wings,” Dean commented.  No more baby chick wings, and he wouldn’t look like a porcupine again until the next molt.
He wasn't sure how long he laid there in that half asleep state, but as he started drifting back to full consciousness, Dean felt strangely warm and cocooned. It was actually really nice. But when Dean remembered that he hadn't crawled under the blankets last night, and therefore shouldn't feel cocooned now, he awoke with a start.
“Right – ‘cause a guy in his 30s running around town in a backpack is not weird at all,” Sam deadpanned.  Leave it to Sam to not appreciate the sheer awesomeness of his idea.
"Yeah, thanks for that," Dean told him, the words seeming so hollow and inadequate for just how grateful he really was, but Dean had always sucked at words. "What happened to the rest of your garrison?"
“It’s Balthazar’s,” Cas announced, looking stricken with pain and guilt over his lost friend.  Dean cringed, remembering all too well the night in Purgatory when Cas had broken down and confessed his regret over how Balthazar had really died.  Dean had already suspected the truth, and was all ready with his counter argument when Cas tried to use that as an excuse as to why Dean shouldn’t try to save Cas from Purgatory.  At that moment Cas hadn’t believed himself to be worth saving after what he’d done, especially since saving Cas had been a risk for both Dean and Benny.  But Dean had refused to give up on Cas, no matter what he’d done.  Cas was mentally in a much better place now, but Dean was still worried what kinds of emotions Balthazar’s feather might shake loose.  Dean wished that the past would just stay buried for once.
“Cas is your hunter-in-training.  Does his vulnerability to angel warding prevent him from being a good hunter?” Sam continued playing devil’s advocate.
“Aw – lighten up Sammy!  You’re such a prude,” Dean replied with a laugh.  Cas gave Dean a light playful whap with his wing.
The first bite was even better than Dean had anticipated, and Dean was soon shoveling the pie in with heartfelt enthusiasm, groans of pleasure escaping him.  This was one of the most perfect pies that Dean had ever tasted.  Memories of his mom’s homemade apple pies flooded his mind with every bite.  The top crust was made of melt-in-your-mouth crust crumbles just the way Dean liked it, and the apples were complimented with a perfect blend of seasonings that enhanced their natural flavor without overpowering the apples.
"Proof that there's a God out there that actually gives a crap about me personally? I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it. I don't understand why God or any of his angels would give a crap about me," Dean replied.
“Trolls under a bridge – really?  We couldn’t have gone for the case with the herd of rabid jackalopes?” Dean yelled into his cellphone.  The forest was near pitch black because of the new moon, so he had to be extra careful not to trip as he ran.  Dean had argued in favor of spread the rumor that it was the Full Moon that would take away Sam’s immunity, but his vote had been overturned because nobody wanted to wait for the Full Moon.  Waiting longer to spring their plan into action would run the risk of Zachariah commissioning other supernatural beings to assassinate Dean.  Apparently Zachariah wasn’t known for his patience.  So now Dean was stuck running through a dark forest while being chased by living rocks.  Just peachy.
They weren't far out from Bobby's house, so they headed there. Along the way, Dean asked Sam a few questions about what had happened since he'd been gone. It was a shock to find out that only three months had passed by topside. Sam was reluctant to go into too many details about those months, and Dean didn't press too much since it was clear Sam was still in a lot of pain over everything that happened, but he explained the general gist of what happened. Ruby was presumed dead, Sam and Bobby were hunting down Lilith together, and iPod jacks had ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS EVER BEING IN BABY.
"You seem more at ease with manifesting your wings," Cas commented once they had found a quiet spot away from the group.  Dean relaxed and easily let his wings out again in a casual stretch.  It felt good to have them out again in a place where there was no judgment.  Sure, none of the others had done more than crack a few jokes about his wings, but nobody quite looked at him the same anymore now that they knew he was part supernatural.  Even the Tr-Gabriel seemed to have a new odd glint in his eyes when he looked at Dean that didn't use to be there.  But Cas accepted Dean completely in a way nobody else ever had.  Whatever weird stuff Dean could do now wouldn't even faze Cas.
“Yes of course – most things that can hurt an angel can hurt demons too after all, and we had an arsenal,” the demon retorted like this was all painfully obvious.  But the demon seemed to be getting bored of this conversation, and went back to selecting a torture instrument to use on Sam.
“Er, I don’t require sustenance…,” Cas tried to remind them, looking a little apprehensive about getting caught in between the brothers and dragged into their prank war.
He had badass wings.  It was hard to believe just how different they looked with new plumage.  They looked awesome.  Dean made a few experimental flaps.  His wings made more sound now too, and felt different as he moved them.  Different movements either encountered a lot more air resistance, or practically none at all.  But his wings also felt a lot heavier than they had a few days ago.  As lightweight as individual feathers were, they added up quickly.  Dean was grateful for all of Cas’ help in strengthening his wings.
“Show me the feather,” Cas commanded.  Sam quickly scurried to comply.  The feather was mostly a light bronze, although it was hard to tell because it was partially covered with some sort of dried on goop.  There was a partial boot print on it, like it had been dropped and stepped on during the demon flight.  Even the parts of the feather that were relatively clean were rather frayed and worn looking.
His eyelids felt so heavy.  Everything felt so heavy.  The voices and movements around him felt more and more distant.  Dean vaguely realized that he was dying.  But at least Sam and Cas were safe….
A sudden burst of bright white light filled the room. Dean shut his eyes. The vampires screamed as they died. Then there was total silence. Dean opened his eyes slowly, taking in the sight of all of the vampires lying on the ground dead with their eyes burned out. He looked up at Sam and was relieved to see that Sam was safe and without a scratch. Cas had done this. Cas had just saved Sam's life, and taken out a whole nest of vampires in the blink of an eye to do so. Dean swallowed.
“Stop!  It’s…,” Cas tried to warn them, but it was too late.  A solid wall suddenly dropped from the ceiling behind them.  It was covered in angel sigils too.  They were trapped.  Then before they could regroup and get Sam to break the other sigils, a gas was sprayed right at them.  Dean choked and felt himself starting to lose consciousness.  Even worse – the last thing Dean saw was not only Sam being affected by the gas, but also Cas.  What the hell could knock out an angel?
Dean gaped in shock as he took in his reflection.  His normal, human face was unchanged.  But then on either side of his head were two semi-transparent other faces that weren't human.  One looked like a coyote's face and the other was a squirrel face.
“Yeah Dean, you look pretty good,” Sam replied, with more fondness portrayed through his eyes than his words.  “Just in time for battle too.”
"I'm fine Sammy," Dean lied, hopefully convincingly. He was having a hard time keeping his voice normal when he was majorly freaking out here.
The fact that the locator spell worked was apparently further proof that Balthazar was still alive, since apparently it only worked by locating the grace of a living angel.  Unfortunately, the locator spell wasn’t particularly precise – it gave them a 20 mile radius to search in southwest South Dakota.  They took a few extra minutes to try summoning Balthazar, just in case he had escaped the demons but was hiding out somewhere in the badlands.  No such luck – summoning spells couldn’t work on angels trapped in warded locations.  Time for a rescue mission.
“Stop beating yourself up, Dean,” Sam insisted.  “We’ve split up on hunts before, and you’ve trusted me to be able to handle things.”
“Very thin barriers like fabric or bullet casings are not always enough to prevent an object from picking up our energy since our energy field extends slightly beyond of physical vessels,” Cas explained.  Dean swore.
“I told you not to try to fly,” Cas reprimanded him.  “You’re lucky that you didn’t do worse damage to your wings.”  Dean felt the relief of Grace soothing and healing his wings.
Dean had been so focused on the similarities between him and Cas that it hadn't occurred to him that Cas' forward facing face still being human (inside or outside his vessel) was something unusual for angels.  Maybe Cas' human face was a sign that his angel had been connected to humanity even before they'd ever met.
But small brief touches couldn’t sustain Dean for long – he wanted more.  There was a spot about halfway along the arch of Dean’s wings – where his alula feathers would someday grow – where he had a small flap of skin and muscle.  They hadn’t done much training with his alula flap yet, but Dean had discovered that he could get a bit of a grip on some things with it.  Time to put that to good use.
“Must you insist on trying to talk?  I’m healing your more vital organs first – I’ll get to your vocal cords in due time!” Cas replied with a sigh.  “You essentially tried to move all of your being onto the physical plane.  Since the wards are only effective against the parts of you on the seraphic plane, you weakened the effects of the wards on you.  A full-angel would have died before they would have been able to reach the ward, but you were human enough to barely make it.  However, you would have died without an angel to rebalance your being and heal your injuries.”
Dean started trying more carefully to untangle himself. Yep, whatever was wrapped around him was definitely attached to his body, and he could feel it when he touched them. After a moment of fumbling, Dean managed to un-cocoon himself. The two new fluffy appendages were attached to his back. Wings. Dean had wings. What the hell?
They packed quickly like they’d been trained to do all of their lives, and were on the road in 10 minutes.
"Shut up, bitch," Dean groaned.  He was never going to live this down.  What part of his crazy soul thought 'Dean Winchester: fierce hunter & cuddly squirrel'?
“Next Cas wanted me to test to see if your senses were improving,” Sam continued once they were done with the wing grooming.  Sam took a piece of paper and a pen and walked over to the other side of the room.  Then Sam started drawing something on the paper.
"Maybe it heard my prayers," Sam whispered reverently, but Dean could hear the pain behind Sam's words that betrayed just how broken Sam had been after Dean died.
With a flap of wings, Hannah was gone.  As the businessman turned towards Dean, Dean felt his stomach drop.  That smug face grinned in a very devilish expression, eyeing Dean like a bug he was about to squash.
“Relax Dean – we’ve been gathering intel while you slept.  We’ve got some maps of the cave system, and get this – a significant portion of the cave has been removed from modern maps.  There are a few vague drawings of that part of the cave from a hundred years ago, but most of it was unexplored – and someone wants it to stay that way,” Sam explained.
The rest of the drive wasn't as much fun since there was now a strict "no more detours" policy.  They didn't stop at any more diners, and Cas insisted on thoroughly inspecting any convenience store food that they bought before he would let them eat it.  The trio did try to stop at a motel for the night a few hours later, but as luck would have it, it was swarming with demons.  On the plus side, Dean’s hunting skills were still on par with how they’d been before his death – maybe even better than they’d been before.  He managed to gank two demons while Cas smited three and Sam got one.  It was the kind of confidence booster Dean needed after how completely useless he’d been at the last battle.
"He said he already tried to get other agents on the case and nobody would help him.  He's the only agent who believes that this is a real case, and it's our kind of thing, so I told him we'd head down to Georgia and take a look," Sam told him.
There was nothing uncomfortable or unpleasant about the shift.  It was more like setting down a heavy backpack after a long hike, or a swim in a motel pool on a hot summer day.  Dean’s wings instantly lost all of their tension from his apprehension, and the rest of his muscles were definitely picking up signals to relax too.
Poking fun at Balthazar was a tried and true way to keep Dean from freaking out over just how screwed they really were.  There was no backup coming to help them out of this one.  He suspected that demons had been plucking the feathers off of Balthazar, which Dean imagined would hurt like hell.  Were he and Cas next in line to get plucked?  They had to get out of here!
<... these are all the documents I’ve found so far that mention your grandfather.  I thought you might enjoy taking a look through them while you are here.> Sam signed.
"No way!  You are not going to angel mojo my pie away!" Dean protested.  Cas blinked in confusion, doing the head tilt thing again, but he respected Dean's wishes.
Everything looked a little bit different too.  Everything looked sort of transparent like it wasn’t really real anymore.  The motel room had all become a muted dark red, and felt slightly out of focus.  Even the floor beneath their feet didn’t feel like it was entirely there – Dean suspected that he could move right through it if he really wanted to (which he didn’t).  Sam – who was frozen in time and completely unaware that he was currently in a different dimension – didn’t quite look completely solid either, but had a bright yellow-orange color to the energy that was lazily swirling around him.  Both Dean and Cas had a much faster swirling energy around them, which was more of a yellow-green color.  Cas seemed to be patiently waiting while Dean took it all in before flying to their destination.  Dean looked at Cas and saw the same eyes staring into his very soul as always.
To get extra practice, they decided to put a no speaking rule into place for the three days before Eileen arrived at the bunker.  Dean used this as an excuse to blast loud rock music all day so he could feel the vibration of the music just like deaf people.  Sam invested in a very heavy duty pair of noise-blocking ear muffs, and offered Cas a pair as well.  Cas had sighed and resigned himself to more frequently healing the damage Dean insisted on doing to his ears so that Dean would not lose his hearing.  Cas knew that deaf people like Eileen could be great hunters, but she had a lifetime of experience adapting to a world without sound.  If Dean lost his hearing, he wouldn’t have the same experience to help protect him from all the monsters who wanted to kill him.
Dean's favorite word – awesome – just had a return to its roots. The sight before him was both absolutely incredible beyond words and the single most drop-dead terrifying thing he had ever seen. Seriously. Thirty years in Hell had nothing on this dude.
"Does Lilith still really want Sam's intestines on a stick?" Henriksen asked.  "Or does that interfere with whatever role Sam is supposed to play in the apocalypse?"  Dean couldn’t help twitching at how matter-of-fact Henriksen talked about topics like Dean’s little brother playing a role in the apocalypse.
“Stand down?  Dean was nearly killed!” Sam argued, glaring at Gabriel like he was still holding a grudge against him for all the other times he’d killed Dean.
“Seriously guys?  I’m right here!” Sam shrieked, his voice two whole octaves higher than normal, making him sound even more like the big girl he really was.
Taking careful aim, Dean took a deep breath and tossed a rock at one of the giants, hitting it square in the eye.
"That was fast," Dean commented, surprised because he hadn't thought that he and Cas had been gone that long.  But at least getting back into hunting would help him find the sense of normal that his life so badly needed right now.
“Seriously?” Dean gaped, having a hard time focusing on Cas’ words as the breeze picked up and the sensations going through his wings became more intense.  It really did not help that the wind blew a flower petal that got caught on his wings.  When Cas reached over and gently pulled the flower petal off, even more of Dean’s blood was diverted away from his brain.
"Then I won't ever leave Dean's side!  I'll fight them off!  I'll fight them all off!" Cas declared with a fire in his voice that suggested he just might smite anyone who even looked at Dean the wrong way.
Dean hadn’t realized just how many feathers he had until he started losing so many of them.  His jaw dropped when he realized that Sam and Cas had been collecting his feathers into a surprisingly large pile.
<Dean> Cas signed patiently, but unable to stop his cheeks from flushing a bit.  <Don’t repeat the sign “hungry” for emphasis.  Sign “hungry” once and use your facial expression to show how hungry you are.>
“Poor Baby really missed me,” Dean cooed while petting the steering wheel.  Dean really appreciated how Cas not only didn’t roll his eyes at him like Sam would have done, but actually smiled like he was pleased to see Dean so happy.  Sure, Dean had to adjust to having the bench further back to make room for his wings, but it was still worth it to be out on the open road again.
“Perhaps,” Cas said coyly, as if he hadn’t just caught Dean unintentionally cheating, “the absence of your normal sensory stimuli will prompt your new senses to overcompensate?”  Cas leaned in close and whispered these words right up against Dean’s neck, causing Dean to shiver and fluff up his feathers.  Cas hummed his approval at Dean’s reaction.  Sneaky bastard.  Dean so needed to get him back for this later.
"No problem, Sammy.  Just work on your kung-fu grip on these vines next time, bitch," Dean replied, and gave Sam a light punch on the shoulder.
“Fire did the trick.  Thanks Bobby.  I’ll go find Sam and Cas and help them with the other two trolls that took off after them,” Dean reported before ending the call.  The pile of burning kindling was a long way from anything else flammable, so there shouldn’t be any risk of starting a forest fire.  That left him free to go rendezvous with where Sam was planning to defeat his troll…
“I want you, and any other angels in the area, to go guard Alastair.  He is very important to our plans, and we need him alive.  Don’t do anything else until I return,” the businessman ordered.
"No, I don't require any sustenance," Cas replied simply, and the waiter left before Dean could protest.
“You really think the blade of a part-angel can take down a demon as powerful as Lilith?” Dean asked skeptically.
“That depends – do you think she knows that we, and possibly some of the other angels, have been tasked with capturing her alive?” Dean asked.
They could practice more angel mojo later.  For now they were both just overjoyed to finally let their souls and grace have something else they’d been yearning for.
“Cas and I found a place covered in angel warding,” Dean told him.  “We need you to come down and check it out… and maybe you should recruit Garth or someone so you have some backup?”
“I’m fine, Sammy,” Dean tried to reassure him.  He probably still looked like a mess, but he was in one piece and ‘out of danger’ according to Cas.  There would be more follow up healing sessions later.
“Yes Dean.  Your angel side has a constant connection to the seraphic plane, just as your vessel has a constant connection to the physical world.  With time I can teach you to travel freely between them,” Cas explained.  Dean twitched slightly at his body being called a vessel but let it slide.  He was far more distracted by how much his wings really wanted to start flapping.  Trying to hold them still and folded against his back seemed to be going against his angelic instincts.  Ever since he got here the desire to move had been building up.
"So you DO remember Hell!" Sam rounded on Dean, surely eager to try to get Dean to talk about his feelings, which was the last thing Dean wanted to do.
Suddenly blue-white lightening rained down from the heavens and struck Alastair.  Alastair struggled, unable to escape.  But then a bright white circle of light completely engulfed Alastair.  Dean had to shield his eyes from the brightness of the light, and when he opened them, Alastair was gone.
“Why would it?” Garth asked in confusion.  “Love is beautiful in whatever form it takes, and yours has been a long time coming.  I’ve heard it in your voice whenever you’ve talked about Cas, and Kevin says that your staring contest can get so heated that he wants to tell you guys to get a room, but he doesn’t think you’d even hear him when you’re like that.”
"Hold on – you're serious?  Angels are real?" Henriksen said incredulously.  Dean couldn't help a small smirk.
"What the hell?" Sam asked when he surveyed the room with his shotgun raised, clearly expecting a monster, and only finding Dean in the weirdest position he'd ever been in. Dean blinked back up at them, trying to think of one of his usual quick witted retorts, but his brain seemed to be short circuiting right now. He was at a complete loss at how to explain this.
"Now, maybe, but earlier I had super hearing for a while, and well, uh, wings," Dean admitted, still having trouble believing that all of that had really happened.
“It’s in bad shape, but with the right spell it might still be possible to locate Balthazar’s general vicinity,” Cas mused.  “But he won’t want to see me.”  Cas trembled slightly at those words, his voice wavering.  He looked so lost and alone that it was painful to look at.  Dean sighed and wrapped an arm around Cas, guiding Cas to lay his head on Dean’s shoulder.  It wasn’t much, but Dean tried to do what he could to offer Cas at least some comfort.
“Don’t worry about it Cas,” Dean told him.  “Lead the way – we can find a nice spot for lunch down by the river.”  If Cas saw right through Dean’s not-so-subtle way to keep Cas’ eyes off his wings, he was too polite to say anything.  But first things first – that sad look on Cas’ face had to go.  Dean trailed a teasing line of kisses down the line of Cas’ jaw like he was heading for Cas’ mouth, but at the last second he kissed the tip of his nose instead.  Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Cas to imply a continuation of those ministrations after the hike, and ruffled Cas’ hair to make it look even more like sex-hair than usual.  Cas gave him a look that clearly asked ‘is that really how you plan to end all of our disagreements?’ which was accompanied by a small smile that suggested that he could get on board with that.
“Just shut up if you aren’t going to say anything helpful!” Sam snapped, and Dean was proud of his brother for somehow actually getting Balthazar to finally shut the hell up.  “What if I came to you?”  Sam started using his overgrown legs to try to push his chair towards where Dean, Cas, and Balthazar were imprisoned.
“We’ll make more time for that too later,” Cas continued with a shy smile, the slight tease in his voice indicating that Dean’s wings had been giving away his thoughts again.  “But for now you should close your eyes again and focus on all the new sensory information you are receiving.  The wind is a form of energy transmitting signals through your wings.  Your mind must learn to decode the signals in your surroundings, but in time you will be able to sense things just as clearly without any wind.  Everything is made of energy, even objects you perceive to be solid, and the vibrations that they give off can be sensed with angel wings.”
The giant mound of living rocks that was uprooting whole trees was, of course, completely immune to the guns and knives Dean had on him.
…,” Sam tried in vain, talking so fast he got impressively far before the demon used his powers to clamp Sam’s mouth shut.
Fortunately, Sam didn’t push the issue, but just said that he’d see if Garth was available to come down with him.  Dean hoped it was Garth and not some other hunter who showed up with Sam.  Out of all the hunters the Winchesters were currently in contact with, Garth seemed to be the person most likely to be tolerant of Dean’s new wings.  Too many other hunters out there would probably be quick to add Dean to their kill list, now that he was something partially supernatural.
“No you’re not,” Cas called his bluff.  “You’re exhausted from fledging.  You can’t push through on so little sleep when the feathers have consumed so much of your energy.  Get some sleep Dean.”  Now it was Cas’ turn to stare Dean down and win.  Dean was at less than 100% and they all knew it.
Their flight leveled off again, and the next thing Dean knew they were soaring upwards.  So long as he didn't overthink it, his wings knew how to fly.  With each mighty flap Dean's wings were carrying them back upwards to where everyone else was still waiting for them.  There were cheers of surprise and relief as they got closer.
A slight breeze started as they hiked through the rolling hills just beginning to turn green.  The sensation of the wind ruffling his feathers for the first time made Dean gasp.  He had expected it to be similar to how the wind felt in his hair, but the increased sensitivity of his wings intensified the experience.  It felt completely amazing.  While the individual sensations in different parts of his wings weren’t as intense as when Cas groomed his wings, these sensations were everywhere at once.  It was practically overwhelming.  Dean was suddenly inundated with this strong sense of connectedness unlike anything he’d ever felt before.
“Spoil sport,” Dean mumbled, frustrated at getting wing-blocked by his little brother.  Sam started the Impala again and pulled back onto the road.
“Er,” Sam interjected, coughing uncomfortably.  “If the demons had one of Balthazar’s feathers – is it possible that they have Balthazar too?”  Dean cursed and a new look of horror covered Cas’ face.
"Congratulations – 24 minutes and 16 seconds is our new record!" the waiter told him.  Oh yeah, delicious free pie was totally worth the enormous stomachache that Dean now had.  It was hard to stand up afterwards, and Dean kind of wanted to pass out in the backseat and let Sam drive now, but it was totally worth it.
But that only led Cas to make the lessons harder.  Cas stopped making the game about Dean moving his wings to touch Cas’ hand.  Instead, he asked Dean to use words to explain where Cas’ hand was.  This turned out to be a lot harder than Dean anticipated.  Somewhere between his instincts and his mouth, Dean got repeatedly tripped up by over-thinking things.
Fingers touched his forehead, and with the sound of wings flapping, Dean was now sitting at the edge of the trees with Sam and Cas.  The ox trampled over the spot where the three of them had been a few seconds ago, and then proceeded to smash through some of the other cars.  Screams came from the log cabin as the other diners became aware of the giant blue ox wreaking havoc outside.
"Yes, I suppose the sight of these creatures would leave most humans quaking with awe," Cas replied.  Dean rolled his eyes, and went to strap on a few choice weapons.  He wasn't going to go up there without any weapons, but he didn't want to weigh himself down too much for the long climb either.  They'd just have to make plans up as they went along like they always did.  He very pointedly tried not to think about just how high he was going to have to climb in just a few minutes.  If this wasn’t a task he needed to be sober for, he definitely would have taken a few shots of whiskey to calm his nerves.
“In the morning?  Why not now?  It’d be easier to break in without so many people around.  Sam and I took turns sleeping in the car, so we’re good to go,” Dean replied.
“Cas!” Dean called, which made Cas slow down slightly so that Dean had a chance of keeping pace.  After a minute or two they rounded a corner and came across a man-made structure built into the side of a cliff face.  It was covered in neon blue symbols that almost seemed to glow in the sunlight.
“No worries Dean – I’m sure your new boyfriend would be happy to teach you,” Garth replied.  Dean jolted at the word boyfriend, but swallowed his protest at the word.  He was still getting used to dating a guy, but he supposed that it wasn’t wrong to call Cas his boyfriend.  Somehow though the word felt too simplistic and incomplete to really represent what Cas meant to him.  For now though, Dean didn’t have a better word to suggest so he left it alone.
“Feel what?” Sam asked, glancing back and forth between Dean and Cas, while looking even more confused than Dean felt.  Cas wasn’t exactly being forthcoming, so Dean took pity on his wingless brother.
Dean opened his eyes just in time to see Sam plummet past him, freefalling a few thousand feet above the Earth.
“The silver sheaths are starting to break away.  Your new feathers are very lovely,” Cas told him softly.  Now THAT was such good news that Dean was willing to skip the whole ‘you don’t call guys ‘lovely’’ lecture.  He practically bounded out of bed to the mirror, a wide grin taking over his face as he caught a glimpse of his wings.
When the light receded, Dean had been transported somewhere else. Standing right in front of him was a very startled Sam. Unfortunately Sam happened to be standing in the middle of a vampire nest. He had just chopped off two of the vampire's heads, but there were half a dozen still undead and kicking. However Sam was so started by the sudden appearance of his formerly dead brother that he momentarily forgot about the other vampires.
"Um, Cas and I discovered a bit of a side effect to my resurrection," Dean began.  "There was some sort of unexpected energy transfer between us, and the bottom line is that I've got some weird angel crap going on."
"Can you help Dean? Since he got back from Hell, he...," Sam pleaded. Dean was suddenly reminded of the whole mysterious wing-incident this morning. He groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. Maybe Cas could help him figure it out, but Dean didn't want to admit what had really happened to his brother and Bobby. He didn't want them to know that he'd come back from Hell as some sort of freak. Not that having them attributing his behavior to PTSD was much better, but the hunter version of self-medicating for that was a lot more numbingly pleasant than silver bullets.
"I bet Zachariah made sure the news made it through the grapevine to reach her.  He wouldn't want you to catch her too quickly since he needs to give his assassins time to get to you first," Gabriel replied.
"As in, I had wings!" Dean blurted out, not understanding why Cas wasn't acting like this was a problem.
"It's me, Sammy. It's really me," Dean assured him. The next moment, Dean had his arms full of sasquatch. Dean hugged his brother back tightly as hot wet tears started landing on Dean's back. Dean was probably tearing up a bit too. He thought that he'd never be able to see Sam again. Dean wished he would never have to let go of Sam ever again.
"I don't know, Sam," Dean honestly told him. As far as he'd ever known, angels didn't exist. Not a single hunter had ever come across one. But Cas had claimed to be one of the good guys, and he had done nothing but help so far. More than that, Cas had just saved Sam's life! What kind of monster would resurrect Dean, only to reunite him with his brother and then just leave? What else could even have the juice to do all of this? Dean was in way over his head on this one.
Dean could just imagine the look of surprise on Cas’ face when Dean grabbed one of Cas’ hands with his alula flap.  Dean then spun into Cas’ arms so that Cas was now essentially hugging Dean.  There was a deep rumble from Cas’ voice, but Dean couldn’t make out the words with the earplugs.  He decided to shut Cas up by distracting him.  For some reason, Cas always went crazy from neck kisses, and Dean went right in for the kill.
Dean was mentally exhausted that night, but he was having a hard time actually falling asleep. After drinking more whiskey then he remembered having to drink before (some of his topside memories were a bit hazy after all), Dean eventually fell into a state of semi consciousness. It wasn't the bliss of unconsciousness that he'd been hoping for, but at least the alcohol was enough to keep the Hell memories away. He'd told Sam and Bobby that he couldn't even remember Hell, and maybe if he said it enough times he'd convince himself of that lie too.
“Hey Dean!” Garth greeted enthusiastically.  Dean had forgotten that Garth was a hugger, and barely suppressed a yelp when Garth threw his arms around Dean.  Fortunately, Garth’s arms avoided his backpack and the precious cargo it contained.
"I sense a human female not far from here, still alive," Cas reported, and pointed to the top of a very tall bookcase.  Great – more climbing.  But the good news that Juanita was still alive drove them onward.
How the hell was he supposed to do this for eight hours?  Dean felt like he was going crazy.  He needed a distraction… and the perfect distraction was right in front of him.  Cas was sitting in the passenger seat, and Cas’ wings went right through the seat and right into Dean’s reach.  Dean grinned as he started tenderly stroking Cas’ wings.
"Yeah Cas- um, Castiel talked to me. But his voice seemed to hurt you, and he said something about how most people couldn't hear his True Voice," Dean explained, a tenderness creeping into his voice without him realizing it. Whoever Cas was, he seemed to have a lot of heart. Sam looked disappointed that he couldn't talk to the angel too, but shook it off pretty quickly.
Dean may have passed all the tests Bobby threw at him yesterday, but he probably couldn't do so again now. Humans didn't have wings. Was this some kind of residue from his time in Hell? (Not that they even remotely resembled anything in Hell – rather the opposite – but they were very clearly supernatural and not human.) They reminded him of Cas' wings, but Dean quickly dismissed that thought. There was no way that someone as tainted as Dean could ever have anything in common with an angel.
Dean couldn’t help grinning at how at peace Cas seemed out in nature, and immediately knew that he’d made a good choice for their not-date.  It was a nice early spring morning with perfect temperatures and bright blue skies.  Better yet, they’d set out early enough that the trail wasn’t crowded with other hikers.
“Just being able to see stuff can get you in more trouble than it’s worth sometimes without other stuff to back it up.  It’s not like I’ve got super strength now, or can smite demons, or anything,” Dean grumbled.  While he loved his new ability to see and touch Cas’ wings, he also had some old bad memories of seeing things like fairies and hellhounds that had just made him a target.
“Well, Cas also brings lots of angel strengths to the table.  That’s more for us than the few weaknesses he has,” Dean argued.
"They received word that you have been saved, and they are currently fighting their way back out of Hell. We chose our route into Hell based on schematics that showed an old tunnel to have fallen into ruin from disuse. However the demons anticipated our plan and ambushed us. Had I not accidentally fallen through a weakened spot in the tunnel, it would have taken us many more years to reach you. The new tunnel I found was clearly not well known even by demons. I only came across one demon sneaking through it, and I easily killed her before she could alert anyone to my presence. Since I sent word of what I learned about Hell's geography from the experience, and it should help my brothers and sisters return more quickly," Castiel explained. Dean shuddered and tried not to think too much about the war fought on his behalf, or how very easily it could have turned out very differently. There was no use dwelling on it.
“I successfully captured the demon!  Dean Winchester is safe!” a woman’s voice boosted proudly behind him.  Dean spun around and saw a woman with shoulder length dark hair and very blue eyes.  She held herself almost as stiffly as Cas did, and Dean could sense angel Grace inside her vessel.  The new angel stared right back at Dean, and then her eyes suddenly grew wide with horror and shock.
“You can't run.  Not from me. I'm inside that angsty little noggin of yours,” Alastair sneered, continuing to come closer.  Maybe Dean could successfully gank Alastair with his angel blade if he got close enough, but only if Alastair didn’t see it coming…
After all – when you stick Dean and Cas in a dark room together, and give Sam instructions to leave them alone for a few hours for “training” – what else did you think would happen?
“Awesome,” Dean muttered.  Even though Cas’ flight was instantaneous for humans, Dean always felt a bit sick afterwards.  Sam didn’t seem to suffer quite so much from it.
“If the warding was underground, then I’d also have to be underground to detect it.  Why?” Cas replied.  In response, Dean held up a brochure that had been on the table – one of the local attractions was the Cave of the Winds.
"Don't you get it?  Big brother is behind the whole thing!  Michael is trying to spring Lucifer so he can destroy him once and for all, as was foretold.  The other angels didn't think of this on their own.  They aren't free thinkers like you and me.  We've learned from Our Father's favorite creations – humans.  They haven't.  They are just following Michael's orders, and Michael has convinced himself that he's just following Dad's orders," Gabriel proclaimed with exasperation, flinging his hands around like this should all be extremely obvious.  But Cas just looked shocked, confused, and conflicted.  Dean felt all of that a hundred fold.
"Only some parts of the human eye can detect color, and your brain fills in the gaps in color.  Your brain is probably is doing the same when it is integrating your new eyes with your human ones.  Full angels naturally see a wider spectrum of light than humans can, so it isn't an issue with angels who don't have a human face.  For instance, most angels of a higher rank have more faces than my three, but it is rare that any of them have a human face, and that doesn't hinder them any," Cas explained.
“Don’t insult me – of course I still groom my wings.  I just can’t fully heal them with that sigil by the door blocking all healing abilities,” Balthazar added.  Dean realized that his wings must have made a rude gesture at the ungrateful bastard, and smirked.  It sucked to have someone besides Cas reading all of the emotions that his wings were portraying, but he had to approve of whatever his wings were telling Balthazar because Balthazar was scowling pretty darkly now.
"I have been told that your time in Hell was no accident. Events were manipulated by the forces of Hell for some nefarious purposes. My garrison was sent to retrieve you in order to disrupt Lilith's scheme. Now that you have been successfully returned to the mortal plane, my orders are to assist you in capturing Lilith," Cas explained. Dean's head spun. Why would both Heaven and Hell be fighting over someone as insignificant as him?
“Son of a bitch!” Dean exclaimed when the needles caught on the inside of the backpack when he tried to put it on.  Cas spotted him struggling to carefully unhook the needles without hurting himself, and rushed over to help him.  It took a few minutes to extract Dean’s wings from the backpack, and even the slightest pull on his growing feathers made Dean grind his teeth to avoid crying out in pain.  Damn the wings were sensitive, possibly even more sensitive than before.  It’d be impossible to wear his backpack again until the feathers finished growing in, which could take a while.  In the meantime, Dean would have to do this hunt while staying out of the sight of humans.  Perfect.
"I cannot remove painful memories without harming Dean, but I've heard that over time human memories like that fade...," Cas replied, sounding surprisingly remorseful that he couldn't take Dean's pain away. If that didn't convince everyone that Cas was on their side, Dean wasn't sure what would. Dean was torn between feeling touched by the concern, and pissed that Cas had spilled the beans.
So Dean and Cas decided to save their pie for later and continued on the trail.  Perhaps to distract Dean, Cas started enthusiastically playing nature guide.  Cas talked like he’d memorized an entire encyclopedia about Kansas wildlife, flora and fauna.  While Dean couldn’t quite get into flowers the way Cas could, he enjoyed all of the passion his angel showed for nature.
“Ah yes, well you lot won’t be ready to go after them until you’ve healed up and done a lot more research.  Seriously – if you go in all half-cocked like last time then you’ll be doing it alone.  Meanwhile, I see no harm in me taking some long overdue personal time to find some French girls off of whom I can lick off Nutella,” Balthazar replied, supplying some mental images that Dean would have been happier to have never seen.
“Come on now!  Ratatoskr?  You know, the squirrel who runs up and down Yggdrasil, the world tree?” Gabriel replied.
"The one and only!  But don't spread that around.  I've been in my own private Witness Protection Program for centuries, so call me Loki," Gabriel replied with a flourish, clearly enjoying the spotlight.
"You see? That's just what any smuck claiming to be an angel would say. So tell me – just what makes you so different from every other supernatural son of a bitch that Sammy and I have been hunting our entire lives?" Dean retorted. He could have sworn he could feel the being gazing right through him into his very soul. Dean swallowed, not expecting a good answer. How the Hell was he supposed to gank the biggest and baddest creature he had ever seen? He didn't even have any weapons, and had no clue what he was really up against. The logical side of Dean's mind was screaming at him that whatever the creature wanted him for was probably really bad. But to his great confusion, a feeling in Dean's gut was convinced that this so-called angel was on Dean's side and would never hurt him.
"Do you think Dean lied about not remembering Hell?" Sam whispered, which Dean did not want to hear – nor should he have been able to hear since Sam and Bobby were in the kitchen and Dean was still upstairs. Fan freakin' tastic. As if the wings weren't enough he had to have super hearing too. Well at least he could currently fit through the window. But the best resources he knew of that might be able to help him were in Bobby's library, so Dean decided to stick around and hope he didn't do anything freaky in front of anyone else.
Rather than wait many more generations for the next set of perfect vessels to be born, the easiest solution would be to send Dean back to Hell – and make sure he stayed long enough to break this time. But Zachariah would have to be sneaky about getting Dean back to Hell. If any of the lower ranks caught wind of the real master plan, he might have a mutiny on his hands. No, instead he'd have to outsource the task of murdering Dean to someone who wouldn't be traced back to him....
<Nice to meet you again.  This is Cas.> Dean signed.  Cas was relieved that Dean remembered to use only one finger from each hand to sign “meet” instead of using two fingers on each hand to sign “fuck” instead like he had done during so many practice sessions.
Suddenly Cas put away his extra heads and wings.  The Impala was on its way back to the motel.  The Impala was three blocks away, but with Dean's enhanced hearing he could still hear her approaching.  More time must have passed than Dean realized if Sam was already back with the food.
“I’m glad you can still drive her for a little longer,” Cas replied.  Years of insisting that the Impala was indeed a “her” was finally rubbing off on Cas.
There was the sound of wing beats again, and Cas returned just in the nick of time to catch the tree and prevent it from making Winchester pancakes.  Who knew that a nerdy little guy in a trench coat could lift such a huge tree?  But Cas did more than catch the tree – he threw it across the clearing and beaned the ox square on the nose.  The ox fell over, either dead or unconscious.  A few seconds later the ox evaporated like it had never really been there in the first place.
“That won’t do,” the demon said, sending Sam back to where he started with a flick of his hand.  Dean could see demons’ real faces again for the first time in years, and he tried to push back the memories of the last time he’d been able to do that.  The demon chuckled and took a few steps towards Sam.
“Yeah okay, but this isn’t a damn petting zoo, so…,” Dean began, feeling the need to keep this moment from getting too touchy-feely (literally).
"Here – try these," Sam offered with a laugh as he tossed Dean a package of nuts.  Dean managed to catch the bag (he was getting the hang of piecing together what all of his eyes were seeing into one coherent picture).
"Dean!" Sam exclaimed in surprise, breaking the mood.  Dean wished the sasquatch had slept longer, but the alarm in Sam's voice made Dean wonder if there was something besides the wings that Sam was reacting to.
“It’s not in great shape – I think they were running some tests on it . . . ,” Sam started to comment, but stopped when he noticed the look on Cas’ face.
“I can sense multiple different warded areas in various parts of the cave.  I suspect that some of them are decoys,” Cas reported.  Dean swore.  Of course it couldn’t be that easy.  When did Winchesters ever have good luck and easy hunts?
"When you learn more control, you will be able to use your other eyes without manifesting your other heads," Cas told him.
Cas moaned.  The taste of Dean was even better than he could ever have imagined.  Sparkles of pleasure were dancing everywhere that Dean was touching - his lips, his tongue, everywhere inside his mouth, and even his hair (where Dean’s fingers had started petting and caressing).  The sensations were overwhelming, but Cas tried to copy Dean’s technique so he could give back as good as he was getting.  Dean seemed to enjoy whatever he was doing if the delightful little noises he was making was any indication.
Just as the bedroom door was opening, Dean suddenly felt his new wings suck themselves back into his back like they'd never even been there in the first place. The sudden loss of the wings threw Dean off balance and he face planted on the floor, with one of his legs still hanging halfway out the window. And no, Dean was never going to ever admit to the unmanly yelp he made from the surprise and pain of the awkward position he found himself in.
“Not to worry – so long as we keep Dean-o here from going back to Hell, Sammy will never have to play his role in the apocalypse either,” Gabriel replied.  If that was meant to be reassuring, it wasn’t.  It only served to scare the crap out of them more to know that Sam was being manipulated by the angels just like Dean.  But they’d cross that bridge when they came to it – hopefully never.
"Very likely, if we haven't already captured her first. Would you like to rejoin your family now?" Cas offered, raising two fingers, but this time waiting for Dean's response before pressing them to Dean's forehead.
"Cas? As in the angel who saved you from Hell?" Sam asked, lowering his shotgun and staring at Cas in awe. "I thought you said he was a giant made of light?" Dean picked up on the unspoken question of how had he recognized Cas in this new form, but didn't think the answer of 'he feels like Cas' would win him any points.
“Try to kill Lilith before the angels catch wind of your change in plans, since as the human of the group you can’t manifest any weapons that could kill an angel,” Gabriel replied.  Gabriel’s eyes briefly flicked over to Dean for a moment, reaffirming his implications.  Gabriel knew that Dean was part angel now, and he thought that he could manifest a blade like the one that Cas had manifested a few times.
Wings.  Dean hadn't managed to manifest them on command before, but there had never been a moment where he wanted wings more than he did right now.  He reached inside, deep within his soul where he could still feel the energy of his wings, and begged them to come out.
"I mean, I've saved some people, okay? I figured that made up for the stealing and the ditching chicks. But why do I deserve to get saved? I'm just a regular guy," Dean protested.
"Really, Sam?" Dean asked.  His coyote head rolled its eyes, but his squirrel part eagerly sniffed at the nuts, so with a sigh from his human mouth he fed some nuts to his squirrel mouth.  They were surprisingly good.
“The angels aren’t attacking Dean directly.  Zachariah, a pompous dickwad in middle management, decided to outsource the assassination so that none of his foot soldiers would ever be the wiser that he’s trying to start the apocalypse instead of stop it.  But unfortunately for him, he made the mistake of unknowingly approaching my peeps – the tricksters.  Once word got around to me what he was trying to do, I told them all to stand down,” Gabriel explained.
"Since Dean is still mostly human, it should be safe for you to see them, but he has yet to learn how to manifest them at will," Cas replied.
"I take it this wasn't you?" Dean asked. Between how shocked Sam was and the fact that the being that had rescued Dean couldn't even talk to Sam, it was looking a lot less likely that Sam had done something stupid like sell his soul to bust Dean out.
Dean had dumped Sam’s rabbit food into the stew he made, where it was coated with so much gravy and hot sauce that you could hardly still tell that it was vegetables.  Sam made a bit of a face at this, but wisely didn’t comment.  Just because Sam, now the sole grocery shopper in the family, was forcing Dean to eat more vegetables, this didn’t mean that they still had to taste like vegetables.  Dean was quite proud of all the ways he came up with to avoid eating salad.
“They found all of my lock picks,” Sam complained when he noticed that Dean was awake.  “Even the ones I sewed into my jacket sleeve cuffs!”  Well, shit.  These demons were smarter than average then.
Meanwhile Sam was bouncing like a puppy as he shepherded Dean and Cas outside so they could greet Eileen when she arrived.  They didn’t have to wait long before Eileen showed up.
“Caves are cold Dean – you’ll need layers and a jacket,” Sam insisted.  The fact that Sam was annoyingly right didn’t stop Dean from mumbling under his breath as he finished getting ready.
The next thing Dean knew, there was a flutter of feathers and Dean was laying in his own bed.  Cas was curled up next to him, and Cas draped his wings over Dean as the world’s best blanket.  Dean breathed in the sweet smell of Cas’ feathers and then surrendered to sleep.
“I like these shirts.  Very practical,” Cas announced with a smile, flexing his wings slightly.  Dean groaned and closed his eyes, rubbing the spot between his eyebrows.
“Yeah – I’ve got that effect,” Dean teased with a smirk.  He liked driving Cas wild, so who’s complaining?
"Angelic Grace has wing buds through which our wings can be manifested. When I raised you from Perdition, your soul clung to me tighter than anticipated. I suspect it came from how close you were to breaking, and your desperation to be saved. As a result our energies bonded and influenced each other on a quantum level," Cas explained. Dean's head spun as he tried to wrap his head around this.
The smell of sulfur grew stronger and stronger the closer they got to the hot springs.  There were lots of pools of water in this part of the cave.  Sam started shivering a little, saying that the water that kept dripping on him was making him colder in the already cold and windy cave.  Dean didn’t really notice the cold, so he insisted that Sam take his jacket.  Even with one less layer on Dean still didn’t feel the least bit cold.  Huh.  Something to add to the growing list of angel questions for when they got back.
“There are no demons nearby, but wait until I finish healing Dean’s wings.  You have limited batteries,” Cas replied, oblivious to the new realization that Dean was experiencing.  As his wings slowly healed, Dean felt like the cave came more into focus.  Maybe that was part of why Cas insisted on wing-care before battle – he was partially blind with injured wings.
"No, that can't be true.  Heaven is just.  Heaven wouldn't condemn an innocent man back to Hell and intentionally destroy all life on Earth," Cas insisted.
Zachariah was royally pissed. Somehow Castiel had gotten separated from the rest of the garrison, and as luck would have it, Castiel had saved the Righteous Man ahead of schedule. After all Zachariah's careful planning to make sure the angels took a route through Hell that would prevent them from rescuing Dean on time, and one insignificant little seraph had accidentally ruined everything! Dean hadn't broken the First Seal yet, so now they had to start all over.
An hour later, Dean still hadn’t been able to consciously feel Cas touch the energy around his wing.  The only touches that Dean got were when he successfully batted Cas’ hand with his wing.  But whenever Dean tried too hard or overthought things, he missed by a mile.  It went much better when he just reacted purely by instinct and didn’t really think about it at all.  Dean wasn’t sure if Cas’ continued teasing was helping him or hurting him.  Sometimes having too strong of a desire to catch Cas could trip him up too.  He could’ve sworn that Cas also started moving his hand faster after a while.
“Hey – do you smell sulfur?” Dean asked as he sniffed one of the two tunnels that Cas had been referring to.  Just because he didn’t have his angel senses working at the moment didn’t mean that he couldn’t make his other five senses useful.
Cas shifted Dean back to the physical world so that Dean arrived laying down on his bed.  The shift sucked even more than last time.  Dean had a moment of panic when the shift triggered memories of fighting his way through the ward, but Dean had a lot of experience with flashbacks and shoved the memories back down quickly.  His remaining pain was worse in the physical world than it had been just a moment ago, and on Dean’s first breath he coughed up some blood.
Against all odds and logic, Dean made it to the surface after digging through six feet of solidly packed dirt – all before he suffocated. The dirt was rock hard, and yet Dean had somehow managed to slice through it like butter. Clearly today was not going to be one of those days when the world made sense. He'd made it out of Hell, and had no luck left to spare for a logical explanation. Hell, after this kind of ultimate jail break, Dean would be lucky if his life would ever make sense again.
"Woah wait – kill you?" Dean asked in alarm.  Even though he'd really just met Cas, he realized that he'd be devastated if anything happened to him.  Perhaps it was the strange bond or whatever, but Dean already felt like Cas was part of him in a way he didn't understand yet.  Dean would never forgive himself if Cas was killed just because Dean had clung too tight and somehow bonded to the angel.
I’ve got all the ingredients for you to make burgers tonight.  Want me to pick you up anything else while I’m at the store?
Dean’s milkshakes in no way resembled Sam’s “health food” smoothies.  Sam liked to include ingredients like kale, almond milk, and lots of fresh vegetables.  Dean liked to use pie filling with some milk, chocolate sauce, and crumbled graham crackers - essentially pie in a cup.
“Dean, it would take a few hundred rocks with precise tosses to break all of those wards, and that is optimistically assuming that there aren’t more wards painted inside,” Cas told him.  Sometimes, Dean really hated it when Cas was right.  Dean couldn’t do this job without the help of someone who was more human than him.  Feeling his wings drooping subconsciously with his mood, Dean reluctantly dug out his cell phone.
“Yeah, I hear you ‘training’.  These walls aren’t that thick,” Sam retorted with an eye roll as he showed Dean the new package of ear plugs he’d just bought.
Both Cas and Balthazar were trying not to flinch (and failing) while listening to these words.  Even with his limited experiences at being part-angel, Dean knew that bringing too much of an angel’s form into the physical world was a bad thing.  Keeping the angels away from their home dimension was pretty bad too – Dean was trying to ignore the new part of him that also craved to go back to that seraphic dimension, but in the back of his mind he knew that it was there.
<You & me - make out?> Cas signed.  Would Dean recognize what Cas said or would he mix it up with making coffee?  The answer was pretty clear when Dean’s beautiful green eyes nearly popped out of his head.
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but the feeling of Cas and Sam going through his wings and removing all of his loose feathers felt pretty awesome.  Even without looking, Dean could easily tell if each touch was Sam or Cas because they both felt so completely different.  Cas was a lot better behaved than during all the teasing earlier, and didn’t do anything that would have made Sam uncomfortable to be around them.  Instead, all the gentle touches were just lulling Dean into a more and more relaxed state, and he caught himself starting to nod off a few times.  Dean was aware of Cas and Sam talking quietly amongst themselves, but he wasn’t really listening – something about wing oil and how that wasn’t something Cas planned to teach Sam.
"Hello Dean," Cas greeted, and wow if that deep voice wasn't just as impressive as Cas' True Voice. Dean found himself staring with his mouth agape at the nerdy looking, but surprisingly hot, angel before him. Those vivid blue eyes alone...
“I’m fine,” Cas insisted, his voice a full octave lower than usual, and boy did that voice do things to Dean.  Dean felt his whole body shiver, and some of that shiver must have passed on to Cas’ wings where Dean was touching them, because Cas chose that moment to let out a low moan.  Sam’s eyes practically popped out of his head when he realized what they were doing.
“It appears that there are also wards on the inside of the exterior walls as well.  I was unable to sense them before.  Dean and I will not be able to go inside with you, and if those wards are likewise invisible to humans then you will not be able to locate and break them,” Cas reported.  Dean swore.  All that work for nothing – he still couldn’t go inside.  Waiting there was pure torture.  Dean kept checking the time every two minutes, wondering what they would do if Sam and Garth didn’t come back out.
Time passed slowly here.  It didn’t help that the only indicators of time was the progress Cas was making in healing Dean.  By the time that the pain level had dropped from excruciating to the level where Winchesters would take an aspirin (and civilians would go to a doctor), Dean could feel his wings start to try twitching again.  But Cas’ arms were keeping Dean’s wings very tightly pinned in place, so his wings struggled in vain.
"Are you and your boyfriend sharing those morning bowls of Wheaties?" Shayna asked.  Dean suddenly felt very self-conscious about Shayna and Henriksen gawking at his wings, but he wasn't feeling comfortable enough to put them away.
The three civilians offered their help in the final battle, but Sam and Dean both turned them down.  Once you were in The Life there was no way out, so it was better to not let civilians get in too deep in the first place.  But it was nice to get some of rare ‘thank you for your help’ type speeches that most civilians were too busy screaming and running away to bother with.
“Dean!” Sam was beside him faster than he could blink.  Poor Sam looked worried sick, but he looked healthy and completely healed so Dean couldn’t help a small grin.
“This still isn’t the real you, is it,” Dean stated, not really meaning it as a question since Cas didn’t really seem all that different from usual.
Sam took the first shift driving, since it was still daylight, while Dean laid down out of sight in the backseat.  Every single bump on the road sent tingly vibrations through Dean’s wings.  At first Dean tried to think of it as a novelty – maybe if he just closed his eyes and relaxed he could pretend that it was angel-style magic fingers.  But these vibrations just didn’t give him the same kind of pleasure as Cas touching his wings did.  This just felt like sensory overload since his new “pin feathers” seemed to amplify vibrations much more than his down feathers did.  Dean felt an onset of a headache coming on, probably from his brain trying to figure out how to interpret these new sensations.
"Wait! Wait! It's just Cas!" Dean shouted, throwing himself in between the guns and the now trench coat clad angel. He had no idea if guns could hurt an angel, but he wasn't about to let them test that on Cas. A few sparks were still flying from the exploding lightbulbs, but Cas looked completely casual about the effect he was having on the room.
Nothing quite makes you feel small like being able to fit through a crack in the door.  To everyone's relief, there were no more giants inside (that they could see anyways).  Shayna reported only seeing two giants on her previous trip, but that didn't mean there weren't more somewhere.  Dean felt like a tiny little mouse, or maybe even a cockroach, scurrying around someone's house and hoping to not be stepped on.
“The point is that they don’t make open-back shirts for guys!  Besides, it’s not like anyone is going to see you since you can’t leave the Bunker,” Sam argued.
Dean dragged himself out of unconsciousness slowly.  He could sense Cas and Balthazar nearby, but beyond that he couldn’t sense anything because they were surrounded by angel warding.  With a start he realized that he couldn’t sense Sam, and that terrifying thought was enough of a jolt to restore full alertness.  Dean opened his eyes and scanned the room.  The cavern that they were in was dimly lit, but Dean could make out Sam on the other side of the cavern, shackled to a chair.  Sam had regained consciousness too, and was squirming in an attempt to get out of the chains.  Dean looked for demons, but they appeared to be alone for now.  Some thick-looking doors had even been built into the cavern, closing them off from the rest of the cave.  They were completely blocked off from even the wind that had been ever present since they first ventured underground.  There were a few wards painted on the walls, some that Dean recognized and some that he had never seen before.
Consciously letting his other faces out was still a little harder, but now that Dean had gotten the hang of manifesting his wings, the skill mostly transferred to his new faces.  Going from two eyes to six eyes was still disorienting at first, but Dean adapted more quickly this time around.  It was kinda nice actually.  Dean felt like he'd been wearing blinders all day and now he could finally really see.
"Shh – it's okay Cas.  We're alive.  We're okay," Dean soothed.  Cas nodded, the corner of his lips raising upwards in looked like a weak attempt at a smile.
"Sammy's role in the apocalypse has been pretty much kept to a need to know basis.  Lilith would probably still hunt him for her own reasons if she thought she could kill him," Gabriel explained.
“Dean!  Are you alright?” Sam frantically whispered, crouching down next to him.  Even though he was talking quietly in case there were any demons nearby, his voice still caused very faint echoes in the cave.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas spotted Dean wiggling his eyebrows at Sam.  This was something Dean sometimes did when he thought that Sam was going to “get lucky” today.  Sam pointedly ignored Dean’s eyebrow wiggle, and Eileen didn’t see it since she was facing the other direction.
"Well, yeah, okay. Um, I seem to be experiencing some strange physical side effects," Dean began. Cas tilted his head in confusion as he studied Dean. (It was in no way adorable because Dean didn't call anything adorable!)
"I don't make the rules," Gabriel cut Sam off.  "Castiel – how about you teach your new beau how to manifest an angel blade while we strategize a way to inveigle Lilith."
No – that was wrong. Alastair was playing with his head again, trying to make Dean think that he had already broken. It was cleaver really. If Alastair managed to convince Dean that Dean was already enjoying torturing other victims, then maybe Dean might not object the next time Alastair offered him a blade. But no matter how hard Alastair tried to trick Dean with the illusions, Dean could still tell when what he was experiencing wasn't real.
Dean tried to close his eyes to it all, but discovered the hard way that he could still see even with his eyes closed.  He could still see the dark red insubstantial scenery they were moving past.  He could still see Sam’s time-frozen form being pulled along with them (which looked creepy as hell).  Dean instead tried to focus on Cas.  As they moved faster, the energy around Cas shifted color.  In flight, Cas looked bright blue (which kind of suited him).  Watching Cas fly was fascinating.  All of Cas’ movements were both graceful and powerful.
"Cas!" Dean called, ignoring how Henriksen was gaping at the spot where Cas had been a second ago.  Dean could still sense that Cas was nearby, but couldn't tell where he had gone.
“Before we leave, we must first finish grooming your wings,” Cas continued.  Dean blinked at him in surprise.
"Dean?  But why?  Hasn't he been through...?" Sam protested.  Dean frowned at the worried glance that Sam sent his way, almost like he didn't think Dean could do it.  But just because their last encounter had gone horribly wrong didn't mean this time would.  They were going in much better prepared now, with lots more knowledge and much stronger allies.
“Depending on which of these two tunnels we take first, we could check out one of these two next, then backtrack and go to the other one.  The rest of them are much further away,” Cas deduced as he gestured to locations on Sam’s map.
"Help!" Dean tried calling weakly, hoping that if Sam was on the surface he could hear him. Dean was going to tear his idiot brother a new one for whatever he did to bring Dean back, since there was no way he could have done it without some horrible strings attached.
“Dean, I know it sucks to travel that way, but we’d save a lot of time if Cas could just fly us up there,” Sam suggested.
“My, my, has little Castiel grown up,” Gabriel beamed proudly, interrupting the moment.  Dean still thought that Gabriel was a bag of dicks, but he was Cas’ brother, and he was helping them, so Dean would reluctantly tolerate him.
“Yes, yes – I know that you and your… pet half-angel came through for me in the end.  But it’s going to take time for me to trust you again, Cassie,” Balthazar told him.
"Stay here – I'll handle this," Cas told them.  A silver blade slipped into his hand, but that pig-sticker looked tiny compared to the rampaging ox.
"So if I can find a weapon that can kill her, and I lure her into a trap...," Sam speculated eagerly.
Dean almost didn’t even notice when their feet left the ground.  Take-off was so completely effortless and smooth that Dean didn’t even really feel it.  Sure, Dean could see and feel Cas’ wings flapping to propel them, but it felt more like the ground had just dropped away.  The human part of Dean started panicking like crazy.  But the angel part of Dean was completely relaxed and comfortable with this, and wanted badly to start flapping his own wings alongside Cas.  The paradox of it was actually kind of creepy.  On one hand he was facing one of his greatest phobias, and on the other it felt like he was coming home.  God, his life was crazy sometimes.  It made his head spin to have two parts of himself at complete opposite ends of the spectrum like that.
"Eggs and coffee will be ready in five," Sam replied. Dean breathed a small sigh of relief when the sasquatch thundered back down the stairs. However, now he had something else to worry about.
“I wasn’t trying to fly, I was trying not to fall.  It was a reflex.  Try to warn a guy next time,” Dean grumbled.
“Uh… I can’t fly,” Dean stuttered, feeling like an idiot.  Way to latch onto the least important part and avoid any of the other issues.
Dean instantly knew that Sam was home, not just from the sounds of doors slamming, but from the delicious smell that was wafting through the bunker.  Mouth watering, Dean was racing through the halls of the bunker in a split second.  Sure enough – in addition to a few grocery bags, Sam was also carrying a pie.
“Why…?” Dean tried to ask, his voice coming out a lot deeper and more forced than usual, like he had something painful stuck in his throat.  He wanted to brush away Cas’ tears with his fingers, but his arm was still to weak and heavy to do more than a slight twitch.
Dean looked deep into Cas’ eyes with a silent plea for Cas to believe.  After all, Dean had forgiven Cas for all the shit that had gone down during that time.  Surely Balthazar could forgive Cas too?  Family meant forgiving people when they screwed up, and Cas and Balthazar were family.  Dean wanted nothing more than to wipe all the pain and guilt from Cas’ face so that his twinkling sapphires would never be darkened by those painful emotions again.  A small glimmer of hope appeared in Cas’ return gaze.  It wasn’t much, but Dean would take what he could get.  They’d find a way to fix this.
“What?”  Dean asked when he caught a glance of Cas’ bemused expression.  Cas’ sleek dark wings also seemed to glisten in the sunlight, and the blue feather tips looked even more vibrant than usual.
"Dean? You okay in there?" Sam called through the bedroom door. The noise Dean had made while fumbling around must have alerted Sam. Fortunately Sam had learned (the hard way) long ago to never just barge in when Dean was making strange noises in the bedroom.
“I’ll uh, take Sam back to his hotel room,” Balthazar was saying.  Dean then watched the weird sight of Balthazar and Sam shifting back to the physical world.  They both slowly became bright red swirls of energy that otherwise seemed frozen in time along with the dark red background.
“Jeez, Dean,” Sam continued in shock at his probably horrific expression.  “You are looking like I just suggested castration.”  Then Sam gaped at Dean when he realized that to Dean both ideas were too terrible to imagine.
Dean ended up sleeping away most of the car ride, but he fidgeted like crazy for the part he was awake for.  Dean thought he’d lose his mind before it was finally dark enough for him to move into the driver’s seat.  Because of his wings, he had to move the bench back as far as it went and just perch on the edge of the seat.  Sam was perfectly happy with this, as it allowed him to stretch out his abnormally long legs.  On the other hand, Dean felt very uncomfortable and awkward doing what was once one of the most relaxing and normal things in the world for him.
“Nice work, Dean.  We’ll take a break for dinner and practice again tomorrow,” Cas said, and he finally placed his hand on Dean’s wing.  Dean moaned and his touch-starved wing leaned into the touch.  But, just as quickly, Cas removed his hand to head for the door.  Dean couldn’t help it – he downright whined at the loss.  Cas’ teasing was going to be the death of him.
Then Cas suddenly stopped in his tracks.  The angel frowned and squinted his eyes with a concerned head tilt like he was paying attention to something only he was aware of.  Dean held his breath as he waited for Cas to fill him in, dreading whatever kind of bad news it was.
<We need to be quick.  Sam wants us to clean> Dean signed back with another eye roll before perking up with an idea.  <Want milkshakes?>
“Hold up – I thought I couldn’t be flown while I was fledging,” Dean quickly interjected, dreading the answer he suspected was coming.
“Oh I see – this is because Dean made your laptop show that blue screen that you didn’t like,” Cas realized.  Dean hadn’t even heard Cas come in behind him, but now he eagerly turned to Cas in hopes that he could get some support.  After all, pie depended on it.
"Jerk," Sam replied with an eye roll and a small smile.  Together they started their accent once again.
"Are you saying that you'd sooner let Dean go back to Hell that risk exposing yourself?" Cas demanded.  Cas looked surprisingly intimidating, despite rocking the holy tax accountant look, but to Gabriel's credit he didn't even flinch.
While Garth’s complete sincerity was touching, Dean felt himself turning red.  This was definitely starting to feel way too much like a chick-flick moment.  Did he really stare at Cas as much as Sam (and now Kevin and Garth too) seemed to think?  He could feel Cas staring at him now, and it took a surprising amount of effort not to meet his angel’s gaze.  Instead he shifted uncomfortably and coughed, gesturing in the direction of the warded building.
However that wasn't what attracted Dean's attention the most when they arrived at the small forest clearing.
“Wouldn’t that be a good way to mask demon sulfur with natural sulfur?  Let’s try that way first,” Dean suggested.  He sighed as he crumbled up the his last empty food wrapper and shoved it into the bottom of his pack with the others.  Cas, always one for noticing every little thing that Dean did, immediately started digging in his own pack for something.
“Awesome – then while you’re out you can buy us a few packs of condoms, a whole case of Astroglide and . . . ,” Dean pretended to casually suggest, but of course Sam caught on.
"Did you not wish to talk privately?" Cas asked, seemingly puzzled by why Dean might object by being spontaneously flown to the middle of nowhere. But Dean recovered from the surprise quickly.
Silence and darkness.  Dean had to take a few deep breaths to remind himself that he was safe with Cas in the Bunker.  Dean’s remaining senses went into overdrive, but he still wasn’t getting any kind of mental image of where Cas was.  He could feel the slight air displacement as Cas moved, and he had his instincts.  Between them, his accuracy rate wasn’t half bad.  It may not have been what Cas was looking for, but it still made for good practice – with the reward of getting to briefly touch Cas with his wings.
But somehow Dean sensed that Sam wasn't there. There were no humans for miles. How the hell did he know that? Dean didn't have time to worry about that when he had a much more immediate problem to deal with. If there was nobody around, then Dean was all on his own to somehow dig himself out of his own coffin.
Time had no meaning anymore in Hell. It was just another day with another victim on the rack in front of Dean. He had long since stopped caring about who they were. So long as they were the ones hurting, he would be distracted from his own pain, which would otherwise consume him. It was better if he didn't let himself think or feel.
“So get this,” Sam announced as they ate.  “The writing on the walls of that cave was some kind of code, and I found an old manuscript that shows how to break it.  The code was commonly used by medieval demon orders in Prague….”
Finally!  After all that practice, Dean was finally able to consciously feel it when Cas touched his energy.  Dean wasn’t sure if it was just time and practice, or if it had to do with his new feathers, or if it had something to do with spending so much time just as energy while Cas healed him.  In any case, Cas was too eager and excited to let Dean process for very long.
Dean and Sam both gaped at Cas in disbelief.  Sam was looking at Cas with full-on puppy dog eyes of pity, clearly worrying both about what if Cas was right, and what if Cas was losing it.
“I suspected, but I knew you’d charge in regardless of anything I said,” Cas replied cooly.  Dean couldn’t argue with that.  Cas knew him all too well.  Besides, he really shouldn’t be taking his anger out on Cas.  None of this was Cas’ fault.
"I thought this might have been your doing!" Sam shouted angrily as he drew a wooden stake from his inner jacket pocket.
"You're angelic parts should not require substance – any nourishment passed through them would just be transferred back to your vessel," Cas explained.
“I’m fine,” Cas insisted unconvincingly.  “It was just an information spell.  I’m not surprised you felt it too.”
“Okay let’s do this,” Dean said once there was nothing else to put off flying with Cas any longer.  He braced himself.
And of course two giants sleeping not far from the top of the beanstalk on either side of the yellow brick road leading up to the castle.  So much for any minuscule hope Dean had for not having to face the giants.  He wasn't very confident that they could sneak past the giants without either of them waking up.  Dean had thought that the huge Blue Ox that had attacked him yesterday had been big, but now he had to seriously reconsider his definition of big.  The Blue Ox was proportionally the size of a cat compared to these giants, maybe even a kitten.  That made humans no more than bite-sized morsels compared to these monsters.
“Okay, coyote I get – he’s one of the most famous tricksters I’ve heard of, but a squirrel?” Dean questioned.
The pulsing of energy beneath Cas’ skin was definitely much more apparent from this position.  Way too apparent actually.  How was Dean supposed to concentrate on angel blade lessons with Cas’ body pressed up against him like this?  Part of Dean’s traitorous mind kept drifting to a very different kind of ‘angel blade’ that he’d rather be focused on getting to know.
Dean coughed and crossed his legs awkwardly when he realized that he'd been transfixed by the gorgeous spread of Cas' wings.  Maybe Dean's new form liked Cas' True Form a little too much.  For once in his life he needed to slow down and figure this out.  If Cas realized the effect that he was having on Dean, the bastard gave no indication of it.  Cas just sat there intently studying Dean while fanning his feathers.  Dean bit his lip and tried to think of a conversation starter, but his big brain (big brains?) was having a hard time doing the thinking when Cas was looking like that.
Just like that, Dean knew that the being was gone. Dean had surprisingly mixed feelings about that, but he didn't have time to dwell on that now. Sam was hurt, and that took priority over everything.
“What does Lilith want?  Aside from the apocalypse of course.  Is there a way to get her to come to you?” Juanita asked.
Fortunately, the abandoned hunting cabin and pile of kindling that Dean ‘accidentally’ stumbled across was exactly where it was supposed to be.  The pile of kindling was even old enough to have acquired a thick layer of moss on top – perfect for a quick fire starter.  Dean was quite relieved that he hadn’t gotten direction turned in the dark.  With a flick of his lighter, Dean set the pile of kindling on fire.
Cas clearly also loved watching the birds soaring high in the sky, but he also was enthralled by another type of flyer that Dean preferred to keep his distance from: bees.  Cas was clearly just as carefree and relaxed around bees (including the stinger ends) now as when he showed up on the Impala one time completely covered in bees.  The bees particularly loved the handful of “flowers with exceptional pollin” that Cas had collected along the way.  Cas looked like he was about to offer the bouquet to Dean, but stopped short when he saw the way that Dean was warily eying the bees buzzing around the flowers.  Cas looked a bit disappointed, but to Dean’s relief he didn’t push him to get acquainted with his little stingered friends.  Cas kept the flowers though, and Dean suspected that Cas would give them to him later after the bees grew tired of them.  It was an incredibly corny thing to do on a not-date, but somehow Dean didn’t mind it coming from Cas.
The adrenalin from the fight kept them going long enough to cross a few more state lines before trying again to stop for the night.  They had thought about pushing on to try to make it to Macon, Georgia in one go, but everyone was pretty cranky after so many hours on the road.  At least this time the motel they tried was free of any supernatural creatures.  Cas offered to ward the room for them, and Dean was grateful as he passed out on top of the comforters.
<Both Winchesters enrolled in an ASL class in Lawrence.  I’ve helped both of them practice at home.  Sam in particular stayed up late many nights to study.> Cas signed.
“You want me,” Cas interpreted unnecessarily.  Dean chuckled.  His wings had no concept of subtlety, did they?
“After two weeks of being stuck in this bunker, anyplace with fresh air sounds good.  Besides, Cas loves that nature stuff.  We could pack a lunch, and . . .” Dean replied enthusiastically.
Dean collapsed the rest of the way to the floor, unable to move.  The pain hadn’t gone away when the ward broke.  Dean felt like he could barely breathe.  His heart felt strained as it pumped irregularly in his chest.  Maybe he should have listened to Sam about eating more heart-healthy foods…
Dean reluctantly unfolded the wings that were wrapped around him so he could sit up.  But when he opened his eyes, the room suddenly felt like it was spinning around him.  No, that wasn't it – it was like he was seeing the room from multiple different angles at once.
“Hannah!  What are you doing?” a new angry voice rang out.  An angel wearing a smug looking businessman had arrived, and his face was red with fury.
“Cas, stop,” Dean said, gently pulling the dusty old books Cas was reading away from him.  Cas looked like he was going to protest until he saw the look in Dean’s eyes (and probably whatever his wings were expressing, too).  Dean took a deep breath and did one of the things that he always struggled with – opening up about his feelings.  But Cas was worth it.
The trunk of the beanstalk was as large as a fully grown redwood tree, with thick vines cascading down the sides.  It was hard to tell just how tall the beanstalk was, but it seemed like it was a few miles tall.  Cas could probably tell them down the centimeter just how tall the beanstalk was, but Dean didn't ask because he honestly didn't want to know.  The best way to the top was just to keep focusing on putting one hand in front of the other, and not to think about just how high they were.  Dean thought he might be sick if he thought too much about it.  He hummed Metallica to himself to cool his nerves, and give himself something else to focus on besides the climb.
"I have my angel blade, but without knowing what exactly it is that we are facing, I don't know what weapons would be most efficient.  Whatever is behind this must be very powerful to have manifested something like this, so I doubt any of your guns or knives would be of much use," Cas told him.
“I’m fine Sam – didn’t hurt at all,” Dean truthfully reassured him.  The spot where the feathers had come out actually felt a little bit better, or at least less itchy.
Dean was now very sure that the clouds signified the top of the beanstalk, because he could see the clouds shake from what sounded like a giant walking on top of them.  Everyone froze in place, not daring to make a sound.  But after a few more thuds, everything grew quiet.  Was the giant gone?  Sam must have thought so, because Sam started to carefully climb again...
"I don't, but I know who does.  I created this pocket dimension so that we could talk privately.  In fact, the human lovers and their cousin are free to go," Gabriel explained, and with a snap of his fingers Juanita was out of the jewelry box, where she was quickly embraced by Shayna.  "I dematerialized the giants, so it should be clear sailing for you kids all the way home."
“Poor little warded angel – don’t you know that exorcisms and angel spells can’t work through wards?  Well, I always did hear that Sam was the smart one.  No wonder he figured out how to hide his wings first,” the demon mocked him.  Dean felt his face heat up as he glared back at the demon.  Dean thought that there was probably some truth to that – if Sam had been the one with wings, Sam probably would have learned how to hide them by now.  But Sam was human, and only in danger now because he’d helped Dean groom his wings earlier and gotten Dean’s wing oil on his hands.
“Unkempt?” Dean repeated with skepticism.  But the look of determination on Cas’ face made Dean realize that there was no arguing with him on this.  With three pairs of hands on his wings, they made short work of the grooming job.  It was far more rushed and mechanical than Dean would have liked, but it would do in a pinch.
“I didn’t think psychics and angels mixed,” Dean commented, but he internally cursed himself when he saw how the reminder of what happened to Pamela made Cas flinch.  But Cas recovered in a blink of an eye.
“You’ve become angel enough for the warding to be effective,” Cas explained with a sigh.  “As I’ve mentioned, part of you now exists on the seraphic plane of existence in addition to the physical one, and the angel warding is designed to block everyone who has access to that plane.”
"Yeah, well – the only thing big enough to distract a giant is another giant, so you're welcome," Dean replied.
“Come on Sammy – you’ve seen worse PDA at the average mall,” Dean said as he started stroking Cas’ wing again.  However Sam was having none of it.  Sam pulled the car over to the side of the road, then spun around and glared at Dean.
An overwhelming sense of horror from that thought filled Dean.  He violently shuddered, and could feel his wings hugging his back closely as if they were afraid of being cut off.
Castiel, Angel of the Lord, had endured many difficult things over his billions of years of existence.  But the way that Dean was pumping his mouth up and down the straw while sucking and making all kinds of indecent little moans of pleasure - that was redefining Cas’ understanding of torture.
"He sure that none of the Feds are watching the area?  I didn't get sprung from the hot box just to have the wrong people recognize us and figure out we're still alive," Dean asked.
“Does this mean that Dean’s wings have stopped growing?” Sam asked, and Dean’s stomach plummeted at the thought.  He didn’t want to be stuck with little wings – he wanted big warrior wings like Cas.
"You are too tense. This isn't something you can force," Cas told him. "What were you doing the last time you manifested them?"
“Besides,” Sam continued, “I’ve offered to let Cas come with me on my shopping trips, but he says he doesn’t want to until you’ve learned to cloak your wings so you can join us.”  While Dean appreciated Cas’ consideration, it only made him feel more guilty about being the reason why Cas wasn’t going outside.
The Winchesters only had about a week until the next new moon, the date their plan would spring into action.  What were the chances that they could pull this off smoothly?
"Cas? You actually spoke to the angel?" Sam asked incredulously. Well at least Sam was now distracted from his painful memories. Geek boy was back. Dean rolled his eyes good naturedly.
The ring of dead trees around his grave was not a good start to that. Dean had never seen anything like that before.
“Dean!  I don’t need details!  Whatever you guys wanna do is cool,” Sam jumped in.  Dean rolled his eyes at how squeamish Sam could be, even when there wasn’t much to be squeamish about (yet).
“Hey Cas – would you be able to detect the angel warding if it was underground?” Dean asked between bites.
"Dean, stop constantly turning your head like that – people are going to think you're paranoid," Sam whispered as they got to where they were going to meet Henriksen.  Dean hadn't even realized that he'd started doing that to compensate for only having two eyes.  He felt strangely blind having such a narrow field of vision, and it wasn't helping that he was still nervous about meeting up with Henriksen again.  Sure, the dude had finally realized that they were the good guys, but that didn't mean his FBI buddies would see it that way if any of them were monitoring Henriksen.  Then of course there was whatever supernatural creature who was hunting Dean to worry about.
"I wouldn't put it past Dean to lie about it if he did remember. If that was PTSD..." Bobby whispered back, and okay Dean needed to put a stop to their psychological analysis of him. He probably did have some PTSD, but the topic was not up for discussion – he was just going to bury it down and carry on like he always did. Dean tromped down the stairs very loudly and started shoveling scrambled eggs in his mouth like he hadn't eaten in a week. Sam and Bobby went silent as soon as he entered the room, just as he had hoped.
Cas brought his wings out as well, and wow – Dean hadn't really had a chance to fully appreciate them before.  While Dean's wings were an iridescent hunter green, Cas' wings were a majestic iridescent royal blue.  The wings were made of pure energy – Cas’ Grace.  As the energy danced about playfully, the wings shifted about as if they were fluttering in an unseen breeze.  The effect was spellbinding.  Cas’ wings were not only one of the most beautiful things that Dean had ever seen, but he yearned to feel that shimmering Grace against his soul.  It was surprisingly hard to resist the urge to touch.
"Well you're the only hunter in living memory that's ever seen an angel. Far as I can tell, that's the only thing that could have airlifted your ass out of the hot box," Bobby told him, showing an illustration in a book of a very human-with-wings looking angel. Whoever drew this had clearly never seen anyone like Cas.
"Thirty years?" Sam repeated, pulling out some of the most heartbroken puppy dog eyes that Dean had ever seen.  While Dean wasn't thrilled that Cas had once again just revealed more than Dean wanted anyone else to know, he was relieved that Bobby reluctantly agreed to let him go on the hunt.
Dean tried not to panic as he turned to face the monster who had tortured him in Hell for 30 long years.  He couldn’t see the demon’s true face, but he recognized the energy he could feel from the twisted black soul possessing the meatsuit.
“Er, I guess Balthazar must have encountered some demons during the years he was on Earth,” Sam tried to break the awkward silence.  It seemed to help snap Cas back to himself.
"Yes, and I am able to monitor the area with other senses as well.  Don't worry Dean – I won't let any harm come to you," Cas assured him.  Dean relaxed, feeling Cas brush against his mind with even more reassurances than he put into words.
“Fine Dean.  If you hate your new wings so much, does that mean you want me to go back to researching a way to get rid of them?” Sam huffed angrily.
“Awesome!  Thanks Sa-“ Dean started to say as he made a beeline for the pie, only to slam head first into an invisible wall.
"If there is anything worth dying for... this is it," Dean pleaded.  That spark in Cas' eyes was growing bigger.  Dean felt like he was really reaching him.
"Don't get your feathers in a bunch, I'll keep my promise to them.  They can keep whatever riches they can carry.  It should make for quite the honeymoon if they can bear to drag themselves out of the bedroom," Gabriel replied with a very suggestive eyebrow wiggle.
"Clean your room first ya idjit. You made so much noise trashing the place that ye damn well nearly gave me a heart attack thinkin' something else had come after ya," Bobby scowled. But Dean knew Bobby well enough to hear the worry in Bobby's voice caused by Dean not acting normal. That same worry and confusion was written all over Sam's face too.
“I don’t want to fly,” Dean stubbornly insisted, ignoring the opposite message that his wings were trying to send to his brain.  Cas studied him closely, and Dean was sure that Cas saw right through him.  But part of what made Cas so awesome was that the angel didn’t push him.  Even though Cas was probably eager to teach him to fly, Cas wasn’t going to push him when he wasn’t ready.  Dean was sure he was
"Dean!" Cas sounded more shocked than scolding, but Dean wasn't going to let anyone try to lecture him about 'not taking the Lord's name in vain' or any other kind of crap.
Cas was being quiet and withdrawn.  His drooping wings were pulled close to his body like he was trying to make himself smaller – which really doesn’t work too well when you’ve got a pair of giant wings on your back.  Dean was particularly alarmed by how Cas would barely look him in the eye, and how quickly Cas started vacating whatever room Dean happened to be in.  That really stung.  Things had been going so great between them on their not-date!  Then Dean caught Cas pouring over a very familiar set of books and realized what was wrong.  Guilt hit Dean like a sack of bricks, and Dean knew that he had to fix this ASAP.
"While you two idjits were fooling around, we caught a case," Bobby announced, looking like he was still trying to still his heart.
Dean didn't know the first thing about flying.  Hell, he'd always been terrified of flying.  It was pretty twisted irony that Dean would end up with wings, but right now, despite his terror at the situation, he was very grateful for his wings.  He weighed his options.  He could either keep gliding until he eventually reached the ground (which thankfully their decent had slowed down enough that it would take a long time for them to get to the ground), or he could try to get them back to the beanstalk.  As nervous as Dean was about messing with what his wings were doing, the idea of starting the climb up the beanstalk from the very bottom again was not very appealing.  Besides, the longer they delayed, the worse the chances for finding Juanita alive were.
“Well, yeah, but – did you have to make us look so gay?” Dean protested.  Sam really couldn’t hold back his laughter at that one, which earned a glare from Dean.
Dean had no idea how he was going to survive this one.  He tried to block out the sheer terror that threatened to overwhelm him.  The only thought on his mind was that he had to get to Sammy.  He streamlined his body into a perfect nosedive, and within seconds that felt like an eternity, he somehow managed to catch up to Sam and grab him tight.
“And now with the return of visual stimuli, you have reverted to your natural predisposition to rely on your eyes,” Cas said with a sigh of disappointment.  “But you were doing great, Dean.  We’ll keep practicing.”
“Now you try,” Cas breathed onto Dean’s neck, making Dean shiver despite his best attempts to control himself.  Dean reached down into his soul, and tried to just let the angel blade come as naturally to him as his wings did.  He was a warrior – a blade should be the most normal thing for him to manifest.  It took a few minutes of concentration before he could get his soul to cooperate since this was the first time he was trying to get it to do this particular trick, but eventually he felt his energies surge towards his awaiting hand.  Cool metal slipped down into his hand.
"Bobby...," Dean started to protest, but Bobby was giving him that it'd-be-for-your-own-damn-good look.  Fortunately Cas, possibly sensing Dean's distress, decided to speak up.
“Your down feathers are real feathers, Dean,” Cas told him again with exasperation.  “But yes – these might be your first set of flight feathers.”
“Save it, Cas.  Just because we are imprisoned together does not mean I have to talk to you,” Balthazar retorted cruelly.  Cas looked completely crestfallen.  If Cas didn’t care so much about Balthazar, Dean would have roasted his wings in holy oil by now.
However perhaps it wasn't just another day in Hell after all. In the thirty years that Dean had spent there, he had never seen such a beautiful bright bluish white light. It felt like something inside him was changing just by looking at it. But before Dean could react it was upon him. There was a sheering grip on his shoulder, and then he blacked out.
“You think that you’ve got the monopoly on mysterious resurrections?  I don’t know, but believe me, nobody is happier that I’m alive again than I am,” Balthazar retorted.  “And now that I’m both alive
“I found traces of angel wing oil on his hands!  So for my first trick I’m going to force him to materialize those wings,” the demon replied.  He opened a bag full of very sharp familiar looking silver instruments that made Dean’s stomach plummet.  There was no way that he was just going to sit here and let his baby brother be tortured.  There had to be something he could do.  Dean started frantically tearing through Cas’ backpack looking for something he could use.  The demon was apparently not smart enough to consider a warded Winchester to be a threat, because the demon completely ignored him.  Instead, the demon just kept grinning like a kid in a candy store.
"Capture Lilith? No, we're trying to kill her! She's a monster. She murdered Dean! She...," Sam protested, his voice cracking slightly from the pain he'd gone through while Dean was gone.
"Angels were created with the sole purpose of obeying God's commands.  If I do this, we will all be hunted.  We will all be killed," Cas replied.
“I can see for myself what Castiel did with him, and I will handle the situation accordingly.  Now, you have your orders!” the dickwad snapped.
"Sam, Dean – it’s been awhile.  Thank you for coming.  After everything I did...," Henriksen greeted them.
"Sammy!  Are you okay?" Dean asked, rushing to Sam's side. Sam starred at him with a mixture of disbelief, skepticism, hope, and longing.
Dean couldn’t believe how awesome it felt to finally get out of the Bunker.  He grinned as he and Cas sped down the highway.
“There were some caves that went deep into the cliff,” Sam explained.  “We came across what looked like the fallout of demon-on-demon violence.  There were a few putrid empty meatsuits left behind and a lot of sulfur.  But we couldn’t figure out what happened.  I took a few photos on my phone that we can analyze back at the bunker.  There was some old writing on the cave walls that I couldn’t understand.  I also collected a few random scraps of things that I can try analyzing too.”
Dean insisted that Sam call Bobby before they arrived and give the old hunter a heads up so he wouldn't be met with silver bullets when they got there. Bobby was a lot less likely to believe in an angel rescue than Sam. Sure enough, Dean had to pass a bunch of tests before he could even get through the front door. But after Dean finally passed all the tests, Bobby pulled him into a tight hug (and the old hunter's eyes were definitely threatening to tear up).
“Hold up – I thought I was just part angel now, not part trickster,” Dean interrupted, glancing at Cas and seeing that his angel was confused as well.  Gabriel sighed in exasperation.
Cas righted their flight again, smirking when he saw the astonished look on Dean’s face.  Cheeky bastard.  Dean realized that he was losing focus on keeping his wings still, and the traitorous wings were starting to twitch with the desire to start flying.
Dean waited a few more minutes before chucking a rock at the second giant.  He was proud of his aim because he also managed to hit this giant right in the eye.  These rocks were much too small to cause any real damage to the giants, but it was hard not to laugh at how easy it was to rile them up.
"Yeah, something like that.  Let's keep going.  It's not much further to the top," Dean replied.  Sam reluctantly let go of Dean and carefully pulled himself back onto the beanstalk.
“Yeah,” Dean confirmed needlessly.  Now that he’d gotten a better look at it, it reminded him of the symbols he’d seen once while astral-projecting.  This was another thing that normal humans couldn’t see that he now could.  Dean was grateful that he never went anywhere unarmed, and quickly whipped out a gun and blade.  He wondered if he could use his knife to scrape away enough of the paint that Cas could go inside with him.  But then, when Dean was suddenly about 15 feet away from the building, he ran into an invisible wall.  Stunned, Dean traced his hand over the invisible wall that was 15 feet around all of the warded area.  Realization dawned on Dean and anger pulsed through his veins.
“We aren’t far from a spot by the lake that would be ideal for lunch,” Cas announced.  Dean wondered just how far Cas could sense, and how much of it was done with his wings.
Dean jumped as a rock projectile narrowly missed him.  This monster was just supposed to PRETEND to try to kill him, wasn’t it?  If Dean hadn’t been working hard with Cas to learn how to see using his extra eyes without manifesting them, then Dean might not have been able to dodge that one in time.  This play fight was feeling all too life-threateningly real.
"An angel? An honest to God angel?" Sam repeated dumbfoundly. "Do you believe it?" The hopeful puppy-dog-eyes were back in full force. Sam was always so eager to believe in angels, but it wasn't so easy for Dean. Dean had believed his father when he told him that every supernatural creature was evil. After their mom had been killed, and all of the (sometimes literal) Hell they had endured, it was hard to believe that there could also be good supernatural beings out there.
“Well, that too,” Dean admitted, “but my wings really do itch, and I can’t seem to get it to stop.  Sam – did you put itching powder in my wings?”
“Well it is quite unpleasant up here,” Alastair replied, wrinkling his nose.  “But so is one of my toys getting out of the toybox.  You had to know that was only temporary.  After all, I’m not done carving you into a new animal.  And I’ve got to say, Dean – you have a lot of potential just waiting to be tapped.”  Alastair casually strolled closer to Dean.  He always liked to take his time with his prey so he could watch them squirm.
"Dean...," Sam began, the look on his face expressing more than words ever could.  But Dean wasn't going to let this turn into more of a chick flick moment than it already was.
“Close your eyes and focus on just feeling my Grace manifesting my blade,” Cas suggested.  Cas walked right up behind Dean, like he was the big spoon to Dean’s little spoon.  Cas extended his right arm and aligned it with Dean’s so that they were right on top of each other.
Meanwhile Dean was trying really hard not to freak out. What the hell had just happened to him? Was this some kind of crazy post-Hell side effect? Had he somehow popped out of Hell wrong? Or maybe this had just been some kind of one-time fluke from leftover angel mojo. The wings were gone now. Maybe for once in his life he'd be lucky enough to have them stay gone.
Dean’s hands naturally found their way to Cas’ wings.  Dean started with slow gentle strokes of Cas’ feathers, mirroring the sentiments he was licking into Cas’ mouth.  That got just the kind of responding moans that Dean had been hoping for.  Dean grinned into the kiss, only to find himself moaning too a second later when Cas started stroking his wings.  Dean automatically fluffed up his feathers and leaned into the touch.  It felt so good, so good.  Dean tried to savor every single touch.
"I suspect so. It is beyond my power to modify souls or Grace. Your ability to manifest wings comes from your soul's wing buds. I merely helped align your energies so your wings would manifest in the traditionally preferred location," Cas explained. That explanation was a bit TMI though because now Dean was getting mental images of wings popping out of random body parts. Well at least if he was stuck with wings they were on his back.
"Most likely not," Cas repeated as if the matter was not of great importance.  "In any case, you should not feel so guilty.  You did nothing wrong.  I am even more certain now that you deserved to be saved, and I'm grateful that I was able to be of service to you regardless of the consequences."  Deep orbs of vivid blue were pleading with Dean to understand and believe.  Dean swallowed and licked his lips nervously, but couldn't tear his eyes away from Cas' eyes.  Damn – how could he even respond to that?  Luckily he didn't have to because Bobby cleared his throat.
They were back on the seraphic plane.  Cas had Dean engulfed in a tight bear hug, pinning his wings to his body.  Balthazar was flying besides them carrying Sam (in a much less intimate position).  Dean could feel Cas’ grace coursing through his body, trying to heal whatever damage Dean had done by forcing himself through the cracked ward.  The pain was still pretty bad, but it was getting better with each passing minute.
“No, I am still in my vessel – I have just brought my vessel with us onto this plane of existence,” Cas replied patiently with a small smile.  “I’m glad that I can now show you this.  You are the first human to see the seraphic plane.”
“And this must be Castiel,” Garth continued enthusiastically, pulling Cas into a tight bear hug too.  Dean couldn’t help laughing at the look of surprise and confusion on Cas’ face, which slowly turned into a slight smile in Cas’ eyes at the warm reception.
“Dean – relax – I won’t let anything happen to you,” Cas promised.  Dean tried to focus on just Cas’ eyes, and that helped some.
“If you’re ready Cas,” Dean replied.  They’d been taking it slow for a while, since Dean wanted this to be completely different from any other relationship he’d ever had.  He was playing for keeps, and wanted to do this right, savoring every step along the way.  But now felt right – they’d waited long enough.
"Shut up, and it's a coyote not a dog," Dean told him grumpily.  The distinction between a dog and a coyote suddenly felt extremely important to Dean.  Coyotes were noble animals that were incredibly intelligent and cunning… and since when had Dean identified this much with coyotes?  It felt right though, so maybe his soul was on to something here.  All three of his faces scowled at one of them being compared to a mere dog.  Now he knew why his voice sounded like it was echoing – his two other mouths were saying the same thing at the same time.
“Damn it Sam, I said I didn’t want to cut up any more of my clothes!” Dean complained.  He liked that jacket.
If I’m going to have to put up with you and Eileen being all lovey-dovey all weekend, the least you can do is get me a damn pie, Sam!
“We can’t,” Cas replied.  “Fledging angels risk damaging their wings if they try to fly prematurely.  Pin feathers are vulnerable to not being able to control the delicate balance between the part of Dean on the physical plane and the part of him on the seraphic plane.  Pulling Dean too far one way or the other could be disastrous.  We’ll have to use human transportation.”  Dean scowled.  Not that he minded not flying – he was thrilled about keeping his feet on the ground – but he hated being the reason why Cas couldn’t go to his friend’s aid faster.  Cas didn’t act like he resented Dean at all for it – he didn’t even seem to pick up on Dean’s guilt on the subject.  Dean sighed and tried to refocus on how nice it would be to drive his baby.  Sure, it would mean 8 hours of sitting in an awkward and uncomfortable position with his wings cramped, but at least he’d be on the open road.
“Son of a bitch!  I’m human!  HUMAN!” Dean yelled as he started chucking nearby rocks at the angel warding.  To add to his fury, all of the rocks that he threw bounced off the same force field.
“My apologies – that was inappropriate,” Cas told Sam, and Dean could see his bright red blush in the mirror.  But Sam didn’t look the least bit placated.
Dean tried to protest, fearing for Cas' safety, but his body was not cooperating.  It was taking all the willpower he had just to keep his eyes open.  A fierce battle was waging right in front of him, and Dean kept missing parts of it because sleep kept threatening to overtake him.  Dean didn't even jump when there was suddenly a loud crack right behind him.
“Those are girls’ shirts, Sammy!  What’s next?  Chapstick?” Dean protested.  He still couldn’t believe that Sam had come back from his latest shopping trip with a bag full of girls’ shirts from the used store, much less that Sam was actually trying to convince him to wear them.  Dean was NOT the girl in the family.  Although, if Dean were to give Sam any credit – which let’s face it, was not going to happen here – he’d admit that at least the shirts weren’t pink or frilly, but simple and solid colors like black, navy, and forest green.
"Hold up – how is you ridin' around in someone's meat suit any different from what demons do?" Bobby cut in. It was a fair point, but Dean still glared at the tone Bobby was taking with Cas.
“You didn’t ask.  And for the record, if I could do it all over again, I’d make the same choice.  I don’t regret the wings, Cas.  They’ve kind of grown on me.  Literally,” Dean told him.  The look in Cas’ eyes of hoping-but-not-wanting-to-let-himself-hope was heartbreaking.
"Yes we are, but giants are not," Cas stated.  Great, now Henriksen was back to looking pissed at Cas.  Dean really needed to help Cas work on his people skills.
Going back to having only one head and four limbs was a lot weirder than it should have been.  This was how Dean had lived his whole life, so why did it now feel like he was missing vital parts of himself?  He could still feel the energy inside himself that was used to manifest his angel parts, but it wasn't the same when he kept them repressed like this, and he itched to let them out again.  But Dean had the equivalent of a college degree in ‘How to Repress Anything & Everything’ so this was nothing he couldn't handle.
"I can't be certain that whatever creature caused this has left the area.  We should leave and remain alert for the next time it tries to attack," Cas replied, scanning the trees warily.
Sam and Eileen had become focused on their own conversation, and were no longer paying any attention to Dean and Cas.  Dean expressed his exasperated amusement by catching Cas’ eye and doing an exaggerated eye roll.  Cas gulped, and decided try to figure out Dean’s intentions.
“Have they breached Dean’s skin yet?” Sam asked, looking at Dean’s wings so closely that Dean could feel Sam’s breath on his feathers.
"No!  Cas...," Dean began, but with another flap of wings Cas was back.  Everyone but Dean jumped, but Cas seemed oblivious to the idea that he had done anything out of the ordinary.
Dean didn’t sense the wards until they were practically right in front of him.  There was a single large sigil painted on the cave wall.  It looked like it was the same kind of invisible-to-humans paint that they’d seen back in Kansas.  Sam set down his backpack and got out one of the cans of spray paint he’d brought, and they directed him towards the sigil.
"Quit whining you baby, I didn't do anything!" the second giant complained without even opening his eyes.
“Think of your wings as a sensory organ,” Cas instructed.  “With time and practice you’ll learn to gather more information about your environment with your wings than with your eyes or ears.”
“So get this,” Sam announced after geeking out all afternoon on research.  “I think the demons in that cave were experimenting on angel feathers.  It looks like they’ve been trying to figure out angel weaknesses for hundreds of years.  Apparently they tried to infiltrate a group of Prague psychics that were studying angels hundreds of years ago.  While they weren’t successful at getting inside the psychic order, since the psychics caught on to them pretty quickly, they did get away with a little information that was inside the head of the one new initiate that they possessed.  The demons have been trying to build on that ever since.”
“No Sammy – you’re right,” Dean replied.  “We’ll figure this out – how I can adapt – just like we always do.”
“Yes, Dean, although I suppose for now it is a bit overwhelming for you, but it will become second nature.  Why do you think that angel wings are so sensitive after all?” Cas replied.  Memories of their mutual wing grooming sessions popped into Dean’s mind, and he felt enthusiastic twitches in both his wings and his pants at the thought.
“That’s where you’re wrong – I’ve figured out how I can go outside,” Dean replied with a victorious smirk.  “If you buy me a backpack, we can cut a hole for my wings, and then they’ll be hidden inside the backpack.”  There occasionally were fringe benefits of still having such small wings.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas replied with a secretive smirk that made Dean feel all kinds of warm and giddy in anticipation.  One of the wing movement training techniques that Cas had been doing with Dean was for Cas to lightly touch one of Dean’s wings and have Dean lean his wing into the touch.  Dean had gotten the hang of that one rather quickly.  Like when Cas walked behind him in previous wing-touching sessions, Dean closed his eyes so that he could focus entirely on the sensations from Cas’ hands.  Only, Dean kept waiting and waiting and nothing happened.
On the bright side, at least Sam hadn’t gotten them some dorky little picnic basket.  But on the other hand, Dean wasn’t convinced that what Sam did buy was all that much better.
"I know that you, like all the other angels, have been buying the party line that you've been spoon fed since The Beginning, but it's time to wake up and smell the rotting eggs.  Because believe me – more and more angels have been turning sour since Dad went away, and like any rotten rebellious teenagers do when unsupervised, they are taking their feelings out by egging their Father's beloved creation.  Only in this scenario, the eggs are angelic nukes that will destroy every living thing on Earth.  So unless you want that to happen, it's time to break away from the flock," Gabriel explained.
“Pie is not just mere sustenance, Cas,” Dean insisted.  “Come over and have a piece and you’ll see.  We’ll plot our revenge later.”  At least Sam knew how to select a good pie, so some of Dean’s lessons must have stuck.  Dean would give Sam credit where credit was due.
"Dean is still very new to his wings, and this pocket dimension is somehow blocking my powers.  I'll make a path for us to climb," Cas replied.  Cas drew his angel blade and started making cuts into the bookcase that they could use for handholds and footholds.  The dude moved surprisingly fast too, and never seemed to tire.  This marathon of a journey was wearing a lot more on the rest of them, but they pushed on and followed Cas up to the top of the bookcase.
"Woah there," Gabriel interjected.  "I may have some appreciation for this crazy planet, and absolutely no desire to let my big brothers start fighting again, but I never said that I'd die for the cause.  I'm just here to facilitate things behind the scenes."
“You are sensing my touches, at least on a subconscious level.  Now we need that to become part of your conscious awareness,” Cas explained.  “Let’s practice again.”
“Alastair,” Dean spit out the name with disgust and hate.  “Didn’t think you liked how cold it is topside.”  Dean tried to keep Alastair talking while he figured out a plan.  He was good at manifesting his angel blade on command now, but if he lunged at Alastair and missed, it would be bad if Alastair spread the news about Dean’s new angel mojo.  Should Dean pray to Cas?  Cas should be finishing off his troll right about now and heading to the rendezvous point.  But what if Alastair hurt Cas?
"I tried flying to the top of the beanstalk, but the pocket dimension on the other side is protected by some sort of barrier that even I cannot penetrate.  It appears that the only way in is by climbing the beanstalk, which is also protected from supernatural means of entry, but the protection is weaker at the base, which will allow us to enter here," Cas reported.
But instead of talking, Cas suddenly left the trail and started tromping through the bush.  Cas had a strange way of moving through tall plants like they weren’t even there.  Dean, on the other hand, struggled to keep up.
"Right.  I'll just cut to the point then.  One of my cousins says her fiancé was kidnapped by giants," Henriksen announced.
Dean fell onto his knees, his legs unable to support him anymore.  But he was almost there, so he crawled the last part.  With the last of his energy, Dean used a rock to smash the rest of the way through the ward.
"I'm not sure humans were meant to imbibe such vast quantities of sustenance at one time.  I can...," Cas offered, reaching out towards Dean's forehead with two fingers.
"I know, but I can't go hunting looking like this either, and we've got a case to solve," Dean replied.  Not to mention it was making his head ache to try to integrate three different perspectives at once.
"THAT'S NOT FUNNY!" the giant roared.  "GO BACK TO SLEEP!"  It felt like an earthquake as the giant shifted around before rolling over and trying to go back to sleep.
Cas watched with amusement as the brothers texted back and forth.  Dean repeatedly rolled his eyes and sighed with exasperation, but it was all part of their good natured banter.
“Idiot.  You actually think that boy is an angel?” Balthazar apparently couldn’t keep his mouth shut.  But the demon must be used to all of Balthazar’s yammering by now because he just rolled his eyes.
“You warded pie.  Cas and I are going to get you back for that,” Dean insisted.  Clearly Sam was not comprehending the severity of his offence.
“Look – we’re not going anywhere until everyone keeps their hands and wings to themselves,” Sam proclaimed.  Cas pulled his wings away, lifting them out of Dean’s reach.  Dean sighed.
“I know what I did!” Cas snapped, cutting Dean off.  “I watched . . . I felt him die by my own hand.  It’s one of the biggest regrets of my life.  But somehow, I don’t know how – Balthazar is alive again.”
Cas repeatedly stretched out his angel senses as far as they could go – and came back with some frustrating results.
<I’m glad you could come.  Welcome to the bunker!> Sam signed.  Delight spread out across Eileen’s face when she realized that Sam had been secretly studying ASL.
“You got caught,” Balthazar rubbed in.  “And what’s worse, you’ve . . . become something on which they will love to experiment.”  Balthazar didn’t bother to hide his disgust, and Dean had a sinking feeling that it wasn’t just the demons that Balthazar was disgusted with.  Dean narrowed his eyes at Balthazar as he assessed him.  Balthazar’s feathers were a complete mess, like he hadn’t bothered to groom them for a long time.  He was missing a lot of feathers too, and Dean couldn’t help cringing at the sight.
"So how come there haven't been any other reports of giants or huge beanstalks reaching up into the clouds?" Sam asked.
“Focus Dean,” Cas reminded him softly, and Dean could have sworn that there was the tiniest of smirks gracing those chapped pink lips that were only inches away from him.  The bastard could probably sense the effect that he was having on Dean.
"Ah, when your conscious mind is at rest. Next time that happens, let yourself adjust and get familiar with them," Cas suggested. Dean sighed.
Cas replied with a smile and a pleased hum.  Then Cas started taking his shirt off in a way that was surprisingly coy for an angel who’d never strip teased before.  Dean’s heart sped up faster at the sight of Cas’ bare chest, and in anticipation of what was coming next.  He lunged for his dresser’s top drawer for some condoms and the brand new bottle of Astroglide...
"You mean rebel?  Lucifer rebelled, and he was cast out for disobeying God's plan.  Surely whichever angels are behind this ploy will also be cast out.  Angels starting the apocalypse cannot be what God intended.  If we go to Michael...," Cas argued.
“Forget it Cas – you’re not going alone.  We can’t risk losing you too,” Dean reminded Cas pleadingly.  Dean didn’t even want to think about the possibility of Cas being trapped in some cave, being tortured by demons, with Dean having no idea which tunnel to go through to find him.
“...Dean…  Dean…  DEAN!” apparently Sam had been trying to get their attention, but his words barely registered to Cas while he was under the onslaught of Dean kisses.  Dean had pulled away from Cas’ lips and was now placing tender kisses all over Cas’ neck, making Cas melt even more.
"Well even if this is a trap, there is an innocent woman up there who needs our help.  Do you have any idea what kinds of weapons might work against a giant?" Dean asked.
"Henriksen?  As in Victor Henriksen, the FBI guy that took forever to finally understand that we weren't the bad guys?  Wow, I didn't expect him to ever actually use our number," Dean replied, shaking his head in disbelief.
After spending so many years as a disembodied soul, connecting to his soul wasn't particularly difficult for Dean. His soul didn't have all of the filters his conscious mind did, so the longing for wings came through quite clearly. The two parts of himself felt very disjointed. Even though Dean's conscious mind still had its reservations, he tried to give his soul permission to do what it wanted.
"Dude – its pie!  Pie!" Dean whined, but Cas didn't seem to get why this was so important to Dean.  Clearly Dean had his work cut out for him when it came to introducing Cas to all the awesome things humans had made.
“…can see angels even without drinking untested magical potions, yeah Cas, we remember,” Dean grumbled.  “So how much info do the demons have?”
Speaking of, Cas chose that moment to walk into the room and examine the new clothes that Sam had bought.
“No,” Dean conceded, knowing that currently Cas’ greatest handicap to being a hunter was his understanding of humans – something he was working really hard to improve.  Dean opened his mouth again to comment on how Cas’ passion for helping people combined with his countless years of combat experience and supernatural expertise gave Cas the makings of a great hunter, but Dean stopped himself because he knew that Sam would just turn all of those statements back around on him.  Little brothers could be annoying like that – especially ones who would have made great lawyers.  However, despite Dean not saying any of that, Sam must have seen it on his face because Sam grinned slyly like he’d just won the fight.  Sneaky bastard.  But Dean wasn’t done yet.
