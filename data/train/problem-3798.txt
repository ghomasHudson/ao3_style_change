“Don’t be, I was being an ass, I should have noticed what was going on.” He went around the bed and squeezed Cass’s shoulder, ignoring how he shuddered under his touch. Yet another oddity happening with the Angel they needed to figure out.”
Dean for his part, leaned forward, head banging on the library table. “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. Why? Why are they changing?” He felt his wings lifting behind him. Mantling over his body as if they could protect him from all confusing things. He only wished it was true.
Castiel helps Dean learn how to use his wings.
“Because I’m not allowed to. I’ll never be allowed to.” And it broke his heart even more to know he would never have this man, his man, his most perfect human. But Cass knew his own worth, which was nothing, he couldn’t allow Dean to settle for so little, not when he was owed so much.
The chestnut colored messenger showed his character by not squirming while under the two foot tall high elf’s penetrating gaze. “No My Lord it appears that the older Winchester and his Consort have left their home.”
“Something I could help you find son?” A voice as dusty as the books around him asked from about three feet behind him.
Dean pressing his forehead tightly to the awkward Angel, who was still learning about humanity and all the weirdness which came from them. “I know buddy, I know. Just promise me, you’ll tell me from now on when you’re hurting. I’m here to help you, even if you don’t want to bother me with your issues. Cass man, your issues are my issues.”
He was glaring up at the tall Elf who was reporting his latest intel. The male stood six foot even, was slim as most elves were but with a sword masters build. Muscles defined but not pronounced indicating he would be fast, wiry and a powerhouse when the moment called for it. He had silver eyes which glowed from twin sockets set deep in his angled face. A slice of nose which would do an eagle proud, firm lips which were stretched in a neutral expression for the moment. No wrinkles marred his face, even though he was hundreds of years old and a seasoned warrior. His black hair was kept short, not long enough for an enemy to get a grip, as was his dedicated warriors intention. Skin the color of pastel sea foam lavender, it hide just how deadly the elf could be.
In the office, Gabriel opened his eyes.
“SON OF A BITCH!” Gabriel snarled at the top of his voice, thoroughly startling Sam who had been reading his book again.
Instantly she jumped up, begging forgiveness even as she opened the door to lead him to the room herself. The storm raged still, wind and debris blowing in equal measure, causing Cass to once again form his wards around the three of them. She marveled at how she could see and hear what was going on, but now no longer felt the power punishing around her. She led them around the corner towards where the motel’s 10 rooms were located. Room two, was on the east side facing a small plaza with a broken fountain in the center. She took the key from Castiel and opened the door for him, stepping aside so that he could carry Dean’s still form inside.
“Son of a bitch. I hope Cass shows up soon, Gabe needs to have his system purged again.” Standing he waited a moment to see if he would be hit with dizziness once more, thankful he wasn’t. He didn’t like leaving Gabe alone but he needed to tend to a few personal issues, then hunt down Cass. He just hoped he and Dean were not busy with each other this morning.
Sam looked around the office, making sure he didn’t miss an opening he needed to salt. While doing so he thought about the man who had built this place. Sean must have known about the supernatural and took pains to make sure his brothers never escaped the prison he built for them. For that is what this bank really was, a prison to keep their spirits contained. Which led to why didn’t he simply salt and burn their bodies? He would think about it later if he had the time. First he needed to get those bodies burned.
The hunter in question jumped about three feet into the air, wings instinctively deploying as he reacted to the sudden sound of his mate’s voice. Giving a few strokes of his cinnamon colored wings he did not fail to notice cheerful orange his tips were rapidly changing to. Cass was laughing at him. Landing he huffed as he gave the older man a glare. “God damn it Cass, why are you sneaking up on me?” He folded his wings behind his back, feathers still ruffling at being startled.
Which wasn’t cool.
Sighing he knew what he would need to do. “What are the dangers from cutting them off?” He ignored the vicious snarl muffled beside him, along with the rattling cuffs.
“Fuck Cass… yeah marked me as yours…” Dean moaned as he felt Cass press himself against him fully. Nor did he miss how Castiel was marking him up and approving of every single one.
The Ancient one smiled down at the eager to serve young one. “We wait, we are all eager to help and pay back what we owe. But it must be done in such a way to be accepted, the Winchesters would not accept us directly, for we would not fit into their normal lives.” He stopped to chuckle, “We would not fit period and humanity is not prepared to understand we are real instead of legends.”
“Give it time Sam. Let's get this flying bitch out of here. Then I can come back with you to the bunker if you like. Help Rowena solve this problem if you want.”
“Shit, so what do we do?” Gazing worriedly down at the Archangel he took note of his still shallow breathing and pale complexation. His hair needing washing even after Cass had cleaned him with his Grace. Sweat was starting to form on his forehead, indicating all was still not well with the man.
Looking at her with side eyes, becoming more alarmed at the excitement in her eyes. “Okay? So we need our Fed outfits? Dean can’t fit into his right now. It’s why he has the suspenders and leather cups around the base of his wings. To hide they are really attached.” Sam responded.
“Wow, they just disappeared? With no one knowing what happened to them? And what about Sean what happened to him?”
Looking up, meeting his gaze Castiel shook his head, “Dean you need to eat.”
“You didn’t really think I would let anyone else win did you?” He walked closer to his hunter.
“What? Just cause I’m with Cass? He’s a you know what. Not a howitzer…”
“Huh? Oh right, yeah I’ll take the Cobb salad, blue cheese dressing, large ice tea.” Sam stated absently, eyes still on Gabriel.
Glancing at Charlie standing on her right, Rowena took a deep breath to explain. “The first danger is you bleed out in under a minute. Your wings are living parts of you and they need just as much of a blood supply as anything else. A mixture of magic created them, mine, Castiel’s feathers you were holding at the time, and all the fairy dust in the bunker.”
Dean felt a shiver run through him as he did as he was told. No wonder Cass had been a leader of Angels, if he used that tone on those under him. He wouldn’t mind hearing it again, even if only in his wet dreams. Still he didn’t like being barked at “Cass…”

‘Dean go ahead and eat it, I’ve already eaten, the first set of fish I pulled out of the creek when I realized you wouldn’t be waking any time soon.’ Then mind voice quiet and embarrassed, ‘I was hungrier then I realized.’
Sam nodded at his words, he had had a few jobs over the years which actually paid money. It had felt kinda nice to be able to afford things legitimately, rather than doing scams and hustling pool. Course now they received money through their friend Charlie, in some mysterious magical electronic means he didn’t want to know to much about. But having that money did come in handy, especially as they now had three people to feed rather than two.
Who was he kidding? He wanted Dean, but couldn’t have him and yet refused to allow Dean to have anyone else? What the fuck was wrong with him? What he needed to do was follow Dean’s example and back off, allow his hunter to find someone else. He had to give up on a dream he never should have had in the first place. Sighing he ate his own food, grimacing cause yeah Sam didn’t flavor it the way Dean did. Way to much salt.
“Dean?” Cass asked as he continued to work. Though his fingers did slow as Dean ran his fingers gently up and down his leg. He couldn’t help himself as his cock slowly filled of its own accord. Not like he would try and stop Dean from teasing him, whatever his mate desired with him was okay in his book.
It was the second ghost who spoke once more, rage coating his every word. “To finish what we started. To finish those who killed us. To kill all those who stand in our way.”
“Yes, It wasn’t there yesterday, only there for when I come in and disappears as soon as I leave? Oh yeah there’s something going on and I don’t like it.”
“Right, sure, so need any more food?” Sam asked as he stood up to get more coffee.
“Okay spill Sammy what in the hell is going on with those two.” Charlie asked, looking for anything which might be edible. Not that she really had a clue as to what was edible, but she had looked up a few things on her computer when they had stayed in the tent. Sam though knew more about roughing it in the woods.
Sure.
Wiping his hands off, ignoring the Angel behind him, Dean scanned the trail they were on. “Jesus what the hell guys? You were going to drag me all the way down there?” The trail seemed to go on for hundreds of feet. “Why don’t we fly down? I can carry Charlie while the cat takes you Sam.”
Blinking he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know. Then he sighed because yeah he did. If they ever returned back to his town he had to make sure he could protect the people who depended on him to do so. “Let’s go back to my place.”
(He nuzzled at the downed Angel, causing his long coat to billow up.)
Silence descended among the crowed as the amount was 3000 higher than anyone else.
Shaking his head, pulling into the parking lot of the restaurant he figured they would eat at, before going to the bank. “Nah just wondering a few things.” He parked the impala, shut it down and opened the door.
‘Now, now Dean, don’t worry we’ll get to the point where I fuck you but you may as well enjoy as much as you can. You’ll have to wait till the morning for your own pleasure.’
No doubt he knew their reputation, possibly thought they were a danger to his little brother, who had given so much to save others, to save him. Sam knew they were hard on their friends and family at the best of times. Once Gabriel learned Cass had found them and was working with them, it probably pissed him off even more. Closing his eyes as he concentrated he pursed his lips as he realized one fact Gabriel didn’t know about. One that he might not be pleased about when he learned of it, which Sam would deal with later. For now getting Gabriel back on his feet was the higher priority.
Following Dean into the bunker proper they headed down the halls toward the kitchen. Entering  the room Cass placed the books on the dinning table, while Dean placed the bags on the counter. “I’m going to put these away, what do you want for lunch?”
“I think we are about to get company,” Dean turned to Cass, putting their problems to the side for the moment. “Cass need you to come with us, see if you can see them.”
“It will take time for he is sly and cunning, he would see through many of the intrigues I would use. So if I may beg the Court’s indulgence to bring them together, it will take longer.”
The guards here recognized his escort and himself, opening the doors before they reach them. Stepping through she quickly led him down towards the East wing and one of the many wards there. Healers went about their duties paying little attention to who was traveling among them. While they gave Robin wide berth, there was no bowing or fawning here, healers being exempt in their own house from such things while on duty. A simple head nod if eye contact was made was all that was needed.
Enjoy.
Once he started there was no going back for him. ‘I love you Cass, I am so thankful you let me claim you. That you claimed me. That you found me worthy to love, that you wanted me. I love you my Angel, my mate, my beautiful other half. The being who is my one and only soul mate.’
“Sure Dean.” He watched as Dean shared one last look with their resident Angel before heading inside. “Cass you okay?”
Snapping his head up at the word, Dean rolled his eyes in a highly disgusted sour manner. Swallowing again “Fuck just what we need, those assholes showing up.”
SPNSPNSPN
Sam knocked on the wall, both startling and pulling the other two men’s attention towards him and his phone call. They came over, circling the device, though Dean stayed out of visual range in case Charlie decided to put it on the video setting.  Putting it on speaker, Sam held it out so they could listen.
“Dean you okay?” Sam asked feeling useless in the face of the other two men. Seriously how was he to help when they found themselves in situations like this? God maybe it would be better if he took a step back and let his brothers deal with the jobs.
Closing his book, Dean stood up from where he was sitting on his bed to walk over to the kitchen table. “What ya find?”
More rocks came at them, bouncing away as Cass started glowing brightly. “Cass what did I say?” Dean shouted at his mate who was preparing to take out the trolls.
“The Charity yes. I did NOT agree to wear that!” Dean could feel sharks circling.
The suddenly sober drunk nodded as best he could.
‘I won’t, I won’t stop, everything will be fine Cass, I’m here for you.’ He ran his hands up to his face, pulling him in for a kiss, chaste for the most part, meant to give assurance and comfort rather than passion.
Dean shook his head as he felt something come over him. It was a strange feeling somewhat like a rumble in his chest, it was mild and didn’t bother him in the least. In fact he felt comfort from the rumble which was confusing as shit to him. He pushed it aside though when he saw Cass blink his own cornflower blue eyes. “Hey there you are Cass.”
Licking between his rose buds, Castiel rubbed himself slowly against Dean, the sound of slick mud filling their ears.  “Always mine, as I am always yours.” He whispered before starting to move down to the shaft which was begging for attention. His legs spreading to either side of Dean’s knees, letting him settle so he could play with his mate’s prick.
A hand came up pressing his head into a warm, straining chest. ‘Keep your eyes closed Dean, we’re almost there.’
“Freeze put your weapons down!” A female officer shouted, she was maybe only a little over five foot, with blond hair pulled back in a sensible bun. She was also just starting to show the start of a bump in her belly, she was expecting.
Dean could care less, they had his mate and they would pay. Firming his grip “Hold on Sammy, this isn’t going to be fun.”
Snapping another command found the glass exploding from every vehicle, coating the people in a fine mist of razor sharp dust, breaking and rubbing into exposed skin.
Sam trying not to pace as he watched her work, “You sure? Dean and Cass still can’t return and I could really use the help.”
Giving him one last raised eyebrow and suspicious eye, Cass did as he was asked. Dean set to work grooming his mate’s wings and while they may not need to be groomed as often as his, they still needed regular maintenance. As he suspected they were in need of a good overhaul, with split, cracked and twisted feathers mixed up among the healthy and properly set feathers. Settling to his task, Dean was gentle with each black feather, putting them back into place. As he did so could feel the tension leave his mate. It was as he thought, Cass was overall irritated because his wings had been irritating him. Most of the feathers he was needing to clean, redirect or some he had to just pluck were coated in a sticky residue which just screamed their last job. Dean had been forced to defend himself taking some heavy blows before Castiel had shown up and killed the were-cats. No doubt not grooming his wings was his version of punishing himself for failing to protect his mate.
Eyes half closed in pleasure as Dean sucked on his lobe, adding yet another mark to the many on his vessel. “I can… oh yeah, love your tongue… take care… OH FUCK, bite me again… that for you.” He offered breathing heavy as Dean had switched to his nipples, sucking and biting them before pulling them with his teeth.
“See that you don’t. So what other news do you have?” She took a sip of her own ruby red wine.
“I know, and he won’t Cass won’t let him.” Returning to the cave, Castiel stepping aside to let him in. “Dean Charlie and I are going hunting, we’ll be back with food as soon as we can.”
“Shut it Cass, your feathers are driving you mad now turn around.” This time Dean was firm in his orders. Most of Castiel’s irritation did stem from his brother being around, but there were other factors also contributing to his bad mood. Itchy, broken, dry feathers being chief among them.
“We’re going in here?” He demanded, rhetorical really because it was the only place they could be heading.
“Right silly me for asking, okay buddy I’ll fix lunch for everyone. When is Rowena supposed to be here?”
“Honestly none of us know and we are getting tired of it. I don’t like it because Cass is my best friend aside from Dean. He’s a good guy and he has been through shit just like we have. He deserves to be relaxed around his family and he can’t. It’s bugging Dean because he hates seeing Cass so upset and it’s just confusing.” He walked over to the Archangel checking him again to make sure he was comfortable. “It’s hurting our family and we are all tired of it. We might not be normal, but even we deserve to be comfortable to each other in our own home.”
Shrugging, after all there was nothing they could do, “Hey it happens, I did tell him to keep an eye out for anything Angel related.” Besides if need be he and Cass could fly over to his place and look up what they needed. He just would have to call Bobby ahead of time to get an idea as to where it might be found in his ramshackle house.
“Thanks buddy, I’ll get our gear ready.” Squeezing his arm, deciding not to push Sam any more than they had accidentally done that morning, he left to pack their gear.
Shaking his head, sighing as he knew the Angel was correct. “Yeah, okay we need to get back to camp then, how do you want to do this? Pack him on the bike? We make camp here? Don’t really have supplies…”
Knowing his requests would probably be ignored he still had to try. “Guys just keep it down. I’m going to try and get some sleep.”
The Fae were a fickle people, made up of many different breeds and temperaments, but those of the Summer court upheld duty honor and loyalty. If you showed it then you were returned with it. And these warriors had all upheld their side in full measure.
Okay first half done. I hope people enjoyed it. When I get the chance I'll post the second part.
Chuckling he nuzzled at his neck. “Of course we are equal Dean and always will be. But it would break my heart to do something to so disappoint you. Just as it would hurt me if you did something in return. Maybe I should have used other words, not control, but keep me in check if I go wild defending you.” He leaned back, eyes glistening with love and devotion. “Dean, it's a partnership between a human and an Angel. Will you be my partner Dean? Will you be my mate?”
‘It’s not nice to dump me in the filth,’ He whispered as he started lapping at Dean’s rim. He grinned as he heard Dean’s breath hitch. ‘It’s not nice to laugh at me.’ He buried his nose between his cheeks and speared him deep with his tongue, his mate shuddered. ‘But do you know what was the worst part?’ He started to chew at the puckered flesh.
With a smug smile, Cass flipped Dean over, much to his startlement if his grunt was anything to go by. Starting at his feet, he moved back up, licking, sucking, nipping, when he reached his knees, he spent quite some time there, knowing they needed extra attention. Dean sometimes had a hard time getting up in the mornings, he didn’t let anyone know, but Cass had heard him limping slightly in the mornings when it was cold. He would not permit his mate to live in pain if he could prevent it. Once he was satisfied with healing his knees, he moved to his pert backside. Spreading those firm cheeks he dove in, licking at the hole which tasted like sunshine, apple pie and stalwart heart. He couldn’t get enough, this was his mate, this was the man who promised himself to him. He would be his forever and he rolled in the waves of contentment from the knowledge.
Cass lapped at his mate’s cock once more, pressing kisses along the shaft before sucking lightly at the tip before starting all over once more. Nibbling the prominent vein, lowering himself to suck first one nut then the other into his mouth. Working to get them as wet and sloppy as possible, then returning to swallow Dean all the way down once more. He listened with pleasure as his hunter squirmed under him, keening when he sucked at his crown hard, forcing Dean to arch his back.
Pushing the door open he closed it behind him, stepping into the private audience chamber of the Royals themselves.
Giving Castiel one more sharp look, Dean returned to his task, reciting the first part of the spell. “Ociri Adriraven Gwalikon Kaerrameth Rheradith.” The purple flames switched to golden whiskey and fresh evergreen, which was odd since Dean’s eyes were candy apple green. Smoke floated in the room as the spell started to activate. The components mixing in the bottom, swirling in a counter clockwise direction till a golden evergreen yin and yang symbol formed within. Reading in the book that this was supposed to happen, he read the next part of the spell. Taking the bowl from the table, all were surprised to see the symbol unmoving as it floated perfectly over the holy water.
Princess Eowarawyn pursed her lips as she thought about the condition of her younger brother’s Consort. Gabriel was weak and his Grace was stolen, she knew the feeling well and had an idea as to what he was going through. He would not be able to fight off the Sluagh in his condition, he would need the help of her brothers. The problem was they had no clue as to what was going on, but her family did. Casting her eyes around the simple room, her gaze fell on the multiple books shelves in the reading corner. Eyes lighting up as an idea came to her she turned to the Factor.
SPNSPNSPN
‘Thank you love, be careful and don’t take chances.’ Cass didn’t like Dean being away from him, wanting to keep him close till any residual feelings he had about Dean being hurt faded away. But having him close to his brother was even worse right now. It was really bothering him why he didn’t want them together and no understanding behind it.
Sam watched as Gabriel followed the man, eyes glaring till he was out of sight. Then Gabe blinked and the blue fire in his eyes was banked but not extinguished. Sam had a feeling they wouldn’t be while they stayed in the restaurant, which wasn’t a bad thing. He had noticed how often Erik checked him out when he and his brothers came in. He had always ignored it as best he could, because he wasn’t interested in him. Besides the life he led would not fit into Erik’s normal view of the world. Seeing how Gabriel neatly put the guy in his place was impressive and also amusing. He should probably be annoyed or exasperated at his Angel, but all he could feel was fondness…
Muffled voice coming from the table, “Sammy how long do you really think it will take for you to find out how to get rid of these things?”
Swallowing the rest of his orange, Dean grunted at Cass. “Dude I can speak for myself.” If he said it a little sharper than he intended well he had had a rough few days.
Sam keeping his eyes very firmly pointed in the direction Cass’s hand was pointing, “Finally, and NEVER EVER tell Dean we had this conversation.”
Taking a deep breath, he released it along with his annoyance. Dean would tease him about it but Cass honestly preferred keeping what they did private. Another sign of his odd behavior manifesting itself, for when they first had mated he hadn’t cared. “It’s fine, but I’m moving my stuff down to the other corridor of living quarters. It’s closer to the library anyway.”
The man tilted his head to the side, contemplating his request before nodding. “Yeah follow me, do you need help picking him up? We can take him to my office, I have a couch in there.”
This is the last chapter for this story. I hope you all enjoyed it. I want to write more in this story line but I need to finish another AU first. I really was surprised at the twists and turns I managed to put into the tale.
“When we have to save the world as often as we do. Yeah doesn’t leave us much time for anything else.” He rubbed his wrists while she removed his foot cuffs. Once they were gone he stood up quickly, keeping an eye on the officers still trying to control the fires cropping up. Reaching the circle in just a few steps, he could see it was the lower torso of the creature they had been hunting for the last two days. “Quick we need salt, gas and matches.”
Though Dean got a pass for the most part. The man had raised him since he was six months old. He didn’t have a chance at his own childhood due to making sure Sam was given his own. Dean watched over him out of love and the need to see he was always protected. Hmm that was a thought, Dean was highly conflicted right now because he was mated to Castiel. He wanted to protect and guard Cass’s heart from all harm, but he couldn’t because he also felt he still needed to protect Sam. Sam hadn’t failed to see how on a few jobs, Dean had been conflicted over who he would run to, when they both had gone down. Thankfully he hadn’t had to choose, other circumstances had cropped up allowing them to save themselves.
Sam pulled into the first cheap motel he could find with a vacancy sign glowing. Which actually wasn’t that hard to do since this was a semi-destination town for hunters, fishers and hikers during the spring and summer months. Fall was similar but it was also the time when the tourists liked to come and see the colors changing, look at the small craft fair which took place on the other end of town, and maybe pick up some Christmas gifts before all the shopping really went crazy.
“Oh shit Dean sorry, didn’t realize the spell would target you of its own will.” Sam exclaimed, hazel eyes contrite.
Sam, Dean and Charlie all looked at him in confusion, before Dean with a I don’t really want to know sigh, “Okay I’ll bite, why do you say that?” HIs stomach was starting to turn, probably upset with how much food he had ate, but he was still hungry.
“Wait how come they can but you can’t?” Her own eyes were glittering with fascination, even as she held a bush aside for him to walk pass.
‘Gabriel? Who the hell was Gabriel?’ Jason wondered to himself as he watched Dean return.
Dean holding his friend closer, letting him take what comfort he needed from him, let the bunker thing go for now. He had other more pressing issues to work through with him. “So then what happened with that guy? You losing your temper at him?”
SPNSPNSPN
“What of the forest itself? You said there were dark trolls patrolling the area. And that Dean’s Consort destroyed the forest. What restitution are you making for its destruction?” This time it was the King who was asking.
Dean with a smile, stroked down his love’s length, listening to him hiss in pleasure and did as he was bid. Slowly rubbing up and down, over and over, bringing sweet torture to the creature who could have anyone he wished and chose him. A person who had so little to offer anyone else and yet still saw value in him. He felt the other shudder in his hand and knew they would soon have to begin transitioning to the bed. But a few more minutes of soft bonding never hurt anyone.
Shaking his head sadly, “No, Sam, my days of being able to fly is over. Healing and a few other things are about all I can accomplish now.” Cass said quietly, hating to have to admit to one of his biggest flaws now.
“They showed up soon after we left to chase the monster Dean. You had taken to the sky to battle it, so Sam had to borrow a motorbike to follow you. Someone called them in regard to the lady you saved.”
Dean grabbing a fork, started digging into his food, Sam already munching on his. “True but we don’t know how many are out there, trolls travel in family units and I have a feeling we are probably looking at a large family. I don’t want you getting burned out if there are too many.”
“That is the sum of information I have at this moment your Highnesses. Someone sought to use the Second Son’s Consort as some sort of power supply from what I can discern. Why they wished to I do not know yet. I have people out searching even now to collect more information about it.”
“I love you too Dean.” God Cass was happy, he was getting everything he wanted.
He raised his eyes from the Archangel and instead watched the forest. Cass and Dean were expending so much energy together that they were now glowing brightly. No doubt people would wonder where it was coming from and send out parties to search. Never mind people thought the woods were dangerous, the police would definitely send out search teams to investigate and he knew they needed to leave before they were caught. He didn’t even want to contemplate the questions they would be asked about Gabe, or the large swath of forest that no longer existed. Best to leave before any of that trouble hit them.
“Of course.” Cass watched as Sam rolled out his own bedroll on top of a self inflating air mattress borrowed from someone. The younger Winchester settled down and with a deep sigh was asleep in moments.
“Are you kidding, no way in hell. This is going to be so cool.” Skipping over to the cat, she threw a leg over the helpfully crouching kitty.
“And the club? Why do I have this instead of my Angel Blade?” He brandished the unwanted weapon in front of him. It was a real weapon at least and not the cheap toys most of the other people at the event had.  At least they let him carry his Angel blade in his belt behind him.
None of them noticed the blanket of fine mist falling on them, causing them to slowly lower themselves to the ground, closing their eyes in Fae induced sleep.
Dean kept up his projection of tranquility, but switched to how it would be so nice to hold Cass while they slept. How it would please Dean to know his mate was safe in his arms, safe enough to sleep. It would give Dean the greatest pleasure to hold him, knowing he found his greatest comfort being held by his hunter. To know he was asleep and wouldn’t wake till he was calm once more. He wanted to feel the peace which only came from Castiel sleeping contentedly in his arms.
Chuckling, Cass broke away from licking at the virgin pucker. “Not a chance in hell Dean, I get to be fucked first.” And he was really looking forward to it. He belonged to Dean, it was only right he be given first claim.
Raising an eyebrow at his mate who was totally not as put out after a spanking as he probably should have been, he decided to get creative. “Hmm Dean since you seem to be enjoying yourself, let’s do something a bit different.”
Oh he would really like it if Sam “helped” him into bed. But he was also getting honestly tired. This is the most work he had done since he was taken. That nap was sounding better and better by the second. Standing he had to place both hands on the table as he suffered a sudden case of dizziness. The next moment strong large hands were supporting him, keeping him from falling flat on his face on the table. “Hey easy there, take your time, there’s no hurry.” Gabe closed his eyes trying to get control of his limbs only to feel himself starting to sink back to the chair.
Talk about a mood killer if Dean wasn’t already used to his Angel’s odd tries at dirty talk. The attempts just endeared him more to his hunter.
“No not exactly.” Cass answered shaking his head.
Intense green eyes met glowing blue. “I can’t because regardless of what I wish, I need to make sure you’re safe, that Sam is safe, the world is safe. This is what my life has always been about Cass, sacrificing what I want, what I need so that others may have what I’m not allowed.” Tears were now flowing down Dean’s cheeks. “I love you to much to not do this, so please don’t ask me again.”
“Yep.” Sam smirked as he opened the driver side door. Not giving Dean the excuse of needing to park it to avoid Cass. From the glare he received from his brother, he knew he was doing it on purpose and wasn’t happy at him doing so. Not that Sam cared, not after realizing his brother had been shot multiple times.
“Because I’m not allowed to be. He deserves so much more, I have nothing to offer him…” Cass admitted softly.
‘I really wish I knew why this keeps happening to me?’ Dean grumbled in his head as his mouth was full with his second fish. He also didn’t miss how Cass only ate one, leaving him a third.
One officer who had emptied their clip into Castiel looked at him with wide frightened eyes.
Puck though had not waited to start rubbing it in his nose, that just cause he was an Archangel didn’t mean he was all that. That there were beings out there who were just as good, and much better looking to boot.
Giving his hunter a nuzzle behind his ear, ‘I know baby and I’m sorry.’
Dean, wearing goggles and a large parka like jacket backwards to protect him from the wind, shouted at Sam. “Sammy for God’s sake change the god damn radio.”
Dean closed his eyes, he knew he was going to regret his next question. “What color are they now?”
Surprised at the choice for Quicklings were not known for being very responsible. “A Quickling? Are you sure?”
“I haven’t a clue, but I think she is guarding him. We will have to discover who she is later. For now I will continue to purge this corruption from Gabriel’s system, but it grows stronger each time. Like it’s learning or drawing on some power.”
“Doesn’t matter how, just that I do. But I need information. Anyone here know anything about the history of the bank? Or maybe the land surrounding the area? Anything to help me out here?” Sam asked even as he returned to Gabriel’s side to check on him. He hated to draw the extra attention, but he had to make sure he was healing properly.
Turning to those who had come with him. “We are heading back.” He pursed his lips as he realized the cat was out of the bag. While he had been sworn to secrecy and would not betray that trust. A god who knew and chose to disregard such directives, since he had not given his word, was a different matter. Looking over at his warriors, all sporting still faces but he could see they were confused, in the little changes of posture and facial twitches. Making yet another decision, one he knew would be the lesser of many evils, “The Winchesters are considered sons of the Queen, King and brothers to the Princesses and shall be treated as such. Any here have a problem with this?”
Closing his eyes Dean gathered his strength to answer him honestly. “No, I don’t. I want to stay, want to be here for you, for Sammy.”
Castiel waved his left arm and the cars there followed. Metal shrieked as it scraped against metal, rendering the material useless for anything other than the scrap heap. Tires flew through the air, landing so hard they bent their own rims before bouncing back into the air. What sounded like gun fire was air actually escaping from said tires if the rims were damaged enough.
“Great talk to you later bitches.” With those final words she hung up.
“Cass will be there.”
“Fine, but I really can wait.” His cock though was stiff as a board and protesting how tight his pants were. It wanted out and it wanted to play.
Puck was a douche bag.
Cass made note of this confirming to himself that what he had planned would be a much better punishment for his troublesome mate. Voice thick with dark pleasure as he sprang his little surprise. “Oh I think I’m going to have some fun here, but to make the lessons stick I think I’ll make it impossible for you to come tonight.”
“You can’t do that now?” Dean wasn’t to surprised, but he had hoped Cass could give it a good thrashing at least.
So much for protecting his mate, like normal he was a failure at even the simplest of tasks.
“She gave us the ability to escape. She ordered us all to retreat, to deliver the Consort to the Second Son, for he, his brother and his Consort were best equipped to deal with the fallen Angel. She ordered us to make haste and what she did next was…” He stopped speaking as he remembered everything, still unable to believe the amount of power one Kapre had let loose because she was bound and determined to fulfill her duty no matter what.
Cass looked down his nose at the other man, feeling he was about to say more. Which he did a moment later. “¿Todos los ángeles tienen alas como la tuya? ¿O sólo aquellos que han caído en desgracia con Dios?” (Do all Angels have wings like yours? Or only those who have fallen out of favor with God?)
“What do you think Cass?” The hunter asked as he took in the lack of activity below. The only movement being what was contained in those dark runes. It smelled so strongly of a trap he was surprised he wasn’t sneezing over it. Still they had to investigate, and determine just what the hell was draining the area of its life force.
Dean, tilting his head to the side so he could look at his brother with one eye, while still leaning on the table. “What’s weird? That I have wings? That they seem to change color whenever they god damn want to? I think we already established this was weird? Come on Sammy, weird is kinda what we do, but really? You have to state the obvious once again?”
Running hands through his hair Sam was distracted as his mind was going in to many directions at once. Grabbing at his shirt he threw it on over his head, pulling it down quickly, taking a few rapid breaths.
Dean and Cass run into trouble before they can even begin the job. Then it gets weird.
“Dean wait…”
Waving his left hand, he smugly blasted 20 service members directly into the trees, listening to their howls of pain and suffering with pleasure. His mate suffered so much, took so much pain unto himself, to protect those who knew not what walked in their world. It was only fair for others to share in his pain. His hunter had almost died tonight and only through luck did he survive. The Angel heard as more orders were shouted, to bring everything they had, calling on the radio for air support, he smirked at their silly hopes.
The hunter pursed his lips, “Great so we are on a rescue mission?”
“Yes?”
“Listen we don’t have time for this, we need to kill that thing.” Sam tried only to be slammed against the trunk again.
He stayed true to his dive, arm out as he was to skewer her, only to be thrown off as a second round of bullets were fired, entering his body. He gritted his teeth as he managed to not make the same mistake twice, stabbing the creature from behind, driving his blade between her wings. She screamed in pain before reaching for his suddenly tumbling form as he lost his flight balance from a third round of bullets hitting him. Still he managed his goal as he tumbled towards the ground, he had killed the bitch.
She didn’t miss the direction he turned and many tiny moments lined up. Her eyes brightening as she realized Dean and Cass were not the only ones who deserved to be happy. She did have a soft spot for the younger Winchester and if she could meddle enough to bring him his own happiness, she was all for it. And after she meddled, she could sit back and badger them into giving her access to all those wonderful books and tomes they kept locked away from her. She smirked at how funny her boys were to think they were pulling one over on her. Still she did care for them and she liked it when they were happy.
“Dean…” He paused to blast a troll which tried to send a boulder their way. He blasted the boulder and sent the shrapnel back towards them. They grunted as their thick skin registered more the spikes of holy energy than the rock itself. “This is getting tedious, we should just destroy them, I could do it in one strike.”
Leave me a review if you like it.
He grimaced at the other person.

Cass coughed beside Sam, arm hanging limply for a few minutes while he got his bearings back. “Cass you okay?” Sam shouted over the wind.
“When I carried you back in my arms last night…” Cass started to explain only to be interrupted by the elder once more.
He was a blur of motion, ducking down under arms which were reaching for him, kicking out legs, cutting with his Angel blade. Sweat dripping from his over heated face as he fought for what he loved most. His wings radiating with holy fire, stabbed with the razor sharp tips into the faces, torsos whatever he could reach, as he raced to his Angel. He could feel the agony Castiel was in as his Grace was blocked from him. Grace which he now realized was housed within his own being. The bond they shared transferring the power to the one who was free to move. Snarling Dean took advantage of the extra boost of power. His body glowing as if HE was the celestial being instead of his injured mate. His wings were stretched out, beheading those who were trying to over whelm him. Screams were constant as the demons started to realize if he touched them, they would no longer exist.
He raced ahead, Dean keeping up with his falcon wings, and he couldn’t help himself as he took a moment to enjoy the way those cinnamon colored limbs moved naturally through the sky. They were his mate’s second best feature, the first being his eyes which shined with so much love and commitment towards him he felt unworthy of such a man.

Cass looked to where Dean stood, before looking to where the hunter was looking. Seeing what he was after, he rose from his crouch, running to his friend. “Right!” Grabbing him once more, he put all his efforts into getting Dean into the air.
“Dean wake up, we’re home dude.” Sam called out quietly watching as Dean slowly started responding.
‘I wasn’t to harsh?’ Worry coating his words as just how rough he had been started to come home to the gentle Angel.
Reaching his hand up, stroking his cheek to reassure his most important treasure. ‘Always love, listen I would love to play but we have bigger issues. Prepare yourself for it is not a pleasant thing.’
The manager came to his door and opened it quickly, stepping out of the way. “You can place him on the couch, then if you would be so kind as to tell us just what the hell is going on?” He demanded even as he pointed to his large leather couch.
Turning to the person behind the counter, he took in the sight of an older matron staring at them with worry and concern. Returning his gaze to Dean,Z he was just in time to catch him as he collapsed against his shoulder.
‘Very well Dean, I’ll inform Sam and we will be right out.’ Putting the final dish in the rack, Cass dried his hands.
“Garth? I thought Bobby was handling phones?”
Gathering their things they started their way back to where the First Prince and his Consort slept. What the future would hold they didn’t know but would do everything they could to prepare for it.
Sam reaching out to try and stop his brother, yet not wanting to get to close and ram into his back. “Dean, Dean wait stop, you’ll hurt yourself.” The taller man called out trying to calm the panicking man.
Too bad the wings were not reflecting what Dean’s own moods were, it would be interesting to see. For now Sam would just have to make do with what was available and come up with opportunities to get them together.
He could see the tree tops rapidly approaching, knew he would only have one chance at this. His wings were killing him as he strained to master flight while fighting at the same time. But he continued to push himself, planning on using the snow covered mountain to finish her off if he could. Listening to instincts which were whispering constantly in his head, pouring knowledge into his mind even though he didn’t have the skill to back it up yet. When he heard them scream NOW, he spread his wings to their fullest extent, thousand of commands flowing over his nerves to his ligaments and muscles as they tried to obey his command. He angled his wings just right, ignoring the deafening boom which followed his spreading wings. Skimming the snow covered mountain side, dodging boulders and the occasional tree, he knew if he hit any it would be instant death for him. He didn’t even dare spare a second to look over his shoulder as he flew, not till he could clear the rocky surface. He ignored the bushes, twigs and thorns which ripped into his skin and clothes as he raced by. Same with the frost which coated his shoulders, weighing his wings as powder as his flight blew ice and snow over him. Animals not scared off by the sounds of battle above, jumped from their hidden groves, their tree homes, some only feet from where the flying man drove himself. Dean ignored it all intent on killing the creature behind him using any means necessary.
“We also noticed you had about 7 beers back at the dinner.” This Dean kept quiet about, if he didn’t confirm he wasn’t incriminating himself. The cop noticed and narrowed his eyes. “How about you step out of the car and run a few quick tests huh?”
It took him a few moments for him to realize Dean was speaking to him, his ears ringing with the force of the air he was trying to pass. What he did know and take comfort in was how his hunter’s arms never failed to hold him up. Letting him borrow his strength when his own was focused on cleansing his lungs.
“My Lord please, no insult was meant, in fact there has been a development.” She glanced at the two guards, narrowing her eyes in silent orders to keep their mouths shut over what they were witnessing. If they didn’t they would soon find important parts to them removed from their bodies. Satisfied when they returned to their duties, faces set in stone, she returned her attention to the Royal Factor. “Please my Lord follow me.” Her voice dropping into ranges of requests which needed immediate attention.
“Weak your Majesty, he was terribly hurt from the condition described to me, both from the Commander’s description and from the reports I’m receiving from the Fifth Company. But your elder son’s Consort managed to restore his body and heal as much as he could. We don’t know much more as Prince Dean sent Prince Sam and the Consorts away to rest. The Prince stalled the hunters searching the forest for them all.”
Shrugging as if it was the only option in the 60 room motel, “Hey it was that or on the other side of the compound. Didn’t think that would be to good. And I didn’t want anyone moving in and possibly finding our stuff.”
Bowing the messenger was quick to relay his news. “My Lord word has come from those watching the Second Son and his Consort. It appears they have decided to go for a drive and do some shopping.”
The Queen shook her head. “No Robin Good-fellow, see about your duties and keep us informed, take your time but not to much, for we wish to see the Second Son enjoy the happiness the First now enjoys.”
Hope you all enjoy this one. It has a bit of this and that.
“Oh fuck Cass please, god please let me come, or fuck me or do something but do something!” Dean panted as his mind was overwhelmed with pleasure.
“Thanks, Dean and Cass deserve to be happy.” As he spoke he looked over at the sleeping Angel.
Sam revving the bike, hit the throttle, sliding the back wheel around, heading towards the mountains. “Here we go show me Cass.”
‘Keep safe mate.’

“Yes Dean.” Castiel sighed, he had kinda been hoping to get Dean to take him again. He loved it when he was filled with his mate. But he also understood where Dean was coming from. He also was thinking the hungrier he became the hornier as well. Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way he knew he needed to eat, it would make Dean happy and he would do anything to please his man.
“What? Where they hell did they go? When did they go?” This is all he needed those two wandering off looking for trouble. Though normally trouble also found them, especially the good natured Angel.
SPNSPNSPN
“Of course I can, where do you want to go?” Castiel asked as he walked beside Dean, also keeping an eye out for those who might be around them. Course his motives were more along the line of making sure there were no hidden monsters or other trouble making entities.
‘Dean I don't want to give Sam up either. Not only is he your brother, but he’s mine too. I love him and want him in our lives. Let’s not give in just yet. I will be honest though, taking this break from being near him has helped me. I am feeling better, I want to make it work with our family.’
Dean woke slowly and leisurely, every muscle in his body lax after the best sleep of his life. Honestly he had never felt so good, his body pliant as if he had just been laid only more so. He blinked his eyes open and the first thing he could see was feathers. Clearing his eyes more, he noticed his room was covered in multiple feathers of all colors, though the most dominate were the black and brown ones. Black ones tipped in electric blue outlined with light green, while the cinnamon ones were tipped in candy apple green with sapphire outlines.
Pointing with his hand over the tree tops he clarified the direction Dean was located. “Near those mountains, I just saw him dive towards both monsters.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Let me know what you think but no flames. I'll just use them to start my burn barrel.
Dean woke late the following afternoon, alone and feeling more rested than he had in a long time. Slowly sitting up he stretched his wings along with his arms over his head, pleased at the way they didn’t complain for once. Looking around he wasn’t surprised Castiel wasn’t with him, the Angel tended to recover faster than a human, but discovering where he had gone might be difficult. He would deal with it after coffee. Standing he walked over to his dresser and pulled out new underwear and jeans. He sighed as he wished he could put on a shirt, but his wings wouldn’t let him and he wasn’t about to rip them up when he didn’t need to.
Scrambling to move, Dean pressed his right hand to the wall, watching as the moonlight seemed to make his knuckles translucent. As he held it there the light flowed over his fingers entering five depressions which then started filling five channels which spread to more channels. It was all glowing with silver blue moonlight, motes of stardust flickering above the channels as the power continued to flow. Further and further they spread, running up the outer edge of the portal walls, the arched top. Filling in certain images of creatures Dean was surprised to recognize, as he didn’t know the fae put their images on anything. But there was a clear picture of one of those big nipple fairies. Another of a tall, thin woodsy looking creature with leaves growing out of its head. Another was of a short, long eared munchkin wearing, oh for the love of god, a Robin Hood hat. How did they miss these images the first time?
Reaching over to the side table, he pulled out the lube, dribbling a generous amount into his hand and over their cocks. Gripping them in one hand he set to work jerking them off. ‘Don’t come Cass not till I’m in you, I want to come inside you.’
Slamming his hands together he snarled out a word in a language only meant for Angels to understand. The results of his command? Doors, hoods, trunk lids all separating from their hinges, flying in opposite directions. Engines exploding from their bays, mounting brackets visibly torn from their welds.
“What the fuck? Oh sweet Jesus what the hell is going on? Sammy? Cass? Please could someone explain why I seem to have brown wings? I thought they were yellow a minute ago.” He placed his hands on his hips, glaring at his sibling, knowing he had to have something to do with this.
“Thanks, come on, this place has good burgers and awesome salads.” He climbed out of the car, watching as Gabriel did the same thing. “They also have some really great chocolate cake.” He smirked when he saw Gabe’s eyes light up at the idea of sugar. “And yes you can get some if you like.”
Propping Gabe on his chest, ripping and pressing his shirt to the wound which was slowing even as he spoke. “What do you want?” He glared at the three who had not stopped looking at them. The other people in the lobby, quiet and laying face down on the floor, hardly moved, didn’t make any sound and looked to be in some sort of trance state. Which might work in Sam’s favor if he didn’t have to worry about them?
“NOOOOOOO this cannot be! The power is MINE! How dare he take back what now belongs to ME!” Gathering his dark energy around him he struck the bond between the Archangel and his stolen Grace. Snarling as his magic did nothing, it was reflected back at him, burning his own channels as holy energy stabbed through his darkness.
Spikes ran down the entire spine of the creatures, along with having them at point of shoulder and hip. Two tails whipped around bouts of electricity charging between the points.
His mate took his eyes off the monitor to meet his mate. ‘Do you understand me Castiel? You will NOT go into those woods PERIOD!’ The muted rage he sent down their bond let him know Dean would do exactly what he threatened if he even tried it. Cass was possessive of Dean but his hunter was protective of him. He would lock Cass up faster then he could blink if he thought the Angel was going to take off without him.
Waving his bitching away, “Whatever, we need to get going.”
Still he felt a hell of a lot of contentment at the idea of his Angel influencing his brother’s…
“I don’t want to, waste of brain power.” He stood up again and walked to Sam’s side, plopping down on the table and leaning into his personal space. “Come on Sam let’s go out. I’ve been stuck in this bunker forever. I’m doing better. I can stay up longer and I really would like to see the sky.” Plus he was dying of curiosity over what exactly was going on between Dean and Castiel. Sam had been remarkable closed mouth about it all, which only made him want to know more. He didn’t like being kept in the dark and he had a feeling he was missing something big between the two.
Eyes skimming he agreed easily, sidestepping a set of squarish rocks balanced like the ones from that movie Lion King. “Very much so Charlie.” He sighed as he thought of other reasons why they needed to be together.  “I want them together, I really do, Dean and Cass need each other. I don’t think they realize it, but they balance each other in ways impossible to explain. Cass reins Dean in, while Dean makes Cass think outside the box.”
“Oh Fuck Dean, feels so good. You’re mouth is your best feature, oh do that again, damn it, sooooo good. Fuck so god damn good.” Stretching his hand out, he placed it on his hunter’s head, keeping him where he was doing the most good.
“Of course. Is there anything else I may answer or help with your Majesties?” He met the eyes of each Royal and his Lordship.
When the hell did he start thinking of Gabriel as HIS Angel? Hell he had just resolved to give him a chance. To simply get to know him and see if they could make a go of it. What had changed in the last 10 minutes to make him want to claim the little shit? Watching the road as he drove he thought hard, what had changed?
Fuming with frustration, “Yeah but more is going on then I think we know.”
Running a hand through his hair, he grimaced as he felt dirt flake off. “What? Again? What the hell is this place? What is sapping all the strength around here?” He yawned as he absently scratched at his chest with his other hand.
Leaving he went to inform the Royals that more was going on in their court than anyone possibly realized. Especially as a messenger had been sent to inform him of the situation and he never arrived. There could be many reasons for this, but with other instances which had happened over the last several months, only one stood out to him.
“Yeah?” He asked as he slid into the drivers seat. Turning the key and starting the smoothly running machine.
Mumbling Dean blinked his eyes open, trying to focus on his surroundings. The first thing he noticed was the warmth seeping into his feathers. He was laying on something which made him feel safe and secure, so he looked behind him to see Cass looking down at him. Startled he tried to move, only to have his Angel’s arms tighten even more around him. “Easy Dean, you need to rest.”
“What is the status on the First Son and his Consort?” Puck asked brusquely.
Also a couple of tiny cameos for grins and giggles.
‘Dean? Were you reading my mind again?’ While he didn’t normally mind, when he started getting depressed he preferred he didn’t. He didn’t want to upset his mate with his own problems.
“Right, let me get my gear, I’ll be out in a few minutes.”
“I understand the problem Sam.” Cass rolled his eyes at the younger man, he knew what was at stake, they all did. But he wouldn’t be hurried when it came to Dean’s welfare. The man was dangerously low on energy, his wings taking a significant part of what he produced. It was a factor he had not considered when he was hit with the spell. Then to top it off with flying for the first time and battling, yes the man needed to rest and recover. They just didn’t have time for it.
“Lot of people are not happy with what happened earlier. You know, when Cass launched that guy through the camp? Yeah him and his buddies are out looking for you both. Charlie caught Cass before he made it into camp. But you’ll need to disappear from sight, those wings will act like a beacon.”
Frowning Dean did the only thing he could, running his fingers through the softness and being extra careful in what he pulled out. They would discuss this later, but for the moment, making Cass comfortable was more important. Still he sighed on the inside as he knew they needed to talk about this eventually. Cass would only hide something like this, if he was feeling like he couldn’t defend Dean properly and was ashamed of it. Which meant his little talk this morning had to have hit him even harder than he meant it to. Shit!
Panting heavily as he his body shook above his mate’s, the Angel took a few moments to recover his senses. Once he did he waved his hand in front of him. Instantly Dean’s bonds disappeared, and the room was once more set to rights. The only noises, Dean’s panting as he strained against the raging hard-on he still had, even the cock ring had disappeared.
Still so many people coming to admire his wings did have a negative effect on one person. Cass was less than pleased as the day wore on to have so many people near his hunter. It didn’t take long for Dean’s appendages to acquire a single solid color of furious red all along the top of his wings. No matter what the others changed to, those always stayed the same color, which Sam was careful to not mention. Dean himself for once decided to not confront Cass on it either, because both men knew it came from the Angel. An Angel who was growing considerably worst as more people interacted with them, and asked to touch Dean’s wings. The fallen Holy Warrior was even seriously thinking of taking his club to a few of the assholes who were bothering them, only his iron will and control kept him from doing so.
Dean watched as he climbed up on a stool behind the counter next to an ancient cash register. Adjusting his glasses he unfolded his paper and settled down to reading. Trying to decide what he should do, he slowly wandered over to where the maps were located, wondering what they were like. He drove everywhere and sometimes finding places which no longer existed was a pain in the ass. Old maps were wonderful for finding where they used to be.
“I know it does but you need to settle down anyway. I’m almost done, then we can finish showering.”
He took the room temperature water waiting in the glass, not wanting to shock his system after the warm soup with cold, and let him sip once more. Gabe managed twice then he was done for good. Sam helped resettle Gabriel in bed, tucking him in warmly, as he gazed down at his already closed eyes. The smile he sported mirrored the one the sick man was displaying slightly. Course the younger hunter did miss the part when he stroked his hand through Gabriel’s hair absently, concentrating so much on how just a few spoonfuls of soup and a bit of juice had done wonders for him. After making sure he was deeply asleep,  Sam took the dishes back to the kitchen to deal with later. Serving up another bowl of soup, grabbing another juice box, he made a side trip to the library to pick up another book. Supplies in hand he returned to Gabriel’s side, supremely content with how things were going so far.
“Oh hell yes I do.” Seeing Cass like this, happy and willing to be used, always made him horny and both knew it wouldn’t take much to get him off. Gripping his Angel’s head in his hands, he thrust in all the way, his balls knocking against his chin as he raced for his own climax. “Christ your mouth is sinful Cass, god I love it.” He threw his head back as he felt himself approaching.
Pressing his cheek to his hunter’s neck he took deep breaths, trying to calm himself. ‘I don’t want you doing this Dean. I don’t want you near him, I don’t want to share you.’ He wrapped his own arms around the younger man, holding tightly with his fear.
Gazing down at his passed out brother, worry deep in his voice. “So what do we do now? We need to kill that monster.”
Charlie nudged Sam, indicating with a head jerk to look at the two sleeping on the mattress. Both smiled at the sight, which then turned to incredulous looks at what played out next.
“Sean you sly bastard, you were taking no chances were you.” Sam mumbled admiring the long dead man. This was a man who cared about his fellow man and had taken steps to protect them. It was through time and changes which happened to the building which caused those protections to slowly fail. But he had done a good job with what he had at the time.
