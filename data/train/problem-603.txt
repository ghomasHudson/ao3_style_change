Exhaustion must have eventually taken me in the end, as I fell into consistent unconsciousness in the wee hours of the morning, and was roused from sleep by steps on the staircase. Once I acclimated to the unfamiliar surroundings that were not my own bedroom my brain focused, and I remembered at once the events of the previous night, and the work that was to be done that morning.
Coming here had not satisfied that void either, for my real wish was to have someone to share a space with again, to share the paper with in the mornings, to go on walks with in the afternoons, and to smile at over our respective books in the evenings. While that did not seem possible to find in this environment (although I knew those that had found it here, I had no hope for myself, my heart belonging to someone I firmly believed to be at the bottom of some Swiss waterfall), here I was able to find conversation again, and could speak about my troubles unburdened by the lies society dictated I hid them with. And so I had in this sanctuary - revealed bits of myself and voiced emotions I had kept hidden for years, my feelings for Holmes the chief of it but also how lonely and bereft his loss had truly made me feel.
I moved from room to room around the apartment. I was bored. I collapsed on the couch, staring at the mess around me. Case files, notebooks and the remnants of past experiments litter all the surfaces. I knew John would be annoyed when he got back from work. He hates it when he has to clean up after me. A sudden sinking feeling gripped me. Why was I feeling this? Guilt. I felt guilty. Why? I quickly pushed it out of my mind.
We both know that! Think she's so into Sherlock that she's deluded herself into thinking that he loves her too - JW
Well for one, I haven't seen you since my first night here at Greg's party. I haven't even seen you wondering around the college for that matter. Two, all we do is text. Surely it would be better to actually talk face to face for once? - JW
"Fine! Just stand there! I'm leaving, I'll be back tomorrow." I turned away when he grabbed my arm and spun me around so I was facing him again.
Telling him the truth now would be foolish. "I'm fine John. Just wondering when you could be released. I doubt you want to be here. I'll go speak a doctor." I rose from my chair and started to leave when John spoke.
I didn't realise I had actually been giggling. 'Oh, no reason.' I replied. he was studying me; his eyes were glistening. They were one of his best features. Wait...'one of his best features?' Why am I thinking about this? I am not gay! I tore my eyes away from his, a blush creeping up my face.
Whilst these thoughts were running through my mind, I had started to smile at John. He truly was an infectious man. Looking at him now, and watching the way the florescent lights of the Kitchen made his eyes look like to giant orbs gazing up at me, made me want to forget everything and just laugh along with him. The voice in my head made itself known again. 'You could just reach over and grab him. Just lean over and embrace him. Make him yours, once and for all.' Could I? What would happen? I'm sure John wouldn't appreciate me diving on top of him and enveloping him in my arms...wait. I have to stop this. I need to stop this. I need John to hate me so I don't have to love him anymore. I replied to John in my most deadpan voice. His face dropped instantly. I hated myself for doing this to him, but in the long run this will be for the best. If not, I know my feelings for my blogger will escalate even more to a point where I act on them. I do that and John will leave. Which is not preferable. I know there is a part of me which hopes John feels the same and I would give anything for that but in reality, John believes we're just friends and that's how it will stay in order to keep him.
Me and Sherlock never spoke about Irene or the case again, it didn't make sense to. I guess we both wanted to put it behind us and leave it in the past. I had woken up to an empty flat this morning,m which wasn't unusual so I did my own thing as per usual. I made myself a cup of tea and once I had finished it, I got dressed and went downstairs to visit Mrs Hudson. "Ooh good morning dear. Didn't expect to see you today." She said as I entered her Kitchen. "Morning Mrs Hudson, Sherlock's disappeared again so I thought I'd pop in and say hello." I said, looking round her little Kitchen. I've always liked Mrs Hudson's place, it's not as big as our flat upstairs but it's a lot more homely than 221B. She started busying making tea and grabbing biscuits as I turned on the telly to find Connie Prince talking about the newest fashion. Ah the wonders of daytime telly. I spent many hours with Mrs Hudson talking about the neighbours, what Mrs Turner next door was doing lately and discussing whatever was happening on the show we were watching at that moment. Eventually, I heard the main door go , announcing Sherlock's arrival home.
"All you need to know is that we haven't been robbed. Just go to bed." You have got to be kidding me. Something is going on so why won't he tell me?
He looked disappointed with me. Like he expected me to know exactly what he was on about. Like he'd completely forgotten he hasn't taken me on any cases in  over a month. I saw the realisation hit his face, he quickly adjusted it back and explained.
I nodded in understanding although I was just as discontented by this as my friend was, who stood up once again from his chair to pace once more the small space afforded to us. His spine was ramrod straight, but his eyes betrayed a thunderstorm of emotions, fear among them. “If indeed that cadaver shares similarities with the poor soul who met his end here, then we have a very different, larger danger on our hands.”
I will report as a matter of future notice, that Mrs. Hudson was quite cross with us when morning arrived and papers remained strewn about the sitting room, forgotten in our sudden disinterest the previous night. However, using our combined powers of flattery we were able to mollify her into bringing us a hearty breakfast that we shared as we did thousands of meals before, albeit this time with matching grins of contentment and resolution.
Macnair had once again returned to giving Holmes’ alias the third degree about his absence, and as the masterful actor that he was he took it in stride, answering in such a way that had I not known his real identity, I would undoubtedly have fallen for. When at last Abbott, who I guiltily realized had barely spoken a word all evening, finally made a motion to leave, William Vernet echoed him, and as we stood to make our goodbyes he once again brought my hand to his lips.
I was in the main room of the Club once more, but this time it was completely empty of people, and all the chairs and tables had been cleared to the side. I looked around to see if there was any explanation, but I had barely begun to ask aloud if I was alone when I heard some noise behind me. Turning, I saw Holmes smiling with two wineglasses in hand, and one extended to me.
“It is what you wanted is it not? Watson as your companion for life - a concept I agree is most desirable, as I have cherished in it myself. You would be the luckiest man in the world to have him by your side.”
Holmes closed his drawer abruptly, and walked past me to the door. “Good,” he said, stiffly, “then you may lead the way.”
“I am.” I stepped forward, taking a breath but otherwise not hesitating. I did not spare a look at Holmes’ reaction. “You have my word, Macnair. If you win, I will go with you, no questions asked, in whatever manner you like. As long as the murders cease.”
It was that last thought that sent a jolt of realization through me. “Holmes,” I gasped, “what of Lestrade? What explanation can we give now of events that do not implicate us as well?”
I did not fully understand the purpose of our separation, I will admit, but as usual I trusted Holmes’ intentions, and that whatever he was doing on his own end, we were working toward the same goal. As tedious as spending those few hours were, I managed nonetheless, and it was as if no time had passed when I was suddenly being tapped on the shoulder by one of the street urchins Holmes employed as his “Irregulars”, looking quite insistent. I sized the boy as being around eight years of age, and smiled at him genially.
He did not meet my gaze, continuing to scan the body in that recognizable calculated way that could pull any mortal man apart within minutes. He fingered gently the man’s clothing, brushing over and removing the three single flowers that were pinned to the man’s left breast pocket, along with something else I could not catch a glimpse of. Finally he then looked up at me, his expression unreadable but filling me with cold dread all the same.
“Now,” I cleared my throat, “do you have more protestations and reasons for me not to love you? Should I ask then, for what reasons do you love me?”
I allowed Abbott to precede me up the stairs. He was a younger man, some ten years my junior I estimated, and if I was not mistaken in Holmes’ intent, could be seen to have some resemblance to me when I had first moved back to London - blonde with blue eyes, and thin but sturdy, albeit lighterskinned than I had been then.
And with that she took her leave and retreated down the seventeen steps. As soon as she did Holmes began to pace, his usual path upon our carpet significantly shortened by the corpse’s long legs. He stopped suddenly, spotting something on the stand beside my chair. A small water cup, which he sniffed at like a hound before swiftly looking to me.
I jumped up from where I had taken a tentative seat on the settee. Holmes rose at once as well, one graceful movement.
“Not even Mycroft?” I asked, but my tone was light, and I knew that he knew that I had truly forgiven him, and that the matter had been put to bed.
Obligingly, I looked through the index and found the page he requested before reading aloud. “Petunia. Resentment and Anger.”
We all stood up then to leave, but Abbott spoke up before we could go far. “Mr. Macnair! You seem to have forgotten your nosegay.”
In the epicenter of it all sat Holmes, on the floor by the drawers that held his files. They had seemingly been emptied, but for the life of me I could not see why. Breakfast had been laid out but was starting to become buried, and I stepped into the room to remove a few leaves from my own plate.
“That is why I am here, is it not, Mr. Holmes?” Macnair ended, his gaze trained on Holmes’ door which swung open at once, revealing my friend behind it, his expression speaking of blazing anger.
“My dear Holmes. I will only say this once, so I beg you to commit it to memory. Love is never a struggle. Every beat of my heart that went towards you, even while I believed it to be in vain and unrequited, was done consciously. In all those years spent I never once thought ill of the feelings themselves because to do so would be to think ill of you for causing them in me. And if I loved you as I do I could never bring myself to do that.”
“I had never hoped to love and be loved in such a way, and yet here it is so easily before me, real without a doubt. But I have learned now that that is the nature of love, dear heart, that it exists for the same reasons that flowers grow - a display of Providence’s simple kindness.”
Lestrade had an arm restraining Abbott, who was now in chains but otherwise did not move. The both of them wore matching looks of shock. Holmes had stood up, his trousers wet but unheeded, and was watching the scene with a grave look of sorrow on his fine featured face.
“So you have never had occasion to be jealous? I suppose if not with your wife, then with previous dalliances?”
“But then Watson, I am a fool!” he intoned, turning back to me. “Indeed, I am no smarter than any of the idiots they staff at Scotland Yard these days! For I call myself a detective and yet for years-!
To you, they probably are. We can't all be amazing genius', can we? Anyways, I'll text you later otherwise I'll be late. Bye! - JW
I sat myself down in one of her dining chairs, preparing myself mentally. Once a coffee was placed in front of me, I told her everything. I don;t know where it all came from but it all came out. I had only planned on telling her about the John/Irene problem. Instead I told her how much I adored John; how I'd been ignoring him and how I'd pissed him off by bringing her home back.
"Sherlock, what's going on? What happened to John?" Lestrade questioned. How would I even begin to explain?
I slept fitfully, even with Holmes’ assurances, not helped in the least by the menacing visages of the criminal portraits that adorned his bedroom. I found rather more solace than I should have in the simple scent of him on the bedclothes, and when I did wake in the night it was indeed a comfort as he said to be able to view my friend sitting in his armchair by the fire, safe yet keeping guard.
“His actions were his own, Holmes! It was a quick one, yes, but it was his decision alone to pick up the revolver and point it at Macnair, and I will not have blame put on him for having saved your life!”
We then sent Abbott away, with some other instructions and a warning to stay vigilant. Then Holmes and I were off as well, to tail Macnair and take note of the details that made his murders predetermined. Before we could do so, however, he went to the drawers that held his records, rifling through papers to find something in a way that made me inwardly groan at the future cleanup.
“As you know I have in all our time together found you to be a comforting companion, due most of all to your predictability in habits and mannerisms. And yet you equally never fail to surprise me, and I never get your limits, even now. You bring a variety to my life that I value very highly, but that cannot be expressed in words, especially in the ledgers I catalogue criminals in.” His lip quirked.
“As am I,” said Holmes, not even bristling at Lestrade’s slight. “But all is well and truly over now.”
I nodded, and hoped my face accurately depicted my readiness. He went to touch my hand, before thinking better of his action and retrieving it. “Then I shall see you at our quarters soon. Stay safe, Watson.”
And then he didn’t spare another breath before unraveling the tale of Mrs. Knightley’s thievery in his dramatic baritone, leaving me to play the enraptured audience once more.
“He tends to do that, doesn’t he?” Macnair’s grin had become much larger. “His loss then! Of course we shall come then, it will be a treat to call upon you.”
“I will give you a hint, my dear Watson.” My heart clenched at his specific word usage, and I regretted for the umpteenth time the amount to which I had let this vile man into my confidence. “There is no police presence joining us here tonight, nor will there be. For to bring me forward to the police without confession would bear the great and wisely foreseen risk that I would be brought to trial, giving me the chance to expose you and your own criminal state. And murderer or not, Johnny, I assure you that the law will not look more favorably upon you than it will on me. That is exactly what your precious detective fears, in the end. The law.”
“Stop.” I told him to no avail, as he merely chuckled, sitting up at the edge of the chair to pontificate, his grin back on his face but now unbidden in its sinister quality.
It was not too often that I doubted my friend’s regard for me, but it does happen on occasion, and perhaps more frequently than I would prefer. Of course, to share rooms and even friendship with a mind like Sherlock Holmes’ was to expect some level of disillusionment to one’s own capabilities, but I had long known of my powers in comparison with his and been in admiration of it besides. How such a man could keep me as a constant companion, however, was a question that had weighed on me for as long as we’d been acquainted, but hadn't dared asked for fear of the reply. It had pressed even heavier during the years I believed him dead and unable to answer.
, he would forgive me for, especially as we were on a case that exposed our dual natures so distinctly.
I flushed somewhat at that, and to my horror Abbott took that to make an erroneous assumption, “Oh! Were you- are you two-”
Mrs. Hudson was poised in front of the door when I arrived, and looked at me questioningly. We had asked her to kindly not answer the door to anyone but Billy and the maid for the next few days, but she was never one to stand quietly at the sign of danger. I gave her a small smile, and tried not to show her my own trepidation, before opening the door.
“It is very nice to have finally made it down here, Johnny, especially since you’ve already had more than enough occasion to see my place.”
I shook my head, but Macnair beat me to it. “No, no, nothing like that, lad. Although believe me, it was not for lack of trying.”
Once Holmes returned of course, those visits became almost immediately unnecessary. I was more content now, to love silently, now that I knew what it was not to be able to have him in front of me to love at all. I moved back into my old rooms at Baker Street and it was as if we had returned back into our old grooves, although I recognized some of the same relief in Holmes’ smiles that I knew were in my own. In returning to my old lifestyle I left behind the one I had picked up in the last year of his absence, and became once again the paragon of good British decency that he had known me for.
Holmes did not blink. “That is somewhat of a given, as we cannot expect anyone willing to send a message in this fashion is doing so out of any goodness in their heart.” Holding them in his left hand, he used his right to pluck the petunia, and then pulled the next. “Hyacinth. And it bears noting that it is yellow, which could hold particular significance in this language.”
- all flower definitions come abridged from http://thelanguageofflowers.com/ (and other google cross-referencing ofc)
“Why then, have you needed to call upon Macnair at night, if you have said that you were not lovers or anything of the kind?” Holmes aired his question all in one stream, thundering ahead as if he did not want to think too hard about the consequences. Again I bit back a kind of smile.
“Thank you, my dear.” I said as evenly as I could control my tone, holding his gaze as long as I could bear before I gave into the urge to look away down to the papers in my hands.
“A mixture of both, sir, we grow what we can, but anything that we cannot we buy from our supplier.”
Ten minutes later, Macnair came outside, and made the journey to the florist’s shop that we had just been in. We watched as he exited with a familiar bouquet some further minutes later, his face grim yet determined in a way that was unfamiliar to me, and set a chill down my spine.
Holmes’ voice was cold, and not nearly at the volume mine had been. “Mrs. Hudson has seen him once now, she knows to not let him in, and he is at least smart enough to know that he will not have convenient access to you in this way again. You are of better use to me here.”
Holmes glared once more at the ceiling. “I do not believe it is. Had she just brought the matter to him in the first place, she would not have worked herself into such a panic and not be out the fee my services demand.”
“I am not averse to alcohol but I am aware of its effects on me, and you and I are both aware of my brother’s fate. Still however, my grief pushed me to a point that on that occasion, my safety was completely in Douglas Macnair’s hands.”
When my eyes were drawn back to Macnair however, I realized he had noticed my lack of focus. He laughed before I had the chance to apologize, “It’s no worry, I was just rambling about people you do not know anyhow.” He then turned to follow where my gaze had been. “Ah Vernet’s back, that is a surprise. I thought we should never see his face here again.”
Lestrade let out a large exhale at that, and I believe I mirrored him. I did not know what to make of any of what had transpired, and Holmes’ expression did not settle my nerves at all.
“That is where I think you are wrong, Johnny, though I am pleased to hear your voice chime in. You are certain of my guilt then?”
Holmes took a seat, putting out his hands. “Of course, of course! You are quite safe as long as you are with us, and you follow my instructions. As for the identity of the suspect - I believe you are to some degree acquainted with Douglas Macnair?”
“Very well then.” Holmes stepped away from the desk and into his armchair, gesturing for Lestrade and I to take a seat as well. I sat at the breakfast table, only then remembering that we had yet to eat that morning.  “Are you familiar, Lestrade, with the so-called language of the flowers?”
“I do not know, sir, for his choices thus far have been as specific as they are strange, and yet he has repeated them every time. If I had not made the assumption that his sweetheart must not understand the true meanings and just prefers petunias, angry as they make other recipients, I would have thought him strange indeed. As it is, I would not recommend you follow his lead.”
Holmes was at the window when we entered the room, and he smiled broadly. “Come in, good morning, Abbott. Oh!, and you’ve been good enough to have visited the barber’s already! Well done.”
If I rolled my eyes at his long-repeated jibe at my work, he either did not see, or did not see fit to reply.
I stood up, having had enough of his tireless pacing, and put a hand on his arm, stilling him at once. “Go on?”
Even as I am a writer myself by profession, I have discovered that there are certain experiences that cannot be likened to another, as they are so extraordinary and unique that they have no clear comparison. To identify the emotions that rose within me upon hearing Holmes say these words would do them a disservice, and thus I will not attempt to do so except to say that I have never been as astronomically happy as in that moment.
We got out some streets away from Macnair’s townhouse residence, and walked the rest of the way. Holmes used this time to bring me up to speed on some other particulars that he had gathered from the man’s person. He stopped our walking all of a sudden, and we swept to the side as he pulled out his cigarette case, handing me his walking stick and gesturing for me to face away from the street, continuing his observations.
I will… make an effort I suppose then, to show it.” He nodded to himself, before looking once more to me. “For you must understand - Watson, there is no one in this world I trust as I do you.”
“Cruel men know no true extremes, Watson.” He was answering my question from before. “I can only imagine that he felt slighted by your absence, and sought to gain back your attention in whatever sick fashion possible, having tired of waiting for your return. The murder in Hyde Park might have sufficed and been his only attack, if only it hadn’t escaped our notice by our being in the Derbyshire at the time.”
“Take what precautions you must, and after you have completed your task you may ask Mrs. Hudson for some small pastry, telling her that Dr. Watson has said it was alright.”
At that, I had no response. It was rare that Holmes entreated me to the kind words he did now, mainly as it was not often in his nature to speak plainly of the friendship between us. When he did, however, it caught me as off guard as any of his actions did, and reminded me once again of his unpredictability. As such I tucked those words beneath my breastbone.
I have on many occasions contemplated my feelings for Holmes, but instead of warring with them as I had during the first years of our acquaintance, I had for a long time now resigned them to be a lifelong experience. They did not wither as I once hoped but rather rooted stronger and more resolute, and before long I began to think of them as just another part of my heart, of myself. My admiration for the man, and the loyalty I had for him were there from the founding of our partnership as more than just fellow lodgers, but they deepened along with my involvement with him. I knew now as I did then that my love for him, unspoken as it always would remain, would sustain me; to have him back again in whatever capacity was enough for me to be content for the rest of my life.
“Flowers…” Lestrade affirmed, before a light came to his eyes, and he sat up straighter. “That reminds me - there was a body found, Mr. Holmes, in Hyde Park on Tuesday morning. Gregson didn’t think anything of it - most likely just a drunk who had had one too many or something of the sort - but it was noted that he had been found with three flowers tucked within his pocket but no identification. The case seemed interesting, but not quite enough to bring the matter to you as you were out of town. No card for Dr. Watson or anything like that though.”
It is a great secret to me how I have kept my inversion unknown to my friend, who has divined entire epics from the state of my pantlegs before. My own journey through discovering this truth in my youth had been long and tedious but done entirely in secret until the army, but when returning to civilian society I did not think twice before hiding it once more. However, I never truly knew how it escaped his notice, as he never once showed an indication that he suspected it, and only ever remarked upon my performance with ladies. It was almost as if my equal interest in men as with women was his one blindspot in his knowing me inside and out, and although I believe I knew Holmes well enough in turn to not give me up to the authorities, I nevertheless kept my inclinations hidden. He was not the inhuman deducting machine I often times have described him as in my stories so as to cover my tracks; however he did have a rather low regard for love of any sort (let alone the one that dare not speak its name, as it had been so definitively termed), and I feared his reaction especially to how my specific interests related to him, bound together as these two secrets were. I had lost him once, and that wound had not healed long enough for me to not still feel keenly its sting.
“Good morning, Watson,” he greeted as I took my seat opposite him, “do you have any engagements for today?”
“Again my dear, I must remind you that love is positive, and that any time spent in love is not a loss at all! The time in which we circled this point, that was time spent molding us into the people that we are now, who are finally at a place in life in which we can express these sentiments as they are and act upon them.”
Macnair spun, and arrogantly sank back into Holmes’ armchair. “I could hardly comment on that, could I? You are a tricky man, Mr. Holmes, and I have had no better source to that fact. I do not see what I could possibly stand to gain from my admittance.”
I lost my battle, and laughed anyway. “After all this time? It is without a doubt.” And in the spirit of no longer leaving things unsaid, and in freeing the words that had been living beneath my breastbone since I could scarcely remember, “I love you.”
Holmes, on the other hand, shrugged at being held at gunpoint. “I have died before, Macnair, and in all that time I have had time to think about how I would prefer to go when the end does come for me, as it does for us all. Neither gunshot wounds or arsenic are at the top of the list, I’m afraid, so I have no preference if this is what it comes down to. However if you are inclined, I do have a suggestion that would make this much more interesting.”
“And yet I obviously have no desire to do so. You have known me to disagree with the law before, dear fellow, and this time is no different. I have long believed that particular section of the Labouchere Amendment to be equally flawed and unjust for the supposed crime it penalizes, and have never been able to make sense of it myself. To my mind all it has accomplished is to give fuel to those criminals that are actually evil, such as blackmailers.”
Let it not be said that I am not aware of Holmes’ methods. While I would never flatter myself to be on his level of aptitude in every manner of deduction and investigation, I had in my years with him endeavored to pick up some skills, and thus when I found myself following the man himself I was not without an arsenal of knowledge. I trailed behind him at a significant distance, helped by the fact that I knew his destination and as such could take alternate avenues to avoid suspicion, as I knew he was equally adept at recognizing and then avoiding being followed.
“Yes, of course I understand your reasoning, but it isn’t about that. It’s about your trust in my abilities! Every time you attempt to shield me from the truth of your actions it stings, because it begins to feel as if you do not think me strong, or smart, or quick enough to handle it and be by your side in whatever you are facing.”
“I am sure you would, Mr. Holmes! Which is why for simplicity’s sake I will have you administer it to yourself.”
“Yes, sir! Basil Dawson!” He grinned through missing teeth, seemingly delighted at my correct identification. “I’ve been asked to deliver a message to you, sir!”
I faced Holmes, who looked to me with some indecipherable expression, but that burned me to the core nevertheless. “Then I have one reason, I suppose, to be grateful for that wretched man’s existence.”
The list finished there. I will confess, I was rather taken aback at the brevity of my record. A small time gang of graverobbers that I had firsthand witnessed the arrest of had been given a lengthier annal and yet I, his friend of so many years, had been given not even a few measly inches.
I placed a hand on his knee so as to halt him and keep speaking, before looking out the carriage window rather than at him. “Those months without you or my wife were dark indeed. I had no true friend left, as Mary’s lover too had emigrated to America to escape her own grief, and it was in this vulnerability that Macnair was able to secure my friendship. I am not blind, I knew then that he had something to hide and was not nearly as genial as he claimed, but I have always believed, perhaps naively, that a man’s past is its own country and that he had had a right to his secrets as I did to mine. Even as my secrets ceased to be so.
He stood then, and beckoned for me to give him the floriography book. I did, while I interjected, “Out? Where?”
I have often observed and even written at length about the effects the completion of a case had on Holmes, ranging from a state of intense exhilaration and smugness to the deflation into ennui that he could just as easily slip into. Over the past decade that I had spent sharing his rooms and in his company I have seen all of these moods and more, and have learned how best to weather each of them.
“I believe,” here Holmes paused. “I belong to this third camp. I believe that flowers for simplicity’s sake may remain flowers, and that they may be given and displayed just due to their being something the eyes feel easier resting on, and not a sign of a hidden agenda. To construct this intricate language around them has taken away from that simplicity.”
He was asking to be polite and as a precursor for some request or announcement, for we both knew that I wasn’t to leave the house for the duration of this particular case for the danger Macnair presented. Even then, I had not much cause to leave, for I had sold my practice when moving back to Baker Street (to a man I knew now without a doubt to be some relation of Holmes’), and what patients I had kept had no appointments this week as I had believed there was a chance I would still be in the country.

Lestrade was abruptly back in the doorway at that instance, making my heart that had already risen to my throat almost leap out entirely. “Sorry, but it seems I’m needed urgently back at the Yard. Is there anything else I can do, Dr. Watson? Perhaps arrange for a police presence outside Baker Street? Patrolmen?” I stuttered at the thought but was saved from answering.
Dawson was rather excitable, and I needed not bother asking how he and his ilk had tracked me down here when I hadn’t once mentioned my location to Holmes. “What is it then?”
Unluckily for me, that was all that Sherlock Holmes was willing to reveal that night, and I was instructed not to press the matter further while he thought of the intricacies of his next steps, taking a seat in his favorite armchair and picking his clay pipe in a brooding silence. I took it as my cue to bid him goodnight, lest I be poisoned by the air as well as his frustrated wit, and trudged up to my room with my thoughts percolating.
I still can't believe they want you to marry someone even though you're sixteen! That's unreal! - JW
I hadn't realised Greg had entered the kitchen. He looked how I felt. Passing him two tablets as well, I took them straight away. I was going to suggest breakfast but the thought of food turned my stomach. Neither me or Greg spoke for an hour, we just flicked through the channels on TV feeling sorry for ourselves. I begun to feel human just as the sun was setting outside. How long have I been here? I knew I had better get back to the flat soon, so I grabbed my things and left Greg's. The cool evening air woke me up instantly. Half an hour later, I reached Baker Street. I knew Sherlock wouldn't be happy but I'm allowed to go out and get drunk with my friend, right? Preparing myself for Sherlock's insults and sarcastic attitude, I entered the flat. Nothing could of prepared me for the scene that met my eyes. Irene and Sherlock were in the middle of the living room, passionately making out. I was frozen in place. Sherlock is straight. Those three words repeated through my mind over and over again until I couldn't stand it any longer. The alcohol from last night was threatening to make a reappearance, so I dashed past them just making it to the bathroom in time. I spent a long time in there not daring to come out. I could hear their voices but I couldn't make out what they were saying. In honesty, I didn't want to know. Switching on the shower, I stepped under the burning water. I didn't change the temperature, I needed to feel the pain. It made me feel. I wanted to wash away my feelings. Only I could fall in love with my straight flatmate. Idiot. Once I got out of the shower, the cold air hit my skin, making me shiver. Crap! I hadn't got a change of clothes. I wrapped a towel around my waist, ready to dash to my room. I had nearly made it to the staircase, when Sherlock caught my attention. He was stood by his chair, just staring at me. I doubled checked I had still had my towel before raising my eyes to meet his. I could see his eyes roaming my torso and suddenly felt extremely self conscious. Slowly, I backed away and shot into my room. Sherlock was seemingly fascinated by my body. I could do nothing to stop the blush creeping up my cheeks. I quickly dried myself, got dressed and...just stood there. Did I want to go downstairs? Would I be able to be normal around Sherlock? My hangover headache kicked in again and I had no choice but to descend the stairs again for tea and painkillers.
John. Moriarty won't touch him. I'll have to protect him without letting him know. This will be difficult but it's for John. This means I'll have to stop pushing him out and keep him close. No wonder he's confused, I keep going hot and cold on him.
And that's all I said? Oh thank God! I was expecting something terrible. I can live with that! Besides, it's true - JW
"Yeah, see Sherlock can tell your whole life story just by looking at you. People don't appreciate having their lives, secrets and all, laid out in front of them by a stranger."
I had a date with Irene Adler. It wasn't difficult. I knew she 'had a thing for me' as John would say. John. I don't know what's going on anymore. Are we to spend forever walking on eggshells, avoiding conversation? I hope not. I miss him. Stopping him from coming on cases was one of the worse ideas I've had. I keep hearing him making comments as I wondered around crime scenes. There was no-one to listen to my deductions and the skull was starting to attract attention.
I glanced in the mirror just before I left the flat, I noticed I looked awful. I felt awful too. Why should I though? I'm going on a date, John does it all the time. So why do I feel bad? I need to stop thinking that I have a chance with John. That was the a problem. I was hoping for a chance with him, which was causing me to doubt myself. No! I finally have an interesting case, I can't have any distractions. I needed to block out John so I could focus on winning Miss Adler's affection. This was going to be a long night.
I severely hated the idea of John being alone around London at this time. What if something happened to him and I wasn't there? Deep breath. John is ex-army, he can protect himself. Yes. He'll be okay. No need to worry.
John and Mrs Hudson sat for hours talking about complete nonsense such as the weather and the neighbours. I was unbelievably bored by the tedious conversation, so I went to seek solace in the silence of my room. Staring up at the ceiling, old voices starting whirring around my head. 'Caring is not an advantage' 'Freak!' 'Just go and kill yourself, Sherlock!' The sounds of my school days and Mycroft were taunting me. 'Just lock them away' I muttered to myself. They were shouting at me now. 'John? really brother dear?' 'The freak's in love, guys!' 'You know that John will never love you. Look at you! No-one will love you.' I sat bolt upright. Were they right?John is the only one willing to accept me. That implies he cares for me. He's straight though. He's just your friend and friend's care for each other. Stupid, stupid, stupid Sherlock! Had I actually mistaken John's caring attitude for something more? Obviously. Pathetic. Get a grip. I need to lock down these feelings and things will be the same as before.
Okay, okay. Calm down! What happens when I text him and he doesn't reply? Or what if he does reply? Do we just pretend none of this happened and carry on where we left it? I couldn't do that. - JW
I wanted to tell him how much this meant to me but I don;t think my words would express it. I placed the book on my chair as I got up. John was fascinated by the floor so I took my chance and wrapped my arms around him. The heat radiating from him comforted my immensely. I could feel every worry and thought leave me as John' arms curled around me. In that moment, I felt protected by John. My mask was crumbling down and so I buried my head in his shoulder. His arms instinctively tightened around me ad I almost lost it. I wanted to tell him everything right then, not caring what the consequences were, but I knew I couldn't. I was supposed to be the uncaring, sociopath who didn't have emotions. How did I let myself fall so far? There was no option. I would have to push John away. Make sure I am isolated. Alone protects me. It's all I have. 'You have John.' No. The voice in my head kept replaying it over and over. Forcing me to acknowledge the man who's arms were wrapped around me. Could I push John away? He's the only one who has stuck with me, despite my glaring flaws that have made many turn in another direction. The voice returned to torment me. 'Are you really going to push away the only friend you have? The only one who has stayed? The only one you've loved?' Shut up! Yes. I have to. I can't be attached to anyone or anything. It will be used against me. What would happen if John was danger because someone wants to get to me? I can't, won't let that happen. This needs to stop now.
I walked into the flat, wondering where John was. Panic started to pulse through me when I realised how long I'd been gone. Where was he? Something can't of happened already, could it? My fears were calmed when I heard John and Mrs Hudson's laughter from the flat below. Thank God. This meant that I could continue to work on a plan to keep John safe. I had been to see Lestrade and Mycroft hoping they could help. Mycroft already had surveillance on John which I asked him to increase. Most of our meeting was spent with him dropping snide comments about John and how 'caring isn't an advantage brother dear'. With a few choice words including 'Lestrade' and 'goldfish' Mycroft reluctantly agreed to increase John's surveillance. After spending spending time with my wonderful brother, I hailed a taxi to Scotland Yard. Marching through the door and up to Lestrade's floor, I was greeted with many choruses of 'Freak'. Ignoring their idiotic hatred towards me I entered the detective inspectors office and shut the door. "Sherlock! Don't you know how to knock? What are you doing here? There isn't a case for you." He rambled, placing his coffee down after nearly spilling it. "Listen. It's John, he's in danger." Lestrade's face fell as I briefly gave him the details. "Moriarty is on the move, I need you to inform me if anything crops up about him, no matter how small." He sat in stunned silence for a while before saying "Yeah, I will. But Sherlock, how are you going to stop him?" Now it was my turn to be silent. I still had no idea what it truly was Moriarty wanted. I'm confident that he wants more than just hurting John to hurt me, but what? I stood up to leave. "I don't know." I answered quietly before shutting the door and leaving. After replaying the day through my head several times, I was sure that John would be safe, if I had to leave him. Moriarty. He burned in my brain, the one puzzle I could never solve. He was more dangerous and fatal than I will admit to anybody. Thankfully before I could spend my night going through theories in my mind palace, John walked through the door. "Where have you been?" He didn't sound angry gratefully. "Lestrade and Mycroft. I had business with them both." Why was it so difficult to speak all of a sudden? "Ah fair enough. Are you planning to eat today? I'm starving." His head appeared from inside the fridge. "Why don't we go out? For dinner I mean." I could feel my face heating up so I turned away, praying that John hadn't noticed.
"John." Sherlock breathed. The way he stared at me, was innocent enough but there was a deep sadness in his eyes.
Sherlock was actually having a conversation with me. Should I bring up the whole Irene thing? Maybe if I casually mention it, he'll be okay about it especially if he's feeling talkative now.
I had barely reached the door of 221B when 3 gunshots were fired. I ran up the stairs, taking then two at a time. Various scenarios ran through my head as I reached the living room. Sherlock was stood on the coffee table shooting at the now bullet filled smiley face.
"Yes, I found out last week. Mycroft put me on a case involving a woman named Irene. Except she was working with Moriarty. He apparently wants me heart." I shouldn't be saying any of this but he I guess needs must. There was no point in trying to hide the truth anymore, especially if Lestrade had also received a message from Moriarty too.
He tsked but laid his facts before me regardless. “This gentleman is in his mid-thirties, I would hazard to guess, and is a journalist judging by his typist’s fingers and the bags under his eyes - they speak of late nights and deadlines. From his clothes we can tell he is not very well off but comfortable enough, with a cushion afforded by his small yet substantial inheritance. He has only his mother left to mourn him.”
- ah basil dawson, like the characters basil (of baker street) and dr. dawson from the great mouse detective. what a coincidence
Macnair shrugged, before pulling out of his other left pocket a revolver, and then calmly pointing it at Holmes. I stiffened sharply, scared to make a move, and Macnair took note of it with a sinister curl to his lip.
Today’s appointment appeared to be one such meeting. Holmes had loudly declared the matter to be a trifle upon reading that our visitor would be calling at half past ten that morning, and yet had prepared to receive them anyway, putting away the materials from his explosive chemical experiment that had taken up his attention the past few days, and positioning himself readily in his chair so as to be ready for the consulting.
He laughed and did a turn, his blue coat flared around him as he spun, “What do you think, Watson, will I fit in at your club?”
He demurred at the praise, pleased, and I felt that sprig of small annoyance. “Be that as it may, I have called you here, Mr. Abbott, to ask you no small favor.”
“Ah, well. That’s that ship sailed then. Still it bears asking, why exactly do you think your Mr. Holmes is so insistent upon my confessing to the murders? Why not take me off in irons now?”
Macnair chuckled. “I wanted to see if he could do it! And what his reaction would be to seeing his great magnificent detective backed into a corner when it mattered most, how you failed to protect him.
“Why, Watson,” he began, somewhat muffled by his head buried as it was by the pillows, “do people not merely trust their spouses?”
Holmes nodded, his eyes meeting mine. “Indeed. Instead of a ring, or whatever she might have hoped to find, she found in his desk some correspondence that can only be described as love letters. They are addressed to a lady, Alberta, and although they are penned in Miss Finnegan's lover's hand, they are signed by the name Victor.”
Miss Morstan had a lover herself, but her lot was lucky in the sense that it was a requited and mutual feeling. The only thing keeping them apart was society’s view and misunderstanding that two women could not also be in love. As she was merely an unmarried governess and her lover an actress with not substantial income herself, they lacked the means to truly be together unencumbered. She asked me this knowing we were dear friends, and as I saw no reason why I could not help her I acquiesced. I knew even then that my heart would always belong to Holmes, so I found no reason that this should hinder me in any way. The man himself, when I explained my intention to marry, never could fully understand it, but made peace enough with my choice that I felt able to leave Baker Street within the next few months. Our separation was painful but necessary I felt, so as to regain some of my mind back to me independent of him, even if I could not still resist coming when he called.
and other melodramatic ramblings - I deserve a medal, if anything, for my patience at your pathetic warbling!
“So I have heard! Busy is an understatement - I work at the paper, don’t forget. You are back to your old adventures once more, I take it?” grinned Macnair, with a glint in his eye.
I shook my head, but made an effort to think back. The only occasions that I could call to mind were small, and barely worth remark, but I recounted them anyways. Times when for instance Hopkins became perhaps too comfortable in expressing his adoration for Holmes, or when a client batted her eyes at him in a way that did not speak of the grieving her manner of dress conveyed. “Little acts that bred some small annoyance,” said I, for otherwise they did not do much to ruffle my feathers as I was assured of my place at his side.
“Ha!” Holmes merely laughed, not even looking from the papers in his lap and I groaned internally knowing that mediation was once again on my shoulders alone.
As I did so my friend finally turned to me, smiling broadly as if nothing was amiss. “Ah, Watson, here at last. Good morning.”
As such, I was feeling rather more kindly to him than he most likely deserved for his reaction, so after giving the address to the driver and we had both settled in our seats, I asked him. “Would you want to know the reason behind my late visit?”
- holmes also quotes twice from shakespeare's much ado about nothing, act 2 scene 3. one is obvious, and the other "Love me. Why?" was just for me. i like to think watson would also prefer the comedies
“More excitement?” I laughed, hardly believing it, but such was the life when one was compatriots with Sherlock Holmes, and I bounded up the stairs after him.
This stunned Abbott, and I gestured for him to take a seat, which he did even as his eyes never left Holmes. “Wow! I can see it now, but your demeanor and your accent was completely changed, then! You are very talented, indeed Mr. Ver- sorry, Mr. Holmes!”
His countenance was inscrutable, and yet his eyes were a deep grey ocean, so that I wished I could tilt his face with my hand, as to properly see into those depths. It was as I was lifting my hand to do so that it all began to turn into water, and then to fade, and all at once I was awake, and blinking up at my ceiling and breathing as if I had just been running.
"How hard can it be, really, to be honest with one’s partner during disagreements! You and I have succeeded all these odd years.”
“I would not rush to make any judgements of the sort just yet. I have the feeling there is still much to be learned from the little gift our murderer has given us.”
In the end, what Holmes told Lestrade was an almost complete fabrication. It managed to cover our tracks up well enough, even if the inspector gave me a look when he thought it escaped Holmes’ notice, as if asking me to confirm that the explanation was indeed fact.
Holmes’ left eyebrow quirked, and he glanced at me with some amusement before focusing once more. “We are investigating a murder presently, that has recently had a more personal turn of events. In fact, I fear that although it was done quite unconsciously, I have brought you to our suspect’s attention last night.”
Even though I knew he just needed someone I couldn't help my heart rate increasing as I breathed in scent. There was no way to describe it. It was just Sherlock. It was comforting to me. I knew that my feelings were growing out of control this whole time and I wanted nothing more than to show him I'm the only one he'll ever need. Pulling him into a kiss would prove that, but right now he needed a friend. My chest constricted painfully at the thought of us being nothing more than friends. But if that's what he needs; that's what I'll be.
I watched as John rushed upstairs to get this 'surprise'. I was confused. What had he got me? Excitement and curiosity were bubbling up inside me threatening to overflow. John returned quickly and handed me a gift. He said he had got me it to cheer me up. Oh John. Where would I be without you? I didn't need any gift to cheer me up, John's presence does that anyway. I tore off the wrapping paper and was blown away. He had got me a book all about murders and serial killers. I couldn't help but stare at the leather bound book. John was talking but it was coming from a distance. He had obviously put a lot of thought into this. Why did he feel the need to cheer me up? It didn't make any sense. John has never bothered before when I went into a mood and ignored him. had something changed? From the book I was holding it was definitely a good change.
"He was fine. He looked a bit tired though, poor thing. Didn't really listen to what I was saying. Ooh, do you think he's finally found someone? The signs are there he-"
"Mrs. Hudson, I need your help." I don't know why I was looking at the floor. I just couldn't meet her eyes.
"Don't worry, you're not in trouble. We're friends. You and Sherlock help me on cases, but I suppose I should let him explain that. The other guy who walked out after Sherlock is Mycroft. He's part of the government and Sherlock's older brother." He gave me a small smile. Government and police? What did I get myself into? And since when did I help on crime scenes?
Ah, of course. Sensitive nature? So it involved one of his beloved royal family. How dull. I listened to the information. Ordinary people are so boring. Someone has taken suggestive pictures and is now using them as blackmail. No, not blackmail. It's a power play, with the most powerful family in Britain. Clever. Might actually be worth my time. Why would anyone call themselves 'The Woman'? Hmm, the case sounds simple enough. Just get the phone with the photos on. Mycroft could do this if he ever got off his arse and did some 'legwork'. He definitely needs it, judging on how many cakes he's devoured this week.
Exactly! Obviously we'll tell him afterwards. Want to meet for lunch and we'll get Sherlock in on it too? - JW
Fair enough. Oh, you should know that I might not be able to reply as much on a night. I got a job! - JW
We stared at each other, silently understanding the gravity of the situation. There was cough from the room, I had almost forgotten where we were. So had Lestrade going off his wide eyes.
Me and Sophie really hit it off and we exchanged numbers. As I left the shop, I was having an internal debate. I knew Sherlock would be impressed with my present and hopefully it would make him happier. The fact that I was more concerned with Sherlock's happiness than getting a girls number, was deeply unsettling. Sophie was definitely interested in me but I really didn't care. Damn it! It hit me as I stared up at the brass numbers on our door that I had fallen for Sherlock. I didn't know what to do. Surely if I knew, then the world's only consulting detective certainly knew. Would it be awkward between us? What if he wanted me to leave? I sat down on the steps outside the door, trying to compose myself. I didn't want to leave Baker Street. I knew that I belonged here, with Sherlock. Would I be able to push these feelings down? Yes. I had to. I needed to keep them locked up so that I could remain with my best friend and carry on solving crimes and following him across London. If Sherlock could wear a mask, why couldn't I do the same? God knows my life would be nothing without him. Something wet was dripping down my neck, I jumped up realising it was pouring down with rain. I must have zoned out for a long time as the street lights were flickering on, dousing the paths in a deep orange liquid.
Well, you know how his family are trying to set him up with someone? I think he might actually like them! - JW
I think I'm gunna do that. I don't understand how Greg can stand him. He seems so full of himself - JW
I don't know how long I had sat there, trying to get my feelings under control but after a while I realised I couldn't feel my legs. I got up shakily and wondered into the Kitchen. What should I do? Do I tell him? No. John was straight. I went to my room, closing the door behind me. I knew if I had stared at John, I would have given in to my emotions and kissed him, and if he'd of woken up...I knew it was for the best just to lock down these feelings and continue as normal.
"And that's how I ended up here." I finished. Greg had sat silently throughtout, allowing me to spill everything to him. We sat quietly as I watched him trying to process all the information.
"You're never going to be the same again anyway, Sherlock. Things have changed for you and John. I'd suggest you him, the answer might surprise you."
Did I say something I wasn't suppose to? Sherlock, I think  that was hios name, and one of the other guys left. The one that remained just shook his head at the door and turned hi attention back to me.
I left the room. I couldn't take it. John's forgotten our lives together and it's entirely my fault. Not twelve hours ago, he said he loves me. Now he he has no idea who I am. What am I supposed to do? I need him but I don;t think he needs me anymore. What if he never gets his memory back? What if he does? Either way, I'm nothing to him now.
He grabbed a bottle of whiskey and two glasses. Hours passed and the sun was rising over the buildings flooding the room with weak sunlight. Me and Greg had spent the time coming up with ideas on how to tell Sherlock how I felt about him. The ideas become more and more ridiculous the more we drunk.
"I told you before Sherlock, caring is not an advantage. Look at the mess you're in. If you'd never let your heart rule your head, none of this would of happened." I glared at him. How dare he? He didn't know anything! I opened my mouth to protest but Lestrade beat me to it.
He wasn't that bad. Sherlock's alright once you get past the whole 'I know everything about anyone and anything' After that he nice :) - JW
The kettle boiled and I made my tea. I took it to my chair and wondered what Sherlock had been doing all day. 'From the looks of it, trying to blow up the apartment' I chuckled to myself.
I walked up the stairs, a trail of water behind me. The living room was lit by one lamp in the corner. It gave the room an eerie glow and cast elongated shadows on the walls. Sherlock was sat in his chair, knees tucked under his chin. He looked like a lost child. I forgot about how cold I was and that I was soaked because I needed to help Sherlock. He looked so...helpless. Something in my chest tightened. I hated seeing him like this. He hadn't moved when I entered the flat but I didn't want to alarm him so I moved slowly towards him. I sat in my chair across from him, his eyes were cast downwards. The note I had written earlier was crumpled on the floor. What had happened while I was out?
"I can't say for sure but I have never seen him look at anyone else, the way he looks at you. It's as if you're the only thing he can see."
What?! God, I feel kinda happy about my family now! They may moan and bitch but they never try and force me into marriage - JW
Nah, I think Sherlock saving me from two creeps who are threatening me is gunna work just fine! - JW
I woke up in complete darkness, curled up in my chair. There was a blanket covering me. I don't remember getting a cover, unless Sherlock put it here? No, the idea of him doing something normal is laughable. I must have reached for it through the night. I stretched and stood up. Sleeping on a chair isn't the most comfortable place. I finally noticed that Sherlock was no where in the room, his bedroom door was shut. I hoped that he was getting some sleep, he desperately needed it. I crept upstairs and crawled under my own covers of my own bed.
Picking up my violin, I decided to distract myself by getting lost in the music. I started playing, pouring my emotions into the melody. I feared that if anyone heard it, then they would know who it's for. I stopped playing at that thought. The one person who I would let listen to it, was out with a woman who could make him happy in a way I couldn't. John would never be happy with me. He's usually angry with me because I've done something or stepped over some imaginary line. That isn't happiness. Why does he put up with me? We're friends. My only friend and I'll probably push him away because I'll undoubtedly do something to tip him over the edge. I was stood motionless staring at the carpet. The darkness had crept in to the flat, noticed by me. I switched on a lamp and my attention was caught by the note John had left. A surge of unwanted feelings bubbled up inside me. I crumpled it up and curled up in my chair.
"I got your texts you know. I really wanted to reply but I didn't want to risk it. Hope you didn't think I was ignoring you because I wouldn't do that."
I didn't know what to make of it. I know I hadn't done anything to annoy him today. Looking at the note, I let my eyes roam over the space where his doctors scrawl had marked the page. It was rushed, so he was obviously in a hurry. He would have normally made his notes legible and the doctors scribble was an old habit that didn't use unless he was jotting notes down at a crime scene. 'So John must have wanted to leave the flat quickly' I thought to myself. I shouted for Mrs. Hudson and she came into the flat looking flustered.
The words seemed innocent enough so why had Sherlock looked away? Did he mean something by 'we should go out?'. After a few moments, I grabbed my coat and said yes. Sherlock beamed at me then jumped up and started wrapping his scarf around his neck. I had no idea where we were going but I didn't care. I was happy just to spend some time with Sherlock, just me and him outside of the flat. After the whole Irene thing, I've felt me and Sherlock have kind of drifted slightly. He seems distant like he does when he's on a case but I know for a fact that he's not working on one. Not from Lestrade anyway. Unless Mycroft gave him one? Is that the business they had together? Sherlock would never go willing and visit his brother, unless Sherlock was in danger or needed government help. Oh please tell me Sherlock isn't meddling in things above himself again. Wrapped up in my thoughts once again, I hadn't paid attention where we were walking. I was quite surprised when we stopped in front of Angelo's. We haven't been here since the day I moved in. The memory came flooding back. I'm sure that's when my feelings for Sherlock started and it's all because of this place. I wonder if Sherlock regards the restaurant the same way I do? I doubt it. A high functioning sociopath with sentiment? It's unheard of. I'm certain he's chosen this place just for the food, not for the memories. Sherlock left me at the door as he went to go fond Angelo, I watched him as he whispered to Angelo who looked extremely happy and kept glancing in my direction. I just smiled awkwardly back at him and kept my head down. They both returned and Angelo showed us a table which was the same one we had the first time. Sherlock sat himself down and smiled sheepishly at me. Does this mean something? Are we on a date? I would love for that to be true but it's impossible. Though the smiles Angelo was giving me, the hushed whispers between the two of them, this table...it can't all be a coincidence. Does Sherlock like me? "Sherlock, what's all this about?" I maintained eye contact with him which was difficult. "Well John. I was going to bring this up later but since you mentioned it, there is something I want to discuss with you. I want to tell you that I-" Sherlock's words were drowned out by Molly Hooper shouting us both and coming over. Sherlock just shut up and stared at the table. Oh God. Was this it? What was he gunna say? I hope he tells me later, I know Sherlock has the tendency to clam up after he's worked up the courage to do something and it doesn't go to plan. Damn you Molly!
If we were expecting anything elaborate however, we were disappointed, Holmes most of all. It seems that all it had taken Macnair to become a serial murderer was the patronage of a florist and a chemist, and the luck that the target of his malevolence had one of the most average and common faces in all of London.
“Abbott, you know Watson, do you not? He’s an old friend of mine. I was just telling him about you actually, Mr. Vernet. You’ve been missed here.” Macnair put a familiar hand on my shoulder. Holmes’ keen eyes immediately set on it.
“Yes, sir.” The boy nodded, his grin gone and replaced with a very determined expression that threatened to make me laugh.
