They had met in the home of Miss Missouri, a charismatic middle-aged woman who lived two blocks away from the street that both boys lived on. Dean had lived on that street, and in Lawrence, his entire two years of life. Castiel on the other hand, only moved in the week prior to the day they met. He’d moved from an even smaller city called Pontiac, which resided in the state of Illinois. His parents had uprooted their lives from there, away from the only family they’d ever known. And being in a whole new city without family, meant that they needed to find care for their toddler son. Miss Missouri’s home daycare was recommended by some neighbouring locals and one desperate phone call later, Castiel was booked to attend.
“But I can promise you this,” she says, “I will help you, in whatever I can, to help you find that missing part of you, okay?”
Again, it only took a few moments for someone to answer the door. This time, instead of Michael Shurley—a middle aged woman with short blonde hair answered. She hadn’t looked like what Claire had pictured… but Claire herself wasn’t even sure what she had picture. Mary Winchester was an average height and had a slim build. She had pale skin and wrinkles by her eyes, showing the many years of wear that had been built from her constant smiles.
to remember, his past self and his past life remain hidden under a layer of darkness and obscurities.
After Dean put the pie away, Cas decided that it was best for him to go. Dean walked him to the door, standing on the threshold as he said his goodbyes.
Dean watched his mom continue to bake until she had constructed the pie and put it in the oven. After his mom washed her hands, Dean went up to her and tapped her on the hip, wanting her attention.
“Firstly, you must know that everything will happen as the prophecy says it will. Nothing you can do, or anyone else can do, will change it. I just need you to remember that. Will you remember that for me?”
Castiel had attempted to break free from Dean’s surveillance a multitude of times -- but Dean had stealth. There were several times that he thought he was free, only to find Dean a couple of feet behind him, silently following him. The knight had attempted to leave some distance between them, trying not to intrude on Castiel’s space. Yet knowing that he was there, eyes always on the back of his head, was enough to feel intrusive to Castiel.
“Hey!” A voice breaks Dean out of his dream and he startles awake, glaring at the intruder who dares to disturb his sleep. He realises it’s a man about his own age, staring at him with concerned eyes. He’s got to be a couple of inches shorter than Dean and at least ten pounds lighter. He’s like a twig, small and frail. Dean knows that if the man were to try anything, he could easily beat him.
“There’s nothing wrong with you Cas,” Dean said, reaching forward to put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder, “some things just take time. You know as well as I do, even
He moved just before the new school year, to a small housing unit quite close to the university. It was a small little home, but fairly spacious for just one resident. Cas loved it from the moment he walked in and was quick to try and make it his own. He didn’t bring everything from Chicago and still had numerous household items that he needed to acquire, so he felt that a trip to the local Walmart was necessary for his first day.
Dean was five minutes from the house when he heard the sound of feet pattering on the sidewalk behind him. He turned around to see who it was… and immediately turned right back around. He attempted to walk faster but the person was running and soon they had overtaken him, stopping him in his tracks.
Dean’s eyes widened and Cas tilted his head in confusion. Though before the other boy could question it, Dean grabbed his hand and hoisted him up. The two of them ran back into the house, ready to await their fate.
. He was in a good mood, especially when he saw a fiery red-head waving at him from across the room.
By the time their long conversation dwindled down, Cas spotted that there was only ten minutes until the new year. He hadn’t even noticed how quickly the night had flown by. While Sam went over to Jess, Cas turned the TV onto a live broadcast preparing for the countdown. His eyes scanned the room to try and find Dean, only to see that he was nowhere in the room. He frowned, walking towards the hall where the bathroom was. When he observed that no one was in there, he walked further into the hall, down to the end where the bedroom was. He opened the door and peeked his head inside, noting in the pitch black darkness of the room, there was a figure lying on the bed.
“With emails and all this technology lately, I feel we’ve lost touch with personal notes,” she tells him. Dean smiles softly, thinking that is exactly something Cas would say.
Dean was surprised that they hadn’t watched the entirety of Netflix by now, considering how much Cas was in love with the streaming site. As the home screen loaded, the
“The Queen’s death will forever haunt me, along with the champions. It was a tragic day for Grace Island, one that still haunts us all this time later.” Missouri states. “I suppose I shall pick up where she left off. First, my name is Missouri, as you know, and I am a prophet. I come from a long line of prophets. While our whole family has the gift, we also have the important role of protecting the prophecy, written by one of our ancestors. The prophecy warned of The Empty’s return and the signs of when he was near. When I became of age to protect the prophecy, it did not take me long to realise that The Empty’s return was nearing. Hence, why I spoke to the Queen and forewarned her of such events. At the time, she was pregnant with the prince.”
He decided to try and meet the neighbours on his way out, especially whoever lived next door to him. Considering he lived in a housing unit, it meant that his next-door neighbour and him shared a wall. Having lived in an apartment for twenty-seven years, sharing a wall wasn’t really a problem. He figured that was about as close as you could get to a neighbour and he really wanted to make a good first impression.
She left the bakery in a rush after Dean ended his story, leaving the distraught man alone in his usual seat. Claire wanted nothing more to stay and comfort him, knowing the guilt of what he had done all those years ago was still tearing him up inside, but she had a bigger priority awaiting.
For the second time that night, Dean felt way too overly emotional. He swallowed hard and leant over, pulling Cas in a hug. Although Dean knew his friend couldn’t hear, he leant over into his ear and whispered…
“I’m sorry but my wife will probably have to play translator. I was hopeless at learning sign language. I could only say
Dean remembers the night thirty years ago in Cas’ backyard. He remembers Cas telling the story with such enthusiasm that Dean at the time had thought it was endearing. He always became animated when he told stories as a kid, as if he were putting on a performance.
to watch the next episode. Yet, his quietly seething nature was in no mood to sit next to Cas for any longer that night.
“Uh.. hey Cas.” He muttered, trying his best to project his voice as quietly as possible. “Look.. I uh… I know you are probably in spirit land at the moment. I know you are fucking pissed at me but… but man please let me know that you are okay. Something's going on at the moment and I’m… I’m worried and need to know if you’re fine.”
“I have been sent to collect you and bring you back into the village. The prophet, Missouri, has requested to see you.”
“Why aren’t you with your friends?” Sam asked Dean after many minutes of sitting in silence. Dean shrugged.
“You don’t mind if I sit here, do you? I find that the chairs are far worse for my back than the floor and this spot you got here is nice and cosy.”
“I’m heading to bed.” Dean snapped, shutting off the TV. Cas turned to look at him in a state of bewilderment.
“I named her,” she says, “I’ve known her since she was a foul, born from her mother’s womb. Somedays, she is the closest thing I have to a friend.”
And just like that, it was as if a flame were lit in Castiel’s head. Suddenly, he knew what he needed to do. Not only to save Dean, but to save the entire kingdom.
The sound of someone shouting caused both Dean and Cas to turn around in a flash. The both of them instantly spotted Kevin, who was leaning against one of the benches in the science lab. He looked the same as he always did--pale and thin with his dark black hair peeking out from under a blue beanie. His smile was the same as always though, just like it had been when he was alive.
He gets up close to it and hacks it hands off with his sword. Then he aims for the legs. Once the Nephilim is just a husk of a body, he brings his sword down and slices off the head, killing it cold.
“Neither have I, I don’t really have many close friends here. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed an event such as this one.”
As he got into the driver’s seat, he couldn’t help but send Dean one last look before he put the car into reverse. He would never forget Dean’s heartbroken gaze as he drove away, towards a new life and away from the life he once knew.
He turned back to Cas, who was looking at him with apprehension. His eyes were pained, almost as if he knew what Dean was going to say next.
First job Dean had to help with was picking the venue. After much deliberation and much agitation, they picked a nice café that Dean had been to once or twice.
He’d grown up in a Deaf family, learnt how to sign his name before he could even say it, witnessed the exclusion and discrimination his family fought everyday. He was an assistant professor of American Sign Language, he worked everyday alongside a Deaf professor to teach an entire course on ASL and Deaf culture. His entire world revolved advocating for those who were deaf and promoting ASL in every way that he could. Yet, he didn’t even realise that his next-door neighbour was deaf and instead, shunned him.
That day he learnt his new neighbour and classmate was named Castiel. That he was six years old. He liked bees and drawing. He was allergic to peanuts. He was also Deaf and mainly communicated through sign language. However, Dean also learnt Castiel didn’t need to just talk through sign language and somehow, that day, the two of them had worked out their own way to communicate to each other.
He never got the opportunity to chase friends in his backyard or play marbles and blocks together in the toy room. Most of his childhood joy came from reading, or playing alone. And the more Castiel thinks about it, the more saddened he is by the thoughts. He knew that Dean had plenty of friends as a child, both here in Vale, but also in the kingdom’s village. Castiel wished he would’ve been allowed to play with them. Maybe if they had become friends as children, their friendship would only be more solidified.
“You must know, that I am very protective of Castiel.” He said. “If I hear from him that you have harassed him in anyway…”
He’s never been the studious type, he’s always found that he is particularly too restless to sit down and read for long periods of time. He’s a hands-on learner, always has been. It’s how he learnt his way around cars and what made them work. It’s how he learnt to bake, just from experimenting in the kitchen. He never learnt by listening to lectures or reading
The pool of fate was warm, despite its location. The water was crystal clear, almost as if he were stepping into transparent liquid. The amulet around his neck grew hot, sensing the powerful magic that laid within the water. He walked until he was in the centre of the pool, staring up at the large statue of the angel Michael. He took a deep breath, taking hold of the amulet as he began reciting his chants.
“I know that, Castiel. Hence why we have had a whole team working on them. Or why I sent hundreds of our people to excavate them from the mountains.”
Dean jumps as the prince’s voice echoes through his mind. He looks down and realises that his hand is clutching onto the amulet, an action he subconsciously made. He wants to pull away, but feels that would be disrespectful.
He turned back to Cas, who was staring at Dean with a soft expression. It was then that Dean pulled him back in again. He didn't want the moment to end, despite the fact that the fireworks had reached their finale. They pulled away again as the fireworks dissipated, the people around them roaring in applause. Dean and Cas just stared at each other, giggling as they began clapping with the rest of the crowd.
The following Sunday afternoon, Dean watched from the front porch of the Shurley’s as the sedan pulled into the driveway. He stood up hesitantly, his heart thumping in his chest as the car came to a stop. He saw Michael narrow his eyes at him through the windscreen before turning and facing someone in the backseat. It only took a few seconds for the back door to open and immediately, Dean’s gaze fell upon blue eyes.
“No.” Charlie replies, “I’m fine with not knowing the specifics. Their idea was ridiculous and it led to their death and it led to them abandoning me. Overall, I am much happier now with Missouri as my mother. She’s never abandoned me or ever made me feel alone.”
The gas station was owned by a chain, the same one that owned one of the gas stations in Lawrence. During his college years, Castiel worked there to earn some extra money, as well as to work on his social skills. He worked occasional shifts during the week, along with Saturdays and Sundays. Dean would always be back in Lawrence for the weekend, and would end up spending his Saturdays at the gas station with Cas.
Sam decided the only time he was free to facetime his older brother was on a Wednesday afternoon in October.
The two brothers hadn’t spoken in a while, both being too busy to sit down for a video chat. Dean was running the bakery and hadn’t travelled home in years, whereas Sam was busy with his attorney job over in San Francisco. Most of his free time was also occupied through planning his wedding to his fiancé Eileen.
Kevin sighed and shook his head. “No… well at least not that I know. I’ve been trying to contact a few here on the Earth plane but have had no luck. And I can’t risk  popping into the veil with the fear of not being able to get out.”
Instead of seeming horrified or scared, the girl just looks more excited. However, she must realise how she appears, because instantly her expression calms.
Black goo pours all over Dean’s face and he quickly wipes it off to stop it from burning. The monster completely liquidfiles, before disappearing.
As they got to top, Dean clenched his eyes shut as his heart began to accelerate in his chest. However before the cart moved any further, Dean felt a pressure on his hand. He opened his eyes and could see in the darkness of the ride that Cas was holding his hand for support. Dean blushed but wasn’t able to really think about the embarrassment that he felt as the ride picked up the pace again. And before they knew it, they were off.
That night he sat at his desk, studying. Cas laying on the bed behind him. He had an exam the next day for a subject he was struggling the most in. He was struggling to remember everything, the equations and theorems meshing together and the pages becoming blurry. He wanted to do nothing more but throw his book out the window. He was considering just not going and flunking it. He didn’t see how he would pass.
Castiel’s face flushed slightly, abashed from the compliment, “Oh… that is… very kind of Sir John to say.”
this morning, or you will definitely be missing out on the party. Which means missing out on the bouncy castle
He kept sweeping but he heard her make no move to leave. He could feel his frustration and anger bubbling to the top and with a big huff he turned around, ready to give the teenager a bitter mouthful.
Dean waited patiently as Cas took a few breaths before taking a large breath, swallowing hard. He then locked his gaze on Dean, that piercing scrutinizing stare that Dean had missed, and began to sign.
He saw the fortress on his way in, however he could barely see it due to how high up the mountain it is. Attempting to get up there will take a lot of work and someone who knows the mountain well. There is no way they will be able to go about it alone.
The woman sighs and shakes her head. “Last few seats on the midnight flight have already been taken. I’m sorry sir, you are just going to have to wait.”
They eat a small breakfast of porridge while Missouri packs their bags until they're full of food. Dean didn’t realise he needed
“We are actually able to control them now, the next step is being able to manipulate it at a mass level.” Castiel said, turning to look at Dean with excitement in his eyes. Dean smiled softly back, showing that he was attentively listening to whatever Castiel had to say.
He feels a pressure on his shoulder and turns to see Cas has returned his hand there. It’s warm and comforting, a telltale sign that Cas understands and that he’s listening.
“I’m going to kill them.” Dean growled, not bothering to sign for Cas—too angry to even attempt. “Whoever did this I’m going to kill them. They think what they did to you was bad? Oh... just wait until I’m done with them. I’m going to grab a knife, a
“Yes, just a small gathering here. Nothing too fancy, considering she’s not going to remember it. Jimmy insisted upon it, he’s always been one for celebrations. It’s only going to be his family, our older brother Gabriel, and Hannah and Chuck. Pretty much a simple lunch with a birthday cake and presents.”
“You have to go, Dean.” He said. “But I just want to thank you for everything. You are a good fighter and I am looking forward to watching you tear that son of a bitch apart.”
He remembers his most recent memory, before he was sent to the bath. He remembers the excruciating pain as each hit he took from a Nephilim got worse and worse, to the point where could barely see anything in front of him. He remembers a large flash of light, Castiel’s screams and his body hitting the floor. As he laid there, he’d watched Cas through a hazy gaze, his eyelids swollen from the battle. Cas was mournful, teary-eyed, uttering apologies and words of regret into Dean’s hair. However, Dean had found that he was at peace, as that there was no better place for him to be than in Cas’ arms. That there was no better place for him to die, than in Cas’ arms.
“So what? Yes, not all people from the LGBT community you will come across will be so openly gay. Or, at least they won’t be so expressive. But there will be some that do come across, as you put it, flamboyant. They are allowed and proud to be. The community spent so many years being discriminated and repressed. While it isn’t all gone now, society as a whole has become more accepting.”
Charlie scoffs and throws her hands up. “Dean, I don’t know why you’re so worried! You and Cas don’t fight, you
Which is why his mind cannot help but wander as he thinks about the future. He feels the need to see more than Grace Island, to travel across the sea to new endeavours. He has spent the last a hundred years trapped because the fate of the island was left in his hands and in the hands of his fickle magic. If anything were to occur again, he does not think they will survive it. Maybe it is time to see what else their world has to offer.
He had known Dean long before he had become his knight. Dean’s father, John, had been Castiel’s own father’s loyal knight. Dean had grown up in the kingdom’s village and Castiel had watched him from afar. Dean had always been a bright and friendly boy, along with a skilled fighter with boastful confidence. Castiel had always been jealous of Dean’s ability to make friends easily and combat without even blinking an eye. At the time, he had not hated Dean, but rather he wished he could have been like him in every way possible.
As they walked inside, Castiel immediately noticed the prophet in front of them, sitting in a plush armchair. However, he paid her no mind at first, instead his attention being drawn to his surroundings. Missouri’s room was cozy, with warm colours and comforting decor. In the middle of the room, a sofa accompanied the armchair on a dark red rug. Surrounding the room, lining the walls, were mountains and mountains of books, all different colours and sizes. By the window, a litany of flowers grew on the sill, basking their heads towards the sun. Two large candelabras stood on the left and right of the room, away from the flammable crevices and objects.
They leave Missouri shortly after to have lunch, a roasted vegetable soup. When their bowls are empty, they journey through the town as Charlie leads him to his old childhood home.
Missouri nodded, “I see. I can sense some magic in it. Nothing like what I was able to sense from your father, but similar. Less… potent. Which makes sense if it is used as a binding tool.”
Dean turned around slowly to find his mother storming towards him, Sammy tucked up on her hip. Her face was furious and Dean couldn’t help but stare sheepishly at his mom.
Cas didn’t answer and instead turned his face away from Dean. Dean stopped him, gently grabbing Cas’ face in both of his hands so he could take another good look at him. He then stepped away from Cas and put his hands on top of his head, pulling at his hair in harsh, angry tugs.
However, before he could begin to yell at his brother, he was saved by the door to the kitchen opening. Kevin, his employee, walked in.
The man in front of her was broad shouldered, with his arms and chest covered by a knitted sweater. He had brown hair which darted off his head in all different directions, as if he had just gotten out of bed. His soft eyes squinted as they stared at her, causing the corners to crinkle. His face appeared expressionless as he stared at Claire with a perplexing look.
But nothing occurred, nothing but deafening silence and Castiel’s last chance breaking right in front of him.
“Professor Winchester?” The man asked. Dean turned around, pretending he was on a phone call to see an old student of his standing there. He’d been in his first year class years ago and now worked as a TA in the science department.
He waves his finger slightly as if he is forming the constellation. However, the night sky is littered with stars. Dean rarely is able to spot any of the constellations his husband attempts to show him.
During both his middle and high school years, Cas had always been excited to see Dean. For seven years, he’d never felt the slightest bit anxious upon seeing his best friend. That was until college, when his thoughts and feelings for Dean practically changed within a heartbeat.
They were hoping to get there before lunchtime, in order to eat and rest. They would leave their horses at the stables and journey to the region’s village further along the path. It was there that they would be meeting Hester, the faery champion and the one who had been training to use the Aether fortress. In all honesty, Castiel had never liked Hester nor her arrogance and disrespect. However, she was the most skilled fighter of the entire fae community and thus made her most qualified for the position.
He then turned back to the two members of the guard, who hovered next to him, waiting for permission.
Dean did not reply and Castiel did not mind. Instead, he finally let the sleep take him, an endless thought circulating through his mind.
“Just tired. Want an early night.” Dean stated, walking out of the room and up the stairs to his bedroom. He shut the door behind him swiftly, sighing and pinching the bridge of his nose. He walked over to his bed and flopped onto his back, not bothering to change out of his casual attire.
“I have never seen that look before. My eyes, they shined bright. My cheeks, they were flushed red. And I seemed to smile, even when I wasn’t smiling. I looked happy. I realised later, that I was in love, with John.”
“Don’t worry Your Highness, I know you haven’t visited for me,” she said, giving a pointed look over in Dean’s direction, “but nevertheless, I am happy that you’re here.”
“Looks like you’ve got it handled,” Cas states. “Do you mind if I quickly do these couple of dishes while she finishes eating?”
They quietly board the train together, Dean helping Charlie with her suitcase. The train to Kansas is packed, unlike the last one, so the two of them are only just able to grab two seats next to each other. Charlie sits on the aisle, pulling out a Harry Potter book and beginning to read while simultaneously texting Gilda (Dean assumes). Dean on the other hand, looks out the window at the late afternoon sky, and finds himself beginning to day dream. He thinks about Ellen and Jo, the both of them back home in Sioux Falls, and how badly he wants to visit them. Or about Sam, now miles and miles away back in California, probably still working hard on his Friday afternoon. He hasn’t seen Sam for two months and he misses him, despite their very recent conversation. Through all that, he finds his mind drawn back to Cas, memories of those two weeks they spent together. From Dean introducing Cas to the wonders of daytime television, or the day that he and Cas attended the Eudora New Year event and Dean felt drawn to Cas’ side the entire evening, never wanting to leave it.
Claire asked, taking the time to fingerspell the words. She went out on a limb, hoping that Mary knew some sort of sign language. To her benefit, the woman smiled knowingly.
“You spent the last almost-eight hours telling me your life story. Can’t blame a girl for being curious about the aftermath.”
Castiel stayed silent, hoping for Meg to just change the subject. She did. However, unfortunately, it was just as terrible.
“I do hope your memories return to you, Dean. It’s such a shame to lose the loving memories you have of our Dear Anna.” She says. “I do hope you remember your relationship.”
Only after he has scoured the place does he give himself a moment to process. He rests his back against one of the walls,
“I know I’m proposing and all, but I don’t have a ring. I would rather it be something we do together.”
“And you’re much frailer than I was expecting.” Dean replies. “Guess we can’t get always get what we want, can we?”
Days like today, he was constantly reminded of Dean’s position in his life. Dean was required to be by him consistently and protect him from harm’s way. While that position was once a burden to Castiel, he now would be forever grateful for it, as it brought Dean into his life. Yet, Dean’s role reminded him that Dean was not here because he wanted to be, or because he really,
“Not enough resources mainly. Lots of people are getting sick due to the diseases that the monsters spread and we don’t have enough healers from the Grasslands town to help everybody. We’re quite lucky here in Vale. It’s our little safe haven. Not everywhere on Grace Island is so lucky.”
He walked into the kitchen that morning to see his mom pressing dough into a pie dish. He wandered up to his mom, who smiled when she saw her son had entered the room.
. Just like all the other strange people were, the ones he met out on the street. From the woman with the sunken eyes or the man with the black top hat. Dean was convinced these people existed but wasn’t sure why
He chuckles, before relaxing his face into a more serious expression. He leans forward so that he is closer to Charlie.
“Congrats kiddo. I’m proud of you.” He said. “I guess this means you aren’t going to be hanging out with me on Wednesdays anymore, hey?”
Once they finish the bed, Dean glances a look over at the clock to see that it’s half past eight. Yet with how much he has travelled in the past few months, it could be 1am and he’d feel the exact same. He’s exhausted.
and it infuriated Cas to his core. Dean was able to communicate with others, even without the use of sign language. Most people just weren’t willing to try.
“I’m the college professor stereotype. I spend most of my days buried in books, at my house, with my cat by my side. I didn’t always have a cat, when I first started as a professor it was just copious amounts of literature I owned. However, I felt that if I were living up to one part of the stereotype, I might as well just go the full way.”
“Which I’m guessing is the age of your little boy?” Dean’s mom chimed, her gaze set on something behind Michael.
Cas points out Gabriel after some time, the man mingling from person to person with a big goofy smile on his face. Cas says he’s a big flirt, but also one hell of a trickster, and has played enough pranks on both Michael and Cas to last a lifetime. Dean points out Sam, who has spent the first hour of the reception talking with Michael’s colleagues and dancing with Jess on the dancefloor. He points out Jess to Cas as well, the girl that stole Sam’s heart.
Dean knows he is lying and is just using that as an excuse to walk him home. However, Charlie seems to believe him, nodding her head. It isn’t so hard to believe, considering Cas is an insurance broker for shops and small businesses. They’re along one of the main strips of their city, filled with an abundance of different shops, restaurants and cafes. Dean knows for a fact that Cas
Suddenly, it’s almost as if the air in the room drops a few degrees as a thick veil of tension silhouettes the room. Jimmy turns his attention back on Dean, his eyes dark.
He can’t quite pinpoint where he knows it from, why that blue is so inviting and warm. Yet all he knows is that it’s pulling at him,
Dean sighs, their words spinning around in his head. He knows they’re both right, there’s no doubt that he needed to hear those words. But of course, he’s never going to admit that to them.
“My office hours are closed, please come back tomorrow.” Cas’ deep, rumbling voice says. Dean has no idea if it’s because his memories were influenced by the alcohol, but the voice sounds different than usual. It sounds broken,
“I thought… well rather hoped at the time that one day… one day our story would be written in the stars. It was this split second idea that disappeared as quick as it came. But… it was then that I realised that you were my one. It scared me at first… obviously I was
“It’s a chocolate pie.” She said, Dean signing along. “Although it’s not as homely as an apple pie… it’s still a pie. Just a small dessert to remind you to not forget who you are. Either of you.”
He ends up already being awake when he hears the sound of soft whimpers from the next room. Grace’s room is only across the hall from the living area, and with the house being completely silent, he can hear almost everything. From the sound of the tree branch scraping against the kitchen window, to the ticking of the analogue clock across the room. He assumes Cas is still sleeping and won’t wake up until Grace’s soft cries turn to wails. Dean figures that since he’s up, he should let Cas sleep a little longer.
What he didn’t admit to anyone though, was that he had begun to religiously bake around the time that Cas got a girlfriend.
He knows that voice. Well, he feels like he does. The voice makes his stomach churn, an overwhelming wave of feelings crashing over him. He can’t piece together why he knows that voice or where he knows it from. He can’t explain why it is making him feel so confused. All he knows is that a part of him has recognised it. A part of him can explain who that voice belongs to.
Dean forced a smile and shifted a little, acting as if the sight hadn’t fazed him. He walked over to Cas with the dessert, placing it on the table.
With shaky hands, he lifts his arm up to the door, giving it three short raps. He hears the paper shuffling stop.
Dean finds himself at the window of the study and isn’t hesitant to throw the window doors open. In a swift movement, he crawls out onto the roof and into the cool air of the night. He spots his husband almost immediately, sitting only a few feet away with his knees tucked up under his chin and his eyes closed.
Dean should’ve expected it, but the words still shock him. He has no memories of ever being a knight, ever being there before and he has no memories of the prince or their time together. He has no idea how he ever was a knight, how he was able to protect the prince for that long. He doesn’t realise how he could have even existed a hundred years ago and still be alive today. Fortunately, the Queen answers his unspoken question for him.
Grace doesn’t seem to be in disagreement, so Dean maneuvers her so that both of them can sit on the rocking chair in the room
“The first time I told it to you, we were 12. By then, stargazing had been my favourite thing to do with you. Of course, at this point you thought it was
much food, but wasn’t going to argue. Turns out he loved all sorts of foods, which didn’t seem to surprise Missouri much. In fact, she had made him a whole apple pie for his last night in Vale Village, telling him that it was going to be the best thing he has tasted so far. After his first bite, he knew that her words were true.
When Dean reaches the door, he gives a quick few taps to announce his arrival before entering. As he swings the door open, he immediately meets the gaze of sharp green eyes.
Finally, Dean felt the grin come to his face and with a small shake of his head, he opened his arms up. Cas stepped into them and soon, the two of them were hugging. Dean melted into the touch, sunk into the warmth of his friend’s grip around him. It was comforting, especially after a long day of classes. Cas’ hug reminded him of when his mom would give him hot cocoa on a rainy day. It was inviting and comforting. Dean only realised that it had gone on a moment too long when his friend fidgeted, obviously becoming uncomfortable. Dean was quick to let go, embarrassed that he had over stepped.
He finds a safe place for Baby, settling her there. He leans in and presses his forehead to her nose.
Dean. He found himself more determined on school work than ever, paying close attention to what his lecturers were saying so that he could block out the sound of girls gushing over what their boyfriends bought them as a romantic gift.
. He finished with the rough drawn egg, which he had also written out as he had learnt how to spell it in kindergarten.
“Uh… you know that Topeka is another forty minutes from here, right?” Dean asks, steadying himself on the wall as the train comes to a complete stop.
Cas returned the smile. “It’s definitely more suitable attire for a day out… and more comfortable I suppose.”
When she finally falls asleep, he sneaks out and to the inn, attempting to get a couple of hours sleep before the next day.
Castiel wanted to tell Benny all about the programming, about every single detail that they had found. Truth was, Castiel was actually the head researcher when it came to the Nephilims. There was no one else in the kingdom that had such intimate knowledge of ancient relics and machinery. The research that he had collected over the years with his father was vital to learning how the machines functioned and so he ended up directing many of the scholars in their tests and trials relating to the Nephilims.
At first, Cas thought Dean was crazy. But he saw the seriousness to Dean’s face and listened attentively as Dean discussed the plan. Although Cas was usually the sane and reasonable one… that afternoon, he found himself swept away with Dean’s plan.
“How many times have I told you, sister, that it is considered quite rude to be intrusive?” Hester spoke, walking up and standing just behind the faery on the bench. Hester stood tall in front of them all, dressed in her usual white attire: a white shirt and white trousers. Her long blonde hair flowed in shiny waves down her shoulders, stopping just above her upper arm. Her blue champion’s belt was wrapped around her waist, adding a burst of colour to her pale clothing, skin and wings.
were to strike, it would strike there. Anna’s footsteps echoed on the linoleum floor as she walked further into the room. As Castiel looked around, he noted that the room had several personal touches to it. Anna had placed a vase of flowers in one corner of the room and in the other corner, there was a large pile of books, ranging from books on history and science, to books of personal pleasure --- fiction books. Nearer to the window, a painting was propped up against the wall and Castiel believed that it was a landscape piece of Pontiac River, the main water source in the Grasslands. Castiel did not say anything about these personal touches, for he understood why Anna had them. Ever since taking her role as champion, this fortress had become her second home. She was required to know it well, required to train in it consistently. So why should she not be allowed to have some personal freedom in the design?
meeting one, they are a fascinating sight. Their wings are all different colours and glitter even when there is no light. Dean almost wants to reach over and touch one of them, but Charlie warns him that doing that would just aggravate them.
“But what I do know is that you may not know Castiel now, but you did know him back then. You knew him better than anybody. And there is no Dean that I know, even one who has no memory, that wouldn’t do anything for him.”
Dean wanted to say something more, but felt that it would probably be unwise. He turned and headed out the archway, in the direction that she had pointed before. Once he stepped outside, he turned to look at her, to see if she maybe had any last bit of advice for him.
As she laid in the spare bed of the Winchester home, she held in her hand the small piece of paper, the one with an address written neatly on it. As she looked at it, she focused her gaze on one word in particular. A word that confirmed where Cas had been all these years.
Cas again did not reply and instead stayed still, processing everything. The different emotions were all present on his face as he tried to pinpoint exactly what he was feeling. Claire watched him clench his fists and the way his eyes seemed to glance around the room as he quietly thought to himself.
The next week of August was the school kids first week back after summer break. The mornings at the bakery became hectic as high school students piled in to grab some breakfast and coffee before they headed to class. Afternoons were about the same and soon tables were being combined together so teenagers could ‘study’, when in reality, Dean knew they were just having an afternoon gossip.
Cas felt his blood run cold, the weight of Mary’s words hitting him like a ball of stone. He opened his mouth to speak, to reply, to say
Michael scowled and seemed like he was going to make no move to budge. However, after some time, he sighed and stepped back.
Which leads him to his third perk, the fact that he is able to walk out in public without so much as a second glance. Most people who run in the music industry and beyond know who Dean Smith is, but Dean bets they’d never be able to pick him out in a crowd. Well, maybe they’d be able to if he wore his signature stage look, an outfit that had been recently dubbed “The Dean Smith look” in various magazine articles.
They both gave her another hug before accepting the pie in gratitude. They stood and waved goodbye as both cars drove off back to Kansas. They waited there until they could no longer see them in the distance.
Mary Winchester had decorated her house in Valentine’s Day festivities leading up to the day. Although she herself knew that Valentine’s Day wasn’t a major holiday worth celebrating, unlike Easter and Christmas, she still like the idea behind it.
Although Dean laid in his bed and Cas on the mattress on the floor, neither of the boys could sleep. They spent an hour signing to each other until Mary walked in to scold them when Dean accidentally laughed too loud. They then spent the next thirty minutes laying in wide awake silence. When Dean was sure both his parents were asleep, he got out of bed and helped Cas up off the mattress. The two boys quietly snuck downstairs and into the kitchen, where Dean went in search for something to eat. Despite the amount of food they ate that night and the sugar that buzzed in their veins, the both of them were still in need of food. Dean rummaged in the fridge to find a container of three cheese muffins, obviously left over from the party. Dean silently grabbed the container out, before dragging Cas out to the backyard.
Before he can even think it through, he crosses the room straight towards Cas. He lifts up the arms of the chair, so that he can hook his legs over either side. He straddles Cas, lifting his hands up and holding the man’s head in them. His blue eyes are wide and frozen on Dean, but behind the worry and anticipation, Dean catches a gleam he’s only seen a few times in himself. Desire, yearning and
their next meal. He knows right now he is in a life-or-death situation and he needs to act. So, instinct kicks in.
It was once believed that vampires were humans who were turned by the forces of evil, and after long eons of time not being able to taste human blood, they slowly began to transform into the figures they are now. Castiel had encountered them only a few times prior, the first being when he was a child. They had been travelling as a family from Hell desert, back to the castle. The vampire had emerged on the road they were travelling on, causing their horses to stop. Castiel and his family were safe in the carriage, so he only got the quickest of glimpses. After that, his mother had forced him to turn his head away from the window, as Sir John got off his perch and slayed the monster right there on the road.
Dean rolled the sleeves of his shirt up and with a small internal push, he too sat down at the table. They were quiet for a moment, an awkward silence filling the room. Claire was tense and rigid in her seat, obviously concerned that she had pushed too far. Dean on the other hand, tried to ignore the jitters inside of him, psyching himself up to speak.
Cas is quiet for a moment as he contemplated the words Dean had just said. Then suddenly, he made eye contact with Dean and a tense energy filled the room.
and his parents pitiful gazes when he shows up alone to Christmas lunch. By this point, most people have met their soulmates. It’s rare to meet your soulmate past thirty, rarer to meet your soulmate past forty and damn near impossible to meet your soulmate from the age of fifty and beyond. Most people who haven’t met their soulmates by fifty are either just lucky if they do, or it’s most likely that they’ll never meet their soulmate in their lifetime.
However, his current experience in the region was a nice one. He sat on the cold ground, up against the trunk of an old oak tree. In his lap was his journal, a brown leather bound book that was gifted to him by his father. It was one of Castiel’s most prized possessions and something he never left the house without. Like his father, he was interested in exploring the place they lived in and learning each and everyone of its secrets. This included studying the wildlife.
“Excellent!” Benny exclaimed. “I have had a hard enough time working out the programming and controls for the fortress, I couldn’t imagine the job your researchers have with that machinery. It looked so… complex.”
“I have always loved you Dean.” She states. “Yet, I always knew you didn’t feel the same. I know you love me, but not in the same way I feel about you. I was so obsessed with my infatuation, I didn’t take the time to consider your own feelings. And my a hundred years of endless silence has allowed me time to think, to reflect. And I know that Heaven has other plans for you. Plans that lie far beyond myself.”
They pulled apart and stared at each other for a moment. Cas still looked shocked, almost as if he couldn’t believe that the kiss had just happened. Yet at the same time, a small smile pulled on his lips. It was then Dean knew that Cas didn’t regret it and that he hadn’t just completely fucked everything up.
“Good afternoon, Charlie,” Cas greets, in his deep, gravelly voice that still sends shivers up Dean’s spine. Despite having lived in the United States for seven years and officially becoming a U.S. citizen, Cas’ Russian accent is still as thick as ever. He’s fluent in English, although he sometimes struggles with slang, hence his formality most of the time. People who don't know him too well on occasion have trouble understanding what he’s saying. Dean, having known him for ten months, and dated him for nine, is practically Castiel’s own personal translator.
“Watching Azazel die,” she says and Dean realises that Azazel must have been the monster he just killed, “I noticed something. How he disappeared. The black goo?”
“You see, I am not like the others. My father, he created me first and I am the strongest of them all.” He seethes. “I don’t play their petty games, I don’t do their taunting. I just kill. It was why I was sent here, to this particular one because that girl. Mmm… did she put up a
The town, his job, and his friends were only just some of the reasons that he loved Lawrence. However, no one could deny that what he loved most about Lawrence was Dean Winchester.
Lawrence was surprisingly busy for 9am in the morning, people hustling and bustling about their days. Claire popped into the first coffee shop she could find. The relief that flooded through her as the caffeine entered her body was enough to give her back some of the motivation she lost. With determination, she drank her cup of coffee and had a look through the town, trying to see if she could find anything that connected her to the Shurley family.
The painting is of him, looking almost the exact same as he does now. The same dark blonde hair, green eyes, and freckles. It is different from the painting he saw of himself at his parent’s home, where he was just a bright-eyed child. Considering the painting is unfinished, since the background is incomplete, he figures that it was done just before the devastating events and Anna must have died before it could be complete.
She turned in the direction that Cas was standing, almost as if she was looking him straight in the eye.
They moved to the countryside because of the night sky, because Castiel was always obsessed with the stars. It had been like that since they were children, when they laid next to each other in their backyards in Lawrence. Cas would point out random constellations and spurt out facts as if he were an encyclopaedia. Dean would always hum as if he understood but ultimately, he just enjoyed the sound of Cas’ voice.
The Queen smiles softly, “I know and I do not expect you to rush to the castle now, that would be dangerous and would likely result in drastic consequences. There is still so much you need to learn, things that I am unable to teach you.”
By the time they got there, Castiel’s stomach was in knots and his heart was in his throat. He had experienced this twice before and each time, the outcome had been disappointing at best. What would happen if this did not work? What would happen if he could never access his power?
A knock at the door startles him from his thoughts. He turns to see his husband standing at the door, leaning against the doorway with a bright grin on his face. In his arms, a little boy wriggles and Castiel deduces that he just awoke from his sleep.
Dean looked over at his friend confused. Cas had studied far more than Dean had. He had his syllabus all prepared before they even started at UChicago. He had organised notes galore, labels and sticky notes, every transcription of the lectures printed out. Dean studied, of course. But as well as Cas?
A few years ago they had made amends, when Dean’s parents made an effort to right their wrongs. They had shown immense progress, from taking classes on Deaf culture to volunteering for local LGBT advocacy programs. Cas knew that Dean was proud of all the steps his parents had taken to apologise for their mistreatment and to prove to Dean that they wanted to be involved in his life. It was like Cas’ parents always said to him:
They had made their relationship official in late September, several weeks after they first met. It took a couple of dates, lots of conversations and several clumsy kisses on the front porch for them to put a label on what they were. It came as no surprise to their group of friends, who had seen them practically attached at the hip for those few weeks. From the moment he’d met Dean, Cas had immediately noticed the chemistry between them. They were drawn to each other like magnets, continuously seeking the other’s presence.
After five minutes of serving other customers and preparing their orders, Dean wandered over to Claire’s table. He placed down the coffee first and Claire immediately took a large gulp of it. He then placed down the ‘surprise’, which happened to be a slice of custard pie. Claire was quick to dig into it, obviously famished after a long day of classes. Dean, happy with his choice went to leave. However, Claire stopped him by signing:
Mary left the boys in the kitchen creating gingerbread cookies, while she took Sam out to do some Christmas shopping. Only five minutes into their baking and the house began to smell like ginger and sugar as the boys got to work rolling out the dough.
Dean just sighs and grabs his jacket, standing up. As he goes to leave, he leans over to ruffle his friend’s hair.
“I don’t know what it’s like to have a sister. Even if I did have one, I wouldn’t remember her. But… if I had one, I have a feeling you’d be it. We’ve spent some long hours on the road together, I think that makes us family.”
Though Cas stared at him with wide eyes and nodded softly, urging him to continue. Dean had no idea why, but he decided to take Cas’ word for it. He moved his hand further and further in, feeling the convulsing as it spread up his arm until all of a sudden… it just stopped.
And the sight of Sir John was enough to resurface memories of his father, the person he missed more than anything. He was always close to his father and he always found himself in his company. That meant most of the time that Sir John was around, on guard in the same room. It reminded him that Sir John was still here, that Dean still had a father. Yet Castiel had lost his, during a time when he needed him the most.
He sighed, giving the view of the island one last glance before turning to face his friend. She stood a few steps away from him, with her hands buried in the pockets of her champion’s jacket. Her long brown hair, that usually bounced in waves along her shoulders, was now tied back behind her head. Her scimitar hung from her weapons belt, a large and daunting blade that she knew how to wield ruthlessly. The Meg before him was no longer the kind friend that helped him through his father’s death, but rather a warrior -- a soldier ready for the war.
When he finally left the pool. He could not speak. Emotions swirled inside of him, hot and boiling, like a sandstorm. Dean did not try to speak to him either, but the look of pity in his eyes was enough to make Castiel want to scream. Together, they descended back down the mountain, watching as the sun began to set, not quite yet twilight. Castiel thought back to Meg’s words, about how cherished and wonderful a twenty-first birthday should be. He wanted to scoff.
They leave after that, listening to her instructions and finding their way to the dining hall. A faery in the doorway points them to Gilda, who sits alone at a table, eating some oats. They grab their own breakfast and head over, awkwardly joining them at the table. She looks over at them, bemused.
Their first kiss occurred on Dean’s bed, after they spent an hour lying there, discussing everything that had happened between them in the past few years.
at exactly five to nine in the morning. He isn’t particularly thrilled about being up this early, as he finished his last concert of the tour just last night. But the double shot of espresso in his drink is already beginning to work its magic — and he’s just stepped foot in the
Some of their guests arrived promptly at 6pm, while others were set to arrive later, closer to midnight.
Dean made sure to remember everything about Cas—from the wrinkles under his eyes, to the soft curve of his lips. From the furrow of his brow to his defining cheekbones. Cas’ face had filled out more since they last saw each other and he was definitely no longer the boy Dean left behind.  He was a man now, from the toned arms and chest, to the stubble along his jaw.
But as he looks down at his body, he knows that can’t be true. His body is littered in old wounds, faded scars that exist on his arms, torso and legs. There are so many that he can’t count them all and he wonders what type of trauma could have caused these marks. The thought brings about the first spark of fear in him. Why has he awoken in this body? Why has this one body got so many scars? What could he have possibly been through to become this…
A soft breeze blew past Billie, causing the flame of her candle to flicker. She paused, pursing her lips for a moment, before continuing her writing. It was quiet where she was, only the sound of faint cheers and her quill scratching parchment. She was in no mood for festivities, not when this vision laid so heavily on her mind.
He approached Dean’s door, which was opened, slightly ajar. He knew that was part of Dean’s duty, sleeping with the door open, in case anything were to happen to Castiel. He crept up to it, slowly peeking into the dark room. He could not see anything at first as there was no light source, not until a large bolt of lightning crashed down outside the castle, illuminating the room for just a moment. It was there that he saw Dean asleep in his bed, curled onto his side, his back facing away from Castiel. From the doorway, he could hear his soft, sleeping breaths, quiet but unmissable. He stood there for a moment, letting the comfort of knowing that Dean was there, calm him from his panicked state. After a few deep breaths, he slowly came to the realisation that he was lurking in the hall in an eerie manner, one that would surely frighten any guard that may eventually passby. He knew that it was best for him to head back to his room and attempt to sleep.
As Fall neared its descent into Winter, more and more people flocked to Dean’s bakery to order warm drinks to get them through the day.
“The reason I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day… isn’t just because I miss Cas… it’s because I will never forgive myself for letting him go.”
She straightened herself up in her seat, smoothing out her trousers. It seemed that it was customary for the women, or at least some of the women, in Dean’s home village to wear trousers.
“I am fine, I promise,” he said, hating that he was lying to his friend. Yet, he could not have Dean knowing what he heard in there. He could not have Dean worrying and carrying an even bigger burden than the one he already had.
that way. Living in Denver meant he was less likely to blurt out that he was in love with his best friend, which would most likely result in losing one of the closest people in his life.
Once lunch came to an end, all of them headed back to the dormitories to say the dreaded goodbyes. Dean was crushed in a hug by his mother as she tried not to weep too loudly into his shoulder. He was given a small hug by his father, who slipped a cheque for $200 into his hand. Michael and Duma both gave him small hugs, making him promise to look out for himself and Cas. And finally, he said an emotional goodbye to his brother—the both of them attempting not to cry.
“You are a hero with a heart of gold, Dean Winchester.” She replies. “Thank you for saving me and thank you, for being there for Cas.”
Dean’s bedroom was a floor below Castiel’s, but not far from the staircase. He moved slowly down the stairs, not wanting to alert the knights that were sequestered on guard nearby. One wrong move and he awoke the entire castle, meaning he would face the wrath of his mother. He thought about the stress his mother was under from the weight of her own duty. His father had been gone for eleven years, and during that time, the fate of Grace Island was left solely with his mother. Castiel hated the pressure she placed on him and his duty, but at the same time, he could not blame her. While Castiel was her son, she was also the leader of an entire kingdom. And Castiel knew that in the end, thousands of lives outweighed just the one.
Dean takes a moment to look out at the backyard, in an attempt to calm himself. He looks out at the large oak tree and the dead grass. He should probably do some mowing soon.
Instead, he got up and quietly crept into the adjoining bathroom. Evidence of their adventures from previous hours lay smeared on Dean’s stomach, so he did his best to clean up without making too much noise. He wanted nothing more than to
The moment broke when Dean lifted himself up onto his forearms, leaning forward to place a soft kiss on Cas’ forehead. He then, in one swift movement, rolled off Cas and onto the carpeted floor of their bedroom. He stretched for a moment and relaxed his muscles, before turning to Cas with a sly look in his eye.
Dean crossed his arms. “I like Cas too, okay? I’m not going to deny something is there. And I don’t want to lead him on or hurt him. Things are just… new. I just want to see where things are heading before I jump to anything, so you don’t need to worry. But, you’re lucky we’re friends and approaching someone that Castiel
“It’s hard to explain,” Dean says, “it feels like there, like there’s something I’m missing. And I know, I know I’m missing my memories but… it feels like something more. Something I can’t quite place. It’s something I’ve forgotten but it goes deeper than a memory, it’s… it’s like a part of me is missing…”
happy for him. He can’t deny the warmth he feels when he sees his brother grinning at his new husband as they dance together.
Realising he was letting the dark thoughts plague his mind, Dean decided it was best he joined the party. Clapping his brother on the shoulder, Dean got up and began to mingle, socialising with the high school friends he knew he would most likely not see again. It was how Cas found him over an hour later, coming up to Dean in the middle of his conversation with Bela Talbot. Upon seeing Cas, Dean immediately turned his attention to him—causing Bela to walk off in a huff.
Three figures crash out from the trees, snarling and growling. Dean barely gets a look at them before he is shoved to the ground, his arm scraping along the gravel. He hisses, the pain immediately there, a soft sting. He looks up at the creatures in front of him, feeling the way his heart leaps into his throat in fright. For these don’t look like him, they aren’t familiar like humans. These look evil, with black beaded eyes and long, sharp teeth. Their skin looks sickly and frail, they are almost too powerful for how weak they look. They grin at him, looking at him as if he is their next meal. In fact, he
Castiel nodded, heading to the door and carefully sneaking out. When he made it to his room without an altercation, he collapsed onto his bed, trying to get a few more minutes of sleep.
He looks at you like you are the centre of his entire universe, that nothing else matters. It’s pretty disgusting, actually.”
He sneaks in just in case, looking all around him in case anything were to jump out. However, after at least a minute, he finally feels himself relax.
“No matter what happens, I want you to know that I love you,” Dean whispers. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt love like this, which is what makes it so special. Your dad was right, you know? You’re beautiful, and I don’t think I understood what he meant until I saw you. I never thought I’d be someone’s dad. When I was a kid, I lost my mom and… I sort of lost my father as well. He.. well… we like to say he got sick. Which means he made some bad choices that made him not the best dad. He forgot about us, and he made me feel unwanted… unloved. I didn’t want to be a dad who forgot about his child or did anything to make them feel unloved. So I never thought I’d be a father in the way that I am to you.”
But out of everything he feels, that feeling of longing is the strongest of them all. And it is that feeling that pulls him down the driveway and straight to the front door.
Then as if it was fate, just as Dean was finishing his sentence, the spotlights shone straight up. A large roar of screams came from the crowd around them as the thematic music began to play, getting louder in swells. Cas was confused but intrigued and Dean couldn’t help but stare at him out of the corner of his eye.
He got out of the car and began to head inside, planning to ignore whatever was going on. That was until he noticed three things. One, that his neighbour was shaking his head repeatedly and pointing to his ears. Second, that he had his phone open on a notes app and was shoving it towards the enraged stranger, who was refusing to take it. Three, the neighbour making eye contact with him and sending him a look of clear desperation.
Dean had another terrible night’s sleep, filled with endless nightmares and the sound of men screaming. He awoke in a cold sweat one too many times and it was when it finally reached 5am that he decided to start his day early. He was grumpy and in a foul mood and wanted nothing more than to try reach out for Cas and beg him to come home. Though at the same time, he knew that it would be useless. Cas did need his space, after the fucking nuclear bomb that Dean dropped on him. He’d just told his friend that he was
They grin and yell: “Yes Dad!” as they rush towards the sink in the kitchen. He sighs, hoping he doesn’t cause a fight between the two of them. The twins are like two peas in a pod, most of the time. Afterall, they
He grabbed Castiel’s hand—to which his friend gave him a confused look—and led him over to his desk. He grabbed out a blank piece of paper and one of his pencils, pushing it into Castiel’s hand. This is how they communicated on a regular basis and if there was any way for Castiel to communicate what was troubling him… this was it.
He barely had time to register it before Dean came back into the room, stopping when he saw what Cas was looking at.
“And I’ll try to start seeing you more as who you are than who you were. For what it’s worth… I’ll try.”
He finds himself quickly slipping into the open one ready to go up. A few other people are already inside, but none of them give him a second glance. He isn’t sure whether it’s because they don’t recognise him, or they
He walked up to the front door and rang the light bell, waiting impatiently for someone to let him in. Dean wasn’t surprised to see that it was Duma who answered the door. However, he
Charlie sighs, “Ma --- Missouri won’t allow it. After what happened to my parents, she doesn’t want me journeying alone. She feels that it is unsafe.”
Dean hadn’t thought that she would be Cas’ type. She was rebellious, outspoken, eccentric. She was charismatic and snarky, a girl who wouldn’t take anyone’s shit. She wore leather jacket, had a motorcycle license,
“Former champion,” Dean mutters, “I barely remember who I am. It’ll be just as risky as going by yourself!”
It’s early in the morning when Dean wakes up, the dream fresh in his head. However, as he stirs into reality, he realises that it wasn’t a dream. It was way too vivid to be a dream and way too real. And in that dream, he saw the prince, actually
Castiel pursed his lips, not wanting to admit his current thoughts and feelings to their fullest extent. He took a deep breath, scripted the words in his head and answered.
Dean gives him a shaky smile and takes a hesitant step inside, worried that at any moment, Cas will snap and want him gone.
believe this is real. You… you are too good for me. You are better than me. This has to be a lie. You… you
He wasn’t allowed to go out and socialise. Instead, he spent most of his time with either his team, or the band he happened to be touring for (there were always exceptions to the rule). No photos were shared, no details about his life of any kind. Yet despite their efforts, some of Dean’s personal information was still found by former-special-ops Cole Trenton, and used as a bargaining chip. It had been a rough two weeks, and Dean had felt as if he’d hit rock bottom. While it worked out in the end, with Trenton imprisoned and security increased, Dean can understand the precautions Pamela and his team are still now taking.
Castiel felt as if he was taking advantage of Dean, despite that Dean was willingly offering hugs and comfort. Maybe it was the guilt that he was hiding this secret about himself from Dean. That Dean was offering to share the bed with him, not knowing that Castiel actually appreciated the comfort provided in a different way than intended. Yet with the fear still an everlasting presence in his mind, he could not turn down such an offer.
They say their goodbyes, before Dean hangs up the phone and slips back inside. He packs up the remnants of the wrapping paper into a garbage bag and piles Grace’s presents neatly into a corner of the room. He then walks to the kitchen to find Cas who is draining the sink and drying the last of the plates. He turns to look at Dean with a small smile.
When he got the acceptance letter to KU, he was happy, knowing he’d be able to remain in Lawrence for his studies. He assumed that Dean would be staying as well, taking a year off to work full-time at his father’s auto shop. He figured that it would continue to be like it always was, the two of them together. They’d continue to spend Saturdays watching movies at the Winchester’s and Friday nights having dinner in the heart of Lawrence. No need for change.
Dean nodded eagerly. Knowing that his memories were there, but just hidden, gave him some hope that maybe, he’d one day remember everything and if there was something Missouri could do to help him get there, then he was willing to let her do it.
The next morning, they left early to travel to The Pit, otherwise known as Hell desert. In the heart of the desert was Hellian, the desert’s town, where the champion resided. It was a day’s travel to the town, including a thirty minute walk across the desert. The nearest stable was on the edge of the desert, since it was not healthy for the horses to travel through so much sand.
Grace Island held many secrets, but it also revealed many truths too. It was the island where the angel, Michael first stepped foot on Earth and the island that would forever bear the tragedy of his past. He was sent to observe, survey the land, watch over God’s creations. He was not meant to be seen by the humans, for they were not meant to know the existence of the angels. But upon his arrival he met Grace, the eldest child of a shepherd and a seamstress. When he first laid eyes on her, watched her tend to her father’s sheep, he was entranced. He would forever be pulled into her orbit, an innate need that eventually led him to harm. For angels and humans were never meant to lay together, never meant to possess a deep, abiding love for each other. Yet when Michael met Grace, their entire world shifted and a forbidden love bloomed. It was not long afterwards that Grace bore their first child, a child with both human blood and angelic magic running through their veins. It was a child so powerful that their birth was far too enervating for their mother to handle and subsequently, Grace was laid to rest.
It all changed eighty years ago, when Castiel’s grandfather and Meg’s grandfather signed a treaty, promising no more war and hatred between the two civilisations. The treaty agreed that the kingdom would donate a yearly supply of seafood, grains and fruit to the town. In exchange, the town would donate some of their finest materials, including creating handcrafted garments. A part of the arrangement was that twice a year, the noble family of Hellian and the royal family would dine together. With one of the meals being in Hellian and the other being in the castle.
Meg had been the only friend Castiel had for most of his life, although they only saw each other twice a year. Their families were once sworn enemies, dating back to the time of Grace and Michael. Meg’s ancestors were some of the first humans to reside on Grace Island. Upon seeing what happened to Grace due to her relationship with the angels, a small group of them swore vengeance against the angels. For several millennia, they fought the royal family, believing them to be evil and corrupt. Many wars were won and lost, several humans from both Hellian and the kingdom were killed. And the last time The Empty arose, the Hellian’s champion, Ruby, was banished from the town upon her involvement with the kingdom.
He grabs one of the baby monitors from the dresser on his way out, before indicating his head down the hall. Dean realises he is gesturing for him to follow.
The next two hours dragged by, with Dean feeling nauseous the entire time. He continued to stumble through his lectures, looking like an absolute moron in front of his students. Yet, he finally completed his last lecture and wasn’t hesitant to bolt out of the room as soon as the last student left. He rapidly began to walk to the bus stop, deciding to go to the one on the main street rather than the museum. Cas wasn’t with him and he knew that the alternate path was quicker.
“The disappearing spirits?” Kevin asked with a small hint of a smile. “Yes, I have happened to notice.”
The clock on his side table read 2am, two hours before he was meant to wake. Dean glared at the bright green numbers and with a sigh, crawled out of bed. He made his way to his tiny kitchen, just big enough for him to cook the bare minimum. It was nothing compared to the kitchen at the bakery—but for Dean to afford to pay for all the utilities at his store, he needed a cheap apartment.
Unfortunately for Sam, that was the moment both Michael and John had walked in with boxes—the both of them sending the fourteen-year-old a stern look. Sam blushed and muttered an apology, before he shuffled downstairs to get more of the belongings.
“But duty calls, you know how it is,” Pam continues, “The big men upstairs wanted to run the numbers with me. Let’s just say, they were—
Knowing all of this was what led Castiel to make his next decision. It was what led Castiel to run forward, arms outstretched, right into the blast zone.
-- he realised that he knew this would happen. Castiel did not doubt that Dean would die for him, just in order to give him a chance. However, Castiel also knew that he had promised himself that no matter what happened, he would not let Dean do that for him.
However, then came the funeral a week later. The four of them and Cas piled into the church, to say their goodbyes to their friend. As the eulogy began, Dean held Charlie’s hand and kept his head down, listening to the heart wrenching words said by Kevin’s mom. As she spoke, he felt Cas beginning to poke and prod him urgently through his energy, as if he was trying to say something to him.
That was always something that Castiel found challenging. In fact, if it weren’t for his middle school biology class, Castiel wondered if he ever would’ve made a friend at all.
He asked, genuine worry in his eyes. As much as Dean wanted to say they wouldn’t be, he knew he couldn’t promise that. Cas was heading for the big leagues, for a college far more superior than Dean could ever attend. He would probably make tons of friends, end up dating some lovely girl, become top of his cohort and leave Dean behind. Dean always wondered if Cas had stuck around all these years because they were so close in proximity, rather than him actually enjoying Dean’s company.
The two of them cried for a long time, letting out the emotions that had built up between the both of them. After some time, they found themselves sitting on Cas’ bed, discussing what had happened. Cas explained that the three people who hurt him were immediately caught and a suspension was being put into place. Dean tried to get Cas to tell him the names of the three bastards, but his friend wouldn’t budge. Dean asked Cas why he didn’t tell him and Cas said he didn’t want Dean to worry or get mad. Dean reminded Cas of their ‘new school year resolution’ and made Cas promise to tell him next time.
Instead of calling in sick for his lectures, Dean decided that in a fit of petty rage he was going to take the shorter way to campus. He sat on the bus, listening to various artists through his headphones. He tried to let the music drown out his feelings of embarrassment and shame, along with the frustration he felt for his own behaviour. The frustration he felt that he had forced his friend to need to escape, to get away from him.
“Instead of being here, you should be out at the prayer circle every chance you are given. Or, travelling to the other pools of fate. Instead of sitting here, looking over these ancient relics, you should be giving priority to the role that you have in this fight. The role you are destined to do.”
They met their horses at the mountain’s gate, preparing to ride them back to the castle. As Castiel was patting Novak, he wondered what was going to come of his failure. Unfortunately, the land seemed to answer for him.
Dean turns around quickly, sword at the ready. However, he lowers it when he realises who is in front of him.
“I don’t think I ever thought I’d end up here.” Dean says honestly. Before he met Cas, he never thought he’d be able to do this. Be up in front of his family with a ring around his finger, with his arms around his husband and soulmate. He glances to the side quickly, seeing his family all sitting at the same table smiling at them. Kate is snapping photos religiously, with his dad making the exact same face he did during Adam’s first dance. Sam and Jess are smiling, Jess’ arms wrapped tightly around her swollen belly, Dean’s little niece two months away from being born. Adam and Michael sit behind them, huge grins on their face, obviously elated seeing both their brothers up there together. Even Gabe is smiling like a maniac, looking the happiest Dean’s ever seen him. And considering Gabe is never
“He was asleep for a very long time, but he’s here to help.” Charlie says, causing Lord Inias’ attention to turn to her. “I’m Charlie, from Vale Village.”
Dean fondly watches as his husband drew another shape in the sky—which Dean knows is Andromeda’s constellation. Again, he is unable to place it in the thousands of stars.
Because most kids don’t really know what they want to be, especially not at five-years-old. Dean remembers when his brother Sam was five and he’d been set on becoming a power ranger. Now? He’d just finished law school at Stanford. Dean had attended his graduation back in May. His friend at the time, Taylor, had wanted to be a nurse. And now, he’s currently serving in Iraq as a combat medic. Dean knew so many people who had become something different from what they’d wanted to be as children.
“I am observing the bees,” Castiel replied to Dean’s question, “I find them and their patterns of movement… interesting.”
By the time he had packed his satchel for the journey and exited his room, Dean was already waiting for him, his own bag strapped to his shoulder. Castiel noticed that he was wearing his champion’s tunic which was a deep blue colour -- the royal family’s colour.
Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester met on a stormy day in November of 1994, in the small city of Lawrence, Kansas. It was a day that neither of them had any memory of, considering they were both only two years of age. But Dean’s mother Mary, has retold the story to them countless times.
Hester curled a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear and he could see the hint of a smirk on her lips.
She glared at him but did as she was told, looking around the dark hall and listening. It takes her a moment, but eventually, her face brightens with an idea.
Since their first meeting, Dean and Castiel hadn’t lived more than a forty minute car ride from each other. After high school, Dean won a football scholarship to a university in Kansas City, about forty miles away from where they lived in Lawrence, Kansas. Since Cas stayed local and attended KU, the two of them were still able to frequently see each other, including every Friday night.
“With their acceptance, he used the head of Medusa to turn Cetus to stone. However, upon her rescue - Perseus discovered that Andromeda was betrothed to another man.”
a path. He almost attempts to ask once, but decides he better not jinx it. He wouldn’t want something terrible to happen or for Charlie’s theory to be wrong. He decides he better appreciate the luck they have and hold onto it while it lasts.
Dean looks at it in awe, Charlie’s words immediately rushing to his head. Silent Prince’s weren’t just Cas’ favourite flower because of their beauty, Cas knew the story as well. Cas had also told Dean the story one day, during one of his expeditions into the fields of Grace Island. Dean felt that Cas enjoyed the flowers not just because of their potency, but because he wanted to experience a moment like those in the legend. He wanted to confess and promise himself to a beloved upon the sheen of the blue flower.
Mary’s face immediately lit up and she eagerly invited Claire inside. It felt so surreal to Claire that she was inside the Winchester home. As she followed Mary through the house, all the stories burned in her brain like the imprint of a hot iron.
Just as Cas went to sign a reply. Dean heard a loud ding from the kitchen. While Cas couldn’t hear it, he noticed Dean’s reaction and asked him what was going on. Dean signed to Cas that he would be right back and wandered into the kitchen. He went over to the oven, put his mitts on and pulled out the dessert that had been baking for the last forty minutes. He placed it on the rack to cool and pulled off the mitts, ready to go back out to Cas—only to see that the man had followed him in there.
Unfortunately, Cas and Meg were still together and better than ever. When Meg wasn’t over constantly, Cas was out at her’s. Dean still found himself rarely seeing his friend… to the point he practically began to long for him.
occurred, some people from our town found two saddled horses on the outskirts. They were both your’s and the prince’s. We kept both of them here for a while and they both ended up breeding with other horses. While the prince’s horse and his foul ended up going to a family in the Grasslands town, your horse and his descendants stayed here the entire time. I heard your parents looked after them for a while, until they… um…”
Before Cas could comment or refute, Dean was digging through his duffle. He pulled out some clothes and thrusted it into Cas’ arms.
Castiel blinked for a moment, before nodding his head in agreement. For the words he hoped to say to Dean, all the promises and regrets, should only be heard from his own lips. He hoped that the time would come, when Den would be able to listen.
“Do you mean, am I serious about letting you finish your duties? Of course I am, if that is what you…”
Missouri let out a small laugh, “Don’t look so sad, Dean. The magic does not work that easily, it will take time. You will begin to remember, I am sure of it. However, for now, all you can do is rest here for a few days, before preparing to travel to the fortresses. I shall make sure to gather all you will need for such a tremendous expedition. In the meanwhile, Charlie shall show you around and lead you to where you may stay for the night.”
of you to talk to Prince Castiel.” The man snapped, glaring down at his son before turning to Castiel.
heal all the pain though,” Dean replies. Growing up, he was told by many people that eventually, time would heal all wounds -- a statement he grew to hate. He’s learnt from experience that it couldn’t be further from the truth.
Dean gritted his teeth. Sometimes it was hard for him to realise that Cas lived long before he did. Cas had views that were very old fashioned, despite the fact that he was currently present for the 21st century. While he may not have realised it, his views on the show and the person, were bordering on the homophobic line.
He threw himself in front of Dean with a cry and all of a sudden, he could see nothing but white. A bright light pierced the area around him, blocking his view of everything. At first, panic seized him and he wondered if maybe he had just entered the afterlife. Maybe the blast had actually hit him after all, killing him instantly. Yet, how could he have not felt pain at all? Though before he could ponder that thought, the white began to fade and after blinking his eyes for a few moments, Castiel adjusted his vision back into reality.
Claire signed for paper, trying to mouth the word the best she could.  However, it turns out she was in luck as the woman’s smile widened.
Cas’ parents had always been supportive of him, neither of them batting so much as an eyelash when he came out to them. He wasn’t able to relate the rejection Dean had felt from his family. Cas may have also been the odd one out in his family, but it never disadvantaged him in any way. So when Dean told him his story, all Cas could do was listen to every word and hold Dean’s hand throughout. He was glad to see that Dean no longer suffered, and that he was on good terms with his parents. It was hard for Cas to believe that the two people he’d met were the same people Dean described. It showed Cas how years of dedication and hard work to change your views and prejudices could pay off, and how most importantly, being a good parent trumped everything else.
Cas let out a gush of air and immediately buried his head into his hands. Claire didn’t understand what the story behind the name was or what significance it had to Cas. Dean had never mentioned it… yet Claire had never asked. It seemed like a simple bakery name, one Dean had come up with randomly when he created his business.
Dean has attempted to picture what his soulmate would look like for years, practically since he knew what a soulmate was. It’s changed over the years, plenty of times, to the point that now his soulmate is just a shadowy figure. He used to see people on the street and wonder if they could be his soulmate, what they might look like together. He even imagined it with previous flings of his, even though he knew that there was no possible way that they were soulmates. But after some time, it got tedious dreaming about all the
The Grasslands region was vast, one of the largest regions in Grace Island. It stemmed from the base of Mount Lazarus, all the way to the rocky formations of the desert region. The Grasslands border sat on the cusp of the kingdom’s border and extended back as far as the ocean. On the coastline of this region sat some more hills, some of the tallest hills on the island. The tallest was called The Hill of Life, and not many people ventured to it. The hill was covered in trees and shrubbery and many, well,
After some time, Dean came back and Castiel watched in amusement as the two of them began to bicker -- bicker in a way where Dean did not even need to say a word.
But as he looked over at Dean, the both of them together again and the story of their relationship completely rewritten… he found he didn’t care at all.
“Why the hell would you think that?” Dean asked incredulously, as if Cas had just told him that the Earth was flat.
Their letters presented more ominous signs of The Empty’s return. There was a rise in monster activity, more camps being found all over the regions. Animals were becoming more weary at night, the cattle and sheep constantly startled and unsteady. Some native trees and plants were beginning to die, as if someone had deprived them of all light and nutrients. The more Castiel heard, the more he could not shake the heavy feeling that soon, a battle would begin.
The range of weaponry that the fortresses held was fascinating, and also quite terrifying. Castiel was much happier to study these things from afar and observe, but he could never actually pilot one of these buildings. Sometimes, he felt that the champions were all much braver than him.
The travel to and up the mountain had taken most of the day. They had travelled through various fields, including the swamp, and up a steep inclination until they were able to reach the pool of fate. They passed by the entrance to Vale Village, but did not go through. Castiel could see the way Dean looked over mournfully, almost as if he too were worried about their predicament. He wondered if Dean had buried down his feelings and was being brave for Castiel. He wondered if Dean too, like everyone else, truly did not believe that he could harness this power.
However, when the mid afternoon started to dawn on them, they decided it was best that they began getting prepared.
It takes them three hours to reach the base of the mountain and another hour to climb up to the plateau. When they reach there, even Crowley is panting, his forehead gleaming from sweat.
He’d also learnt two more pieces of information about his next-door neighbour. First, he owned the sleek, black Chevy that had stolen Castiel’s spot a few days prior. It was a loud car, always making a rumble when turned on and he found that he always knew when his neighbour was leaving or returning, just based on the noise. Second, that
“Well, are you sure it’s the truth?” Pam asks, glancing over at the letters still perched neatly in the box. “You know the odds of male pregnancy are only like, what? 0.01% of the population?”
He shoves Dean to the ground, lying on top of him, his hands clawed around Dean’s throat. Dean grabs the sword and with all the strength he can muster, he swings it across so that it slices the monster’s head off.
He paid for his gas quickly and jumped back in the car, getting back on route as quickly as possible.
He bid farewell to Bobby, journeying away from the forest and leaving the sword in its rightful spot. It was where Dean had been given the sword, it is also where he would find it again.
The second he entered the room, his eyes were immediately drawn to the man in the center of it. Cas stood next to a lone table, with the tables that were usually scattered around the room pushed off to the side. The table was set for two with a candle lit in the middle. Cas was grinning brightly at Dean, dressed in the attire that Dean had helped pick out for him and a bouquet of flowers with a neatly wrapped present clutched in his hand. At first, the sight made Dean stop in his tracks and his heart thump frantically in his chest. It was a sight he had envisioned in his head, a fantasy that he had always wanted to come true. Seeing Cas like that made him freeze, even if it was just for a moment.
Dean recounts his meeting with Queen Naomi and the information she told him. Missouri listens quietly and attentively while he speaks.
They began to walk towards the house, only for Castiel to realise that John and Dean were not following. Mary must have noticed the look on his face, because she paused with a small smile.
he remembers calling it. The memory is so vivid in his mind that it takes him a moment to realise that this horse can’t be his. There is no way that a horse could’ve survived that long, still existed today after a hundred years.
Shortly afterwards, they began their journey back down the mountain, towards Purgatory village. Benny walked ahead, with Castiel and Dean trailing behind him. They were nearing the entrance to the village, when a soft growl pierced the quiet atmosphere. One second Dean was behind Castiel and the next, he was in front of him,
“I’m sorry Cas, I should’ve at least given you a way to reach me. I shouldn’t have just abandoned you, and I feel awful.”
beginning to remember. And yet, it also confuses him. Missouri had also said that he and the prince were once close, and yet, that memory proved otherwise. The prince hated him, despised him and his royal duties. Did something change? What was he missing?
“This is a good place Dean.” He said. “And I saw the campus, you’ll be sure to meet plenty of girls here.”
“How do you know about me?” Dean asks instead of the million other questions running through his mind.
He watches as Cas looks up from his paperwork, a scowl on his face for whoever has intruded on his space. However, as soon as his eyes land on Dean, his face goes completely blank.
“Laugh it up bitch. At least I’m the big college kid and you’re just a high school freshman” Dean spoke, signing along as he did so.
“No, not yet. However, I am confident that it will happen soon. My training has been going impeccably.”
Then, again, as quickly as it came, it stopped. However, this time, it felt more finite to Dean. He watched as Missouri sighed and disconnected their hands. She opened her eyes and stared over at Dean with a disappointed look.
Sixth grade was where he met his two closest friends, when the three of them were forced to sit together in biology. He first met Charlie, who at the time was a small little girl who constantly wore her red hair in two identical plaits. In the first five minutes of sitting together, they almost instantaneously became friends, sharing in a love of comic books and
The two of them spent the next five minutes cooing over pictures of Charlie and Gilda’s daughter, until something clearing their throat interrupted them. They turned to see Cas, staring at them with narrowed eyes.
Cas then began to tell another embarrassing story about Balthazar, as the sun slowly began to descend into the night.
As he nears the building, he slowly creeps up to it. He has no idea if monsters ended up settling inside, out of his view. If there are monsters there, he wouldn’t want to alert them of his presence, especially without a weapon in his hand. He crouches against the wall of the building and carefully, with his heart beating loudly in his ears, he peeks in.
Dean led him to the building in the middle, a two story villa which was guarded by two soldiers. He knew them as members of the royal guard, stationed there by his mother to protect the prophet. Upon seeing both Castiel and Dean, the two guards took a step to the side, allowing the both of them entry.
The memory was still fresh in his mind, gnawing away at him as he cleaned. He was happy Jody had interrupted them because there was one point Dean had made a point of not mentioning to Claire.
But he looked over at Dean, who was looking over at him with both surprise and uncertainty, he knew that it was not his call to be made. He would be safe in the inn, there was no need for a personal guard. He knew that Dean stayed here out of a sense of obligation, but Castiel had not ordered him to.
“What happened?!” Dean yelled and signed, anger filling every fibre of his being. “WHO DID THIS TO YOU?”
“The fortresses required a special code, not only to unlock them, but to override their main systems. That code has only been told to a few select people: the champions, the Prince, the Queen and myself. At one point, I was the only one left standing with the code and while I may be able to enter the fortresses, I am no match for whatever lies inside. With your natural ability, I have no doubt that you will be strong enough to handle them and that you will use that time to become confident enough to face the beast.”
The friendship that Meg and Castiel had formed over the years, the mutual bond they had stemming from childhood, was what kept the treaty strong. Sometimes, Castiel found it strange that they were so close. They had opposite personalities, with Meg being very outspoken, confident and strong-willed, while Castiel was quite timid and preferred to keep to himself. Yet somehow, between the two of them, they made it work.
“I just healed you,” Anna says, “for the last time. Like I did when we were children, or after you got into some nasty fights with some monsters.”
Dean wants to say more, wants to sit here and blame himself further. Yet, he knows Cas will just do the same and they’ll end up in a repetitive cycle. The nerves seep into his chest again, the one question he’s wanted to ask burning on the tip of his tongue. He clenches his fists and doesn’t break his gaze with Cas.
shirt and dark blue eyeliner. Dean raised an eyebrow at her when she made eye contact with him upon entering. She frowned at him before marching up to the counter and immediately beginning to sign.
Her face was pinched in the way it always was when she was angry. Or disappointed in him. If Castiel had to guess, it was both.
Ever since his trip to Mount Lebanon the previous week, Castiel had been trapped in feelings of despair and anger. He had spent each and everyday on his training, trying to work his mind and soul in order to unlock the powers he held within. Yet, no matter how much he tried, nothing seemed to work. No matter how many times he poured over the books, or chanted, or was distracted by Dean -- nothing seemed to help him escape the knowledge that he was a complete and utter failure.
Relief poured over Dean and he nodded, pushing forward his homework to Cas and letting his friend read over it. He then grabbed one of the sandwiches and took a bite of it, watching his friend as he attempted to explain geometry to him.
“Grace Island has faced this evil before and the story is always the same,” Missouri continues, “the only ones to destroy this entity is a heroic knight, chosen by the sword of light and the prince, with the abilities of the angels.”
Before he could process it, Castiel dropped to his knees, his hand slipping from Dean’s. He heard Dean run a few steps ahead before grinding to a halt, realising that Castiel was no longer with him. Castiel looked down at the ground through his blurry vision and saw mud that had now covered his white garments. The dirt had tainted the purity of his clothing, just like The Empty had tainted his home.
“Whenever I was troubled, Mom used to always make me this drink.” Dean explained. “It was how I could think and work through my problems. Whether they were big or small.”
It took him a moment of deliberation but after some silence, he stepped to the side of the doorframe.
He didn’t know what he expected to see when he walked in; maybe candlelit tables with couples making heart eyes at each other or  hostess giving him a judging glance because he was there alone or even
The kiss doesn’t last long, they break apart quickly after. Their foreheads rest together, as Cas lifts his hand up and rakes it through Dean’s hair. Dean, although he’d never admit it aloud, practically preens at the touch. Cas then brings his hand down, cupping Dean’s jaw in his palm.
“I mean, sure it has a ‘happy ending’ but what about the poor dude that got turned to stone? I mean one minute he’s intent on marrying this girl and the next, he’s become a fucking statue.”
Prince Castiel had known this his entire life, which is why he knew that even in the early hours of dawn, he would never be able to see the sun properly rise.
No longer did Dean feel a pressure of energy around his hand--instead, under his fingertips, he felt a cold but solid body. He had his eyes closed, scrunched type in fear that he was going to do something to hurt Cas. So, he was slow to open them and see what in the hell his hand was touching. As he saw where his hand was, a breath ot caught at the back of his throat.
“How are your memories going?” Charlie ends up asking, once she has said all that she can about the Nephilims.
The word ‘no’ is immediately on Dean’s tongue, ready to escape. With Missouri forbidding Charlie from going into the fortresses and the monsters in the fortresses being what they were, Dean is ready to tell her to stay back. But then, he remembers that Castiel is unable to help him this time. And the fact that the monsters were not as bad as Dean thought them to be. He also realises that Charlie is an asset and despite the fact that it was dangerous, he knew that he would be there to help her.
“I was observing the Nephilim, Mother.” Castiel said, “I find them fascinating and they will be an asset to our battle against The Empty.”
Dean realises that he’s never been able to talk to anyone like he can with Cas, he doesn’t even talk this way with Sam. Their conversation flows so freely, with no awkward murmurs or uncomfortable moments. Dean feels like he’s just made a new friend, a
The party is a smashing success, and after a day full of screaming children, a trashed backyard and lots and
grade the same way Dean was. So with one last look, Dean pulled his attention back to his teacher and vowed to not stare at him anymore during the class.
He looks over at the other bag full of letters, those from the “crazy” fans, as his manager had dubbed them. Despite Pam telling him not to read them, he can’t help but feel curious. What could these fans have written, to have Pam refer to them as insane? While not exactly wanting Dean to read them, she didn’t seem all that concerned. So, he feels like none of them are another Trenton case. He peeks over at the bag, wondering if maybe he’ll be able to spot a random letter filled with pentagrams or written in blood (because that would definitely tick Dean’s “crazy” category), but instead the first thing he spots is an open shoebox filled with white envelopes. Each of them has his name and a random number written on the front in beautiful calligraphy, a style of writing Dean is
