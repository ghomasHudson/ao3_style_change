Dean isn’t chewing anymore. Just watching Castiel. His eyes gleam with tears that won’t be allowed to go anywhere.
“Merry Christmas, dears,” says Mrs. Claus fondly. “Please, take one of the other trees home with you free of charge. I insist.”
“Good,” Dean says, fishing out his credit card. “I hoped I’d get to spend almost a grand on a Christmas tree today.”
“I’ll find another one. And Canada isn’t dry,” Castiel adds about what is obviously some kind of beverage, for Dean’s amusement. “It’s notoriously snowy.”
“It’s not worth waiting for Sam,” he mutters. “You’d better burn it now. Do you have the lighter? Dean?”
Dean looks the evil Christmas tree up and down. It’s a real doozy: just a little bit taller than any tree grown on a Christmas tree farm should be, and so green and fragrant that there’s the very real temptation to just let it swallow you up.
“Thank you,” he says again. Sterner this time. The kind of tone that would have shattered glass and felled buildings before.
“You should sleep,” Castiel suggests, suddenly protective like a child with a small animal, “while Sam does.”
Dean swallows and gives him a half-smile, the corner of his mouth crooking up. “Sorry, man. I was just really craving ‘em after watching you shove a hundred down your gullet. And then when you were just crouched on the floor like a dog eating the raw stuff? Mwah!” He pinches his fingers together and kisses his fingertips. “Irresistible.”
“Yeah, you’re getting real hilarious,” Dean grumbles, standing up. “You be Carrie, I’ll distract Mrs. Claus.”
If Dean didn’t know any better about how this thing operates (which is to say, with total hatred of and scorn for all humankind), he’d think this lady was in on it. As it is, she’s just being a holly jolly pain in his ass. He can’t tell if ‘bachelor’ is homophobic code or she’s just a hater of fun, but either way, he makes an abrupt decision on how to play this.
As they lug the useless tree back to the Impala--no way is that thing going anywhere near Baby’s paint job-- Sam says, “Okay, you two aren’t allowed to have adventures on your own anymore. It always gets out of hand.”
Dean chuckles, then realizes that in a way he just made a date with his most recent makeout partner, then gladly turns his attention back to Mrs. Claus, who’s coming back with an alarmingly thick stack of papers.
“My pleasure,” Castiel says, grimacing at the hamburger because Dean will think it is funny but also because it is funny, a little, when he thinks about it. At the thought of the dozens of hamburgers he devoured, he almost feels a twinge of queasiness, like this body and its consequences are really his.
Dean laughs quietly. “You know--” His voice is casual, which tells Castiel that what he’s about to say matters. “This is pretty much the first time I’ve ever had company when Sam’s been sick.”
Dean thinks about Cas listening to him ramble on about how important it is to take the time to really kiss a girl to make her feel special before you do anything else. He’s torn between liking the idea of his words sticking with Cas like that and wanting to set himself on fire instead of the damn tree.
Dean notices Cas smiling at him, his face bright with amusement, and feels a surge of pure, uncomplicated goodness.
“It’s not easy. I had to superglue his socks over his hands. Which, you’ll be shocked to hear, created its own set of problems.”
Sam is, of course, tickled as hell. “Better keep an eye out for mistletoe. ‘Tis the season. You don’t want this to turn into a habit.”
Meanwhile, Cas must not waste any time, because right before Dean’s sealed the deal, the whole tree erupts into flames.
Castiel doubts that, but he understands the lie. The small rituals of normalcy, and how they make existence bearable.
Dean feels the distinct urge to turn around and whistle nonchalantly. He sneaks a glance at Cas, who is, of course, totally unbothered.
For twenty-four people so far this month, that temptation was irresistible. Now their souls are the tree’s prisoners, and the tree is getting stronger, and come Christmas Day, AKA tomorrow, it’s gonna rampage through town, devouring everything in its wake.
But there are moments, too, when he catches it in Dean’s eyes, in the curve of his lips and the set of his shoulders: the sharp awareness of how close they are and how far apart. How unlike anything else it is.
“Ah-ah-ah,” says Mrs. Claus. “This is our loveliest tree this season. An absolute triumph, as you can see. We aren’t comfortable selling it to just anyone.”
Dean takes a defiant bite, pretending to mock Castiel by eating it. But of course, that isn’t the truth about Dean, no matter how much Dean would like it to be. The truth is the bags on the floor.
“Oh, how wonderful! What a sweet gesture for your little boy after so much suffering. And I can tell just by the way you two stand next to each other that you’re madly in love.”
"Yes. They told me I could stay for a few days but then they amended their position and I was only allowed to stay one night."
"Ok, we'll order some lunch later. So listen Steve, I already called the shelter we usually send people to, but they're out of beds unfortunately. We're really not supposed to do this, but we can let you stay here tonight if you want. I'd be staying with you, just to be safe."
They don’t talk about it over breakfast. Instead, Cas talks about soil composition and growing seasons and pollinators and how he wants to make one of the rooms in the bunker into a greenhouse and Dean feels such a fondness filling his chest when Cas talks about the bees he watched, the way the bumblebees bumped into him drunkenly as he watered the oregano before they left. He looks at Cas as he rambles. He’s tan from the gardening. His face is getting wrinkled and careworn. Dean wants to see that face every day, for the rest of his life if he can.
“Uh-huh,” Dean mumbles into Cas’s shoulder. Cas laughs a little at him, and wraps him up in his arms.
Dean goes down to his knees, sucking Cas into his mouth, still fucking him steadily with his fingers. Seeing him on his knees, mouth full of Cas, makes him hot and breathless.
“What’s there to explain? You’re fucking married! Holy shit. What the fuck. Does anyone know?” he demands and Dean winces because no he hasn’t told anyone, not Jack, not Donna and Jody and the girls. No one.
There are his feet, the vulnerable arch, the tough soles, the hard bone of his ankle. The machinery of his body.
He doesn't answer immediately, not sure what to say. He's tired, he wants to curl up alone somewhere, but he will probably just end up sitting in the pay as you will cafe in town anyway until he can't anymore. At which point, we will wait in the park until the gas-n-sip closes and then he will sleep, and be awake again in time to open.
“God,” Dean breathes, “you’re so wet for me. Bet Jeremy didn’t fuck you this good, he didn’t make you this wet and hard. He doesn’t know what you need. Should have been you tied to that bed, not him. But you wouldn’t let him, need me to take you apart. Just me.”
“If I am perfectly capable of finding romance. I don’t want romance. I want you.” He says it with such conviction that Dean wants to believe him.
“I straightened your fingers,” Cas touches his hand, “And your collarbone,” he reaches towards Dean’s chest, hesitates, pulls back. “I remade each bone in your face as if they had never been broken.”
Cas feels again like he’s back in that shower at the first shelter, caught out, exposed, nervous. Cas has learned that he moves in certain ways when he’s nervous. He shifts his weight, he might even fidget. His hands will sweat, an annoying little biological tick that sometimes is his only cue that he is nervous at all.
Dean moves his hand away so Cas can shove his boxers down. It’s a shame, he reflects, he didn’t even have time to put on something nice for Dean. Dean dips his fingers into Cas then brings them back to his dick, smearing wetness there, rubbing the length, teasing his frenulum, making Cas gasp with how sensitive it is.
But Cas does. Cas, who is good and kind and sometimes arrogant to the point of self destruction and often wrong, deserves devotion. Cas, who feels so intensely guilty for his misdeeds, who wants to do better by the world. Cas, who Dean loves, even if it’s not the way the movies tell him he should love.
Cas is doing thesis reading, wearing just his boxers, lounging in their bed in the afternoon sunlight. One sturdy leg is propped up, vulnerable inside of his thigh golden in the light. It would be idyllic if Dean weren’t so fucking horny.
It doesn’t last, which is a relief too. Dean pulls out and grabs a dildo from the towel he brought in earlier. It must be one of Cas’s, Dean must have gotten it from the box in Cas’s cabin while Cas waited patiently on his knees. Dean doesn’t fuck him with it, just slides it home and pulls up Cas’s underwear over it.
“Fuck,” Cas breaths out, trying to grind down on Dean’s thigh. It’s awful with Dean’s jeans in the way.
Cas guides him down his cock. Dean lets himself be moved, eager to taste Cas, to be full of him in every way he can. He would keep Cas close all the time if he could, hold Cas in his mouth all day, alive and heavy on Dean’s tongue. He’s done it a few times, held Cas’s half hard cock in his mouth for hours; it’s as close to being part of Cas he can manage.
"We don't use this pavilion. Besides, they pollinate just as well as bees and I didn't let you kill them either.” There's water sliding down his nose as he speaks, making his eyes water. He scrubs it away.
Cas hums and rubs a hand along his back, before his arm falls away. When Dean looks up, he’s already asleep. Dean settles in close.
So, they add lazy make out sessions to the repertoire. It doesn’t happen often but sometimes Cas will pull him close and kiss him breathless and Dean didn’t know he could be kissed breathless without the promise of sex to follow but here he is, breathless and kissing Cas on the couch.
Dean finds it surprisingly easy to touch Castiel more. Without the weight of romance or sex behind touch it becomes a simple thing to cross into Cas’s personal space. He brushes a hand over Cas’s shoulder as he passes by and knocks their knees together at dinner. He hugs Cas more, puts an arm around his shoulder because he can. When he and Cas and Jack pile onto the couch to watch a movie Dean isn’t careful to keep himself away from Cas anymore.
There is a poem about a boy who hungers for the touch of other boys, through violence. Cas thinks of Dean. There is a poem on the endless human quest towards God and humanity's petty failures and endless toil nonetheless.
“Breathe. Cas, you need to breathe,” Dean reminds him. Cas takes an enormous shuddering breath; it makes the tears come back.
“Dean, I know you said you don’t want to date but I do need you to know that you are the most important person in my life. What I feel for you is no what I feel for Sam or Jack or what I felt for any of my siblings. I do need anything to change between us, but I need you to know, I am devoted to you.”
“I thought only divorced people could get married again,” Cas says looking up from the phone. Sam chokes.
The laundromat never stops feeling terribly vulnerable. On one of his first trips, a wild haired young woman had taken one look at his chest and gone to mutter to the attendant. He couldn’t hear the words, human hearing is severely lacking, but the looks they’d been casting at him had made his hands sweat. This is the only laundromat within comfortable walking distance of the gas-n-sip. He doesn't want to lose this.
He takes them off, almost knees Dean in the face in the process and then they're laughing again, fumbling and smiling and Dean loves him. Loves him so much he might burst with it.
"Fuck, that's hot," Cas gasps and Dean grins into his throat, setting a punishing pace. Cas throws his head back, a fuck he’s so loud, never shy about expressing his pleasure.
“Uh I don’t know. Hang on,” Sam scrolls for a minute, “Ok so aromantic is people who don’t feel romantic attraction and asexual people are people who don’t feel sexual desire? I don’t know man, the articles are really long. Here.”
“Of course,” he answers, and kisses Cas’s cheek. The movement presses his cock further into Cas, who cries out again, oversensative, and presses his face into the bed.
“Sorry,” he loosens his hold enough for Cas to start moving, riding Dean at a leisurely pace. He goes slow, drawing out his pleasure, luxuriating in the slide of Dean’s dick inside him, the satisfying stretch, the slight pleasant ache.
Dean has thought about it, he can admit that to himself at least. But it’s not something he craves, not something he needs to be happy with Cas.
There is small talk again, but perhaps it is not so small this time. Cas learns that they are together, that they have a cat, and a small garden of potted beans and tomatoes. He learns that Sky dropped out of school and was homeless until Mick picked them up. He learns that Mick works at a local warehouse and is active in the union. He asks what a union is.
He sits in the back at the reading. An older man with a brilliant smile and an oversized suit jacket opens the night by telling everyone the rules. No more than five minutes of reading, no apologizing, be polite. With that they're off. It's not really a performance. Really it's a group of friends reading each other their favorite poems. Mick reads in a low sonorous voice that people learn forward in their seats to listen to. Wren reads a poem about turning into a deer which Cas adores immediately. There are silly little poems about birds and flowers and puddles and children, and chilling poems about the loss of a child, and poems about the beloved, and poems about being high on the roof of a building and being in love--in love with everything. One person, reads a few evokative poems about sex and tying someone up and Cas thinks of Dean the whole time, much as he would prefer not to.
Command meetings bore Cas, but more than that, they make him itch. They are stark reminders that Dean doesn’t listen to him, nor particularly cares for his insight. So Cas kicks back, picking at his nails, mentally calculating the ways someone could attack this meeting and how Cas could take that person down.
“You’re beautiful. Beautiful man, you are so good to me. Come here. Let me fuck you like I promised,” Cas says and Dean can only answer, “Please.”
“I could help you sleep,” Cas offers, and Dean’s stomach drops. It’s not a flirtatious tone really, just easy, lose, matter of fact, but the implication is clear. Dean fights to keep his breathing steady.
So Dean breathes nice and even and watches Cas with his brow furrowed as he reads about early Christian heresies with Dean’s cock in him. He feels a little absurd, but mostly he feels filled up with purpose. He’s being
It's almost always like this, Cas taking control, pushing him around, turning him on, leaving him dazed. Dean loves it.
Cas licks over Dean’s fingers, slow and leisurely, somehow even his tongue feels more sensitive after those orgasms.
“He’s asleep,” Cas answers simply, which is not true in the slightest but Dean’s also in a dark part of the room, by some cabinets, It gives him a good view of the exits and makes him unobtrusive in the dark. He picked it exactly so anyone else in the cabin would think he was asleep at a glance.
“C’mon Dean, you can’t be that repressed. I see the way the two of you touch each other! The way you look at each other! I swear they can hear the two of you pining three states over.”
He licks his lips, tasting the bitterness. Dean makes a choked noise at that and presses a thumb to Cas’s bottom lip, then swipes at the cum on Cas’s cheek, bringing it to Cas’s mouth. Cas dutifully sucks the finger clean.
“Yeah, yeah, Cas ‘m your slut, all yours,” he promises, feeling stupid with how turned on he is. Cas hums low and beautiful and bites down on his neck, making Dean cry out as he clamps down. It renews the sting, which was just starting to settle into a steady throb.
Mick’s voice goes quiet and intense, “You safe? You need me to come get you? I just got home but I can head back out and pick you up. Where are you?”
A college student, Wren, talks about their struggles understanding what being nonbinary means, what nonbinary looks like, what nonbinary sounds like.
But that’s not what Dean has planned for tonight, so he grabs Cas’s ass and pulls him up onto Dean’s thigh and takes over the kiss. He runs his fingers down the cleft of Cas’s ass, gently circles his hole, making Cas gasp into his mouth. He keeps going like that, swallowing down the sounds Cas is making, enjoying the way Cas goes lax and hungry under his hands.
“Fuck, Cas, fuck,” he cries out when it finally pops all the way in, feeling a little hysterical with how good he feels. It also hurts, maybe more than he can stand.
He tugs Cas a little aimlessly, no plan, just wanting him closer. Cas swings a leg over Dean’s hips and settles his weight against Dean, leaning down to kiss his neck. Dean sighs as Cas nips at skin of his neck, jumps a little when Cas bites down a little too hard.
“Mmm, Jeremy, before the command meeting,” Dean presses harder and Cas’s breath hitches. “I fucked him. Tied him to the bed and came riding his dick.”
Now, in the dark, he sits on the floor, on his sleeping bag, and runs his fingers over his skin. He feels the fine texture of hair on his arms. Has hazy memories from Jimmy of his pride at his body hair. Farther up his biceps there’s less hair. There’s muscles there, in his arms. He presses his fingers into the meat until it aches a little. There’s the soft sensitive underside of his bicep. He reaches under his shirt, touching his chest, the hair there, the scars, the mostly numb nipples. He lays his palm flat, feels his heart beating through his sternum. Not Jimmy’s heart. His heart. He rests a hand on his side, feels his ribs expand and contract as he breathes. What a miracle, the human body.
“Didn’t know Jimmy was trans,” he comments with familiar forced calm, as Cas pulls the shirt on. It smells like the impala, like Dean, like leather and the inside of his duffle bag and gun oil.
It had not been easy, the first few months together. But the frantic needy sex they had those first few weeks had finally mellowed into something gentler, slower, something tender.
Now he grinds against Dean’s thigh. Dean’s looking down at where Cas is grinding against him, admiring the view, and Cas doesn’t want that. He twists his fingers into Dean’s hair, pulls his head back so he’s looking at Cas, only at Cas. Dean’s cock jerks when Cas tugs at his hair, his mouth falls open, his expression is bright and open and Cas blurts out, “There you are.”
staring at him. He wonders if fear is always like this, a skittery, shaky thing that makes him feel like a hunted animal. How do the Winchesters deal with it, being scared all the time?
“Want me to do it?” Dean asks, kneeling beside Cas on the bed, fiddling with the strap on one thigh, trying to get it comfortable. He’s so tempted to slide his cock into Cas’s mouth suddenly. Cas has an unforeseen enthusiasm for oral that Dean loves to receive. Whether it’s sucking his cock or eating him out, or sometimes, eating his ass, Cas applies himself with a focused kind of hunger that never fails to leave Dean quivering. Dean’s got a couple of photos squirreled away on his phone of Cas between his thighs, lips shining, looking dazed and ruined like he’s the one who just got eaten out to an inch of his life and not Dean.
“I love you. I want to make sure you know,” Cas says simply, like it’s nothing at all. Dean swallows and leans down to kiss the closest part of Cas, his knee.
thinks Cas. “But if you can’t remember how this fucking camp is run, if you need a goddamn reminder--” He doesn’t finish, instead pushing Cas’s head to the side to inspect his cheek, which is stinging from Dean’s hand.
Dean decides two can play at that game. He’s been reading on his phone beside Cas for the last hour, slumped in bed, loose-limbed in the afternoon heat. It’s still early in the semester and he’s not yet overwhelmed and exhausted, has a few hours to fuck around.
“‘Course I am,” Dean answers gruffly, as if he hasn’t ducked out on Cas a million times. “Brought us food from the mess. I didn’t want to wait for another break in the rain.”
“Never had pizza before?” Diran asks, the corners of his eyes crinkling in a smile as he watches Cas start his second slice.
"Hang on." Dean untangles himself for a moment to discard the condom and grab a pillow for them. When he turns back, Cas is on him, tucking his sweaty face into Dean’s neck. Dean strokes down his back with his non-lubey hand.
Dean keeps going like that, landing a couple hits on Cas, then teasing him with the toy until Cas is stretched out on him, twitching and whimpering and desperate to come, luxuriating in the space between pleasure and pain, open and raw and hurting. Cas is a gasping mess under Dean’s hands, ass hot and stinging, hard and wet and no doubt dripping around the dildo. He’s writhing, making little animal noises, his eyes are stinging, he’s sure the neighboring cabins can hear him yelling.
“We hope to send this tree home with a more discerning owner. Does your living room have space to accommodate it?”
“No,” Dean interrupts, before Mrs. Claus can get too bummed out. “Nuh uh. Just let the spirit of the season wash over you, candycane.” He tugs on the end of Cas’s festive seasonal scarf.
I sign to Aunt Eileen, “This motherfucker here thought it would be a good idea to scare me. She screamed in my ear, the less deaf one, and I reflexively kicked her. She was on my bed and she fell.”
Aunt Eileen narrows her eyes at us for a HOT MINUTE. But she reluctantly let go and gesticulate us toward to the bathroom to get ready for school.
The day feels FOREVER. I mean, it is only lunchtime. Ever since I woke up this morning, this feeling is becoming an irritation that seems to live in with me. I have never felt so much agitated because I snap at some people and I NEVER snap at people in school. I always do that at home, the people I live with. Sage, not so much but Aunt Eileen or Dad.
Damn it. How do we show them that we do not know anything? Other than the fact that I just met my father, who most definitely is a decoy.
Before I know, it is time to go home. I blink my eyes a few times. It is that fast? It could not be! I just started designing the floor plan!
I give her a sad smile and sign, “Yeah, you are probably right. I know that I make his life difficult because I have this damn awful stubbornness trait I appear to receive from that douchebag Dad always mention to me every time we argue.”
My dad and I always get into arguments about how much Dean Winchester is a deeply cared man who would do anything to protect his family. And every time I hear that, I roll my eyes hard and makes a disgusted face to inform him that the argument is done.
This feeling increases the intensity and for the life of me, I could not figure out what the hell is making me feel like this. I look around the environment again and I see practically nothing that screams dangerous or weird or suspicious. Something catches my attention and I whip my head. It is the sign that signals to green.
As both of them smiling with pride for their kids, Sage and Destiel take a look at the bizarre discussion.
I ask people around to see if they like the decorations. Majority of them love it as much as I do. And you know what? Dad is right. I feel much better knowing they approve. That makes things A LOT more excited.
I nod because yeah, I was not being a good kid and I was so hard on my dad for such a long time. Like the day I discovered that the guy in my dreams was my pops and I felt very self-conscious about him ever since.
I am flailing my arms then I thought of something. I put my arms up to the ceiling and I push down as hard as I can.
Dad signs, “Alright, then. Eileen can teach you both how to defend yourselves and fight. Please communicate with us if anything is out of ordinary. We will be right there when you text us or call me in your prayers.”
I see different emotions in his eyes. It looks like he have been slapped. He had never look and feel so ashamed.
I fall on Sage. I relieved because I am not flying in the air anymore. Sage nudges me to get off. I get off her.
Cas thought about Destiel. He feels really bad that he has not been there for her. It's just that she reminds me so much of Dean. The older she gets, the more stubborn she gets. She really is the spitting image of Dean and me, as well. Hence the name, Destiel.
I sign, “Honestly, I have no fucking idea what this is all about. But I know, for sure, something is coming. I am not sure what but something is. I don’t like it. And the floating in the air you saw? I wasn’t floating. I was FLYING."
She drinks and sigh. She makes breakfast for everyone. This is the first time she makes me breakfast. Apparently, Sage and Destiel both like to eat bacon. Sam would be disappointed to find out that Sage likes to eat bacon, just like Dean.
Cas looks confused and signs, “What precisely did I say that is wrong? I mean, I just find it funny that you are not like Sam, you are like Dean.”
Aunt Eileen signs, “Oh! He seems like an older man. I thought he is around your age. Haha. That’s really cool, Sage! I am glad to see that people like him make you smile. It’s nice! Do that often. Oh and the cookies are ready! But I see you have brought your pie, Destiel."
My dad is Castiel Novak. Yep, that's correct. He is a celestial being and he carries such a big name in the Supernatural world.
My ceiling. Up and close. I jerk my head away from the ceiling. I look around and see the entire ceiling from left to right and up to down. I get confused because what is the meaning of this? Why am I this close to my ceiling? How did I get up here? My thoughts are flying with million things.
We turn around with Sage brightens her smile and my small smile. It would be nice if he is the actual Sam Winchester though.
“What do I do, Eileen? Since the dawn of time, I never have experience with babies and stuff. I do not ever consider being a parent given by birth. Other than Claire since Jimmy Novak produced her."
I don’t give a fuck regardless because the decorations HAVE ARRIVED. I have been waiting for them like two months or so!! The decorations are beautiful and yes, very pricy. But it is so worth it all in the end because it is perfect! I think. But other people can suck it up.
She signs, “No, Sage. This is not normal, even supernatural normalcy as well. Do you know what happened?”
Sage and I walk into the kitchen to do our homework. I grab a bunch of cookies for us to munch on while Aunt Eileen is making dinner.
"Honestly, you are a NATURALLY HEAVY SLEEPER. So, yeah, I HAD to. Besides, you know how Uncle Castiel is like when he gets to handle that thing you DO," she signs.
The memory was Dean Winchester being disappointed and angry toward my dad and I could not stop replaying the memory over and over. It made me angry that he would still treat my dad after all my dad have done for Heaven and for the Winchesters.
My head is swarming with all those impossible thoughts because Sam Winchester had died. But he’s here, a living person in front of my eyes.
Just before we leave, I come in and buy the chocolate-peanut butter pie, not just a slice. The whole thing. This decoy Sam makes me nervous and I need something sweet. Big loads of sweet and this is it.
Cas nods and agrees. However, he cannot imagine the reunion between Destiel and Dean if that ever happens. It will not be pretty but I will be there for Destiel as always. Destiel is my number one person in life that I truly care about. Of course, Claire Novak comes in second. Only because she still find the fact that I put her father in heaven.
I roll my eyes at the old joke. Since my dad is a celestial being and can fly, Aunt Eileen would always say, “Now we wait until the matter of time Destiel gets to fly or levitate, whatever angel babies first display of flying! Fly you go or whatever the fuck it is!”
I raise my eyebrows and sign, “Something supernatural? We have not had that in a very long time. So why now? What changed?”
Sage and I go speechless. I feel strange again, only this time it is much clearer. It seems like it is coming from him. He is like a beacon of some kind.
Sage signs, “Are you ok? What is happening to you? First, you WERE floating in midair. And now this? Should we skip school?”
Eileen signs, “I’ll help you through your pregnancy. If that’s what you are asking. We can go through this together.”
School is finished for the day as I go right to meet the committee. On the door, it says: The boxes have arrived and are in the gym. Go there and see what’s in the box.
Yes, I have been dreaming of Dean Winchester lately and it is not a pretty feeling. Every time I see him, I want to punch him but the dream leaves so quickly. I never get the chance to tell him how I feel and that I always want to punch him in the face to let him know that he does not deserve my dad, Castiel Novak. My dad deserves a whole hell lot better someone than him.
I look up, with the breakfast sandwich in my hands, and about to bite. Before I take a bite, I quickly caught Aunt Eileen roll her eyes and gesticulate her hands in the air. I put my sandwich down and say, "You DID not just roll your eyes at me!"
Aunt Eileen smiles back and signs, “Yeah, today was a busy day but good! Sage told me that your decorations for Prom should arrive sometime soon?”
I sign, “This is what Uncle Sam and Dean see in you. And my dad. You reflexively reacted to the scary situation so you went to find your gun. I see you still have your hunter side. Damn, Aunt Eileen. I didn’t realize you are that BADASS.
I peer at Sage as she pours the creamer into the cup of coffee and mixes the coffee with a spoon. She takes a sip and sighs. She apparently likes it.
Ugh, don’t even get me started on him. The worst human being I ever heard in tales. Even the villains are better than him! I have seen all photos of him and I am still shaken that he is the one who got my dad pregnant. I mean, EW. I strongly advocate for LGBT+ community and such. But HIM? He does not deserve the privilege to be in the community since he has been an asshole to my dad.
At that moment, something strange is happening. I feel something. Something is trying to pull me and I fly away from it. I pause and stare at that area where it pulled me. First, my dad disappears and now something is pulling me. What is happening?
Cas grabs his hands and pins them down by the wrist with one hand. “Hold still,” he orders and Dean, like the idiot he is, answers, “Or what?”
“I don’t want anything else from you. I am happy with this,” he makes a strange human gesture, an aborted shrug, as if to encompass the world.
“You can use your hands, sweetheart,” Cas tells him and Dean didn’t even know he was asking for permission.
“Take these off,” he tells Cas. Cas hurries to comply and while he does, Dean strips his shirt off. Dean runs a hand over Cas’s side, over his chest, over his shoulder, become sturdy with muscle in recent years. Dean still has to ask him about how that happened, not that he’s complaining.
He doesn’t finish. He’s staring at Cas, paused halfway to the bed, an extra shirt hanging loosely in his hand.
“Fuck!” Dean groans out when Cas runs his nails down Dean’s chest again. He grabs onto the sheets and fucks up into Cas hard and fast until Cas is letting out little breathy moans. Cas braces himself against Dean’s chest and starts to fuck back on him with abandon, his thighs—fuck, his thighs, Dean wants to touch them—working as he fucks Dean hard.
Dean presses close, shoving a thigh between Cas’s legs, applying teeth to the parts of Cas he can reach until Cas is groaning and grinding against him.
Cas has been human for over a year now. He hasn’t shown any interest in angeling up. He lives with Sam and Dean and Jack in the bunker. He eats breakfast with them. He goes on hunts. He and Dean and Jack take occasional road trips to do all the touristy shit Dean never did as a kid. The four of them visited the ocean. Cas has a garden. He can’t cook but he regularly provided Dean with sinfully sweet tomatoes.
He sleeps on Cas's porch, in the damp and cold, listening to the frogs. He wakes with dew in his hair under a second blanket that hadn't been there the night before.
They stay like that until Dean’s too soft and slips out. Dean slides out from behind Cas to sit against the headboard beside him. Cas stays on his back, feeling hot come leak out of him with relish.
"I'm not reading anything of mine today, but I wanted to share a couple poems I've read recently with you all,"
“Yeah,” it’s Jack who answers, “It says that people in queerplatonic relationships can do some stuff from romantic relationships too but that they don’t really feel romantic feelings for each other.”
He’s close. He wants to tell Dean but he just groans, losing his rhythm as he chases his orgasm. Dean bends over Cas, thrusting fast and shallow and Cas can feel his orgasm, a bright heat low in his belly, just out of reach.
“Easy, sweetheart,” Cas soothes, suddenly there in front of him, kissing him. Dean lets the knot drop out of him, busy kissing Cas. Cas runs soothing hands over his sides, over his thighs, like he’s a startled animal.
Cas’s eyes narrow dangerously and yeah, ok, he’s got Cas’s attention now but Dean’s a little afraid this is going to end in righteous smiting rather than an orgasm.
Dean tries not to let it sting. They'd had long conversations when they first started fucking, about how pushy Dean could be sometimes, about how he wilted when Cas turned him down and wrongly assumed any tiny rejection meant he was unwanted entirely. Dean's not an idiot. He knows he throws his body at people because it's the only way he knew how to feel good and worthy for most of his life. He’s working on it.
Cas turns on his side, and Dean spoons up behind him. Dean sucks in a breath at the sight of him, his strong back, his hips, his ass, his thighs, the way he’s open and waiting for Dean. He runs a hand over one ass cheek, squeezes. Slicks up his cock, then spreads Cas’s cheeks, runs his slick fingers over his hole, drawing a garbled sound out of Dean. Dean slips two fingers in, needs to feel him warm and slick and tight around his fingers before he fucks him. Cas makes a high noise of protest.
Dean's expression flickers, it's so quick Cas can't read it but he gives Dean a slow once over anyway. Dean doesn’t often indulge Cas’s flirting, which is probably a stupid move since it only makes Cas try harder.
Dean huffs a little, something bitter and sardonic like he has any room to be angry about Cas sleeping with anyone else. Cas feels something sour in his gut. He doesn’t want bitter. He wants angry. He wants Dean to pry him apart.
Dean gets a lot of handjobs, a lot of blowjobs, he fucks Cas's thighs. Cas kisses him while he jerks off under his watchful gaze. Cas talks him through fingering himself, through fucking himself with any one of their dildos. Sometimes Cas strokes his cock lazily while he watches Dean, sometimes he just watches and tells Dean he’s good, or a slut, or beautiful or a bit of all of them. He's never been in a relationship with this much variety before.
"Fuck, fuck, Cas," he gasps and Cas sucks him down deeper fingers working him through his orgasm. The sound he makes is ruined, broken open in a way he only is after getting fucked like that. Dean gasps with him, then relaxes again on the floor, still achingly hard, as his future self collapses onto the bed. Dean's heart is racing like he's the one who got his dick sucked.
Curled up with Cas on the couch Dean takes a break from the work he hasn’t been doing to fuck around on his phone a bit. He texts Charlie, texts Sam, who’s in California and blocks Dean’s number and unblocks him again at least once a week. Eventually, he retrieves his laptop and starts researching for that project that's due next week. Cas is warm and heavy over his legs.
Dean just shakes his head and settles on one of the tables, feet set on the bench, legs spread wide. He's still wearing the absurd rain jacket.
Dean kisses him. Like the slap, it’s hard and stinging where Dean bites his lip and moves to suck a stinging mark into Cas’s neck, one hand holding his jaw tightly.  Cas revels in it, the harsh touch. Cas wants him angry. Wants Dean to cut him down to size and reshape him into a new animal, one that makes sense. The only time Cas knows himself is when Dean applies a harsh touch to the vulnerable skin of this limited form.
“I would not turn down the chance to sleep in a bed tonight, no matter how upset I might be with you.” Cas can’t see his expression in the dark but he hopes that hit landed.
“I dunno man. You take spiders outside instead of killing them. You cry at poems every week. You know so much shit, I still can’t believe you’ve never been to college. You sat outside with Lenora for an hour when she got upset last week. You’re weird as fuck. You’re always at work on time. You’re kind and hardworking and you’ve got this air around you, I dunno, earnest, serious, intense, I guess. You’re Steve.”
The shirt ends up on the floor, Cas kneels in front of Dean and in the shitty motel light he cleans the wound. He uses actual rubbing alcohol and not whiskey because Castiel, former angel of the lord, packs a first aid kit now, when they go on hunts. Dean’s glad for the sting of the alcohol and dull ache of the injury pulling him away from the tenderness with which Castiel bandages the wound.
For a while, they exist in silence. Dean finishes off the hamburger and crumples the wrapper into a ball. He throws it at the fast food bag. It lands right inside.
“Ahaha,” Dean says, pointing at Cas, “he’s a crack-up, this guy. But his sense of humor, it’s not for everyone.”
“I don’t spend my time thinking about the minute details of human reproduction. I forgot a female is required.”
There’s the tiniest hint of ‘Did I do something wrong?’ in Cas’s sharp eyes; not in a hurt way, just in a ‘Did we play this right?’, tactical way, the exact same way he’d look at Dean if he’d screwed up a move in a fight. (If that’s possible. Terrifying electric son of a bitch.)
It’s just, you know. Probably don’t want to be sucking face with a blood relative when you can avoid it.
“And we want to make sure that this tree’s holly-jolly energy blesses just the right family,” Mrs. Claus goes on.
Soon after Sam has finally gone silent, Dean comes back to Bobby’s toting white plastic convenience store bags in one hand and a fast food bag in the other.
“Oh yeah. I mean, Bobby’s been around sometimes, but for the most part, I was flying solo. I’ve nursed that kid through some doozies. You heard of chicken pox?”
That’s why, on this snowy night in Nowheresville, Pennsylvania, they’re hanging out in a Christmas tree lot, about to buy the first Christmas tree Dean’s had since he was in footie pajamas. And then scorch it straight to hell with the lighter they've infused with special evil-tree-killing magics. It's the most wonderful time of the year.
Dean sets the bags on the floor and pulls a hamburger out of the fast food bag, then leans against the wall. He looks at the hamburger for a moment -- because he isn’t hungry, because he thinks he is empty -- but then unwraps it anyway and takes a bite. Small rituals.
now. There are fragile little veins in his wrist, carrying blood back to his heart, to his lungs, evidence of the constant tide of blood coursing through his body.
“I can’t give you anything more,” Dean finally admits, because that’s it isn’t it? He has nothing else to offer Cas.
“Jack,” Cas stands, handing the peeled half eaten orange to Dean, who immediately takes a slice for himself. The two hug at the bottom of the stairs, then Jack comes over to hug Dean, then Sam. Dean hands him an orange slice.
“Yes. I have seen courthouse weddings and broomstick weddings and weddings where glasses are smashed and weddings where the bride is hidden from view until the last moment and weddings between men. I’m not sure I understand what a wedding is.”
“Think you can take it?” Cas asks. Dean swallows and presses down until he can feel the knot again, right there against his body. He can’t get far enough down to force it inside. He fucks down fruitlessly for a few minutes, panting, sweat prickling his back and gathering on his lip.
“Just stupid for you,” Cas repeats. They fall into easy silence until Cas mutters, “That’s starting to hurt.”
“I dunno. I am. Took a long time to realize that all this,” he gestures at himself “it helps but I just am.”
Dean hisses out a breath and nods his head frantically, trying to get himself back under control. Cas, the bastard, rocks down and clenches around Dean while he’s still trying to rein himself in, making Dean groan. Cas is so wet Dean can feel it dripping down his balls.
“I didn’t give you permission to move yet,” he warns and Dean’s dizzy with how bad he wants to start properly fucking. Cas takes his sweet fucking time putting the book down on the bedside table, well out of the way of any stray limbs. He strips off his shirt too, and his chest is glistening a little with sweat. Then finally, finally, he fucks down on Dean, who immediately eagerly thrust up hard, throwing Cas off balance. He catches himself on Dean’s chest, and uses the leverage to meet Dean’s thrusts.
“Dean,” Cas looks at him then, and Dean, as ever, is enraptured, “I love you. I cannot watch you break yourself into pieces because you still do not believe you deserve to live.”
The cover proclaims it a graphic novel. It's a story of a ghost and the man who loves him. In the back of Cas's mind he, notes the inaccuracies in the way the text represents hauntings and the afterlife. It doesn't take long to read but he reads it again when he's done. The drawings are so bright and the love between the men so gentle and patient. He aches for them and rejoices at their happy ending. He absorbs the book hungrily. He is in awe, always, of human minds and human hands.
Diran regards him for a long silent moment before turning back to his food. Cas has no idea what that look means.
“Can I look at you?” Cas asks, because he always asks, never assumes he’s welcome. It’s something they’re working on.
These days he doesn’t fuck with the lights off, using a shitty harness feeling like a deviant anymore. These days he fucks Cas with the lights on, in their own home with a garden and a kitchen set up to Dean’s preferences, on a night when Sam’s taking care of Jack and there’s no new tragedy to frantically prevent. There’s just this, thrusting into Cas, Cas groaning under him. Dean’s hand on Cas’s chest, keeping him close, pinching his nipples.
“Go to sleep, Dean.” Cas says quietly, into the darkness. Dean releases him. He's still not breathing steadily. Cas stands, begins to shuffle out of the room. He’s not wearing any shoes Dean realizes, which can’t be safe, walking a camp like this is in the dark barefoot.
His stomach, his belly, the organs under them. He can feel his organs working sometimes, hear them too. And certainly he hates the endless slog of it. Constantly need to feed himself only to do it again hours later, and water, and then needing pee and brush his teeth and wash his hands, and wash his body and figure out where he can do those things, when he doesn’t have a house or even a motel room to call his own.
"Hey, let's take a break!" Mick calls then pops down beside Cas, handing him a tissue. Cas wipes at his eyes.
“I wasn’t-- I thought angels were, y’know, junkless. Didn’t go for that gender stuff.” He’s stopped shuffling through the bag. He’s resting on his heels on the floor, half-turned, looking at Cas.
A few miles later, on the highway, Cas says, “Dean, I must confess, if you are hoping to have sex – with me – I’ve found I don’t particularly like it. I’m sorry to disappoint.”
He doesn’t complain as Cas rubs his lips against Dean’s thigh, nor when he wipes his fingers on the edge of the blanket, which makes Dean shudder in disgust.
for Cas, being still and patient and quiet waiting for Cas to take care of him. He feels small and held, especially when Cas drops a hand to his chest and rubs over his ribs, slow and soothing. He pinches Dean’s nipple and Dean whimpers quietly, trying so hard to be still.
In the absence of anything else to do, Cas sits on the floor beside Dean, holding his hand. He puts some music on his phone, low and almost entirely out of Dean’s range of hearing and just sits with him until Dean can breathe again.
“Here,” Dean hands him a joint and a lighter. Cas takes it, turning his face, revealing his tears. Something complicated crosses Dean’s face. He watches Cas trying to light the joint with shaking hands, and now the attention is humiliating, evidence of Cas’s ruin.
Part of Cas is amused at the image of tiny Mick ready to protect him from Dean at the drop of a hat. But the amusement fades as his breath catches in his chest.
“I think they called it spam stir fry,” Dean says doubtfully, flopping next to Cas on the bed. “There’s rice,” he adds helpfully, as if that makes it better. Cas takes the plate when it’s handed to him and eats without really tasting anything. Thank you weed for making most of camp Chitaqua’s terrible meals taste like nothing at all.
He wakes in the dark with Dean at his back. They aren’t quite touching but Cas can feel his warmth. The closeness makes him jittery. All the hurt from that first night wells up in his belly, a huge burning thing. Cas considers grabbing his bag and leaving the motel. He thinks about calling Mick to come pick him up and staying the night on their couch instead.
Poets like Rumi and Mary Oliver and Ocean Vuong get read. Cas reflects on the span of human history that he has witnessed, the poems through time. The poems of the Neanderthals that he loved so well, the epics of the Greeks, the poems of the Sufi's, the poems by the greatest poets who were never known by anyone but their mother and him, the terrible poems that were so earnest he could not help but love them.
“Oh,” Cas ponders that for a second, taking his time like Dean doesn’t have him pinned to the wall. “Sorry, but that doesn’t sound like me at all.”
The group is nothing like he expected. It's just a talk. A woman with bright red braids talks about her struggles in the workplace and everyone chips in offering support and advice. There’s talk of supportive parents, supportive parents, hormones, surgery, happy trans moments, moments of fear and crushing uncertainty.
“Hmm, I did,” he sounds inordinately pleased. He pumps his finger just once, then pulls out and leans down to kiss Dean’s belly. Dean swallows watching the top of Cas's head as he dips down and presses his lips to the curve of Dean's stomach. It’s soft and vulnerable and Dean’s never had a lover who kisses his belly after fucking him. He’s never had a lover who kissed his belly at all.
He palms himself through his jeans. He’s not really hard, just taking interest as he thinks back to last weekend. They’d gone on a date to university gardens and stopped in Cas’s office on the way back to pick up some books, only to end up fucking in the bathroom like animals. It was the nice and clean gender neutral staff bathroom tucked in an odd corner of the building, hardly ever used. Dean had gotten on his knees for Cas, sucked his cock with Cas’s jeans around his thighs until Cas was shaking and coming on his tongue. Cas had returned the favor by finger fucking him mercilessly with a hand pressed over his mouth, using the lube he carried in his backpack at all times like a freak--not that Dean was complaining.
“Heya, kiddo. Not feeling good, huh? C’mon, let’s get you settled in,” he coos to her and Cas follows behind, helpless to resist the chance to be near Dean.
“Here, get your fingers wet” he pulls out, making Cas groan in displeasure. Cas pumps his fingers a few times, getting them nice and slick. Dean thrusts back in impatiently when he’s done. Cas rubs his dick and meets Dean’s thrusts urgently. The cabin is full of the sound of skin on skin and Cas’s moans as Dean pushes him closer and closer to the edge. For all Dean likes Cas to himself, he’s never once minded fucking him in a cabin with no door where anyone can hear.
This is new too. Dean's used to thinking he needs to fuck to be close to someone. He wasted so long thinking the only touch he was allowed to have was the kind that led to orgasm. But Cas is all over him all the time, cuddling while they study, running a hand across his back as they pass in the kitchen, hip checking him in the bathroom, washing his hair in the shower. Cas teaches him that actually, sometimes he doesn't even want sex, just someone to hold him.
"Rain coat off," he waves at Dean. Dean compiles, handing it over for Cas to toss in the direction of his shirt and jeans, but leaves on the wet jeans to Cas's amusement.
“Dean, Dean,” Cas is groaning out. Dean answers by speeding up, sucking harder as Cas slips closer to orgasm under him.
There’s no idle cock warming this time, no playing with his hair. Cas holds his head and fucks into Dean’s mouth roughly, pulling his hair, and Dean’s hole is throbbing around the knot. He doesn’t rub his dick, just presses down with one hand, holding onto Cas’s hip with the other. He lets Cas take him.
"On," he answers but tugs it up and Dean kisses him, kisses his chest, his stomach, his hip bones, he brushes his fingers over Cas's sides and Cas jumps like he's been shocked. Dean's never been with someone so sensitive before.
Dean settles between them. Kisses the tender skin of Cas's thighs, the sensitive skin at the place where leg meets pelvis. He breathes Cas in and Cas squirms when Dean sighs against him.
Once Dean has the condom and lube ready, he circles Cas's hole. Cas inhales sharply above him so Dean laps at his cock. Cas gasps when Dean slips a finger inside. He gives him a moment to adjust, licking at his cock as he relaxes. Dean pumps his finger slowly in and out. Eventually, Cas starts letting out shuddery little noises of pleasure that just make Dean work harder to make him come, eager for Cas to fall apart, eager to be good for him.
“They don’t know,” he stops to bite at Cas’s collarbone, “That I had you first. That you were mine first,” he sucks a nipple into his mouth briefly, flicking his tongue over it. Cas whines at the sensation, enjoying the cool when Dean’s mouth leaves his nipple wet and hard.
Then Dean pulls down his underwear to the tops of his thighs and slides two fingers inside. Cas grunts at the sudden stimulation. Dean doesn’t give him much time to adjust and he’s still wet and sensitive from the earlier fucking. He gasps when Dean pumps his fingers. Dean’s surprisingly gentle, given Cas’s cheek is still hot from the earlier slap. It’s a nice easy indulgent rhythm and occasionally Dean presses his thumb to Cas’s ass, to the furled hole there, and rubs slightly, just to tease Cas. It’s so easy it’s almost playful. He hums and enjoys the leisurely fucking.
“So you want a committed friendship?” Cas asks and Dean cringes. Sounds fucking stupid out loud. He soldiers through.
Inside, Cas collapses on the bed in a wet heap. Dean ignores him, wandering deeper into the cabin. Cas sighs and gets up to find a towel. Now that he’s inside, the chill is setting in.
Cas fucks him like that, pumping the knot almost all the way out only to press it in. It’s intense. Dean’s back is arched as he pants to the ceiling and works his cock furiously as Cas finally painfully takes him apart. The pleasure is so bright he’s tearing up all over again.
“Just like that. Give me another finger,” Cas sighs and Dean makes sure to fuck him steadily like that, fingers angled just so to make Cas fall apart.
“Easy,” Dean murmurs and tugs the panties down, finally taking the dildo in hand and fucking him properly. He’s pumping into Cas fast and brutal and Cas is near tears as Dean mercilessly fucks him towards orgasm.
Dean grabs at Cas’s thigh whining high in his throat when the knot pops back in. Dean’s body welcomes it, sucks it in and clamps down hard. It fucking hurts. Dean could combust, burn out of his own body with how good it feels.
“Then why are you fucking telling me that you love me?” He is not about to cry he tells himself firmly.
Cas leaves early the next morning after poor sleep. He was worrying too much about where he would sleep tomorrow, where he would go. He's already discovered that jobs require things like driver's licenses and social security numbers and home addresses and all kinds of things Cas has never had need of before and has frankly no idea how to get. He had been planning to ask around at the shelter but he hadn't felt welcome to ask any questions when he woke in the morning. He left without speaking to anyone.
It’s Dean who asks to kiss him in the end. Sam’s off on a solo hunt and Cas spent the whole day researching greenhouses and sunlamps and moisture levels and a hundred other things that he told Dean and Jack about over dinner and Dean feels warm and fond and wants to kiss him. After dinner, Jack rushes off to his room with promises to wash the dishes after he finishes his game and leaves Dean and Cas with an easy silence.
And then, like the bastard he is, he pulls out and rubs over Cas’s dick again, finger wet and hot where it was inside him. Cas reaches back with his free hand to grab Dean’s ass and pull him tight against Cas. Dean grunts and slips two fingers into Cas, making him gasp.
“What you said last night. I was thinking about if I do want things from you, knowing how we both feel now. I want you to stop leaving,” he starts the car, easier to talk when he doesn’t have to look at Cas’s piercing eyes. “You have a home with us. I’m not going to ask you to leave but I want you to stay, if you want to.”
He sighs when he starts rocking against Dean and  Dean sucks in a deep breath, working to stay still. Cas fucks him like that, unbearably slow and measured, hot and tight and designed to make Dean lose his mind. He wants to grab Cas’s hips and tug him into a more satisfying rhythm. But this is worth it, in its own way, his head spins a little with how hungry he is for it, how hard he is from the denial, how good it will feel when Cas starts fucking him properly.
I am about to agree but then some weird thing happens. My taste is telling me to crave something different. I puzzle, trying to figure out what I want. It is still sweet but something different.
I sign, “Okay, um. Destiel came in to find Uncle Cas and I stared into each other. Then she made breakfast for everyone. Yes, she made Uncle Cas breakfast too.
I sign, “I just realized her mom needs our help with baking for the Book Club tonight. We gotta go. Nice meeting you.”
Both of our eyes look at the hazel eyes. His mouth shapes an ‘O’. He comes to an understanding that we both are deaf. Which is a relief, because it is fucking obvious that we are deaf. Hence the signing.
Sage and I jump into the air. The door opens in full swing. Aunt Eileen storms in with a gun. I repeat, my Aunt is holding a fucking gun. She aims all over the place as if she is trying to find the fly who touched her breakfast.
I have never met him, yes, but I do not want to meet him and get to know the man who has impregnated my dad to create the most complicated baby in history both Supernatural and Humanity. I mean, all of the times he has been such a dick to my dad and he took it mercilessly. That makes me pissed off.
I dream of flying through the clouds and I touch the clouds with my hands. I smile so big. I feel freeing and I never felt more liberated. The shadow exhibits that I am not alone so I look to the place where the shadow comes from. I smile so big because it is my dad. My dad looks at me and smiles big. We share that beautiful moment and I smirk.
He teases Cas, lapping at his cock, getting him wet, listening to Cas sigh and feeling him wriggle with impatience. He licks over Cas’s lips, teases his cock but then Cas grips his hair and says, “You promised me a blowjob.”
It’s loud when he walks in, full of unfamiliar people who don’t stare at him when he enters. Unsure what to do with himself and feeling awkward he  examines the paintings on the wall. The canvases are covered in shakey rainbows and glitter and flowers and awkward little figures. Each one has a name and age beside it. Alice 8, titled
"Steve!" he turns to find Diran there, smiling brightly at him. "So, happy you could make it. How are you doing? How's Nora treating you?"
Cas bought it for him. He’d measured the other dildos they had, meticulously making sure the one he got for Dean wasn’t too long, too thick and just the right texture. Dean’s reaping the benefits now.
“Pants off, on the bed,” Dean tells him. Cas pushes down the flicker of disappointment. He does so enjoy being on his knees.
He sleeps on the creaky wood floor in Dean’s cabin. It’s uncomfortable as hell. The floor smells of dirt and old wood. He’s got a spare pillow from somewhere but it’s ragged and the texture is awful. It comes from Cas’s cabin so he can only hope it's clean.
“See! This is what I’m talking about! The two of you bicker like you’re married!” Sam burst out and Dean can see what’s about to happen, just from Cas’s expression as he descends the stairs.
His future self does get up, but only to go out the back door, leaving the door open. Probably to wash up with the rain bucket, Dean thinks.
When he closes his book, Dean thrusts up into him eagerly. Cas twists a nipple hard in retaliation, making Dean cry out.
“Get up a second,” Dean tells him. Reluctantly, Cas pulls off. He’s surprised to see how wet he is, how wet he’s made Dean.
He thinks of it as he rings up people’s orders, and fixes the lights and talks to Nora. Does it mean something different that he is a man speaking to Nora? Does a man fix a lightbulb differently than a woman? Than a genderless angel? Is this still just his vessel? This vessel cannot be an accident, Jimmy worked hard to make this vessel into his own body. And Cas, well, he’d just rebuilt a man who built himself first, after his own image, and Cas felt a kinship. A kinship to Dean and Jimmy in turn.
Dean leans in again to kiss him. They go slow and lazy, without much heat but with a kind of clumsy passion and god Dean hasn’t kissed anyone like this since he was 17 and high and trying to get into Cindy Longenecker’s pants. He finds he likes it. He likes how they’re unhurried and there’s no clear goal other than enjoying each other.
In the background, the sky had been lit with his siblings falling, falling, falling. And he'd been yelling for Dean, trying to get his attention but he'd been yelling to his siblings too, yelling his apologies, his grief. Or maybe he'd been howling his grief at Dean who was going about his life, unaffected, too far away to hear Cas at all.
“If you don’t start fucking me right now I will smite you myself,” Cas threatens and it’s so unexpected Dean bursts out laughing. Cas is smiling too but also bucking against Dean, urging him on, arching his back. Dean finally obliges, pulling another garbled sound from Cas as he starts fucking him in earnest.
“Dean, everything I have done in the past few years has been for you, misguided and stupid as much of it was, it was for you. For love of you. Do no call that nothing.”
With no preamble, he lowers himself slowly onto Dean. Usually, Cas likes a lot of foreplay, likes to be hard and wet and hungry for it. He likes to tease Dean, grind against him until Dean is ready to beg for it. He knows it probably stings a little, to take Dean with no wind up. He stays very still, watching Cas’s face screw up and relax again as he takes Dean.
Dean smiles even brighter and pulls Cas close, enjoying the heat of the other man’s body against his.
Dean pushes Cas back onto the bed, leans over him, and kisses him hard. Cas totally ruins it by smiling into the kiss. Dean has to pull away. He smiles back at Cas, and really, when was the last time, before Cas, that Dean had to stop kissing someone to smile.
"Let me know if you change your mind," is all the warning Dean gets before Cas straddles him, takes his face between his hands, and fuck his hands are so big, and kisses him.
Finally, he gasps, “Dean, Dean please please, I can’t--I need,” he’s close to orgasm, close to shattering.
However, here freshly human in a communal shower in a shelter, Cas is vividly aware that his naked body is being stared at. He doesn't understand shame, not really, but he wonders in the burning sick feeling in his throat is something like it.
Cas is beautiful like this, groaning and gasping in turn. Dean works him up until Cas is grinding against his face, holding his head in place, riding his face just the way Dean likes.
“I’m too tired for this. Can we please – We have a six hour drive tomorrow to talk this over. Can we please sleep now?”
Cas doesn’t mind the smell of rain but he won’t deny the pleasure of warm water after the chill of rain.
He keeps cataloguing himself. The thicker hair on his thighs, how sensitive his scalp is, the rough stubble on his face. He’s shaved but he’s never taken the time to really feel what his facial hair is like under his fingers. He takes a long minute touching it, lost in the scrape of it against his palm.
because Dean gets off on danger and Cas gets off on Dean. He slips a hand into his pants, grasps his dick through his boxers.
Dean pads back into the room, the bed creaks, and he says, “Here,” as presses a damp towel to Cas’s face.
Cas doesn't argue, doesn't say anything at all. He can't explain that he can't ask for help. He cannot ask a small human with a partner and a cat and a garden with no knowledge of the supernatural to help protect him from the wrath of his family. He cannot do such a thing to their lives.
And part of Dean wants this, not this exactly, watching his future self get a blow job from this Cas, who is somehow even more unsettling than his own Cas, but he wants to know. He wants to see what might happen, how this will play out. Dean remembers once, peeking into Pastor Jim’s son’s bathroom while he was shaving. He just wanted to see an unguarded moment, to see the way another man’s body moved when no one was watching. He feels a little like that now, except he's watching himself and his dick has taken interest in the proceedings too, as he watches Cas work over Dean’s thighs before licking a stripe up Dean’s cock.
He looks fond as he says it. Cas thinks, how strange, to gather weekly to cry together. He thinks, how beautiful, to gather weekly to cry together.
Mick, a tiny dark haired guy across the room from Cas steps up to answer."How do you want to be nonbinary? I mean, look there's no rules, even if you were binary, you are the one who gets to decide what that means. You know, I really struggled with the idea of being a guy, of being part of a group of people who had visited so much violence upon me, sorry I know this isn't relevant to you--"
It leaves him feeling flayed. He lays there, feeling stunned, sweating, still catching his breath. Cas is running a hand over his side and down his thigh and over his chest, coming to cradle the back of his head reassuringly.
The branching tree of history and language and reading and moments like this that have happened over and over throughout history that bring humans back, again and again to this place, sharing the music of the mouth.
He can tell Cas is getting close, the way he’s gasping out in bliss, the movement of his arm, the flush high up on his cheek. Dean drapes himself against Cas’s back fucking into him quick and hard, just like Cas likes until he’s crying out.
That evening, as he's preparing for bed someone calls, "Hey, Steve? Steve!" It takes him a moment to remember that's his name now. He looks up to find Marlene, the woman who helped him sign into the shelter.
Somehow, it’s Cas who breaks first, tightening around Dean and throwing his head back. He drags Dean along with him, pulsing around him and Dean, with his head tucked into Cas’s neck, cries out as he finally cums.
Crossroads holds weekly meetings for trans adults. Cas is usually working or too tired to bother going. But, one day Marin texts him before the meeting and he decides to drag his tired body downtown.
IIt takes some fumbling and Cas helps guide his cock home but then he’s flush against Cas’s ass. He grabs Cas’s hand, laces their fingers together and presses lingering kisses to the back of his neck as Cas adjusts.
He swings a leg over Dean’s lap. He wants to be Dean’s. What Dean doesn’t understand is Cas is already his. Dean never remade Cas’s body, he never will, but Cas is transformed by Dean all the same. Cas became human for Dean. More than that, Dean made him become, even back then when he was still an angel, before he was falling, Dean was forcing him to become. Every part of who Cas is today has been touched by Dean.
