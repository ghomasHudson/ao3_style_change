Steve had those absolutely gorgeous blue eyes fixed on Tony, and it felt like Steve was seeing right through him. Like if Steve kept looking at him like that, Steve would see how desperately Tony wanted to close the distance between them and kiss him until the room spun. And if Tony didn’t think of something quick, he might do exactly that.
“Maybe,” says Clint with a shrug. “Ok, not bad for an educated guess. We can keep our eye out for an evil-looking TV.”
You take a moment to choose your words and then say, “Thor, if I wanted to cast a fire spell, could I do it with a bottle of water?”
Den I went out were Stev an Tony were waiting. loki waiting too was playing Helena on speakers (that was wour song bcuz we made out the first time lisning 2 it) & he sad “IM SO SORY I PROMISE I OVE ONLY UUUUUUU!!!”
The afternoon had been going so well. They’d talked sci-fi and architecture and hadn’t so much as said an unkind word to each other for over an hour, which had to be some kind of record for them. Initially Steve had wanted to see if it was possible for Tony to talk himself out, but it turns out when you let a genius talk about whatever he likes, you end up getting to learn a lot of really interesting stuff. And Tony hadn’t used the opportunity to take any potshots at Steve. He could have, especially when Steve decided to risk asking him a few clarifying questions, but Tony hadn’t rolled his eyes or denigrated Steve’s education or whatever other creative insults he could’ve come up with. Instead he’d answered Steve’s questions and expounded on the things Steve seemed interested in and generally behaved like they were having a normal conversation. They were starting their way up the ramp in the museum when Steve realized he was
“I can’t decide whether I mean that literally. You would either have been best friends or burned the place down, you’re so alike.”
"Gogglor, I think Thor Odinson is a little more complicated than an over-grown golden retriever" fair cop, but he is also a little bit of an overgrown golden retriever, at least in my heart.
the other day featuring Doug Ridloff, one of the main organizers of ASL Slam in NYC (and a very gifted poet himself), talking about it, and it has some clips of an ASL Slam at Nuyoricans.
“Spar? I thought we agreed sparring with the other guy was exclusively a middle-of-nowhere activity after what happened last time with the hammer and the donut shop,” you say.
“Interrupt sleep, done,” said Tony, whose brain was already coming up with a million projects he could plausibly work on with Steve. “Got to go, thanks Pep!”
Steve nodded and said, “The whole plan as you’ve laid it out for me is hinging on this. You’re sure it’ll work?”
A Seuss-ified version of Avengers tower, but in purple. There's a target on one side with arrows sticking out, a disco ball, and a bird cage dangling from the roof.
Tony kissed Steve gently, but with purpose. It was ginger and it was halting and it wasn’t very refined, but it was real, and that made it perfect. He tried to put a lot of things he couldn’t bring himself to say in the kiss.
I was referring to everything that’s happened before this whole spell business, but now I want to know what happened on Nat’s floor too.
“Because she was using another trick on both of us to get what she wanted,” said Tony, “strategically breaking social mores.”
“JARVIS, call the elevator,” said Tony, because he wasn’t sure he had it in him to so much as press a button right now.
"Why are you here Tony?" Steve asks in a tiny voice, before he finds the courage to look Tony in the eye. "We don't have to do this right now. Or ever. Tomorrow's a big-"
is that? Hmm? What is this, Cap? Do you like me? Is this just physical? Because two days ago you nearly benched me from tomorrow's mission citing "high risk of insubordination". That was after a yelling match between us and I nearly gave myself an aneurism just trying to get through to you. You can't stand me, I can't stand you. Now we're sucking face."
"Beauty and The Beast." Steve looks up to Tony who was rocking on his heels now, looking unsure. "I like Beauty and The Beast. Disney." He blue eyed man says nothing. "You know the soundtrack? The Celine Dion one? Love it. It reminds me of you. Of us. Of how we started off and where we are today."
. Gosh he spelled my name with a Z! That makes me so much cooler, Jake, thank you,” Steve says, a palm across his ridiculously sculptured chest. “
"I wanted to ask you if you'd come with me to the Mental Health Foundation Charity gala. It happens in a week from Thursday. I checked with JARVIS and he said your uh schedule's free. I know this is short notice but I figured I'd just ask anyway."
"I was in Japan, remember? Nat told me we don't have these flavours over here so I, uh I got you a whole bunch. There's strawberry, wasabi, red bean.." Steve says as he emerges with more bars of chocolate in his hand, holding them up like a fan over his face with only his eyes visible.
He hovers patiently by the entrance, enjoying the view until the genius finally rolls out from under the car and notices him. Steve makes a tiny hand wave.
Then, one Tuesday afternoon, Steve just showed up at Tony's workshop unannounced with a box of letters in hand. With his head hung over his broad shoulders, he asked if he could come in, promising that he wouldn't be a bother. "I just don't want to be alone right now," Steve whispered that day. Tony had a million questions running through his mind that day but he held his tongue, and made a spot for Steve on the carpet.
"No, no no no, you're not the problem, Tony. I'm .. sorry, I'm the one not making any sense. I'm just a little floored right now, that's all."
“-demons to fight? Exactly why you don’t have to feel like this is a hardship for me. I can almost assure you each and every one of those people downstairs are equally ready to be here for you, because we're all damaged in a lotta ways. Look at Barton. The man lives and breathes mischief and sunshine but deep down, he's barely pulling it through if it wasn't for Romanoff. We all need someone, Steve. It doesn't have to be me, but I'm more than happy to stick around for you."
The reformed playboy sighs. "No offence, but who Tony Stark shows up with to blitz and glitz galas is old news. I have a less than stellar reputation. I'm known to chase skirts, anyone with a pulse really. Of course I'm working on correcting that perception. Who Captain America takes as his plus one, on the other hand...." Tony trails off. When Steve frowns to protest, Tony holds up a hand to stop him.
"Wow you look .." Tony cuts himself mid-sentence as he scans Steve from top to bottom, all clean and preppy with his hair combed neatly, his goofy smile spread wildly across his handsome face. This makes Tony realise that he was covered in grease and motor oil, in yesterday's clothes. Tony starts to dust his dirty jeans in a sad attempt to rival the beautiful man before him, a finger catching on the rip on his knees (Steve could never tell if the tear was intentional because for a man who could afford anything, Tony's jeans were always pulled and tattered).
"Kit-Kat?" Tony says, genuinely surprised. He plucks it out of Steve's hand to examine it. "Green tea. Huh. Where'd you get this?"
"I would rate this mission as a success, Captain. Mr. Stark is currently singing along to one of his favourite songs while he shuts down his workstation. He has requested for me to run a bath for him, and to ensure brand new sheets are put in place in the master bedroom, amongst other necessities."
Steve snorts, but Tony could feel him take a whiff of him right by his neck. It was almost as though Steve was scenting him. It’s a good thing that he decided to take a shower before he took the jet back from Malibu. Anytime now, Steve could just back off. But he doesn’t. They stay that way in what felt like an eternity of bliss, Steve’s chest almost plastered on Tony’s back, his hands on Tony’s forearms. Taking a chance, Tony leans back and looks up to Steve, wiggling his eyebrows to keep the moment playful and not full on sexual.
Steve looks at his half eaten chocolate bar and back to Tony. He hesitates before he does what he's told - he breaks one bar and bites into it. Carefully, with his eyes locked on Tony's, "Have I restored order in the universe yet?" Steve asks..
What had happened was trickling into Steve's head, it came in a misty blur that slowly began to show its form; one second they were casually discussing tomorrow's mission while popping dumplings into their mouths, the next he was leaning into a kiss and pressing Tony against the dining table, the man he had been in love with for the past aching months. When Tony wrapped his hands around Steve's shoulders and ran his fingers through Steve's hair to push deeper into the kiss, Steve lost all his inhibitions.
"Salright. No harm done. But you're visibly tired, Tony. You've been binge-working again while I was gone?"
, and he didn't want to embarrass himself further. So he doesn't answer. He simply tucks his face to the crook of Tony's neck, lightly pressing his lips against the hot skin. Helpless and stupidly in love, and now that it's stamped and certified that Tony was somewhat on the same page, Steve wasn't hiding how giddy he was with happiness.
Steve bit his lip to contain his growing smile, but truthfully to keep his mouth from watering. Almost like the universe was really backing him on this, the song goes on to assure him.
When no immediate response was forthcoming, Steve puts on his leather jacket and pulls over his helmet before he starts the bike. His visor, which acts like a HUD courtesy of Tony, flashes the traffic news, weather forecast and surprisingly, a new voice message.
He inhales deeply and blows out a heavy breath, hoping to flush out the butterflies in his flat stomach.
As for Tony, well, the workshop was his man cave and known to all other occupants of the Tower to be off limits, only opening his doors to by appoint-only consultations. Yet Tony made an exception for the super soldier; he was more than happy to welcome Steve in, so much so the certified genius gave the captain his own code that grants him access at any given time. Even when Tony was elbow deep in something (creating, designing, obsessing over an chemical equation), he'd never miss to spare a moment or two with Steve before going back to his work and leaving the man to his own devices in a corner of the shared space.
"You try this one and let me know if it's going to Barton," Tony says, handing Steve the pudding-flavoured one while he glances at the one in his hand. He grimaces at red bean, remembering how much he disliked the taste. But this is for science.
Steve laughs. At that exact moment, he feels his phone vibrate. Fishing the device out, he sees that JARVIS has sent him the link to the song Tony must be rocking out to.
Steve couldn't help but frown, feeling a little insulted. "That's unfair. Look, Tony, if you're having a change of heart after all that, I'll respect your decision. I'll back off. But forgive me if I got carried away from the way you were ripping my shirt off." Steve glances down at himself; his belt buckle was unlatched and his zipper was pulled all the way down. He purposely made a show of correcting his pants, before meeting Tony's eye again. Just to emphasise his point.
- checked on him? I can always make him another sandwich. But don’t tell him I’m asking. But don’t lie on my account? Just, you know, like the last time –“
The next twenty minutes was spent on the carpet by the sofa, with Tony having a zipper bag filled with ice wrapped with a towel pressed to his nose as his head tilts and rests on the sofa seat. Steve initially hovered nervously over him, but finally settled next to him while he hugs his knees, legs crossed. At some point Steve had to stop apologising, because Tony stopped responding. In fact he had gone completely quiet having writhed in pain for a good few minutes.
"Honey, I'm fine," Tony assures with a smile. There was a small bruise just above his left cheekbone and Steve was dying to kiss it better.
Steve was someone who looked like he genuinely did enjoy Tony's company, all of it, and didn't have a problem of showing it.
want to do was kiss Steve on the lips, dirtily and hungrily, right there in the middle of the kitchen, ravish the man until they're both breathless.
Despite saying that he would let it go, from time to time the archer would bring the topic back up, sometimes even through comms during missions to redirect everyone's focus to Tony's increasingly frequent displays of favouritism towards Steve. The Captain was quick to shut down chatter through comms, but Tony was pleased to note that never once did Steve deny that they
"Something for you to look forward to," Tony says, caressing Steve's cheek softly. He takes a step back, allowing Steve to get on with his day. He stays by the elevator and waves until the doors close on them.
The picture was of himself and Tony, with his arm draped casually behind the brunette's back firmly. Tony had the biggest smile on his face as Steve whispered something in his ear. The shot was entirely candid, taken by Clint from afar. The duo don't have a lot of pictures together, of just themselves, so this one easily makes it a favourite. So much so that Steve quietly had it framed and perched next to his bed.
"Yeah but not before I found out that you're actually a pain in the ass sass queen beneath the pretty face! But now, after getting to know you, the real you? You. Are. Beautiful. Every inch of you. Even if you break every law there is known to mankind for chomping on KitKat without breaking the bars."
His memory and his legacy are truly a blessing, and I hope others carry it on by following his example and making space for its artists to shine.
HAROLD's hands are against the wall, and THOR is down on one knee behind him, patting down the bottom of HAROLD's pant leg by his ankle. HAROLD is whining miscellaneous phrases about the impropriety of it and asking how soon he can get back to drinking. Upon hearing the gunshot, THOR stops and looks out the door. HAROLD takes advantage of the distraction and kicks THOR’s face with his foot still wearing a shoe. The kick catches THOR off-guard and he’s temporarily knocked back.
“I hate this fucking disease,” said Tony bitterly, as he clenched his hand around the roots again. “I hate that it never goes away. I hate that just when I thought I’d gotten rid of all my damn doubts and we could finally put my bullshit behind us, all it takes is you going on a mission for three weeks to set me back this badly.”
Steve’s smile lit up the back of the car and he said, “Are you sure about that? It’s only been a minute.”
Inside are various blue barrels and boxes full of materials. CAPTAIN ROGERS looks up and sees a 21st century smartphone sitting on top of one of the barrels. He tries to get up to go for it, but CAPTAIN AMORA grabs his heel. They continue to tussle, but then the ship takes another hard hit. In fact, it hits so hard that the edges of the room begin to dissolve into green energy.
“Most chap stick has lanolin in it, Steve,” said Tony, and even though his lips were uncomfortably hot at the moment, he couldn’t help tugging them into a smirk.
“If you weren’t overthinking you’d be going back to sleep, starting your day, or making a move. You’re doing none of those things, which means you’re overthinking.”
Tony turned his head to scowl good-naturedly at Clint, who was kneeling down to cut Tony’s restraints.
They were at the top of the landing now, and Clint came up behind Steve and Thor and clapped a hand on both of their shoulders.
“We’re saying things even if we’re scared what the other one thinks, remember? What’s on your mind, gumdrop?”
“But that’s a big if. I don’t know if I’m ever going to get to ‘yes’ either. But sometimes I look at you and I think the same thing: maybe. Maybe with you.”
Mmy name is Natasha Nigtshade Blood’ness Vampira Way Romanov an I am a goth fampire and I hav a hot boyfriend & we r in luuuurrrrvvvvv
because of you. The death, the destruction, the devastation — all set in motion because you wanted hot sauce on your damned sandwich.
Hammer stood up and picked up a stress ball on his desk and began tossing it from hand to hand as he walked over toward the enormous portrait of himself, both of them now looking down at Steve.
” spat Tony as he walked forward into the fight against his will, completely at the mercy of whatever kind of puppet magic emo Ariel had fired at him. Steve turned at Tony’s outburst and didn’t quite stifle a groan of frustration.
“You know, before the night’s over, you and I really should talk about coordinating an event in New York City. Either a fundraiser for some of the bigwigs here, or maybe something for the guys in the shelter.”
Yeah, I’d love to add how badly I want to shove you against a wall and lick that arrogant smirk right off your face, but I guess that’s not important right now.
“Jarvis, prep Dummy with the hose. Outside on the launch pad this time, I don’t want him hosing down my electronics again. And the second we’re done here I’m bricking myself into the lab with a cask of Amontillado,” he grumbled.
“That’ll be two hundred and forty nine dollars,” said the bored-looking teenager with chipped yellow nail polish.
“Wouldn’t have had to worry if you’d showered with me,” said Tony with a suggestive quirk to his eyebrows.
Steve stopped. Because he realized he knew Tony better than this. Tony didn’t pick fights unless he had a goal to accomplish or a point to prove and Steve had already conceded the play was bad and they shouldn’t have come, so why was he picking this one? He seemed pretty determined to get Steve to say out loud that he knew Tony didn’t like the play because they knew each other well enough by now to—
“You always have weird conversations whenever you do the grocery shopping. Remember that woman who asked if you met Elvis when we fought the chitauri?” said Tony. He was peeling potatoes in the sink, because that was the extent of his cooking abilities, and everyone had insisted he had to be in the tower cooking rotation
“I guess,” said Tony, who then looked around and added, “Alright, I’ll park my butt by the octopus, and you can—”
Tony blinked as if taken aback, then finally looked Steve in the eye when he said, “That’s more than once a week.”
“I never read anything about your mom being a playboy billionaire philanthropist superhero,” said Tony.
...but you and your fellow warriors also served my second goal marvelously: to test a new application of magic. Now that I know this artifact’s power compounds itself the more minds are concentrated on the same purpose within it, I know I just need to place it somewhere crowded with minds intent on the same thing. I believe your Grand Central Station at rush hour will do nicely. And when that’s done, its power will grow enough for me to expand its boundary. As it takes in more minds and grows in potency and range, it’ll only be a matter of moments before the entire planet is trapped in a story. And if I happen to choose a setting where I’m a beloved despot for this planet and everyone’s intent is to worship me, well… it sounds like a great story to me.
A small grin quirked the edge of Tony’s mouth and he said, “You wouldn’t be the Steve Rogers I know and love if you did.”
“Nope! Too late to change, we’re writing your appearance off as ‘eccentric genius’ today,” said Pepper, not even breaking her stride.
“If you had to sneak something into Avengers tower, would you do it under the noses of the trained spies?” asks Clint. “Maybe it’s just my ego showing here, but I think Nat and I are probably the least likely to have something snuck into our pockets and the most likely to notice if something shows up on our floor that isn’t supposed to be there.”
," said Tony as he opened the door to a small, private room with benches lined along the wall, a ball made of mirrors in the ceiling, and a small stage at one end with a few microphones on it. “They
And so while they finished up strolling through the rest of the museum, Tony filled Steve in on everything there was to know about Medieval architecture. And Steve was more than happy to listen and just… bask. In the solemn, calming atmosphere of the Cloisters, in the intricate golds and bright blues and reds of the triptychs and stained glass windows. And in the sheer joy that was Tony, talking about something he liked.
On an ordinary day, Tony would’ve investigated it himself right away. He would’ve called the suit, dove down into the sewer, and
“Hi,” said Tony brightly, “Any chance we could have this conversation somewhere open with lots of witnesses? There’s a great Italian place maybe five blocks from here, and I haven’t eaten since this morning. My treat?”
Today I had the opportunity to meet some of the other sailors here. One, named Tony, looked at me with astonishment and said, “Butterfingers?” We must have met at The Emerald Witch over a pint some time ago, although he had the strangest things to say. “I forgot I left some of the bots on this floor to test their water-proofing. I guess this is anthropomorphic Butterfingers,” he said. You know my education stopped at learning my letters, but I’m sure you’ll make sense of what he said. We chatted for a bit about what brought us here upon The Avenger, but it wasn’t long until he and the other sailors retreated beneath the poop-deck, no doubt to go about their chores.
Steve looked like he wanted to dissolve into the floor, and as strong as the urge was to tell lewder and lewder jokes until Steve finally broke and started fighting with him, so both Steve
Steve clearly had something he wanted to say on the tip of his tongue but Tony could feel him pause, reconsider, and then say, “I’m not angry with you. Not at all. And this isn’t an obligation, Tony. You’re my friend. Friends tell each other about their day, and I genuinely want to hear about yours.”
“Oh,” said Tony, relief washing through him. “Yeah, I’d forgotten how much dating sucks. I’m sorry, Steve, I’ll stop setting you up.”
“Whoever’s puppeting me is a lefty, all left hooks and left kicks. But she’s got a watch on her left wrist, which means—”
"We've made a mistake," said the one who's called Thor, "We need to go higher, above clint's own floor. Our Clint is a friend who enjoys being high. We need to search higher, clear up to the sky!"
They were leaving at intermission. Steve had been more than ready to laugh off a poor recommendation on the list with Tony on the way out the door, but Tony was doing some kind of extended joke pretending he loved it and wanted to see the second half of the show, just to rub it in Steve’s face how wrong he’d been on insisting they come. And if it had ever been funny when it started, it definitely wasn’t now as they were walking up the block away from the theater.
Italian food is one of my favorite cuisines that I’ve discovered since I’ve come to Midgard, and the Foster family recipe book is a huge part of that. Jane’s family on her mother’s side is Italian (actually Sicilian — I’ve been told the distinction is important!). Her great-great-grandparents immigrated to America at the start of the twentieth century and settled in an Italian neighborhood outside of Philadelphia, and they've been passing down delicious recipes incorporating the taste of the old world with the available ingredients of the new world over five generations.
“Better get to your point fast, detective, we’re running out of time,” said Clint uneasily as he eyed a few wisps of green swirling outside the window.
“Oh that? Don’t worry about it - normal couples also have to cover finances, how we manage our families, and sexual compatibility, but being a billionaire takes care of the first one, we don’t have the second, and the third is self-explanatory.”
“What? That’s impossible,” said the guard. “Even if she got past us, we get notified if the vault opens—”
Tony took a deep, shaky breath and stood up with his hands over his head. The group of onlookers gave an amused titter now that the view of Tony’s genitals was unobstructed by the water, and Tony couldn’t stop himself from saying, “Oh
The ship takes a rough hit. Sparks fly from the ceiling and detritus spills out of a panel on the wall.
in your hand and leave you to figure it out, so is it really so weird that some people want to go online and talk about themselves in whatever they’re reading? And yeah, it’s not exactly Shakespeare, but you have to write a lot of garbage before you can learn to write well,” said Tony.
“The knockout dust I was stuffing in Clint’s arrows when I fell asleep at the workbench and just rolled my head in it, yeah. Ok. Wait, is that why I fell asleep at the workbench?”
“Someone snuck a magic artifact into the building and trapped all of us. But if you come with us you’ll be free of it,” says Natasha.
Tony picked up some bok choi between his chopsticks, stared pensively at it for a moment, before he said, “What if we get a cat for the tower and call it close enough?”
“I’m not so sure about that, Tony,” said Steve with a small smile. “Butterfingers and U make a lot of excuses to hang out together while they’re in the lab.”
“Pretty sure once we leave this room we’re about to get mobbed by all our friends wishing us congratulations, Tony.”
The lights dimmed, and a stunningly beautiful woman with long wavy brown hair, bright red lipstick, and a slinky, floor length, green silk ball gown appeared next to Tony. You’d have to be dead not to stare.
And if that somehow always happened to be playing sous-chef to Steve, well, coincidences happen all the time.
“That’s enough, all of you,” said Steve. It wasn’t loud, but every syllable resonated with authority, and it was enough to bring instant silence to the elevator. Then Steve turned to Thor and said, “If you want to go off-world after we’re done here, none of us will stop you. You’re not a prisoner here. But if you’re making that decision because you think this world is better off without you, then I would ask if you feel the same way about us. You’ve saved each of our lives countless times out in the field, Thor. What we do is only possible because you’ve made sure we stayed alive to do it. And if you can’t think highly of your own actions, then at least I hope you don’t think so little of ours.”
“I never do business with people I can’t look in the eye,” said Hammer. “Either you step out of the suit and we negotiate this like businessmen, or we see which one’s stronger: the suit, or the scepter.”
Steve turned toward Tony and saw what looked like fight or flight on his face. But then it was replaced with something like resignation.
“Oh,” says Tony, who is now looking everywhere in the room except at you and shifting from foot to foot. “Um. Thank you.”
“I’m game to stay if you are, Steve,” said Tony. “But I believe our situation has just acquired a new wrinkle.”
“I’ll be considering all my options when I’ve finished my degree, Mr. Stark,” said Jasmine airily, before she turned to Natasha, and said, “I already know his order. What’s yours, Miss Romanov?”
“—it wasn’t my fault. Some knock-out dust I was packing into an arrowhead for Clint got out and did what knock-out dust does.”
Tony felt his head rise and fall as Steve’s chest expanded with a sigh and he carded his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Today was the two-year anniversary of the battle of New York. I don’t talk about it very much because the subject is rather painful, but every year on this day, it weighs heavily on my mind. It’s not every day one’s own brother does something that hurts so many people, several of whom I’m privileged to call my friends. Part of me hopes they can forgive me for not stopping Loki before he brought so much death and destruction to a planet I’ve come to think of as my second home. Part of me wonders if they even should. I had vowed that this planet was under my protection, and I failed. Can you forgive something like that?
“What the hell is that?” said Bob as he peered out of the opening of his workshop towards the direction of the music. The chorus of
“Then I’m afraid the heist cannot continue,” said Thor. “Or at least, we must find another way to proceed.”
Clint clapped Bruce on the shoulder and said, “Bruce, we’ve all been there: right at the precipice of being seduced by a tower floor. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“No, it’s fine,” said Colleen quickly, “I just— man, you could give Joey Chestnut a run for his money, y’know?”
“You’ll get your shirt back on Clint’s floor,” said Steve, as he pressed the appropriate elevator button.
“Someone was looking for you on the way in. Your wife’s in labor, and her calls aren’t getting through to you.”
They went back to making out for a while, but Steve broke away to ask something that was niggling at him.
“Handgun. Reliable, shot straight, easy to clean. I must’ve put in thousands of hours on the range with it. Thanks to that gun, I won enough shooting tournaments to pay for my mother’s medical bills. Saved her damn life.”
So they lapsed back into a tense silence for a while, with Bob typing away at his computer and Tony praying silently that the team would get here quickly, because the longer he stayed here, the longer he could feel the stench of the sewer ingraining itself in his pores. He’d need a heavy-duty spa treatment before he could feel clean after this.
suspicious. Fortunately, they’d reached the top of the stairs by then, and were now in the common room.
Tony turned and saw Pepper’s PA trying to shrink into the door frame. Because there is a God, she had a new hat in her hand. Because God is a dick, it was a neon green fedora with a peacock feather in the band.
Tony felt his way along the damp, cold, impenetrably dark sewer. He passed a few ladders up to the surface just to be sure he was sufficiently far removed from the original manhole cover, because if by some small chance there was yet another player in this Puppeteer bullshit, Tony did
You roll your eyes and say, “You remember I was there at that meeting where we brainstormed lies to tell Tony to get him out of his lab, right? You’re really going to use idea fourteen on me?”
“Honey, when you get home, I want you to google ‘demisexual.’ You got that? Need me to write it down?”
Tony stopped abruptly, then went back to looking at anything but Steve as he leaned back against the car and crossed his arms defensively.
The fight wasn’t hard to spot from the air. There were pink energy beams of some kind shooting out around where the John Lennon memorial was. Magic users sure knew how to put on a light show.
High crane shot view of the town. There’s the sound of a gunshot. Crows that had been roosting in the CLOCK TOWER all take flight. The shot echoes all around the valley, so it’s like we’re hearing it over and over again.
They were falling. Clint fired a grappling hook at one of the taller trees and that gave him the chance to swing towards Steve and throw him his shield, but all Tony could do was hit the ground face-down with a sickening thud. It hadn’t been a very high fall and the suit had shock absorbers, but it still hurt like a
Tony huffed and looked at his hands as he said, “I figured you could see from my behavior that it wasn’t my first Steve dream. But it’s ok, Steve, I know nothing’s ever going to happen here, and I really am ok with just being your friend.”
But there was no Clint on the top of the roof. There was no Clint standing there all aloof. And since they saw neither Clint's hide nor his hair, the friends bowed their heads and began to despair.
I heard Loki said at his trial that he lost his gambit for your planet because he didn’t have a Hulk. Well, I took his advice to heart...
I got it in my head to see how many quotes from The Rocky Horror Picture Show I could hide in this chapter and once I started I couldn't stop. See how many you can spot ;)
“How could I? Look at this—” said Tony, showing Steve his phone, “Five thousand idiots voted you had the better costume on my Twitter. Five thousand! You’re beating me twice over!”
Tony turned toward Steve, who was looking at him with his brave face on. Which meant he was terrified. Why was Steve terrified?
a distiller. Tony’s mental chemistry set was the only thing that kept the eight constantly running tracks of his brain from overwhelming and pissing off everyone around him. He’d spent his life tweaking and rearranging and perfecting it just like he did everything else he ever put effort into. The only reason why anyone said Tony “didn’t have a filter” was because they never got to see the sheer amount Tony
Three pages of comics. The first page shows an elevator door dinging open, revealing Steve kissing Tony's neck as Tony grabs onto his shirt and looks over his shoulder. Tony: "Um, Steve?" Steve: "Mm?" Tony: "Why is your room a comic strip?" There's two panels depicting Steve's quarters, one with a chair, a lamp, a rug, a view of the NYC skyline, and a cabinet with books on it and the shield resting in a stand, and the other a shot of a kitchen with a small island.
Very clever, using the elevator like that. I'll allow it, since I need to keep you busy somehow, and it won't help you in the end.
The elevator smoothed to a halt. Steve turned toward Tony and said, “What did you just say to me, Tony?”
Steve was still processing what Tony said and almost missed catching the door before it closed in his face.
Tony takes a look at his bud Steve, who is blushing, and says, “Yeah, tempting as it is to bone my own creation, I’m gonna to take a pass too.”
There’s also fanfiction about Steve boning everyone in this room. Solo and in an orgy. Artist renderings too.
“That answers my first question. Here’s my second,” said Natasha as she leaned forward. “Tony mentioned SI records indicate that Hammer has a StarkVault in the basement.”
“Mr. Hammer, there must be something else you want that you’d be willing to exchange for the scepter,” said Steve.
Pepper immediately sat up in bed, and stared intently through the camera on her phone directly at Tony.
“Steve, I swear to God, if you patch your suit with regular cotton thread one more time I’m going to tear you a new one and it won’t be in a place you can patch,” Tony groused as he stepped into the elevator after a particularly difficult robot fight around the tower (made more difficult by Tony’s helmet periodically filling with the flower petals he had been coughing up as he fought). He’d sent the armor to fly back on its own, but he’d decided to ride up the Avengers tower elevator with Steve because, yeah, he had it that bad.
“Male pattern baldness happens to pretty much everyone with a Y chromosome, Tony. You don’t have to resign yourself to hats for the rest of your life,” said Bruce gently.
“A for effort, Cap, but you can’t trick Hanahaki into thinking you have feelings that you don’t,” said Tony, not quite hiding the hurt in his voice. “Believe me, people’ve tried.”
“Yep!” said Tony in a way he hoped would cut off the discussion. He hadn’t eaten in 2 days and needed something more substantial than a green smoothie, but he was bitterly regretting not ordering something and having it sent up in the dumbwaiter instead of coming to the communal kitchen. Stupid body and its stupid, stupid hunger.
“The team went out to eat without us, actually. We’re only cooking for two tonight,” said Steve, and if Tony had any remaining doubts about whether Steve was asking him out, they disappeared when Steve’s hands migrated to his hips and pulled Tony back against him.
“Either you two need to start speaking out loud or we all start splitting up your PhD's so we can be in on the psychic conversation too,” said Clint.
Within moments Bruce was explaining the concept of a kick line to Thor as they locked arms on the little stage, but Nat went stiff. Clint walked over, put an arm around her shoulder, then started signing rapidly with one hand. And Steve tried to avert his eyes but even in his peripheral vision he could see what they were saying.
Jade’s hand on his lapel stayed put, and her other hand moved up to the side of Steve’s neck. Steve was pretty sure if he looked down, he’d see her her body was “pressing” against his. “And maybe when we’re finished talking about that event, we can talk about some… other things too.”
And Steve was kissing back with a lot of unsaid things of his own, enough that Tony could feel some of them. That he wanted this. That he wanted Tony to know that what had happened in the lab was worth it, if it led to this.
“Please enact manual override,” said Jarvis calmly, but loud enough to be audible over the non-stop loop of
May got consumed by more Avengers business. Some guy calling himself Dr. Doom showed up in London with a robot army, and he successfully took over the city for a bit. Ousting him took some careful planning, some creative application of Thor’s lightning, a lot of punches into solid metal, and then another couple of weeks of clean up and tracking down escaped Doom bots. But as soon as they finished and came back to New York, Tony had to fly to California for a few weeks of what he called “the annual corporate bullshit.” And Steve tried to throw himself into his work in Tony’s absence, but something had shifted in his life. The time he’d spent with Tony had felt so unbelievably
“Are you alright, Dr. Banner?” asked the tech who was with him, a twenty-something year old with long braids and green nail polish.
Pepper blinked, then turned to the PA who’d just handed her a blazer and said, “Find a hat. Any hat. Go.”
“When I get out of here I am going to kick your ass straight back to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob,” growled Tony.
“I’m not ready,” Thor muttered to himself as he paced. “I can’t do it. Everyone’s depending on me and I
,” said Tony as he started to lock down the cabinets in the food truck. “If I never see another acai berry again, it’ll be too soon.”
“A disgusting, mood-ruining setback,” said Tony, but some of the bitterness he’d been feeling was gone.
legs off in the vent,” said Tony. “Hang on, I’m getting a ping. Northwest corner. I’m on the right floor.”
“Natasha would cut her own legs off before she let one of us rescue her from being stuck in an air vent,” said Clint over the comms.
“True. There’s the potential there to pull a Stark Industries, start changing the world with technology. I’ve noticed the company’s been beefing up its agricultural tech division since you’ve come on. I’m guessing that’s at your suggestion, since it doesn’t compete in that field with SI, and Hammer’s too dumb to realize why that’s a smart move.”
And that's it! Thanks to all of you for the kind comments and for coming along on this wacky ride. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing (and coding, and photographing) it.
“Oh Tony,” drawled an all too familiar voice, followed by the twin clicks of the light switch turning on and a hammer coming back on a hand gun behind Tony’s head. “I’m not just on the scent. I’ve caught the fox.”
Then Tony started pulling on his collar for the five hundredth time that night and said, “How did you not choke to death in this thing?”
“Righty,” finished Steve, something like a smile curling the edge of his lips, even as he dodged another punch. “She has an accomplice.”
“New security measure, just got the prototype in this morning,” said Hammer. “Have the entire building searched. Tell the other guards we’re looking for the
Natasha opened her eyes and looked up. She very nearly burst out laughing at the sight of Steve and Tony standing over her wearing moody goth teenager costumes, but the laughter died in her throat when she realized she was wearing one too, and she didn’t remember putting it on. She wasn’t hungover, which meant… oh no.
“Vent crawling isn't as easy as it looks, huh?” said Clint, and she could hear the shit-eating grin through the comms.
Steve took Tony’s closed hand between his, kissed each of the knuckles, then opened it enough to pull out the roots he was holding. Without taking his eyes from Tony’s face, he tossed them over his shoulder and into the wastepaper basket.
“Well. You said that Steve and I should spend time together,” said Tony, desperately trying to stall.
Steve did. Tony put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, looked around conspiratorially, then said, “Are you listening? Ok, here it goes: sex… is
Steve turned to his side as if to pick something up and added, “Um… they told me to bring some clothes and shoes for you when I came to pick you up. Unless you want to… to keep wearing what you’re wearing.
“C’mon, Steve,” said Tony, who was somewhere between buzzed and drunk at the moment and was sure to progress to plastered before the night was through. “Y’can’t come to karaoke and not sing. It’s against the rules.”
But next year we’re throwing a party. In hindsight we probably set ourselves up for failure when we got a hotel room,” said Tony.
“Suit’s going to my private island off the coast of Australia. Can’t be called back from here. I’ll need to go get it myself.”
“Honestly, I kind of expect gold bullion to spill out of your pockets every time you take a step,” said Jasmine as she filled the cup.
“Steve, I’d like to introduce you to my date, Ms. Jade Islington. Jade runs an organization housing homeless vets.”
“But we are going, right?” said Clint. “I had JARVIS call ahead and get them to caption the movie, and I’m going to feel like a huge dick if they did that and I’m not there.”
because it's guarded by state-of-the-art StarkTech lasers and motion detectors that we also installed.
But before Steve could even panic, Tony was standing between him and the camera, striking a pose, then blowing kisses to the crowd. Then he turned around and shouted, “WHO WANTS A SMOOCH!?” to the area around them. And as soon as hands started shooting up, Tony was kissing everybody around them. Everyone in the stadium was cheering, except Steve, who was currently stewing in a combination of panic, relief, confusion, embarrassment, and a strong desire to get the hell out of there. And Doug and Colleen didn’t look too happy either.
Jane's family history is taken from my own. This recipe here is probably the way it is because meatloaf mix was cheaper and more readily available than ground veal when my great great grandmother came over to the United States. We've also had a family cannoli recipe for five generations that has 0 ricotta in it, because you couldn't get ricotta reliably back when they came to the states.
“I didn’t want paparazzi so I didn’t say exactly who we were, but I told them six sumo wrestlers were coming and they should prepare accordingly.”
“But that’s no basis for a healthy relationship with performing. And there’s no war bonds to sell here, Cap. Nobody’s gonna die if we suck, and thank God for that or else Thor alone would’ve killed half of Manhattan by now. We’re all looking a little bit stupid, because the return is getting to see our friends laugh and cheer us on. We’re making the feedback loop on our own terms. And at the very least, you get to see how little everyone here cares when you’re not perfect. So c’mon,” said Tony as he stood up and offered Steve his hand. “Wanna do something a little dumb so you and your friends can know each other a little better?”
, Tony. You’re the scarecrow— what was his name? Fiyero? Playboy changes his life when he starts trying to fight for what’s right, ring any bells?”
“No I don’t!” said Tony. “I just don’t drive with you! Do you think all those cars are for decoration? The only times I use a driver are if I’m socializing with a group of friends - like the Avengers - if I’m having a business meeting, or… or if I’m on a date!”
“Well done, detective,” said Steve as he dropped the phone to the ground and crushed it with the heel of his boot.
Tony tapped his tablet and in an instant, Sandra’s kind, professional smile was replaced by the face of a smarmy-looking businessman in a blue suit jacket.
Steve tried and loved every house soda they had, and then after they’d eaten their fill it was time to head over to
Natasha moved to get out of the back seat but before she could open the door, Sandra said, “You’re not gonna hurt anyone, are you?”
The viewscreen shows a Romulan bird of prey firing on THE AVENGER. CAPTAIN STEVE ROGERS shakes off the hit his ship just took from a photon torpedo. He takes in that he’s sitting in the captain’s chair on the BRIDGE and appears confused. With him are HELMSMAN CLINT BARTON, OPS AND SECURITY OFFICER THOR ODINSON, and COMMANDER NATASHA ROMANOV.
There was a moment of silence where everyone tried to figure out what to say to that, except Natasha, who nodded sagely.
Tony was quiet for a while, and when Steve looked over he could see he was back in that uncomfortable space in his head where he’d been earlier tonight when Steve had told him suck it up and enjoy the slam poetry.
“Sorry, Clint. Each additional PhD adds another inch to our colossal schlongs, and can’t be redistributed,” said Tony.
Thor sighed and said, “I can’t do it reliably. If the target were larger or not in such close proximity to so many taller, more conductive targets for a lightning strike, maybe, but like this? One in fifty times, maybe. Perhaps you could do something yourself? Maybe shoot a charge through your armor?”
Also, life hack: you can totally tell your dentist/doctor/whoever "I'm gonna need to take a few 30 second breaks" or  "I'd like to play some meditation music during my exam" or "I'm going to be playing with this fidget spinner as you go." If they're any good at what they do, they *want* you to be comfortable. You're not imposing if you ask for a quick breather between cleaning your top and bottom teeth.
Steve walked down the hall and to the left from Hammer’s office, just like they’d planned, doing his best to look as confused as he could before slipping into the small conference room with a sheet of paper taped to the door that said, “Nursing Room, Do Not Disturb.” Sandra was the only one who needed it so they’d have it to themselves, and apparently people had gotten oddly skittish about nursing since Steve had been on ice, enough that a whole private room was necessary in the first place. Steve had a recording of the pump in action and Sandra shouting “I’m busy, don’t come in!” to play by the door in case any guards stopped by later, to amplify the effect.
Sounds like he had a secret partner when Steve knew him, and Steve’s not a homewrecker. Also probably had scruples about sleeping with test subjects.
job. As soon as we’re done here she’ll probably have yours. Gina, activate the cleansweep protocol.”
Steve smirked. “I remember you liking it a lot when I met you in the common room earlier,” said Steve.
“No. Captor. Remember what I said about stereotypes? Usually they’ve got some kind of ancient charm with actual magic in it that throws off their look. All she’s got is the entire clearance rack at Spencer’s. I think she’s a puppet too.”
Bruce clearly had a thousand questions on the tip of his tongue, but one look at Tony’s face was enough to quiet them.
“Fuck!” spluttered Tony as he rubbed the back of his head. He was about to start cursing out Dummy for having fun with the fire extinguisher again when his hand felt smoothness on the side of his head.
“Do not test me, Stark,” grumbled Thor. “I’ve had a rather long and unproductive day, and you’re wearing something very conductive to electricity.”
“I don’t know, Steve. I know this works, right now. I love living with everyone here in the tower. I just… I can’t rule out that something’ll change one day. What if everyone else quits? What if the government tries to stop us from doing hero work? What if our ‘maybes’ turn into ‘yeses’ and it doesn’t work having a kid living here with the rest of the team, for us or for them? Or what if we just… want to do something else?”
“Don’t listen to Tony, he’s an idiot,” says Natasha. “The party’s for Coulson. Having Captain America show up to his birthday party has been his dream since he was five, and we figured we owed him one after the IKEA incident.”
“Don’t sound so broke up about it, honey. It’s not you, it’s me,” quipped Tony, who had somehow managed to summon a hot soldering iron from thin air and was already focusing intently on a circuit board on his work table.
the poor kid, for Christ’s sake! Aren’t you supposed to be some kind of genius? Any idiot could see he’s crazy about you. And we all thought you were just as crazy back, but apparently not if you’re still keeping up with this bullshit,” said Bruce.
Tony turned to run, but he immediately felt a familiar blast to his back. A moment later his limbs moved of their own volition, marching him back toward the manhole and Puppeteer number two.
“Fair point,” said Tony. “Anyway, Justin, thank you for proving, yet again, that you are so consistently unimaginative, we could risk handing over the thing we just stole, because we just
For a while no one said anything. Then Nat said, quietly, “That wasn’t your fault. Bruce knows how to recognize the signs, and if they were obvious enough for you to text me then he was ignoring them deliberately. I’m going to talk with him about this when he’s… done. But anything would’ve set him off tonight, so it might as well have been you.”
They picked a row in the back so people would watch the show instead of them, and Steve sat down with Clint on his left and Tony on his right. They spent the evening watching performers get up on the small stage with the brick backdrop and do improv, tell jokes, and, eventually, share poetry. Clint performed an absolutely hysterical
I spent a rather embarrassing amount of time trying to decide on Steve's dick joke at the end. Runners up were "I'm glad Peggy stopped at the one" and "I should probably stop accepting all those honorary doctorates then."
Thirty minutes of paperwork later, he was in the backseat of the car with Steve. Happy was driving them back to the tower instead of a hotel, at Steve’s insistence, and Tony just didn’t have it in him to fight him on it. He didn’t have anything in him at all. He was exhausted, sore, hungry, and as much as he hated to admit it, even to himself, he was overwhelmed. The camel’s back had broken several hours ago, but the straws just kept piling up. He was maybe a micrometer away from completely losing his shit. But goddammit, he would
“You don’t hate Steve, and Steve doesn’t hate you,” said Pepper, in that tone of patient exasperation only she could make sound not-insulting, “you’re just… two really,
Steve looked toward Grand Central Station and wondered briefly if they were tearing it down with all of the cranes and construction equipment that surrounded it. That was when he remembered what had happened in front of Grand Central not even seven months ago, and the wreckage these crews must still be repairing. Steve bit down the bitter, bitter regrets he had of that day. How many people were cleaning up their mess right now? How many more could they have saved? What was Steve doing to make up for the giant gouge the Avengers had torn through the middle of Manhattan? Christ, they could’ve
Tony almost peeled his thumb instead of the potato, but managed to sound nonchalant when he said, “That doesn’t sound right.”
Hours later, as Tony was welding a new chest plate in the lab, he realized that particular casting had… romantic implications.
“You can’t just tell me not to fight the bad guy without giving me a reason, Steve,” Tony retorted as he dodged a kick, “How the hell was I supposed to know we were fighting My Chemical Necromancer?”
“Jarvis, where are we at on operation figure-out-what-science-powers-magic-and-shut-it-the-fuck-down?”
The elevator doors opened to an empty hallway. On the opposite, curved wall was a row of identically spaced doors, each with a whiteboard on it that said something like “Eddie Brock Birthday Party” or “Oscorp Retreat,” and each one had different levels of chatter and socializing coming from them. Steve guessed these must be the private suites.
In any event, that was when my friends went off to go discuss their meeting with Enchantress and I was free to get to work planning dinner. Since Dr. Banner was joining us again, I decided to dust off another old standby:
“I’m getting tired of changing costumes,” said Steve as he pulled at the starched collar of his policeman’s uniform. “This look-and-fight approach isn’t working. There has to be some way we can get to the phone before we change universes again.”
to stop Steve because dear God, didn’t he understand that if he did this that Tony would lose one of the biggest things he was living
You eye the strip of skin on his abdomen that was exposed when his shirt rode up, and catch yourself thinking,
“You don’t have to wait for your queer card to come in the mail, sugar. If you’re dreaming it, you’re already being it,” said Frank. Then she winked, got up, and walked away.
Tony felt something warm in the pit of his stomach, then he said, “Thank you for telling me. I’m proud of you. Also, if two separate members of the Avengers had their queer awakening at
“J is programmed to preserve life in the tower at all costs, even if it means lying,” said Tony. “I can’t tell you how many times he promised me he didn’t call the fire department over a few little sparks in the lab, only for a whole damn engine to show up a minute later.”
“I’m sure you’ve seen the platitude that home isn’t a place, it’s people, but it’s a little more complicated than that,” said Tony. “Home is something you build, Steve. And the most stable homes are built with people you care about, but either way it’s work. It’s finding the things and the people and the memories that make you happy and making them a part of your environment. It's putting care into where you live and who you spend time with. And for some lucky bastards it’s easy work, building a home. They do it without even thinking. For you and me it’s hard, but it’s not impossible, Steve. It just takes time and effort and good people to build with.”
“I’m not doubting that you’re giving this performance your all, Cap, but if I haven’t coughed up any roots by now then I don’t have a lot of time left, and I’ve got some affairs to put in order.”

Clint sighed and said, “Sorry ladies, but I gotta skee-daddle. Important Avengers business ta get to and all. But I’ll always have a soft spot for Joisey girls.”
“Yeah, I think we both knew that wasn’t going to happen,” said Tony as he tried to sweep Steve’s leg.
“Hey, cheer up Cap. It’ll change back with the next floor,” said Tony, patting Steve on the shoulder.
Mark 104. A loaf-shaped case with enough repulsors to make it fly, an adorable paint job, and nothing else.
“Steve?” he said, taking a stab in the dark as he pushed away and found his feet to stand up straight.
Tony’s lab in lockdown made Fort Knox look like a take a penny leave a penny tray, and he was glad the team stopped their frankly adorable attempts at getting in after day two, but they didn’t stop trying with the dumbwaiter. Nothing nefarious, people couldn’t get in, and neither could anything with any kind of capacity for sabotage, but every time Tony ordered food they’d send up notes with it. Tony never read them, of course, except when his liquor cabinet ran out and the new liquor he ordered came up the dumbwaiter as empty bottles with a sticky note that said, “Got to open the door for more.”
“You should be inside the aquarium now, and thanks to a generous security upgrade from Stark Industries, thank you Pepper, the doors are now locked with adamantium bolts.”
It's a part of my family's food ethos that we never, ever keep secret recipes, so if you decide to make this, know that on the other side of the pearly gates, my Mommom, my Nana, and her mother are all delighted you're eating well because of them.
“Can I, um, can I talk to him alone for a few minutes?” said Steve. “I know he might not be hearing me right now, but I um, I have some things I’d like to say to him, in private.”
Couldn't resist putting in a reference to another fic of mine. If you're looking for something fun to read while waiting for the next update, check out
,” breathed Pepper as they stopped outside of the conference room door. She bodily forced Tony into the blazer.
, he thought briefly), although it was immediately followed by the old mix of anxiety and pain and longing at seeing Steve.
“Before I came here, Strange showed me an example of an artifact,” you say. “It was a book with a person trapped inside its story. Strange said he thought something similar is trapping us here in the tower. But… there’s a natural connection between a book and a story, right?”
“Playing music by artist Cleansweep,” said Gina coolly, as guitar sounds started coming from the phone’s speaker.
Natasha seemed to take pity on him, because she reached behind her and pulled out some fine black cord. A fraction of a second later, Tony’s hands and feet were bound behind him and he was on the ground.
“Can we stop talking about therapy actually?” said Tony, lying back on the bed. “I just— all I wanted tonight was to have some uncomplicated ‘Welcome home’ sex, not get reassured of my progress while I’m literally holding evidence to the contrary.”
Both Tony and Steve looked over at Bruce. There was silence for a bit, and then Bruce’s posture said “Fuck it,” and the next thing out of his mouth was, “Tony, why are you doing this to Steve? And Steve, why are you doing this to yourself?”
thought Tony as he ran his hands tenderly over the well-worn, well-loved and now well-done baseball cap.
Fifteen minutes of explanation later, Thor had turned his face to the wall to hide his deep sense of shame.
By then they were at the top of the escalator, and when Tony looked around everyone was staring at them.
“And every time I asked you how your costume was progressing you said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got it,’” said Tony.
“One of these days I’m not going to be able to stay late, and then you’ll be sorry,” said Jasmine, Tony’s favorite barista, as she unlocked the door.
“I did! Horny teenage Tony Stark thought Stacey McGuire was going to be at a party across town, but my parents had taken away my driving privileges. And I could’ve called a cab but all the blood was in my dick and none of it was in my brain, so when I heard the Mr. Softie jingle at the top of the block I got what I decided was the most
Puppeteer number two said nothing. He just slid right back down the ladder into the sewer. A moment later, Tony was forced to follow.
Bruce straightened up and took stock of his situation. He was clothed, in an elevator with Steve, Nat and Tony, and he had been unconscious a moment ago.
“—it could be a problem when the stakes are high,” finished Steve. “I— I think it’s just that I don’t know
“Maybe you don’t have to,” said Natasha pensively. A moment later she had her phone pressed to her ear.
“Is this dubstep?” asked Steve over the choppy, arrhythmic sounds coming out of the garage’s speakers.
excuse, but Strange cut him off and said, "Captain Rogers, we may not have much time. I understand you're upset, but if you'll let me speak, then we can get to the part where we rescue your friends from a malicious sorcerer. So please." Strange gestured at the empty armchair across from him.
Steve did, and was shocked to see Jade’s right hand wasn’t on his lapel at all. It was just starting to graze the top of Steve’s left pocket.
“Well, Mr. Pup— actually, your buddy’s already got a claim on that name. Do you have one of your own? Nope, changed my mind, don’t care, your supervillain name is Bob now.”
“Yeah, maybe it’s better if we have this conversation like this,” said Steve quietly. “I don’t need you to— Tony, I want to say goodbye.”
“Yes, Mr. Hammer?” came the calm, smooth voice of the prototype Hammertech A.I. from the phone’s speaker.
“Tony, I have faced down goddamn nazis and aliens and robots and every other terrible thing this world has thrown at me. Whatever bullshit you have going on that’s got you convinced that I don’t love you back, I’ll face that too. Because, Tony, I have lost everyone I have ever loved, and I will
“Yeah, because the best part of going to a baseball game is the atmosphere, and it’s way worse in a suite,” said Tony.
“It’s not. Your lives were destined to be on two different tracks; meeting for a while, but eventually going separate ways. That’s me and Pepper too. And yeah, a small part of me’s always going to love her, just like a small part of you’s always going to love Peggy. But you’ve got my heart now, Steve. Don’t ever doubt that,” said Tony.
Ah, fuck. A second amendment asshole. Tony looked at the clock. Three minutes left. He could stall for three minutes.
“I want this to stop. Because we’re fucking adults, Steve, and we’re also the fucking Avengers. People’s lives depend on us. If we keep this up, somebody’s going to die. One of us is going to say he needs help and the other one’s going to roll his eyes or not respond fast enough and someone is going to
“Shut up for a minute, Tony. Also, I’ve also got Pepper and the rest of the Avengers on the line. Say hello everyone,” said Rhodey.
Tony rolled his eyes and said, “Great, now I don’t have to keep pretending I like you. Now if you’ll excuse me—”
“I’ve been meaning to change jobs for ages anyway,” said José. “Been here five years and that idiot still thinks my name is Enrique.”
“I’m not sure what you were trying to accomplish here,” came Bob’s muffled voice from the other side of the casing, “But it sounds like you forgot to account for the fact that you can’t enact the manual override while you’re under the influence of my magic. I’m going to revise my earlier statement: clearly the Avengers are pathetic
The next couple of chapters are intentionally riddled with typos. I know that's a real barrier for dyslexic and screen-reader using readers, so I'll be posting a link up here in the chapter notes for a typo-free version if you need one.
They were in the car driving up FDR drive on their way uptown. It was starting to get properly hot, and the sun was reflecting off all the new glass buildings across the river. Steve’s fingers itched to get out his sketchpad, but they’d be past the buildings by the time he even got down the outline, and he’d been told enough times that cars weren’t allowed to stop in the middle of the street anymore.
“You knocked on my door at MIT and said, ‘This asshole won’t stop complaining that my music is too loud, please deal with her,’ then you
“So soon?” said Hammer as he walked over and clasped Bruce on the shoulder. “Oh Bruce, there’s so much more to show! Sadly I need to run, but Ariel, maybe you could continue the tour without me?”
“Maybe we can narrow it down a bit,” says Natasha thoughtfully. “I know rule number one of spying turned out to be a bust, but rule number five seems to apply here.”
if we’re making educated guesses, then I say we put the roof, Clint’s floor, the pool, and the gym in the unlikely pile. And that we start looking in the middle and move outward.”
“Thanks for keeping everybody on track in your little skit, Bruce,” said Tony. “As much as I love improv, which is not at all, can I please go now?”
Steve threw Tony’s arms off his shoulders in agitation, and Tony was about to sigh and head off when suddenly, Steve had his hand behind Tony’s head and was slamming up against him into the opposite wall with his body, kissing him hard enough to bruise.
Pick stupid stupid fights with me. Flirt with me. Avoid me. Kiss me. It’s non-stop mixed signals with you, and I’m sick of it.
Tony nodded across the room at a dark-haired muscular guy who was laughing and signing with a couple of the event organizers.
They arrived at a side room that had a “Do not enter, under construction” sign in front of it. Steve pushed it aside and opened the door.
“Relax, buckaroo!” says the handsome and familiar stranger. “All butt-pounding is 100% enthusiastic and consensual here. We can just be two buds with washboard abs and giant cocks.”
Tony considered it, but ultimately decided not to. He didn’t have it in him to hear Steve’s desperate insistence that he loved him. He didn’t have it in him to tell Steve that this wasn’t his fault, that he needed to stop scraping his soul for feelings that weren’t there on the off chance that it would save his life. Even now, the disease was getting to the point of no return, whether Tony coughed up the roots or not.
Honestly, the pictures don’t do it justice (and I remain a learner in the realm of food photography). The reds and yellows of the peppers, the green of the kale, the orange of the carrots and the sauce... the end result is always so visually arresting. And then there’s the taste! If one is looking for a way to make vegetables the star of a dinner dish, I cannot recommend this recipe enough.
Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark still happened in this universe, but nobody knew any of Peter's back story so they just made one up. Spider-Man's secret identity in the play is Maxwell Kane, a 30-something struggling playwright with a cocaine addiction and a chip on his shoulder. The play starts with him having sex with a hot spider goddess who promptly dies tragically in his arms and he gets her spider-powers. The play follows his mission to avenge his hot spider-wife while spurning hoards of girls who love how much of a sulky asshole he is.
They’re quiet for a moment except for CLINT slowly coming back from hyperventilating. THOR sits down next to him and almost puts hand on CLINT’s back, but hesitates, then brings it back to his knees, unsure of what to do. Eventually CLINT drops his hands and sits up.
“Jersey jokes aside, the Hammerplex is twenty floors of pretty boring offices and R&D, with an area for events on the first floor. They’re having their Christmas party there in less than a week. I know because he sends me an invitation every year, just to be a dick,” said Tony. “And now we get to the bad news, which is the second thing you need to know about Justin Hammer: he
I roled my eyes all the way up till there was nothing but white & pot up my other middle figer. Then I went to see my hawt boyfriend. The prepz tried to followed me because they are jelous haters so I throwed a knif at them.
“Let’s not talk about our exes tonight, honeycake, it’ll spoil the moment. Well, you already did a little. I’m very mad at you right now.”
“Aww, you like her too,” said Rhodey. “But not as much as you like Steve. You spent twice as much time on him.”
“First of all, Steve, I know you were still on ice while my blow up with Hammer happened, but I promise you this guy’s as sensible as a nine-inch heel. And Thor, we’ve talked about this. The Avengers are subject to laws, and more importantly we’re subject to the press. We can’t just barge in and take the things we want.”
“You’re a consistently arrogant son of a bitch,” replied Hammer, just before he dove behind the special bulletproof crate he’d placed in the warehouse the night before.
“It projects a hologram onto your face,” said Tony. “Anyone looking straight at you will barely see it, but people who aren’t paying attention won’t recognize you. Which is everyone in New York City. Handy if you want to avoid the fan mob and the paparazzi.”
“No, we talked about this,” said Bruce. “Give me some research to do or some experiments to run and I’m golden. Put me in a high-stakes heist and I’m gonna fall apart. And we know what happens when I fall apart.”
Thank you for reading! If you've enjoyed the story, please leave a comment, it really does make my day.

of times, but I want you to try, so you can keep coming home to me. That’s what I’m asking. Can you promise me that, Tony?”
“Joke’s you you, dipshit, we’ve been dating on the sly for three months now,” said Clint with a smirk as he leaned back into the couch cushions where he was seated and ran a hand affectionately over Natasha’s shoulders. “And please, I’ll be Mr. Clint Romanov if anything.”
“Backup power is officially no longer working,” said Tony from his position in the Tower as he typed meaningless garbage into his laptop (the worm he’d already sent into the backup generator was working just fine, but he knew the team would grouse at him if they didn’t hear furious typing at the other end of the comms while he “hacked”). “It’ll stay that way for two minutes. I hope you’re already down the vent, Widow.”
“Banner’s back. Meet me back on his floor, we’ll head into the elevator together. Grab a tee shirt for Bruce,” says the mechanical voice of Tony in the Iron Man suit. You groan.
hotter,” said Tony flippantly, his hand on the doorknob. There was nothing this asshole could say that Howard himself hadn’t alrady told him personally, and every additional second he spent in this room was just more time wasted in this shitty, shitty day.
“And now I need to put the kibosh on the wagon idea,” said Tony. “Sorry, Clint, I can’t play favorites between my kids, you understand.”
We are probably about to see a lot of my one-night-stands in here, so please don’t be weird about it, and let me take the lead.
“Um,” said Tony, as he started to process his mental backlog of things he should be freaking out about and right at the top was “Steve is holding me and petting my hair while I have a panic attack”.
,” said Rhodey quietly, who was shaking his head and biting his lip like he was trying not to laugh. Pepper was looking at the sky like she was surrounded by idiots and praying for the strength not to laugh herself.
“I think everyone but Steve has to be seated around me,” Tony said. “It’s part of the setting, somehow.”
Pepper stopped. “Wow,” she said, “You must’ve really messed up if you’re getting to the apology this early.”
“And it was just after you left that our series of misfortunes began, no?” said Tony with a matching grin.
Thank you. I know he’s no match for you, but watch him anyway. If he’s anything like the real Harold, he’ll go from happy to vicious at the drop of a hat. He might try something stupid.
A small smile breaks across CLINT’s face, and a moment later he’s caught the porch overhang and hoisted himself up on top of it.
“Steve, you idiot!” Tony shouts, as your skin starts to green, “Trying to take him by force was the obvious dumbass option, why’d you pick that!?”
“Steve, you don’t have to tell me anything you’d rather keep private. You got a nerve struck. Happens to the best of us.”
Steve took a small step a few inches farther away from “her” and said, “I just wanted to know if Tony was collaborating with you on whatever project he’s been working on while he’s holed up in his lab.”

The SALOON is mostly deserted. Travelling musician GALAGA GUY (mid-20s, quick-fingered, furtive, fun-loving) plays a ragtime rendition of the Galaga theme on a tinny upright piano. HAPPY HOGAN (mid-40s, friendly, eager, chatty) tends the bar, although at the moment he’s wiping down one of the tables. The only occupied table has several poker players sitting around it, including prospector ODIN ALLFATHER (70s/ancient, wise, stern, grouchy), army colonel CHESTER PHILLIPS (80s, curt, stubborn, commanding), and a STRANGER (60s, quiet, dangerous, gaunt) whose back is to the door. He’s dressed like an outlaw and wearing a wide-brimmed black hat. NATASHA enters through the classic double-doors and takes in the scene as she removes her lace gloves.
I realized as I was writing this chapter that technically cronuts weren't around yet in 2013, but I've decided in the aftermath of the battle for New York, some baker walked into his hulk-smashed cafe, saw a donut and a croissant smooshed together and went "by God, that's it" and invented cronuts a few years sooner.
“Sorry, Tony. I’m the one defying gravity in this relationship.” Then Steve drew his head back and squinted at Tony and said, “I don’t think you’re Glinda, though.”
“I mean, I don’t know the language. And if I wanted to learn it I’d need at least a month. Maybe a week if I had nothing else on my plate but—”
Tony chuckled and said, “More like Heisenberg’s. I know where the relationship is, but not where it’s going or how fast.”
“I— ok, yes, there is a horny panic button I might have accidentally pressed. And no, I am not telling you where it is,” said Tony, as he hastily re-pressed the button to cancel horny mode, pressed the one in the middle, then replaced the back plate.
“6 PM tomorrow. See you there,” said Tony, and he pressed the button on the steering wheel to end the call.
STEVE relaxes a bit at that, then goes up to PEGGY, who steps out onto the porch to meet him halfway, and folds her into an embrace. He eventually pulls back and puts his hands on the sides of her face, covering her earrings. TONY’s doing his best to look unbothered.
Clint regained consciousness with his arms slung over two people’s shoulders. That usually meant there’d been an injury somewhere, but he felt strangely light, like he’d been celebrating. Was he hungover?
If you’re going to do all that set up work you might as well do it to protect clothes that you can’t find at the GAP.
Pepper fixed Tony with a curious look, then said, “JARVIS forget what I said. Really Tony? You have an idea?”
“Anyway, Steve, if you’d like to have a more compatible date, let me set you up. I’ve actually got a good track record,” said Pepper.
“Oh hi, asshole Tony, haven’t seen you in a while. Could you go get the Tony I was starting to like and tell him to call the damn car?”
The reason Tony hadn’t gotten a float was simple: if they walked, they’d be marching. If they rode on a float, they’d be performing. And Steve didn’t like to perform.
“I think we were at the part where you were going to apologize for trying to have pity sex with me,” said Steve, a thread of irritation in his words.
“We’re not getting a cat for the tower because you want to avoid seeing a play,” said Steve a few days later.
I can’t wait to give them to R&D to reverse engineer. Not as nifty as this though.” Hammer indicated the scepter case. “Can’t even open it without the combination. Which you’re going to tell me, before we’re through here.’”
“Good, it’s a terrible name. Let’s figure out a better one for it and then put some serious work into it, because if I get turned into a ferret, Clint’s gonna start an Instagram page for ferret-me and I will never get laid again. How far away is Steve?”
“Yeah, sorry, the boss is really bad with names. And he’s kind of a dick,” said Alexis with a sigh. “But he pays well, and we’re doing good work here.”
“Goodbye, Tony,” said Steve, as he shoved his fists into his pockets and strode as quickly as he could toward the elevator.
As if he was hearing Steve’s thoughts, Tony said, “Of course the people who didn’t live with him could take it all in stride. Price of dealing with a genius, y’know? Had to think he wasn’t just right about his projects, he was right about his politics and his prejudices and what everyone wanted to do for the Christmas party or whatever other bullshit Howard had an opinion on that day. ‘Of course I’m not going to the ballet with you, Maria, because I think it’s boring, and my opinion is the one that matters. Ask Tony. Yes he took you the last dozen times, but I don’t think that’s important, which means it’s not. Go deal with your hurt feelings somewhere else, I’ve got welding to do.’ And the irony here isn’t lost on me, Steve. I know I just lost my shit because you wouldn’t accept my opinion as a fact. I'm sorry. Something about you really brings out the Howard in me.”
A few years ago I did some de-escalation training. Between sessions 1 and 2 the instructor said "Who here's already had the opportunity to use their training?" A couple hands shot up and everyone's story happened on the subway. Of course the overwhelming majority of subway rides are uneventful, and some are fun (especially when people bring dogs in bags); I don't want to discourage anyone reading this from taking the subway when they come to NYC. But Fury's probably got the right idea by discouraging the Avengers from trapping themselves in a fast-moving metal tube with predictable routes, limited means to escape, no cell phone reception, and lots of anonymous people who're grumpy and potentially intoxicated. Especially when they've got the funds and alternate means to get from point A to point B.
“Sweet Jesus, you’re wound tighter than a virgin puss— oh hello, can’t tell that joke with ladies present, can I, huh?” said Hammer with a swat to Bruce’s shoulder. “Let me show you how much more relaxed you’ll be when you come and work for me.”
Much as I’m enjoying exploring your accent kink, I should probably tell ye we just got phasers back online. I’ll have torpedoes in a few, but shields aren’t going to last if we keep taking knocks like this.
“No, we didn’t,” said Steve, “he came to visit me on the hospital floor while I was sleeping, but he was gone before I woke up. The last I saw him was when we were all in the common room together. I keep going through it in my mind but I can’t figure out what went wrong.”
“I’ve asked, they said they won’t sell it outside the restaurant. And I offered them more money than half the cars in my garage cost. Combined.”
“Pep, I’ve been briefed on SI’s work on MREs and med-kits and body armor. That’s great stuff and I get it. What I
“When the inhabitants of this manor visited Dr. Banner’s quarters to divine information on the artifact, we had all assumed that the only pertinent information available to us was concerning what it might look like and which floor it might be on. However, there was one other piece of information that was known to us: a clue that had no use at the time but now has proven vital to the conclusion of this case,” said Tony.
So Tony spent the rest of the game talking about reverb and building materials and how the vendors and the organ and the announcer all paint an acoustic picture and how where they were sitting was like looking at a painting with some of the colors missing. And of course
There once were six heroes who lived in a tower, and their super-friendship was their super-power. But one day it happened, without trace or hint— Those six became five. They had lost their friend Clint.
“Pretty cool, huh?” said Hammer with a broad grin, “State of the art AI. If she were any smarter she’d have
NYC is full of wonderful pizza places. That being said, Clint is correct - L&B's makes the best pizza in the five boroughs. Objectively.
Nat kicked out the bottom of the vent and said, “I’m in position two. I just hope Bruce got the signal.”
“I wasn’t, Steve. If I were right then Tony wouldn’t be locked in his lab right now as dead to the world as you are.”
Steve let his boots click loudly as he strolled across the main lobby to the security desk. All around him, people were turning to stare. The full Captain America suit and shield had that effect. Steve did his best to ignore them as he approached the desk.
routes to the vault are protected by security guard-supervised keycard entry at all entrances and exits to the building, all of which is also StarkTech. If I spent a few months poring over the code, I
“Oh, ok. At least tell me what we got him as a gift so I’m not surprised when I see it,” says Bruce.
“Is that from La Colombe?” said Tony without turning around from where he was wiring something delicate on the workbench.
“And I think, maybe, you might even have yourself convinced that you’ve unearthed some feelings you never knew were there,” said Tony. “Because you really are
“On the sub— Cap, what the fuck did I say was rule number one if you all were going to be living in New York?”
“This is sounding more and more like something to take loudly and with force, press be damned,” said Thor.
records your keystrokes to get your pin number,” said Natasha. “Put’em together and you’ve got a tidy little scam. Jasmine, you’re gonna want to call your boss, and then the police. Somebody put a skimmer on your ATM.”
In case anyone's curious what Nat and Clint were saying to each other in chapter 1, the last scam referenced is a "fiddle game," where the mark is convinced something not very valuable is actually something valuable. Which gives us this rough translation:
Steve was indeed awake, and from the clock on the nightstand it was just after 3. Unrequited crushes had a way of keeping Steve up at night.
“Hey Bruce, looks like you’ve been working hard,” says Steve. “Do you want to take a break and get some food?”
Steve gave a small smile and said, “Something similar, if you’ll believe it. I don’t really know if I want them or not. Honestly, I’m worried someone will find out about them and use them to get to me.”
Steve could still pick out a few landmarks he remembered from before the ice: Brooklyn bridge, Central Park, the Chrysler building, the Hudson. And he knew from his travels around the city that a lot of the Victorian building fronts were still intact. But everywhere there were these new glass buildings rising out of the ground like giant rods of crystal, breaking up the familiar stone and clay of Steve’s youth. And Steve didn’t hate them, but he didn’t like them either. They just felt alien, like so many things in his new life.
“You tell me to shut up and compliment me for something I don’t deserve in the same breath, and when I can’t figure out what the right response is to that, you add another confusing layer by apologizing. You did it right before we went into the poetry slam too. It’s like emotional whiplash or something.”
“For him, maybe. But not for you,” said Hammer. “C’mon, Cap— may I call you Cap? If getting the scepter really is all that important, surely you and the other super friends can give me what I want whether Tony agrees or not.”
Either an eternity or a second passed like that, with Tony looking at Steve and Steve looking at Tony. Then Tony’s phone rang with a caller from an unknown number. And while most of the tracks in Tony’s head had concluded Pepper and the team were behind this, the second possibility, that something a bit more sinister had successfully lured two unarmed Avengers into an enclosed space, was now front and center in Tony’s mind. Steve must’ve realized the same thing, because he immediately went into a combat stance and said, “Put it on speaker.”
“In a way, this makes things easier for me. Before, I would’ve had to take you with me to finish setting up the last of the amplifiers. Now I can simply trap you in here until my plan is complete.”
The second page shows Steve and Tony standing in the living room area we just saw in the last two panels, overlaid with the conversation Steve: "Oh yeah, Strange said the artifact left a lot of residual magic here. It'll dissipate eventually but it'll flare up like this from time to time until it does." Two panels of a close up on Steve and Tony, the first just of them talking, the second of Steve counting off on his fingers while Tony looks concerned. It's overlaid with the conversation Tony: "Wait, you've been living in a comic strip since the Enchantress thing?" Steve: "Oh no. It's been a lot more than just a comic strip." Tony: "What?" Steve: "Yeah, just this past week it's been... a silent movie, an infomercial--". New panel. Steve's speech bubble says "A puppet show", and the panel shows the same living-room setting, only with the background looking flatter and curtains on either side. Hand-puppet versions of Steve and Clint are talking to each other, with puppet-Clint saying "Hi Steve! Oh my God! Where are my legs!". The next panel has Steve's speech bubble saying "An Ikea Catalogue--" and shows the living room setting with more dynamic lighting, the word "IKEA" overlaid above the scene, and the words "MORABO sofa $399" next to the chair. The next panel has Steve's speech bubble saying "A Dali painting -- that one was wierd --" The same living room scene, only the books are floating and have odd markings on the front, the shield is melting off the cabinet, the lamp shade is floating off the lamp, and the NYC cityscape has the buildings in contorted shapes and the statue of liberty pointing its torch toward the viewer. The next panel cuts back to Steve with a hand on his chin and another hand still counting, as if in thought. Steve: "A radio play, a cooking show--" The final panel shows Tony taking Steve by the wrist and leading him back toward the elevator. Tony: "C'mon, we're going to my floor."
really — not for puppets, not for unobstructed sightlines, not for any reason Tony could think of. Why here? Why now? And also, why hadn’t the girl
in his hands. It was pre-owned, so the spine had creases and a few of the pages even had highlights and notes. He opened the book to the page that had clearly been the previous owner’s favorite, and read.
Hi my name is Natasha Nigtshade Blood’ness Vampira Way Romanov & I have blood redhair with black streaks and purple eyes with gold flecks. I am half campire half werewolf half fae & becuz of that I can see the future & tlak to aminals & I work for Hydra which means I live with a lot of vampires & we save the world from prep vampires who arn’t goth like us. I use knifes tipped in Nightshad (thats how I got my name) & I always wear black. Lik today I am wearing a black leather dress with red lace, black dock Martinis, sparkle skull earrings and riped red fishjets. I had white foundation and black lip stick and lots fo black eyelinner. 2 prep boys came to my floor of the Hydra tower & 1 even laughed at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
“Thank you,” said Tony. “Now, I think we’re past the point of trust falls and we might well kill each other on a weekend retreat, but I came here to ask you if you wanted to try doing something together.”
. Then Steve found his voice and said, “Those are all attributes of a good PI in a detective novel. So let’s play this out, detective. A phone’s gone missing. You’ve concluded your investigation. What were your findings?”
In the interest of working quickly, it seems like there’s no point keeping it to yourself anymore, Bruce. What is it we’re looking for?
“You’re right, it doesn’t,” said Steve, and Tony had physically stop himself from sighing with relief. “But that’s not the part that doesn’t sound like you.”
“Also, double dates are way more fun than single ones," said Rhodey. "You’re still single, aren’t you Tony?”
Tony’s protesting muscles had no effect on his puppet master’s desire to get him up off the ground and back into the fight as quickly as possible. Neither did the gravel digging painfully into his left hand as he pushed himself up. He used the opportunity to get another look at the girl in the shield bubble. She seemed utterly unconcerned with anything going on around her. She looked almost sad? Then Tony saw her wrist.
“Belay that, JARVIS,” said Steve, as he fixed Tony with a look that was somewhere in the middle of irritated, anxious and incredulous.
I'd like to dedicate this chapter and the next one to the memory of Miguel Algarín, co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, who passed away yesterday (December 1st, 2020).
“I’ve got a weird body, Tony. Even before the serum I was always being poked and prodded by doctors checking up on me or bullies finding my weak spots. And now everybody and their grandma wants to squeeze Captain America’s magic test tube biceps. It’s just human curiosity.”
Also, in case the Belgian accent didn't give it away, Tony's playing the part of a pseudo-Poirot in an Agatha Christie novel at the end.
“I have several messages from members of the team asking for Sir’s location. What shall I tell them?” said Jarvis’s voice emanating from both the open clam shell suit and the computer’s speakers.
“Alright, now that we’ve established that Steve’s used up his dumbass decisions quota for the next forever, we’d better keep going. Whatever whammied the tower didn’t do it for fun,” said Bruce.
Steve was getting ready to politely but insistently corral Bruce over to the special large reinforced elevator that, if necessary, would plummet faster than freefall to the containment floor, but he felt Tony nudge his elbow, and when Steve looked he was shaking his head. Steve was still on edge, but then Tony switched to the messaging app on his phone and texted Natasha, “Party in the kitchen. Green gate-crasher possible. Come check?” Steve relaxed a bit when he saw her reply, “On my way.” Nat had a sixth sense about the Hulk even better than Bruce did. She’d know what to do.
“Right there, there he is, my favorite biologist slash physicist,” said Hammer as he walked across the floor of the lab.
So that night, when Tony crashed on the couch in his lab at 4 AM wondering how the hell he’d managed yet again to start a fight with Steve, Tony set about adding that conversation to every other one he’d ever had with Steve to try and find something he could use to fix this. Because if there was one thing Tony was constitutionally incapable of, it was leaving things un-fixed.
“Because it was the only way to get us to stop fighting with each other. I told you about the list.”
When it looks like Clint and Nat are about to go and ask the Hulk containment floor his opinion on the sexual prowess of the pool, and Tony and Bruce are about to run off to Bruce’s lab to build something that, on the napkin blueprint, has the words ‘14% chance we all die’ scribbled underneath it, you chime in and say, “Alright, break time’s over.”
“Interesting,” says Natasha, “So if we see something like a cell phone in the noir novel, or a gun in the kids’ book, that could be it.”
“Clint, I hope you’re not busy for the next month, because I’ve booked you for every kid’s birthday party in the tri-state area as a Captain America impersonator,” said Tony.
It’s been less than a day since we shipped out from New York City, and yet all I can think about is you. The sea is harsh, and Captain Jarvis is harsher, but I am determined to prove myself among the men and earn my fortune so that we may one day be married. I already miss you so desperately.
The entire month of March disappeared into a frantic blur when some guy calling himself the Silver Surfer politely informed the earth that they were all about to be devoured by some kind of cosmic entity calling itself Galactus. The world leaders and the Avengers all did a quick straw poll and decided getting devoured would be a bit of a bummer, so then it was a matter of launching a spaceship (thank God Pepper had kept the Stark Industries space division funded and didn’t leave that Musk idiot to figure this shit out) and then, with the help of some magic portals from Dr. Strange, tracking the Galactus guy down. There was lots of agita and failed strategies, and ultimately a pretty sophisticated plan involving distractions and feints while Tony hacked Galactus’s ship to launch his sorry ass through a portal into a big stretch of uninhabited space where he could eat all the planets he could get his grubby lil’ paws on (ok, they were pretty big paws, but you get the idea). Then they came back to earth and it was paperwork and debriefs and interviews to pacify the public and Tony was so goddamn ready for a break that when Steve asked if he wanted to go check out some amateur slam poetry, Tony was actually
“I wouldn’t worry about it, Tony,” said Steve as they walked back to the car. “I think I can handle it.”
Tony bit back a scream of fury and frustration. “Unidentified energy signatures” was code for “magic”, which meant he was about to face down some goddamn woo-woo crap that made no fucking sense within the laws of physics or nature or anything else. Of
The Avengers search a living room mostly decorated with purple. Bruce looks down by a small tree in a pot with a fluffy top. Thor lifts a purple striped couch to look underneath it, seeing only coins and dust-bunnies. Tony angrily tosses things over his shoulder, including Cap's shield, a pair of underpants with an A on them, and a spring, and a pillow. Steve looks at a quiver of arrows on an armchair. Natasha looks behind a television. Playing on the television are tsums of Steve and Tony, with hearts around them.
I have never held a fanfiction hostage for comments in my entire life and I never will again, but... well, you heard alternate universe Gogglor: I'm going to need 5 "gud reviows" on this chapter before we can advance to the thrilling conclusion of Natasha Nightshade Blood'ness Vampira Way Romanov's story. Remember: no flamming!
There was dead silence for a moment, as everyone’s hair stood on end with a sudden abundance of static electricity.
Natasha didn’t open her eyes immediately when she regained consciousness. She was in a small, well-lit space with a polished stone floor that smelled relatively clean, most likely an elevator. Around her were two people who were shifting their weight uneasily. Her hands weren’t bound, and she wasn’t drugged. If they’d counted on her staying knocked out they were about to get quite a surprise.
” said Tony, pretending he’d forgotten but failing badly. “Yeah, that was… you deserved a much better reaction to coming out than my comments section rage, I’m sorry about that.”
“Oh absolutely. It was a point of pride for her. But Ma wasn’t the only brilliant immigrant stuck in a factory job back then. Mrs. Barnes spoke fifteen languages.”
Steve compared the video footage he’d seen of Maria with the painting in his mind. The woman in the painting was regal and crisp and a bit stiff. Maria had struck Steve as quiet and kind and a little sad.
“I’m sorry, sir, we’ve just closed for the day,” said a frizzy-haired woman with horn-rimmed glasses and a double chin.
The crowd grumbled in embarrassment and frustration as they put their phones away, then Tony said, “I need to go touch up my makeup, I’ll meet up with you inside.”
“Better than good,” said Natasha. “Ledgers with sales to Hydra, the Sokovian Mafia, a couple of dictators... everything Homeland Security would need to put Hammer away for a very, very long time.”
“We pick the floor with the weakest pull and the least ridiculous clothes and we make a plan on how to search more granularly,” said Steve as he scratched at his waxy blue armor shirt.
“Because we only just got it this morning,” said an instantly recognizable smarmy voice on the other end of the vent. “Latest model comes with a built-in jammer too. Neat, huh?”
Nazi asshole ousted from Hitler’s inner circle for being too batshit crazy. Too crazy for Hitler! How the crap is THAT possible?
“Just send me an email with whatever you want and JARVIS’ll get it to me” said Steve over his shoulder, as the elevator doors opened.
Spoilers for Wicked ahead! Sorry, they're kind of unavoidable and I can't really tell you how to skip over them if you want to keep reading.
Natasha swatted him in the elbow, and signed something in ASL, which made Clint roll his eyes and say, “Fine. Our table will be the one with like a hundred steam baskets on it. C’mon, Thor, time to introduce you to
“You did warn them we were coming, right Tony?” said Clint. “Because I personally am about to eat my own weight in soup dumplings and I’m worried what that means for feeding Steve and Thor.”
“Now we know who the ringmaster is for this circus,” my friend Tony said (I promise he’s not crazy, just very, very eccentric!).
And as Steve got better at listening to the part of him saying he wanted other people to respect his space, he got better at listening to other things he wanted too. Unfortunately that meant the part of him that had built up from a whisper to a shout saying
Steve laughed, got back up, and kissed Tony just as the countdown finished. Outside the room at the party there was cheering, and the band started playing auld lang syne.
Tony didn’t have an answer for that. So he did what he always did when he didn’t have an answer. He made shit up.
Steve suppressed an eye roll and turned back towards Colleen. As a living relic of 20th century Americana he could personally testify to the fact that Doug’s specialty was superficial and boring. Plus Tony had read all of Doug’s books the moment Pepper said he was going to be Tony’s date, and that was on top of the ones he’d already read when he had his childhood preoccupation with Captain America. He probably knew more about Doug’s specialty than Doug did.
“That’s what you believe, right? That if you’re dangerous, you don’t get a chance to try to protect people, or to be happy, or to make up for your mistakes. So who’s getting ejected off-planet first, Thor, you or me?”
out of my way!” snarled Hammer as he bowled through layer after layer of security guards and doors on his way to the sub-basement.
The elevator dinged and the door opened to let everyone out, but Steve put his hand on Tony’s shoulder before he could join the others.
“Interesting,” Frank said, like she was deep in thought, and then she added, “and I’ll bet you were good friends with her first, weren’t you?”
bled into talking about paintings again and then a hundred other things. If it were anyone else sitting next to him, Tony would have spent the entire time worrying he was bulldozing them with word vomit and spent the rest of the week kicking himself for turning into Howard the second he got an inch of conversational purchase. But it wasn’t anyone else; it was Steve. It was like Tony had spent his life pouring himself through a hundred filters to present a facsimile of a functional human being to the world. And here, with Steve, he could just… be.
“Apparently the tabs have been losing their minds the past few weeks trying to figure out who Tony Stark’s red scarf knitter is, and she had a betting pool with her friends about it and wanted my insight. You see, in this video, which she played for me on her phone, someone filmed you in a yarn store having an anxious conversation with the owner about a red scarf,” said Steve.
“And start an international incident? ‘Captain America Won’t Shake the President’s Hand,’” said Steve, putting up his hands to frame his mock headline, “Look Tony, I get what you’re saying, but when I signed up for the serum, I signed up for a body that doesn’t 100% belong to me. And I’m ok with that, really.”
Tony shivered slightly, looked back at Steve, and said, “If you ever go over to the dark side, I’m going to point to this conversation and say, ‘I told you so’.”
Natasha stood up and took off her padded fingerless gloves. “Go wash up. Meet me in your room in an hour.”
“Christ, if we ever end up with a time machine our moms should start a sewing circle,” chuckled Tony. Then he paused, and added, “Maria kept rare orchids. So did a lot of rich people back then, but they hired gardeners to take care of theirs. Mom did it herself. And she loved those orchids. She could tell you everything there was to know about them, plus a few of her own discoveries. In another life she’d’ve been a world-famous botanist.”
On a normal day, Tony probably would’ve had another quip lined up. But today he was tired and sore and grouchy and just having the
Steve rolled his eyes, then said, “I um… I wanted to come clean about something, Tony. I lied to you.”
“Type C is much like types A and B, only it also requires the afflicted person to believe their feelings are requited before their symptoms subside,” said JARVIS smoothly.
“I know this probably doesn’t need to be said,” said Nat, looking around the room. “But I’d prefer if you all didn’t share this. I’d rather not spend the rest of my life castrating horny fan-boys trying to fix me with their magic dicks.”
It was empty, except for a flip phone sitting on the table in the center of the room, next to a piece of paper that said, “For Justin.” Almost immediately, it began to ring.
There was no such assurance if Tony asked Steve out. First, Steve was almost certainly straight, but even if they lived in the hypothetical, made-up, happy-land universe where a hard enough crush on a straight boy made him like you back, a relationship with Steve was a bad idea. Tony had plenty of exes who hated him and he hated them right back. There was so much more at stake here than there’d been with Pepper, too. The Avengers were at the other end of the Big Red Phone on every world leader’s desk. People depended on them. That had been the reason they’d started this whole project in the first place; the Avengers needed stability, and two of its members constantly taking potshots at each other undermined that stability and created a potential for danger. Tony would be damned if he took all the work they had done to get where they are and threw it out the window because Steve was… kind. And earnest. And fucking
A moment later, Bob threw himself on the ground as Tony’s fourth backup suit hurtled through the open passageway and encased Tony within itself before falling flat on the floor.
“About damn time,” said Clint. He was in his boxers, his janitor’s disguise folded neatly on the chair next to him. “Now hurry the hell up and
The STRANGER lets go of her wrist, then tilts his head so he and NATASHA can both look each other in the eye. There’s shocked recognition in both of their faces, as NATASHA sees her foster father IVAN PETROVICH for the first time in years, and IVAN sees his in-universe daughter.
“We made a pact last year that we’d all go together,” said Bruce. “Tony’s the one who suggested the Pride show, since they do some fun extra stuff that night. And their last one this year is on Friday, which means it’s now or never.”
"Just a second." Steve reached into his pants, pushing his underwear down to expose his cock, already half-hard.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it Bruce,” says Tony quickly. “I just… need to talk to Steve and Nat about something real quick. Back in a sec.”
Steve gave a bitter, almost hysterical chuckle, and it was so grating to Tony’s ears that he knew he’d never forget it as long as he lived.
, of course, you’d like to trade the scepter for it?” said Tony. “Perhaps, tomorrow at the Hammertech warehouse in Secaucus? You and me?”
“Nah, I’ve tried dating geniuses. The ones that aren’t taken are all as emotionally stunted as I am.”
“Now you’re catching on,” said Tony, “She’s using that too. I’ll bet you were thinking ‘She’s here with Tony, I can’t make a big deal out of this and imply his girl is hitting on me. And Tony wouldn’t bring a date who’s here to hurt me. And she runs such a huge charity, she can’t be a bad person. I must be overreacting.’ She knows what she’s doing, pal. Play to the end, J, and this time close your eyes, Steve.”
The Crucible's a bit after Steve's time, but I figured it'd fit in with the books he's read since he's come out of the ice. Tony read Marx mostly so he could surprise the hippies that protested him, and will only ever admit to agreeing with anything he had to say when he's drunk.
“May I have one of those as well?” asked Thor, whose hair was also much longer than he usually kept it.
“He’s changing! Security, he's changing!” shouted Justin as he and the tech backed away. “Get your damn guns out, we’re about to have a big green problem!”
“Well, I stand by my assessment that I would’ve had a better time if I knew the language,” said Tony.
“Why do they always show me with my hair down?” muttered Natasha, as she produced a hair tie from nowhere and started tying back her now waist-length hair into a ponytail.
“Tony, look at me,” said Steve. Tony looked at Steve’s feet, because that was the best he could manage right now. But it was useless, because seconds later, Steve’s hand was on his chin, forcing their eyes to meet.
Tony crossed his arms and leaned a shoulder against the doorway to the en suite bathroom as he looked at Steve, who was lying naked on his stomach with his head resting on his arms and his eyes turned towards Tony. Sweet
The glass tanks of animals and plants are rapidly locking down, although there’s no need for the precaution. The plants and animals make the small you feel happy. The glass squares were making the small you upset, though, and keeping him awake. And they might be locking down with the desk, but you’re faster than you look. You raise your fists over your head and reduce Bruce’s carefully organized slides on the desk to glass powder and plywood. You reach for the computer monitor and throw it against the wall, where it explodes into a shower of circuit board fragments. You tear apart the wall that has come down to protect a table of delicate-looking glass vials before it can cover them (because really, glass smashing is so nice, the small you will understand) and tear it apart. Then you punch through the glass containers and feel the burn of something caustic as they shatter and get their contents on your skin. Nothing enough to seriously hurt you, but it does make you angrier. So you take the table that was supporting the glass and hurl it in the direction of your fight-friends. They duck, and it breaks apart with a thunk and a clatter.
, Steve, and it might not be one of us. And I have enough deaths on my conscience, ok? Now I know right now you can’t stand me and God knows I am not friends with you either, but we have to
Amora said something through the gag that sounded like, “No shit, Sherlock.” Tony’s hypothesis that the Asgardian Shakespeare in the Park schtick was just an act gained a new piece of evidence.
“Oh the suit’s lightning-proof. Took care of that after the disaster with the giant lizards in Central Park.”
“You know something? There just might be,” said Clint pensively, before he turned to Natasha and added, “I’m thinking we do a Kansas City shuffle, what about you?”
“Hey, Thor,” said Clint as they finally continued walking out of the restaurant lobby “How many PhD's does Jane have again?”
“Hey, they’re good guys, but this is a little different from a typical Friday night here at the Hammerplex,” said José.
“You remind me that I’m in love with you more than once a week,” said Steve. “You remind me every day.”
“You’ve done your homework on Hammer’s psychology, Nat,” said Tony. “Tell me: does he strike you as the kind of guy who’d use the same keypad combination on both safes?”
“You know what the saddest part is, Justin?” said Tony. “This whole plan would’ve fallen apart if you ever had even a
Steve was about to say something affirming but Tony's tone was hard when he continued, "Let me explain what I mean, Steve. Someday you might have two choices. The first one is easy and saves the day, but it’ll mean… it’ll mean you don’t come home. The second one is hard, nearly impossible, risky, but it saves the day
They climbered and clambered away up the stairs, to the top of the tower, out in the clear airs. They all looked around on the top of the roof, and they hoped to see Clint standing there all aloof...
“Funny thing about vaults, Justin,” said Tony with a smile. “You can keep more than scepters in them. When’s the last time you did a little inventory?”
“Wow, that sounds like a really great series,” said Steve. “Do you recommend starting with the radio plays or the books?”
“Steve, you have to believe me. There is no universe where he hands the scepter over willingly,” said Tony.
, Tony,” said Bruce as he slammed the microwave shut on something in a takeout container. And when that clearly didn’t put either of them at ease, Bruce took a breath and put on a smile and said, “Look, see? I’m fine. Just tired.”
It’s just like riding behind on your damn motorcycle, Rogers. Just hold on tight and don’t backseat drive.
“I cannot believe the biggest fight we ever had was over a musical about cats,” said Tony. “In fact I refuse to believe it. If anyone asks, we saw
There’d been times in his life where that wasn’t true. God knows he’d spent the better part of his teens passively fantasizing about some unforeseen tragedy striking him: an aneurysm, or a lab accident, or even a goddamn city bus. Even later, when he was no longer desperate for a love from his parents that he would never have or trying to drink his problems away, the fantasy would still recur from time to time, particularly when he was stressed or lonely or just desperate for a bit of quiet from the never-ending churn of his own mind. But somewhere between the cave in Afghanistan and the Chitauri invasion, Tony had found purpose, and that purpose had eventually become meaning. It was something to live for, something to (somewhat literally) fill the hole in his chest he’d been feeling as long as he could remember.
In lieu of answering, Tony dropped the peeler, turned around, and pressed his lips against Steve’s. The kiss was soft, and it was hot and it was… itchy?
“Oh come on, it’s been seventy years since you’ve gotten laid. Time to join the 21st century properly, pal,” said Tony.
“As soon as we switch universes again I am turning all of you into vermin,” spat Amora before Clint could stuff something in her mouth.
was a mantra of Steve’s both before and after the ice), and Steve fended off holograms while Tony either watched or worked in the background, both of them absolutely comfortable just being in the same space together.
“Thor, why is the artifact in the tower instead of, say, on the moon, or anywhere so far away we can’t reach it?” asks Tony.
“Tony, listen to me,” said Steve. “I’m sorry. The way we were, I will regret that for the rest of my life. But that was before I
Tony screwed his courage to the sticking place and said, “The longer you stay hung up on me, the longer it’s going to take you to find home again, Steve.”
“As I was saying. The clock has stopped. You’ll note the time is 6:07 A.M. Captain Rogers, am I mistaken in noting that you leave for your daily exercises at—”
“Absolutely,” said Tony. “Remember what I said about witticisms and raw sexual energy? I’m irresistible.”
“I’m an engineering genius, you’re a tactical mastermind, and we can’t have sex until we escape a locked room,” said Tony, who’d already expanded the regular eight tracks of his brain to one hundred to process routes of escape (well, fifty of them were dedicated to what he was going to do to Steve as soon as they got back to the tower, but the other fifty were more than up to the task), “Given those variables, would
Reminder: Make sure you have skins for this story! If you're seeing a yellowish background behind the text below, you're good!
how many times I’ve heard this same fucking monologue, Bob-ra Ann? Christ, do you minor villain types go to conventions and workshop speeches together? I’m not the one who’s pathetic here, Bob-o. And say what you will about the Avengers, but we know how to bring the
Most of the poems mentioned are a bit of a mishmash of poems I actually got to see performed at ASL Slam, but "Homelight" was a real poem I got to see once, and I would credit the poet if I could remember his name (best I can do is say he appears at 1m20s in the video posted in the note above). And it really was that good of a poem. I still think about it sometimes.
And Tony was coughing again, but it felt different this time. It was like a thousand little tendrils of pain were ripping into Tony’s lungs as something
“Chatter,” muttered Steve as he smiled at the next customer and took an order for a wild berry smoothie.
Couldn't resist a nod to one of my favorite Stony fanfic universes in this chapter. If you haven't yet, I strongly recommend checking out
Bruce’s lab felt so alien compared to Tony’s. It was full of plants and various bugs and fish and small mammals in glass enclosures, and test tubes full of different colored goos. And Steve felt a fresh pang of longing for the metal shavings and cluttered half-finished prototypes he’d come to associate with feeling at home.
“Hey, look at me Steve,” said Tony. Steve looked, and it wasn’t just embarrassment there; it was shame too. Steve was trying to mask it with defiance, but Tony had done that himself enough times to recognize it for what it was. So Tony sighed, rubbed the back of his neck, and picked his words carefully.
Bob turned around in his chair and scowled at Tony’s face, and Tony’s hand inched a little bit closer to his pocket again. Perfect. Now it was just a matter of misdirection 101.
“Yes. Yes, Bruce, there’s a surprise party. I know you have work to do, but could you come, please?” says Steve.
I had a clear view of the chambers in that gun from where I was sitting. All of them were full. He didn’t miss, so he didn’t fire. That gunshot came from outside.
Steve continued, "I’ve already trusted you with having my back on missions, and I’ve trusted you enough to talk about… me stuff. But I also need to trust your judgement and your experience.”
But the poem that really got to Steve was the last one of the night, called “Homelight.” The poet found a way to combine the signs for “home” and “light” and “inspire” and “happy” to encapsulate this feeling of joy and wholeness he felt when he was going home. And suddenly Steve’s throat was tight and his vision was blurry and he really wished he was… somewhere else. He didn’t know where. And that made it a thousand times worse.
“AAAaaaaggghhh!” Tony screamed into the pillow with frustration. Because Steve wasn’t a stick in the mud either! Steve was more than capable of shooting the shit with literally everyone else. Whatever was wrong, it wasn’t with Steve. It was with Tony. Because of
Steve’s lips were soft and warm. Dream Steve froze for a fraction of a second (???) and then he was kissing Tony back. He tasted like popcorn butter and Coca-Cola. (????)
Of course Tony had no choice in the matter of moving or not. Whoever was pulling his strings didn’t care if he was bound; he was still compelled to pull against his binding, which let Tony add rope burn to his list of complaints. When he finally stopped moving, Tony almost cried with relief.
“Draw something else, Steve. We can go down a floor and you can draw impressionists until the museum closes. I’ll pay to keep it open for you if you want. Just— draw something else.”
Before he knew it, they were at the instrumental section, which made Tony shout, “JARVIS, don’t you dare cut out the dance break! C’mon, Steve, time to dance.”
“Hope there’s food in Thor’s universe. I’m getting hungry,” said Tony and everyone else murmured their agreement as Nat pushed the button for Thor’s floor.
Tony forcefully reminded himself that reading into the blushes of a guy who also blushed whenever they passed a billboard with a model’s exposed midriff on it was not something he should do, and the butterflies in his stomach needed to get with the program. Then he said, “Well, you shouldn’t have to pick up your dates from the fan club.”
“People break up for lots of reasons, Steve. Sometimes it’s falling out of love or cheating or realizing you’re not good for each other. But sometimes it’s because the lives you want don’t match up. You could have all the love in the world but if one of you desperately wants to have kids and the other one desperately doesn’t, the relationship’s not going to work.”
They were near the top of the spiral, so they took their time walking down the ramp in silence. Steve knew if there was one thing Tony couldn’t abide it was silence, so all he had to do was wait and see what Tony was comfortable saying. Steve had once hidden in a tree for nine hours waiting to ambush a nazi caravan, and Tony had five coffee makers in his workshop because he could never wait for a pot to be full. He had a feeling he could wait Tony out.
“Sandra Jimenez, thirty-three, just got back from maternity leave from her second kid. Lives with her husband Carlos up in the Bronx. MBA from Fordham University, graduated summa cum laude, track record of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of every department she’s ever worked for, and generally a frighteningly competent woman.”
“As long as you keep trying to take care of yourself.” Tony looked like he was about to object but Steve raised his hand and said, “I know you won’t exactly be following the food pyramid or a human circadian rhythm. I’m at peace with that. But if it starts to really detract from your health, if you stop doing anything to take care of yourself and pour everything into your work, if you start cutting years off your life expectancy and we’ve talked about it and negotiated and you won’t change, then this relationship isn’t going to last.”
Only time in the movie he gets to pick his own clothes is the linen suit at the end, which is… fine?
“Nice try, Justin, but you and I both know what kind of paperwork is kept in a secret safe behind a portrait. Natasha’s been reading through it as we’ve been driving. Was our intel good, Nat?”
to hear fuller versions of Steve's and Tony's embarrassing sex stories plus Nat's, Bruce's, Clint's, Thor's, Jane's and Rhodey's.
Tony turned his head but it took a second to register what the clock on the bedside table was telling him through the haze of endorphins.
Would either of you mind gettin’ a feller something to wet his whistle? Anything stronger than water would do nicely.
“I mean, she was nice,” said Steve as they headed toward the suite that said “Stark Party”. “I think the fact that something as horrible as a kiss cam exists is to blame here.”
“So, Colleen, tell me about yourself,” said Steve, forcing himself not to think about how irritating it was hearing Tony ask Doug questions he already knew the answer to, “Why’d you start working at CERN?”
“You get a lot from her, y’know,” said Steve. “Speaking as someone who’s met half of your parents. You’re less like Howard than most people think.”
We’re seeing STEVE and TONY kiss from the outside through the window. STEVE releases the curtain holder to give them some privacy, including privacy from us.
all my schematics on how to build it so he can manufacture them for every Tom, Dictator and Harry, don’t forget that,” said Tony. “And everyone in this room knows one of these things is ludicrously more powerful than the other, but it doesn’t change the fact that Justin Hammer is far too stupid to have either.”
That was a lie. Tony didn’t think it; he was sure of it. Just as sure as he was when he’d tried to talk Steve out of
Tony’s right. You and him should go to the whorehouse. That leaves Clint and Thor with the jailhouse.
Steve saw Tony’s jaw clench momentarily. “He said it reminded him of her. Which is such horse shit because it’s nothing like mom at all.”
Darcy eventually got a hold of that video of Thor singing Dancing Queen, put it on her social media, and it went viral overnight. Members of ABBA tweeted a welcome to Thor as an unofficial new member of the band "but maybe we'll stick him on drums instead of vocals." Thor did not understand any of it, or why so many people wearing tee shirts with drawings of him in funny spandex costumes started asking for pictures with him, but was thrilled nonetheless to make so many new Midgardian friends.
And that's the end! Thank you all for reading and for the very kind comments. And to the folks looking for things to do in NYC in the after times - Tony's list is also full of excellent suggestions.
“I’ve got a lot more than that in me,” he said, and his voice was low, and Tony had to remind himself not to start kissing him again.
Steve laid back in bed, and found that somehow, it was easier to drift off when he knew that somewhere in Avengers tower, Tony Stark was thinking about him too.
he was going to let Tony hide from what had happened in the lab, or take him at his word that he was ok now. There was no avoiding it: sometime soon, Tony would have to talk about his damn feelings. It would be awkward, and Steve would be gracious, and Tony would have to wait until Steve finished the “I’m flattered but” speech until he could bust out the whiskey and drink himself to oblivion. Which would undoubtedly end with Steve finding him hungover and talking to him gently about healthy coping mechanisms because he was
Tony blinked in that way that meant he’d received data that he hadn’t anticipated. It was rare to see it at all, and especially rare to see it directed at Steve, since Tony knew Steve better than he did half the time.
