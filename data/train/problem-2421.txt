John    13:08
At first, I didn't dare look at anyone in my audience. This was not something I did. My voice had never filled such a large theatre, never claimed the attention of a group of people, especially show folk. I refused to think about that, to think about anything other than making my voice carry the words.
John Watson is delightfully vocal about what he likes. He repeatedly praises Sherlock’s ability to kiss, he admires Sherlock’s appearance and tells Sherlock so, and when Sherlock kisses his throat, he moans. It is a beautiful sound; soft, high-pitched and entirely unashamed.
John finds it impossible not to giggle.
in his mind pulses through his body, and he stays. He feels more stupidly reckless than when he runs with Sherlock after murderers at night – when he feels deep in his gut that he needs to stay close to this man at any cost. Wherever Sherlock wants him to be, in whatever way Sherlock allows him to be.

We all looked at Moriarty with bated breath. He drew out the moment, pursing his lips and pulling his brows together, folding his arms across his chest and tapping at his chin. He was fully aware of holding everything we dreamed of in his hands.

Irene tore at Molly's wrist to make her follow, and Molly's face twisted in real pain. The music built, shoes scraped loudly on the floor, Molly was forced down on her knees. Sherlock left despite my desperate pleading and Moriarty's eyes were blacker than the starless sky. When love is for the highest bidder, there can be no trust; without trust, there is no love. Jealousy will blacken your mind, wind through your guts, ravage your heart. Jealousy will drive you mad.

He was looking out the window at the beautiful morning. The gold of the sun rested in his dark curls. My stomach twisted painfully.

I finally managed to look away for a moment, catching my breath. Then I looked back, and I must have smiled, because it mirrored in his eyes.

As though Sherlock Holmes and John Watson at Baker Street were an essential part of this equilibrium.

“Stop”, John gasps, blindly yanking his shirt back down, fighting not to pant too loudly. Sherlock removes his hand to lay it against the side of John's face.
We both watched his pale thumb on my tanned skin, and when I looked back up at him, there was a pained wrinkle on his forehead.
“John”, Sherlock sobs, and John speeds up his movements. Sherlock is shaking, his head falling back to make his mouth open even more, fighting for breath in short gasps. He pushes his hips up to meet John's hand, his spine arching. “John,
Sherlock chokes on his next word.
John tilts his head to the side. Looks at his own faint reflection in the dark window glass without really seeing it. He still feels warm from the nest of blankets on Sherlock's sofa. There's a quiet sort of glow in his entire body, concentrated in a little bundle inside his chest. He always feels like this when he's been with his best friend – this smiling sensation right behind his breastbone seems to belong to Sherlock.

The air was thick and heavy in there, the scents in the air were too sweet. Everything moved a little bit slower in the halls of the mill, a little bit heavier.
At the dress rehearsal, everyone was working themselves into a sweat to put it all together perfectly for one single person. Moriarty sat alone in the middle of the former dance floor. He was unmoving, watching the show with his usual mild disinterest; only when Sherlock was on stage did something spark in his eyes.
It's probably because of the silly army fantasy. But of all the inconvenient times for Sherlock's transport to make itself known, it now reacts to John's excitement as if it were of a completely different nature. John's face is illuminated by a sliver of moonlight from a crack in the door, and he is staring back at Sherlock, eyes huge and black.
John’s eyes sparkle with smugness. “You have to.”
On the fourth day of rehearsals, Sherlock was doing his best to be as unpleasant to me as he was to everyone else. But unlike everyone else, I saw through it now.
“You shouldn't be in here.” I shouldn't either – I shouldn't feel so at ease in Anderson's office, just because I was in there with this madman.

Another chapter that doesn't really have a song of its own - so if you want to listen to something while reading, I'll drop the same one as in the previous chapter:
“But it's midnight in one minute.”
“Surely you understand that if you open it, you will not have to ask me that question, John.”
Do you think it would feel better if you knew?
“Oh, John, John, you cannot possibly expect me to take an interest in this.”
The rule not to touch each other between the legs feels at once a little blurry, with Sherlock pressed against John’s thigh and John digging into Sherlock’s belly. But rules are rules. And though his body is screaming at him to break them, Sherlock feels safe knowing that John knows. He will not be overwhelmed by a hand suddenly cupping him, or stressed by the idea that he should do something for John. No; this is good.

A frown appeared on his forehead when his breath cut off. My own windpipe closed up in terror when I watched him struggle to do something as traitorously simple as breathing. I would have given him my own breath if I knew how, but all I could do was breathe his name.
When I've finished eating I close my eyes against the friendly sunlight. My mother has left the garden, but Harriet is still sitting on the grass among the discarded flowers.

“Sherlock”, I breathed, crawling onto the bed on my knees and gathering him into my arms. He clutched me, muscles trembling with the effort, and buried his drenched face in my shoulder.
Holmes sighed, the way you do when speaking to an obtuse child. Sherlock's face was stone when he stared back at his brother.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock's head was thrown back, and it was increasingly hard for him not to moan. I dropped my mouth to his throat, gasping for air, both of us losing coordination, fumbling, trembling, grinding. “Come on, John.” His voice was rough and deep.
“Then I'll stay late.”
“It seems she does”, I say.
It's the sixth of August!”

We start walking in time with the music, stepping on the first and third beat. Soling Jacob has begun to play one of my favourite tunes from Ore;
The room was larger than the last dressing room, but it was obviously furnished for one person only. There were spotless mirrors hanging on the walls, dressing tables overflowing with expensive-looking bottles and jars, and a large walk-in closet for Sherlock's costumes. A bed was half-hidden behind heavy, cream-coloured drapes, and there was a bolstered chair in red satin. There were small tables and pedestals with sculptures and picture frames, and on every available surface, there were bouquets of fresh red roses.
When the paediatrician was finished with her I installed her in the baby carrier. John took a picture of us – again awakening a desperation in me at the priceless value of this photo that didn't even exist a second ago – before he rushed to his own doctor's appointment.
“Fine”, he snarls.
No one was moving, really, and still everything was happening, pulsing between our bodies, the heat becoming more intimate, the sweat making our skin sticky, quickening breathing. My hands went into his hair, purposely messing it up. This is

“Stamford, what imbecile did you allow to arrange the backing instruments?” Sherlock demanded. Molly looked relieved at not being the target of his antics.
“Thank you for making it worth it”, John murmurs and closes his mouth around Sherlock's lower lip.

He slowly leaned down, brushing his smooth cheek against mine ever so softly. I could barely breathe, but I heard his breath in my ear, steady and familiar. When he sang, his voice was so quiet it nearly disappeared in the air.

“I thought you were a genius.”
They fall silent. Sherlock slowly raises his hands, lets the palms meet before his chest, then brings them lightly to his chin.
She is thirty minutes old and remarkably light in my hands. Five pounds and eight ounces, give or take. Markedly below the average birth weight, although still within the normal range. But learning a fact is one thing; experiencing it with my own senses is a different matter entirely.
“Yes”, he whispered. “I've known it from the moment I saw you. I have been looking for you my whole life.”
There was no answer, though I heard something above me. I went to the golden heart-shaped ornament at the front, for the first time peering up at the stairs rising to the sides. I stepped onto them, climbing the side of the elephant's head. I realised how incredibly high this animal really was when the ground stretched out below me, only a thin handrail there to ensure my safety.

Holmes' face was a mask of indifference, but his eyes never left me. “It is now severely threatened, due to the Dancer's choice”, I said. “But it was in fact a corrupted kingdom that used and abused people like him. The Evil Maharajah takes the kingdom down, but the Hindu Dancer and the Penniless Sitar-Player are now free to live in art and in love”, I finished.
I looked at Holmes and saw that for quite possibly the first time in his life, he was rendered speechless.
Sherlock turned back to the mirror, starting to sculpt his errant curls. “I never cared about the Moulin Rouge.”
“Oh. I suppose you could.”
It was intoxicating, being with him on stage when he embodied my words. What he did with them was so much more than I could have imagined when I wrote them. It must take tremendous work, yet seemed effortless – and so, I followed him effortlessly over the stage.
For the duration of the meeting, he kept leaning in to whisper deductions about the men around the table. I was too amazed by his sharp mind to tell him to stop, and his pleased expression every time I laughed was one I suddenly couldn't do without.

I glanced at the paper in his hand. “It's yours. The one you composed at university.” I hummed the chorus, and he slowly grinned.
First of all, I hope you saw the other news. The news that the police finally worked out that he was innocent. Everything I've said on this blog has been the truth and now everyone knows it. I just want to take a minute to thank those who commented on here saying that they still believed in him. It really helped.

A thrill went through me. Sherlock went first on the staircase, allowing me a devastating view of his behind working under tight suit trousers. When we reached the fourth floor, he yanked my door open and pulled me inside. He closed the door behind me in the same movement that crowded me against it, his mouth hot on mine before I had so much as taken a breath.
“See? Your hands are minuscule.”

“Oh, yes. Many years ago now. The early Moulin Rouge days. I had a regular who was causing me trouble. Violent man, you see, John.

John asks, because he can be very dim sometimes.
At the next brush of fingers over his nipple, John has to stifle a moan.
Everyone was singing. Sherlock and Molly stood before each other, arms stretched out, voices gleaming above the orchestra: “
When I approached, I recognised Moriarty. They were watching the rehearsal on stage, both looking bored. Sherlock's eyes were sharply painted with black, which made him look unapproachable and frail at the same time. He didn't move a muscle when I passed them by, not even a flicker of his eyes. Something undefinable in the air between their two bodies made me stop myself from walking up to greet him.

John closes his eyes and bites his lip. Sherlock almost moans; he has never seen anything sexier.

I know now for certain that William and I will dance together forever.

We sit on a tussock and watch the sunset. The colours in the sky are constantly changing, and just when I think it can't get any more beautiful, it does. For the most part we don't speak, but the space between us is everything but silent.

It feels like a bold claim to wear this thing in public. Everyone who sees me will believe me to be a new father.
Sherlock barely has time to reach out, his hands grasping blindly at whatever part of John they encounter (jacket and shoulder) before John sinks to his knees. Sherlock nearly falls backwards with the surge of lust rolling through him. He catches himself with his hands in John's hair; then he must immediately let go with his right hand, stuffing the fist into his mouth to prevent a groan when John's tongue presses flat against his frenulum.

The second day, I went over to the Moulin Rouge with a spring in my step. I wanted more time with Sherlock, to see him act, to see him smile. Yes, he had been difficult to get to the day before, but I was hoping that I had passed some test and earned his respect.
Slipping the braces back onto my shoulder, I took a step back. The space between us could be felt like a physical thing, and I could almost see him eye it.
“You…” I trailed off, not even finding poetry to tell him how I felt. “Sherlock-”
“John.” He looked as if he wanted to say more. But it was enough, really, the way he said my name.
This one happens without much warning.
They haven't stopped touching for a second. Getting into the cab was awkward, and for a moment the only point of contact was their hands. John got in first, then gripped Sherlock's hand hard while he ducked into his seat. They slid together, each shrinking their body to hide in the arms of the other.
I went up on my toes to stroke his hair with my cheek, then back down to feel his smooth cheek against mine. My breath speeded up at the smell of the skin below his ear. The embrace had turned into something else while I wasn't paying attention, our bodies moving slightly against each other, our hands caressing firmly over backs and shoulders and arms.
Sherlock slips away down the hall. John shivers on the worn leather of the sofa.

“No one must see you”, he added quietly.
Sherlock is still holding on tightly to the ropes, and John's hands slide down until they cover his. John smiles, a smile as fresh as the rainy air and as sweet as the bird cherry, and he leans down. The kiss tastes like his smile.
I didn't even spare a glance of kindness at the girls begging for my money. There was nothing left that I cared about, apart from finding out if Sherlock was telling the truth. I had to know. So I returned to the Moulin Rouge, one last time.
“John?”
“You're welcome.” He raised his eyebrows, smiled sarcastically and then turned to leave.
I didn't realise it was the last time I would see him look so light and careless. But nonetheless I must have savoured it, because I can still remember his face with crystal clarity. That uncomplicated joy in his smile, and his eyes radiant when looking at me.

“You okay?” I finally asked.
Sherlock fell with a last panicked gasp for breath. He could not be awoken minutes later when he was found with his arms awkwardly sprawled and his cheek pressed to the carpet.

It is the sweetest New Year's Eve of John Watson's life. At ten a.m., he is woken up by a soft kiss to his lips and a smooth whisper in his ear:
John looks up. “Who?”
John smiles, and Sherlock stares at his mouth. He wishes he had more data to create the perfect event in his mind. Then he could file it away, visit it when he pleased and remain undisturbed in the rest of the palace. No risk of John jumping out to interrupt him with infuriatingly rudimentary kisses in the middle of work.

His silk stockings were so soft, I couldn't resist putting my cheek to his inner thigh to feel them. His hips arched upward a bit and his breath stuttered. Encouraged, I put my mouth against the thin fabric, breathing into it. He made a breathy sound above me. By the time I had gotten his shoes off, my face was at the hem of his skirt and his breath came in short gasps. I massaged his soft, stocking-clad feet while I tilted my face forward, the bridge of my nose bumping the lowest button of his dress, and I inhaled deeply. The scent of his hidden arousal made my head foggy and we moaned at the same time.

He blinked owlishly at me, at a loss in the face of my unpredictable reaction. When he laid out his train of reasoning for me, I shook my head in awe.

“Sherlock, wait!” I called again, just when he was about to start on the next flight of stairs.
She has another boy inside, then. If I'm being honest with myself it's probably Mura Bill, going by the number of dances they shared yesterday. I guess I just didn't want to admit it to myself; I didn't want to let go of the raspberry dreams that kept me sane this winter.
I opened my mouth to argue, but Gregory was faster.
“You said that I’m your best friend.”
I stop before John. His eyes sear into mine for a moment. Just as is the case with his daughter, I am equally terrified of looking back and of looking away. Then it's over and his gaze drops to the bundle in my arms.
“So a romantic relationship with me is not entirely off the table for you”, he summarises.
Arms touching
Hey, what's up?
“What-”, John manages to say before Sherlock sucks in a breath, his speech coming out with new force to deliver the final deduction, while his hand tightens around John's. And that's when John decides to give up trying to understand any of this and just go with it. Sherlock springs into motion, and John secures his grip on his hand when they run off from the crime scene.
Every step would pound on my head. Tilted world. Nausea. Everything was sharp and bright, ringing and screeching in my ears from when I hit my head. I don't remember when or how I fell, doesn't matter. His name would repeat itself in my ears, maybe on my tongue. Sherlock. Oh, Christ. SherlockSherlocksherlockshrelocKShelock
Sherlock slowly shakes his head. “No. Too fast.”
I didn't even turn my eyes away from the screen when I told him, calmly, as the fact that it is.
The air in my flat was easy, shimmering with untold stories. It was one of those moments when I knew that if I sat down at my typewriter, writing would be effortless; simply a matter of plucking those stories from the air and letting my hands shape them.
It feels strange. The entire capacity of Sherlock's mind is occupied trying to catalogue the sensations and his heart keeps hammering nervously. A pair of lips touching his, and it feels like… well, exactly like a pair of lips against his lips. It's new and somewhat confusing; he had, perhaps irrationally, expected something else. When John withdraws, Sherlock leans in again to see if it feels different this time, but no. Still clumsy, and with a whiff of morning breath.
He has to say something. Sherlock doesn't know what he's doing right now. It's probably an experiment, and as with other experiments, it's John who has to tell him when he's taken on something too dangerous.

Sherlock's body pressing against him is familiar and new at the same time. The tall man ducks his head to tuck it by John's neck, letting himself be held. He fits in John's arms better than he should. Delicate hands slide lightly up to John's shoulder blades, and John feels the tension easing out of his shoulders.

Sherlock’s finger is tracing the skin of John’s belly, just above the waistband of his pants. John’s skin shivers under the touch. His spine is arched and he bites his lip. He looks deliciously wanton when he does that.
Adorably confused, huh?
Just for a moment, Sherlock's stride paused and his posture yielded. His hand shot up involuntarily to clutch his chest as he gasped for breath. At once, he was mortal and vulnerable in front of the relentless suits. The music hesitated, the dancers faltered, and Holmes' eyes flashed in fear from the front row. But then the moment passed, Sherlock's painted lips curled in a cocky smile, his arms reached sensuously up above his head and he started to sing.

I feel like I have no skin. Everything is too bright and too harsh. Hurting my insides.
The fifth year, John is so furious that he decides to make the biggest mistake of his life. He marries a woman right before the eyes of the love of his life. Then he punishes himself for it by listening to Sherlock give the most soul-baring love declaration of all time, in front of everyone John knows (except for Harry, who makes a point of not supporting the idiocy). Well, he didn't know Sherlock would say all those things, so he didn't exactly inflict that particular punishment on himself. He most definitely did inflict it on Sherlock, though, and he tries to feel that they are even.
But there is something about the bus' steady movement through the night that makes John's thoughts linger there. With Sherlock pressed against him, panting and laughing. Familiar and new; a body that Sherlock has grown into but that John hasn't gotten to know. Hard, trembling muscles as Sherlock struggles to get the upper hand. Clavicles that cast shadows over the base of Sherlock's neck. Hipbones that cut into John's thighs. Secret places of softness hidden around the waist of Sherlock's lean body.

When he entered Sherlock's dressing room, Sherlock was lying on the bed. Whoever had helped carry him there had been chased away by Martha. She had managed to get him out of his suit and into a soft dressing gown; faint pink over his pale, almost grey skin. He was drenched in sweat, and his lips were almost as blanched as his complexion.

advantage of that.
Greg snorts. “Karma's a bitch.”
“When there was a female person in the way.” His voice doesn't sound quite as impassive as it aims to be.
The kiss deepens slowly. The scent of Sherlock's air makes John forget there is anything at all in the world other than this beautiful man. He is warm and endlessly soft under John's lips, so very present and alive though there is barely a breath to be heard over the murmur of the engine. The unreal night light creates a spell that makes John want to hold still to stay in it; in the quietness, the stillness that allows them to be all alone at the back of the bus.
When they moved in, the garden was a mess; overgrown bushes, dead branches and weeds everywhere. Sherlock has not had time to tidy it, and it has been a silent worry of his; that the bees will not like it here and choose to leave before he can get properly started with them. But now most of the wild bushes are gone. Instead there are flower beds; neat sections of small plants, and stretches of fresh soil waiting to be used. There is a spade and a black plastic bag lying on one of them, where John is clearly still working on getting rid of the weeds.
Sometimes he's still surprised to find himself standing on both feet, away from that poor bedsit he'd thought he would die in. He didn't think he'd ever recognise himself as John Watson again. But it's as if Sherlock's eyes not only see everything, but also have the capacity to bring everything to life. John recognises himself, and when talking to Sherlock, he even
I suppose we both are. I suppose that's the point.
Sherlock ponders it for a minute. “Difficult to say. Too little data. I do admit that the incident with Moriarty changed things. Forcing myself not to care about people obviously didn’t work; I cared anyway, and it showed. And when I was away…” He glances at John. “I missed you. I never want to be without you again.”
Tonight I just need you to sit with me and eat
His head bowed deeper, his quiet chuckle hot on my cheek. I swayed closer by accident, he turned, and then his lips were on mine.
Um, that was a bad opening, sorry.
Once again, Sherlock altered the words. He made them even more true, showing me that he meant them for us, for me, for now. He held the last tone, his beautiful voice filling all the space in the hall and in my chest. He broke off in a gasp for air, folding forwards in pain. But he straightened again, his voice hoarse but still more clear than anything:
An overcast night on Bart's roof.
It felt almost unbearably good; his lush mouth sliding around me, the velvety skin of Sherlock on my tongue, the proof of his desire hot and hard. I couldn't stop moaning around him, and I had to let go to gasp for air when he gently suckled at me. I forced myself to dive back in, seized with a need to take him with me.

“Well”, he said, inspecting the pictures on the wall even as he addressed Sherlock. “Here we are at last. You and me, my little Virgin, and our problem – the final problem.”
Silent words passed between us. I didn't understand them, I only knew that they were vitally important.
He leads John in the direction of the village inn. John is too tired to question where they are going, missing the fact that Sherlock is currently being considerate.
When he's finished, Sherlock still hasn't appeared. John sets up the movie and then backs into the sofa. He happens to land almost in the middle. Well, it's a fairly long sofa.

Good. Okay.
How like a Watson to spring into my life and change everything simply by existing.
But I of all people should know that heaven and hell lie close to one another. I have been in hell and stumbled straight into heaven, nothing in between to prepare me for the transition. I had given up on goodness, but found an angel hidden in the sinful underworld of a foreign land, disguised as a demon.
I slowly kissed the pale throat offered to me. The breath kept stopping in his chest before rushing out with barely-voiced sounds. The lighter my kisses, the more his hips squirmed. Hands fumbled with clothes; he slipped one of the braces from my shoulder, undid a few buttons of my shirt before he could bend down and suck at my trapezius muscle. I tugged his shirt out of his trousers, sneaking my hands in under it, and when I brushed over a nipple, a whimper escaped him louder than the ones before.
In that moment, I could see my whole life with crystal clarity. All I knew about the world was

During the first tune I can barely bring myself to let us out of the spin, so sensational does it feel. The tune ends and I grab William's hand from the back of my shoulder, spinning him out of my embrace and letting him twirl under my arm.
My head snapped up when a long-legged figure crossed the room. Sherlock was still in his red silk shirt – which I hoped meant that he wasn't about to go and seduce some faceless man for money.

I felt it. It can't be real, but I felt it, I saw, I. Stick to the facts, Watson. One cannot reason without facts. Fact: Hehad no pulse.
John wasn't prepared for how much stronger Sherlock would be now that they've grown up. He didn't have time to think through the possibility that Sherlock would fight back and they'd end up wrestling on the couch.
John's hands stroke down his arms to show that he means it literally.

After our fourth dance together, she looks up into my eyes. The moment stretches and has suddenly gone on for too long, and red spots appear on her cheeks.
The relief is so overwhelming I can't stand it. It's the most beautiful human being, once again gracing the earth with his presence. It's the missing part of my heart slotting back into place. It's the most vital, strong, living body

High heels clicked against the hardwood dance floor when Sherlock hurried through the room, his long coat billowing unbuttoned around the purple dress. He was alone for the first time that day, but by the looks of it, he wouldn't be for much longer.
“What problems do you predict?”
The earth blooms with an abundance that almost seems too much. The sun shines every day of July, making the days too hot for wearing shirts. I swim in the lake several times a day, and the water is so warm that you can stay in it for hours if you want to. Everything seems to blossom now, in every colour of the rainbow, and every day there are enough ripe strawberries in the garden to make a strawberry pastry.
“Everyone knows”, he went on. “Mycroft knows.”
The first year, John finally understands why he is alive in this time and in this space. The universe rights itself and he is suddenly home. The days rush by, Sherlock rushes from crime scene to crime scene, and John spins around him, hardly able to believe Sherlock is real.
Moriarty smiled around a frown. “You're just getting that now? Not much of a genius, after all.”
And they both know what he means.
The insult didn't hold any bite, and I just shook my head at him.
you jumped. And after.
“Don't say his name.” My breaths were short and painful.
John's lips immediately part to nip at Sherlock's lower lip, and very soon there is a hint of teeth as well. All of a sudden John is in complete control of the situation, and Sherlock is an awkward mess, simply gaping and hoping John will guide him right. And oh, he does. His little soldier holds him steady with hands locked in his curls, and his mouth is – is –
When I can almost hear him whimper I let him go, resting my forehead on his breastbone. William gasps for breath beneath me. I fight not to groan in frustration and wait quietly for the fire within me to fade – enough for us to start all over again.

It looked really bad for me earlier tonight. I was wrestled to the ground and I knew she had a knife. After seeing all of her victims, I didn't hold out too much hope that she would let me get away with minor injuries.
“You were acting… I don't know. Mycroft has told me- I thought maybe…”
And I have gone from heaven back into hell in the blink of an eye. It almost seems inevitable that such a perfect moment is precisely when it would all end.
John looks into Sherlock's familiar face, trying to erase half a night of concerns.
That meagre body, just barely containing its breakable heart, sleeping on dirty cobblestones, safe for only as long as Mycroft could ensure it. Every time he disappeared, every time he came back, every time he danced confidently and every time he smiled insecurely, Mycroft's ribcage threatened to crack right open. He could never keep up, he could never understand, he could never do enough. How do you protect something that is too good for this world?
“Then why risk it?” Sherlock says. “It’s good the way things are now. We could just-”
John turns away to fill the tea balls. “You could have just said 'no', you know. Just. Sometimes. Leave it alone.”
Sherlock    13:10
Dear John,
“No one has touched me like this before”, Sherlock hears himself say. The pleasure cocktail has dismantled his brain-to-mouth-filter.

An involuntary smile pulls at Sherlock's lips. He can't help it; can't help hearing the words in John's voice; can't help liking every word John chooses no matter how insignificant, even stupid; can't help loving whatever John does.

Sherlock rose from his chair, letting the script fall onto the seat with a decisive snap. With his back turned, he missed the pained expression on Holmes' face.
Sherlock kisses like he's been on the edge of the world a million times.
“Hello”, I smiled politely, looking over her shoulder to Sherlock's retreating figure. His back moved beautifully under the braces as he walked.
(yes, really - you can head over there to read the lines in the language they're actually spoken. I highly recommend it even if you (like me) don't speak the language - it's sexy as hell!).
“Are you ready?”
I've been trying to sleep, Mary told me to calm down and to rest but I can’t, because I just see him falling, he's forever falling, and his rainbow eyes are unseeing and there's blood all over me.

Her eyes narrowed, and she glanced at me in disdain before closing the door.
I watched their backs from a corner of the hall. It was the first any of us had seen of Moriarty in weeks – he hadn't visited since that day when I first took Sherlock home with me. His expression as he watched the rehearsal was bored, bordering on disgusted.
His eyes landed on Martha, blinking until she came into focus. She smiled at him, trying with all her might not to look worried. “There's my boy”, she whispered.
Sherlock    13:51
“No, don't  ”
John walks over and places a hand on the hot skin of his neck. Sherlock's head falls back the way it always does, the way it always has done. John leans down and gives him a kiss, and everything slots into place like the last piece of a thousand-piece puzzle, finally bringing the picture into harmony. It's the ultimate culmination of everything he's always been aching for – and even then, it's not enough.
I know.
Sherlock stretches his neck and gives John a quick kiss on the mouth. Then he goes back to his scrutiny of the sock lying limply in his hand.
I've danced with Täpp Lisa quite a few times. We have found each other in the dance by now, have each learned how the other's body moves. She is lovely within the circle of my arms. Her back feels delicate beneath the palm of my hands, and the smell of her hair is sweet. Her feet move in flawless time with mine. I let us spin for the duration of an entire polska just to see if we can; we don't lose our balance even once. Over her shoulder, I watch the red of her skirt flowing beautifully behind her.

“This is Anderson's office.”
And you are a practical man.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asks.
“I'm never wrong. Why else would he bother with all this?”
He doesn't need to tell anyone how he's addicted to Sherlock's hair. How thick and smooth it is when it swallows his fingers, and the way Sherlock melts in his arms when John's fingertips brush his scalp. The way Sherlock's breath becomes just loud enough for it to feel as if he breathes for them both.
supposed to? Because you didn't either.
“Mmm”, Sherlock answers, or maybe it was an ill-concealed moan. John huffs a silent laugh – he'd almost forgotten how responsive Sherlock is, how endearingly pliant under the slightest touch.
The novelty of a challenge has never failed to capture me. My blood starts moving through my veins with purpose, my muscles settle into a warm, prepared state, my lungs breathe evenly. I'm the most reliable when I'm just a little bit out of my depth. That was what the first week at the Moulin Rouge was like for me, and it made me calm.
“Sherlock. I need to talk to you.”
The circle of actors broke into a round of spontaneous applause, and I looked up, finding them all turned to me. I nodded solemnly, accepting the praise I still hadn't learned to expect.

Sherlock stood before the three-piece mirror in his dressing room. He was fully dressed in his slim coat, a black top hat, and gloves. His make-up was thick, making his face intimidating with hard black eyes, ghostly white skin, and blood-red lips. He dabbed at his chin with a handkerchief to wipe away a stubborn, stray tear.
“I, er… I'd prefer to do it standing.”
Tonight, his leg could carry him through another crazy chase through alleys, stairwells and rooftops. Tonight, his hands are hot and rock steady when he digs into his food.
I grinned. “You're welcome, love.”
His eyes flicked back and forth between mine, then he cleared his throat. “I suppose I could.” It was the first words he had spoken to me since the elephant, and the rough vibrations of it made me shiver. “I should be able to schedule a meeting tomorrow morning-”
On the threshold, Moriarty turned to him one last time. “It will be beyond your imagination, Virgin. Daddy promises!” The door shut behind him.
But there was no other way. And really, he had known it all along. He had known it his whole life. Creatures of the underworld couldn't afford to love.
John is moaning too. “God, Sherlock… You know what?”
, I remember saying, startled by my deduction.
His hand is the only thing I can hold on to and feel safe. I wish I could have done that always.
“I also do not think that I will wish to touch everywhere.”
I tried not to look like a man who had just been chosen, once more, by the most dreamlike creature walking the earth. “I'm sorry”, I offered, and walked out of the building.
John looks down at her in his lap.

Stamford must catch my reaction to these words even as I try to hide it, because he goes on to congratulate me as well.
Sherlock took a last step forward, pressing his forehead against mine as if trying to push reason into my brain. “It changes nothing”, he murmured. His piercing eyes were all I could see.

Sherlock looks around as if surprised to see the mess. “Oh. I had to dig up some research.” He waves his hand dismissively.
“Clearly”, he cut me off, taking a few steps away from me and leaning against the wall. “Neither you nor I have money to sustain ourselves.”
Sherlock turned around. His eyes had a hard edge, that intense quality that always seemed to burn holes into me right down to my soul. “John, there's no point! Just leave.”
“Well?” Greger is on me when I leave the dance floor. “Did you find out if she has someone else?”
John    14:14
, he writes and swallows the humiliation.
“Of course”, Sherlock said, trying hard to sound business-like enough to preserve his dignity. “We will be right there.”
He glanced at me while he sang, his face hovering inside Moriarty's personal space. I was at the door now, thanking God for the well-oiled handle when I twisted it. I looked over my shoulder and froze.
Two hours and another two untouched cups of tea later, the front door opens and closes. John stumbles up from the sofa, hearing the familiar clicking of posh shoes on the steps to 221B. He throws the door open just when Sherlock reaches the top of the stairs.
“Gregory, I need you to walk slower. Look at him, you want to have him, you want to conquer him – yes, that's it, okay Sherlock, go again.”
Sherlock's façade slipped and his face hardened. He couldn't resist getting a jab back: “Well, it certainly took you long enough”, he spat. Next second, he could have bitten off his own tongue.
As we speak, we watch the couples dance by. It's quite the funny little schottis tune Soling Jacob's playing, and I see Mikael try to spin and laugh so hard he cries at the same time. All this talking about dancing has my feet tingling and longing to move.
We talked that night about everything that had happened. About the fall; about what came after. He forgave me. He didn't say as much out loud, but I could see on his face the moment it happened. He understood. And he saw that I understood him as well. If he needed my forgiveness for marrying a person who wanted me dead, I am certain that he similarly found it on my face.
It's almost finished, now. The script is spread out around me on my narrow bed. On the pages, I can see a sea of red and white rose petals, I can see the back of heavy red curtains, I can see Sherlock dressed in white and gold. Remembering joy hurts a thousand times more than remembering pain.
“Because it’s nice.”
I forced myself to feel it. To see him for all that he is. He is the man I met in the lab somewhere below us, five years ago. He is the wonder I couldn't take my eyes off with the powdered sugar on his nose and the night sky in his eyes. He is the person I shared everything with for a brief eternity of our lives. He is the one who stood on this roof, cried and told me farewell, he is the one who lay on the pavement in a pool of someone else's blood. He is someone who was imprisoned for months, afraid to die while everyone thought he was dead already, because no-one would notice and so no-one would care. He is the shell of a human being who came back.

Sherlock stepped inside with an air of finality. There was no light flirting this time, no funny tricks. His black dress reached the floor, with a slit on the side of the skirt showing off his stocking-clad leg. His face was concealed by a black veil, and his head was tipped back.
Warmth. Racing heart. Calm smile on my lips.
The coughing slowly subsided, but Sherlock's breath was still loud in the empty room. His brain felt overheated with how furiously it worked to find a way out – or it might have been the fever.

John's hand gently squeezes his thigh and he leans in towards Sherlock. Sherlock instinctively meets him halfway. The kiss is soft and slow, almost unbearably so.
You're forgetting the SH in the end.
Sherlock appears in the doorway seconds later, pausing for a brief second, eyeing John. Then he silently pads over, and John has to hide his smile. Not once has John had to insist that Sherlock shows up here tonight.
“So we have already started doing that thing we wanted to be very sure about before we did?” Sherlock says.
I should have known, and deep inside I
It was raining all day. Nothing Christmassy about it, except for the few decorations Mrs Hudson has managed to sneak in. It was nice not to give it too much attention. It was nice just to spend the day with him, solving a crossword puzzle and ask him for help now and then, listening to his violin. To get to have a peaceful Christmas, without bottles all over the coffee table and painful phone calls I answered just so no one would worry enough to come over.

“Yeah. Everything is fine.”
I was there in the tower with them, and everything I saw and heard was the truth. What was my humble song in comparison to a hundred diamonds decorating Sherlock's beautiful neck? I couldn't blame him if he changed his mind.
“With…?”
Right now you're at the desk scrolling on your laptop. Your skin is pale, your hair is still ruffled from your pillow, your lips are demanding a lot more attention than I'm really willing to give. You're not asking what I'm writing. Maybe it's transparent. Maybe it's unimportant.
“Mm”, Sherlock managed, still breathing heavily from the cough. Martha subtly lingered to make sure he was stable before she left.
“You still do not know whether you will fall for me. And I…” Sherlock closes his eyes. “I fear I will fall for you quite spectacularly if this goes too far.”
“John.” It was a plea, and I smiled breathlessly, glancing down to see his teeth digging into his lower lip.
The three strangers in the group have apparently not seen John since their university days and spend a few tedious moments catching up. Before long, though, Stamford takes the conversation in a new direction by peering at the baby in my arms.

to you right now.
“Yes it is”, I said, holding his gaze. “It's not about the daring clothes or the- the sultry act, or even the performance, if that's what you think. I like you. I think- I think we could like each other.”
Sherlock knew exactly what rooms would be deserted at that hour. He led me into the depth of the elephant, through short cuts and strange angles behind curtains. Coming from a different direction, it took me a while to realise where I was when we burst into the head chamber.
(See the end of the chapter for

“Right, well, the Evil Maharajah finally understands how deep their love is, and he uses his final weapon to pull them apart. He forces the Hindu Dancer to make the Penniless Sitar-Player think he doesn't love her. She is led to believe that it was all an act, that he was courting her as the prostitute he is.” Sherlock's face was soft when he watched me getting excited over the scene I had just written. “
Sherlock is the stormy London night personified. His coat is flaring out like a mantle, fusing with the darkness, and his hair is bounding as if in wild euphoria, messing up his styling but making him look irresistibly alive. His legs are criminally long, and it's a bloody good thing John happens to be a soldier and knows how to run.
Sherlock didn't turn his head. “Can't.” His voice dropped back to its normal, clipped nature.
The forty-third year is spent in constant travel between the lodge, Rosie's house and the hospital. Their lungs are narrow with fear and coated with nausea, and everything is reduced into what is needed to survive.

Sherlock's leg slides in between John's thighs to yank his leg closer to Sherlock, and John changes his position a bit. When he feels Sherlock's body slowly give in against his, his own anxiety drains out of him, leaving him wrung out. Sherlock pulls his head back and John finally loosens his death grip on his shirt, putting his hand at the base of Sherlock's skull. His hair feels different when it's damp. Silky and cool.
I was standing on my balcony, staring over at the Moulin Rouge and trying not to worry, not yet.

boring, and you'll be dashing, I promise.
“We are all relying on you, Sherlock”, Holmes said. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “If he invests, I will be able to transform the Moulin Rouge into a theatre, and I can put you on stage with a real show, with a real audience. With a patron like him, you could become-”
It takes less than a minute. He's vaguely aware that he's making pathetic whimpering sounds in the echoing room. When he tips over, it seems to last for an eternity.
After some time, the door opened and in came Gregory and Molly. Sherlock's eyes flickered to me, and I gave him a tiny, reassuring nod before standing up to greet them. The practice session turned slowly into a party when bottles were opened and glasses clinked. Sherlock was looking increasingly surprised at the kindness he was shown by the others, eyes again searching mine. I smiled back at him, wanting to crush him into my arms and tell him he was allowed this, wanting to give him the world until he believed it was truly his.
“I can't believe you're this much of a romantic. I love you”, John blurts.
“It should heal well. You were lucky.”
Sherlock turned to Stamford, and in doing so, accidentally caught my eye. I was trying my damnedest not to smile.
“With reason.”
He doesn't. But John must feel something of the same, because on the landing his hand settles briefly on Sherlock's hip.
“You shouldn't be here, John.” He didn't bother to look at me any more. “Just leave”, he added over his shoulder when he entered the hallway.
They rent a car to avoid the crowds on the train. John drives.
When she smiled, I recognised the dancer who had tried to invite me onto the dance floor before. Before, when I still needed my cane; before, when I had never seen a glimpse of Sherlock – it already seemed as if that had been another John Watson.
“Yeah, but then you would lose your super hearing skills and no longer be the world's best consulting detective.”
“Oh”, he said, taken aback, and made to rise from the bed.
When they get to the village, it turns out that even the case is dull. Sherlock lashes out left and right; he is blunt to clients, disrespectful to police officers, terrifying to suspects and rude to John. John cleans up his mess as usual, grumbling and brilliant, and they are finished by nightfall.
Sherlock    10:26
“I'm sure I will”, she said, stepping closer to me. Sherlock was still being held up by the woman, but he squirmed under her arm, and once, he cast a furtive glance at me. In a hurry to get away from me, then – that wouldn't do.
“They're recently changed.”
“You hadn't promised me anything, John”, Sherlock says, lifting his head.
You can't do this, you can never bloody do
It was so good a performance, so close to the Sherlock he had once tried to fool me that he was, that I felt an irrational twist of worry. He sauntered down the stairs, exaggerating the movement of his hips from side to side when he slowly drew closer to Moriarty.
The fireworks take off in the London night, casting dramatic colours over their rooms. John goes into the kitchen and pours himself a drink, then walks over to the living room window to watch the colourful sky.
And then I came back. You should too. You
He stopped right before Sherlock. The edge of the table behind Sherlock dug into his lower back in his efforts to keep a distance.
He has fought for so long. I could cry at the strength he possesses, the sheer will to live. He hasn't given up even when all odds have been against him.
Sherlock doesn't seem prepared to do anything in order to get into bed, so John sets to work on his shirt buttons. When he slides the fabric off Sherlock's shoulders, it strikes him how vulnerable Sherlock is. He is barely conscious, and his miles of pale skin shine in the darkness of the bedroom.

“Fine”, I say, and William grins and sits up abruptly in my bed. “But you have to be quiet or you'll wake-”
, I realised that Sherlock's studious displeasure was all an act.
Sitting down, Sherlock's whole body tilted to the right as if trying to soak up the glow from the little soldier beside him.
John carries Sherlock’s suitcase into their bedroom, and when he comes back, Sherlock feels strangely off-kilter. His hands tingle with want to reach out and touch John, but somehow he doesn’t quite know how to do it. John leads him to the bathroom to show off the finished renovations, and Sherlock tries to stand tall and aloof when all he wants is to creepup behind John and wind his arms around the sturdy little torso.
“It's the dialogue
He nodded and tried to smile. I looked into his eyes one last time, and realised that he was waiting for
“Imagine”, he murmurs, “you and I, coming home after a case. A really good one. I’ve used my gun, and you’ve been absolutely brilliant. I’ve been looking at you all day, how sexy you are with your coat collar and your cheekbones… Mrs Hudson is out, and we know she won’t get back until late.”
Sherlock must feel the same, because he tips his head back and breathes. His long, loud exhalation shoots through John's body like a shock. John holds Sherlock's wrists against the cushion above his head, but Sherlock has stopped fighting back. He still twists and turns, but there's something restless in his movements now. His body undulates up towards John, as if to get closer instead of getting away.
“Ah. Me neither.”
Sherlock looked up again, his eyes at once young and a hundred years old, his lips shakily parting around a silent breath.
He hastily put his coat on and opened the door. But he halted in the doorway, half-turning, showing me the sharp profile of his face.
Your Sherlock

Everything has slowed down enough that I catch sight of myself in the mirror above the fireplace.
Sherlock is banging on the door, more and more desperately.
kiss, Sherlock… Oh, god, are you actually made for me?”
“John, are you showering?”
“Mm?” John asks, drawing patterns on Sherlock's scalp with his fingertips. Sherlock was right (of course he was); John has longed to touch his hair. Sherlock has longed for it too; and yet now that he has it, he isn't sure whether to relax and get used to the sensation, or to avoid giving in to it and letting it distract him from his train of thought.
When we sat together at the dinner table, we both stared at a changed man; I didn't like to dwell on what he saw, but
I'm staring at the words but it doesn't help. It doesn't make it real. Seeing him, now that would make it real.

As I am writing this, you are asleep beside me; your nose is pressed against my hip in a rather endearing way. Gladstone is asleep on top of my feet. A need for structuring my thoughts has me wishing for my violin, but as neither of you would let me move away at the moment, I will attempt your strategy: writing.
“Sure.”
“Just stunning, dear. You go on apply some of that lipstick again – I'll sneak a peek at the stage.”
In the end, Sherlock cannot resist the purple shirt and the tight trousers. John is attracted to him; friends or not, Sherlock wants to see it on his face, just once.
It was impossible not to keep touching him. To feel his arms, his shoulders, his hot neck, his soft hair with the intact skull. It was impossible not to press his body to mine; I wanted to absorb his shallow breaths, the heartbeats that quaked his chest, his warmth. I clutched at his neck, breathing hard into his shoulder with open mouth. His hands were splayed across my back, pressing me against him.
The audience laughs. One point to William, then.
Once, a few months ago, there was a knock on my door. I took far too long to answer – I was not in a good state that morning – but when I did, I found a paper bag of baked goods. I really don't know who in Paris would leave me those if not her – Stamford would have barged into my flat regardless of my state, so it wasn't him.
happening again or anything.
You went to see a MURDER SUSPECT.
“Of what?”
“You’re forgetting that I love the Work too. Best thing I know in the world is working together with you. That’s our idea of fun, yeah? For me, that’s quality time with you.”
This is completely innocent. Sherlock doesn't feel things like that, and John has made it clear that he isn't gay. Not that it matters, but people are wrong if they think he has a thing for his male flatmate. He doesn't mind if they do, he just isn't gay. Or bisexual.
Stamford didn't sound nearly as vicious as the dancers did when talking about Sherlock. Still, I sounded more defensive than intended when I answered him.
As I was looking away to hide my wet eyes, it took me a while to realise that he was sitting at the table by the typewriter. This unfinished script lay by his elbow.
“Do I need to spell it out?”
Sherlock had been so certain that kissing was not for him any longer. He has forgotten how to kiss well; it didn’t seem like an ability he needed to save in his hard drive. For the first time in his life that seems not to matter. And anyway,Sherlock doesn’t have enough presence of mind to analyse what he’s doing. He is too busy with the way John tenderly forms his lips to fit around Sherlock’s upper lip.
– and then Sherlock's mouth is back on his, brushing softly back and forth across John's lips. John sighs contentedly through his nose, and Sherlock presses in harder.
Uh huh. So where are you now?
“Finally got that, did you?”
I don't know why you keep returning to “the
He paid me no mind, voice sharp with contempt when he continued: “You are too poor to pay for me properly, so instead you try to steal the night from Moriarty. Did you plan your scheme before you got here, or was it the dance that did it?”
So, they don't talk about it.
“No, it's not. You don't need to say that, okay?”

“Yes. Do you?”
“Wait!” I said, and he looked at me questioningly. I was normally good at this, but it had never seemed as important as it did now, and I found nervousness tangling up my thoughts. “So… This is my door.” I gestured to the worn-off paint beside me, refusing to fidget just because I had given him such a bad line.

Holmes forced a smile, not designed to convince anyone. “I cannot imagine what sort of complications those would be, Moriarty.”
. Shit.
I despised myself for being insecure. Why did I suddenly need
“Huh?”
“Where's the fun in that?” Sherlock says lightly, but there's a tension in his shoulders when he puts the violin in its case.
“You still work?” I tried not to sound too upset.
“Then, I suppose…” Moriarty drawled. “I will see you at the dress rehearsal, Holmes.” He didn't blink, and it made him look inhuman. “Send my love to my Virgin.”
John squeezes past him and barely spares the bed a glance. “Too bad.”

Sherlock blinked his gaze back to the floor. But I was growing more confident, my voice getting steadier through the beautiful melody and Stamford's delicate accompaniment.
John looks up in surprise. “Thank you”, he says and clears his throat.
“Put the damn knife down”, I told him, gun still aimed at the woman. Sherlock turned to look at me for the first time.

Our eyes met. And there, I could see the dazzling mind of Sherlock simmering just below the surface of what I suddenly knew was nothing more than an act. I didn't know why he was acting, but I did remember his naked face when I kissed his hand. He hadn't been prepared for the intimacy between us, and I dared to guess it had frightened him.
I was completely lost to this man.
“You don't need to deduce it, I'll tell you as soon as we sit.”
I finally look at him beside me. William turns his head fractionally, meeting my gaze from the corner of his eye. We look at each other in silence. I find myself with the strangest urge to take his hand, lead him onto the floor and dance to the next polska.
“On a
with Sherlock for an audience of hundreds, I can feel it in every cell of my body; that our love is one permanent thing in a changeable universe.
John's cheek smells of rain and trains and elation.
Under both of their considering gazes, John lets his fingers curl in between Sherlock's, as if wanting to test how they fit together. Wonderfully perfectly, turns out to be the answer to this enquiry. Sherlock looks at their joined hands and tries to breathe normally, John looks at him, and then Father enters the kitchen and John lets go.
You didn't even
A great gust of breath punches out of John's lungs. He folds forward into his hands as if unable to keep himself upright any longer.

Gregory turned to me. “Mycroft Holmes is looking to set up a musical at the Moulin Rouge.”
John fights to make himself dare believe what he knows to be true; he played
He looked at me as if wanting to say something more, searching my face in frustration when he didn't find what he hoped for. Finally, he grunted and turned away, swiftly striding across the dance floor. Even his walk looked like a dance.

“Borrow something of mine.”
But adorably ridiculous.

“Shhh”, Watson breathes.
As soon as the hateful meal is over with, they return to John’s bed.
“That won't be until tomorrow!” John rubs a hand across his eyes. “Maybe you can just find a bed inside the house.”
“None of those men gave me what I was looking for. They mostly wanted to get off, whereas
“Dunno. It’s not me.”

Nearly all the dancers were in the middle of a rehearsal. It was one of the cancan numbers, one where the main characters were off-stage. Stamford, Molly and Gregory sat in an alcove bent over a script. In the middle of the floor stood some chairs, with a few people watching the progress on stage.
Moriarty stared at him for a moment, not making the slightest movement towards the door. The moment stretched until the silence became unnatural, and I found myself setting my jaw and squaring my shoulders not to fidget. When Moriarty finally spoke, he didn't move a muscle, just settling the question in the tense air with his hollow voice:
Fine then
Sherlock's hands card through John's short hair. John clutches hard at Sherlock's hips. It's not enough.
“But there was something… there was something there. Don't look at me like I'm crazy because I know you felt it too. Christ, I haven't even needed my cane since that dance.”
John needs this.

Is he taking stupid risks?
“I don't care.” I held his gaze and refused to blink. “Sherlock. I don't care about the show.”
I claim the floor fiercely. Again I take care to interact with the audience – I'm good at that, if I say so myself. I can make every girl hope that I'll reach out to her when I dance past, and every boy watch me carefully. Well, except for William, apparently; he has the nerve to look the other way when I dance past him. I spread my arms and spin right in front of him, my fingers flying inches from his face. He recoils in surprise and looks up at me. I make another slap in the air right above his head, and he looks into my eyes and laughs.
“Thank you, Martha”, Sherlock almost smiled. She was the only person he ever thanked, at least up until then.
This was a bad idea
“It's too dangerous.”
It's too quiet. It's gone on for too long. Surely Anderson and Donovan should react at this point, surely Lestrade should have some unreasonable scruples about kissing at crime scenes.
I locked eyes with Sherlock the second I entered the dance hall. We both tore our gazes away immediately. But however hard I tried, I couldn't get my body to move independently; instead, it moved in constant awareness of where Sherlock was, always angled towards him, always taking him in.
The bed creaks, and Watson's boot appears on the ladder. He hasn't undressed either; only removed the jacket, leaving a sand-coloured tank top. Watson lowers himself to the floor, remarkably quiet in his sturdy boots, and steals out to the restroom. Sherlock's heart starts pounding inexplicably when he thinks about how when Watson comes back, their eyes might meet through the semi-darkness.
Ok, God. Ok. I'll bring Chinese?
“Ohhh, more-” I begged, and his mouth immediately speeded up, finger pressing hard inside me.
I wander slowly along the road leading back to Drömme. When the Drömme lake comes into sight, I take off on a smaller path to walk along the waterline. I'm happy to spend the night with the lake, the trees and the moon.

“And you said that you’re-” He has to make a minuscule pause in order to get the words out. “Attracted to me.”

“I'm not taking your little message to Holmes tonight, Sherlock.” Irene put her hands on her sides. “You have to go to Moriarty, isn't it in the contract?”
“I should go and get myself some water”, she says. Then she bites her lip as though regretting it.
“Oh…” John changes the angle, pushing directly onto his entrance.
The girl laughs at my belated introduction. Her breath, too, is short and her cheeks have bright red spots. She introduces herself as Klockar Ida, and then the fiddler starts another tune; a polska just as fierce and vivaciously joyful as the last one. We glide back into the dance without another word.
They move slowly down the hall. Sherlock is behind John, arms around his waist, legs trying to match John's gait.
Yes, you do. He wanted you to believe he
I refrain from glancing at him.
Sherlock was silently crying, tears continuously spilling out of his eyes to blend with the sweat from his fever. Martha watched him, not knowing what to say, or perhaps knowing that there was nothing to be said.

” I murmured in his ear. He turned his face over his shoulder, quietly looking into my eyes. The tendons of his long throat stood out. “
Sherlock looks at him, then nods. “Very well”, he says solemnly.
When I'm not paying attention, I fail to tear my eyes away from his mesmerising undersea-rainbows. It's true what Greg says, we do seem to communicate a lot through looks only. When did we slip back into that? I can't believe we're back to knowing each other well enough for it to work.
Ida climbs onto a chair, holding a long stick with the hat hanging at the end. She lifts the stick high to dangle the hat above our heads on the dance floor. William makes another mocking gesture to me, urging me to go first. I throw my fist in his direction for good measure before I turn to Ida.
You don't have to say those things to me,
“I was interested once. Surely you know that already. You said it yourself; if I were to be with someone, it should be someone like you. I’m not idiot enough not to recognise that when you turned up. But it was evident that you weren’t interested, and it was more important to me that our living arrangement worked. So I made myself stop thinking that way. It was a long time ago. It has not been an issue since.”
“Only until you go to Scotland Yard and get the right key.”
I looked at Sherlock's face, but Sherlock wasn't there any more. I could feel him being torn away from me, as if my heart were being physically ripped out of my chest. I nearly screamed in sheer pain. Tears were flooding my face, and I rocked back and forth, holding his body close to me, as if soothing him, as if lulling him to sleep.
