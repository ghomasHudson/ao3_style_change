“No shit, Sherlock.” Dean says, frustrated. “Just level with me here. You break into my house, scare the crap out of me and tell me you are an
“The officers looking into the case have not given me much, and I don’t have anything valuable to give them either,” she says. “I’m trusting you to remedy that.”
"Maybe her husband's death was the thing holding her back from pursuing a relationship with Louisa," Cas commented. "Hence the
“Jesus fuck, that’s intense.” Dean walks over to Cas, lowering his arm. “Read the description before you pick up shit next time.”
Dean got off his chair and walked over to where Cas was perched on the table and gently coaxed the gun out of his hand, “We can finish this later.” Cas made a sound of protest probably because he hated leaving things halfway done.
"Sam," he plucked the card from between his fingers, handing his own to her. "If anything comes up at all before we meet next time…"
“Indeed.” Michael confirmed. “Well, since you have already met, I might as well announce this now.” He looked over to Dean, “Congratulations, Mr.Winchester. You’re on our management team for a new construction project in Italy.”
"Are you feeling dizzy or feel like you're gonna throw up?"
“Me too.” Sam smiled softly. “Now, I have to find a nice person to marry you off to and watch you drive a Prius in your little suburban neighborhood.”
“I know all my family is dead, but this is just rude,” Dean scoffs.
It’s almost too much for Dean’s pathetic little pea brain to comprehend without turning into molten liquid. So, he does the next best logical thing and drops his head on Cas's shoulder, and even shuffles a little closer to drive the point home. Dean’s being brave for once, because otherwise, he’ll have to admit he’s terrified—terrified that Cas isn’t real, that Cas could be taken away from him because of nothing more than a little slip up, or even worse, Cas would choose to leave. Terrified that he will have to live a Cas-less life—and Dean has tried it out and failed miserably one too many times.
Dean gut sank so low in his stomach he was sure it was on the floor. Of course, what the hell was he even thinking? Cas was a goddamn warrior of heaven, all holy and pure, and Dean was the biggest scum on earth. He was probably disgusted with Dean, hell, maybe Cas was going to leave for good this time. It was not like Dean didn’t deserve it. He felt the familiar wave of nausea climb up his chest and the back of his eyelids burned, and the last thing he wanted was-
“It’s pretty long and complicated.”
If Cas notices, he simply doesn't say anything. The hand on Dean's shoulder presses in a little tighter, and it's all the anchor he needs. Cas peers over Dean's shoulder, frowning at the bacon in the pan like it personally wronged him. Their faces are too close and Dean can't breathe. He doesn't even want to.
"Cas, you're staring."
"For how long?"
He finds Castiel's hand under the sheets and squeezes, trying not to be upset when Cas doesn't squeeze back. It's a long couple of hours before he goes under, the faint sound of wind blowing past lulling him to sleep.
"Why'd you choose to live here, Cas?" Dean asked.
.” The intensity of the situation hits him all at once. Cas loves him and he’s still here, even after everything Dean put him through. Talk about miracles.
“I don’t want this anymore,” he says, holding up the vile as the bright blue light, albeit surprised to find that’s all his grace is to Castiel
“Groundbreaking news, Sam.” Dean rolled his eyes, his brain short circuiting at the thought. “I tried my best not to but Cas was too awesome to resist, both in and out of the sack.”
“No shit,” she snorted, leaning back against the seat. “Now I’m gonna look at every case and think it’s a vampire or a werewolf.”
"Yeah right," Bobby snorts, "And I'm Van Halen."
“I don’t think so. Actually he’s coping better than I expected," Sam shrugged. "Still, it won't hurt to keep an eye out."
“Dean-”
"What?"
"What's wrong?" Dean asked softly just as Sam loudly inquired, "Where's Rowena?"
They spend the rest of the afternoon driving around the neighborhood and talking to the victims’ families.
“Castiel doesn’t seem so bad.” Dean mutters in a hushed tone.
A loud ringing breaks apart the electric silence in the cabin. Dean swears under his breath, the moment broken. Cas takes a step back from him, a stoic mask falling over his expression, leaving Dean feeling empty and cold in a way that has nothing to do with the weather. He sets his jaw, turning to look at his traitorous phone lying on the table.
"Wonderful," Cas says in a whisper, cupping Dean's cheek, "I love you, Micaloz."
"What the hell did I just witness?"
They walked over to Jess’ dressing room, only to find a few of her friends in matching rose-gold dresses standing guard in front of the door.
“Shit, sorry. I couldn’t check my phone. Dean, is she–”
He rolled over from his back to his side, facing Cas, and threw his arm around the angel’s middle, resting his head on his shoulder, thankful his injury was on the other side. This way if Cas was to leave, he’d have to wake Dean, and if Dean’s awake, he won’t let Cas go.
Before he can reply, Ivan marches out of his room, dressed in black from head to toe.
"Dean, I need…" He pants, every last bit of awareness seeping away from him, slowly.
“All the garrisons report to our direct superior Zachariah.” He says, “Zachariah gets his commands from the archangels and further above them, the orders come from my father.”
Resort.” Cas said. “Don’t tell anyone for now.”
"Get offa me, Sammy!" Dean slurred, brows pinched into a frown, even when Sam was not touching him. "’M s'posed to look after ya."
"I don't see why not." Cas replied. Dean didn't know what to say. Cas seemed to notice the abrupt silence that fell between them, pulling away as he sat up straight. "I'm so sorry, Dean. I know we can't have that. It was just a spur of the moment."
“Um, it’s–”
“And why is Lilith topside again?” Dean asks.
It took Sam a moment to realize it was his phone that interrupted the heated argument. He grimaced, sinking into his seat from the twin glares aimed his way. He fished the thing out of his pocket, blinking in confusion at the name displayed on the screen.
Dean frowns, “Why’d they use an alias?”
"Thanks," she chuckled. "And yeah, you need that sort of thing when all people see when they look at you is a petite little girl they can scare off."
Dean bristles at the mention of Cas’ name, his skin prickling down to his toes. He swallows, “Cas-”
“I’m Meg.” She said. “You’re cute, Dean.”
"Hence, I suggest we find out what Sam is planning to do and stop him." Castiel says, eagerly, "For his own safety."
They worked in comfortable silence, Cas’s eyes focused on whatever he was looking at while Dean’s eyes slipping back and forth between a dead guy’s heart (which he was trying hard not to make a
“Of course. Being friends with Dean is really boring, so I would love to be your friend,” Cas assures her, letting out a quiet yelp when an elbow connects to his stomach.
"Stow the emo nihilist crap, lady," muttered Dean, and Castiel was going to
"My apologies, I should have explained that better," Cas leans forward. "When an angel loses their grace, it tethers itself to some force of nature. It could be any planet or galaxy, though from the very few cases of such an occurrence, most of the time it has been on Earth which might be due to this planet being so diversely alive."
She gestures towards the couch and Dean settles down, Cas pressed up right next to him, not a spot for Jesus between them. Dean clears his throat.
“Use your Stanford brain and think, Sammy,” he slams his beer on the coffee table. “Cas is not coming back, why is it so hard to understand?”
I will be back with something new very soon. Until then, leave a line or two in the comments about what you thought and check out my other works.
"I'm offended you thought I would ever say those words," he huffed, unable to stop smiling. "How about ‘honey’?"
"Looking for your sheriff?" Dean chuckled.
"Stop psychoanalyzing me, asshole," Dean chuckles, clearing his throat aiming for a more believable tone and says,"Seriously, I'm good."
The music kept playing but the dance floor cleared out eventually as people got tired. As soon as Castiel stepped off the platform, Jo grabbed his hand.
"It'll grow on you," Dean snorts. "Sammy, where's that bitch?"
Dean puts all his nagging thoughts on the back burner as he takes Castiel's hand in his, "Back when we were kids, me and Sammy went boogie boarding in the snow while we were in Minnesota. Dad was off working a case and it was smack in the middle of the night." He smiles a little at the thought, Castiel's curious eyes watching him. "Sammy was barely ten and I dared the kid to do it. Him being the little shit he is, tried proving he could and ended up with a tear down his torso. There was so much blood spilled over the snow and I nearly had a stroke. I got him patched up before dad came back three days later."
“What?” he asks, pulling open the door.
“I got nothing, kid.” Bobby shrugs, “Whatever it is, it’s huge and I’m not liking it, that much I can tell you.”
“Well, I think I’ve got another one for you,” he says. “Guy found dead in Horse Creek, Wyoming. With a hole in his chest.”
He wonders how Dean must be doing right now. Does he still drink his mind numb? Does he throw himself in the path of danger to protect the people he loves? Does he still grin wide with a childish glint in his eyes as he makes pop culture references that Castiel never truly understood? He likes to believe so; to think the Dean he has carefully preserved in his memory is still untainted, but in reality, he simply doesn’t know. Three years could change a lot, and Castiel is the living and breathing proof of it.
"I wouldn't leave you either. You're a billion on a scale of ten, Cas. I literally cannot do any better." Dean says. "Point is, even if we know we won't ditch each other, sometimes doubts happen. So if you think you need to talk, then talk."
It's too much of his soul he's baring to a stranger, but Cas is good. Cas wouldn't judge him, Dean knows.
Dean watches in stunned silence as Gabriel stares him right in the eyes and snaps his fingers. He waits for the earth to crack open in half or lightning to come striking down on him but all that happens is Gabriel disappearing into thin air right in front of his eyes. Dean doesn’t get enough of a window to react before Gabriel returns with a hefty
"Hell no. You put a ring on it before she realizes she can do better." Dean grinned. "Seriously, man, I'm so happy for you both."
"This is why you're my best friend," he said excitedly. "Sam, you're on popcorn duty."
"Sam, this isn't the time for keeping secrets—"
"Not important to me anymore," Cas says. "If there is anyone worth holding on to this, it's you."
Even after that mother of all shitty flights and the adrenaline crash that followed, sleep doesn't come quickly. Or at all. Maybe if he could go through the first step of falling asleep without seeing blue eyes and soft smiles as soon as he closes his eyes, that would've helped. He's tempted to go find some whiskey to drown his brain in but the idea of getting off the bed once he's on it doesn't feel so appealing.
” Sam says. “I was right. Holy crap, this is huge.”
"Do I look like the kind of guy who would go strawberry picking on a date?"
"My brothers and sisters…," Castiel begins, voice trailing off into a whisper, a thin line forming between his brows. "I remember being injured in the war...I can't remember what happened…"
"Dean, please..." He doesn't know what Cas is asking for but he knows he's got nothing good enough to give, except for his battered and broken self.
“If you insist, Commander,” Dean mutters lazily and rolls over, burying his face into the pillows.
Sam bit down a smile at the genuine relief reflected in Dean's voice. His brother was right—everyone was alive and well for once and there was no apocalypse knocking on their door. Sam was more than willing to hold on to that as long as he could.
"Your parents live here?"
“You son of a bitch,” the man takes a step forward, only to be stopped by a hand on his shoulder.
“Akobel,” Castiel kneels down next to him, “You’re hurt.”
“No one else,” Cas glances at Dean from the corner of his eyes, the action almost involuntary. “I never picked them up. I too was a stray and we simply associated with each other.”
Castiel wrapped his hand around Dean's palm on his cheek, turning his head to press a kiss to it. "Come here, Dean."
"I don't reside on Mars," he says, the look of utter seriousness on his face.
and Dean was the reason. From the moment they met, Dean had always been the prime suspect in everything that went wrong with Cas’s life.
"You wanna talk about it?" he asked, not sure how to go about this. Navigating around Cas had always been Dean's forte. Not that Sam didn't want to, but he was generous enough to let Dean have that one thing he was brave enough to do, since his brother—for all the bark and bite—turned into a puddle on the floor around Castiel.
"I think I understand why humans get attached to inanimate objects," Cas hums on their way to the restaurant.
He stretches out his hand, grabbing whatever he can find of Cas and pulling the man down to his lap. He kisses him sloppily on the mouth, not complaining when Cas doesn't kiss him back.
"Will you boys quit murmuring?" Nadia walked over, an amused smile on her lips. Her hair was pulled into a bun and she was wearing a t-shirt with a batman logo on it and matching sweatpants. She was beautiful. "Hey, Sam. Couldn't stay away, could you?"
He blinked, not even close to understanding, “I didn’t-”
“Hell yeah.” Sam exclaimed. “I saw the way he looked at you, Dean. If any of my friends looked at me like you guys look at each other, we both would have some things to hash out.”
Before Dean can figure out what Cas meant, he sees the man push past the tables and out of the front door. Dean throws a few bills on the counter and follows Cas out of the door.
"In a way, yes. She considers the victims as nothing more than just collateral damage."
And that was exactly why he couldn’t risk it.
"You finish that sentence and so help me, I will kick your ass." Dean declares, "I will kick your ass so bad you'd be out for another three days. And when you wake up, I will kick your ass again."
"How do I look?" Dean spun around flaunting his suit and walked towards Cas, swaying his hips a little more than needed.
“I’m not a child,” Cas muttered, sitting up with a pout on his face, looking like he’d very much like to smite Dean. “Let go of my feet.”
I hope all of you are coping well with the show's return tomorrow. Because, I am not.
"Innocent people, huh?" she snorted. "How many innocent people got caught in the crossfire between you boys and heaven or hell?"
Cas stares at him for a moment before asking, "Can I come in?"
"There's a house up for sale two blocks down from here. Dean and Castiel can say they are planning to buy it and want to meet the people in the neighborhood and what better opportunity than an event like that?"
Cas looks down at the spoon and back at him, "Wouldn't you be the better judge here?"
“We are ready to leave, Commander,” Camael says. “Search parties have scoured the premises for safety.”
"Yes," Cas nodded, and that one's gotta win the award for the most unconvincing affirmation. Dean was at his side in the blink of an eye, his legs moving on their own accord. He grabbed Cas by the shoulder, quickly scan for any visible injuries.
"Cool," Dean says, eloquently. "How do we find this grace then?"
“What the hell was that for, dude?” She glared up at him from her phone.
******
The two victims lie there, very much pale and dead. They were nothing out of the ordinary, suburban golf dads maybe, and with a shudder Dean remembered he used to be one of them back when he lived with Lisa and Ben.
Dean’s sad excuse of a brain manages to scratch two brain cells together and remind him that he should look away, because Cas could turn any second and see Dean sprouting rose petals out of his eyes or whatever.
“So, what’s your type?” Dean said.
“Dean,” the voice that called out to him was warm like whiskey and familiar.
“They didn’t. Turns out, Sophia Bishop is a real person,” Sam informs. “Apparently, this Sophia and Robin Brown have been best friends since they were kids. From what I could get out of the landlord, both the Browns and Bishops were super religious. Borderline apocalyptic preacher type.”
“I’m not sure. As of now we know that Robin and her husband signed the lease under Sophia’s name. They lived there for barely four months before moving to,” Sam looks over at Cas.
"Wait until you get to the part were kids manage to not get eaten," Dean chuckles. "They're
"The hell are you talking about?" he asks, now sitting up.
above me," Dean says, his voice sounding several pitches high to his own ears. "I'm just a guy, you're—"
won’t cut it."
"I don't know man, it just feels nice," Dean says, nudging his shoulder with his own. "Quit pouting you big baby."
Next time he wakes up, it's to the soft stream of sunlight flowing in through the window. Cas is turned away from him, their legs still tangled under the sheets.
"I said not a–"
," Sam replied.
Michael smiles, "That sentence could end in many ways. You get to decide that, Castiel."
Sam rolled his eyes. "Alright, make it quick. We have to leave soon."
Also, shout out to Hozier for being there for me when I can't make up a chapter title.
“Alright, how about a rematch?” Castiel grins at his opponent, pulling out another hundred dollar bill. “All in?”
He ignores the expletives Jaime throws his way and heads for the pool table.
"What do I do with the potatoes now?" Cas asks from somewhere behind him.
A thin line forms between his brows and he looks down at his stomach, touching it tentatively as if it's going to explode in his face. A small growling sound startles the angel and he looks up at Dean.
"Six." Sam replies. "Ruby said Lilith has got four so far."
"Seems like you really do have a concussion if that's the case." Cas teases. Dean snorts, sliding his hands under Cas' shirt, feeling the warmth he so desperately craves. Soothing fingers run through his hair and Dean sighs into the touch, just because he can. He scratches his fingernails over Cas' back experimentally, feeling the man stiffen underneath his hands. Dean chuckles softly, dragging his teeth over the soft tendon on Cas' neck.
Castiel followed Dean to the couch, sitting down next to him, close enough to feel his warmth next to him but far enough that he won't have the urge to pull him close and kiss him.
"Maybe you should," Cas says. "Maybe, closure is what you need."
Cas frowns, "Do what?"
"Little Eleanor had a small fever, that is all," Michael smiles fondly. "She's going to be okay."
Dean huffs, "Sam's quinoa is in the cabinet. Help yourself, Sunshine."
Castiel nodded. "Sure."
"Shit, Cas. Didn't mean to startle you." Strong hands pulled him up and onto the couch. "I was just surprised to see you start tidying up this soon."
“What? You thought I beat him to death?”
“If this is about stabbing your boss, then…”
Dean holds out his hand. “Hey ma’am. I’m Dean and this is my partner Cas,” he smiles politely when Dean jerks a thumb in his direction. “We’re looking into buying the house opposite yours. Thought we’d come in and meet all the neighbors.”
"Got me any souvenirs from your vacation?" Jo beams, still hanging on to his back.
Dean leans back on his elbows, watching the sun slowly sinking down. "Is there day and night in heaven?"
“You’re gonna stay?” Dean peered up at him, eyes wide in surprise.
“Fine, whatever.” Dean turns to Ruby, a finger right up to her face, “Pull some kind of trick and you will be real sorry.”
Cas’ eyes widened for a fraction of a second, before a small smile tugged on the corner of his lips, “I’m fine with it, as long as it’s you who I’m marrying.”
Next thing he knew, Dean had his back flattened against the wall, Cas' lips on his in a hurried kiss, deep and desperate. He wasn't hard yet but a few more seconds and it would have turned very awkward. Cas too seemed to be on the same page as he placed a hand on Dean's chest and pulled away panting, as though he didn't trust himself. Dean loved that he could get Cas to look so wrecked.
"With a guy."
He shakes his head, a fresh set of tears making a wet spot on the pillow. His throat feels like barbed wire when he speaks,
It's a deer and headlights situation for a whole minute before Sam's hand slides into his coat pocket and Dean knows his brother well enough to know what's coming next.
Dean’s takes another sip from his coffee, “That’s refreshing.”
Yeah yeah, that was a very cheesy title, I know. But I had to, okay?
“It’s for a few weeks, Charlie.” Dean said. “Besides, this is something architects with my level of experience dream of. I’ll be an idiot to let this go.”
“Fuck, Cas. I’m so sorry. I didn’t-”
"Hello, Dean," he smiles, the words he has uttered like a prayer for so long finally leading to where they are now.
“Okay,” Cas murmurs.
"You gotta be kidding me."
Cas hummed, "I'm glad you got the chance to experience that," he said, and the sincerity in those words made his heart clench.
"You mean as though you don't belong?"
His last bit of dignity wins over for the first time in months and he groans, picking up his phone.
“Dr. Robinson’s office is the last door to the left down the hall,” he says. Castiel raises a brow and the man darts his gaze away, offering a non committal shrug. “Figured there was no other reason for a fed to be here. We don’t get a lot of deaths like
"A broken excuse for one," Castiel huffs a laugh. "If anything, I'm the one who does not deserve-"
Dean gets only half of a second to scowl at his brother before a hand falls on his arm. Cas tilts his head back and takes a swing from his beer, and Dean can’t tear his eyes away from the way his throat works as he swallows. Jesus fuck, he’s gorgeous.
“Maybe I should have stepped on the fish,” Cas mutters, pushing Jaime off of him. “You did a good job on the tranquilizer by the way,” he smiles at Ivan, lifting his duffel off the boy’s chest.
"Sure, just reminding you 'cause you're a little loopy," he tipped a white bottle down onto a ball of cotton and pressed it to Dean's chest over the scars. Dean winced, and Castiel felt a tight grip on his forearm.
"You're absolutely right," she patted his shoulder, laughing softly. "Come on in. Emily's pretty shaken up but you guys can try, though I can't promise anything."
The oven timer blares like the goddamn Olympic horn and Dean jumps back, dropping Castiel's hands as a shudder runs down to his spine.
"Fuck, we're gonna die."
“I have had few…
“We’re supposed to be hunting!” Dean gave a look as though it was the obvious. “I should be out there chopping off some heads or putting bullets in a witch instead of playing house.”
"So, what's heaven like?" Dean asks, biting his tongue a little too late. He expects Cas to get upset or angry at the sore topic, but all he gets in response is a tired sigh.
“How are you feeling, Dean?” Jess eyed him curiously.
Dean grinned wide, "With fries."
The bartender comes back with their drinks, whiskey for Castiel and beer for the kids. Cas doesn't usually drink, but certain hunts leave him tired, disadvantages of his human body leaving his muscles aching. He doesn't know how aging works in his body anymore, but Castiel assumes he is somewhere in his thirties, and he knows it does not get better moving forward.
"Because the only way to survive in this world is by having faith even when you're not sure about certain things." Cas replied, simply.
Dean sighs, clapping Sam on the shoulder, "Forgot to tell you. Congrats, Sammy."
Castiel knew what he felt for Dean, but he didn’t know what the hunter felt for him in return. He simultaneously felt like he knew Dean intimately and also like he didn’t know him at all. The man was so simple to read, yet a mystery, for he seldom opened the pages of his heart to himself, let alone show them to someone else. Dean always repressed and buried his emotions until they inevitably exploded, and everything Castiel knew about him were things he pulled out of Dean throughout the years by gentle coaxing and reassurance that he would never be judged, not with Cas.
If Cas notices the way his voice quivers, he doesn't comment on it. Dean has never felt so drawn to anyone the way he feels about Cas, it's overwhelming, like standing on the edge of a cliff looking down at the world below him, and Dean so desperately wants to jump but he doesn't know if Cas will be there to catch him.
“Compared to Raphael’s potential, any other side might look like the losing side.” Castiel says. “But our strength is in our unity, brother. We don’t need a superior to order us around. Free will is much of a boon to us as it is to humans.”
He makes a whole scene out of chalking up his cue tip, pushing the patience of his opponent. It’s always easier when they are angry and impatient. He rounds the table and leans his weight against it, staring unimpressively at the man.
"Dean, don't—"
"Sorry," Dean sighs, rubbing a hand over his mouth. "It's nothing, forget it. How are things there?"
"A round of, what's the word…?" He sucked his bottom lip into this mouth, thinking hard. "Right,
Dean grimaces, “Jeez, that’s kinda cruel.”
A slight twitch of Castiel's lips is all he gets in return. For a moment Dean finds himself stupidly staring at the guy-
“Please come in,” Castiel gestures them in.
"Show off," Dean rolled his eyes, pulling aside the covers for Cas. The angel climbed in as though the bed was made of glass, gingerly pulling the covers up to his chest and lying stock still, staring at the ceiling with his eyes open.
I'm uploading this chapter a day early because I've to go get vaccinated tomorrow and after the first dose I know I won't be able to open my eyes, forget updating. Anyways, hope you enjoy!
“Oh I’m sure we’ll manage,” Cas mumbled right before the line went dead. “Dean, do you trust her?”
"Uriel, you have served your purpose, you may leave now." Castiel says, the command in his tone sending a shiver down his spine. Dean needs a regular reminder that the dorky little guy can atomize him without breaking a sweat.
"It is, Dean. And I'm sure you deserve all of it." Cas said. "Meanwhile, I have no clue what I am jumping into."
“Because the last time I was on a date, this guy talked for twenty minutes about how he believes everyone has a soulmate and knew I was his. I did not think so, at all.” Castiel said, “Not that this is a date…”
"Woah, there," Sam steadied him. "You okay, Cas?"
"So, how about another round of drinks?"
Dean rolled his eyes, “I’m not asking you to. Just cover for me while I’m gone.”
"What the hell was that about?"
"Don't cry, Sammy," Dean teases, "I'll make sure to leave you at a daycare next time."
"Get over here." Sam pointed to a twisted silver ring with a diamond embedded in it, another two smaller stones flanking it. Elegant, but not too fancy. "That's the one."
She fishes through a tiny chest on the coffee table and pulls out a green pendant. Cas takes it from her, patting his pocket for the lighter. A scream echoes through the room and Cas goes flying back against the wall, the pendant clattering to the floor. Fuck.
"I'll be waiting."
He tried to school his features before responding, not knowing how well it was working. “You shouldn’t have done that, Cas.”
******
Dean snapped his finger, "Yup, that's the one."
he reminds himself.
And so Castiel spent the drive back to the motel where Sam and Dean resided, listening to the plot of a strange movie about ogres. The content did not matter as much as the bright smile that painted Dean's face and the light that danced in his eyes. His soul was humming contentedly, even with all his physical injuries. It never stopped astonishing Castiel how ethereal Dean's soul was; it had marveled him when his gaze fell on it for the first time, all bright and pure, where Castiel was expecting it to be tainted by the misery of hell.
"Do you remember her?"
“Interrupt my breakfast and I will smite you,” Cas mutters around a mouthful of pancake, table manners being one of the few habits he picked up from him.
With that, Cas drops his hand and heads over to tend to the potatoes without another word. Dean sags against the counter, his heart rattling against his ribs like rocks in a tin can.
"Savior complex, much?" Irene walked towards Dean.
Dean scrunches up his nose. "Gross."
"I– fuck," he runs a hand through his hair, turning around and dashing back down the hallway.
Their story has an ending, and Dean and Cas are the sole writers.
They share the familiar comfort of silence as Miracle enjoys getting attention from two pairs of hands instead of one, and Dean absently wonders why he isn't kissing the shit out of Cas yet. His brain is way too muddled to even process everything that's going on.
"Dean?" Jo nudges hard against his ribs. She must have been trying to get his attention for some time. "Eileen's put you on meat duty," she says, and thrusts a list into his hand.
Castiel couldn't help but smile, "No, Dean. I have not. Though, I have heard it is supposed to be a memorable moment of human life."
The term sends a wave of thrill down his spine. He stomps down and digests his schoolgirl butterflies and asks,
“Gone where?”
"Sounds like a swell guy." Dean chuckled. "If anything, he lucked out too."
Cas is sitting on the couch, the movie still playing faintly. The laptop is far away on the coffee table and Castiel's knuckles are white with his grip on the arm of the couch.
Dean's breath hitches and in a moment of bravery he spits out, "Why don't we find out?"
"Wait until I start stepping on your toes," Dean laughs, pressing a chaste kiss to Cas' lips. "I love you."
“I believe it was me who fucked up, per se.” Castiel affirmed. “So, tell me how I can fix it.”
“No one with a motive—”
didn't do his back any favor. But the floor plan is all done and it turned out pretty good. All there is left is for the client to approve before he can move to the next part of the plan.
“Dean,” Castiel pulled him in by his hand, “The washroom is down the hall to the left. Go dry up, I will be back in a minute.”
"I know," he nodded, looking down at Cas's hand still in his hold. "Don't lose it."
Tamoah smiles, “I will.”
Dean balks, “Cas, you think it’s that easy for me to forget everything-” he stops talking when a finger presses his lips.
"And, I'm proud of you both."
"Damn right, it does."
"Okay," Cas mumbled, but Dean didn't miss the way the corners of his mouth pulled into a smile.
“Jason Bettelheim,” she finished, nodding. “Normally I’d do a background check, but at this point I’d even let someone off the streets run the investigation.”
“Holy fuck.” Dean breathed out. “These are so fucking gorgeous, Cas.” His fingers brushed through the surface of the canvas and Castiel stood there, watching the awe on Dean’s face. It was a miracle how he restrained from slamming Dean against the wall and kissing him senseless.
He regarded the room around him, seemingly well furnished, though walls are pretty bare except for the long canvas lining the wall on his right. A naked charcoal figure crouched on the far end of the canvas, it’s frail body a mess of distorted smoke, knees pressed to it’s chest. A set of wings broke out from it’s back and extended to the other end. There was a sense of morbidity to the painting — the dark colours and the dystopian backdrop surrounding the angelic figure — still, it was gorgeous.
None of it mattered anymore because Dean knew he was where he wanted to be in his life.
Since Sam and Eileen shipped him off to Colorado without letting him stay to help, Dean bargained to let him work on the baby room. It'd be a shame if the little squirt didn't have the best when her uncle was an architect. He'd picked a nice shade of mint green for the walls with a white ceiling to match the rest of the house. He even built the mobile from scratch, stringing shiny moon and stars together along with a bunch of his and Sammy's action figures from when they were young. He's pretty damn proud of how it turned out.
"None of that. Ever again," he says, not caring how desperate he sounds. "No lies, no secrets. No leaving. I can't lose you again."
Hey guys, so sorry about not updating last week. I was really sick (it's not the 'rona) and I'm okay now. As an apology, this chapter is extra long. Also, there is a part from Cas' POV. Oh, I forgot to mention, this is the last chapter !!
“Dean, look at this,” Cas extended the heart to him. “Can you see the mark?”
Dean swallowed, moving to pack all the organs back into their containers while trying to get his hands to stop shaking.
"Sap," Dean grins, basking in the love they feel in that moment, threads of shimmering light weaving their bodies and hearts together. Dean tucks his head under Castiel's chin as his entire existence narrows down to the man in his arms.
Dean rubs a hand over his face, "He's an angel."
“We’ll be quick. Just a few routine questions.”
“Alright then, let’s leave in the morning.” Sam slaps his hands on his knees and stands up, “I’m gonna go grab something to eat. If you wanna talk, you know the drill.”
Dean scoffed, "Sitting cooped up in here ain't vacation, man."
"I gave up my grace to save someone very important to me," Cas spoke, his tone leaving no room for doubt.
"You're worrying for no reason," Cas rolled his eyes, unable to hold back a grin.
A single shift of his feet would be enough to get them both killed. Castiel holds his breath, willing himself to not move a muscle as he focuses on the approaching sound of leaves crunching underneath paws. The closer it gets, the more he feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand in attention. He dares to take a quick peek over the top of the boulder behind which they are hiding, seeing that the sun has already disappeared behind the horizon, leaving the forest around him cold and dark.
“How I feel
," Dean mutters. "Can't say the same for your Sasquatch."
“I’ll talk to him,” he says, turning to Sam.
"I'm not going anywhere, Dean." Castiel replied, calmly. "I can't help but care about you even when you don't want me to."
******
“The last resident of our ghost house was one Robin Brown and her husband Luther,” Sam says. “But, the lease was signed under the name Sophia Bishop.”
With that, he exits out of the door before Dean can say anything, cursing himself for his infatuation towards the man he knows he can never have.
"How do you describe love?" Cas asks back, instead of answering his question.
"Yeah," Dean breathes, letting out a stream of air he didn't know he was holding in. "Thanks."
“You kidding me, Cas?” Dean exclaimed. “If that’s not impressive then I wanna know what impressive looks like to you. I mean, I get it, family business and everything but maybe when you get bored of all this, you could paint.”
“’S okay?” he asked softly.
Admitting it was something Dean never thought would happen in this lifetime. It was a thing he and Cas were doing; the whole open communication and vulnerability crap. Somewhere deep inside, Dean was grateful. All his life he’d shaped himself to be the person everyone wanted him to be. Dean Winchester, notorious ladies man with a steel heart and give ’em hell attitude. He had molded himself over and over so much, he barely knew who he was anymore. It was okay because Cas always knew him, and that was all that mattered.
he mocks in a high- pitched voice.
"A huge improvement from tasting molecules," Cas replied, only after he finished swallowing. That wasn't going to last much longer with the table manners he was going to pick up from Dean.
The Target that's usually Target now looks like Santa's grotto on steroids, decked shelf to shelf with ornaments, fairy light and stars. Dean blinks against the bright lights, his eyes scanning the room not sure for what. The first pair of blue eyes he catches stops his heart for a moment before he realizes it isn't the right shade. It won't matter if it's the right shade or not, because Cas isn't gonna be here. Suddenly all Dean can see are tree toppers, angel paintings and potted plants, everything that reminds him of Cas. The universe is a fucking bitch.
"Dean, are you okay?" Cas says, closing the distance between then in two long strides.
Cas scrunched up his nose, “Licorice is disgusting.”
"Where are we going?"
Her face darkens at that. She draws in a shuddery breath. “We had a daughter.” She sniffs, wiping her face with the back of her palm.
"Where's that?"
Dean laughs, coiling his arms around Cas’ neck, “Yeah, we can do that.” He whispers against his lips before crushing them together. This time Cas doesn’t hesitate, a hand sliding into Dean’s hair as he presses his lips harder, like he’d die if he doesn’t get all of Dean. Dean responds equally, licking against the seam of Castiel’s lower lip, asking for entry. Castiel opens up underneath him, throwing Dean a curveball with the taste of Cas in his mouth, hot and addicting. Cas tugs him even closer, a slight wince escaping his lips.
“I could’ve sworn I buried you.” Bobby says, voice shaking.
"You'll have to take that up with the big man upstairs," Dean shrugs. "'Sides I don't wanna wake up to find our goddamn plant can talk, so no, let them be the way they are."
Dean’s three seconds away from smashing the remote on the floor when footsteps come echoing from the hallway. Cas pauses at the door, tilting his head at the screen.
“Guy had a secretary, one Zoe Duncan.” Dean says, “Last person to see him before he, you know. Who’s on the call?”
“That son of a bitch,” Dean spits out. “If Sammy knew what was going on, his ninja turtle ass wouldn’t stand a chance.”
A door slams shut somewhere and they jolt, springing apart from each other like they were burnt. It isn’t much different; being in Dean’s presence is like hovering a hand over fire. It’s only warm for so long until it starts to burn.
"Swear to God," Bobby says, "One more word and I'll kick your lily white asses to next Tuesday." He turns to Sam, "You got a plan, kid?"
"Dean," he said in reply, completely ignoring Sam’s existence as always. Dean never failed to revel in that little act of
“For the last time, we didn’t fuck.”
"You're not a lawyer, Sam." Dean mutters.
"Because you scumbags are supposed to be protecting humans." Dean spit out. "If anything happens to my brother, I will hang you rats alive."
"I'm fine, Dean. The box wasn't that heavy." Castiel got off the couch and pushed the box upright. "I thought I would get the unpacking out of the way before relaxing."
"Cas."
The next time he wakes up, it’s from the sound of the bunker’s front door creaking open. Dean blinks against the harsh light, trying to focus on the figure walking down the stairs, hauling a few bags along with him. It’s the trench coat that catches his eyes. Been a while since he last saw Cas in it.
“I’m not going to lie and say you are the epitome of stability, Dean,” Cas said. “If you are a mess then so am I. The same applies to Sam.”
"I didn't."
"Dean, don't hit him," Sam muttered from somewhere behind him, and Dean wasn't going to go around making any promises.
"Dean…" Cas moans his name, "as tempting as it- it is, you need rest."
“You’re rebelling against a bunch of dicks who have no sense of right and wrong, and I’m happy you’re making the right choice,” He says, “but, you can’t do any good if you’re dead, Cas.”
Those words are his to bury deep inside his heart and cherish, and they're his to echo in his ears during cold nights where his blood is drowning in alcohol and everything around him is numb.
“Take another guess.”
“Will my mom be here, Cas?”
"Hello there," he let out a low whistle, mouth going dry. "Looking good, buddy."
It’s a good thing Dean has no answer to that question, because even if he did, he wouldn’t be saying much. Not when Cas looks so—just so
“Not going to disagree on that.”
"He’s fine, just a minor injury to his shoulder. He will be back in a few days." Cas replied. "The workload might increase for some of you until then, especially Dean."
"It is quite romantic," Cas replies, deciding not to pay much attention to the tantrum Dean seems to be throwing.
Dean lifted his head, “Big talk coming from the guy whose girlfriend threw her job out of the window to hang out with him.”
If something comes up, call me.”
“Yeah, Cas. Go.” Dean rushes over to where Sam is sitting on the floor, clutching his wrist.
"Doesn't matter, man. I'm glad you're here," says Sam, and Castiel finds himself being enveloped in a hug. He pulls away, eyes glinting with excitement, "Wait here, alright? I'll go find Dean."
His tone is more cautious than angry, as though Cas is trying to protect
Castiel shakes his head in part amusement, and part affection, peppering kisses on Dean's skin wherever he can find. He closes his eyes and enjoys the warmth and surging glow of Dean's soul and body, filling the callouses in his grace and keeping him grounded. Love feels so spectacular, it’s a shame humans don’t spend their lives loving each other rather than spreading hate.
"How come it hurts?" Dean asks.
Cas shrugs, "Once we presented ourselves on Earth, the outlook changed for the better. Humans were satisfied to know that they were right about the wings at the least."
"Guys, lunch is on me." Dean called out, earning cheers from his colleagues. "I'll even pay for what Vic eats."
Dean began rummaging through his closet and threw a duffel bag over his shoulder in Cas's general direction before ruffling through his clothes.
“I helped with the magic tranquilizer recipe but only Ivan gets the gifts,” she rounds the creature’s unconscious figure and kneels down behind it, blowing a strand of brown hair away from her face.
“You do know what you’re getting into, right?” Sam says, “Kick starting the apocalypse is not going to do you any good.” He’s clearly stalling, giving enough time for Dean to disable the warding. Dean is scratching at the wall behind him blindly, hoping some bit of the red paint —
𑁋has the audacity to pout like a kicked puppy. Dean almost caves in before knocking his upstairs brain back into function. He says, “Once you’re fine, we can do all the kissing you want,” and adds, “maybe even more.”
“Good morning, Joseph,” he greets, suppressing a yawn.
"The case came to a dead end within a week, Dean," he says through gritted teeth. "It's a known fact that Roman pays off the cops and he wants nothing more than to sweep up the properties once the residents are either evicted or leave on their own. This woman wouldn't leave and now she's…it just makes sense, you know."
"Hello?"
Cold fingertips land on his forearm.
"You don't get to take our father's name, Castiel," Akobel barks. "If only you were to follow his orders-"
"What can I say, humans always find a way to sugarcoat everything," Dean shrugs. "Now go sit your ass down, breakfast will come right up."
Castiel tilted his head, "What's that?"
“Not exactly this, but two blocks down the road from our place, a man was killed a couple months ago,” Henry replied. “The cops ruled out Tommy’s death as a suicide with all the sleeping pills they found in his system but most of us here know that wasn’t the case.”
Sam perked up in his seat, “So, the husband wasn’t the one who got the reward. He was the price.”
“Kind of a douchebag move if you ask me,” the younger man from the pool table says, holding Castiel’s eyes in the mirror. “But I gotta give it to you for your commitment to the act.”
“You boys done here?” Dr. Homer stood clutching the knob. A woman stood behind him wearing purple scrubs and the stack of files Homer was holding earlier. “Oh, this is Ms. Devereux. She’s my assistant, a good one at that.”
Sam cleared his throat, "Dean, I’m gonna clean the wound now. It's gonna hurt a little."
"Dean, we have had this conversation," Cas gripped his elbow, turning Dean to face him. The initial instinct to rip his arm away flickered and went out like a dying flame as his gaze locked with those lightning blues. "You said your apologies and I forgave you. Please don't torture yourself over this."
Dean swallows audibly, aiming for a grin but ending up with a weak smile.
"Not if we can stop Raphael before he can destroy this universe."
“If you pull the right strings, you can be back in tops a month.” Gabriel grinned at him, “I will take care of this place like my own.”
"Take a guess."
Dean chuckles, “Yeah yeah, I love you too.”
“Why did you ask your angel friend to do it?”
Editing this was a bitch, took me hours. Any idea what Cas said to Dean in Russian? ;)
Silence falls as Cas helps him to bed, peeling off the covers and stacking the pillows against his head board. Dean takes the leeway to pull Cas down next to him.
“Nope, it was a bust,” Dean nodded solemnly. “We were just heading out.”
Castiel knows Dean won't have to. Even if the hunter's eyes deceive him, his soul recognizes Castiel just the same. Dean must feel it too, even if he doesn't know why. Human intuitions, as they call them, are often their souls recognizing the right and wrong in a situation.
“Good. Why?”
He thinks about Anna's question…
"How do you know so much about all this?"
"See, overreacting."
"Nope."
"I'm sorry for 'freaking out'" Cas says, putting the words in air brackets.
"Dammit," he mutters, reaching for his phone. The caller id shows it's Sam and Dean remembers another crisis he has been temporarily averting for a while now. "Cas, I've to get this, you can pause if you don't wanna watch alone."
"Is it mandatory that I wear these many layers?" he questioned.
Dean traced his fingers across Cas’s thigh, telling him wordlessly that he was listening.
Sam laughed. “You know what, Dean? I am.”
Dean let out an exhale he didn't know he was holding in.
Ruby leans over, telling the details as Sam types them into the laptop. He turns the laptop around, the Facebook profiles of four girls in their late teenage years visible on the screen.
“Keep your fetishes to yourself, Dean.” Cas said, and Dean could hear the grin in his voice. He just sat there staring at Cas like the useless bisexual he was, until Cas turned to look at him with an amused expression on his face. “Oh my God, I was joking, Dean. Though, it looks like-”
Dean pursed his lips, “Bingo."
“Dean’s not mad at you, Cas. He’s probably upset because you gave up your grace for him,” Sam explained, knowing Dean would be busy punching holes in a wall as he was speaking. Better than taking it out on him or Cas. “It’s kind of a big deal, you know. He probably feels like he owes you something.”
Luke snorts, "Yeah, I probably deserve that. Sorry about hitting on you."
The movie began and Dean watched some of it and the rest of the time was spent watching the masterpiece that is Castiel Novak’s face.
"As you rightfully pointed out, this is not your concern, Michael." Castiel said. "I will handle this."
“Not if we double cross her first.” Sam replies, “All this while, it’s not like I’ve been trusting her blindly. She keeps a tab on Lilith whenever she resurfaces and this is the first time in a long while, Dean.”
"I don't need anything, Dean." He finds himself in his -
"Cas?" Dean blinks a few more times, finding it easy to focus on the angel without squinting this time. Cas doesn't glow like he did the last time he was awake, nor does he see any wings.
Four months have passed and Dean still can't think about that dreaded night without breaking the first thing in sight, otherwise he himself would break into pieces. Dean never told Sam, or anyone for that matter, about what had happened in the dungeon that night. It's selfish of him but those words were the only thing he had left of Cas besides the bloody hand print on his jacket.
“Just shut it, Charlie, I’m fine.” Dean lied. Initially, Dean thought since Cas was his boss, avoiding him would have been easy. There were barely times when a company’s Operating manager would cross paths with a Junior architect. He had never been more wrong in his life — the last two days have been literal hell. Every time he saw Cas around the office, talking to the staff or smiling at him from across the room, a small part of his soul just died. Now he was about to be stuck in a different part of the world with the same guy.
indecipherable churns in his gaze, leaving Dean breathless. He's off the couch and walking towards Cas before his legs can register the movement. He reaches out to touch Cas, to offer some form of comfort, but his hand freezes mid-air like a broken branch sticking out of a tree when Cas visibly flinches at the prospect.
need and that’s why I’m here.”
"No, it doesn't," Cas says, a warm hand on his shoulder. Dean reveals in the touch, blinking hard at the itch behind his eyes. "I can tell how much you love your brother from the way you talk about him. Having to carry a burden like that at a young age, no matter who the person is, must be incredibly wearisome."
"I love you," Dean tugged him forward, their lips meeting in a kiss that said what words could never. Words were never enough for them.
“She’s all good, Sammy,” Dean pulls his flailing limbs down into a hug. “You might hear some screaming soon but it’s just contractions. Don’t worry.”
A small gasp from next to him grabs Dean's attention.
"Your brother is definitely a handful." Castiel shrugged. "I'm the only one stopping him from trying out every pizza joint in the area."
Dean opens his mouth to speak, only no words come out.
“This your gay brother?” Brady cocked a brow at him.
Dean shrugged, pulling his lower lip between his teeth, “Dunno.”
“So, what you’re saying is, in a few years I can become a full time hunter?”
"Of course," Cas nodded, but Dean didn't miss the way his face fell.
"Dean," Castiel held out his hand, "May I have this dance?"
Dean nods, leaning his forehead against Cas's, "Here we are."
"It smells really good," Cas says, a small smile of his own ghosting on his lips.
"I don't think so," Cas cuts him off. "You were there for him but you had no one. I'm not invalidating his suffering but Sam was not old enough to remember what a safe and content life felt like, but you had all of it ripped away from you. That is something unbearable for a child."
“Listen Sammy, I know that bitch is your arch nemesis or whatever, but we don’t know what she’s been up to since her puppies dragged me to hell.” Dean says, “It’s suicide, walking right into her open mouth.”
Dean scoffs, “You’re the one to talk about secrets. Remember Crowley?”
"I do," Dean flicked Cas's arm. "Doesn't mean we gotta hop on the first case we find. You and Sam are here and alive, the world is not ending for once and I can live with that for now."
And another.
"Castiel," Tamoah urges him on, with a hand on his shoulder. "There is no point in dwelling on who we have lost."
“Yeah, well, I’ve got no one but you and Sam to think about,” Dean shrugged, glaring pointedly at Sam, but the younger Winchester was grinning widely.
"Yeah, I know the drill, Cam." Dean waves him off. "Let's get going."
"Yeah, fuck, gonna make you feel so good." Dean nodded frantically, rolling his hips forward. A litany of moans and curses escaped Castiel's lips as Dean bottomed out, making him feel so impossibly full.
Dean holds his breath, watching Cas's long fingers click around on the keyboard. The guy's got really nice hands.
“Angels don’t engage in romantic or sexual relationships with each other, Dean”
Right now, Dean doesn’t want anything else. Maybe later he’ll go looking for more, because that’s the thing with Cas. He’s magnetic. But, right this second, all Dean can do is close his eyes and feel Cas’s fingers brush through his hair and the shell of his ear—so
“Telemarketer. Did you say Zoe Duncan?” Sam asks, “Well, the Ericksons got a sitter, Ester Duncan.”
When he met Dean’s gaze, those green eyes were looking back at him with an unreadable expression. Suddenly, Castiel was being pulled into an embrace, Dean’s body warm against his. Castiel stiffened, gently wrapping his arms around Dean’s torso.
When he collected his paycheck with the added bonus from all the vacation days that he never called in, Dean's mind was already throwing darts on all the places he wanted to visit. It isn't necessarily travelling, just a road trip to a few places that seemed quiet and calm. Driving around at the beginning of winter isn't exactly the beach vacation Dean always wanted but this is a different kind of feeling. Everything around him is quiet and the silence is welcoming, coexisting with nature and all that hippy crap he pretends to hate.
"You too, Uncle Dean."
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean breathes out. “You can’t say crap like that right before we’re jumping both feet into a goddamn kamikaze mission.”
"Thanks, baby," Dean chuckles, pressing a kiss to Cas' stomach. "Look, the ship's about to hit the iceberg!"
“Billy Joel? Really?”
"You don't look like a cat person." Castiel said, "Actually, you don't look like an animal person at all."
Yeah, it could’ve gone worse.
Dean pulls back hesitantly, “You need rest, Cas. Your wounds are still healing.” Cas𑁋
“That’s really generous of you,” Dean spoke up. “Called to let us know you changed your mind?”
“Do I get to cook?”
"Cas, you're family. No matter angel or ghoul or a goddamn demon," Dean replied, affection masked by the ferocity of his voice. "You're always gonna be welcome with me–
Castiel laughed, "Cruel."
Also, any guesses on what Dean was all blushy about?
He flies to the bunker, knowing he won't find peace without seeing Dean, even if for one last time. The warding, he senses, has been lowered quiet substantially, probably due to the lack of impending threats looming over their heads. He doesn't doubt that Dean will try to shoot him if he materializes in the middle of the library, but Castiel has enough grace in him to sustain the injury. His only doubt is that if he will be strong enough to turn away after seeing Dean's face.
"That doesn't change the fact that I love you."
Sam went back to his book, though his brother and the former angel stuck out like a sore thumb in his line of vision as Dean and Cas threw glances at each other, needing no words to communicate, as they do. Sam knew if he were to leave them alone for long enough they would end up feeding pancakes to each other and Dean would pat Cas on the shoulder, say
“Of course, I will leave tomorrow morning.”
"I don't."
“Here,” Dr. Robinson hands him a plastic container. The heart in the container is much smaller than the size of Castiel’s fist; the muscles shriveled and murky grey in color. The veins running along the tissues are burst open in most places.
Castiel smirks. Perfect.
Dean fires his first shot, sparks flying as the spirit bursts into flames.
"I do not have any means of comparison, so I will have to take your word."
“Shut up, asswipe,” Dean snaps, though Cas notices his cheeks are tinted pink.
"Yeah," Dean says, pushing open the door a little. Cas is lying on his stomach, blue eyes struggling to focus on him. He's so deeply buried in the blanket, Dean would've missed him if it weren't for the tuft of dark hair poking out from under the contrasting white comforter. "Sleep well?"
"I did a double major in Business Administration and Art." Castiel said. "Peculiar, I know. One was for professional interest and the other for personal. I moved back here to join my family business so it's worthless."
Cas nods, a small smile splaying in his lips, "Thank you."
"What…" Cindy shakes with fear, eyes drifting across the room.
"Okay, this really is huge." Castiel said. He bit his bottom lip, and Dean’s eyes traced the motion involuntarily. "Cat person."
Cas can’t stop the smile tugging at his lips, “You think I’m pretty?”
“You can’t be dead set on it.”
He found himself pulling into the driveway of a tan bricked house with stone column fence and a paneled glass door.
“I can’t be sure.”
Dean looks around confused and back at Cas, “Was that a heavenquake?”
He reached out to pull off his gloves, only to find his own hands frozen. Blood...his hands were covered in blood. Pain burned behind his temples like hot lava and Dean could feel his chest tightening, flashes of red and white slipping past his vision. He didn’t know whose blood it was. He didn’t know if he hurt anyone. Oh God, he probably hurt someone. He can’t remember. He can’t breathe-
"Hey, let it go," Dean reassured him, with a squeeze to his shoulder where his hand still rested. "There wasn't much you could've done. Her hocus pocus is too strong even for your mojo."
Ella wraps her whole fist around his forefinger and Dean all about loses it. He doesn't know if it's the days of repressed emotions or the relief of seeing his niece safe in his arms and her mother gleaming with joy, Dean swallows down a sob at the sight of his family.
"Hey, no," Sam slapped his brother rather hard on the cheek and Castiel stared at him in horror. "You gotta stay awake for now. Come on, buddy, you can sleep later."
, it doesn’t end there. He could pull up his notes app and write down the things he wants from Cas—
A fifth of whiskey turns into two, but all Dean is left with is this cold ache—a sort of numbness in his chest. He wants something,
it. Kinda stupid, right?"
“Awh, don’t be like that, Cas,” Dean walks past him, nudging his shoulder on the way out. “Drag me through the mud, go on.”
He hears Sam's long drawn sigh from the other end of the line, "I'm sorry, man…"
Sam is waiting for them at the motel, and they brief him on everything they have learned.
that can kill Lilith. Now we need a way to lure her to us."
“Would you do it?” Dean asked, eyes wide and unblinking.
He reaches for his gun the exact moment Sam makes a beeline for a candle stand on the mantelpiece, both efforts futile as Jenna sends them crashing into a wall with a flick of her wrist. She curls her hand into a fist and Cindy screams, clutching her stomach.
“I’m not worried about my position in this universe. Doing the right thing is what I care about, even if it kills me.” He says, “Sam and Dean are making the right choices now. That is all that matters.”
Dean nodded, “Yeah, he’s a tough son of a bitch.”
Dean leans closer to Cas and whispers, "What's going on?"
“Yes, I am,” Cas replied without missing a beat, the words so full of sincerity it made Dean’s heart ache. He leaned forward to catch Cas’s mouth in a kiss just because he could, feeling the warmth coursing through him at the contact.
They go by their nighttime routine, moving easily around each other in the bathroom, glancing at each other in the mirror occasionally. Cas is smiling a lot more than usual and Dean thinks—at the risk of sounding like John Keats—that it's far better than every sunrise he's ever witnessed.
"Angels haven't been on this planet since decades ago, babe," Sam snaps. "He's either a nut job or—"
“You sure sounded like you needed help, buddy.” Dean grinned.
"There you are!" Dean grabbed a shirt and turned to him, holding it out. "Always wanted to see you wear this."
“You okay?” Dean helps him up, winching when his back aches with the effort. He’s getting old.
"Nah." Dean said. "This is even more sad. Laugh at me and you will have to bake your own pie next thanksgiving."
The words
If someone asks Dean to describe what he’s feeling right now, he’d say—it’s like getting smacked in the head with a two by four while being hand fed apple pie.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' waist and rested his chin on his shoulder, "What's so special about this boyfriend?"
The rain began settling down ever so slowly, sharpers rays of sunlight peeking out through the edges of the dark clouds. The sandpiper resumed building its nest as it dusted out its feathers to warm them in the growing light.
“Dean, are you all right?”
“I don’t…” Dean swallows, “I don’t need this crap right now.” He storms off into his room like a pesky teenager, slamming the door behind him.
"I'm at Rouge Stone," Benny says. "Is Dean Winchester finally done with being a hermit?"
Dean blinks back in confusion, “With what?”
"Then," he slides his palm down to rest over Castiel's heart, "kiss me."
As soon as Camael is out of earshot, Dean snakes his fingers around Cas' wrist, holding him in place.
He leans forward, pressing a soft kiss to his angel's lips.
“I was there when Dean was in hell. Gotta say, it was his peak performance.” Ruby says, “It’s usually hard to impress Alastair.”
******
“Do I have to?”
“Can we do this like a week later?” Dean takes a long pull from his beer, “So what have you been up to, Sammy?”
He turned away, running his hand through his hair, "Fucking hell."
"You've already won over the people that matter," Cas smiles. "I have never seen Gabriel this interested in anyone."
"You didn't." Dean ran a hand through his hair. "Even if you did, it was probably another spur of the moment. Like when you said you liked me back then." He was dangerously close to spilling the truth but he had it enough being hung up on someone who he had no business even trying to get with.
Dean takes his hand, grinning, “I feel like you’re just making excuses to hold my hand.”
Sometimes even I feel like throwing up from how disgustingly adorable these two are.
Dean draws in a breath, "Well, in school I always got along with people, but it always felt like something I was obligated to do—like a facade," he says, his next lines spoken while he watches Castiel's reaction. "When I realized I like both boys and girls it was downright terrifying, part of me thinking something was wrong with me and I spend months freaking out over a little slip up that would end up in my old man kicking me out of the house for being bi, or worse, being disappointed in me."
"We can clear the body if you want," Sam suggested, sympathetically.
"What event?"
here but now I'm seeing how stupid it was. I'm glad you're here."
"Cas?" Sam pokes his head in, eyes darting back and forth between him and the angel. A gaping hole opens in Dean's chest as he sees his little brother, wanting nothing more than to hug him.
Dean remembers the first time he was at the park. He can almost smell the fresh grass and water logged mud stuck to the bottom of his shoes, and the rust on the chains of the swingset. He was over the bump of three and heading towards four—the whole world just nothing but green and blue. He remembers climbing along the monkey bars with his dad’s hands around his waist, holding him up, and his mom watching from the bench, her hand on her belly where his baby brother was. If he closes his eyes and just
Castiel snorted, sharing the sentiment. He adjusted the weight of Dean against him, who now had his arms wrapped around Castiel's waist and his face tucked into the crook of his neck. For a man considered so dangerous, he was quite adorable.
“That’s not—” Sam pursed his lips, “Dean, I know it’s none of my business but just think about it. Whatever you think you cost him, it’s not what he wanted. Angels have been nothing but assholes to him and now he’s happy. You can’t tell me you don’t see it.”
"Cas has seen worse."
“If serious is what you want then start looking for it,” Benny counters. “Or are you still waiting out for–”
"I wanna know what you think."
“Is it acceptable to take humans to heaven, considering the-”
“How long?”
“Sometimes I feel like the breaks never work properly,” Cas hums, trying to bite down a grin when Dean glares at him from the passenger seat. “I would actually like an oil change, though.”
to. Except, what does Dean know? He’s some drunk guy on the floor with his best friend being the only thing holding him up, in every sense of the word. Dean looks into Cas’s eyes and sees a lot in there, a lot of good things, but none of it makes sense to him. All he knows is that it’s fucking
?" Sam questioned. "You've got some other theory?"
“Jesus fuck,” he sighed, unable to stop grinning like an idiot for the life of him.
“Just get in the damn car for God’s sake.” He runs a hand through his hair, the urge to run away and hide overwhelming him. Cas doesn’t say anything after that, every stretch of silence more and more unbearable. Dean feels like shit. Cas gave up his grace only to be left with a broken shell of a man as some crappy consolation prize.
Somehow this chapter turned out to be all Dean POV and pretty lengthier than usual. Sorry! (or not)
“Cas, I’m sorry.” Dean’s voice is barely a whisper, “You’re a good guy. And don’t you dare think you don’t matter. You’re fighting the good fight, Cas. Don’t you see it, angels were made to protect humanity and you turned out to be the only one hitting the mark.” Dean tugs slightly against his shoulder, forcing Castiel to meet his eyes, “I’m not the one to speak for God, but if he were around, he’d be proud of you, buddy.”
"Good." Cas nods. "You should go check on the injured soldiers. I will be with you in a minute."
"You can shout at me all you want, Dean,” Cas said quietly. “I’ll understand if you want me to leave.”
"I don't see nothing but good in you," Cas sighs. "Perhaps it's not my image of you that you should be worrying about."
"That means someone's been here after you and Castiel left." Camael says.
"I'm here." Cas says, resting his hand on Dean's lap. "I want to be here as long as you will have me."
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas replies, setting the paper bag on the nightstand, eyes not leaving Dean. “From what Cindy said, the patterns of deaths are similar in both her daughter and Mr.Heckle. What do you think?”
“You look like crap.” Sam comments as he pads downstairs.
Dean felt a kiss being pressed to his temple, something like a reward, ’cause, yeah, Cas knew how hard it was for him.
“I know, Bobby, I was there.” Dean pulls away and grins, blinking back the tears, “I don’t know how I got here. One minute I was in hell and then I’m crawling my way out of a coffin.”
“Thank you,” Cas says softly, and his voice comes out a little scratchy. He clears his throat, “Thank you for telling me.”
He doesn't turn around when he answers, "Not running away, Cas."
"Tell me if anything hurts." Cas mumbles against the shell of his ear.
"No!" Dean exclaimed, eyes wide as his legs came to a halt. He blinked at them for half a second before plastering on a grin. "You go spend time with your girl. Don't ever tell me I didn't do anything for you."
This is me giving TFW a dose of the beach episode they deserved.
Fixing Baby was something Dean could do in his sleep so it barely took a few minutes before her engines were up and kicking. He pulled back into the city, driving past his apartment and down to Sam's place.
"Will she be able to sense we're here?" Bobby asks.
Dean's blood runs cold, heart suddenly jumping to his throat. He takes the phone from Cas' hand and presses it to his ears, ignoring the way his voice shakes as he calls, "Sammy?"
“Of course, I didn’t mean to imply otherwise,” Cas amends. “You never had an imaginary friend?”
“This is way above my pay grade, man,” Dean groaned, pulling out his phone. “Time to call the search engine.”
"I’m not an idiot, Dean." Cas replies. "I suggest we stop for the night."
"He's too good to me."
“Alright, that’s enough,” he mutters, pushing past her. “I will be outside when you feel like going home.”
There was a time when Castiel would've been left confused—even terrified—of what he was feeling right now. When the duty of rescuing Michael's vessel from hell, it was nothing but a mere duty. But the moment he laid his hand on Dean's soul, he knew he would never feel anything that intense. The magnitude of beauty the hunter's soul held was unmatched to anything he had ever witnessed. Both Sam and Dean's souls were pure in their own way but no other responded to Castiel's grace the way Dean's soul did. The most devastating part of being human was that he couldn't see Dean's soul anymore, though it didn't matter. Now, he could concentrate on the sound of Dean's laughter and the twinkle in his eyes when he made a joke; and it was beautiful all the same.
“I never said so, Dean. You need to stop making assumptions about what I feel and don’t feel,” Cas quips back, sounding a lot more sober than he did a minute ago. “And, yes. I have nothing more to say. It seems you have your grievances resolved, no matter what that has left me with.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
The fact that he’s driving to the morgue bizarrely does not dwindle his mood, nothing but the sound of a familiar voice pouring in through the stereo. Taylor Swift, he thinks. The lobby of the coroner’s office is empty except for the man sitting behind the reception. Cas pulls out his badge, making sure it is open the right way, before placing it on the table and tapping a finger against the plastic.
"There's these bunch of shops down the road, sells the weirdest shit you'll ever see, you're gonna love it. It's all good stuff, and supports the local business so why not," Dean says.
"Well, there isn't much we can do about it as long as we're living in a capitalist society," Castiel fixes Jaime with a look, telling her to be more encouraging. "So, good job, Ivan."
"–taken," he settles for.
It was not like he had a choice. Between the general problem of insomnia along with the nightmares as a package meant not getting a full six hours in a stretch. There was no point mulling over all that.
“Alright,” Dean sighed, “what made you look like you were about to
Dean rubs a hand across his face. "In my line of work, baggage only slows you down and gets you killed." He says. "You gotta power through it."
“I will not let Sam and Dean be manipulated into this.”
"Love you too, Cas." Dean sighed, and pressed his lips to Castiel's.
Dean pretends he doesn’t hear the screams as he digs the end of the blade into her shoulder, dislocating her arm from the rest of her body. He wants to stop, he can’t. He likes it.
"These men are infuriating," Cas scoffed, letting go of Dean's hand and walking over to Sam. "Show me the wound."
"Come on, Cas, I'm not some chick."
“You remember that?”
"Let's go home, Dean."
Dean responded with a roll of his hips, "Bet it could get closer.”
Cas’s hand is right there, and Dean wants to—he wants to do
“Nothing, Ivan,” he shakes his head, running a hand over his face.
“What do you think?” Sam purses his lips. “He doesn’t care about the fact that Metatron was the one who tricked him. In his eyes, the angels falling is his own fault.”
"I've got a shit ton of questions to ask about literally everything in the universe, but," Nadia paused, catching her breath. "How's it being human?"
Castiel leaned closer, jumping a little in his seat when Dean's lips brushed his ear.
“Gadreel thought you’d figure out he was lying about his identity, so he made me kick you out,” Dean explains. “We found it out anyway and Gadreel finally gave up. The guy was just scared of being hunted down by other angels.”
Not when Cas is still around.
Dean has heard a lot of weird shit in his equally weird life, but this one takes the cake. Hell, it takes the whole goddamn baked goods industry.
"You can't tell him what to like!" Sam protested. "Now you've conditioned him to be biased."
Castiel grimaces, turning around to come face to face with a very disgruntled Jaime, her brother in tow.
"Well, what if you were a little late?" she asks. "You would have lost both me and Ivan. This isn't on you, Cas. You can't save everyone."
“Nah, but we’re looking to rent one of the houses in the neighborhood,” Dean replied, flashing a charming smile. God help him, he had enough of those up his sleeve. “Thought we’d meet some of you people and get to know our potential neighbors.”
"Be my guest," Dean pulled open the freezer and stacked up the containers, carrying it over to an empty gurney. "A vamp or a wolf was easier, just gotta look for a bite mark of a missing heart. But witches get their rocks off from having us be elbow deep in someone's gut."
"Buried himself in school work and repressed it like a champ."
It was pleasantly terrifying how the first person that popped up in his head was Cas and how the guy met all of his brother’s checklists. Except for the Prius. Dean wouldn’t be caught dead driving one of those.
Jess sauntered into the kitchen, sweeping her hair off her face. Dean smiled at her fondly, ruffling her hair as she tried to dodge his hand. He always wondered what it would be like to have a baby sister. Once Jess and Sam started dating two years ago, Dean had self claimed the position of her brother as well. After a while, he more or less became their chef slash fashion adviser.
Since their last talk in the car, Dean hasn't exchanged a word with Cas, not even the usual forced pleasantries. He sometimes wishes it was someone else who pulled him out of hell. Some junkless angel who doesn't give a crap about Dean and not Cas, who's so full of goodness. Cas who would die for anyone in the blink of an eye. Cas who gave up his grace for Dean.
Less than ten minutes later, Castiel is pocketing four hundred dollars while an angry six foot three man looks like he would like nothing more than to beat Cas up.
“It’s a good song,” Cas informs, nodding alone to the tune of Only the Good Die Young.
“Yes,” he chokes out. “I’ll be in my room if you need anything.”
Another press of fingers and Dean's feet lands next to the manhole inside the clearing in the woods.
Dean leaned his forehead against Castiel's, the room filling with nothing but their ragged breaths. He slowly pulled out and Castiel let out a while at the loss, earning a chuckle from Dean. He pulled off the condom and tied it before aiming for the trash can at the far end of the room.
Dean would’ve believed Cas has been zoning out after listening to him talk for too long, if it isn’t for Cas’s steel blue gaze boring right through Dean’s skull. He tries not to shrink in his seat under the intensity of Cas’s eyes. On one hand, Dean knows it's a shitload to process, and on the other hand, he’d very much like Cas to say something, literally
Irene rolled her eyes, “Maybe later, big guy.”
Cas doesn’t say anything, so Dean jumps in, trying to help in any way he can.
More than one occasion, Castiel has wondered if their father will give him a sign to show him he is doing the right thing. Yet, he has never tried, hearing from the Almighty, a foreign idea in his mind. Castiel shifts uneasily, thinking a way to coax out something more from Zachariah.
Castiel feels the spark of the soul, a warm glow spreading like ink in water.
"But-"
pile, and stretches himself out on the couch.
It’s an uneventful night for Cas from there on, but Dean’s having the worst time of his life, clutching the porcelain throne and evicting his guts out of his body. Fun times. Cas’s hand is still on his back, and there’s something cold pressing against Dean’s forehead. The favors Dean owes Cas is stockpiling, and he’ll have to die for Cas a couple of times to make up for all this.
“Dean is right.” Sam scowls at him, but Castiel presses on, “We know nothing about Lilith’s plans, and she could be anywhere. Besides, my orders are to help you prevent the breaking of seals, not finding Lilith.”
“You look as though I’m holding you hostage.”
Cas was practically fuming as he said, “Just because you think your life is worthless, that does not mean I share the sentiment.”
“It’s just the reality, Dean,” Cas shakes his head. “Even now, I might be a human, but there are parts of me still adhered to what I used to be.”
“Woah, there!” Dean pinned his arm to the bed. “I like my face, man.”
Cas nodded and moved to stuff everything back in the fridge, and Dean concentrated on the ghost of Cas’s touch on his palm until his lungs felt usable again. The logical part of his brain knew the Mark was long gone but he couldn’t help but trace below the crook of his elbow through his coat just to feel the smooth slide of skin there.
"Son of a bitch." A cold fist closes around his chest and Dean feels weak in his knees. "He...
“Sure,” Joseph grouses, uninterested as usual. “Are you on a case right now?”
Dean walks over to Cas, gently guiding him to his feet, “Let them take the vessels away, Cas. Give him his last rights.”
“Tired.” Dean corrects, and flops back on the bed. Suddenly, Cas is right next to him, leaning down to press a soft kiss to his lips.
"Cas? What– Sammy–" Dean's voice croaked, breath heaving as his silhouette tried to rise from the forest floor.
“No it’s...I-”
"Gonna take you out on a proper date. Kiss you goodnight at the door. Gonna ask you to move in, though that's gonna happen sooner than normal."
“I have. To great extent, in fact,” Cas says, his hand on Dean’s back not pausing once. “I realize you prefer to self medicate over dealing with your feelings, but it’s not a long term solution, Dean. You wake up feeling worse than you did to begin with.”
"I'm not sure what amount of clothing is acceptable." Cas said. "Very reason I asked for your help."
“Did you guys find anything?” Sam asks, snatching his laptop from underneath where Dean’s arms are folded. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Cas opening his mouth to reply, and Dean quickly stops him with a glare.
Seconds stretched into seasons as they kissed and kissed and kissed like the world was ending; and it was.
Cas smiles, and that's the single best thing that makes Dean believe in God. "When I'm running away from heaven's problems, I'm glad it's you I am coming back to."
“I heard you the last ten times,” she rolled her eyes, cocky for someone with a gun pointed at her. “Terra’s and I…we’re leaving this town, but I had to be here before or else…”
. I’m just…” he frowned, not sure where to go with that sentence. There were so many possibilities.
“Jeez, Samuel. Have a little more faith in me,” she said, an eye roll visible in her voice. “This is not about me. But I need you boys to hash it out for me.”
"Not too long. I did not intend to wake you up, Dean." Castiel says, preparing himself to leave if Dean asks him to.
Dean turned his head to face him, "What? Bottoming?"
"You have no idea." Castiel breathed back. "Is that why you were angry with me?"
"All what?"
Dean jumped, startled, turning to see Cas behind him.
Then there was Castiel.
“I did,” Dean gave him the confirmation he was looking for. “I’m so sorry, man. I don’t know what I was doing, shit-”
"How do you know?"
"Strawberry picking?" Dean asks incredulously, as soon as they have stepped off the Kendall's front porch.
, as of now,” he says, ignoring the way she’s trying to bite down a grin. “But, after a few years, all it is going to be is a burden, a
“Sure, I’ll buy you lunch at Roadhouse,” she grins.
That's all it took for Cas's features to soften, "You deserve that, Dean. After what you have been through, you are entitled to a vacation."
“Good luck.” Sam mutters, sliding out of the booth, Bobby in tow.
“What are you? My mom?” he snapped, because it was easier that way than to succumb to the way Cas’s voice shook. “Seriously, this isn’t my first rodeo. A run to the bar won’t get me killed or whatever.”
Dean was not panicking.
Dean looked up at Castiel with a smile so beautiful, he felt his heart gnaw against his ribs. The rhythmic hum of his soul stretched out to Castiel, and the weak shadow of the grace in him ached to twine with that divine soul.
Dean tried not to roll his eyes at the poor dead bastard, "Did he have any enemies? Anyone who would have wanted to hurt him in any way?"
Dean shook his head, “It’s all good, we know about the two deaths. We don’t scare that easy.”
Cas muses, getting the look that universal look of not being able to express the words running around in his head. Dean doesn't know if Cas is talking about being human, his lost grace, or both.
God must be smiling to himself now as Dean's brain to mouth filter short circuits at the way Cas outright
“Dean, you don’t have to–”
"You're good. He's busy kicking ass elsewhere," Dean chuckles, and adds to tone down the awkwardness, "Though, I'd have kicked your ass for that weak pick up line."
Next to him, Cas let out a snort. Dean turned to him, narrowing his eyes.
“Good thing that you two will be around now,” Linda carries on, unaware of Castiel’s inner turmoil. “It's a damn shame how many houses are going empty around here.”
"Yes," Cas nodded.
“Anyways,” Sam clears his throat, "I'm gonna go down to the sheriff's office and try to get some more info on Victoria.”
"Of course," Cas turns to look up at him like it's the most obvious thing.
Dean's heart settles the farther he walks, his gut uncoiling back to its original state. He misses Cas so bad, it hurts all kinds of ways it can manage.
It was Dean’s turn to be confused.
“The weight of the world is love. Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction, the weight we carry is love,” Cas voice rumbled through his core. “Allen Ginsberg wrote that.”
"Get your mind out of the gutter, Samuel," Dean rolled his eyes. "I've had a rough couple of months, man. I wanna sit back for some time."
"What'd it say?"
He ran a hand over his face, “I get you, Cas. But you know how Dean is. He thinks his own life is a guilty weight he should carry on his shoulders.”
“Brother, I would like to know what happened.”
He reached out and placed his palm over Cas’s eyes, “You gotta close your eyes to fall asleep, asshat.”
Aw hell no. "Get back here you son of a bitch!"
They walk through the forests, Dean making several double backs as he drinks in the beauty of the place. As they moved further in, the forests slipped away as something similar to a rural town formed ahead of his eyes. Cas moved with purposeful steps, explaining the different parts of heaven to him. Dean followed silently, enjoying watching Cas in his element.
“Well, shit,” Dean let out a laugh that died down into quiet chuckles after a moment. “It’s like he got offered a shitload of water and had no choice but to drink it up until he died. Crap, I feel bad for laughing.”
"Stop trying to sideline me—"
Dean whipped his head around to look at Cas, but his friend simply looked bored.
?" Dean gapes. "What the fuck? We need to go now."
The tent flap opens, and Tamoah pokes his head in,
"I can never be sure." Cas replies casually, footsteps echoing closer. Dean lets himself be forced to face Cas, feeling himself shatter. "What am I doing wrong, Dean?"
Dean closes his eyes for a moment before finding his bravest face. "We'll see about that."
“Castiel.” Dean says, as though testing out how the three syllables feel on his tongue. “I would offer you a beer but I'm not a fan of demons."
"Uh, yeah," Dean jumps into action, moving out of his way.
"I don't…" Castiel's eyes widens. "My grace...I can't feel it."
Sam walked into the kitchen to be greeted with the sight of an avalanche of pancakes sitting on the table, and if his brother and his friend were a part of the package then Sam will just have to ignore them. Not that it mattered because Dean was busy hip-checking Cas away from the sink to notice Sam’s arrival. He cleared his throat, and as expected, Dean jumped like a cat who just saw a cucumber and Cas stayed rooted where he was.
“How are you feeling?”
"You'd have got his number by now from the way he was looking at you," she mutters. "Unless of course you still believe Cas is coming back."
So, he does the next best logical thing. He gets wasted.
Cas's face sours, "Dean."
for billions of years.
It was the only thing Dean could think of right now without feeling like his brain was ripping itself in half. And Dean wasn't even talking about the face of the dude Cas was wearing. There was something about the way the angel held himself, all of his holier than thou six wings and six hundred eyes, now sitting next to Dean on the bed of a no name motel room. It was surreal.
“Oh, the house with the pretty lady!” she brightens. “Are you friends with her?”
"If I have anything else left to give, you can take it from me. All of it." Cas' voice is barely a whisper and Dean falls apart under that gaze, wanting nothing more than to give himself over to the man in front of him. But, Cas deserves better. Cas deserves every good thing to grace this planet. And Dean is not one of them.
“I’m not saying you’re wrong, but we need some intel to start with.” Dean says, “We can first stop this seal from breaking and then maybe think about finding Lilith,” He adds, “Maybe.”
“How long have you two been together?” she asks pleasantly, and Cas looks to Dean, keeping his promise to let him do the talking.
“Was it good?”
Castiel smiles at that. “Tell him to set up an entrance.”
And another.
They clean up together, moving around the house in practiced ease. Dean takes up dish duty having found the motion of washing and drying the dishes somewhat therapeutic. Once he’s done, he snags two beers for him and Jo, and settles on the couch, absently flipping through the channels. Jo walks past him, hitting him on the back of his head before taking a seat next to him.
“Is Sam okay?” Cas asks, the words coming out a little slurred.
"’m fine, Cas," he says softly, his voice stuttering like a broken record.
A single question still remains unanswered, hanging heavy between them—
“That sounds like an interesting story,” Castiel encouraged begrudgingly, and from next to him, Dean let out a pained noise.
which just looks like a small spiky vinyl, and even a few of those orb things Raphael attacked their camp with.
"It's gotta be Braxton-Hicks," Jo says from the backseat.
?" Jo quirks a brow as they head to the counter, and Dean's not sure if he's even got everything on Eileen's list.
Dean chuckled, "You mean a heart-to-heart or are you talking 'bout my shirt?"
"Come on, Cas." Dean groans. "They need you here and they need a human to get into the vault and grab the stuff."
"In a couple of hours if we wanna catch a motel for the night."
"Sometimes you remind me of that mole," Castiel said. "You are always doing what is necessary regardless of the circumstances or the consequences."
"You're Agent Bonham," he said, soothing down the lapel of his coat. Cas left the trenchcoat back at the motel, and Dean wasn't going to complain. Even with the suit not being the right fit, Cas looked good. Really good. "Just let me do the talking."
“What do you mean?”
Dean shakes his head a little.
"Then we sit back and relax."
"Back at you," Ivan says, the grin in his voice evident.
"Socialize," she grinned, amusement glinting in her eyes. "Ask around for details, anything and everything can be useful. You guys are feds, you can figure out the rest."
Sam stared at him incredulously, “Dean’s a terrible influence on you.”
“Mhm, yeah,” Dean says, knocking an empty bottle away with the back of his palm. “You want some?”
The other neighbors had mentioned that the house has remained unoccupied for a while, four years to be precise. Castiel glances at Dean, who is watching Olivia cautiously. Cas opens his mouth to ask her who she is referring to, but is stopped by Dean’s fingers squeezing his wrist.
"I was singin' Taylor Swift," he whispered. "Shhh, don't tell Sammy."
“Good.” Dean ducked his head, grinning like a madman. If it wasn’t good, Dean would have had to make major changes in his plans at the end of the day.
"How long have you–"
just a swirl of light. It’s strange, yet liberating. The part of him that feels guilty over having so little attachment to everything that Castiel was for billions of years doesn’t manage to over power his joy of feeling the weight of the world lift off his shoulders.
Dean feels the bed dip next to him. “Do you need some water? Or anything for your headache?” Cas asks.
—Dean thinks—
"Here," Castiel's voice startles Dean out of his thoughts. His blue eyes are less wide and panicked and he's holding the band-aid in his hand, ready to wrap it around Dean's finger.
"That seems like an impressively long vacation," Castiel commented, eyeing Dean with a smile. "The beach sounds amenable right now."
"Apparently Eileen's been having contractions since late at night but she thought it was the baby kicking or something," Sam says, handing him a cup of coffee.
As the staff shuffled out of the room, Castiel leapt on his feet, catching sight of Dean talking to one of his coworkers. When he spotted him, Dean mumbled something to the woman and walked over to him, grinning widely.
******
“Well, I would like to celebrate anyways,” Castiel opens the door to the guest room and throws his bag onto the bed, shutting it behind him. “Get dressed, we can go out to the bar.”
“Yeah well, fuck you.” Dean grabbed his stuff and headed towards the door. “I’m starving.”
"Oh wow." A red haired woman, whom Castiel assumed was Charlie, smiled at him. "Hey, Cas. I'm Charlie. Dean must have told great things about me."
and Castiel is gone.
Castiel’s eyes snapped up, and...
Dean winced and Castiel's face dropped.
"Overwhelm?" Sam stares at him incredulously. "Cas, do you have any idea how Dean's been since you…"
"You could torture me all you want, but there is nothing you're going to get from me," Akobel sits up, his hands supporting him on either side.
got possessed by Satan and saved the world?”
"We're not sure. There was an explosion took place beyond the creek." Camael says, eyes wide and panicked, "I have sent a group of angels to assess the situation."
“What else am I supposed to get from–” the meaning of Cas’s words slowly clicks into place. He blinks, “You mean you’re gay?”
"My car is compromised. Cassie. Don’t ask too many questions.” Gabriel said. “Now give me the keys and I’ll get going.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas opens his mouth to speak, but Dean’s on a roll.
The Kitsune’s body goes up in flames, matching the rhythm of the rest of the flames engulfing the clearing around them. Castiel quickly packs his things, rolling his eyes at the over-exaggerated innocence in Jaime’s voice as she informs the 911 operator about the fire. Something about an elaborate camping trip with her friends is a part of her fake story about how she ran into the fire, and Castiel mouths at her to hang up quickly, biting down an amused smile at her enthusiasm when it comes to fake backstories.
Castiel knew he had to open his eyes, but the blinding pain behind his temples was making it difficult. In the back of his mind, he knew something was wrong, and with effort he pried his eyes open, blinking hard to focus on the room around him. Rough cobblestone walls stretched around him and as the walls got closer to the ceiling, intricate carvings of runes became visible, and Castiel recognized them as Eddnian. His own hands were bound behind his back to a pillar, ivy twisting around them and brushing against Cas’s shoulders.
Dean swallows, ignoring the clawing in his throat, "She died after giving birth to Sam. I don't remember much, it all just happened so soon."
“Of course,” Cas replied, his body going pliant, and Dean hummed happily. “Are you comfortable?”
"You would think so, wouldn’t you?” Castiel caresses his cheek, feeling the light scratch of stubble on his palm. “You’re special, Dean.”
"Are these worn only by grandmothers?" Cas question, the genuine curiosity in his voice making it so hard not to laugh.
“We’re not sure, Commander,” Camael says, looking scared out of his wits. “I was on my way back from
******
“Is there anyone who had any disagreements with either or them?”
. Dean felt like he was about to pass out, hot flashes climbing up his spine like a parasite.
“I am sure Sam would be infuriated,” Castiel replies. “We can split into three groups and scour the personal heavens. Camael, you take one group, and Nemiah, you can take the other.”
"Commander!" The angel gets all up in Cas' personal space, smiling a little too wide. "I'm so glad you are here."
When John drank too much and cursed up a storm leaving Sammy teary eyed and shaking—to when the world was just a nudge away from ending, Dean said those words, no matter if he believed it or not.
“Goddammit, Cas. I just told you I loved you,” Dean huffed out a laugh despite himself. “If we start listing our soap opera moments, we’ll be here all day.” Cas looked away sadly and Dean lifted his hands to cup his face. “Every time you screwed up, you did it to protect me and Sammy. You’re nothing but good, Cas. Hell, none of us are perfect but fuck that.”
Dean doesn’t have enough neurons firing at the moment to figure out what that means. He blinks at the screen one last time, noting that they’re on the third episode, before letting his eyes fall shut.
"Brave. The word is brave," Dean mumbled. "Sorry if I freaked you out."
them?"
“Hey, my friend Clarence helped,” she elbows, grinning widely. “Swell fella, that one.”
“I forgave you a long time ago,” Cas says, his voice coming out strangely hoarse. Even if Dean wants to keep letting the wedge between them grow wider and deeper until they could be watered down to mere acquaintances
Dean snorted. “If this goes south, I can’t even begin to think how awkward it’d be.”
"You don't have to," Castiel assures him. "We need all the help we can to do this, and I have to work with angels, but I'm not going to ask you to let them order you around."
Dean braves his eyes up to Cas in the rearview mirror, "This ain't my first rodeo, Cas."
in hell, not a reliable source."
"Oh yeah?"
In the midst of the pleasant scenery, Dean almost misses the lump on the floor.
“Popcorn’s done,” Sam said cheerfully, and added with an eye roll, “Make sure to come and eat.”
"I was out walking and found this guy lying unconscious in the snow," he rushes out. "And we're not a thing or anything, that's not gonna happen."
"Seriously?" Nemiah croaks.
"Dean?"
Ruby rolls her eyes, swatting his hand away. “I heard you the first ten times.”
******
Dean nudged him softly as he dug into his dinner, making sure not to get too drunk and to keep Cas from getting drunk. Cas kept glancing at him throughout the whole meal and Dean couldn’t blame him. He had been acting dodgy for a couple of days now, and Cas was the type who got worried over non-existent problems. He tried his best to reassure Cas, even going to the extent of feeding Cas pie from his own plate which earned a few exaggerated gasps from the table.
“None taken,” Cas smiled as though Dean was the most amusing person in existence. Sam rolled his eyes, pressing a knuckle to his eyes to quench the burn behind his temple from the lack of sleep.
"I know how hard this is for you, man. I appreciate you doing this." Dean says. "Now, what's this entrance you were talking about?"
He pulled his phone out to message Cas.
In hindsight, Dean must have been a pain in the ass to deal with. Cas was a bit messed up after he lost his grace, and it was justified. The guy had been overdue for a breakdown. That didn't stop Dean from being worried. He can't even begin to comprehend how much it must have sucked to be something one moment and a whole other species the next. He had poked and prodded, camping out in front of Cas's room, being as annoying as he could manage until he had riled Cas up enough for him to come out of his room just to yell at Dean. He didn't care—not as long as he managed to get some food into his system.
"That smells so good," Cas hums, scrunching his nose to sniff the air.
Jaime sighs softly, "I miss them. So much," she murmurs. "Mom and Dad weren't exactly parents of the year. They used to fight a lot, yell at each other and then turn around and yell at us, but at the end of the day, they were our mom and dad, you know?"
Cas glares harder, the look sending extremely mixed signals to Dean's anatomy. He steps forward into Dean's space, involuntarily making him back away towards the wall. A hand lands on his chest, holding him down, but Dean's sure his legs won't move even if he tried; not when Cas is looking at him like
If the Winchester’s had anything in common, it was caring about others all the time and lack of subtlety and Jess was checking all the boxes. When Dean told Sam and Jess his plans, they both almost yelled loud enough for Cas to hear it all the way at their place. That was the very same reason Dean didn’t tell them until the last minute after he had everything planned. Charlie was way better at acting cool than Dean imagined. Then again, Charlie was so many things.
Before Castiel can protest—not that he knows why he would do such a thing—Sam slips into the hallway, leaving Castiel alone in the war room. He wonders what Sam meant about Dean's condition. For a terrible moment, he thinks Dean might have been sick or hurt, but Jack would have let him know if that were the case. Dean would have been upset, he knows that much, but the hunter is resilient and would have pushed through because he had to. It's something about Dean—among the innumerable other qualities—that Castiel admires as well as despises; knowing Dean would find a way to keep himself afloat no matter what while shutting away his emotions in the process.
"What's it?"
Castiel doesn’t take long enough to decipher what Dean is hinting at. He leaps to his feet, wincing when his wounds protest. In a swift motion, Dean is right by his side, an arm curled around his waist.
——————
That was one hell of a question. Honestly, the reason couldn’t be compiled into a single sentence. Dean was a hairbreadth away from kissing Cas, back at the party hall. Cas kept looking at Dean the whole evening like there was something worth seeing in him. Cas called himself lucky to have Dean. Cas kissed his knuckles like Dean was precious and deserving. Cas told him it was okay.
He shakes his head, pulling himself out of his thoughts and focuses on the rare chance of getting to ride Baby and enjoy the purr of her engine. The route back to his apartment is off the main road, and is completely empty which is uncharacteristic especially for a weekend. His phone vibrates where it lies on the seat next to him and Dean catches the tail end of a message notification from Sam before the scene goes blank. When his eyes return back to the road, his heart all about stops. In a rare moment of clarity, he slams the brakes hard, his car following the motions of his beating heart and coming to a screeching halt.
“Just not here.” Dean said, “It’s a total douche move to pull at someone’s wedding, let alone your brother’s.”
Castiel had fought his way through heavenly battles that would have left The Battle of Somme looking like a children's quarrel. He had seen the first spark of the supernova and had witnessed civilizations rise and crumble into dust. He had slashed and diced through whips and chains of hell to rescue the soul of the righteous man. He was a soldier of heaven, sharpened like a double-edged sword with the grace that coursed through his very being.
"He won't leave, Sammy," Dean said with such conviction in his voice that Castiel, for a moment, doubted if he would ever be able to leave Dean's side. It didn't matter. This was just Dean's concussion talking. When he woke up next morning, Dean would remember why Castiel was in his life to begin with, and what he represented.
“Huh, I guess,” Dean breathed out. “Gotta have something on you so you don’t get bored of me.” It was only when the words left his mouth that Dean’s brain decided to catch up. He looked away from Cas’s steady gaze, waiting for the earth to split open and swallow him.
Dean remained quiet, gazing at the falling rain as they sat side by side, warmth coursing through their skins. It was comforting, just as every moment with Dean was. The hunter was always a flurry of emotions and colors, soul so bright and full of passion, Castiel admits there have been times when he got lost in its divinity. Now Dean was all skin and solid, pressed against Castiel's side. Yet, Castiel felt the same frazzled excitement as his eyes tracked the curve of Dean's cheekbones where it dipped into his stubbled jaw.
“Good,” Sam sighed. “He needs it.”
"What on earth is that?" Bobby looks back and forth between him and the blade.
Sam gave him a thumbs up and went back to his head in his books.
"You know
“It didn’t matter, Dean,” Cas sighs, gripping the wheel tight enough that his knuckles turn white. “You might have had your reasons, but I was the one alone.”
“Son of a bitch!”
"Nice try." Ruby's eyes fall on Castiel. "Thanks for the rescue mission, by the way." She says, "I broke my back cleaning up the mess."
And that’s how Dean ends up sitting at the kitchen table on a Tuesday morning watching his best friend man the stove. Cas’s movements are awkward and he bitches and moans with every piece of bacon that sticks to the bottom of the pan. Dean can’t take his eyes off him. His sweatpants ride low on his hips and every turn and lift of his arm reveals an inch of tan skin that Dean wants nothing more than to press his lips to.
"I told him you went to get a drink and will be back soon. So he went to bed."
"You better," Dean nudges his nose before planting one on his lips.
"Not that I care but the hair tucking and rocking back and forth on her heels?" Dean scoffed. "If I'd looked away for a moment she'd have jumped your bones."
“It would’ve been much better if you’d get your head out of your ass for once.”
"Who would've seen that coming," Sam says, tone dripping with sarcasm.
to be thrown around. He likes jaws sharp enough to cut glass and hands soft enough to cup his cheek and make him forget about the world just for one night. He likes harsh laughs and breathy gasps. He wants to be wanted. Show him the promise of a good time and Dean would follow.
“I made it this far,” Cas smiled up at the ceiling. “Goodnight, Dean.”
“Okay,” Cas mumbled, wringing his hands together, looking small and tired it broke Dean’s heart a little.
"Zeppelin," Dean muttered, turning to Castiel. "C’mere."
Dean reminds himself—a futile effort since he finds that fact incriminatingly hot.
Happy deancas anniversary in advance, y'all.
So that was where they sat for what could be hours, enjoying the rare moment of steadiness and unhurried breaths, a fleeting moment Castiel wanted to savor before it inevitably fizzled away to another apocalypse to diffuse. Every glance at Dean through the corner of his eyes only solidified that it was all worth it.
"Actually children have the advantage of being smaller in size," Cas shoots back. "Besides, they are much more tactful than adults."
Dean blinks at the man, fumbling for an answer. His storm grey eyes stare at Dean with concern. The man is gorgeous in a Greek God sort of way, tight chest and dusty blonde hair.
"I will accompany him." Tamoah adds, before Castiel can object. "You are critical to us, Castiel. Besides, if something happens to you, we don't want to know what your Winchester would do to us."
There's a lifetime in his hands, only Cas wouldn't be there to spend it with him.
“I hope this fight is worth the lives that have been lost.” Akobel ushers.
"I know," Castiel replied as they pulled apart.
“I love you,” Dean blurted out, waiting for the world to explode or the Jurassic era to come back in full force and eat them up whole. It didn’t happen. Huh, go figure. He wiped his eyes on the back of his hand, staring at the faded Pink Floyd logo on Cas’s shirt. “I love you,” he said again, just to be on the sure side.
Those things can work itself out in the morning. Right now, Dean had two options in front of him. Order a pizza and catch up on Ozark with his beer to keep him company or call Benny and head to a bar like a normal person on a weekend.
Cas has his hand raised half way as though he was about to knock and Dean flushes head to toe, expertly swallowing his tongue when he needs it the most.
Dean rolled his eyes, "Slow down, Hermione. Go watch some porn like a normal person."
"We can see where we are going, dumbass. I was asking if you can see the vaults."
"One body, no head," Dean replied, grimacing. "The head might've rolled off."
"Fuck off," Dean grumbled, head falling to Castiel's shoulder.
“You too, sweetheart,” Dean called back, standing in the middle of the room looking a little lost.
Dean ducked his head, “Yeah, you did.”
"I don't want to be stuck here doing nothing," Cas spoke.
******
Jess shook her head in resignation. “Since that’s settled, it’s time to bring out the pie.” She padded into the kitchen. Sam grinned at her, cartoon heart eyes and everything.
"Let go, baby." Dean mumbles, playing of the pet name like a calculated choice. "Fuck my mouth."
Cas has a hundred questions to ask and Dean grows fonder of the angel with the way every answer lights up his whole face. Dean leaves Cas for a couple of minutes to get groceries—a lot of coffee at Castiel's special request—and returns to find his friend in a plant shop clutching a succulent in his hand.
Cas' voice is barely a whisper when he speaks, "Do I need to call Sam?"
Sam flipped him off, turning back to the mirror to fuss over his hair.
Sam laughed, "Watch this." he said, grinning conspiratorially. "Dean, if you don't wanna do it, I can be Cas’s husband."
Castiel scowls at Dean, finding himself unable to deny the man’s request.
"Well, we had our own spa, if that counts." Castiel shrugged.
"Yeah, even Cas said I was going white." Dean chuckled.
"Electrical signals, I believe."
Dean doesn't reply, simply takes a step closer, and Castiel follows his cue until they are just a feet apart. Dean's hand reaches out to him, grabbing the sleeve of his trenchcoat as though he is made of glass and might shatter any moment, and Castiel too wonders how long would it be before he shatters into pieces at Dean's feet.
"I'm sure they will," Castiel nodded along.
He tries to remember how he got here. He remembers light, something dark like ink and a lot of fire, so much more than usual. He remembers feeling peaceful and content and comes to the conclusion that he’s concussed because happiness and hell doesn't go together.
Cas snatched it from his hands. "I have nothing to say for myself."
For a moment, Castiel slants towards the idea of appearing in front of Dean, the calling of his soul truly hard to ignore. Though heaven has no particular restraint against showing himself to Dean, Castiel thinks it’s unwise as the man might have a difficult time taking in all the facts. The fact that he alone is the one responsible for saving the world.
Dean's soul flares up for a fraction of a second. He catches Castiel's gaze, "How many girls is Lilith planning to use for this?”
He flies around the cloudy sky for a few hours, finding himself circling over Bobby Singer's house eventually. He senses the content hum of Dean's soul, waves of warmth spreading out to Castiel. He finds himself in Dean's room, staring at the sleeping man. He does not wish to wake Dean up, so he stays there silently, just as he used to when he soothed Dean's nightmares the first few times.
“Just close your eyes and pick one, Cas,” Dean urged.
"Sir, I'll have to ask you to stand back," Dean put out his hand to block him. "Call 911 and stay away from the body. Messing with the crime scene can get you arrested."
“Take a guess, buddy.”
The door closed behind them and Dean rubbed a hand over his face, "Man, I hate witches."
“That’s my excuse too,” Dean sighed, nudging Cas to get him to look at him. “You’re sure you’re gonna be okay?”
He put his drink down, turning to look at Nadia on the tanning bed next to his, “I’m not sure. Hunting’s always gonna be there, that’s all I know,” he sighed. “What about you?”
He tips his head down to press a kiss to Castiel's hair and lets his head fall back, the auburn glow of the ceiling filling his vision as he falls back asleep.
"Uh, I'm good," Dean nods, eyes fixed on the screen, trying not to be upset when he feels Castiel's touch withdraw. "Dude, I think we should start with Jurassic Park. It's about dinosaurs, but you've probably seen the real deal so you can tell me all the inaccuracies."
"Watch it, kiddo," Dean grinned, and sure enough, seconds later he had a ninety pound Jo Harvelle shaped Koala on his back.
"You didn't," Sam finishes.
“No, don’t worry,” Sam says, and to think this is the guy Dean sold his soul for. “Listen, did you talk to him yet?”
It doesn’t take Cas long to notice his presence. “Hello, Dean.” It’s gentle and kind as always, like he sees something in Dean that he himself cannot find.
The waitress came around to take their orders and Dean struggled around with the bits and pieces of Italian he picked up over the course of the last few weeks.
"Christ, you're smitten." Jo outright laughed at him, and it was not like he was expecting any heart-to-heart from her. Next second, he had to eat his words as Jo reached up and pulled him into a hug. "Good for you, Dean."
After a while, Dean's hand stills, "Hey, Cas?"
"If you're not FBI then what are you? Ghostbusters?"
"Dean, I-" A knock echoes on the other side of the door. Sam peaks in, his eyes landing instantly on Castiel.
"’S useless, then," Dean mumbled, eyes flitting across Castiel's face.
"I'm not sure," he replies honestly. "I want nothing more than to go back to Dean, but what if…"
Sam frowned, remembering some of the muffled shouting that he heard last night, all of it making sense right now. The expression on Cas's face made it clear that this wasn't a temporary low running tank.
“Loud and fucking adorable,” Dean laughs fondly. “She’s been a little sick but it’s getting better now. She’s only about to start teething and Sammy and Eileen are already tired. I’m sitting here only ‘cause Bobby and Ellen are there to help them out.”
Until, one night, Cas broke down the door of that barn in Illinois and punted him all the way out of the field. Dean’s first thought had been a solid, passionate and heartfelt
“So, get this,” Sam pulls his laptop open. “The house was built in 1987 along with the rest of the properties. And since then, five families have lived there.”
******
“Nah, it’s a milk run,” Sam waves him away. “You guys stay here and keep looking.”
“You deserve happiness, Dean. You deserve good things. Let yourself have it,” Cas said softly. “Be it me or someone else, you deserve to have what you want. And I would understand if it isn’t me. I know I have betrayed your trust way more times than-”
“Hey, you wanna get out of here?” Dean asked, adding when Castiel blinked at him, surprise in his eyes, “We could walk around a while, somewhere no one’s doing a keg stand in their underwear.”
"Nothing."
"No wonder if all happened so fast," he snorts. "Shit, Sammy. I should be the one looking after you guys."
They pulled up to the parking lot, blending in with the rest of the staff rushing into the building. Dean grabbed a badge and stuffed it into Cas's jacket pocket.
“You think so?” Dean asks.
Castiel shook his head, smiling. The sky cleared bit by bit and sunlight poured in, highlighting Dean's beautiful features with much more vigor. It was no mystery of the universe that Cas was in love with Dean; he had had enough time to realize that—between quiet days spent staring at the sky, waiting for an answer from God to cold nights at the community shelter with his coat folded underneath his head as a makeshift pillow—and now it was just a fact. Castiel was irrevocably in love with Dean; the man who remained righteous even when there was no archangel to give him the title, the man who cared as hard as he fought. It ached to love Dean, yet Cas wouldn’t trade it for the world.
