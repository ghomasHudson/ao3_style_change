Cas bit his lip, cheeks crimson from the onslaught of compliments. It was even worse coming from Dean's soft voice, and he was once again brought back to his earlier thoughts. What would it be like to date Dean? Would he use pet-names? Cas wished he could find out.
Castiel put his phone down with a heavy heart, and that night, he fell asleep with a sense of uneasiness filling his body and one thought in his mind.
But then the person behind him spoke, and Cas finally got a whiff of the rotten smell. He immediately recognised it as
Cas was determined to keep the laugh trying to bubble up his throat inside, though. And, in the end, he succeeded at staying quiet.
If kissing Dean was this good, Castiel never wanted to stop.
It returned full force when he heard his brother’s voice calling his name.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean turned to the omega, who was already looking at him with nervous eyes.
He reached his hands down, working Cas' button and zipper before pulling off to get rid of his pants.
'The whiteboard and privacy with Dean, please.' Gabriel nodded, getting him the hand-held whiteboard and marker before going up the stairs.
"F-fuck, Cas~" Dean's eyes fluttered closed, and Cas watched him for a moment. He looked so beautiful.
Castiel was so lost in his pleasure that he didn't hear the footsteps until it was too late, Gabriel bounding into the room like he owned the place, sucking obscenely on a lollipop.
idea.
“Dean, you’re not going to keep him outside all night, are you?” She asked, smile growing, full of adoration and love for her son. Dean could tell where Dean got his gorgeous smile from. When he noticed the elder teens blush and sweaty hands, he idly wondered if this was a good idea.
The alpha didn't seem too keen on sharing him, so it wasn't likely he would tell someone about this.
mercy on him? Or would he just go for it?
"I would love that," There Dean went, casually calming all of his fears.
"Hey, Dean?" Cas mumbled against his lips a little while later, when they got back into it after making sure Gabe was officially gone and could no longer interrupt like the cockblocking asshole he was.
Once it was just him there, leaning against the door, Dean long gone, he realised just how truly in love he was.
"Fuck, fuck, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, shit I-I~" And suddenly Dean was spurting out cum so forcefully, some of it landed on his neck.
-Mentions of grooming
if you
He put his hand on Dean's bulge, only for Dean to pull back.
Castiel startled when he heard the chair across from him move.
Please please please leave a comment! They make me so happy and inspire me to keep writing
"Here you go, sweetheart." Cas smiled, grabbing the soft clothes from Dean, wasting no time to put them on. As expected, the shirt was too big, and the sweats were only long after tying the drawstrings.
At least
Dean eventually slipped Cas' shirt off, looking at him with a heated gaze, never breaking eye contact as he leaned down to tongue and suck at Cas' nipples. Cas' breath caught in his throat from the absolute love that burned in Dean's eyes paired up with the corporeal feeling on his chest, and Cas really never even stood a chance. Dean has ruined him for anyone else. And Cas wouldn't have it any other way.
"Pick up your books, put them on the shelf." Cas nodded, hastily grabbing everything he dropped, placing them on a shelf next to a few empty buckets.
No seventeen-year-old wanted to be awake before the stupid sun to get ready and mingle with assholes. None that he knew, anyways.
“You worthless piece of shit.” Alistair growled, leaving Cas alone in the foyer as he stormed off to the bedroom.
he thought to himself,
Cas didn't know, he was barely paying attention. He was sitting in Dean's lap, with Dean's arms around his waist, and he couldn't help but squirming a little, which in turn made Dean's dick twitch in his pants.
Cas looked up at that, and another wave of hurt came when Alistair obediently listened. He never listened to Cas. About anything.
Definitely not the worst place he's been taken.
"I wasn't sure if you were playing a joke on me or not." He murmured, face hot in shame.
Dean went slow, hands moving to Cas' waist, pulling him closer as he pressed into the kiss a bit more. Cas' own hands were on Dean's neck, holding him there like he's seen in the movies.
"Come over today. After school. I can take your brother home for you like last time."
When Dean was finally naked as well, Cas greedily drank the sight of him in. Especially that beautiful cock. Holy
Gabriel scoffed, rolling his eyes. ‘Cas, come on. He’d be the luckiest man on earth to go on a date with you. And if the rumours haven’t scared him off yet, then they won’t if you ask him out. He obviously already knows about them. And yet, he’s still your friend. Hell, he defended you. Protected you. I think he might already have feelings for you.’ He pointed out, But Cas just shook his head.
"Come on, Dean. Hurry up," Cas whined, bucking his hips and Dean chuckled lowly.
Cas didn't understand why it wasn't with his car keys, but he wasn't stupid enough to ask.
Not because Dean believed omegas are lesser beings because of their orientation, but because he felt happy and soft when he thought of Cas maybe someday being his omega.
Cas shrugged, "Sure, just as long as we make room for homework."
"Hi," Dean replied, flashing his dazzling smile. Jesus, he was gorgeous. That smile made Cas fall in love in the first place. "What's a pretty thing like you doing out here all alone?" Dean teased, and even Cas relaxed enough for a smile to slip out. "Especially when their awesome boyfriend set up their favorite movie with snacks to eat while we watch."
Dean licked his lips, glancing at Cas, then the road, then back to Sam.
"Man, shoulda told Sammy to stay put. Didn't think your brother was a middle schooler, so I told mine to take the bus today, instead of having me take him home."
Dean did so with little reluctance, starting out slow at first until it was clear it didn't hurt. Cas was letting out little whimpers and moans, clutching at Dean's arms as the other boy pleasured him just how he wanted, how he
Dean must still be grooming him, trying to build up that sense of comfort. Castiel promised himself that he'd research grooming topics later, to get an idea of what to expect.
When Dean pulled back again, his eyes were nearly black as he grinned salaciously. "I could always finger you, though. Get you used to having me inside." And a jolt went through him so suddenly, it killed all of the butterflies in his stomach, leaving behind a buzz of electricity that spread through his entire body, striking his groin and making his toes curl in pleasure.
Cas couldn't be too sad because he got another hug at the door, albeit shorter this time.
"I believe you. I promise, I believe you." And then Cas' entire world tipped on its axis because Dean was
“Why’s the house so fuckin’ dirty?” Cas’ smile faltered, feeling the sting deep in his gut.
But, again, it soothed him to pretend like it will happen eventually.
Okay, he really needed to calm down. Wait, how long have they been hugging? Okay, this was probably weird. He should really pull away... okay, just a few more seconds and then you have to stop.
Cas looked away for a second, trying to keep his voice even as he answered. “He does. W-when he’s drunk. But, when that happens he,” Cas stopped for a second, pushing the tears back. “When that happens he thinks I’m you.”
"Mom!" Dean groaned, flushed in what Cas thought was embarrassment.
Which wasn't really surprising.
Castiel was more focused on his studies than anything else, which meant he didn't socialize much, and this made it hard to be popular. Which was something he was always fine with, most of the group were idiots, and he had a promising future. But if being popular meant he could talk to Dean, Cas desperately wished he could go back in time and do it all again.
“Don’t kiss me. It’s gross.” Cas looked away, trying to keep the hurt from his voice as he continued on.
Another possibly, what if Dean was playing a prank on him and Cas was about to walk right into his trap?
Should he be? He was getting into bed with a nearly naked alpha, with no one else around, and with the bedroom door closed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean has liked Castiel ever since freshman year, and his feelings have only grown since then.
Dean groaned as his alarm went off at too-fucking-early O'clock. Being a junior was great and all, but he wished he could just be done with school. Or at least a senior, so he was closer to being done.
Cas was watching as Benny and Lisa bantered back and forth, not really paying attention to his surroundings. So he jumped when Dean's hand was suddenly on his thigh, and fuck, Dean started
Dean was kissing him again, though, cutting off the whine Cas hadn't been aware of making, and everything was so good, so perfect, so full of love that Cas suddenly didn't care about his orgasm. He already had everything he could ever want, anything else was just a nice bonus as long as Dean kept holding him in his arms like this.
They were driving in relative silence, radio playing rock music softly. It was a comfortable silence, one Cas didn't feel he needed to fill.
Dean made sure to sit in the same spot the next day, hoping the omega would sit there too. Garth, thankfully, didn't seem too bitter about the fact that he was sitting on the opposite side of the room now.
Sometimes it may take me longer to upload chapters. First I write it in a notebook -mainly when I'm in school supposed to be doing stuff-, then transfer it onto google docs using my school Chromebook, before finally copying and pasting from my phone into both WattPad and here. Before publishing it I look for '/'s so I can put the words in italics. It's a very long process :)
Other people just kept away from him because he was different, which automatically made him weird to everyone else. It was only the second day of Junior year and the physical assault has already started.
'Thank you,' He smiled a bit, hugging the both of them before leaving to make his way downstairs.
The unmistakable sound of the lock clicked from behind him, then he was being turned around and pushed up against the shelves.
Dean's breath hitched, but he didn't address Cas. With a grin, the teen moved so he was straddling Dean.
Maybe it wouldn't even be all that bad. Dean wasn't the worst smelling, and he put on the act of being nice to Cas.
to tell
"How gracious of you." He said dryly, but he leaned in happily when Cas bent forward to kiss him again.
Not that Dean wanted to bed him. He just wanted Cas to like his nest. Maybe even want to enter it. In a non-sexual way, of course.
And then she turned those beautiful green eyes onto him.
It was refreshing, sharing the workload with someone else, and not having to do it all himself. No matter how wary he was of Dean, he had to admit that the alpha was very smart.
With a sly grin, he ground down against Dean, making the older boy cry out and pull away from the kiss.
"Hold on, baby. Something I wanna try," Licking his palm, Dean stroked over Cas' cock a few times, making his dick jump and spit out some precum as he writhed under his boyfriend's careful ministrations,
"Oh," A slow smile spread across Dean's face, "That's okay. I can teach you. I
Dean spit in his hand, and though it should be disgusting, it just fed into Cas' desire even more.
He took a breath, bracing himself, because he was about to say the words,
And, the entire room smelled like apple pie with whipped cream, grease and oil, the smell of earth after a thunderstorm, and lounging in bed on Sundays. It almost had hints of... comfort and safety.
“Cas, that’s not true. Everyone you date is just an asshole who doesn’t know a good thing when they see it. You will find someone who wants you simply because you’re you. But not if you stay with him. Because nobody is going to go after someone who has a boyfriend. And even if you don’t believe that, at least get away because of you. He treats you like you’re nothing. He uses you. And he hurts you. This is the very definition of emotional abuse. He won’t even let you have a job! Not only is he hurting you, but he’s controlling your life.”
The rumor that pissed him off the most, though, was that Cas was faking being a mute. Dean has known the boy since the eighth grade after he skipped sixth and seventh grade, joining Dean’s algebra and English class. All of these years later, Dean has never seen or heard Cas speak.
Cas blushed, looking at the floor. Did Dean really see that when he looked at Cas? How could anyone see anything besides a weird nerd?
"Wait, wait. Slow down Cas. I'm not gonna fuck you." Dean said, trying to put as much conviction into the statement despite their current situation.
Castiel slowly slid down to the floor, eyes still watery. He roughly wiped them away with the back of his hand, chest tightening as he felt the throbbing bruise on his back. He picked his glasses off the floor, wiping them off before putting them back on his face. He knew as soon as Gabriel -his adopted brother- found out, he’d be pissed.
A boy, who could only be Sam, was laughing, Dean trying harder to suppress his giggles, and goddammit, Dean Winchester was an asshole.
"She's gorgeous," Dean was beaming, and a flock of butterflies were flying around inside of Cas at that radiant smile being directed at him.
" He waggled his eyebrows at the joke, and Cas snorted, rolling his eyes in fond amusement. Dean truly was ridiculous at times. But Cas couldn't help but feel awed at how much effort Dean was going to put in to make sure their first time was perfect.
Dean slowly maneuvered Cas -who went along without protest- so his head was in Dean's lap, eyes focused on his face.
Dean groaned as his dick spent into Cas' hand, a few droplets landing on his face, which he didn't mind in the least.
Dean put his own sweats on before giving Cas a quick kiss on his way to turn off the light.
Castiel was so surprised by the question, he let out a reflexive "Yeah," and almost immediately regretted it.
him, eyes looking as beautiful as ever in the morning light.
Dean playfully growled, hitting her arm. "Hands off, he's mine. Isn't that right, sweet boy?"
Sorry for the late update! I hope the contents of this chapter make up for it, though.
Dean never wanted Cas to be afraid. Especially not around him.
He whined, hiding his face in Dean's shoulder, ignoring as Lisa cooed at him, probably mistaking his desperation for shyness.
"Now if I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd be quite jealous," She teased Dean, and Cas went from surprised to shy, face brighter than a ripe tomato.
Dean grinned, getting close enough to hear.
“Like the most handsome man alive.” Amelia smiled softly, giving him another kiss.
It was a Friday anyway, and he preferred to get all of his homework done before the weekend. Maybe it was a good thing that he didn't go.
Dean thought he might be asexual, which he definitely insisted was okay with him, but Cas knew he wasn't, not really. He's suspected demi for a while, though he never voiced his thoughts to Dean.
"'M fine, Cas. Deal with your creepy brother while I try to get the room to stop spinning," Dean was obviously amused, though, so Cas figured he hadn't hurt him too much in his flailing.
"I want it. Whatever you're willing to give to me, I want it." Dean smiled, hands travelling under Cas' -well, technically his- shirt.
“We’re supposed to be there in half an hour.” He mumbled, getting back up to go get ready.
And then he'd
"Get to class before I keep you here forever." And as much as Cas wanted that, he seriously needed to leave. So, he stepped on his tippy-toes and pressed a shy kiss to Dean's cheek before unlocking the door and heading to class.
He watched the omega to see his reaction to the news, and when he turned to meet his gaze, Dean almost startled when he realised how electrifying those eyes were when focused on him.
Thursday came and Cas was standing at his locker, the hallway empty as everyone was either in class, or at lunch. He was supposed to be in the latter, but he forgot his history textbook and was planning on getting a head start on the homework.
"A lemon water will be good, thanks."
When he walked into the classroom, he was making his way to go sit by Garth when bright blue eyes caught his attention. He faltered long enough to take in the scent and holy fucking shit.
Dean was bright red, though, and he didn't look like he was ready to jump Cas' bones, so maybe this was okay?
He really went all out on the dinner. Filet mignon with rich balsamic glaze, garlic-parm zucchini sauté, and lemon-parmesan roasted potatoes.
Okay, so maybe Cas wouldn't be his omega sometime in the future.
Cas huffed, turning over on his side so that his back was turned to the stupid alpha.
"Not him. Someone else. A while ago."
-Sexual assault
But he was content to just lie there, letting his hair be messed with.
"How about music? What kind of music do you like? For me, it's classic rock all the way. Nothing compares to some Metallica and Led Zeppelin."
-Mentions of rape
‘Of course, Dean. I always come to your games.’ Dean was blushing when he read the writing on the notebook page, and if he noticed Castiel was too, he didn’t say anything.
"I know this great little place at the edge of town we can get some burgers. Then we can head back to my place for a movie." That sounded great, and Cas couldn't wait to see how the night progressed.
, this was harder than he thought it should be. He had lived it, saying it shouldn't be nearly as painful.
When he could finally breathe properly again, he looked up at Dean, who's dick was still hard, who's cheeks were red, who's eyes sparkled like little galaxies in the night sky, who was so goddamn beautiful it hurt to stare, and Cas fell just that little bit more in love.
-Domestic abuse
And then he realised one more thing before Dean came back out.
He's read
He scrolled down a few articles, checking off what Dean did.
"I'm not uncomfortable, Dean. Now, will you come to bed and hold me, please?"
Even after all of this, when Dean woke up, he knew for sure that was the best sleep he’s had in years. Cas was still asleep, and Dean smiled, kissing his neck softly. “Good morning, Cas.” He whispered lovingly, only to be shoved off the bed. “No-” Cas grumbled, snuggling back under the covers.
"So, do we want a slides presentation? Or something else?" Maybe Dean just wanted to work first? And then get pleasure from Cas?
there was that adorable head tilt.
Dean, of course, knew about all the rumors spread about Cas. The most well-known one was that Castiel was ay. Dean could only hope that it was true. Crushing on a straight guy was always heartbreaking. But even if it is or is not true, Dean is pretty pissed at people for starting the rumors in the first place. It wouldn’t take a genius to look at Cas and notice they bother him.
-Death of parent
"I will stay, Dean. And I will sleep in your bed, but
And then Dean finally,
Dean and Cas finally meet.
"Am not," He muttered petulantly. How dare Dean be all sweet and nice to him? Unfair.
“Welcome to my humble abode.” He teased, mocking what he called ‘chick flick’ movies. Cas wasn’t certain what movies that consisted of.
"I know what you mean, Cas. I'm really happy for you." Charlie was smiling at him, and Cas felt so filled to the brim with happiness, he was afraid it was gonna boil over. Everything just seemed
Once again, Dean and Cas are on two completely different pages
Dean hissed, hand moving to Cas' hair, tugging a little, and fuck yeah, that felt
He stayed behind a little when Cas went up to talk to the teacher and oh my god. That voice! It was like a fucking wet dream. Well, until he realised Cas was trying to get a new partner.
was nerve-wracking, to say the least. Alpha's have hurt him so much, and getting into bed may as well have been an invite into his body, right? But even after listing off all the reasons this was a bad idea in his head, Cas didn't believe Dean would do such a thing. He was... he was starting to trust him.
Also, please let me know if I missed any triggers.
"That's not really up to me, bud. You gotta ask Cas." He heard the omega take in a sharp breath, and no matter how curious Dean was about it, he wasn't gonna ask in front of Gabe and Sam.
"It's nice to see ya again, Cas." John said with a charming smile -definitely where Dean got his-, clapping the omega on the back as he walked by.
"What d'you want, Gabe?" He asked, slightly out of breath from the arousal that was still thrumming under his skin in anticipation, even through the humiliation he felt.
Without thinking about it, he tilted his head, exposing his neck and shivering when a pair of lips traveled against the length of it.
"G'night, love." He ssaid, voice muffled by Cas' skin.
"I think I specifically told you to get in bed and
took Cas' boxers off, releasing his rock hard cock from its prison.
Then, Dean was leaning back in, and this time Cas tilted his head up to meet the other boy in a sweet kiss.
"Awe, my boy begs so prettily for me. Don't worry, love, I've got you."
So, if Dean was just going to use him, why not get something out of it? Such as finally talking about how he felt.
-Molestation
a date?
"Get in, you dork." He shook his head with a secret smile, getting in the driver's side.
So, he wrote down his phone number, trying not to seem too eager as he handed it to Cas. Yeah, Dean knew his name. But his inner alpha purred when he referred to him as omega.
If you couldn't tell, Dean was losing his mind. Because Cas, the boy he's been fantasizing about since the eighth grade, yeah, that Cas. You caught up yet? Well, that Cas is iN DEAN'S ARMS!
to hide his stupidity.
-Mentions of grooming
"Stop itttt," He whined, jutting his lower lip out in a pout.
His alpha wanted to just nuzzle up to the omega's scent gland, mark him as his. But Dean wasn't a knothead, and even if he was, scenting is an intimate act that should really be consented to. He certainly wouldn't want some strange omega getting all cozy with his scent gland.
"I'm glad someone enjoys my cooking," She teased, throwing John a pointed look.
"Um- I was- uh, I was thirteen,"
He got up because while he would be fine with skipping school, he was Sam's transportation, and even though he was young, Dean knew he was going places. And Dean wasn't going to hinder him just because he wanted more sleep.
Dean was
It took Dean less time to calm down than it did Cas, and when he did, he was grinning at him.
“This is it.” Dean smiled, though his eyes hid some of his insecurities. Cas may not have picked up on it, but Dean wanted his approval.
Dean came back out before Cas could overthink it too much, thankfully.
You ever play Mortal Kombat? Bet I could kick your ass."
Dean grinned at him as he threw the pants behind him, leaving Cas in only his boxers.
confused. Why would Dean care? Or pretend to care? He understood that Dean was trying to groom him, but still. This seemed like a small thing, even then.
Dean saves Cas like a good alpha
Cas wondered about the other omega. Were they taken advantage of too? Were they forced into the car? Did Dean even know them? Or did he just figure they smelled good and decided to use them?
And, fuck. Maybe him trying to switch partners had nothing to do with Dean, but more with his subgender.
living here. And now that he was paying attention, there was also the hint of a female omega living here as well.
"Cas, he's my date tonight." Dean had this cute smile on his face, cheeks a soft red.
Castiel knew his brother had a point, and he would up and leave right now if he could. He had nothing to lose. The possessions that actually mean something to him are at Jimmy’s for safe-keeping. But, “Where would I even go? I have no money, no friends. I have nothing.” He said softly.
"I'll tell you when we get to my place."
A pretty blonde came over with a notepad when they were settled, giving Dean a wide smile.
The conversation slowly drifted to other, less important things, and soon Dean had Cas laughing so hard, he forgot all about the pain of his past.
Clearing his throat, he tried again. "I was thirteen and he, the alpha, was sixteen, lived next door. He would start sneaking into my bedroom and he- he-" He had to take a moment before forcing the words, "He did stuff to me." Out in one big breath.
Dean bit his lip against his smile, the weight of Cas' hand in his making him happier than he could properly express in his meager vocabulary.
It was gonna happen anyways, from Dean or someone random, so he might as well choose one who wouldn't try to share him. One who even acted decently at times.
And then Dean was pushing their erections together, and Cas felt a surge of want so strong pass through him, he would have collapsed into a gooey mess on the floor if Dean weren't holding him up.
"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Dean just whimpered, voice cracking as he talked. "Please don't leave me, Cas. I need you."
"Cas..." Dean said in a shaky voice, and Cas couldn't take it. He just
That sure as hell got Cas' attention, and he was shaking his head vehemently. He didn't need to bother Michael just because he was dumb enough to stick his ass out. He was practically
He quickly pieced together that it was
Monday at practice was not good.
Dean's breath hitched, and then he was wrapping his arms around the omega, pulling him closer before holding on tight. Cas sighed, eyes closing. Yet they soon snapped open when he heard a noise and
"It's his fault for being a fucking knot-tease!" Alistair squawked indignantly, causing Dean to growl, fist rearing back before a teacher, one Cas didn't recognize, was escorting Alistair away from the scene as another teacher told everyone to get to class.
Cas smiled as Dean took his hand again, a feeling Cas would never get tired of.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean, please," Cas' head was thrown back, eyes squeezed shut. He had no idea what he was begging for, only knew he needed it desperately.
"Um, pardon me?" Was that his voice quivering? Probably.
“Hey.” He said, beaming at Cas.
"Should I not have done that?" He asked, voice uncertain, and eyes questioning.
Why couldn't his body just be

Warnings at the bottom, please check it out if you have triggers!
Cas needed to pay attention before he misses the entire date.
Three. There were
Okay, I'm going to try updating each Saturday. We'll see how long that lasts, though.
But Dean only stayed there for a moment, kissing further down his body, stopping at the hem of Cas' jeans.
Cas squeaked in embarrassment, Jo and Dean laughing as he shyly nodded his head. Because, yes, he
That last fact had him wanting to curl up in his nest to wallow in his misery.
was the one about to cry because this omega was so strong, even with the shithole that has become of his life.
Dean has never bullied him or listen to the rumors that were spread. But at the same time, Castiel was convinced that Dean didn’t even know that he existed outside of the rumors. Cas went to every single football game, hiding from everyone and just focusing on Dean as he led the team to victory.
He shoved it down, because he's never done that before, and didn't totally feel safe anyway. He had to still be on guard because any moment could be the moment Dean drops the charade.
"I love burgers." He said in a dreamy sigh, and there Dean was again with that arousing chuckle of his.
“Who?” He asked, voice shaky. The guy winked as the cops pulled him away, and Cas didn’t even need to ask the question because he already knew the answer.
"You look so perfect like this So perfect for me." Dean slowly started to unbutton Cas' pants, giving him time to back out.
Cas looked at him with his adorable tilted head, eyes squinting, as if he were trying to detect suspicious undernotes. And, yeah. Dean should have been clearer.
For the first time since childhood, he had made his bed after waking up that morning, rearranging everything so it looked warm and inviting for the omega.
The police took him back to the station, asking him questions. When he was let go, he decided to pay someone a visit. Someone he hasn’t seen since high school.
Dean Winchester was the new kid at Lawrence High and had immediately made it onto the football team, something that automatically gave him popularity. But Cas was sure that even if he hadn't made it, he still would've been popular. Because Dean was the most beautiful person Castiel had ever laid eyes on. Add in his wit and sarcasm? Yeah, no way would he be a loser like Cas.
Jo came back a few minutes later, setting down their respective drinks. "You ready, love?" She asked, looking at Cas with a grin.
Then he went to his dresser, grabbing some sweats and an old shirt for Cas, and then another pair of sweats for himself, forgoing boxers for both of them.
"You must be Cas!" His mother said cheerily, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dean puffing up with pride.
Dean was currently stacking books onto the shelves, glancing over at Castiel every few seconds. The boy seemed to be working on his classes, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes ever time he changed subjects.
"You trusted me enough to be that vulnerable?" He asked, positively amazed, and Cas looked at him seriously, though the smile never left his face.
Mentions of mpreg
Dean didn't respond for several long moments, and then the blanket was shifting as Dean slowly got closer. He stopped a few inches away, and Castiel rolled his eyes before pushing back, his back plastering to Dean's front.
It soothed Cas, made him feel safe enough let out an answering purr, softer than Dean's, but just as affectionate. Castiel wasn't sure he's ever been happier than he was currently, wrapped up in the arms of an alpha he was rapidly developing feelings for.
"No promises."
He was a little disappointed when he didn't get to hear his voice. Because the omega hasn't spoken once in the past two weeks. But Dean just summed it up to him being shy.
Cas immediately got on the ground, as the man holding the gun demanded. Everyone else got down too, protecting their heads. Cas couldn’t hear anything besides the sound of blood rushing in his ears, heartbeat so loud he wouldn’t be surprised if everyone heard it.
Dean kept stroking him from both exterior and interior until Cas' orgasm fully passed before carefully removing his fingers from inside Cas.
"Definitely."
He met Jimmy’s eyes again, and his brother looked torn between being angry and being sad.
sound Cas had ever heard.
"How about you stay for dinner? Mom's making some baked penne. She's a great cook. What do you say?"
He gasped when Dean used a finger to lift his head, smiling way too adorably. "Come back. I miss you." And then Dean kissed his forehead before walking away, and Cas was convinced he actually had died.
"You're very clumsy." A husky voice whispered in his ear from behind him, and suddenly there was a body plastered against his back. The light was flicked on, showing the back of the janitor's closet.
Cas seemed to think for a moment before clearing his throat, as if he hadn't talked in a while.
As if he knew what Cas was thinking, Dean gave him an apologetic kiss, which only made him more embarrassed.
"Cas, wh-what are you doing?" Dean was sounded breathless, and his cheeks were flushed.
"Good. Cum for me. Make a mess, baby. I wanna see," And just as requested, Cas came. Hard. Harder than he ever has before.
Dean grinned, climbing over his boyfriend. Dean stared down at him for a moment before starting to kiss down his neck, pulling the collar of his shirt away to suck marks on his chest.
His textbook was at the bottom, trapped in by the edge on the side of the locker. He leaned down to get it, which, unnoticed by him, caused his butt to stick out slightly into the walkway, but not enough to disrupt the people around him.
Dean chuckled, shaking his head, "Right, forgot. Virgin. Why don't you start with helping me out of my clothes?" Cas nodded eagerly, hurriedly undoing Dean's pants, making Dean laugh again, but this time at his enthusiasm. Cas didn't even notice that Dean's shirt was still on, so the older boy took it off himself.
Poor Dean :(
Dean kissed down Cas' jaw to his neck, sucking a mark directly on his pulse point, and holy shit, Dean's mouth on him still felt as good as the first time they did this.
"Is this what you want?" Dean murmured, lips against his neck as he moved a hand down from his stomach to his clothed erection, rubbing over it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So, Cas,"
There were so many times Dean could have tried something, but he never did. Never seemed to want to.
He was soon completely naked while Dean was fully clothed, and it really shouldn't be as hot as it was, but alas, Cas' dick throbbed painfully when he realised that little fact.
Dean was surprisingly helpful on the project, so they got it done almost three days early.
I know! I know! I said I'll have an update schedule then went MIA. Sorry, but I had absolutely no inspiration! But I'm back, hopefully, and I would love to know your thoughts!
Dean collected the precum, aligning their dicks together to start stroking them together, hand slicking the way.
And when Dean pointed Cas with a beam that could challenge the brightness of the sun? Well, Cas thought he was going to go blind just looking at it.
"Benedict is yummy," Cas said with a grin, cuddling into Dean's side.
that's what you were thinking, I would have done a better job at making my intentions clear. I just want to be friends with you." Cas stared at him, biting his lip.
And then Dean was smiling. ‘Hey, Cas. It’s nice to see you again. I miss you.’
“You know… I always thought we’d make a great pair.” Castiel felt the familiar sting of not being good enough deep in his chest, and tears pricked at his eyes. But, he didn’t say anything. Just stared at his lap, acting as if he wasn’t about to cry.
when Cas nodded, showing he understood that Dean
Blue was his new favorite color.
"Yeah, sweetheart?" Dean pulled back to look at him, lips swollen and spit-slicked. What was Cas going to say, again? His train of thought was quickly derailed with how adorably fuckable Dean looked at that moment. Which, right. That.
'Much better. But, I'm sorry you had to witness that...'
When he saw Dean, he licked his lips, eyes raking over his body. Dean was wearing a green lightweight crew neck sweater that stretched across his chest deliciously over black skinny jeans.
Castiel was smiling after his little speech, eyes crinkling at the corners, the blue a bit brighter than usual, like the sun reflecting off ocean waters. Goddamn, he was beautiful.
One man stayed with a gun pointed at all of them, while the other was collecting money. “Castiel Novak, get up.” He growled. Cas looked up, not sure he heard him right. But, inside, he knew he did.
stories about alphas grooming omegas to condition them to think that the abuse inflicted upon their person was normal, maybe even deserved.
We get a peak into Dean's perspective.
"I just gave you your first handjob, and
"Hey, Jo." He said with a flashy smile, making Cas feel completely invisible, sadly playing with his own fingers.
"I- I wanna please you too," He whispered, not knowing if he'd be allowed, because with everthing they've done, Cas hasn't touched Dean at all.
“No. But I have to try. Cas doesn’t deserve this. And I’ve sat back and watched him get hurt for almost two years. He deserves better than that scumbag,” Fixing his tie, he turned to look at his wife.
Anna smiled as he walked into the kitchen. “You look nice.” She smiled, kissing his forehead before going to the living room, presumably to warn Gabriel to behave. Cas smiled at the thought.
I LIVE for comments. Please, please, please feel free to leave one. I don't bite. That hard.
Because of
"I want you," The statement was followed with another grind against Dean and a soft moan. And, yeah, Dean's pupils were definitely blown.
Wait, shit, now that he was able to, what the fuck did he do?
"D-Dean-" He moaned breathlessly, and Dean responded by kissing him deeper, his tongue taking up every inch of space it could in Cas' mouth, and he didn't remember Dean tasting so good last time.
Cas beamed, standing up to the pull his slightly taller brother into a big hug. “Hi, Jimmy.” He mumbled into his shoulder. He could practically feel Alistair’s jealous glare on the back of his neck.
"C'mon, it could be fun! A bunch of people go to watch them practice. Especially romantic interests." She nudged him suggestively at that, winking and smiling, and if Cas weren't so embarrassed about the arousal burning through him, he would have laughed.
from fear, he'd think that it was cute.
Castiel's sense and logic started to come back soon after he was in his room, the comforting voice of his father and the soft touch of his mother pulling him back from the harsh grip of his memories.
"A bit presumptuous, don't you think?" He asked with a smirk, stroking over Cas' cock.
Hey, guys!! Back again with another update. I've unofficially kinda made Wednesdays my updating days, but I was gone for so long that I figured you guys deserve this surprise chapter! My other project is finished and updated if you guys wanna go give it some love. As always, warnings at the bottom
When he felt safe enough to look at Dean again, the idiot was still smiling, but there was a hint of fondness in it that made Cas melt into a sappy puddle.
"Sure, I'll text Michael to let him know." Gabe let out a squeal of excitement, and Sam must've thought Dean looked away because he leaned over and kissed Gabe's cheek, and holy shit. They were going to discuss
But he couldn't even begin to care when Dean just chuckled and held him even closer.
He pulled Cas away from the door so he could strip the younger teen of his shirt, grinning as Cas' toned chest and stomach was visible.
She seemed sweet, and Cas wondered what they did to her. They must only leave bruises where no one will see, and Castiel almost wanted to cry at the thought of this beautiful omega getting hurt so much.
For one, that nest looked
But as nervous as he looked -and sounded- his candy apple green eyes betrayed him, looking bright and eager as Dean patiently waited for a response.
Cas sighed happily into the kiss, pulling Dean closer by his hair, maneuvring so that the other teen was completely on top of him, and Cas was unashamedly rutting against the thigh Dean strategically placed between his legs.
Cas opened his menu, looking over the options. There was a cheeseburger that looked absolutely heavenly. He noticed that Dean's menu hadn't been touched, cementing the idea that Dean must come here a lot.
Maybe he
alpha.
Cas gasped when Dean thumbed his slit roughly, dick twitching and jumping in Dean's far too skilled hand/
omega. I- if I had
Cas thought on it, trying to figure out what he felt.
not someone who was unwilling.
"You gonna cum?" Dean asked, like the mind reader he was. When Cas could do nothing but nod, gripping Dean's back tightly, his boyfriend grinned.
"But," He continued, making Cas perk up, "We can do other stuff." Cas groaned, nodding fervently.
‘He’s sweet,’ Cas got this far away look on his face and Gabriel anxiously waited for him to continue.
"You ready to go?" That got Cas back to attention, and he nodded eagerly, because
"Hey, now! You're too young for that shit. Now stop complaining and eat." Sammy rolled his eyes, but didn't object as he started in on his eggs, eating them at record speed.
Instead, he protected him from alphas with wondering hands, he held Cas and let him talk about his past, he wiped his tears away when he was sad. And then he laughed with him, played
Alistair's hands -and crotch- were suddenly gone, and Cas quickly turned around, hiding his ass from all the others, and watching the scene that played out before him.
thing, the fact that Dean wanted him as much as Cas wanted Dean... It made a warmth spread through Cas that could rival even the hottest of fires.
Dean almost wondered if he was a mute.
"I don't understand... what's so funny?" He was hoping Dean would be kind enough to enlighten him on the joke, but it seemed like luck was not on his side.
"We're gonna be there, in like, a minute or so. Just so you know." And then it went silent again. And Cas honestly didn't know if that was better or worse.
"Some popcorn and candy. Stuff you could probably find in a movie theater. I'm not very original," Dean sounded slightly sheepish, and Cas just smiled, straightening up to give Dean a soft kiss.
"So, Cas, how do you and Dean know each other?"
He glared at her as she tried to keep her laughing to a minimum, not wanting to draw attention to them.
Dean's friends were nice and welcoming, and Cas couldn't wait to introduce Dean to Charlie, who was sitting with her theater friends today.
Cas sat in the comforting embrace of his mother for a moment longer before getting up, Anna easily letting him go.
"That's right, sweet boy. Let go for me." Cas couldn't take it anymore, and he came,
“Okay,” He agreed, standing up, a stunned Jimmy following suite.
“Hey, Cas.” A man said, eyes bright.
He smelled like leather-bound books, honey, a field of sunflowers, and Sunday mornings spent eating pie. It was positively mouthwatering. And with that was the unmistakable scent of unmated omega.
"He's so cute. What would you like to drink, darling?" And for the first time, he noticed the menu's in her hand. She set one in front of each of them, looking at him expectantly. Oh, right, he's supposed to be answering.
He knew Dean was lying,
didn't try to hide their true intentions.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mmmhm," He hummed non-committedly, basking in the warmth that was spreading through his body, that threatened to overtake him. Dean's touch made him feel grounded, the only thing that was keeping him from floating away completely. He's never felt like this and didn't quite know what the feeling even
"Dean never mentioned you were so cute," He looked up with wide eyes just in time to see her winking, and fuck, could his cheeks get more red?
Spurred on by the reaction, he suckled at Dean's head, eyes closing in contentment because he liked this, it was calming in a way.
Once Dean deemed him relaxed enough, he slowly slid his finger inside of Cas, making sure to only go a little bit at a time, not wanting to overwhelm the vulnerable boy.
He really was a good brother. Just as Anna was a good mother, Chuck a good father. All three better than his biological family. He shuddered, pushing thoughts of them away.
Harry Potter! Whoever recommended it seems
boy. Cas liked the sound of that. Still couldn't believe Dean was his as much as he was Dean's. Cas liked being Dean's. Dean made him feel good all the time, and he wasn't talking about the awesome sex, either.
When he didn't, Dean let his hand creep inside, startled to find his hand touch Cas' bare dick, no fabric separating them. Cas cried out, and Dean just looked at him with wide eyes.
"It's a staff room, but don't worry. We won't get in trouble." Dean led him over to one of the couches, sitting down with the omega.
He wanted the handjob to be just theirs.
As Dean continued to kiss him, he let his body slowly
They arrived at some place called The Roadhouse, which didn't look like much, but he trusted Dean.
Dean parked in the driveway of a nice house. Bigger than Cas' but not by all that much. And that settled him, if only a little, for some strange reason. But at this point, he'd take any comfort that he could get.
He took the controller Dean handed to him, watching the alpha set the game up.
And being the weird nerd who randomly shows up to a football game was not something he wanted to be known as.
about what Cas had thought for
"You mean, your first time doing... anything?" He asked, unbelieving. When Cas nodded, he just scoffed. "You guys have been inseparable since birth," Cas rolled his eyes at the exaggeration, "I thought you guys had been doing it since you decided to make it official. Sorry to burst your bubble, but mom and dad think so too."
When he looked back up, his eyes landed on Dean, and Dean actually started laughing when his face immediately turned a bright red.
"Are you feeling better?" Dean asked, and Cas nodded, quickly writing on the whiteboard.
"You okay?" He asked softly, even though Cas clearly wasn't. He was shaking and teary-eyed, scent
Anyways, Cas was almost caught under the bleachers, and it was scary as fuck.
"They were excited," Cas noted, and Dean scoffed.
Dean's breath hitched, and when Cas looked up at his face, he could see Dean was staring at him in awe and barely contained arousal.
Well, not for Cas. Dean was
"D-Dean~" He moaned, feeling like he was being sucker-punched, but in a pleasurable way. Dean held him up, using his precum to help slick the way.
"Are you kidding? Look at where we're sitting, and then look at where he's sitting. He's
"The best I ever have," And then he was pulling Cas onto his chest, and Cas was content to just lay there with him.
And then what Dean said sunk in, and his heart started pounding for an entirely different reason. "Y-you knew I was there?" He squeaked, face breaking out in a bright blush. What the fuck was happening?
gay, there was no way in hell he would return Dean’s feelings. Life just didn’t work that way.
Cas really did scream this time as he came untouched, another first that Dean coaxed out of him.
Cas' eyes went wide, and he frantically looked at the door. He completely forgot all about class.
"What? I just want to know!" She defended, turning back to him with an exasperated roll of her eyes.
who had roared and Dean looked
"C'mon," Dean pushed Cas towards the bed, before arranging him so his head was laying on the pillows, Dean climbing between his legs.
Castiel's breath was stolen when he caught sight of the older boy, clean and gorgeous. How could anyone be so perfectly made to look like he did under the fading sun? Shining green eyes otherworldly, freckles like stars across the galaxies.
He was so fucking
Potential trigger warnings at the bottom. Please feel free to point out any mistakes :)
and holy shit it felt so good, and then Dean started
"Don't worry, we're on our way out soon," Mary said, smile playing at her lips. "Dean, I expect to come home with no weird stains on the couch." And as Dean burst out laughing, Cas squeaked, hiding his face.
He jumped when Dean tapped his shoulder from behind.
"I will. But not today." Cas tilted his head in confusion, making a questioning sound in the back of his throat. Dean took a minute to think before he answered the silent question.
A pause, "Yeah, Cas?"
"Hey, Dee?" Dean hummed in acknowledgment, waiting until he was done backing up before locking eyes with Sam in the rearview mirror.
not to be left alone, so he nodded, unable to meet the alpha's eyes.
Also, so sorry for disappearing. Long story short, my laptop basically broke. I mean, not technically, but you really don't wanna get into that mess
Cas shakily got back on his feet. “Leave.” Cas whimpered, and looking at everyone else. “C-can I bring them?” He asked, voice wavering. “No, go. Now.” He nodded, running out of the building, eyes wide with fear even after he left.
And he
And holy shit, now that he was about to say it, he felt nervous. He felt
"J-Jess, I think you're ver-very sweet, but I, uh, I can't. Sorry." And then he ducked his head to avoid 'Jess's' disappointed look.
Dean was going to kill him if he kept it up with that fond voice and the kind words.
"Pleeeaaase, Cassie?" Gabe whined, and Dean saw Cas' little smile out of the corner of his eye.
But if Dean were trying to manipulate Cas, get Cas to willingly let Dean use him, he would have already acted on it, right?
He was a little more awake after eating, and by the time fifth-hour Anthropology came, he was ready to actually engage in what was being taught.
Gabe easily ducked, though, practically fleeing when Cas reached for a chunky pillow, but Cas could hear his gleeful laughter throughout the entire house.
Dean was really confused when suddenly the car was filled with the scent of yearning omega.
His hands trailed up Dean's neck, gripping the base hairs as he leaned in to kiss him.
"How about I walk you to the office so you can get someone to come pick you up?" Dean asked kindly, teeth back to normal.
, kind of like.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you wanna talk about it?" Dean asked softly, rubbing Cas' shoulder. And Castiel felt an odd sense of comfort from the gesture.
"There's no need to apologize, Cas. It's okay," Dean sounded so confident that Castiel wanted to believe him. But a lifetime of trust-issues told him otherwise.
He was starting to
As soon as Cas got home, he immediately got on his phone to research grooming tactics.
contagious, so was his
He didn't want the omega to be uncomfortable around him, to just wait around, wondering when he was gonna be used.
Dean's finger was suddenly wet and rubbing against his hole, and he clenched in excited anticipation, legs falling open easily and a groan working its way through his chest.
He probably just angered the alpha and was about to get the beating of a lifetime, all because he couldn't fucking control his mouth.
you're acting all shy. You're too precious, I can't handle it." Yeah, Cas was definitely red now, and Dean just laughed at him, stepping out of the way.
This one is also a little heavy, guys. Warnings at the bottom.
"Sorry, that was probably a stupid idea. What about-"
“Hi, baby. Welcome home.” He called with a grin, standing up to go greet him. “I told you not to call me that. Sounds so stupid.”
Then, the body, and lips, were gone, and Cas immediately missed the heat.
Dean slowly moved his kisses down to his stomach, and Cas was audibly gasping now, hips seeking friction that Dean rudely didn't provide.
It wasn’t a life-changing realisation like portrayed in books and movies. In fact, Castiel was sure he, on some level, already knew.
Biting his lip, Cas shyly touched the head, smearing precum around.
Castiel Novak was screwed, and not in the way he wanted to be.
"You- you think I'm trying to- to
"Let's try something different, yeah?" And before Cas could even ask, he was being flipped onto his back, sweats tugged down, and dick out.
"Not for what you're probably thinking. I just wanna hang out. Plus, I finally got Unravel Two, and I need someone to play with." Dean gave his most innocent smile, and his scent exploded in triumph when Cas nodded his consent, relaxing into his seat.
"I'll never get over how fuckin'
Cas got out, and Dean almost cried because Cas was so gentle when he closed Baby’s door.
at him again, I will do so much worst. I swear to
and yeah, Cas was cumming, and he couldn't even feel ashamed about how fast it happened.
Castiel was sitting on the couch, watching tv. The house was so clean it was almost sparkling, dinner in the oven.
"Of course," Dean said in a
Everything was a blur, all he remembered were screams and gunshots, tears spilling. When did he start crying? His breathing was shallow, every gulp of air burning his lungs like he was inhaling fire.
And no matter how hard he tried to fight it, Cas found a small smile spreading on his lips. Dean's happiness was contagious.
Dean got the door unlocked, opening it for Cas to go in first. And as soon as he did, his knees buckled, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
, just that he felt good. He felt safe and loved and cared for, and that's all that mattered to him.
Dean's grin widened, which didn't seem possible. Cas was sure that had to hurt his cheeks.
Dean responded to his moan by getting even closer, which didn't even seem possible, but-
There were some bookshelves lining the walls, a few couches, bean bags, and small tables spread throughout the room.
Confused as to who would sit by him, he looked up, breath hitching when he saw that it was Dean Winchester occupating the previously empty chair.
"What, I can't just be happy?" Cas asked, food untouched beside him as he stared at Dean, who was across the room and laughing at something one of his friends said. Gods, he was so gorgeous it physically hurt. He finally understood what Taylor Swift meant.
Dean fucking beamed when he scored the winning touchdown, even though he was gross and sweaty in his uniform. Endorphins pumped through him, wiping away any and all pain and exhaustion. He felt great, riding out his body’s natural high as dopamine rushed through his veins, neurotransmitters firing like crazy.
-Child abuse
Dean looked at him for a long moment, quickly scanning his eyes before positively beaming in a way that made butterflies take flight so suddenly, he almost felt sick with the strength of his adoration of Dean.
They were currently sitting at their regular table in the library, Dean laughing loudly, even though it was supposed to be a quiet zone. Cas was sitting there, looking proud since he was the one who caused the whole body laughter.
Dean cooed at him and continued to rub at that spot, and then he did something completely unexpected. He reached down with his other hand, rubbing at Cas' perineum, stimulating his prostate from the outside.
And that was even more terrifying than the haunted look.
Something dark and scary passed over Cas' eyes, and Dean didn't know how to decipher that.
Gabriel was silent and when Cas chanced a look up at him, his brother was watching him in silent contemplation.
He hugged Amelia next, kissing her cheek. “Where’s Claire?” He asked, frowning as he looked around like she might appear out of nowhere.
Cas nodded, taking the leather jacket from Dean and putting it on. It was already big on Dean, so it definitely covered everything.
Cas should have just shut his mouth, he knew. But after talking about his past experience, his mouth was just throwing everything out there, making Dean pull away.
Hands locked together the entire time, Dean led Cas into the house, up the stairs, and into his bedroom. And, fuck, this was Dean's
But that didn’t stop the sadness from spreading, wiping his smile away.
"Relax for me, sweetheart. Don't wanna hurt you," The command was easy to follow, sent a rush of
He looked over at the boy, but he was eating, acting all innocent. He was honestly such a dick and Cas hated him and he wanted to-
to have a flashback in front of his only friend and crush.
Warnings:
"You're doing so good for me, baby. Making me feel so good," Dean mumbled as Cas started stroking him. Cas felt warm with the praise, body alight and burning with his need.
"You're so responsive, Cas. I love that you're always so eager for me to touch you," Cas barely understood what Dean was saying, just that Dean was there, that Dean loved him, that Dean had him and would protect him, would keep him safe until Cas felt stable again, maybe even then. Maybe Dean would protect him no matter how stable and capable Cas was. He hoped so.
Cas' scent would sometimes turn fearful, or his eyes would be filled with this haunted kind of look, or he'd get really nervous out of the blue.
Halfway through the movie, Cas decided it was now or never. Without a movie to divert some of Dean's attention, Cas would most definitely lose his nerve.
He seriously needed to get a grip on reality and then- holy shit, when did they cross the field into the parking lot?
Halfway through lunch, Amelia had to leave after she got a call from work. And then Alistair basically ignored him to talk to Jimmy.
Cas groaned, louder this time, and rolled his eyes. "Get out so I can change, you creep." As he pushed his older brother out of his room, he had to admit he felt better about this whole situation.
"He's not my boyfriend!" Sam objected after finishing his plate, face red.
"Not yet. I have more self-control than that," Dean teased, and if Cas wasn't still riding his high, he would have scowled at that. "Later. We have to get you to class. Don't want to miss the entire thing, do you?"
"I'm just kidding."
"Not this happy. C'mon, spill. What happened?" Cas bit his lip against the slow-spreading smile, his cheeks tinted red as he thought about what happened almost two hours ago.
'Monday. The doctor said I'm okay now, but mom and dad wanted to give it a few days.'
"Well, I love my unoriginal boyfriend," He teased, planting another kiss on Dean's cheek before walking to the living room. He could definitely feel Dean checking out his ass, which just boosted his confidence.
for the first time.
And he was naked
Such a stupid omega who hadn't learned his place yet and had to have some alpha swoop in to save him because he was dumb enough to inadvertently tease an alpha
'What do you need?' He asked as soon as he pulled back, and Castiel, once again, felt so lucky that this was his big brother.
Not that he particularly
"Okay, Cas. Come on," Castiel practically clung to Dean's arm as they walked towards their classroom.
"I-I'm sorry, I wasn't sure-" He promptly shut up because he was an idiot who should at least
"All right, where's your brother?" Dean asked, voice raised slightly so he would be heard over the smooth purr of the beast beneath them.
Castiel’s glasses fell to the ground as he was shoved into a locker. He whimpered at the sharp pain that shot through his back, lighting up his muscles and spreading until it felt like his skin was on fire. “Aw, look at that, gay boy
His father's face flashed in his mind, but he forcefully pushed it away. He wasn't going to give in to the past again. Wasn't going to let that smug bastard win.
When Dean's mom didn't wince while sitting down, Cas felt marginally better. At least they weren't too rough. Or, at least they weren't recently.
"You told me to come here...?" Cas was confused, but he got the sense that he had said something weird when Dean looked at him in amusement.
"F-fuck, oh fuck,
When he heard a key turning in the lock of the front door, he grinned, sitting up. Alistair walked in, looking around with a sneer on his face.
‘And it only took me two months to fall in love,’ It felt weird at first, admitting out loud that he was in love with Dean. It meant his feelings were real. But he knew he had never spoken -or, signed if you care about technicalities- a truer sentence.
"Yeah. I want it. Want you. Please, Dean. Fuck me. Please." Cas was red in the face, grinding down against him like a man possessed.
He felt a moment of panic when he saw Gabriel down there with Dean, but it calmed immediately, because while it was Gabriel's job as his big brother to embarrass him, he would never do that when Cas was in such a vulnerable state.
He was surprised when they were already pulling into Dean's driveway, which led to a nice, suburban-looking house. It wasn't small, but it wasn't overly big either.
"Instead of staring a hole into his head, why don't you just talk to him?" If Cas had been drinking something, he would've spit it out. But as it was, he only stared with wide eyes and an open mouth.
"W-where are we?" Cas asked timidly, and Dean smiled kindly at him.
"But it'd be weird if
Castiel was surprised that he was opening up at all to Dean, but he was just so tired.
Dean's
Cas was just a bundle of nerves the entire time. He tried to enter a different headspace, pretend like what was about to happen, well,
Castiel frowned, eyebrows pulling in for a confused furrow. "What is the importance of knowing my movie preferences?" He asked uncomfortably, shifting a little in his seat.
They finished their project last week. At school. Which meant that Dean hasn't had a valid reason to invite the boy back to his place.
He wanted to ask if everything was okay, but they weren't exactly friends, so Cas would most likely not tell him anyways.
He was too busy in his little trance to notice Dean looking at him with adoration written all over his face.
It was so loud he was surprised the lockers weren't shaking with it, and that his ears weren't sore.
Just a little warning, there will be mentions of that past rape, and suspicion of future rape. Please be careful, you know yourself and your triggers best.
Dean let out the sexiest moan as he came, head thrown back and eyes squeezed shut.
"Anthropology, huh? Tell me, is Dean a good student?" Cas looked up, to see Dean blushing and trying to curl into himself as she elbowed him playfully in the ribs.
"W-well-" Cas cut himself off with a moan, "I wanted you to say yes," He grinned, though it soon turned into a face of pleasure.
“Hello, Dean.”
You turn me on so much, sweetheart." Oh shit, right. Reciprocation.
He wanted to say no, he really did. But then he looked up to see Alistair flirting with a waitress and he just couldn’t take it anymore.
“In the oven.” He muttered. God, why didn’t he make dinner sooner? He knew when Alistair would be home. He was stupid.
Just like the rest of him, it was absolutely perfect. The shaft was thick and flushed a pretty red, a vein on the bottom that bulged out and Cas just wanted to lick at it. His head was on full display, foreskin rolled down in arousal. It was an angry purple that glistened due to copious amounts of precum.
"Cas, I'm
In what seemed like a heartbeat, they were in Dean’s impala, driving down the smooth roads. Cas found the rumble of the engine soothing. It even started to quell down his inner turmoils.
Dean let out a surprised laugh, biting his lip again to try and reign in his ever-growing smile.
"Hey, hey," Dean soothed, and Cas didn't even flinch when he used his big thumbs to wipe away the tears. "It's okay.
The fact that Cas had just planned to take it? Broke Dean's fucking heart. And suddenly
So, with furrowed brows, and a heavy heart, he left the room, resigning himself to the fact that he'd be taken advantage of by yet another alpha.
"Because we've never done anything beyond light petting. You can't just go from zero to a hundred." He explained gently, hands rubbing Cas' sides.
‘Only if you promise to keep your mouth shut. I don’t need your help in ruining my life. I do it just fine on my own, thank you.’ He squinted and Gabe laughed, putting his hands up in surrender.
Dean had a big, bright smile on his face as he walked into Anthropology class, eyes immediately zeroing in on Cas.
Dean was leisurely rolling Cas' foreskin, milking precum out with each slow movement of his hand.
I don't want to hurt you. Or
And he wouldn't have it any other way.
"Middle school. He should be waiting up front." Dean laughed again, and Cas tilted his head in a confused manner.
through him to have Dean telling him exactly what he was supposed to be doing.
Once he was out of earshot, Jimmy turned to him.
"Sure he isn't," Dean said with an unbelieving eye roll. "Just finish what's left in the pan so we can go, bitch." Sam grumbled at him, but was too busy stuffing his face to respond.
"Awesome."
Another boisterous laugh and then they were peeling out of the lot.
. They just wanted to get closer to his brother.
Last year some guy in homeroom had been convinced that Cas had been staring at him and spread a rumor that Cas was gay. While that statement was the truth, he wasn’t ready to come out. To this day, he still hasn’t confirmed the rumor. The thing that pissed him off the most though, was the fact that Cas hadn’t been staring at the douche. He was just spaced out.
When Dean wrapped him up in his strong arms, Castiel just melted against him, head on Dean's chest. He didn't even have enough brainpower left to realise he should probably wrap his arms around Dean, as that's how hugs worked.
Castiel was debating whether or not he should go to the practice or not. He wanted to, mostly because Dean wanted him to. But at the same time, what if he was caught? And made the laughing stock of the school?
Dean almost seemed... kind. Which was a stupid thought in and of itself.
Fuck, even after a month of being Dean's, he would never get used to how well he played his body, somehow always knowing what Cas needed.
Maybe if he played his cards right, Dean wouldn't be too harsh on him.
with him on his bedroom floor, held his hand when he was nervous, tried to do everything possible to make him feel comfortable. And not once did he try to make Cas feel like his omega status made him willing to advances. He told him the exact opposite, in fact. Told him he deserved to be loved, deserved to be happy, didn't deserve being taken advantage of.
His first thought was Dean. The alpha must've finally gotten fed up with the art of grooming.
Cas didn't notice because, true to his word, he was texting someone, and Dean couldn't wait to tell him that their brothers were experiencing cute puppy love.
When the food was done and plated, Sam was dressed, and his ridiculously long hair was brushed. All in all, he looked like a little princess. Dean stated as much, which earned him a bitchface and the middle finger.
So, putting on a pair of jeans Dean said cupped his ass perfectly, and one of the shirts he stole -no underwear. If he was seducing his boyfriend, he was going to do it right-, Cas grabbed his keys and left after a quick goodbye to Gabriel.
Seemed like that's all he was capable of doing around Dean.
Gabriel just quirked an eyebrow, but said nothing about the purple bruise blossoming on his neck, although he eyed it with a smug grin.
Wait, was it even possible to fall in love with someone you've only been talking to for a few days? Cas didn't know, and he really didn't care either, because he knew what he felt, screw what anyone else said.
As the room was bathed in darkness, Dean walked to the bed, secret smile on his face. "C'mon, let's go to sleep, yeah?"
Dean must have read his expression because he was laughing, getting into the driver's side.
He looked up when Dean didn't say anything at first, only to notice that he was studying Cas' face.
Cas laughed, pulling Dean into a sweet, loving kiss. He loved this dork so much.
It made sense with all the subpar alphas in his life, so Dean tried not to take it personally, but he was so fucking
Castiel got the sudden, ridiculous, urge to
“Yes, of course we are. Why wouldn’t we be?” Alistair shrugged, taking a bite of his food before grinning.
Cas nodded, sitting up slowly as he looked around. He was in the bedroom, Gabriel and Dean nowhere to be seen.
"Dude, it is the most important question
"I've never done that before," He admitted, smiling a little shyly when Dean looked at him with so much wonder and raw joy.
Cas wanted to cry when Dean pulled away, wanted to stay in his arms forever. But Dean was probably creeped out as it is, so with an awkward cough, he pulled back as well, offering a shaky smile.
Dean was outright panting now, and Cas slowly moved down, taking more into his mouth. He could only go about halfway before gagging, so he used his hand on the rest, bobbing his head.
Okay, that was sappy, but Cas could barely register the embarrassment that he should be feeling.
“Cas… Why won’t you leave him? Look at you. You’re miserable.” His voice was pleading, and Cas had to look away again.
“With her babysitter,” Jimmy answered, smiling as he pulled out a chair for Amelia to sit down in. Cas felt a swirl of jealousy in the pit of his stomach, glancing away. Alistair never did anything sweet like that for him.
against Cas', clothed cocks brushing together.
And what Dean had written off as shyness, maybe paired with social awkwardness, was actually Cas thinking Dean was going to- to- Dean couldn't even
. And even if he wasn't,
The reminder hurt.
Their team won, and Cas watched as Dean sought him out only to wave at him before heading into the locker room, presumably to take a shower and change.
"Dude, chill down with the murder look. All I'm saying is that you and Dean have been making lovey eyes since before kindergarten. He obviously doesn't care about what pants make your ass stand out more. So, what's this really about?" He asked, arms crossing over the broad expanse of his chest.
"This is my baby. Well, my
‘Why don’t you ask him out then?’ Cas seemed to think about it for a minute before answering, signing a bit slow.
Castiel barely registered the sound of Dean's door closing until he was pushed against it, Dean on him immediately. Fuck, his dick was already chubbing up.
He repeated it like a mantra in his head until the bad thoughts went away completely and he was back in the present, wrapped in the arms of his mother.
"Nothing, nothing," Dean still had soft traces of amusement in his voice, "You're unbelievably cute, you know that?"
"I know it's stupid. It's so fucking
Getting into bed with Dean, an
When he looked back up, Jimmy had watery eyes.
Otherwise, enjoy!
And soon enough, they were in Dean's car, driving to his place. Dean had insisted on Cas staying the night and Cas was hopeless to do anything but agree when it came to Dean.
"I just- I can't believe it's real, you know? We even agreed to go out for food after his game. Dean wants to hang out with
Dean was dying of laughter on the inside. Sam was being asked out for the first time! It was even funnier because it looked like he didn't want to be having this conversation in the slightest.
-Omega slurs
Great, now he was blushing.
Castiel wanted to roll his eyes, but that actually wasn’t a bad idea. Maybe he would.
Cas reached up, fingers lightly stroking over the heated flesh of his cock.
When he said hi, Castiel thought he was going to combust right there in the library.
"No, no, it's fine. I don't mind it. Just wanted to make sure you're all right." Now Castiel was
Our boy Dean is just so pure
After getting over his initial shock, Cas texted his mom about spending the weekend with the Winchesters. Anna ultimately said yes, obviously happy Castiel had a friend he could spend time with. As sad as it was, that was rare.
"So, um, come here often?" He asked, even though the answer was obvious. Dean let out a bark of laughter for reasons Cas didn't understand. He furrowed his eyebrows, mouth turning into a slight frown, his trademarked confused face.
Dean swallowed everything he had to give, pulling off before it became oversensitive, and Cas was totally out of it, pleasure thrumming through his body.
Two weeks later was the game, and as much as Cas wanted to go, they were always overcrowded and there was no way he could hide from everyone.
"Everything all right?" Dean asked, feigning concern as he passed the threshold as well.
Cas awoke the next morning to Dean
It'd probably make him really happy...
Cas sat awkwardly at the table, watching as the nice-smelling omega plated the food for them.
And as much as Castiel hated himself for it, his inner omega was
adolescent male alphas.
And that was how, two hours later, he found himself hiding from the rest of the audience underneath the bleachers, Charlie grinning smugly beside him.
After dropping off a very excited Gabriel, Dean drove to -presumably- his house.
"I mean... yeah..." Cas looked down, rubbing the back of his neck, trying to stave off yet another blush. Seriously, this was bullshit. "No one's really piqued my interest, unless you count Ryan Reynolds."
He eventually felt okay enough to open his eyes, and Dean was sitting there, still hard, and more smug than he had the right to be.
"Well, well, well, looks like I just walked into a porno," He said cheerfully, and Cas let out an inhuman screech, bucking so hard he threw Dean right off the bed. His poor boyfriend fell on the floor with a loud thump, followed by a pained groan.
They've spent nights -even weekends- together, but never alone. Not the whole time, at least. And this time was different because Cas wanted to take it further, an urge he hasn't really had before.
"Fuck, Cas. Me too. More than you'll ever know," And then Cas was swept up into a kiss, more passionate and tender than his heart could handle. The sweetest kiss they'd ever shared and Cas wasn't ashamed at all to admit his eyes burned up a bit.
"Such a nice ass there, pretty omega bitch," He leaned close, grinding his crotch against him, and tears prickled at Castiel's eyes when he felt the hard cock poking his ass, even through all the layers of clothing.
" Mary laughed loudly, shaking her head.
"Of course. I trust you more than anyone, I know you'd never hurt me." And he was not prepared for the kiss that Dean gave, so full of emotions, he thought his chest would burst with them.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Dean was kissing him like he meant business, and Cas' knees were buckling under the passion of it.
Dean and Cas spend an evening together.
After the game was officially over and he had showered and changed as quickly as possible, Dean went to find Castiel, hoping he didn’t already leave.
After that first time, it was like a dam had broken, and Cas started to go to every practice, always in the same spot, at the same time, and without Charlie.
Dean was a virgin, and didn't care if other people thought he wasn't a real alpha because of that. Dean wanted his first time to be with someone he loved. Not with someone who was just willing. And
Cas let out an annoyed sigh, rolling his eyes. "Right now my favorite is the
When they went inside, Cas looked around, studying his surroundings. It wasn't very big, a bar ahead, a few tables pushed against the windows on his left, a pool table in the corner on his right, and a big tv taking up most of the wall next to it.
The ten seconds it took for Dean to get into the driver's seat was the longest ten seconds of his life. But then they were taking off, rock music played softly from the radio.
This sweet, gorgeous omega who's been through so much shit, but is still here and able to smile. He was so quickly falling in love with the boy, and though he knew Cas might not ever feel the same, he was still so happy when around him. He just wanted to be with the omega 24/7, which gave him a
"You're doing it again."
Cas was so close all he could smell was Dean, and holy shit did he smell good. Mouth-watering good.
"What weren't you sure of?" Dean was so close, his eyes so wide, his face so open and honest, Cas couldn't help but spit it out.
Charlie. We're
Even though Gabe wasn’t his biological brother, he still treated Cas as if he was. The thing he loved the most, though, was the fact that they didn’t care that he was mute. That they never tried to change him. They loved him the way he was, even learning and teaching him sign language so they could communicate better.
"Shit! Dean, are you okay?" Fucking hell, he was seriously about to panic because his bedroom had wooden floors, and it had sounded like Dean hit his head.
Some feelings, some attempted reassurances.
It was hard to focus, though, as he dealt with a Dean sized hole in his heart.
Apparently, his mind hated him, though, because all he could think about was how much it would hurt.
He could definitely feel the weight of the day melting away with each steady stroke of Dean's fingers.
uncomfortable.
"Friends," Cas said softly, "I'd like that."
He opted for a simple dish, cheesy, scrambled eggs, with disgusting kale sprinkled over Sam's because he's an abomination of God. Not that Dean was religious or anything.
Cas was confused.
But with this newfound happiness came pain. Castiel was absolutely adorable, especially in the morning with his tired eyes and cute yawns. Dean found it increasingly hard to keep his hands to himself. Even Cas
As he walked to the bathroom thrumming with anticipation, he thought about what Dean would do to him, and then thought about the sweet kisses he would get afterwards, and yeah. Cas was definitely in love.
Dean found him at the front of the middle school, talking to some blonde girl, and looking
So Castiel was left sitting in the bleachers, full of nervous energy. He still wasn't completely convinced that he hadn't just dreamed it all, couldn't believe Dean actually liked him.
‘You were talking to Dean again, weren’t you?’ He signed, face suggestive when he fingerspelled Dean’s name. Cas rolled his eyes, thankful that sign language was easy to ignore as he started to walk away with a little huff. But no matter how hard he tried to pretend that he was annoyed, he couldn’t help the little smile at Gabriel’s laughter and the sound of Anna’s voice telling Gabe to leave his little brother alone from inside the kitchen.
The bell rang, signaling that lunch was over. They finally let him down, only so they didn’t get caught, leaving him there in both his physical and emotional pain.
you?" Dean asked, and he actually sounded hurt.
"Make sure to get your homework done, Sam. Don't just mess around." Okay, it wasn't necessary to tell
Dean let out a very attractive laugh, eyes bright in his mirth.
(See the end of the chapter for
But the omega must be putting up a front for their guest, as to not alert anyone else to the horrors of her day-to-day life.
"Yeah? Lay down. On your back." Cas did as instructed, eyes half-lidded.
Even if telling Dean didn't mean anything and may be turned against him, he needed someone else to know.
, of all people, the alpha who's trying to
"I want to, like, a lot. But it's your first time. And, um. It's also kinda my first time too? Like, you know that I've done stuff before you," Dean blushed at that, scratching the back of his head. Cas had quickly learned that he didn't really like talking about his past experiences with intimacy, stating that his time with Cas was the only thing that should matter. "But I've never done something that... special with another person. And that's exactly what I want for our first time. For it to be special. But, maybe next weekend. Lemme get some stuff together, and then I'll woo the pants right off of you.
He had stayed silent long enough as it is.
Dean deepened the kiss with a hitched moan, and Cas was lost in the sensuality of it all. Usually, they got heated fast and started stripping, and Cas loved that -
They did end up leaving half an hour later, and Dean suggested that they should watch a movie.
Chuck gave a soft nod, smiling at his son. "Downstairs, in the living room. He's waiting for you,"
Starting simple, he kissed down Dean's neck, nipping at his pulse point.
It was at that moment a woman with blonde hair opened the door, a fond smile on her face.
And, shit, now everything kind of
"There's not much to talk about... it's happened before, and it'll happen again. I'm an omega. It's how the world works."
‘He’s a popular jock and I’m just a low-life nerd. Plus, I don’t even know if he likes guys. And with all of the rumours going around, I really don’t see why he’d want to date me.’
“Jimmy, everyone who has ever dated me did it because they wanted to get closer to you. But as soon as they figured out you were taken, they left. He didn’t. Sure, I know he doesn’t want me. He never has. But no one else has either. At least- at least I’m not alone. Obviously I’m not very appealing to anyone. So, if I left him, I’d have no one. Because nobody wants me. And I’d rather be with someone who doesn’t want me than be with no one at all.” A stray tear fell and he wiped at it angrily. No use being sad about the truth.
Confused, nervous, a little sleepy. But uncomfortable? Scared? He didn't think so.
He learned that Dean’s family did indeed come, they just didn’t stay to wait for him to change. He preferred to take his baby -Cas smiled when he heard Dean’s fond nickname of the car- anyway, and Sam -Cas loved the proud tone in Dean’s voice whenever he talked about his brother- always said that Dean was ‘as slow as a girl’. Cas wasn’t sure he knew what that meant.
Dean immediately straightened up to full height, arm wrapping around Cas' waist as they walked up to the house.
Dean spared a glance at Cas, trying to decipher that look on his face, but before he could come up with any sort of answer, they pulled up to the middle school, and Cas' scent completely changed.
Dean was
It was Thursday when he finally decided
Cas felt the mattress dip before there was some shuffling, and then all the noise stopped and Cas could feel that Dean was near, but wasn't holding him for some dumb reason.
Speaking of,
"We have Anthropology class together, ma'am." He said shyly, looking down towards his plate, hiding from all the people -mostly alphas- staring at him.
Tired of alphas taking pleasure that he wasn't willing to give. Tired of alphas walking all over him. Tired of being all alone. Just
He ignored Charlie's snort and badly covered 'nerd' thrown his way, but he was unable to stop the smile from splitting his face almost painfully.
"You with me, sweetheart?" Dean asked, and Cas was floating, his only want was to please Dean, to make Dean feel good, to take everything Dean wanted to give him, everything Dean thought he deserved.
"Let me think about it." Honestly, he was leaning towards a hard yes, but he needed enough time to make a pros and cons list before coming to a final decision.
Cas was clapping with a smile and Dean felt a warmth surge through him at the proud look on Cas’ face. Even from the distance, Dean could see his expression perfectly.
Well, even more so than usual.
"Good morning, sweet boy," Dean whispered, and Cas blushed at the nickname.
He was so hard, ready to burst, that familiar heat in his belly, signaling his impending orgasm.
This just led to more laughing, and Cas knew he had missed something of import.
"I think I'll have an iced tea, raspberry, please." Jo nodded, writing the order onto her pad before turning her attention to Dean.
Dean was laughing, pressing a sweet kiss to his lips, before grabbing the books from behind him and giving them to the boy. "Will I see you at the game today? We could go out for food afterwards, if you want to."
Castiel could feel a pounding in his head from the screams of his peers. But Dean was more than worth it, so Cas ignored it as best he could, deciding to just focus on his new friend. Usually, when Cas attended the football games, he’d fantasize about Dean sweaty and pumped full of adrenaline from winning, grabbing Cas like his property -that kink was a whole can of worms he wasn’t ready to open yet- and kissing him, completely dominating his mouth.
"Dean," His breath hitched on that one word, and there was a dark chuckle that he could feel against his skin.
Me! He could have anyone he wanted and yet-" He cut himself off because he was definitely gonna get too emotional with this.
