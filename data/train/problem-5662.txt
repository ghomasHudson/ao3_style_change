Winona blinked, her lips settling into a flat line. “Sit first.”
Cueball came in over the comm. “Two enemy vehicles heading for the compound. Hurry up in there, boys.”
He tipped his head up, catching Steve’s lips in a kiss. This time he tasted sweet. The ache was gone, replaced by tenderness as Steve’s arms wound around him, hugging him tight. Tony moved against him, settling into Steve’s chest as he deepened the kiss.
Tony didn’t just let people get away with not being enthusiastic about spending time with him.
Tony leaned his head back, his smile ticking up a little more. “And then I just let him in and I’m so happy. Like, I’m happy again. I thought I was happy waiting for you but now I really feel happy. I feel like I’m young again, y’know? I feel like—I don’t know. I feel great.”
“When you both drank the wine, it had been laced with the potion. I suppose it manifested itself in a way similar to drunkenness at first, but the purpose is to shape your reality into your true ideal.” Thor grinned at them, his unkempt blond hair making him look like a stray Golden Retriever. “What do you remember after you left the party?”
“Natasha doesn’t know anything about people unless she’s trying to manipulate them. I know people.” Tony turned up his nose a little before sipping some more coffee.
“Is he?” Tony stood up again, a little more prepared to go on the defense now. He warily met Steve’s eye.
Steve didn’t want to put Peter down in his crib again, but he knew that was the best choice. The storm was going to end soon and if he hoped to be at all productive tomorrow, he needed at least four hours of rest.
“One more time, we can use extra lube,” Tony offered, hands moving up Steve’s thighs now. His right hand found Steve’s flaccid dick and started stroking.
Steve watched the black thread pull through his flesh and smiled. He looked like Frankenstein, both arms were a lattice of black stitching over pale skin.
“I don’t know how—I don’t know how—but then it happens to you. Daddy’s daddy did it to him. My dad did it to me. I don’t think he even knew what he was doing. That’s ‘cause it’s evil, Peter. It’s evilness and it’s going to happen here if I don’t stop this right now.”
Steve turned his face into Tony’s chest, shaking so hard he could hear his breaths shivering. No more were the days when his little Pete would giggle at him and ask to play baseball at the park. Maybe even in those days, Peter had been itching for somewhere else. Someone else.
“Not Tony’s!” Rhodey sighed. “Not Tony’s. Steve’s. Our Steve. We took blood from him constantly, secured it in a top-secret location in case he ever needed a transfusion. Normal human blood worked fine on him, but cut his healing factor. Having his own blood on hand sped up the process.”
“What?”
Steve let out a snort, and settled into the couch a little more. “Well you’re gonna have to wait a few minutes, ‘cause I just got comfortable.”
He tore the broken piece of fence from where they had set it and threw Blaine through the hole. Blaine let out plenty of curses on the way through, but he got though.
“No.” Steve shook his head. “Nothing specific. They’re never that specific anymore. Can’t really even remember it.”
Tony’s tongue ran the length of him, swirling at the head. Steve adjusted his stance, staccato motions of his hips minute but more than enough on Tony’s throat, he knew. Tony sucked earnestly then, and soon Steve was slumped against the shower door, holding Tony’s nose flush to his skin as he swallowed down everything Steve gave him.
Rhodey chuckled. “I just mean I don’t want to see you hurt when you could have prevented it in the first place.”
It would take time.
Bucky wasn’t allowed to go international yet.
The door to his room opened and Emory stepped in, his black hair fraying out from under his hat, sticking to his pink cheeks. He lifted the gun off his back and hung it at the end of their bunk before pulling off his hat and shaking out his long hair.
“This’ll only work twelve hours on you, with the way you’ve been responding to meds lately. I only brought enough to get you through tonight, the rehearsal if you need it, and the wedding,” Blaine explained.
Tony stared at him for a fraction of a second too long, then turned his attention back to his juice.
“Well—”
Ben nodded thoughtfully. “I guess I can see that being an issue.” He cocked his head with a little smirk. “Don’t judge me. I drown my salad in ranch.”
“Oh.” Tony’s face fell. “Right. That makes sense.”
Steve was so tired. Not physically tired—never physically tired—but exhausted all the same. He wanted to sleep, to curl up alone in the sand and pretend he could face this in the morning.
A buzz sounded from Peter’s pocket and he dug out his phone. “Dad’s here,” he explained. He grabbed his backpack and things, glancing at Steve a few times like he might just shatter. Steve just kept his smile, his eyes dry and his hands steady.
“What? It’s not like I can hurt myself on this track. Worst I can do is stub my—”
Bucky dusted his knees off as he stood. “Lookouts ain’t just gonna be lookin’ out. If we can see ‘em, they can see ‘em. And they ain’t gonna be goin’ home to mama if the enemy sees ‘em.”
This was Jackson’s fault, as much as Steve knew his therapist would disagree. Jackson was making him feel like he was alone because Tony wasn’t alone.
“So will I,” Steve countered. “And I think we should announce it relating to the Avengers. That way if anyone finds out it’s a sham, they won’t be able to pin it on a charity or something.”
“Then what are those?” Tony leaned in close, and Steve’s skin crawled where Tony’s breath touched his neck. “What, were you
Seawater hissed over the side of the boat, soaking the men across the deck from where Steve stood. The Major continued.
Steve looked like he might refuse that one too, but a smile spread across his face before he hurried along to his side again.
“It’s okay to still like him, you know,” Natasha said, her voice going softer the way it did when she thought Steve was being too hard on himself (which had happened much more often in the past year).
Bucky followed, their shoulders brushing as he fell into place on the rail beside Steve.  “Yeah. I come up here a lot. Nice and quiet.”
“They were very impressed,” Winona continued. “And the emphasis was on you. Of course Steve Rogers isn’t hurting things, but the way you’ve projected yourself in the social atmosphere really has been quite amazing.”
Still Tony. Still the man he loved.
Sharp little fingernails plucked at his collarbone as Peter shifted again, but Steve didn’t mind. The pediatrician said that skin-to-skin contact was the best way to foster a bond. It was too cold for Peter to be without his footie pajamas, but he had his puffy cheeks pressed against Steve’s chest, which was close enough.
Ben left, and for the next minute or so Steve just smiled to himself. He could start something with Ben. They could at least go on a date to try things out. That was better than what Steve had been doing for the past few months.
He never should have agreed to let them stay for the weekend/
Steve’s eyes glazed over with thoughts of a past that would forever haunt him. The family that would haunt him. Even as he put on a smile and slowly stood up to pack his things, he knew he would never be able to feel whole again. Not after what he had done. What he was about to do.
Blaine continued. “We all have shit to deal with. As long as something like this doesn’t happen again, you deal with it how you want. Just know that we’re at war here. You suck it up, no matter what.”
Peter swallowed, clearly uncomfortable. “I said…I said that we don’t ever do anything and that I’d be out of college right now, like you were, if I didn’t come over there. And then he asked why I was mad and I told him that he always tried to push art on me—and he totally does, Dad—and that I don’t like art. Oh, and I also told him I didn’t want to see him. But I was just mad. He knew that. He said it was okay.”
Tony sat on the edge of his chair, his spine locked, his fingers wound together as though he might haul off and hit something when the inevitable truth came.
Tony nodded slowly, his stomach knotting. He knew he should just tell Steve now, but he knew he wouldn’t.
“Rumor has it, you’ve got a secret admirer, you know,” Tony said before sipping his coffee.
Vision blinked, then shook his head. “Impossible.”
Tony observed him for a moment, then moved again, this time resting his cheek on Steve’s stomach.  Steve tried not to let his breath catch too audibly, and moved his hand to gently card his fingers through Tony’s hair. His heartbeat echoed in his ears so loudly he was sure Tony could hear it. If he did, he didn’t say anything.
“I know. Sometimes that worries me.” Tony played it of like a joke, but Steve could see the concern in his eyes, and maybe a bit of fear too.
Finally, Peter picked up his phone.
There was something knowing in Bucky’s eyes that Tony didn’t think he liked, but he didn’t say anything. He’d asked Steve once about his relationship with Barnes, and Steve had always rolled his eyes. Everyone on the team had thought it, he was sure. Bucky Barnes was a heartthrob, there was no denying it. Those big blue eyes and sad, pouty lips. But Steve was no liar (though he was a truth-withholder) and when he said nothing had happened with Bucky, Tony believed him.
The medic said it would heal in a few days.
A battered wing piece created an arch over the sand, providing a cave-like structure that looked sturdy enough to withstand any harsh winds while offering rain cover. Certainly better than the smoking cockpit.
With that moment over, Tony sighed. “We’ll have to be real about it in the moment, though.  But the pose is good. Maybe accentuate the height difference a little, bend in a little more—that’ll make front page.”
“I don’t have a shrug thing.”
They were on this mission to grab a few hard drives, but something had to be on them if operators were being sent out instead of soldiers. Steve didn’t really enjoy thinking about how some people thought his and Blaine’s lives were worth a chunk of metal and wiring, but worse was that they could be killed without even knowing what information was on the files.
Steve washed his face in the sink after pulling the drain, then inspected his work. A good, clean shave. He gently applied his aftershave—Tony’s favorite scent—and turned to Peter before scooping him up.
“Morgan invited me,” Thor said proudly. “After we were acquainted over iced cream a moon ago.”
“You keep staring at that thing. Don’t tell me you put some crazy robo killing machine in there,” Rhodey said, giving him a pointed look.
“He was not clingy,” Tony argued. “Just needed someone to talk to.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, ruffling his hair again. He navigated his phone and hesitated only a moment before clicking the “Allow Location” button.
Gravelle’s was a restaurant that was supposed to look like something old and European. It was impossible to tell which country it was modeled after though, because it was clearly designed by someone so wealthy they had never stepped into real…whatever it was they were going for. The lighting was a warm gold, the walls decorated with sepia photographs, framed letters on worn paper, and a smattering of aged sports memorabilia. It didn’t look authentic to Steve, and he wondered if Tony had planned that.
“So, how’s life on a waterfront property, Spangles?” Tony asked as he plopped down in a chair next to Peter.
“Doesn’t excuse it, though,” Tony said with a shrug.
“Oh, you think that’s funny, huh?”
Blaine was unfazed. “Then explain to me what happened so I can rule that out.”
Jackson knew. He knew about Tony’s PTSD infected, depression ravaged ex husband. He probably knew about Steve’s ridiculously embarrassing fits too.
Steve glanced over the computer modem at the woman on the floor, watching for just a moment as blood spilled from her lips like red wine, pooling dark onto the floor.
Tony shot him a glare as a guilty expression came to Jackson’s face. “Oh, Steve,” Jackson said, shaking his head, “that’s not—“
“—not so bad,” Steve was saying as he sipped a champagne flute.
Peter nodded. “Yup. He just said ‘yeah’ and walked me to the door.”
“Love you too,” Tony replied. “But my mouth is gonna be sore by the time we get there if we keep up all this sappy stuff.”
be involved.”
Steve cocked a brow. “Tony’s? What the fuck, Rhodey!”
I love you, Steve. And when I’m lying here in my penthouse sucking in my last couple breaths with Jackson here next to me, I’m going to wish it was you. When I told you I wouldn’t leave him for you even if you asked, I was lying. I hope I was, anyway. When you still didn’t want me, I thought that at least I’d never feel empty again. Yet here I am knowing I’m going to die, that emptiness still lingering.
Steve grabbed the beer and took a swallow, grimacing as the taste of hops mixed with the rather unpleasant remnants of his breakfast.
A least Tony didn’t feel the temptation to finish it off.
the way back, until only a little red film remained. It wasn’t quite as impressive as chugging a bottle of Patron, but he only had so many options as a—
“More like a long night,” Tony mumbled, but he wasn’t being mean.
“Hey, Tony, Steve greeted, but his voice wasn’t as strong as he’d hoped.
He smelled something cooking, but he didn’t really have a nose to decipher dishes from afar. Tony made his way to the kitchen to find Steve standing at a steaming pot, stirring some bubbling noodles.
His lungs began to burst and his throat began to open and all he saw was print black lettering from the pamphlet page he never finished reading:
Tony just kissed him in response, humming contentedly when Steve pressed to meet him. He was such a good kisser. Tony claimed credit for at least helping in that, and Steve had only gotten better with age. If he kept his eyes closed, he could forget the face he was lying to, and believe that everything would work out okay.
“Ye—Peter, just—“ Tony put his head in his hands as Steve quickly stood up, arms crossed and eyes ringed red.
“Sir,” Francine interrupted. “We’ve locked.”
“I’d feel better if you just came over here and checked her out,” Tony murmured.
“Right. Well, just in case.”
“She knows,” Steve said with a nod toward Mrs. Freeman. She looked up as if on cue, offering a wide smile and raising her eyebrows at Steve. “She’ll watch Morgan,” Steve added with a sheepish wave in return.
The air thickened between them and Steve felt another lick of self-disgust at Bucky’s hurt. “Buck,” Steve murmured.  “I’m sorry.”
“I’d scold you for that, but now you’re gonna have to hear it constantly too,” Steve chuckled. Then his voice softened, “I love you too.” So much his chest ached just saying it. “So much.”
“Hey Harry,” Steve said with a return wave before extending a hand to Jackson. “Jackson, great to see you.”
It was a mug, painted with blue and black glaze with a spray of bright white flecks to create a striking scene of the night sky, giving the impression that sipping from the mug would be sipping from the stars.
“Dada, no,” Morgan groaned as he patted her face again. She was only half awake, but she was going to be a terror if she regained full consciousness.
It didn’t feel like a place that a little kid would be toddling around, or a place two husbands would return to and call home.
Sure enough, she appeared in the next room, crawling into bed and slipping beneath the covers. The man followed, still smiling as he sat on the bed and kicked off a pair of slippers. The target emerged from the blankets when the man leaned back against the headboard, resting her head against his chest, giving Bucky the perfect angle to shoot her in the heart.
No, Candice’s son made that.
Steve started pulling off his tourniquet. “If he really doesn’t want me at the wedding, I won’t go. But I want to be there to support him. I don’t want him thinking I’ve abandoned him. That’s what Tony thinks.”
Steve didn’t move right away. He actually considered going back into the shower and getting hard yet again to give Tony one last good fuck before this was all over. His fingers twitched as he nearly reached for the handle.
“Steve, please.” Tony stepped back again. “I get it. I’m going to try to be an adult about this.”
“I’m okay,” Steve said, but he still hadn’t tried to use his legs.
Morgan raced off even as Tony reached out to stop her. Steve had her under his spell too, it seemed. His own daughter, whom he had tried so hard to protect from people who would abandon her the way Steve had abandoned him.
“I know you’re part of a task force,” Peter said in a voice that was too deep. “I’m Peter Stark.”
The silence that followed felt indignant somehow.
Not-Tony rolled his eyes. “No, Steve.  I’m just saying that you have to be rested. You’re stressed, you’ve been through a lot.” Not-Tony moved from where he’d been leaning and headed for the bar. “You’re not required to stay here. But there’s plenty of room if you want somewhere familiar to sleep.”
He’d loved those games. Celebrating plays with Tony, getting the best seats, meeting some of the players. Most of all, it had made Tony beyond happy to be able to spoil him. Steve had always made a point to keep Tony away from spending too much money on him, but baseball games were the exception to the rule.
Happy stood at the end of the aisle red-faced and sweaty, suffocating in his tux. His hair was dyed now—it didn’t have quite the same color anymore. Happy was getting older, jowlier, aged. No longer a bodyguard, that was for sure, though he still worked for the security team at Stark Industries. At least, last time Steve had heard.
“I have a few phone calls to make,” Steve said quietly as he stood up.
“Tony. Here.” Steve put on a smile as he crossed to them, aware that everyone was watching. “What’s going on?”
“What’s the picture?” Steve asked, nodding toward the frame.
Steve.
“You’re okay,” Tony soothed, gently dabbing his forehead with a damp cloth. “You’re safe.”
Steve meant it as a funny thing, but all Tony could think about was Steve Rogers sitting alone, calling into radio stations for museum tickets (as if it could get more sad) for entertainment. He did so love to torture himself.
“I just wanted to say—“
“Just getting people checked in. Um, your seat is in the back here. Let me show you.” She nodded toward the chairs in the sand.
The tabloid articles scrolled through the hologram screen, all plastered with the same picture of Steve holding Tony’s hand, both of them hurrying into a waiting Escalade. They even held hands getting into the car. So yes, it was a bit incriminating.
“It’s okay, Petey,” he murmured into the soft fuzz on Peter’s head. “Papa’s right here. Papa’s got you. Papa’s got you.”
“No more,” Steve said with a shake of his head. “If you get sober, we can have this as much as you want.”
Jackson’s voice.
“Hey, that’s my son,” Steve said. “Turn it up.”
“When we’re found guilty, we want grace,” the pastor continued. “We need it. Sometimes we beg for it. But when we find others guilty, it’s exactly what we don’t give.”
One punch, and both of them would end up in the hospital. It was so feasible that Steve felt a shiver run down his spine. Already, they had come close to that. Things had been thrown, horrible insults spewed. It was only a matter of time before it all got worse.
“Did you really bring three watches?” Jackson asked as he started unpacking Tony’s clothes. “And the Rolex? Really?”
Jackson thought they were out of Steve’s sight, but Tony had his eyes open and was staring Steve dead in the face.
Tony’s lips feathered along his brow, then pressed to his cheekbones, his jaw. “I’m right here, Peter’s right here. That’s where we’ll always be.”
Blaine smirked, but it faded. For a moment he just stared at the ceiling, “You think you’re gonna be alone the rest of your life, Steve?”
The floor was…clean. The concrete looked new, the lines freshly painted. The grout in the subway tile was clean, and the only sign of unkemptness was the pieces of posters from old advertisements still stuck on the corkboard. There was no graffiti on the platform, no smell of mildew—the air wasn’t even humid. He inhaled and didn’t get the sense that his lungs were filling with grime. It was
Water sloshed against the shower door. “Fuck off, Steve. Or fuck me, those are the options.”
“Yeah, yeah.” He let out a sigh. “See, I remember workin’ the docks all day, comin’ home absolutely beat only to find that you’d gotten sick while I was away. ‘Course, I thought, can’t leave Stevie to die here, so I go all the way back down eight flights, two blocks over to the corner store to get ya some cough syrup. Then I go all the back up those stairs—my feet are just achin’, Stevie—“
Steve was quick to look away once he realized he was staring and gave Peter’s head another kiss.
“That was one time and—“
Tony’s eyes narrowed. “I really don’t care if you’re asking. And you’re throwing me into cars and pointing guns at me. That’s not really getting you any points.”
Steve laughed quietly. “I get it, I get it.”
“Always good,” Steve hummed in reply, soaking in the sensation of Tony’s calloused fingers moving along his skin.
Bucky frowned. “Just ‘cause she says some nice things doesn’t mean she’s in your corner.”
His therapist said that his art helped him heal. Steve believed her.
Even still, he could see Steve getting angry about a bunch of rich kids and their parents spending a bunch of money on art class for toddlers. For Tony it was a matter of security. This place had the protection and discretion that he wouldn’t be able to find publicly, and he wasn’t going to put Morgan at risk of a media frenzy or a security issue. Of course, he didn’t trust the art class facility to provide enough protection either, so he always had a sentinel on standby on the roof of the building in case anything were to go amiss.
Steve just shook his head, too tired to start another argument.
The intro music was played by a pianist sitting to the right of the crowd at a black grand piano that must have been brought in from someplace fancy. It was untouched by the fine beach sand, perched on a platform to keep it safe. Not that Tony would care if something happened to it. Paying for a piano would be nothing. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Tony had bought the thing just for the ceremony.
“Yeah?”
Tony pouted for a minute, embarrassed that he’d said anything. This thing with Steve was a stupid crush thing. The only reason it wasn’t gone was because Steve wasn’t the kind of guy you could just make out with and be done with it (to put it tamely). They worked together. They were friends.
“Right,” Steve said, shuffling down the narrow little hallway into his tiny kitchen.  A smirk came to his lips. “Kiss goodbye?”
‘Tony definitely regrets saying goodbye,” our source confessed. ‘Now that they’ve been working together again, it’s been getting harder and harder for him.’
His therapist said it would help. He believed her.
“How are we looking for the afterparty?” Tony asked, running a finger along his most recent armor. He rubbed the dust between his fingers as he continued up the stairway.
Steve heard the clink of a Zippo and looked over to Emory, who had the letter dangling between two fingers as he lit the paper on fire.
Disagreeing with the Accords had been a personal decision. It had expedited an already inevitable breakup, widening the cracks in their relationship they’d been able to gloss over before. “Taking a break” had come shortly before Siberia, and at that time, Steve had believed it would all blow over. He had truly—naively—believed that it was just a break. That maintaining a romantic relationship and a political war was too much to handle at once. And maybe they could have fixed it, if Tony hadn’t found out what Steve had hidden from him.
Steve smirked into the pillow. He couldn’t combat that one and he knew it. “Fine,” he mumbled, reaching over to smooth his hand over Tony’s thigh. It felt too intimate, but Steve tried his luck anyway. They weren’t going to get anywhere if they avoided everything that felt like it used to.
And Tony had been. Steve had slept in his bed many nights during the messy divorce proceedings. He hated himself for those nights now, but at the time he knew he’d needed them. It wasn’t like they had sex, Steve just needed Tony to be there. His biggest fear was that he would lose Tony forever, and Tony made sure that wasn’t the case.
“He won’t ask,” Tony assured him. Yes, he was comforting the man who had murdered his parents in cold blood.
Meanwhile, Steve felt the puncture as two hundred dollars left his bank account to pay for the sculpture.
“I’ll close out.” He fished out a hundred dollar bill. “That should cover it, I’d say. Keep the change.”
Jackson said he would never do any of those things around Steve because though he couldn’t understand completely, he wanted to try, and if Steve didn’t want those things going on, he wouldn’t do it.
“I took away your pride, Stark,” Thor chuckled. “And the Captain’s love of self-torture.”
Tony shook his head with a yawn.
Tony swallowed his fries and jumped in with a question just after Steve took a hunk out of his cheeseburger.
“You send it?” Steve asked, a smile on his face. Not forced. Real.
“No,” Steve answered, as though Tony had been asking the question seriously. “But I did watch the news.”
He wasn’t sure if he was lying.
Rhodey laughed, but the kind of laugh that meant he was absolutely going to bring a Cap doll. He drained his drink with finality, indicating their evening was coming to a close. That was just fine with Tony, as he could see Morgan’s eyelids drooping as she continued grinding his action figure’s face into the carpet.
“We made it through,” Tony said, looking up from his hands. “It was a rough patch, but we both moved past it. Things got better.”
So here he was, fingering through the now-feathered pages of the divorce agreement drawn up by Tony’s lawyers that still hadn't been signed.  The only indication that Tony cared about him at all were the terms that he was going to get a million-dollar yearly salary on top of his consultant pay, and a monthly housing stipend. Of course, Steve didn’t need any of that money, but Tony’s lawyers had insisted it was part of the deal.
For Vision, it was easy to remove emotion from the matter and see clearly that this was the best choice. Tony’s productivity and innovation had significantly decreased since Steve’s entry into his life. More so after their marriage. As Tony had argued that night, the world needed his work in order to stay ahead. Steve was going to live most of his life without him anyway, so it was best to stop this now.
“Peter, wait until dinner,” Steve scolded lightly as he found Peter shoveling down handfuls of potato chips.
“I’ve been to war,” Steve growled.
“But it’s bad enough that you’ll try to kiss me to shut me up,” Steve tested.
Steve hoped he would find it, whatever it was.
Blaine didn’t even take his chance to joke about wire cutters when they reached the fence and he pulled out a pair. This was a mission now, not a social gathering. Steve kept an eye on the men at the gate while Blaine flicked on the cutters to produce a beam of energy between the two metal prongs. The beam sliced through the metal like a hot knife through butter, and without a sound.
“Good,” Tony repeated. “Now, can I go home?”
Steve nodded. “Much better, thanks. I…mean that. Thank you for checking in on me.”
“Come on. Let’s get this girl back safe.”
“They don’t know the real you, no.”
Steve slid his hand underneath Peter’s, smiling a little at how warm it was. And how small. Peter’s fingers barely reached his knuckles.
“It’s wine—”
And Tony has saved a core of it. When Steve had asked him why, he had just given him a sweet kiss and told him it was “for the future.”
“Hey—“
Steve turned to look over at the bar again, to those ugly lamps.
Winona collected her purse and left without a word, not even glancing at Tony as she did so. Somehow that made him feel even worse.
“I mean, I’m not sure yet,” he started. “But it’s been—the past few weeks have been—”
Tony licked his lips, looking down at the glass. He wasn’t supposed to taste tannins. The back of his throat wasn’t supposed to feel hot after drinking virgin wine.
“They have an hour to make it 400 meters in full ghillie. Once they’re within a hundred meters, they take a shot. A blank,” he added when Steve looked momentarily panicked. “We’re the lookouts. We see if we can identify the shooter. When we think we can see ‘em, we send a Sergeant out with a stick to where we think they are. If he can put the stick out and the candidate is within that circumference, they go packin’.”
Pepper frowned.
“Really fast,” Steve clarified, though he knew Peter didn’t need it.  He used the lapse in excitement to set Peter down, ruffling his hair. “Go grab your bag, Pete. And get Papa’s shield.”
Tony smirked. “Talk to you later, Spangles. Have a good night.”
Tony was there, watching from the kitchen.
Peter gave him a relieved smile and went back to eating his chips.
The elevator doors closed, and Steve looped  an arm around Tony’s waist, tugging him close until they were hip to hip. Tony settled into the hold, letting out a contented sigh.
“What is that?” Steve asked, pointing at the snail.
Steve narrowed his eyes, finally able to look at his son. “Peter, calm down right now. We can discuss this—“
His phone buzzed somewhere on the floor, and he could hear the ping of a text coming from his kitchen in a tone he didn’t use, but he knew it was Tony’s.
“It only takes one sighting. Or one creak of the gate for the other people in the street to know he has visitors. This house is way too easy to access.”
Tony cut him a glare. “Doubt her security team would let you in the front gate, and there’s a mile-long driveway for you to walk with a stick up your ass.”
The only Major on the boat shook the ash off the end of his cigarette and cleared his throat.
“Goddammit,” came Tony’s reply.
“Pretty sure,” Tony chuckled. “She does look like me, huh.”
“Me either,” Steve lied. It was for the best for both of them.
“What are you doing here?” he blurted out. “What the he—” He stopped himself. There were children around, after all. “Explain.”
He was getting used to his little bedroom. It wasn’t actually that little, for starters, but having a queen bed instead of a king in Stark Tower qualified as little. He liked that he actually had some wall space instead of just windows along the outer edge of the room, and he’d taped his favorite pictures of Tony there, including a photo of the charcoal drawing he’d given Tony for Christmas that year. The walls were also a nice pastel blue, homey, yet it fit in with the modern design. The dresser was white, sleek and modern with drawers that looked like they might contain advanced technology rather than shirts and socks. Steve was getting used to it.
Steve stood unmoving, a marble statue in the center of the growing dread.
“Uh, you definitely did. You gave me the silent treatment for two days before I went to South Africa.”
Something wasn’t right.
“Right. Well.” There was something heavy in Steve’s voice that Tony had lost the ability to recognize.
“Steve’s vitals. I know what I elected,” Tony muttered.
Immediately, Steve launched into action beside his friend, his protective instinct kicking into overdrive.
“Can I hold it when Daddy comes?” Peter asked, all but bouncing in Steve’s arms. “he’ll think I’m really tall!”
Something had just happened in that coffee shop, and Steve somehow knew that he and Tony were going to be different now. He had never once brought up Bucky before, not even when most of the Avengers were sure something had to be going on.
Which was why it was getting harder and harder for him to see Steve becoming part of this family. He’d been away almost too long now, and Morgan had no idea who he was. If he started showing up all the time and taking his attention, he feared Morgan would feel left out, or like he didn’t love her more than the whole world.
But everyone just assumed he was here to cause a scene. To hurt Tony.
And when Tony smiled, Steve smiled too. And it was real, and it was warm.
He always ran faster when Steve was in his head.
He thought of putting her in her crib, but there was always a chance she could get worse. If he fell asleep, how would he know? (Friday—but maybe she would malfunction!) He didn’t dare give her another dose of Motrin, and she was in no state to be asked to eat food.
Steve had been pacing the lobby of his hotel for the past hour, and had been trying to get ahold of his son for the past thirty minutes. Going back to his room would end very badly, he knew. Besides, Malibu was too sunny and beautiful to be cooped up in a tiny room anyway. The grand expanse of the lobby was much better.
“Bucky—”
He had a feeling Bucky was the reason for Jackson’s worried expression.
He felt a familiar ache, wishing he could be out there in combat fighting alongside his friends. A distraction from his oncoming divorce would be a godsend right now. But he’d made his move, and he was sticking to it. Until things ended with Tony, he was going to be an Avengers consultant. On the off chance things between them were fixed, he’d take steps to rejoin the team. But they were past being fixed now.
Tony’s lips parted, coaxing Steve to taste him. He readily complied, slipping his tongue past Tony’s lips. His fingers bunched into Tony’s shirt, but he didn’t dare tug. He didn’t want to devolve into sex. Not when Tony clearly just wanted to distract him.
Pepper, who had been a bridesmaid (though he realized now that bridesmaid probably wasn’t the right word) at his wedding was now looking at him the same way she looked at one of Tony’s fans. He didn’t even know what she was doing with her life anymore.
Steve would be the name they wrote on their Christmas cards and the strange man in Maine that bought their grandpas a falcon statue for their wedding. The strange man who Daddy visited sometimes when it had been too long to be politically correct. But only sometimes.
“Tony—” A fountain of crimson burst from his lips, spraying Tony’s face. Steve used every ounce of his being to lift a hand—now blackened except for where white bone stuck through at his knuckles and skin yellowed before it began to melt away.
“He doesn’t feel like a prisoner,” Tony told him. “I don’t know what’s going on with that kid. Hormones, probably. But he loves it here.”
“Papa?” came a call from the kitchen.
“And he’s also an adult. Don’t cut’m slack because he’s your kid. He isn’t stupid,” Bucky said. “I know Tony’s wedding wasn’t good for you. This ain’t gonna be any better.”
“I didn’t ask you, no,” Steve said quietly, thumbing Tony’s cheekbone. “But I asked Pepper all the time. Asked Rhodey, even got Happy to give me a few details every now and then. But Morgan told me the most.”
Steve glanced around the room once more to see if he might have forgotten anything, but his wallet and keys were tucked in his pockets, his phone in hand, and the key card to the hotel was waiting for them in the lobby.
“Easy there, Cap,” Tony warned. “I know you like to get all handsy before deployment, but that’s not in the cards today.”
Tony let out a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I…Sorry, Steve,” he said, as though he were reading off a card.  I just thought…I don’t know what I thought. I’m sorry. It’s fine if you’re here, you just caught me off guard.”
“Did you think we’d ever get here?” Tony asked quietly as they admired one of Morgan’s drawings with a summer theme. She’d painted ice cream with drips of paint. “Walking through a gallery looking at my daughter’s art? Actually together with a kid?”
While they fucked—Tony thought it was making love, but it wasn’t—Steve felt like his real self was sitting across the room, looking past them at the moonlit city out the window. His body was reacting to the touch, the rhythm, the warm skin, but his mind wasn’t there at all.
“They spoke pretty good English too.”
Tony gritted his teeth. “Peter’s been very busy—“
“Daddy and I love you,” Steve told his little son. “You’re ours. You’re my Petey, not hers. You’re my Petey.”
“Jesus,” Steve hissed as he startled. He tossed down the towel onto the counter and hurried back into the bedroom to find Tony standing in the doorway, clutching a small picture frame in his hand.
“Am I the only one?” Steve asked, his voice rough.
The boat smelled like dead fish and saltwater, mixed with faint odors of rifle grease and old sweat. It didn’t matter if he breathed through his mouth or his nose; the smells of war permeated everything.
“You and me,” Steve repeated, hoping to drive that point home. To plant something in Tony’s mind as to why he might have suspected this was going somewhere else.
The elevator slowed to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a room Steve had never seen before. To be fair, he didn’t think he had ever been on the 66th floor, but he was fairly certain there were no ballrooms in the tower he knew.
“It was the first thing that came to mind,” Steve admitted, cheeks flushing. “It wasn’t—can I talk to you somewhere else please?”
Jackson didn’t deserve this.
Papa. The word Peter only ever used when he was in private with Steve, when he was upset or wanted to borrow some money for the movies.  He couldn’t refuse when Peter called him Papa.
“So tell me,” he growled. “I think I’ve waiting long enough.”
Steve watched with a grimace as the creature was ripped apart from the inside, Giant Man elbowing his way out of the creature with a battle cry.
“I could see about a bath,” Tony offered.
On the second floor, he eyed his target. She was brushing her teeth, blonde hair falling out of a haphazard ponytail. She was talking to someone—no, singing a song. A rock song, judging from the way her face wrinkled and contorted. His rifle made a series of clicks as he adjusted his scope, eyeing the trees around the house to gauge the wind.
He didn’t dare try Bucky.
Steve shrugged, spearing a piece of lettuce with his fork. He had gotten the message very quickly. He was here because Tony had probably insisted upon it, but he certainly wasn’t welcome.
Pancake breakfasts and art. The two things Peter had screamed at him for. Art being the one that Peter had claimed was forced upon him, stuffed down his throat.
Bucky gave him a look. “Steve. I’m sure she’s a real nice gal, but she’s done shit for you. If she wanted you around so bad, don’tcha think she’d make sure to send you an invitation on time? Or force Peter to call you?” He pursed his lips. “You see too much good in people you’re close to, Steve.”
It rang once.
As usual, they cut the line. Men grumbled behind them as they filled their plates far past the allowed amounts, but hey, today was mashed potatoes and gravy.
“Agree to disagree.” Tony pecked his cheek, then grabbed a pair of flashy sunglasses from his dresser. “Let’s get going, we’re getting past the fashionable part of fashionably late.”
came from his rifle as the silencer muzzled the noise. Then the glass burst apart and the target jerked, a ragged hole where her sternum had been just moments before.
Steve had always liked how Tony incorporated such tiny gestures into his creations.
Blaine’s smile tightened a little. “I just go by Blaine.”
“I don’t really know. I guess we both realized we weren’t meant to do the life thing without each other.” Tony paused for a moment before letting out a little snort. “Or I guess he wasn’t supposed to do the life thing without me.”
“He was upset, Steve. Kids get angry sometimes and—“
If Tony noticed, he didn’t say anything, and instead shepherded Steve down to the other end of the bar while their drinks were made.
A lump formed in Tony’s throat, one that told him Bucky was telling the truth.
“Does it react to electricity?” Steve asked, opening his desk drawer and putting the agreement away so he could get to work. He checked his phone, but there were no messages from Tony. No response to his asking if they could talk later.
Steve reluctantly moved away then, and Tony let go of him. He swung his feet to the floor and made his way to the bathroom on shaky legs. He started the shower, wondering just how long it would be until Tony disappeared again to go off with his lover. How many times a week they had this, when he’d been waiting over a year, and the Tony he was making love to was high as a kite.
Adrenaline slicked through his blood, icing his veins and flaring his nostrils as he stared into the house. Through the dust and darkness he found his targets before sound could even penetrate his ears.
Steve glared at him before heading to the elevator. He pressed the button to retrieve it and faced Not-Tony again, uncertain. Bucky trusted this man, so Steve had to be able trust him for one night. With weapons at the ready, just in case.
lonely, and living here is pretty isolating even with the team around.”
Maybe that was why Steve sometimes wished he loved him. Because if he loved Bucky, then he would never have to fear ending up in the life he was currently living.
He punched in Bucky’s number okay.
They were both absolutely filthy, sticky, and Steve knew getting in the shower would lead to a few more rounds. He didn’t care. He’d needed this day just as much as Tony had. It would probably be their last like this together.
Peter squealed with delight. A winner.
He held himself together though, like he had learned to do in the war. Emotional though he was, Steve had still been trained like any other soldier, and then like any other officer. If things got bad, he was the one who sucked it up and led his team.
But Tony hadn’t met him at the tarmac. Natasha had to drive him back home, because his bike was at the tower. There were no new texts or voicemails on his burner phone when he reactivated it. He didn’t dare open up the internet, too afraid to see Tony with someone else.
Thor moved on to Rhodey, who had been smart enough to grab a Moscow mule earlier. He was satisfied with that, and poured a nearly-spilling glass of wine for Steve.
“You really don’t have to spoon me,” Tony muttered, his voice muffled in his pillow.
But it was always different knowing the bodies were there because of his bullets.
Receiving the news a month late was no surprise either. Snail mail was the only way to contact him now, aside from the military. Jackson probably could have gotten word to him through the comm somehow, but Steve doubted he was all that invested in Steve knowing.
toward Tony—and even if he was, it would be an attempt to hate him. Instead, five hours near him and Steve was breaking down walls he had spent a year building up again.
Dessert was served not long after his and Tony’s speeches, and Steve trusted himself to be able to properly eat chocolate mousse cake without coming off as even more of a fool. Tony unsuccessfully tried to engage him in conversation, but Steve answered with as few words as possible. He wanted to go home. Not back to his apartment up the street that the US government had so kindly loaned them, but back to his pod and his men and his bare necessities.
“Just arrived, boss,” Friday informed him. “We’ll send her up once she clears security.”
Steve turned his head, gazing over at him. He couldn’t help but feel that Tony was awfully focused on work when his boyfriend was lying in bed next to him for the first time in years and leaving soon. But this was also new, and even Steve felt raw if he thought about it too much. Tony had carved something out of his heart he wasn’t sure he would ever get back, even if Tony did return to his life like he wanted. And he did want that now. He wanted this.
“It’s good for her, though,” Steve assured him in that gentle tone he always used when he was worried about Tony getting upset.
Ben frowned at his watch and glanced at his empty salad container. “Maybe some other time. I’ve really gotta run.” Ben stood. “This was great, Steve. Thanks for letting me sit with you.”
Steve stood up and turned toward where Tony, Jackson, and Pepper were standing. Tony was dressed in a sharp tux with a red tie, and matching red sunglasses. Jackson had a similar getup, but in light blue.
Oh shit.
Steve took his seat, cocking a brow at the menu: a piece of rough-cut paper on a thick clipboard that looked like it had one been part of a table itself.
Steve let out a shaky sigh and cringed when embarrassment began flooding in to replace his…insanity. He had no idea what else to call it. God, he was such a child. This was exactly why he lived alone, to stop from embarrassing himself when something made him upset. He would have been fine if Tony had just driven off instead of coming up here.
“Or you can hang out with your dad,” Steve teased. “I look close enough to your age.”
“Steve!”
Steve smiled as he stood up from the bed and began to unpack. He really was happy—tomorrow would be a great time with his friends and with Peter. And seeing Tony wouldn’t be bad either. And Jackson.
“I just stopped by to see what was for breakfast,” Bucky said, though it was clear he was lying. He was still wearing his running clothes.
He had expected this.
“Then what’s the other one for?”
Steve kept his gaze on the elevator doors at the end of the hall. “I’m not U.S. military. I’ve told you that.” He slid his gaze to her, eyes narrowed. “And no, this is not how rescued hostages are treated. My team doesn’t rescue hostages.”
A seventy-year time shock had been nothing compared to this. Coming out of the war had been a walk in the park.
“Yeah, after I sign the paperwork on the tarmac,” Steve groaned.
Bucky had said he would stay up the whole night with the lights on, just in case Steve had to step out and needed a place to go. Bucky had also said he would try to kill Tony if he saw him. As though getting a boyfriend after fifteen years of divorce was somehow a betrayal.
Rhodey turned to look over his shoulder at the apartment complex across the street. “Eh, I dunno about that. Definitely different, but I wouldn’t say it’s ugly.”
“Tony—”
“If I wanted to kill you I would have shot you in the head when you walked out, idiot.”
Tony was worried about him, Steve knew. Worried about how he had to be the one taking care of Peter at all times, only reluctantly allowing Tony to do it when he was just too tired or too busy. Steve constantly had Peter in his arms, to the point that even he knew it was a bit ridiculous. But he couldn’t let go. Peter only had so many days left as their new little baby.
With a warning glance at Thor, Tony took a careful sip to find that the taste of wine wasn’t there, just something like gritty juice.
Pearson said he found him at the perimeter fence, but Steve had no memory of being there. Yet when he closed his eyes, he saw the coils of razor wire and felt the warmth spreading up his arms.  He also remembered an embrace, almost a spiritual experience.  He saw the problem too: a gap in the fence. A gap that needed fixed and secured before time was up, before the bomb exploded, before he was discovered.
Steve had been captured by the enemy many times in his life, and he didn’t think he’d ever woken up in a way that could be considered “peaceful,” but this time he was pleasantly surprised. Of course, he was still tightly secured to something that resembled a mix between a hospital bed and a dining chair, but he didn’t have a pounding headache or pain. The discomfort came from the areas he had been stung—they itched and his muscle felt prickly, like his limbs had fallen asleep. The grogginess from waking up felt natural, and Steve found he was clear-headed in a matter of moments.
“And that was a joke, by the way,” Tony said over his shoulder. “I don’t get tired from science.”
“When was the last one?” Steve asked, trying to think what it could possibly be. Bucky knew to always leave a message, and he was the only one that had his “work” number. If he’d given it to anyone, it was probably Peter.
Steve hesitated, but then stepped underneath the beach-themed archway.
“And let you try to find your way back? No thanks,” Steve chuckled as he went around to the other side of the car. He was sweaty, but his breathing had slowed to a normal pace. No one would guess that he had gone one a thirty-mile run.
“My ex husband died last month,” Steve said quietly. “Just got word. He sent me this.” He glanced at the letter. “Read it.”
Headed in the opposite direction of the gift table.
It smelled the same.
Tony shook her hand and smiled on reflex, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His heart was in his stomach, and the room would start to spin soon if he didn’t get some answers.
Seventy years later, he still wondered how he could have possibly been that naïve.
“Any of it,” Bucky cut. Then, softer: “Please.”
He laughed, a broken sound. “No, no. I just wanted to tell you that I made it through the wedding okay. It was really nice. The reception was ridiculous, just like I said it would be.” Bucky hadn’t mastered phone calls. This conversation would never happen in real life—Bucky would see straight through it. But the phone masked things. Steve picked at his thumb. “Some drunk guy started stripping on a tent pole. It’s not even six o’clock.”
Warm hands slipped under his shirt and Steve could only grin before he met Tony’s lips for a long kiss.
Blaine would have hated him, but Steve got along with him fine. Emory had an ego, but Steve was a master at making sure that ego didn’t show up around him. He’d married Tony Stark, after all.
Tony turned, one eyebrow cocked. “Is Bucky coming for dinner?”
His heart was withered and dry in his chest and he could feel it with every breath. Everything hurt. Everything just
“Where were you this time?” Tony asked, searching Steve’s face.
He could never kill himself.
See, Steve had always overlooked one thing that was always present: that perfectly tuned, pulsing monster in his chest that gave him fresh blood, fresh life, fresh poison. It kept him young when he was supposed to be decaying, and yes, maybe it should have occurred to him that those perks weren’t just physical. He could hurt just as long as he could defy aging. He could inflict self-torture far beyond what any normal human being could ever take.
“Daddy’s fine,” Tony assured her, crouching both to avoid Steve and make sure Morgan could see he wasn’t lying. “No need to be nervous, okay?”
Natasha pointed to a drone photo map of the little area. “He has a courtyard. It’s maybe four feet from the car to the front gate. We’ll be exposed for all of ten seconds.”
Steve clenched his jaw. “Tony, I’ve been just fine for twelve years. I haven’t needed your help before ad I sure as hell don’t—“
“Mhmm. Finished a new suit this morning, and I’m cooking up another one to start on when I can think straight again.” He paused. “Mm, and Rhodey says hi. We went to lunch.”
“Am I sharing you?” Steve demanded. He had to know, and this was the only way he was going to find out.
Steve gave a little shrug. “Maybe.”
He looked sad. Tony saw it behind the fear in his eyes, and he knew exactly what it was. He’d worn the same look years and years ago, standing there shaking in the threshold to Steve’s room at the compound, trying to figure out how not to fuck up asking Captain America out on a date.
Yes, was better if Peter hated him. Hating him was better than growing up with bruises and being frightened and abused.
“Come on,” Tony said, turning. His blanket swished behind him, trailing along the floor as he started walking.
Tony read the letter over a hundred times in the first week, and he never overestimated anything. Or underestimated, for that matter. Steve had been gone for months, and despite this not being the first time Steve had to be away, this time felt worse somehow. Guilt was a heavy weight in Tony’s chest, and he couldn’t go a solid minute without imagining all of the ways Steve was going to come after him when he got home. Some ranged from cold indifference, other nights he woke up in a cold sweat after a nightmare that Steve Rogers might come try to kill him. The worst was that those nightmares were based on factual memory. He knew what it looked like when Steve Rogers had bloodlust in his eyes, his vibranium shield a circular razorblade above his head.
On his desk was a digital photo frame that scrolled through about a dozen pictures of his friends. Him and Bucky in the forties. Him and Bucky a month ago in London, laughing, happy. Natasha with her most recent class of ballerinas, a genuine smile on her face. She looked so strange with wrinkles--somehow Steve had just thought maybe she would never age at all.
“Good,” Tony said with a nod. “Great.”
The house was in order, finally. Steve had spent a whole week scrubbing it down and cleaning every surface, from the false granite countertops to the plastic wood dining table. It felt nice to have a clean house, though Steve hadn’t realized it had gotten so dirty. Then again, he hadn’t really been home a lot. Living in Maine provided far too much adventure and too many community events for him to be dwelling at home. Well, except for the patio.
Peter didn’t answer right away and Steve had to close his eyes and clench his jaw to keep from breaking down right there.
Steve was going to outlive all of these people, yet he had been the first one to be forgotten.
“I’m not going up there,” Steve told Pepper quietly as the first row of people left their seats to congratulate the couple a few moments later.
“You hit your head pretty hard on the way down,” Steve told him, scooting a little closer. Yeah, maybe taking his clothes off hadn’t been the best idea. Though he was dry now, and much warmer than Tony appeared to be.
It didn’t mean anything.
“May I?”
Tony turned slightly, arms hooking around Steve’s waist. “I’m glad too.”
Buying purpose with blood wasn’t the life he had wanted, but war would never stop needing him.
Steve smiled wide, looking him over with a wide grin.
Sword, Juno, Gold, Utah, Omaha. Steve recited the names in his head, pictured the maps, the red pushpins that marked where the Germans were holed up in bunkers, the invisible path they would have to travel to make it to Caen. They had to take Caen by nightfall. They would be safe by nightfall.
Steve’s cheeks turned pink—again.
“No. You haven’t cared about supporting me since the day you shoved divorce papers in Dad’s face and left.”
Steve allowed himself to be relieved about that. He was glad that Tony was okay, even if he knew he shouldn’t be.
He’d earned his happy ending the one time it counted.
“And I’d throw out plans with Rhodey that I’d made weeks ago if you ever texted me that you wanted to see me.” Tony gave a little roll of his eyes. “God, Rhodes would get so pissed.”
There was a line to get into the wedding venue. Steve stood there with a goofy smile, clutching tight to his falcon sculpture. It was meticulously wrapped, complete with a bow and an attached letter of encouragement, as well as his receipt from his donation to Wounded Warriors.  His suit fit perfectly, just like it had when they attended that celebrity wedding that Tony dragged him to twenty years ago “because it would be fun.”
Steve often wondered what Iron Man did for a living outside of the team. What his hobbies were. He was incredibly sensitive to emotion in others, and Steve suspected he might be a therapist. It’d be a perfect cover. And he seemed to know Tony better than Steve did most of the time.
Dust filtered through a shaft of sunlight in Steve Roger’s office. He occupied a sophisticated leather desk chair, sitting at a sleek glass top desk that was clean of clutter. There weren’t even desk decorations, nor photos. He preferred to keep his personal life outside of work as much as possible. The only indication he even had a personal life was the titanium alloy wedding ring wrapped snug around his finger.
The sound of waves made him smile and he veered right, ducking between trees to and breaching from the forest to meet the sun as it burst from beneath the horizon line of the Atlantic. Clouds loomed with red underbellies, but Steve continued on, unperturbed.
Blaine shot Steve a look that he could tell was a ‘I can’t believe you’re sending me off with a fucking
Tony thought for a moment and frowned. “Okay, to be fair, I tell you to come visit me.”
“My special drawing,” she announced before tucking her face into his neck. Tony hoped he didn’t smell like Steve’s cologne, but he probably did.
“There you go,” Blaine chuckled. “Much better, huh?”
“You just love to cause me pain, don’t you,” Steve snarled. “No, I don’t want to go to dinner. I’m done being your puppet, Tony. I thought I could handle whatever it was, but this? This is cruelty and you know it.”
“You want me to?” he asked with a squeeze of Tony’s hand.
Vision cocked his head. “Then why haven’t you?”
How he would end up living alone and empty, always.
Because he still had
“Well, now I’m comforted,” Steve teased.
The pineapple juice sloshed in Rhodey’s glass as he shrugged. “I do missions every so often, but most of my travel is for training work. I just always bring the suit in case something happens.”
Steve shook his head. “You don’t have to do anything.”
He knew that voice. He knew exactly who it belonged to, so intimately that he didn’t have to second guess, even though there was no way the owner of that voice should be there.
He grabbed another.
“Get the bag off her head,” Steve commanded.
He grabbed his duffel, punching the elevator call button about fifty times, hoping like hell Tony didn’t leave the bedroom to come after him.
They weren’t in any real danger, but it was never good to risk it.
Blaine didn’t say anything.
“Steve, baby, c’mere,” Tony said gently, sitting up and putting his hand on Steve’s back, rubbing soothing circles there. “I’m not gone. I don’t hate you. I love you, Steve—just not the same way.”
Steve swallowed hard. “I don’t really know how I can be more clear.”
Steve headed down the stairs as everyone emerged, first going to Peter.
Steve chuckled. “Yeah. There’s no city smog out here. Bugs can actually survive.”
“There’s only one other bed,” Steve whispered stupidly.
Morgan did turn her head around, then grabbed a handful of leftover spaghetti noodles and chucked them right at his face. Pasta hit him on the nose, giving him a nice pasta sauce stripe across his face.
