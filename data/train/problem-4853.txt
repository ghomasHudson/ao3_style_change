I still owe Michael. Owe it to myself. I can’t.” Dean hiccupped as if he’d been crying. It made him flinch and frown.
“I know,” she said noncommittally.  She crossed her arms across her chest.
Billie studied her lap and worked her lips and her jaw, thinking.  “Cas…”
Dean broke the ice. “You heard about Ruby and Alistair?”
Cas pulled the hickory switch out of Dean’s bag without having to dig for it.  He’d packed it there himself, so he knew which pocket it was in.  Cas never travelled anywhere with Dean without making him carry instruments of impact in his bags, even if they never used them before returning back home.  Dean knew they were there, and he had to carry them himself.
“I know, man.  Even Cas tried.  Michael tried.  They want you.  But we had an idea.  Maybe if we gang up on them, all of us, maybe we can overcome the two of them.  You know, just whammy them from all directions.  What d’you think?”
“Will do.” Sam’s eyes hardened again. He could hear the shower running, but Michael had had enough time to get himself clean, so Sam didn’t wait for him to exit on his own. He went on in through Cas’ bedroom door and into the en suite bathroom. Dean began humming to himself as he reviewed the prepped ingredients Sam had selected for his omelet. Ham, tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese, green onions—Dean’s wolf perked right up, thinking Second breakfast sounded like a pretty good idea. (That’s because you’re a glutton,) Dean pointed out. He decided to add bell peppers, but regretfully only prepped enough for one omelet.
“Uh, right.”  She put her listening face on and straightened up, following behind him.
***************
Warm backs and heads settled back into his body to listen and snuggle. Michael leaned back in his chair and tapped Dean’s hip with his foot to gain his eyes and then gestured him up into his lap. Dean’s eyes retained their soft glaze as he perched sideways on Michael’s lap and sought his mate’s scent glands with his nose. Michael cinched him in close.
He pointed a finger in his assistant’s face. “Stop her stipend. Put a hold on her status. She doesn’t so much as check out a book from the library until I find out what’s happened.”
Cas squatted down in front of Dean.  “I can do that without inviting her to the wedding, Dean.  In fact, I believe we did that together with the state we left her bedroom in before she moved into it.  Say, ‘hedonist gay lover’ one more time for me.”
“It was.  Good thinking, Sam.  I’m glad you keep on your toes, and I’m glad you feel empowered to speak up when you have a concern.”
“Fuck them, Dean!  Fuck them all!  You’re proving them right if you lock me up!  You know how to shut their fat faces right up?  Fucking,
Thanks for sticking with me.  I hope you like this one, and it doesn't feel like an emotional cop-out.
right here!” Dean grabbed hold of his junk and shook himself in affirmation.
“What part of ‘Don’t be an ass’ are you not understanding?” asked Gabriel acerbically. “Can we deal with this first?” He nodded toward the bed.
“How is he?”
“Not at all,” he assured her. “We all respond to what we respond to. There’s no right or wrong to it unless we act on it outside of the strictures of ‘competent, consensual, sane, adult’ decisions. It would be wrong of me to force you to play a role that made you uncomfortable, but if you and I align in our desires, nothing we do together to fulfill ourselves is wrong.”
“Oh.”
Michael shrugged.  “It’s been such a whirlwind since we Mated.  We never go out.  We rarely do anything, just you and me, except train and scene.  Talking about taking Pete out to the movies got me thinking.  We never do that either.  What say, we go out on a date, Dean?  You and me.”
“Everything that might be considered a change to our Pack dynamic or a step into a new realm of expression is on hold,” Cas answered.  “So, yes, to all of that.  It’s all suspended for the moment.”
“You don’t like that?” Michael mused, eyeing Dean’s soft dick.  “I thought you wanted a Dominant
“You’re in a good mood this morning,” Michael observed.
“Yessir.”
Dean blushed a little.  “I mean, you got any other suggestions?  I could take the plug out before I walk, but that leaves the lube leaking all over the red runners on the floor.  That’s not a pretty picture to me.  Unless you think I should wash the lube out too, you know, just before the wedding starts.  Course, that means that Cas needs to have a tube of it in his pocket.”
But Fred didn’t know Michael all that well. Couldn’t it be true that Michael had the wool pulled over Fred’s eyes? Was the butler seeing both sides clearly? Wasn’t there a fair chance that Fred held an unconscious bias toward the Top’s perspective? Dean didn’t feel in the wrong, and that was the part that struck him. He and his wolf always knew. He was brat enough to play innocent when he knew he wasn’t, but that never meant he didn’t know deep down. Slowly he shook his head, still facing the floor.
"This is nice…" Kevin admired the car with him. "A real beauty."
Chapter titles are titles of songs by Josh Pyke that fit the mood/theme of the chapter :)
He left Mia to have some alone time and headed to his own room, thinking about just how right his claim about hugging the angel had been. Hugging his brother hadn't felt real; it felt like he was just dreaming that he was home and that it would all be gone in an instant.
Sam nodded slowly, knowing the angel couldn't see him. Did that mean the connection was gone? He didn't want to ask because he felt like he already knew the answer, and it wasn't that.
“Happy birthday Mia!” The archangel said cheerfully, again causing Jody, Sam, and Cas to whip their heads to look at Mia, only more aggressively. “Just remember you are less than half this grandpa’s age,” he continued, clearly talking about Dean.
"Why do they sell popcorn out of a cart?" Lucifer asked as he popped one in his mouth. He'd been trying to take Dean's advice and eat food, but it was still impossible for him to taste it the way humans did. He still tasted every single separate ingredient, but he did come to understand why people loved it so much.
want to play.”
His Alpha had no trouble with that question.  He was
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Dean, he doesn’t want you there. I know it’s a kick in the castanets, but this is his call, son.”
“Apologies, alpha.”
“Claire Novak,” he mused quietly.  “That Alpha’s going to love that.”
It's a marathon wedding reception!  Wolves don't do short parties.
“I’m not angry with you, Cas.  But I’m not changing my mind on her say-so.  There are some people who can irrationally shout at me.  He’s not one of them.”  Cas blinked at her determination and self-confidence.
"Eh bien, c'était étonnamment sexuel pour un sujet de conversation. Qui vous a appris à parler comme ça, de toute façon? Je devrais te laver la bouche avec du savon. sexy mais brutale."
"Charlie, it's Dean Winchester. I'm in Paris, I have been for a while, I mean, I live there, but anyways, what are you doing tonight?" I started when Charlie picked up the phone.
"Je veux mettre mes mains dans tes cheveux moelleux et ma langue dans des endroits où tu ne peux que rêver. Je vous aimerai comme personne ne vous a jamais aimés auparavant et lorsque nous aurons terminé, les voisins connaîtront nos noms. Je vais te baiser jusqu'à ce que tu ne puisses pas te lever. That's how you flirt."
"I could teach you some. I've been living here long enough to get pretty much fluent."
A raised red area stood out on my right cheek when I looked in the mirror that morning.  I could cover the bruises on my chest and back, but my face was hard to hide. I could just keep my head down until school ends, and hope a teacher doesn't notice. Shitty plan, but it's worth a shot.
"Your father's not here. We're at my house." I looked around, noticing I was sitting on a flower print couch in a typical suburban living room with lace curtains, a brick fireplace, and a china cabinet, as opposed to the Winchester household furnishings of sagging couches, stained pillows, and secondhand chairs, accented with empty beer cans and full ashtrays.
We walked down the street, joking until I stumbled into the little courtyard and up the stairs to my apartment, where I slept off the excessive drinks I'd had.
"Cut the gas, greasers!" Someone yelled, which I recognized as Luke Novak, who has a more unfortunate name than Alfie's nickname. The Novak's are very religious, and when their Dad, Chuck, was still at home, he named his kids after angels. Gabriel and Michael got normal names, Cas had a more obscure name, but Lucifer, or Luke, had it bad. He sure gave teachers one hell of a scare on the roll list the first day.
I brushed away some cigarette butts on his grave and set down the bouquet.
"Rebel Without a Cause. Jeez, you writing a book or something?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Look at me when you're talking. Stand up straight. I'll treat you like a man when you start acting like one."
We sprinted down the road until we intersected with Grand Street, then rounded the corner to the park.
He laughed, then turned solemn and whispered, "Dad's really mad."
"Dean, I'm fine, it's just a splash."
"Merci, chéri."
“I’ve driven before, I just want to do this one race.” he gave me puppy eyes.
“One race can’t hurt.” He grinned and bounced up to the car. “Be safe, don’t make me regret this,” I called after him.
i can't remember the name of those mini hotdog things, but just think 50's food. green jello and spray cheese, but slightly nicer.
"Oh I don't know, I'd feel like I'm an unwanted guest," I refused.
I staggered down the cobblestone roads, blissfully unaware of the rain, leaning into Charlie, then a door, then hanging onto a streetlamp for dear life. Swinging around it and hooking my leg around like a terribly trained and drunken pole dancer, I smiled at Charlie.
“Somebody’s gotta race for him.” Kevin sighed.
Michael was arrested after that night and was now doing 9 years.  The courts believed his accident story, and gave him the minimum sentence. But the whole town knew what really happened and nobody did anything. Not even Dad. He hardly looked at me, an when he did, there was just hate in his eyes.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
"It's not a crush, back off," I lied.
"The grease! If they know you're a greaser, they'll kick you out."
"That's not true! It's not! It can't be!"
"You never treat me like anything more than a pile of shit," I mumbled, instantly regretting it.
"Comme ça? Mystérieux et sexy?"
Dean realizes he 's crushing on Cas and John Winchester is a dickbag. What a surprise.
"Why not?" I mock-pouted as I unwound from the pole.
There was no time to argue with him, so I kept running with Sam in tow. We got to our house, and waited in anticipation, for Cas, the socs, or even Dad. I was putting shoes on over my bandages when the phone rang.
“No, Sam you’ve never done this before, you’re fourteen, you haven’t gotten a license. I can drive.” I worried.
"What's going on?" he broke the silence with the childlike curiosity I wish he used elsewhere.
"When you talk dirty in French. I can tell what kind of things you're saying, but I can't understand exactly. It's mysterious and sexy."
"Hey Dad," I said guiltily.
"No-" my voice faltered.
I sat in my apartment by the telephone.
He threw pots from the sink in my direction, bruising my arms and clattering on the walls.
"Hey Charlie, you uh, doin' anything after this? Up for some backseat bingo?"
I pulled the gate shut behind me as I entered the small courtyard. It was more of a small square of concrete floor that was uncovered by apartments and was surrounded by walls. Staring up at the sky I saw clotheslines connecting the sides of the court, lacing from window to window in a mesh of drying clothes. I glanced at the butcher shop with a chipped yellow sign painted on the wall, thinking how I still hadn't gotten used to the sight of cooked ducks hanging in the window. The floor had a puddle of summer rain around the drain, which was now growing as it began to drizzle. I turned up the narrow and creaky staircase that wound around the courtyard so small it hardly counted as a courtyard. Unlocking the front door of my new apartment, I stepped inside. Hanging up my hat and coat as I went in, I sat at my desk for a minute. I looked around the room, a few boxes were left to unpack, but for now, I had to write. Nothing came to me. I moved to Paris to write my novel, but I wasn't getting anything. I am a sorry son of a bitch, I thought to myself. I'm in the most beautiful place in the world with beautiful people, beautiful music, and I can't think of a single word to write. I put my hat back on and went outside. I creaked past my neighbor's place, and the landlady leaned out the window.
"I don't know how."
"I'm painting you. Why else would I face away from the city?" He sighed. "Now go back to writing, you've moved too much already."
He mumbled and clung to the baggy shirt he lent me. I scooted under him so his head was resting on my chest.
I whined and bit my lip. "Like that. God, I love it."
"Nonsense! Everyone is welcome, it's a big party, and you'd better be there, instead of moping at home like a sad sack.
"You know? Then why was Sam all alone when I got home? It's like you don't even think!"
“Check his pulse!"
Keys jingled in the lock.
I tentatively touched his neck. No beating in his veins, no steady thumping, no pulse, no brother.
"Avez-vous bien dormi, mon amour?" He nipped slightly and I winced and rubbed a bruise on my neck.
"That's almost as bad as mine." I sat back onto the bed.
He groaned and turned over, nuzzling into my chest.
I walked down the street for a while, stressing over that, but eventually daydreaming about Cas. Then I paused across the street from my house. My Dad's black Impala was parked outside, which meant Dad was home early. And I was supposed to watch Sammy. Son of a bitch.
I felt that bad feeling in my stomach again and walked into the kitchen.
Sam scrambled to regain control of the car, and I shut my eyes as I heard a loud scraping and screeching. I opened them just as Sam lost control for good, and the car slammed into the concrete pillar supporting the highway.
"I understand, Dean. People like you and I, we're from different groups. We just don't mix, and that's the way of things."
I lost my balance slightly, and the man in the coat caught me.
"I know-"
"Why am I going on the floor? I'm a bit tall for that."
"Nurse Cas is taking the night shift too?"
I kicked a rock down the sidewalk, lost in my own thoughts. We always stayed at the library until they kicked us out, then I'd say goodbye to Cas. I called him that now. I don't think he's ever had a nickname before. He's pretty different, and I like that about him. He's got something about him, that I just can't put a finger on.
"Sam's dead." She whispered.
She broke away from a conversation with Gilda when the man tapped her on the shoulder, carrying me, red-faced, sweaty and drunk.
"You... You're disgusting. I will not have a- a- a
"What? I do fine when it comes to pickup lines."
"J'aime quand tu gémis comme ça." He purred and grinned. "Je vais embrasser chaque tache de rousseur sur votre visage"
I hung with the hunters, and we fixed cars together, but it wasn't the same. A depressed gloom hung around the shop, and Gabriel had just stopped coming altogether. Benny seems like I betrayed him because I didn't tell him earlier. Sam hardly talks, and it occurred to me that this is the only time he's ever seen someone die. He doesn't remember Mom at all. Kevin still visits the shop, but less often. He and Charlie don't ever bicker like they used to, and Garth seems so much less lively, and Jo seems tired all the time. We've all been weighed down by Cas' death. The hunters were falling apart.
"You hardly know me, and you worry like an overbearing mother. You've known yourself your entire life- if that makes any sense. You care about a stranger more than yourself."
I picked him up by the armpits and shook him a bit until he woke up
"Cas! What happened?"
I huffed and crossed my arms, but truthfully, I hadn't been treated like this in a long time, and I didn't really mind.
This was not a room for restraint.
“Who are these people?” Cas asked by way of response.
Something very cold was pressed against Dean’s lips.  “Open and receive.”  Dean allowed a medium-sized piece of ice to slide into his mouth.  “Suck it.  Do not chew.  Do not choke.  Use your tongue to work the sharp edges off, and then give it back to me.  Work quickly.”
Dean didn’t blink at the swift change of topic.  He hummed his own agreement at the developing plan.  He turned his back to Castiel and lifted his top leg to let Cas slot his morning wood tight between his thighs.
Love and wolf kisses.  Hug your forever pack, whoever they are.
Not here.
Michael looked from Castiel to Dean and back again. “I don’t think so, but if it’s all the same, and if the Omega gets any kind of a vote, I’m okay with it. I kind of want to know. I’ll take a little extra prodding if it helps me understand.”
Michael climaxed hard, pushing outward with all of his intention. The blonde wolf looked up, her ears pricking forward, and he locked eyes with her, his body exploding in sensation that raced down every vein and capillary, along every nerve, through every sinew until his vision whited out.
Dean gazed deeply into his eyes.  There was nothing in Michael’s emotions that backed up that request.  “It won’t work for long, Omega.  If this thing you’re feeling is more than just a passing infatuation, it’s not going to be denied.”
Michael cracked the bonds back open and kept his grave pace down the endless aisle. Dean grabbed it and pulled, ready to lay into his mate in fury. He froze mid-breath and nearly trembled under the weight of what Michael threw at him.
“No, belay that!” Charlie broke in.  She looked at Bobby apologetically but didn’t back down.  “We tried it your way last time,” she reminded him, then turned and spoke into the phone.  “Cheryl, do you have a beta-Sub on staff?”
“Fuck you, Dean.  You’re toying with me.  I don’t have a lick of patience for being played.”
“Neither do I, as it happens,” Maureen informed him.  “I sent him away today.  April’s not in much better shape than you are.  No one’s going to get any work done around here today, not like this.  He and that adorable ape tutor of hers are down at the guest house in the woods out there.  They’re going to spend the day putting together a long term curriculum with career goals and what-all.  God help the child if Nicholas Maraby is planning her future, but it got them out of the house.”
Dean had a hand to his ear as Michael droned on in a monotone.  He paced the length of the foyer.  The scent he’d pulled Michael from was working its way up the stairs.  Fred bustled by and flipped the vent switch at the top of the stairway.  Tony trotted right behind him.
Cas could see Sam working on it.
Cas laughed, wide and happy.
Sam leaned forward across his desk. “He’s Dominant. I get it. Okay? I get it. But he’s still Omega. You need to put your foot down now and then, or he’s going to walk all over you.”  Sam watched Dean kick lightly at his umbrella stand, watching something at the bottom shift. “What are you looking for?” he asked, impatient and irritated.
“I don’t deserve to be here,” he said aggressively.  “I didn’t do anything wrong.  Where do I go to get a review of this sentence?  I wanna talk to whoever’s in charge.  You’re not touching me, beta!”
A hand in the middle of the pack shot up stridently.
Dean turned to face April. She peeked up at him again. He raised his eyebrows. She licked her lips. Behind Dean, Sam and Jess climbed back onto the coach with the twins. Dean grabbed hold of the overhead rack and leaned out of the walkway to let them pass. It brought him closer to April, and she leaned further away.
“Please!”
“Done,” said Cas, laying his palms on the table and pushing his chair backward.
“Bullshit,” scoffed Dean.  “No one’s gonna challenge you.”
“Max, we’ve been advertising for professionals like you for months and have been baffled that there’s virtually no response at all. Perhaps you can explain your fears. Yours and the others’? What kind of a trap could this possibly be? You’re a professional, and you’re good at what you do. No one’s judging you unfairly. Don’t you long to turn tricks in a safe space? Safe from disease, from assault, from unwanted pregnancy, from legal entanglements? Wouldn’t you love to let go of the synthetic Heat-simulating drugs and give your body a rest? Explain it to me. What are you all so afraid of that living hand to mouth and watching your mother’s health fail is better?”
only himself.  He was sent away to Scotland to boarding school for a number of years, and I believe that broke him even further from feeling connected to this community.  It was a shame.  He was so very lonely.
She flicked her eyes to his and then looked away swiftly and nodded.  “I know.”
No one buys it but gearheads.  Except this one’s going to be marketed wider, and that means they’re hoping that splashing
“Do you ever go overboard when you’re Topping your mate?” Cas asked abruptly.
April sat up to match him, still not looking at him, and no longer touching him.  She played with the fine fabric of the soft sheet at her waist.
Michael chuckled, unconcerned at her bizarre state of mind. He kissed her cheek and patted her shoulder. “He looks more like his Daddy than me,” he said. “He’s got my hair, but the rest of him is Dean.”
Castiel kept some space between them. Any wrong move right now would be disastrous. “I know, Dean. I know. I’m proud of you for deciding like this. How can I help? How can WE help?” He quickly amended to include Michael.
She squeezed his hand.
“No, I think where we’re most likely to strike gold is his income tax records. Turns out – not that I know any of this officially since that would be against Federal law – turns out he’s got an income stream that he’s never accounted for. Might be something that a direct audit could wiggle down to the bottom of, and it might be something he’s not going to want unearthed. It’s too bad that audits are mostly random unless there’s probable cause. It’s too bad no one’s dug up probable cause.”  Bobby made his voice light and innocent.
Was Cas under the impression that having married Dean, he’d no longer need to express impulses from his brat?
“When he Presented, and he was alpha, they brought him home to private tutors for the remainder of his pre-college schooling.  Where he’d been, in Scotland, had been amenable to Lupins.  Scotland is perhaps the best example of an integrated social climate.  He was never ostracized there, but once he Presented, his mother wanted him home where she could guide him.  Being an alpha is no easy matter.  And being an adolescent alpha has to be hellish.  As if being adolescent isn’t hard enough, imagine having impulses to mount and to mate that are nearly unbearable to fight.  The only outlet for many young alphas is to turn to violence as a way to funnel some of the energy out.  That wasn’t an option for Zachariah, so he turned to incessant masturbation.”
He had been in this new world for two weeks, but he already felt like these people were his family. At the very least, he had a responsibility to protect them and keep them alive. But as they snuck through the forest silently toward the cluster of monsters that lay ahead, he worried that he would have little control over anything.
Shaking everything off, Dean split down the stairs and ran directly into Mia at the bottom.
Lucifer had not warned him that the base was an entire school building, and he half wanted to slap him.
“Dean Winchester, you listen to me-”
Jody laughed at that, but her words continued to be sincere. "It's a good thing, Castiel. It means that you will respect that he doesn't want to talk about something, even though you want to know. It's because you don't want to hurt him, anymore than all of the things in his life already do. Because let's face it, you couldn't have possibly picked anyone more complicated to like," she teased lightheartedly.
Lucifer was powerful. Perhaps the most powerful being left in the world, now that Chuck was severely limited. He could snap his fingers and this would all be over.
“Raphael, what are you doing in Hell?!” Dean demanded, concerned more than angry.
Dean almost decided not to protest at all, he really was exhausted, and the stairs really hadn't been comfortable but curled into Cas' arms as the angel carried him with ease and no shame, it was almost too convenient to pass up. It was more than comfortable; it was comforting.
"Yeah, well, Luc did me this favor. Figured if I had to keep those years a secret, my gray hair and caveman beard would have to go."
"You expected me to tell Cas how I felt right away. But I couldn't. And you were right, you did devote six years to our deal, and I can't manage to do one simple thing. But I think that today may have shown you that…"
Lucifer was hurt, but only more confused at the clarity with which the stranger said that insult to him. Everything he had been saying, however truthful it was to him, was clouded by his slight deliria. But that line, it was said with no shortage of awareness and lucidity.
Okay so Max wasn't TECHNICALLY in the chapter, but I think it counts because I finally revealed what happened, so don't you worry about our boy :)
"Well, you've got me there!"
Dean didn't answer, he didn't want what he heard to be correct. Because that voice, while familiar, was not Scottish, and definitely not Rowena.
“For a guy that stiff, he certainly attracts these women,” said the visage of Lucifer, as a static line rippled through the screen. This video had clearly not survived the best, maybe from the car accident or maybe not, but either way it looked and sounded like a fifteen-year-old VHS home video.
Though the base was more on lockdown in that fourth year than it had been for the first three, they did manage to make some progress. Lucifer could not seek out angels that may have been loyal to Michael for fear of drawing attention from Ruth. Still, he did manage to find a few tablets written by Michael, which Kevin attempted to read, but having not practiced his prophet abilities for years, it took a while to translate.
She shook her head, anxiously. "I… um… I don't know who Ruth is. My name is Amelia Mills. That man is Dean Winchester, and can you please let him go? We don't… we don't mean you any harm."
But oh, to pick that angel’s brain at the moment.
"Promise me that you're not going to get hurt when we're not there with you," Cas said honestly.
"I just wanted what you had!" She cried out, unable to turn around and face him but rightfully assuming he made sure he was alone so she could speak freely. "I just wanted my mom!"
"I called Luc," Dean supplied awkwardly. "We sort of had to explain what was going on, and he really didn't like that I was lying to you guys. Somehow Mia convinced him to keep my secret, but I still don't know how."
"You're up rather early this morning, Kevin." Lucifer nodded to him as he handed him a steaming mug of coffee and sat next to him, legs also dangling over the edge of the building like Lucifer's own.
"The stores are always empty! Ravaged, practically. This whole ordeal has been going on for years now; there's not exactly a running economy anywhere anymore." Lucifer messed with the rim of his own cup idly. "I'm not sure how many people are still alive."
"Right…" Dean responded, deciding to just dive back into the story. "Well, I met Kevin at this base of Luc's. Then I met Jody and… Mia." He awkwardly decided not to include Sean in there. He would tell them all everything in due time, but bringing up Sean now almost felt cruel considering Sean had little to do with the story besides being Dean's friend.
Max suddenly really liked this girl. "I know how that is," he admitted.
"It's okay!" Lucifer rushed to soothe the man beside him. "I can fix it!"
"What do you mean?" Lucifer asked, caught off guard by Dean's left-field query.
"You know that it's not your fault, right?" Sam finally spoke after a few minutes of silence had passed between them.
Suddenly, a shadow behind him moved, and Michael stepped out, switchblade in hand.
"The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg represent the eyes of God looking down on the American wasteland of society. That wasteland is the valley of ashes. The valley shows the moral and social decline of society when people like the Buchanan's or Gatsby pursue wealth without thinking of the consequences." He explained while we sat at my kitchen table, carefully positioned by me so he was constantly on my left side, and wouldn't see the mark.
At school, I'd move through classes in a daze. Afterward, I would go to the library out of habit, and just sit. I didn't feel like reading, because what's the point? I wouldn't understand it anyway. I just would put my head on the table for a while and pretend like I had fallen asleep a month ago, and this was all some horrible dream. Then the librarian would wake me up with a stern look and I'd run home and Sammy and I could live like we used to. I'd wake up and wonder where I could think up such a terrible and strange dream. But I would lift my head, and it would still be May, Cas would still be dead, and I'd just want to cry like a friggin baby.
” He gestured to me like I was some stain to clean, or a strange bug to squash. “Like you, live under my roof."
We pulled over other the side of the road and grabbed a couple of blankets.
Suddenly, the front door swung open, and my father staggered into the kitchen, slightly drunk. He dropped a bottle on the floor with a shatter, and the sweet honey smell was overpowered by the stench of cheap beer.
"He's only fourteen, dear god, he can't be dead! Don't be dead Sammy, I can't lose you too." I dragged him back, Jo and Benny met me halfway across the track and carried him away.
something. You said something about teaching me French."
"He was broken. We have to fix the problem or remove the broken part entirely." He stared down at his brother's body with a cold look of indifference and almost disgust.
I hurled a large dish at the cabinet and watched it shatter, with a chaotic mix of sadness, anger and relief, "I DON'T CARE! I JUST DON'T GIVE A FUCK!"
"Nah, s'okay. M'friend Charlie can walk with me. She's the redhead." He carried me around to every red-haired girl in the bar until we found Charlie.
Dean draws a picture. but symbolismmmmm
"Things about pretty eyes and nice legs."
"Please just don't. I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna think about it, all I wanna do is be with you." I turned to face him and saw his expression change from hurt to something new. He leaned forward and put a hand on my knee. For a second, I was putty in his hands, and I leaned forward too. but then I caught myself and pulled back. You can't be with him, Cas is your unattainable green light. His face went to an even more hurt expression.
“Well shit, what do we do?” Jo put her hands on her hips and frowned.
"Wow. What'd you say?"
"He's de-"
"He's dead."
I don't blame you for hating me. I wrote this, and now I hate me.
i take the fun out of funeral
"Yessir," I looked at the floor.
I didn't make it in time. A flash of silver winked at me maliciously in the streetlight and Cas crumpled.
"No- you're wrong. He's not dead, he can't be, check his pulse again!"
His face was purplish red with anger an a vein popped from his temple.
Charlie kneeled by my brother, fingers on his limp wrist. "Dean... he's gone."
He slunk away, rubbing his arm. The girls in the gang were less like girls we dated, and more like sisters. Jo was tough and Charlie was independent and, as she put it "flamingly liberal." Which lead to a lot of talk about the girls liking girls. They didn't really mind the talk, but we made sure they didn't talk shit about them.
"No Cas, I really like you, I do, I just gotta be at home to watch my brother." It still sounded like a rejection! "I um, still need help. With the other symbols in the book. Like the eyes!" Stop trying to fool yourself, you can't be with him, he's your green light. "We could go over that at my place. If you want, I guess."
I rounded the corner at a strolling pace, taking in the city of Paris in all its glory, rainy and picturesque, as it should be. I paused at a newsstand to glance at the papers. Moving down the street, I stared at cafés on the street and pharmacists' signs. I stopped at a café and got a seat outside, under the awning.
I grabbed at his shirt, now darkening with a stain of crimson death.
I felt a shiver throughout my body and stepped away from Sam. This was too much.
"No buts. You're a disgrace. A blemish to our family name. Just look at yourself. Your hair, your clothes, what you do- you're lucky I even give you a pot to piss in! Imagine- if your mother could see you-"
"Kevin, you're small, so you and Samsquatch get to be our secret passengers." Gabriel passed them back.
Garth stepped over the back of the chairs noisily and plopped into the seat on the other side of me. "What's buzzin' cuzzin'?"
"Yahtzee. Saves money." I said.
It seemed, at that moment, that if the world could cease to spin, I wouldn't have noticed a thing. We lived in our own world for that day, without a care of anything further than the light filtering through the windows. Some days, when the afternoons are particularly slow, and silence rings throughout the apartment, I let my mind slip off to that little world of our own. Just me, Cas and the sunset over Paris.
"Need a light?" I asked, pulling out my silver lighter.
"No feet on the seats, dig it?" Gabriel turned around like a mom reprimanding unruly children in the car.
"Dean? Dean are you alright?" A familiar voice soothed my anxieties.
I picked up a bowl and threw it at the wall. "Take my food-"
"Cas I'm sorry they did this to you." I wiped at the paint, smearing it on the tissue I brought. I shoved the red-stained paper into my pocket. "That's a bit better, huh? Sorry, we're giving you such a shabby funeral, it's just that we're not exactly the class vote for 'best couple' or anything."
"It's okay Cas, you're okay." I hugged him closer and he sniffled into the shirt.
"The hell's that supposed to mean?"
"Even educated fleas do it."
Another plate- "Take my clothes-"
"Dean! Oh I was so worried, you stayed and studied longer than usual and Dad came home early and I was worried a soc jumped you and you were dead or something awful happened!" He blabbered at lightning speed.
Yes, It can get worse!
"So what is the symbolism of the green light?"
The sirens blared, but they couldn't help Sam. Lights were flashing everywhere, like when the police car pulled up after Cas was dead. They were too late to save him.
I closed my eyes and lost myself in thought. The bed dipped down as Cas sat beside me.
"Charlie, just check his fucking pulse again!" I screamed at her.
"Will he make it?"
I looked up quickly and touched his shoulder. "Wait, Cas, no I uh-"
I touched my face and shook off the pain. Winchester men don't cry. What kinda fuckin' man am I? Hardly 16 and crushing on another guy. I'm no man. I crumpled to the floor and felt a kick to my side.
"Hey, Cas."
"Fiiine." he mock-pouted.
All of a sudden, one of the Garrison came up to Charlie. It was Alfie.
Shouts, whispers, and giggles of names I've been called swirled around my head, jumbled and distorted by the pain in my stomach. I felt like puking.
"Yeah, we dig." The car chorused, and Charlie put her feet on the floor again.
"I don't know, I care about people!"
"Je rêve de tremper ma baguette dans ta soupe."
"You're worried I'll get a cold and die from being splashed with water, but binge-drink at parties without a thought of yourself."
We cheered for Sam as loud as we could, while the Garrison cheered for Luke.
"I said, you might not want to order another. You're very drunk, and it's late."
He sat down on the bench by the side of the street.
So we decided to have a drag race against the socs, to see if that brings us back together a bit. We fixed up an old car, painting it black with flames on the back.
because we're fanfic writers and life is a fucking nightmare
"You worry too much about others, but not enough about yourself." He said thoughtfully.
I felt pitying looks all around me. I lost Cas, I lost Sam, and they all give you that look. I sat down on the side of the track and put my head between my knees. He'll be fine, he'll be okay, if I just keep telling myself that he'll be okay, he'll be-
“Do you want to talk about it?” Kali asked cautiously. Gabe shook his head silently, sadly.
“No.”
Michael hadn’t moved much, but he flicked his eyes up and caught Dean’s.  “You don’t know everything she’s hiding.  She’s Castiel’s True-Mate for a reason.  There’s way more to her than you guys expect.  She’s terrified that he’ll think her primary designation is too big for an Ozzie to handle, and he’ll find a way to shut it down.  You guys freaked out about
“W’t time zit?”
“Right, Samuel?!”
“Expect it to hurt a bit, love, but yes, purely play.”
He thought he did, so he nodded, but he needed more.  He still didn’t know where this was going, and he was entirely spent.  It wasn’t a new argument.  Castiel’s research touched on the disconnect between mates at opposite sides of the spectrum, but it felt unexpectedly wretched in real life.  He was aghast at the thought of being incapable of supplying all of her needs for intimacy and camaraderie.
you to trust me and do as you’re
He set the belt on the chair beside her hands and leaned down over her limp body so he could whisper in her ear. “I love you, sweetheart. You’re all done now.”  He rubbed very lightly over her backside. “You did great. You know how this works. You’re square with me and Michael both, and we aren’t going to hold it over you. Let it go, kiddo. Let it go. C’mere.”  He pulled her up to standing and turned her to face him, stooping to carefully get her underwear back into place as her skirt covered her again. He rubbed her back and petted her hair, kissing her temple again and again.
ourselves!”
“Ouch, Michael. I’m crushed,” Charlie joked. “And besides, ringing the bell would have woken the sleeping terrors in the nursery. You said you wanted them napping as long as possible. Holy fuck, Christmas exploded in here!”
“Me?”
“Sorry, Sir. I’m not myself right now. Give me a minute. Please.”
She scoffed rudely.  “You think they don’t know?” she asked him.  “Your whole room reeks, and need I remind you it’s Dean’s room too?  He knows, Sam.  They both do.  You’re making a big deal out of nothing.”
“Jesus, that’s hot,” Cas whispered.
“I want you down in a plank position, Pet. Up on your toes and elbows. Clasp your hands together. Keep your body flat. Hold position until I release you.”
He found waning traces of residual fear, fading rapidly even as he watched. He found a worrisome knot of front-brain shame, enough that he would need to address it later. He found determination and pride inside her wolf and an echoing wallowing afterglow in her Omega. He didn’t find any weakening in their connection, any resentment, any distrust. She had taken him as a wolf, it seemed. That would have buffered her psyche.
“What’s to be insecure about?” Dean wondered.  “Everybody’s got health concerns.  Nobody else is hiding them.  Hell, Gabe and Kali are upfront about having a hell of a time getting pregnant.  It sucks, and it hurts, but it’s not shameful.  It’s not hidden.  How can the Pack lend support if no one knows there’s an issue?”
He extended his hand formally. “Pop.”
This time, he was torn up emotionally over the death of his father, he had no recourse to relieve the pressure of the building backlog in a pair of testes that were much more accustomed to a very different flow pattern, and he wasn’t going to find release in a powerfully swollen backside. What’s more, Dean could feel the itch of impending Rut making him short-tempered. It was a perfect storm of epic proportions to turn Dean into a major league pain-in-the-ass to those around him. Castiel’s stern blue-eyed gaze floated at the back of Dean’s mind, admonishing that right now was the perfect opportunity to give his alpha a real challenge to overcome; give it a chance to learn how to hold its ground when the chips were down.
“Can we Papa? Please?”
“Are you hurt?” Cas asked Sam. He stepped up and peered into Sam’s left eye, touching the swelling at his cheek carefully.
Sarah’s control slipped.  She’d been putting out a terrified and judgmental scent since the party, and Sam knew she needed to vent.  “Not a threat to anyone?  How can you say that with a straight face?!  I
Dean wormed closer until his head tucked in close below Castiel’s chin.  Cas tightened his embrace.
going to replace you. I am
“Knock it off, Winchester. Everybody fucks up. You get punished for it yet?”  She scratched at his scalp gently.
Cas laughed easily.  “I think we can trust one another without involving our pinkies.  I’m grateful to you, Michael.  None of this has been easy for you, and you’ve adjusted beautifully.  You are good for April.  You’re good for all of us, but I’ve grown to rely on you to keep an eye on her, and I need you to know that I value what you have to offer her.  Go on in and let Dean have his say about your study habits.  You and I can work on physiology tomorrow.  I’ve got Dean tonight, so you can expect both of us to sleep late in the morning.  Do you want me to take Alex?  Smells like he needs a diaper change.”
Naomi didn’t reply. She turned her face away and appeared to be settling in for a nap, cool as you please. (They really are just alike,) Pam’s wolf noted. Pam almost laughed but caught herself. She walked around to the far side, pulled the soft chair Gabe had been sitting in right up beside the bed and sat down.
“Pie, miss?” asked Fred at her elbow.
“She said she knew Dad when she was a pup, and they were friends—dated even. She made it sound like she was nearly
Sarah watched the door click softly shut behind him.  “If he didn’t break one of the rules, what basis are you going to use to punish him?”
to me, you mean,” Kate shot back through clenched teeth.
“What does a Neutral know about this stuff, anyway?” he grumbled.  Her Keller had come back a supreme disappointment, and she was still processing the midline readings.
“Did you stay up, talking?”
“That’s good.  I guess.”  The Alpha took a drag from his cigarette.  In the light, Castiel caught a glimpse of his drawn face.  The Alpha leaned against his tree and kept his gaze toward the hospital building where his son’s new bond was pulling him away from his father.
There's plot coming soon.  I swear.
Michael turned to walk backward toward the corner around which the gold tape disappeared. “And make me proud, alpha,” he goaded. “Show me that storied Winchester stamina isn’t a myth.”
“Shhh, go to sleep, Kathleen. Papa won’t be far.”
Kaia drank in every word, thirsty in a way she’d never experienced before. “Claire,” she whispered.
“On the bed, then.  All fours.”  Dean popped up and nearly took his Dom out in his hurry, and Cas had to close his eyes again and grit his teeth to keep himself from laughing outright at the puppylike enthusiasm.  It never got old.  Cas took a deep breath and then slowly unwound the leash from his tight grip, letting his wolf bound forward to tackle Dean’s in playful mirth.  They’d obviously missed each other.  Cas sucked at Dean’s shoulders and ran his hands all over the man’s body.  Everywhere except where he’d promised not to.
“Is that all?” asked Cas, kindly.
“I liked it,” she admitted.  “It felt good to be pursued.”
“She’s sick in the head, babe.  She won’t have any idea what you two are going on about.  Just…just feed her breakfast and send her away.”  Dean rolled over a little to let Cas strip the bed around him, but he didn’t get up to help.  They’d done this many times before.  Dean knew to stay passively horizontal.  Cas was a master at changing bedsheets with an occupant in the bed.  “Cas, I’m sorry, but your mom is gone.  There’s nothing left but bitterness and denial.  It’s like my dad.  Whatever used to be there is gone.  We can’t fix it no matter how hard we try.”
“We’re late showing up this morning to see if we can get them too flustered to follow through with all the pre-start checks,” Dean told him calmly. “I’m escorting you past Becky to distract her from getting a spit and urine sample. I’ll tell her we arranged to do it with Charlie, and I’ll tell Charlie that Becky grabbed it. I’m taking that one on myself. You don’t know any better, you hear me?” Dean’s ass twitched in premonition. There was going to be hell to pay off the flesh of his backside once it all shook out, but he’d known that all along. He had to protect Becky and Charlie as well as he could. He needed a strong story.
Castiel glanced down the table where Gabriel sat opposite Michael. Gabe smirked cheekily at him. Gabe asked, “You thought Friday dinners were going to be like Father’s big Sunday meals back in the day? All of us sitting with good posture and impeccable manners? All, ‘Yes, Alpha’ and ‘No, Alpha’ while you laid out the agenda however you saw fit? Look around you, little brother. Is that who we are?”
“Why does my success as a musician matter so much to you?” asked April in genuine dismay.
Cas sat up and looked at her steadily.
“Are you coming?”  Castiel’s face still looked mortified, but his mother laughed.
“Do you have any questions or concerns?  You may speak freely.”
“Come in, April.”  Castiel patted the bed beside him as Dean sat up and scooted out of the way.  “Have you finished practicing for the night?”
“No pets,” stated Dean, slamming the trunk closed and handing Michael his bags. “Unless you count Sammy.”
A year’s supply of Guinness might make up for however many hours he had to spend in Crowley’s company.
“Jesus, Rache, she just gave birth to triplets.  Give her a second to breathe.”
The large wolf growled at him and bit his shoulder hard enough to hurt.  Challenge accepted.  Dean flinched but didn’t cry out.  Castiel disappeared from above him and another shudder went through the Sub at the loss of his warmth.
Dean killed the engine and put both hands on the wheel, closing his eyes for a minute. When he opened them, he found April perched on the edge of the back seat watching him seriously. “What’d I do wrong?” he asked her. She simply shrugged judgmentally and got out of the car slamming doors as she went as well. “Oh, now you’re mad at me too?!” he called to her retreating back. Great. Well, at least she had a legitimate reason.
Michael threw an arm across his face in embarrassment, but Cas just chuckled at his discomfort and kissed his throat.  April brought a warm wash cloth over and knelt to wipe them both off.  Michael allowed the contact, suffering her touch with more acceptance than he had been capable of prior to the Claim.  It felt nice – not sexual, but nice.
“yessir.”
complaining.” Cole had almost broken in with a whiny complaint but thought better of it and stayed quiet, pulling his pants back into place. Benny let him go, shaking his head.
“Very good.  You’re forgiven.  I’m aware that we had a degree of blurriness about the starting point of this scene, but Dean,
The room went nuts. Papers literally flew into the air in the rush of bodies to reach him and shake his hand or hug him. The feeling of relief was palpable, like when the news of a ceasefire finally makes it to the front lines, and everyone can stand down within the euphoria of having survived. Sam, however, waited for the crowd to thin. He worked his way to Castiel, his face carved from stone, immune to the celebratory atmosphere. Castiel braced himself. He wasn’t going to back down no matter what Sam had to say, so he faced the beta-Dom directly, making no move to posture. Castiel respected Sam a great deal and prayed they could soon be brothers. He owed it to Sam to face him now as a man, not an Alpha.
“You’re sex on legs, Winchester,” Michael told him through clenched teeth. “You make me come in my sleep just from having your scent beside me.” Somehow, Michael was holding onto himself even as Dean lost it. The alpha’s head strained back as far as he could get it. His thighs burned with the forcefulness of his driving heat. Dean’s knot strained to enter his mate and lock them together.
“Wait.  Sir, please.  It’s my fault he’s acting like this.  You put his balance in my hands, and I’m not keeping him there.  It’s my fault.  Punish me, not him.  I’ll do better, Alpha.  I promise.”  Michael entreated Cas with wide green imploring eyes.
Michael unstacked a chair and sat with a grunt. “Come here, Submissive.”  Dean’s dick twitched at the tone. He turned to face the sink and breathe, sipping water. April struggled to her feet and shuffled to him. She’d thought that she had the measure of Michael and that when the time came, he would prove incapable of laying into her, but he looked pretty serious at the moment.
“I thought you’d moved past this kind of thing, babe.  Is it just too many people?  What do you need right now?”
“The imagery of a ‘sphere of instinct’ is an apt idea, Cas,” Benny agreed.  “Some people, mostly folks like you, way out of the edges, have reported feeling like they can draw information up from a much deeper well if they try.  What they’ve described is the sensation that while their normal daily activities might be supported by a surface level touch, the same level as the sense we all have of our own wolves, an extra push when they need more gives them a much richer view.
“A little.” Then Michael blanched and straightened as Ellen and Pam walked in together, followed by Joshua and Hannah. Ellen had a thick stack of paper in her hands. Dean squeezed his hand. Castiel’s hand found its way to grip his neck.
He talked it over with Dean and Castiel on Monday night before dinner, ignoring the drunken giggles out of the parlor from the unwelcome gaggle of women in his house. Dean reminded Michael that teachers of Omega studies often held a Claim on their students because it created a constructive bond that allowed them to communicate beneath the surface. Michael refused to consider allowing that, and Dean frowned, but he didn’t press it. Castiel asked Michael to give it a week or two and try to find a way to work with Hannah.
“I love you, Kitten.” He let the bond reflect the words, and his hands roamed her body. She was quiet and still, and that wasn’t like his Ozzie. He needed a new tack.
This chapter is the result of one of those virtual nonstop typing-fests that makes my family worry.  Fear not, dear ones, this IS my self-care, and yes, I'm hydrated.  :P
“Hold onto your fucking hat, Dean,” Michael told him. “You thought I was turned on before… You ain’t seen nothing yet.”
Chapter warning for violent intent and a frightening physical assault.  No physical harm, but real intent.
“Start with the skeevy clubs in Kansas City, if you can stand to let her do that,” Matt told him, following April over, but obviously having overheard the conversation.  “You don’t want her recognized yet, and she’ll be playing for audiences who know what they want.  It lets her sharpen her claws in a place where all they care about is the music, and they won’t let her get away with a poor performance.”
***************
Michael raised a knowing brow at her in challenge.  He resented her implication that she knew Dean’s deepest insecurities better than his mate did.
“Not entirely, but in the next five years I’ll be spending way less time away from the house.  There’s no other way – not if you and Cas are going to fill the place with rugrats enough to satisfy your itches.  One kid is not going to stop the burn, Michael.”  He held the door open and took his mate’s hand as they headed back toward campus.  “…Not for either of you.”
Though he could be acting completely insane and paranoid, he didn't want to take that chance. He knew that if Max knew something, he would want them to know.
"Luc? Hey, welcome back," he noted with relief as Lucifer seemed to acknowledge his presence.
“Dean, what happened to Raphael?!” Kevin panted out, hating the fact that they were running for their lives on a spiral staircase of all things.
Dean nodded, understanding what Kevin meant by all of this. "You want me to approach her alone."
Neither knew what to say, so Dean decided to just keep going. "Yes. Yes, Cas, I meant it how I said it. Honestly, I was thinking of every excuse on my way over here today. I thought about saying that I meant I love you as my friend, or that I love you like a brother, but that's not how I feel.
Sam and Cas started on the small talk with Jody, asking about Alex and Claire, talking about the dinner she was hoping to make for Sam to devour; it was all lovely and civil and domestic.
He pried up a loose board from the floor underneath where the bed had initially covered, and there was a hidden, shallow compartment. There were already some things in there that Luc could see, certain photos and papers with scribblings on them, but on the top, clearly most recently put in there as it was least affected by dust, was the familiar polaroid picture taken at the party, the photo of Dean, Sam, and Cas popping champagne that Dean had carried around with him in his pocket for the last six years. Lucifer was almost surprised, realizing that Dean had finally removed it from his pocket and hidden it there.
"Oh?"
"So you admit you killed him!"
"You're dead," the man mumbled. It was harsh and violent, and Lucifer was sure that he needed to heal this man as quickly as possible.
Cas kissed Dean's forehead. "It wasn't a sacrifice, Dean. Ever since I met you, I had no doubts about being with you." The angel looked at him, his face falling ever so slightly. "I just wish I could have saved you from those years you spent away from us."
Sean and Raphael smiled at them as they got up to leave them to their planning. Lucifer, Mia, and Kevin turned to Dean expectantly, waiting for what he would say.
"What do you mean?"
Dean snorted. "The Kevin I know would never say that." He cleared his throat, finally dragging his attention away from his beloved Impala. "Alright, well, one of you is going to need to be my alibi for where I've been, which means one of you has to be with me when I see Sam and Cas again."
He didn't want to do this without them again. Especially Cas, after how genuinely accepting the angel had been. Sam had just stopped suspecting Dean at all, perhaps that was easier, just pretending that Dean wasn't being suspicious and filling in the blanks with long stretches and lapses in judgement. But Cas, he didn't stop thinking, knowing that Dean was lying, but he decided to let Dean continue the lie, so long as he promised not to get hurt when he happened to be without Cas and Sam.
“Oh Dean, this is too important. You have the last ingredient, so use it!” She pushed the key ring away. “Gabriel’s key is the long black one with the jagged bit. Lock away Chuck, and then maybe you can come back for your dear Auntie Rowena, okay?”
Lucifer stepped in front of Dean protectively even though he wasn’t in any danger. “You’re done, Chuck,” Lucifer said, staring him down. “Your little reign of terror is over. You lose.”
He was dead. Right?
"Well, I didn't tell him everything!"
Liking him more than he liked himself, so much so that he would happily be tortured for the rest of eternity if it meant knowing that Dean was safe.
Dean glanced back at Lucifer, who just shrugged and folded his arms. The hunter pursed his lips as he turned back to the witch. "Well, what do you remember?"
Lucifer could barely put his hands up in submission and start saying "Raph-" before the other angel had enveloped him in a hug.
Lucifer nodded, stroking his chin and looking off distantly. "I don't like it, Dean. It's the kind of calm before the storm I don't trust."
“I’ve let you down,” Dean repeated his thoughts, his voice cracking. “And I shouldn’t have taken you for granted. And I should have told you before, I should have told you the second I got back, but…” he was choking on his own words.
“Can’t it be both?” Lucifer asked, a little dryly for the intensity of the situation.
“Well, it was hard to understand what he was saying, need I remind you of the telling noises emitted from the call, implying there had been some sort of accident?”
Meanwhile, a very determined witch named Max Banes broke every speed limit possible, racing to get to Sam and Castiel at the bunker.
"It's not that," Luc reassured him. "I like hunting with you, I think it's fun and important and you're my best friend, but… this isn't where I need to be."
Dean eyed the Ozzie on the rack cautiously, but he did as bid. He folded onto the floor with his back to April, and he rolled his shoulders until he found his headspace and settled.
Hours later, Cas changed her dressings, and his throat developed a hard lump as the full extent of what she’d done to herself in her desperation to rid herself of her own core self became evident. She was more than broken. Cas understood why Gabriel hadn’t phoned him. He was struggling as much with trying to reach out to Dean. His fiancé would just have to be angry. Cas couldn’t distract him with this, not with two days left to go in the convention. Dean couldn’t help in any way, and the work he was doing was critical to so many people.
Michael does things...a little differently.
“Ooh, last chance?  What happens after my last chance, bitch?  You got nowhere to run.  You got no friends but me.  You get me?  I’m your friend, man.  You and me.  These dicks all do what I tell them.  They’re not all nice guys like I am.  I can protect you.”
“What?  Done?  Uh, sure.  I guess.  I can, um, take it over from here, polish it up, get back to you…”
Happy Thanksgiving to all my friends in the U.S.  I am unbelievably thankful for all of you.  Yes, you too.
into it.  That’s fitting for your wedding and for the reception afterward, but not for this.”
“Have you anything more pressing to do?” Castiel asked with a brow raised.
“No tears,” he observed, caressing the space below her eye, and she smiled softly.
“It’s very much the same,” he commented. “It’s all about precise calculations, impossible predictions, and making no mistakes.”
Dean scrabbled for the bottle as Cas pulled a chair around with his foot and sank down onto it, pulling Dean by the hips to keep him connected.  They shared the remainder of Dean’s beer there in the chair.  Cas’ cock slipped free, and Dean made a face at the sensation of fluids dripping free and running down under his thighs into Castiel’s lap.
“Am I insane?” Cas repeated lightly. “Was that the question? Why don’t we find out? Let’s try this again. Dean, Pet, go get in your fucking starting position and try to get it right this time.”
“Oh, yeah, fuck, right.  I remember now.”
me or face the consequences! I don’t want to hear another word about it. The subject is
Dean wiped his mouth with his palm and sat upright on his knees.  “There are other alternatives,” he said.  “Most of those guys can still score a totally free hookup at a bar if the line’s too long to get in the door of the play room.  And we wouldn’t have to close it completely, just limit the hours.  We basically lose one shift.  That’s all.  And as soon as we replace the two guys who just Mated, we’re back in business.”
“Yeah, yeah,” he mumbled, pouting. It was bad enough to have everyone in earshot congratulating him on just how much of a Bottom he had admitted to being, but to have his alpha negated by his best friend…  She didn’t mean it. He knew she didn’t. Jo loved him. Dean sat down on an empty speaker crate and looked glumly around. He wished to hell Michael were here. Or Cas. What was it going to take to get Cas to one of these? They were fully ACRI-sponsored. It was as much Cas’ responsibility to be here as to be at any of those hoity-toity white wine and sherry seminar events for rich college alumnae.
She smiled a sad smile and touched his face.  “Good.  I pray every day that forcefield doesn’t weaken.”
Cas embraced his fiancé in the office doorway and kissed his lips which were turning blue with the air-conditioned house chilling his damp naked skin.  “You’re with me tonight, Dean.”  He kissed him again.  Dean let his cold body seek warmth from the strong wolf before him and kissed him back.  “And tomorrow night as well.”
“Tessa wants to try hypnosis on me,” Dean said softly into the darkness in front of his pillow.  They weren’t sleeping.  Neither of them were having any luck falling asleep after the whirlwind day of meeting the new associates and trying to figure out where to start in bringing two such different cultures together.  Legally, they still had several weeks before the two institutions became one, but they didn’t have a moment to lose, and there was so much to accomplish.  Castiel worried that Dean might crash soon if he didn’t get some rest, but there wasn’t a lot they could do that they hadn’t tried already.
Michael shifted to sit on the edge of the bed with his back to her.  “Am I grounded in my room?” he said over his shoulder.
He huffed, and her hair moved.
“Well, despite the exaggerated presentation,” Cas looked over the top of the pages with an annoyed expression, “you’ve given me everything I asked for.”  He set the report down.  “Do you have anything to add?”
“That’s rough,” agreed the old doctor much more mildly than he normally spoke. Evidently, he nursed a soft spot for Castiel’s mate. “I’m sorry.”
Cas closed the office door behind him. Dean was already bare and standing in the corner with his fingers laced behind his head. “What’s going on, Dean? I don’t smell a spiral.”
“Yeah, I can do that.  Feels like we’re finally settling down.  I don’t feel like you’re seconds away from ripping my throat out anymore.  Feels like we need a pinkie-swear or something to seal the pact.”
“Two years.  Have you and April been Mated for two years?”
“Uh-unh.  You asked for this.  You’re going to get what’s coming to you, and you’re not getting up until I’m through.”  John checked on his son surreptitiously, but Sam seemed almost bored already.  His TV program kept drawing him back in, so John let him be.  He started swatting his mate’s ass and thighs with the spoon, giving it to her hard and without pause.  She grunted and cried, yelped and moaned.  John noticed her pussy swelling and beginning to moisten.  He kept up the spanking until she started to apologize with intent, a clear indication that she had taken the correction to heart.  Then he set the spoon down in front of her face, and he unzipped his fly.
“Meg, if Triggering doesn’t clear your nostrils of Sam, moving to Nevada won’t either.  You have to find a way to let him go.”
“You know what I mean.”
“It’s not a thing YET,” Cas reminded them all.  All of the fury had flowed out of him with the fading of his red eyes.  He just felt tired.  “Don’t forget, that was the Alpha’s response to sharing you, Dean.  We haven’t seen it react to watching another man touch April yet.”
“I want to come, Sir.  Will you touch me?  Please?”  Dean rocked a little against his arms.  He couldn’t move far.  He’d settled very close to the bars of the headboard to avoid any more accidental tugs against the clamps.  The one on his right nipple felt a little off, and he was afraid it might slip off if he tugged on it again.  He wanted to be good.
“No, you don’t,” he corrected.  “Look at me.”
Dean stormed out the door, tripping over Portia on her way in. He left the door hanging ajar and thundered back into the kitchen. He flung Cas’ ill-begotten pastry into the trash and began assaulting a new lump of dough with his rolling pin. Behind him in their playpen, two of his pups began to wail, and Tony disappeared into the pantry.
“You have a number of options, and I believe you’re bright enough to recognize many of them.  I leave him to you.”
Benny answered. “Max, despite the fact that your final exam scenes look more like a PornHub upload, you passed every test with flying colors. As for your suggestions…” Benny smirked and shrugged as he glanced down at Castiel. “The preliminary sketches for an extension to this Facility are already in the works. What we lack is someone to spearhead the design and implementation of our adolescent training wing. I wonder, where do you see yourself in five years, Omega?”
Dean used the corner of the shower to support his weight.  He leaned in on his elbows and presented his ass to his Dominant.  It helped that Dean’s libido insisted on a two-person shower with separate shower heads and handholds at varying heights along that corner.  Planning ahead was key to playing safely – planning ahead and good strong wall anchors.
“Hmm.”  He reached down beside him, dredged his fingers through a mess of gravy and smeared it across his belly.  “And you just showered.  Such a shame.”
Dean re-set and tried again. “Babe, I owe you an apology and an explanation about this morning. I scared you, and I ran you through a scene without your consent. That’s a separate thing to what I’m saying about your Omega. I need to know you heard me about that. Say something.”
“So?” she prompted. “Jack and Jo? What’s up, do you think?”
Michael bore down hard, gritting his teeth and pulling his knees out wide and up.  His groan became a shout.  Dean counted slowly in his ear, and when he reached one, he reminded Michael to take a breath and rest.
