“Yeah, cheating spouses are kind of your bread and butter as a PI,” Dean agreed. “I know they can be annoying, but they pay well. And they keep the lights on while you’re waiting for the more interesting cases to come across your desk. You’re gonna make a great PI kid. And it’s cute that you wanna follow in your big brother’s footsteps.”
“That’s the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever heard!” Cas sputtered. He gave Dean a pointed look but had to admit that, despite its silliness, Dean’s easy-going banter did set him at ease.
“Uhhhhh, Cas, maybe you should-” Sam started to say, also while shooting glances at the oven, looking like he was wondering if they should evacuate the kitchen.
It took a bit of fiddling with his sketch until he was happy with it. The bold floral design popped and he couldn’t make out the symbol he was trying to obscure beneath. It was definitely better than the wonky window Piper had ended up with to cover her swastika brand on
Dean accidentally inhaled his beer and only just managed not to spit it all over Charlie’s dress. She narrowed her eyes at the near miss, which Dean thought was rich given she was the one who’d made him asphyxiate on his damn drink.
“Both, please,” Dean groaned. He was still holding his cell phone clenched in his right hand, but his left hand had started running up and down his chest without conscious thought.
baby,” Cas said. But Dean didn’t care, because despite Cas’s snark, his hand had found its way into Dean’s hair and was gently stroking through it, even as Cas’s eyes found the screen again and refused to look at him. Dean turned back to the screen too but couldn’t keep his eyes open. He drifted off to sleep feeling warm and happy.
“Petticoat,” she said, pushing her own finger into the springy fabric. “I wanted to wear the hooped underskirt for authenticity, but I thought petticoats would be more practical.” She grinned wryly. “Well, petticoats are never really
He hugged Dean tight and continued to whisper words of love and devotion while Dean gathered himself. The feeling of being comprised of scattered, disparate pieces faded gradually and Dean finally felt whole. He had a sense of completeness he’d never felt before. Like lying here with Cas was what his whole life had been leading towards. Dean felt like he was who he was meant to be now, like being with Cas made him a better version of himself.
Dean's eyes were glued to Cas’s hard dick, captivated by the sight of him stroking Dean’s spend all over his shaft. Fuck, that was hot. He kind of wanted to lick it off, suck Cas’s cock clean, taste the bitter flavour of himself mixing with the precome leaking from Cas’s cockhead. He looked up at Cas to suggest doing just that and saw that Cas’s eyes were already locked on his face. He was looking at Dean with adoration and something that Dean thought—hoped—might be close to love.
Meg got up to go to the kitchen and then detoured at the sound of a knock. Cas caught sight of her wide smile before she disappeared behind him. Not that Meg would say it, but she was clearly looking forward to going to the silly Halloween club night with her girlfriend and her best friend.
“I have three older brothers. I’m pretty sure our father only had children because he thought blood kin would be his most loyal, or perhaps just the most unquestioning, followers. He was half right. My two oldest brothers are still senior members of the Church as far as I know. I’m pretty sure Michael is a true believer. But I think Luke might be a snake in the garden, just waiting for our father to show weakness so he can swoop in and take over. Gabriel left the Church when I was a kid and never looked back.”
Talking about Dean’s job led to talking about Cas’s job, which led to talking about tattoos more. Then they discussed art, then books, then movies, then music... then they discussed positions.
natural to chat up men, to be attracted to them in the same way he was to women. He'd shrugged off that way of thinking a long time ago though. He was comfortably bisexual now.
More than that, though, he wanted to spend time with him. Cas’s body and the way he used it made Dean hope that they could have sex again, but it was Cas's personality that made him hope they could go on an actual date.
“This looks great,” he said, wrapping an arm round Cas’s waist as he stood next to him after placing a plate in front of Dean. He was entirely sincere since, despite his conflicted feelings about the turducken, it did look and smell amazing.
Dean made a noise of appreciation as he shovelled the eggs enthusiastically into his mouth and Cas grinned at him. Meg made a retching sound. Apparently, Dean and Cas were disgustingly cute anyway.
It felt so good to have Cas touch him like this again. So good. Cas gave Dean a smoldering look and bent down to his ear. His hot breath panted against Dean's neck and he gave their cocks a squeeze as whispered in a sultry voice, “Together we form a mighty faggot.”
“I might have had sex with him... but c’mon, it’s just sex. Two consenting adults scratching an itch. No big deal. I can’t believe he tattled on me. Jeez, I wouldn’t have fucked him if I’d known he was going to be such a girl about it.” Dean rolled his eyes and continued to scramble the eggs.
Despite the warning, Meg wasn’t at home when they got back to the apartment. Cas showed Dean around the modest space. There was a living room, kitchen and bathroom, as well as Cas and Meg’s bedrooms. Meg's bedroom was newly red, whereas Cas’s was a soft sky blue. The rest of the apartment was painted simple cream to reflect light and make the most of the space.
So, Castiel had only mixed with fellow Church members. If they were lucky, he and his peers might get to take part in a youth group activity that had been deemed suitably moral and boring. There was the occasional camping trip complete with the obligatory singing about God around the campfire.
Cas kissed him as soon as he shut the door behind them, his mouth hot and hard on Dean’s hesitant lips. Cas drew back slightly and looked at him. Dean was pretty sure Cas noticed the nervous energy tightening every muscle in his body.
“Well, dad was kind of an asshole. He tried to play me and Sam off of each other, kind of similar to what your dad did to you and your brothers, it sounds like. It didn’t make us hate each other, but it kind of made us hate ourselves sometimes, you know?”
he’d seen him. It had been years since his mind had played those kinds of tricks on him and it was unsettling to find out that it could still happen. He hated that it had happened again. More than that, he hated how much it had affected him. Even though nothing had actually happened, he was still struggling to shake off his unease days later.
Cas didn’t think he’d woken him, but Dean made a small noise and rolled over onto his side as well, arm going back around Cas and pulling him against his chest, either consciously or unconsciously, he wasn’t sure. Cas put his hand over Dean's where it rested on his heart and finally drifted off.
Dean shook his head as he watched Charlie and the other woman leave. He turned back to the balcony, but the man with the tattoos was gone. Dean was looking around wondering if he should try to track the guy down when he saw Jesse and Cesar waving to him from a booth at the edge of the dance floor. Dean really wanted to find Mr Tall, Dark and Smouldering, but he also hadn’t had a chance to spend much time with his friends lately. So, only a little reluctantly, he went to rejoin them and have another drink.
They didn’t have time at the moment for a proper road trip. When they next had a vacation, Dean thought he would take Cas to see the Niagara Falls. He’d like that. He could imagine Cas watching the falls with solemn appreciation and summing them up with an understated, ‘So much water, impressive’. Now though, Sam was back at the bunker researching their next case. He could spare them for the weekend but that was it. Dean thought it would be a good opportunity to introduce Cas to America’s National Pastime. Sometimes doing something special for Cas was about doing the most ordinary thing he could think of. That was how they found themselves in Baby driving east up Route 24.
“So, what are you making?” Dean said, cutting off whatever tactless thing Sam might be going to say. He’d been happy to let dinner be a surprise- he didn’t mind what Cas made, turkey, ham, hell, he’d eat a damn nut roast if Cas served it to him- but asking about the meal seemed a good way stop Sam talking.
They both sat there in awkward silence for a moment, clearly uncertain what to do after this declaration of familial affection. Then Gabriel’s usual smirk slid back into place.
He rubbed his arm and glared at her. Though, given he hadn’t even realised she’d sat down on the couch right next to him, perhaps the blow had been necessary to get his attention.
Cas stared at a patch of white wall while rubbing his forearm absently. Thoughts crowded his brain, buzzing loudly, like too many voices speaking at once, devolving into static rather than any coherent words. Meg had said something from across the room, he was reasonably sure, but whatever it was hadn’t penetrated.
Dean probably shouldn’t have taken a sip of cocoa after asking Cas to talk because his words made him choke on his drink.
He turned around and nodded in another direction, toward a cute, young guy holding court at a table of laughing friends.
“Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in,” Meg said when Cas entered his own kitchen half an hour later.
“I mean, I know I'm not the expert on peen, but that sounds wrong. What are you just gonna wear 20 of them? Just rings the whole way up your dick?”
“Amnesia though?” Dean said doubtfully. “What are we living in a freaking Mills and Boon novel? Are you going to tell me that we’re in a love triangle with a billionaire next?!”
Dean took the cocoa out and found a pan to heat the milk. He rushed around the kitchen in a cocoa-making frenzy, as if a nice hot drink was of the utmost importance and would definitely fix whatever had made Cas wake up screaming. He added sugar and marshmallows to the cocoa before offering it to Cas with a flourish.
It shouldn’t be a big deal, but it was. The only other married queer guys on TV Cas could think of were that couple on
Camping was torture. A confused Castiel had had to sleep inches away from another boy while desperately trying to hide the effect the proximity had on his hormone-addled body. He was terrified of being found out, exposed by boys who might be disgusted by him.
right there beside Cas, until he turned to see someone else. Or he’d catch a glimpse of a familiar set of shoulders on a man sauntering down the street. That was all too common early on.
“Yeah, yeah, he told me about the witch and the amnesia or whatever. But, c’mon Sam, are you seriously telling me I married a dude and that dude’s an angel?! I mean, the former sure. Maybe I’m a little surprised; just percentage-wise, with relationships, wouldn’t have figured I’d settle down with a guy.” While Dean had fucked plenty of men, maybe even more than he’d fucked women, he’d never had a relationship with one that went past a couple of casual hook-ups. It wasn’t like he’d had a lot of actual relationships with women either. It was just that if he were to settle down- which had always seemed an impossibility in itself- he’d always assumed it would be with a woman. “But whatever. An angel, though? I call bullshit. I know I did not marry one of those dicks with wings willingly!”
Dean picked up a book, just for something to do. He read about spells for a several hours while the angel just sat quietly at the kitchen table. He nearly jumped out of his skin when Cas declared abruptly, “You should have dinner.”
“Well, where are they?” Dean snapped, he’d been trying not to whine this time but he’d overcorrected and his tone veered towards aggressive.
Cas had wanted so much to transform the ugliness of his childhood into something beautiful. It could never be undone, memories were etched into his soul, words could never be unsaid, pain could never be unfelt, but perhaps it could be transmuted. The things that had hurt him could be turned into things that gave him strength.
“Look, he knows it’s not an insult,” Cas said, trying to be patient. “But he’s upset anyway. Will you apologise to him please?”
Cas pulled out and lay side by side with dean, drawing him into a warm hug. Dean was trembling slightly as Cas stroked his back. He was overwhelmed. This had felt like so much more than sex.
Cas listened as Dean opened up about his experience of his dad finding out he was queer, which sounded remarkably similar to Cas’s own. Cas was furious about what had happened to Dean in a way that he wasn’t about what had happened to him.
Dean watched Sam and Gabriel while they waited for their stupid, hippy, health food brunch to arrive. They seemed like an odd match. If he'd pictured Sam dating an older guy, it would have been some serious, silver fox lawyer, not someone like Gabriel, who might be the oldest of them but was definitely the least mature.
Cas smiled at him and rubbed his knee and Dean knew he got it. After all, he had his own annoying brother to put up with now. The thought made him grin. Sam might be a bitch sometimes, but he wouldn’t change him for anything. He was glad that Cas got to reconnect with Gabriel and enjoy the mixture of joy and frustration that spending time with family inevitably brought.
Most people didn't set out to fill themselves with poison, it was fed to them by someone else, at least at first. Some had the good sense to spit it out immediately, some didn't know any better than to swallow it down and some found they liked the taste and drank more and more until their insides were rotten and they spewed venom on other people every time they opened their mouths.
Dean wasn’t sure how to make that happen though. He was fucking great at one-night stands, if he did say so himself, and he thought he was okay at dating—when that was what he'd actually started out doing. He was less good at working out how to transition from one to the other.
Maybe he just needed a nap, but going back to sleep didn’t seem that tempting when he couldn’t curl his body around Dean’s like he had earlier this morning. And where had that thought come from? He barely knew the guy. Sure, he was hot... and funny... and interesting... but Cas was not a cuddler and he didn’t do relationships. He barely did two-night stands.
“Is it me, or does God seem like he’s really insecure? Why does he feel the need to finish his declarations with ‘I am the Lord’ all the time?” Dean said, making Cas snort. “It feels like he’s trying a bit too hard to swing his dick around, right?”
“I’m so sorry, angel,” Dean said huskily and ‘angel’ sounded like an endearment now rather than a slightly mocking epithet. “I just wish you’d just healed me quick. I’d rather be hurt than hurt you, you must know that?”
Shoving the tray onto Cas’s lap, Dean hopped out of bed and raced to the kitchen. He returned triumphantly holding a bottle of maple syrup aloft.
“I know,” Dean replied, turning away from Sam to roll his eyes at Cas in a you-see-what-I-have-to-put-up-with gesture.
“—insofar as the artist didn't necessarily have a specific meaning in mind when they painted them. Even when the artist very clearly had a meaning in mind, it's not necessarily the meaning other people interpret the work to have. Maybe that undercuts the idea that it means anything at all, but I think there's something beautiful about everyone getting to decide what art or books or TV shows mean to them—even when the story is written, you can write your own ending, you know?” Cas finished passionately.
When Dean pulled back, Sam was eyeing the kitchen door speakingly and motioning with his whole head that they should step outside.
“If you're jerking your cocks when you frot”—Dean picked up two of Cas’s pencils from the coffee table and held them next to each other while working a fist over them suggestively—“you’re kind of bundling your dicks together?” Dean raised his eyebrows.
Dean dipped his head down to kiss Cas fiercely again, lips firm against his, tongue dominating Cas’s mouth. His hands roamed down from Cas’s shoulders, squeezed his waist and settled in to cup his ass as he ground against him. Dean pulled Cas towards him in a counterpoint to his own thrusts. Cas’s hands tangled in Dean’s hair, holding him close as he let Dean take charge, let Dean have the control that he’d been needing after feeling so lost and powerless. Cas returned his wild kisses with abandon.
God had no power over him now. And his father had no power over him, for the two of them had always been intrinsically linked. Only Cas had power over himself. He was in control of his own destiny, and strangely, it felt like getting his first tattoo had been one of the things that had given him that power, or at least helped him recognise it in himself, where perhaps it had always been.
I'll be updating this on a frequent non-scheduled schedule through the rest of December. There will be some wholesome Christmas escapades coming up.
“Dean, when will you realise, there is no ‘better’? Being with you is perfect. I love you and I want you as much as you want me.” He pressed his growing hardness against Dean in case his body was more persuasive than his words. "You worry too much, my love,” Cas told him gently, carding his fingers through his hair.
All those wants just tumbled around inside him till he wasn’t sure where to start. In the end he just laid down on Cas and thrust against him. He could feel Cas’s dick pushing up against his hip and the skin of Cas’s pelvis against his own hard cock felt amazing but it wasn’t quite what he wanted. He shifted slightly and lined them up so Cas’s dick was pressed against his own and that felt even better. Dean wrapped his hand around both of them, then took Cas’s hand and wrapped it around the other side. He let out a contented sound as he began to move. The pressure of Cas’s cock against his own, the feel of their palms, the closeness was exquisite. The rest could wait, right now, this was perfect. He just needed to feel Cas's skin against his and he needed them to come together. The latter didn’t take long at all. The whole thing was quick, dirty and wonderful.
The paintings might be low on old-fashioned gunslingers, but Cas thought they were very striking. The canvases were on either side of a sweeping staircase, so your perspective of them changed subtly as you walked up the stairs. Cas loved the size of the paintings. They loomed over the museum patrons like the legacy of colonialism loomed over America.
Frozen in thought, Dean stood in front of the stove until the eggs started smoking again. He switched off the heat when he heard the bathroom door open.
Both Dean and I feel bad for how he treated Cas, so read on for how Dean tries to make it up to him.
Cas led Dean over to the living room sofa so they could sit comfortably while he explained the fucked-up origins of the work. He tapped his fingers on his thigh, wondering where to start.
Cas wasn’t the kind of person who thought that everything happened for a reason, that smacked of fate and destiny and other things he didn’t believe in. What he did believe was that sometimes good things could come from the bad things you’d been through and that gave him comfort. He didn’t think he’d be as strong as he was if he hadn’t been forged in fire.
They cuddled in bed afterwards, still naked. Cas was lying on his side, head resting on Dean’s left shoulder, his arm slung over Dean’s stomach. Dean’s fingers idly traced the lines on the back of his forearm.
His hands went to the button on Cas’s jeans but didn’t try to undo it. Hesitantly, Dean asked, “Is this okay? I know it’s not exactly classy.” He bit his lip, looking like he was reconsidering. "You deserve better...”
An awkward silence descended as Dean drank his whisky. His gaze flitted around the dim bar rather than meeting Cas’s eyes. There was a tiny dance floor that no one was dancing on. People, men mostly, used the space to stand there in small groups drinking instead. Despite the lack of dancers, the disco lights above the floor were switched on. The cycling lights bathed Dean’s cheek in a rainbow of colour as Cas watched him quietly. He wondered why this didn’t feel as comfortable as sharing a drink in the bunker. Frustrated, he twirled his glass by the stem before blurting out, “I'm not really sure this place is for me.”
“Not that girl you’re seeing? You’re just starting out at that firm. It’s not the best time to start a family too, you know.”
Any desire to move was gone. He just wanted to lie there while Cas looked at him like that. Dean felt beautiful, powerful... loved. He licked his lips and watched as Cas’s eyes followed his tongue. Dean ran his hands up Cas’s thighs until they gripped his hips.
“Aw come on, Clarence. That’s just short-sighted. Feed me and my mouth will be too full to mock you.”
“Maybe we should talk about that later, in private,” Dean said, reaching out to pat Cas’s knee. Cas just nodded silently and went back to studying the picture, tilting his head in the other direction to look at it from a different angle.
"Yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I was just trying to clean it, I swear! And the sides looked great, and when I hit it with the water, it just stripped all the paint right off the board!"
"Sounds like you're a lot more tolerant than she is. That's good," Nathan answered, heading back toward the door as Ben followed after him, "I was, um... I wanted a few words with her about the lock and the window bars, privately, I mean. It may be her house, her rules, but this was unreasonable. Do you know where all her things are?"
His cheeks were pink, and the lines that showed at the corner of his eyes were many. He wasn't just full of life, he was brimming with it, and as Cas found himself hungry for a taste of that same laughter, he had no reason to hold back. He planted his knee onto the next step down as he turned, catching Dean's mouth with his own, pressing him back into the edges of the stairs further up.
"I, um.... I need some help with something, and I don't want to call my parents, but since you said you have insomnia, I thought maybe you'd be awake anyway."
"Considering family history, I certainly wasn't expecting anyone to come hold her hand," Crowley said quietly.
Cas nodded, "I'm aware of that. But the mall doesn't have an autoclave, or require years of training."
Leaving Lauren on the armchair where she'd slipped off his lap at her usual nap time, Alfie had set up to work on one of his new pieces, and Cas, who had wandered off the afternoon before, quietly entered through the front door, finding the living room dark with an interesting image on the large television screen as Alfie zoomed in and out, making what appeared to be a million small adjustments imperceptible to the naked eye when seen from it's correct size.
"Something tells me this isn't the first time this has happened," Dean said quietly, "So, there's a couch at my place..."
"Nah, I'm good. I'm not exactly aiming for prom queen," Cyndi answered, aware that Claire could relate.
Dean rolled his eyes, but gave two clicks before Cas guided his hips back, making him inch further away from the bed on his knees.
Bless you all, my lovely reviewers, I know you're having a good time when I get several reviews right after I post! Love you guys!
At home, Cas checked his watch. It had been a long day. He'd forgotten how strenuous substituting for middle school classes could be, and no one else had been available to take over.
"Yeah, um, Sam was so scared he'd be like their dad, he almost decided to just not have kids at all... Wait, I think I know. He cut his dad off before I was born, but he went to see him when he was dying, He came home, and he seemed angry for a really long time. I don't know what happened, but it had to be big."
"How you killed him." Chaz answered, "Took me a while, but I got it. You probably knew he was out there parking behind the shop building after it closed, had your dickless little man-bitch cut his brake lines, then you went out for a drive, knowing he'd follow you. Slow down with a semi coming, he can't brake, gotta try to pass you, right? In a hurry, there was no way Will could've stopped, or noticed the eighteen-wheeler."
Eleanor shook her head, continuing into the hall that led to her office, "Nothing to worry about. Ivan may be fond of the bad boy persona, but he's a gentleman."
He allowed his irritation to show as he paused and turned to face her on his way down the stairs, "Everyone had a good time. That's not a lie. I had conversation with my dad go badly on the way to drop him off at his hotel. And I do make calls in the middle of the night, or really early, because my mother is seven hours ahead of us, and Naomi is there, and I need to speak to her. Please, just get off my ass about it."
Angrily, Julie closed the door, hissing out her reply to keep the children from overhearing it, "What? Am I horning in on fun time? Are you sick of missing out on summer because that's when your ticket sales go up? If you want to see your kids and be a parent, they are right here! Where are you?"
Suddenly it didn't seem like such a good idea, but she seemed happy. That was all he had to offer the world at this point, keeping Claire happy. He loosened his grip and she kissed him again, her soft breasts falling against his chest as she shifted to adjust her position.
"Yeah, well, Margaret's gonna need something to drive, the Monte Carlo is starting to get where there's no point in fixing it. So, when we get back, she'll have something that'll work with a car seat, or whatever."
Jack shook his head and mimed punching the wall nearest him, "Look, I'm sorry, but, that doesn't seem like a safe attitude for her to take about a kid who just turned five. He could get hurt, or go missing, that's not... Other parents and grandparents don't do that, except when you hear about it on the news after they find the kid. I'm looking out for him, here, okay? I'm not trying to start anything with you."
Ben noticed Xander, and surprisingly, Cora, seated at the table as far apart as possible, glaring at each other, and Cas rounded the corner from the kitchen and attempted a tired smile, only to cringe, "Sunday... Of course..."
Alfie momentarily forgot words were a thing, and simply nodded, heading straight to his car, unsettled enough that he was glad he'd decided not to use his bike. Although in truth, he'd hoped to take Claire out to lunch instead.
"Yes, a real problem. She's three, she doesn't have an algebra test in the morning," Alfie reasoned quietly.
Across the large event hall, Alfie was being approached repeatedly, barely able to draw a breath between handshakes, comments, and enthused followers. One particularly grumbly woman had stated she didn't understand the message he was attempting to convey, but appreciated the distinct lack of violence in his work. He'd had no real response for her, which she apparently found disappointing.
She hefted the hood and propped it open, waving him toward her car battery in invitation to proceed, "Yep. You're just that lucky."
She leaned forward, her elbows on her knees, and buried her face in her hands. A slight tremble Cas didn't catch ran through her shoulders.
"So... I noticed you really haven't been talking to me much," Alfie said quietly, "Everything okay?"
"Okay," Ivan answered, nodding at the statement, "Julie said not to tell you, so not a word or you're gonna get me in trouble, but she overheard you and Kevin at the diner a while back, you guys were talking about this creative block you're having trouble with?"
"She put that part in the same sentence where she thanks you, so the two are tied. You helped her out, and she's saying she appreciates that she can count on you. That could be a just-friends thing, but then she keeps going, offering to tell you what happened, and if it's a secret, she probably means in private, and then mentioning hoping to see you at a party, well..." Alfie shrugged and passed the tablet back to him.
"Hang on." Alfie raised his hips to get to the phone in his back pocket, "Crap... Where's your phone?"
"Yeah. Cyndi was on the phone with her this morning. It wasn't her cell, so I snooped. You mom had a bad fall, and she wanted Cyndi to come help her get your mom moved to her guest room. Cyndi asked Daddy, and Daddy said she could make her own decision on it."
Panic rose in her voice, "But we can't change anything, because the house is a rental, and what if my mom's right, and I buy the wrong crib, and it's a death trap, and-"
Claire's face quickly twisted through a range of emotions, the most obvious seemed to be betrayal. Claire moved back, and Cas tried to take a step toward her, only to realize she was swinging the bar toward him.
With the commotion, Xander had come in from the garage to find Claire in a melted, half-crouched, half-kneeling position, nearly hyperventilating.
"C'mon... You wash it up now, or I take you straight in. You put the first aid policies in place for a reason, you know why," Lucas insisted.
It wasn't a great leap in Cas' mind, that a sarcastic response could be taken seriously, especially considering Xander's sense of humor.
Having reduced her to tears the last time he'd set eyes on her, he was not expecting the retort, much less the defiance with which it was delivered, and stood agape for a moment before trying his ignition again. This time, and he was thankful for it, the engine turned over and began to purr. He returned at a brisk pace to where the two vehicles were connected and removed the cables from Cynthia's battery, "All right. Thanks for stopping, have a nice life," shot toward her general direction, his tone aggravating and upset.
"Xander, hey, listen-" Jack started, "Look, man, I don't know what she said, but I just want you to know-"
Wheels gave miniscule thumps as Crowley pulled this black case behind him along the paved walk to the front door of his brother's very average, unassuming house, in a small town in the middle of nowhere.
"Yeah, before things got weird? Melody is in mutual crush with some kid at school. Nothing to him but knees, elbows, and an asthma inhaler, but some lard-ass is jealous, picks on the kid she likes, so she broke lard-ass's nose. She's suspended," Alfie explained, sitting down on the foot of the bed.
Alfie shook his head, standing up, "Okay, whatever, but the next time you think some guy in his fifties molested you, would you tell somebody? Please?"
In much the same way it had been a risk for Dean to hire Kip in the first place, only to have a falling out resulting in his reappearance a couple years later with a loaded gun, Claire feared that Randy had made a similar mistake in having Xander attempt to subdue the caller.
Dean nodded thoughtfully. "That's not his job, you know? You're supposed to talk to the counselor, that's her job."
"Of course I didn't, it's me!" Dean insisted quietly, "But what I did do, and don't get pissed at me, is I got Charlie to come crash on the couch, and gave Meg a taste of her own medicine while we were picking up some of her stuff, so hopefully, it's over."
Jess chuckled, "Okay, we're getting further into the game, because stuff is starting to combine. Dean, you have to drink for the first part, Alfie, you drink for the second. But this is good. This is the whole point."
Alfie turned his attention back to the papers on the table, shaking his head, "That's not what happened, okay? There's a lot you don't know. And I don't know how much she knows, or how she found out, but-"
"I'm the one that's home most of the time, if she needed a new bottle, she should have told me, and I don't know why she didn't. But I did notice that bottle had gone missing, I thought you moved it or something, so a big part of this is on me."
He stood on the front porch near the door, in the space that he'd long ago found Bobby's lifeless form, hands and throat cold to the touch, and a very off color to his skin. He bounced his happy child gently, and turned in place as she looked around, her eyes taking in everything as she kept her wiggling fingers in her mouth. Claire joined him with the smallest of three diaper bags, just as Rachel was closing her car door, "Got everything?"
"Great," Dean said dryly, pulling a short sprig from the back of his collar, "Actually, this should be plenty. Um, hey, thanks, tree."
Cas opened up her right hand only to find her fingers had been curled around a rather thick metal bolt that had left an imprint of it's threads in her skin.
When Rachel arrived at the small house in the junkyard that evening, she was under no illusions that dinner would be any more than a basic meal, and being cooked by her own son rather than a housekeeper, less than pleasant. It was her attempt to make peace that pushed her to go, and then, only because it seemed to be what Alfie wanted from her.
Melody was taking in the image of the old woodcutting on the page with eager eyes as her chewing slowed. Gabe reached over the table to the book with one hand, taking a second cookie from the tin with the other, and turned the page twice, settling back to dunk his cookie in his short glass of milk. The page showed a more recognizable image and several paragraphs regarding Father Christmas, and longstanding traditions from England.
"You look beautiful, Julie." Ivan said quickly, correctly assuming Cyndi would be shoving something up far too close to the camera a few seconds later. He caught a quick glimpse of a smile on her face before the screen went white with a sheet of paper, then dark, then Julie pulled the paper further back so it was visible.
"I didn't change it. My husband took my name, actually, and our kids have my name. It's just the way we wanted to do things."
"Only the ones about me. I think it's funny. I could listen to stupid people be idiots all damn day, I don't care."
"Okay," Dr Thompson said, standing and moving to the door. He waved Claire in, and moved back to his chair, this time with a clipboard.
Claire leaned over against Alfie as she raised the hem of her shirt a few inches to show Margaret part of the scar.
"Shut up... Anyway, if you knew Bobby, you know he had guns, woundo up with one pointed right at me. Told me if I needed money that bad, he'd give me a chance to work for it, but I had to stay out of trouble. I was, I don't know, fourteen?... I lied about my age, but he never called me on it, I started with basic maintenance stuff, it's not that hard once you get used to it, and it helps tune out all the crap in life, like it's not even there." Dean shifted slightly, trying to keep his leg from falling asleep. "So how did you know Bobby? Your dad?"
Lights became visible as a new town, a larger one, came into view, and through the quiet, empty streets, they came to the middle of the town. A three story building, a particularly plain courthouse, lorded over the yellow-lit town square, a tiny, dead city, and what atrophied population likely still scurried about in the daylight among it's aged and sometimes decrepit buildings, seemed to be entirely asleep.
Saturday, with a single ear bud in, she had listened to them on repeat as she worked on Bobby's car, having nothing else to do. Dean had left her in the garage to hang out with Ben a bit, but kept coming in to check on her, at one point bringing in his Impala and doing an oil change where the tools were all readily available.
"Absolutely not," Margaret snapped, "You need help, yeah, but you belong here, just get in to see somebody and get through this, but you have your family to support you-"
"No," Dean answered, gesturing to her, "You're right, you're a lame-duck, and being in the garage is a bad idea. Horrible, even. You can't be in the garage like that. But you see the risks of it, and you aren't scared to call me out. Now, we need as many of these rush tune-ups out of the way as possible before people start making trips to see family, breaking down while coming through town traveling, we need everyone who can do it out in the bays, which means somebody has to be at the desk, making the phonecalls, getting the customers coming in to pick up as soon as possible, and ordering parts as-needed instead of waiting for the end of the day, and maybe not getting it done at all."
"Ben looks enough like Lisa, he won't make the connection. And if he does, just point out that they share a set of grandparents, and that is true enough. I would wait until Sam and Jess are ready to tell their children before telling Ben."
"Claire's mom has a couple days left, at most, Cas is in Oklahoma to, uh, see her out, I guess, and Dean's pissed. He thought Cas should stay home," Alfie said quietly, trying to avoid any attention from Melody, "Any idea why that would make Dean mad?"
"It's okay, I'm a mechanic, I know what I'm doing. Any place on the way is fine. And then I need to stop by the gallery where my husband is. Do you have the address for that?"
Cas moved closer, still set on getting her inside. Claire shoved his arm away. "You can't. I'm not doing this anymore."
Crowley always carried a sense of unease as he entered the home, never certain of what he might find. Years had passed, a decade and a half, but there was always the half second on the front step that the remnants of pain and horror would crush his heart.
"That's just people being nice, it's not glowing, it's sweating. And I'm not there yet," Millie replied.
Castiel, shaking hard now, looked up, meeting Dean's gaze, clenching suddenly at his ribs. It was too much for both of them.
Ivan shook his head, glancing around, "That's crap. There's no kind of honor in not hitting a girl just because they're a girl. Obviously you should never hit first just so you can use self defense as a reason, but no... The real reason is that because girls are smaller, not as strong, they evolved this, well, it's almost like a super power. Girls fight mean. Have you ever seen two girls get into a fight? It's crazy. They look all sweet and nice one minute, and the next it's all claws, teeth, ripping out the fake-ass hair extensions, like vicious, rabid bunnies. And if you're bigger than they are, if they know they can't take you, they wait. Then, when you're not suspecting it, they find a way to embarrass you, or ruin your life. Some girls even do that crap for fun."
"It would have been nicer if you'd gone with me," Ivan said quietly. It was clear that he had more interest in her than she had in him at that point, but there was also a one-sided sadness as well, "I kept hoping to talk to you, but you kept passing the phone off to the girls... I missed you more than ever."
Mike had been out of the habit of being dressed down by anyone with a significant size difference, and dropped back into his chair without another peep.
"Clearly, you regret it." Cas answered, "But how are you going to let go of that regret if you don't talk to him?"
Dean nodded, "Yeah, this is... should be good. I hope... um, I don't really know what this guy is going to want to discuss, but, hopefully, whatever we talk about, it'll help prevent any problems, right?"
"To shake you up," Dean answered simply. Receiving a look of confusion from Mike, he sat back in his seat and continued, "You never get anywhere new by staying where you are. And you were trying to figure out life apart from your parents, because that's just what guys your age do."
Alfie rubbed at his face, and tried to tear his attention away from what little Claire was wearing, "I'm pretty sure I'm missing some part of this..."
"Dude, you are so deep in boyfriend territory, you get any deeper, you're going to find a boyfriend of your own. But, hey, you could do a lot worse than Millie."
Margaret shrugged, "Find something to do. Make another fancy  picture. You haven't been doing that lately."
"They sold... Those fruit fly fucking pin-dick mother fuckers sold... Son of a bitch..." Claire hissed in frustration before turning half away around and finding Ben next to her, staring, "What?...Like you haven't heard all of that before?"
"Alfie, can I tap you in?" Margaret asked quietly, below Kevin saying something else that was nearly incomprehensible. It was evident on her face that she was losing the fight against the monsters in Kevin's mind. It had only been minutes, Claire was sure, but she pulled her legs close as Alfie stood and went to the door.
"You didn't keep that one you made of me, did you?" Rachel asked, either paying no mind, or specifically ignoring how Alfie tensed and flinched, "God, you made me look so old, and ugly."
She stood at the sink, having left her plate and glass on the counter, leaning on her hands as he approached her from the side, and leaned his hip against the counter to face her.
(A/N2: The next chapter takes place in six years. There will be a reminder. If I've left out anything, the places to challenge me to a swordfish fight are, in order: Twitter, @fythyrwisp, and Tumblr.)
"It's not an act! It's all I have left where you're concerned, all right?... And anyway, just... No, okay? No cutting anything."
"If you're looking to throw low blows and you don't care who else gets hurt, then what about the kids?" Alfie asked.
Claire chuckled, "He couldn't read cursive when he swiped the box, so he gave up trying to read the letters, but he was embarrassed he took them, so he stashed the whole thing, not knowing what was in it. He's going to want to go through this when he gets a chance, though."
"Tequila often makes people ballsy," Cas replied as Dean turned around to sit next to him, unfastening his boot laces.
"I guess... Too bad neither of us thought to look it up, huh?" Alfie sank into the driver's seat carefully, not letting go of Claire's hand.
Only having a half day, Cas pulled his white Ford Edge up the gravel road only to find a small red Buick parked on the gravel by his front gate, and his front door standing wide open.
Claire didn't like the condescending tone in Rachel's voice, but wrote it off to a possible language barrier, "That's right. It's a big part of my life."
Cas shrugged, and turned to look at a rack of jewelry next to a stand of veils as Claire took the only dress that wasn't pink into the changing room she'd been stationed in.
"Nah, that's what I doodled while trimming the photo down to what you see here, that just helped me decide what to remove."
"You said you spent a lot of time with that poster, and if you had the poster, then it only makes sense. What song were you stuck on?"
"Make sure you find a new place to hide the bodies." Cas said distractedly, "If the trunk is too full for a distributor cap, it won't hold another corpse."
"He might be darker than Dean, but he gets that from Lisa, and Dean's father, John. Look at Emma and the twins, and their bone structure, it's painfully obvious. His parentage isn't in question."
"No, I'm really okay... Anyway, it's still early, so, um, I was going to wait on dinner for a bit, I was going to talk to Ivan, but he's in the yard." Ben hinted cautiously.
"K.M.A. Bakeries is changing it. I'm just here to mix the batter and sling sprinkles. But we're nowhere near ready for our opening date, so since I can't sell you anything, there's no reason for you to be here, and you're going to have to leave. I'll let you know when, so you can visit us for all your pastry needs."
"... And he's still staring. Okay, he's gonna be a creep about it. So, c'mere," Dean said, stepping forward to give Cas a quick and unexpected hug that included a thump on his back.
Margaret turned to her window in irritation, "I don't get it. It was like, every night for a while there, then at least every few days, and then the last couple of weeks, nothing. What's going on with you?"
He went upstairs quickly, picked up the aging dog, and brought her down gently. She'd gone gray around the muzzle and eyes and had started taking issues with puppies Ben would foster, being in no mood to tolerate them as her arthritis had further developed. As a result, Ben was no longer fostering puppies, and although regrettable, as the dog's health slowly went downhill, Ben had been spending far less time with her. The only exception was their morning routine, which had caused a panic one morning when Nick had gotten up in the middle of the night and wandered in to sleep on the floor next to his and Cas' bed. Ben, in his half-awake state, had yelled at Xander so loudly, and as abruptly as it had woken him, he'd been half sure Cas had to be halfway to a second heart attack. There was no doubt in his mind that Ben still loved the dog dearly, but it was clear that they all felt what was coming, after all, a dog's life is too pure to last long. Somehow, unlike the puppies she'd snap at, she'd always graciously accepted every awkward knee, elbow, or shared cookie she could get from Mike and Melody.
A substitute had sent one of the quietest, and most demure students to Cas' office for failing to speak loudly enough when answering a question, and the child had been reduced to tears.
"Yeah. He figured we didn't get the chance at baby pictures, so this was close enough... Not close enough, this was, um... Close as we get, I guess."
"So, you're telling me that as an underage teen, you approached Dean with questions about sex, and that was an appropriate conversation?" she asked.
Pulling into the parking lot, Cas spotted Claire's car where she was standing talking to Sam and Jess, and headed over to speak to her as Dean pulled Ben aside.
Jack was looking at his phone, and put it away, "Trey says he already    went through, so he's not coming, but when we get done, he has something awesome planned. We're supposed to meet up by the    inflatables on the south side of the square."
"Jack," Hannah said sternly, "Did Ben actually make any comments about Aubrey? Or did you make it up to upset her?"
Dean slid deeper into the blankets as he became aware he wouldn't have Cas' company immediately, "I dunno, sweetheart. Might just be that he needed to hear it. Either way, good answer."
Jaime thrashed as he tried to free himself from Cas' arms, screaming like a caught animal, "I don't want you! I want Daddy!"
The door behind the man swung open, and Alfie stepped inside quickly, having changed into work jeans, boots that had seen nothing more than yard work since they'd been purchased a season before, and one of his remaining original uniform shirts, now faded and threadbare, open over a black undershirt.
"Daddy, look! I got a E! I counted to one hundred and got all my sight-words right!" Cyndi explained, even though he couldn't make out what was printed on the paper.
"I fell asleep on a friend's couch. You know, like you did Friday? I was tired from work. And if you had called me at one, it would have woken me up, and I would have come home, so, what are you blaming me for?" Claire asked angrily.
"Make coffee," Claire answered with a hint of an unamused smirk, "I have to go in to work today, or I'm going to lose my damn mind."
"I haven't felt this loopy since... You said Crowley's coming to town?" Kevin slurred, "I hate that guy... He's the best, but I hate him."
"But, you're thinking of making it so Alfie would be in charge, and I would just kind of be around?" Claire clarified.
Fresh tears welled in Cynthia's eyes, "See, that's why I come to you with the big stuff, you never give bad advice."
Alfie shrugged as he started getting dressed, "Yeah, but, you know, Ben and Xander turned out fine."
"Yeah. Takes some of the pressure off you. And if you guys split up, then you wouldn't have to be involved at all. Not that we want that." Margaret answered, "But we also don't want Mike to cause that, that's why we're here, talking about it."
"Yeah, but it's from Dad. That would probably matter," Ben answered, "We'll find out, give him the option, and then put it wherever he tells us."
"Yeah. I guess." Claire said softly, trying to ignore the obvious grin Alfie allowed to take over his face.
"It took, and maybe literally, half the store, but yeah, she found it. And the whole store could hear her when she found it. Thanks to Melody poking around in the racks when she was supposed to be looking at jewelry, and no thanks to the freakin' employee."
The question hung in the air as it became painfully apparent that it had nothing to do with the dog.
Cas and Dean stood near the entrance of the waiting area as Ben found a chair, discussing how bad the damage to the car might be.
"Your fathers, your brothers, Kevin? All the guys you work with, who respect you, rely on you, and who need you to have their back, is that how you see us? And Mike? And are you going to use that as an excuse if our son gets out of hand with somebody? Just a bunch of soulless pigs hellbent on one thing, right?"
"He's rich enough he doesn't need them to go to a better school. They don't need a better school. The guy is loaded with a capital 'oaded."
"God, no. No, my mom's going to take me to a place near where she works, one of her coworkers got something done there, and she said if I had to do this, I should do it right."
Gabe was listening as he crossed the work room to get to the fresh pot of coffee, his attention to the conversation well hidden.
"And that's fine," Kevin answered, bouncing Lauren slightly to adjust her weight on his hip, "Because we love you, and we've got your back... Margaret would've been here, but-"
Kevin laughed, "Bud, there's no way. I mean, come on. Who, in a relationship over five years, do you know that gets into fights more than twice a year?"
Dean nodded as he listened, "Yeah, well, you should. That aunt of yours keeps her caged up like a dog."
"So, it's cute, at least. I guess. Definitely a girl's haircut. Just, um..." lost for words and trying not to stammer, he seemed a bit more panicked as Claire rose from her chair, balancing carefully against the desk as she did, and started for the door, "Wait. Okay, just remember, I couldn't hear him, okay?"
Dean was unable to make out exactly which choice words had been strung together, but as she slowed, Claire resumed actual English, "-fucking kidding me? He works at a school! He has to tell them if he knows about something happening, even outside of work, it's required! And nothing actually happened! Everything would have been fine! And nobody woke me up because all you assholes running my life for me, just ruin hers too, so-"
Dean rested his chin on Ben's head, "You want to tell me what's really going on?... Why you called Sam?... Why Sam thinks this has to do with one of your friends?"
"Yeah, well, I need you to run out early, I got a call on the way over. It seems someone's getting stupid over at the bakery, and I need a representative to throw on a monkey suit, run over, and give 'em hell," Claire said, coming closer and running a hand across the back of his shoulders.
Claire shrugged, "This guy knows numbers, but he doesn't know all the stuff you learned from Bobby. If he did, maybe he'd have a better idea where to draw the line on customer service policies."
Cas seemed to agree reluctantly, "Mike, you weren't with whoever caused the damage in the first place, were you?"
Kevin gave Mike's back a thump as he let go, "Okay. Behave yourself. And when you get back, I think you owe Mom an apology for scaring her like that. I mean, technically, you ran away."
"He would be bored to tears because he's not a car-person. He's an animal-person. You would think, as much as you wanted to become a doctor, you'd step back and let him nurture and heal things." Cas said, setting his nearly empty wine glass on the railing in front of him with a look of distaste, "And, anyway, at least you have Claire to pal around with."
"Yeah, we got this. He's been helping out so much, I was only worried about leaving the house tonight because he wouldn't be here. But apparently everything's okay, I'll go see what Margaret says, and I guess we'll find out how this goes with the cops... Again... I'm going inside, though, in case you want to do that army-guy talking-to, or something," Kevin lightly tapped Dean's upper arm, and made for the door.
He scooped up some of the ice into a glass, filling it the rest of the way at the sink, and went back to the bed, sitting down carefully.
"He also said he gave you some papers for us to hang onto," she continued, not catching a very guilty look in his eyes, "So, does that mean that we're-"
He allowed himself to be swept along, his steps automatic, his mind blanking repeatedly between hectic thoughts as bile rose in his throat in waves. He noticed after she'd ducked to retrieve her purse and the door closed fully, that she wasn't carrying her shoes, but in a matter of seconds, she'd hurried him into the ladies room and settled him next to a sink, dampening a paper towel and applying it to his cheek.
"We'll be so exhausted, and you're going to be anxious and try to get out of it and check your phone the entire time," Ben answered.
Dean shrugged, "I just thought she'd get a kick out of the car. And you talk to her a lot more than I do because she can understand you better, I just wanted to tell her she did good standing up for Mel today."
Julie shook her head, "I don't think any of us were looking too closely right then. We hated her, we bullied her, it's not a huge leap to guess why she was ducking from class to class, not talking to anybody, not with the way we'd gang up on her, and then out of nowhere, he's dead. She already had a target on her back, so it wasn't much of a stretch to say she drove him to it, that she knew exactly what she was doing, and pushed him too far, but that was a load of crap. For some of us, it eventually stopped, we came to our senses, and maybe other people never came around."
Jack looked up, startled, an expression Gabe fondly remembered bringing to his face many years prior.
"I don't owe you, Kev." Alfie said quietly, "You found a bottle of viagra in the guest bathroom, and put a bunch of them in my drink, remember? Then you got scared I was going to die."
"Yeah, well, her mother and I weren't together very long, I was... I was different then. We had split up before Claire was born, I had some things to work out anyway, and she wanted to move to California. Only saw Claire a couple of times before she moved. I figured she was right, a child should be with her mother, right? That's how it is in nature. So I said I wouldn't push for contact, just to send me pictures. That's all I asked for, pictures. Claire would talk to me on the phone sometimes, Christmas, birthdays, and then when she was about nine, I guess..." Cas took a deep breath, "I don't know, just... nothing."
"You're really lucky I hated this color, the bottle's still full." Claire said, shaking it to mix the contents, and getting Ben to sit on the couch, holding the sticker up to his cast.
Cas lifted his weight off his lap and slid out of him gently, setting his legs on the floor and backing up.
"Good. What about you?" Lucius asked, picking up one of the trays, "I know I asked you at the wedding, but it's been a while since then."
"Last I checked, I know more about this than you, on all sides of this. I know the job, I know the medical stuff, and I work with her. I have a clearer idea of how serious this is, and it's a worse idea to piss her off right now."
"I don't know if you're bossy enough to be a good landlord," Dean answered, making for the kitchen, and finding Xander and Cora speaking quietly to avoid being heard. Both of them carried a sour expression. As he got closer, he could make out bits and pieces.
"Not a word. Why, does she want it?" Dean asked, grabbing a biscuit, dropping it on his plate, and turning around to get into the fridge.
Millie's friend seemed less than thrilled with the plan for the evening, and the two of them had hung near the back until everyone had started for the school. Despite starting out early, sticking to Xander's pace, the three of them, joined by the girls, were soon the last group.
He became aware of a figure approaching from some distance, and as soon as it was obvious the man was headed for him, Cas was able to make out his face. Gabe took a seat on the other end of the bench, "Cassie. Thought I recognized your car."
Cas pulled the large trunk that had replaced the from below the bed, and bent to shuffle through it's contents, coming up again with a gag meant to suspend the mouth open. It seemed fitting, and likely to give just a bit of pain, much like his own, from clenching too hard, but as he turned to face Dean it all fell into place.
He gave a sleepy shake of his head against her, "No way I was relaxing that night... And his hands are a lot bigger than yours, that's not... nuh-uh."
"Yeah. But not too soon to consider it an option for the future. I mean, did you still want to be 'mom's boyfriend' when she's in school? Or when she's old enough to start asking who her real dad is?" Alfie asked, as Ivan shrugged, and started tugging loose the part he was after, "Okay, well, there's the other side of this, you've seen probably the best and worst of 'mom's boyfriends.' So, put yourself in Cyndi's shoes, what's she going to want, long term? And that's whether you and Julie grow old together or split up in, I don't know, six months."
Alfie's voice deepened slightly, "I'm not doing their job as a father if I let them see me sit back while someone so much as looks at you funny. But she's been following the rules. I don't mind telling her no, but-"
Dean rolled his eyes, getting in as Cas did the same, "After what he called me at Ben's wedding, in front of Millie's parents, he can just stick with 'Dean.' I'd rather forget it happened."
"I picked up a six pack of that hard cider Jess got you started on," Sam's voice came from the porch, putting Cas' mind at ease even as disappointment echoed through his emotions, "I figured we should probably scale it back a bit. It's still stronger than beer."
"My kids? Depends on who's driving. But knowing what's under the hood, I'd take this one over those others, or anything from a used car dealership. I'd probably go with something new, or under five thousand miles over this one, but after that, it really depends on how they handle the car that counts in my book. One little warning, though, this is a muscle car. And once she gets used to the stick, she's going to find out it has a hell of a lot of power. Also, the car-guys at school are all going to want a turn, if it was Mel, I'd have a rule, nobody drives it but her, or a parent."
She looked at Dean, clearly expecting a comment. He shrugged, "Hey, if the kids are happy and safe, everyone's good, right? Well, we got the first part down, and hopefully we can keep up with the second part."
"'Talk' is just what happens while they sharpen the ax. They're already planning what to do next, they want him gone."
Claire sat quietly, listening to the obstetrician as Alfie continuously ran his hand over her back as something of a physical distraction. She hoped he was listening, but he kept looking at the black and white print-outs of the 3D ultrasound, specifically at the ones of the baby's face.
"Wait," Dean spoke up, "Your uncle sounds like he's from England, and Naomi sounds like she's from here, I thought your mom's side was American?"
"I'm sorry, this is awful." Margaret said, looking across the table at Alfie, "If I weren't completely creeped out by hospitals, I'd go see her. I'm gonna go see her when she's home, though."
"You got me." Gabe replied, "Truth be told, we are never going to get along, that's just how it is. And I really don't want to work with you anymore. We can't make a good team if we can't cooperate, and unfortunately I messed that up a long time ago. So... The new middle school... The gal they wanted is moving. They need somebody, fast. I'm their first choice, but honestly, I don't want it."
"I could have done more. Pick him up and put him outside? I don't know. But he started it. Usually you don't take that kind of-... Y-you should go home."
"If something that awful happened now, as close as you are now, it wouldn't take two years, though, right? You'd just tell him."
"Didn't need to hear that!" Alfie called over the sound of the kitchen sink running. He soon reemerged, gently wiping at Melody's cheek with a wet paper towel, "So, he's gone for good, right? No reason to come back now that he knows there's no connection? Because I'm getting on a plane tomorrow, and the idea of him showing up again is making me rethink it."
Alfie had his laptop open and was leaning sideways against the desk, using an electronic drawing tablet and stylus. The image on the screen looked to be a city skyline at dawn.
The speed of the compilation belied the length of the video, Mike had lost track of time, but with a small commotion it was set aside, as a shout was given across the street, and Joey's brother began walking out of the yard quickly.
"I'm still not talking to Jack... on the bus home, I was thinking about when we went to see Xander, and... I snuck into the junkyard. The gun Xander was using was one of Trey's, and he took home one of mine, I found Xander's out there near the stack, and, I dunno, I just climbed up there to sit for a while, and I didn't hear Claire. Cas came up to check on me."
Claire looked down at the passenger footpegs he'd unfolded. He sat with all of his weight holding the motorcycle steady. She desperately wanted to take him up on his offer.
Lucas nearly ran into Dean as he stopped suddenly in the middle of the empty first bay, watching through the wide open door.
"He said if you're enough of a pussy to spill your guts like that to him, then if I get bitchy you'll throw me a midol instead of knocking me around." Margaret shrugged.
Sam shook his head, getting to his feet, "I'll get them sorted out, don't worry about it. It's been a long day, anyway, you guys should get Chance and head home."
"That was never my intent. She's upset, and sent you to change my mind because I said I don't want- I'm not moving in there. I hugged her, even, I was not trying to hurt her feelings," Cas explained.
From the scent of things as she groggily found the kitchen, not only was there coffee, it had been brewed to Margaret's preferred strength. Not her favorite, but excellent for hangovers, as she knew from experience.
"Call her, she'll tell you. We left my car at the school. Then I picked it up and went for a long drive."
"Ohhhh, shit... that was..." Dean was still breathing hard, and not certain he was making any sense. A deeply satisfied sound came from deep in his throat as he stroked through Cas' hair, pressing his cheek against the head that had come to rest on his shoulder.
Dean winced at the loud creak as he opened the driver's door. The air inside was stale, and he left the door open as he cranked the ignition, trying to get it to start.
"It's not that bad, you big whiner," Dean said, reaching for the cup, taking a quick sip, and attempting to hide his sour expression.
"He's bigger than me, and he hit me first, after making threats. If he was mentally challenged, maybe I'd agree with you, but I think by this point, he should know better." Claire replied.
"There's something you're not saying, because you think I'm gonna take it wrong, but I know what it is."
"I'm okay," the boy stammered far more weakly than he meant to, and cast a fearful look toward Alfie.
Cynthia was in the habit of making a three-point turn around and parking her car on the road, nose toward the highway, as no one was likely to need the dead end or the gate to the old ranch that remained unused for years.
"So does the rest of me." Margaret replied, as her phone began to ring. She glanced at the screen, "Eh, nope... Try again next week, bitch."
Claire smiled, looking away briefly, "No... It's not dumb... And we never tried to see who could do more push-ups."
"You got pictures, right?" Claire asked as Dean went past her, heading for Melody's overnight bag in the living room.
"Six months! You promised me-" she cut herself off, her voice giving her away as tears brimmed, "You said you weren't taking anymore trips for six months. And it's not like you have to, the show in Chicago got huge reviews, and you weren't even there!"
The front door closed, not far off from the room that was slowly coming together as a nursery, and Xander shook his head, "I don't know. I just do what they tell me. So is this like a phone tree, you want me to call anybody and pass it on?"
"Hell yeah, but I've known her longer than you have." Kevin answered, "Okay, mental do-over, what would you do different?"
"Only when I puke. Mostly I just feel nervous and sad all the time, so, it's probably going to stop."
Ben shifted onto his side, "It's not like she didn't have an out, she could have just said her mom was on drugs, she didn't have to say anything about what happened to her, but she did. Unlike Dad and Pops, she just straight-up told us what happened to her. Now that she's the one who brought it up, nobody really has to avoid the whole thing. Less stress on her."
Dean tightened his grip and continued to stroke him as Cas leaned forward over the hood, bracing himself with a hand, taking a quick look to be sure the parking lot was still empty before dropping his body low enough to drag his testicles over the silver feline statuette.
Garth shook his head, "That won't be in the letter, but you're right. Public opinion is cruel mistress, and the district can't keep up with this thing rearing it's ugly head in the future. And any disgruntled pre-teen that doesn't like their grades could bring it all up again."
"Well, makeup is considered inappropriate, but for the most part, it's overlooked. The new guidelines are much stricter, even chapstick would be worth a call home and a warning."
"I was very close with her a very long time ago. But if there's a type of person who can waltz into your life and pick up as though they never left, she's it," Cas explained.
Dean nodded. He'd tried to get Ben to talk on the way home. "The teachers taking you seriously, now?"
Cas steadied himself on Dean’s shoulder as he watched curiously as Dean dipped his middle finger into the mess he'd left, and spelled out 'fuck you' in capital letters.
He was right. Dean never wanted to let Cas go, his body, his soul, his whole being, he wanted to keep all of Cas with him. Dean wanted to tell him that, but, instead, he just whimpered. He couldn’t seem to form whole sentences.
happy, and that was what Cas wanted. He let himself be shepherded inside by Dean’s hand on his lower back.
Dean broke the kiss for a moment to say, “You are just so...” Apparently at a loss for words to finish that sentence, he nuzzled into Cas’s neck. “I want you so badly,” he breathed into the sensitive skin there. “I love you so much,” he whispered against his throat between sucking and licking. After a few minutes of increasingly feverish kisses, Dean drew back and tried to slow down enough to think.
Instead, he said, “I think they’re delicious, but if you want them to be even better, add the salt before they go into the pan and take them off the heat about thirty seconds sooner than you did. Also, half and half or cream will make them fluffier than two percent milk. I’ll show you how I make mine next time if you want.”
“Is this like the fancy, artistic version of the back row of a movie theatre? Did you just bring me here to fool around?” Dean asked laughing.
“I'm bi, dude. I like guys and I like Cas and I'm bi,” Dean said in rush, words tumbling out of his mouth haphazardly.
A couple of hours later, Dean heard the bell ring just as he was pulling a tray of mince pies from the oven. He set them down and went to get the door. Cas stepped inside and immediately hugged him. It felt even better than Dean’s dumb airport fantasies because it was real. Cas was warm and solid in his arms. Well, he’d just come in from the cold, so he was a little chilly and solid in Dean’s arms, but it felt like he was right where he belonged. He gave Cas a squeeze before letting go.
After being lost in his thoughts for a moment, Cas turned to see how Dean responded to all of that. He looked serious, but he wasn’t running away screaming. Even without giving Dean the pertinent details, Cas felt like this conversation was pretty clearly telegraphing the fact that he was someone with issues. Either Dean had issues too or he just wasn’t the type of person who’d be scared off by them. Cas wasn’t sure. He tried to move the conversation away from religion and back to tattoos.
“I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. She can be surprisingly sensitive. And the sweater’s actually pretty cosy,” Cas said, running his hand down the wool covering his chest.
Shaking his head, he went to prep his workstation. He could hear soft voices from the front of the shop but didn’t pay any attention to what was being said, trusting that Meg would really do her best to make it up to Alfie. He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and dug it out.
Cas laughed at him. He knew he was being deliberately absurd just to lighten the mood. “You’re ridiculous,” he told Dean.
For anyone who doesn’t know, Jewel Staite is the actress who plays Amy Pond in Supernatural and Kaylee Frye in Firefly.
Dean snorted. “I’m excellent at the one-night stand part. I’m less good at the morning after part if I actually want to suggest doing this again sometime.” And he did want to do this again. Cas was smart and funny in a subtle, dry way and hot, so hot. So yeah, Dean wanted to see him again.
He grabbed Cas’s hand and pulled him in the direction of the bar. Dean wasn’t normally much one for holding hands. He wasn’t sure if that was because he wasn’t into casual PDA, apart from the occasional kiss when he just couldn’t help himself, or when he was drunk, which amounted to the same thing really. Or perhaps, after years of hunting, it was natural circumspection that made him want to keep his hands free. Today though, he was feeling warm and relaxed and he wanted to be close to Cas. He wove his fingers through his husband’s and they walked hand in hand for two peaceful blocks.
Dean had to admit that kind of sounded like him. Still, “Pretty presumptuous to bring this amount of lube if you ask me!”
Dean was grinning giddily when he left Sam to go find Cas in the library. He was sitting in one of the dark leather wingback chairs there. Cas smiled up at Dean as he entered and set the report he’d been reading down on the little round table next to the chair. Dean made a move toward the empty chair across from Cas’s but Cas grabbed him and pulled him down to sit on him instead. Dean could feel his cheeks warm as he shifted to get comfortable and put his arms around Cas’s neck. It felt like he settled into his own skin as he settled into Cas’s lap.
too and she has a name from Dr Who! How cool is that?” Charlie was bouncing on the balls of her feet and grinning like she was about to have a spontaneous nerdgasm.
The DJ had played Vogue earlier, damn thing must have gotten in his head. He wondered if he could actually find a gay bar that played rock. They had to exist right? Even if he found one, he’d probably keep bringing Cas here anyway. Cas loved all this pop diva stuff and Dean loved Cas, more than enough to put up with some annoyingly catchy, overly upbeat tunes. Maybe he could find a rock cover of Vogue that would make the song more palatable to him. Probably not.
Gabriel made a face at Sam when he took his first bite of the vegan pancakes. He grabbed the bottle of syrup from the middle of the table to drown his dry cardboard in sugar. Sugar was at least vegan and, miracle of miracles, the café had real maple syrup. There was a selection of other toppings too. Cas picked up the bottle with a bee on and squirted some on his stack. He made a face as well when he tasted it.
Dean tried to concentrate, he really did, but being so close to Cas the whole day felt like drawn out foreplay. Admittedly, it was weirdly PG rated foreplay, but, still, Dean felt like his whole body was humming with sexual awareness by the evening. He’d wanted to get Cas back into bed since they left it this morning and the urge had only grown. Something held him back, not so much nerves anymore, he just didn’t want Cas to think this was only about sex, that that was all Dean wanted from him when it so much more. He wanted everything, he wanted all of Cas and he wanted to give the entirety of himself to Cas in return.
Standing in front of the mirror in his living room, Dean shrugged a leather jacket over the jeans and t-shirt combo he was wearing. The outfit was perfect for tonight. He grinned and shot his reflection a wink.
“I think it’s a ‘gag gift’ but it’s almost impossible to tell what’s a joke and what isn’t with Meg sometimes. I laughed when I unwrapped it and she looked really hurt. I’ve been wearing it practically every other day since Christmas to make it up to her. I wasn’t going to wear it for a date, but she came into my room while I was getting ready and started talking about how the colour makes my eyes pop.” Cas rolled said eyes emphatically.
“It’s getting late,” Dean said, yawning and stretching his arms above his head. He was pretty sure the movement drew attention to the play of muscles across his chest if Cas’s rapt gaze was any indication. “Wanna come to bed?”
Dean made another promise to himself to be nicer... it didn’t last very long this time around either.
He pulled Cas, and then Sam, who he was only slightly mad at now, into a hug. Dean kissed Cas’s cheek and wondered idly if he could make a beer that Cas would like when he got the hang of brewing. Maybe something citrusy, with a pillowy-soft body and fruity hops.
“It's a little on the nose to paint a demon's lair blood red, don't you think?” Cas said later as he rolled another stripe of paint up the wall.
It had only been a week since Dean had told him that for the first time and he was pretty sure they were in triple digits of him saying it now. Maybe the novelty would wear off and Dean wouldn't feel the need to tell him at least a dozen times a day, maybe just half a dozen, but he doubted it. He damn well wanted Cas to know how much he was loved. If anyone deserved to hear they were loved ridiculously often, it was him. Cas smiled the smile he got on his face every time Dean told him he loved him. And Dean couldn’t take his eyes off him. He felt like he could spend the rest of forever just looking at this man.
Charlie put her beer down and stepped away from the counter. Grinning, she held her arms out and did a little twirl so Dean could appreciate her costume from every angle. She was wearing a fluffy dress with a gathered cream bodice, short pink puff sleeves and a huge floor-length skirt with a cascade of chiffon ruffles that went from cream to peach to pink. It looked amazing and entirely impractical.
“Well, I mean, I didn’t grow up in a cult or anything, but my childhood wasn’t exactly some normal, apple-pie life either.”
Meg smiled at him, warmer than usual, all sincerity instead of snark. Apparently, giving her girlfriend a demonic nickname was as good as welcoming her to the family where Meg was concerned. She had a point, he supposed. Sniping and sarcasm were a good portion of how he and Meg showed each other affection, particularly in the early days when love and kindness were so foreign to them both.
Also, I’m pretty sure they can’t travel the length and breadth of space using the mycelial network,” Cas said wryly.
“I just think they’re amazing creatures. They’re just these little specks of nothing, but they’re so strong.” Cas grabbed his phone and pulled up a picture of the weird little animals—the real ones, not the
The question was about more than just undressing Cas. He didn’t know what he was allowed to do anymore, didn’t want to push too hard or too fast. Didn’t want to push Cas away again.
Dean bumped his knuckles against Gabriel’s and then shifted in his seat. “So, um, since it’s your show and all, could you get me into the studio to meet him, meet Dr. Sexy?”
Sam ripped off the paper and uncovered a computer magazine. It was the first issue of the subscription Dean had brought him.
“Fuck yes!” Fuck yes, he did. He wished Cas was there so badly. Dean’s hand sped up on his cock. His right hand was stroking his length while his left hand slid down from his chest to cradle his balls, two fingers pushing up against that sensitive spot just behind them, imagining the whole time it was Cas's hands on him.
“And what does a charming man such as yourself do?” Cas asked, presumably trying to introduce a normal topic so they could have regular conversation devoid of disturbing discussions about cock ring related injuries.
Cas’s fingertips skimmed up and down his shaft. Dean couldn’t tell if it was deliberate teasing or if it just hadn’t occurred to Cas to wrap his fist around him. Either way, it was having an effect on him. He couldn’t contain the needy whimper that fell from his lips. Cas looked rather pleased with himself at that. He was watching what he was doing intently. Cas tilting his head and looking at Dean’s dick studiously was another thing that Dean was going to file under endearingly weird, not to mention strangely hot. It occurred to him that this was all new to Cas. This aspect of the human body was unchartered territory for him, but damned if he wasn’t going to chart it. Cas’s thumb skated over the head of his cock where it was slick with precome. He looked fascinated by the droplets of liquid beading there, swirling the moisture across the tip in slow circles. He trailed his fingers down Dean’s shaft and moved lower to stroke over his sack, experimental touches that went from caresses to cupping the weight of Dean’s balls in his palm. A gentle squeeze made Dean moan. Cas smiled and looked thoughtful. Dean could practically see him mentally cataloguing that touch, putting it under the heading of ‘this feels good', learning his body and taking note of what he liked.
of his room. He figured that was Sam’s way of saying, ‘I’m cool with you kissing a dude, but you’re my brother and maybe I don’t need to see you kissing that dude quite so enthusiastically’. Which was fair enough, he had no interest in seeing Sammy get that carried away with a partner either.
Dean did his best to summon up his signature confident swagger and sauntered up to the man at the bar.
Cas thought back to that time years ago. He and Meg had been living together already, though in a worse apartment, in a worse part of town with two other roommates who were also the worst. Meg had been dating a guy who was majoring in something scientific at university, organic chemistry maybe, he didn’t remember. Meg’s then-boyfriend had been doing his homework at their place. She’d seen him drawing molecular structures and thought they looked cool, so she’d got him to draw some for her and used them to sketch out a tattoo.
After another couple of songs, Dean put on some Metallica to cleanse Baby of the taint of Taylor Swift. He felt much better once he was singing along to Whisky in the Jar and they drove the rest of the way to Duke’s with acceptable music playing.
Dean had texted Cas before he boarded to tell him when his plane was landing. Just so he’d know when Dean was back in the city, in case he wanted to make plans. Not because Dean had been having daydreams about an airport reunion, dammit. He certainly wasn’t envisioning Cas surprising him at the gate because he missed Dean so much and just couldn’t wait to see him. He definitely wasn’t imagining Cas running through Arrivals and jumping into his arms.
They joined Sam for breakfast in the kitchen before heading to the Dean Cave (‘I’m still not calling it that,' Sam insisted, in what was, frankly, a very Scrooge-like fashion). Dean had moved the wonky Christmas tree from the library to the Dean Cave, which was much cosier, and added some twinkly red and green lights to the tree, which he felt upgraded it from pathetic to festive. There was a scattering of presents around the base. The fact that there were presents at all was pretty rare and the fact that they were actually wrapped- no matter how messily- in bright Christmas paper was rarer still. It was a little slap dash but that was just the Winchester way. It didn’t matter, it was Christmas and he was here with his family. It was perfect and Dean could feel a giant, goofy grin spreading across his face as they all sat down cross legged in front of the tree.
“Can you...I want to...” Cas didn't seem to be able to express himself verbally at the moment. But that was fine, his hands were eloquent enough. They were gently tugging Dean’s shirt down over his shoulders, then raising his t-shirt over his head and ushering him to the bed. At Cas’s urging, Dean lay and Cas followed him down. He knelt above Dean’s prone form, hands stroking across his chest and stomach, eyes following their path. His touch was reverent and his gaze adoring. Dean’s pants weren’t even off and this felt like the most intense sexual encounter of his life. The way Cas was looking at him made it kind of hard to breathe.
Cas dominated his mouth, sweeping his tongue inside like he owned Dean’s whole body. He slotted his leg between Dean’s and thrust against him. It felt so good, so good, and not enough. Cas drew back, panting. He was looking at Dean like he’d never wanted anything more in his life. Dean wasn’t sure if he wanted to bask in that admiration or hide from it. He wanted it, he really did, but he wasn’t sure he deserved it.
There only seemed to be three possible outcomes when Castiel offered someone a leaflet about the Church and tried to engage them in a discussion about saving their souls. The response was usually polite disinterest, vague annoyance or outright mockery. Teenagers could be cruel and Castiel and his comrades, with their stilted speech and too formal clothing, were easy targets.
“You know, just because you’ve seen it in porn doesn’t mean that real lesbians feel the need to strap on a dick on every time they fuck.”
Dean hadn’t had a cell because there was no money for one. It wasn’t like his dad would buy him one like the other kids’ parents did. And any money Dean made himself—either through under-the-table jobs he was too young to be doing legitimately, mowing lawns, hustling pool or whatever else could earn him a few bucks—went on making sure Sam was fed and clothed. Bloody Sasquatch had always been outgrowing his old clothes.
Dean couldn't decide if he was annoyed about the magazine because of some weird impulse to protect Cas from anything that might be slightly sordid, or because he was the only one who was allowed to corrupt Cas. Probably the latter. It was Dean’s job to teach Cas about sex, not Sam’s and certainly not a porno mag’s. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to know what picture Cas was looking at. Either it was going to be something he wished Cas hadn’t learnt about from a magazine this early on in their relationship. Or it was going to be something he really freaking wanted Cas to do right now. Dean didn’t particularly want to spend the remainder of their gift exchange with an awkward hard-on while he tried to focus on doing Christmas bullshit instead of whisking Cas back to their bedroom. He wanted to do dirty things to Cas, god, so many dirty things, but he didn’t want to rush Cas into anything he wasn’t ready for. He only wanted to do those filthy things if Cas was comfortable and only if Cas knew what they were doing was in the context of a committed relationship. He still had this niggling fear that Cas might think that Dean only wanted sex. He needed Cas to know that, unlike the pizzaman and the babysitter, he truly loved him. Of course, the sensible thing to do would just be to tell him that, but since when did Dean do the sensible thing?
"Hey, you'd do the same for me," she answered, waiting for him to back up a bit before picking her steps back onto the gravel carefully.
The few workers inside seemed to be preoccupied with the closet, of which the new wall was a part, and blocked from their view, she hurried up the stairs.
Cas awoke with his head pounding, and the blanket that normally hung down the back of the couch flung over him. Something was sizzling.
"Are you okay, though?" Claire asked, as his eyes had adjusted to the darker room, he could easily see the concern on her face.
Ben shrugged, "I have no idea what's going on in there. But I'm going to get Mel out of the frosting, and Emma just wants you, she won't talk to me."
Alfie could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he realized Cas had heard him. Part of it was concern for his wife and his daughter while he was to be thousands of miles away, but also a fear that he'd be found out.
"I got her toy back, and when we got home, I put Cyndi down for a nap, then I yelled at my mom for a while, then she called me worthless."
"Somebody was bound to find it someday. I would have bet on Kevin  finding it first, but he'd know what it was."
"All these years and you still have odd behavior attached to money... I should've taken the therapist more seriously about that."
Kiddo is doing spectacularly, though, so if it weren't for major changes and general craziness, I'd be able to update this far more frequently.
Steps sounded on the front porch and Kevin jolted as Margaret suddenly stuck her hand up the back of his shirt at an angle that was obvious from the front door.
Cas lifted one of the large fried chicken breasts onto a plate of noodles, "Charlie's gotten a grant to have the district's computer sciences programs upgraded, and it'll be fully funded by some foundation, leaving money in the budget to be moved to arts and music. Also, they found a place to put Hannah, over at the high school, and far away from me. I'm very pleased."
Returning to the bed, she felt certain that she'd done the right thing in telling Dean, but it still worried her how Kevin's erratic behavior might effect the district's decision regarding her father's standing, as sexual misconduct would be at the forefront of the discussion. Her concern immediately following that, was the affect it would have on Kevin, being stuck in a stuffy room with a group of people asking uncomfortable questions, even if they were not directed at him.
"Ben?" Millie's voice came from the doorway to the back room as he was in the middle of typing a word, "You didn't tell me you were coming, what's up?"
"You know that wasn't... I wasn't trying to have fun back there, right? I mean it was supposed to look... uh..."
Making his way into the diner, it was slow, even for a weekday, and Julie was bussing a table one-handed, with Cyndi on her hip.
"Let me get used to being a passenger first, and I'll think about it. And then maybe you can show me how to take off a car mirror with my head instead of introducing myself to my neighbors like a normal person."
Dean bolted off the couch and grabbed the phone, only to hear hysterical laughing. "Okay, look-... What's... Claire?"
Hope that was everything. It's late, and I'm out of it. I'm sure I'll bring up anything I left out later on. Thanks for reading! FW)
By the end of the day, he was certain he was going to be completely drained, and Cas, who hadn't managed to make his way over the evening before, had had a suggestion for dinner that didn't sound too bad.
"Religious discrimination?" Dean repeated, looking up at the dark ceiling. Cas sat on the bench below the open window, Dean's head in his lap, stroking through his hair.
"Until daycare, or a sitter, or something? Or is she going to start helping me rotate tires?" Lucas asked, gesturing to the floor.
Margaret didn't see it as Dean shrugged, "Might as well finish the job, then. Can't repaint it if it's only half done."
"Hey, Cora," Ben said, "Just came to get my car, unfortunately, I gotta get this guy out of here, too. You okay?"
With a quick look at Kevin's now visible and very rumpled clothing, Alfie's tone changed immediately, "Did you guys get back together?"
"Well, yes, but he also happens to be my cousin. Something of a family secret, but I think you're old enough to be in on it."
"Oh my god, she's getting huge! As soon as you're sure she won't puke, I want a turn." Margaret leaned down near Claire's shoulder to get a look at Melody's face, touching her mostly bald head, "Still gorgeous."
Claire shook her head, "Lucius is not going to live forever. Somebody has to be ready to step in. He thinks he can let his dad think he's being controlled, while actually pulling one over on his dad."
"Well, he said he's seeing some girl named Margaret, so I guess he's over me. But if you want, I'll let Dean know so things don't get weird."
"Yep," Cora answered dismissively as she stepped past her, making her way toward the kitchen as she raised her voice, "Got your leftover goodies, Pops! Everything we can't sell tomorrow. I'll put the cold stuff in the fridge for you."
"It'll do," Crowley answered, moving aside, "Lucky for you boys, I was part of a very social fraternity. Hold it by his knees, and don't drop it."
"Then I'll quit." Kevin answered with a shrug, "Or step down, sort of. I'll keep working at the salon, and setting people up for intake, but they'll probably just shift the whole thing over to you."
"Except that you're part time, we're still going to need to use it when you're not here, and no one is going to drop everything to clean up to come look something up in the middle of a repair." Claire explained.
When the door finally opened, Ben regretted providing his niece with the frozen mess-maker, as Claire looked completely drained and red around the eyes, not up to cleaning up the goofy, messy child. Alfie, unfazed by the stickiness, accepted her excited hug without pause, picking her up right away, but as he turned to Ben, it was obvious he was concerned as well.
Bobby had pulled the large, square-based bottle from the bag and took a seat as John had leaned against the wall, studying Bobby carefully, aware the man usually only showed up when he needed something, or if John himself had called in a favor. Sam carefully placed two glasses on the table with a good distance between them and the edge, lest one slip and fall, one with ice the other without, and Bobby seemed almost cheery as he filled the empty glass before pouring a far smaller amount over the ice, "You figure he'll be back after a while, then?"
"There's several restaurants in the mall if you want to kill two birds with one stone," Cas said quietly in an attempt to recover.
"Ben's dream is medical. He needs it, or he won't be able to do it. But you, well... I mean, what's your plan, anyway?"
Alfie looked as though he was about to answer when the front door opened quietly, and looking up he saw Claire enter with the diaper bag on one shoulder, and the infant car seat in her hands. He didn't like the look of the folder that stuck up out of the top of the bag, and quickly got to his feet, moving around to the back of the couch, only finding his hands shook as he took the seat from her.
"So I've heard. I'm real sorry, but you weren't mine, I had to let him talk me out of it. That's no excuse, I know-"
Cas gave a small huff, "Melody has her father's artistic skills. Jaime covers things in glitter. At this rate, Lauren is likely to do both."
Deep thoughts had given way to a loss in tracking time, and Alfie was brought out of his many-layered reverie by a knock on the open door. Kevin wandered in far more sedately, his hair wet and his clothes changed, in the process of snacking on a large half-empty bag of potato chips, which he held out in offering to his friend.
With a nod, he pulled her into the shower, still keeping her close, resting his cheek against the side of her head as he turned her into the warm spray of water. Claire kept her arms around his shoulders, waiting patiently as he set a hand on her upper arm, close to her face before stroking some of her clumping hair back from her neck, glancing downward as he tried to decide how best to explain, "Um... I think this is about when the aggressive face-sucking started."
She narrowed her eyes at him, "You were always an obnoxious loudmouth, spouting off other people's business. Why didn't he hear it from you years ago?"
Dean left the shop early and headed home, still turning over the morning's long and awkward conversation with Cas in his head, even as he started dinner.
