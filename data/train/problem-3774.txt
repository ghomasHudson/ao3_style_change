As impressive as it all was, Castiel didn’t particularly like the child. She was precocious, and spoiled, and her parents didn’t seem to care about disciplining her. Not that Castiel was hoping for punishment, but a little guidance wouldn’t have gone amiss. They were worried about crippling her creative spirit, and gave her everything she demanded as a consequence.
“I’m taking you home,” Castiel promised, and led the way to the valet station so they could call Kevin forward. Dean nuzzled against his throat, and Castiel bit back the tears that threatened. They sat slightly apart in the back through the drive back to Dean’s house, and Dean began to look pale and exhausted. He still reached over as Kevin pulled up to the house, and gave Castiel a sad smile.
“Then I would have been shameless and Claire would never like me,” Dean responded cheerfully. “I would have told you all the parents take my personal cell and give me theirs just so I could call you.”
Meg found him in one of the local art museum, where the older and less contemporary works lived. She sat beside him on a bench and gazed up at the painting he had been staring at, a Romantic piece of half naked people laying around eating indulgently.
“So, you made up?” Charlie observed. Castiel pulled away and gave Dean one confused glance before looking over his shoulder at Charlie.
“Do I get a name? Or are you just drunken-guy-with-cocktail-umbrellas-in-his-hair-who’s-hitting-on-me?”
“Lucifer, that’s really not helpful right now. And nor is it helpful that you cancelled my deal with …”
“Um, if Charlie gives you shit tonight … I mean it’s not - she said she’s never going to forgive you. But that doesn’t mean … I’m glad you came.”
“What are your limits, Cas?” Dean whispered. Castiel shook his head, lost in the moment. And Dean let his hands wander further up Castiel’s legs, around to his ass. He slipped his thumb along the crack, listening to Castiel’s soft yelp, before finding the hole and easing his thumb in. It was hot, and clammy, but felt clean, and Dean let his thumb probe further in as he felt Castiel shudder around him. He tried to match the motion of Castiel’s strokes on himself with his thumb, going in and out at the same rate, careful not to add any more fingers, to keep Castiel just on the edge.
“Did you say something about breakfast? I can smell bacon cooking.” She made to crawl over Claire on the bed to climb out, but Claire stopped her, wrapping her arms around Alex’s neck as her girlfriend effectively straddled her.
Sam had boundless energy. He pulled Dean back up, embracing him in a hug that was full of angular limbs and endless enthusiasm. And then Dean found himself pulled along, into the house.
“Let’s make it interesting,” Castiel decided, ignoring the dealer and the other players. “If I win another hand, you’ll spend the next hour with me.”
“Yes. One of the committee. Not caring what you were saying, just listening to your voice, trying to work out what there was between you.”
He felt disappointed when all he found was a USB drive in the kitchen, with a small note in Castiel’s graceful cursive handwriting asking him to please watch without Sam. But he respected Castiel’s request and took the drive, and the note, into his bedroom. He plugged the USB into his laptop, and clicked on the video icon, plugging his headphones in as he did.
'Guys, come on, you had PB and J and didn't think I'd want any?' He smirked as he headed into the cupboard, raiding it for the few supplies they had. 'When did you last go grocery shopping?'
“Getting rid of the evidence before Sam sees it. If your English teacher asks, I gave you carrot sticks.”
He rested his head against Dean’s shoulder, staring up at the sky. Dean put both arms around him, holding him close. They would swap numbers later, arrange a time to see each other again, deal with their kids reactions. But for right then, Dean was happy to watch the fireworks with his gorgeous new man.
Castiel shook his head in exasperation, but allowed Dean to lean forward, kissing his neck gently. He zapped them away from the area, just in case they did desecrate it, and found somewhere more discreet, along a mountain range in Death Valley. Their clothes disappeared, and Dean started stroking down Castiel’s body, touching him with possessive caresses as his lips grazed the sensitive stretch of skin along his neck. Castiel arched his neck as he lay back against the sun-blistered dirt, and palmed his hands into Dean’s hair, holding his head in place as he swirled his tongue between Castiel’s collarbones. Dean’s body was already picking out a natural rhythm, sliding against Castiel, his legs sliding between his lovers and prising them apart, their groins tracing each others, their erections touching and sending jolts of desire through Castiel’s body. He made sure they were invisible to everyone who might stumble upon them, and hoped with every molecule of concentration he could spare that Gabriel was not watching them have sex. Because this time, they were going to. Castiel couldn’t go for much longer without Dean’s confident, insistent touch.
“I kept waiting for one of you to show up. Or for Dean to see my last text and come and disrupt the wedding.” Castiel admitted.
“So why do you think I would assume that just because you got your powers back you’d do that to me?” Dean leaned against his desk, arms folded, as Castiel tried to keep up with his phrasing. “I trust you, Cas, is that a mistake? Are you planning on wiping my memories right up to our wedding day? Some kind of plan to get the flowers you want or something? Help me understand.”
Dax wasn't slumped on the bed for long. His overthinking had an effect on his emotions, and for once, he had decided what he was going to do. He was the one acting. He began packing the few things he'd brought in from the camper van into his rucksack, and debated how to sneak away. He still needed gas, and he would need some money. Dax had a feeling that Sam and Dean had some squirrelled away somewhere. He just had to find where, and then take as much as he could in order to get far away.
Castiel resolved to do it. It was the scariest thing he thought he had ever done, but if it worked, if Dean was everything he hoped he could be? The pay off would be more than worth it. Before the month was out, he was at the very least going to talk to Dean Winchester. He would make himself do that much.
“I agree, love isn’t necessarily a feeling. I think that’s lust, that feeling. But love is powerful, it makes you do things you might not normally do because it’s right for the other person. It’s providing a room you never know will be filled, it’s writing letters knowing they’re not being read, it’s giving someone a second chance when they walked out of your life and putting it behind you and just looking to the future.”
It was snug, with animal pelts stored below the modest table. One corner was full of jars of wine, honey, fruit and a few salted meats as well as bags of grain, and opposite was the bed they shared. Sam sat opposite Dean at the table, his fingers moving nonstop as he poured some goats milk into a roughly hewn cup for his brother. It had been a long time since Dean had anything as simple as fresh goat’s milk. He sipped it slowly.
He was in bright daylight, in an empty grove. There were marble pillars holding up fine fabric streamers, and a small scrying pond in the middle of a range of marble benches, with a small pavilion almost centre stage. The air was fragrant with the scent of grapes and honey. Everything was still, and quiet. There was no longer a spear in Dean’s hand, nor a shield on his arm. The sword at his side had gone with his armour and helmet. Instead, he was in a soft tunic, white with a delicate gold key at the hem. He turned, frowning at his surroundings. Where had the soldiers gone? Where had
“I’ll have iced tea, please,” said Dean as he picked up his menu. It’s not like he didn’t already know what he would choose, but he seemed to need something to do with his hands.
Cas squats down to greet Casey when she comes running over, “What do you think, girl? You want a nice fence to keep you safe?”
Dean stands frozen, face pale, hands shaking slightly and eyes fixed on where Castiel is standing across the room. Of course, he knew Castiel was going to be here... It being his plan to attempt to speak to his ex and take some small step in the direction of amends...
“I think I’ll have the iced tea as well,” Cas said, as he looked across the table at Dean with a small, fond smile.
“Gabe will you listen, I caught a thief in our house tonight.” the look Castiel was giving Gabriel, made him stop in his tracks and frown slightly.
The next morning brings with it a man from the insurance company who has come to assist them. He is talking to them as they are being loaded into a van and taken to the airport. He explains that they are being taken back to the US and straight to a hospital there, so Cas can be checked over and have time to heal. Castiel is loaded carefully onto the plane still on a hospital bed, he is still very weak but recovering well from surgery.
“You don’t have to look at any more pictures if you don’t want to. I know it’s upsetting for you, we will try to work out what’s happened and let you know when we have some information. In the meantime, you should stay close by, try and get some rest if you can. The lists are being updated all the time, so if you have other family members here that are currently missing, you can check there, and hopefully, something will turn up.”
He hadn’t just decided on a whim to go either, he had done his research, (amusing himself with the thought that Sam would have been impressed with him for that at least) he’d picked that night because both Novak brothers had been invited to the charity event, Castiel wasn’t supposed to be at home. He wondered, for what could easily be the dozenth time... why Castiel hadn’t gone to the party?
Dean smiles and gives Castiel a tour of the apartment. They communicate using their phones and some sign language. Castiel signs what he can. The whole time, Dean feels he may burst. He can’t believe that the hot guy from the bar is standing in his apartment. Shit, he may become his housemate if all goes well.
“NO,” Cas cuts him off, “You’re fine. I don't have to be at work until eight tonight. I can sleep this afternoon. I’m enjoying having this time with you.”
“And right now, I am regretting that decision,” grumbles Dean, as he grabs the armrest on his seat and grips onto it tightly. The plane shakes slightly as it hits some turbulence and Dean’s knuckles turn white as he clutches onto the armrest for purchase. Dean looks back at Cas and manages an unconvincing smile, “how long until we land?”
Once they finish their meals they head back to the house. They are both smiling and having a good time together. Every time they looked at each other, they smiled, but when they turned away their smiles faded a little. Castiel would miss staying with his friends, he had enjoyed spending time with Sam and had grown very fond of Dean.
as Dean had learned, had smiled at Dean’s obvious flirting, laughed at his terrible jokes and occasional good one, and accepted Dean’s offer to buy him a drink.
“But…” Dean has run out of steam and out of words. He sits next to Cas and rubs his hand up Cas’s back. Cas pulls away from the touch and glares at Dean.
Castiel just rolls his eyes and takes a drink of his own beer. It’s not the first time they’ve argued over Dean’s flirty nature.
Resting for a moment to get his breath back, he looks up at Claire, “Stay there. I’ll be up in a minute.”
“I’m not used to shooting at people, or being robbed,” the thief squirms as Castiel dabs at his wound with a wet cloth, “don’t be such a baby, it’s only a flesh wound.”
“See you in the morning, Gabe,” Cas says as he turns around and heads past him toward the stairs. He takes off his jacket and lets it fall from his hand as though his brain had simply forgotten that he was meant to hold onto it.
“You’re new client is here. Want me to have one of the clerks bring him over or do you want to come meet him?” Chuck asks, also hinting at how busy the store is and how it would be easier if Dean came to get the guy.
When she finally gets tired of being on her feet, she makes her way back to the children’s tent to look for a place to rest. She finds herself a blanket and a quiet place and to lie down, trying not to think about how she is all alone. She doesn’t realize that she has fallen asleep until a hand gently shakes her awake. She opens her eyes expecting to see her papa waking her up and is saddened when it is the younger lady volunteer instead.
As Castiel reaches his own electrifying climax, he grips the back of Dean’s neck with one hand, holding him steady as he fills him with his come. He cries out and shudders against his lover, before regathering enough of his senses to reach down between them and grip Dean’s cock, tugging it a few times, until he hears Dean calling out his name and feels Dean’s come coating his fingers.
Dean wakes to the smell of bacon and coffee. He throws on his jeans and ambles to the kitchen. Cas is standing at the stove, wearing a pair of basketball shorts and an apron,  flipping pancakes. Dean slips up behind him and kisses his neck, his hands wrapping around Cas’s waist. Cas leans into the kiss.
Whilst Castiel is sleeping, Claire wanders away from his bed, looking at all the horrifically injured people around them. She manages to find the list of names downstairs in the main lobby, the list is very long and some of the names are scribbled in so un-neatly that she can’t really make them out. She reads all that she can, grabbing a chair to stand on, so she can see the top of the list, which almost reaches the ceiling. She doesn’t find the name of her dad or brother. She isn’t sure if that’s good or bad, maybe that just means that they are not at this hospital.
Claire nods and turns warily to the tree but just before she starts to climb up the tree she spots a soda can on the ground nearby. Castiel spots her looking at it and when she turns to him with questioning eyes, he nods at her with a small smile so she knows it is ok to pick it up. It’s unopened and they need something to drink. She hurries over to it and sticks it in the front of her swimsuit before she begins climbing the tree. Claire is able to scramble up the tree quite well.
Castiel lifts a hand, reaching blindly for his daughter as his heart hammers in his chest. Then his stomach drops as he notices Jack at the opposite end of the pool from his dad. Above the noise of the screeching birds, screaming families, and the rising roar of the thunderous wave about to crash down upon them, Castiel hears himself yelling. “DEAN!” he cries out, pointing wildly to where their son is cowering against the shallow sidewall of the pool, “GET JACK!”
Cas walked in wearing skinny black jeans, a black t-shirt, and eyeliner, his hair was longer than Dean had ever seen it. Gabe had always kept the kid in a near crew-cut growing up. Unlike Dean, who let Sam grow his hair however he wanted, one less thing to argue about.
Castiel had tried repeatedly to talk Gabriel out of letting the gallery borrow ‘The Angel’s Heart’, he’d tried to reason with him that he was tempting fate. The truth was, that ‘The Angel’s Heart’ was a fake, a beautiful, jaw-dropping, heart-skipping, and breath-catching fake… but a fake all the same. It had been painted by their grandfather many years ago. Castiel’s grandfather, who had the same mischievous streak in him as Gabriel had boosted to a rival collector about how he had found and purchased the original ‘Angel’s Heart’ but of course, this had been a dangerous fabrication, that had gotten completely out of hand when the local papers had taken notice and done a small piece featuring a photograph of the painting…
Ishim returns to the street late afternoon, he waits around until he sees Sam come home from work. He notices that Sam is quite punctual, leaving and returning at very roughly the same time each day. He has also taken note of the days that Dean is not home. It appears to Ishim that the man has a schedule of three days at work and two days at home, at home with Castiel. It makes his blood boil to think that Castiel is spending all of this time with another man But he tells himself to be patient, all he has to do is watch and wait.
Dean presses his lips to the top of Castiel’s head lightly and whispers, “There is nowhere else I’d rather be. Come on, we’re so close Cas, let’s do this together...”
“K… hold this, will ya?” Dean hands Cas his sketchbook and pencil. Cas takes them to the living room and places it in Dean’s messenger bag, then heads to the bedroom.
Cas watches the small creature struggle to breathe and move on the sand. He kisses the tip of his finger and gently touches the slimy fish on its head. “Be brave little fish.” He says as he stands to follow his brother.
The following month, Cas finally gets to go to class with Dean. For most of the class, he watches as the others work with the dogs. Dean has Cas hide his keychain to have Casey go find it - of course, she finds it right away, this thrills Cas, and he praises her and gives her a treat.
“You should have seen how he was carrying on when I was dressing his wound. I wouldn’t have wanted him to get an infection, but he was a bit of a baby about it.”
Castiel wakes up with a start, instantly aware that his throat is constricting. He struggles to take in a breath and makes disturbing retching sounds. His eyes look panicked and suddenly, he’s choking. Claire is by his side and yelling for help and a nurse quickly rushes over and rolls him to his side. As he starts gagging and trying to breathe, he clutches the side of the bed for support. Feeling his injuries pulling horribly as his whole body convulses. Coughing and gasping, he is desperate for some air. Even though he can hear Claire shouting his name and crying, he can’t respond. He feels large awful chunks of things coming up his throat and vomits out a frightening dark, bloody liquid. Bringing up seaweed and debris from the floodwater he had swallowed, while his stomach clenches painfully to help his body rid itself of the sickening detritus.
“I’m here, babe. I’m right here.” Dean leans down and plants a meaningful kiss on his forehead, whispering to him before pulling away, “You did so good Cas, so good.”
Cas always thought Victor was a jerk. Now, to receive this apologetic email from him was a shock. Castiel wasn’t sure if he wanted to know what was on the video. His mouse hovered over the attachment. He finally, after a moment of deep breathing, clicked on the link.
“Dear Mr. Novak,” Castiel reads in a shaky voice, “Oh God… It’s with great pleasure that I write to inform you that you have been accepted…” his voice cracks and he begins to mumble the rest of the first paragraph. “Dean. Dean, I - I’ve been accepted.” Tears well up in Cas’s eyes. Castiel twists around in his seat and kisses Dean full on the lips. It’s sloppy, and Castiel is giggling, neither of them can stop smiling long enough for a real kiss. Dean hugs him tighter.
Dean rolled his eyes, Gabe was a pest. Even if he is already eighteen and a Senior, he acts younger than Sam and Cas. Dean puts up with Gabe for Sam’s sake and because Cas is an alright kid. If he wasn’t Cas’s brother…
Dean smiles wide and begins excitedly telling Cas all about the class, he is in one of his hyper moods, and Cas just smiles and listens as Dean talks. “Casey is so smart, Cas. Oh, and look at the new keychain… I guess I need to put the apartment keys on here, oh and the studio and…” He pulls the grey and pink webbed cord from his pocket, “I wasn’t sure about the pink at first, but Casey loves it. She found it like a pro - oh, man and then when we took a potty break…” Dean continues to gush about the class while he pets Casey on the head and scratches behind her ears, not leaving out any details.
“Hi Charlie, Benny.” He shakes her hand and waves at Benny. “Thanks for coming. My feature is at ten, so I have a little time- “ He looks toward the bar and motions and nods, grabbing a chair and sitting in it backwards facing Dean, “You don’t mind if I join you for a few, do ya?”
“Well, that but also…” Dean looks down at the bed and then back up at Cas, with mischief glistening in his eyes, “our giant king-size bed.”
Cas still made the best grades and seemed to be able to make straight A’s without even studying. He was still basically a loner, now he just wore all black and let his hair grow out. His only real friend was the same kid he'd been friends with since grade school, a scrawny little nerd who skipped a grade, named Sam.
His voice is hoarse and scratchy from shouting, but he ignores it and coughs to clear his throat, before putting his hands around his mouth and shouting for his husband and daughter.
The comfortable black nothing that had gripped Castiel tightly doesn’t want to let him go easily and he has to fight with everything he has just to open his eyes. He thinks it would be easier to slip back into the nothingness, but then thoughts of his daughter alone and afraid push him to open his eyes.
When he finally gets his eyes open, he doesn’t know where he is, his vision is blurry but he can see people all around him. At first, he attempts to bat them away, thinking they are trying to harm him, fighting to catch his breath he struggles to push the hands off him. As his eyesight clears, he looks around and notices that he is lying on a mat on the ground. He watches the women around him, with wide eyes. Relief overwhelms him when he realizes that they are trying to help, he relaxes with a weak sigh and stops fighting them.
Bobby is about as touchy-feely with feelings as Dean is, so it surprises Dean when Bobby asks about Castiel.
“Hey Cas, glad to see you survived another day with Dean.” He jokes and peaks into the kitchen, “Hey Dean.” Sam heads to his room and comes out a few minutes later wearing sweats and a t-shirt, much the same as Dean’s attire. Castiel feels a brief flicker of envy that Dean and Sam can do something as simple as getting changed so easily, whereas he, battered and broken as he is, struggles massively just putting on a fresh pair of shorts.
Ishim cuts him off with a sudden, hard slap across the face, it makes Castiel gasp in surprise and pain and leaves his cheek stinging and heating up as Isham withdraws his hand.
“That’s stupid, Cas.” He reprimands himself, “Dean has always had time away from me, the whole time he lived at the Center, I was never jealous of other people spending time with him - was I?” He sits in the cab of the truck and stares at the white letters on the red sign -
Wanting to take Cas’s mind off everything that had happened with Ishim the previous day, Dean decides to take him out to look at cars. With Ishim being in police custody, there’s nothing they can do about him today; they just have to wait for someone to call them with the information as to when his court date will be.
“Sure, I’ll be glad to help any way I can.” Sam clears the table and put the dishes in the dishwasher. Then he helps Cas back to the living room.
“Shh, just hang on,” Dean whispers. Cas looks at him with big eyes and nods, his hands are resting on Dean’s hips where they had landed as Dean reentered the closet to steady him. Dean leans back and looks Cas up and down, “These clothes are terrible on you by the way.” he grins. He slowly leans forward again and plants a soft kiss Cas on the cheek, “but you’re still gorgeous.”
Dean pulls back, feeling breathless, he needs to keep his head in the game. He strokes his thumb lightly over Castiel’s face, giving him one final peck on the lips before telling him to wait while he quickly looks out the door again, at the painting. The lights of the alarm are off. The guards had actually disabled the security system. He hurries back into the tiny room feeling immense disbelief and stares at Cas in amazement.
“Hey Doc,” he greets the shorter man walking into the room.  “Dean’s been flinching and gripping his fists again this morning. That’s a good sign, right?” Cas looks at the bandages on Dean’s arms. Dean’s suit protected him from the fire - mostly - but there are burns on his forearms and lower legs. The beam had fallen across his legs and broke the femur on his left leg and the tibia and fibula on his right. Even with the oxygen tank and full face mask, he has some lung damage from the smoke.
“Come on,” he dropped her hand, and gestured towards the car. “Real Dad is probably going crazy without you at home.”
“I guess. I mean, I still work at the local garage part time, and Mom has her job. Charlie, Adam, Claire and Alfie are all old enough now. It’s just Ben and Mary that really need looking after. Never tell Claire I said that about her.”
“I can think of worse things.” Castiel smiled softly to himself. “I did want to talk about you though, Bear. About my honeymoon.”
“Uh-huh.” Dean said instead. Maybe he wanted to go back to flirting. Castiel did his best, still talking about the statue in front of him.
'Great idea, Gabriel. And thanks for getting Faith down. See you around. Come on Faith, we'd better check out of the motel.'
“I mean it, Bear. As much as that got under your skin, you kept your head. And I can see how it would when she was clearly boasting about an untruth, and making out that you were an awful person. You were smart not to react at the time, and to look for someone to talk to afterwards. It’s just bad timing with Alex. And … thank you for confiding in me.”
'You don't have to be scared, Faith.' Dax murmured. Faith folded her arms as her wings swept around her. 'Just because he says he's your father, it doesn't mean you owe him a thing. Guy's so drunk he probably doesn't know what the hell he's saying.'
“Only one time,” Dean shrugged. “The last night I had with him. He wasn’t the kind of man who took advantage of young men, he was more into my training. He was hard on me too. If I threw a discus fifty feet, he wouldn’t be proud of me, he would say it was a good effort at aiming for sixty. If he rewarded me, it was food he offered. And then one day, after the Band had already shown an interest in training me some more, he said I was a man now. That I would be going to my training the next day. And then it happened.”
She walked slowly up to the school, Alex by her side and Castiel not far behind them. Castiel hadn’t spoken much about the situation, but it was so clear that he was missing Dean. He had withdrawn into himself, reading the comic books and listening to Dean’s records, drinking beer rather than wine. It was almost as though he were using Dean’s passions to make up for his absence.
She forced herself to concentrate on work, even as moments from her dream seeped into her consciousness. His earnest smile, the way he traced her skin, the way even now she could feel a tingle where she imagined him touching.
'He's alive,' Gabriel said quietly. Faith buried herself into her father's arms, trying to block out the conversation. 'He'll need a couple of days to rest though. We need to find somewhere to keep him safe.'
“Yeah, good call,” he said, although his entire body language contradicted that sentiment. “What’re we doing this time?”
Kevin stopped his music and brought his cell out with him, locking up the car and walking with Castiel back to Dean’s house.
“I am a Winchester,” she reminded him. He nodded, his hair sliding into his face again. She brushed it behind his ears, trying to help.
Sorry it took me ages and this is all there is. Been working on my DCBB, and I wasn't happy with where this was going the first time around. Hope it's okay!
“Claire, I don’t want to interfere, or do Cas’ job for him, but I thought you and Alex were exclusive?”
“I’ll put her back to bed. Ben will lie down to go to sleep too. Alfie, finish your homework with Claire. Dean, I want you and Castiel in the kitchen. We will talk when the others are settled.”
'You got yourself up there!' Sam called back, and turned around, heading passed Dax to the door and leaving the building. Krissy looked between Faith and Dax, before hurrying down the staircase and following Sam out. Faith cocked an ear to the wall, and Dax knew she was listening for their footsteps.
Dean walked into the room, and sat at the edge of the bed, pulling his boots off. Faith looked away out of respect as he shuffled out of his jeans, and then he slipped under the covers as well.
“And I said I was sorry, I knew he wanted to take it slow, but I didn’t see a future without him. And he said that he didn’t want to take it back, that he thought it happened for a reason. So we are engaged. If that’s cool with you? We’re not going to rush into a wedding, even if I called it wrong.”
He glared at Faith again, who raised her chin and glared back, surprised when Dean squinted at her for a second, then paled out and turned away, hurrying over to a cupboard by the ice box and reaching in for a beer.
They had searched for about ten minutes after they finished eating before Claire found something she would agree to, and though Castiel clearly wasn’t enthusiastic for it, he agreed without hesitation. They drove to the next town and Castiel paid for them both to enter.
“No. I’ve barely seen Alex all day and everyone wanted to know what kissing a girl was like and if being gay was a family trait.” She scowled, and he smiled.
from the burn of his whiskey. And then they went back to the wedding guests, ready to pose for pictures. There wasn’t an official photographer, but Dean and Castiel had wanted guests to take pictures instead. They began posing on their own, and Jack approached Claire to watch.
‘You know Castiel, if Dean does that whole “baby, have whatever you want!” nonsense and you need help making a decision over the dusty rose or watermelon, I’m your girl.’ Becky cut through the atmosphere with her usual bubbliness. ‘I have so much wedding stuff left over from the decisions I had to make, and well, Charlie’s not that much better than Dean at the girly stuff.’
“You don’t get to talk to people about whether we’re really dating. Even your inquisitive assistant.”
'I've got room to focus on her and worry about you,' Dean shrugged. 'And I think I've had an idea for extra protection for her.' Dean kissed Castiel's lips quickly, and left the room, dialling a number on his phone. He looked around in the hallway, making sure he was alone as the person picked up on the other end.
“Love you.” Castiel cut the connection, and Dean flopped back against his pillow, just as he heard whispering and giggling and footsteps hurrying upstairs and along the hall. The whispering sounded like a man’s voice and a woman’s voice. And then there was a door slam. Dean got up, and went to check in Claire’s room, just in case his half-sister was dragging a boy home with her. Her light was off, the room was empty. The giggling was coming from his mother’s room, and he didn’t think before he swung the door open … to find his mother in there with Mr Ketch, clothes missing and both of them lost in the moment. He shut the door again instantly, wanting the image burned from his eyes. Again, he had the thought - he gave up time with Castiel for
Gabriel nodded, smirking at them, ignoring the glacial glares he was recieving from Castiel and Dean.
When he got home the next afternoon, it was to find a few young men in various ill-fitting suits lining the hallway leading to Michael’s office, all clutching resumes and looking fairly nervous. He passed by them all and pushed into Michael’s study, surprised to find that his eldest brother wasn’t home, and that Lucifer was in pride of place, interviewing one of the youngest applicants.
'Let her sleep,' Dean decided, wrapping his arms around Castiel's waist. 'We'll tell her when she's not dopey from a nap.'
'Is that an angel blade?' A small, high voice asked from the other side of Sam. He turned, and saw the small girl standing close beside them, her bright blue eyes locked on the triangular dagger. 'Are you an angel?'
'Don't drink that juice, Daddy. It doesn't taste good. It makes Mommy worried. We could play a game instead? Play a game with me, Daddy! We could play with the Barbies! Bear wants to as well!'
“That’s what … that’s … at the auction.” He couldn’t make himself talk about Dean, but he needed to say something. It was as though he had forgotten how to communicate effectively without mentioning Dean, but thankfully Michael seemed to remember their conversations just after it.
Dean gestured at him, as Mary frowned slightly, and Castiel realised that she had no idea who he was meant to be.
“You are a parent’s dream. Bear, let her know your boundaries. If she’s the girl who deserves the way you feel about her, she’ll accept it. She’ll understand.” He looked at his watch and sighed. “My lunch hour’s over. I have to go back down. Do you want to come?”
There was no sign of their kids as they re-entered the house, and when they got to the kitchen they managed to grab two of the last few beers before trying to mingle with everyone else. The karaoke had stopped, and everyone was in Jody’s front room, dancing to loud music. Dean pulled Castiel into the throng, and then started grinding up against him, almost twerking against Castiel’s leg. And for all of Castiel’s skills in the bedroom, he was a fairly solid Dad dancer. Dean put his hand on his waist and guided him, trying to help him out. They soon got into it, necking their beer, dancing together, getting shoved closer and closer by the other dancers. Neither minded, wrapping their arms around each other and dancing closer together.
“I suppose you would be my eromenos, my own personal one. You would live here with me, help with my fathers bees and crops, watch over eromenos with me to keep them safe and happy. If you wanted to stay active and use your soldier’s training, I could see whether Ares might perhaps want your service? I wouldn’t hold you to anything you wouldn’t want, Dean.”
“Well, okay. But board games aren’t so fun with just two people. Maybe Dean could come back over and play with us?”
Castiel looked up at Dean, who was bringing a stack of pancakes over to the table. They made eye contact, and Dean shrugged.
“Rather work them out than lose you,” Claire admitted. Alex slipped off the side of the gazebo and walked closer, keeping their tentative eye contact.
'I'm sorry, Faith. I'm doing this for you, and it must be done.' He hugged her hard, and they stood together for a long moment, before he detangled himself, and went to stand with Sam. 'We'll see each other soon.'
“Oh my God, you’re that girl that slept with the principal!” His voice carried across the store, just as the door opened and closed again. The other occupants of the store seemed to hold their breath while they waited for how Claire was going to react.
Castiel knelt down in front of her, gently brushing her hair behind her ear. He didn’t seem to have any words, and Claire was grateful. He was the one who could break her resolve.
Once in the suite, Meg started poring over the flowers and champagne that the hotel had provided for them as Castiel headed into the bathroom. He locked himself in, and stared at himself in the mirror as he had done that morning, focusing on his eyes. He still felt disjointed from his own reflection, was still looking for answers. He was now a married man, married to someone of his alleged status. Someone he didn’t love. No wonder he didn’t recognise himself. He checked his cell phone, but there were no new messages, nothing from Dean. The number had to be correct, it was still part of the conversation thread that appeared with Dean’s older messages. He turned his phone off, and slowly stripped off the wedding outfit, leaving it in a messy pile on the floor and stepping into the shower, turning it as hot as he could bear and standing under the spray. Maybe the heat of the water would wear him away and he could melt into the shower drain and become nothing more. Maybe it would blister his skin and make him feel something, anything other than the numbness that had been sinking in with every moment that Dean didn’t come back.
Claire turned and looked at her father, who stood on the edge of the entrance like he wasn’t welcome to come in.
She looked over in time to see the small smile on her dad’s face. The first time she had seen him truly happy - truly anything - in years. She wanted to hate him and curse him and ban him from Mr Winchester, but that smile made her realise just how long her dad must have been unhappy.
Dean wrapped his arms around her shoulders, pulling her tightly against his chest, kissing her hair as Castiel reached over and encircled them both, mindful of Faith's wings.
“So, you must be curious why I’ve tried to arrange a meeting?” Mr Winchester smiled at Claire. She glared back, slouching in her seat. She could feel her father watching her and refused to meet his eye. It would be like agreeing she had done something wrong and for once, she hadn’t.
“You’re the one watching me pee when you should be prancing about, pretending you don’t know half the dads in the audience have a hard on for you.” Claire bit back. One of the other cheerleaders spat in her hair.
“You’re in a good mood,” Dean acknowledged. “So tonight is all about gossiping and eating crap and making me and Castiel stay in our bedroom like that’s a punishment?”
Alex smiled at the screen, and grabbed a cushion, tucking it under her chin. Claire inched closer to her girlfriend, their arms touching, as they watched the final segment of the show. It wasn’t quite Claire’s thing, but Alex seemed happy, and she was just glad that, after such a fraught start to the day, she could spend time with someone who made her feel content. Alex reached over as the credits rolled and turned the show off, putting YouTube on the television and starting a music mix instead. She dropped the remote and then took Claire’s hand.
“I’m sorry, Claire,” she turned to the girl with the note and sent her to detention, then carried on with the lesson. Claire’s whole face was burning as she made notes on the topic at hand. She felt in her pocket for the pass Dean had given her. He’d never asked for it back, she’d never gotten rid of it. As soon as the bell rang she was out of class, heading to his office. She showed the secretary, Ms Milton, the pass and was shown the wait sofa. Dean was still in his meeting.
“Cas?” Dean loosened his hold on his angel, trying to look at him, make some eye contact, find the truth out that way. But Castiel clung on to him, as though he knew that once this conversation was done, they were over. Dean couldn’t imagine what Castiel could possibly say to make him leave now.
“Michael told you I was a fan. I was on the committee for the art award you won. I pushed for you. I’d seen you working, watching from a balcony as you pushed your creations into place. I’ve followed your career from afar for a while. And then Michael insisted I do all these functions and Luke said it was best if I stopped effectively stalking you, and I thought, maybe I could. Maybe if I invited you to come with me, it would mean I could stop just admiring you and start getting to know you.”
“Me too,” Claire grinned. “I’m definitely not spending tonight with my grandparents, so it just depends when Dad lets me go.”
“I know. I know.” Dean managed to ease her back. “But think okay? If you go hitting them because of the things they say, it just validates it. You know I like your dad, you know how you feel. Don’t fuel it.”
He found himself in the kitchen, selecting a beer, as Jody and Donna led a round of karaoke in the next room. Normally both could carry a tune, but with the flowing alcohol and already infectious mood of the party that Dean could feel seeping into his skin, they were a little pitchy. Dean leaned against a wall and listened to them screech through a Whitney Houston number as he sipped his beer.
She grabbed her plate and left before Castiel could give an answer, and took her food into the study, plugging back in to her music and trying to push Jack out of her mind.
“I’m good. Very good.” She felt him press his lips against her temple, as Dean called across the room.
“I told you, I was done with missing you both. You’re family, as much as Sam is. And you always knew that.”
'You've never seen my porn. Besides the point,' he waved a hand as she prepared to fully blow up. 'Faith, I was there last time, with Mary. I was with her every step of the way. And I will be with you, too. If you need me there when you talk to Dean and Castiel, I will be. If you want me to break the news myself-'
“I don’t think either of us consider it to be a mistake,” Castiel said slowly. “Unconventional, but not a mistake.”
“You weren’t,” Castiel said quietly. “I thought maybe your drink was spiked, but I didn’t want to say anything if it wasn’t true. It’s been confirmed recently though. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“No,” Castiel shook his head. “Do you wish to see what happened? I could explain it, but I think you would trust the scrying pool more than me right now.”
'What about Dean?' Gabriel nodded at the man Faith had snuggled up next to. She cuddled further under his arm.
He stood her up, and led her into his bedroom, opening his closet and reaching towards the back of the top shelf, pulling out a floral shoebox that Claire recognised. She had never pried, she had assumed Amelia kept shoes in there. Castiel was holding the box cautiously, almost caressing the sides of the box.
“Yeah, it’s pretty cool up here. So, um, Manny’s agreed to have some of you in his house, Cas and me don’t have the room for everyone. Is that cool?”
“He means that, with a Grace, you’ll always have to answer to Heaven, to an extent. You’ll feel the pull, you’ll be unable to resist Gabriel’s demands when he wants to speak to you, and the same goes for God. Whatever Father would want from you, you will do it without any question.”
“Amelia knew everything, Claire. I just wish she had met a man who could have loved her the way that she deserved, even for those last few years.”
'Here's how this is going to play. You're going to confess to everything, or you're going to get the Winchester treatment.'
“You wanna join the dyke brigade there, fine, but watch your mouth around me, freshman.” She narrowed her eyes at Kaia. “Are you looking at my boobs?”
The town was one of those quaint little ones, full of rustic style stores and throwbacks to the fifties, like her dad’s book store. Which meant that there was nothing good to do when you were nearly sixteen and unable to drive and living downtown over a store. Claire found her way to a cheesy retro diner, and once she established that her dad wasn’t in there, went inside and ordered a burger and curly fries with a chocolate shake. Her food had just arrived and she was taking a huge bite out of her burger when Alex walked in with a couple of other popular kids. She groaned internally and focused back on her meal, hoping they didn’t see her, or try to talk to her. She was officially done with people.
“Besides, I can’t be mad at my bestie for long, can I?” She pulled her hair to one side, and Claire watched its progress again. Her hair was like a black waterfall, and hypnotic. “What are you doing Monday night?”
“Cassie! Winchester! To what do I owe the pleasure?” He bit the end of the cigar, and chewed at the side of his mouth as he spoke out the opposite corner. “You giving me a formal invite to the wedding? I bet Cassie did decoupage and edged with lace, right?”
“I don’t know,” she said slowly, trying to ignore the way Jack’s smile dimmed when she didn’t jump at the chance. “Maybe Jack and I should hang out today, and then I could let you know?”
“Yep, and you don’t get the obnoxious comments afterwards,” Claire pointed out. “I have to hear it at home too.”
“Sorry Claire, I didn’t know the A stood for Ace. That you are one. That I upset you. I wasn’t trying to do that.”
Chuck gestured across the whiteness. They all looked, and Gabriel suddenly appeared, holding the hand of a small girl. Her hair was as dark as Castiel’s, her eyes as green as Dean’s, and there was something regal and graceful in the way she moved, though a contented happiness seemed to blaze out of her. She seemed young and old all at once as she approached their group, still clinging to Gabriel. Her eyes fell on Faith and she beamed.
Dean peered around at Claire momentarily, and she shook her head, aware her father was clearing his throat once again. Dean looked right back at Castiel, and brushed another tear away with his thumb. When Castiel started speaking again, it was clear he was crying, his voice had taken on a shaky quality, and was slightly nasal.
“Yes. And it’s perplexing because I was always informed it would be different, and I’m not sure how to handle this. It feels like it could cause problems.”
Castiel sighed heavily, and walked further away from their camp. Dean followed, wondering what exactly Castiel was going to reveal. Was Castiel being punished for keeping their daughter from him for a decade? They stopped after a few minutes walking, and Castiel sat on a fallen tree. Dean perched beside him, waiting.
“It’s fine. I didn’t think Michael was so big a dick.” Dean seemed breezy as he spoke, and Castiel wondered again what there was between his eldest brother and the artist. “I was worried about you, I mean, how many more things are they forcing you to go to?”
“This is just a small debriefing over what happened yesterday,” he promised. “A chance for Claire to explain herself calmly, and we can work out how to go forward.”
But she still reminded him so strongly of his kid, and of Castiel! The way she jutted her chin out earlier with her sense of self-righteousness, he'd seen Siobhan copy Castiel when he did that a hundred times. The way she tilted her head as she considered something, the way she smiled without realising, a smile just like Castiel's. How could it be anyone else?
He knew it was perhaps frivolous to enjoy the arts as he did, but he didn’t care. He had no interest in hedge funds and stock markets or company performance, but seeing the way people behaved in film, seeing their lives panned out so completely within such a short time frame, the promise that things would be okay … it was enchanting. He got lost in Cary Grant, in Audrey Hepburn, in love and loss and misunderstandings until he fell asleep on the yacht’s bed.
She still had private moments with Alex, though neither of them had mentioned love again. Claire did debate it, she would look at her girlfriend as they hung out at either of their houses and have so many questions buzzing in her head about what it must feel like and how was Alex so sure, and maybe Claire loved her right back because a relationship wasn’t high on her list of things, or kissing, or holding hands; and yet their relationship meant so much to her and maybe that was all you needed for love? Or maybe it was as easy as the way Alex had put it, and just by dating each other Claire was halfway to being in love.
Even when the humans in the scrying pool left their own celebrations, the party on Olympus continued. Castiel merely touched the water, showing the next pride celebration to occur. They were going to celebrate the entire month.
“Who knows? You’re the first living human to ever take on a Grace. The few souls we’ve done this with were already long dead.”
Kevin had delivered Castiel to Dean’s house half an hour before the time they needed to leave. He felt less nervous than he would have expected, the excitement of spending time with Dean was enough to calm him slightly. He resolved that, this time, if Dean were to hug him, he would hug right back.
“Will you be my best person? When Dean and I get married?” He seemed flustered, nervous, as though he thought for a second Claire would suddenly no longer accept her principal as her stepfather.
Castiel came with her in the ambulance, but she still wasn’t talking properly, as though all her snark had been knocked out of her with every punch. Dean agreed to drive Jack in the Impala, and Claire was grateful that they would be around, but that she had her father with her. He held her hand and wouldn’t let go for the entire ride in the ambulance, or in the emergency room where they ran tests and ordered x-rays. She had no idea how to say how much it meant to have him there, but from the way he gave her fingers a gentle squeeze and talked in reassuring tones, she figured he knew.
“I am too,” Claire assured her. The adults all ignored them to chatter amongst themselves, until Dean finally had the sense to introduce everyone.
'She won't be successful in attempts to remove the foetus. It will have angelic properties. You could kill hundreds of surgeons trying.'
“Yeah. I mean no. I mean … wow. You didn’t tell Charlie, it would have been the first thing she’d blab about.”
"What's going on?" Becky interrupted. Sam told her as quickly as he could, and turned back to Castiel before Becky could ask questions of her own.
Claire gave a nod and a shrug at the same time, and followed him out of the door, waving goodbye to Castiel as they went. She slid into the Impala, and did up her belt as Dean climbed in. He hadn’t given her many rides but he loved to work his muscle car and she knew he didn’t drive gentle. It was like Dean imagined he was in the Indie500 or something.
He left his bedroom, and looked around for any sign of gifts, any birds or pear trees or dancing girls. The bunker was clear, of everything but Sam reading through a book in the main meeting room.
She woke one morning to the sound of voices downstairs. It wasn’t her father’s day off, and Jack had a placement for his study, so she was a little surprised to hear anyone. She crept along the hallway, hoping it wasn’t someone taking advantage of a supposedly empty house. As she got closer, she heard the voices, and recognised one as Dean’s. It was strange that he wasn’t at school, but as Principal, Claire supposed he had some perks to the job.
He heard the low rumble of a car, and looked outside, spotting Dean’s black car swinging into his driveway. He hurried to the front door as Dean stepped out of the car, and then he was barreling across his porch, colliding with Dean on the steps in a tight embrace. Dean held him so tightly that he could barely breathe, and he didn’t want to be anywhere else except in those arms.
“It was a long time ago. And maybe I’m not the same person I was then. Things change, you know? I don’t think Jess would recognise me now. Maybe it’s better that I remember how she was back then, instead of wishing for what she might be now.” He shifted her in his arms, and she wondered if she was getting too heavy for him. “Same goes for Dean and Cas, Faith. I know you grew up painting a picture of how your parents should be, I know the reality is a lot different. But they are who they are and the best thing you can do is love them for that, whatever they’re like together. They love you, that’s the important thing.”
Claire started walking back to the book store, looking over her shoulder at Kaia heading into the diner. Dean had mentioned the club in passing, but it was strange to think people wanted to meet up and talk about not being hetero. She didn’t like the idea that Kaia was subtly putting out there, that she should somehow be in charge because of Dean, or because of her relationship with Alex. She still wasn’t sure whether she was actually a lesbian - how could you tell when you weren’t really attracted to anyone? Surely Dean didn’t think she was any kind of role model or poster girl for being gay?
“I’ll go make her some tea, okay?” Dean said quietly, though his eyes were sparkling. Claire held her grandmother’s hand as she came around, her grandfather hovering in the doorway. Dean returned with a mug of tea, and placed it on the coffee table behind Claire. “I’m almost done with my work, you want me to look out for her while you go back to the store?”
I was listening to the song listed as I wrote Dean and Castiel's first dance. It's so pretty, and I'm going to guess featured on Dean's mix tape in canon!
Meg is good company, but it wasn’t the same as you being here. I hope you had a good evening. See you soon.
He squeezed her closer against his side for a moment before letting go. She felt like crashing down on one of the loungers without him there. What was she going to do? The nice thing was to help Jack, but it felt like how every dream started. She could see how the dream would go, like a low rent movie where they would help each other with sunscreen as a version of flirting.
She headed into his bedroom, some time in the early hours of the morning. He was asleep, wearing just his boxer briefs and a tee, the covers kicked down the bottom of the bed. Claire climbed into the space he left, and pulled the blankets back over both of them, and wriggled under one of his arms.
“Huh. So objectification is one sided in this marriage?” Dean bent down and licked one hipbone that jutted out, and nibbled along the other before nosing his way into Castiel’s pubic hair. Castiel sucked a deep breath in as Dean’s nose traced along his growing cock, his tongue sliding out to lick the slit at the end, and he started thrusting up again, trying to engage Dean in more than just teasing. Which he was still doing despite his earlier promise.
The stranger chuckled as they headed outside of the hotel-casino, and into the main strip where the lights blurred and gave a nice, fuzzy feeling.
“Are you kidding?” Dean smirked. “One time she took me to her little LARP group, made me her handmaiden, and then tried to hit on the girl playing a fairy. She made me wait outside their tent while she made her move.”
'I know, girlfriend, but the angels wanted me to talk to you. And Sam called me on my way over, he wants me to talk to you too.'
'I don't know, Faith. I honestly don't. I'd love to know what happened that day. Don't blame yourself either.'
“Eat me.” Claire responded, and resumed what she had been doing before Dean walked in, which was Sharpie-ing her nails black. Dean made a face at Castiel, and walked on.
“I don’t know how I blew it with you,” Dean continued. “I don’t know what I did or said to make you think I would be that guy. Last thing I knew was that we were both excited about seeing each other without money being an issue. I had dates planned. So, I just wanted to say I’m sorry.”
Dean was suddenly kissing him desperately, their combined memories seeming to be the trigger. Castiel could sense his need for physical contact, for some way to make their connection tangible for a brief moment, and he obliged. Making sure they were both still invisible to the human eye, he neatly removed their clothes, and attempted to move them both, to work it so that Dean was on top of him, pressing his weight down on his body. But Dean resisted, his hands flying to Castiel’s back, securing him within his arms, pulling him closer.
Claire hit the ball, and they both watched it sail through the right side hole in the castle, and circle around the lower green at the back, stopping just beside the cup.
John gave another grin, patted Castiel’s shoulder, and gave Dean another brief hug before returning to the Mary in his memories. Castiel was the one to return them to earth, not far from Sam and Becky’s house.
Sam shook his head in bemusement, not letting Castiel in on the joke. Cassidy had seemed too easy to begin with. This was going to be a cakewalk.
'I remember. I thought I was dying. Unless I'm in Heaven?' Junior thudded his head backwards against the couch cushions.
'Shi-Faith,' Castiel forced himself to correct it this time. 'Do you honestly not remember any of your childhood?'
“Cas?” Dean looked around the room in wonder, the scantily clad women on the stage and poles gyrating nearby. Castiel signalled for two drinks from a nearby waitress in hot pants and a cropped vest, and leaned closer.
“Next time you want to take my brother out, can you please go through me so I can make sure Dean doesn’t have anything else on?”
“Claire, I don’t know everything, but I know an unhappy kid when I see one. We’ll be patient with you, but I hope you’re not going to take our kindness for granted. We should make a deal.” He finally brushed his powdered sugar off his hands and mouth, but missed the spot on his nose. “You make a friend, you listen in class, and I will let you off doing homework.”
Dean’s family had let loose on the strip of sand that made up the beach of Hope Island. Castiel and Dean remained at the back of the beach, sitting on the boulders of a rock pool and watching the kids who were playing with the ocean, some for the first time ever. They were soon joined by Gabriel, Emmanuel and Chuck, who had brought some drinks with them, splitting a case of beers and watching as Mary ran in and out of the sea with Alfie.
The house was still, the air full of sleep, like an enchanted castle from a fairy tale. Claire took the time she was waiting for Kaia to look around at the artwork on the walls, her footsteps muffled by the thick carpeting. She was glad to be back in her jeans and button down shirt. The best person dress had been right for the wedding but she felt much more like herself in her normal clothes. Kaia soon joined her, looking as relieved to be in a sweater and yoga pants. They headed downstairs together, Kaia as quiet as Claire as though she could feel the same sense of enchantment hanging in the air, and they waited until they were outside, away from the building to start talking, their voices still low in case it carried through the vast empty fields surrounding the house.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but happily pulled Dean down into a kiss, his fingers knotting into Dean’s shirt as his fiancé flopped down onto him, pressing him into the mattress. Castiel listened to Dean’s thoughts, which were coming fast and muddled, overlapping each other. How beautiful Castiel was with his grace, how good their kisses felt, what he wanted to do right then. For all of Castiel’s anxieties, it was a relief to hear Dean so wild, so determined to love him. He put everything he had, every emotion he felt for Dean, into their kiss, their mouths barely able to make contact, their teeth clicking together almost violently, Dean’s breath already laboured and his own breathing catching up fast. He almost felt light headed as Dean’s fingertips grazed over his abdomen, his skin tingling from the touch, almost recoiling from the intense pleasure he already felt.
“When will we? I think we need to.” Alex defended herself. Claire met her eye. She heard the change in tone that implied that maybe, just maybe, Alex was starting to accept they were over.
What the hell, Cas?! Yeah, definitely a stupid idea to swap your own life for the kid. What was he even thinking?
They stood there for several more moments before Castiel felt he could walk away. As they walked, Emmanuel kept his hand on his shoulder, trying to soothe the ache inside Castiel’s chest.
“I don’t know, I have an itch. And Becky’s back at the hospital already. I’m bored. And I got on my laptop and this case came up. Want me to email you the details?”
“Jack’s responsible, Dad. And Auntie Kelly’s going to be around too. We’re not going to be alone for long.”
“We should have watched them closer. But they were older and we’ve been helping so many other boys,” Castiel sighed, and placed a tender kiss on the crown of Dean’s head. “I think Sam went first. He did it on purpose, knowing Gabriel was near the end.”
'Jesus Faith, and in your condition. You should stay with us until the baby's born. Where's Dax anyway? Don't tell me that boy ran when you told him you were having his kid.'
He pressed a kiss to the back of her head, gave her shoulder another squeeze and turned to help a new customer figure out the book they were after from the colour of the book jacket. Claire gestured to the back door and took the bag from her grandfather, leading the way through the back of the store and up the connecting stairs to the apartment.
“You have to go back, you can’t let them win! Kaia and Patience have been over my place almost every day after school, planning how we’re going to make this work for the LGBT club. If you’re not there,” Alex tried to reign her emotions in. “You’re a part of it all, Claire. And those bitches are going to think it’s okay what they did to you.”
Claire didn’t respond. She could see what her dad was saying, but she also felt like they had been through plenty. The fact that he couldn’t see how he had already paid his penance and was getting his reward now baffled her, but she knew she couldn’t make that argument. Instead, she tweaked the handkerchief in his breast pocket and smiled at him.
“They’re not wonderful. We can look to the police to help look for the person or group taking it, but most of the time you don’t get the money back.”
“I knew he wasn’t nowhere near good enough for you. If I didn’t think you could handle yourself, I would have dealt with him years ago.”
“Uh-huh. Bye already.” Dean slipped a hand around Castiel’s elbow, adding enough pressure that Castiel knew he wanted to go. “Come on, Cas, she already proved she wasn’t worth it when she stole your money and tried to get a divorce before she got caught.”
I'm double posting today, partly because I've finished writing it now and partly because I feel like chapters 18/19 are pretty short compared to what I have left. Hope you enjoyed them! The angst is almost over ;)
“Yeah? Wouldn’t be the first time Cas has had a well-meaning idea that’s gone awry. At least this time, he got you out of it. And Dean. It’s what he wanted.” He caught the expression on her face at his last comment. “Oh, no, Faith! Dean wouldn’t even think of touching him if the feeling wasn’t mutual. Dean wanted it too, once he got used to the idea. As soon as he heard Cassandra was in danger, he went to get you, and when we thought we lost you, he couldn’t get over it. Not until you came back. And I missed you too. My shirt-stealing, Disney-loving, adorable little pain-in-the-ass niece.”
“So, Sam and Eileen aren’t here or I’d let you see them as well,” he said as he walked outside, and climbed onto the hood of a beautiful sleek black car. “And that’s my family.”
'There was, at the time of your birth, one nephilim and four antichrist born. I'm to watch for any sign that you are either. If you're one of the options, you'll be back with your real family. If you're the other, you will be terminated.'
“They’re not nightmares,” Claire’s voice was small. She still didn’t want to admit what was going on, didn’t want to ruin the plans during Castiel and Dean’s honeymoon. “They’re just really vivid.”
“It’s okay. You can buy the beers after.” The shorter, stockier one laughed. He adjusted his flat cap, and they grabbed the sculpture once again. Castiel was intrigued. Edith was one of the gallery directors, so if one of these gentlemen knew who she was, then they needed to be there. Maybe the gallery was restructuring its contemporary wing. If Castiel could stop hiding behind this formaldehyde - oh gross, formaldehyde horse - and get into the board room, he would find out exactly what was going on. But he didn’t want to be caught by these two men, to be accused to theft or worse, be recognised for who he really was. There was nothing more terrifying than being called out for being born a Novak. It would be best if he could slip by unnoticed, but whatever the structures were made of, they seemed heavy and awkward. Both men looked as though they lifted weights frequently, and they both kept pausing as they moved across the room.
She sat up, and let him put an old black-and-white movie on the old box television as they shared a pint of Ben and Jerry’s.
“Sympathy, yes. Lots of sympathy. Breaking the law when I’m still your principal? Not so much.” Dean said pointedly. “Can you set the table too? This is nearly done.”
She blinked the sleep away and focused on Alex, who was putting a couple of books onto the coffee table in front of them, and then picking up Castiel’s book.
Castiel listened to Sam walking away, and Dean sitting in the chair opposite, and he tried to gather that courage that he needed again.
Dean appeared a couple of minutes later, his expression tight but he greeted Claire like he normally did. They drove to the bookstore, and greeted Castiel before Dean followed her up the stairs to the apartment.
Michael had also reassured him at dinner one of the first nights there, that Luke wouldn’t be able to get his hands on anything else in the house. That a locksmith had been called, and new security hired to protect what existed in their mansion. Castiel was grateful, because the idea of losing his art on top of everything was too much. His brain couldn’t process it.
“I don’t see any reason why she won’t. Thank you for coming in, I hope it didn’t inconvenience you too much?” They both stood, and walked out together, barely noticing whether or not Claire trailed behind, listening to them crawl up each other’s butts with the flirty compliments.
“And that’s Dadspeak for ‘yes I want to have that too, Dean, but do you have to be so inappropriate in front of my teenage daughter?’ just to clear that up for you, Claire.”
'When my father returned, Dean, I found a new purpose. And I found hope, because He said there was a chance she was still alive. I didn't want to tell you just to build your hopes up. I wanted to bring her home. And I have done, in a way. So you could thank me.'
'She's not doing it,' Dean asserted himself. 'She's not getting chewed up by some whale, or-or, I don't know, curing people of leprosy-'
“I wanted to let you know that I’ve taken your comments on board. And you can give me some advice on whether or not these are any good.”
Dean hadn’t been so drunk the night before that he couldn’t remember anything, but he had definitely been drunk enough to make some questionable decisions, decisions that came back to him as his sleep ebbed away.
They stared at each other once again, Castiel feeling like his veins were on fire. He pulled Dean out of the room, into a hallway that they possibly weren’t meant to be in, and before he could overthink it, before he could regret any of it, he pushed Dean up against the wall and pressed their mouths together. Dean’s lips caught at his, his arms winding their way around Castiel’s waist, and Castiel groaned, resting his hands on Dean’s chest, relishing the feel of their lips together, the way Dean’s mouth began to move. He pulled away, worried Dean was trying to tell him off, but Dean tugged him right back against him, making sure they were kissing once more.
“The latest entry in Castiel’s spank bank.” Gabriel grinned. Balthazar looked, and then gave a big whistle.
As Dax spoke, a doorway opened up in the hillside just up the road from them. From their position, they could see the yellow glow of the inside of the building spilling out of the open doorway, a the tiny figure walking out, and dumping a small square … something on the floor before walking out again.
The one small perk of being a billionaire with the connections that Meg and Castiel had was that they could breeze into the hotel and be directed to their room straight away, a bell boy taking care of their luggage and the chauffeur - not Kevin this time - having checked them in and sorted out paperwork. Though Castiel normally hated the trappings of their world, he was relieved to have this advantage for once, as it was less to deal with, and the wedding had been more than enough.
Dean did something he wouldn’t have normally, that the army may not have approved of: he stepped forward and curled against Benny, their breastplates clashing together. He pawed at Benny’s arms, trying to put them around his torso, suddenly desperate for their closeness. Benny held him at arms length for a brief moment, before leading him away from the others for some privacy.
He dropped another kiss onto her forehead, gave her another squeeze, and then let go to check if his customers needed a coffee top up. Claire hadn’t been given homework that day, and she didn’t want to be alone, so she decided to help out with her father, refilling the coffee beans in the machine and taking her spot by the cash till.
“Sure we won’t,” Charlie answered, sounding very much like she would stay up all night just to ask Dean all about the night’s date. Dean took Castiel’s hand and led the way to the car, and Castiel’s heart leaped at the contact. He hadn’t even asked Dean to do it, and he’d made the effort in front of his siblings.
Dean wanted to be grateful. There were half-naked women, there was booze … but Castiel was trying to stick to the song. Wasn’t it weird that Castiel would consider they were each other’s true love and yet he didn’t mind taking Dean to a strip club?
“Why not? Kevin’s done everything that’s been asked of him. We kept him out all night, it’s the least you could do.”
“Dean,” Mr Singer said quietly, and they began murmuring amongst themselves. Claire looked out of the window. Eventually their muttering died out, and they drew Claire back in to the conversation.
“Anything I made in this room with a price tag. But if I made it for the gallery, you’re going to have to wait for it.”
“The store’s closed tomorrow. I was thinking we could do something together. Some father-daughter bonding. Like when we went to that pottery painting place together, remember?”
Dean frowned back at him, and Castiel gave a shrug. It wasn’t something Castiel wanted to discuss right then, because Kevin was technically still on probation - Michael had insisted - and while they were this close to so many other socialites, it wouldn’t do to have Kevin act out of turn. Dean would just have to be indignant until he could explain more fully what that situation was. Kevin opened the door, and Dean slid out, then turned and held a hand out to Castiel.
She made a big deal out of the mouthful she was chewing, before swallowing and over gesturing, not quite meeting his eyes.
Guy’s front teeth got knocked out, there was blood. The team nearly rioted. It’s a great match! How’d you pull this off?
Still, there was silence. Dean turned, as Castiel was brought to him, his gaze on the remnants of blood left on the dusty floor.
Alex didn’t show at all the next day, or text Claire to let her know what was going on. Kaia had sent a few messages but it was irritating to have her phone beep, only to see that it wasn’t Alex. Kaia wasn’t a horrible person to know, it was just bad timing when Claire needed to hear from her girlfriend. At lunch, they sat together away from everyone else and talked about music, television and movies; anything but their similar histories and their orientation. Kaia wasn’t a horrible friend to have. She just wasn’t Alex.
“So, it’s down to me to give a speech about my brother, and somehow Castiel gets away without the embarrassing stories. Claire, you have some, right?”
She gestured to her wings, and flopped back on her pillows, as Dean tried to do the mental maths, working out when Castiel first started leaving, reporting that God had returned and he was enlisting Castiel in his masterplan. When Dean's alcoholism had hit a serious point and he started depending on being drunk every night. He couldn't do it, it was too much of a haze. Could it have been ten years? Ten years since their relationship had begun falling apart?
“Kid, it could take all day to have a talk about how much people suck. I’m on your side on this, and not just because we’re practically family. I live it, Cas lives it too. I know you want to fight against it, but pick your battles, okay?”
'Like, how super?' Faith asked, finally giving Castiel some attention. Castiel looked at her, and hesitated.
“So, Claire, how do, you think these, rumours started?” Chuck asked, his pacing off, pausing at odd points in the sentence. He bounced nervously on his feet. Claire shrugged.
'Mary,' Dean supplied, his gaze sweeping up to where Castiel was now staring at the ceiling. 'Biblical Mar- no. No! Cas, how can you be okay with this?'
“What’s going on?” He asked the men opposite them at the table. The couple exchanged a look, and then answered.
'That's going to be easy, in Pennsylvania.' Garth rolled his eyes, and Faith looked up, feeling not-useless for the first time in weeks.
“This is dumb.” Ben stomped out of the room, and Dean collapsed into a chair. Castiel hesitated, before stepping closer.
Eileen threw a popcorn kernel at Dean, and Jody burst out laughing, making Claire laugh too. Dean merely shrugged, ate the piece of popcorn and leaned over to kiss Castiel. Claire watched them for a moment, smiling at how loved up her father and principal were. Dean started explaining about how good the team was and the rivalry between the schools, and Claire turned shyly to Jody, who smiled encouragingly at her.
“I assure you that I’m not. Do you remember when the apocalypse seemed to be impending and you took me to a strip club?”
“You didn’t make your grades a wager, no dice,” Sam shook his shaggy hair. “And you’re still handing it in Monday.”
Claire looked questioningly at her father, but didn’t have the chance to ask what he even meant by that as Dean came jogging back up into the apartment with the man from the day before. He really did look remarkably like Castiel, but from everything Castiel had said, there was no way Claire’s father could possibly have had another kid … was there?
“Just like that?” Dean sounded amused, but took the glass anyway. Castiel watched as he tipped the glass back and let the contents suck themselves inside him. He put the glass down and shrugged. “Now what?”
He sat down, and she sat gingerly behind him, taking the bottle from him and forcing herself to concentrate on the job and not the way his skin felt under her fingers, but it was hard. His skin was smooth, warm, almost like velvet. She worked as quickly as possible, and then started on her own sunscreen. Jack turned to look at her.
They stopped walking again, and Dean let go of his hand to pull him into a hug. And despite Castiel wanting something like this all evening, as soon as Dean took hold of him, he froze up. He wanted to hold Dean back, test the waters and see if Dean would kiss him, but he still wasn’t sure if Dean was interested. Even pressed up against each other, even in his embrace. What if Castiel started holding him back and didn’t let go and he put Dean off? He seemed easy going, but it was clear he had his limits at the same time.
It had been tough, yes, but they had still been trying, still working together to not wallow in pity the way Dean was lately. And then he came back. God. He returned to Heaven, or the Cosmos, or however that even worked. And the first thing God did was request Castiel. Castiel had dropped everything, had dropped
Eventually the janitor was dismissed, and Ms Harvelle steepled her hands together on top of the desk.
Castiel’s heart jackhammered. The sculpture of his mother was of course going to be important. As if Castiel would that slip through his fingers.
Castiel did, trying to manage his breathing still. He was surprised that Kevin even knew how to deal with this. He knew he’d picked correctly when he chose Kevin. Kevin who was a nice kid, a smart kid, and one who understood that, although Castiel hated the idea of driving around in a stretch limousine, understood that they both had roles to play. They had already agreed to fake both their roles for onlookers, though Castiel already considered him a kind-of friend.
“Dean,” his mother started defensively. Dean merely raised his hands in the air and walked away, back into the kitchen. Castiel followed him in quickly, and Mary walked in a few moments later, still toying with her hair. “What was that?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Alex’s words were soothing, as was her tone. She reached a hand up to cup Claire’s face, and she batted it away, leaning forward and resting her forehead between her knees. “I’m sorry.”
So much for that working. She couldn’t protest, and Dean practically pushed them out of the door and into the Impala. Jack was looking around Dean’s car with that same innocent curiosity that he had worn for so much of the day, and Claire pulled out her cell to quickly text Alex, letting her know what was happening. The message sent, and then the battery died. Maybe she and Jack shouldn’t have taken so many pictures throughout the day, as good as it had been to hang out with each other again. She could feel stress seeping in like it hadn’t all day.
“I am.” Dean nodded. Sam poked him again. “Sam, it’s okay. Castiel and I, we tried to raise the alarm, went to fight. But it wasn’t enough. Castiel had taken precautions, he had asked his fathers to take me out of harms way.”
'He picks the hard way, I guess?' Sam looked at Dean again, who pushed out his lower lip as he nodded.
'I was grieving. I had just lost my kid, Cas! Do you think it wouldn't be reversed for her? And it's not even true, I'm like the new Bobby. I can't get away from it. Stop with the empty excuses, Cas. You let us both down.'
“I promise not to make any more inappropriate comments about how hard your dad gets me. But you’re doing well at school and you’ve taken to the homeschooling better than I thought you would. Take the break.”
Dean took a deep breath, and Castiel stepped back slightly. He did not want to be within arm’s length of John Winchester when he reacted violently, as he was likely to do. Dean stuttered his way through an explanation, from John’s last request to saving Sam’s soul by selling his own, all the way to proposing at Sam’s wedding. Castiel waited for the inevitable fall out.
“Cheater! CHEATER!” Alex and Charlie crowed together as Sam took the last property card from Alex and Claire.
Castiel kissed him again, pushing him up against the Impala. They kissed for a few happy moments before Dean made him move back.
“I wanted to surprise you both. I promise, it’s a good surprise. I prepared for it last night. Dean said it would make up for the first activity. I know it’s my bachelors and all, but I just really want to enjoy the day with you both.”
“And in return, if I ask you to find other places to be because Mr Ketch is visiting, I want you both to respect that.”
“She’s old enough to decide.” Castiel put his foot down. There was the sound of the door opening and then closing.
“Cassie, no!” Balthazar-or-Gabe protested. “We’ll be good around your precious teenager. Remember the scavenger hunts we used to do?”
I know season 12 started last night ... I haven't yet seen it (trying to get a drop box going because streaming sites are awful) so ... well, I'd argue that I'm not influenced by season 12 at all (yet) but I know people might not believe me. And that's fine, because so far as I know Mary and Cas get along already on the show.
“Can you tell the difference between equipment and art?” Dean seemed relieved to be allowed to return to his food. It was endearing, so much so that Castiel almost forgot himself and simpered. He scratched behind his ear, trying to pull himself together. Dean was lowering his inhibitions so much, and he wasn’t used to that. It was the easiest he had found it to speak to anyone new.
“We thought maybe you wanted the distance, after what happened at the game,” Patience said gently. “That maybe Charlie was keeping us away on your request.”
“Dean had been awake for almost two days straight. He needed to go home and sleep. I’m sorry it cut our time at Amara’s celebration short, but I do want to take care of him.”
It's the second-to-last chapter. I feel I could have done this better. But I guess this is what happens when you write a chapter while waiting for registration to start for the convention you're attending. I wrote this a few days ago. And in the meantime, I saw Garth (and Mr Fizzles! We may have recreated the scene with the little girl in my photo lol, he got excited by the idea) as well as the Ghostfacers, the Campbells, Samandriel ...
They both turned and looked across the room, where Castiel was at the counter, and Dean had appeared behind him. Castiel was concentrating on changing the receipt roll and Dean was leaning against the wall, but they could see them talking softly. Dean looked over at them and winked, then his eyes dipped down, and Claire turned back around.
They both fell silent, and after a moment Claire watched them close the gap between their bodies, heard the sounds of lips smacking against each other, and she turned around, finishing her teeth off and emerging from the bathroom.
“Um, it’s like America’s Next Top Model, but with men who can look like women. I wish I could contour the way some of these dudes do.”
“I’ll put your mind at ease and let you know that Claire isn’t in any trouble. This is a routine meeting for transfer students, just to check that she’s settling in okay, go over any concerns you have, that kind of thing.”
'There are ways you could get married, officially, in the eyes of God and all! If I worked on it, if I could talk to Dad, convince him-'
“I guess you’re going to stay in my room,” She said, and then heard the beep of the microwave. Her grandparents managed to leap further into each other in fear.
'What're you talking about?' Dax interrupted. Sam was talking to him the way he'd been talking to Charlie earlier, and unlike with Charlie, Dax didn't have a clue what Sam was blabbing on about.
She looked back across the restaurant, and caught Alex’s eye. Alex grinned and turned back to the little girl, pointing at the menu items and clearly helping her pick her meal. She looked back and saw her Gram’s face. She wasn’t fooling the old lady one bit, apparently.
'Nope. First, Sam wanted me to find out why the hell you screwed him over in Mississippi. He's still there, solving the case, but hey, I can still interrogate with the best of them. So sit down, shut up, eat your damn dinner and spill.'
Dean was looking at him, his expression kind, and open. The understanding seemed to flow, intangible and unspoken, in the air between them. Dean reached across and patted his arm, sending tingles all over his skin.
'Wait, Faith,' Dean sounded breathless, and he realised that even though he'd stopped Castiel, he was still standing to attention. He grabbed a nearby shirt and held it in place to make it easier for Faith to talk to him without feeling uncomfortable. 'Did you want to ask something?'
‘Dean’s worried that someone will die at our wedding.’ Castiel summed up. Sam pulled one of the books that Castiel had been pretending to read, and flicked through it absent-mindedly.
“We’re not all sluts,” Castiel teased. “Dean, whatever you want to do with me is fine. Experience or not, I do want that connection with you.”
“There were things my first boyfriend did - not my brother, an actual person - that I didn’t like. That I do with Cas and it’s amazing. But Cas gets jealous.”
“Kissing someone. More than kissing someone. Even Dean, who you love? Especially Mom, since you didn’t?”
Sunday dinners between Castiel and Mary start back up. Dean always tags along, and most times Sam and Eileen make the trek through their joined backyards to take their reserved spots at the table. Castiel pushes Dean to start taking his mother for coffee regularly and eventually he doesn’t have to push at all. Each time, he pulls Baby back into the carport that has darkened with age with a smile on his face and a gleam in his eye. The smiles only get brighter. His once strained relationship with Mary now flourishes like Castiel’s garden. Dean strides up to his partner and plants a passionate kiss on his lips as a thank you for pushing him. They laugh after pulling away when they spot the dirty handprint on Dean’s shoulder. Accident or not, he flicks mud at Castiel in retaliation. Before he can insincerely apologize, there’s clumps in his hair and it drips onto his face. The hose is put to good use once they’re finished.
“‘M afraid that without you I would’ve continued seeing my sexuality as another thing going bump in the night that needed to be put down. But it's not a flame that needs to be stomped out.” Dean steps further back to slide his hands to cup Castiel's jaw and get a better look at him. Tear tracks glisten on his face. “Back then, loving you was the only good thing about me. I thought I would never see you again, or worse. All that love burnt out and you looking at me like just another person. I don’t think I could take that.” The last sentence comes out as barely a whisper. Castiel takes Dean’s hands, and for the first time in countless years, he can breathe.
