Tony groaned at the reminder that everyone actually forgot Ulysses and Bucky at the airport. “Relax, Tony. it’s vacation time.”
Sam, Clint and Rhodey remained confirmed bachelors, claiming they had too much love to spread to be tied down, to which Tony commented that the love was more like STIs. They were great uncles to the kids, though, and no matter how much Tony liked to rag on them and mock them, they were still beloved members of his pack. Pepper and Happy, after long years of courtship, finally tied the knot and their love child, Morgan Potts Hogan, was born earlier this year.
Tony shrugged, “Out of Investigation Discovery then. Point is it’s not something that I ever thought would happen to me in a million years, and I build my reputation on being a futurist.”
“I-- it was during the field trip to Oscorp,” Peter started nervously. Babbo sighed and muttered under his breath “Fucking Oscorp”. Peter glanced at his Papa and saw him gave an encouraging nod to keep going with his story, “And one of their specimens at the transgenic facilities must have gotten out of the cage, it was a spider, and it-- it bit me. The spider was radioactive so then some of its modifications must have gotten transferred to me, so now I’m sorta kinda part spider.”
Joe, though, was the opposite. He was book smart, just like his brothers, but was more reserved and shy. By Tony’s own observation, he was the smartest out of his three sons. He wasn’t like Ulysses, who everyone at school knew about, rather he had a smaller group of friends, consisting of his little brother Peter and Peter’s best friend Ned Leeds and the other kids from the marching band where Joe played the trumpet. He took after Steve from his pre-serum days. Where Ulysses was tall and built, Joe was tall and lanky. He was taller than the average omegas, almost at Tony’s height at just fourteen years old and he wasn’t finished growing, which made him self-conscious about his body. He wasn’t sickly like Steve was, just skinny. He loved to draw and he and Steve would go out to museums, spending the whole day there, sketching and drawing together. He wore glasses since he was 10 years old, a byproduct of years of reading too many books and coding with his Babbo. Just like his siblings, he was fluent in Italian but Joe, by virtue of having Natasha as his godmother, was also fluent in Russian. Natasha used to bring him down to Brighton Beach where there was a big Russian diaspora for them both to spend the day and for Joe to practice his conversational skills.
“Thank you, Tony. But I’m not hungry,” the God of Thunder answered him. He shot Tony and Steve a small muted smile.
Again, silence answered him. Tony stared resolutely at the statue of a man so revered for leading his country through its greatest crisis, silently begging it for any form of reprieve.
Pierce stared at them a moment longer before deciding to leave the couple to their own devices. As he left Steve remarked, “That’s not gonna be the last we see of him.”
They would be going on a family vacation to Maui for the summer, at Tony’s insistence. It would be the last summer Ulysses would spend with them before going to college in the fall. He had been accepted to Harvard, much to Tony’s dismay (he blamed Rhodey and Bucky for not doing their godfatherly duties well), to study history and political science. Ulysses wanted to be a lawyer. He became fixated on the crusading lawyer archetype ever since he saw ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ on one of the family’s movie nights. He wanted to be just like Atticus Finch, helping people who were victimized by the system, or who were wrongly accused and couldn’t defend themselves. Steve was proud of his son for having such aspirations. His family’s legacy of service would continue on with Ulysses. Tony was just glad Ulysses didn’t want to run off to join the military to serve his country. He appreciated Steve, Bucky, Rhodey and Sam for their services, but there’s still something inside him that rebelled at the thought of his baby being in the line of fire, even though said baby was old enough to enlist. Ulysses was still bummed out by his break up with Amy, but spending time with his little brothers, helping Peter with his chemistry experiments or playing the piano while Joe played his cello or having a coding tournament with his little brothers to see who could improve DUM-E (Ulysses), Butterfingers (Joe) or U (Peter) the best seemed to cheer him up significantly. Bucky and Rhodey took him out to play paintball one weekend, and they were gone for the whole day, but when they came back Ulysses looked pleased as punch. Beating his godfathers, who were both military men, at paintballing might have something to do with that.
“Feel better soon, Buck.” Steve told him, then awkwardly patted his back before leaving the room. On his way back, Thor found him and asked him to take Aurora for the night.
These were words that all Americans were familiar with. Words that were imprinted in the hearts and minds of its citizens. How Lincoln must have felt, leading the nation during one of the most tumultuous times of its history. Sending men away from their wives and children, sending boys away from their parents to die on the battlefield in the name of preserving the Union. What the weight on his conscience must have felt like, knowing you were sending your people, fellow countrymen, to slaughter and to die, having no choice but to do what must be done to preserve the Union. For six years now, Tony has been living with the guilt of knowing that weapons he designed and created have been used to hurt innocent people, costing the lives of thousands of American service members around the globe. But Lincoln had to live with the knowledge that these men died at the hands of their own countrymen, killing and killed by their own brothers.
Steve arrived like a herd of elephants stomping inside Tony’s workshop and breaking at least one pane of the reinforced glass that made up the workshop’s door, “Tony! JARVIS said it’s urgent. What happened?” he rushed towards where Tony was sitting splayed out on the floor. He could feel blood pooling underneath him and he saw the moment Steve realized what had happened. His mate’s eyes widened in fear, blue eyes staring at Tony in horror as he took in the sight of Tony on the floor.
“No, Steve, I can’t. He’s coming now.” Tony insisted, then he let put a blood curdling scream/groan, squeezing Steve’s hand hard. Steve helplessly rubbed his lower back, his face concerned and pained. No matter that this was his third time accompanying Tony through his labor pains, Steve still couldn’t help but be scared on his mate’s behalf.
” Tony asked his baby, lifting him out of the crib and into his arms. Ulysses’ milky baby scent filling his nostrils and brought peace to him. Ulysses sluggishly nodded, hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, his eyes slipping shut as he listened to the dulcet tones of his father’s voice.
Cornered, Steven had no choice but to tell Anthony the truth. His mother had always said that the base of a long lasting marriage or any relationship was open communication. And open communication was what Steven would give to Anthony. “You’re right, Anthony, I’m not the son of a mere fisherman. Like you said, the shield, the boots, the helmet and my own strength would not be things a mere mortal would have. The truth is...I am a son of Zeus.” Steven exhaled out his explanation, watching Anthony’s face intently for his reaction.
Groot flew them high above the raging sea monster who roared out in anger as they flew too high above his reach. Anthony watched in astonishment as for the first time in his life he was flying. Flying! Just as he always dreamed about doing. A giggle, small and unobtrusive, escaped his lips which turned into full blown laughter as he realized the ridiculousness of the situation he was in.
“Oh yeah, you definitely need some color in here.” Steve agreed. His father walked over to a covered mound in the middle of the workshop and pulled back the tarp covering it to reveal cans of paints and various types of brushes. “That’s what I thought. Here, go nuts. Paint me something nice for my birthday.”
“Sam Wilson, aka DJ Falcon, you restrained him from lunging at your boss?” It was once again Thor’s turn for an interview. The man was once again a resolute, unmoving wall of stone, staring blankly at Bucky and Sharon as they asked him questions. His placidly blinking eyes were the only indication that he heard anything that was asked of him.
He must have zoned out for awhile because when he came back Steve was in front of him, shouldering his backpack and training bag. “I’ll be back late tonight, Dad. I’ve asked Mrs. Hasegawa to check on you. Call me if you need anything, okay?”
And for the second time in his life, Tony was rendered speechless. Steve’s studio was filled with hundreds of sketches of his likeness. There were black and white pencil and charcoal sketches of Tony in myriad of poses. There were watercolor portraits of him hanging on the wall, and on the lines running across the room, fastened there by clothespins, waiting to dry. He saw an unfinished oil painting of himself in profile displayed prominently in the center of the room where Steve had set up his easel. On the far side of a room was an unfinished bust that closely resembled him. “Wow…” Steve’s studio was in essence a shrine to Tony.
“Tony?” a deep, smooth baritone pulled him out of his reverie. When he looked up through the glass walls of his workshop, he saw Steve standing outside the door by the stairs, his hand raised in a wave. JARVIS must have put him on speaker.
Which was how Joe found himself pacing back and forth in front of the music room, worried sick for his little brother and staring desperately at his phone, willing it to ring. He tried calling Peter earlier but the boy didn’t pick up. Then, Joe just chalked it up to the boy being in the middle of something urgent during patrol, but now it was starting to become worrisome.
would look better if he used you as the model’, and that’s a direct quote. He will kill me when he finds out I tell you this but whatever, I’m dead anyway for letting you know my secret identity.”
“Everyone’s Irish today, Steve. Not just you.” Clint helpfully pointed out, his words slurred. He looked ridiculous in a green t-shirt depicting the Leprechaun from the Lucky Charms cereal and wearing a sparkling green top hat.
That evening, the rest of the pack returned from their respective trips and Steve and Tony sat them down for a family meeting and told them all what happened. Hugs and consolations were exchanged and Sam brought out their whole catalog of ice creams and the Avengers proceeded to have an ice cream party, while watching Star Wars Episode IV.
He seemed to be feeling better now, and has been sleeping through the night again, to his and Tony’s relief. Seeing Ulysses cried himself to sleep all those nights and helpless to do anything but comfort him tugged at their heart strings.
paternity leave to its employees. Other than the excellent health insurance, it was one of the many things that led to low employee turnovers at the company. SI offered twelve weeks of paid maternity/paternity leave. But now, Tony was starting to think that maybe they should be like Germany and offered up to three years of parental leave.
“Yeah, I know.” Tony coughed into his fist to hide his embarrassment. His left hand still in Steve’s hold, “I love you too.” he said quietly.
“He’s a leader of a gang. A gang that is known to kill people, and he hates your guts. I ain’t no mathematician but that adds up bad.”
That floored Bucky a little bit. Stevie has a son now. When they were younger, he would have never imagined this. Hell, the fact that he managed to get Steve to live past eighteen was a badge of honor in his book. But here he was now, probably the healthiest human being on the planet and with everything to live for.
“Steve, honey, really? That’s what you chose to focus on? Not the fact that someone from the Royal Swedish academy just called us out of the blue at --fuck, 3 AM?-- at 3 in the morning.”
“Hush...need to take your clothes off,” Steve hurriedly stripped Tony of his dress shirt, flinging it off the bed not caring where it lands. Once he has his mate naked under him, Steve ran his hands down Tony’s torso, admiring his mate’s smooth olive skin and toned body. “So beautiful, Tony. My beautiful mate,” he leaned down and they started kissing again. Tony opened up so beautifully to him, his Omega was always so responsive to his touches. Steve was humbled and awed once again at the thought of this beautiful creature choosing him to be his mate and bearing his marks.
Shaking his head in exasperation, Tony slid out of bed knowing he wouldn’t be able to get more sleep. He should be downstairs in the workshop anyway, there were still plenty of things to do before Steve came home on Friday, and Tony wanted to make as much headway as he could so he could spend the rest of the weekend in Steve’s arms, reveling in his presence, soaking up all the love Steve send his way and making good memories for their first Christmas together. His latest project, retrofitting the armor so it would seamlessly wrap itself around Tony when summoned, was going well. Just a few more adjustments and it would be ready for its first trial flight soon.
“I will fix up that eyesore of a motorcycle you love so much and I’ll give up trying to make you buy tight jeans. And no more giant stuffed animals randomly showing up at your studio.” Tony said, referring to the last time he gave Steve a giant teddy bear with a heart shaped pillow.  “What do I get then if I win?”
Steve parked his bike between Dad’s pickup truck and Bucky’s beat up Subaru and walked inside the house.
Steve sighed and took a bite out of his sandwich, “I don’t know. But at least I have something to talk about at Confession this week.”
And that’s not Jamie being a hopeless romantic, that’s just physics. It’s inevitable and undeniable.
God, Tony loved him so much it’s hard to believe that he survived forty odd years of his life with only glimpses and wisps of a dream of him, “Me too.” he whispered.
That hit below the belt, and Steve saw red. He punched Bucky in the face, remembering at the last second to pull his punch so as to not cause any lasting damage to his brother. His punch left Bucky slumped down on the counter, his mouth red with blood. Steve vaguely registering someone calling out, “Take it outside!” as he strode over to the exit.
Tony didn’t think he was worrying too much. He was worrying the perfect amount, and it wasn’t because his instincts was going haywire with being pregnant and not having his mate beside him to calm down those instincts to nest and just huddle up with Steve in their bedroom.
“God, I hate you both so much. If I don’t have puke filling up my mouth right now, I’d scream at you.” Bucky groaned out.
“Aw man, I forgot my wallet. Sorry kids, Daddy can’t pay for these. You have to return the food to the nice man behind the counter.” the man said apologetically to his children. He had short, sandy blond hair and a pleasant face.His skin was tanned, indicating he was local or a tourist who have stayed longer than he had to. He looked pained, and Tony immediately knew that this man didn’t have enough money to pay for the boxed lunches he just bought for his children. His kids looked disappointed at the prospect of not eating lunch and it tugged at Tony’s defective heart strings.
Natasha agreed, and just like that Tony had a new PA, a new friend (Rhodey would always hold the BFF title until the day he died, okay) and a couple of Santa’s little helper in the form of Clint’s spawns.
“Ah, thank you, I guess.” Anthony’s blush was endearing to say the least, “glad to be here. I guess this is your island, huh?”
“Look, Stark, you pride yourself on being pragmatic and rational. I’d just thought you’d appreciate the logic.”
“Because it would be the last time Ulysses would be spending his summer with us. After he’s off to college who knows if he would even have time to go back to New York.”
“No, Captain. While Master Stark and Agent Barton had a slight disagreement earlier today in the kitchen, nothing seems to be in disrepair.”
“Morning Clint, Tony. Have you guys had breakfast yet?” he addressed them, rounding the way to the front of the couch.
Oooh relationship issues. Yeah, Tony wasn’t gonna be touching that with a ten-foot pole. He surreptitiously tried to scoot away from the couch but Steve caught him. Big, warm hands clamped down on his thighs keeping him seated on the couch. Steve’s glare broadcasted ‘
Steve sighed. Tony was being unreasonable and over the top, likely still feeling guilty about day drinking and not being there for Joe when he had an allergic reaction and for losing Ulysses. Steve had repeatedly told him that everything turned out fine, he had nothing to feel guilty about. Day drinking was probably not a good move, but there were extenuating circumstances so Steve let that slide.
) stuck in suspended animation just to find him again. And when you found him, you grab on tight with both hands and never let go no matter what happens. No matter what. And there ain’t nothing on this life or the next that can separate you.
Next was Rhodey’s turn. He returned to the tower immediately after he was stateside after a brief mission in Syria. Tony had had JARVIS sent Rhodey a picture of Ulysses’ sleeping face after he was born to him, receiving only a bunch of heart emojis as a reply. Tony took that as a sign that Rhodey was thrilled by the birth of Ulysses.
Tony was silent over the comm, and Steve heard the tell-tale beep that the line between him and Tony had been switched to a private one, “Save the rest for return, J. I’m sorry, Steve. I wish there was another way.”
Steve didn’t shirk his fatherly duties, he would never do that. He still made Ulysses’ bottle, he still sang him to sleep most nights, but during the day he would mostly be downstairs with Barnes, reminiscing about the good old days. Whenever it was just the two of them downstairs, talking and Steve started to say “Remember when…” Tony immediately cut off the live feed, afraid of what he might see or hear. For some reason, it felt wrong to spy on that. Spying on Fury and Hill extract Intel from Barnes, that was no big deal. But watching Steve and his BFF talked about how the past was better was a line he wasn’t willing to cross.
When the boat was further along the river, Clint fired off several of his fire tipped arrows towards the boat, hitting the fuse and lighting all the tealight candles on the boat. After it sailed further down the river, Thor hit the hilt of Stormbreaker to the ground twice and the boat carrying Sarah Marie levitated and flew into the night sky.
“How are you feeling?” he felt Natasha sat down on the side of his bed. Her hands started to card through his messy oily hair, gently lulling him to sleep.
“My boy, I understand that you’re eager to do this. Eager to start a new era at Stark, make your mark, create your own legacy. But the simple truth is this, Tony: we’re ironmongers.
Steve would be okay. They would still get to have their fearless, stubborn, irreplaceable pack leader.
“Recognize him?” Bucky asked them Steve and Tony shook their heads in answer, “Never seen him before in my life.” Tony answered for them.
“Good. Emotionally wrung out from having to convince Ulysses not to drive down here in the middle of the semester just to check up on Peter.” Joe sighed leaning into Jamie’s warm body.
And so it was, on the floating island of Delos, in a field of hyacinth and lavender, with two gods as witnesses, Anthony and Steven were handfasted, committed to each other for life and inseparable even in death. As they kissed to seal their commitment to each other, a sense of peace and relief suffuse through Anthony. He was here with his husband Steven, safe and sound. Until he remembered about his farce of an engagement with Obadiah.
“I know, honey. I’m sad too, but Ulysses has to grow up and leave us someday. That’s just the way it is. Children grow up eventually.”
“Up yours, Stark. It’s too early for your mothering.” Clint mumbled, not taking his eyes off the television.
“I know, I’m sorry, love. I’m back now. Here to answer your beckons and demands.” Steve grinned prompting Tony to do the same. Tony pecked him on the lips sweetly.
They weren’t two planets on different orbits, destined to never intersect the other’s path. They were two fusing nuclei, contracting and releasing energy to create a Supernova of incandescent luminosity.
That seemed to calm them down as they settled back down to their original position. Natasha smiled softly at him and squeezed his shoulder. She looked tired and downtrodden, Clint too. His usual mischievous nature was notably absent from his gaze and his demeanour.
“Oh, right. You’re the goddess of the hunt. Not much to hunt in this empty floating island here, huh?”
Which was when Natasha walked into the lobby with baby Aurora in her arms, looking none the worse for the wear, much to the relief of her parents and uncles were in.
Later, they took the unconscious body of the man downstairs and told Steve to watch the ‘Good Morning Steve” video and read his journal while they called Dr. Erskine to check on him.
“Thanks, Jamie.” Joe’s voice pulled him back to the present, “having someone to share this secret with...it’s more than I could have asked for. It makes things easier. And thank you for being here. I don’t think I can be alone right now.”
Bucky furiously nodded, “Yeah, Stevie. Ain’t nothing burdening us about you. We’re more than ready to help you.”
“Oh really?” Tony stopped, “I wish I could make it, but uh, yes I will be there.” Tony smiled charmingly, thrilled to be getting another chance to meet Steve.
“This place is under a cloud.” Killian interjected, “things like this occur when people are not...reasonable.” he said. His last words were directly addressed to Steve.
“Steve, no…that’s not what I meant. I saw him on the television in the living room this morning before you came back for your run.” Tony said. His clarification seemed to deflate Steve’s rage.
It had been a week since Jane visited the Avengers. A week since Steve and Tony was dragged on a disastrous double date with them. After that double date, nobody has seen much of Thor nor the astrophysicist he was dating. They only knew Jane left from JARVIS when Tony asked him to inform Thor and Jane that breakfast was ready one morning and the AI informed them all that Dr. Foster has left last night.
“Jujubee, Petey Pie, Babbo’s coming, babies~~” Tony slurred out drunkenly from his perch on Steve’s shoulder, where Steve was carrying him out of the bar in a bridal carry. Steve apologized to the bartender as he paid Tony and Clint’s bills, adding extra tips in the tip jar for their patience. Tony was asleep by the time they got back to the gate where everyone else was waiting, snoring loudly. Clint was still random Italian words that he knew, Thor carrying him around like a sack of flour on his shoulder. Joe was also asleep on one of the seats at the waiting room, tired after his anaphylaxis attack ordeal, his head on Natasha’s lap and his godmother was stroking his blond hair affectionately.
” Tony sassed at Peter, ruffling the boy’s hair in payback for making him stop kissing Steve. Steve tangled their fingers together as he walked in after them, smiling fondly at Peter who still squawking in annoyance at his father for rumpling up his hair do.
“Jane and I broke up.” Thor announced gravely, surprising no one. Tony and Steve exchanged a glance, knowing this was coming. “I really thought spending some time near her would ease our troubles, but the opposite seem to happen. All we did when she was here was fight and snipe at each other.” Thor sighed, “We weren’t meant to be, friends. We collided too soon and too fast, there was no foundation, no underlying connection to build upon once the spark was extinguished. The distance between us was too great.”
“Tomatoes.” Steve then said, prompting Tony to take all the tomatoes garnishing Steve’s dish because of Steve’s aversion to tomatoes on the grounds of them making his food soggy, never mind that what he was eating was a seafood stew, “You missed one.” Steve said again and Tony obligingly took a piece of tomato from Steve’s food, leaving the stew tomato free.
, of being hurt by the person you love. Of suffering. And when it happens, it will affect you more than being hurt by a random person on the street, because you’re being hurt by the person who is at the center of your whole universe, the person you gave your whole being to.
“No, it’s not the baby. It’s just-- It’s--” Tony stuttered out with eyes still tightly shut. Finally he released a loud gust of breath and rapidly blurting out “yourballsmakemenauseous.”
“I know that, don’t worry about it.” Steve consoled her, “It’s just, I noticed it wasn’t complete. Why?”
So Tony went along on all their jaunts all over the island. He took them to the North Shore to see the macadamia farms and the pineapple plantation. Then they went island hopping, taking the jet from the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and all the way to Kauai. That island hopping trip was one part vacation, one part business trip as he and Pepper looked around for future sites for the arc reactor plants SI planned to build in Hawaii.
Steve leaned down and pressed a soft kiss on Tony’s lips. It was only meant to be a peck, but days of separation led to the kiss being deeper and more passionate than intended. Tony whimpered at the kiss and clung to Steve, hard and not letting go of him. Steve carried them upstairs, not breaking their kiss the whole way, even as they head to the bedroom and laid Tony down on their bed.
The twin gods seemed mollified by Steven’s explanation and deflated, “Well, I’m just glad you’re okay,” Clint said again then rushed forward to hug Steven along with Natasha. Steven, now with two gods in his arms, patted their backs to comfort them. They might have an unorthodox upbringing and family, but the affection between them was as sincere as any siblings would have.
“They love us. That’s great, we’re loveable. But what math gets them to obstruct justice?” Steve asked incredulously.
One hour later, Tony stared in horror at all six home pregnancy tests lined up in front of him on the bathroom sink. All of them showing how pregnant he undoubtedly was.
“We’d be happy to join you, Thor.” Tony’s eyes widened at his answer and he looked like he wanted to put on his gauntlet and blast a repulsor at Steve’s face. His free arm flopping uselessly at his side in exasperation.
That’s the whole bottom line. That’s what the name Stark is all about.” Obie paused to underscore his points, “Tony, your father was a visionary, just like you. And he was a patriot. He knew that this company’s existence was crucial for the continued protection and existence of our country. And for the employees that depended on this company’s success to make a living. Making weapons is our Occam’s razor, Tony.”
“Okay…” Steve trailed off, inwardly hoping that Tony wasn’t really going to demolish a wall just to bring a stuffed animal inside, “By the way, why are you wearing the armor in the house? Is this a new one?” Steve took in the design. It was sleek, much more sleek than the one he had encountered in the Battle of New York and with more golden tone.
“This place had the power before you got here. It’ll have it after you’re gone.” Falcon insisted. “All I want is my piece of the legacy, okay?” he chuckled then started performing a complicated and fancy dance move.
The ambulance JARVIS called arrived not five minutes after Tony fainted, and Steve rushed down to the lobby to meet the EMTs, Tony’s body secure in his arms. In his haste to meet the EMTs, he left Ulysses in the studio but JARVIS assured him that he had alerted the Avengers on what happened and that Ulysses was in Bucky’s care.
But were they doomed now before they even had a chance to begin? The same fate that befall Orpheus and Eurydice would become them too. Orpheus’ inability to look forward, doubting that his love would behind him as they exited from the depths of Tartarus cost him his wife. Would Steve’s decision to reopen the wounds of the past, to tell Tony the truth, cost them their future together?
The months following that accident was somehow harder than the months following Sarah’s death. It was like reliving Sarah’s slow descent to lifelessness, but this time it was more painful because this was happening to Joe’s own flesh and blood. The sight of Steve lying on the hospital bed, all black and blue from the bruises on his face and head, and all Joe wanted to do was switch places with his boy. Let him be the one with the brain damage, while Steve only had to have cracked ribs.
Steve responded in concert, “He does, doesn’t he? For the longest time when I was growing up I wanted to be just like him. I only knew the stories Ma told, but what she told me he was a warrior even before he ever stepped foot onto the battlefield. He moved away from Boston, partly because he saw how segregated it was even as a Northern city. Ma said he would bring people that worked with him at the meatpacking plant home with him and offered them a place to spend the night or something to eat. He also refused to join the Union because they refused to let Black and Jewish workers be members.”
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead. Today had been the most perfect, life changing, earth shattering, days of his life. Steve wondered what his Ma would have said if she were here with them. She would be crying buckets and buckets of joyful tears at the birth of her first grandson. She’d have laughed at him for naming his son after his favorite book, but then she would also say that it was a mighty fine name that honored their heritage. She would be happy to see him now: happily mated to the most beautiful, kindest, most thoughtful and compassionate omega and to have a pack that supported and loved him despite his shortcomings.
“Okay, guys. This is it.” Tony addressed the helper bots, “if this doesn’t work, it’s been an honor,” he saluted the bots. DUM-E chirped back, while U and Butterfingers nodded their handles. Tony then turned the ignition that started the power coils, initiating the particle accelerator. Machine sounds started to fill the workshop and the house. The power coils groaned as the particles within started to accelerate.
“No you’re not. I’m your PA, I know your schedule better than you. You’ve finished the latest prototype of the arc reactor and the new updates for the StarkPhone OS just came online. You’re hiding down here,” Nat answered.
So here he was, two weeks later, finally gathering up the courage to venture up to the common room for breakfast with the Avengers. Steve was already at the stove, cooking a stack of pancakes. He smiled and nodded in greeting as he spotted Bucky entering the room.
Tony wanted to stand up and introduce himself to the man, this Adonis he found in some random cafe by the side of a highway, but something stayed him. Just then, the old Japanese man sitting next to him piped up, “Are you staring at me or him? ‘Cause you’re starting to freak me out,”
“Why is Johnny Storm in our living room? Tony, did you exchange Steve for a newer model?” Clint asked as he dropped down on the couch next to Bucky for movie night, a big bowl of popcorn on his lap.
“Take care,” they shook hands, and Steve lifted his hand up to his nose again and inhaled, “One for the road.”
Anthony watched from the safety of the cliff as Steven, handsome, kind hearted and shrouded in mystery, engaged Cetus in battle. It was clear that Steven was no mere mortal, his ability to rip apart the chains binding Anthony to the boulder like they were made of dried tree root instead of steel was testament to that fact. He had to be a demigod, a son to one of the Olympians. Which one, Anthony did not know, nor did he cared much for it. The way Steven treated him and his actions impressed Anthony more than his lineage. Of course Anthony was impressed by the immaculate beauty and charisma he exuded, but such matters were skin deep. Steven’s courteous and respectful manner and the way he blushed so prettily in the face of Anthony’s flirtations intrigued him more. When he realized that Anthony had a plan, regardless of how futile it was in the face of Cetus’ grandness, he didn’t run roughshod or belittle his plans. He politely told Anthony that he had a better one and asked (
On the other line, Bucky was being detained and singled out for questioning because his mechanical arm didn’t pass inspection. Ulysses went after him claiming Uncle Bucky needed representation during questioning as was his constitutionally protected right. Steve got into an argument with another TSA agent who wanted to put his shield in the X-ray machine, Joe trying to futilely explained to his Papa that nothing would happen to the vibranium in the shield when subjected to X-ray. Thor had placed Mjolnir on the inspection table and was daring the other TSA agents to pick the hammer up to see if any of them were worthy, while Bruce looked on in exasperation at his mate’s antics, desperately telling him that he was holding up the line and they need to get out of here now. Clint and Sam passed without any fanfare and was laughing at them from the other side.
“You bought six pregnancy tests?” Steve laughed. Of course Tony did, he never do anything by halves.
Steve looked back towards Tony, carrying Ulysses whose cries have petered out and was now sniffling quietly into Tony’s neck. Tony looked unsure and hesitant, it wasn’t everyday that the man who was responsible for your parents’ deaths dropped by for a visit after all. Steve knew what that felt like for he felt the same.
“Oh my God, I won’t be able to see him everyday.” Tony moaned, “How the fuck did this happen? Why did I tell him it’s okay to apply to school out of state?”
“What’s up, Bubbles? Why are you still here, thought you’d be done with band practice by now.” he started calling Joe Bubbles now after Joe told him about how when they were growing up, he and his siblings were pretty obsessed with the Powerpuff Girls and how Ulysses basically assigned them their parts as one of the girls, with Joe as Bubbles, Peter as Buttercup and Ulysses himself as Blossom, the leader.
“Of course, Steve, you lug. Like I could ever answer any other way,” Tony chuckled. Steve’s answering smile was so bright and beautiful that Tony couldn’t resist the wave of fondness rolling over him at the sight, “now come up here and give me a kiss, Alpha.”
“It’s my pleasure, Tony, and an honor to be a part of this. Not everyone gets to say they delivered Captain America and Iron Man’s children, do they?” Dr. Rosenberg winked at them.
“Everybody knows Pierce. He’s around the whole time. Alexander Pierce was upset that he didn’t get his facilitator’s fee after he helped Cap and Stark expedite the rezoning process so the bar can have live entertainment.”
“I have no doubt about that.” Tony smiled softly in agreement, “Steve, I want to name our son after your father. I want to name him Joseph.”
“Seventy years ago, before I got the serum I was getting my ass kicked in base camp. One of the recruits kicked down the barbed wire fence during training and my hands got scratched up protecting my face from the wires. I was on my to the medics camp when someone patched it up for me instead. With just a touch of their hands. Do you know who that person was?”
“Okay, Barton and I have a thing,” Maria admitted, “But it’s not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing, okay? It’s a thing. Just a-- a thing.”
Tony was speechless. God, was it possible to fall in love this fast? “My hands are available for your smelling pleasure anytime you want.”
Tony and Steve went down to the kitchen later on that morning. They woke up again a little around 9 AM and decided to go to the kitchen and start making breakfast for their kids. It was summer and school was out, so everyone was home. As they stepped out of the elevator, they heard sounds coming from the kitchen, some song that Tony heard a long time ago playing on the speaker.
“No, he didn’t.” Steve denied, shaking his head at the notion of his mate somehow being the murder victim’s accomplice.
“A funeral? For the fetus?” Tony scooped another spoon of ice cream from a carton of Rocky Road ice cream on Steve’s lap.
“I read about what you did after you closed down the weapons manufacturing division. You’ve been doing so much good, Tony.” Steve cleared his throat, “My best friend, Bucky, came home from Iraq missing an arm. He was so despondent, I had to put him on suicide watch. But then he got a call from Stark Resilient, offering him to be part of the new clinical trial for a new prosthetic available for free for veterans. Without you, I would have a lost my best friend, Tony. That’s what you’ve done, Tony, to people you’ve never even met. ‘Anyone’ wouldn’t do just that.”
Tony pulled him up from the chair and settled him on his hip. They went back up to the common room where it was blessedly quiet, for once, the guys have stopped playing Rock Band and was now off at God knew where. Tony cleaned up Joe then went downstairs to the garage and load Joe up in the minivan. Once done, Tony hopped in to the driver’s seat and head off to Ulysses’ kindergarten.
“It’s certainly grand. A grand gesture.” Steve answered diplomatically, “Gonna be hard to top that. How are we going to fit it in the house?”
“There’s no head injury. I think he passed out from the blood loss,” Joe sighed, “which is even more frightening because it meant that he lost enough blood to cause him to faint, even with his enhanced healing.” He felt the pinpricks of tears starting at the edges of his eyes. It just dawned on him now that he was inches close to losing his little brother. It was now that he realized just how in over their heads Ulysses, him and Peter were.
As for his other project, the one he started since he had his recurring nightmares all those months ago, well that’s another story.
“Come on, Stark.” he heard Natasha whispered in his ears, the Black Widow wasn’t as unaffected by everything as she seemed to be.
Joe laughed at their banter. If this was what the rest of high school, and dare he say, life would be, Joe was more than happy to live with it.
Steve looked amazed at Tony’s approach. He smiled sheepishly and said, “Now why didn’t I think of that,”
“No, Tony, never. I’ll never let you go.” Steve whispered in his ears a sacred vow that he intended to keep from now until the day he died.
“Quit busting our coconuts for five seconds, huh. We’re just trying to help,” Quill said, taking out what looked like a joint from his pocket.
“Stay here!” Jimmy commanded him from the window. He turned around to face the firefight, but not one second later, shrapnel pierced his body and the side of the car where Tony remained. Realizing that mortars and missiles were involved in the attack and that his safety was very much threatened if he stayed in the car, Tony scrambled to open the doors and escaped the confines of the vehicle. His hearing and senses seemed dulled, he was focused only on one thing: getting out of the car, getting to safety. He always heard about the fight-or-flight response, how the human peripheral nervous system activated certain hormones that enhance certain sense while simultaneously dampening other non-essential sense. This was what’s happening to him right now. He couldn’t hear or see anything beyond that rock over there where he needed to take cover. That was the only thing that mattered right now.
in the original Russian, because Joe wouldn't be caught dead reading the translated version, splayed open on his lap. He must have been doing some light reading and there was a disbelieving expression on his face. To be fair, it wasn’t everyday one found out that one’s little brother was the new superhero on the block everybody was talking about.
“Ugh, I know. I feel so gross. My boots feel like sponges.” Brianna made a face. Together, the two friends walked the one block from Fifth avenue to Park Avenue where Avengers Tower was located. When the famous A came into view, they squealed in excitement and started snapping pictures with their phones. Brianna even whipped out her DSLR camera and took several photos of the tower that still managed to look majestic despite the fog blanketing the New York skyline.
Just then, Sam walked in the kitchen and wondered, “Hey, why is Clint cosplaying Don Corleone in the living room? Also, when did we get a cat?”
“No, man. You don’t have to do that. I’ll just take these kids home and make them something for lunch,” the man started to say. His expression was pained, as if knowing that whatever lunch he would make for his kids, it wouldn’t be a good one because of his lack of money.
Tony stole a look from his perch on the counter at Steve. Steve, a perfect name to go with the perfect man. Adonis did look like a Steve. He seemed to exude that wholesome, boy-next-door, old-fashioned gentlemanly vibe about him. Now if he’s at least bi, then all of Tony’s dreams would come true.
Later, they were laying down in the flower fields, enjoying the closeness of their bodies together, Anthony laying down on top of Steven, kissing the life out of him. Steven was in heaven, the man he loved was in his arms and loving him. They were the only two people in Steven’s world, as far as he was concerned, and nothing could be better.
“Sorry about that, brah. I swear I’d forget my head if it wasn’t attached to my neck,” he said sheepishly, handing over the boxed lunches back to the cashier attendant.
“Why are you showing this to me?” Tony asked, his head reeling with the revelation that Natasha had lied to the cops and was apparently withholding information and most likely obstructing justice.
“Okay, J, try this one for a change. Let’s change up the reactor a little bit. Use this new scheme I’m specifying to you: change the palladium core to helium and hydrogen atoms, and use these modified Lawson equations and the numbers I gave you as the input.”
“You fainted, Tony,” Huh, since when did Tony became Tony for Steve? Wasn’t it Mr. Stark, or Stark! (called out in annoyance or exasperation), “You exhausted yourself trying to heal Coulson.”
“It has come to our attention that Peter is apparently Spiderman and Joe has a boyfriend.” Steve told his oldest son, watching him closely for his reaction and he did not disappoint.
“Um, okay…” the voice on the line seemed taken aback, “Mr. Stark then. Sir, I’m calling on behalf of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. This is a very important matter. Please stay on the line.” then a beeping sound signalled Tony and Steve's end of the line being put on hold.
self, to gauge if he was indeed real, “Yes, as far as I know. Are you sure you’re okay? I saw those priests chained you to this rock and left you here. What is going on here?”
“By James. He came in to ask me out.”  What? That was new information. Bucky was at the bar too on the night of the murder, then. And if he interrupted Natasha’s conversation with Rumlow, Bucky must have seen him too, and seen the napkin Natasha drew.
“Right. Well, my bar is not for sale, but my booze is. So either get a drink, or get the hell out of here.” Steve firmly said.
Despite their best efforts, the Chitauri just kept pouring down from the portal. Steve could feel himself starting to tire, and he couldn’t imagine how the rest of his teammates were faring now. He was on the ground, Thor next to him, taking down the Chitauri with their hammer and shield when one of them let off a shot that managed to catch Steve in his abdomen.
It’s almost worth the heartache to know that he had the unconditional love and support from his family.
The protagonist had the brilliant idea of scanning his own brain to uncover forgotten memories, and Tony thought maybe, just maybe, he could make the same device but instead of just displaying the memory, you could interact with it and manipulate the memories to go the way you wished it would have gone, for closure. That would be a big stepping stone in helping trauma patients, and potentially, a certain brainwashed sniper.
Tony slid the drawn napkin forward to Pierce, “Why didn’t you show this to the police?” the older man questioned him.
Steve quirked his lips slightly at the compliment as if just discovering that Tony was just as amusing as he’d seemed in the video. He stepped inside the workshop and looked around. Right, Tony thought, he was seeing it for the first time again. “Wow, Tony. These all look amazing. These holographs are so neat!”
“Hmm,” Steve hummed, placing the mouthwatering food in front of Tony, prompting Tony to chastely kiss his mate on the cheek, “That’s a bit unfair for the other babies, don’t you think? He’d clean house with all the awards.”
“Hmm,” Anthony hummed and settled closer at Steven’s side, “so now, you’re to bring that head back to Seriphos?”
Sharon cleared her throat, “have you witnessed any altercations, any differences in opinion in the bar lately?”
But know that I read each and every single one of your comments. I really appreciate them. They warm my heart and soul :)
The Avengers’ upstate facility backed up to the Hudson, giving the facility the envied status of being a waterfront property. Usually nobody could be found on the banks of the Hudson, there was nothing really worth seeing. The pollution of the water had made the water less than clear, and Tony swore up and down that he once saw a fish with legs walked out of the river. Of course he was still high from the pain medication he was prescribed after the caesarean section to deliver Joe, so there was a possibility that he didn’t actually see anything.
“I’m German. We skipped bedside mannerisms in Medical school.” Tony quirked his lips in a small smile at the doctor’s attempt of humor.
And the man of Anthony’s dreams was standing next to a...winged horse? What on earth? Anthony blinked a couple times to make sure what he was seeing was correct. Did Cetus actually already came and devoured him and he was in Elysium, and this man and his flying horse was a figment of his imagination?
Jamie sighed. Just a couple of feet away was the object of his musings, sitting cross legged on the floor in front of his own locker, eyes glued to the StarkPad in his lap and fingers swiping at the screen. In front of him his little brother, Peter Rogers, was chattering away in Italian, arms gesticulating the way it was wont to do when talking. Jamie chuckled softly, The Rogers Boys were pretty amusing to him. Their names were ethnically Irish but as far as Jamie could tell they didn’t speak a lick of Irish but was fluent in Italian. He heard that Tony Stark had insisted on raising his sons with Italian as their first language as an homage to his late mother. Before Ulysses Rogers graduated, the three of them could be found talking away in Italian during lunch break or in between classes.
“Oh honey, I have a seventeen year old son and you don’t sound a day over fifteen,” Nice Blond Lady smiled indulgently at Peter, “I understand you have a secret identity to keep, so I won’t say anything.” she winked.
Would the same thing happen if he and Jamie were to mix like sulphuric acid and water? There’s only one way to find out.
“Me too. He has the same blood on his hands as Loki does. But we can’t let Loki get away with this. He’s made it personal and it’s time to hit back.”
Steven nodded in acknowledgment. Hearing Anthony’s life story was enlightening to say the least. He wasn’t under the impression that Anthony’s life as a crown prince was smooth sailing and without hardship. Everyone had different paths and problems to go through in their life. It would be disingenuous of Steven to assume otherwise. He placed his hand on Anthony’s, squeezing it for reassurance. Kind blue eyes gazed into vulnerable golden brown ones and for the first time in his life, Anthony felt comforted and safe.
Steve was saved from spouting more useless (and possibly detrimental) suggestions when Ulysses ran into the living room, Clint hot on his heels. His blue eyes lit up as he spotted his parents and his uncle sitting on the couch “
“That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?”
“No, not the singing. Although that’s upsetting too. No, I’m talking about Steve and the Wonder Twins. Has anyone heard anything from them? They haven’t given anyone a mission update in three days.”
Telling Clint about his rule yesterday seemed to serve no purpose, because here Tony was. At the same cafe where he first saw Adonis, hoping to see him again. Well, Tony rationalized to himself, I’m just gonna go and see if he’s there. There’s a chance that Adonis might not even be there, because who went to the same place two-days in a row? Certainly not Tony. Not unless he was after something. Or someone.
“Okay, Tony. We’ll name him Joseph.” Steve choked up a little, “Thank you, Tony. I’ve never even thought about it. Mostly because I didn’t think we would even have a second chance at having a son.”
“Tony,” Steve sounded so sad that Tony ached to hug him even after everything, “how could you even think that? Tony, you’re the love of my life. When you died, the only thing I wanted to do was curl up inside your casket and be buried with you,” Tony shook his head at Steve’s assertion. No, no, Steve couldn’t do that. He was worth so much more than Tony. The world needed Steve, not Tony, “I will love you no matter what you do, no matter what form you take. You think our love so shallow that it couldn’t survive you being reborn as a man? Tony--” Steve huffed and seemed annoyed as he hauled Tony to him, tucking Tony’s face in the crook of his neck, which Tony was more than happy to be. “Still so stubborn, even after all these years.”
“What-- “ Tony flinched, trying futilely to retract his hand from Steve’s, “No, Steve, I-- of course I want it. I just--” Tony broke off, seeming to realize something important. He peered at Steve, almost challenging, “why are you asking me this? What would you say if I said “No”, Steve?”
“Nat! Over here!” Clint called out to her. Natasha ran over to where Clint was kneeling on the ground. In front of him was the unconscious body of their pack leader. Steve lay unconscious on the ground, his shield fastened firmly to his back. His stealth suit covering one side of his body, keeping it protected. The other side, however, was completely decimated in the blast and as a result, Steve suffered burn wounds to the left side of his body. If Natasha had to estimate, it was a third degree burn taking away the skin from his face all the way to his groin.
And that’s how he met his first Hawai’ian friend, Clint Barton and his children, Lila, Cooper and Nate Barton. Clint is a single father, working at the Waikiki aquarium. His late husband, Phil, used to be in the military, stationed in the Marine Corps base in Hawai’i, and was killed in the line of duty. Prior to Phil’s death, the coupled adopted siblings Lila and Cooper from an orphanage in Clint’s hometown in Cleveland and later had Nate through surrogacy.
“This...was not what I expected.” Anthony and Steven finally landed on Delos and the first thing that caught their attention on the island was not the beautiful rolling hills or the lagoon that could be seen in the distance or the opulent Temple atop of a hill. Rather the first thing they saw was the massive statue of a phallus placed prominently on a flat land where they landed. Steven hid his face in the palms of his hands, embarrassed beyond belief at what his brother thought was a work of art. Anthony was still tilting his head this way and that way, studying the giant phallus statue. “I mean...no objections here. I like penises, and I think I would be a great fan of yours. But I just never thought of erecting a statue for it.”
Ulysses clutched at his boot and looked up at Steve with blue eyes brimming with tears, “How long will you be gone, Papa?” Tony had loosened his regulation on talking Italian only at home, ever since Ulysses started kindergarten and he became more exposed to speaking English. He would still talk in Italian to Ulysses and Ulysses had to answer back in Italian, but to everyone else he could now speak English.
The visions actually started when he was sixteen years old, right after his birthday. That day he threw a big party, much to Rhodey’s disapproval, one last bash before final exams and everyone made their way home for the summer. To say that Tony drank too much and took too much ecstasy that night would be an understatement. It was a night of firsts: the first time Tony and his then boyfriend Ty Stone had a threesome, and the first time he wasn’t completely in control of his faculties and was unable to firmly say yes or no, to anything they did that night.
“The dead guy-- chats me up last night.” he finally said. Steve furrowed his brow at Thor’s confession. “Okay...why didn’t you tell the police?”
“Did anybody touch it?” was the first words that came out of Fury’s mouth after he was summoned to look at the latest situation unfolding at Sarah’s.
“Or what? Really? You gonna put the squeeze on us retroactively?” Steve asked, having no patience nor tolerance to threats anywhere in the vicinity of his Omega.
Now that SI is out of the weapons business, and subsequently out of the business of tiresome DOD lobbying, he’s even more apolitical. He still votes at the midterm elections and the Presidential election (even though that last one was a total disaster) but Tony still wouldn’t consider himself a political person. He’s a registered Independent and his stance on most social issues can be considered to align most closely with the Democrats than with Republicans but he won’t be that celebrity urging people to go out and vote or endorsing a candidate. Sometimes Tony thinks his apolitical-ness is a product from the days where he had to appease public opinion for the longevity SI’s stocks and his employees’ well being.
.” Tony pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his lips, taking care not to disturb the graft on the other side, “I was so scared. When I saw on the gurney. I-- I’ve never seen you so still and silent before, Steve. I thought you’ve left me.”
“Tony,” Steve rushed forward to the omega, stopping short just in case Tony rejected his touch, “where have you been? Where did you go?”
of them, it was possible to achieve great things. Jamie was everything Joe remembered from middle school. That shy, smart boy who wasn’t afraid to stand up to bullies and treated everyone with respect regardless of their orientation. Joe was in trouble. He was falling for Jamie at terminal velocity, and there was no going back.
“Miscarriage?” Tony deflated at that, all the fight went out of his body and he slumped backwards onto the bed.
Steve woke up with the dawn as usual. His biological clock has long been trained to start with the sun after years of waking up at the crack of dawn for football practices. That day he woke up as usual, cocooned under soft warm blankets. In the cloudy haze of his mind, he registered the presence of another person in his bed. Whoever it was, they were warm to the touch and Steve felt a profound sense of contentment and warmth deep within him. He could stand to wake up to this feeling everyday, he thought as he drifted back to sleep. Deciding to chase after that feeling, Steve moved closer to the other person until he could feel the soft bristles of their hair brushed against his cheek as they finally shared one pillow. Steve decided to sleep in for today, it was Saturday after all.
“Thank you, Bruce,” Thor responded readily, “It is my favorite. Your butter chicken is better than even the finest meal I ever had in Asgard.”
“Ma was a nurse, you know. Sometimes we got patients in the middle of the night. Patients who couldn’t afford to go anywhere else, if you get what I mean.”
While there were some initial concerns on whether he’d be able to carry this pregnancy to term due to Tony’s advanced age (he’s old, he got it), the baby seemed to be hitting all the appropriate milestones. After the three month mark came and went and the probabilities of spontaneous miscarriage went down, everyone collectively breathed a sigh of relief. They were getting their pack baby after all.
Joe held out the bouquet to Tony expectantly, willing his father to take the flower arrangement. Tony took the bouquet from his son’s hand, observing it in his hands. It’s really happening, this was really happening. He and Steve would get to have a mating ceremony, and this time with their sons and their family in attendance. Tony looked at Steve, standing there in his white button up shirt, looking as handsome as the day Tony met him and Tony knew that he wouldn’t let his life go any other way than being with Steve and his sons.
They arrived home in the early afternoon, going their separate ways: Tony to the workshop to work on Ulysses’ car and Steve to his home office to sign some paperwork that Maria just send in. Two hours into his work on Ulysses’ car, Tony felt the pain from earlier in the morning came back, and this time it was accompanied by the excruciating feeling of muscle cramps around his pelvic region.
“He screamed like slutty girl number one on a B-horror movie,” Maria smirked. Natasha rolled her eyes at hearing Bruce’s reaction to a dead body. The situation only devolved from there with everyone insisting they didn’t kill anyone, Bruce still insisting he yelped, not scream and Barton not wanting to talk to cops because they would drug him and give him an anal probe.
Steve wasn’t gonna take any chances, he assumed a tackling position, then as fast as lightning he jumped and tackled the man on the ground. By the time Dad and Bucky barged into the room from hearing all the ruckus Steve caused, Steve was getting up from the floor where he tackled the man on to, the man unconscious.
“I don’t have any reason to lie to you, Anthony.” Steven tentatively reached out and took one of Anthony’s hand in his. The prince’s calloused palm felt grounding and real in Steven’s own hand. “It’s the truth.”
“When did you realize it wasn’t me?” Steve asked his mate as they walked into Tony’s office, closing the door behind them.
Steve rushed to hug him, “Baby, what happened? Clint said you had a panic attack. Did you see something..? Hear something? What’s going on?”
Tony felt Steve sighed tiredly next to him, “You better be winning or I’ll be donating your inheritance to the Trump Foundation.”
On their mutual days off, Tony and Steve always tried to spend time together, just the two of them. Some days, it would be date nights out in the City or just having a candlelit dinner up on the roof of Avengers Tower. Other times, they would spend the entire day on different day trips like exploring Brooklyn or going to different New England states. Today, however, they decided to stick close to home and go to Little Italy for lunch. Tony had a hankering for a tomato pie and Steve couldn’t say no to his mate. So they went to Lombardi’s for pizza. Steve was familiar with Lombardi’s as it was around when he had been growing up back in the 40’s. Back in the day it had been the first pizza place in New York, heck in the United States even. He and Bucky would save up their wages for a chance to buy a slice of their famous tomato pie. They would buy it during special occasions like one of their birthdays, or if Bucky got dumped by his dame of the week and needed some consolation. The price for a slice of pie back then was five cents, so nobody could blame Steve for the surprised shout that came out of his mouth when he saw that a whole pie now cost almost twenty bucks. Even after all this time in the future, inflation was still something he needed to get used to.
“What liquor best exemplifies death by substance abuse? Of course, Irish Whiskey.” Loki started talking in an Irish accent. Phil looked at him placidly, slowly drinking from his own water bottle,  “But what spirit best exemplify murder most foul?”
