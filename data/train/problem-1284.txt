“We were just…I mean. We were wondering if you guys... I mean obviously y-you... uh” Mike stuttered.
With a final clear of his throat, he released John’s face. “Right. Um. Get to work. No gesture drawing today. Just long poses.”
was so overwhelming, so grandiose that the necessity to be closer was palpable in the air. In the few weeks they’d been seeing each other Sherlock had guessed this might happen soon and was thus, prepared. He knew that John was clean, and he himself had never had any kind of sexual activity with anyone before John came along, but he’d bought condoms just in case John insisted, and a large bottle of lube.
“I said you’re an idiot” John smiled, pain still lingering in the edges, but fondness seeping into every corner.
“That’s… what is that exactly?” John asked, as he set his bag-pack under his seat and reached for some waffles from the spread of food in front of him on the table.
John grinned as the Gryffindor team all rushed towards him and surrounded him in an inescapable and overly enthusiastic hug. The captain laughed, the euphoria of winning to Slytherin effortlessly meant he would be in the final match against Ravenclaw. But above all..
John walked to the one beside that, the one the second before he had kissed Sherlock. “I can’t believe… you…” he licked his lips, a soft pink blush covering his cheeks.
quite shaken, but in the very best of ways.  He had never even imagined John would ever feel the same about him. And even if they still had to talk, confirm and discuss what they were and meant to each other Sherlock could not remember a time where he had felt more content than he did now lying across John’s chest, hearing his calming heartbeat and sleepy sighs against his hair.
John nodded “And we’ll write. Often. Right, Sherlock?”
As soon as Sherlock had sat back down he looked back at John, who was now turned away to look at a far wall in the distance. Sherlock counted the seconds in his head for 3 minutes and when they were up he opened his mouth to let John know it was time to switch but the second he opened it John was already shifting into a new pose. Impressed, Sherlock took a note of his on his notebook and observed as the students began scrambling to unclip their newspaper print papers from the drawing boards to get the second pose as fast as they could. Sherlock smiled, enjoying how the first part of the day was always the fastest one. Even when the students walked in looking tired as soon as the gesture poses began they all focused solely on their drawings, trying to get the weight of the body, the anatomy, and the scale right on their paper in the mere 180 seconds they had. The occasional squeak of charcoal on paper resounded through the room but aside from that the room was completely silent.
“Nope. No complaints. Sit down.” John gently pushed Sherlock onto the nearest chair and, coursing a hand through his soft curls on his way, went to prepare him breakfast.
The Gryffindor turned towards his own table following the voice. Molly and Greg were signalling him to come with enthusiastic waves of their hands.
“Alright, everyone stop slacking and get back behind your easels” Sherlock called out.
The Gryffindor quirked a brow “Is it? Or are you finally giving in to my amazing skills?”
Breakfast passed quickly, in between John and Sherlock telling Greg and Molly about their childhood adventures and John’s first magical experience with their own version of Quidditch. To this Greg responded excitedly with his own first magical experience when he was 8 and had made his mother’s cat Scruffles invisible for about an hour and only noticed when he’d when he tripped over her and nearly fallen head first down stairs. Molly had had her first experience when she was 7 and she’d fallen off her father’s boat into the sea. At the time she hadn’t known how to swim and had rapidly sunk into the murky waters, but when her lungs could take no more and she instinctively opened her mouth instead of the gush of water she’d expected to flood her mouth and lungs, she found that she could breathe.
The woman in the painting kept staring at Sherlock expectantly. His brow furrowed with every passing minute as he stared back. The chime of the clock signaling four in the morning had removed a part of his mind from the trance-like state he had been immersed in and already he could feel his back screaming in protest at being held in this same position for such a long time. The woman stared some more, silently challenging him with her dark brown eyes. He sighed, shattering the tense silence as he straightened up from his crouch with a pained groan. It was hopeless. This painting would not be finished tonight…. well, this morning he supposed.
“Sure, that sounds lovely” John smiled sweetly
She scratched at the wood on the table.
The first drop of rain landed on Sherlock’s nose, startling him.
“Take a seat, mate,” Greg said, motioning towards the empty space on the bench across from them with a smile.
The past couple of days had been... interesting. Sherlock simply couldn’t get his mind stop going back to John’s finger in his hair, his breath so close he could swear he almost felt it against his skin. For a moment he’d wondered what would happen if he turned his head and just… just… just what? Sherlock didn’t know. He’d never done anything like this before and wasn’t John… straight? There was absolutely no evidence pointing to the contrary, and as far as he remembered John had never expressed any kind of crush on any males. Granted, last time he’d seen him with a crush they’d been 11, but he very vividly remembered John expressing something akin to a crush on the ‘Bond girls’ whenever they watched his favourite movies. He also remembered feeling rather resentful of that and not knowing the reason why.
Madam Pomfrey, the smart woman, scattered away sensing the change of the tone in John’s voice when he spoke to Sherlock’s vulnerable figure.
Trelawney opened her mouth, perhaps to say something else about this supposed danger John was in, but the blonde just kept on walking towards the exit. Sherlock turned to one of the globes as he passed near one of the tables, something catching his eye, some kind of movement. A flash of red robes zooming past. A lock of blonde hair. And was that… a crunch he’d just heard? Sherlock shook his head, shaking himself out of it.
John’s gaze fell a little bit, thinking about how cold his own parents were towards the whole situation… and how cold they were towards any other situation ever. “Oh… they’re…around I’m sure” he tried to give his most convincing smile. As if understanding immediately Sherlock’s mum straightened up, finally letting go of Sherlock who looked tremendously relieved as he gasped a little for air and her smile fell a bit into a concerned expression.
“Why not? Why can’t you?” She demanded, ignoring Sherlock’s comeback.
“Redbeard”.
“OW! UGH!” Sherlock had attempted to turn them over so John wouldn’t hit his head with the fall but the result had been falling sideways where he slammed the side of his own face against the ice. He was fairly certain John was alright, though, judging by the grunt of pain instead of a cry.
A lifetime could have gone by as they stayed like that, staring at each other. Sherlock could easily see the anger starting to sizzle under John’s skin. Not unexpected, of course. But there was something else there. Not just sadness. Not just pain. Something more prominent Sherlock still couldn’t quite put his finger on.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond stubbornly but John was grinning at him, every bitter moment in the last few days vanishing instantly and just like that… things were back to the way they always were.
Scoffing Sherlock turned the page and started over.
“Come on, you. We need to clean ourselves up” his lover laughed softly against the damp skin of his collarbones.
“What happened to all that confidence that you’d win eh, Sherlock?” John called out, teasing.
John hummed in answer, feeling Sherlock’s breath delicately graze his face. “Yes I…uh.. yeah”  he whispered. Sherlock’s eyes were in a trance, glazed over as he looked down into John’s face. John licked his lips, feeling his heart racing up onto his throat and the warmth emanating from Sherlock into his own body closing in. Sherlock followed John’s tongue’s progress with his eyes, his pupils visibly dilating. John gasped.
Sherlock blushed looking down, trying to hide his smile
He had been sitting with his sister, Harry, staring blankly at the TV when the doorbell rang. He heard the usual scuffle from one of his disgruntled parents when interrupted from their work. Both parents worked from home and were usually extremely busy to deal with either of their children, hence the vacant stares of their children watching Television to alleviate their boredom.
“It is” Sherlock agreed, “I’m glad you like it. I’ve never been in this room at night with anyone before. Usually, I was by myself finishing up projects. I haven't been here in years.”
In surprise at the outburst, Sherringford let his hold on John go. John, in turn, fell back onto the pillows with a loud oo
“However by observing the wounds on the woman’s body, I deduced that they had been inflicted by someone extremely strong but inexperienced in body combat. The only thing the attacker had had for leverage on her had been his body mass. So, the only person that fit the profile and had a motive was her lover, the next door neighbour.”
“Sure is. Billy. Friend of mine… when I say, friend.” Sherlock smirked.
“Well then why did you want to camp without a tent? As I recall you said the cold wouldn’t be a problem!”
The model greeted her, grinning as the rest of the class agreed and welcomed him enthusiastically.Sherlock smiled, the fact that his class liked John and hadn’t even questioned having him here again making him sigh in relief. He caught Molly’s eye, she was smiling straight at him. Sherlock frowned, confused but made nothing of it and gave her a bemused smile back.
They both turned to look at each other in horror. “SHERLOCK! YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP THE ENTIRE CASTLE! DO SOMETHING!”
Now-familiar warmth spread across Sherlock’s chest, the butterflies in his stomach deciding to make a swooping motion. He stood up and walked over to the windowsill, picking up his violin. He closed his eyes and brought the violin close to his ear, plucking the strings softly, one by one to make sure that it was perfectly in tune. He then rose the bow and placed the violin under his chin. He looked at John one last time before he held the violin securely with his left hand.
“The bookth won’t come to you. It’s a thimple thpell.” The boy motioned towards said floating objects with a nod of his head and a small hand. “It doethn’t work just raithing a hand to them. You need to uthe magic. Not that you could anyway, you’re far too young to be heading to Hogthwarth.” He smirked at John’s confused expression.
“We’re wizards, John. We can surely figure this out.” Sherlock pressed his palms together and rested his chin on the tops of his fingers as if in prayer, though John recognised his thinking pose. He’d had the habit of posing like that since he was a very small child, after all. “OH!” Sherlock jumped up excitedly, his mouth shaped like an O John wanted to kiss IMMEDIATELY. Needed to, actually. He swayed very slightly forward towards where his friend stood, enchanted by the excited Beauxbatons and his snow-rosy cheeks and wide eyes, sparkling with a brand new idea.
John was blinking back tears, his grip on Sherlock’s thigh firm, supporting himself from crumbling down. “That bloody asshole… I can't believe he would do that…. Why?”
“You didn’t hear? Everyone on the train was talking about it!”
“Really?!” John beamed.  “That’d be so great! Let me just… find my mum to ask. She’s probably around the counter checking her messages” with one parting grin John ran outside to find his mother.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. He leant in closer, close enough to feel Sherlock’s warm soft breaths mingle with his own. Their noses were inches apart now, almost touching as the hand John had against Sherlock’s chest rose up to cup his friend’s neck. “I-” he breathed. “I… Sher-”
The artist could only nod as he unbuttoned his shirt as fast as he could and fumbled with his belt and zipper. As soon as he’d toed off his shoes and socks though, John stopped him.
“SHERLOCK!”
“I mean, I like
Sherlock sighed, draping his arm across John’s chest and holding him close. “Goodnight, John”, he said softly and let sleep drift him off away in his now-lover’s arms.
to visit this summer!” he shot Sherlock an excited look.
Sure, the windows framed were painted a bright forget-me-not pink, and as soon as they opened the door there sure was a lot of lace and flowery prints everywhere. But this was a date. John Watson was taking HIM out on a date. And so. It was perfect. Absolutely perfect.
A few weeks later, well into the summer, they were playing in the gardens. One moment they were playing Quidditch… well “playing”, and the next, everything changed.
Just as he was rounding the corner he spotted them, three Beauxbatons boys surrounding none other than Sherlock Holmes himself. Sherlock Holmes, who was currently sporting what looked to be a rather impressive scowl considering they were three against one. John could definitely see the trace of fear in his eyes, but he knew that he was probably the only one of them who could. John, unfortunately, still knew Sherlock’s expressions like the palm of his hand after training himself for years to see past the seemingly cool mask of indifference.
“You do?” John asked, surprised. “How come I didn't know that?”
John thought. He shoved Anderson against the wall and leant close to his face, his eyes darkening in anger. “Try me,” he hissed.
“It was... not what I expected it to be. I pictured a few years to get my medical degree and to return back home. But…to be honest with you…” he looked back at the stars above them, remembering watching the same stars back in the hot desert. “I stayed because I felt needed. When I got shot I let my people down... So many men I could’ve saved. But I just wasn’t paying enough attention” he shook his head.
“Very good Mr. Holmes, 5 points to Ravenclaw! Perhaps you would like to talk about its immediate stimulus effects for a further 10 points?”
“Not your father then?” John prompted carefully, taking a long sip himself. The tea, as expected, was perfect.
Therein was the problem
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered, “Is that okay?”
Sherlock held John tighter, silently encouraging him to go on.
Sherlock had never moved so fast in his life. He turned to look at her, afraid, and .. a little impressed he had to admit. Sherlock had been careful. The only person who had ever known about his….
of this one won't have any severe long
Sherlock opened his mouth again, but once more closed it, frowning.
John laughed “Of course you did. Well then, how did the killer do it?”
SO CHEESY YOU GUYS IM SORRY! But they just WANT to be cheesy and who am I to deny them??
“Well, you know... always in the office but happy overall. She certainly knows how to keep me happy anyway” she winked, laughing. A couple of the students laughed with her. Kate, Irene’s girlfriend, used to be a figure model as well until she decided she wanted to pursue a career in law, instead.
John grinned back. “That sounds great! But- we don’t have any skates.”
that connection, and with knowing he was not really John’s ‘love’, it was too much. He would not take it.
John laughed, “Naturally”.
“Violet! I haven’t spoken to her in so long! That’s so sweet of her to write! Open it!”
Sherlock stared at his drawing, a funny feeling growing inside his stomach. Nerves? Why on earth was he feeling nervous?
“Gorgeous…” John finished, leaning closer. Sherlock’s eyes opened slowly, meeting John’s gaze in a now familiar strike of electricity between them. John raised his other hand and took Sherlock’s face between both of them, his cheeks significantly warmer than they had been a moment ago.
He closed his eyes and felt John pull up the sheet around them, “Goodnight, Sherlock”, he kissed his temple tenderly.
his brain screamed at him. He momentarily panicked internally, wondering whether tackling was still a socially unacceptable move. He quickly ran down a list of possible normal way to distract John before he just squawked “Youcan’tgointhere!”
Sherlock regretted his words immediately “No! It’s… it’s fine”
Not that John was complaining either. Sherlock was soft and pliant under him, pulling him in with both hands bunched to the front of his winter jacket, as if unwilling to even consider letting him go for a second. He was enthusiastic, kissing John with all he had. He was clearly inexperienced but made it up with sweetness and eagerness, and it was bloody brilliant. John slowly showed him how to tilt his jaw and soothed his ragged desperate breaths with gentle tugs to his silky curls until it was just soft moans and quiet brushes of lips unwilling to separate. Breathing was, unfortunately, still an essential factor to live, and so they had to pull away eventually. They separated panting and keeping their eyes shut, fearing this was all a dream and wanting to stay asleep within each other’s embrace forever.
John smiled brightly at her and said goodbye, seeming to thank her once more for whatever she’d typed on his phone. He then turned around and starting looking for something in his surroundings. He met Sherlock’s eyes. And even now... the artist couldn’t help it when his heart skipped a beat when John smiled at him. He couldn’t help the need to be enclosed in his arms when the blonde took a look at him and frowned in what looked like concern and started walking his way.
He took out his mobile and turning around into the direction of his flat he dialed Angelo’s number.
Sherlock snorted, of course, the first thing John would say after 7 freaking hours of being UNCONSCIOUS would be some sort of joke. “You’re the one who got hit by a BLUDGER!”
John looked down at their hands. He could think of a very logical way of decreasing the amount of space between their hands and pull each other more efficiently. But even the thought of suggesting–
John laughed “Yeah. So… how’re you doing? No no don’t look at me like that… I mean it. Did you answer your mother’s letter?”
“Mate.. n’ffense. Like. I know you like Mary. But she’s a real jerk.” He stuffed more food into his mouth, still attempting to talk. “You could dho sho muchf beffer thfan her” he garbled out, shrugging.
twice. John crawled up Sherlock’s long body once more and captured those perfect rosy lips, still marveling at the fact that he was finally allowed to. His opened pliantly beneath him, tongue much more confidently exploring inside his mouth, tasting every inch of him and, no doubt, cataloguing everything.
John clenched and unclenched his free hand, barely containing his anger. He remembered that scum of a man vividly. The way he treated Sherlock. And the way he treated his mother. It was absolutely despicable. He remembered seeing him corner her in their kitchen and yell abuse at her, how the only thing that stopped him was the explosion of the small flower pot John had accidentally detonated in his anger. For a moment now, John wished that the exploding pot had been Sherringford. He exhaled shakily, trying to calm himself down. “None of this is your fault, Sherlock. None of it” he leaned closer to the Beauxbatons, who was looking down at his folded hands with a pained look. John swallowed down with difficulty, his throat dry. “After he left… that was about a year ago right? After that… why didn’t you write then? I would’ve come to you, Sherlock. I would’ve done anything.”
“You MUST John. I need this. I need you to do this for me. Please” he sounded agonised.
In the back of his mind, the artist knew they really shouldn’t be doing this. Not just because they were still in school…Still in his classroom. But because they really needed to sort themselves out. They needed to have a talk to know what they meant to each other. Whether this was just physical attraction and a way for both of them to get off- or whether John did, in fact, want something… more. But it was so difficult to think… with the other man’s hand around them both. Feeling him against his body, the grand expanse of chest sheathed in sweat, pliant and warm underneath his roaming hands. It was so hard to care about anything other than the man under him when he could pull John’s lips with his teeth, stroke John’s tongue with his tongue, elicit gorgeous deep moans from that exquisite throat every time he thrust into the tight hold of his closed fist.
“No Sherlock you passed out in potions smelling the.. Amortentia” John said a little too tensely
Lestrade played the two short tapes to John and Sherlock.
John inched closer and licked his lips, his breath now caressing Sherlock’s face gently “Me either” he whispered and nudged at Sherlock’s face with his own, searching. With one last look at Sherlock’s open and vulnerable face, John closed his eyes and kissed Sherlock’s awaiting pink lips and sighed.
He showed John everything from his books on magical creatures (Who knew dragons actually existed?) to his extensive collection of magical candy (chasing a chocolate frog across the Holmes’ humongous lawn was definitely not as fun as it sounded… except in retrospect… it was).
“Well, class today we’re going to observe the effects of a very common but highly potent potion. Can anyone tell me what potion created powerful effects on infatuation or obsession on the drinker?”
“Amortentia” answered Sherlock instantly, without taking his eyes off John.
John felt his cheeks grow hot in slight embarrassment at being caught out but he could see Sherlock’s lovely blush spreading to so he just grinned. “Yup… told you I wasn’t just hungry for food” he winked.
“Reading” Sherlock huffed, uninterested
going to confirm them for them just now. He shared a tiny private smile with John but promptly went back to talking about the drawings on the wall, entirely missing how most of his class had stopped paying attention and were staring at each other with surprised and proud smiles towards their professor and their model.
John coursed a hand through his hair, huffing a laugh “Oh.. yeah, I’d like that”
“That was- I… you…thank you” the artist sighed, his cheeks already flushed but managing to darken a shade at the admission. He closed his eyes, shifting closer to John’s body and being immediately engulfed by the blonde’s strong arms and tucking his head beneath his chin to kiss lightly at his neck.
They were led to a round table on the edge of the balcony on the second floor that overlooked the bottom level, decorated with a velvet red candle and a tasteful bouquet of lilies. All around them were small groups of friends and couples enjoying each other’s company. The floors were red and black checkered squares and above them, a golden chandelier hung high into the sunken beige ceiling. The shape brought the artist’s mind back to the dome on the fifth floor and his heart warmed.
“Uh huh”
Sherlock observed the tapes in quick blinks, taking in the small details before turning back to observe the man on the floor. He took in the man’s clothing items, the positioning of the body and the items surrounding him in the room and smiled. He was about to speak when-
Sherlock greeted them softly before sitting down beside John, fidgeting with his thumbs and seemingly at a loss of what to say next. John wondered if Sherlock perhaps would’ve liked to sit with his own Beauxbatons friends... he was about to ask Sherlock if he wanted to bring them over when Sherlock finally spoke.
He took a deep breath and resumed talking, just as quickly. “This of course for the wife to sneak into the hotel after the lover left, sneak in poison into her husband’s drink and then after he had collapsed left a staged set where it would look like her husband had killed himself. The police are then, of course, befuddled and pay far less attention to the crime scene and more to the tapes. Thus, completely miss the evidence that ruled out suicide completely and incriminated her instead. There. Solved it.”
“There goes the Quaffle and... Watson scores again!” Sherlock heard the voiceover say. It was Henry Knight, a  7
Thank you SO much for reading
“Oh uh... hey Sherlock!” He grinned nervously.
A sudden knock at his studio’s door interrupted his wandering mind and he jumped, almost knocking over his empty cup of tea on the table beside him as he rose up quickly from his seat.
“Goodbye! Thanks again” John called out after him, before closing the door with a wide grin on his face. How did Sherlock even know where he lived? John laughed. Of COURSE Sherlock Holmes knew where he lives. He probably knew John’s cellphone number and laptop password already too. John chuckled again, clutching his cane but marveling at the fact that he was standing on his own two feet, cane raised up on one of his hands, no longer feeling like a floatation device in John’s ocean but a mere object in his hand. There was almost no pain in his leg. Only the slight sting of soreness and disuse but it no longer cramped and complained where John balanced his weight onto it.
Luckily for them they made it to the class just in time, barely a couple of minutes before the bell rang. Unluckily for them, the whole class was very used to their professor being extremely early and so, the entire class was already there, waiting. Them both walking in together was most certainly not a way to keep things discrete. And John having his hand on the small of Sherlock’s back perhaps just a hair just too low to be considered platonic.
Sherlock didn’t look quite as enthusiastic. “She never sends letters by themselves. She usually sends them with packages…”. He looked at the seal sceptically before he tore it open and took out the letter. It wasn’t very long, just a single page. Sherlock swept his eyes over it rapidly, his face blanching with every word he read, his lips purse tightly and his fist clenched against the table. Without looking at either John, not Molly he stood from the table, picked up his tiny cauldron with the finished tranquillizer potion and downed it in one gulp and stormed away from the great hall.
“And Sherlock won't be taking any new model’s any time soon. Thanks.” He continued, voice tight and clearly aiming to be threatening but not enough to make a scene. Angry John made quite an impression, though. Especially when he forced a pleasant smile on his face. His presence in the room seemed to grow ten times his size and the art critics smug smirk slowly faded away to a displeased twisted scowl.
As the new students filled up the front of the hall McGonagall started to divide them between houses, where they’d sit in the empty spaces, most of them looking anxious and a little lost. John didn’t blame them. This really must feel like a very first day at a new school… and he certainly remembered how lost
John dropped his hand as soon as they walked in, laughing about something Sherlock had said about that morning when Mrs. Hudson had barged into Sherlock’s room. She had been carrying the artist’s morning tea and biscuits while they’d been snogging feverishly under the sheets with clear intention for some kind of variation of slow morning sex. She’d squeaked in surprise at the sight of them, dropping the whole tray as Sherlock yelped in indignation and made sure they were both fully covered. John had just kind of lied there, frozen in shock, lips still pursed as if they were still kissing Sherlock and staring at Mrs. Hudson in alarm. After what John was certain had been the most awkward introduction of history
CANT they just sit down talk and then make out? I'll write faster. The faster I write the faster we can get through this oblivious pining <3<3
Today was the second class of the week, the last one he would get to see John for god knows how long.
“Yes. I did” God he was even duller than the reporters.
… how had he
John hummed at Molly’s answer “Just curious”, he shrugged. He still couldn’t place the memory... but he’d definitely heard that name somewhere.
Sally snickered
“He can be a dickhead?”
The Gryffindor tasted of tea and warmth and home, and Sherlock wanted to chase the taste, drown in it and feel it consume him. He opened his mouth with a gasp as John pulled teasingly on his curls and John took the invitation willingly, sweeping in a warm, curious tongue and grazing it gently against Sherlock’s with a soft moan of his own. It was perfect. John was perfect.
“John!” a high voice called.
letting him see how these past few weeks… had been so nerve-rackingly incredible. And if he let himself dream and hope he could almost fool himself into believing that John did it all on purpose. The lingering looks beneath lowered eyelids, the accidental brushes of hands, the teasing…
Sherlock watched him take a couple of steps away from him and panicked.  “John!” he shouted out unthinkingly. Suddenly, the thought of not seeing John for the rest of the day was somehow painful. And the look on John’s face… it was almost like he DIDN’T want them to be apart either. Like… he
“Oh... umm... okay? A man’s body was found overdosed in a hotel room, apparently a suicide. But the security camera shows the same man checking out of the hotel room and leaving the day before he was found, never coming back inside.”
Ten fast minutes in, the Gryffindor team had scored 4 times, and Slytherin none, with the practiced and mastered tactics John taught them during the endless early morning practices. And the captain himself was zooming like a flash to the ground where he extended a hand and caught the glowing snitch with a skilled snatch.
“I think I’d rather do standing now. Get it over with.” he positioned himself in the centre of the stage and started untying his robe. Sherlock busied himself with the lights, placing the around the stage, some overhead and some below, and finally when he felt the air rush past from John dropping the robe and swinging it onto the floor off of the platform Sherlock knew that he had to adjust the lighting to John’s body so he took a breath, and looked up.
John shifted closer to Sherlock, his stomach feeling a completely different kind of heavy. Like he was falling all over again.
“He must be really in love” Mike whispered just as John crossed the frame of the wooden door.
Reaching for his hand John led them away from Zonko’s joke shop and off the main road and towards a place he hadn’t been in quite a while.
And subsequently, John’s heart fell from his chest like a dropped stone into his stomach.
pictures!” John beamed.
“Uh.. umm” Mary stumbled out
Sherlock looked up, rolling his wet robes and tucking them under his arm along with the box containing the bludgers and bats they’d used for practice.
“Uhh… Afghanistan. How did you-”
At nightfall, they went back to the store. The company of this new boy seeming so natural. So familiar, it was kind of bizarre to think they’d only met earlier that afternoon.
Sherlock’s heart stopped, his arm yanked out into the air, trying mindlessly to catch the boy as he fell unconscious from his broom. Sherlock watched helplessly as the Gryffindor boy fell further and further from him and closer to the ground.
John went slowly, letting Sherlock’s body adjust and whispering soft words into his ear, Sherlock did his best to focus, but caught only strands and bits of the sentences; “gorgeous”, “perfect”, “Yes”, “Amazing”… it was enough for the artist, with just those he could feel his tension melt away as he experimentally bore down onto John’s cock and felt himself be filled even further. More pleasure than pain, now, rippling down his spine.
Sherlock rolled his eyes “Fine.”
“He’ll change John. He’s just... stressed about work. The move will make it better. He promised. And…I have nowhere else to go. I love him.”
The next day, Sherlock woke up extra early to make up for sleeping in late yesterday. Well, late for his usual schedule anyway.
“Is.. everything okay?"
Irene was a model not like any other. For starters, she didn’t even bother with a modesty robe. Proving this very point, she walked about from behind the changing screen already entirely naked and climbed onto the platform, still surprising the students with her confidence even after being a regularly booked model in the class.
“Oh… I’d- yeah. I- I’d like that” Sherlock smiled. John smiled back softly, wondering if tucking that stubborn curl behind Sherlock’s ear would be alright with the Beauxbatons and almost raising his hand to do just that when just that second a small envelope dropped in front of Sherlock with a smack.
A woman was at the door. But not just any ordinary woman. She was wearing emerald green robes with golden stitching patterns that touched down onto the floor, draped by a long black cloak and wearing on top of her head a matching pointed hat. She looked… well… a bit weird to be frank.
Nothing at all.
Sherlock tore away from the model’s gaze and looked up at him, without letting go of John’s hands. The waiter looked a little embarrassed at haven clearly interrupted, but Sherlock was pleased to see he wasn’t fazed by the clear tenderness in the intimate moment between himself and John. “We’ll both have the lasagna, please”, he said “And your best bottle of wine”, he added with a smirk.
As soon as Sherlock turned on the lights John's eyes flew to the studio door. It was open and John could just barely peek into the striped white walls inside. He said nothing, however, remembering how last time he had tried to go in Sherlock had instantly panicked.
John didn’t answer Sherlock’s smile, instead, he started walking rapidly towards him, his face stony still, unmoving. Sherlock swallowed loudly, not able to read John’s expression and suspecting John was still unsure as to what he would do when he reached him. But Sherlock knew. He knew he was gonna get punched. It wasn’t the first time and it certainly would be the last. Not that he blamed John. Better just get this over with. Sherlock closed his eyes, waiting for the hit.
“Sherlock! So nice to see you again! What brings you here?” his jolly voice boomed out.
“John.. I…” Sherlock had stood up now, he looked down at the floor as if unable to meet John’s eye. “I… Thank you,” he said.
Spicy foods.
“Greg. Molly. This is Sherlock. The friend from childhood I was telling you about” he grinned, unable to contain his excitement.
“I have a part time job as a consulting detective-
“You have questionth” Sherlock raised a brow looking at him, his high soft voice slightly tinged with easy amusement.
agree that James Bond movies are the greatest movies ever made?” John laughed
John groaned, his shoulders sore from the pull when Sherlock fell and his back aching where it had hit the mattress first. “Sher- you okay?” He asked, his breath still coming back to him.
If you caught the A very potter musical reference we can now be best friends.
Great. Just fantastic.
All in all, everything seems to be right with the world….
“Wait wait wait. How did you know he was innocent? And how were you even in contact with the police?”
Mind made up Sherlock stalked to his laptop sitting on his desk and opened up the school’s website and onto the teachers section under his name. He scrolled through the list of next week’s available models and found ‘John H. Watson’. He hesitated briefly over the button that read
Sherlock tore the letter out of the envelope as John finally reached the pair, Eliza with both hands pressed together against her grin and glassy, beaming eyes and Sherlock still in the process of yanking the letter out from the envelope. Finally, he managed to get it out and basically pressed his nose against it with how closely he started reading it. John reached for his own envelope, turning it front and back… just to… just to make sure. And there… there it was.
Okay. That was enough now. Sherlock opened his mouth again, now fully prepared to scathe and insult this man to an inch of his life, press be damned. John. His COUSIN? He had
“Yes. I should think so. We’ll start with 3-minute gesture poses and then with half hour ones. Would you rather do standing up poses in this morning session or in the afternoon session?” Sherlock asked, not making eye contact but pleased that his voice sounded completely natural and calm. He stood up from his chair and walked over next to John who was stepping onto the platform at the centre of the room. The students were also beginning to get up from their stools and were stretching their arms or choosing charcoal for the gesture poses in the first hour.
Sherlock was sitting on the Ravenclaw stands reading a book, cradling it with his long pale fingers. Just as John peered at him from the distance Sherlock looked up from the pages and their eyes met for a split second before the Beauxbatons looked back down as fast as possible. John could just distinguish a slight pink tint on his face.
“That was… amazing” John continued. His muscles had completely relaxed and he was smiling, his eyes shining with surprise and was that… admiration? ‘
They reached the edge of the police tape, the shorter man rose it as high as he could and guided the artist under it, afterwards ducking down himself.
Sherlock finished telling John about his experiment and John, brilliant as he was, asked all the right questions and smiled and laughed at all the appropriate moments.
As soon as John was poised on the stage and the lights were set to Sherlock’s exact liking the class began to draw. John dropped the robe and got into a pose, closing his eyes against the brightness of the light. Sherlock waited at least 5 minutes into the first pose before he stopped circling the room in silence and sat down on his desk. He picked up his favourite graphite 5b pencil and began to draw. The moment the added sound of Sherlock’s pencil scratching the surface of the paper John opened his eyes and looked over at Sherlock. There was no change in his stance, his pose was naturally facing the professor and so their eyes met from across the room, the glaring lights contrasting against the dark classroom and giving John an unearthly glow that sparked imaginings of candlelight in Sherlock’s imagination.
John turned to Sherlock, who was still frozen in shock on the floor. One of his cheekbones seemed to be forming a rather impressively sized bruise. John’s heart ached with every passing second where the silence just lengthened between them. John didn’t know whether he wanted to hug or punch him.
Gladstone flapped his wings in what seemed to be a shrug and took the letter with him, back into the night, where Sherlock waited in front of his own bedroom window, anxiously.
John looked down at him as if having not expected that answer to come from Sherlock’s lips. But in a moment he saw Sherlock’s thoughts reflected in his eyes, the magnificence of the things one didn’t expect and the realization that things you never hoped could unexplainably and amazingly come to be “Yeah..” he whispered, a small smile on his face “You’re right. Maybe it will be”.
“You know him?” She asked, peering at Sherlock more closely now.
“Tea..butterbeer... summer...broomstick wood... grass.. it's..J-”
“Yes. Are we done with small talk now?”
“Newborn mandrakes John! They have amazing magical qualities! They grow at alarming rates so finding them at this stage is really quite rare,” he peered into the pot, enthralled. “Maybe if I just…” he reached over to the tips of the leaves peeking out of the dark soil.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and looked at him carefully but finding none of the tension he had seen in his friends shoulders and carefully controlled expressions from the past two days. John looked happy. Nervous but happy.
The buzz of conversation in the room slowly started to pick up to where it had left off before John had arrived.
Molly laughed, “yeah, he can be. But no. I learned that wherever he is, whatever he’s doing… He wants you there. He- he feels the same way about you, John” And then she smiled sweetly and walked away before he could even begin to think about his protests.
They walked into the store and a heavy scent of old and new books drifted through the air. While Margaret Watson checked her mobile and Jack waited by the cashier waiting to pay for whatever Harry picked out, John drifted away from Harry’s side, feeling curious as he caught some of the titles around him. He saw everything, from “Magical beasts and where to find them” to “Quidditch through the ages”. What even
“I cannot believe you convinced me to buy him.”
“Well, I can’t wait to see that!” John smiled, honestly. He’d been curious to see Sherlock actually playing his own position on the team for ages. Frankly, he was a little more curious to see the Beauxbatons Quitich uniforms, or rather, how Sherlock looked like in his Quidditch uniform. The day of the match really couldn’t come fast enough.
He and John had spoken a little more about Sherlock’s deductions and his military background, eye contact completely uninterrupted and more… intense than what was usually socially acceptable between strangers, but it had not felt uncomfortable at all. That was until Sherlock noticed the lack of sounds of graphite scratching the paper and he had turned to his students to demand why everyone had stopped drawing in favour of staring at them and for them to please continue and focus on the model before them, that’s why they were paying for college was it not? Everyone had instantly snapped back into their drawings and John’s muffled laughter was the only sounds accompanying the scurried scratches of pencils in tandem
Ill update some time next week <3<3
“Oh… so how did you-?”
“Bloody hell. Shit. Let me see that. Hang on”. John reached into his back pocket for his wand, did a series of complex movements with it towards his feet and melted the ice and the ends of it with a rush of hot air. He did the same for Sherlock’s and helped them both off the icy lake and into the snowy ground where he sat Sherlock down to look over his wound. He peeled Sherlock’s hand away from his own cheek and took a clean tissue from his pocket to clean the blood. It wasn’t a lot of blood, which was good. And the bruising was also minimal.
“What? I was not..” he tried to come up with a relatively convincing argument in his head but Molly’s knowing smile gave no room for his escape.
“Hey!” John laughed. “I was
They all turned to watch the headmistress stand in front of the podium and raise her hands in a mute plea for silence. The whole room quieted down in a matter of milliseconds.
“Yeah… m’fine. You… you go first”
Lestrade looked confused by Sherlock’s request but nodded, turning to motion the other policemen taking samples off to give both Sherlock and John some room to work in.
just as much as Sherlock wanted him. But that was impossible… wasn’t it?
Sherlock watched him. In just one week the man looked completely different. A good kind. If the professor had thought that John looked amazing last week he clearly had had no perspective on how he could look. John was absolutely glowing. His already tanned skin had a joy in feeling the power in both his legs once more.
Sherlock just smirked, “Well at least you can tick off that last one on the list” he glanced down at John’s legs.
John heard Sherlock take a deep breath. “No.” he whispered. John waiting for him to explain. “It..it didn’t work John.”
Sherlock swallowed down his disappointment. He still wanted John in his life. No matter how much John was willing to give him. He would take anything. Resolving to put the kiss behind them and try his best to forget about the precious seconds of memory he had with John he smiled back as friendly as he cold manage.

“Not deducing. You’re late”
Now that the shock was wearing off of the Beauxbatons, he turned to John, wanting to share a moment of shared incredulity with him so they could both shrug off the ridiculousness of that prophecy with a laugh. There was no other way to react, really.
But now I feel so motivated to give these two the loving ending they deserve. As far as I'm concerned Johnlock is canon. They're in love, and we know it. And if the show won't- WE can give them the ending they deserve <3<3
They approached the body, Sherlock instantly kneeling beside it and raising the man’s left hand for closer inspection. “What do you think John?”
Soon the hall was filled with the cries of the hat “Gryffindor! Ravenclaw! Hufflepuff! Slytherin!” and applause coming from each table.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You like that?” John whispered, smiling against him
“What house do you
Angelo bought them their customary ice creams, knowing their preferred flavour by now after all these years and hot summer evenings and ice cream flavour testing. But today they didn’t walk in with their arms full of candy and things bought from “Weasley’s wizard wheezes” as usual, they came with bags full of books and potion ingredients, their eyes alight and grins stretching so hard it must’ve hurt.
“Hey you!” John turned to Sherlock and laid a sloppy wet kiss on the side of the rapidly blushing Beauxbaton’s neck.
John smiled sadly, remembering yet another thing Sherlock had said years ago. “Gryffindor,” he said. “I’d like to be Gryffindor.”
Sherlock shook his head “It’s entirely possible, John. It’s going to be… amazing. Imagine our firs day at Hogwarts! Getting sorted into houses… I bet you’re a Gryffindor. I'll be a Ravenclaw, obviously. And soon enough we’ll be proper wizards.” He turned to look back at the stars, his face filled with delight.
“Jo-hn” he hissed brokenly. “please” he didn’t even know what he was begging for but needed it. He needed John and he needed him now.
“Finish it fast. If you don’t practice you won’t stand a chance against me, John.” John gasped dramatically and nudged Sherlock’s shoulder teasingly, Sherlock felt his cheeks heat. Maybe the school’s heating problem also affected the library? Why else would he be so susceptible to blushing so frequently nowadays?
A full day had gone by since and John hadn’t caught a single glimpse of the man again. Not even at breakfast. He’d scanned the tables one by one trying to grasp even a hint of those unmistakable curls or a flash of those icy green-grey eyes but... nothing. Part of him wondered if he’d seen Sherlock at all but not even his imagination was as good as to imagine…
John finally turned to look back at Sherlock, feeling utterly overwhelmed. “Thank you,” he said. He wasn’t sure why he said it. But he could not help it. John felt as if he had been staring at something even more like himself than when he stared into a mirror. As if Sherlock had somehow captured a piece of his soul and being and had sheathed it into the darkness of the shadows and the starkness of the lights in the drawing.
“I don’t know what you mean, sir” John’s composure was calm. Eerily so. As if awaiting the moment Sherringford would strike to strike right back. His back was perfectly straight, his hands still and unclenched.
And the soft sound he had made when John had pulled gently as his hair would be ones to haunt him for the rest of his life. A soft whimper John wanted to believe had been in pleasant surprise.
Currently, Sherlock was prattling on about all the magical instances he’d had since he and John had seen each other the summer before, balancing between talking, stuffing food in his face and not choking. The details as to how exactly Sherlock attained his first burst of magic was still unclear in John’s understanding but he guessed it didn’t really matter that much. Not when he and Sherlock would be going to Hogwarts together. At last. In just a few more months.
So yeah-- little bit of everything in this chapter- ranging from angst to fluff etc etc.... In other words John and Sherlock age 10 <3<3
John looked surprised “Your galleries?”
“Did she call just you bumble-”
“Yes, it is!” John laughed. “Not my fault I’m too good at batting”.
was never far.
Sherlock looked down and met John’s gaze. “Trust me, if anyone had been in the building during what we… got up to” he swallowed thickly, face flaming red “they most certainly would’ve heard and barged in”. He said it with a calm, even voice but John could see the rosy colour tinging his cheeks and bit the inside of his to stop the dirty remarks he might have made and settled for a pleased if slightly naughty smile.
“Great. We’ll begin immediately if that’s alright with you. The changing screen is over there” he motioned towards the left corner of the room with his head, trying not to blush at John’s easy going smile. Why had his pulse suddenly elevated?
to spend more time with John. Although… he did seem happy to spend time with him when they were together. But then again maybe was just being nice? And John couldn’t just bring it up halfway through a divination class. ‘Hey Sherlock I know we haven’t really talked in 5 years but why did you never answer any of my letters? Also, why am I suddenly so nervous around you? Did you do something to your hair?’ No. That conversation would not go over well.
, Sherlock Holmes”.
Sherlock, begrudgingly, of course considered her to be one of the closest things he had to consider a friend. Until John came along. But best not to think about John too much right now.
Day 10 before Hogwarts
“I’m fine.” The shorter boy murmured softly. He looked down again, feeling his palms become sweaty and his spine shiver with chills. “I’m... I’m fine.” His breath sped up as he took a step forward towards the edge of the roof. His mouth becoming drier with every passing beat of his racing heart.
Thanks for reading and commenting!! <3<3<3 Hopefully ch3 will take less than a week to post.
“I… I” he panted, unable to find the words.
John rolled his eyes. “I know I know… but it’s not like that guys. I mean. We’re not. He’s not…”
the teasing. It almost seemed like- like John wanted this. Wanted
(See the end of the chapter for
John reached down and took Sherlock in hand too, both stroking each other wetly and knowing at the pace they were going this wasn’t going to take very long anymore but enjoying every pleasurable second.
He began playing. Slow soft notes resounded through the small living room, reverberating in Sherlock’s chest and heartbeat. He didn’t play a song he knew by heart. He played notes as he felt them, sweet and tingling across the space between himself and John Watson. He thought about John. About the pink colour of his lips, the blue of his eyes, the tanned gold of his skin. He thought about his hands, the rough callouses on his fingers and how they might feel against the skin of his neck. He thought about how they had run across the streets side by side and it had felt completely natural. As if they had been doing it their entire lives. He thought about how John had looked at him when Sherlock had deduced the killer to an inch of his life, the widened mouth in an awestruck smile. But above all, he thought about John’s laugh. Above
She… she gave him her number? Why would she do that?
“No no. Even without the wound, it was plain to see. I knew from the moment you walked into class. Obvious really. From the manner in which you hold yourself, from the difference in tan in your face and arms onto where the skin shifted in the neckline, plus the psychosomatic limp”
“I have to go.” Sherlock told Irene. “I have… something to do”
John had smiled softly, marveling at the sight of a bemused, sleepy Sherlock trying his best to finish the new painting of him. He’d felt a rush of fondness, of want, of adoration that instead of a greeting or a gentle request to come back into bed to sleep he just murmured the words he’d wanted to for months, for the very first time.
“And now we see Holmes and Watson finally getting their act together. About time too, I’d say. Captain Watson will finally have Holmes, and I mean this indelicately”
“Oh god yes” he panted, turning to take John’s earlobe between his teeth and tugging. He instantly started unbuttoning John’s shirt with shaking clumsy fingers as fast as he could.
They were just walking past Eeylops Owl Emporium, when John stopped, gazing at one of the owls within the shop with wide eyes. It was a white and gold barn owl, with a small pointy beak and two marble black eyes, staring at him intently. It turned its head, curiously as John did the same.
“Oh, nothing. I was just thinking” Sherlock smiled back.
“We are literally in your backyard,” John giggled.
Danger. Maybe that was what Sherlock’s heart was trying so desperately to communicate to him. Sherlock tried to figure out why. It was definitely the thrill of a correct deduction. But it was so much more than that… John’s smile and numerous praises had burst small bubbles of elation inside Sherlock. He wanted to see that smile again. He never wanted to see John not smiling. Or limping again. Sherlock stood there watching the bus retreat in the far distance swallowing hard, and not knowing what to do with all these emotions or how to make sense of them. But there
Sherlock blinked “…okay.” He didn’t sound convinced, but thankfully, he let it go. “So… guess we’re gazing into our futures today, huh?” Sherlock joked feebly, nodding to the crystal balls in front of them.
“Are you alright John?”
“Hey” he smiled hesitantly “You alright?”, he glanced at Dimmock, who was just now realizing that Sherlock had not heard a single word he had said and was huffing in frustration and turning around to leave with a loud “Whatever, freak!”.
He drew the memory of their intimate moments into the light reflected from John’s neck and shoulders, the darkening love bites he sucked onto his neck, the remaining redness in his lip, his hair- mussed up by the movements, the squashy pillows and Sherlock’s pulling and caressing fingers. Sherlock lovingly sketched and shaded and drew every part of John into a couple of pages of his notebook.
John nodded, understanding completely. “She sounds like a wonderful woman”. He glanced back at the violin “So you’ve played since you were a child then. I played the clarinet in high school. Couldn’t stick to it for more than 2 years though”
Sherlock sat down without question, seeming unsurprised at where John had taken them and John took a seat beside him, resting his back against the scratchy trunk. The cool shade spilled over them, embracing them in a cocoon of soft cold relief from the burning afternoon sun.
That night at dinner the three of them sat quietly, slowing chewing on the sandwiches Eliza made for them. Her hands were twitching against her glass nervously, her teeth biting her lower lip, her breaths short and panicked.
Thank you for reading, leaving kudos and all that shenanigans <3!! I hope you have a lovely week and hopefully next chapter wont take as long <3<3
Sherlock snorted. “Right. Of course, you lot would think that. What we’re looking at here is clearly a murder.”
You could almost see the disgust vibrating off of Sherlock’s father in waves. The shock and the fury in the strain of his neck and the crumbling self-control in the snarl of his lips. He took John by the shirt in one single sudden snatch. “You LITTLE-“
“Oh! Um... I don’t know? Are you planning on having us walk on it or something?” he was far too focused on the pressure of Sherlock’s gloved fingers around his wrist to really put much thought into anything else, let alone the thickness of the ice.
Sherlock huffed in embarrassment and squirmed under John’s teasing fingertips “Childhood nickname…” he paused “I love bees, okay? Sue me”
“Hmm”
Sherlock walked into class in complete silence. 10 minutes late. His hair was sticking up everywhere, his shirt at least a day old and wrinkled. Not to mention it was stained with paint smudges all around the cufflinks.
“Gladstone.”
His raven hair was a messy array of curls that bounced in every direction as if he had coursed his hands through it ceaselessly throughout the night. This would, of course, explain the slight smears of red and blue inside the folds of some of the untamed curls. His neck and hands had not been spared from the paint either, as streaks of color were stuck in a shocking contrast to the pale and creamy skin. Funnily enough, he was not wearing baggy clothes that could be stained or ruined with the grease from his oil paints or the dark charcoal dust, but instead, he wore a perfectly clean and smooth dress shirt. The clothing was pristine, unlike his skin, and if not for the slight movement of his breathing it would’ve looked like a well dressed, painted mannequin in the middle of a store.
They stumbled along the flat, the model blindly following as Sherlock pulled him up the stairs into the darkened hallway and pulled him in as his back crashed against what he presumed was the bedroom door. They kissed and kissed and Sherlock patted his hand against the wood of the door behind himself, trying to find the metal of the doorknob and failing miserably. “One moment” he grumbled against John’s insistent lips, he turned as fast as he could and turned the doorknob, pushing the door open with as much force as he could manage and dragging an enthusiastic John into the room with him.
When the 30-minute mark alarm sounded to indicate it was finally time for lunch everyone sighed in relief. Sherlock huffed out a laugh, he really wasn’t THAT demanding, was he?
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. Seems like magic does sometimes pick more than one sibling, Mr. Watson.
Forcing himself to think about nothing at all Sherlock finished himself as fast as he could. Denying absolutely that as he came that he pictured John’s pink lips pressed against the back of his neck and moaning out Sherlock’s name.
His father had been the one to give in to the insisting buzzing of the front door bell. John had turned to watch him walk towards it, mumbling under his breath. He peered through the door of the living room and down the hall to the opening door where his father stood and promptly gasped. He blinked several times, making sure that he was seeing correctly.
“JOHN!” Sherlock called out, completely forgetting the fact that his friend was right behind him and ignoring his mother’s comment. He ripped open one of the letters as John stood up on shaky legs, feeling as if every second was going by too slowly… or too fast. He wasn’t sure which.
John smiled again, the fondness returning with full light to his eyes. “You were worried?” he didn’t sound teasing, for once, he sounded genuine, so Sherlock nodded, still unable to meet his eye.
“Not far from now dear!” she winked “Quite soon. Quite soon,” she wandered around the room making more outrageous predictions about students at other tables. Sherlock couldn’t stop blinking, couldn’t process what had just happened.
As soon as they reached an alleyway the blonde turned the corner of the building and pulled Sherlock into a tight hug, much to the artist’s bewilderment. He had been expecting some sort of awkward goodbye. Some dry words and maybe an awkward embrace. But then again maybe this was it. Maybe John knew how hard he was falling for him and just wanted to apologize before tearing his heart out. Well... better he did it now. Better he did it fast. Better now that he hadn’t gone out with that woman. Of course, John wouldn’t cheat in a relationship... but would it even be considered cheating on Sherlock? They were not together. They would never be.
He couldn’t breathe. All this time John had been jealous of Irene when nothing had been going on between them and then he had basically harassed Sherlock into telling him why he had been talking to Irene when she was only trying to help him.
“Of course... This" he searched for words "This is incredible! I can’t imagine how it must feel to come to this classroom every single day”
Hours earlier John had convinced Sherlock to let go of him momentarily just so he could grab a flannel from the bathroom and clean them up both, insisting they would end up sticky and crusty if he didn’t. Sherlock pouted in protest but was convinced after a couple of kisses and a gentle hand coursing through his sweaty curls.
“Was that- okay?”
“Make it
He was met with a look of complete betrayal, laced with subtle but not completely imperceptible amusement as Sherlock took the phone from John’s hand and pressed it against his ear.
John almost lost his balance “He murdered his wife?” he exclaimed
He had never seen John like this, then again no one had ever made such a direct move on to him. John was always around and most people they met instantly assumed (correctly, of course) that they were together. But this reaction was rather… stimulating. He knew now, of course, that they were in an exclusive relationship but hearing him actually say the word boyfriend in reference to himself... it
“Yes?” John said it sounded like a question.
sadness. This anger.
“Oh right. That guy. Isn’t that him over there?” he pointed somewhere into the mob of curious people that were trying to get the gossip on what had happened inside the innocent looking hotel. Sherlock’s eyes instantly followed to where the DI was pointing and finally… there was John. He seemed to still be in the process of spotting Sherlock himself, looking a little lost before he rose his cell phone up and started typing something on in.
John smiled reassuringly, “Don’t worry, I know you don’t mean to”. Weirdly enough, the thought that someone as smart as Sherlock forgot John wasn’t someone who didn’t belong in his world was… nice in a way. It made John feel as if he wasn’t being watched as the outsider, but simply as another young wizard... waiting for that letter.
“12 inches, unicorn tail hair, Ash” he grinned. “I didn’t know what to expect but…” he picked up his wand. “It’s perfect.”
“By the time summer came, it had been almost a whole year since I had heard from you and I was… heart broken, to say the least. That is how three whole years passed. But one day. One night, actually. I heard a commotion downstairs. It sounded like some sort of screech, like a wounded owl. I crept downstairs and saw Gladstone flying out of a window chased by my father. He held a letter in which I recognized your hand writing. I confronted him and he admitted to taking your letters and burning them. He admitted to even intercepting mail that I received in Beauxbatons so you couldn’t reach me there either. I tried to duel him that night but… I lost. I was almost expelled from school for performing magic outside of school and he threatened to hurt my mother if I contacted you. So I didn’t… and that’s how it went until he left us a year later”.
felt the first day he was here.
They ate breakfast side by side, thighs touching and trying very hard not to spill their pumpkin juice every time one of them snuck in a kiss to the others neck or cheek. Sherlock inevitably did end up spilling most of his tea on himself when John pulled him in for a proper snog, their first since yesterday and still a shock to the Beauxbaton’s system.
Sherlock had realized he was in love with John during a care of magical creatures lesson (of all places), a lesson Gryffindor and Ravenclaw shared for their third year.  Everyone’s favorite professor, Hagrid, had been demonstrating the many ways of approaching and treating a hippogriff, as was customary for a first lesson ever since he had done that with that Potter boy everyone talked about but Sherlock always seemed to delete. (“But it’s Harry freaking Potter!” John would always say. “You don’t understand. He’s a legend to us all! Every son and daughter grew up hearing about you-know-who and-” “I do not know who. Speak properly, John. Stop being tiresome” “You...you don’t know wh-” and the conversation would just go in circles after that). Hagrid now, however, opted for smaller less dangerous hippogriffs as for the students to be in less danger
New chapter<3<3<3 I hope to have the next one ready for tuesday
He kept walking around the class, occasionally stopping behind a student and commenting on their work. Usually, he got stiff backs and maybe a frown thrown his way but today he was getting... thank you's? Surprised looks and smiles? What had changed?
“That… has nothing to do with it” Sherlock muttered
thought Sherlock with a smile.
…. Oh… OH!
A distant memory from the time Sherlock’s father had opened the door and startled them apart flashed quickly through John’s eyes. He remembered Sherlock’s face, so close to his, looking nervous and… expectant? Anticipating? John’s brow furrowed, he hadn’t revisited that night in his memories for so long. He still didn’t quite understand the charge in the air. The feeling of some force pulling them together… towards what?
“It’s no trouble” Sherlock finally looked up and met John’s eye.
Sherlock reached into his back pocket and unlocked the phone white a swipe of his thumb.
John opened his mouth to speak but Sherlock beat him to it, raising a hand
The bus took off and Sherlock frowned at the floor. What had just happened? He rose a hand to his throat trying to make it stop feeling so lodged up and to calm his still racing heart. He felt each thump under his fingertips, reverberating against his ribs and screaming out to him.
“More like 300 John, don’t push it” Sherlock sniffed, as he lowered himself to the ground.
The blonde immediately straightened and looked over at Sherlock, a smile already colouring his expression.
Sherlock, in turn, had appraised John’s figure for a second before asking “So... Auror, Quidditch player or Healer?” and had proceeded to make John dizzy with an array of perfectly calculated observations and deductions.
“John,” He started, “When you spoke with Sarah... what exactly did you say?”
. “Nothing!” Sherlock scoffed, trying and failing to look oblivious.
Sherlock smiled, a warmth blooming in the centre of his chest at the ‘we’ of the statement. “Yes. We will”.
“Well, I guess we’re going our separate ways now, huh?” John sighed. “I’ll see you…. tomorrow I guess”. This was it. Again. Going to divination. Playing Quidditch. That’s all the interaction he’d get out of Sherlock.
In the years John had known Sherlock he had never seen him so unsure.. looking so small and afraid. The urge to comfort... what’s more.. to PROTECT rushed fiercely to John’s heart.
“You alright? You seem… flushed,” he cocked his head and popped a seemingly concerned brow. He suspected Sherlock could see right through it.
“Let’s skip it. I think we could both use without the fatal predictions for now.”
“You really shouldn’t leave so early,” Mycroft interrupted turning to Sherlock. “What will the reporter’s say?”
“I’m fine,” he said. “Let’s… can- can we go?”
Mary didn’t look convinced but she let it go. “Anyway...” she said, conspiratorially. “You know that kid that just walked in? That’s Sherlock Holmes. Biggest freak in Beauxbatons if you ask me”
Most of his student body, haven been resting their weight onto the solid door, stumbled forwards.  They looked up in alarm at their professor, all of them red in the face and mouths gaping.
The students looked at the woman that had just walked in inquiringly, somehow haven expected John to walk into the room again, beaming at their professor. The model today was one they knew, but that didn’t make her presence any less striking.
“I’m sure-“ he slid his hands down Sherlock’s long back under the covers, teasingly, “I can find something” he nibbled at the artist’s earlobe and kept his hands moving down covering the gorgeous round globes of his arse and squeezing him, “-for us to do”.
John was overcome by a flurry of several emotions. Joy, at having Sherlock agree to take him to the restricted section and thus providing an opportunity for them to spend more time together. Bemusement, at Sherlock’s formality and even slight detachment. And finally irrational jealousy, over his acknowledgement that he missed Gladstone. As if he hadn’t seen him several times over the years and ignored him, left him to go back to John empty of responses. How was it so easy to admit to missing an OWL but not his
John climbed onto the platform, already knowing where to place the lights and turning them on before Sherlock turned off the main ones in the room. He fiddled with the belt of his robe, making sure to catch Sherlock’s eye before he slipped it off his body. Sherlock gulped audibly, trying his best not to stare at the model's body too blatantly. Obviously, he HAD to watch him as to be able to choose the best pose for the first hour but... he would have to make sure he remained calm and collected.
“Precisely John. Of course, to deem which of these is better I would have to gather all the students with unicorn hair cores and have them duel but I rather think that would regretfully be deemed as unethical. Not to mention annoyingly imprecise. All the students are absolutely atrocious at dueling.”
John’s breath rushed out as he took in the beautiful image of his best friend. Of his beaming proud smile and the sparkling happiness in his eyes.
John narrowed his eyes, “I saw that”.
) as he walked him as fast as he could to the hospital wing. The weight of Sherlock’s body on his shoulder was oddly comforting and it suddenly brought back fond (but momentarily unwanted) memories of the day they first met properly and consequently the day they became friends.
Weeks passed by them. They tried everything, from blindfolding him and jumping onto the deepest edge of the murky waters of the lake to running out in one of the coldest nights in only shorts to see if the shock of the temperature change made something in Sherlock react. But aside from a nasty cold and several disapproving looks from Mycroft, they got almost nowhere.
Sherlock shook his head slightly, the words caught in his throat.
John snickered “shhh love, it’s okay” he raised Sherlock’s right hand to his lips and kissed it lightly “I’ll take care of it”. Then he calmly unbuttoned the rest of his shirt, Sherlock watched the process with wide eyes, taking in every sliver of tanned skin John revealed. The fact that John used the word ‘love’ thrummed in his mind in never ending echoes, he felt his blush darkening. Surely John had said it as a reflex, but that didn’t diminish the warmth or the fluttering in Sherlock’s stomach.
Five paintings of John hung from the walls. At the bus stop and smiling down. A couple modelling in class, his very favorite was the one where he was looking straight out. Sitting on the chair after the violin serenade. Moments before they kissed.
“You have nothing to be sorry for… nothing. You don’t deserve this. Neither of you do”.
“This was great! I can’t believe you go on cases like this all the time!” John said as soon as they stepped outside onto the street. He raised his hand to a cab some way down the road.
The next day, Friday, John walked into Divination quietly beside Greg and Molly. Greg had tried to rope him into the conversation a couple of times but after failing to make John so much as answer more than monosyllabic answer Molly had nudged him in the ribs and given him a pointed look.
“I love you”.
“Brilliant,” John murmured.
Molly Hooper was sitting next to Mike Stamford Tuesday morning, just finishing setting everything up for the lesson. They were watching their teacher closely as he fiddled with his thumbs. He certainly looked better than last Tuesday, when he’d showed up looking like he hadn’t slept in weeks and his shirt was covered in paint. On Thursday’s lesson, he’d looked significantly better. Irene had walked into the room and they had had a long whispered conversation in which Irene had looked smug and Sherlock had gone from annoyed to dare she say… a bit giddy?
“I- ah… yes. Talking. In… in a minute” Sherlock sighed back, pushing his chest onto John’s and tipping his head further to dip his tongue into John’s sweet
“Not walk, John! Don’t be ridiculous”. They finally reached the edge of the ice, where Sherlock regretfully let go of John’s wrist and inspected the lake’s surface for a second before seemingly deeming it worthy. “We’re going to ice skate, obviously” he turned to look at John, a huge grin lighting up his face.
“Class!” Mr Longbottom had called for attention and John had been forced to tear his eyes away from Sherlock, not missing a small surprised smile he had given John when the latter had pronounced his deductions as amazing and brilliant.
They were all perfectly aligned, straight-backed and without a hair out of place. They light blue robes fluttered around their ankles but their feet were almost soundless in the light graceful walks. They all stared forward as if unaware of the students watching them go by as they gathered at the front of the hall, awaiting instructions. John watched them walk past, wide-eyed. If he had been drinking any water he was sure he would have spit all of it out.
“France, I think. Why?” she answered quietly, still hanging onto McGonagall’s every word as she explained where the Beauxbatons students would be staying. (They would be divided equally between houses at random, rather than being sorted by the hat).
“BECAUSE JOHN DOESN’T LOVE ME!” Sherlock exclaimed throwing his arms in the air. He looked around but no one had done anything more than spare him a sideways glance. Sherlock sighed. “He doesn’t love me. And he’s my best friend. If I told him how I feel- How I’ve always felt and he didn’t feel the same…he’d leave me. I’d be all alone again”.
“So..” he started “Where to?”
his. There was no mistake. Whatever was inside this letter was addressed to him. And
“Don’t want to be late to your very first solo gallery, do we?” he called back. Sherlock grinned.
If John expected him to book him because he knew Sherlock wanted to and he explicitly said so that would mean… he wasn’t bothered by it. On the other hand how could he not be bothered? So clearly he didn’t know about Sherlock’s little crush. Maybe he just
Sherlock was already walking out of the room, opening the door for John and closing it once they were past it. “I nicked it from the headmaster. I know where she keeps them. She gave me a second-floor classroom this semester. Everyone knows the best view is on the fifth” he shrugged.
At first, Sherlock had seemed bored, his usual manner when anyone other than John talked to him for too long and did not have an interesting case for him to investigate. This was something that although sometimes worried John, who did not want Sherlock to be alone in the classes they did not have together, it somewhat flattered him too.
“Oh… er.. sorry. I uh... can’t today. Maybe another time” he answered. He didn’t even wait to see if she'd been disappointed, immediately turning back to the spot where Sherlock had been standing perfectly still.
The silence stretched over them as the skated together, bodies drifting closer in search for each other’s bodily warmth. Sherlock finally risked up a look at John and his heart instantly tried to pump its way out of his chest. John looked so ridiculously beautiful… so handsome. His cheeks were winter-rosy, the hair peeking out of his red Gryffindor beanie freckled with snowflakes, his gorgeous jaw just visible over his scarf and his eyes… his eyes were so blue in contrast to the winter wonderland around them, so wide and sparkling and hopeful. The silence grew charged as they kept staring into each other's eyes, neither looking away like they had every instance during the past few weeks.
John turned his head towards the Slytherin booth where he had seen his friend sit beside the commentator booth.
His ‘part time job’ as a crime solver for the incompetents at Scotland Yard such as his usual correspondent ‘G. Lestrade’ helped make the void not seem so empty, and along with drawing he felt almost complete… but not quite. Something was missing. And if Sherlock knew where to find it he would go in a heartbeat.
“In a weird way yeah I
“It’s nothing. I’m fine.” He backtracked, shaking his head.
YAAAAAAAAAY <3<3!!!!
“I really don’t care much for these events” Sherlock said suddenly
But how to even bring it up? They didn’t really hang out much outside of divination or their occasional Quidditch practices. Mostly because John couldn’t seem to find Sherlock anywhere. Not even the library. He even didn’t even know if Sherlock wanted to be found at all. If he even
“It was satisfactory.”
“Oh god.. yes. Yes, please J-John I.. I” he couldn’t finish his thought before john was licking a broad stripe against his puckering entrance enthusiastically. They both groaned in unison, the reverberations from John’s throat to his mouth and into Sherlock’s body prompting the latter to gasp even more harshly.
John had been so amazing today. He’d listened when Sherlock talked about his parents and his brother and hadn’t pushed him for information or treated him with pity. They’d eventually moved on to other topics and the mood had lightened significantly under the bright sun and chilly late autumn air. John had enchanted a light snowfall around Sherlock as the latter discussed his theory on the properties of double core wands and Sherlock had spluttered as a small snowflake drifted in front of him and into his mouth. John had laughed as Sherlock shook his head and sent freezing flakes in all directions whilst cursing John vivaciously.
At first, John had very chastely kissed Sherlock’s lips, not wanting to freak him out again and now knowing Sherlock would most likely not respond for the first couple of moments. Sherlock, however, at the first touch of lips instantly hummed in pleasure and wrapped his arms around John’s neck, pushing his chest onto the blonde, urging him to hold him tighter. As soon as he felt John’s one of strong arms wrap around his waist he had opened his mouth, instinctively wanting to taste every inch of him.
He kept repeating to himself. His plan to avoid being seen by John in the few months he’d be here was ruined. In just 3 days. Fabulous. He was fairly certain he’d already broken one of his best quills as he mashed everything into his bag in his haste to as far away from there as possible. He swung his bag across his shoulders and at last… he looked up.
A flash of gold.
John teased his tongue around lightly, circling only and completely maddening the artist, “please” he breathed
“Hey, you” John whispered, leaning over his desk.
“Oh uh yeah sorry.” John visibly shook himself out of the small trance that had taken over him momentarily “That sounds really interesting! You have to let me know how it goes next class yeah?” John smiled, it didn’t quite reach his eyes, though.
Sherlock stood from the benches and made his way out of the Slytherin booth, taking the opportunity to silently cast a confundus charm on Anderson so he would accidentally punch Sally in the face. “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!” He heard her screech as he practically skipped merrily away from the crowd.
Greg nodded “It is! You’ve finally noticed that you have feelings for him! Took you long enough!”
Sherlock snickered, raising his arms to protect himself as John flung a pillow at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt Sherlock clutch at the front of his modesty robe, pulling him in desperately and gasping into the kiss. They kept the kiss heated but chaste, needing to just feel each other, be with each other in that moment.
The quiet in the house was deafening. Sherlock tried his best to pretend not to notice it. But John could hear it in his voice, see it in his eyes. He had seen something. Deduced something. Something he’d rather not know. And in a way, John saw it too. The red rims under Eliza’s eyes speaking volumes and volumes for themselves.
(See the end of the chapter for
John couldn’t really say what had him feeling so down. Sure, it was everything he’d felt last night with Sherlock’s returned note. But he thought it’d just been the darkness of midnight enhancing his emotions, the dismissive quality of Sherlock’s response. But now he was also feeling a sense of loss as he finally accepted that perhaps his friendship with Sherlock really HAD ended 5 years ago.
. He had kissed John Watson. John… whose cheeks were tinted pink, and his lips were kissed-red, swollen and wet. Wet from kissing
John silenced him with a kiss, dropping the condom back into the drawer with a desperate hum. He kissed down Sherlock’s long neck and chest, teasingly dipping his tongue momentarily into the hollow of his throat and later on as he progressed down, his bellybutton, as he knew Sherlock particularly loved, and also to hear the high wanting whine peel out of his throat.
“If you boys are done being children” she started, fighting off an indulgent smile as she wiped off the yoghurt smear off her cheek with her index finger, “you’ll admit that the only one here doing you any guys favours is me.” She winked and stretched out her hand for Sherlock to shake. “I’m Molly. Molly Hooper. The only mature one in this group, clearly.”
And the one he was currently in.
John snorted “Why?”
They ran into the woman with the bat again, and she let John pet it. He was so astounded by this new world he had suddenly been invited to see. A part of him still felt like he’s outside looking in, but the fact that Sherlock, this strange new boy he barely knew had stepped out to help him...it meant a lot.
Sherlock swallowed, mouth corners tipping into a smirk. “It is indeed, John. Maybe you should take your coat off? Wouldn’t want you getting heat stroke or anything”.
Molly shrugged, “Maybe he’s just nervous. Not seeing you after all those years. Must be pretty weird to have you here with him. He probably doesn’t know where he stands with you is all.”
That startled John into a laugh. The tension broke completely as John’s entire body shook with laughter. Sherlock giggled back, not sure if he’s glad for the rupture of the fragile tension they'd been enveloped in or not.
“You seem to be able to observe a man’s body well” the critic noted, the wolfish grin back in place and fully revealing his eerily white teeth.
This artist was Sherlock Holmes. And currently, he was trying desperately to figure out how to perfect his latest painting.
Clearing his throat to dismiss the thought, Sherlock stood from his seat and started circling the room.
“Hey!” John cried
John’s heart stopped. Sherlock had told him a couple of weeks ago how just short of a year ago his father had run off with a younger woman he met at one of his business trips. It wasn’t his first affair with another woman, as Sherlock and Mycroft had known, but it was the first his mother had found out about. And she had been absolutely crushed.
John had heard enough, he felt like his whole mind blanked instantly. Heart pounding and head spinning he slowly stood up to walk over to Sherlock but when he turned around he and Irene were gone and he was standing alone in the corridor.
John had grown hungry after a while. He gently moved Sherlock from where he had fallen asleep, mostly on top of his chest with John’s hand against his forehead reassuringly. He got up as quietly and as gently as he could and walked into the house towards the kitchen.
“Welcome! Another year at Hogwarts has finally begun. For some the first… for some the last. I know we are all anxious to begin our annual Welcoming Banquet”. A couple of whoops resounded in the audience, Greg included. McGonagall raised her hand again. “Firstly, however, I have an important announcement to make about some things that will be happening this year”.
John snorted and poked him teasingly in the ribs. Sherlock immediately bent over in what John first mistook as pain but then when he took a closer look at Sherlock’s embarrassed face saw it for what it was. “Oh my god… Are you- Sherlock. Are you ticklish?”
“We’ll see when it’s a real game, Watson. You may be a good chaser, but I’m the best seeker.”
“By SAVING your idiot arse!” John laughed, and then immediately winced in pain.
There were more pages beneath, detailing the uniform and a long list of materials and books but John just stared at that front page. At his name. The acceptance. The signature. That name… Minerva McGonagall... wasn’t that the woman that had come to speak to his sister all those years ago? It had to be.. that last sentence. She remembered him! He grinned. His cheeks hurt with how wide he grinned. He just couldn’t stop. And when he raised his eyes and met Sherlock, he found an equally astounded… amazed… and completely bewitched expression on his face.
“FREAK!”
“Now turn your upper body towards the left and look at the far wall… yes, good. Raise your arm behind your neck. Higher. Elbow up. The other hand on your knee, elbow bent”
One of the boys, clearly the leader, shoved Sherlock against the wall as the other two laughed merrily. “Don’t you dare say anything like that again you freak! You don’t even know what you’re talking about!”
“Huh?” Sherlock looked up blearily, disoriented. He’d been sitting next to John’s bed since he’d been brought, still unconscious, about 7 hours ago. He’d been almost falling asleep until John had spoken.
So yes… Everything was going swimmingly so far for John. Sure, divination was not his favourite subject so far... and  Professor Trelawney was a little bit strange. But it was already halfway through the lesson and all he could think of was Mary’s blue gaze fixed right on him like tracking a target, their greenish hue in the very centre somehow reminiscent of another pair of eyes he’d sworn he’d seen before. A dangerous spark shone in the centre… perhaps if they were clearer… greyer. Like Ice. Or blue flames flickering slowly…
The moment drew on slowly as John’s small smile grew into a proper one. “Sherlock I-”
Molly set her things down and went to the other side of the classroom to pick a wooden board to set on her easel so she could pin the sheets of paper up with some board clips, the rest of the students quickly followed her lead as they slowly rose out of their sleepy states under the bright lights of the classroom. Sherlock ticked off the names as he caught sight of each student; Phil Anderson, Sally Donovan, Mary Morstan, Paul Dunstan, Kate Halstead, Janine Hawkins and Mike Stamford. “Perfect attendance,” Sherlock thought, raising a brow, “they must have heard about the new model”. Clearly, he wasn’t the only one feeling the tediousness of having the same 15 ones over and over again. It was a small class compared to most of the ones in the school as a whole but then again students tended to drop Sherlock’s classes after the first few test weeks when they noticed most of his teaching method involved completely tearing apart the method with which they drew, observed, moved their hand, held the graphite pencil or charcoal, shifted weight, and basically any other thing he could possibly criticise about their drawing methods. This semester 8 students had stuck with him, a larger number than ever and he was cautiously optimistic about... most of them.
He wove past players, zig-zagging his way onto the other side of the pitch. He focused on his surroundings, quickly calculating the speed of the snitch and how much it could’ve moved in the past 30 seconds it took him to get there. He turned around pulling up his broom to get onto a higher level.
thought Sherlock,
“THREE. HOUSES. WATSON.” Greg said loudly, “is at a loss when faced with a potential conquest?!” he pressed his palm to his heart, not unlike a fairy tale damsel in distress.
John smiled softly, his eyes sparkling with fondness. “Yeah… I am.” He stood slowly from the bench and walked over to Sherlock and stopped directly in front of him, a little closer than he usually did and stared calmly into the Ravenclaw's eyes, a pink blush unwavering from his soft cheeks.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It’s... it’s all fine”. He refused to acknowledge how choked out his voice sounded when he spoke and started to walk away again. Even just the sight of Sherlock was making his guy churn with so many emotions he didn’t even know where or how to start sorting them out.
“Soon enough you’ll be begging ME to give you mercy!” Sherlock laughed as they walked back to the castle under the red-orange light of the sky.
They were pretty much just holding their brooms over their heads and trying to swat their snitch like a fly onto the ground, jumping around. They were laughing maniacally, taking turns between taking swings at the flying golden ball and each other’s brooms as if they were swords. Sherlock swung too hard and knocked John’s broom right out of his grasp just as the Snitch was hit and swivelled down a few inches with a triumphant “Aha!”.
John nodded, the stone in his gut feeling heavier but the fierce need to protect Sherlock burning in his heart “I promise” he said. He meant it, bone deep. But the thought.. even the notion of going to Hogwarts and leaving Sherlock behind threatened to shatter John’s heart into a million pieces.
Sherlock couldn’t quite make out what they were saying, but from the manner in which his students were positioned towards each other he assumed they were talking about him. Not that he blamed them, really. In his life not once had he ever come to class anything less than perfectly dressed and a minimum of a half hour early. Neither had he ever in his life accidentally painted one of his dress shirts with oil paints, if he wasn’t careful the paint would spread to the rest of his shirt too, one of the disadvantages to oil paints. But his state of dress couldn’t be helped. Ever since the other night, almost 5 days ago, Sherlock had barely been able to stop painting.
“SO! You up for another round or have you had enough losing?” John said, flying up to meet him with a wink.
There was pink and golden paint in Sherlock’s cheeks where he’d rubbed his own face thoughtfully.
John joined him, tangling his fingers in the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him in to taste those lips again. They kissed blissfully, with no intention of carrying it any further, just basking in feeling each other's bodies pressed against their own and for once, in years and years of aching, no longer feeling alone.
“Better” she grinned and turned over the small piece of card paper. It was a picture of a cat. A chubby fluffy orange cat sitting on top of a puffy blue cushion. “It’s pictures of Toby! I miss him so much! I wanted to bring him here but he doesn’t like it when there are many people around. And he’s very used to living in our house so... he just stayed there but-” she sighed. “He’s everything”.
something he knew he could do for now.
The next couple of days could only be described as awkward. Although Sherlock didn’t exactly avoid John when he saw him approaching he wasn’t his usual talkative self and would remain relatively silent. He kept on his meetings with Irene, much to John’s despair. But he was careful not to do so whenever the Gryffindor was around, but John knew.
