“Ah, yes. Tomorrow then,” he agreed now quietly. He found himself hanging up the phone automatically, his stomach twisting around in knots. Was he really going to do this? Get a tattoo? He looked at the beautifully sketched tree once more, found his fingers stealing out to brush the paper.
He knew exactly what he wanted, but getting a tattoo went against everything he’d ever been taught. It would be an even larger betrayal of his father and his upbringing than anything else he’d done since leaving the fold.
He took a slow breath. “Like this, sir?” he asked finally.
Castiel squinted at him, his blue eyes uncertain. “You realize that Christmas is just a pagan holiday that…”
“Merry Christmas Cas,” Dean’s voice broke into his thoughts and Castiel blinked a few times before turning his head, studying that beautiful face, this good man, this righteous man who had changed him in so many ways. Dean was sprawled out next to him, the color on his cheeks drink induced, the lazy half closed way his eyes rested. There was, something else though, something about how Dean was looking at him.
Dean shifted and then he just stacked the plates together, green eyes glittered thoughtfully now. “Not here. Refresh your coffee while I clean up and then lets do this on the couch. I want to tell you a few things, too, and the kitchen counter is not the place.”
“Just tell me when you see something you want to watch,” the artist told him softly as he tapped through options. Castiel stared at the screen, watching titles flick by in front of him.
“Of course, no pressure.” And so, Castiel gave him space. He continued his small magics, mostly related to the plants he tended and those few customers who came in with need of a spell or two.
Cas took a breath and then he accepted the mirror, in a few moments he was standing there carefully examining his back with it, a smile spreading slowly across his lips. He didn’t catch the pleasured look that crossed the artist’s face as he admired the outlining that was already done. Dean had made good progress on the branches of the tree and making it still look natural on his skin. It was thrilling.
Then a shocking sense of surprise slammed into him. He lifted his head and found Dean was standing over his box, his tail fluffed up and eyes focused on something….something dark, and small. “Dean…”
He was quiet as he slid out of bed, stretching slowly and carefully and then he moving to find a pair of boxers, shamelessly getting into Dean’s dresser to find clean ones before he moved to follow his nose. His movements might have been a bit slow, but he was determined to find the source of the wonderful scent. He padded into the kitchen and grinned softly as he heard Dean humming a rock song under his breath while wearing little more than Cas.
“Do we need to? We already know each other’s bests and worsts,” Dean pointed out softly. “We’re practically already married already, just a new direction for us, right?”
“That would be more than acceptable,” Castiel agreed. Tomorrow was his day off and he hoped that at the very least he could convince himself that it wasn’t a complete mistake to do this. The designs sat on his counter, he’d sketched them out himself, hoping that the artist he chose would agree.
“Aww, Dean, I’m just having fun. He blushes so nicely,” she countered readily.
“I did,” he grunted, and then pulled back, his blue eyes darker than usual, beckoning him. “They do, but I want you first.”
“I prefer to go with a companion already in mind,” Castiel admitted, it was usually safer for him too.
The length was good, and he appeared to be a nice girth, and Dean clearly already was turned on by all this because it was half hard. He wanted to suck that cock badly now. A low chuckle hit his ears.
He wasn’t surprised though that Dean tightened his fingers in his hair and pulled his head back. He let a faint whine out just the same as that beautiful cock slipped from his mouth. He looked back up at Dean hungrily. He wanted more, so he kept his lips parted invitingly, feeling the soft thrum that indicated they’d already gotten a bit swollen from what they’d been doing.
//Yeah. Hey, thanks, for all the care you’ve been giving me. You sure didn’t have to.// Dean shifted and curled up, his fluffy tail tucked against himself.
“Wow,” he whispered quietly now. To see it like this was beyond anything he’d imagined.
“Go to sleep Dean, In the morning we’ll have to see about digging ourselves out.” Cas murmured and he let himself lean in and kiss the man softly. Dean kissed back and just curled into him.
“Are you all right?” Castiel asked as he reached down to scoop Dean up. Dean, well... he looked smug. That was interesting.
“Mmm Cas that’s, it’s just one...night.” Dean’s breath jerked in and let out again sharply: a hand was moving to cup him. “W...We have..hours...yet.”
However, all thoughts of the man he’d chosen as a vessel were pushed from his mind as there was heat and wet and suction around the stiff appendage between his legs. Blue eyes shot downwards and widened to see how Dean’s lips stretched out around him.
Cas tried to suck it into his mouth, to have something back between his lips. Dean chuckled softly at that now and he shook his head quietly before he let go completely and stepped back.
“Shit! You okay Cas?”
“Oh? What sorta work do you do?” Dean asked curiously, motioning over towards the buffet of food. Maybe he should eat something, counter the alcohol already in his system, he didn’t want to make a fool out of himself in front of this rather attractive man.
“A moose?” Blue eyes went wide. Castiel had never seen a familiar that size, though he was sure they must exist.
“Your being broody,” Dean announced as the tv remote landed on the stand next to the bed, some sort of animated thing was playing now, Castiel couldn't focus on it, instead his eyes flicked to Dean, to the soft flush on his cheeks and then little soft sparkle of the green, that told him Dean was thinking about something.
Castiel wanted desperately to ask Dean to come in.
//Do you have any pie?// Dean’s voice came to him. It seemed now that he’d spoken for the first time, he wouldn't stop. Castiel wasn't going to tell him not to.
Castiel reached out and grabbed his bicep firmly. It was hardly more effort to fly two of them than it was to move himself, and they didn’t go far after all, just the very unused honeymoon suite. It had the most room in this dingy motel, and his wings would need the space.
“I’d love to,” Castiel agreed and slowly eased himself up now, quietly shifting to sit properly. It was interesting, not exactly painful, but strange knowing there was work there. He knew that the tattoo itself would probably be a bit sore later, he’d done some research on healing tattoos, after all. Dean helped him get steady on his feet with careful gloved hands and then offered him a hand mirror.
“I hope things progress well, then.” Cas smiled quietly. “I didn’t notice in your photographs, but ah, you’re single?” Okay, daring, maybe he shouldn’t ask, but his curiosity was eating at him.
He loved them. Jack had restored them to their older beauty, full and healthy and very very lovely to touch. There was a soft ruffling noise and the beautiful, dark. shimmery green, blue and purple feathers were before him and in easy reach.
Curiously? Maybe testing the waters? Castiel didn’t want to be the one in charge if he was honest. Something about those beautiful green eyes and the way the man spoke made him want to just melt into a puddle and let him walk all over him, possibly in heels if that was Dean’s thing.
“Yes, that would be the first step,” Castiel murmured. He looked around then pointed. “Bring a chair over? It would be best for me to sit where I can spread them out for you.”
“Not at all,” he confirmed.
Dean finished undressing with careless grace; he was just as fit under all those clothes as Castiel could have thought. His eyes dragged over the lines of his skin, the easy definition of his muscles.Then slowly he let himself look at his soon to be lover’s cock. It, too, was beautiful, and it made his mouth water a little as he studied it.
“Cas?” Even to his own ears his voice sounded, different – hopeful? Soft even.
Cas moved almost at once, settling onto the bed and moving to get himself lain out as he’d been told to do. The towel only needed minimal movement, but he was glad for that because it gave him an excuse to watch how Dean moved around. He focused on the way Dean grabbed a bottle and started to roll it in his hands, likely warming the contents somewhat, thinking that it was thoughtful.
Saturday rolled into place in what felt like a blink of an eye. Castiel and Dean had texted a bit and now Cas nervously smoothed a button down shirt into place. He’d rolled the sleeves up, and at Gabriel’s suggestion via an amused skype call, added a waistcoat, but unbuttoned a few buttons of the shirt, showing a glimpse of his chest. Just enough to tease, his brother assured him, not at all slutty.
“Dean I don’t like, lying. Even if it’s just by omission.” Cas lifted his head and looked at him his blue eyes strangely intense. “There is something I should stop hiding.”
He sighed contently now and then stretched slowly and moved to sit, a little carefully. It really had been a while since he’d bottomed and last night had been exceptional.
He took a slow breath. The air was cool but not cold, and the sun was bright. He tipped his head back a moment. He hoped he wasn’t getting himself in head over heels.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replied automatically, eyes wide. He was in shock. He didn’t know what to think about any of this.
“Shhh, just let me enjoy this.” Cas rumbled, as his fingers gripped onto Dean’s hips, strong and firm as his mouth returned, hot, wet, taking him deeply. Dean shifted one hand from feathers and into Cas’ hair, fisting up in the dark half curls as he bucked forward into that eager mouth.
Lucifer had separated himself completely from religion, and Gabriel, well, did whatever he felt like. Which meant that sometimes he went with Castiel to the important holiday masses, but mostly he just enjoyed himself and kept his faith quiet. He was thankful he had two of his brothers who not only didn’t judge him, but also understood him.
“I meant it,” Dean said quietly now, shifting to look at Cas in the dim light being given off by a pair of candles that had been placed on the dresser in front of them. He studied the soft lines of Castiel’s face in the candle light. “I do want to marry you, Cas, I just…”
“Planning to poach him away from Stevens?” he asked absently as he attempted to control his bedhead. He frowned at himself in the mirror; it seemed that his hair looked even more messy than before he started.
“Talking is fine with me as long as it doesn’t interfere with your work,” Castiel admitted quietly. He could almost hear the smile on Dean’s face when the artist responded.
“Awesome. So you said Thursdays work for you?” Dean hummed quietly as he considered his schedule. “In that case, I’d like to make a first appointment properly for you, and before then I’ll email you some different examples of what I’m thinking of doing with it? You approve whatever version you like best, and we can do this.”
“We’re growing steady and sure,” Dean’s voice held a hint of quiet pride that Castiel knew was completely and absolutely real.
“I do,” it was a soft and easy reply. Cas sighed happily now and then he let himself just look at Dean, thankful for this. “So, what’s next?”
“Hey, Dean,” he said, even as the scent of cooking food hit his nose and made his eyes widen. “Oh my god, it smells amazing in here.”
“Art,” Dean answered honestly. “And the drive to prove to my dad that I could do something with my skills.” His voice was low and soothing and Castiel smiled quietly. He knew that feeling so well. “What about you? Why religion?”
“That sounds delightful,” There was a wink and then Dean felt a hand curl around his own before he was guided towards the door, it was easy to follow. He genuinely hoped that things worked out with Castiel, there was just something about him. Dean would have to examine it more sober, but for the moment  he was going to just relax and enjoy.
“Yes, mostly found family,” Dean agreed. “But that tall, handsome idiot with princess hair is my kid brother, Sam, and the beautiful woman next to him is his girlfriend, Jess. He’s a newly minted lawyer, working for some hotshot law firm.”
“Not as good as on a grill, but it does the job,” Dean added.
“Merry Christmas Dean” He said quietly, knowing that’s how he should respond. Dean’s green eyes slid past him, up to the ceiling and a giggle escaped the man. Castiel blinked a moment then tipped his head to look up. The mistletoe from the car was now above them, pinned there. How had that...
“Yes, sir,” Cas said breathlessly, he tipped his head back into the touch on his neck and Dean smiled easily at that.
“Ideally, yes.” Castiel cocked his head and frowned. “You wish to leave?”
“Yanno, I’m glad Sammy talked me into coming to this shindig.” Dean mused as he watched the back of the other man’s hair, breathing in slowly as the cooler outside air met their faces as they stepped out. Castiel turned around to look at him, cocking his head and then a soft chuckle left his throat, a low and delighted noise. That mouth was just addictive, Dean decided as he quickly leaned in to kiss Cas again. He didn’t ever want to stop.
When the squirrel appeared in his shop, Castiel had been surprised. Familiars weren’t usually this size. Generally they were useful to their witches, though he did question how useful cats were to most. It was less and less common these days for a familiar to be a creature other than a cat, dog or bird.
“I don't plan to get too creative tonight. I’d just like to start to get to know your body,” he said quietly, his voice dipping low and husky. “Is that alright with you, Castiel?”
“....You would think, after all this time, they wouldn’t carry weight, they wouldn’t hurt. That I could ignore it.” Cas said quietly, lowly. Dean frowned a little bit at his words.
“Hey, don’t.” Dean’s voice was firm and soothing and Cas found himself instantly relaxing. “Now I’m going to walk you to the door, and I’m going to kiss you good night, all right?”
“I might, but I think you’re a bit full right now.” Castiel laughed quietly and green eyes seemed to actually glare at him. If anything, knowing that Dean could talk soothed him. Castiel just finished his own burger. “Later,” he promised, and then cocked his head to study Dean.
“Dean…”
“That’s fine, Dean, I can wait.” She grinned and moved to sit, crossing her legs and sitting with perfect posture that, well, put everything on display. “He just help you out, handsome?”
When the night of the party rolled up, air crisp and cold, the snow had been falling off and on all day was still coming down as Dean pulled up outside of the lodge, the flakes already fat and growing more so as the temperature dropped. He sighed and handed the keys of his sweet Impala off to a fresh-faced kid who hardly looked old enough to drive, much less work as a valet, and then smiled as he looked at Castiel standing there with his head tipped back, eyes closed. There snow was in his hair, and on his lashes. His cheeks were already pink from the cold even in just the few moments they’d stood out here. “Come on, nerd,” Dean said easily as he moved to grab the door.
“I just don’t feel like drinking alone,”  Dean muttered and handed it over. Cas took the plastic cup and he grunted quietly to sound like an agreement before he took a sip quietly to please his friend. He was very slow in drinking it, in the time it took him to empty the cup, Dean had taken several healthy gulps and refilled his own.
He needed more, he did, but he dared not ask. It wasn’t right of him to ask.
His hands moved now, and slowly the oil was spread. Cas couldn’t help the way he trembled, though, as Dean worked. He was trying to focus his breathing, trying not to think about how good this felt. The man was far too good to him; he hadn’t earned this sort of affection and he knew it.
Cas sighed and then he shifted a little, considering his next words. “Before I knew it, we were meeting up and she was giving me, well, a rather crash course in the lifestyle. I had no idea that what she was doing wasn’t that safe, and that maybe it was abusive for some time.”
“You know that me meeting your brother means you have to meet Lucifer and Gabriel, right?” he asked thoughtfully as he settled his forehead against Dean’s, just enjoying the bright green eyes and the playful air that wrapped around them.
Castiel took himself home; he had papers waiting for him at home, and to his amusement, a house guest, too. It was strange to not be greeted at his door by the white cat that he’d adopted a year ago. Abaddon was a terror that deserved his name. It was amusing how easily the whirlwind of a cat settled in with him, though.
“I suppose on occasion we do,” Castiel mused quietly and then he rolled his neck, humming a little, his blue eyes looking thoughtful. “You don’t have to take me, do you?”
His thoughts were cut off as Dean did something with his tongue, something that literally caused Castiel’s spine to go jelly with pleasure, and another cry was torn from him. This time, though, his eyes closed tightly and his head pressed back into the pillow, hips lifting quickly towards that eager mouth. It was more than enough to distract him from a third finger.
Gabriel had left second, fleeing to university and then into law school. The shortest of the five brothers was a skillful negotiator and turned a more than willing blind eye to what Lucifer did in the shadows. Finally, encouraged by his older brother’s success, and his own growing unhappiness, Castiel had left, leaving only the oldest, Michael at home, and the youngest Samandriel, who was still in high school, or would be if they hadn’t all been home schooled.
“I think we can make this work, though, don’t you?” Dean asked softly when the kiss stopped. Cas chuckled a little and he nodded, letting their eyes meet. He didn’t know how he’d really managed this, he was so lucky.
“I said, don’t,” Dean yanked a little, looking up, twisting around, reaching for that familiar blue tie and yanking Cas down for an awkward, if slightly tooth clanging kiss. Okay, so Dean’s had better kisses, but honestly….
“In heaven they were grey,” Cas offered quietly and then he rested his head on his arms and felt Dean start his task, it was so soothing. “Then I went to hell to rescue you, and slowly, they started to change.”
“Good night Dean, I love you too.” Cas just held him as he felt Dean falling asleep quickly. He listened to the snow fall, the quiet comfort of all of this. And if they were too snowed in come morning to go anywhere? Well, sure Cas could fly, but, maybe the case could wait a few more days, it wasn’t like the monster that they were hunting was able to go anywhere either.
A little snort left the Angel without him dwelling on the human action. “It is not something I expect you to understand,” he replied quietly under his breath, but knowing that Jimmy would hear him. “May I speak with you face to face?”
Castiel frowned quietly but he found himself moving around, following Deans directions to get the holiday decorations up. He frowned at an item he found sitting on the table. “....Dean why did you grab the mistletoe from the trunk?”
Dean stopped walking at that and gave a little tug on Cas’s own arm. He looked up at Dean, the man’s green eyes studying his own face intently for a moment and then his hand half lifted. “I wanna kiss you now,” Dean informed firmly and Castiel couldn’t help the little laugh that left him he shifted closer into Dean’s arms.
“Mm yeah, gotta….get some sauce.” He was not going to get distracted by Cas’ mouth, no he wasn’t, oh fuck he was– those lips latching onto Dean’s ear were more than enough to make him sigh.
“Gabriel Novak?’ Dean asked, pausing in his work now to shift his position slightly “Sammy like, never shuts up about how brilliant he is. He totally admires that man.”
He would not last. He’d been too hard, and Dean seemed to sense it. He only adjusted his position slightly and took him almost to the root before swallowing around him.
Castiel often spoke to the squirrel like it would respond. He hoped one day it would. He wanted to hear the voice that went with those eyes. He smiled quietly as, instead of jumping right into his nest, it skittered its way up onto the counter top with a very squirrel-like chitter.
“Date’s not over yet.” Dean grinned at him easily now as his glass settled onto the table again. “There’s a park a bit down the street, if you don’t mind a walk.”
Dean seemed quite content to work him over slow and steady now, letting him catalogue the sensation of his mouth, of the brush of his beard against his skin each time it came in contact with Castiel’s skin. A soft little groan slid from him again as he felt Dean’s hand slip away, but the familiar snicking noise of the lubricant bottle opening was enough to stop him from any further protest.
Saman was really the baby of the family, a surprise, coming along almost ten years after Castiel. He did miss him sometimes, they’d been surprisingly close despite their age difference. Castiel’s trips home were usually more to check on Samandriel and his mother than to appease his father.
He glanced over his shoulder to watch Dean picking up the other fallen feathers, surprised a little at how the human gently gathered them up.
“Well then, hun, you’re in the right place. Dean, your usual?” Ellen asked his date. Dean simply nodded and then Cas couldn’t help a little half smile now still on his lips as he felt Dean’s foot press against his own under the table.
“I’m glad you came” Castiel rumbled quietly as he stepped back a moment later, clearly sober enough to remember that Dean wanted to exchange numbers. After a slight fumble or two on the brunet’s part he quickly had a number in his phone labeled “Castiel” and his own was in the handsome doctor’s own phone.
“Well, if it tastes anywhere near as good as it smells, I’m going to possibly die and go to heaven,” Cas admitted as he moved to put the bottle on the counter top, just watching Dean a little bit now. Green eyes flicked to him, there was another wink.
//Send me your address, I’ll see you then. :) //
“I am going into Molt, and I do not trust anyone but you, Dean Winchester, to see me through it,” Castiel stated simply now. His hands had moved to the loose tie and he was fumbling slightly trying to get it unfastened.
“I’m more than okay, and you are, so far, completely different than she was to me. You’ve asked me more questions about what I am comfortable with and want that she ever did after the first two or three nights.”
He grabbed his little bag of supplies and followed Dean to the desk, catching Charlie’s quite amused little wink and blushing brightly now. He hadn’t thought about how the others in there could have heard them. It had been the last thing on his mind, actually. He got his wallet out to pay for the the balance due now, which he knew was really more for Dean’s labor than anything else since his tattoo wasn’t done.
“Just me, little brother,” the familiar voice floated back and Castiel rolled his eyes. He wondered what brought him here. “I hope you don’t mind a house guest for a little bit?”
“Perfect, all right, Cas. I’ll see you tomorrow then, 2pm,” Dean said politely.
“Sammy I don’t know,” Dean groaned as he adjusted the mask for the third time. He felt silly, but the cowboy outfit had been easy to throw together, he’d already had parts of it. Letting Sam drag him to their friend’s Halloween party seemed a bit unnecessary though. He wasn’t sure he was ready for this, still recovering from the break up with Lisa, or so he liked to tell himself. It has been almost a year yet he still didn’t let himself date. It was a risk he wasn’t quite ready to take.
“Yes, it is.” Cas tipped his head up and kissed Dean. It was easier this time, without the audience, with Dean pulling him a bit more tightly to his side. They kissed for several long moments before Dean shifted to lay back on the bed, pulling Castiel with him.
“How much did you really drink Dean? Inebriation can cause you to slip up.” He said quietly, his fingers moved up his back and Dean’s utterly determined expression was so charming. He smiled quietly. “Or I could…”
“I want you to go down the hall, to the last door on the right. Undress, and kneel next to the bed. Can you do that for me?” Dean instructed, slow and steady. Cas couldn’t help admiring the way his eyes were dark and his pupils just a bit blown with pleasure. It was almost intoxicating. “If you can’t, if at any time...”
Now this he hadn’t expected, but he wasn’t going to object. He moved around and selected a cone and put it on the altar. In moments the brisk, spicy scent started to fill the air, and he smiled as he moved around the shop to set up for the day. The squirrel didn’t do more than sway on his shoulder.
It made Castiel blink. Cas was something that Gabriel usually called him, but he wasn’t used to anyone else saying it.
Castiel groaned and quickly hurried for the door. He needed to escape all of this before something really bad happened. Or something. He wasn’t sure.
Actually the latter sounded like a perfect solution to the excitement building inside of him. Dean’s kisses, the soft sensation of his beard, the way that the man smelled—they all would make for a lovely fantasy scenario.
Soon they were settled in a room with a pair of twin beds in it. Dean had thrown his bag at the foot of one and he settled in, stretching out slowly and he shifted a bit, twisting and rolling slightly before propping his head up to look at Castiel who had sat stiffly at the foot of the other bed. “So what’s up Cas?”
“Dean! You brought him!” Sarah bounced up to them, her cheeks already pink in a way that indicated she’d already been enjoying the free drinks. “I’m so glad! Castiel, it’s wonderful to see you again! Dean really should bring you to more events.”
“Mm. Hello, Dean. You are thinking about dinner?” Cas asked against his skin, lips moving to tease against Dean’s ear.
“Dean I love you too.” He growled out his hand moving to cup Dean’s chin, thumb brushing his cheek. “I have loved you a very long time…”
Once the phone was plugged in to charge Castiel moved quietly to undress himself. It was relaxing to strip down at the end of the day though it was a difference to end a date undressing alone, no matter how much he’d wanted Dean to stay. He found himself already half hard at the thought of the artist.
“That sounds more than reasonable,” he nodded quietly. “I’ve looked at your work online, it’s beautiful, well worth every penny, I should think.” He meant it, too. The work that Dean had in his online portfolio had been nothing short of impressive.
“Good. I make a mean breakfast.” Dean grinned and then he shifted to settle next to Castiel instead of on top of him and pulled the condom off, securing it before throwing it in a small bin not far from the bed itself. Cas stretched like a lazy cat before curling into his side, feeling the secure warmth of his arms around him.
“Tease,” Lucifer laughed softly. Cas didn’t mind though, his eyes were half closed in delight now, basking in Lucifer’s clear approval.
“Mm, I grew up in the church, like I said during our session, but I’ve always been fascinated by how different religions have different traditions and beliefs, and how some of them are the same across religions.” Castiel let his fingers squeeze Dean’s a little now. “I’m still religious in my own way, but I believe that God is genuinely benevolent and doesn’t care if I am a homosexual or straight or something in between.”
“Yes I do, now SCOOT, before things get worse, I’ll grab the rest of our things from the car.” Dean was reaching for his gloves. Castiel just sighed heavily and then nodded to himself. Phone carefully tucked in his pocket, the flutter of feathers took him from sight.
“I assume, then, that the only person you trust to help you through this is male?” Jimmy asked curiously, then he gave a little smile. “It’s fine. You have my permission to do whatever you need. I’ll just plug my ears and close my eyes, so to speak.”
“Cas, I can’t live without you. You are such a constant in my life, and you have been for so long,” he found himself saying, his breath stuttered a little. He could see how Cas’s eyes were getting wide now. “I can’t believe I didn’t realize it before now, Cas, but I don’t want anyone else at my side, in my life, sharing everything with me.” He saw those amazing lips parting a little, not even completely sure what was going on behind those beautiful eyes. “Castiel Novak, will you marry me?”
“Hey!” Sam pouted and then laughed as she leaned up to kiss his cheek, leaving a soft red smudge from her lipstick. Dean just let a laugh bark out of him as he lead them out to his beautiful car.
In some ways, Castiel knew he made his father exceedingly proud, if the man would admit to such a sin. Cas was successful in his field, and that he knew that even if they didn’t speak it was important to his father, and though it was not the way he was raised, Cas was still faithful. He rarely did anything in his adulthood to make his father ashamed other than being a homosexual, and he kept his perversions well away from prying eyes—the less his father knew about his sexual behaviors the better.
Cas found himself leaning into the other man’s side contently, enjoying the solid warmth of him. The walk was faster than he’d expected, but he certainly wasn’t going to get grumpy about it; there would be more walks. He let Dean help him into the passenger seat and sighed contently as the other man moved around to get in as well. He couldn’t stop from watching the handsome green eyed man, how he moved, the little things he did, the way his hands moved to start the car, grip the steering wheel.
“The same for me, then,” he said, and Ellen nodded before stepping away. Dean just laughed softly and let his feet catch Castiel’s foot more snugly now. “Don’t tell me I just ordered something ridiculous.”
“I’ve been studying how, like with large predatory birds that have been injured and are in captivity. I’ll be careful.” Dean said quickly and assuringly. Castiel felt a warmth inside of him that had nothing to do with drinking or even Dean’s declaration of love. He shifted to kiss him softly, very softly.
It was quiet for a number of minutes as he cuddled Abbadon, the cat moving to settle herself down and get comfortable in his lap, he stroked her fur gently and lazily. His phone chiming startled him and he moved to fish it out of his pocket and checked it. He had a missed message from Lucifer saying not to expect him back tonight, not that Lucifer actually spent much time here. Castiel wondered if the man had already managed to get himself a new apartment and just hadn’t told him.
“I’m going out to the hives today. Would you like to come?” Castiel asked Dean as he tugged on the straw hat he wore when going outside to the forest. He had a small covered case in his hand, planning to collect some honey.
He was not prepared for the rich voice that answered the phone after the second ring.
“Dean, the artist I chose, is going to send me some variations to pick from and I have an appointment next week to get it started.” Castiel shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. “Maybe I’ll even show it to you when it’s done.”
“You mean, do people assume we are dating and tell me to invite you along?” Castiel asked now and gestured at his phone. “I assume that the email did that? Quite frequently.”
“Well, I’m sure you’ll get a chance to find out,” he murmured quietly now, letting Dean see his eyes, see that they were dark, delighted. If the man fucked as well as he cooked, Cas was going to be in heaven. He took another bite slowly now, savoring it and then swallowing.
“Talk to ta me,” Dean coaxed gently now, scooting to the foot of his own bed and swinging his legs around so he could sit watching him.
He found himself peeking at his friend more and more, enjoying the warm flush that the alcohol put on Castiel’s face, enjoying how Cas got extra excited when talking about something he was passionate about and his hands would gesture dramatically. The way he licked his lips, and the intensity that his eyes met Dean’s with when he paused in conversation.
“Well, I am glad, I was starting to worry you’d never feel right…” Castiel paused and looked at the squirrel. “I am Castiel. What’s your name?”
“Are you certain you’re all right with this?” Castiel asked in uncertain concern. It wasn’t the same as asking permission to use his vessel. It was more intimate, and far more dangerous in some ways.
The bell jingled over head as he opened the door to the shop and stepped inside. Charlie, the pretty redhead from the other day, was leaning on the desk flirting with an equally pretty blonde who must have been a customer. Charlie paused in her talking to glance up at the doorway.
He knew this had to be done, but heaven knew he wasn’t going to be able to restrain himself well. Dean had apparently given up on dressing properly when he figured out that feathers were going to be everywhere and was just wearing loose sweatpants and no shirt. It was tempting; something Castiel had never really dealt with. In heaven, physical sensations worked so much differently.
Castiel leaned down to select some of the fallen feathers, only a few this time, there would be more later. He then stood to move over and tuck them gently into an inner pocket of the trenchcoat, to be later carried to another location. His wings shifted and flicked and stretched again as he moved.
Castiel let himself focus on that, on the soft scratch, the way that Dean’s lips smoothed over the skin, the way his hands moved to carefully grip his thighs and coaxed them further apart. It was easy to let himself focus on the new warmth building inside of him as Dean pulled away, making him shiver briefly as air hit his skin while Dean himself was moving, settling between his now spread thighs.
“You know, we don’t know when the power is coming back,” he teased playfully.
“You look very happy,” Castiel chuckled, before taking a bite of his own cheeseburger.
It lingered for a moment, then Dean was shifting away to tend to the bacon.
Dean wasn’t long at all, not quite to his surprise. After all, they’d never done this before, so it was unlikely the dom would leave him waiting too long. He kept his head bowed though as he felt Dean’s eyes slide over him. A hand brushed through his hair for a moment but the man didn’t say a word as he moved to get into a drawer. The urge to look up was strong but Cas tamped it down. He doubted Dean would ask him to do anything too drastic this first time together.
“No, but I think they pretty much expect me to. You were my guest at the event before Thanksgiving….” Dean looked back down at the invitation. The party was being held at a resort just outside of town. It would be a nice thing and they were booking rooms for everyone in case they got too drunk to drive. He’d been planning to enjoy himself at the open bar. Not that Cas going would be any less enjoyable, actually he found a good deal of comfort in the other man at his side.
It was a relaxation technique. They were going to be working for a while, Castiel knew it, but he was more than willing to indulge the point. He let himself hum quietly before replying.
Dean practically threw himself out of the bathroom and back down the hall to find Cas in the middle of a conversation with one of the ladies from payroll. He looked so gentle, so comfortable, so beautiful. Dean moved over, not noticing how people were shifting and watching him. He took a breath as he heard the lull in their conversation.
“Clearly, Elieen and I are headed home Dean…”
//I’m a familiar. I don't care what you do.// Ah, there was the bitterness. Someone had hurt him. Even if he didn’t have a witch, he’d known one, or perhaps more than one.
His fingers gently stroked once more before he settled himself on the bed. As much as he’d love to lay on his back, his tattoo was still fresh and he didn’t want to do anything to damage it. Cas rolled onto his stomach, adjusting his knees to lift his ass up, lubricant on his fingers as he reached back to coax one into himself slowly. His eyes closed and without much effort he was imagining that it was Dean doing this, opening him up properly. He knew the artist’s fingers would feel different, but it was nice to imagine.
“Whoa, whoa, hold up, Feathers, what the fuck are you doing?” Dean said quickly, his hands up. The human had actually taken another step back, his eyes sliding towards the door like he was assessing his chances of bolting.
It was the second that brought in familiars the most. Always ones suffering from loss of their companion. Accidents were common even among the magical community and it pained Castiel to see those who had lost hurting so. He wanted to help them feel better, to feel safe and able to live again.
“I refuse to grow my hair out just for one potential party, however…” The man smirked a little and did wink briefly, “yes.”
“Fuck I don’t want to stop kissing you” Dean was straddling him now and rolled his hips slowly down. Castiel groaned at that, feeling his body respond. It was not the first time that Dean Winchester made him get hard, but it was the first time he’d let him know. “But there is one more thing I wanna do for you this holiday.”
“It’s your idea, I’m just glad I could bring it to life,” Dean admitted quietly and then he cracked his neck before checking the time. “Give you fifteen minutes to relax then we’ll finish the lines? We’ll do color and shading another day.” He stripped his gloves off and tossed them in a bin and was flexing his fingers lazily, in an easy practiced motion that caught Castiel’s eye.
“Welcome to Family Business Tattoo. I’m Dean,” he greeted with a rich timber to his voice, the same as the one from the phone call yesterday afternoon, only more clear and rich in person. It made Castiel feel unexpectedly warm inside. He loved the brightness of it.
“Good morning,” he said softly as he moved around the small kitchen island.
“Now why would I do that?” Rumbled blue eyes, “you’re handsome from what I can tell, smart. And I hardly plan to go poof at midnight.”
Amazement was clearly painted across that beautiful face. Reassured, Cas let his wings slowly stretch back out, painfully aware of how much space they took up like this, how they felt. The itch that had only tickled at the back of his mind before now felt far more clear.
Castiel hummed quietly, more of a little sigh as he considered his answer. “Yes, I have four brothers. Two of them, like me, are out of the church and pursuing our dreadfully sinful lives in the real world. The other two are still with my parents. Though, in Saman’s case, he doesn’t have a choice. He’s still a minor. Gabriel offered to help him get emancipated, but he loves Mother very much. He’s her baby.”
“You will?” Dean asked, almost breathless.
“Facebook?” The man offered and Dean just laughed lightly. “Though I suppose that means you need my name.” They both laughed a little bit at that and then he paused, “Castiel.”
“Of course I did. You deserve help just as much as anyone else.” Castiel nodded and moved to clean up quietly. “Would you like to do a reading with me tonight?”
It was like a good session with a dom he could trust, surprisingly close to the comfort he felt when he was in a good scene. He found himself feeling a bit boneless and his eyes creeping closer to completely closed than not. Dean’s voice was soothing, the sound of the gun humming away was very comforting as well. Cas felt a slight jolt of surprise really when he felt a warm, but still gloved hand, against the back of his neck.
“Sir.” Dean’s voice was low and caused a ripple of pleasure to wash over him. One word and Castiel found himself relaxing into all of this.
Dean tapped his fingers to his lips as he considered the contents of the fridge thoughtfully. He’d gotten up this morning craving fried chicken, but he was thinking that chicken parmesan was a better choice. He could make a salad for Sam, who always wanted him to eat a green thing, and pasta, which Cas seemed fairly fond of since his return.
“Gabriel is worried about Castiel disappearing,” Sam looked smug, “I’ll let him know that he’s fine.”
“Shall we?” Dean grinned as he tugged the passenger door open for him.
They pulled up outside of a motel in the little Idahoan city and Dean took a breath as he turned Baby off. “I’ll get us a room.” He said quietly. “You, wanna come?”
Now that last part was thoughtful. Castiel hadn’t considered the best way to dispose of them on earth. He nodded in approval. “I’ll just wait here then,” he agreed quietly. Perhaps after Dean groomed some more loose feathers out, he’d show him how to oil them properly.
“I very much enjoyed this,” he murmured quietly as he started to pull back.
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice had dropped even lower than before. That request, it was.
“Just over there, already done.” Dean pointed with the spatula he was using.
Cas couldn’t stop the smile on his lips and he slipped into the opened door and headed for the second floor and for Dean’s apartment door. His stomach fluttered excitedly and he let himself gently push the door open as he’d been told.
Dean winked in a charming way that Castiel knew in a bar would make him even more interested, would have him offering the man a drink. There was already something he really liked about Dean as it was, but right now he was a client and Dean was his tattoo artist. Other than casual conversation, Cas wouldn’t dream of doing anything to mess that up.
“And if things work out I may be moving here perminiantly.”  Never mind, that addition changed things a little for Dean, very pleasingly. All worries about his break up recovery were being quickly chased from his mind.
“Friend, I believe. Gabriel is my older brother. I’m in town for a business event.” The man shrugged quietly as he explained himself.
Once Cas was undressed, a little shiver went through him. Not from cold exactly, but something else like anticipation, and then he rolled his neck, his shoulders, and considered the carpet under his feet. Dean hadn’t told him that he should take a pillow to kneel on, so he doubted that he’d be on his knees too long. He hoped not.
Dean’s free hand moved to cup the back of his head though and their lips met again quickly, this time a little more intensely, Dean’s mouth searching his, feeling him out. Cas wasn’t even a little ashamed at the soft needy noise that left his throat as he melted into it, lips parting easily to let Dean plunder his mouth. The sure feeling of those lips, the soft scratch again of his beard and then his tongue teasing, a promise of so much more. So much that could be between them and yet wasn’t currently there.
“Sir,” Dean reminded a little sharp but also indulgent in his tone.
“Sure thing. Usually can’t fit someone in so soon, but I have an opening tomorrow if that works for you, around 2pm?” The voice was easy and sounded pleased.
“Why don’t you show me how much you want to taste then,” Dean grunted softly and then he put the most subtle pressure on the back of Castiel’s head and the sub found himself leaning forward, mouth opening more properly to press softly a kiss to the heated skin, the warmth of Dean, the scent of him wrapping around him almost at once. Dean’s cock was hot and hard, and yet the skin so soft against his lips. He let his tongue flick out lightly to the skin to get the first hint of how Dean would taste.
Cas blinked and turned his head to give him a curious look, those beautiful blue eyes resting on him.  Dean felt his breath hitch at that and found himself almost instantly grabbing Castiel’s hand as he dropped to one knee.
“We’re not even actually dating; aren’t we doing this all backwards?” Cas asked with a little laugh now, fingers finding Dean’s and curling around them once more squeezing gently.
“Dean,” His cheeks were hot now and his blue eyes flew open to see Green, green that was tinged with fear, and maybe, just a little disappointment.
“Howdy Partner” A low gravelly voice startled him out of his wandering thoughts and Dean looked to his right to see the most intense pair of blue eyes looking at him from behind a designer mask. He blinked and let his left eyebrow go up, tipping his beer back briefly for a swallow before he let his eyes flick down to take in the outfit before him, his eyes going a bit wide in recognition.
“I always imagined them to be pure black you know.” Dean said quietly as very softly fingers brushed over them, just against them, not trying to fix anything yet. Cas felt a shiver and rolled a shoulder. “They’re beautiful.”
“Well, glad we’re on the same page.” Dean took a drink from his own glass and then he put it down and looked thoughtful. “I know we sort of talked about our pasts a little, but there are some things you need to know, about my tastes.” He stroked his beard slowly, watching Castiel, those intense green eyes sent a thrill through him.
One thing Castiel loved about having the squirrel around was not eating alone. He made little dishes of the exact same thing he was eating, presented them to the familiar and let him eat as he wished. The creature didn’t seem to like vegetables, which amused him, and absolutely loved burgers – which was welcome, because Castiel loved burgers and made them often.
A soft breath hitched in his throat as a warm breath hit the head of his cock. “De...Sir…”
It was two weeks of coaxing before the squirrel didn’t bolt when he brought out food. The only way Castiel was absolutely sure it was a familiar was how its eyes were green. Absolutely not a natural color in squirrels. They were bright jewels that followed his every movement during the day, in the evenings.
“Ouch, I’m sorry to hear that. My father isn’t totally comfortable with me either. I think he doesn’t quite understand bisexuality.” It was a very easy admission, so the man was clearly comfortable with it and not hiding it from anyone.
The next kiss felt like nothing less than being welcomed home.
Ellen wasn’t long in bringing their drinks over. Both of them went for the whiskey first. By the time the food had come, they’d figured out that they both liked science fiction and Lord of the Rings, though Dean complained a bit about the Hobbit movies while Cas playfully argued against his opinion. It was utterly comfortable. He hadn’t felt this instantly connected to a date in far longer than his time with Naomi.
“Yes, I think so. Maybe go as high as seven hundred once we’ve figured out the finer details,” Dean told him. Cas was hardly surprised by this, or bothered. He knew that tattoos weren't cheap, and he’d been saving for this one since deciding to get it. He was more than a little prepared for the amount, he’d been saving for a while and easily had twice that available to spend in his tattoo fund.
//White. 7pm?//
Dean seemed happy though and so Cas quietly stretched his wings and took off to retrieve the requested pizza, and breadsticks it seemed when he got their order. Cas smiled quietly at the indulgence. He quietly inquired about where to pick up some pie even in this weather and took a little detour before returning to the motel room. Dean was settled on the bed, looking, comfortable, happy.
“Fuck fuck fuck!” He let himself just give over to the pleasure. Cas’s mouth was amazing, made him feel absolutely as if he was in heaven, real heaven. He was so happy and overwhelmed with the pleasure. “Cas!”
Letting his own eyes close, Castiel concentrated on this, letting his lips work down over Dean, gently sucking, tongue teasing some more, tasting the precome already dribbling from his tip. This was so good, he hadn’t gotten to do this in far too long. Naomi had been unwilling to share him with male partners. It was a good feeling, to stretch his mouth around a cock like this and just let himself enjoy it, to let himself just keep working Dean over.
“What the fuck, Cas? You’ve been MIA for like a week, and now it’s necessary we go somewhere?” Dean scowled and moved to get up. “Let me at least grab my duffle.”
“Just as long as it’s not another three months this time,” Castiel countered, though it was lightly said.
“I still don’t understand why you made me get all of this. Why are there so many blankets in here?”
Dean, though, cupped his chin with his fingers. “Just Dean here,” he promised softly.
With the thought of making Dean a little more interested in mind, he got dressed in snug comfortable jeans and a tight tee shirt. Dean had texted him that he should dress comfortably and be prepared to eat well. He’d smiled at that suggestion. Lucifer had teased him about his sex hair, that’s what his brother called it when the style his hair took was messy even with the use of hair gel. He’d rolled his eyes at the older Novak and hurried out, eager to get to Dean’s place and see what was in store for him.
He wasn’t prepared for it in the slightest, and the shiver that went down his spine was almost immediate. But instead he found himself fully focusing on how gently Dean was brushing his fingers through his wings, coaxing the loosest of the feathers out and straightening others. His touches almost seemed instinctive, with the way that Dean’s fingers moved some of the lightly twisted and tangled feathers till they were straight and laying like they should.
“What is it?”
“The one that hurt you?” Dean mused quietly. He raised a hand though and waved it to stop Cas before he could say anything else. “You don’t have to give me any details. Been there, absolutely understand.” Dean offered an easy wink at him now and that was unexpected, but made Castiel feel warm inside. “I had to avoid the place after a break up, too, and haven't really had much reason to go back.”
//I had a fantastic time, I’d like to see you again next week. My place.// the text said, simple and yet, clearly, Dean was as eager as he was.
He’d never asked his brother his sexuality, but he was fairly sure Gabriel would have sex with just about anyone from the way he talked about it.
It was tempting to touch them but he resisted. He didn’t even know this man and he was not about to do something rash that could ruin his chance to have the tattoo he wanted. No, he didn’t want that. He took a breath and then settled back, looking around at the pictures on display along the walls of the station.
//I’ll be right back,// Dean said, jumping down, and Castiel smiled but waved him off. He busied himself with organizing things and considered what to make for dinner. Honeybread sounded nice, considering the fresh supply he could use some of what remained in his cupboard.
Not that Sammy seemed to mind. It was cute.
It really had been too long since a real person, or at least someone other than himself, had touched him this way, and Cas was reveling in it. One finger was shortly two, and now Cas found the urge to squirm rising, to try to ride the fingers inside of him. Dean used that to his advantage, mouth descending once again to suck him almost completely down and swallowed, making Cas cry and his fingers tangle once more with the bedding.
Dean found it easier within two people to just introduce Cas as his partner. Everyone they met clearly assumed it was romantic anyway. Halfway through the evening, he figured out why. Practically every story he’d ever told at work involved Cas in some way.
The smell of bacon tickled Cas’s nose and he shifted his weight with a sigh, humming quietly, his eyes still closed. He sighed a bit slowly, breathing in the scent of the bacon, and of Dean, and him. He smiled a little and let his eyes crack open, shifting to look around. Dean’s side of the bed was cool but it was okay. He knew that cooking bacon was time consuming. He was curious what the man had made for their promised breakfast.
“Thank heaven, because that would be a line I couldn’t cross,” Castiel replied dryly now, and then he let himself smile as he checked his watch. “All right, he’ll be here any minute,” He admitted, taking a calming breath.
“Of course.” Jimmy seemed surprised but not unwilling.
“Good night, Dean,” Cas replied now, watching him turn and walk back down towards the Impala. Cas did allow himself to just watch as Dean got in, the engine rumbling a little louder as he moved to pull away. A heavy sigh slipped from the brunet’s lips and then he turned to let himself in, a smile gracing his mouth as he headed up to his apartment.
He went to put his phone on its charger. Dean’s address had come through by then and he was glad to see it wasn’t terribly far from his own residence, it made him smile and relax at the realization. He replied with a thumbs up and then groped for the charger cord.
When Sam had pushed them out the door saying this case was one they were well suited for Dean frowned at him, but allowed it. His brother had been more than a little distracted with, whatever little project he’d been working on so he hadn’t argued too hard against this. Sam could use a little alone time he supposed.
The man already knew the worst of it, or at least the worst in Zachariah’s eyes. And Cas would never, ever let him know anything else about his tastes and needs.
All of Dean’s concentration was on a pot that smelled like it had oil and seasoning in it. He glanced up after a moment and winked at Cas, then looked back down, and shortly was pulling what looked like the most beautiful and crispy looking potato wedges Castiel had ever seen out in a mesh strainer that he propped on the edge of the pot before moving smoothly to flip the burgers that were merrily cooking away on a stove top griddle.
“You know, Dean, I really enjoyed last night,” Cas started quietly now. “I’ve not had the chance to do anything submissive for anyone since my last relationship ended.” He reached for his coffee cup and hummed. “I would like to tell you what happened to me. I think it’s only fair if our relationship is going to continue like this that you know.”
“You’re Peacocks!” Dean said abruptly and Castiel just stared, his blue eyes widening at the declaration. “That’s adorable! Wait! I can’t see your wings, do you ever use them like that without thinking?”
This friendship lead to moving in together off campus as juniors and eventually moving again after Dean graduated with a good job offer. Castiel just happened to be going to grad school in the same city, so why mess with a good thing? They decided to get another apartment together.
“Seems the motel owner doesn’t want their customers to freeze if the power goes out.” Dean shrugged as he dug into the bags and started to pull out garland and candles. The candles landed on the table and the garland Dean started unspiraling from it’s little cardboard at once.
However, the handsome fox squirrel, who was a little large even for his species, made himself right at home. He’d built a nest behind the counter in the shop and had a second one in Castiel’s own living quarters upstairs.
Castiel could feel the familiar’s fluttering heartbeat, the way he breathed. It seemed as if  they were now linked. Something that hadn't been there before he cast the spell.
Dean had an easy smile as he listened to Castiel’s admittedly rambly statement, and then he motioned for Castiel to have a seat on the chair. Cas complied and he offered up the folded sketch. Dean’s hands, he noticed as the artist reached for the paper, looked strong and capable. His fingers were gorgeous, long and nimble.
“Okay, you might just be a keeper then.” It was playful and easy and it made Castiel feel like nothing could go wrong here. He knew of course that the conversation they needed to have likely would not go so simply. There were things that Dean really needed to know about. He wondered a little too if the artist had his own secrets to share. He tried not to dwell on it though.
There was a soft rustling noise then the familiar sound of a camera shutter. Then Dean was touching him again, soothing this time as he applied the necessary ointment to his skin. By the time the light bandage was applied, to protect his now sensitive skin from his shirt, Cas was fully back in the waking world.
“So, uh,” Dean glanced up at him, “you going to need me to hang around through all of this?”
“And as you have seen, I don’t have a familiar. You are welcome to stay as long as you need, Dean.” Castiel smiled and took another bite of his burger and chewed thoughtfully as he watched the squirrel swallow some of the food in its – his mouth. How Dean took his time, eating the small burger slowly, but fully. Dean flopped over when he was done, his stomach round. It was cute.
“A pleasure, Charlie, and I think I’m going to like it here, too,” Castiel agreed before moving over to the desk with Dean, who was checking the computer and typing in a few things quickly.
“I don’t see why not, but I apologize if I step on your feet.” Rumbled blue eyes. “I have to admit you’re the best company I’ve had since arriving in this town, but I’m not the best dancer.” He got up and offered his hand to Dean. The green eyed man grinned and accepted, he wondered if blue eyes would be just as happy to spend time with him when not masked. They moved out together to join everyone else, though Dean realized he felt a little unsteady, however a hand at his back made it more than easy to stand and he found himself wrapped up in warm arms in moments. They weren’t so much dancing at swaying, that was fine too.
“Take care, Cas, I’ll see you soon,” Dean called after him, and then he heard something more blurred in his mind being said to Meg while she laughed easily as the door swung closed.
