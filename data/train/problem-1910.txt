He knew that John deserved an explanation for what had just happened. The soldier would demand details that Sherlock did not want to give. They would only upset him.
Sherlock fiddled with his cufflink as he replied, “Nine years, ten months, twenty-six days, two hours and...” He checked his watch. “Thirty-four minutes.”
This chapter has an oblique reference to stillbirth. If you think that may be triggering, please do not read. I am happy to send you a summary that excludes that reference if you want. Just ask!
The secretary barges into the room, frightened by the noise level. She’s now holding Rosie back while the headmaster suggests that Sherlock leave now and give Rosie some time to cool down. Sherlock, completely blindsided and crushed, leaves the textbook and flees.
“You didn’t know how to do your sums before school, did you?”
"John…"
Rosie beamed.
“Greg, be a dear and fetch some wine. We need a nice red for dinner tonight. “
The soft words do not reach the detective who seems frozen in the act of gripping his own hair. Any movement at all would be encouraging, but Sherlock is motionless. John moves deliberately slowly to kneel in front of him. Carefully, he peels Sherlock’s fingers out of his curls and places the detective’s hands at his sides. John brushes the tangled curls out of his eyes and raises the Sherlock’s chin to make eye contact. He still looks a million miles away, but he is not fighting John.
Sherlock’s shoulders slumped with relief.
“I should be going,” said Wiggins, shattering the silence. “Two weeks, Shezza,” he muttered cryptically. He quickly gathered his things and all but ran out of the flat. He managed a contrite grimace at John on his way out.
John kissed and nipped along Sherlock’s chin, paused to suck at his pulse point. Sherlock moaned long and low. He couldn’t keep his hips from trying to grind against John’s, but John held himself up and away. John was an unexpected tease! Pleasure zinged through him. He could already feel himself dripping in his pants.
“I was more concerned with the aftermath.”
John kisses him gently then steps back. He runs his hand through his own hair and looks at the ground. There was something important he meant to say…
“Well, I can certainly help with that.”
“Apologies, John. You look wonderful. You know how much I adore you in that sweater.”
“What’s he done now?” John asked cheekily, leaving the question intentionally vague so that Anthea would need to ask for clarification or choose her own meaning. This was a strategy he’d learned from Sherlock. People’s assumptions were often extremely revealing.
John's eyes go wide with concern.
John hunched forward and gripped his knees tightly, ignoring his own sweaty palms. “I don’t think that."
By the time he caught John up, the doctor was already arguing with Lestrade. The odds did not look good for the DI. John was already a hairsbreadth away from losing his composure. As he got close enough to catch the words, he was surprised to find that John’s indignation was on his behalf.
"For you."
John's mouth answers before his brain can register the change in topic.
“Wha-”
John comes back to awareness at the sound of his name. He had been lost in his head for a moment there.
“Why didn’t you want me here?”
John’s throat was tight, but he forced his way through it. Now that he’d begun, he found that he was quite relieved. The words came more easily than he’d ever believed they might.
John’s voice had dropped dangerously low and his teeth were grinding with restraint. The infuriating bureaucrat merely uncrossed his arms and fixed John with a penetrating stare that, for once, did not unnerve him. John refused to back down, knowing that the information he sought was imperative if he was to help Sherlock.
“Sherlock! I forgot. The postman came by while you were out. I put the mail on the kitchen table. I couldn’t find anywhere else since you refuse to get rid of all that clutter. I mean honestly! If you would only let me clean once in a while, say every two weeks, then there would be a place to put received mail and tea trays and the like. I don’t know…
The very word sends a smile across John’s face. Sherlock doesn’t notice his own spine relaxing in response.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow and waited for John to elaborate. John made a show of settling back into the seat before answering. “Of course they haven’t,” he repeated spreading his arms in front of him as if it should be obvious. “You haven’t arrived yet.”
The detective yielded with poor grace and sat where he was in the middle of the floor.
Mycroft twirled his umbrella uncomfortably. “You misunderstand me. I’m sure he would tell you if he could, John, but my brother is regrettably under sedation at the moment. You need to prepare yourself. Sherlock is going to need someone in his corner. Can I count on you to be that person?”
An hour later, they were seated in comfortable wingback chairs at the wonderfully eclectic Flap and Throttle Pub. The chairs were arranged around a table made from a discarded aeroplane propeller. The blades, attached to a central hub, were visible beneath a layer of thick glass. It was as if whoever designed the table found an old turbine engine and decided to use it as a sturdy base for the glass topper.
The room was quintessentially Sherlock, and John momentarily forgot his reason for entering as he took in the details around him. A not-so-subtle throat clearing from the hallway reminded him quite quickly, and he made his way to stand beside the bed. John looked down at the gaunt figure and struggled to identify his friend.
Sherlock’s mouth popped open in disbelief, and he stared at John. The minutes ticked by, and John was too afraid to move. He felt his worth being weighed in the balance and he didn’t want to tip the scale.
The sob finally fights it way out of Sherlock’s chest and his shoulders shake with the effort. John cups his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and draws the man forward to rest their foreheads together.
As the screen flared to life, the phone began to vibrate and ding. It seemed that John had received several notifications over the course of the morning. He breathed a sigh of relief. The only person that ever really bothered to text him was Sherlock. The berk must have surfaced and realized he’d left John behind. He ignored several email notifications and swiped the green text icon. Line upon line of grey text filled the screen.
dad.”
John swirled his whiskey, listening to the pleasant chime of ice on glass. “Bad day was it?”
After the engagement celebration, John sits up and sweeps the dust out of his hair. He looks down at Sherlock, who is still lying on his back, palm pressed to his chest, and breathing hard. He looks so young in this moment. The age and worry lines are smoothed away and replaced with a glowing happiness that suffuses his entire being. Beautiful.
“Post?”
“Sherlock, some help please.”
Sherlock draws his right hand out of his coat pocket and flicks open a small black velvet box.
John took a deep breath that hissed out through his clenched teeth.
“Twenty minutes, and you make the tea.” It was the best counteroffer John could think up.
Was this a remnant of their fight last night? Had Sherlock decided John was not to be trusted any longer? His chest ached with the severity of his longing to grab a piece of the man and make him stay. John longed to pull the answers out of him for a change – to finally understand a fraction of what went on it that great mind of his.
Sherlock swallowed convulsively, buying time to formulate the words he needed, but he couldn’t find them. They simply didn’t come. The cab had stopped moving, Sherlock’s brain registered faintly in the background. He didn’t have time for that particular deduction, not when John was sitting there looking at him like he held the secrets to the universe.
Without looking back, Sherlock dragged the robe off his shoulders and left it crumpled in a ball on the sofa. Smoothing the lines from his shirt, he slipped on his suit jacket and folded the Belstaff over his arm. The afternoon was still a little warm, but he would want it later.
He maneuvers Sherlock back to his chair so that he can straddle his lap and nip at his neck while they talk.
Sherlock stands and heads for the door.
John squirms nervously and looks down. An uncalculated decision that puts his attention on Sherlock’s cock straining against the constricting cut of his pristine trousers. John swallows down his desire to focus on the conversation at hand.
Sherlock holds onto the cold metal safety bar as they wheel John through the sliding doors. His head spins as he takes in the florescent lighting and rapid-fire dialogue. He wishes John were here to explain the medical shorthand. Sherlock has no chance of deciphering it on his own. Suddenly, a weathered, gentle hand grasps him by the shoulder. Sherlock struggles against the hold, his panic rising as adrenaline floods his system.
John had been checking Sherlock over while Mycroft was speaking. One thing was immediately evident to him.
M’s eyes flashed dangerously, and he clucked his tongue. Sherlock’s shoulders hunched automatically, reading the disapproval in the action and preparing for the blowback. Retribution would be swift. He’d experienced it often enough to know. His eyes fixated on the tile floor, and he waited.
"What?"
“Seems impossible.”
Sherlock spent the next quarter of an hour lost in the rhythmic ritual of washing and handing the items off to be dried. John, for his part, remained steady. He dried the items with the same exquisite attention to detail. He made sure they were not streaky or greasy before lining them on the counter.
[TEXT] Cheeky bastard. Yes, same address.
Sherlock nodded tersely.
“What a wonderful demonstration of toxic hyperbole! Besides-”
"Mrs. Turner keeps a tidy house," Mycroft said, apropos of nothing. At John's questioning stare, he elaborated. "The charming caretaker turned housekeeper you just met."
Sherlock’s tone slides into vulnerability toward the end. He shifts his weight onto his left leg and looks at John demurely through his lashes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shut up, you berk!"
John took a moment, breathed deeply, and forced his brain to think past the white fog engulfing it. “What happened?” he asked breathily.
“— bully.”
John was startled out of his train of thought by the slightly exasperated sound of a throat being cleared. The voice was much too deep and much too haughty to be Anthea’s. John’s eyes swept across the floor to a perfectly polished pair of brogues. His eyes continued to sweep up the tailored lines of a three-piece suit until they landed on a familiar face. Those disconcertingly sharp eyes bored into John’s own, and he felt himself speak before he even knew what he was saying.
John blinks back tears and smiles at his own self-indulgence.
“Sherlock?”
“Would you sit with me? Please?”
“But whyyyyyy?”
John planted a soft kiss on Sherlock’s cheek. “I want to be
John, having finished his tea, stood to put their cups in the sink. He appreciated Sherlock letting him in, but he wasn’t going to push him. He felt confident that Sherlock would tell him when he figured it out.
The reality of what just happened washes over John as they slide into a cab. At the time, he had been fixated on keeping Sherlock calm and following his instructions. Now, images of Mary flood his mind: Mary bent over her herbs in her big, floppy gardening hat; her bright smile as she incorporates them into her cooking; the smear of dirt she always seems to track down her nose; the tang of earth John smells when he kisses her cheek. All lies. Every last part of their life together had been a lie.
He squirmed in his seat as a flush rose up his neck. The man behind him chuckled and slid his hand to Sherlock’s shoulder, tugging on the lapel of his coat.
“Mmm.”
“You don’t have to – “
John frowned. How was he supposed to understand if Sherlock wouldn’t even tell him the basics? “Ok – good. Can you tell me what it’s for?”
"Because I am in the middle of a relapse. Obvious."
“It’s a-a complicated chemical process.” Sherlock told him. “The effects are not insubstantial.” He looked at John from under his eyelashes, and if John didn’t know him better he would have thought Sherlock was being coy. He seemed to weigh his next words carefully.
"Sherlock."
“You can’t sleep here, John. It’ll play hell with your shoulder.”
Sherlock looks at the headmaster, but the man looks just as confused.
John could see the offering for what it was. Sherlock was opening himself, just a little, allowing John to see glimpses of the truth.
Sherlock smiles a lazy, half-smile at him, and John decides he doesn't really care. However this happened, and he's certain Sherlock will tell him later, John is exactly where he wants to be. He heaves himself into a full-body stretch and takes pleasure in the shiver that ripples through his muscles. He feels surprisingly well rested.
Sherlock’s thoughts were on his blogger as his body went through the motions of measuring, pouring, cutting, and crushing. He had run similar tests hundreds of times. He could afford to concentrate his efforts on unravelling the mystery that was his flatmate.
“Bloody brilliant.”
Sherlock just doesn’t know. He relies on John for these kinds of things. John collapses heavily onto the sofa and motions for Sherlock to sit as well.
“It’s clean, I swear.”
He was shorter than Sherlock remembered. Even seated, the height disparity was obvious. The choice had been deliberate then.
“Did you get to show off?”
Sherlock had never given much thought to the idea of finding his soulmate. He’d just assumed he didn’t have one, or that they’d already died.
“Absolutely not. We’ve discussed this.”
M’s smile lacked all kindness. He ran his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, a sick imitation of a lover’s caress. “Such a smart boy.”
He grins but doesn’t reply. Sherlock almost makes it into his flat, almost.
Sherlock didn’t think he could. He bullied his legs to move and he managed to get them underneath him before they buckled. He tipped sideways, grabbing at John desperately. John caught him reflexively, just like Sherlock knew he would. He gripped John by the shoulders and hid his face against the doctor’s neck. He felt John tense, but Sherlock couldn’t care. He knew this was outside the constraints of typical flatmate behavior. It was even outside the constraints of their unusual brand of close-yet-platonic. Sherlock inhaled, and the scent of John settled some of the discordant jangling inside of him.
A rather large part of Sherlock wanted to be disgusted by his own behavior over these last few days. He had allowed himself to slip into patterns that were best left in the past. He could not afford to let emotion dictate his actions when logic had always offered a more tangible, more defensible result.
“Sir?”
Concerto No. 2, the detective had excused himself to use the loo, and when he hadn’t returned by intermission, John had known he’d been ditched. His first instinct had been to track Sherlock down and make his displeasure known, but he’d been annoyed and wouldn’t give Sherlock the satisfaction of ruining the outing. Besides, John had been enjoying the program immensely and had been especially looking forward to Tchaikovsky’s
“I am given to understand that these kinds of issues are often the subject of discussion between friends.”
“Your sheets are nicer than mine. More comfortable.”
“To be clear, are you talking about the physical aspects of a relationship?” John asked, his cheeks growing pink. He knew it was awkward phrasing, but he couldn’t think of a more sensitive way to put it that wouldn’t come across as horrifically cliché.
“Oi, shut it.”
He slaps Stephen’s ass and the sound reverberates around the room. Then he squeezes a taut handful, relishing the warmth blooming across the abused skin.
John's face flushes with shame as he stares at his feet.
John squirmed and fought with himself. This felt much closer to a betrayal of Sherlock’s confidences. He remained silent while he thought about the right way to word what he was going to say, settling on phrasing that was specific enough to convey his knowledge but vague enough that someone who did not know already would not be let in on the information.
He watches Sherlock’s arse flex with every thrust, his powerful shoulders rippling as he holds himself above John. He watches the emotions play over Stephen’s face as he pulls him deep into his throat. John reaches for his cock. It needs to be touched. Right the fuck now. He pumps into his fist and loosens his mouth to allow Stephen to fuck into it. All three bodies move at the same tempo. Sherlock fucks into John who is forced onto Stephen’s cock and back off as Sherlock slides out. John can taste salty pre-ejaculate on his tongue and doesn’t know how much longer he himself will last. His fist flies along his own cock, liberally lubricated by his own arousal. Sherlock’s thrusts are faltering as he breathes erratically.
John swiped out of the text chain and checked the rest of his notifications. None from Sherlock. His heart sank as he pressed the banner indicating he had several missed calls and a voicemail.
flap of his hand, but Mycroft is not so easily deterred. He walks over to stand next to his brother and his voice is low but firm.
ok - read on!
Rosie’s laughter is high-pitched, shrill, and completely unnatural.
Mycroft returned the photograph to the file. “That is James Moriarty, although I am told he prefers to be known only as ‘M’ these days. But then, Sherlock always did go in for a touch of drama.”
"No. Fill me in?"
Sherlock blinked at him, absorbing the meaning and parsing the need to respond. John was patient though. He watched Sherlock and waited as if he had all the time in the world. He couldn’t be comfortable like that though, his leg curled up underneath him. He’d be limping tomorrow. Sherlock made a noise of distress which John immediately misinterpreted. He frowned but gestured at Sherlock.
John is so distracted that he doesn’t notice them arrive. Sherlock looks down and clears his throat. The sound is an admonishment that fades into amusement. Sherlock turns them so that John is facing an abandoned building.
“I don’t put much stock in that stuff.” John gestured at the novel.
John was reluctant to bring up whatever had happened, but he needed to make sure that Sherlock wasn’t suffering.
“Alright,” John soothed. “Will you stop pacing around like a caged tiger and talk to me? I want to understand.”
Sherlock curls one leg underneath himself and sits facing John.
Greg nods, and Sherlock sighs. Clearly, he will have to spell out every detail.
“You have no idea how hot you look right now, John.”
As he stepped out of the clinic, he was buffeted by a wave of pedestrians hurrying down the street. He huffed in annoyance and pulled himself up against the building until they’d passed. When the sidewalk cleared, John could see a sleek black car idling at the curb. A nondescript man exited the driver’s seat, circled the car, and held the back door open. He took the bag from John and deposited it in the trunk while John slid inside.
“Now, go get changed. I’ll keep Molly entertained until you’re ready.”
Three dots appear as John stares at the phone. He's not sure his electronic demands actually warrant a smartphone, but Mary had insisted. This is one of the only perks he has found useful so far. He can see that Sherlock has read his message and is typing. The screen goes dead for a moment and John's heart drops. The three dots reappear for a moment before a message quickly replaces them.
Last week, Sherlock had been twirling the knife from the mantelpiece while thinking about the gestational period of guinea pigs. He had been so engrossed in his thoughts, that he hadn’t noticed Mrs. Hudson cleaning. After she threw away his algae experiment, Sherlock had stomped across the sitting room and hurled the knife into the air, striking the ceiling and cracking the tile.
After what seemed like an eternity, the room stopped spinning. John had just managed to keep his feet under him. He felt slightly nauseous and spent several minutes focusing on slowing his breathing.
“Hypno, as it’s known on the street,” Sherlock started, “is a modified variant of rophenol – the date rape drug. It is extremely fast acting and almost as quickly metabolized making it extremely challenging to identify.”
. He’s the important one in the family, isn’t he? I’ve been done with you for months now, Sherlock, but I couldn’t get close to Mycroft without you. So, John and I needed to stay together. He values your friendship so much, and you would do anything for him. Without him, I would be of no consequence to you, and I needed you invested.”
“Erm, he left for university at sixteen, studied chemistry, dropped out a bit before graduation…”
Sherlock was shocked into silence for a moment. It never occurred to him that she would have that fear. He pulled back so that he was looking down into her ruddy, tear-stained face. His face was so gentle. John froze in the middle of drying a pan and wished he had spent some time cultivating a mind shack, as Sherlock had suggested. To recall this memory in every single detail would be a treasure. He soaked up what he could, knowing he’d never recreate it perfectly. Sherlock smoothed away Rosie’s tears with his fingers.
Sherlock rocked back on the stool, and, for a brief moment, John was afraid that he would tip over. Balancing himself on the knife’s edge, Sherlock leaned forward and brought the stool crashing back down on its front legs.
Sherlock curled in on himself and sneered.
He slides his hand up and down the smooth skin of Sherlock's thigh, hitching it slightly higher. John's other hand grasps at Sherlock's sweat-soaked curls as he licks his way into Sherlock's mouth. He chuckles into the kiss as Sherlock scrambles to undo the tie of his dressing gown. Not waiting for Sherlock to take it all the way off, he gently places Sherlock's leg back on the ground and sinks to his knees.
M had planned this meeting down to the last detail. A brightly-lit restaurant, easily viewed from the outside, lit specifically to draw the eye to the singular table…
His own arms wrapped easily (too easily) around Sherlock. The man was worryingly thin, yet he didn’t feel fragile. Determination carved its way across his broad shoulders, given him a certain sturdiness he’d lacked these last few weeks.
“I didn’t need a mark to tell me that.” John’s voice was steady as he pushed Sherlock’s curls back from his face. “I knew the moment I met you.”
“You have the number here at the surgery. If any issues arise, you let us know. Bye now, Mr. Wickham!”
“Not really,” Sherlock admitted. “It’s not a matter of just running tests. I know you’re perfectly capable, but I have to be able to make the necessary connections.”
His name rings out in a steady, earnest voice he recognizes from his childhood. It is the voice that told him bedtime stories filled with swordfights and gold. It is the voice that instructed him to hold his fingers "just-so" on the violin. It is the voice that long ago (and more recently in Serbia) signified safety, comfort, and home.
“I couldn’t stop it.” Sherlock forced himself to continue and his voice finally broke. It was now a reedy whimper, all crushed glass and broken edges. He needed John to understand that he didn’t want it. He didn’t ask for it, no matter what his body had done. He drew in a shaky breath. “I don’t know exactly what was done to manipulate the drug, but I know that it was altered to achieve the desired effect.”
M uncrossed his legs and stood, leisurely making his way to stand behind Sherlock. When he spoke, his voice was a whisper and he was so close that Sherlock could feel his breath like a caress on the back of his neck. It made his skin crawl, and he shivered. He regretted having removed his scarf.
“Is there a reason you’re naked in my bed?”
Sherlock chanced a look and was struck by the shockingly gold hue of John’s hair beneath the intense light of the lamp he was using to pore over the police files. The soft grey that had crept in around the edges of his hairline was almost white in the warm glow, giving the illusion that it wasn’t there. Sherlock felt as though he was catching a glimpse of a different John, ten years younger and a world away from the damage the war had wrought. The sight sent a delicate, fluttering feeling flitting through his stomach.
Sherlock doesn't want to hear him say it. He doesn’t want to listen to John explain away his feelings. He doesn't want to hear John belittle, minimize, fold it down to a breathless sigh that might never have been there at all. Just this once, Sherlock wants to get it right. For him to speak and John to listen. He wants John to understand that he feels this way too. That he has lived, several times over, for the strength of loving John.
“Strange? Aw, don’t be like that darling. We’ve all got a kink or two. No shame in that.”
Sensing the direction of John’s thoughts, Sherlock gives a pleased hum of agreement. The air is particularly mild tonight, a blessing for which John is deeply grateful. He hasn’t had the old hunting jacket out for a while, and the lining of his dress coat just isn’t quite the same. Sherlock pulls him in tighter, so their legs are flush. John can’t help looking up adoringly at the tall, strange, genius man that has chosen him. It still seems frankly incredible.
Conclusion: John Watson and Sherlock Holmes love one another and want to be together.
“I know, bit annoying, right?”
“You treat me like shit, and I let you. What the fuck does that say about me, hmm?”
Sherlock can read the memory of his promise in the deep anguished blue of John's eyes.
John turned back around and immediately wished he hadn’t. Sherlock looked stuck in a memory. His face was tinged a nasty green, and John was sure he was going to be sick. Beneath the greenish color, he looked somehow impossibly paler than normal.
here?” John flinched at his callous and tactless opening. “Why are you
Outside his office, the clinic was a tornado of motion. There were children crying and papers fluttering. Lisbeth was trying to herd a senile old man into a waiting examination room, and the receptionist’s phone was a switchboard of blinking red lights.
Sherlock pauses and cocks an eyebrow as Greg powers on.
John gaped helplessly at the solid wood of the door for a full minute. This was not at all how he thought this evening would go. He almost wished he’d stayed and let Sherlock ruin his novel.
The top two rows twist completely off the Rubik’s cube, and both pieces land on the ground. Sherlock barely hits the pause button before he is curling in on himself. His body is shaking and his lungs burn with the need to breathe more deeply. He rests his face against his drawn-up knees. He stays that way for several minutes, letting himself have this. A part of him is glad John isn’t here right now. It almost seems like a kindness.
At that moment, John realized that Sherlock was exposing his private thoughts. He was letting John glimpse the worlds of emotion that existed in the brilliant, usually inaccessible universe of Sherlock’s mind.
, he thought.
John was not entirely certain they were talking about him anymore, or about the present for that matter.
“It wouldn’t.”
“I meant to build up my walls, push you away, give you the opportunity to move on and start a normal life. A life that isn’t always threatened by the spectre of violence and darkness and death. I meant to give you the chance to have the life that you deserve, but I failed. I failed you, John, and I keep on failing. I’m not strong enough or I’m too selfish. I guess in the end it amounts to the same thing if it bears the same result. I can’t stay away from you any longer.”
"We'll stay here…for John."
"I would not have wasted the scotch if I meant to harm you, Dr. Watson. Sherlock's room is just the end of this hall."
known?"
But the comfort wouldn’t come. Sherlock felt like insects were swarming over his skin where it touched John’s, and he fought to keep his hand still. He knew that John would let go immediately if he sensed how Sherlock felt, and that was the last thing he wanted. His body simply refused to communicate with his brain, which knew quite rationally that John’s touch was different. John’s touch was gentle and patient and kind. John’s touch was
“Mmm.”
“Ta, Greg,” John replied, already thinking about how to broach the case with Sherlock. “I’ll have him take a look, yeah?”
John wracked his brain for a new line of questioning, but he couldn’t imagine what in the world Sherlock was trying to tell him. “Is it…Is there someone else?” he asked, already knowing that Sherlock would scoff at the prospect.
"Why do I need a jar of piss that will test positive for opiates?"
He was just stirring sugar into a second cup when Sherlock growled with frustration.
He struggled to make sense of the abrupt shift that had just taken place. There were facts he needed to know. John's mind raced to sort the most important questions from his own inane curiosity.
John mutters sleepily and burrows into the pillow under his head.
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 2 - Gardening.
Sherlock sweeps out of the room, leaving John perplexed. He is back in less than a minute carrying a small plastic cup. John backs away and tries to avoid it, but Sherlock pushes it into John's hands, smiling craftily.
“Never doubted you. ‘Ta.”
John’s head is spinning and the air in the room might be a little thin. He’ll have to remember to tell Sherlock to look into that.
“John.”
John was buoyed by the response, but he sensed that the man was still holding something back.
He’d been silent for too long. Drawing his mind back to the task at hand, he began to wash an Erlenmeyer flask.
Had he been sober, he’d have seen where that game was headed. But he’d been high all the time back then, and he hadn’t cared overly much about the future. It’s hard to care about protecting a future that you’re not convinced you're likely to have.
Stephen shakes his hand but his eyes are glued to John, who seems unsure of his role now that he’s brought these two men together.
“Rosie, I don’t—”
Halfway through Bach’s
John had never seen Sherlock look so small.
Sherlock shot out of the cab without a backward glance while John pulled a few rumpled bills out of his pocket.
John commands Sherlock’s attention with a single word. He doesn’t even need to raise his voice. Suffused with the power of Captain Watson, John’s soft voice is enough. Sherlock turns reluctantly toward John, his face wiped worryingly blank. He stands like carved marble, waiting for John’s judgment.
“How is His Nibs?” said Greg with genuine interest.
Privately, Sherlock agreed. He could definitely get used to the soft domesticity of teasing one another and spending hours on meals he had no inclination to eat just to watch John come apart at the seams. The sight of John, head thrown back and eyes resplendent with glee, lit a matching desire in him. He longed to be that free again. There was a mirth in John that Sherlock had not felt in years. Not since before…
When John did not immediately follow, Sherlock poked his head back through the doorway. John stood by the workbench looking incredulously at him. In that moment, Sherlock was struck by the memory of their first meeting.
After three cups of coffee, a thirty-five-minute delay on the Underground, and four cases of bloody piles, the sun had finally fully risen. Its brilliant rays highlighted the bustle of the city outside the clinic windows.
Sherlock says this all without looking up from his book, but John correctly reads between the lines:
“You’re here,” he breathed in unconcealed wonder.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He had understood that John was not willing to play this game tonight, and he was annoyed.
Sherlock leaned against John’s arm, a long lithe line of warmth against John’s skin. It hadn’t been cold enough yet to wear his jacket.
After sliding his gloves on, Sherlock grasps John’s hand and leads him down Baker Street on foot.
"In fact, I've always believed you were...mine. My own personal miracle."
“You cock,” John said fondly as he squeezed past Sherlock into the hallway.
The headmaster’s secretary pages Rosie to the office, and offer Sherlock some tea while they wait. Sherlock, now partial to John’s particular tea-making prowess, politely refuses. Rosie is so deep in her own head as she enters the office that it takes her several moments to realize that Sherlock is standing there. When she notices, her face blanches and she begins to shake. Sherlock’s hands shoot out instinctively to catch and comfort, but Rosie twists away.
Why wasn’t John home yet? It usually took him twenty minutes to arrive at Baker Street after leaving work. Sometimes it could take up to twenty-five minutes if he popped in at Tesco.
By the time, John returns with the tea tray, Sherlock is midway through a reminiscence of one of his earliest cases. Mrs. Hudson loves to listen to Sherlock describe his work, but it is a rare indulgence. Though the detective is hardly humble, he considers the success of a case well-solved the highest praise and rarely has the patience for retelling cases that have already been solved. That is rightly John's domain.
Sherlock indulged himself with a quiet, “Mmm,” of agreement before looking away out the window. He knew that he was abysmal with reading the emotional needs of other people, but he’d have to be blind to miss the misery carving its presence into John’s muscles. He surreptitiously used the pane of glass in front of him to study John.
“Look at me, John. Really look at me. Do I look like I’ve just injected cocaine into my bloodstream? Are my pupils dilated? Is my heartrate elevated? Am I manic right now?” Sherlock looked caught, like he wanted to get up and pace, but he was afraid it would make him seem more excitable than he was.  “You’re a doctor, for gods sake! You should know the basic tells of someone who is high. I am displaying none of those symptoms.”
Sherlock unrolled his silverware and placed the linen napkin in his lap before folding his hands in front of him on the table. He remembered the rules, and it was too early in the evening to aggravate M. He hadn’t revealed his purpose in calling Sherlock here yet.
“Damn it! Blasted pan. Stupid egg. God forbid anyone else in this house ever soak the dishes. That would be too much to – “
“Admirable sentiment but not an answer to the question I asked. How did you come to be
It takes John several minutes to drain the tub and dress. Sherlock listens for the telltale sound of John’s footsteps on the stairs to his room, but none come.
John’s gaze was steady despite his obvious misgivings in starting the conversation. Several minutes passed, and Sherlock could not discern the true question.
Sherlock keens with despair, dragging Lestrade from his corner conversation. He looks on helplessly, trying to find anything to distract the detective.
“I’m surprised you bothered with a key at all. Since when do you do things the conventional way? Oh God, wait. You pickpocketed the owner, didn’t you?”
“After all that, you are the one who lifted us up. You inspired us, made us laugh again. You made us safe, and you make us better. You give all your love, unreservedly, without any expectation in return. You love deeper and harder than anyone I have ever known, and that is why Rosie always has been and will always be yours. Your love is written into her bones in a way that science will never comprehend. It is a fundamental part of who she is. I’m sorry that she said those things to you, and I am sorry I wasn’t there. But you have to know she didn’t mean them.”
The air in the room is so loud. Sherlock can hear it crackle and stretch between them. John's words reverberate around Sherlock's skull.
that signifies John hopping from foot to foot as he tries to get his trousers on and almost falls. All is silent for thirty seconds, and Sherlock is contemplating going upstairs to check on John when his phone pings.
. As much as Sherlock may claim otherwise, it was a choice. And Sherlock was not choosing John. He was not choosing them. He was not choosing their life, their career, Baker Street – he was not choosing all of it.
“You know,” he started slowly, “we could really use Sherlock’s help cutting through the clutter here.” Greg smiled grimly into his beer. “Don’t tell him I said so though.”
Sherlock’s hands are buried deep in his pockets, but he fiddles all the same. His shoulders hunch in and he seems to physically be recoiling in anticipation. John tries to make himself softer. He rounds his spine and pulls his shoulder down, shrinking The Captain back into a kind man in a fuzzy jumper. Sherlock stands in the decrepit foyer unable to do anything but love him. He breathes deeply and goes on.
As he followed John out of the cab, he pulled together what he considered to be the optimal facts – enough that John would be satisfied but not enough to chase him away. John could not know the whole truth. It would be their undoing,
Whoever said secrets cannot live in the sun was a goddamn idiot.
John lowers himself back down to rest his cheek against Sherlock’s chest.
“Alex Dumas, 22, was found in an abandoned boat garage yesterday afternoon. Preliminary toxicology shows no obvious cause of death. However, that could be due to the fact that the Yarders have not been able to recover the essential body parts to make such a determination. Anderson and his team are still identifying remains. Apparently, the corpse was rigged to explode should anyone attempt to open the garage. When Lestrade called they were still scrapping hair and skin off the ceiling. Dumas is the presumed victim given that their personal effects were found in the garage, but their identity is still unconfirmed.”
It frankly terrified him to realize that he had never before stopped to question whether he should. He’d placed his trust in John from the very start. It had been instinctual, like breathing.
While Sherlock showered, John went in search of a change of clothes. The clothes Sherlock had been wearing were stained through with the sweat of the fever that had not yet broke.
. I was so afraid to leave your room. I know it sounds stupid but I felt like if I stayed, you would have to stay too."
“I already had bio.”
"I hadn't seen you in weeks. Not properly. Not since…"
Absorbing the truth, Sherlock shatters and sobs into his knees. Mycroft places his arm around the detective and all the tension in his brother's body unravels. He sags sideways to lean against Mycroft's shoulder. He lets himself be comforted in a way he has not allowed in thirty years. Between sobs, he chokes out questions that not even Mycroft can answer.
understood, what he was about to say.
“And don’t you forget it.”
John sat at his desk and unlocked the top drawer to withdraw his mobile. He waited a few moments for it to power on. Maybe it really was time for an upgrade. Sherlock had offered several times recently, but John had refused. The phone was perfectly functional, and there was a comfort to its plodding reliability. It reminded John of times past when he’d had to wait for dial-up. Back then, he’d had enough time to fix tea and toast while his computer sputtered to life. His mobile was not quite that slow, and the lag suited him just fine. However, it probably was a hinderance in an emergency. Besides, he was fed up with the barrage of insults from Sherlock regarding the substandard qualities of his phone whenever he “borrowed” it. Just because Sherlock often forgot his own or was too lazy to go and retrieve it, did not give him the right to berate John’s choice. He sighed and made a mental note to research options later that night.
Anger flashed through him.
Now, Sherlock was the master of his transport. He could go long periods of time without succumbing to sleep or hunger. M would grow sick of this game before Sherlock was reduced to begging. A flicker of displeasure raced across M’s face, and he finished his salad in silence, motioning for his men to take the plates to the kitchen. Sherlock had not been allowed to touch his own salad.
“Nevermind,” John said hastily. “That was a stupid question. I don’t need to know
“That’s hardly fair to you, John,” Sherlock interrupted. “You like all those things, and I don’t know how much of it I can commit to giving you.”
“Sherlock, I don’t have your way with words. I say what I mean, and what I mean to say more than anything else…You are family. You have been from the very first moment. I have always chosen you, and you have always chosen us. Always. Even when that meant struggle. Even when that meant sacrifice. Even when it meant loss. You choose us every time. After Mary…”
“We can’t really spare the time,” he said in a whisper. “I know there’s only so much anyone can do with these things…” he gestured around the lab. “Even for Sherlock there are limits.”
"Sherlock."
Sherlock felt a moment of stabbing regret for what he was about to do, but it was necessary. He turned on the spot and walked swiftly in the other direction. John fought to follow him, but by the time he made it to the corner, Sherlock was gone.
“Sherlock?”
John was breathing heavily now, the panic rising. The ticking grew louder until he could hear nothing else. The paneling beneath him began to move. It felt as though the wall was swinging inward. He stumbled, trying to keep himself from collapsing to the ground.
At first, it was all just a jumble of meaningless noises joined together, but eventually the letters rearrange themselves into a comprehensible order.
“Won’t be necessary,” Sherlock replied, shrugging on his coat.
Sherlock looked intently at him, sizing him up. “Would you like to sit?” he asked, gesturing at the chair across the table. John planted his feet and crossed his arms. He wasn’t going anywhere until Sherlock explained.
“So, you do want to and it’s not a medical issue. That’s good to know, Sherlock. Thank you for telling me.”
"But you don't tend the herbs. Why?"
“John.”
John’s breathing was laboured with dread, though logically, he knew Sherlock had survived whatever foolhardy thing he’d done. It was still not easy to hear.
Only he wasn’t. He wasn’t naïve or young or helpless now. He’d rebuilt himself. The process had taken many years, but he’d done it. He’d gotten clean. He’d found a profession that welcomed his absurdities. He’d found a passable antidote to the poison running in his veins. He’d never be free of it, but he could contain it. He was containing it.
“Slinking around and watching me struggle. I should have known.”
John stares for a moment, dumbfounded. Sherlock starts to sweat and fidget. Maybe, that was not the right thing to say? He watches John warily, hoping he won’t leave. He’s clearly not well. Sherlock is sure he can do better.
John comes down the stairs five minutes later and is unsurprised to find Sherlock gone. He gulps down the rest of his tea, which has gone cold by now, and mutters about
When he looked up, John’s face nearly sent him to his knees. The dish towel sat next to the clean dishware, folded into pristine lines, but John was standing several paces away. His face was not angry or sad. It was resigned. There was an ancient weariness behind his eyes. He chewed his lip, and when he spoke there was little emotion behind it.
“You’ll want to know what happened,” he said in a flat, resigned voice.
[TEXT] Yeah actually. Much faster than I thought.
A flicker of movement off to the right had John moving before he registered the familiar build.
There was a low thrum of energy inside, but there were plenty of tables available. After quickly scanning the room and failing to spy Greg, John sat at a table near the bar. By the time John had grabbed drinks, Greg was sliding into his chair.
John breathes deeply and soldiers on.
, he thinks as Sherlock’s soft full lips crash against his own. Before he realizes it, his own hands are grasping Sherlock’s buttocks and pulling him closer. The warmth of the man seeps through John’s clothes and he can’t get enough. Sherlock’s arms still bracket his head. John pushes his advantage and winds his tongue down Sherlock’s jaw to nip along that glorious neck. One of John’s arms slides up Sherlock’s spine to wrap tenderly around the back of his neck. His fingers twine into the curls at Sherlock’s nape. John tastes salty sleep-sweat and syrup. Rosie must have had some on her face when she burrowed into Sherlock’s neck earlier. The earthy-sweet combination makes John groan and grip Sherlock’s head harder.
The line rang out several times before the call connected. John heard a scratching from the other side of the connection before Greg’ voice came through.
Sherlock felt his face heat under the intensity of M’s stare. The wine must be quite potent.
Sherlock’s jaw tightened at John’s mocking tone.
“Because there are three femurs in this picture.” John said it nonchalantly, laid it down as fact, but Lestrade still spluttered in disbelief.
Sherlock checked the sign hanging above the door, though he already knew what it said: Sebastian’s. He’d have to walk across that street in thirty seconds if he wanted to be on time. He hadn’t decided yet. He used these final moments to deduce what he could from the location.
“Richard James?” he asked.
“John,” Sherlock choked out before he wrapped John in his arms, pulling him in tightly. The man buried his face in John’s neck and breathed raggedly. It felt incredibly intimate to be held this way. John’s shirt grew damp with tears that went unremarked upon. He lifted his hand to run his fingers through his friend’s limp curls. The repetitive stroking and the hot humidity of the enclosed space overpowered Sherlock’s meticulous grooming habits, sending his hair into a sticky, steamy halo of frizz.
“Is this necessary? You are both going to die here. Why the theatrics?”
“Honestly, John. I don’t. As you know, Mycroft and I have been working on the Moriarty message that played during my pathetically-attempted exile.”
He crossed into the kitchen without waiting for a response, grabbed the now empty plates off the table, and put them in the sink. He gave himself a second of privacy to smile at the fact that the butty had vanished.
“Fuck you, Iain. He’s my glorious genius now.”
Sherlock felt more than saw John join him. He heard his sharp intake of breath when he saw Sherlock’s reddened skin, but he mercifully said nothing. After a brief pause, John stood at his side holding a dish towel.
Iain grins.
John tapers off into nonsense, but Sherlock seems to understand the general gist of the questions.
“Private?” John offered.
Let me know what you all thought. Kudos and Comments make the world go round (and my little heart flutter).
John knew he’d just stolen Sherlock’s thunder. The detective clattered noisily after him.
"I didn’t spend a lot of time at home after…"
John crosses the room, grasps Sherlock's arm reassuringly, and follows Mrs. Hudson into the kitchen to start the kettle.
His face was captured thanks to the security light fixed to the wall above the figure. The man was short with scruffy black hair and second-hand clothes. He was completely insignificant until John noticed the intense scrutiny of his beetle-black eyes. They belied a razor-sharp intelligence and hunger. The fierceness of his gaze gave him a lethal, powerful aura that the people around him must have felt. John had not noticed their apprehension before. Several heads were turned to watch the man and many people hunched closer to their groups, trying not to attract his attention. A father was pulling a young boy, about three years old, out of the man’s path.
Sherlock feels the burn of that phantom pleasure and squeezes harder as his hips buck into his fist. His free hand is clenched in his own hair, tugging randomly, just like John does. John, catching sight of Sherlock and realizing what he’s doing, smirks and buries his hands in Stephen’s hair, tugging. Stephen and Sherlock moan in unison, long and deep.
He has no idea where Sherlock is going with this, but he trusts the man.
His face crumpled beneath Sherlock’s touch.
John moves closer to wrap his arm around Sherlock’s waist. He leans into the detective’s warmth and is secretly pleased when Sherlock rests a possessive arm across his shoulders. As they walk through the streets of London, John is struck by how long it has truly been since they have done so. Just the two of them.
“What--?”
“I want you to fuck me.”
“I don’t know yet.”
Sherlock grabs a Rubik’s cube off the side table, just to have something to do with his hands. He twists the cube without looking. He’s not actually trying to solve it after all.
Mycroft gave him an appraising look. “Closer. At the beginning of their acquaintance, I believe Sherlock considered him to be a confidant of sorts. After a year, they began a romantic entanglement, and six months later, Sherlock left university. I lost track of them for several years afterward. When I found him again, Sherlock was...” Mycroft’s voice trembled with words unsaid. “By then, Sherlock was snared deep in Moriarty’s criminal web. He was not in control of himself and could not see a way out. I worried about the lengths he might go to in order to escape.”
“I have spent my life abhorring and dismissing the actions of
"They said that John will be in surgery for a while yet. Anyone want coffee?"
would keep his word to Sherlock despite all evidence to the contrary.
Sherlock spent the next few days reading and rereading the test results before he had to conclude that they had yielded little in the way of clues. The samples obtained from Colin Monahan were clearly modified from the generic Hypno that cropped up every now and then at drugs busts and crime scenes, but Sherlock had been unable to identify the unknown compounds thus far. With a growl of frustration, Sherlock tossed the file onto the floor and leaned his head against the back of his chair. He was too tall to be folded up into it this way, his torso scrunched and legs akimbo. His feet were tucked underneath him with his knees splayed wide so that he resembled a praying mantis waiting to pounce. He gazed up at the ceiling with a hopeless sort of apathy.
The trepidation is back in Sherlock's voice. It is the tone more than anything that makes John sit up and take notice. Sherlock is clearly anxious about whatever he is about to say.
“Um, hi,” John said dumbly.
“So that’s what this is all about. Getting me out of the way so you can run Jim’s empire?”
John’s voice is gentle, but Sherlock’s is barely a whisper.
"We're both naked," John giggles. "In the middle of our sitting room. Where Mrs. Hudson brings us tea in the morning."
He calls down the hall, hoping Sherlock can hear him over the shower. When no answer is forthcoming, he hurries down the corridor and slips the door open a sliver. Which is why he is surprised by a pale arm snaking through the gap and yanking him into the small room. John’s body is pressed nose to toes against Sherlock’s very hard, very naked form. The detective clearly hasn’t stepped into the shower yet, a small mercy for which John is grateful. He doesn’t have the time to change again and make it to work at a reasonable time.
He can hear Sherlock's weary sigh through the wood.
Sherlock breathes deeply and steeples his hands under his chin, fixing his intense stare on John.
Sherlock looks grim, and John is suddenly not sure he wants an answer anymore. He sinks into his own chair anxiously.
John’s tirade trickles off as he turns and spots Sherlock.
safe. Apparently, that is no longer the case. It is not yet clear what circumstances have changed to allow Moriarty to risk that which he was unwilling to risk before. Sherlock could likely tell us, but he is in no state to do so.”
“…spectrometer analysis as well. It will likely take several days to get the information, so if you could leave me alone and let me get started, that would be ideal.”
“We learned about reproduction! How a mum and a dad have a kid! I asked the teacher how two daddies have a daughter, and she laughed at me! It’s not possible! You lied to me! You’re not my real dad! You can’t be! It’s not
“And I want to suck you off while he fucks me.”
John came with a grunt and licked a wet stripe up Sherlock's neck. That's all it took. Sherlock was coming hard, soaking his pants, and cringing at himself. He'd just come in his pants like a bloody teenager.
The shy quirk of Sherlock’s lip when he returned to the sitting room put to rest any lingering embarrassment. He too had been missed.
"Are you coming out sometime tonight?"
The word is barely a croak. John bends closer just to hear it. Sherlock swallows several times, attempting to lubricate his throat without sufficient hydration to complete the task. Drawing a reusable water bottle out of his travel bag, John encourages Sherlock to drink. He sucks greedily and soon the bottle is empty, though it had enough water left in it to moisten Sherlock’s throat back to working order. Taking the empty bottle from the detective, John tucks it back into its compartment.
Sherlock is shaking, and he can’t stop. Control. He needs control. He needs to focus and take care of the situation. Mary hasn’t noticed John’s presence yet, but she will if Sherlock doesn’t keep her distracted. He can feel his heart racing and his breathing speeding up, but nothing is working to calm him.
“This building will be converted into temporary living accommodations. The entire first floor will be renovated and outfitted as a small clinic. The government wants to have a more comprehensive program for soldiers returning home.”
“Lestrade texted. We’re going to Bart’s,” he called over his shoulder. “You have fifteen minutes before I leave without you.”
Sherlock's shoes are specked with clay and dirt and blood. They leave residue on the linoleum. He is wearing a hole into the inside of the left shoe. His big toe has always distended slightly on that side.
He leaned back, creating space. “Unzip my trousers, Sherlock.” The detective hurried to comply. His body was no longer his own to control. His hands shook as he slid the little metal tab down and drew M’s cock out through the hole. The man shuddered at the feel of Sherlock’s long, lithe fingers around him.
“Well I’ll just...”
Rosie giggled and hugged Sherlock.
His voice is low and deadly. Lestrade's heart rate quickens, but he stands his ground.
M speared a gnocchi with his fork, dragged it through the cream, and offered it across the table. Sherlock leaned forward and took the pasta into his mouth, wrapping his lips around the metal tines and sucking the sauce.
John thought of all the pain that caring had brought him. He thought of Harry and the backlog of spiteful voicemails saved on his mobile that he couldn’t bring himself to erase. Despite the hateful words, each message was another piece of proof that Harry was still alive.
“She wasn’t mad…about that. Apparently, the first lesson of the term was on reproduction and the teacher had some
“Because, Mary, that is what you do for people you love.”
That was the cruel twist of being deemed M’s favorite. The man wasn’t satisfied to simply drug Sherlock and have his way. No. For him, M had concocted something special, something new. A neurochemical reaction that coded Sherlock’s sexual response to M’s DNA. When Sherlock had imbibed the drug, he hadn’t just been turned on by anything with a pulse. His body sought M’s and would burn itself down until he got it. He’d been marked by the spider.
"It was marked
"Well that was..." he fumbled for the right word to convey the jarring experience.
“Where are your manners, my lovely?”
“Sherlock?”
He tried to convey his displeasure at a human being categorized as convenient, but the admonishment seemed not to land. Probably the man was feigning ignorance. John could not bring himself to believe that someone as intelligent as Mycroft Holmes failed to grasp the implication behind his statement.
“I have a gangrenous foot I’ve been meaning to get to...”
A shadow passed over Mycroft’s face. “For his own protection.”
"You're welcome."
He races into the hallway and knocks on the door. Relief rushes through him as a tired but clear reply comes immediately.
“Can I help?” John asked, pushing the feeling aside. The work comes first, he reminded himself.
Exactly forty-three minutes later, a scowling Sherlock is standing on his doorstep. John knows he must be irritated that he's late. He smiles welcomingly and gestures quizzically toward the box in his hands.
Did he mean fictional thrillers/action adventures? Or romance? Or soulmates? All of the above? Sherlock couldn’t tell. He couldn’t make sense of the conversation, and he had a sense that John was hoarding some of the facts.
“And who might you be, ya pretty thing.”
There was a tightness in Sherlock’s chest at the tender look John was giving him. Suddenly, he wanted to tell John. He needed John to know.
It was a simple sentence, but the implication struck him hard. This was why John was indecipherable to him. He took simple comments, that would be cast-away thoughts from anyone else, and turned them into indisputable truths. His tone brooked no argument. His trust in Sherlock’s ability to find the answer and solve the case was unshakeable.
“I came because you are my friend, and you are unwell.”
“It’s rude to linger in the doorway, darling. I’ve told you a hundred times.”
“What, Sherlock? It’s easy. Either you agree, or you don’t.”
He waited breathlessly for Sherlock’s answer. They never talked about this – about sex. Not since that first night when everything had been tangled up in –
“Ok. Symptoms - fever, chills, lethargy, nausea. Got ‘em. What else?”
His eyes sprang open. His breath choked out of him. John sat still as a sentry, keeping watch while Sherlock struggled to control himself.
They took their time. John carefully finished shaving away the stubble covering Sherlock’s jaw. For once, there was no urgency to their actions.
John clutches the phone to his chest and feels a giggle bubbling up. He laughs aloud, startling a few honeybees that buzz in annoyance and fly away in the sunshine. He pulls himself back to sitting and starts to gather the trowel and rake lying nearby. He sets them back down and types out one last text before slipping the phone back into his pocket and heading inside to have a wash. Sherlock should be here in about forty minutes.
you know, right?” He looked for a glimmer of understand from Sherlock but saw none. “It’s enough that you know. Forget the rest.”
Sherlock finds himself crouched on the floor with his back against the wall. He puts his head between his knees and tries to tune out the football team of ten year-olds that just poured into the store. He ignores their comments as they yell and point at the weird man on the ground. He focuses on his breathing. Deep, cleansing breaths. Just the way his therapist taught him. The therapist he denied having. But he had needed someone when he returned. John had made it clear he would not be available.
"Re-assimilation has been…difficult."
before he hung up. With the progress on the Hypno case stalled, this could be just the distraction he needed. Whirling around in his haste, he’d slid into a freshly pressed pair of black trousers, a pristine white button-up, and his polished black oxfords. He had been sliding his mobile into his trouser pocket half-way to the door when it hit him.
He has done many dangerous things for John before. This is hardly the worst. Sherlock spends the next twenty minutes picking out the things he remembers John buying most often. Easy essentials that can be combined into quick, wholesome meals. He also is sure to grab John's hobnobs, crisps, and milk of course. He mutters it to himself the whole time he is in the store. He mustn't forget the milk. John is adamant about milk in his tea.
“I love John.”
- blue. Assuming that he wasn’t going to get an answer, he folded the dishtowel in his hands and turned back to the sink.
“It will be formally connected to the RAMC so it’s funding will come from them. The clinic will be staffed by active duty corpsmen. However, they wanted someone outside of the active military life in charge. They wanted someone who had no possibility of being reassigned or moved. It was pointed out that consistency and dedication to treatment and rehabilitation were crucial to the success of the endeavor.”
Finally, he put down the butter knife with visible regret and reached a hand out toward the detective.
. It really wasn't that hard a leap."
He was used to folding away his fractured, fragile edges. He kept them well out of sight. But Sherlock had always seen them, no matter how hard John tried to keep them obscured. He had gotten used to his flatmate pulling his deepest secrets to the surface to examine them in the harsh light of day. It hardly bothered him anymore. John assumed that was why Sherlock’s face hovering mere inches away from his scar caused him no more than a single skipped heartbeat of nervousness. Sucking in a breath, John dispelled the anxiety entirely.
“Please lie down. When you’ve got your strength back, you can plot 100 ways to get revenge on your brother, and I promise to help, alright?”
Mycroft raised his hands in surrender. “I know, but Moriarty did not see him that way. To him, Sherlock was a unique object of priceless value. An object that belonged to him.”
John rolls his eyes fondly.
Sherlock looks earnestly at John, willing him to understand. John’s not sure he fully does, but he nods encouragingly.
John turns to look at him.
“Bit mean doing it like this, I know. Somehow it feels like closure, so I hope you’ll forgive me.”
Sherlock gripped his hand tightly as he explained.
Anyway, I am sorry for disturbing you. I’ll just…”
John’s reply caught him by surprise. Sherlock’s head whipped up, and he stared. His voice was low with emotion when he responded.
John’s hand stole around Sherlock’s neck and pulled the man to him for a quick peck on the lips. With Sherlock seated, John had the unusual pleasure of leaning down to capture his kiss.
He couldn’t just keep standing here. He had to get out. Sherlock cloaked himself in the grey woolen protection of the Belstaff. He blanked his face into an inscrutable mask and his posture screamed untouchable. There was an undercurrent surrounding him, as if the very air around him were a live wire. Sherlock slid his leather gloves onto his hands. It was absurd! He knew it was. It wasn’t even cold out, but Sherlock needed his armor, needed to be covered up to his neck.
“I wasn’t sure what you had in mind so I’ve gone with dressy casual. Hope your plans don’t call for a three piece, mine’s at the cleaners.”
(See the end of the chapter for
on the scientific impossibility of same sex parents.”
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand lightly, just once, then drew his hand back to his own side of the table.
“Listen, this is clearly a sensitive topic that you don’t particularly want to discuss. I can respect that, but I do hope that you’ll tell me one day. I trust you to clue me in to what I need to know when I need to know it. As for the rest of it, we’ll just have to figure it out together, alright?”
John nips harder, startling a gasp out of the gorgeous man falling apart beneath him.
"I didn’t know, John."
“That’s the trick. You need more forceful handling. Don’t you, Stephen?”
“John Watson really is the best thing that ever happened to you. You have changed so much, yet you’re still the same old Sherlock. I appreciate your discretion, but it’s not necessary. I truly have moved on. Greg and I are really very happy, and I expect he’ll make a proper woman out of me quite soon. I have known you and John a long time. Please let me help?”
“I’m getting all pruney.”
“Did something happen?”
“Are you going to invite me in, or are we going to stand here in the entryway all day?”
Their salads were replaced with equal servings of pasta in decadently rich cream sauce. M leaned back in his chair and swirled his wine around its glass.
His eyes flicked quickly across the array of screens, trying to find a frame of reference for his eventual journey back through the winding labyrinthian house. He saw a palatial dining room complete with crystal chandelier, an indoor pool that must be full Olympic-sized, and a glass conservatory filled with lush green vegetation he was fairly certain could never be native to the cold, rocky isle that was Britain.
The doctor drones on about the particulars - gunshot wound, hypotension, collapsed lung,
. And he lets John see. It's breath-taking.
“Hilarious, John,” he said dryly when he reached the entryway. But a smile was playing around the corners of his mouth and he looked at John with immense fondness. John nodded and gestured toward the door.
"At my…at my grave."
Sherlock's breath stutters on a gasp as he tries to force a deep breath into his lungs. A choked whimper escapes his throat and he tightens his fists in aggravation.
John’s stomach plummeted as he considered the desperation Sherlock must have felt standing on the edge of the roof of that building. What must be nipping at your heels to make you step into the air and take the plunge rather than step back onto solid ground?
