Actually, the bailiff has already been to check on them once – a standard procedure when it comes to newly converted slaves. Sherlock was silent, stared at the floor and and behaved; John spoke to the official civilly and even poured her tea. All things considered they passed the check-up well.
John practically jumps, turns around and sighs with an obvious relief. As if there's anyone else in the flat. Er, no. John peeked into Sherlock's room three times while he slept. Worried about his health. Or perhaps he was just checking if he was breathing.
“I’ve seen stranger things,” Greg insists stubbornly. “I wouldn’t have believed that John could… But you know, the situation… Especially when… you know, with relationships…. And Sherlock - he’s…”
She snorts. “You must be cosmically lucky not to be beaten with that tongue on you. It's my brother, Mr Holmes.”
Although Sherlock doesn't consider himself to be particularly experienced in displaying sincere feelings, he too leans forward, opens up, presses against John, holds on to his shoulders.
“I was brought out of coma this morning. They started to last night already, while rescuing me from the clinic. I was transported to Switzerland in a roundabout way which right now is of no importance. I am here first to recuperate, second to gather information, and third to strategize. As you can see, I am dealing with it all simultaneously and as efficiently and quickly as the circumstances allow. You, Detective Inspector, are a part of the second and the third stage of my agenda.”
This is the moment where everything in Sherlock's mind slots into place. What he's been trying to forget about the hospital: the colour of the carpet under his knees, the polite and competent nurse, taking the tubes out of Mycroft's throat... Now the Baker Street flat is falling away, he's looking at the ancient city as if from the stratosphere, down at the bizarre loops of the Thames like a thin thread woven between the city blocks, and at the web... the still existing web that's pulling everything into its centre.
Judging by the calm expression on John's face, these words don't appear to hold any revelatory value. “And where is the novelty in that? It seems to me that everything is exactly as it was before.”
That's how they find themselves on a park bench in Christchurch Gardens. To be more specific – Greg is sitting and Sherlock is standing next to him, frozen, nervously fingering his collar.
“Payment will not be necessary.” Sherlock gestures the concern away. “But don’t expect quick results. In a week maybe. When I don’t have any other pressing matters.”
In the end John has to deal with the shirt himself, but there are no broken ribs, and nothing more serious than some bruises, a couple of bumps and a skinned knee. No concussion either, thankfully.
“I don't want to view it in any light,” he growls. “Sodding hell, Sherlock, it's not a laughing matter, do you understand? You are everything I've got, but I don't own you. I don't want to own you!”
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, his fingers steepled under his chin, his head thrown back and his legs stretched out in front of him. The pose contains so much hidden strength, nervous energy and, at the same time, adolescent vulnerability that John feels his heart constrict. It tends to keep happening lately, this involuntary movement of his heart muscles, when he looks at Sherlock. John tries to fight the tendency since this is one of the reasons why Sherlock accused him of hypocrisy. Besides, heart problems in his situation are rather superfluous. What would happen to Sherlock if he...
Having applied the same methods as with the Chinese restaurants, Sherlock finds a suitable place in central London. Although it's a small clinic and not in the busiest street (residential area, ethnic district - rent must be cheaper), it's also a respectable place and the clientèle is quite diverse, including not entirely legal immigrants and seasonal workers. The place is owned by a woman of Indian descent who studied in England. Lives and works legally, but has a soft spot for charity cases and especially immigrants from her homeland, which is the reason she's not better off, although on the whole she's not doing too bad. In short, she's one of those people you'd call 'a good person' and 'a pillar of the crown'.
“I honestly can’t tell if your saying this to me because you want me to stop you or if you’re really just that far gone.”
“J-John?” he asks. Who else would it be? No one has ever shared a bed with him before. He doubts anyone ever will again. Not after John decides it is time to leave it.
“Right.” John shakes his hands a little. “Right.”  he sits back, running a hand over his face. “Right.” he sighs out, again.
“I was...” he admitted, a bit sheepishly, before biting his lower lip, eyes lighting up with excitement, “But then it started
“Yeah, kind of figured that when you told me women weren’t your area and that you didn’t have a boyfriend.”
“And I’d like to feed you up. Put some meat on that skinny arse of yours.” he’s smiling now, and it looks less painful.
Sherlock can hear further footsteps, heading towards the bedroom from the hall. They are calculated, aggressive stomps of feet.
“Yes, I know it’s fine!” Sherlock snaps. Instantly regrets it. He sighs. “What I mean to say is. Well, um. What I mean to say--or ask, rather--is that… “ Sherlock lets out a angry breath, and is beyond frustrated at the way his hands have begun to shake. “It’s one thing being fine with your flatmate being into blokes. It’s another spooning up against him every night. Hugging him from behind. That sort of thing.”
“It’s just I'm,” he bites his lips, gives Sherlock a searching look. “I’m kind of terrified with how you might respond.”
Sherlock suppresses a shudder at the feel of his hand sliding into John’s. John’s hand is warm, very warm, and soft. Not as soft as Sherlock’s, but it’s not as if he went around noticing the softness of his own skin constantly. And John's hand is nice and dry as well. Which makes Sherlock feel all the more embarrassed at his own cold and clammy one.
Sherlock has no answer to that. Because of course John had initiated the embrace. But Sherlock was still at such a loss as to whether this situation was one on a strictly platonic level, or if they were delving into something...deeper. More… Well, Sherlock
“No, nothing pressing I’m afraid. I thought that I’d stop off and check on you. The flat is dreadfully boring seeing as how John is still asleep.”
“Oh my lord! Come in! Come in please!” She moved out of the way, only pausing to give the two wet kisses on their cheeks. She shut the door and escorted them to the living area. They took their seats and she gaped at the sight of them.
Sherlock’s heart stopped beating altogether. There was a rip in John’s shirt, a rip right on top of the stitches Sherlock spent days sewing on John’s body.
“And what of this poor bloke? Are we to just hand him over to Moriarty without a care in the world?”
. He was glad that Sherlock finally revealed to him his true nature, and he bore no ill will towards him, his lover, his creator. There had to be the twinge of uneasiness in Sherlock during this process if he did not even want to share with John the tale of how he came to be. He had no father, he had no mother, nor had he a brother as Sherlock was blessed to have, he was able to accept these facts. Why should they bring another being into this life? He would wake and be handed off to Moriarty who would do God knows what with him. Did Sherlock truly have no issue with giving this creature….this person, a life of servitude with no hope for escape?
They all chanted it as they attacked him in front of his own home. The pain was beginning to be unbearable, and he was slowly losing consciousness. The taunts and the jeers suddenly turned into screams of pain. Sherlock opened his eyes, he could scarcely believe it, John pushed his current attacker off of him and returned the swings to the man’s face. The others who cornered him were groaning on the floor except for two of them who stood up and attempted to remove John from the man he was assaulting.
“Your kisses will not sway my mind, Sherlock. You and I agreed upon slumbering together. Therefore, if I should retire, so should you, and the same of me with you.”
A part of him knew such words were foolish. John had made it clear time and again that he loved him, that he would stay, and Sherlock still could not believe him. Some days it was easier to accept his affection and even reciprocate, but when it came to moments of gravity such as this, self doubt won over rationality.
When they were both inside of the carriage, the driver immediately set off and John stared out the window forlornly at the sight of his dear Baker Street growing smaller and smaller behind them. It would be cold and empty, and for what reason John had not a clue. Sherlock grabbed his hand, and though both men wore gloves, the intimacy was there. Sherlock offered a smile and John returned it.
His head whipped back and forth as he searched for any signs of John. He thought he heard his name being returned, but dismissed the phantom call. He ran into the room to the right and found nothing but emptiness. He ran to the room on the left and that’s where he found him. He was tied up to a chair in the middle of the damp room, unconscious and bleeding. In a moment’s notice, Sherlock was in front of John’s chair,  freeing him from his bonds.
Sebastian smiled and moved back on the seat, John couldn’t help but stare at the two other men in the carriage and think about their survival that day, and the sacrifice of one Thomas Banville.
The station was only a few feet away from them, yet Sherlock did not want to remain a moment longer.
“I did no such thing. My anger was directed towards myself and I could not handle the failure that was my life.”
Also, this chapter is mostly smut but we've constructed it so that if that's not your thing, you can skip it without really missing much. There will be one more chapter after this. We're almost there!
He finished with the arm and marveled at the sight in front of him. His eyes wandered from the scar to the legs. Sherlock did not realize until now that the man he took the legs from was no more than five feet and some inches. He wanted to be upset with himself for making such silly mistake, but he could not bring himself to do it. His hand splayed across the torso of his companion. The abdomen was not as trim and lean as Sherlock’s own was, which was rightly so as Sherlock maintained his shape in the poorest of manners. Sherlock’s hand squeezed the pudge of flesh that was the gut. His gaze trailed down to the lower part of the man’s body. Sherlock always tried to ignore its presence, even whilst he pieced the body together, he did not stare for long. His companion was certainly well-endowed,  an observation that stirred up the slightest hint of envy. Sherlock fought the urge to touch the man’s penis to satisfy the ever-present curiosity he felt as he worked. Half of it was covered by pubic hair and Sherlock had half a mind to cut it off so that he may get the whole picture. He shook his head. Vulgar thoughts, such inappropriate thoughts he had.
“He is of short stature, about five foot and six inches in height. Not quite heavy but robust in size, broad-shoulders, slight curve of the stomach, strong legs, long feet. Narrow-hips…”
John himself seemed unsure of where to proceed. It was as if the man had not flung Sherlock across the room moments ago. The man detached his hand and moved back from them. Sherlock moved from behind his protector and stepped towards him.
Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest, body going taut. It was always a strange feeling in the beginning but as John moved his finger in farther, Sherlock could only want more.
Huuugee thank you to my co-author and beta writer for helping me with the chapter and for the amazing ending as well!
Sherlock had half a mind to start a fight but he could not help the smile at the comment and finally, with the work of John’s rhythmic breathing, lulled himself to sleep.
Sherlock pulled away first, panting deeply as his breath had been taken by John. His lips were swollen from the crushing kiss and the cut at the corner throbbed but with a pain he could ignore. John had never kissed anyone before, how he become so skilled?
Sherlock knew that John wanted to see and so did he. Through the intense sensations, Sherlock forced himself to open his eyes and meet John’s, bare his emotions in the most intimate connection.
John stared at Sherlock with a blank expression, which then gave way to a small smile and a nod. Sebastian hugged them both again and made a hasty exit from the inn. John shut the door and sank to the bed looking as tired as ever. “He said Moriarty left him all by his lonesome. He is not a person to be left in isolation, Sherlock. He needs to be around people….he does not know how to be alone…”
''Thank you. Doctor Watson, if you'd sign this form, please.'' She handed him a short term contract detailing his agreement to donate blood for six months time, barring any serious injury or illness.  He scrawled a rough signature in the bottom corner without reading it and handed it back.
''Nothing. Just wanted to know what you saw. I've got enough for now.'' He stood, his coat sweeping through the slurry of ashes, uncaring for the fine material. John followed more slowly, pausing to rip his protective wear off and drop it into the hazard bags by the door. By the time he'd got his coat back on and looked up, Sherlock was nowhere to be found.
''There's not many people smart enough- and with the resources to do this. And the person who does- well- necks are the best place to feed. And he has a vested interest in covering up the murder of a donor.''
''You'll get used to that feeling- it'll get better as the skin gets thinner... Right.'' She reached into her jacket pocket, pulling out a tiny packet of antibacterial wipes and wiping the bite mark clean. As the endorphins of Sherlock's saliva began to fade from his system, he began to sober up, wincing at the sting of the disinfectant. He propped himself up on the thin pillows.
''I'm sure they will. Insulting them isn't going to help, though, is it? I'll find you a space and you can write up what you know and Lestrade can make sure it gets to the right people
She met him at the door, black skirt and white shirt hiding her body from his gaze once more. She handed him the briefcase for the day and a flask of tea for the journey and opened the door for him to lead the way to the car.
After explaining the job to the doctor, Anthea let him alone. He seemed sceptical, but was growing more and more open to the idea as he took in the clear benefits and the chances the position would offer him. She nodded once in a silent greeting to Sherlock, waiting in an alcove, as she left the office, and he quickly slipped through the door as it shut behind her. She returned to the car to wait for the verdict.
''Boys. Please stop arguing. I didn't know you were engaged.'' John stepped between the bickering brothers to talk to Anthea.
''That's enough, Donovan. If you walk back to the main road you can get a taxi from there, Doctor Watson. Donovan, we're done here, go home.'' Detective Inspector Lestrade rubbed at his temples like a headache was forming- a common response to Sherlock's presence at a crime scene.
She unfolded the cheque from the night before, holding it so that Sherlock could clearly see the ridiculously large amount over her shoulder before folding it back up. Mycroft raised a single eyebrow at his brother, interrupting the silent conversation he was trying to have with a very confused Dr Watson.
''You could always just text, brother mine.'' His haughty tone contrasted sharply with the acres of smooth pale skin on show. Next to him, John shook his head and spread the sheet out, trying to cover Sherlock's waist. Ignorant of his partner's blushes, Sherlock stood up and glanced absently  around the room. Anthea hooked the dressing gown off the back of the door and held it open for him. He barely glanced at her as he shrugged it on and tied the belt. He led the way out of the room, brushing shoulders with his brother as he passed through the narrow doorway.
''Um. Yeah? You're Sherlock Holmes- I recognise you- from your website.'' As soon as the website was mentioned Sherlock stopped in his tracks and pulled himself up to his full height. His eyes grew brighter and more focussed as he concentrated on the face of the man in front of him. The slight sneer that had marred his features cleared up and he became almost bashful- a new expression for the usually self assured detective.
The movers had arranged everything how she had instructed them, used to her ways by now. She wandered through the rooms, moving things slightly, changing certain decorations or arrangements, familiarising herself with the layout, the windows, the doors. The movers had left a note with a photograph- the word 'Feeder' in blood red letters across the front door of her old home. They'd set the security team to check cctv and find the culprit. Anthea decided to leave them to it, not really caring who they found- it'd be some small minded teenager thinking they were brave.
They managed to push pass the throng of Christmas shoppers and through the entrance to the shopping mall. Sherlock immediately zeroed in on the Santa village they had set up.
Sherlock looks up from John’s laptop, to where John is holding a hand out, apparently for Sherlock to take.
“Why must it always be what I want!” Sherlock snaps again. “Why can’t you take any responsibility for this!” Sherlock has the urge to round on John, confront him directly, face to face. But he quells that urge, knowing it would just be too overstimulating. Would cause Sherlock to flee before this conversation, or whatever it was they were having, had reached its natural end.
''Oh, I know all about that- if they'd just keep it to their bedroom it would be alright, but of course you know Sherlock- always inappropriate if he can be.'' She sounded fond, knowing, and continued to mutter to herself about boys in love as she walked back towards her kitchen door.
''Not yet. Now that I think about it, I might have lost it before we came here. Come, John, we have places to be. Such a surprise seeing you here. Do try not to break his heart. He's already at risk of heart attacks due to his lack of control over his diet.'' He led the way out of the room, stepping around Anthea with a quick glance.
Taking a moment to move the debris of scientific equipment and random articles of clothing from his bed, he turned down the duvet and top sheet and crawled gracelessly across it, leaving room for John to sit down. Sherlock shuffled around a little on the Egyptian cotton sheets, biting at his thumb slightly to begin the flow of the numbing chemicals that would allow John to feel as little pain as possible.
''Leaves. It's like he forgets you exist. You're not nearly as important to Sherlock Holmes as you think you are. No-one is. He doesn't do relationships. Or friends. So whatever you think you are, you're not. He doesn't work like that. There was this one girl- some young, pretty thing. Thought he loved her. Then a week later, he's alone again. They never last long. You'll be gone soon too.'' She looked him up and down and sneered. ''Do you even have the money for a taxi?''
She sent a quick text to John Watson, warning him of backlash from anti-vampers. He text back minutes later.
''He likes to wait and tell us everything all at once. Thinks it makes him seem smarter. Freak.'' Sergeant Donovan's voice was arch, sneering at the pair crouching among the ashes.
''And doctor Watson. You'll stay?'' Mycroft turned pointedly towards the smaller man, addressing him directly to remind him that there were in fact other people in the room.
The computer screen was split, one side showing live cctv footage from tens of places all over the city, one side scrolling text almost too fast to read. Anthea was concentrating on the text, correcting errors, changing dates, names, ages. The video feeds were almost ignored- until her computer flagged up a recognised face on one of the screens, flashing red around  the outline of the image.
''I'm just tired. Did you enjoy dinner?'' He placed his glass carefully on the end table, the pale liquid almost gone. ''I thought the pastry on your tart looked a little thick.''
Anthea woke early the next morning, tying her dressing gown belt firmly as she walked down the stairs. Even before she reached the newspapers on the mat she could tell it wasnt good news. The cover photo was dark, only the fanged teeth visible in the shadows beneath red drips of blood. She picked the stack of papers up, flicking through them to glance at the covers of each.
He was still shaking, curled up in a ball on the bed, a blanket draped over him loosely, clearly Sherlock's inept attempt at stopping the shakes. As he heard her steps on the threadbare carpet and the creak of the floorboards beneath he tried to sit up, swaying slightly. She took a quick step into the room to grab his upper arms and steady him.
Anthea always arrived at Mycroft's offices at precisely 6.55, in order to be ready for her boss's arrival at 7. He walked through the door exactly on time as she expected, and as she fell into step behind him, they set off through the halls leading to his office, and he began to list what he wanted from her that day.
John saw the signs of overload, signs he'd come to recognise in only a few weeks- hands curled in white knuckled fists, hair ruffled where Sherlock had been running his fingers through the curls, coat tightly buttoned, shutting out the world. John sighed, look around at the chaos of the office and wrapped his arms tightly around his partner, trapping the taller man's arms at his side. Sherlock fought the hug for a second before relaxing into the embrace slumping against John's shoulder. John slowly stepped back, pulling down Sherlock's arms to hold his hands tightly.
and that everything gets checked. Come on, I'm sure there's an empty desk out here- ta, Greg, I'll get his report to you by this afternoon.''
The official clucks his tongue approvingly. “A very good model. We have the same brand; ten years and no problems.”
While mulling over the advantages of their living arrangement – even in their disgusting new circumstances, which John had no idea how long Sherlock might yet tolerate (don't think about it, don't get distracted!) – he somehow pulls through the shift. His anxiety about Sherlock doesn't let up – what’s he doing, is he sitting at home or has he dashed off somewhere?
“Later!” Sherlock growls and practically pushes John out of the door, throwing his jacket after him. “Take a walk, I need to think – our lives depend on it. And get some nicotine patches!”
“It’s a phenomenal feeling,” John continues. “A weight off my shoulders, a load off my mind. It’s as if it was my neck that the collar was removed from.” He even unconsciously rubs his neck.
Staring at the carpeting on the floor, Sherlock remembers why Mycroft was crying: he'd dropped father's globe, an antique, the wood had cracked and as a punishment he'd been forbidden to go outside for a week. It had seemed unbearable to him to sit in the house in such sunny summer weather, just at the beginning of the holidays.
“Too bad,” Morstan says simply. “But you do understand that I'm going to squeeze every last drop out of you?”
“Money's not a problem. Never has been. There's a countless number of quite legal and unbearably boring ways to acquire any sum of cash one could wish. It seems that our current circumstances are forcing me to put some effort into it.”
“Through and through!” Sherlock pulls at the collar on his neck, experiencing the pain with an inexplicable satisfaction.
During the night John wakes up because Sherlock is muttering. The muttering bursts into his own dream in the form of the roar of a capricious Land Rover engine (which all kinds of people take turns digging around in, all except for the actual mechanic who'd given up in the second week and is now filling out complaint forms and requests for the novelty to be replaced by something older, even if it runs on kerosene or oil, but is trustworthy). In the dream, Sergeant Willis is smiling and Corporal Andrews is coming towards them (two out of the bunch of people puttering around in the car's innards), waving around with a bundle of letters.
By this time John already knows the doctor's family history, about her brother who's now apparently a eunuch at the same harem he was originally sold to. It appears that Sherlock asked an old acquaintance from India to convince the eunuch to write a letter to his sister. The acquaitance’s letter arrived before the eunuch's: the first one relayed that the poor man seemed quite happy with his fate, tasting the usual plentiful fruit of the harem's wealth and even expressed pity towards his sister who has to earn her living with hard work.
“In the light of the circumstances surrounding the current case and according to the Individual Rights Convention of 1894, Act of Violent Conduct 1956, Act on Fraud 1945, and the case of Manchester City Council v Canes 1979, the defendant Sherlock Holmes is found guilty on all grounds and is sentenced...”
“No.” Sherlock cuts him off. “I suggest you take your pills. Half the usual dose; you're tired enough for that, and tomorrow I'll need you at your best.”
He has to keep calm, not to give too much away, try not to argue. Bid his time. If there's a slightest chance... Maybe Sherlock is somewhere here too?
“There's a municipal hole for the likes of...” Sherlock hears Pound saying. The end of the sentence is cut off by the massive door.
“Why in Clapton?” Sherlock asks with surprise. “Or… if they got him in… Yes, Clapton is quite possible, Probable even. How did you know?”
“I don't speak English,” his guest says in a strong German accent. “Follow me. The password is Sally Donovan's knees.”
Sherlock is watching John's hands closely so he sees very clearly how the package with the humiliating device is taken out of the sports bag on the doctor's hip. Leather and plastic. The lightest model, relatively expensive, but not a luxury item. Sensible and level-headed choice. Very much like John. A metal tag. “Property of John H. Watson” and a Baker Street phone number. Which means he ordered it yesterday at the latest and paid for an urgent commission. Where did he get the funds? If Mycroft had been... able, Sherlock would have suspected his involvement. Sherlock's own accounts are arrested. John has always worked miracles with his pension, but everything has a limit.
That's where Sherlock almost loses it. Almost. But he does manage to stay calm and maintain his icy demeanour. Then though, for some reason he rises, covers the distance to the sink in few steps, and ignoring John's indignant shout, pulls the stupid plate in a blue flower pattern from his hands to throw it into the farthest wall. The plate flies through the whole flat and shatters near the creepy yellow smiling stick-man face.
Why indeed. Right now, suffering from pain, fear, anger and all the senseless blur hazing up his mind, Greg's pretty sure that the reason is his spectacular stupidity. He should have refused. He was going to. That would have been a sensible, rational thing to do: he has a wife and kids, almost a flawless record. Why the hell would he dive into that bloody shit hole? And then he thought: what am I – a coward? For twenty years he hadn't cowered before his superiors nor criminals so why would he start now?
Gregory Lestrade's head is made of lead, his eye sockets of fire itself. His arms and legs feel like having been buried in snow up to elbows and knees. With some effort and a groan he manages to get upright. Nevertheless, some leaning his back to the white bed covers is necessary while he thoughtlessly stares at the wall opposite. What a fascinating pattern that wallpaper has, damn it... Every half an hour or so, a new thought forms in his consciousness.
John swallows and proceeds to rub his face with both hands. Everything blurs around him, the air swirls; nothing has any meaning any more and the refuge they had built together is crumbling down around them.
There he does everything through a foggy film of unreality: demonstrates the collar, pays the fine. It seems surreal that Sherlock is indeed waiting for him here, alive and well. Or moderately well, because 'satisfactory condition' probably means that all his limbs are attached at least.
John grunts and looks away. “I'd say that it's a horrific idea, potentially dangerous to our relationship and unhealthy all around.”
“What's the point of coming to my bed clothed, you imbecile?” Sherlock mutters, sucking at John's neck. Considering how often John rubs it, Sherlock has the fairly sound theory that he has an erogenous zone there.
’ (he does touch upon the topic in his last collection, which was published shortly before his death). However, some of the recent studies published have put their contribution under doubt. [JMorstan: either name works or cut it. I’d cut it.] I have to admit the revisionists have a point: any written source can be falsified, evidence can be contradictory and eyewitnesses are hard to come by so long after the fact. [JMorstan: Don’t put words into their mouths, they’ll chew you out. :(( Better quote something from Wilson.] Still, the current article has another purpose: It is to show how ridiculous it is to doubt the Baker Street duo’s role in the abolitionist movement is to those of us who actually were personally acquainted with them. [JMorstan: The ‘duo’ is just too funny! :) If I remember correctly DrW played clarinet?]
Yes. This is the only way. You have no other refuge besides my lips and my hands. I have nothing but your body in my arms.
On the one hand, it is not difficult to remember those few happy moments in his childhood that he associates with Christmas (Mycroft being back from school, sometimes with friends, the new books he brought along, stories, and the opportunities for playing tricks that only needed an accomplice). On the other hand, everything that happened afterwards in no way invites sentimental reminiscence.
Beside the bed, in a low and obviously uncomfortable armchair is sitting, wrapped into a grey bleak blanket, a gloomy and rather dishevelled figure of Mycroft Holmes himself. Sitting. By himself. And he must have been talking too not a minute ago.
John has always hated to wake him up. He is convinced that Sherlock sleeps too little as it is, but before this all happened, he'd at least come in, straighten the blanket, perhaps take his pulse and mutter something like, “can never get him to bed, and then he hibernates”. For some reason John loves these small signs of attention. Lost his mother early? A cold distant father? Could be either. This morning John restrains himself.
He's almost swaying on his feet. As bad as that slaves don't look even on the leaflets the Department of Propaganda sometimes confiscates from The Movement. The casual clothes (ordinary, but strange on him – a hoodie, t-shirt and jeans) are loose on him as if on a coat hanger.
Sherlock swallowed hard. He didn’t want John to see how his eyes watered at the way he was being spoken to by the one person who had never talked to him like that. Only a few hours ago, John held so much love, so much regard towards Sherlock, and now...it was as if John could barely stand to look at him. Sherlock clenched his hands together, wanted to make sure that he could keep the urge to cry at bay. This story would take an eternity to tell if Sherlock were to break down now.
Sherlock shut his journal only to sweep it off the table in a fit of agony and helpless despair. After months of toiling away he was left alone with the bare and shameful truth of his weakness, his gross need for affection. Out of all the foolish things he had ever done, were Mycroft still alive, this moment would bring about the height of his brother’s derision.
“You can have me, John. I have belonged to you since the day you took your first breath and I will belong to you as long as we live. Maybe even longer. If anyone hears of our story in the years after we pass, they too will see how I have always been yours.” He knew his eyes were pools of black with his arousal - just like John’s - but the sincerity was still clear.
Sherlock moved to touch his face. He was cold with no hint of blood rushing to his face. He had been sure that the electricity would be enough to shock the heart into starting. Would they need to do it again? Sherlock would have to wet him with water in order for it to work this time. Unless…
He smiled at Sherlock, even when he knew that John was cross with him. He offered to help Sherlock when it was clear that he was in need of it. He enjoyed spending time with him, he was unabashedly in love with John and to sit here and watch him sink deeper and deeper in despair because of him was something that was worse than any pain that could be inflicted on his person.
John blushed and immediately moved toward the two accompanying bowls of mashed potatoes and vegetables. Sherlock placed a hand on top of John’s.
John frowned at how sad Sherlock sounded to admit such a thing. Sherlock could not stand to look John in the eyes. He thought he was the reason for Sherlock’s unhappiness, as if Sherlock had not harbored such self-deprecation for years, as if Mycroft did not contribute to the self-hatred. John was innocent in this, his only crime was being created. John’s love for him surpassed any other love that he knew, perhaps that was because this was the only love that Sherlock knew. John was everything he could ask for and more. He treated Sherlock with such kindness, which he was unaccustomed to. John treated Sherlock as is according for a human being.
“This is no good at all, the horses cannot travel in these conditions! I shall have to postpone the meeting, how delightful.”
John shook his head at Sebastian. He knew that the man’s heart was soft, he did not know how to handle the evils of this world, and John was sorry for that. There was not enough time to harden him or instill a confidence to combat such cruel words. Sebastian’s blue eyes glanced to John, and for a moment the shorter man worried that he had lost his nerve. No, no it was quite the opposite.
Sherlock blinked. John stared at him with concerned eyes, he had drifted off again, forgetting where he was. He rose from his chair and grabbed the plate in the process. John stared as Sherlock walked into the kitchen and begun the task of washing the dishes. While they dined on one plate, Sherlock had forgotten to wash the plates and cups from the previous night. He groaned at the sight of the full sink but it had to be done and Sherlock had to be the one to do it.
“You see, years ago, a boy was murdered. As you might have guessed, this child went by the name of Carlton Powers. He...drowned, and many suspected it was an accident. A clumsy child who veered too close to the lake’s edge…”
Sherlock huffed and then moved to close the book, but then he was stopped by his creation placing his hand on the page. Sherlock held his breath. Was this it? Had he finally chosen a name? Sherlock wished that it was so. He opened the book to where the man’s hand was and searched for the name again. Sherlock smiled, and then looked into those blue eyes.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He did want to talk to John but rather the opposite. He wanted to have John tell him of his observations while they traveled. He wanted the carriage to fill with the sound of John’s voice and only his. Sherlock knew he could be nasty sometimes, his mouth getting the better of him and spewing hurtful things to anyone that tried to help him. This was why he was always left alone, and why he always turned to the syringe filled with the one substance that could make the days bearable. How many times did he tell himself that he would give the world one more day to make him feel as if he belonged? How many times did the world show him that it was no home for him? All those hours wasted atop the manor, just waiting, biding his time.
“I’m glad that my struggle is of little importance to you, Sherlock. It was at your brother’s insistence that I was a troubled boy and therefore must be sent to an asylum!”
Sherlock looked as if he wanted to protest but he sighed and grabbed John’s hand, getting himself up off the bed walking with John to the kitchen. He seated himself while John served him his food.
“I don’t quite know. He was Irish, God, can’t mistake that accent. He looked to be in his...I don’t know...early fifties?”
John shook his head and took the robe from him. He had wanted to let Sherlock try to establish a bond but none seemed forthcoming.
“Nonsense, John. We shall be busy at work today, and had you allowed me to return to work the night before, I would see no qualms in spending our day in bed, doing whatever we desire.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. The first time Mycroft happened upon Sherlock’s cache, he was angered, but it was not the kind of anger that was expected. He was disappointed. He was hurt. They did not talk for months, and the lack of conversation between the two weighed on Sherlock more than he cared to admit.
John had been admiring Sherlock’s bare form but he raised an eyebrow at the procured item when his lover returned to him.
He led Sherlock towards the back of the store, reserved for men who were too tall, too heavy, or too short. John was not the average height of a man, Sherlock paid little attention to that. The clerk held his hand underneath the various suits that were hanging up, as well as folded on tables and showcases.
“Do you think, Mycroft, that he also has the heart of the ideal human? The soul of the ideal human? Is he truly the perfect man? Can one even create such a thing?”
Sherlock had found his voice eventually, breathy moans and little high-pitched noises leaving his lips. “John! Ah! F-feels….so good!”
Mrs. Hudson still looked cross but her attention was caught. John added, “We are not asking you to house a criminal. We merely ask that you give this man lodging. He will pull his weight, and he will be not far from us should he ever feel the need to see us, or us him.”
“I consider it self-defense. Do you think that anyone would have told Powers to stop? To leave the Irish boy be? You are no genius if you think it so.”
“Sherlock, what did Thomas say to you? Before he jumped, he turned and spoke with you. What was it about?”
“They simply mistook me for another person. They were positively besotted, John, I doubt they knew who they were assaulting.”
Sherlock could not contain himself, he wanted to see John in the suit, he could not wait a moment longer.
“The Vitruvian Man is the model of the ideal human. His proportions are exquisite, his body is truly what mankind desires to have,” He recited its description, long fingers tracing the circles drawn around the body. His head tilted slightly as he stared at the drawing. His mouth twisting into a bitter smirk.
“Looked about six feet? Blue eyes, cheekbones to the heavens, good lord. Rather pretty. Well, before we got to him.”
“He should have never been through that. I am sorry that he was subjected to such torture, and I am glad that the offenders are now rotting in their watery graves.” Sherlock spoke with a venom on his tongue. John gasped, but a question popped into his mind.
“John, please. We will come back, we will not be gone long. Only for a month or so, or however long you desire. You forget that my family comes from an immense lineage of wealth.”
But Sherlock has already started to tune him out again. Too many other thoughts to focus on. Focus. FOCUS! Why can’t he just focus?! He needs a case! No. No no no no. That won’t do! He needs something more, something else. Drugs! He needs them!
Wiggins has passed out next to him on the futon mattress they have pressed up against the wall as a make-shift couch.
A yawn bursts from John. He moves so his forehead is resting on Sherlock’s shoulder instead so he can indulge in the forced intake of air. Sherlock feels the urge to yawn himself, but manages to keep it inside.
“Sherlock,” and John’s voice is a wreck. “I need you, Sherlock. I do.” He swallows. “I don’t know what happened today, and I won’t ask. Not now, at least. But, I--I just need you to know that--that--” and then through gritted teeth, breathed more than spoken, “
John laughed, finding his partner’s expression quite adorable. “I love you,” he whispered into the closing distance between them.
They were in Glasgow, an interesting murder-suicide gone just murder. They’d caught the killer. The local PD having thanked Sherlock profusely. He should’ve preened in the acknowledgment. He should have glowed from the praise. Beamed at the recognition of his talents. He and John should be eating take-out together now, laughing about this and that, about nothing in particular. But instead…
The cover of 'Dear Prudence' that Sherlock is listening to in this chapter is by Siouxsie And The Banshees. I personally love it. So does Wiggins, apparently.
imperative. Sherlock liked to stand, sitting slowed the circulation throughout the transport, and therefore to his brain. But now he
Though he’s certain John is asleep, his slumbering body still grips Sherlock tighter, unconscious mind apparently happy at hearing those words.
The foul mouth sort of put John at ease. Even if he was the wrong Santa, at least he wasn't very polite... Though he had just been tackled... Hmm.
Sherlock glanced at the man every so often, who was making decent progress in his novel. What was it that John was trying to prove? It irked Sherlock to no end.
It was just after a case. They were walking away from a crime scene, having solved it all in under thirty minutes without even having to go far--the killer had still been there, hiding in a hidden room of all places. John had called Sherlock brilliant, even as the angry killer was being carted off in the background, yelling and gnashing his teeth like an enraged dog. John had only had eyes for Sherlock.
John pulls his lips into his mouth and bites them in that funny way he has, and once again nods to himself.
John chuckled at the flakes of white dotting Sherlock’s dark curls, illuminated just barely by the light shining through from behind him.
He didn’t hear the violin as he walked down the hall--the usual sign that Sherlock wasn’t having such a good night--and instead was met by an increasing chill.
Every time Sherlock finds a way of showing John that his help is both useless and unwanted—including tossing the pack of nicotine patches he’d gone and bought out the window and into the rain.
“Thought you might try this,” John says, approaching Sherlock from the other side of the flat by the fireplace, where he’d just plugged his iPhone into that monstrosity Mrs.Hudson has gotten them for Christmas and has since sat abandoned on Sherlock’s desk.
But then Sherlock just had to go on, didn’t he? He wouldn't be Sherlock if he didn't find a way to piss everyone off in a ten-block radius
John is standing in the hallway where Sherlock walks back and forth. He’s got his arms crossed and is watching Sherlock’s movements with very tired eyes.
He manages to type out before he drops his phone. He’s fairly certain he hit the send button. If not he knows Mycroft has ways of finding him. Actually, why would Mycroft ask for an address in the first place? ‘
“Need something?” John asks. He’s sitting in a chair across from the couch--where Sherlock sits, pondering--and had his bare feet up on the coffee table, laptop propped up on his knees, typing away--no doubt about their latest case. He’s smiling over at Sherlock and Sherlock can barely take it. It’s all so domestic, so cheery, so...well, God, he wasn’t going to say
John worries his bottom lip in contemplation. A red flush comes to his face, that Sherlock doesn’t think has anything to do with the whiskey. And his breaths are coming faster and faster. When he looks at Sherlock his pupils are blown wide.
“Right.” John had said at that, and then he’d simply grabbed a book, moved his chair over so it was right next to Sherlock, and then sat down and began to read.
After their Bad Santa was carted off, Sherlock turned to John to say something, but John just held up a hand. He needed at least a few minutes of silence before Sherlock started in on excuses and explanations on why he wasn’t in the wrong.
“Sherlock!” Sebastian is standing beside him, tugging on his arm, pulling him closer to the stereo system. Closer to the mirror laid out on top of it, covered in stripes of white powder and one rather impressive pile. He hands Sherlock the gold straw they’d been using, it was a cocaine straw, vintage from the twenty’s, and a rather taboo family heirloom of Seb’s.
''Coffee is good. Not thousand pound shoes.'' She crossed the room and pressed a quick kiss to his lips. ''I was cross at the situation, not you. It's not your fault. The movers are shifting things to my new house as we speak, I'll send you the address. You can have the dress delivered and pick me up at 9.'' He nodded up at her and she offered her wrist to him. He took it gently and removed her watch and bracelet, revealing the pale scars of bite marks.
''Oh, Anthea dear, I'm so glad you're here. I really thought this one would work, I like John- but the shouting...''
''Well, Doctor Watson. How are things with my brother? Clearly the relationship is... progressing.''
She slipped the phone into a hidden inside pocket of her tailored jacket and leaned forward to tap the driver's partition with a neatly manicured red fingertip. He twisted to get the address before smoothly turning around in the busy street and setting off swiftly in the same direction as the taxi.
She slipped into the car, sliding across the chair to let Mycroft sit next to her. Relaxed and tired, she leant against his side, shivering at the cold of his skin through the thin jacket.
Edit: Sorry but I need another week. It's proving harder to write than I expected and I have no real excuse :( I promise it'll be up by next week.
''He shouldn't have solved this- he shouldn't be capable. He's going to want to know about all of them- the others.'' His voice was quiet, resigned to the fact that his carefully constructed house of cards was tumbling down around him.
"Dr Watson? You applied for the job as a personal assistant to Sherlock Holmes.'' Anthea smiled easily, knowing the image she portrayed. Weak, gentle, completely submissive. Easy to overpower, easy to outwit. A good image. One she used often with men like John Watson. Men who thought of themselves as honourable and dependable. Easy to manipulate. Easier still to control.
''Yes. That- I will book it. And I'll get you a dress. And shoes. the ones you've been looking at.''
''Ow. When he said hurt a little bit- that hurt. A lot.'' He poked gently at the healing bite mark, the chemicals in Sherlock's saliva healing the skin faster than usual, leaving two tender, pale, scars slightly raised against the tanned skin of his neck. Anthea smirked at his cautiousness.
Anthea waited for her employer to leave the room before following, glancing back as she left to see John cover his face and fall back heavily into the twisted and stained sheets.
''It's Mycroft's house- he'll be in bed still? He glanced at Anthea on his way past and left the room, walking up the stairs. He got halfway up before something seemed to occur to him and he turned slowly.
On the other side of London, Sherlock was standing by the entrance to a garage, arguing with Sergeant Donovan, gesticulating wildly. John was stood at his shoulder, absently leaning out of the way of his partner's flailing hands, looking mostly bemused about his presence at the crime scene. The Sergeant quickly grew bored of the fight, perhaps sensing that she wasn't going to win, and stalked off to berate one of the junior officers.
''Uh, no- not normally,'' Sherlock face fell and the Doctor rushed to make amends. ''It's a bit strange. I just- the email said you were a detective? Your website has stuff on how to hide bodies.''
The next morning Anthea woke to a crash and the sharp tinkle of glass falling down hardwood stairs. She wrapped herself in her dressing gown and stepped slowly towards the door, pulling her arms in tight against her chest as the cold wind blew through the shattered window and into her room. The rock that had broken it had scratched the stairs and left chalky marks on the wall. Anthea pulled her head back into her room and sat back on the edge of her bed, pulling her phone from it's charger and dialling the first speed dial.
''Well- you know what that means- he asked some of them if they would- some said yes, some no- but either way, he's always been used to getting what he wants. He tried to bond- taking more blood, planning to transfuse his own back afterwards- without understanding properly what he was doing, drunk on the excess of blood. It never ended well.
John spent the rest of the afternoon making phone calls to dentists and doctors to find the victim's dentist. When he found the right surgery, he learned rather more than he expected.
Sherlock had had previous donors, Anthea knew that. She hadn't been aware just how many. The list she found was long- a long table, names, then two dates, then a final column- notes. The most recent name was of course John Watson. Roughly the twenty previous names' dates were very close together- none lasting for more than a week, some not more than a day. None had notes. Before that, it seemed to have been far more complicated. They had lasted months, some years. The notes were ominous.
Anthea told the driver to wait and settled back in her warm seat, switching on the live cctv feed from the strangers room in the Diogenes club. It showed a flickering, grainy picture of the two men at first, but she quickly typed a few pass codes to raise the quality of the image she received to their full potential. The cameras were of course completely illegal, but Sherlock was hardly going to press charges against his own brother, and even if he did, there would be no proof it was Mycroft's doing- there never was. She kicked off her heels and tucked her feet up beside her on the seat, turned her attention to the two men on the screen and watched as Sherlock prepared himself for what was sure to be a dramatic entrance- lurking in the dark corners of a room was something he had clearly picked up from his older brother.
''Your pretty little donor there not using it? Given up pretending she's just your assistant, have you?''
''I'll need the Russian files ready for the meeting at one, and these copying and validating- the dates will need changing to match the timeline we agreed on.'' He handed her a stack of paper- birth certificates, marriage certificates, high school awards, even photographs. She took them easily, passing him a plate of hot toast in return. He balanced the plate on top of his files and  picked up a single neat triangle of toast in his right hand, waving it around as he continued to speak.
Mycroft's attention switched rapidly to his work. He stood up, brushing invisible flecks of dust from his suit and taking his tea cup with him. He called back from partway up the stairs.
John mulled it over in his mind and then grinned madly, laughing. He has wanted this for a long time then, why did he simply not ask sooner?
“It is, Sherlock. I had never intended for this to happen, I only wanted to see you again, and John. He caught me whilst I was leaving. It is all my fault,” Sebastian hung his head and his voice became shaky. Sherlock frowned, had he been given more time, Sebastian would not still retain his child-like mind, perhaps he would have been an equal to himself, or maybe even smarter than the both of them combined. He echoed the words that he heard John say so many times before. Sebastian was little more than a child mentally, and that was the fault of Moriarty and himself.
Please, continue to kudos, comment, subscribe and share and thank you all once again for being such amazing readers! We hope you like the ending!
“Come, John. We still have an hour before the sun appears. We should take advantage and rest for the remainder of the night.”
Sherlock was ill-equipped to deal with such words. He only meant to while away the time! Fortunately, the tub would be filled to the brim by now and his time in the bath would be ample enough to form responses for John’s words.
“Would you have preferred prison? You know, I have heard rumors that the courts have executed children. I wonder what they would have done to you, should my brother have chosen to take that route.”
They reached the flat and Sherlock paid while John hurried up the stairs and into the building. Before Sherlock could do the same, he was stopped by Inspector Lestrade.
“John, calm yourself. I have no broken bones and our task was successful. Our first priority is to tend to him, for we have laboured tirelessly to bring him to life.”
The two pondered it and Sally nodded. Anderson was incapacitated from his hangover. He wasn’t going to be of much help to him. She stood straight, and showed Sherlock that she was not a force to be reckoned with, and he believed her.
“Mrs. Hudson, it takes a body a month to die of starvation. I shall be fine for quite some time yet.”
John slid the robe onto him with the slightest movements. He was only ever that gentle with him, much the same way John was with Sherlock. John finished tying the sash around his waist, a smile directed at the creation, while Sherlock watched with arms wrapped around himself.
“Is something the matter? You’ve been rather dejected since our departure from the manor. Did you wish to stay longer?”
A teardrop landed on his hand. He was crying, what a pathetic man he was. To be brought to tears because he was beat up. A grown man sobbing as if he were a child.
John’s eyes darted around the room, as if the answer would be written on one of the items in the flat. Sherlock rested his hand underneath his chin. He would be amused to hear this answer, no doubt. John’s eyes shot back to his.
Sherlock yawned and nuzzled his face into John’s back. His arms wrapped tighter around his waist. “It is his choice. I believe that this whole ordeal has relieved him of his separation anxiety. Also, we are not far from him, and I think that’s another comfort for him. He will do fine here.”
“My love,” John began, his expression shifting into concern as he slid to his knees at the foot of Sherlock’s chair, “have I gone too far? All of those things I said were true but I fear I may have said too much too soon.” His warm, sturdy hands covered Sherlock’s, everything about him exuding a sense of care.
His brother would have been disappointed in Sherlock if he could have witnessed what happened in the living area. He had wanted to hold John’s hand, no, he had
Sherlock looked down and saw that John was finished mending his wrist, he was only holding onto it for comfort now. He smiled and continued on with his thoughts. “Surely you witnessed this in the laboratory. He was hostile whenever I came into contact with him, but you, you are the exception it seems.”
The longer he worked his finger in and out, the more Sherlock seemed to open up around him. Soon John was collecting more Vaseline to work a second finger in and this time Sherlock accepted the intrusion without objection.
Sherlock smiled and sat at the very edge of the bed. Without words, he bent down and kissed John, and to his delight, it was John that deepened the kiss. When they finally parted, John’s hand was now covering the one Sherlock had resting on his bare chest. Even in such poor lighting, John could always reduce Sherlock to nothing with a simple grin. He would have surely died if he did not have John’s face to remind him why staying was worth it.
Moriarty would return, and he would ruin their lives, if the authorities did not do it first. Who was to say that the villain hadn’t already informed the police of their “scandalous” lifestyle? How would they defend themselves against all of Scotland Yard as well as the English court? He would defend John to the death, literally, if the need arose. None of this was John’s fault; he did not know that a relationship such as theirs was illegal and frowned upon. It was Sherlock, the selfish one out of the two, who put John in such a position. He would rather see himself clapped in irons than John. Sherlock had nothing to live for anyway, John; however, John had everything to live for.
He might have kept on moving his hips but John was not aware of such actions, lost in the glow with his forehead pressed to Sherlock’s.
The tips of his mouth curled to form a small smile. He found it silly to be moved by such meaningless things - Mycroft would scoff at the childish idiocy. The very nature of stars was to shine. Should the lamps in the street ever die, the bright dots of the heavens would provide what was their natural service to expanses farther than Sherlock could ever comprehend.
Sherlock turned to the door and left his room. He sped up the steps, propelled by disgust towards himself and the physical manifestation of all his weaknesses in the creature that lay upstairs. The room was dark but Sherlock knew precisely where the creature was. He clutched it by the arms and hauled it off of its resting place to hear the thud of lifeless limbs hitting the floor. His eyes fell upon the creature as he dragged it across the room but his gaze was obstructed by the hot tears he was not conscious of shedding. Anger for himself was directed to the man who had failed him, showed him not only his own defectiveness but the lengths to which he would go to cure it. Such features that had brought him peace before he saw not, only the betrayal of someone to which Sherlock would have loved and cared for in return for the same.
Sherlock relied on John for support to ascend the steps into their flat. He could barely stand on his own, the gang that attacked him achieving their incentive to hurt him. He could hear John’s voice as they neared the front door. Sweet nothings, Sherlock told himself. Those kind words that John whispered to him, they meant nothing, they were only meant to calm Sherlock down from the shock of the beating he experienced
Even in this dire situation, John managed to reduce Sherlock to a blushing mess. He moved to untie John’s legs, and swiftly caught John before he was able to sink to the floor. Throwing one arm over his shoulder, Sherlock was able to support John.
Thomas smiled sadly. “He has passed on months ago now. You are in no immediate danger, I assure you. I am off to meet my friend now, I shall inquire about your release and if it is granted, do whatever you please.”
John only smiled and kissed Sherlock lightly on the lips. An action that still sent tendrils of turmoil and battling emotions through Sherlock.
“You just missed Sherlock, have you bumped into him during your travel here?” Sebastian could not stand to look John in the eye and instead looked to the floor. He shook his head. He was terrible, he was a horrible person for lying to him! John’s fingers went under his chin so that they could be meet his again.
The room was warm and, John had to admit, the thought of the bath was quite inviting. He sat Sherlock down on the edge of the tub and began to disrobe him without a word.
“Alright. In that case, I should prepare dinner, and I believe this is the perfect time to see how well the boy does.”
He smacked his right cheek, prompting a jolt from John’s body. It worked, but it did not bring Sherlock joy to inflict more pain upon him. He smacked the other cheek, and then the right one again until John’s head shot up as if waking from a nightmare. His chest rose and fell with each sharp inhale of breath and his eyes looked bewildered until they landed on Sherlock’s smiling face. Letting out a sigh of relief he planted a crushing kiss to John’s lips.
“He was unable to finish the letter,” John’s voice was soft behind him, laden with fatigue. Sherlock turned to face him, he did not wipe the tear streaks from his face. He almost wanted to tell John to return to sleep, that he would join him in a minute, but in that moment he wanted nothing more than to feel John’s strong arms wrapped around him and to listen to his soothing whisper assuring that everything would be alright. The candle’s flame shone directly upon Sherlock’s face, making the tears on his face more obvious. Sherlock shook his head in defeat.
“Now, tell me, who is this dashing young man you’ve bought with you? I do hope that you are not looking to find me a young husband.”
Sherlock coughed loudly again, it was dry, and it made John cringe whenever he heard it. He had half a mind to send for a doctor, but Sherlock was a stubborn fool and insisted on suffering. He sat still and waited for Sherlock’s coughing to cease, until he then heard the horrible sounds of retching and knew that his hacking became so severe that it forced him to become sick, no doubt Sherlock failed to make it to the washroom in time and vomited all over the floor. John sighed and closed his journal as he made his way down the stairs.
John wore a face of anger and, because Sherlock could not afford anything happening to their creation, not when Moriarty was expected to return soon, he gripped John’s upper arm and forced him to meet his eyes.
“Oh John, I am an awful man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your love. You, it is always you...you keep me right…”
Sherlock nodded, his mother had doted on him whenever she had the chance. Even upon her deathbed she had found ways to spoil him. Mrs. Hudson pulled out an envelope from her apron pocket and handed it to Sherlock. It had his name written on it in Mycroft’s elegant scrawl. Sherlock’s eyes flickered up at Mrs. Hudson’s. She only smiled and said, “A letter I was entrusted to give to you. It was his only request to me in his last days.”
“And what shall we do regarding the state of your…” He gestured towards Sherlock’s face. Sherlock frowned, he would have to hide it, would he not? There was no way to avoid it though. He would have to brave the public remarks and all.
This brought Sherlock immense pleasure to see while also reminding him to set out extra blankets for John. He yawned and settled further into the bed until Sherlock felt arms snaking around his waist. He did not want to move, he could not risk John’s arms leaving their current position. He even found himself moving in closer towards John, not stopping until he felt the soft skin of John’s chest pressed against his cheek.
The man took several steps toward them and John stepped in front of Sherlock to protect him from anything that he might try. Both were surprised to see the creation extending his hand out to them. John turned his head to face Sherlock and Sherlock whispered in his ear, “I believe he is attempting a handshake.”
“It is not about intimacy, I merely wish to have a man that would never think to betray me or deny me. A minion if you will. A custom one.”
Mycroft’s voice rang in his head. He was stern and cold this time, not like the dream he had before where Mycroft smiled and told Sherlock sweet nothings. He remembered that day, that discussion, no, that lecture that Mycroft had given him. It was his fault, he had been stupid and careless, Mycroft was right. He had been an idiot that day, and he shudders to think what would have happened if his elder brother was not present.
He did not kill another human being, this was true. What of John though? He was not truly alive, nor human. Composed of body parts from the deceased, what did that make him? He was not a monster, not an abomination. He did not have to kill to get John, but people had to die in order for him to have John. His brother, and the poor unfortunate souls who now rested below the earth with missing limbs and organs. What a cruel, selfish man he was.
Sebastian nodded. “I have never borne ill-will towards him, John. It was he who could not stand the sight of me.”
GUYS WE DID IT! This is the end of Vitruvian and we are so so glad that you all have enjoyed it as much as you did. My co-author and I are very sorry for the extreme delays in updating, life happens you know?
Sherlock sniffed and shook his head. He could not afford to think of such things. They were gone and he was safe in his room, alone, away from the cold gazes and murmuring. His companion would not treat him like that, he would be kind and protective. He would love Sherlock. The thought of which made him smile softly.
About the lube situation, Vaseline was created in 1872 in the United States so us authors reasoned that Sherlock is spoilt enough to buy lube from overseas. Probably not the first strange thing he's gotten form there anyways, right?
“What will I do with money?” The tone that he asked it in, childish, scared, excited. It tugged at her heartstrings and she almost blurted out that she would pay him right now. But he needed to earn his keep just as everyone else did.
Sherlock shrugged. “I do not know what I want. My body yearns for peace of mind, but I am unsure of how to achieve it.”
To each name there was no response, and Sherlock began scrutinizing the book for whatever he could find. It wasn’t until John halted his page-flipping and selected a name - Sebastian. The name of a saint who became a martyr for his faith, for his people. Sherlock chuckled at the irony of the namesake the man was to have.
John did as he said but it was no use. They were both stuck in the uncomfortable chairs. Sherlock closed his eyes and dropped his head. How were they to get out of this? He whipped around and searched for anything that might cut the rope. Sharp wood, A shard of glass, anything with a sharp edge would free him from this dilemma. Before he could even find anything, he heard voices nearing them, no, just one voice. John was directly in front of the entrance, and Sherlock had to be sure that no harm would come to him.
He heard the men mumble about something, and then the sound of a door closing. Did they both retire? Did they leave again? How long would they be out? Maybe he would risk it to see John and Sherlock again. Hearing their voices made him sink with despair. He missed John and Sherlock terribly, and to see them once again, and so briefly as well made him hurt in more places than his wrist.
“To think, Mrs. Hudson had this in her possession all this time. Why would she think to bequeath the note to me now?”
Sherlock let out a sigh and nodded. John was right, he was always right. He went to put his jacket on and gave John one last look before he left the inn. He would not be gone long; thirty minutes should be enough to soothe his mind. He hated to leave John alone, this was not a safe space. He shoved his hands in his pocket and strolled, he was not so far gone that he missed how gorgeous the day was. This was surely the reason why John had fallen in love with the country. He had half a mind to visit the pastry shop that John had come to frequent. John would appreciate the gesture, he was sure. He was so occupied with his thoughts, that he did not see the man in front of him. He stumbled and grabbed the stranger’s shoulders to steady them both.
Sherlock wanted to believe him. Lestrade truly seemed ignorant as to the actual reason why Sherlock came. Moriarty was toying with him. He was sadistic so why wouldn’t he torment Sherlock with the one thing that scared him the most? He had Sebastian, and nearly ruined Sherlock and John’s relationship to have him. He broke John’s heart, and that Sherlock could not forgive. Moriarty was a parasite; he wouldn’t stop until he’s drained everything from Sherlock. What would he do next? How would he win this game? How could Sherlock possibly defeat him?
John, too drowsy to respond, simply nuzzled into Sherlock’s had and was asleep again in seconds. Sherlock found the light snores adorable. He rose from his spot and left the room, closing the door with such ease as he exited. When he came down the stairs, he found Mrs. Hudson preparing his plate, as well as heating a kettle on the stove. He took his seat and watched as she fluttered about the kitchen and the dining room, setting Sherlock’s place and checking on the food that was still cooking. It wasn’t until he saw her in action that he realized he had missed her. The way she fussed over his clothes, cooked his food and set his place, how different Baker Street would seem without her. She came from the kitchen and placed the silverware on both sides of his plate. Fried egg, ham, and beans on toast were laid out on the porcelain. It smelled heavenly. Sherlock hoped John would wake up in time to eat Mrs. Hudson’s cooking, knowing he would love it so.
Sherlock ignored her praise. He was mulling over his plan in his head. He had the notes, he was going to get the materials that night. But where would he piece it together? Suddenly it came to him. Mycroft rented a private flat on Baker Street for whenever he felt need to get away from Sherlock’s antics or his job. Sherlock was the only other person who had a key. It was fit with an attic big enough for Sherlock to work in. He would have to leave the manor since there would be no room to hide the limbs if he should return. The maids cleaned every crevice of the house; if they didn’t find the parts first, they would surely smell them. How long would he be away? Days, weeks, months, years? It didn’t matter, time was of little consequence. What choice was there? Snapping out of his thoughts, he slammed his hands on the desk and turned toward Mrs. Hudson.
He tossed the paper to the side of the door and took his coat off to hang on the rack before he joined John at the table. They shared a kiss before Sherlock took his seat adjacent and looked down at the food that John had cooked for him.
“Sherlock, you know that I am wounded that you would keep such dire information from me. Why is it that you thought it best to keep me in ignorance rather than tell me of my true nature, why you desperately sought to create a creature like me?”
“Do listen, I need you to fetch a coach for me. I’m to be running an errand for sometime and I expect the man to be outside upon my arrival, do you think you can do this for me?”
Sebastian nodded. He was terrified, but John needed him, and with the man he was facing, Sherlock would need them both. He raced to the door with John to locate Sherlock and Moriarty without a thought more.
“You always told me that there would be no meaning to life if there was no death. Remember those stories you used to read to me at night? Tales full of death and rebirth. How unfair, how positively unfair. You died with no hope of rebirth, does that not anger you as much as it does me?”
“The words I say ring true, John.” He tried miserably to retain his composure although he cried like an infant. “How is that you’ve come to be in my company for so long, and not even so much as noticed the fact that I’ve barely any visitors? I’ve not acquired posts for ages, nor have you ever met another soul, save for Inspector Lestrade. I am alone, John, hated and despised for being anything other than the person society expects me to be! They attacked me because they had every right to! I am nothing more than a freak, John. You would be a fool to stay...to join me in my isolation...you would do well, I think, out there. People would favor you, women will love you. You will forget about me in time so I urge you to go. I will ruin you, John. I will drag you into the desolate world that is loneliness and you too will come to resent me in time.”
Sherlock and John returned from their outing just after noon. John had taken position behind him, assisting in pulling off Sherlock’s coat. While the walk had gone splendidly, Sherlock was not able to hide the little expressions of pain that movement caused. Apparently John had remained as observant as ever. Sherlock, however, seemed distracted. Since they ran into Thomas he had spoken little to John and resigned himself to near silence upon their return to the flat. John would not press him, he would wait until Sherlock was ready to speak.
Sherlock laughed, he’d much prefer to laugh compared to all the days he spent crying. He nodded and said it again, just to be sure that John got it.
Sherlock gave a curt nod. She smiled and led him to the dining room. The table seated multiple people but it was only Sherlock who would dine there now. He struggled to not look at Mycroft’s empty chair. He took his seat and watched as Mrs. Hudson set his plate in front of him.
He turned the page and caught a glance at John, who looked absolutely enthralled with the book itself. He would run his finger along the page, and at times, it would prevent Sherlock from continuing with the story, much to John’s dismay. Sherlock would only smile and tell him that he was unable to continue if John would not move his finger. Then, while Sherlock read the words aloud, John would stare into his eyes with the most sincere adoration that a person could ever feel for another. Sherlock often felt his cheeks growing hot, signaling the growing blush that tinted his pale skin. He was thankful for the fact that John was ignorant when it came to humanity, he would hate to have to explain his foolishness. John was the only one to give Sherlock such a soft look. He was not used to such affection.
Sherlock and John left the manor two hours after they had breakfast. John called for a coach, and the servants, mainly Jeanette, packed the men’s belongings. When they were alerted to the coachman’s arrival, John said his goodbyes to Mrs. Hudson as well as his thanks for her hospitality. It was Sherlock who lingered in the back, watching as she smiled at him and gave him a hug. When it came his turn to leave, he only stared at her, waiting for a response. She did not smile, she merely hugged him and stepped aside so that he could leave. Every instinct in his body told him to keep walking and to not look back but of course he would be a fool and turn around. There she stood, eyes watery and wearing a quivering smile. He walked back over to her and wanted to say something, anything. He wanted to hear her reassuring words, he wanted her to bawl over his impending absence yet again, but instead she placed a hand on his cheek and he shuddered. Oh how cold it felt to him. He sought the warmth that she always offered with her gentle touch. He felt his eyes tearing just the same.
Sebastian’s eyes widened at Sherlock’s words, then his mouth gave way to a wide smile. He nodded furiously and extended his hand towards Sherlock. “Oh of that you have my word. Thank you so much, Sherlock!”
When the tub was full, John returned to the kitchen where Sherlock was still at the table, gaze frozen upon something and his brows furrowed. John assumed the man upstairs was on his mind but soon those tired viridian eyes turned to him and John read guilt in their flicker. He smiled and dropped down to one knee before the man, finding his hands.
“Really? I had assumed Thomas was lying. The man does have such idle fantasies at times. This, however, this changes everything!”
The loud utterance of the name startled John; he rose to meet Sherlock’s frightened and frustrated eyes. Sherlock ran over to him and moved him away from the fire.
John’s brows were furrowed; his mouth quivered as he tried to speak. Sherlock smiled softly- how new to the earth he was. The body of an adult he possessed, but he retained the intelligence of a newborn infant, only freed from his mother’s womb mere hours ago. Sherlock only realized after John had reanimated that he would have no knowledge of even the simplest things, such as talking. It was of little bother to him, he would teach John every language in the world if he so wished to learn, all that mattered to Sherlock was John. Sherlock feared that he was caught in a waking dream, that none of this was real, only an illusion created by his darkened mind. He wondered how long it would take before he would awake in his cold and lonely room with no John. He did not care, if this was a dream he would bask in every moment that he got to spend with John, no matter how painful it would be to wake from such a tender imagining.
Sherlock had half a mind to continue to the laboratory and complete the last set of notes they needed before they could begin the actual construction of the body. He was thankful for John’s help, it would surely take longer had he done it on his own. However, the vacant spot on the bed looked enticing to the weary man now. He should not be such a fool to pick the lab but he could never resist John, and as of right now, he certainly could not resist sleep. With a pout on his face he returned to his side of the bed and settled in. He turned his back to John but this did not stop the other man from wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and pressing his cheek against his neck.
Sherlock could not speak, if he tried all that would come out was bursts of tears and incoherent words. She understood, she did not want him to say a word. She slipped the letter in his coat pocket and rested a hand on his cheek.
“It gets lonesome here, when you retire to bed. I find myself staring towards your door, hoping that you would return and join me.”
“Your reading and vocabulary has gotten considerably better since our first encounter, John. I am proud.”
“Thank you, John, but I only inquired because everything is set in place to begin such an act. We are both nude, I daresay that we are aroused, you could have begun the process on your own.”
“So what are you planning to do? Admit me for insanity? Claim that I am mentally unfit to live in the public?”
Thomas and John stood aghast at Sebastian’s words. He was a fast learner, and Sherlock would have been proud to witness this moment. John smiled softly at Sebastian, and the way the man held his hand. He was nervous, terrified even, but he wanted to defend them as best as he could.
“Thomas, you’ll help us, yeah? Your friend can get us out of here and you’ll never see us again. We’ll leave, packed and ready before nightfall o-or he’ll kill us!”
Sherlock started to trudge over to the entrance, hoping that Moriarty would move out of the way, but he only stood and watched Sherlock’s futile attempts at leaving.
“Do forgive me then for announcing my excitement for being back in the one place I can truly call my home!”
They parted for just a moment to work their bottoms off, Sherlock grabbing a tin of Vaseline from from under his mattress.
“I fear it is not as fanciful as you would prefer, Mrs. Hudson. He was advised by a friend that I was in need of a flatmate and he was as well. I think even you can gather that we were quite satisfied with each other and agreed upon the flatshare.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, to tell Moriarty how sick he was. But he was right, wasn’t he? Sherlock knew nothing of being normal. Wasn’t he just as bitter as Moriarty was about his childhood too? He was laughed at, he was attacked, and he was bullied because the other children could not tolerate someone as freakish as him.
He hated Mycroft for saying that to him. Redbeard was the first and only friend he had. He brought him happiness, joy. To say Sherlock fell into a depression was an understatement. For months he confined himself to his room, sobbing and despising the world for taking Redbeard away from him. Mycroft offered the boy the collar but Sherlock could not stand the sight of the beautiful collar meant for a dog that no longer lived. He had no clue that Mycroft had kept it for all these years. The sentimental fool.
“They are...away for the moment. I have been left alone and this is such a beautiful country I had a thought to take a walk. How glad I am to have gained that temporary feeling of courage.” His eyes flickered to John’s own and made his heart swell.
John could not help but smile at his words. Come nightfall, John would be able to see their efforts pay off. Their man would wake, finally. He grabbed Sherlock’s hands again and held them up to his mouth. His lips lightly brushed against his knuckles.
“Tell me boy, how have you come to meet John? You have always been alone, how is it that you’ve suddenly found yourself a friend? You were never the social sort, and I doubt Mycroft’s death would alter that.”
Sherlock felt quite the fool for smiling as much as he did in one night. Less than a day of life and John had already successfully said two words, one of which being his own name. How many more would he learn days, weeks, from then? Sherlock felt a twinge of excitement as he thought of the future. Their future. He rose from his place on the floor and motioned for John to follow him.
“Sebastian.” The smile he wore was clearly due in part to John sporting one of his own. It was clear imitation. Is that how he was able to learn so quickly? Had he been picking up speech patterns from the way they both spoke? This was eerily wonderful.
With that he left the building. He heard Sally and Anderson bickering still. They were still here? Why did had they not yet left? Sherlock sighed, they would give him a hard time but he had to question them on Moriarty’s whereabouts. He walked over to them and was not surprised to see the two stiffen. He raised his hands to show that he meant no harm.
Sherlock’s chest twinged as he witnessed John’s mouth hang open. This was it, John too would abhor Sherlock. He would avoid him at every possible moment despite the small space they lived in. He would treat him just as the children did, as people do now.
Sherlock had laughed at that, and was glad to hear John finally consent to come with him. He wondered though, what would have taken place had he refused to journey to Switzerland with him. Would Sherlock have stolen away in the middle of the night? Or would he wear that pout that he was keen on wearing while preparing the carriage? It was too late to deal with the what ifs; he was here with Sherlock now.
“Mycroft was breech; came out legs first. He wailed as strongly as any newborn and was a bit on the heavy side, never quite lost that weight. Your mother could scarcely contain her excitement. She wanted nothing more than to hold him, to smell him, to see her newborn.”
So engrossed in his thoughts, he nearly missed the entrance to Scotland Yard. He stopped in front of the window and peeked inside. Just as the law never sleeps, neither did the policemen. He sighed and steeled himself before going inside of the building. He was met with several policemen walking alongside him, having discussions about their recent arrests and their personal lives. One of them had just had their first child, Sherlock overheard. There were miscellaneous drunks and thieves in some of the prison cells. Two of the criminals were in the cell together. One of them was passed out, the bottle lazily gripped in his hand, and the other, a thief judging by the way he checked his cell mate's sack, was disappointed that the old drunk had nothing of value.
John’s smile was covered in bits of the bread and ham. Sherlock grabbed the handkerchief from his pocket and wiped John’s mouth. He thought that he had imagined it, but John’s cheeks seemed flushed, rosier than normal. He was darker than Sherlock, then again it did not take much for a person to appear tanner than Sherlock. John seemed tanned, as if he had spent months in a sunny area, like an island, or a desert. It suited him. His hair only appeared more golden than in contrast. Sherlock pulled away and placed the soiled handkerchief on the table.
“Do forgive me, John. As you have so helpfully pointed out, I am beside myself at the moment. Please do not take these words to heart, it shall never be my intention to cause you any hurt, physical or emotional.”
Sherlock attempted to free himself of John’s grip but his hold was firm, and that meant he would get him to lay back down.
Sherlock’s smirk disappeared and Sally’s face turned smug at the victory. Anderson was escorted over to her by a policeman and she took her leave with him. Sherlock could faintly hear the bickering as they left the building. He sniffed and walked towards the Inspector’s desk. Thankfully, the man was already there and helping himself to a meager sandwich and a cup of tea. Sherlock cleared his throat and stared at the grey-haired cop until his attention was caught. After the third throat clearing Lestrade looked up at him with a mouth full of sandwich. His eyes widened at the sight of Sherlock and immediately he tried to swallow the food in his mouth, washing it down with tea.
Sherlock looked into John’s steel-blue eyes and smiled. “Do you mean that you did not speak in jest?”
John pressed in his digit and pulled out slowly, surprised at how tight and warm the space actually was. He could not imagine such a feeling wrapped around his aching cock but just trying to sent shocks of arousal up his spine.
Mycroft never did care for rain - an unlucky lot for a man residing in England.  Had he not been burdened with running the British government, Sherlock suspected he would permanently inhabit warmer climates.  Sherlock knew that Mycroft chose his career because it was one of their mother’s dying wishes.
Sherlock sank into the wooden chair and pushed down the feeling of being reduced to the clients that the Inspector had to deal with every day. Lestrade folded his hands on the table and stared at Sherlock with that loathsome smile on. What did he want from Sherlock? Did he want him to crack and tell him everything? Tell him about Mycroft, tell him about John, about Sebastian, and how that madman Moriarty had come to know him? He would not lower himself to such a shameful display in front of a man he barely knew.
“I think you understand my reason for it. Too many memories here, Mrs. Hudson. Everywhere my gaze falls reminds me of Mycroft in some variant. I cannot bear it anymore. This feeling that I harbor, it gnaws at me, and I long to dispel it. I miss my brother dearly, and I think that it is best for me to...depart.”
. Who would miss him? He had wondered. The skull that Mycroft obtained for him? The maids that came and went? Who in their right mind would spend days at a time mourning Sherlock Holmes?
He nodded and motioned for John to follow him out of the room. He had not seen Mycroft in ages, what would he possibly say?
She knew that he could not remain here, not until he was positive that he would be able to spend one night without reminding himself of Mycroft.
Sherlock’s voice had not reached its baritone. John sighed, this was the Sherlock Holmes that only he was allowed to see. This what Sherlock could have been if they had known each other their whole lives, well, if John had been human and alive. Sherlock being this soft, this gentle, it stirred the deepest feelings of love and intimacy within John. He still wished for Sherlock to open up to him, and to love him inside and outside. But he would not push Sherlock if he did not wish to have sex, Sherlock would confide in him when he was ready, of that he had no doubt. He was perfectly content to love Sherlock just as they were now.
