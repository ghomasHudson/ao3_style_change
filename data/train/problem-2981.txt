“Dean? What happened? You feel upset,” Cas called from a hall leading into the room. As soon as he came through the door and looked up, he froze, obviously recognizing Claire immediately, despite her having changed a lot in the years since he’d last seen her.
“Morning,” Dean rumbles out from behind his coffee cup, watching from the kitchen table as Cas pours his own.
Surprisingly, having a man (or, man-shaped being) looming over him in such an intimate position didn’t freak Dean out in the least. They’d been slowly edging toward more intimacy as their bond continued to settle anyway, so ever since they’d started
Cas shrugged. “Maybe? It’s been interesting seeing the different regions of the U.S. while hunting with you. This country is so varied and fascinating.”
A few weeks into their new life, Dean and Cas were sitting in their reading nook in the library, the one with the loveseat, absentmindedly checking out some boxes from the archives. Sam was on a new kick to check that everything was catalogued correctly, and they were supposedly helping, but were instead mostly goofing off. Well, Dean was goofing off. Cas was working.
“Right, so.” Sam flipped between a few pages, and Dean was ninety-nine percent sure it was a stalling tactic. He gave his brother a warning look, and Sam slumped in defeat. “This bond … it’s not just meant to share strength between an angel and a human. Or, I guess, for the original ritual it would’ve been two angels.”
“Still not my dad, huh?” she asked, and if this fact upset her, she did a good job hiding it. She had that same bored face every teenager since the beginning of time wore when talking to adults.
After dinner, Sam went back to his latest pile of research. Cas started walking to one of the archive rooms, and when Dean didn’t follow, he turned around to stare curiously at him.
Dean echoes the thought. “Just because you can doesn’t mean you do. Not unless I’m on your grumpy ass, practically shoving you in a bed.”
“Fine. Okay. It was just a thought.” He tried to stop his voice shaking at the emotional barrage but didn’t really succeed.
“I’m gonna buy a TV today. I’m tired of crowding around a laptop to watch movies, and if Cas an’ I are stuck here for a while, I’m gonna need some quality entertainment. Can you imagine watching Furiosa stalking across the desert in 1080p HD? So hot.”
“He’s going to get my brother. Let’s get settled down at the table.” Dean tried to take her duffle, but she yanked it back and hauled it over her shoulder and made her way down the stairs, Dean following with an eyeroll. She was obviously in that independent teen phase he remembered Sam going through. He sent a mental note for Cas to gird his loins and get ready for some major ‘tude.
He started looking through the sweaters once Dean pointed him to the right section for his size. Dean encouraged him to grab anything that he liked the look of, and then he’d try everything on and see what suited him. It was weird to Dean to think about having to try on clothes—he’d been dressing himself for so long and had stopped growing ages ago, so he was comfortable just grabbing and buying—but he figured Cas needed to see and feel the clothes to know what he wanted. They selected some t-shirts and even a few flannels, plus some jeans, then headed for the changing rooms. Dean waited outside while Cas went into a room. Dean thought he’d mojo a clothing change, but was surprised to hear rustling, like he was actually changing clothes by hand. He liked it when Cas tried to do things the human way. Cas’s love for humanity was one of the things that made him so special, and he was glad Cas was getting to experience this life, even if the situation itself was far from ideal.
“I agree, on keeping the bond to our immediate family. Need-to-know only.” It was quiet for a moment. “And you’re sure you want the hunter community to know about us, if it comes up?”
Cas slipped in too quick for even Dean’s increased reflexes to avoid, and less than a second later, he had been slammed on his back, grateful for the soft mat. “You’re getting better. It took me thirty seconds longer to defeat you this time.”
When he let himself really dwell on it, he still felt a little off kilter at the blurry line they walked between platonic and romantic. They held hands and sometimes even cuddled as Dean slept (though he’d never admit that to anyone), and they now talked a lot more than they ever had, but otherwise they were the same platonic friends they’d always been, hidden pining from Dean notwithstanding. And for the most part, he was happy with their new normal. But every once in a while, longing twined up his spine, and he wanted nothing more than to bury himself in Cas’s neck, to kiss his cheek when he was being especially adorable, to shout to the world that he was Cas’s and Cas was his. But they weren’t like that, even though because of the bond, they kinda were. As happy as he was with their life, it still kinda sucked.
Dean watched her rant in amusement, and a touch of nausea. He’d need to find Cas soon. “How’d you know that?”
By the time they got settled—Claire dropping her duffel on the chair next to her but not letting go, and Dean sitting across from her so he and Cas could face her head on—Cas returned with Sam. Sam settled at the head of the table between Claire and Dean, and Cas of course took the seat next to Dean. He fumbled under the table and grabbed Dean’s hand, slotting their fingers together. It had been about ten minutes since they’d last touched, and the connection calmed Dean.
Cas shrugs. “I haven’ tuned in in a while. Been tryin’ to ‘gnore it as much as possible.” He’s starting to slur just a bit, and Dean hopes he’s just falling asleep. One new symptom a day is more than enough. Cas is quiet for a minute or so. “No, nothin’ on angel radio.”
“All talk, no action.” She fluttered her eyelashes. “You need my advice, which, by the way, will consist of whacking you upside the head and tell you to forking go for it already. But go on.”
His fingers played with Dean’s on the bench seat between them. Allowing that action and the many others that platonic friends generally didn’t do, it didn’t freak him out anymore. Hadn’t for months now. So why was he freaking out at this one last step? Well, really, a few steps: kissing, the L-word, and possibly, maybe, sex. But he thought if he could do one, he’d be able to make the rest happen too. If he could conquer the fear that he’d take things too far only for them to fall apart later, he’d be golden. But that fear … it was a doozy, and he didn’t know how to get over it, even after Charlie’s pep talk.
This time, though, he found he was ready to reenter the world after just a day. That was progress, wasn’t it? All those discussions on feelings he and Cas had been having lately, they must be working at least a little. He felt like if he could just get over this last hump, they’d be golden. Cas would know how Dean felt, and they’d be able to really start living their lives. If only he could do that one last thing …
get better, if it’s the last thing Dean does—so he isn’t going to let himself get used to this, even as he revels in this temporary closeness between them. Cas just needs physical comfort right now, like Sammy when he had the flu as a kid, it has nothing to do with feelings he might possibly (but probably does not) harbor for Dean.
After that, they don’t even try sleeping apart. Cas is less grumpy, and truth be told, so is Dean. Sam watches them with a knowing eye but says nothing, thank goodness. He can be an annoying little shit most of the time, but sometimes he’s not half bad.
He texts the others, and when Dean arrives a few minutes after Cas, Sam has researched enough to develop at least a basic theory.
Cas slumps onto the seat across from him, still frowning. He shakes his head no and stares into his coffee like it holds the world’s secrets. Wouldn’t that be nice? Dean’d love to get a break for once. He’s tired of angels, demons, gods, and whatever other big bads are waiting in the woodwork to come after them. He’d really love to just hunt a fucking rugaru for once.
“Of Kevin or of the latest Claire spotting?” Cas asked as they walked onto the practice mat. Not that either really needed a soft landing pad, but it was nice fighting on something with no tree roots to trip them up or hard concrete to face plant on. Dean swung the first punch, and they were off.
“That angel couldn’t have bonded with anyone but you. He’s been following you around like a puppy since the Lucifer ordeal. Hell, he built you from the soul up and marked you with his own handprint. You two already have a bond deeper than any two humans have, and most certainly more than any angel and human. I have a feeling that if you asked him, Cas would tell you that the ritual wouldn’t have even worked if there wasn’t some measure of compatibility between the two of you.”
They work as a team, and they joke like they only do when it’s just the two of them, and when they sit down to eat, the air around them is soft and warm. Dean is telling a story, and it takes him six minutes to realize he hasn’t eaten a single bite. Castiel teases him gently for it. After they finish, Castiel thinks it’s time.
He pulled the leftovers from the fridge, opened the lid, and sniffed. Smelled okay. And angel mojo seemed to be doing a decent job keeping him in good health, when he wasn’t pretending it didn’t exist, so he probably wouldn’t die from it, or even puke from food poisoning. He decided to chance it, and threw it in the microwave to heat. He found the bread and cut off a huge slice, then went hunting for whatever else he could find. All he could scrounge up was an apple, and while it wasn’t in pie form, it was better than nothing. When the microwave beeped, he brought everything over to the table and dug in. After a while, he realized it was awfully quiet, and he looked up to see Cas and Sam staring at him—Sam with his usual “Dean is a pig” disgusted expression, and Cas in confusion, mixed with a slight interest, which was new.
Dean interrupts his thoughts by shoving some clothes in his face. Castiel leans back and stares first at the bundle, then up at Dean.
Cas picks at the edges of the book cover. “What if this is something that’s never happened before? We might not be able to find an answer.”
“What the hell,” he mumbles to himself, but it’s plucked from his fingers before he can look more. He glances up to see Cas stuffing it into his trench coat that’s crumpled on the floor. He connects the dots. “Cas? Is that your feather?”
“It’s odd that I’ve never heard of such a ritual,” Cas said through the bad connection. It sounded to Dean like he was in a tunnel.
“If not, we’ve got lots of guest rooms to choose from,” Dean added, dropping Cas’s hand and standing up. “But I made my famous chili, so you really don’t want to miss out.”
And Dean was right, it’s nice to have a place to call his own. He keeps his few possessions on the shelf and bedside table. It’s nice seeing them, instead of having them hidden away until they’re needed. Now, he can pick them up, run his fingers over them, turn them over in his hands, and let himself think about why he keeps them. He places his new laptop neatly on his desk, along with a framed picture of him, Dean, and Sam. He keeps his favorite books on the shelf above the bed. He places his few extra clothes that he’s picked up over the years in the dresser. He has a special drawer in his bedside table just for the mixtapes Dean’s given to him, along with an ancient Walkman to listen to them with. And on the door, he’d sticks a carefully crafted sign that reads “Castiel’s room – Do not enter.” He’s seen it on people’s bedroom doors in movies, and he likes it. Dean had said it was his space, and he wants to make sure everyone knows that. Sam had looked confused the first time he noticed it and told him only kids did that, but Dean had slung an arm over Castiel’s shoulder and said that it was charmingly human and that he liked it, so Castiel didn’t take it down. And now when he sees the sign, he remembers the warmth he felt from Dean’s arm around him, and that soft, fond smile on his face—so rare these days, and all the more precious for it.
Dean was edgy the entire drive back, which was not unheard of after a big fight, and was less surprising when coupled with the angel mojo running through him. He tapped repeatedly on the wheel until Sam gives him bitchface for the third time, so he cranked the radio and sang along with AC/DC for the rest of the (thankfully short) trip.
Castiel has been molting for almost a month when Dean points out that it seems to be slowing. He’s been grumbling for days that he doesn’t understand how mostly burnt and mangled wings can have so many feathers, and Castiel has to explain that just because the projection shows only two wings does not mean that’s all he has. Dean takes the news with his usual aplomb, but he seems relieved when the shedding slows.
Sam comes into the kitchen and grabs his own lunch, and after some meaningless chatter, they decide to play board games, because apparently it’s preposterous that Castiel has never done so (though who would he have played them with, if not the Winchester brothers? They are his family). They hang out in the library the rest of the afternoon with Scattergories (Castiel wins), Risk (Sam), and Trivial Pursuit (Dean), then close it out with Parcheesi, which absolutely none of them understand and so no one wins. They drink a few beers and make nachos, and it’s the most at home Castiel has felt since he arrived at the bunker, apart from his nights with Dean. He never wants this warm, comfortable feeling to end, and when he looks deep into Dean’s eyes, he thinks he sees that feeling reflected there.
Whoa, words were actually said, folks. Are you as surprised as I am? Probably not, if you’re reading a fic you know has a happy ending. But whatever, it’s still fun getting there, isn’t it?
Both of the others looked at him in confusion, but neither asked him to explain, knowing too well where that rabbit hole could go.
clothes. He also kept his eyes firmly on the blanket covering his legs, just in case Cas didn’t twinkle his way into the new clothes rather than putting them on the human way. However, with that now-familiar tingle at the back of his brain and the more familiar flap of wings, Cas was out of his uniform and into a Fleetwood Mac t-shirt and gray pants, and he was sitting on the bed.
Cas hummed. “True. But I think it was down to you that any of this worked. You wished so hard for a home that when the possibility presented itself, you fought for it. You made the bunker a home, rather than just a place to sleep at night. The comfort you imbued the space with made Claire and Kevin seek us out.”
“No. I mean, no adult clothes. Keep those jammies on, sport. It’s like a snow day without the snow.”
list. He wasn’t Sam, the big dork. Of course, if he’d had a real list, he wouldn’t have forgotten socks this time.
“It’s not like you’ve read every book the world, man. If you did, you’d understand my Harry Potter references.” Dean tucked his phone between his ear and shoulder so he could rifle through his bag. He knew he’d packed socks. He always packed socks. They were right up there with underwear and rock salt on his Hunt Necessities list. No, he didn’t have an
“Whatever, Sam. Basically, we probably won’t still be hunting the next time this guy rolls into town, and I’d like to take care of it myself. It’s a bitch to fight, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”
As if reading Sam’s mind, Cas glances toward the corridor leading to the bedrooms, where Dean currently sleeps. He opens his mouth and closes it again without speaking.
“Apparently being angel married means we gotta touch every so often, otherwise the bond freaks out,” Dean said, gruffer than he wanted, but he was still annoyed at this whole shitshow and couldn’t keep the feeling out of his voice. Cas pulled away slightly, and Dean hated the feeling of loss the bond was forcing on him. He could miss Cas well enough on his own; he didn’t need a bond to pile it on more.
“Come on, twitchy, we’re going for a walk,” Dean announces the next afternoon. Cas has been complaining crankily for the last ten minutes that the library chairs are uncomfortable (he’s not wrong), and if Dean reads another word, the English language will cease to have any meaning to him. Unlike the past two mornings, sleep failed to settle a restless Cas this morning.
“Me?” Cas still looks stunned, and Sam has to admit he’s enjoying watching it. It’s kind of endearing when it’s not completely frustrating.
Castiel wakes feeling completely relaxed, which is apparently a thing now. He’d felt much the same when he’d woken yesterday, in the three seconds before Dean bolted from the bed like it was filled with bees (or just Castiel). The thought makes him frown, and he banishes it. No unhappy thoughts right now, not when he feels so nice. He knows that it’s Dean pressed up against him that makes him feel so safe and warm. He tells himself he can have five more seconds to soak up the feeling before he pulls away, but before he can move, there’s a rumble under his ear, which is apparently pressed on top of Dean’s chest.
Sam was trying to explain Scooby Doo to a confused Cas when Dean returned, waving the packets triumphantly. “Mochas, anyone?”
They stopped at the fridge and then went to sit at the kitchen table while Dean expounded on the roadside attractions they’d been able to hit on the way back home. Once Dean had exhausted his pictures, he gave a quick rundown of the hunt, which Sam noted down for the archives he was building onto.
Dean is trying to remember if he’s ever heard of something similar when there’s a thump on the bottom of his seat. A few seconds later it comes again. He glares in the rearview mirror. Cas is fidgeting
“Dean, I have no experience with human clothing, other than what I’m currently wearing. I don’t know what ‘seems comfortable.’”
Claire showed up two days after Kevin. Dean and Kevin had just finished a session at the shooting range—if he was going to live at the bunker, he needed to have at least the basics of gun safety and use—and they had decided to head to the library where Dean knew Cas was. He’d felt a ping of surprise through the connection earlier, but since Cas sometimes got very excited over books, Dean hadn’t thought much of it.
see them. The blast that accompanies an angel’s death completely charrs all of the feathers. The black, wing-shaped outline you see is the ashes from the feathers.”
She settled back in her own chair, crossed her legs, and transferred her gaze to Cas, who met her stare head on.
Dean and Cas stop staring at each other goofily just long enough to roll their eyes and give Sam the stink eye. But Dean ducks his head in that shy way he somehow still has, even after all they’ve been through and seen and done. Cas bites his lip to hold back a grin, but it doesn’t work. Then the two of them are laughing. Sam just shakes his head, but he smiles and kicks his brother’s foot.
Cas lowered his gaze to his lap. The move alerted Dean to the fact that his own hand on his knee was covered by Cas’s hand. He jerked back in surprise and frowned up at Cas, who blushed. Wait, blushed? Angels didn’t blush. They were shameless, and emotionless. Well, Cas had feelings now, but he’d yet to come close to blushing or showing other physical discomfort.
He had to admit it was nice, doing this domestic morning thing with someone. Sam was a run-at-dawn, gulp-down-a-smoothie kind of guy most mornings they stayed at the bunker, which made Dean sad. One of his few clear memories of Mary Winchester was her making pancakes on Saturday mornings—chocolate chip with whip cream if she was in a particularly generous mood—and he missed having that with someone. And sure, Cas wouldn’t eat the pancakes, but he’d sit at the table and hold a mug of fragrant coffee while they chatted about whatever. Yeah, it was definitely nice.
“We were about to sit down for dinner. Are you hungry?” he asked. If they could get her to stay a few days, they might have more success persuading her to stop hunting and settle down.
“Ohhhh.” She nodded knowingly. “Angels are asexual. Makes sense.” She wrinkled her nose. “Cas doesn’t exactly seem like a normal angel, though. His face is way more expressive than it was the first time I met him. Not to mention I was his vessel for a hot second, and he’s definitely more emotional now. But whatever. You do you, dude. Who am I to tell boyfriends how to have a relationship.”
“Then shut your piehole, walk around the path a few times, get your head out of your ass, and come back when you’re done pouting, okay?”
“Greedy,” Dean teased, leaning up to kiss his cheek. “I think the rest … just as or if it comes up. We won’t ask anyone to keep it quiet, but I don’t think we need to start each phone call with ‘by the way, me and Cas are shacking up now.’ And I’m not sure how much I want knowledge of the bond to get out. It could be dangerous, since we still don’t know much about it.”
Kevin nodded. “Yeah, I’m here in my capacity as a nerd who has had a couple of brushes with the supernatural and now can’t just go back to my ‘normal’ life.”
Finally, Cas rescued him. “Dean?” he asked, coming to stand in Sam’s door. He looked concerned. Must’ve felt something through the bond.
“Oh, hey, there you two are.” Sam walked into the map room and nodded at them. “Did you have trouble on the drive back? I expected you hours ago.”
They don’t talk about the nights they shared a bed at the motel, and they haven’t repeated the setup since they returned to the bunker. And Dean hates it. He misses the warmth and comfort of a bed companion—or if he’s being honest, he just plain misses Cas.
Cas pulled the chair away slowly, as if he wasn’t sure he’d heard Dean correctly. After the chair was back in the corner, he looked at Dean again in question, and Dean nodded before realizing Cas was pulling at his shirt collar again. “Wait, change out of that ridiculous accountant-in-the-rain get-up and put on some normal clothes first. I’m uncomfortable just looking at you.”
(God, he hated that word; cuddling was what puppies did), he’d begun to just accept whatever new aspect cropped up between them, no matter how much he’d have shied from it a mere year ago. Amazing what being magically bonded to another being did for your sense of normalcy.
.” Dean took hold of Cas’s face and turned it to face him, then he let his fingers play at his features like he’d been aching to do for so long. “Castiel, I love you. Like,
“No!” Seemingly surprised by his own intensity, Cas paused, then tried again. “I don’t fit in Heaven anymore. I’m not sure I ever did. I played the obedient son and soldier, but something always felt like it was missing. It wasn’t until I came to Earth that I began to understand. We angels were made to love and revere humanity, and somewhere in Heaven’s single-mindedness to defeat Hell, we forgot that. I love humanity and Earth, and I think I belong here now. I probably always did.”
“Fine. Whatever. Let’s just, um, you know, uh, breakfast?” Well. that came out great. Dean grabs his keys and heads for the door, not looking to see if he’s being followed. Breakfast by himself might be a good idea anyway.
By evening, Dean was tired of waiting for the inevitable conversation, and so when everyone split up for some free time after dinner, he told Cas he wanted to catch up with Charlie alone, and that he’d come find him when they were done. This was a conversation he needed to focus on, and not worry about Cas walking in and hearing something Dean wasn’t ready for him to hear.
Well, Cas, at least, doesn’t feel those things for Dean. Dean’s own feelings for his best friend are a little more complicated. Okay, fine, they’re like every single drama-filled romantic plot on
As they neared the library entrance, Dean picked up on a higher-pitched voice than he was used to hearing in the bunker, and they walked in to find Claire and Cas talking at the library table.
“Ah, no. No version of … sex is required for the bond. Just some physical connection, I would say skin to skin. Hand holding,” Cas added after seeing Dean’s still panicked expression,” should be enough.”
Sam leans forward to look Cas in the eyes. “But seriously, you won’t be a burden. You hunt and research, same as we do, and you’ve got way more lore knowledge and language skills than Dean and I combined. Plus, we’ve chosen you as part of our family. That should clue you in to how much we like you. All you need to do to stay here is be yourself.”
Sam stifles a laugh. He kind of loves how Cas can rile him up without even trying. And anything that pushes at Dean’s distorted ideas of masculinity is a win in Sam’s book.
Dean glanced at Sam, who for once didn’t look constipated at the bunker being called home. Instead, he nodded at Dean. Dean grinned back. “Cas did his part too, putting up with our dumb asses and schlepping furniture around.”
“Nah. Sam, you take the car. I think we’ll fly.” Dean kissed Cas again. “I need my angel to take me home and ravish me right now.”
Dean shook head and went back to the pancakes. “You’re too much, you know that, angel? Just don’t feel like you need to, for my sake. I’m likely to turn into a lazy son of a bitch if you pamper me too much.” He shot Cas a wink at that last bit, then grabbed the whisk to mix up the batter.
Dean keeps cleaning up the bunker, and it’s almost three weeks after their last hunt before he thinks of the term “nesting.” He laughs to himself at how true it seems to be, but he keeps doing it. It makes him feel good, making this place more of a home for his family. His culinary skills, already pretty decent after living in the bunker for several years, improve even more with his constant cooking and baking, and Sam complains about having to run more to keep the weight off, though he doesn’t stop eating three helpings of everything.
“Maybe soon I won’t wake up being poked by these infernal feathers in my bed,” he grumbles as he gathers up the night’s new feathers from their nest of blankets.
monster. It’ll go into hibernation after tonight, and the next chance to gank it is in like four hundred years.”
Dean flipped him off as he bent to scrape some paint off the trap. Cas sighed and stepped out of it, but he didn’t touch Dean. Instead he studied him with a frown, as if trying to read his soul.
” warred with Garth’s much more enthusiastic “that’s great, you guys!” (including hugs) and Jody’s more sedate but still warm “congratulations.” The adults were spread out in the library, relaxing with drinks while waiting for the kids to finish dinner.
room. She came and went as she pleased, and yeah, he considered her family now, and always welcomed her in the bunker, but he didn’t know she felt the same. He always thought she considered them a waystation. A practical (and free) place to sleep and eat between jobs.
“Do you want to tell your brother? And Kevin?” Cas asked later, when they lay blissed out in bed, more intertwined than usual, following a spectacular make-out session that had proceeded to spectacular sex.
“Humans are annoying,” is what comes out, even though Castiel had wanted to say how good it is to see them. He’d been in neighborhoods with the houses that all look exactly alike and were too clean on the inside, and everyone was fake polite, and it reminds him of Heaven, which is the last place he wants to be reminded of. But this motel room is closer to what home feels like. No, being near Dean is what makes it feel like home. Why he doesn’t say that, he doesn’t know. Probably because he doesn’t want to deal with Dean getting his hackles up over such an emotional statement. He can’t cope with that right now. He just wants to relax. He loosens his tie and unbuttons the first two buttons of his shirt.
“Nah, I think I’ve got enough room for your two pairs of fuzzy socks and three items of clothing,” Dean replied sarcastically. The dude was a really easy roommate to have. “You want me to put your books on the shelves while you do your clothes?”
And Cas—gorgeous, amazing, ridiculous, smart, clueless angel who had changed Dean’s life in the best of ways—simply smiled and answered “yes.” Like it was nothing. And everything.
Sam nods with extra earnestness. “Oh yeah. Major yearning. It’s pretty pathetic. I mean, not that you’re not great or that I don’t want you two to be happy, but holy shit, the dude is a bit codependent. He has no chill.”
Not wanting his eyes to stray back to Cas’s body, Dean nudged him back to the changing room. “Git back in there. Let’s see what else you’ve got.”
“You’re definitely old enough. Also, you’re not-dating-but-maybe-married-to the guy using the vessel that was my dad, so …” She shrugged, then looked faintly alarmed. “Also, ew, he’s a billion years old? So, he saw, like, when Earth formed? That is the grossest age gap
With the largest crowd they’d had at the bunker yet, Dean decided to go all out on dinner that night. They had burgers with lots of fancy topping choices, homemade fries, Caesar salads for the rabbits, and blueberry crumble for dessert. Cas helped with the veg chopping and made the croutons for the salad. Dean loved that they worked in the kitchen together almost as well as they fought bad guys together. There was a fluidity to their movements around each other that predated the bond that just made him plain happy. He’d get in the zone and just
bed?” Dean’s voice is even higher now. “You- You’re getting the pillow all wet. And you took all the sheets.”
Dean still wasn’t sure what to think of those two. Claire had obviously recovered from hating him, but Cas still felt extremely guilty for what he’d done to her family, and she definitely felt that on some level. So far, they were going for politely distant. It’d be interesting to see where it went from there, though.
“How do I know what clothing matches my personality?” Cas asked, looking overwhelmed at the racks of clothes in front of them. They’d wandered the store a bit before finding the men’s section and were now standing between the shirts and jeans racks.
Sam’s eyebrows go up. “Oh yeah, I guess you did. I suppose I sort of … forget that? To me, you were just my brother. But yeah, it wasn’t like Dad was really raising us.”
Sam surreptitiously watches the pair through the first episode of the show. They keep a respectful amount of space between them for the first twenty minutes or so, but then Dean gets up to grab Cas a pair of socks, and when he settles back down, they’re closer together. Cas gets up ten minutes later to make more tea, and when he sits again, the space between them is gone. Sam gets up after the episode is over because he remembers a book in his room that might help them out, and when he returns, Cas’s head is on Dean’s shoulder, and his knees are tucked up against his chest as he twitches his shoulders in involuntary irritation. The next time he glances over, Dean’s arm is over Cas’s shoulder, and his hand sweeps slowly up and down Cas’s arm. Sam keeps his thoughts to himself, but he smiles down at his book. He thinks they’ll be okay.
Claire shrugged at Cas’s words. Were her only expressions shrug, smirk, and eyeroll? Well, she was a teenager, so probably.
The fucker snatching people ends up being a minor protection deity who settles in a place and helps it out until something goes FUBAR and he gets mad. Then he takes a whole bunch of people and moves on to the next town. Apparently, he needs the connection from a current group of people before he can form a new one in a new town, hence the kidnapping before he moves on. He zaps them with some hypno-whatever, and they become his adoring public in his new home. Pretty fucked up, if you ask Dean, but he won’t be a problem anymore. They take him out with a stake formed from a tree of his homeland (aka, Kansas City) and are back at the motel by midnight, covered in god goo (ew).
Dean waved his hands. “Wait, what? I thought this ritual was specifically meant to be between an angel and human. How are there no accounts of it?”
“Sounds good. Be there soon.” He turned his head and placed a quick kiss on the palm of Dean’s hand, then let go.
“I cheated a little,” Cas confessed. “I wasn’t always available to make it by hand, so sometimes I just set it up from afar and asked it to start brewing when you woke up.” He looked worried, and that just wouldn’t do.
He’s relieved to have a case to focus on, but getting there is a trial. He feels cramped in the small backseat space, and his shirt is rough on his skin, and the sun is too hot. But he squirms when Dean suggests he make his own way there. The thought of being so far from Dean for any protracted length of time makes him want to curl up in a ball.
“Yeah. ‘Course. That’s way smarter.” Dean rubbed his eyes, and realized he was tired. The power nap on the garage floor had helped in the short term, but it wasn’t a full night’s sleep. Not that he’d had one of those in years. But it’d be nice to conk out for a few hours at least.
“You use a bow and arrow then?” he asked, trying to feel out her style. “Not a fan myself, but some hunters make it work.”
Uncomfortable with the amount of feels he was feeling, Dean pointed to the cup. “Drink your tea, nerd.”
. He’d already said it. But he suddenly felt like a blushing Catholic school girl. Fuck this whole situation. It was. So. Messed. Up.
“Yeah, ‘course. Just Bobby mother henning, like he does. Even if we quit hunting today, he’d find a way to worry about cancer or lightning strikes or something else just as unlikely to hurt us.” Dean opened a cardboard box with his free hand and peeked inside. It looked like a hand of glory, so he grimaced and closed the box again. “Any luck in the archives?”
He avoids the thought and watches the fields flash by out of the window. Watching the scenery is soothing, usually. Meditative. He can ordinarily tune out the Winchesters’ talk and Dean’s music du jour and allow it to become background noise to think by. It makes him happy and feel a part of something. But today—or for the last few weeks to be honest—every noise and touch maddens him to no end. The men’s voices are grating, the car rumbles under him in a way that makes his skin crawl, the music beats atonally against his ear drums. Even the Legos rattling in the vent, a sound that’s good for at least one fond smile, bother him.
“I’ll get it booked. I assume you want to drive, not fly? Fly with your wings, that is. I’m not flying in a tin can.”
Dean thinks a minute. “Huh. I mean, I’ve been making him nap when he gets extra cranky lately, but yeah, he doesn’t usually just conk out on his own.”
“Well, ya look good, man. I cannot tell you how long I’ve wanted to get you out of those damn clothes.”
Dean waved to Sam and put his phone on speaker. Sam lit the incense (they’d smell like patchouli for fucking days after this, on top of swamp smell) and held up the book.
“I’d rather not, thanks.” Dean tried to stand to go search for more alcohol, but Cas grabbed his arm to stop him. A rush of …
“Why d’you get embarrassed when you see your feathers?” Dean asks. He likes seeing them, seeing a part of Cas that he’s never been able to before, even if the sight reminds him that there’s something wrong.
“Yeah, well, until we figure out what’s going on, that will have to do. I can’t watch you squirm anymore.”
“And you?” Dean reloaded his gun, pointed to the earmuffs, and squeezed off the round. They lowered their ear protection again.
“Geeze. Right, okay. It’s …” he rubbed his brow, then went back to his work. It’d be easier while not looking at them. “So, about six months back, Sam and I were on a hunt for this weird yeti-cabra hybrid, and nothing we tried worked on it. By the time we each had a host of injuries from fighting the damn thing, we decided to resort to magic.”
. So excuse me for not wanting to try again, okay? Just …” he sighed and shrugged. “Just let me live my life how I want to.”
“I am not watching you two make moon eyes at each other for the five-hour drive back home, you know.”
His automatic defense system in place, Dean dropped Cas’s hand like it was a hot brick as soon as he saw Sam come around the corner. And by the time he realized how Cas might take the move—that’d he’d think Dean was ashamed of touching him—it was too late to grab it again. Shit.
Dean choked on air. “What the fuck, Cas? One, that’s not an estimate, that’s throwing numbers against a wall and seeing what sticks, and two, how can you say that so casually? We’re going to be angel handcuffed together for some unknown amount of time, and you act like we’re discussing where to go for taco Tuesday. This is our fucking lives we’re talking about here. You can’t just act like it’s no biggie.”
The odd words, still rumbling against his ear, surprise him enough to make him do as asked. Dean gazes down at him from where he lies higher up at the head of the bed. Castiel is curled into him, and his head lies on Dean’s chest. A warm, comforting hand sweeps up his back.
Sam had noticed Cas and Dean sniping at each other more than usual starting a few weeks back, but he’d thought it was either avoidance of the sexual tension that the two were intent on ignoring or irritability at being stuck at the bunker without anything to do. But then Sam had noticed the little twitches Cas does when he sits still for more than a few minutes, and the way he hunches his shoulders when Dean and Sam’s voices get above a whisper, and the way that he’s become so clingy, especially with Dean. It’s more than chafing at inactivity. He’d started looking for a case so that he could see what happened once Cas had something to do besides mope around the bunker. If his complaints about the backseat weren’t enough, the nap for the second half of the drive sealed it. And now his clothes and distraction. Something is really wrong with Cas. He wonders if they’d be better off giving the case to another hunter and going back to the bunker to focus on researching angels.
Sam feels his brows rise. “Really?” He doesn’t think he’d ever want to become immortal, but that isn’t something an already-immortal being has to contend with, so immortality probably doesn’t seem as unendingly boring to an angel. But angel powers kinda rock, so he’s surprised Cas would give that up.
“Find anything?” He yawned, reluctantly let go of Cas’s hand, and stretched. When he finished, his right hand landed very close to where Cas’s left lay on the bed between them, though he didn’t grab it again—no need to get greedy.
“Sure, Sammy. Oh,” Dean snapped his fingers. “Change in plan. Focus on effects of the bond, rather than trying to break it.”
“It’ll be good for you,” he added, trying to lighten the mood a bit. “I mean, I finally talked to Cas, and that ended up with a spectacular …” he glanced at her, “make-out session.”
Dean really was a damn ogre, wasn’t he? “I really do want you around. When I say I need some space, I mean just for a little while. I’ve always been like this. I learned to find little hideaways when me and Sammy were cooped up in a single motel room, waiting for Dad to come back from a hunt. Sometimes I can be a little bit of an introvert, ya know? I just need some peace and quiet to recharge for a minute. It’s not about you at all. Promise. So, what do you say we go on a bookshelf hunt, huh? And then maybe you can help me search the storage rooms to make sure there are no angel books layin’ around?”
Claire shrugged, reloading her own gun. She was getting pretty good at it. Way more comfortable with funs than she’d been the first couple of times they’d gone to the range.
“I always make it all the way home only to realize I forgot toothpaste,” Dean muttered defensively. “Cas thought a list might help.”
“I’m … feeling much better today. My new feathers are coming in, and while I’m still not sure I’ll ever be able to fly again, the irritation is gone, and I don’t feel fatigued anymore. I think I can transition back to normal life now.” He thinks it’s a good way to begin, so that Dean understands that his feelings are his own, and not something caused by the molting or otherwise stemming from a biological imperative.
Taking his own advice, Dean dug into his combo plate and groaned in food ecstasy. “Oh yeah, that hits the spot. Cas, you gotta try to this falafel. It’s amazing.”
“Cas, you don’t get hot. You don’t feel discomfort at all. At least, you’ve never thought to tell us if you did.”
“My taste buds seem to be interacting with the world the same way my temperature receptors are. I can … actually taste the coffee now.” He frowned at the mug. “I don’t think I like it. It tastes nothing like it smells.” He set the mug on the table and pushed it away, still frowning. “Why are there so many Starbucks if that’s how coffee tastes?”
Cas keeps to his side, wrapping himself up like a burrito the same as he’d done the night before. He sighs and wriggles. A few minutes later, he wriggles again. And again.
“Well, if we could take a moment to talk about the other reason we’re all here, today,” began Jody, looking around. “I have to say this place is looking pretty spiffy, boys. Considering it was closed up for decades, what you’ve managed to do in just a few months is amazing.”
He straightens up and holds out a hand. Castiel takes it tentatively, not used to such a gesture. He likes it, though, so he doesn’t question it. Dean pulls him out of the car and stays in place as Castiel stretches and orients himself. He wonders when Dean stopped caring about the lack of space between them, but again, he doesn’t question it. And for the first time in weeks, he feels calm, relaxed. He smiles up at Dean, whose eyes are soft and bracketed by the crow’s feet Castiel loves.
with a shaved head). Sam gave him a few funny looks every time Dean passed by his library table, where he was
“I’m fine, Dean. I’ll be fine. I’ve been checking my grace reserves. There’s an infinitesimal amount flowing to you, but it’s being replaced as usual by my connection to Heaven. And I won’t fall because of this bond. If I was going to, it would have happened immediately. I’m more worried what my grace will do to you. There’s no record of anything close to this being performed on a human before. I’ll need to watch you closely for the next few months. I hope that the amount of grace you’re in contact with is so small that it won’t affect you any more than my healing you would. I expect that your wounds will heal much faster, if not immediately from now on.”
“Pied is an old word for multicolored, it derives from the same root as magpie, from the Latin,” Cas explains, and for once, he doesn’t seem annoyed. Sam has noticed that any time the two of them are separated, Cas is initially happy to see Dean again. He wonders if there’s a link from the spell—or whatever has a hold of Cas—to Dean, or if it’s just Cas’s instinct to feel most comfortable around Dean. Either is just as likely. He’s keeping a list of questions to research once they’re done with this hunt.
Dean dropped his head back and scrunched his face up. “Yes, absolutely.” Cas was a great dude, but he worried too much. Dean caught a glance at the setting sun in the window and swore. “Cas, we gotta do this
“I’m not walking over a hundred miles,” he says, arms still crossed and his lip sticking out like a petulant (word of the day, score) four-year-old.
This is me making a lazy effort at a case fic while also making Sam watch these two idiots pine a lot.
Dean nods with pink cheeks. “Thanks,” he mumbles, and when Cas slides a hand over his, he turns his own over to lock their fingers together.
“Yes, I think I’d like that.” Cas gave him a small smile, touched his wrist, and opened the car door. Dean followed.
. He wouldn’t be able to forgive himself if his being a weak human weakened Cas in return. That wasn’t fair. It wasn’t an even exchange. If Dean got super strength, Cas should get something good in return, though what that might be, Dean had no clue.
“No, it’s a tale that began during the plague years,” Cas argues. “But rats have nothing to do with this case.”
For the first time since he was four years old, Dean finally felt like he had a place to call home. There’d been Bobby’s place, but they’d visited only rarely, so that wasn’t quite it. But the bunker, it was his. No, it was
Dean paused from whatever quip he wanted to blurt out to relax the tension in the room. Fuck, there Cas went again,
“Yeah, no, got that.” He contorted his head until he could see Cas’s face. “Why would you think that? You were here a while ago when you gave me that mind-blowing orgasm, right?”
And now that he was out and they were together, he was having a hard time keeping it in. He’d almost blurted it out to Bobby twice, and he’d accidentally told Garth a story that implied that he and Cas were together, but since Garth knew about the bond, the implication went right by him. He could’ve told them both on the phone, and they’d have been plenty pleased about it, but he wanted to do this in person, formal like.
Cas hummed. Following his instinct, Dean placed a soft kiss on his bondmate’s head. His hair was soft and smelled like home—like the air before it rains, old books, gun oil, and fresh baked bread. It was the first time his lips had touched Cas in any way, and he wondered why he’d been avoiding it when it felt so natural. He didn’t even question if that was just the bond talking. The bond was them, and they were the bond; it came from their needs and emotions, not from some unseen hand playing them like chess pieces. He closed his eyes and let Cas’s calming presence lull him to sleep.
“Never said I was gonna watch the movie. Watching you two squabble during a movie is much more entertaining. I might make popcorn.”
As if conjured, Cas opened the door to the room. He looked slightly confused to find them sitting on the cold, hard floor, but he merely held his hand out, which Dean took and allowed himself to be hauled up. Dean did the same for Claire, then he turned and hugged Cas, sighing as the bond calmed him. The bond was great, and he loved the feeling that came over him when he first touched Cas after time apart, but it’d be really great to finally be able to have heart-to-hearts with someone that could last longer than half an hour.
types of bets? Not cool. Just for that, Cas and I are making out the rest of the night, and you have to watch.”
“Umm.” Sam’s face morphed from determined to squirrely, his eyes darting to the side and his fingers tapping on the book he was still holding. “We’ve maybe got just a
“Well, no, because they’re all different foods. But I guess if you liked the spices, try the gyro meat.”
Dean sighed, trying to gather himself. Knowing the nerd twins, he figured he had eight minutes at most before Cas and Sam showed up. He’d need to keep this brief. He turned to get the loaf of bread for slicing, when he saw Claire and Kevin standing stock still, watching him with avid interest.
“What are we, a halfway house for wannabe hunters?” Dean muttered, leading the wide-eyed teen down the stairs and alerting Cas to their visitor.
Dean and Sam make Cas go last in the shower. Sam is already passed out by the time Dean finishes cleaning up, and he crawls under the covers while Cas shuts himself in the bathroom. He tries to make himself fall asleep before Cas gets back, which shouldn’t be hard given how long the dude spends under a showerhead these days, but twenty minutes later, he’s still restless and twitchy. It’s always been hard for him to fall asleep after a hunt, but he’d been really hoping for a miracle this time. If he can avoid being awake, then he won’t be forced to lodge a protest when Cas crawls into his bed later. And he has to protest, because … well, because he
Castiel shuts the door, not letting himself think of what it’d be like to have Dean burst in on him naked in the shower.
He wasn’t even sure why Cas was acting so hurt. He had to be as pissed at this whole thing as Dean was, maybe more. At least Dean got increased strength and speed. What did Cas get out of it? A babysitting job, a bond with a useless human, and even more problems to worry about. It wasn’t exactly even-steven.
“Ah, yes. Heaven isn’t particularly happy with me these days, and I find more fulfilment in helping humans here on Earth. As a hunter yourself, I’m sure you understand that drive.”
he know Cas was alright? He wasn’t sure, but the knowledge sat firm in him all the same. Cas was perfectly safe. He frowned at his brother. “What went wrong? Did you say the words wrong?”
be happy. He was already uncomfortable with doing this …” Dean leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hand over his eyes. He hoped it didn’t hurt, but it’d likely burn him up from the inside out, like Cas had worried it would do. Not pleasant, based on what he’d seen from Pamela’s eyes getting seared out of their sockets when she saw Cas’s true form, a million years ago, before he realized angels even existed.
By the time he’d pulled out the pie—smelling amazing, if he did say so himself—and set it on the counter to cool, Sam and Cas had found the empty shelves: tall, real wood shelves, sturdy and with a nice stain on them. They really didn’t make things like they used to. These days they’d have to hunt high and low and pay out the nose for quality like that. Quality was heavy though, and they needed all three of them to transfer the chosen shelf from storage to the bedroom.
“Hmm,” Dean hums. “I used to rub Sammy’s back when he got sick as a kid. I dunno that it actually helps anything, but I guess the contact can be comforting.”
“Uh, yeah. If it’s just me and him, he doesn’t eat, he doesn’t talk just to talk, he definitely doesn’t sleep. He just does the angel stare or reads. Usually, he wanders off to find you, especially these last few weeks.”
Thanks so much to everyone who read my fluffy little story. I really love the bond trope and the magically stuck together trope, and as I started writing, this whole home-family subplot sort of inserted itself on its own. I hope it worked out for y'all. :)
What does it all mean? It’s as if a switch flipped last night, and the defensiveness that’s powered Dean’s every move for his whole life is gone. He’s stopped shying from being close to Castiel, he winks at him, he doesn’t defend himself when Sam sees them touching, and he lets Castiel keep the clothes that have brought him comfort even though they’re his favorites. He’s not a completely different man, because he’s always been caring to those around him. It’s more like he’s letting his real self out now. He’s letting Castiel and Sam finally see the real him, one hundred percent. But is it more than that? Is it just comfort, the same as he’d provide Sam if he were ill? Or is it something else, something just for Castiel?
Dean leans back and lifts a corner of his mouth like he’s trying to hold back a smile. “I reckon that’d annoy anyone. But that doesn’t explain the sleeping or you shedding clothes like a stripper.”
Cas came out a few moments later wearing a t-shirt, flannel shirt, and jeans. It was weird seeing Cas in patterned clothes, and the green and blue of the flannel was so different from his drab suit and trench coat. It didn’t look
He choked on air, then pointed a finger at her. “No. One, you’re thirteen, you can’t make sex jokes. Two, that’s not- we’re not- it’s not like that for us.”
And that’s a strange thought. He does enjoy being around Dean and Sam, and he’s always very happy to see them after some time apart, but he also enjoys being alone sometimes. He likes silence, time to think and be. He’s an independent being with his own interests and needs. He is capable of operating a vehicle and enjoys drives by himself. So why does the thought of being away from Dean for only a few hours fill him with anxiety?
He tried to distract himself with strategizing and then gun practice. He and Cas sparred, but only briefly, since he couldn’t concentrate. When Cas asked what was wrong, Dean waved it off and decided to go make a loaf of sourdough. Cas followed but sat at the kitchen worktop with a book rather than helping. But that part was at least pretty normal. Dean liked the calming rhythms of breadmaking. It was like meditation, and he liked to do it by himself, as much as he loved cooking with Cas. Once the dough was rising under a towel, they joined the others in the library. Everyone was in separate corners, doing their own thing, which suited Dean’s mood just fine. He picked up a book on medieval fighting styles he’d been working on for the last few weeks and settled on the loveseat with Cas.
She pulled up her muffs and Dean followed suit. When she’d finished shooting, she reloaded and went again. “I don’t know,” she finally said. “It’s still really weird, you know? He
Dean mentally shook himself from his stupor to concentrate on the conversation. “Um, nothing too concrete. Thought you could help with that. And Sam too. We should all meet up tomorrow to discuss. My thoughts so far are getting Claire and Kevin trained up with the basics of various weaponry—Charlie can take archery, and I’m sure she’ll bring her LARP sword, so probably a bit of that, for fun—you can take hand-to-hand combat, Sam’ll do knives, and I’ll do guns. Then all of you can get together and do smart person stuff in the library and archives, while I keep everyone fed, I reckon.”
“Gotta figure out what’s wrong with you, buddy,” Dean adds, clapping him softly on the shoulder as he grabs his own coffee and rifles through the plastic bag for a burrito. “Fuck yeah, sausage and potato.” He rips off the top of the foil and takes a huge bite. “Shanks, Shammy,” he adds with an egg-filled grin.
Cas’s face softens a little, and he gives a nod of acknowledgement. “Thank you, Sam. I’ll keep that in mind.”
She leveled him with a stern stare. “Look, I don’t want to tell this story twice. Is Castiel here? I hear he’s been bunking here these days.”
Sam’s head jerked up, brow wrinkled. Dean shot him a smile and thumbs up, then let out a relieved breath as he found a spare pair of socks in the side pocket of his bag that he swore he never used.
“Ugh. Right. This is going to be a fun drive.” He dug into his pocket. “What the fuck. Where are my–”
“I dunno,” Dean says, scrubbing his hands through his hair. “I think I’m gonna have to be the mature one for once and say it’s not up to us to decide. And if we even bring the idea up to him, he’ll probably go all bull-headed and insist we keep working the job. But maybe …” he sighs, “maybe not pick up another one after this? I don’t like the idea of him passing out during a fight or something.”
Dean stares in a hilarious mix of horror, confusion, panic, and annoyance. “Come on, man,” he mutters, burying his face back in the book he was reading earlier. “So messed up,” Sam thinks he hears him add to himself.
Dean sighed, and leaned against the nearest shelf, fiddling with some sort of jewelry box. It was probably cursed, and he shouldn’t touch it, but that didn’t stop him.
“Dean,” he begins, then stops. How does one go about confessing their everlasting love for their best friend? Or for anyone, really.
, right? Quirks and habits and flaws. Well, to us humans, clothing is an extension of our personality. It matches our likes and our lives. So a goth wears all back, elaborate clothing. Someone really perky and happy wears bright clothes. Fancy people wear fancy clothes. Joe Schmoes like me wear jeans and flannel. Get it?”
Dean’s chuckle turned into a sigh as he settled down. “I’m sure you realize there’s more to Cas and me’s story,” he began.
He then directed Cas to dump a quarter of the mix into his coffee and stir it, then try the coffee again. Cas took a sip, and he looked at it contemplatively before dumping in the rest of the mix and stirring again. He pronounced his next sip ‘palatable,” and settled back into his chair. Dean doctored his own coffee with (much less) of the second packet, then hit play on the Netflix screen.
Sam stays out of it. Dean has been in lowkey gay panic mode for years, and it’s kind of funny watching it really kick into gear. Of course, it’s also really tragic, how deeply he’s buried it all—his feelings in general, his interest in men, his preoccupation with Cas—and Sam hopes again that something will finally change. He doesn’t think Cas will ever make a move unless he knows Dean has finally come to grips with it all, but if Dean is left to his own devices, he may never get there. That angel-trapped locked room is sounding more and more appealing. But before then, they need to figure out what’s wrong with Cas, and before
The air quotes and the curse passing Cas’s angelic lips succeeded in drawing a laugh from Dean, and Cas smirked in return. Then he shook cinnamon into the grounds before closing the lid.
They settled back into their pre-Claire routine, things a little more tense between the brothers, but still manageable, and the bond continued to keep Cas and Dean in close proximity. How they shared space changed though—more hugs, a couple of head kisses, and Dean had taken to slinging an arm over Cas’s shoulders when they watched TV. They were already touching enough to keep the bond happy, but the new closeness made Dean happy, and he thought, hoped, maybe Cas as well.
The bathroom door opens, and they both tense, but Dean doesn’t move, so Castiel doesn’t either. What does
“No, Cas, not at all. Look, I know my actions so far haven’t been particularly welcoming. But you know me, I don’t handle change well, and I feel really bad that we’ve saddled you with this problem. I’m trying to adjust, but as Bobby let me know, I’m being an idiot to you in the process. I keep thinking I know what you want, but we haven’t really talked about this. What do
With Sam gone, they decide on burgers. Castiel, of course, doesn’t need to eat, but he sometimes enjoys it when Dean is there, because Dean enjoys it. And he remembers fondly how good burgers tasted when he was human, and wishes he could still taste whole meals, rather than the particles that make them up. But still, he does take pleasure in eating with Dean from time to time. It’s more the communal cooking and the breaking of bread that Castiel finds meaningful.
Sam looked between the two of them and said, “I’ll let you two talk it out. I’m going to bed for real this time.” He got up and headed out as quickly as possible while not actually running. Wuss.
Sam shrugs. “It’s a possibility. Or some other magical being that likes wandering from town to town helping people out but gets annoyed when he’s not paid? Is there any creature that has hypnotic abilities that fit the M.O.?”
“No! No. I mean, angel sex isn’t exactly a thing, though there is a dance that melds graces that is often done by angels who share a romantic bond, and I have heard it
“Yeah, ‘course. They’re great. Love the color. Are all angels’ feathers the same?” He can’t believe he’s never asked before, but it had always seemed like something they shouldn’t talk about, especially after the Fall.
His words are cut off by warm lips on his, and even though he saw Dean surge forward, he still gasps in surprise. Dean pulls back just far enough to see his eyes. He studies him for a few seconds. “Okay?” The word is gruff but soft, just like the man himself.
“Missed us already, kiddo?” Dean asked, rubbing her head with his knuckles until she glared and pulled away.
Dean gave his brother bitchface but didn’t argue. As much as he hated Sam driving Baby, he’d hate it if he himself crashed her just because he was being a stubborn ass.
“You bet your ass I am. And now, I’m going to go be the greatest chef who ever lived and start on dinner.” He stood and stretched.
“Okay then. I think I can provide you with hunting, seeing more of humanity, and plenty of bickering between me and Sammy, so if that’s really what you want …” It was hard to believe, but he wouldn’t fight it, seeing as he wanted Cas to stay too.
He was contemplating a drunk nap when Cas started his pacing, and after a few dizzying turns, he came to sit next to Dean in one of the reading nooks. Which was good, because he was starting to feel a little sick. Maybe he should slow down the drinking. Cas did that staring-at-Dean-from-too-close thing, then spared a short glance for Sam.
“Fine, fine. But that’s not why I’m calling. I’d like you to come to the bunker and give archery lessons to a couple of newbies. And maybe go over some basic internet and hacking tips.”
“Look, Dean,” Cas began, and only then did Dean realize they were leaning against each other’s shoulders again. He didn’t like this bond unconsciously doing touchy things. He had free will, damn it, and no amount of fondness for his friend would make him wish otherwise. No matter how good it felt.
“My wings aren’t infernal, they’re celestial,” Castiel protests, but it’s half-hearted. He has bigger worries.
While he was searching a dusty set of shelves a few minutes later, his phone vibrated. When he saw it was a call from Bobby, he answered.
“Even though I’m …” Cas looks down at his body, and Sam knows he means the male body thing. He tries to put his friend at ease.
Cas’s words were soft but firm, and Dean felt like shit for about the eight thousandth time that day. Why couldn’t Cas have been saddled with someone who could do this shit better—the give and take, the caution, the noticing of feelings before he put his foot straight into his mouth. Someone whole who could be there for him. Granted, anyone fitting that description would not get themselves in this mess to begin with. They’d be home, raising their two-point-whatever children—white picket fence and apple pie life firmly in place.
He laughed. “Just make sure you get in some time at the range while you’re here. I won’t let it be known that a hunter I taught can’t use a gun correctly.” He thought a moment, then continued. “Maybe we should get Charlie in here for some archery lessons too. She does it for her roleplaying.”
Sam must have a similar (though hopefully much less graphic) thought, because he teases Dean, whose incredibly intelligent comeback of “shut up, Samantha” only makes Sam laugh.
OMG we made it to the end. How exciting. I hope you enjoyed coming along with me on this journey to love with a grumpy angel and equally as crabby hunter.
sorry, Dean. We were in a bit of a rush, but it’s my fault I didn’t take the time to read everything thoroughly. And I will work nonstop until I find a way to undo it, okay? There’s got to be a way out of this.”
“I see how it is.” Dean put a mock-offended hand on his chest. “I cook and clean for you, and you don’t even appreciate me trying to make this house a home.” He wiped away a fake tear.
“What the actual fuck, Cas?” Dean explodes in a stage whisper after the tenth wriggle. “Stop moving.”
to ask. So then why was he? A courtesy? Didn’t seem likely, as human emotions were not his strong suit. Granted, this wasn’t just any old human, it was Dean, who Cas cared about, for whatever unknown reason. But in any case, he doubted courtesy was the answer. Perhaps to make Dean voice his own feelings?
Castiel looks over to Sam, who is studying him carefully with a similar expression of worry. He assesses his body and grace. No, he still feels his connection to Heaven and the Angelic Host. Angel radio—which he mostly tunes out these days—still works just fine. He reaches out and taps Dean’s forehead to rid him of the headache he knows he has by the way he squints one eye, and his brow smooths in relief.
“So yeah, I got moved from shitty foster home to shitty foster home. When the group home I was in got attacked by vampires and I managed to escape, I used the chance to go off the grid and get out of the system. I’ve been hunting since then.” She shrugged and crossed her arms. “Your turn.”
Cas sighs, exasperated. “Yes, Dean. I still only have the same symptoms I’ve exhibited the last few days, nothing new. I’ve still got angel radio, and my connection to Heaven is strong as ever.”
The morning they wake to only a single feather in the bed with them, Castiel decides he has to say or do something. He doesn’t like this not knowing. He hasn’t mentioned that his other symptoms have started to abate as well, or that new feathers have started growing, but it’s only a matter of time before Dean asks.
Cas tenses. “Yes, I’m aware that I’m losing feathers, Dean.” He gestures to the bouquet of feathers in Dean’s hands. “It’s a bit difficult to forget.” His voice is tight.
wrong with him? Is it just that he’s taken on more human characteristics from spending extended time on Earth? Or is it something else? Something worrying. Something dangerous.
Sam’s reply had something to do with hearing Castiel’s words and accepting them. He nodded at Dean, who said his line, which mirrored Cas’s, and Sam said his line again.
“Whoa, no. Cas, where’d you get an idea like that?” Dean felt a stab of hurt that Cas thought Dean thought so little of his worth, but he supposed it made sense, considering Cas’s sense of self-worth wasn’t that much better than Dean’s. “Any money spent on you isn’t a waste. If you want to go to a fancy store and get anything else, you just let me know. Whatever you want, we’ll get it.”
They sat in comfortable silence for a time, Claire sending a few texts but not moving from her spot, so Dean stayed too.
Dean sighed. “Then I guess this next bit won’t come as a shock to you.” He turned his hand over and laced his fingers with Cas’s, who tightened his grip and smiled sweetly at Dean. “Cas and I are … together now. Like, not just angel married, but also human romantic relationship together.”
“Yuck,” Dean says sympathetically. “Sounds kinda like the flu.” He pauses. “Can you get the flu? Is there an angel flu?”
Bobby sighed, and Dean knew he’d be taking off his cap to scratch his head. “Look, if you wanna keep certain things to yourself, you’re allowed. But you hafta know Sam and I will support you no matter what. We love you, idjit that you are.”
“I dunno, dude. He’s been like that for weeks. He acts like he hates being here, but he also refuses to leave. It’s like a toddler fighting a nap.” Dean rubs a hand over his face.
Cas looks quietly pleased for a moment before looking back to Sam. “Are you thinking a local protective god?”
“It’s currently eleven twenty-three. I didn’t wake you up because you looked like you could use it, and who knows what physical toll this bond is taking on you,” Cas explained, and he sounded sad. Dean hated that tone.
Cas pulled himself up to rest on his elbow. “I’m glad you like it, but also …” He pursed his lips (lips Dean tried
The news relaxes Dean slightly, but he points behind them, where three large feathers glint in the dappled sunlight. “You’re losing more feathers, though.”
So why does everything at the bunker suddenly irritate him? Dean and Sam are far from perfect, and they’ve always done things that annoy Castiel, but now it’s every little thing. Every open-mouthed smacking of food, every ‘well, actually’ from Sam, every loud guffaw, just
As if conjured, the bathroom door opens, and warm steam rolls out. Cas emerges with his hair plastered to his head, water dripping onto Dean’s Rush shirt.
Dean enjoyed watching the kids at archery practice. You could be a little less serious around arrows than with guns. Not that he downplayed the serious injuries that could come from them, but you’d really have to fuck things up to accidentally kill someone with a shot. You had to be more intentional with arrows than with bullets. Still, though he let them goof a bit, he made sure they followed the usual safety protocols, and Cas was on hand in case anyone was shot.
Sam cocks his head. “Dean, we’ve been over this before. You two ‘share a more profound bond.’ He answers every time you call. He tells you way more than he tells me. He follows you around like a puppy. And don’t get me started on the eye sex.”
The gust from Cas’s sigh was almost strong enough to travel through the radio waves or whatever cell phones transmitted through and tickle Dean’s ear on the other side. He pushed the notion away, not wanting to think about Cas’s breath and his ear in the same thought.
They agree to watch the angel, and several days pass with no break in the case and with Cas getting neither better nor worse. The bickering gets to be too much three days in, and Sam orders Dean to take a drive and Castiel a walk, leaving him to blessed silence. They’ve continued to lose a person a night to whatever they’re hunting, with zero clues other than that the perp seems to be working their way in an inward spiral around the Kansas City metro area. They’d started out in the eastern Missouri area and had worked counterclockwise, landing most recently just north of the Mississippi River. They’d be in the center soon, and then what? Was it a ritual? Why did they kidnap so many people? Why was there no struggle? It was like someone was pied pipering people out of their beds … The thought brings his mind to a screeching halt. Of course.
“Except that’s not true.” Sam peeks over the screen still turned to face Dean and Cas and selects another tab in his browser. The headline that pops up reads “City Breaks Deal with Contractor Tasked with Upgrading the Metro Area’s Sewer System.” He scrolls down a bit so they can read the first part of the article. “Apparently the system is starting to cause noxious gases. I’d noticed the smell a few times, and I thought it was a localized problem, but it’s the whole metro area.”
Though he feels much better than the bone-deep ache from the night before, Castiel decides a shower is a good idea before being stuck in the car for four hours. He grabs his (Dean’s) day clothes and heads for the bathroom.
am married, sorta, and we do have one kid running around; or, at least we did. Just, between me ‘n Cas always needing to be around each other, and doing a fair amount of hunting, and then with Claire here, I feel like we haven’t talked in ages. You doin’ okay?”
When they returned, it was the day before the party and guests were arriving. Bobby, Jody, and Jody’s daughter Alex got in just before Dean, Cas, and Claire got back, and Garth followed not long after. Charlie would arrive around dinner, and a few other trusted hunters would land the next day. Claire, Kevin, and Alex surprised Dean by offering to make dinner, since he’d be doing the bulk of the food for tomorrow’s shindig. This also gave him and Cas time to take the others aside and tell them their news.
It was the more romantic leaning that had him walking on eggshells around what they had. Some days he reveled in their new closeness, but others he worried that they’d get close enough that he’d show his hand, and he’d learn that Cas didn’t feel the same. And the thing was, they were already kinda like an old married couple. They shared jokes and fond looks, they discussed their future together, they worried over Cas’s not-daughter, they enjoyed a fairly nice non-sex life, they bickered easily. Overall, it was way more apple pie than Dean had thought he’d ever get, so he really shouldn’t complain. And, for the most part, he didn’t. He was happy, he really was. It was just that, some days … he’d look and Cas and Cas would look at him, and he’d think about what they could be. Plus, he really missed sex. Like, a lot. But he pushed that particular longing away, guilty that maybe Cas’s one reason for not confessing his love for Dean was fear of having to turn down sex, that Claire had been right to say angels were asexual (yeah, he’d had to Google that one). So, he stifled his hopes and hid his morning wood, and just let things go on as they had been.
She looked at him closely for a moment, and with her big blue eyes, she reminded him a lot of Cas again. After half a minute, she said, “Alright, don’t tell me,” and held her hand out. He pulled the gun closer to himself instead of handing it over.
The others both shook their heads, and Dean power walked over to the fridge. He stood for a minute with the door open, trying to cool his heated face.
“Good morning, Dean,” came the reply from his side. He glanced over to see Cas in much the same position as the night before—pajamas on, sitting up, book in lap. His hair had that same just-woke-up-but-artful way that Dean had always envied, plus the five-o-clock shadow he had no matter what time of day it was. It was annoyingly hot. And he did
Within fifteen minutes, they’re leaving again to do interviews. They split up, because there have been fifteen disappearances in fifteen days, and time is against them. Castiel has grown comfortable with interviewing over the years. He knows he still overlooks idioms and obvious references to human culture, but it’s subdued enough that most people simply think he doesn’t get out much. Which is true enough. Today, though, he has trouble concentrating. The texture of his clothes still bothers him, and he feels like he’s standing in front of a heater on a summer day. He wishes Dean were here, or even Sam, anyone familiar. He wishes he were at the bunker, hiding in his room or watching a movie with his family. The voices of the interviewees chafe at his eardrums, and they all say nothing but inane things. He sighs in relief when he’s finally done, and he makes his way to the motel.
Pleasantly exhausted from the fight, they happily headed back to the hotel after grabbing dinner. Dean ordered twice as much as usual for himself, as Cas still liked to pretend he didn’t enjoy eating but ended up stealing food anyways. Cas, of course, realized what Dean was doing, but dutifully ignored it and instead gently teased Dean at how hungry he must be to order so much food for just himself. It was so adorable of an act, Dean almost kissed him. Might have done so if the fast-food employee hadn’t leaned out of the window just then to give Dean the food.
Dean closed his eyes and shook his head. Hand holding was better than the alternative, true, but it was still difficult to take in. He had a feeling he’d need to confront some long-buried feelings very soon, whether he wanted to or not. Close proximity to his best friend for weeks would
The hunt was actually interesting: a nachz-something that Dean thought could be better named a ghoul‑pire. This one apparently took after the ghoul side of the family and was chomping on the recently deceased at night. Defeating it went more easily than expected. As soon as they (Cas) realized it wasn’t a pure ghoul, they (Cas) acquired the coin necessary to kill it, Dean stabbed it a few times with a silver knife to distract it, Cas popped in and put the coin in its mouth, and then Dean chopped its head off. As always, they worked like a well-oiled machine and accumulated few injuries, all of which healed in minutes.
“Damn,” Cas replied. “My guy just left his house. I need to follow. Yes, fine. Do the ritual. Do I say the words now?”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if this ritual cribbed the words from another one. People love their shortcuts. Why reinvent the wheel?”
“This isn’t a home, Dean. It’s where we work, same as it’s always been. Only difference is the digs are nicer.”
They’d received a couple of quick calls from her asking for information, including a recent one on werewolves that now made sense, but no other communication.
Sam nods, eyes wide, like he can’t believe Castiel. “Of course. You’re family. We’ll do everything, exhaust every avenue and then some, until we find an answer.” He pauses and scrunches his nose, then continues. “I mean, I think I’ll leave the physical comfort to Garfield here, but yeah, whatever else it takes, I’m on it.” He winks at Castiel, who feels his face heat.
Castiel takes them cautiously. It’s a black Rush shirt and a pair of soft, gray sleep pants. They’re Dean’s. He looks back up at Dean. “I don’t need to shower or change clothes.”
“Okay, uh, right.” Sam closed the book he was reading, stacked a few more on top of it, and picked them all up. “I’ll, uh,” he nodded his head toward the rooms, “go to bed now?”
Charlie, though, continued to stand in thoughtful silence. Dean caught her staring at him a couple of times, but he wasn’t eager to answer her deeper questions, and luckily Sam and Cas entered the kitchen then, and they all settled in for a boisterous lunch.
Happy land. Plus, maybe Sam would be the one to find his unconscious body and feel really bad about it. Bitch.
A few months after their first post-bond hunt, they came home to find that Sam had been busy setting the place up as another hunter hub like Bobby’s. He answered phone calls to corroborate hunters’ backstories, did research, and occasionally offered up one of the many spare rooms when a hunter friend was passing through the area. Bobby started dropping by from time to time, as did Garth, when they wanted to confer with Sam over this amulet or that cursed knife or when they were passing through on a hunt, and soon enough, it didn’t feel weird to come back from a hunt to find a guest hanging out.
“Try again. You haven’t been able to sit still in the two hours since we left home. Something is obviously wrong, ‘cause usually you’re as still as a statue.” Cas gives an aborted wiggle. Dean’s hands tighten on Baby’s wheel.
“Uhh.” Dean looked over at his brother, who was now muttering to himself and looking confused. “Sam. What’s he need to do?”
She looked fit to bursting to talk about her findings, but she was a pretty smart cookie, and it took her only a single look to know Dean wasn’t there to talk to her about computers.
Still looking disbelieving, Dean speaks up. “Okay, but this place isn’t having issues. No buildings falling apart, no famine, the plants all look okay.”
“Dean, you’ve made it once before. You can’t call it famous.” Sam sent him bitchface. It might be best to keep him and Claire apart, for fear she’d learn new annoying facial expressions.
“Claire, I’m so sorry to hear that I’ve caused you so much pain in the last few years. I never meant for any of this to happen, truly.”
Charlie was, as Claire had predicted, ecstatic to learn that they’d finally bit the bullet—because she was their friend, but more than a little because she won the betting pool and also got to lord over him the title of Dean Winchester’s Ultimate Wingwoman every time they talked.
Castiel wishes he could speak, but words have deserted him. So he simply nods. Dean leans forward again, and he cups Castiel’s jaw in one hand as he presses his lips back to Castiel’s, back where they belong. Castiel closes his eyes and savors the contact. He breathes Dean in and begins the hopefully very long process of learning every inch of this amazing man.
“That Cas is not like anyone else. And not just because he’s an angel with a literal unbreakable bond to you. He’s seen you at your best and worst, and he’s stayed. He understands you on a fundamental level that I think only Sam can come close to matching. He gripped you tight and raised you from perdition!”
Castiel frowns. This isn’t the reaction he had hoped for. Perhaps he has read it wrong, and Dean just wants to be friends, and because he knows Castiel so well—better than any being has ever known him—he sees that Castiel is about to profess his love, and he’s dreading it.
Dean grunts. “Well, we’ll keep an eye on ya. You feeling okay to go over what we’ve learned so far?”
“But it’s different now. We’ve got an actual home! No more being stuck in cramped motel rooms with questionable sheets and even more questionable carpets. No more spending free time driving hours to the next gig. We’ve got the mancave and a real kitchen and our own rooms now!”
, even though he backtracked on it. He said it without thought, like it was so easy to think of something jointly belonging to them. It was nice. Taking at least a tiny hint of Bobby’s advice, he talked.
But things in the supernatural world seem to be staying calm these days, and Cas doesn’t show signs of flitting off to somewhere away from Dean, and he’s afraid to question that, in case it all comes crashing down yet again. So he watches.
Castiel smiles, big and bright, because with truth comes freedom. “Love. I have never loved anything in creation as much as I’ve loved you. And I’d hop–”
“Suffice it to say, I went with the materials available, which include a basic coffee maker, cheap beans, and cinnamon.”
He’s about to say no but changes his mind. “Some jasmine tea would be nice.” He likes the way it smells. It’s comforting.
love. And I’ve done so for years. You get me like no one else has, and I like to think I get you too, and- and we fight well together and we’ve made this beautiful home and we have a family and we were lucky enough to get to share this amazing bond that no other human has ever had with another being, and our lives are fucking
By the time he was done, he was finally on his way to (but not yet) drunk, but he had gained quite a few other physical symptoms, and none of them fun. He felt nauseous, and his head had started pounding about ten minutes back. His skin felt like it had ants crawling under it, and the pull to find Cas was so strong, he had to physically stop himself from moving. Dean wasn’t sure why he was being so stubborn about this. He couldn’t win. Cas said the symptoms would increase the longer they were apart, and no amount of mule-headedness would stop them. But he felt the need to test those limits as far as he could, in part because that’s what he did, but also because he needed it to be known how much he hated what was happening, and plant his flag in I Am
Sam shrugs and shakes his head, then gets a big grin on his face. “Especially given the way he was plastered behind you this morning.”
wrapped around Cas the next morning. He was facing toward him, and they were holding hands rather tightly, but that was as risqué as it got. He used his free hand to rub the sleep from his eyes and the drool from his mouth (very minimal, thank goodness) as he turned on his back and sighed.
