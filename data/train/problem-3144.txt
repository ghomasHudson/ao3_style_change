day? Fuck, why do you go to work, full time? Seriously, Cas-Tiel! This is … is … is ….
When he finally calmed himself down, Cas finally responded to the other man. “You’re welcome, Dean.”
“You know what this is? Mimes. Evil mimes.”
“Dean!”
Dean’s fingers travelled lightly across Cas’ skin, from his check and down to his neck. Cas was extremely close to releasing a soft sigh when Dean caressed the back of his neck.
Sammy, not Castiel’s. “Nothing. I’m just testing your hearing.”
Without waiting for the lovebirds’ answer, Dean stood up and walked to the room in the bunker that he intended to head to. He even managed to snatch a book from one of the library shelves to bring with him.
“Some people,” he grumbled and carried on making his way into the bus, moved along with the crowd, who started to enter the bus.
Good thing he chose Jimmy Novak for a vessel then (may Jack rests his soul).
"Your Highness, thank you for coming, and you come bearing gifts!"
“Claire is the daughter of the man whose body is Cas’ vessel,” Sam explained to Eileen. “Long story short, Claire is now practically Cas’ adopted daughter.”
The question made him had a little shock and his arm bumped the beer bottle, causing it to spill all over the table.
"No way!" Charlie's face beamed, then she bounced to the other side of the kitchen island and tapped Abaddon's arm repeatedly. "Move, woman, I have found my kin. Okay, Dean, which trilogy of
I honestly started to think that he was actually a college kid who happened to look way older for his age.”
“Well, the process for this grace extraction is far from comforting, Dean, so might as well,” Sam opened the wooden box and showed what was inside.
One of the meals being served really made Castiel had to hold himself from either changing his order or to make an
nightmare. Then why did he still feel nervous today? Barely
“Uh … do you like dogs, Dean?” Cas asked carefully.
It was like on flash-forward, the man in dark navy jacket beelined to the nearest pie stand and got himself some pie to devour. After a few minutes of trucks hopping, he returned to his little brother carrying a box filled with six slices of pie. That, of course, earned a slightly worried look from his little brother. Although this time, there was more than that, and it wasn't judgemental, like usual.
“Dean?”
“Leave him,” Cas opened the balcony door and closed it again after he slides outside, “I’m escaping outside now.”
“Because there’s not much to tell of, Jack,” Castiel smiled and got up, “let’s just say, your grandfather is a good person, but not exactly a good family man. Anyway, so none of you is having dinner at home, right?”
“So, will you ever tell Mum and Dad?”
“Oh, yeah. Sure, Cas. Take your time with the shower.”
Sam had waited for him next to the Impala with the doughnut boxes. “Dean, Ellen had texted me. We really gotta go before another text comes.”
“Shut up, jerk,” Dean chuckled.
“What?”
Cas had just recovered from his hearing that the name ‘Charlie’ was paired with a ‘her’, when Dean’s fake British accent came to his ear. “Dean, that was a good impresion of Balthazar.”
The park where he ran was quite empty, just like Castiel liked it when he went for a jog on weekdays. Other perks from being a freelancer, he could do his hobbies on weekdays and avoid the crowd. Plus, since he forgot to take his dog for a walk last Saturday, Castiel decided to do it today. On a Tuesday.
“How is that not simple, Uncle Cassie? You guys liked each other, you kissed. That surely had mean something, why didn’t you two talk about it?”
They were the fucking
Again, Cas chuckled when he heard the question, “Dean, when you lived with Gabriel, sometimes you just
Dean reflexively grabbed his phone that was sliding off the dashboard to the other side of the car when he turned a corner. For a moment his Impala went off the lane and made the car behind him honked furiously.
Cas laughed nervously at that, “Well, that was mostly because I knew if I ever hit home, with my telly and sofa, and bed, it will be hard for me to get up and go pick them up. I might as well send a cab to pick them up, and would have Lucifer’s wrath after they got home.”
The girl next to him smiled, “That’s okay, Uncle Cassie. I know it’s hard at home, at least you have Gabriel supporting you for now. Oh, Alfie also knew.”
Sam scoffed at his brother’s argument, “
"Welcome to the club," Crowley chipped in as he stepped forward next to Dean, who was now had Cas' arm around his shoulder, so the former angel could lean on him for support in standing.
Gabriel moved a little to give Pamela a better look at the man with blue eyes who was with him. "Pamela, meet Castiel, my baby brother."
? Have you tried it before?”
The stalls served various kinds of meal, from the all-time favourite instant noodles to a quite pricey barbecue satay that would sent delicious aroma-mist all around the place. Fortunately, the taste could compete with the fog it created, especially after peanut and soy sauce added.
He came from a quite big family, there are three brothers – two older, one younger – and one adopted older sister. All curiously named after angels. Oh, his’ was from Angel of Thursday. Even so, his parents were open-minded enough to name their first born
He stood up (still with Misha on his shoulder) and took out his phone from his bag, then returned to the sofa and searches for Dean’s number. After a few attempts on typing with Misha head-butting the phone repeatedly while purring, Castiel finally could made a proper message.
Dean quickly turned to his friend and gave him a warning look, that made Balthazar quickly understand the fact that Dean hadn’t tell the kids on the backseat about Castiel. And who
“They’re inside, raiding the food stalls. I swear, had they nudged their orientations just a little bit to the side, they would make an adorable couple,” Sam shook his head, “anyway, you two wanna have something to eat?” Sam turned to the men before him in turns.
“Dean, you said that your house is called the bunker. Did you named it like that, or your grandfather?”
If this was an animated film, Dean was quite sure the Castiel face on The Empty would turn bright crimson, and there would be fumes coming out of the crown of his head. But what was showing in front of him now was the solid black liquid started to blanket The furious entity before him, that he no longer resembled Castiel. Or any human being in that matter.
Dean's lips formed a sad smile, "Many things happened in Purgatory, Rowena."
going to the venue. Like some sort of prom date.”
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam smiled. Soon after their coffee is done, he poured them to his cup and his big brother’s. “So … Cas?”
“What? No. Only on channel-surfing. Shut up.”
"There's nothing wrong in studying everyone you're gonna spend the weekend with," Charlie shrugged innocently, and made Castiel laugh again.
Dean took his time worshipping Cas’ mouth, and Cas felt like he might passed out at any moment from the sensual lip-dance. Dean’s lips felt so soft on his, it almost unbelievable, and the kiss … there was nothing lustful on the kiss, it was smooth and occasionally had a faint break for either of them to take a quick inhale of breather or let out a sigh.
The sergeant was called by his team, and she excused herself. He smiled as a response to her, but after she returned inside the house, the smile on his face was still visible. It was also no longer of politeness, more to an irony.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean could feel his cheeks started to hurt from the size of his smile, “how’s it going?”
Cas smiled at the statement, “Yeah, I reckoned so. Honestly, I don’t quite follow my siblings’ works. Believe it or not, I only knew about Gabriel’s work – this – this afternoon, before we left.”
“That’s lovely, Cas.”
“Yeah, I reckon,” Dean smiled, then the car took two more turns before slowing down. “Hey, is this the place?”
That escalated quickly. Don’t worry, Sam’s fine. So, I’m gonna let you catch up with your brother. Talk to you again tomorrow?
"What? That fallen angel who look after two brothers?" Castiel tucked his chin to his chest softly and he let out a snort. “Believe it or not, Dad used to tell me that story when he put me down to bed. I was only expanding the story. I can't believe you still remember that, Gabe. I was like, what, seven?"
When he saw that their lives had turned to a better way, Dean remembered something that his mother used to tell him before he went to bed, that angels are watching over him. Maybe she was right, an angel did watch over him. And it probably was
After telling his big brother to get up so he could unfold the sofa-bed (and Gabriel decided to snuggle Claire instead of helping), Cas heard his phone chimed.
“Hey, don’t bother. You had cooked dinner and you have beer, the least I can do, man,” answered Dean while carrying two plates to the dining table outside.
called you, Garth. Anyway, you guys are okay there? You, Bess, the kids?” he lifted his legs to the cushion in front of him and leant back to the green couch in his bedroom. He stared blankly to his room that curiously looked more vacant now. Has Cas always filled the void in his room somehow?
Cas smiled at Dean’s answer, “Okay.”
Castiel took a deep breath before talking to the phone again, “What. Kind. Of. School. Are. You. Working. At?”
“What?”
“Oh, yeah, sure. Bring the boy over, and I’ll meet you guys at the bunker, cool?”
Both Dean and Sam stopped teasing each other and received the beer bottles from Bobby with cheerful thanks. After they took a sip, it was Sam who spoke first. “Bobby, look, we were watching this Korean drama called
“Was he the one who was here when I called you?” Gabriel asked and chuckled when seeing his little brother’s shy smile. “Wow, Cassie, it’s been a while since I saw you this calm when you’re in love.”
own story, and it can include Cas. It can have you telling him that you love him. I can have Eileen, I can have a life with her. We can do this, Dean!"
Castiel gave his best smile to the man who was standing and towered behind his chair. “Well, I’m the oldest one here, so I guess yeah, I can go with you,” he then turned to Charlie. “Mind holding down the fort while I help him for a bit?”
“Dean, your room is exquisite. I love it,” Cas turned around and walked to the shelves that have Dean’s book collection. “You have an interesting collection here. Would you mind if someday I borrow one of your books?”
“Well, not date, date per se. Sammy’s girlfriend suddenly had to go home, so Charlie stepped in. She’s family. Besides, I don’t think Sammy’s her type at all,” Dean looked to his shoes and smiled widely. He turned to his side and noticed Cas was staring at him with his doe eyes, and a very small hardly-used part of Dean’s brain suddenly made a decision that he wouldn’t mind to see that face next to him in the morning.
Castiel was so surprised to have Gabriel read his texts, he forgot to move and breathe, all he could do was staring at his brother with his mouth gaped.
“Really?” Sam was wide-eyed at this fact, it surprised Castiel.
“Anyway, I’m finished for today,” Crowley continued and took a sip of his drink, “you?”
When the men had taken out everything they need, Dean locked the car and lead Cas to the stairs. That lead to the main room.
Alas, the vampire was too large, and he was pushed back instead, nastily.
“What? Did you hear yourself, Dean?”
Castiel opened the small wine rack next to the fridge and took out one of the Chateau Bordeaux wine bottles. He knew that his parents wouldn't miss it if one bottle was missing from their collection. He opened the bottle and inhaled the aroma before bringing it to the kitchen island. While at the same time, Charlie practically raid each cabinet looking for wine glasses.
Cas turned his head and straightened up from his position, “Misha! Where did you find him, Dean?”
” Cas sighed in defeat, as he typed a reply to Dean.
The dentist smiled so bright, Dean felt like the room suddenly lit. “Sure,” he leaned his head on Dean’s side and on the next moment Dean swore Cas was
Sam jumped in, “So, the exhibition was called
Sam didn’t reply, only throwing something to his direction. Dean caught it just in time before it fell to the floor. His keys.
“What? Why-OKAY! Okay!” Dean retreated to his desk when Balthazar suddenly stood up with the desk pencil sharpener in his hand.
actually knows what we are doing in our daily life, except people we are here with, and here you are, asking about your work?”
A girl with flaming red hair greeted Castiel in a whispered voice as he arrived at the library. The other students who would be working as well that night waved excitedly to the blue-eyed man, who returned it with a smile.
“Hey, wait a minute!”
that can help me cross to The Empty?"
“Okay, not what you thought. It was when, uh, when you left us after I ejected Gadreel. And apparently, you went with Crowley to meet Cain, and got you the Mark of Cain.”
"Dean," Sam's voice started to get hard, "we are
“As I told you, I decided to take him for the opening tomorrow. Sammy’s not taking his girlfriend either, but that’s another story. I had to spend a good ten minutes dealing with his
He liked Dean,
. He was in awe of whatever it was in front of him, and when he talked, his voice started to crack, out of excitement or contentment, or maybe both. The emotions clearly filled his insides, that he needed extra effort to process it.
Castiel snapped his head up, and remembered that Dean had opened the door for him and started the car. “Oh, yeah, sorry,” Castiel hurried to enter the car and put his seatbelt on. “This is a beautiful car, Dean. It’s classic!”
“Hey, you okay? You’re not eating your food.”
“See you tomorrow, Doctor Novak,” the brunette woman gave a small wave to Castiel, who returned it with a tentative smile and certain steps to his motorbike.
“I understand. I also hoped that Cas would be back and Eileen will live with us here in the bunker. Our family is getting bigger.”
“Dean, that’s it! You’re forgetting the obvious. Maybe you can’t find Cas right now, but you can talk to him, tell him, and maybe he can find you.”
“When I got back to the bunker, I expected Dean to say something about it- good or bad- I was ready to hear it and move on, but he pretended like it didn’t happen. He didn’t even acknowledge what I had said, what I literally gave my life to say to him.  I felt embarrassed and that’s why I hid in my room for so long, I felt like I had misread and then ruined my friendship with Dean and didn’t know how to make it right.  I’m sorry Sam.”
Cas didn’t look any more pleased than Dean felt. They both glared at the Scotsman.
“Okay, so what happened?”
Now, with the car silent and their house in front of him, the smile on his face has just grown bigger of the thought of his husband waiting for him inside. Castiel grabs the small, rectangular box from the passenger seat, the present for Dean hidden beneath glossy paper and curled ribbon, and gets out of the car with a relieved groan at finally being able to stretch properly.
“Are you using it now?”
Cas cocked his head to the side and looked at Dean, as though he was ciphering all of the logistical possibilities. His eyes swept to the hallway leading to the bedroom, to the brown leather couch, and back to Dean.
“Here’s what we know.” She pointed to the newspaper and the manila envelope on the table. ”Right now everyone is reading the morning news and finding out that Castiel is basically a kinky prostitute to Washington’s elite, and that there’s supposedly evidence out there proving that Dean is a customer. Until a copy of this photo or others like it comes out, it’s all hearsay. Those of us in this room know for certain that the article is true.”
Very glad to see Cas start to assert himself a little more.
He wasn’t fine, but it had nothing to do with the candy and everything to do with the gnawing pit in his gut every time he thought about Cas. The bastard still hadn’t called. If Dean ate a poisoned candy and died, it would serve him right for walking out on him. Of course, he knew better, he just didn’t care. The apocalypse was over, Chuck was gone, and Cas had left him. He was just biding time before he got killed in a hunt anyway. If he died choking on some random piece of candy, so be it. He popped another one in his mouth and shot Sam a cocky grin, “You're just mad because I don't plan on saving you any.”
“I asked, didn’t I?” Maybe that came out a little snarkier than he had meant it to.
“Let’s be honest here, Benny and Jack gave me the rundown on how they saved you from being abducted at gunpoint this morning. If you’ve been compromised the way it looks like you have, there’s probably a price on your head, set by more than one of your clients. Working with us is probably your only option.” There wasn’t any time to pull punches, Sam was urgent to move things along.
He kneels down, intending to pick up the pieces of the smashed vase. He grabs the biggest section, the base where it's mostly whole, and slices his finger. It stings like hell and it tips him over the edge.
“Sam? I’m listening.”
“Fine, I’ll listen,” Castiel answered and Sam eyed him shrewdly.
“Dean?”
The story is inspired by lines from the song Dance Me to the End of Love by Leonard Cohen. There are some great covers out there if you want to check it out.
“I’ll have the cobb salad with grilled chicken please.” Sam folded the menu and handed it back.
“Yes, bu-“
Shutting the door and stepping over the corpses, they split up to case which items and books needed to come back with them. The most precious items could come back today. Now that Sam knew the apartment was protected and secure, he could take a bit of an inventory and return later with more boxes and a plan to organize everything in advance.
“Cas, look, I’m sorry I snapped. I was really worried and, uh, I’m glad you arrived home safely. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, man. I shouldn’t shout at you.”
“Yeah, and I, uh, I really appreciate our time together. And our talk. So …?”
Castiel then worked on his laptop to upload the files that their supervisor had sent to him, as the senior translator, right before he went out for drinks. Now he remembered why he couldn’t recall it. While waiting for the uploading to finish, Castiel noticed that his team had returned to whatever they were watching before.
quests, yeah? Bye, brother mine, I’ll call you.”
“Shut up, Sammy.”
When he learnt that none of the people with him intended to comment, Crowley continued, "Turned out, this ring had the power to choose the next Death, and somehow it appointed me. See, I don't know who influenced this thing to make its decision, that's why I said someone or something had the thought that it was funny to make me Death."
There was a smile on that answer, Dean was certain about it, and it was contagious to him.
As he sat down on one of the chairs, Dean knew that he could be sitting here with Cas in front of him, with his permanently-confused look that was so adorable, and asking Dean if he had any idea yet on how to sort out the case. Which, ironically, would mean Cas’ own situation in The Empty.
When he had stopped laughing, Cas was caught off guard when he looked at the screen. Dean was looking back at him with a small smile and soft eyes. But somehow, Cas couldn’t look away from Dean’s eyes. It was the look that could make Cas fall in love with him.
It’s refreshing. Especially after having a minor patient, whose mother couldn’t stop asking and reminding you that her 14 year old son was afraid of dentist.
“Okay, so I’m in my free time as well now. The patient flow had finally ended just before you called, and I had the rest of the afternoon free. Well, save for these paperwork. So, more or less like you,” it was Cas’ turn to showed Dean his desk, he switched the camera to the back and stood up while videoing his work desk. “Not sure if you could understand my writings, but those are my notes for patients. I should have yours somewhere.”
There was a moment where silence fell on them as they continued reading while eating. Eileen chose this time to break the silence and addressed her soon to be brother in law, "Dean, can I ask you something? You don't have to answer it if you're not comfortable."
on his side?
Sam and Dean weren't even surprised when a random Demon No 67 popped inside the bunker.
Considered of its location in the room, having sex on this bed would be one fantastic experience, which was quite a shame since Castiel could hardly remember
As they had their conversation going, Dean noticed that Jack had a growing curiosity about his life and Sam's since yesterday. Maybe Jack felt that now they were sort-of free of Chuck, he could start being the child with parents, and he'd like to know more about his parents. All of them.
“Why do you
“Dean, I’m sorry.”
“What time?”
With that answer, Jack smiled widely, and it practically melted Dean’s heart. It turned out he really care that much for this kid, even though he said that Jack wasn’t family before. He really needed to manipulate himself to avoid hurting so much when they lost Jack due to Billie’s plan.
on the small stepping ledge just outside the bus stop’s waiting space. All by himself.
"Uh, yes?"
Nick’s expression showed disappointment for a quick second before he replied, “Oh, yeah, sure. Of course, it’s still weekdays now.”
The Empty didn't respond to his demand immediately. Instead, he observed Dean from bottom to the top, as if assessing if Dean was worthy to meet Castiel, like some old-time matchmaker. After he finished with Dean, The Empty then turned his attention to Crowley and smirked.
"Welcome to The Empty, Dean. Come on, let's save your angel."
“No. She might be into you, though,” Dean chuckled. “That’s Balthazar, my workmate.”
Castiel tilted his head before answering, while his eyes were directed to the table between them, “Funny story, actually. So this boy was close to one of his big brothers, who loved sweets so very much. So he thought, he could return the favour of taking care of his big brother by becoming a dentist. So, whenever said big brother had sweets-caused problems with his teeth, he could come to him at anytime.”
“As am I.”
Castiel sat across the table from the stunningly handsome green-eyed man and waited. Not his typical patron, not even close. Castiel had built up a list of clients that paid a lot of money for both his services and his discretion. Without exception, they were from old money, often middle-aged or older, and soft around the middle. Rich closeted men with unhappy marriages and very public careers. This client though, wasn’t sporting a wedding band on his clearly calloused hands, hadn’t yet reached age 30, was taught and firmly muscled, and radiated anxiety.
“Is it my turn now?  Because if it is, I want you to pay very close attention Dean.”  He was still holding Dean so he couldn’t escape his gaze although the intensity itself would have pinned a lesser man to the spot anyway.  Dean nodded slowly, green eyes not wavering.
“Good night, Dean, I love you too.” Dean let out a relaxed sigh, already drifting away into a contented sleep. Feeling safe and loved for the first time in his adult life.
“You got about three seconds before I kick your ass Cas, spit it out.” All three off them knew Cas wasn’t letting him go, Dean was just posturing.
She walked around to the side of the bed so he could face all three of them.
that he was doing it. Kind of like his body was on autopilot. Panicking and blaming it on Sam seemed to work. It had been a gamble to hope that Sam would go along with it as though he had done it subconsciously. Sam didn’t argue, so it must have worked.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Cas!?” A quick wave of panic went through Dean.  Was he too late? He knocked again; a bit harder.
Cas cocked his head to the side and looked at Bobby. He wasn’t sure what to make of that.
“You doing okay?” Sam offered tentatively.
“So does this count for the kitchen Dean, or do I need to reciprocate first?” Cas held him close still, reluctant to let him go.
He almost felt guilty when Cas’ shoulders tensed up even more instead of relaxing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Smiling to himself, Dean stretched languidly, careful not to disturb the sleeping form snuggled up beside him.  Well, maybe not beside, more like over and around.  Somehow, Cas always managed to take up the entire bed, all the while entangling Dean within his limbs.  It was like sleeping with an octopus.  Dean was on his back, Cas had his hip thrown up and over, tangling their legs together.  One arm was thrown across Dean’s torso and ribs pulling him close, his head on his chest as though Cas was listening to his heartbeat.  The other arm slid up and under Dean’s shoulder, managing to tangle his hand in Dean’s hair.  It was as if Cas was trying to touch all of him at once.
Dean wanted to sit with this for a while, alone and without anyone’s sad looks or useless platitudes. But Cas was depending on him. Soon enough there would be a body to bring home and a pyre to build. Again.
“Partially, I’d like to stay alive, yes. But not really. I’ll do it for your bill.”
“That you loved him?”
Putting the bottle down, Cas met Dean where he stood and took the pizza box from his hands, leaning in for an affectionate kiss on the way by. Placing the pizza box directly on the table next to the plates he turned to look at his husband. “I’ve been reminded that you do so much for everyone else, without asking for anything in return.  I thought maybe I could spoil you tonight.”
“Good. Put my agent on the phone.” The very last thing Dean wanted to do was talk to Cas, but he was already screwed. He knew where Cas was, and he was already walking towards his room to grab the duffle and head for the car. His only chance to avoid eternal mortification was to warn Cas off.
“Anyone tell you that you taste like apples and cinnamon?”
“What did he mean about your ‘smarts’ Cas? I know that you were raised in these circles, so you apparently know how to manage dicks like the one we just met, and you’re going to finish your masters. Is there anything else I should know?”
After the time it took to pour gas and pay, Dean fully expected to have to get back in and take off after Cas. On some level though, he knew he’d be long gone if he wanted to be. Cas had literally told him to stay away from him, something he couldn’t ever recall Cas saying to him before. And maybe that meant something, because whatever the reason, he found himself standing by the car in no rush to go anywhere. The afternoon had already bled into early evening, there were a few more hours of daylight left but the best part of the day was definitely over. Looking at the restaurant and the crappy motel next door, he figured he might as well stay put and head home in the morning. Chalk it up to a close call. After today, he doubted Cas would ever use the FBI verification again. He wondered if this maybe was the last time he’d ever see him.
It was about two hours before Sam called back.  Exhaustion had won out and Dean had taken a nap and the bed.  Cas had done a good job; it was a damn fine memory foam mattress. He had fallen into a deep enough sleep that it took a few rings to wake him up.
“Oh, shit!” Dean escapes Castiel’s embrace, and it’s only then Castiel hears the telltale sizzling of the water boiling over.
“I’m sorry, what?” Dean couldn’t be hearing right, government-issued identification did not fall out of the sky, not for anyone. Especially not for retired spies on the run.
“Don’t worry, it won’t be anything extreme. As I said, it’s just a small test to see if we work well together. I’m going to teach you how to present, but only partially unclothed, and then I’m going to feed you. After that, we will be done for today.  Are you ok to proceed?”
“Yes, he came to get me. Gave me the choice of returning to heaven or returning here. I told him that I at least wanted to come here first before I decided…to see if I was still needed here now that Chuck is finished.”
Cas slid the ring the rest of the way home.  Still facing each other, they joined both sets of hands and waited for Jody to finish the ceremony.  Green eyes capturing and holding blue, the entire room could have disappeared, and they wouldn’t have noticed.
Dean felt a little squeeze and noticed the change in Cas’ breathing pattern as he drifted from slumber towards consciousness.  Titling his face down, he kissed the top of the other man’s head where he could reach, still smiling because life was damn good.
“Thought I’d lost you.”
“Dean, I really don’t think now is the time for me to lea…”
“Dean.” Sam’s voice wavered slightly.
“Look at you, you’re everything I could want in a sub. You did exactly as I asked and I’m very proud of you.” It was important to set the right tone before moving forward.
“Fuck, that’s probably my mother. Is it ringing now?”
He took the largest of the two mugs and poured a coffee for Cas first, adding the cream and sugar in the proportions that he knew his former angel preferred.  Handing it off along with the blueberry muffin he leaned down and kissed Cas again, on the forehead this time.
Cas’ angry strides ate up the distance between the car and the gathering. Dean followed not a half step behind. There was no danger here, at least not to them. Cas looked like he was ready to kill someone. Dean was still at a loss but figured he was finally about to get some of that missing info.
Cas held those green eyes with his blue ones for a long time. The open smile never wavered. Finally, after deciding it couldn’t actually get any more embarrassing than it already was, he relented.
“He showed up later the next day looking like he’d been hit by a train.  He acted differently though, like he was afraid or something. Never touched me, or Sam for that matter, again.  Told us that the hunt was over early and dropped us at Bobby’s for six months.  When we did travel together after that, he always left enough money to uh pay for the basics.  The only hustling I had to do after that was pool for any extras.”
“Uh … am I suppose to say
“...” Dean starred at Jimmy. “I mean…”
“Farting too much” Dean giggled gleefully at his own answer.
There was silence as both of them laid together, Dean fiddling with Cas’s fingers while they both laid against each other. A peace and quiet.
“Well that’s is in-between the ghost hunting you’ve been doing” Jimmy teased, leaning down to pull a cardboard. “Look at the number 1 trending topic that you caused just 2 days ago!” He pointed at the title of the article printed on the cardboard. “Brand New Mansion Is Haunted Claims Dean Winchester”
“Really?” Dean groaned plopping his head back into the pillows. “Alright I’ll just rest my eyes while you finish.”
“I loved it Dean! Thank you. Best birthday present ever.” Cas smiled as he slowed their kiss slightly into a more languid pace.
“Hmm.. Maybe this is why Sam deliberately got you the haunted house.” Jimmy joked.
Sam?... Cause no. It’s always Baby first!” Dean answered with feigned indignation.
Cas laid on his bed resting sideways, with his open laptop next to him displaying his livestream of ABC. He was waiting to watch the live telecast of
“Um… Hello…” Cas introduced himself.
“His pettiness just might have; I will have to give him a stern talking too or maybe chop his wig in revenge,” Dean tittered.
It was a bit later when Benny walked in again, sharing a look and few words with Gadreel, who was stationed at the door to keep a eye over the whole room, before announcing to the room:
“I’m sorry dearie,” Rowena whispered as they both stood next to the vanity chair, their eyes watching the rest of the room.
“No... look it’s great. People are extremely kind to me everywhere I go... but it also makes it hard you know. You never know who’s just being nice at face value because you are famous ... not because they genuinely like you.”
“Yea course. The song is absolutely touching. I think the whole nations falling in love with you all over again. So I gotta ask… What inspired such a heartfelt song?”
His knees not being what they were used to, Dean reached his hand up and smiled. “Hey, can you help a guy up?”
“Son of a bitch…all of this is about me and C—” Dean paused, not wanting to say it. “Me and…him?” He handed the letter back to Sam and ran his hand down his face trying to figure out what came next. “Man, she had it all wrong, didn’t she?”
There were at least a dozen small, perfectly circular scars littering his back. Old burn scars from lit cigarettes, scattered across the upper section of his back with a few on the lower, closer to his waistband. There was also a long jagged scar running from his left shoulder blade on a diagonal down to just below his ribs on the right. Castiel knew whip marks when he saw them, he’d definitely been whipped with something, likely the buckle end of a belt.
“Morning Sammy, coffee smells great…”and he freezes in his tracks because it’s not Sam in the kitchen.  He stands there slack jawed for a good five seconds, not having a clue what to say next.
“Green.”
“You must understand, Dean, that I assumed after Budapest we would both be marked. And we have been. The only difference between you and me was that I already had an idea of what to do and where to go. When I negotiated my agreement with Canada for safe haven, I included you in the package. I expected that you would likely need it.”
The knots in Sam’s stomach released once more, Cas was going back to the bunker. What a fucking relief. “Thank you Cas, you won’t be sorry.”
He let that settle in awkward silence for as long as he could stand it, but when Cas didn’t elaborate he finally broke down and started with the questions.
"And Sam's Squints, the lovable nerd just daring enough to fake his own near-death for a life-saving kiss from his crush," Dean added, tossing a bite-size piece of chocolate in his mouth.
So that’s what they did, except the next day they started looking at other places to live. It wasn’t so much a conversation as it was an unspoken agreement.
Fuck it, something had to give. The stalemate between Dean and Cas didn’t seem to be poised to end any other way. Sam decided he was going to let it play out for a bit, consequences be damned.
“C’mon Cas, let’s go to bed. It’s my turn to take care of you.”
Please, friend. Dean could translate that easily enough. He couldn’t remember a time in his adult life that he wasn’t lonely. He just chalked it up to life in their line of work. The price of his career had been his faked death to protect family and a long string of shitty motels and safehouses. He didn’t have friends because making friends was a luxury he could never afford.
. Nothing but the truth.”
“What aren’t you telling me, Cas?”
Dean made an actual scoffing noise and Cas pinned him with his piercing gaze again.
Damn clever, he was a little jealous. His government pension hadn’t amounted to much.
Cas brings Dean to safety, but it's complicated.
“I will tell you what I told Dean.  My assignment was always to watch over Dean and yourself.  I did that.  We won.  Neither of you need me anymore.  I think it’s best if I returned to heaven after all.”
“That, and to take the target off my back, yes.” Cas was so matter of fact about it that they could have been discussing the laundry.
Dean made quick work of cleaning the rest and had Cas turn once more to rinse the soap away.  Stepping out of the shower he dried quickly while Cas finished up and waited for him to step out.  Standing before him on the bathmat Dean took the fluffy towel and dried Cas’s hair with a quick rub, then moved to soak up the water droplets from his torso and limbs.  Cas watched wordlessly while Dean knelt before him, drying each of his legs and once done, pausing in front of his cock.  It had softened somewhat since being washed, but not all the way.  Looking up at Cas, he smiled and then moved forward to kiss it softly.  Beads of water rolled down the shaft and Dean gently swiped his tongue across the soft skin to collect them.
dying Winchester to make a plan worked."
Gabriel cut his brother’s confusion with a hug, “See you soon, Cassie. Take care, and be good with Dean, okay?”
age."
With his torch and gun at the ready, the big brother led their investigation further into the barn, until they found a sort of storage room with a closed door. Not to took any possible risks that might occur, the big brother signed that he would open the door. When the younger brother was ready to cover, he pushed the door open.
Dean ran his hands over his spiky hair and took a deep breath before he continued, "I'm scared, Sammy. The future that I saw, I didn't get to say anything to Cas. He was completely gone, and I didn't get to tell him that his love wasn't one-sided. He died without knowing that all this time, I was too scared to let him know that I loved him. And I kept pushing him because I thought it could
Cas nodded silently at the answer.
Dean scoffed at the answer. One month, would it be
with Cas to his room, Dean knew that he would have that goofy smile stuck on his face until the next day. At least. He honestly never planned to have Cas staying for the night, the plan was Dean driving Cas and Juliet home after they finished watching a film.
Castiel had a heart-to-heart with Charlie. And Dean. Sort of.
“You might fool him about your true feelings, Cassie. But you could never fool
“I want to say no, but there were times when I wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t cook for us, he would take up the task. And I can eat almost everything he made,” Dean smiled, as if he just remembered something good. “I’ve been cooking for Sam since we were kids. You remember I told you that both of us were usually being left alone by our Dad, right? Yeah, we’ve been living with a friend of the family, but sometimes I have to cook for Sam, and Jo, our surrogate sister.”
Dean cocked his head in Crowley's direction, "Don't feel so alienated, you've got loads of friends in that area if you want to gossip about Cas and me."
“Huh,” Sam chuckled, “well, maybe if Dean and I didn’t live together, we won’t know much about each other as well. Hey, come on, let’s get something to eat!”
“I’m not jealous,” and responded to the tease a little too fast for his own good, earning him a laughter from Sam.
Castiel laughed and moved forward to throw a hug at his former lover. Balthazar was the love of Castiel’s life, even though the ‘love’ here was more platonic, but he would proudly paraded that the flamboyant man was his.
And that was how Cas was awaken from his own thoughts. “Yes, Dean, I’m sorry. I’m here. So, um, yeah … we could have more or less like five hours before I have to go to the airport.”
Castiel was sure he never saw this man before in the neighbourhood.
need you."
Hope you enjoy my story so far, because there might be quite a gap before the next chapter update.
I wanted to do this," Dean mumbled as he unbuttoned Cas' shirt and pulled the tie off his neck and over his head. "Come on."
It took Rowena around an hour or so to check on Castiel thoroughly before she sent him to the shower room and nap. The Queen returned to the library saying that Cas' condition was good, on recently turned human standard, and all he needed was rest.
The woman who sat before her laptop paused and looked at the strange man in her house. “I still couldn’t get over the fact that Chuck was God. I dated him, I
"Well, this looked like a nice place to have brunch, right boys?" he looked at his husky and his cat who were busy sniffing around, "Maybe we can drop by here more often and have a change of scenery while I work."
“Why should I tell
And once again, he was caught looking at the man.
"Do you think we can summon the new Death?" followed by Jack, who shared a similar expression as Eileen's on his face. "We were thinking, you know, if Billie could visit The Empty anytime she wanted before, maybe the new Death can also do that? As a perk of being Death?"
have a good time when I’m with you, Dean. Dinner
"Well, hello, walk of shame," her cheerful voice greeted Castiel, who laughed and embraced her in a hug.
“Oh, shut up,” he grunted to himself.
Dean rolled his memory to the day that he and his brother moved in to their grandfather’s house, and the day that he knew he was going to have a room of his own, after thirty years or so, and a kitchen where he could have a little adventures with recipes, baking, and all that. He almost felt like a little who was given a free yearly pass to the Disneyland.
“I’m sorry you couldn’t see Castiel now. Are you okay?”
A suspicious van pulled over in front of a house, just as the two brothers suspected. Then from inside the truck, two people wearing mime masks stepped out and looked menacingly into the house. Or
Cas let out a soft gasp and found himself frozen on the spot, with his chest rumbled violently. He was afraid that not only Dean would notice, but also his chest would burst due to the fast-paced activity inside his chest. But, it was nothing compared to what was on his lips.
“Come on, brother. I’m sure that dentist of yours was as upset as you. You didn’t … you didn’t told him off, did you?” Benny asked, absolutely familiar with Dean and his short temper.
The small laugh in Dean’s voice didn’t help Castiel to keep his heart from beating uncontrollably, as he clumsily slides past Dean and placed their mugs on the dining table on the balcony, before sitting down. “Sorry to keep you waiting, I was checking on my ring upstairs. I thought I lost it,” he showed his left hand to Dean.
It took him a while to absorbed it, and when Cas finally understood, he could feel his face heated. “What? Dean, we just met twice at that time! Of course it was unplanned!”
“Winchester.”
“Didn’t you have to read the instruction if you want to cook something new?” Cas really enjoyed the ping-pong teasing.
He should have a bucket list.
Abaddon chuckled at Castiel’s note, “You’re right. Oh God, I’m sorry, but if you’re not ready to have
“Dean, Cas is not in The Empty anymore. I saved him.”
Apparently, Castiel wasn’t the only one who was silently busy finding ways to make his dinner companion smiled throughout the night. Because the simple question from Dean had made him smiled, even if he didn’t intend to, and he really had to give some credit to the other man.
And his heart was right.
When Claire Novak and her friends visited Pamela and Dean's place, they didn’t know any of this information. They were browsing for a nice place to spend the night after their shift ended, and someone from their workplace suggested Blue Remington. So, they think it might be worth a try.
Claire chuckled at that information, “I can see why. She’s gorgeous.”
It took all of Dean’s self-control
smiling since they drove out from the venue. His Saturday night thingy went way better than he expected. Clearly, he didn’t expected to see Cas looking so beautiful in his v-neck and leather jacket. That damn leather jacket that he love to see on Cas.
“I, uh, I just got a call from the security that he might need my help to do a thingy with the electricity for the library. And, uh, I’m new here, so I’m wondering if any of you guys, by any chance, can help me with?”
"Sam, I'm gonna save Cas, whatever it takes. He gave his life to save me, this is the least I could do to him."
“I think so,” Abaddon replied lightly, “There are people from my class who are planning a pub crawl for tonight, so might pick someone or two from there. We’ll see. What about you? Working?”
day, he remembered so well what happened on that day between him and Cas.
The patient also rose to his feet and shook the doctor’s hand, “Sure. Thank you, Doctor.”
"What is the laughter for?" Dean asked cheekily.
Jack did it.
"This time, I'm doing the moving, Dean," Cas said, that sounded more like a threat than romantic if Dean had to be honest.
“What?” Castiel turned his head to his friend’s direction, then to Balthazar as if to ask for confirmation about this news,
Cas chuckled at the question, “Yeah, and I’m quite sure we forgot about our
Dean sat on one of the vacant chairs, “Okay, let’s hear it.”
“Okay. Good. Um, so, I will have the nurse to bring your file and get them sorted out for your payment. Uh, you’re using the-“ Castiel suddenly felt like his brain and body couldn’t function as how he needed it. So instead of saying what he meant, Castiel made a card shape using his fingers.
light prickly touch on his chin, that he chose to ignore. He had experienced such sensation several times, which turned out to be one of the feathers inside his pillow, God knows how did that happened. But this time was different, it was followed with a cold touch on the corner of his lips. That brought Castiel back from his dreams.
"As you wish."
“Thanks, Cas. How’s the kitten?”
beautiful if he could say. Dean had that reckless boyish charm that made him friendly, despite the first time they met. But, probably Castiel would do the same if he ever had to visit a dentist.
Dean put his spoon down and looked to Cas, “You made it as if it was my fault we got stuck with the six-hours cooking.”
“Oh, that’s great! Hope everything works out for you two to make up for what happened yesterday!” Balthazar patted Dean’s arm proudly, then he turned to Sam who was waving from inside the car. “Samuel! It’s good to see you again!”
The thought popped into Dean’s mind as he came closer to the home he has been living in for the past seven years with Sam. A quirky bunker-converted house that they inherited from their paternal grandfather a few years ago. Dean let out a sigh and mentally noted the things he should do before going to bed tonight.
“Doctor Novak?”
He practically bounced to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee. He even whistled one of his favourite songs,
Dean knew he might be being too apparent of wanting Chuck’s slow and painful death. But he didn’t care. Not now. Not for Chuck.
woman Dean had ever really loved.
“Well, you will tomorrow. What else, Cas?”
Castiel nodded hearing that, and he put a masker on before turning on the lights above their heads. He took a deep breath before looking down to his patient – whose head was practically on his lap – squinted and voluntarily opens his mouth. The dark-haired man took a deep breath before bending down a little and started to check on Dean.
The young man soon got his order and turned around to sit on the table just across Castiel’s in a fluid gesture, that almost matched a dancer. He placed his tray on the table and sat, and the sunglasses was taken off of his face.
“Better not,” Dean almost rolled his eyes at the new God.
“Yeah, in few minutes. I have to check on the locks and lights in the living room. Sammy can be a bit forgetful. You?”
To his surprise, the blue-eyed man was giving him a small smile before turning his attention to the vegetable-with-peanut-sauce seller and calls his order.
"I'm so happy everything worked out for you, darling," he said before pulled himself off Cas, and tapped his cheek. "I'll look after him for you at work."
Again, thank you so much for reading and liking my fic, guys!
As they arrived in the snack alley, Dean felt his cheeks started to get sore of all the grinning and smiling. And he started to wonder where did the childish energy in Cas came from, since he was so serious whenever he was at the practice.
“I just found out last night, and-“
Besides of her study, of course.
"'Course not, Uncle Cassie!"
“Right, so, thanks for driving me home, Dean. I’ll see you at the bar again?” Nick sounded hopeful.
Cas looked at Dean owlishly for a few seconds. Before he could say anything, the older Winchester had caught his lips in a passionate kiss.
As he drove by, Dean let out a sigh. It has been a while since he had sex with anyone, but Nick was also the

“Hey,” the tall man looked up to his older brother and the kid, “so Eileen and I came up with an idea this morning, and we agreed that this might worth a shot.”
The red-haired girl gave him a knowing look, “Like I
“Shall we?” Dean pocketed back his wallet and stood up. This time Cas took the jacket and didn’t put it on right way. Dean slightly hoped that he will get the chance to see Cas putting it on later.
Jack smiled in relief when he knew that Dean was no longer upset. "I understand how much you love Cas, Dean, and maybe don't let Cas' sacrifice go in vain, by dying."
Dean practically jumped from his seat when he heard the voice from behind him. He turned around to ensure that he was right about the owner, "Bela?"
When he read the name of the place, Dean frowned, “That place claimed that they cooked their chicken in a healthy way. Something like fat reducing or whatever. How is
“Nope. He only said that he wanted to visit you until next Friday, and I asked Dad if I could go with him,” Claire shrugged and returned her attention to her mobile phone again.
Dean was about to say something about Amara’s note, but She had already waved to them and disappeared right in front of their eyes.
shown that the angel and the older brother were love interests. Who did you based him on, really?"
The brunette's smile got wider when she heard Dean's words, "Well, knowing you died by the Hellhound after I did was good enough for me, Dean. Maybe I should trust you guys more, now I understand why Crowley and my Queen here are very fond of you both. Thank you, boys."
Dammit, Cas, I’m waiting for another ten minutes. If I don’t hear anything from you, I’m coming over.
The man behind the counter nodded with a smile, "Sure, any drinks?"
Cas frowned as he tried to remember, “He said something about hotel and restaurant management, I didn’t quite catch it. He wanted to own a bed and breakfast or something like that someday.”
fix it between you two?" Rowena jumped over Sam's confusion with her excitement. "Fergus, was it as adorable as we expected?"
And why did that man mattered this much to him? He had only seen him once, and in a brief few seconds of staring contest.
his unusual book collection. He didn’t usually show what was he currently reading to a lot of other people. Somehow he didn’t feel comfortable if anybody else knew about this side of him, the part of him who actually liked to read classic novels. Sammy always said that Dean should let other people knew about his intelligence. Dean always snorted at that.
Dean knew how important Eileen was to Sam. He knew how in love his little brother was with the funny and badass girl, just by looking at his happy face whenever Eileen was around. It made Dean believe that Sam had found his happy ending. A life with someone who knew what they were going through and won’t freak out with it.
“Please sit, Dean,” Castiel showed his hand to the direction of the chair, before sitting on his.
“So I can hang around at your place without my allergy getting in the way,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. A gesture that Cas had grown to learn he would do whenever he felt embarrassed. “I, uh, I hope that’s okay. I had the pills in my glove compartment in the Mustang, if you wanna see.”
Both of them gave Lily their best smile, that they would give to a loving aunt, while saying thank you, that earned a sweet smile in return from the waitress lady.
The former king of Hell turned to Dean in a surprised look, "Really? That's interesting information, Squirrel. Hm."
“My older brother gave this to me before I went to England for my studies,” Castiel quickly added when he saw the look on Dean’s face changed a bit. This time he could swear there was a relief on the other man’s face after he explained.
“Okay, okay, Cas. I’ll put it on the seat next to me. Can you hear me?”
Dean never knew that he could be attracted to a man until today. Outside

"Let's say I'm
“What? You play
That he could have what he always wanted, that he could have Dean.
“My pleasure, bro.”
“I believed the workers are zombies,” Bela snorted when the two brothers with her blew up with laughter at her answer. “God, that was an awful thing to say. They are all following orders, just like
“Both would be fine, Dean. I will be sleeping on the sofa bed in front of the telly with Gabriel. Claire will have my bed.”
“Yeah,” Eileen replied cheerfully, accompanied with her hands signing her answer, out of habit. “I was confused, how to call Sam. He took my stuff. My car as well.”
“I, uh, I hope this won’t came too hard to you,” Dean started and walked towards Cas. Invaded his personal space to be exact.
“Huh. Okay. So, that was the story of Dean Winchester,” Dean felt another stroke of blush went through his face as he saw the man in front of him was looking back at him with a curious state. He cleared his throat before keeping the conversation going, “Hey, I feel like coffee, you want anything, Cas?”
you off from him."
Castiel scoffed lightly before replying, “Hello, Dean,” and he grabbed Dean’s jacket to pull him closer for more kisses.
Castiel never thought what Gabriel called ‘a place’ was something like this, considering the fact that Lucifer hardly ever be in Vancouver. Then when Castiel called his oldest brother to ask if he could rent the place, Lucifer practically threw the key to him and told him to go nuts, free of charge. It was as if Lucifer wanted to give the place for his little brother. Or to get rid of it?
“Doctor Novak, here’s Mr. Winchester for you,” the nurse, Meg, handed the patient folder specified for his next patient.
A beautiful brunette with bright green eyes walked to them and gave Gabriel a tight hug. "How's it going, stranger? It's been a while since I saw you here."
Before he could blink, or at least it seemed that way, the windows were closed and the SUV had backed off the sidewalk and was heading away at a good clip. The guns were put away, and the driver glanced at him using the rearview mirror.
“Dean, what are you doing?”
Cas was so wrapped up in singing along to ‘Boys of Summer’ that he didn’t hear the buzzer go off when an unexpected customer came in the door. He was also too busy turning to and then gawking at Mr. July in every single calendar he took from the box and put on the shelf to notice that he wasn’t alone in the aisle. Finally, he was completely unaware that someone was standing directly behind him when he had said calendar open to July, sighed, and stopped singing long enough to say “I’d let you put out my fire any day.”
Dean opened his eyes and blinked, the light from the lamp didn’t hurt for once. Weird.  He felt…different.  He paused for a second trying to put his finger on exactly what that feeling was, and then he realized that it was both the absence of the dull buzz of alcohol in his system, as well as the absence of a hangover when the alcohol wasn’t there.  He was stone-cold sober for the first time since, well, since he could remember.  It had been awhile.  A long while.
“Maybe next time you see him you should give him a promise ring or something, sounds like you’re dating.”
“Yes. Just for you, Castiel.” He sounded a little breathless, even to his own ears.
“Good, thank-you.”
“I don’t want to, but I probably should.  Nightmares tonight either way, right?”  He reached his right hand over and took Cas’s left, looking at the silver wedding band that matched his own.  Almost five years married on top of a decade of friendship, and he still had secrets to unwrap with the angel who knew him better than anyone else ever would.  He laced their fingers together and looked at his husband.  “I’d give you a kiss right now, but my breath probably smells like ass and you’ve got blood on your cheek.”
“In exchange for those consulting services…”
What the hell, might as well go all in. “I’m just so tired Cas, tired of all of it. I’m 41 years old, too broken to be any damn good to anyone, and I’m just tired of always being one step ahead of death. Sometimes I feel like it would be easier for, ah, all of us, if I, ah, just let go and let it catch me.”
Cas put his palm on the door and pushed against it to open it further, but not with more strength than Dean was easily able to counter.
to calm down. Probably a drinker, looked like a whiskey and beer kind of guy vs the expensive scotch drinkers he usually worked with.  He could already tell that the man needed an outlet, and if the meeting went well, he suspected that he might be able to help him.
And all he’d ever had to do was tell him. Should have been the easiest and most important thing he’d ever done. Except he never did, his own baggage twisting the best thing that had ever happened into knots of pain and barbed wire, leaving both of their hearts shredded.
“Nothing as important as watching Tombstone again.  Let’s do that.”  Dean recognized that as Cas’s classic evasion strategy.
“I am not sorry that it happened if it means that we are here now though.  This, you here with me is already more than I had ever hoped, and I’m not going anywhere. Ever again.” He ran his thumb down along the line of Dean’s jaw, and around to rub it across his bottom lip. An intimate gesture that Dean accepted and encouraged in return by parting his lips just enough to quickly dart his tongue out lick the pad, following it with a feather-light kiss.  Cas choked back a loan groan and his pupils blew wide and dark.
That done, he removed his suit from today. The stress sweat hadn’t been kind and it went in the pile that would need to go straight to the cleaners. Cas’ was probably in a similar state and he made a mental note to make sure Charlie would take care of this before their first public event.
“From what I’ve read about you, as well as the brief time we’ve spent together, I know that you are an inherently good man. Right down to your core, it’s obvious, you are worthy and worth knowing.”
“Hey Cas, maybe you’re too tired to fight anymore.  I get it man, I really do.  If you can hear me, I just want you to know that it’s ok…” he swallowed thickly and took one last deep breath, “…Cas, I love you, pretty sure I always have.  If I can find you again, I will.”
“Yeah, Cas, because I love you. And, um…hopefully because you love me too?”
“Open it.”
Sam stood still and watched. He didn’t say a word but the wheels in his head were spinning until it was like a gear caught and everything fell into place. He wordlessly observed as Dean closed the bag, checked the pocket again, walked it back to the table, and then walked towards him, presumably to throw him out. In response, Sam widened his stance to lower his center of gravity and make himself harder to move in case that became a thing in the next minute.
Castiel’s grip on him changed, as he knelt beside him so he could look Dean in the face. His open expression had returned. “I’m so proud of you Dean, we are almost there ok? Just hold on.”
“Did you know, every time, it got worse? Dean’s reaction?  He never took it well, not once, but it got harder for him every single time. You never had to see that part did you Cas? But I did.”  The frustration and anger started to bubble up again. “When Lucifer came out of the rift and stabbed you, Dean sat by your body for hours Cas. Hours until your body was cold.  Then he brought you inside and insisted on prepping you for your funeral pyre, alone without help. Nobody was going to touch you. Only Dean.”
“It is amazing, but after a few weeks it loses a lot of the glamour” Dean mumbled, fiddling with their fingers. “I know it’s a incredible opportunity but it’s no fun with nobody there. Both you and Sammy been too busy for me.”
Another pause as the audience’s excitement rose, Dean grinned scanning the audience, trying to seem casual, till it reached where Cas was seating, up and center, inconspicuous to the audience.
! Dean’s housewarming party guests edition!” Ellen grinned broadly as Dean slouched in his seat and groaned.
“Keep watching dearie!” Rowena answered cheerfully.
There in front of Cas, in a black hoodie and black jeans was Dean Winchester. Dean’s green eyes warm and soft, and a almost shy, sweet smile made all the annoyance and hand pain disappear from his mind as he bulldozed into Dean, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist.
The song Dean sings is "Kiss Me" by Ed Sheeran! Its so beautiful and heartfelt! I thought it was perfect for deancas.
Finally, at about 4:00 am when Dean started to become disoriented and his hands started shaking ever so slightly – he had called Sam for back-up.  Sam got on the road immediately, and within the hour, before the sun had even considered rising, the three of them were on the way to the nearest hospital with an open emergency department.  Sam drove while Cas sat in the back with Dean, and they made record time.
The bed had four sturdy posts at the end of its headboard and footboard. Discreetly, although now that he could see them, it was obvious, there was a wrought iron band on each one. Affixed to the bands were some pretty serious looking rings.  Eyes widening at that particular and really hot concept, he shot a look at Cas who had been watching and waiting for a response.
