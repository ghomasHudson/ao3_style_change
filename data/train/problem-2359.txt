“Always know how to make a guy feel good about himself, Ben,” Dean says sarcastically as he claps Benny on the back with his good hand.
“Look, Cas, I’m sorry. I thought you were into it, I read the situation wrong. Won’t happen again,” Dean interrupts, turning to face the window.
Come to think of it, no. Dean doesn’t have a picture of Cas. They haven’t been seeing each other that long, though, so it’s not weird…right?
“I must be missing something. You made out with him and now he wants to meet you for coffee and this is a bad thing?” Charlie asks, confused.
“Me and the guys fiddled around a little in prep for the Grammy’s, we played pool, got drunk, you know. Ended up gettin’ real late so rather than drive home drunk, I just slept at Benny’s, which is why I didn’t get your letter ‘til this morning when I got home.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but he gets out anyway. He’s really not in the mood for this, but he knows Benny’s only trying to help, so he tries to have a good time.
“She sent me over here because she wasn’t in the mood to burst a vein in her head having to deal with you tonight, Benny,” Jo fires at him.
“Are you taking me somewhere secluded so you can kill me? This is how I die, isn’t it? I knew I should have told someone who I was going to Mexico with so they’d know who to look for when they find my body,” Cas teases.
They make out for a few more minutes and then Cas flips them over so that he’s on top and he begins to unbuckle his pants.
Right around noon, they’re startled by a loud crash outside the front door. Moments later, John Winchester storms into the house.
Sam sighs, “I was just telling him about Jess, ya know? How she’s smart, funny, beautiful…” Sam trails off.
Dean loses it. He lunges at John, punching him in the jaw with so much force that it sends John to the ground.
“He-mmm,” Dean starts to say before he realizes what Charlie said. “He’s this guy I’ve been seeing,” he finishes, shooting Charlie a playful glare.
“You heard about that, huh?” He says, failing in his attempt to hide the smile creeping up at the corners of his mouth.
They pull into the parking lot of a local diner about 15 minutes later. Cas follows Dean inside, keeping a reasonable distance between them.
Dean smiles at her, then walks over to Cas and Cas greets him with a smile. Maybe this won’t be as bad as he’s expecting.
Dean waits for Cas to relax, and he does after a moment. Dean slowly starts to pull out and push back in, carefully watching Cas’ face for any sign that Dean should stop. He doesn’t see one though, so he continues and picks up his speed.
“Come on, dad. Let’s go,” Dean says, grabbing John’s arm to walk him back towards the door. John jerks his arm out of Dean’s grasp, though, and walks over to Cas and Jess.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s always sort of known he was attracted to both men and women. Even when he was younger, and his dad tried to ingrain in him that boys like girls, not other boys whenever he expressed interest in someone of the same sex. It was never something he struggled with internally, only externally with others.
Sam’s face turns bright red and Dean can tell this is the girl he’s refused to name whenever Dean bugged him about who’s been making him so happy lately.
Dean wakes up hungover as fuck around ten am. He props himself up on his elbows and blinks a few times to allow his eyes to adjust to the strange surroundings.
would make a pretty good medley. And, Dean, I know you said you didn’t really wanna do a medley, but why don’t we rework it and see what you think?” Ash suggests.
“Damn right. I’ve got more contr-fffffuck,” Dean arches his back and bites down hard on his bottom lip as he comes.
“Sam has court in the morning, Dean. He needs to be well rested,” Jess says, glaring at Dean in a way that looks innocent, but Dean can tell there’s underlying sharpness to it.
“So, uh,” Dean tries to find an excuse to keep talking to Castiel when he catches a glimpse of a tattoo on Castiel’s wrist.
“Dean,” Sam says again. Dean still doesn’t answer. “You know, you’re not the only one who lost someone. Jack and I lost him too and I lost Ei-,” he stops, on the verge of tears himself. He doesn’t say anything else, shutting the door on his way out.
“Forgive me for sounding like an idiot, but what does this mean for his chances?” Dean asks. He glances at Sam and he see’s the question break him just a little bit, but he had to ask. He knew Sam wouldn’t have.
Dean grins against Cas’ mouth and continues kissing him, hard. Cas reluctantly pulls away so he can focus on finishing Dean off.
“Look, Dean,” Meg shoots back, noticing his name on his visitor tag as well, “I’m not the doctor so I can’t give you any more information. You’re gonna have to wait for him to get out of surgery.”
After the minor delay regarding who’s topping and who’s bottoming, they pick up right where they left off. Dean pulls his jeans and boxers off and starts rolling the bottle of lube between his hands.
“So, you’re letting Cas cook?” Claire asks, making a face. “We might have to grab something after we get outta here,” she whispers to Kaia.
“Lately, though, you’ve flown to LA, Oklahoma, New York...why is this one any different?” Cas chimes in.
Dean wipes the corners of his mouth with his thumb before sucking it into his mouth to clean it off. He watches as Cas catches his breath, sitting back up to look down at Dean.
“I just want Chuck gone. Whatever it takes. So, are we gonna do this or are we gonna sit here and talk about our feelings all damn day?” Dean says. He raises an eyebrow at Sam, who sighs and gets up from the table.
Dean doesn’t say anything. He just continues to swirl his straw around in the glass of water he was forced to get because Sam wouldn’t let him order a beer.
“Yeah, you know. Met someone at the bar and it got those creative juices flowing,” he chuckles, making sure not to make eye contact with Sam.
“Been good, Sam. Real good. Looks like you’ve been good yourself,” Benny says as he nods his head towards Jess and winks. She laughs and Sam’s face turns bright red.
“Coming right up,” she replies without walking away, “You look like you’ve had a helluva night. Want me to put in an order for our famous hangover cure?”
“Uh, yeah, I mean it, uh,” Dean stutters, struggling to word his answer in a way that won’t make him sound like a love drunk idiot over some guy he just met and hasn’t heard from since. “I, uh, I’m not in a relationship, let’s start there.”
“Damn, man. I think this is probably the last thing I expected to pull up to when I was on my way over here,” the man says, in awe of the large house.
Lee gets out of the bed and searches the room for his clothes. Dean can’t help but marvel at the man’s bare features. He really does miss what he and Lee had when they were kids, but that ship has long since left the dock.
“Yeah, well you may not feel hungry but I know your body needs something. No one’s heard from you in three days, so I’m assuming you haven’t eaten in as many.”
“I’m alright, you stay there,” Castiel demands as he walks back into the kitchen to retrieve the main course.
Sam walks to the kitchen with his arm draped around Dean, practically holding him up. He seats him on the bench before moving to the other side to sit across from him.
All of the guys have eventually made their way over towards the stage to throw some ones at the performers while Dean stays back at their table. He’s about four whiskeys in when a tall woman in hot pink stilettos stops in front of him and smiles.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs, “yeah, it’s not about anyone I’m seeing. I don’t know what to say, I met someone in a bar a few nights ago and the whole thing just kind of sparked a few good lines.”
“That song?” Cas’ tone changes, he’s angry now too. “Do you really fucking think that’s how it is? You think I’ve already moved on? Really, Dean?”
Dean laughs and walks over to take the movie out and put it back on the shelf while Cas gets a couple of bowls out of the cabinet.
“I do want this, Dean. I’m sorry if, even for a second, I’ve ever made you feel like I didn’t,” Cas says, taking his hand under the table.
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” she says as she offers him a side hug, looking less than ecstatic to be here.
Sam looks back up with a huge smile on his face. Sam will never admit it, but Dean knows his approval is important to him.
“I still have a ways to go before I’m ready for the world to know, but I wanted to make sure that at least the people most important to you knew the truth.”
“Always the charmer, Dean,” she says, “so you’re here for pie, huh? I should’ve known. That nose can smell homemade apple pie from a mile away.”
This lap dance has turned into more of a therapy session, but Dean’s not mad about it. In fact, he prefers it. He wasn’t really in the mood for this tonight anyway and it’s easier to talk about this with someone he knows he’s never gonna see again.
Dean glances at Cas and then back at the mirror in front of him, messing with the already straightened tie around his neck.
Realization sets in on Dean’s face. He doesn’t say anything, but he thinks he might know where this is headed. There’s only one reason John Winchester would get mad at his straight son over a girl.
He begins licking under the head of Cas’ cock before taking it in his mouth. He slides his mouth down until his lips hit the base of Cas’ dick. After bobbing his head a few times, he swallows around Cas, his throat tightening and sending chills up Cas’ spine.
“Morning,” Dean mouths to Bobby, who acknowledges him with a nod and a finger telling him to hang on a minute.
They made plans to meet back at Dean’s house for dinner, so Dean heads out to the grocery store so he can make Cas a proper meal.
“Okay, Cas. I know this is your first time, so if you need me to stop, just say the word. I’ll try not to go too fast.”
“Sure, although I don’t know who Sue is or what she has to do with your dinner tonight,” Cas responds, matter of factly, taking a bite of his own breakfast.
Dean thinks for a moment. He checks his phone again and sees that he still doesn’t have any missed texts or calls from Cas.
It’s only the middle of the day, but Dean is already exhausted, so he and Cas lay in his bed the rest of the day watching Christmas movies until they both finally doze off.
He sits in the waiting area for about an hour before they actually bring him back to x-ray his hand. Definitely broken.
Cas clears his throat and snaps Dean back to reality. He realizes he hasn’t said anything back. His face turns hot and he rubs a hand over the back of his neck.
Cas stops what he’s doing and looks down at Dean, “are you really not ready or are you still being stubborn about bottoming?”
There isn’t much decorating the spacious interior at the moment. Benny moved in about a week before Christmas, so all that’s really set up as far as Dean can tell are a couple couches in the living room, a pool table in the den and a table with two chairs around it in the kitchen.
“Y’all have been absolutely amazing tonight! Now who’s ready for Luke Bryan?!” Dean drags out the end of Luke’s last name as the crowd cheers.
“Dunno, first time in here far as I can tell,” Jo says as she wipes a ring of condensation off the bar in front of Dean.
The truth is, Dean doesn’t really know what happened. He remembers going to the strip club. He also vaguely remembers getting a lap dance from a stripper. After that, it’s fuzzy.
Dean gets out and jogs behind him, grabbing his hand when he catches up. He spins Cas around and cups his face in his hands.
The spaghetti is amazing. The sauce was great on its own but paired with the pasta and cheese Castiel grated on top is like heaven in Dean’s mouth.
“We’ll pick up some condoms on the way home from the party tonight and then we can really celebrate. Sound good?” Dean proposes.
“I’ve been banging on your door for twenty minutes, Dean. What the hell took you-what the fuck happened to your arm?”
“I remember,” Dean laughs, “trust me, there’s just something about Jody’s pies. And, as a pie enthusiast, I can, with 100% certainty, say that this is the best damn apple pie in the country.”
Dean slides his hand up the back of Lee’s shirt and Lee moans at the touch of Dean’s fingertips against his skin.
“Benny’s just an affectionate person, Cas,” Dean cuts him off. “Benny’s as straight as an arrow. Trust me, he’s not interested in me like that.”
“You think I haven’t tried talking to him, Sam? I’ve texted him, I’ve called him, I’ve shown up at his fucking apartment. He won’t talk to me. There’s nothing I can do.”
“If you’re happy, I’m happy, boy. But if he tries anything cute, I’ll be the first one to knock him on his ass, with the boys to follow.”
“Here, y’all can sit here,” Benny says as he slides out from the booth and walks over to snag a chair from another table.
“It is, but I don’t want a lecture. I overreacted at the studio. It-,” he hesitates, “the situation was more complicated than I realized.”
“How’d it feel? I mean, just being in the audience was surreal for me and especially for Jess. But you being up on that stage? I can’t even imagine,” Sam rambles.
“Are you sure? Because we can stop, Dean. I won’t be mad or offended or anything,” Cas says, studying Dean’s face. He really can’t tell if Dean is enjoying this.
“Woah, hey, Benny what the fuck,” Dean says attempting to grab the beer before he pours it out. “That was my last one, man, what the hell?”
The look of pure shock on Dean’s face is one Cas catches immediately but doesn’t acknowledge right away. Everyone at the table begins to clap for them, talking over one another about how they’d all figured it out for the most part. The only person who was genuinely unaware of Dean and Cas’ relationship was Andrea, which was to be expected.
Heated, Cas looks Dean’s bare chest up and down before lunging forward and crashing their lips together. The force knocks Dean back a step, but he doesn’t break away from Cas.
The song, Life Changes by Thomas Rhett, ends and Storme welcomes the listeners back to his morning show.
“Oh, like you’re any better? M’fine,” Castiel says as he pulls his arm out of Dean’s grip, almost knocking himself over in the process.
“Hey, watch it. I am not old, okay? This one makes sure of that,” Dean says, rustling Alma Grace’s hair. She giggles and reaches for him to pick her up.
“Hey, I’m just being careful. Unfortunately, it’s just one of those extra steps we gotta take,” Dean says, feeling bad that he threw a wrench in the gears.
“We don’t really need to do this, Cas. I only walked over here because my brother practically forced me to come talk to you. We don’t have to do the whole song and dance,” Dean interrupts.
“Stop whining, there’s about to be a lot more in your ass. My knee is the least of your worries,” Cas shoots back, making no attempt to move his knee.
“Alright, well, like you said, it’s none of your business, so if you’ll excuse me,” Dean changes the topic.
“I was just, uh, I don’t know. I just hadn’t gotten around to it. I guess word travels fast, though, huh?” Dean responds, grinning up at his brother.
“I know this is going to be really difficult to hear, but…,” he looks at Dean who nods and squeezes his knee. “Dean isn’t just my friend, he’s my boyfriend…I’m gay.”
Cas nods and walks over to a table for two. A waitress comes over and asks if she can get them anything. Cas orders a Caramel Latte and Dean just orders a coffee, black. He’s never been able to get into all that fru, fru shit coffee places serve nowadays.
“No-I mean, yes, but not in the way you think. I don’t want people to know. At least not right now. I’m not ready for that, yet,” Cas says.
When he finishes brushing his teeth to get the taste of last night’s binge drinking out of his mouth, he walks back over to his phone. No texts, no calls. Castiel didn’t text. Castiel didn’t call. Dean’s face falls.
“Well, uh, the inspiration came from….life. As cheesy as that sounds,” Dean laughs, “I mean there’s not much to say without spoiling anything. But I am really proud of this one. We’ve worked really hard on it, spent 12 to 15 hour days in the studio making sure she’s perfect. The release is a long time coming.”
They move to the center of the bed and position themselves. Cas pops open the bottle of lube and squeezes some onto his fingers.
When he walks in, she’s sitting at the same table in the back that she always is, but this time, she’s got company.
“Sam’s been with him every day, making sure he knows he’s not alone,” Jess says, glancing at Dean. It’s so quick, yet so subtle, if he’d blinked, he would’ve missed it.
“He just gave me some good advice. Peace of mind,” he says. Cas doesn’t pry. Dean pulls out of the driveway and heads back to the hotel.
“I’m sorry, Cas. It truly wasn’t something I was aware that you were uncomfortable with at the time. When we met, I didn’t know you weren’t out. Hell, I didn’t even know you were straight. Not the way you had me pinned up against your bedroom door with your tongue down my throat and your knee between my legs,” Dean teases.
They have plans to celebrate tonight at the Roadhouse, but in the meantime, he’s meeting with Bobby to discuss tour details.
Dean works on this song, writing the chorus for what feels like only 15 minutes. He can’t get it right, it’s not flowing the way he wants it to. He glances at his watch and notices it’s 5:45 pm. Damn, he’s been working on this a lot longer than he thought, and he’s gotten nowhere. He sighs and lifts himself up from his chair, closing his song book and leaving it in his studio.
“Where’s Cas?” Sam asks, dipping his finger in the caramel glaze Dean had just set on the counter. Dean smacks his hand with a spatula before answering.
He smiles at her and squeezes her arm. He and Charlie may joke around with each other a lot, but he knows she’s always got his back and she knows he’s always got hers.
“I’m gonna go find out what the fuck is going on. Stay here, Sammy,” Dean interrupts, already walking away to find the nearest nurses’ station.
Castiel doesn’t answer him, so he finally looks over at him and he’s met with Cas just staring at him with adoration.
“Please tell me you’ve at least had something to drink in the past three days that wasn’t alcohol,” Sam says with a concerned look on his face as he eyes all of the empty liquor bottles scattered around the room.
“I met someone last night. Thought we hit it off, but I haven’t heard from him,” Dean sighs, “it’s not important. Let’s just get this track fixed.”
“I love you too, Cas. I’m in love with you. I have been for as long I can remember. I’m sorry I never said anything, I just didn’t think…I was afraid if I let myself…,” he can’t seem to find the right words to say. “I didn’t want it to be used against us, so I just tried to bury it. I’m sorry. I should’ve told you.”
“What’d I miss?” Dean asks, instinctively going to put his arm around Cas’ shoulders before remembering they’re in public and reaching up to rub the back of his neck instead.
This is such an awkward conversation to have. No one wants to come right out and ask if their partner is positive, but Dean’s always been careful about this kind of thing. No matter who it is, he always makes sure that everything’s laid out on the table.
“You act like I don’t own any suits, Cas. What kind of man would I be if I didn’t own any nice, tailored suits?” Dean says, slightly offended by the assumption.
“Anyway,” Dean continues, shaking his head, “I showed up to Sammy’s apartment yesterday and my dad was in there screaming his head off. He said a bunch of shit to me about me not being a real man and shit and, uh, yeah that’s where the bruise came from,” Dean finishes.
“Because I was scared,” he says. “Scared of this, scared of us. Scared of the world knowing. Scared of allowing myself to feel this way.”
“I know you can. You’ve been practicing day and night. You actually sing in your sleep, you know,” Cas whispers, to make sure no one else in the dressing room overhears. “I’m pretty sure even I know all the words at this point.”
“Alright, alright, well, as much as we’d love to hear all about the new mystery lover in Dean’s life, unfortunately, the segment is almost over and we’ve gotta start wrapping up,” Storme says, much to Dean’s relief.
“No ‘buts’, I’m glad it ended up working out for you. Are you gonna see him again?” Sam asks. Dean’s not convinced there isn’t some underlying doubt, but he moves on anyway, remembering that he texted Cas and hadn’t checked his phone since.
“I know, it’s not your fault, Dean. I’m just worried that the more people that know, the faster it will get around and I’m not ready for that.”
They clean up their dinner and Cas heads home, despite Dean’s numerous objections and pleas for Cas to stay the night again.
Benny leads Dean up the stairs. Climbing these 12 steps feels like climbing Mount Everest. Maybe Dean’s a lot more drunk than he initially thought. After all, he had been drinking all afternoon as well. He decides it’s probably a good thing he chose to stay.
Dean and Cas break away from the crowd towards the end of the bar. Once they’re seated, Cas leans in so Dean can hear him over the loud music.
Dean’s interrupted by Castiel’s lips smashing into his. It takes him a second to realize what’s happening as Castiel brings him inside and presses him up against the now closed apartment door.
He watches his screen as the text goes through. Those three little dots don’t pop up, so he locks his phone and forgets about it.
“Hey, hey. How’s my favorite twenty-something?” Dean says as the girls walk into the den. “And Claire, how are you?”
Dean slides his hands down the back of Cas’ pants, cupping his ass. He bites Cas’ bottom lip and then starts to kiss along Cas’ jaw and down his neck.
“Rough night.” Dean responds. He still has a pounding headache and he’s really not in the mood to make small talk with the driver. Luckily, the driver takes the hint and doesn’t talk to him again until he drops him off.
Dean smiles again, definitely enjoying this side of Cas. He shifts his hips a little as Cas inserts his finger. Dean tenses up and squeezes his eyes shut.
Once Dean is three fingers deep, he asks Cas if he’s ready. He nods, and Dean rolls the condom on and positions himself at the entrance of Cas’ hole.
He still hasn’t spoken to Castiel, despite his continuous efforts to reach out to him. Now that he’s about to leave for his tour, there’s nothing he would rather do less since Cas won’t be going with him this time.
“Sorry, what?” He asks, ripping his eyes away from Cas and taking a long sip to finish the fruity cocktail in his hand that Charlie insisted he try.
“His dad’s a preacher, he grew up in church. He’s just scared of his family finding out, even if he is hundreds of miles away…,” Dean trails off and then, “oh, fuck.”
The second they get out of the airport, they’re bombarded with cameras flashing in their faces. There are dozens of people shouting at them at once, Dean can’t quite make out any of the questions until someone, louder than all the rest, asks,
Cas sits down at the table and watches Dean. He looks really sexy behind that grill. He tells him about the cases he had today as he tries to ignore the heat creeping up on the back of his neck.
The room is silent for what feels like forever as Naomi and Bart exchange looks with each other, and then with Dean and Cas.
Cas hasn’t looked up from his menu at all since Dean started talking and he kind of wants to look Cas in the eye when he tells him the news.
Dean nods and shakes himself off. They head back out on stage and Benny picks his guitar up off the stand. Dean apologizes to the crowd and they cheer.
“Honestly, not the most comfortable place I’ve ever slept but also not the most uncomfortable place so…,” Dean trails off.
They spend the rest of the night talking, laughing, and drinking. They talk about the album releasing in a couple of weeks. Sam, Cas, and Jess talk legal shit while Dean and Benny sit there completely lost. They talk about random things too like who they think is going to win the Titans vs Redskins game on Sunday. Overall, Dean ends up having a much better time than he’d expected for this night to go.
“I know what you mean. Um, no. That’s not something that’s ever really been on my radar. I don’t usually have unprotected sex,” Cas answers.
Lee lets himself fall down onto the bed with Dean standing over him as he fumbles with the buckle on his jeans. The cast and alcohol combo really isn’t doing him any favors.
“Thank you,” Cas says. He’s silent for a moment and Dean almost gets up and leaves again. He doesn’t have time to sit here and be toyed around with.
“I told you my mom died when I was eleven and how my old man just kind of fell apart,” Dean says, not so much asking as much as reminding Cas. “Fell apart is sort of an understatement. He, uh, he pretty much lost everything after he lost her. We bounced around a lot that year to different apartments in Lawrence because my dad couldn’t keep a job. Before Bobby moved us here, I mean. He just, uh, he started drinking and he, he never really stopped.”
He leans over the counter and stares at himself in the mirror for a moment before turning on the sink and wetting a washcloth with warm water to wipe his face.
“What brought this on? You haven’t had an episode like this since-,” Sam stops as it dawns on him that the last time Dean wouldn’t get out of bed for days on end was after his last breakup. “The pictures.”
Dean wraps his fist around Lee’s erection and tries to stroke him to the same rhythm, which proves to be exceedingly difficult with his non-dominant hand. Lee grips Dean’s shoulder hard, digging his nails into his skin. He knows there’ll be marks there tomorrow, but right now, he can’t find it in him to care.
They make their way to the bedroom, leaving a trail of clothes on the floor as they walk. When they make it to the bedroom, Dean gently pushes Cas down on the bed as he climbs on top of him.
“One bacon burger coming up. Dean Winchester, I swear to you, you keep bringing that boy in here, I’m gonna be in a grave quicker than he can decide what to order,” Ellen warns. Dean laughs, he knows Benny does it just to pick on her.
“Not yet,” Dean says as he repositions himself. He looks Cas in the eye and slams into him one more time, making sure to veer slightly to the side, just enough to hit Cas’ prostate in the most pleasure inducing way.
Before Dean can respond, Cas pulls away and grabs his trench coat off the coat hanger by the door. He opens the door to leave but turns to Dean before walking out.
“I said what’s this I’ve been hearing about a Grammy performance?” Sam repeats, crossing his arms over his chest.
As soon as Dean knows Sam is gone, he heads downstairs to the bar in his living room and pours himself a drink. He’s running low, so he makes a mental note that he’ll have to run to the liquor store soon to restock.
“Oh, remember that guy I told you about? Met him at the Roadhouse, the song from the sushi bar?” Dean says.
Dean shoots a playful glare in his direction before throwing the sweatpants he was still holding at Benny’s face.
“No, no it’s cool, I, uh,” Dean pauses for a moment and looks down at his feet. “My mom was religious so I grew up around it…,” he pauses again.
Dean almost listens to him and backs off when John lunges at him and connects the left side of Dean’s jaw with his fist.
Dean smiles and slides into the booth next to Sam as Brady gets up and grabs a chair from a nearby table to pull up to the end of theirs.
Castiel hasn’t looked away from Dean yet, studying him. Dean reaches up and brushes the back of his neck awkwardly.
Dean turns his head and looks Castiel in the eye. He doesn’t know what’s going on right now. Castiel looks sincere, but he barely knows him. How would he know what sincerity looks like on his face? Maybe this is pity. Castiel pities Dean because Dean misunderstood the situation and now-
“If you ever need some spiritual guidance, or just someone to talk to, you can always give me a call,” he says, handing Dean a business card. Dean lets out a small laugh. He didn’t know preachers had business cards.
“Cas, I’d like you to meet my best friend, Benny, my brother, Sammy, and his girlfriend Jess. Guys, this is my friend, Cas,” Dean says by way of introduction. ‘Friend’, it still hits his ear wrong.
“And I didn’t really want to go into it right there because, like I said, it’s a lot,” Dean adds. He waits for Cas to respond. When he doesn't, Dean continues.
Cas pulls Dean with him as he walks backwards towards the bed. When his knees hit the edge of the bed, he shimmies his pants and boxers the rest of the way down his thighs and sits down.
“No, no, I do not fly all the time. Normally, I’m safely on the ground in a tour bus,” Dean says, gripping the arms of his seat like his life depends on it.
“Nah, nah, nah, here, lemme see those,” Dean says, grabbing the plates, “you gotta heat ‘em up. If you can’t eat it fresh out of the oven, nuke it. You got any vanilla ice cream?” He asks.
They stop at the door to his room to come up for air. But as soon as Dean sees the flushed color of Cas’ cheeks and the ways his teeth scrape across his bottom lip, he goes back in for more.
Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I've kind of had writer's block and I didn't want to post all of the chapters I've had written thus far without anything else behind them so I just didn't post. I think I'm over the block now though so hopefully updates will become more frequent again!
Dean turns to his band and motions for them to check their phones for the notes. He’s never even practiced this song with them, but he doesn’t care. He’s a little drunk and he’s hurting, so things couldn’t possibly get any worse.
The first few cords begin to play and the entire crowd starts screaming and cheering. From backstage, Cas feels bumps raise on his arms and on the back of his neck. He knows exactly what song this is.
“He pouted, like the two year old he is, but at least he’s staying out of the kitchen. He doesn’t trust my cooking skills, however.”
Dean raises his eyebrow and bites his lip as he searches Benny’s face for a hint that there was any other reason. Benny notices this and his demeanor changes.
He doesn’t wait for Cas to respond, he jogs back into the dressing room and hunches over the counter staring at himself in the mirror.
“Dean,” A short woman in her fifties says as she comes out from behind the station and wraps her arms around his neck. “So good to see you!”
“The deal was Cas for Jack, but not right away. The empty would come when Cas was…was truly happy and take him forever,” Dean says, his voice shakes.
He gets up and walks over to the bar, stopping halfway there to debate whether or not he really wants to do this right now.
“I got it,” Cas says, sending chills up Dean’s spine. Has he mentioned assertive Cas really turns him on?
“It’s okay, Dean. I understand,” she says as she gets up off his lap. She helps him up and they walk towards the door.
“Yeah, yeah he does,” Sam says. “Dean’s a natural born performer. He’s always been the center of attention for as long as I can remember.”
“Cas, you can sleep here. We don’t have to do anything tonight if you wanna just go to bed,” Dean says back.
“I got it earlier that day. My, uh, my jaw connected with my old man’s fist,” Dean says, laughing it off to try and hide how hard this is for him to talk about. Cas looks him in the eye, concern spreading across his face again. “I didn’t wanna say that because, because it begs the question of ‘why’, right?”
“Locking Chuck away must’ve brought everyone back,” Sam says, a huge smile spreading across his face.
Dean pulls into the hospital parking lot about twenty minutes later. He runs into the emergency room and heads straight to the front desk.
Castiel takes his eyes off the tv as Ellen sets down another beer. He takes this opportunity to look at Dean for the first time since he sat down next to him. He hadn’t noticed how green Dean’s eyes are before now.
“Shit,” he mumbles, rubbing his face with his hands. He throws on a pair of dark jeans, a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and a black blazer. On his way out, he pulls on his favorite cowboy boots and locks the door behind him.
The rest of the interview is mainly about the album and any tidbits they can manage to squeeze out of Dean. He’s having a blast, as usual, laughing with them until his sides hurt. As the segment nears its end, though, Storme takes a detour and catches Dean completely off guard with questions about his personal life.
“Don’t say that. This isn’t your fault, Dean. You did everything you could to keep it secluded,” Sam pauses for a moment before saying, “did he ever tell you why? I mean other than the usual reasons.”
“He’s, uh, better. A lot better. Doc says he’s gonna be discharged in a few days,” Sam answers. Dean didn’t realize John was healed enough to be discharged.
They manage their way to the elevator and up to Castiel’s apartment on the eighth floor. Castiel struggles with the key but manages to open the door after dropping it and cursing a few times as Dean laughs at him.
He and Cas just sit there in silence for a long time. Dean’s actually grateful for the silence because he needs a minute to put himself back together.
Dean laughs and gets out of bed. Cas is off today so he doesn’t blame him for not wanting to get up early. He jumps in the shower and then heads out to meet Bobby.
When he steps onto the bus, instead of the normal whooping and cheering that usually occurs when he enters the bus, he’s met with silent stares of concern and pity. He tosses his bag onto one of the couches and makes his way to one of the bunk beds where he stays until they get back to Nashville.
“Oh, you know what? Fuck off. The past few weeks haven’t exactly been easy for me,” Dean yells. “Okay? I-I-I, I get dumped by the guy that I could actually see myself spending the rest of my life with and then I’m supposed to just, just forget about all that? Just drop everything and, and go on tour? Are you fucking kidding me? Like, excuse the fuck outta me if I’ve been a piece of shit lately, but I’m just really not doing very-,” he stops himself.
They walk in the restaurant and they’re immediately hit with a decadent scent coming from the kitchen. Dean closes his eyes and takes it in.
John sees who it was that just about knocked him on his ass, and he starts laughing. A laugh that gives Dean chills whenever he hears it. It’s not a normal ‘ha-ha’ laugh. This one is mocking, bordering on evil.
“That’s just it, I don’t know. I asked him but all he said was ‘it’s fine’," he says, mimicking Cas' gravelly voice. "Like, whatever happened was fine, but he wouldn’t tell me what
“Yep, yep, I know. I’ll tell him. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh, okay. Yep. Alright, bye,” He says into the phone. “Alright, boy, we got a lot of shit to go over so get comfy.”
Dean purposely doesn’t correct him. He’s openly bisexual, one of the only queer artists in Country music, but it’s not a huge deal. Making it a point to correct Ed could spark a number of conversations that Dean just isn’t really in the mood to have right now. So, instead, he thanks him for the compliment and just sort of nods along to the conversation the rest of the night, posing for a few pictures and signing a few autographs from fans before he and Sam head out.
“Wait, Cas, hang on a minute,” Dean says, grabbing Cas’ arm. “What’s the issue you’ve got with Benny?” he asks, annoyed by this whole situation now as he begins to put the pieces together.
Dean laughs again and leaves the studio. He checks his phone when he gets back to the Impala. Nothing but a few missed texts from Sam and the guys. He locks his phone, puts it in his pocket and drives home.
Dean spins them both around so now Cas is pressed up against the counter. He puts his hand under Cas’ ass and pulls him up so that Cas now has his legs straddled around Dean’s waist. They stand there like that making out before Dean walks them towards Cas’ bedroom.
“I’m really happy for you, Cas,” Jess says before closing her book and pulling the comforter up to her chest.
When Dean finally decides to leave again, he’s the last of Benny’s guests to do so. He looks down at the keys in his hand. He’s kinda drunk. He doesn’t live more than ten miles from Benny’s house, so there’s a chance he could make it back fine. But there’s also a chance he couldn’t.
“Well I’ll be damned,” Jody says as she comes down the large staircase in the center of the foyer, “the man my husband hasn’t been able to stop talking about for months! If I didn’t know any better, I’d be jealous!” Jody laughs, “How are you, Dean?”
“Fuck, Dean, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,” Cas moans, squeezing his eyes shut and wrinkling the sheets under his grip.
“You’ll love it,” Luke says as the gorgeous blonde woman next to him clears her throat and elbows him in his side. He shoots her a playful glare as he says, “hey, Dean, I don’t know if you’ve met yet, but this is my wife, Caroline.”
Cas is silent for what feels like forever. Dean has a lump in his throat. He shouldn’t have let Cas kiss him again. Cas was drunk, he didn’t know what he was doing.
“Billie,” Dean starts after a while. Sam looks up at him. “She wasn’t the one killing everyone. She said it was Chuck.”
“I, uh, you know what, lemme just run out and pick some up real quick. 10 minutes, tops,” Dean says as he starts to get up.
“I just wanted to make an announcement really fast, if that’s okay?” Cas starts. The entire table nods in unison, so he continues. “Some of you know this already, and I’m sure some of you, if not the rest of you, have your suspicions. I just wanted to go ahead and formally announce to everyone at this table tonight that…,” Cas takes a deep breath, “that Dean and I are dating.”
Dean removes Cas’ shirt and starts trailing kisses down his neck and torso. When he gets to the waistband of Cas’ boxers, he starts to tug on them with his teeth until Castiel stops him.
“Happy birthday, brother,” Benny wraps an arm around Dean’s shoulder. “28, huh? How’s it feel to be old?”
They chat for a moment before Dean gets up and heads into the kitchen to start cooking, leaving Sam, Jess, and Cas to talk about legal shit.
After everyone finishes their dinner and birthday cake, they all head home. Dean and Cas sit on the living room couch together watching a movie, Alma Grace asleep on Dean’s chest. Dean watches her back slowly rise and fall as she breathes, running his fingers through her hair.
Castiel chuckles, “just wanna make sure you’re okay first.” Dean can tell Cas is enjoying this just as much as he is as he inserts a second finger into Dean’s ass, grinning as Dean tenses back up.
“I’d like that,” Cas says, smiling at Dean. “I’d better get back inside; lunch break is over in a few minutes.”
They all laugh and continue a conversation as normal. Jess seems to really be enjoying herself, even in Dean’s company. In fact, her whole demeanor around Dean began to shift after Christmas. He knows it probably has something to do with her witnessing first-hand what John and Dean’s relationship is like, but as long as they’re getting along, it’s fine with him. He knows it’s important to Sam, so he's making an effort.
“I get caught up in my cases sometimes, please feel free to stop me whenever I go into too much detail,” Castiel says, as he gets up from the table, “I’m going to get the spaghetti.”
“Sam did most of the work. Bobby handled the guest list; Jody baked the cake. I just kind of supervised,” Cas trails off.
After a moment, Dean has a steady rhythm going of pulling out and slamming back into Cas and the look on Cas’ face is actually euphoric. He begins stroking Cas’ cock to the same rhythm and Cas’ moans, loud.
“Not everyone’s childhood is all sunshine and rainbows, Cas. It is what it is. It shaped me, in a way, into who I am. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving that bastard credit for making me who I am. But the shit I dealt with, I made myself who I am because of that shit.”
“Had our first official date last night,” Dean says looking down, unable to hide the smile spreading across his face, despite the pain it’s causing him.
“A movie buff, huh?” Dean says with a smirk on his face, “we’ll see about that. Where’s your collection?”
Cas gets up and holds his hand out for Dean again, almost deciding against it though to avoid a repeat of last time. But Dean grabs it and uses it to help himself up off the couch instead. He’s rocky on his feet, so Cas puts Dean’s arm around his shoulder and helps him up the stairs and into bed.
The next day, Dean tries to call Cas several times to talk, but Cas sends him to voicemail each time. He refuses to leave things how they left them, so he gets in his car and drives over to Cas’ apartment.
He hooks his arms under Cas’ armpits, resting his hands on each of Cas’ shoulders and his head on top of his right hand.
“Yes, my older brothers, Gabriel and Michael, my older sister Hannah, myself, and then my younger sisters, Ingrid and Adina,” Castiel lists, “Gabriel actually,” he laughs, “he practically begged her for all of her dessert recipes. He’s a pastry chef, runs his own bakery in Lebanon.”
He looks around and sees Cas, Jess, Charlie and Gilda, Bobby and Jody, Benny, Crowley, and Ash, as well as about 60 other people he’s acquainted with.
“You’re staying the night at his house, leaving clothes over there, he gave you a big fuckin’ kiss on the cheek when he got to the party, Dean, I-,”
They make their way into the family room and Dean flops down on the couch. He throws his head back and lays there with a drunken smile spread across his face.
Dean’s not usually one for surprises, but seeing the look on Cas’ face as he approaches him makes this one actually worth it.
Sam and Jess get up from the table and say goodbye to everyone. Benny decides that he’d better go too, and he calls a cab, claiming he doesn’t want to burden Dean with bringing him home. He knows it’s more so that he doesn’t have to leave Cas, which he sort of appreciates.
After their shower, Dean heads back to the kitchen to start on breakfast while Cas goes to wake up Alma Grace.
Dean drops to his knees and starts stroking Cas’ cock, thumbing over the slit and spreading precome along his shaft with every upstroke. Cas throws his head back and locks his arms behind him to keep himself up.
Dean’s silent for a moment. He knows better than to bring up Mary Winchester in front of his dad. Sam knows better, too. But that doesn’t make it okay for John to react the way he does.
“Well, I’m about to be a bigger pain in your ass so I won’t hold that against you,” Cas says with a shit-eating grin on his face.
As they’re finishing up their lunch, a tall, bearded man in his mid-fifties walks out from the kitchen towards their table. His salt and pepper hair is pulled back in a bun under a hair net and his black apron has flour hand-prints all over it. Dean introduces the man as Cain, and he introduces Cas to Cain as his friend, even though that still makes him uneasy. Cain slides into the booth and places his arm around Dean and they chat for a minute while Colette runs Dean’s card, giving him a huge discount, before they say their goodbyes.
Dean stares at him for a moment. Something’s obviously off, but he’s not gonna go into it right here. He turns the key in the ignition and the Impala roars to life. He stops at a CVS to pick up some condoms and then they drive back to Dean’s house.
“Basically, you’ve got ‘til the middle of this month to do whatcha want, then it’s down to business. I’m scheduling talk show interviews, radio interviews, oh and Blake has his annual benefit concert for Oklahoma that he’s doing in March and he specifically requested your performance. Blake, Luke, Thomas and his daddy, Carrie, Reba, Strait, Jr., they’ll all be there.”
“Why the hell not?” Dean asks, slightly annoyed. He still has very mixed feelings about this situation. On one hand, John is his dad. He’ll always have a soft spot for him. But, on the other hand, John and Dean didn’t necessarily get along when Dean was growing up. They still don’t. John never forgave Dean for ruining his image of having the two perfect sons. Dean has gotten to the point with John where nothing he does really even phases him anymore. He wasn’t surprised to hear John drove home drunk. He wasn’t surprised to hear John got into an accident. Nothing John Winchester does catches Dean off guard. He’s used to all this shit.
“Who’s the one with experience in this department, Cas?” Dean challenges back, “you may know where to aim to please a woman, but I know what I’m aiming for to please a man, too, and trust me, I’m hittin’ home-runs every damn time.”
They browse a bunch of different rings until Sam spots the perfect one. Dean offers to help him out by paying for it now until Sam can get the money together, but he says he’s got it covered. Apparently, he’s been saving for this for a long time. Dean’s impressed, but more than that, he’s proud of his baby brother who’s really not much of a baby anymore.
“Yes sir. I’m Dean, this is Sam,” Dean says in response. “Look, doc, we just wanna know what the hell’s going on.
Dean mimics Cas and bites his lip too before leaning over and pulling Cas into a long, slow kiss. He’s glad it’s dark out right now because Cas is actually kissing him back. And fuck did he miss the taste of him on his lips.
!” Storme presses an applause button and introduces the next song, clicking the ‘record’ button off.
“Maybe later,” Dean grumbles. “Y’all go ahead. Me and Cas are gonna explore the room for now,” he winks.
Cas doesn’t answer right away, so Dean gets up and walks into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
I did my best to make sure the meal they have in Mexico is authentic, but I'm not Mexican or even Hispanic so if I made any errors, please feel free to let me know so I can correct them!!
“Castiel?” John says, making a face, “where’d your folks come up with a sissy name like that?” he laughs.
“I, uh,” he thinks for a minute and then he remembers he almost called Cas. He stands up and walks over to the other side of the room, finding his phone underneath the desk chair.
Cas convinces Dean to get on a plane, despite Dean’s countless objections, insisting that a road trip would be way more fun even if it would take longer.
He stands to unbuckle his own pants as Dean leans over and retrieves the bottle of lube from his bedside drawer.
Sam has a point. Dean hasn’t let it go. He has no idea why he’s so hung up on this guy he just met. Something about him just caught Dean’s attention and he can’t seem to think about anything, any
“Meg,” Dean flashes her a smile, “I don’t know if you recognized me or not, but I’m Dean Winchester and I-“
“What can I say, Sammy? Your big brother’s movin’ on up in the world,” he says as he throws a sloppy smile Sam’s way.
After they finish eating, Sam cleans up letting Dean and Benny talk. Then, once they’re both gone, Dean heads back upstairs and gets right back in bed.
Dean smiles at the ground and then up at his brother before signaling to the bartender that he’ll have another drink.
“It was fun though,” Lee smiles at him, “just like old times, right down to you being first.” He winks.
Cas doesn’t respond right away, so he assumes he’s probably busy. He gets in the impala and heads over to Sam’s apartment.
Dean breaks away for a second to pull his shirt off over his head. Lee does the same and then they’re connected once again, stumbling their way over to the bed.
“Deal.” Dean gets up and walks to the other side of the table to unbuckle her. “Come on, miss thing. Let’s go get you cleaned up.” He picks her up, doing his best not to get syrup all over himself, and walks her down the hallway to the bathroom.
?” Dean shouts, completely caught off guard. “Why the fuck would you think that I’m sleeping with Benny?”
“I don’t know, man,” Dean says, tapping a pen against the notebook in his hands, “I just don’t wanna be another artist who does a medley, you know? I kinda just wanna do two or three songs one after the other.”
The party draws to a close around 11 pm. Dean and Cas are among the last to leave, only falling short of Sam, Jess, Bobby, and Jody. Sam assures Cas that they can handle the cleanup and that he should take Dean home.
“Okay, so, I took Cas to lunch with me, right? We went to Cain’s, talked a lot and whatever, the lunch went well. I bring him back to his office and lean in to kiss him goodbye and he turns away and rushes out of my car. No explanation, nothing. What does that-like, why would-” Dean trails off, looking at both of them, hoping they’ll get what he’s trying to ask.
“Where- son of a bitch,” Dean sighs as he closes his eyes and remembers leaving his car in the parking garage of the studio to make sure he wouldn’t drive home drunk. He groans as he pulls out his phone and dials the cab company again.
He fumbles with the buckle on his jeans, but Cas takes over and slides them off, leaving Dean in just his boxers.
“Yeah, well what if I’m tired of people counting on me,” Dean says as more of a statement than a question.
“We’re heading out today. Supposed to be this morning, but I’ll tell Bobby to give you a little more time.”
Dean whips around to see Cas standing there, the moon illuminating the perfect features of his face.
“Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!” Dean yells grabbing a fist full of sheets on either side of him.
Dean watches as Cas goes in for another bite, admiring every feature of the beautiful man sitting next to him.
“If you did it yesterday, then why am I just now noticing it?” Cas asks him, with seemingly no intentions of dropping the subject.
“I want this,” Dean says as he leans in to kiss him one more time before grabbing his hand and pulling him up the stairs.
Dean takes a long swig of Bud Light and he’s startled by Benny putting his hand on the small of his back.
“Fuck Sam, stop doing what he tells you to do,” Dean grumbles again, not taking his eyes off of the man next to him.
“So, Sam and Eileen and the kids will be here around three. Claire told me Kaia doesn’t get off work until five, so they won’t be here until after that,” Cas informs him.
“I’ll be off around 5. Maybe we can do something,” Cas says as he starts to walk out of the bathroom.
Sam sighs, but he doesn’t say anything else on the subject. They don’t say another word to each other the rest of the drive to Dean’s house. The radio is set to the Highway and the tail end of a throwback Tim McGraw song plays as Buzz Brainard comes back on the air.
“I know you are, and I know sometimes it may seem like Dean doesn’t get it, but believe me, he does. Our dad isn’t exactly the most accepting person, I mean you saw what happened on Christmas,” Sam says.
They move their hands down to each other’s jeans, unbuttoning them but refusing to let their mouths part.
“Hey, man. I asked myself the same damn question,” Dean laughs. “Now, come on. I’m going downstairs. Meet me down there in half an hour.”
He jolts out of the bed, starting to panic. Why were he and Benny in the same bed? Nothing happened, right? Benny’s straight. He wouldn’t have let anything happen…right?
Dean and Cas find Sam and Jess a few hours later at the after party. They’re leaning up against a back wall being nauseatingly cute.
The rest of the night goes great. They’re all laughing and telling stories. Dean is really enjoying himself and he can tell that Cas is too.
“Why are you here? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad you got here when you did, but…” he trails off.
“I’m sorry I didn’t call sooner. But, uh, we need to talk about what happened the other night,” Castiel responds.
“Hey,” Dean laughs, “Never said I was in any condition to drive, either. Lemme get you a cab,” Dean says, smiling at the cute little pout Castiel probably doesn’t even realize has adorned his face.
“Damn, he’s really tryna distract me, huh?” He says as she pushes him onto a couch in a private room and shuts the door.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says by way of greeting. His deep, gravelly voice hitting Dean in all the right spots.
“What? People applauding when Dean walks into a room? No, no that never stops being weird,” Sam laughs. “But, then again, I’m his brother. I know things about him that no one else knows which make it impossible for me to see him the way other people do.”
“Hm? Uh, everything, I guess,” Dean says. Cas glares at Dean and then returns to look at the menu. Dean notices the look Cas gives him and he forces himself to relax. There’s no point in being mad at Cas over something so trivial. “But, first time, you gotta go with Cain’s famous country fried steak,” Dean suggests. “It’ll make you wanna slap your momma.”
“This wouldn’t be a date with that fella you were hung up on the other morning in the studio, would it?” Bobby asks.
Dean steps out of the bathroom in what looks to be a pair of jeans and a t-shirt that haven’t been washed yet, after one or two wears.
“Just leave it alone, Sam. He’s said from the beginning that it had to stay between us. The fact that he told everybody last weekend was a huge step but he wasn’t even close to being ready for the world to know. And I fucked it up. I just had to take him on a date that wasn’t behind closed doors. This is my fault.”
They arrive at the Roadhouse for the party at a quarter past 5. They would’ve gotten there sooner if Dean hadn’t spent so much time in front of the bathroom mirror. Cas makes sure to remind Dean several times that
“Merry Christmas to you both,” Cas says, coming up behind Dean with two mugs in his hands. “Coffee?”
Lee doesn’t say anything. He just stares at Dean, who’s not sure if the emotion he’s looking back at is love, flattery, or regret. Maybe it’s all three.
Cas gets back to the house with his parents around 12:45. They both give Dean big hugs while commenting on how amazing it smells. The entire day is filled with love and laughter and damn good company. After they’re all filled up on the Thanksgiving feast, Dean brings out pie.
He closes his eyes and begins stroking himself. He pictures Cas again, sliding his hand up and down Dean’s shaft. He imagines how Cas’ mouth would feel, taking all of him in. He moans and feels his knees go weak, so he puts his other hand up against the shower wall in front of him to keep himself from falling. He strokes himself faster and harder until he comes. He opens his eyes, breathing heavily, and watches as the water washes away the mess. He finishes washing his hair and body and gets out of the shower. When he glances at the clock, it’s almost 8:30.
“Well, I sure hope you won, at least,” he says back seemingly unconvinced. “We’re gonna need to put you in a cast and you’ll need a few stitches. I’ll be right back.”
“It’s fine, I didn’t expect you to bring anything. I was thinking we could watch a movie, order pizza?” Castiel asks as he motions for Dean to move into the living room and onto the couch.
They walk up to the door and Cas knocks three times. A few seconds later, a small woman with silver hair wearing a flour dusted apron opens the door and her face lights up.
Dean doesn’t have a problem singing in front of people, obviously. I mean, hell, he’s made a career out of it. He just doesn’t feel up to it tonight, but he knows if he refuses, that’ll prompt Sam to play 20 questions with him on the ride home, and he’s not about to willingly subject himself to that. So, he rolls his eyes, flashes a playful smile, and walks over to the stage. He whispers to the DJ, then pulls out his phone and hands it to him and walks over to the mic.
Dean speaking doesn’t faze Castiel one bit because despite Deans objections, he presses kisses down Dean’s neck and he nips at Dean’s ear.
Charlie’s right. Dean had nothing to worry about after all. This went a lot better than he’d anticipated.
“Don’t worry, I have heat lamps,” Dean says as he points with his tongs to two large lamps on either side of the spacious deck.
After he walks back inside, Benny hands him a plate as he sits down on the couch. It smells great. Dean hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he had food in front of him. They eat mostly in silence, Benny and Sam taking turns watching him out of the corners of their eyes. He does his best to ignore them, but it’s uncomfortable and awkward as hell.
Dean groans and lifts himself up and pulls himself out of Castiel’s ass. Castiel whimpers a little, but then he gets up and walks to the bathroom, Dean follows.
Dean’s cab pulls up to his house around two in the afternoon. He thanks the driver and heads inside.
Dean’s slightly taken aback by the way Cas’ demeanor changed when she asked who he was. He’s not sure who he was going to introduce Cas to her as because he’s not sure what they are yet, but the way Cas cut in to say ‘friend’ has Dean slightly offended. He’s pretty sure they’re past the friendship stage by now.
She leans down and kisses him on the lips. He closes his eyes and kisses her back until he realizes what’s going on and he pulls away.
When he’s finished, he picks the two bowls up and moves to walk out of the kitchen, forcing Dean to give up his spot on his shoulder. As Cas moves out from behind the counter, Dean slaps his ass and follows him into the living room.
“Dean look at me. What the hell happened? We’ve been calling and texting you all morning. Didn’t you hear your phone going off?”
“You pick. I’m still finding my way around, remember?” Cas answers. Dean laughs, putting the car in drive. He knows exactly where he wants to go.
Castiel ruts his hips against Dean and Dean can already feel himself half hard in his pants. He puts his knee in between Cas’ legs and reaches his hand up to grab a handful of Cas’ hair. Castiel moans at the slight pull, so Dean pulls harder.
“I genuinely have no recollection of this conversation,” Cas says, sitting up in the bed, “why the hell would I turn down shower sex?”
Shit. Dean forgot about the huge ass bruise John gave him. He bets it looks even worse than it did yesterday afternoon.
“Alright so I’ll let Luke’s manager know. Next on the list is...shit, prepare yourself for this one, boy,” Bobby says.
Dean gets home and heads straight up to his room. He’s not in the mood to talk to anyone else, so he cuts off his phone and curls up in his bed for the rest of the day.
“Here, you want me to take it off?” Dean asks, grabbing the back of the collar and slipping the shirt over his head. He balls it up and tosses it across the floor. “It’s gone now. That make you happy?”
“Dean, I told you, you don’t have to cook tonight. It’s your birthday dinner. Eileen and I can handle it,” Cas says.
Dean glances towards the stage and Benny shoots him a huge grin and a thumbs up. He laughs and leans back in his chair.
Dean follows Sam up to a restaurant called Tazza. It just recently opened, so Dean’s never been to it before and he doesn’t really know what to expect. He’s just hoping it’s not another goddamn sushi bar. He cannot handle another monstrosity like the sushi burrito.
“I said nothing. I have some case notes to go over and then I have to head into my office for a bit. I really have to go,” Cas answers back.
“‘What do you mean?’ What do you mean what do I mean, what the hell do you think I mean?” Dean says to himself. Then he remembers Charlie suggesting Cas didn’t notice him leaning over to kiss him. Maybe he really doesn’t know what he means and maybe Dean shouldn’t even bother with it. But what if Cas is playing dumb. What if Cas knows exactly what Dean means and he’s just putting Dean through the ringer for the fucking hell of it.
Cas pulls away and gets out of the bed. Dean’s coming to realize Cas isn’t really the type for after sex cuddling and making out. He sighs and gets out of the bed, meeting Cas in the bathroom.
Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, smiling at him as he walks away and then turning his attention back to Sam.
Dean leans back and rubs his hand over his face. Castiel just watches him, completely at a loss for words. When Dean told him he would explain, he never imagined it would be this.
They arrive in Mexico at about midday local time. Dean’s more than thrilled to be on land again. As their shuttle makes its way to their hotel, Bobby lays out the game plan.
This is all very unfamiliar to Dean. He never knew there were real families out there who acted like this towards each other. He always just assumed it was one of those things movies embellish to make everything seem perfect.
Castiel laughs, much to Dean’s relief. Sam has always told him that his sense of humor is one people need to get used to. It never really mattered to him if people didn’t understand his jokes until he saw the look on Cas’ face after he cut him off.
“Yeah,” Dean clears his throat as well, “Bobby’s wife, Jody, made it. She’s amazing, it’ll be the best damn apple pie you’ve ever tasted.”
Lee watches him struggle while trying not to laugh at the deeply concentrated look Dean’s currently wearing.
“I don’t know. I’m not familiar with the area yet. Where is a good place to sit and talk?” Castiel asks.
“Are you kidding me?” Chuck turns to Dean. “I knew you guys were stupid, but I didn’t think you were that stupid. Did you really expect that to work?”
Cas smiles down at his feet and rubs his hand over the back of his neck before looking back up at Dean.
“When we all got back from Mexico, there were pictures of Dean and Cas on a date all over the media,” he says to Benny. “Did something happen with Cas?” He asks Dean’s back.
“Happy birthday,” Cas says back, kissing him again. “Come on, let’s get cleaned up before this dries.”
“Thanks, Sammy. Good to see you,” Dean says, pulling himself up off the floor. “Hey, Eileen. How are you?” He signs as he speaks.
“Mr. Winchester is in the intensive care unit, only relatives are allowed to see him at this time. Are you a relative?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m still with you, Bobby. I’m just processing all of this,” Dean says, unable to wipe the smile from his face.
“Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I vaguely remember that part, but, um…,” Dean searches for the right way to phrase this next question. When he doesn’t find anything better, he just comes right out and asks, “why were we sleeping in the same bed?”
Castiel looks at him, confused, but then relaxes his face because he’s way too drunk to think right now. He scoots over so Dean has enough room and manages to give his new address to the driver.
“Well, I know you’re not my ex-girlfriend. She had way rougher hands than you. And you can’t be Tim, he’s supposed to be working the counter. Plus, he couldn’t get his voice that high-pitched if he tried,” Charlie teases.
Dean doesn’t check his phone at all until he gets back to his house. He has the usual missed calls and texts from the band about the album, a missed call and text from Bobby, etc. But what’s unusual are the four missed calls from Sam and the seven unread texts. Normally Sam doesn’t bother with calling more than twice and he definitely wouldn’t send that many texts unless something was wrong.
“Sometimes while you were busy, like showering or something, I’d make a few calls. I spoke with a manager when we were checking in to kind of get the ball rolling and we worked out all of the details as the week went by,” Dean explains.
They spend hours talking things through. They laugh, they cry, Cas even jokingly punches Dean in his good arm before they both start cracking up.
Cas chuckles at him, “how did you sleep?” He asks as he turns to search the fridge for something to have for breakfast.
He slides his hand up and down his shaft, eyes closed, left arm and forehead pressed up against the shower wall. He tries not to, but he thinks of Cas. He thinks of all the times they had shower sex. All the times Dean was on his knees, taking Cas in his mouth while hot water rolled down their spines. All the times he and Cas stroked each other while making out under the stream of water. And then he starts to cry.
“You’re a baby,” Cas says back at him. Dean smirks. He’s digging the little jabs Cas is throwing at him, so he makes it a point to complain some more.
Dean smiles. He missed it too, but there’s a lump forming at the back of his throat that’s preventing him from saying it back.
“I really do have to go, though. Work,” Cas says, unenthusiastically. “I’ll see you tonight, though?”
Cas slides his hand up and down Dean’s shaft, thumbing over his slit every so often sending waves of electricity through Dean’s entire body.
“This is beautiful, Dean. I can’t believe you set all of this up. I was with you the whole time, when did you have time to do all of this?”
“I don’t know, man. Something’s goin’ on with Cas,” Dean takes another sip of his beer. “He was all cagey last night leaving the party and he didn’t say a word the entire ride back to my house. Then, the weirdest part, he went
The party gathers around Sam at a table in the center of the room and Cas walks with Dean to the front of the crowd. They all sing “Happy Birthday” to Dean as he playfully rolls his eyes and pretends to hate it.
They sit on the couch the rest of the night, watching episode after episode, thighs pressed against each other and Dean’s arm wrapped around Cas’ shoulders until they finally fall asleep.
“Well, I’m in your corner. And I’ll be over here keeping an eye on y’all. If you need me to jump in and rescue you, just give me the bat signal,” Charlie says, making a weird twitchy thing with her eye. She knows she can’t wink, but that doesn’t stop her from trying.
“Oh, ohhh. Oh, hell yeah, let’s go,” Cas says, grabbing Dean’s hand and pulling him towards one of the cars hired to drive them back to the hotel.
Sam, on the other hand, isn’t. Dean always shielded Sam from the worst of their father. Sure, Sam knew John would get drunk a lot and that he’d get angry, but some of the shit John did, let’s just say Sam wouldn’t be outside his hospital room worried sick if he knew.
“Son of a bitch,” he mumbles to himself, closing his eyes and leaning his head back. And of course, Sam hears him and starts to pry.
Dean blushes. He knows how amazing it felt, but hearing Cas say that it really was makes everything better. He kisses him again.
Dean has never been this nervous in his entire life. The feeling is a mixture of excitement as well as an obscene amount of fear.
Dean smiles as he stands in the doorway awkwardly, looking everywhere but Cas’ face when it dawns on Cas,
He considers spreading out on the living room couch to watch some reruns of his favorite medical drama, but he decides against it. He has to be up relatively early tomorrow for the interview on the Highway, so he cuts the lights off and heads upstairs to sleep.
Dean throws the pillow Cas threw back at him and they both start laughing. Cas dials the pizza place and orders two pizzas, one Hawaiian, and one with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. He teases Dean for liking everything but the kitchen sink on his pizza.
He goes downstairs and opens his empty fridge in search for something to curve his hangover. All he finds, though, are two six packs of Bud Light, a jar of jelly, and a single slice of Kraft singles. Great. He needs to go grocery shopping. He sighs and shuts the fridge, grabs his keys and opens the front door.
He wracks his brain trying to piece everything together, but the last thing he remembers clearly was whooping Crowley’s ass on their 5
Dean tries to enjoy the sushi burrito Sam insists on ordering for him, but it’s just too weird. Sushi and burritos should never be combined, and he tells Sam as much.
Dean gets back to his hotel room and immediately heads for the mini bottles. He makes himself a drink and sits down on his bed, closing his eyes as he downs it in one gulp.
Dean heads upstairs and hops in the shower. He took one this morning, but he wants to be fresh for his date. When he’s done, he takes way too long trying to find something to wear. Dean can’t even remember the last time he went on a real date. What the fuck do you wear on a date? He abandons his closet for a moment, at a loss, to fix his hair. He dries it and then spikes up the front with just enough moose to make it stand, but not so much that he would end up looking like a ken doll. He walks back over to his closet and sighs. This should not be as hard as he’s making it out to be. He pulls a black button down off its hanger and stares at it. This would look nice with some dark jeans and his favorite boots. But what if Cas is dressed more casually. He’s gonna look like a dumbass if he shows up all dressed up and Cas is in a t-shirt and sweats or some shit. He opts for a white t-shirt, black blazer, and some light wash jeans.
“I just got off the phone with my parents. They’re really excited to see me and to meet ‘my friend’. We’re having dinner at their house at 5,” Cas says, putting air quotes around “my friend”.
“Because I didn’t wanna play twenty questions about it, goddamn!” Dean raises his voice. He doesn’t mean to; his dad is just a sensitive topic. He closes his eyes and rubs his hand over his face, “I’m sorry. I just, it’s not that big of a deal, Cas. It’s just a bruise.”
“I was just about to tell Cas about that time when you were 14 and I walked in on you when you were d-,”
“Yeah, well, uh, turns out he was just kinda freaked. Said he’d never been with a guy before and he had to try and wrap his head around it first.”
“I’m really not in the mood for a lecture,” Dean rolls his eyes and walks into the kitchen to open up a beer.
Dean packs everything up and heads downstairs to the front desk. He asks to speak to a manager so he can explain what happened and arrange payment for the damages. The manager agrees to send him a bill and assures Dean that mistakes happen, that he gets it.
“How do you explain the pictures?” Another reporter shouts above the rest, who've started back up again. Dean turns to look at them again as Bobby shoves him into the car.
Cas takes a move out of Dean’s playbook and after slamming into his ass a few more times, he veers to the side on the final thrust and hits Dean’s prostate, sending white, hot pleasure through Dean’s entire body.
“Dean,” Castiel starts as Dean opens his eyes and stares at the ceiling, making an ‘o’ shape with his mouth and breathing heavily.
Dean finishes cooking about an hour and a half later and they all sit down at his kitchen table to have breakfast, which consists of pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon, and toast.
Dean can feel Sam burning a hole in his face. He’s never been good at taking no for an answer when it comes to shit Dean’s dealing with. It’s been somewhat of a comfort for Dean, because if Sam didn’t make him talk about his shit, he wouldn’t, and he would’ve exploded a long time ago.
It’s 7:02 am and Dean is sitting on the front porch of the home he shares with Cas. He watches as the sun slowly rises from over the horizon. This is his daily routine. He never used to be a morning person, but after losing Cas and then getting him back again all those years ago, he decided life was too short not to watch the sunrise.
“What? No, yeah, yeah, everything’s fine, Cas,” Dean says, now looking at him. “I actually, uh, I have some news.”
“I trust your judgement,” he says. He kisses Dean’s cheek and heads for the door. “I’ll be back soon!”
“Hey, Cas, I just wanted to say I’m really happy for you and really proud of what you did tonight. From what Dean’s told me, I know it must’ve been really hard for you to tell everyone that. And I know it meant a lot to Dean, too.”
Dean laughs too and says, “look man, I’m not usually one to judge, but pineapple on pizza? I mean that’s just not right! That’s, like, devil shit. An abomination. A disgrace to all pizza connoisseurs ever, it’s-,”
“Hey, look, I really do have more control than I did when I was 17. You just…I don’t know, it’s probably because I was shit faced,” Dean says in his defense.
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean shakes his head and picks up his utensils to actually eat his food. “It was a long time ago. All the really bad shit, I mean. Shit like this,” he points to his jaw, “I don’t let it bother me because I don’t really care what he thinks anymore, you know? I used to live my life trying to be just like him. Trying to impress him, to make him proud of me. But as long as I’m me, he’ll never be proud of me. I figured that out a long time ago, and I’m okay with it now.”
He leans forward and begins kissing Cas again, taking in the taste of his mouth. Dean can taste the apple pie still and that makes this so much sweeter.
Dean gets back in his car and throws his head back on the seat, closing his eyes. He takes several deep breaths before he pulls himself together enough to drive back home.
“Just errands, Dean. You wouldn’t have any fun. I’ll call you when I finish,” Cas says as he hangs up.
Dean offers Cas a fake smile and a nod. He’s so not giving Sam Cas’ number so that they can end up all buddy-buddy. Absolutely not.
“Here, lemme do it,” Cas says, noticing Dean’s trouble with the machine. “You pop the pod in, push the lever down, click start and it brews it for you.”
He straightens back up and walks towards the giant whiskey barrel of beer on ice as the band starts strumming some instrumentals, obviously trying to stall.
“I have to say,” Cas starts, prompting Dean to look over at him. “I’ve never been on a date that even comes close to this.”
Caroline jokingly swoons and the three of them talk for a bit longer while other guests wish Dean a happy birthday in passing.
Sam does his best to give Dean his space, but with the state of the world right now, it’s proving rather difficult. Jack has been looking for a way to save Cas. He got Cas out before, he can do it again.
“Nah, nah I didn’t sleep in it last night, apparently,” Dean laughs. “He’s gonna look for it and get it back to me when he finds it,” he shrugs.
“So, uh-,” Dean hesitates, trying to find the right thing to say. He settles on, “why’d you wanna meet so urgently?”
“S’nothing. I tripped yesterday and busted my face on the banister of the stairs in my house,” Dean lies.
“Just makin’ sure you get home okay. What kinda date would I be if I let you get inna cab by yourself?” Dean replies.
He gets up and walks out onto his back porch, shutting the door behind him. He pulls out his phone and dials Cas’ number. He’s almost certain Cas won’t answer, but that doesn’t stop him from calling.
“Can you move your right knee a little more to the right, you’re, like, kneeing me right in the ass,” Dean complains, not actually bothered by the placement of Cas’ knee.
“Not here. Why don’t we go back to my apartment? I’ll cook something, we’ll have a real date,” Castiel suggests.
“Dean, I can’t let you pay m’tab, I had a lot of drinks and dinner,” Castiel recants, emphasizing the word ‘and’.
“Alright now that the congratulations are over, we’re looking at doing a few benefit concerts and award shows before the big tour starts in August. Bart thinks that keeping people in suspense for 8 months ain’t gonna bode well for sales,” Bobby says.
“What can I say, Sammy?” He winks as Cas walks out of the bathroom and whacks his chest with the back of his hand. “Ow, hey!”
didn’t do anything, Sam. I left my number on his kitchen counter, but I guess he just wasn’t into me.”
Dean sees himself in the mirror for the first time since he left Sam’s. He looks like hell. The left side of his jaw is already black and blue. Shit. How is he supposed to explain this to Cas? He’s not really ready to delve into his fucked-up home life on the second date.
“It’s fine. I, uh, I like talking about her. I could never really do that when I was a kid because my dad never wanted to. She was the love of his life, ya know? So, when she passed, he kind of just…fell apart.”
He sits in his car for a moment, running a hand over his face. Then he pulls his phone out of his pocket and checks his notifications. He sees a few missed texts from Cas. Shit, he told Cas he’d text him back later.
“Alright everybody, this is a new song I wrote recently…very recently, actually. It’s not on the album, but, uh, it’s something that’s been on my mind lately, so I decided to just say ‘fuck it’ and perform it for y’all,” Dean says to the crowd. “I hope y’all like it.”
“I ‘ppreciate what my buddy over there’s tryna do, but really, ‘m okay. Actually, just gettin’ outta a relationship so…” Dean trails off. He’s having a hard time processing the rest of what he wants to say when he realizes she’s swung her leg over his lap, straddling him.
He walks in the house and sets his keys in the dish. Making his way into the living room, something on the kitchen table catches his eye.
Dean doesn’t move, still doesn’t say a word. He hears his hotel room door shut a few seconds later and his head falls onto his arm resting on the balcony.
“It’ll be fine, I promise,” Castiel comes up from behind to wrap his arms around Dean’s shoulders. Dean looks at him and smiles.
“Merry Christmas, Dean. Sam texted to say he and Jess are on their way,” Cas says, his back still to Dean while he pours coffee into two mugs.
Cas reluctantly pulls himself away from Dean, leaving him panting up against the door. This time, Cas goes to retrieve a condom from the drawer. Dean grins and pushes off the door. He pulls his shirt off over his head and practically jumps on top of Cas, both of them falling onto the bed. Dean presses his lips to Cas’ again, letting Cas slide his tongue into his mouth and returning the favor.
“Alright, alright, enough,” Dean says as he pulls his hands from her eyes. She turns around and flings her arms over his shoulders in a hug.
“I would love some, thank you,” Cas responds, walking over to kiss Dean good morning. “Happy birthday,” he says.
“Nice save,” Dean smirks. “Go pick up your parents, I got this. Sam and Jess will be here soon anyway so if you really don’t trust my judgement, there will be two far more responsible people here shortly.”
“Maybe because he knew he’d have to leave you if he did. And I think he was worried about losing you because part of him never thought you would ever love him back,” Jack responds.
He takes a few steps backwards as Cas follows, neither of them making any effort to come up for air.
“So, first order of business, Luke is doing his Sunset tour and Morgan Wallen had to cancel his appearances for the shows in Cancun. Would you wanna take that spot? Those shows are, uh,” Bobby hesitates as he checks his computer. “June 9
Dean sets the pie and plates down and takes a seat, giving Cas the floor. He clears his throat before he begins.
“So, I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Dean starts, “Christmas…you, uh, you staying here or going back home?”
Dean looks him up and down for a moment. His hair is longer than he remembers and he’s bulked up a little more since the last time they’d seen each other, almost ten years ago. But he looks good. Damn, does he look good.
Dean’s woken up by the sound of someone banging on his hotel room door. He rolls over and he’s immediately met with the sensation of nausea.
“How long have you and Castiel Novak been together?” The reporter asks again, shoving a microphone in Dean’s face.
Dean sighs and looks down at his beer. He understands. How can he not? Not everyone can just come out freely. Hell, if John hadn’t caught him when he was fifteen, he probably never would’ve come out to him. And he knows Cas struggles with this whole thing.
Dean stands there with his arms crossed awkwardly across his chest as Benny sits up in the bed and stretches.
Dean’s stomach flips. He hadn’t pegged Cas for the kinda guy who listens to country music. He would’ve guessed classical, jazz maybe.
Dean nods; he’s good with that. He’s been itching to get back on stage and play some of these new songs for everybody.
He tears one off the ribbon and rips open the package, but when he turns around to get back on the bed, Cas’ eyes are closed and he’s quietly snoring. He smiles, though, slightly disappointed.
The waiter comes back a few minutes later with two plates in hand. The meal looks to be a steak dish that the waiter refers to as carne asada. It’s paired with rice, beans, and tortillas. For dessert they have churros. Dean asked for chocolate sauce and ice cream because, even though it’s not traditional to eat them with ice cream in Mexico, that’s the way he’s always had them.
“Alright, alright,” Dean says, “here, you pick something.” He hands the remote to Cas, forcing him to look away from Dean to choose something from the channel guide.
kissed me and pulled me into your apartment. I tried to stop you cause we were both drunk as shit and not thinking, but, uh, you didn’t care, and you pulled me back in. We made out for a little and managed to make it to your bedroom. You told me to get condoms out of your drawer, but when I turned back around, you were passed out on your bed, so, uh, I left.”
“It’s okay, Cas. Next time just come right out and talk to me about it. I would never do anything to hurt you like that,” Dean says, looking Cas in the eye and rubbing a thumb over his cheek.
“Stop touching it, you’re going to mess it up,” Cas says, moving Dean’s hands out of the way so he can adjust it again.
Dean sets the pie and wine down on the counter as he sits. This is so awkward. The first night they met was less awkward than this, even when Dean had to struggle to keep the conversation going due to Cas’ presumed disinterest.
“I just-he wasn’t supposed to be here and then he called me-,” Dean stops for a second. “I shouldn’t have gone off on him, I-I just, I lost it.”
Dean glares at Benny and he smiles back, taking a sip of his beer. He rubs his hands over his face and groans before finally agreeing.
“I’m just…Cas said it would be a while before the empty would come and take him. I wasn’t expecting it to happen so soon,” Jack lowers his head.
“I said nothing, Dean,” Cas shoots a quick, but stern look at Dean before getting out of the Impala and walking inside.
“Gee, thanks, Sammy,” Dean responds, waving Sam’s hand away as he drags himself out of the bed and walks towards the bathroom.
“Uh, yeah, I think so,” Dean says. He holds his breath, he’s not gonna beat around the bush. “Benny, what, uh, what happened last night?”
Dean laughs as he comes up behind Cas, wrapping his arms around his waist and laying his chin on Cas’ shoulder. They stand there like that while Cas puts the two bowls of ice cream together.
Dean looks at them, not really buying either of those excuses, but he appreciates the fact that they’re trying to make him feel better.
“Always a little bitch,” John laughs as he swings at Dean again. This time, Dean’s expecting it and he dodges John’s fist.
They stand there for a moment, making out under the hot stream until Cas reaches down and wraps his hand around Dean’s half hard cock and begins to stroke him.
“Hey, why don’ you just stay here t’night, brother?” Benny slurs, still coherent enough to notice Dean struggling with this decision.
“Alright, well, regardless, you need to eat something. Come on,” Sam says, pulling Dean up and out of the bed.
“Yep,” Cas says, refusing to look at Dean as he shrugs out from under his arm. He gets up from the bar and walks towards the door.
Dean closes his eyes and throws his head back, “I, uh…fuck. Okay,” he gives in. She gets up and holds her hand out, waiting for him to take it so she can lead him into a back room.
“I’m meeting a guy here. Took him home the other night and we made out, but I hadn’t heard from him until about half an hour ago when he called and asked me to meet him here,” Dean says.
“It’s fine, Dean. I get it. I wouldn’t want to force you to risk something like that,” Cas says, looking Dean in the eye.
Cas smiles, relieved that Dean isn’t going to make fun of him and glad he actually shares this guilty pleasure with him.
Lee throws a quick acknowledging smile at Benny and then cocks his head at Dean in confusion before saying,
“No worries,” Dean laughs, “I’m just picking. I mean, I’d rather not talk about Jeffrey Dahmer’s psycho cousin during dinner, but I’m just messing with you.”
He sits down with his song book and immediately starts writing down the lyrics he’s been playing around with in his head,
“If we’re just going back to the hotel, I think I’d rather stay and watch the show again. If that’s okay…,” Cas trails off.
“Shit,” he says, looking down at it. He wiggles his fingers and he’s met with a searing pain that shoots through his wrist. “Fuck!”
Castiel huffs and surrenders, allowing Dean to walk with him out to his car. He stumbles a bit, but Dean steadies him.
“Maybe next time,” Lee winks. He strokes himself a few more times until he comes between their chests.
A combined look of shock and excitement quickly replaces the annoyed look previously occupying Cas’ face.
“I’m not asking you again. Get the fuck out before I call the goddamn cops, dad!” Dean yells at him.
“Oh, your buddy’s place, huh?” Cas says, playfully rolling his eyes at yet another one of Dean’s many Nashville connections.
Dean buries his head in his hands and groans. All the shit about his father must’ve been too much. He knew it was too soon to go into all this crap, he should’ve listened to his gut and kept it to himself.
The bar joins him in singing the third chorus this time. He’s jumping all over the stage and putting his whole heart into this performance. This random performance on this 3-inch-thick stage in the middle of a fucking sushi bar, of all places.
Dean wakes up around 8:15. He’s got a kink in his neck that aches as he sits up straight. It takes him a moment to realize where he is. When his eyes adjust, he realizes he’s in Cas’ apartment, on the couch in the living room. Did he sleep here last night? Of course he did. How else could this be explained? But where’s Cas?
They spend the next few hours rehearsing their set list for tonight and it feels great. Performing on award shows and talk shows is fun, but nothing beats stadium shows.
“We’ve run it six times just today, brother. I don’t think we could be any more prepared if we tried,” he says.
“I knew you’d eventually replace me for Benny. Is it because I won’t sleep with you?” Charlie jokes.
“Yes, yes, of course I’ll help you pick!” Cas says. He sits back in his booth, taking in the news. “I’m really proud of you, Dean.”
Benny sighs and walks over to Dean, snatching the beer out of his hand and pouring it down the sink.
Dean steps back a few feet, holding his face and he locks eyes with John. He’s grinning, the piece of shit. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think John actually enjoys this. And who knows, maybe he does. But Dean knows John’s drunk. He always is. He’ll regret this when he sobers up, if he remembers it when he sobers up.
“Hey, Storme, it’s good to be back. I’ve been good, man. You know, just working on the album. Putting the finishing touches on and getting her ready for the release,” Dean says.
Dean hugs Bobby and kisses Jody on the cheek as he leaves to head back into the city. Now all he's gotta do is kill time.
“Yeah, well, I’m gonna head out. Got some things to do before my date tonight,” he winks at Charlie.
“That’s not what I meant,” Castiel defends. He shakes his head and tries again, “I just meant I want to explore…,” Castiel trails off, searching for the right word, “the connection we had the other night.”
Cas slides into the now empty booth and Dean slides in next to him. Cas moves a little closer to the wall as Dean moves in and as much as it bothers Dean that Cas won’t let him touch him, he understands.
“Uh, no. No, you’re not wrong,” Dean says, “I do that sometimes. Shit happens and then…,” Dean trails off. He doesn’t even know if Cas liked it. “I write,” Dean finishes.
“We should really go, but Cas, maybe Sam can call you some time for advice?” Jess asks. Sam nudges her and she mouths ‘what’ to him.
He gets out of the shower and tries to dry himself off and get dressed with one hand. It’s nearly 2:30 in the morning, but he calls a cab to take him to the hospital.
Before he realizes it, the sun has gone down and the night has crept in. He’s already way too many drinks in to count, which is why he doesn’t care how much of a bad idea the decision he’s just made is going to end up being.
“This one’s different,” Dean cuts him off. “This one’s not like the others. He-,” Dean’s eyes start to water. “Cas is different, Ben.”
Dean feels a knot form in the pit of his stomach. This could either be really good or really bad, he thinks, as he recalls the look on Cas’ face that night when he joked about being his date.
Dean smiles at her as Cas instinctively grabs his wrist and starts running his thumb over his tattoo.
“Hell yeah I was surprised,” Dean laughs. “Thank you for this, both of you.” He pulls them both into a hug and he feels Cas immediately tense up, but then quickly relax into the embrace.
They make their way to the end of the carpet and then they’re escorted to their seats. Cas is sitting with Sam and Jess, Bobby and Jody, Ash’s wife, and a woman Benny met a few weeks ago that he practically begged Bobby to get a ticket for. Angela is her name…or maybe Andrea. Something like that.
When they walk in, the bar erupts in cheers and congratulations. Dean makes his rounds and greets everyone while Cas hangs back with Sam and Jess.
“He wasn’t ready to-,” he’s having a really hard time concentrating on the conversation, partly because of the alcohol and partly because his dick is straining against his jeans. “To, uh, he wasn’t ready to come out,” Dean manages to say.
The next month is rocky. Dean has unintentionally fallen into a routine with Sam who comes over once a day to make sure he’s still alive and that he’s eaten something, which usually, he hasn’t. He manages to pull himself together enough to make sure his band is able to rehearse the way they need to, but that’s about all the energy he has to give.
“Bobby’s handling all that. Got an interview with Storme Warren tomorrow, then one with Ty, Kelly, and Chuck on Tuesday.”
Dean hates to admit this to himself, but he’s kind of jealous. He never had experiences like that with his dad.
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Cas responds, “I-, I don’t know how to say this, so I’m just gonna say it. I’m not gay.”
“Well, right now, it’s like 85% hard, but once I get my pants off and that condom on, we’ll be at full power,” Dean jokes.
Dean laughs and then he pulls out his phone. It’s three o’clock. That means there’s only two hours until the red carpet, four hours until the award show starts, and about five and a half hours until they go on stage. Dean takes another deep breath.
“No,” Dean hesitates, then takes a deep breath.” He didn’t know…he didn’t know that I’m in love with him, Sam. He didn’t…”
“Dad, I don’t want a lecture from you about how I’m going against God and how I’m going to burn in hell for my choices. This is who I am and I-,”
The waitress comes back five minutes later and sets a large plate down in front of him. A burger the size of Dean’s head sits in the center of the plate, accompanied by two strips of bacon, two sausage links, a pile of hash browns and an egg. Holy shit this is a lot of food, but Dean’s starving and he knows the burger will make his headache go away, so he digs in.
Dean smiles. Castiel looks so unbelievably proud of himself that Dean even feels proud of him. Dean barely knows the guy, but he’s proud of his accomplishment.
Camera lights are flashing from every direction. He’s been to award shows before, but he doesn’t remember them ever being this intense. People are shouting his name to get him to look their way and he does his best to make sure he catches everyone at least once.
Dean pulls up at about a quarter to one to Cas sitting outside on a bench. Cas looks up and raises his eyebrows at the Impala. It occurs to Dean that he’s never actually shown Cas his baby before.
Dean’s a little irritated by the fake persona Cas keeps putting on, but he knows the quicker he can get Cas out of that bar and into bed, the better off they’re both gonna be.
Dean frees his arm from Sam’s grasp and gets in one last punch before Sam grabs his entire body and pulls him up off the ground.
“Dude, why wouldn’t you let me drive? You know I can’t stand this thing. Too many damn buttons,” Dean complains as he presses a random button that makes the sun roof open up and let in the drizzle from outside.
“When was the last time you reached out to him? Maybe now that he’s had some time to sit with it, he’ll be more open to talking,” Sam suggests.
“Neither had I,” Cas says back. “We’ll take it as slow as you want. I’ll go easy on you,” he says with a wink.
He gets up, stretching his entire body and cracking his neck to help with the dull ache. He walks over to Cas’ door and he hears the shower running. He opens the door and sees that the bed looks the same as it did when they left it earlier that night, so Cas must’ve slept on the couch with him.
“I mean, it’s been, what? 6 months? 7? I know coming out takes time and I don’t want to pressure you, it’s just…if you’re not ready to do this, then, I don’t know, maybe it’s better if we don’t.”
