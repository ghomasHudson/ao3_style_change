Levi sing-songed as he did every morning. Dean dropped his head back onto his pillow while Cas giggled above him.
"People would notice a massive animatronic bunny wandering around now." Cas answered. Dean nodded in understanding but observed the Golden Bonnie's feet and the area around them. He leant down and swiped his index finger through the displaced dust.
"Yeah, me too." Cas returned, his voice was slightly strained and he seemed to say it through gritted teeth but, again, Dean didn't notice. Dean pulled into the garage and jumped out before rushing into the house to meet Levi.
"I can't believe he pushed Levi off the climbing frame." Cas grumbled angrily when they were all sat in their seats. Dean reached over and placed his hand on the back of Cas' neck, rubbing his thumb across Cas' hairline.
"Eli, he... he's gone too!" Cas cried. Dean rushed forward to gather Cas into his arms. Charlie gasped and rested her head in her hands.
"I like it." Cas' foot was on the first step when he heard Gabriel click, he turned suspiciously after checking himself, worried about what the archangel had done but he was leaning back into couch with Cas' discarded coke in once hand and a bowl on M & M's in the other. He scowled at his brother but quickly shrugged it off when he remembered that the chocolate hadn't been there before.
"Yeah, that's right. 'The Head Alpha is not obligated to bare his neck to anyone but their mate, this is to show that the Head Alpha respects their mate and that the pack should follow suit.' Dean read before adding, "Again, should we mate, the pack would be expected to bare their necks to you as they do to me."
"Dean?" Said a quiet voice from the door. Dean turned slowly to face Sam. "Mom, Dad and Bobby have set up rooms in the bunker. I think we won't see then until the morning now." Dean nodded slowly and stepped away from Levi's cot. He shut the door quietly. "We're going Christmas shopping tomorrow if you're coming."
"Ok," Dean and Cas looked up as the doctor returned to their room. Cas sat up straight and took Dean's hand nervously.
"The men who are missing left with the people they killed and they weren't mine." He explained. The Winchester's shared a look as Cas nodded. "I have photos of the people who do work for me, you're welcome to those."
"Why does your dad have an operating table in the basement?" Dan asked. He leant back into Phil's chest slightly and turned to Cas.
"Yes, you showed no emotional reaction." Gabriel said. "We can summon it tonight, Sam, Cas and I will stay invisible so we can smite it while it's weak." They nodded then went their separate ways. Cas curled up on the couch with her book, Sam went into the bunker to see if he could find a cure for Cas and Gabriel zapped off... somewhere. Dean went into the kitchen to make Sam and Cas a coffee, he put Cas' on the table in front of her then went into the bunker and put Sam's in front of him.
"Tease." Cas giggled and wandered back into the living room to join Levi. Dean watched the angel walk away with a fond smile then turned back to the sink.
"He shouldn't be having dreams about you getting hurt if he misses you, he should be dreaming about us together, you and him, he's worried about you." Cas moved to the porch seat and sat down, his body facing the door.
"Dean?" Sam asked softly. Dean collapsed in one of the chairs and sobbed. Sam hurried around the table, it always broke his heart to see his brother like this. "What happened?!"
"Wapples?" Levi asked quietly. Dean chuckled and carried Levi to the table where the boy's waffles were sat. Cas stood at the counter watching Levi eat as Dean joined him and wrapped his arms around the angel's waist.
"I love it, thank you, Dean." Cas murmured. They stared into each other's eyes for a moment then Cas moved forward again, pressing their lips together gently. The kiss was quick but when Cas pulled back Dean had a loving smile on his face. Dean wrapped his free arm around Cas' waist, pulling him flush against his body, and pressed another kiss to Cas' full lips. Cas sighed contently and leant into Dean, the hunter tightened his arm then opened his mouth slightly, encouraging Cas into a deeper kiss. The angel copied Dean's movements and tangled one of his hands in Dean's short hair. Their mouths moved together in a soft and loving kiss until they heard Levi muttering to himself.
"When do you want me to bring him back?" Sam asked, standing with Levi in one arm and his bag in the other.
"Cas, do something." Dean chocked. Cas looked over at Dean. Hayden had him pinned against the wall, one hand holding his neck and the other held the knife to his stomach slowly pressing in. Cas picked up Sam's knife and rammed the knife into the siren's back. The siren's true form flickered briefly into view then he collapsed next to Sam. The younger Winchester took a deep breath and sat up. He looked to Hayden who was looking at his hands forlornly. Hayden turned angrily and adjusted his grip on the knife before storming forward and driving the knife into the dead siren's chest over and over.
"Unca..." Movement behind the angel distracted the toddler. "Daddy!" Levi shouted happily. Dean smiled softly and came forward to lift Levi into his arms.
"I'm Agent McKagan, this is Agent Rose and Fortus. We're here surveying the neighbourhood and we'd like to ask you some questions." Dean said.
"It's not safe for me to do anything, Gabriel. I'm an omega, and I wish, I wish I was an alpha or a beta but I'm not, Fenrir wanted me to be an omega for a reason. And you know I would be the last person to submit or bare my neck to an alpha or whatever omegas are meant to do." Castiel objected angrily. Gabriel stared at him shocked, not expecting the outburst from his brother but a small smile graced his face as Castiel disappeared into the castle. Castiel hurried up to his room and put the kingdom maps into his satchel.
"There's no mention of the disappearances despite there being 6 of them. However, there is word on the springlock failure." Charlie explained lowly. She took a bite of her pain au chocolat as the others took in her words.
"Oh no, that would be fine. The kid's section is in full view of the reception desk." Maria answered with a smile. "What does your wife do?"
"I love you." Cas confessed. Dean's heart swelled and a grin split on his face; he could see the raw adoration and devotion in Cas eyes. Dean leant forward and rested their foreheads together.
"A week and a half ago." Cas replied. The doctor hummed and a deep furrow appeared between his brows, he made a quick note then turned to the screen.
"You don't need to come with me if it makes you feel uncomfortable, Dean." Cas mumbled as they made their way to the lingerie section. The store was busy and loud so Dean had to strain to hear what she'd said. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas' arm again, mentally convincing himself that the act was purely platonic. It's still Cas.
"I'll be back to check your vitals and do your exercises later." Castiel murmured. Dean moved his hand again, squeezing Castiel's hand weakly before dropping it limply against the bed. Jessica hopped around the bed to loop her arm through Castiel's before leading him out of Dean's room.
"Really?" Cas nodded. "So you're always... ready to go, huh?" Dean smirked seductively, letting his hands massage the angel's ass gently.
"Come in, Sam." Cas said once he had answered the door. Sam greeted Cas with a hug then stepped over the threshold of the room. Immediately, Levi ran to the tall man and buried his face in Sam's legs. "How is Dean?" Cas asked as Sam sat with Levi and he began to pack Levi's clothes.
"I wasn't all that nice to Chris. He loved the animatronics on the show-stage but he hated the Golden ones. I was a nasty son of a bitch to my brother about Freddy's, I used to scare him at home, you know, wear a Foxy mask and jump out at him." Michael started, his voice was surprisingly strong but still wavering. Dan reached over to Cas to take his hand, they never got a chance to have any kind of sibling relationship with their brothers, nevermind sibling rivalry. "It was his birthday, at Freddy's, and me and my friends were messing around. Chris always seemed to be in tears whenever Freddy's was mentioned, when we were there he cried too. So being the stellar big brother I was, my friends and I, we dragged him into the Golden animatronics room and I shoved his head into Freddy's mouth. He was screaming and sobbing, begging me to help him while he was struggling to get out. And... And I just laughed. How could I just laugh?!" Michael had silent tears rolling down his face as he remembered what happened. Dean raised his eyes at Phil, a silent 'I told you so', and Phil shook his head. "Then the damn thing clamped down. Right through to his brain. There was blood. Everywhere. And he just went limp."
Dean felt the lump in his throat as they all pulled up to FredBear's Family Diner. He reluctantly got out of the car and followed his friends to the door, cleverly keeping his eyes from the side of the building.
"Hiya boys." She greeted with a smile. "Who wants to go first?" She asked, setting down one needle and one blood vial. Dean shrugged off one arm of his jacket and shirt without a word. She worked quickly and labelled the full blood vial in under 3 minutes. "Ok, sweetie, your turn. Can you wheel yourself onto the other side of your lovely boyfriend so I can reach his arm please?" She asked Dean. The hunter did as he was told and picked up Cas' hand. Dean mumbled in his ear as the nurse worked to comfort the angel, he knew the angel was powered down of his own volition but he was making nervous whimpers.
"I meant it should be one of us, we can't keep leaving him with my parents." Dean said. Cas turned to Dean with a frown.
"I'm going to inform them of your presence and of your Kingdom's movements." Dean said. Castiel nodded then shuffled to the corner of the platform, lowering himself to his knees easily and placing his hands on his lap. Dean watched him, confused. "What are you doing, Omega?"
Foxy was no longer behind his curtain in Pirate Cove, rather he was in the middle of the room, mid run. Chica was off the show-stage and heading towards the staff only corridor. It took him a moment to find Bonnie but, when he did, he jerked back in shock. Bonnie was stood in the doorway of the storage room, staring up at the camera. Freddy was gazing off towards the security guard's office but he hadn't moved anything but his head.
"You boys can go play now." He said. Cas' smile widened and he grabbed Dean's hand before charging towards the arcade games. They played on the games for a while but they eventually found themselves in the costume storage room as they waited for their other friends.
"You think that the Winchester's need anymore baggage, don't you think you're enough?!" Sathariel growled.
"Nothing is going to happen to me or Phil. We're going to go in and get that blueprint then come back. We aren't going to investigate anything, we aren't looking for anything besides the blueprint. You can watch us the entire time through the camera." Dean reassured, holding Cas' face between his hands. Cas took a deep breath and nodded slowly.
Maria continued with Cas' training then left him at the reception desk for his trial shift. There was a brief rush of teens checking out textbooks then it went silent, until Cas' phone started to ring. He quickly fumbled with it, trying to silence it before he drew too much attention to himself.
"Stop, get off me." Cas said fighting against the hands but the man behind him laid a heavy hand on his upper back to hold him down. "Stop, I have a son, please, get off. Stop it." Cas begged helplessly as the other hand roughly tugged his pants and panties down.
"I'm not the one you need to apologise to either." Dan said. Cas sighed deeply and looked up at Phil, who nodded back seriously. Cas' shoulder's slumped defeatedly and he dragged his feet outside.
"Dean." Phil muttered. Dean moved from Cas' side to the other boy, who was stood not too far from the rest of the group. "There's no light." He whispered.
"Dean, why are you acting like this towards Cas?" Mary asked. Dean simply shrugged, he didn't know how to word his feelings, he never knew how to.
"Yeah, to your car." Dean grinned. "Come on." He said, placing Levi's frame next to them then standing with his son still in his arms. He took Cas' hand then lead the angel into the garage. Stood next to Baby was another sleek looking, black car.
"What?" Cas snapped. Dean was taken aback by the bite in Cas' voice but he stepped forward regardless.
"Nothing to worry about. When was the last time you two had sex?" Dr Ottoway asked as he retracted the probe. Dean frowned and looked down at Cas, who had the same look of confusion on his face.
"Would you say that you both have an active sex life?" Dr Ottoway asked. When he saw the confused looks on the men's faces, he continued, "Do you engage in sexual acts regularly?"
"Sir, I was only a pup when the War of Kingdoms broke out, you cannot believe that I am capable of the same brutality and hatred that my family carried." Castiel offered softly. He wasn't even sure that John would have heard him.
"Cas doesn't want to go home yet. I don't want him to go yet. We don't know that Novak is going to start a war or if they are just going to send out a search party for him." Dean stated. "They don't know everything about us. They don't care to learn."
"It's not safe for you to go into the villages without a guard." Gabriel insisted. Castiel gave him a humourless laugh and looked up at the castle.
"The lay out was different in the first Freddy's." Dean pulled up another blueprint on the other screen. "This room here isn't there in the new version." Dean zoomed in on a section of Freddy's on both blueprints, a room behind the security guards office. "I realised that we turned the cameras on. They were off before us and Golden Bonnie had been going in there before we even got here. He should have noticed that the cameras suddenly turned on."
"Can I get a beer, Dean?" Sam asked. Dean hummed and put his own burger in front of his chair and put Levi's next to Cas. He got everyone a drink then sat down and slid Levi's plate to him. "Thanks Dean." Sam said as they all dug in.
Levi ran around the house energetically go about an hour before he realised that Dean had gone but it didn't put a damper on his mood.
"That's not what I meant." Dean shook his head. "I meant, Levi is younger and so needs me more than Ben does. Ben has lived for six years without me."
"I've set up a motion alert." Charlie said. She slid off her stool and wandered to the couch. "It'll tell up when something moves, what camera detected the movement and record the movements automatically." Phil moved slightly, chuckling at Cas' annoyed whine, and looked at the monitors.
"But then you know all the best bits and the surprises." Dean whined. Cas folded the corner of the page down then closed the book before turning to face Dean fully.
"Yes, that one." Cas confirmed as he checked Levi's bath. Levi toddled over to Dean and tugged on his trousers.
"More." Cas begged. Dean moaned lowly and started to thrust harder into Cas. Another bite into another part of Dean's shoulder muffled another loud cry of pleasure when Dean's cock pounded into his hole and repeatedly hit his prostate. Dean groaned at the sharp pain of nails dragging down his back. "Oh Dean, right there, yeah." Cas whispered through moans. Dean nibbled at Cas' earlobe then kissed his way to Cas' open mouth, knowing that the angel wouldn't respond to a kiss properly.
"I'm so sorry, there's only 3 of us here and only two of us at any one time. Anyway, what can I do for you?" She said with an exhausted smile.
"There were 4 werewolves. One of the other hunters we were working with got killed by one of them and another one was knocked unconscious from the beginning and I was struggling with the one I was fighting but three of them had Dean and was throwing him around and messing him up but I couldn't get to him. He passed out about 20 minutes ago." Sam rushed out in a panic. Cas threw himself on the floor next to Dean.
"What?" Charlie questioned when they realised that they'd walked away. "I hate when they do that." She sighed. The boys laughed at her but turned to watch Dean and Phil. Phil approached the main doors and took the chain and padlock into his hand.
"Hey Cas, what's up?" He asked as he sat up. Cas opened her mouth to answer literally but changed her mind with a shake of her head.
"That comes to $56.38." Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise but handed the boy his card. The teen handed Dean his card and dropped the receipt in the bag before handing the bag to Cas. "Have a nice day." Cas smiled her thanks then exited the store with the guide of Dean's hand on her lower back. They met Sam at the small fountain.
"I'm sure he does, honey, but I just want to know if he gets any alone time. Do you like to play with your other brothers?" She asked in a baby voice. Cas looked up at Dean then looked back at the girl.
"Do you want to investigate?" Charlie asked. They knew that they'd have to follow Cas' lead if they wanted their curiosity to be satisfied. Cas nodded then started to move forward, not looking to see if his friends were following him. He climbed the fence again without a word and inched towards the gap in the bushes.
"We need to leave, right now." Phil said slowly. Dean frowned at the boy and folded the blueprint in his hands.
"I really didn't think this through." Cas said in a disinterested tone. Dean frowned and stepped back.
"Your grace..." Gadreel finally spoke up. "You're not at full strength." Cas' head snapped to Gadreel in surprise. "Gabriel's power is affecting your vessel and your grace. And the nephilim is using your grace to grow." An evil smile made it's way onto Azrael's face.
"I think we should stay in groups of three, just to be safe." Dean murmured, shining his torch around the room. Phil agreed then lead them back out of the room. "Phil and I decided that, if we are going to split up, we need to always be in groups of 3, no less." Dean announced when they joined back with the others. The younger teens nodded, Cas and Dan shuffled towards their best friends, not noticing the knowing smiles from Mark and Charlie.
"That's Freddy, Eli!" Castiel corrected with a small smile. Elijah tilted his head and tried the name a few times. "And that's Bonnie." Castiel continued pointing to the purple bunny on the left of Freddy.
"What happened?" Sam asked, falling back into his seat with his eyes trained on his brother's concealed cuts.
"Hey, baby, look at me, we don't have to." Dean said softly. Cas shook his head and tightened his hands on the other man.
"Go ahead, Omega." Dean encouraged gently. Castiel turned to Mick and shook the hand in front of him weakly.
"You feel so tight around my fingers. You're gonna feel so good around my cock." Dean purred into Cas' ear.
"I'm going for a run with Gabriel, I'll see you at breakfast." Michael announced eventually. "I'll get someone to bring you your supper later." Castiel nodded and stepped back, releasing his brother from his hold. Michael gave Castiel a kiss on the forehead then exited Castiel's room, closing the door softly behind him. Castiel leant against the balcony again, leaning his head against his hand, gazing out into the now dark world.
"No monster, what?" Levi questioned. He looked down at the bite marks and traced them again, then he followed the scratch marks.
"He's just taking you away from us!" Lisa exclaimed suddenly. "If it weren't for him, you'd come with us in a heartbeat."
"He saw something that he's not telling us." Dean glanced around the room and pulled a spare stool up next to Cas then sat down. Cas gazed at Dean fondly then looked down at his stomach sadly.
He navigated his way down the familiar roads until he pulled down a familiar drive. He parked his car in front of the garage, turned off the ignition then slumped back in his seat. A lump started to form in his throat as he looked up at the old house.
"We should go, your son has the same stomach as his father." Cas joked with an affectionate smile towards the nephilim. Dean laughed too, shifting his weight.
"Dean?" Cas said softly to catch the hunter's attention. Once the other had acknowledged him with a gentle hum, Cas continued, "Would you mind getting Gabriel for me? I wish to get rid of these marks as fast as possible." Dean nodded and rested his hand on Cas' arm, he pretended not to notice the slight flinch from the angel.
"Yep, then God made humans from that fish, well he allowed creatures to evolve, and told us to bow to them, to you. Cassie, of course, loved the new creations, as God requested. But then Lucifer rebelled, and Cas was scared of him, of the fighting, of the outcome. Then I left." Gabriel finished, an underlying sadness weighing on him about abandoning his favourite brother when said brother probably needed him the most. "You've come so far, birdie, I'm so proud of you and what you've become." Cas smiled fondly at the childhood nickname and stood to approach his older brother. He embraced his brother tightly, burying his face in Gabriel's shoulder. Dean watched the brothers fondly, barely turning his head when he heard his own brother approaching.
"It's not your fault, Gabe. It's the bastard's who tried to rape her, they're at fault." Dean said jumping to Gabriel's defense.
"Yes, sweetheart?" Dean asked in a sickeningly sweet tone. Cas shook his head and turned to run from the hunter. Dean threw his head back in a laugh and quickly followed the angel. Levi watched his parents run around happily, clapping his hands to encourage Dean on.
"Look at you." Dean murmured. Cas watched the scene with a racing heart, the feeling of love rushed though his body but his heart clenched painfully. He didn't know how Dean would respond to him now that he was back to his usual state, he was hopeful but he didn't expect Dean to treat him as he did when the angel was female.
"There's still a chance!" Cas shook his head in disbelief. They sat in tense silence as they tried to calm themselves down.
"You love it, I see you blush every time." Dean replied with a smirk. Cas gave him a half-hearted glare as the blush on his cheeks deepened, Dean winked at the younger boy and shoved him towards the stairs. Cas stuck his tongue out at Dean childishly and made his way up the stairs. "Ok, let him in." Dean said to Phil, waving towards the door.
Both Hannah and Ion were shooing the princes off the buffet table when Chuck returned to the ballroom. He chuckled upon seeing the omega and beta servant chase the princes around as they tried to stop them stealing the food.
"A nephilim grows at a much faster rate than human baby. It takes two to three days for it to form it's soul fully, the part of Dean within it took a tiny part of Dean's soul and, while it grows within Cas, it will take a tiny part of his grace then in those two or three day it will 'twist' it's parent's soul to make it their own. When it's soul is formed, it will need to form it's own body according to it's parents appearances. During this period, Cas will need to be in his normal body because when the baby has it's body it'll be a 1 year old human. It will confuse the baby if one of it's parents changes while it's so young." Gabriel explained. Sam nodded in understanding.
"Sam's gone out on a food run." A voice stated from the kitchen, startling Cas out of his trance. Cas turned to watch Dean sit next to him on the sofa. "How are you doing?" Dean raised his arm to rest it on the back of the sofa behind Cas' head. Cas turned his eyes back to Levi and took a deep breath before he met the hunter's gaze.
"You did." Cas replied. Dean smiled fondly and tipped Cas' head up so they could press their lips together.
"Yeah, alright, dad." Mark joked. They knew that Phil was serious but after finding the bones they needed some light hearted conversations, even if it was regarding Freddy's. They knew when to be serious. They ordered more drinks and fell into happy conversation. The group was laughing loudly when Cas' phone began to ring.
"Levi, this is from Uncle Gabe." Dean announced handing Levi the present. "And I bet I can guess what it is." He muttered afterwards, scowling up at the archangel, who shrugged.
"Who's this?" Lisa asked, her voice high, supposedly enticing. Dean's eyebrows furrowed briefly and he stepped back minutely.
"Since we found that your grace isn't at full power, I figured that this would be more painful for you... and more fun for me." Af explained before pressing the sharp blade to the flesh of her bare arm. "Let's start off simple." Then he pushed down. Cas bit her lip through the pain, only allowing a quiet whine past her lips. Gadreel's eyebrows furrowed and he looked away. Once he had worked with the Winchester's, he had helped Castiel live before and, while he didn't agree with bringing a nephilim into the world, he didn't want to kill his brother. Plus he believed that the Winchester's could raise it to be good and in control of it's powers but the other seven angels wouldn't allow him to back out now. "Those
"Dean, open some of your presents." Cas said softly once everyone had calmed down. He reached over to stroke his hand through Levi's curls. Dean's eyes softened on the angel, he nodded and looked through the presents to find one for him.
"What if you put us in one of your tricks with one of them, so we can see how we react." Sam suggested. Gabriel hesitantly nodded and stood. Sam followed his lead and nodded. After a click of Gabriel's fingers, Sam's vision went black. Dean took Cas' hand as they waited.
"I would be but you keep asking me to watch American Horror Story." Cas answered. Dean smiled and stroked his thumb over her cheekbone.
"Thanks, baby." Dean whispered before he leant in to press their lips together. The kiss was short and they quickly re-positioned themselves as they had been when Sam interrupted their family time.
"Ironic, isn't it? He was terrified of the things because he thought they ate people and then he got bit." Michael grumbled. Dean frowned, he could see how distraught Michael was about losing his brother; he knew he'd be the same if Sam died, he knew Martyn would be the same if Phil died, hell, he knew any of them would be the same if any of them died. "Anyway, my dad used to work with your dad."
"Cas..." Gabriel started but Cas shook his head. Dean leant on the counter next to the oven and watched the brothers carefully.
"What did you find?" Dean asked when they met back a their house. They sat in the living room, Sam, Dean and Cas were sat on the couch while Gabriel had conjured up a LoveSac.
"Are you going to say goodbye to Levi?" Cas mumbled, leaning into Dean's hand as he continued to stroke the other man's hair.
"Yes, Dean, Dean's a good man." Cas returned in a fond tone. Amber smirked knowingly. She hooked the bra for Cas then continued to speak.
"Ok, how long do I have to get ready?" Castiel asked sleepily. He had been so nervous the night before that he hadn't slept well, he kept waking up from nightmares of what could happen.
"Is it... urgent?" Castiel asked hesitantly. The patient was bloodied and bruised, and clearly had a broken leg but the other nurses weren't rushing as they usually would.
"Isn't it supposed to be motherly intuition?" Cas asked with a teasing smile. Dean laughed mockingly and leant over to press a quick kiss to Cas' lips before turning the music off and laying the phone on the couch. "So what's the name you thought of?"
"Hey, baby." Dean's voice reached him and his eyes opened. Dean's voice was soft but Cas could hear the happiness in it. Cas stood gracefully and stepped into Dean's open arms. "I think I found a way to tell."
"Papa." Levi mumbled, leaning towards Cas with his arms outstretched. Cas smiled fondly at his son and took him into his arms.
"All is forgiven. You boys may have some fun together before our guests arrive." Chuck murmured, he pulled his children into a hug then left the ballroom.
"Levi, this is from Uncle Sammy." Dean laid the thick heavy present on Sam's lap next to the boy. Levi dropped his toys and ripped at the paper.
"You're okay, brother." He whispered as he channeled his grace into the wound and healed it. Gabriel was pressing a kiss to her forehead when the brothers' attention was drawn away from the angels to a figure behind them.
"I hate you." Castiel grumbled. They exited the castle, and left the grounds together. They didn't need any guards as three of them were alphas.
"He doesn't want you, he's using you, they all are. We're just going to end your suffering... After having some fun." Sathariel cackled. "You deserve this, they aren't even looking for you... they're rejoicing. Dean was using you for your body, when he finds out you're carrying this abomination he'll cast you out." He continued, voicing all of Cas' fears. The worst part was that Cas believed his brothers. "Dean would leave you if Gabriel gave you your usual vessel back and you know it." Cas let out a pitiful cry and nodded in agreement. Sathariel grinned up at Af and nodded. "Remember you're doing the universe a favour, Castiel." He murmured as he stroked a hand through her hair, the action could have been seen as a sign of affection between siblings but it repulsed Cas. Af strode forward with a knife in hand, twirling it menacingly.
"Aww, isn't she adorable!" A voice cooed from behind Dean. The older Winchester turned to the teenage girl confused but understood when he saw her looking at Cas. The toddler pointed at a bee plushy excitedly.
Trigger Warning for rape. (The way Cas deals with the assault isn't necessarily how anyone would deal with such a thing and is a very idealistic way of recovery. This isn't my expectation of survivors because I know that this unrealistic and I have no experience of this, this is purely fiction and shouldn't be used in real life experiences because, depending on you and your personality, it is a very unrealistic way of dealing and recovering. Realistically, therapy and other means of support are the ideal way.)
"He's on the other side of the castle walls, Castiel, are you taking a guard?" Gabriel asked hurriedly, his tone laced with concern.
"No, you've been inappropriate towards me, your son has been disrespectful towards Cas and Levi and I want you to get out of my house." Dean replied, his face blank and cold. Lisa glared at the man then turned on her heel.
"Yeah, my boyfriend's just asking me something for Levi." Cas explained. Maria nodded with a small smile.
"Am I not?" Dean murmured, moving closer to Cas' face. Cas felt Dean's warm breath on his cheek and took a shaky breath.
"Kindness is something everyone should practice." Castiel said. "You should protect the others in your pack, not bully them." He carefully lifted the pups off the smaller one and sent them next to him.
"If I'm lucky and he chooses to stay... You are looking at your future Head Omega." Dean's voice was low and serious but the blonde omega could hear the awe in the Alpha's tone. Dean's eyes watched Castiel's back for a moment then turned to the blonde omega. "Omega, meet my sister-in-law, Jessica." Castiel broke his fascinated gaze and turned back to the wolves.
"You could go on a run with us, puppy?" Michael suggested softly. Castiel's mind wandered to the maps sat on his desk, he knew his plan was crazy but he just had to see the forest, however, he didn't want to raise any alarms in his family.
"Good, you're my best friend, man. Gotta keep you in top form for us." Dean said, slapping Cas' shoulder. The angel deflated slightly as his vision became slightly blurry.
"I can't do it anymore, I'm going to take Levi to a motel tonight and stay there for a few days while I try to figure everything out." Sam looked at Cas sympathetically. He nodded and left Cas in peace.
"But they're different interpretations, the way I envision the story won't be the way it's shown on film. Besides I've seen you watch movies more than once before." Cas said. Dean smiled and nodded his head before turning back to the kitchen. Sam came down the stairs with his laptop and sat down opposite Cas, he saw the book she was reading and smiled.
"Sure, leave that blueprint on the top and let's go." Dean decided. Cas sighed a heavy sigh but did as he was told then followed Dean and Mark back out to the parking lot. Cas looked back towards the boarded pizzeria, almost disappointed that they hadn't found anything interesting.
"He's very protective." Cas explained as he leant towards the computer, hoping that she'd take the hind and continue their lesson.
"Who says I have an appetite for food?" The hunter whispered into Cas' ear then he continued to mark Cas' neck. Cas bit his lip again and pressed himself against Dean more fully. A content sigh passed Cas' lips and he moved his hand around Dean's body to grip his shoulder blade. Much to Dean's dismay, however, the baby monitor on Dean's bedside table came to life.
"Of course I would." Dean insisted, "Daddy, Papa, your uncles and your grandparents would all look for you. And we wouldn't stop until we found you." Levi nodded, content with his dad's answer. Dean shifted the blanket over them and they continued to watch the movie.
"No Cas, you haven't pissed us off." He insisted with a small smile. Cas' cheeks flushed delicately.
." Sam insisted. He clicked onto some of the crime scene photos and turned the laptop round to face them. Dean gagged at the sight and focused on the cup in front of him. The victims were unrecognisable; skin was hanging off muscles, chunks of flesh separated from the bone, organs hanging out, bones were twisted in un-natural directions.
"Thanks, slut." Said the man. The only words he had said to Cas. Cas curled in on himself and sobbed into his arms. He felt like he had been split in two, and not in the good way like with Dean. He felt like he was burning and bleeding, his wrists hurt and he was sure that his cheek was grazed from being pressed into the gravel.
Castiel retired to his bedroom once they got back to the castle and smile secretively upon seeing the package on his bed. He made sure his door was properly closed then jumped onto his bed. He opened the package and laid the contents out on the sheets.
"Thanks mom." Dean said, finally closing the book and placing it next to him, on the AHS boxset. "Here you go, sweetheart, from Gabe." Cas took the box and turned to scowl at his brother.
"No use taking pity on him when that's where he wanted to be." Dean grinned, only taking his eyes off his task to wink at Cas. Cas blushed delicately. Sam chuckled at the two and returned to entertaining Levi. Dean took Levi's cut-up pancake to the boy and handed him the little plastic fork despite knowing the boy wouldn't use it then he turned to his place behind Cas. The angel could feel the outline of Dean's dick pressed against his ass through their boxers, which caused him to lower his head to his chest and close his eyes for a second.
"I don't know it just isn't working." Charlie responded. They listened to the clattering of pots and the clicking of a gas oven, trying to figure out what the Golden Bonnie was doing.
"I'm going to bed." Dean stated. He lead Cas up to his room and small smile spread across Dean's face when he saw Levi curled up against the pillows. "I'm sorry it didn't seem like I cared when you told me that he was having nightmares." Dean said as he turned to Cas. "I should have listened to you, not brushed you off like I did. You and Levi
"Levi, no, I told you not to open that door." Dean said sternly. Levi turned in shock at his father's tone then bowed his head upon seeing his father towering over him.
"He'll start aging one year after he was born. You won't have missed that much, if you're worried he won't be influenced by you then that won't be an issue." Cas reasoned.
"Gabriel give me my towels and clothes back." She hissed angrily. Gabriel laughed and shook his head. Cas rolled her eyes then her gaze landed on Dean. "Erm... Dean can I borrow a shirt or something?" Dean's eyes ran over her exposed form and a small smirk appeared on his face.
"Wanna look like Daddy!" Levi exclaimed excitedly. Cas laughed and shook his head, he set Levi in his crib so he could get Levi's clothes out of the dresser. He got Levi dressed then stood back to look at the boy; Levi had on a plain grey t-shirt under a signature Winchester plaid shirt with dark jeans and little combat boots. Levi giggled and started to dance excitedly.
Outside the storm was picking up; wind was beating against the side of the house and shaking the foundations, the rain was pouring heavily and thunder and lightening broke the silences and lit up the darkest corners of the house.
"Deanie's shirt." Cas explained with a small smile. The girl cooed again and gently tugged on one of Cas' curly bunches, which had Dean flinching back minutely.
"I don't understand why she doesn't give him the benefit of the doubt here." Dean said when he knew he had her attention. Cas closed the book around her finger and smiled gently.
"Where do you think you need to be, Omega? You're miles from any of your precious kingdoms. Do you think you can get there before I get you?" The alpha asked lowly. Castiel shuffled away from the wolf.
"You haven't noticed." Dean stated simply. When Castiel said his small no, Dean stood up, smiling when Castiel tilted his head slightly, and knelt next to Castiel. "You are my mate, my true mate."
"Daddy and Uncle Sammy are in Baby, buggy, Honey is the only car we have." Cas explained as he strapped the boy in.
"Bath time, Levi." Cas said as Mary and John started to clear away the table. Dean followed them up the stairs to Cas' bathroom. Levi was running around in little circles as Cas filled up the bath. Dean leant in the door frame and smiled.
"He's still at the motel. He figured that Levi should be in an environment that feels normal to him so got me to bring him back here." Sam explained, putting the bag down next to Dean on the table. Dean's smile dropped completely. He nodded slowly then started up the stairs to his room, abandoning the sandwich. Sam frowned at that, Dean never left food, no matter what. Something was wrong. Upstairs, Dean laid down on his bed with Levi sat on his stomach.
"There's 4 hip bones, 8 arms and hands and 8 legs and feet. Which suggests 4 bodies." Charlie said, gesturing to the bones to illustrate her point.
All of the victims had brusing around their wrists and ankles, which suggested that they had been bound and restrained during the torture. They had extensive bruising all over their bodies that coupled with many lacerations that varied in severity. Many bones were broken in each victim but they differed between the indiviuals, however, all of the victims had broken legs. They all had dark, distinctive hand marks around their necks but none of them died of asphyxiation, perhaps they had meerly been starved of oxygen momentarily as part of their torture. Death Wish had mutilated some of his victim's genitals but not all, the reason for this factor had not been found. The cause of death was found to be starvation and dehydration. Of course, there was the signature DW carved into every victim's chest, which everyone assumed stood for Death Wish after the lead investigator had publicly said that the public 'must have a death wish to leave their homes at night with this killer on the loose'. This explanation would make sense if the initals had appeared after the investigator made his announcement but they had been there from the beginning, they'd been there with Lisa.
Cas woke up hours later to a tinny whining coming over the baby monitor. He rolled out of bed, grabbing his phone on the way, then stumbled sleepily to Levi's room.
"What were you thinking about?" Dan huffed humourlessly and looked at Cas, leaning his head against his hand.
"Daddy, Papa, tree in house!" Levi shouted, preventing Cas from reacting to the kiss. They turned to the boy with smiles on their faces.
"No, alpha, I simply started walking and then that alpha started to chase me and I seem to have lost my way." Castiel responded. The Head Alpha hummed. The smallest alpha let out a quite growl, a rumble in his throat at most. Castiel cowered back slightly, the alphas were still belly on the ground but that could change very quickly.
"We're having a baby, sweetheart." Dean murmured fondly once they were alone. Cas grinned up at Dean and took the hunter's hand so he could lay it on his stomach.
"You need to be good today, ok Levi? Me and Papa don't want to have to tell you off on Christmas." Dean said as he set Levi's waffle in front of him. Levi nodded, maintaining eye contact with his father. Dean gave the boy a smile then turned to make the rest of his family their breakfast.
"Who told him that?" Dean asked. Castiel frowned as he tried to recall. Suddenly, his hand held Dean's forearm tightly and the scent of scared omega filled the air.
"It was easy. I got the shifter to look like you, Dean. I mean he loves you so much that he happily followed, must have been painful to have someone you love so much hurt you the way I got my shifter to hurt your angel. Of course, he's an angel, he knew it was a shifter but it's still gotta hurt." Not-Cas said with an evil grin. Dean's face dropped in dread.
It didn't take the long to buy each other presents and soon they were all carrying bags, now they were just wandering around waiting for Dean to finish.
"Levi." Dean barked despite Cas' words. Dean pressed a gentle kiss to Cas' lips as an apology when Cas frowned. "Levi, come on. I'm not messing around, if we're late for Papa's appointment I'm not going to be happy." Cas turned to Gabriel, who was watching them carefully. Dean clenched his jaw in annoyance and stepped away from Cas to fetch Levi. Dean stomped up the stairs and caught Levi by the arm as the boy ran by him. "Levi Winchester, I have been calling you. I told you how important this appointment is for me and Papa, we do not have time for this." Dean said sternly. He carried Levi down the stairs on his hip and smiled weakly at Cas. "Which car is his seat in?"
"Could you please make your mac and cheese? Please?" Cas begged, his eyes wide with a pleading smile. Dean laughed at the shift in Cas' demeanor but nodded.
Cas' eyes began to slip shut but they snapped open when a scream filled the air. The bright flash of an angel dying was the only source of light in the room that was now familiar to her. She tried to keep her eyes open but her body wouldn't allow it. In the haze of her mind, she heard a voice talking to her and hands shaking her. The voice sounded like it was underwater but she focused on it as hard as she could.
"Hi, guys, we're back." Sam announced, pushing the door open. John, Mary and John greeted Sam with tight hugs first, Cas held back until the others had stepped back then he met the younger Winchester with his own hug. "Hi Cas, how've you and Levi been?" He asked.
"Here, Cas, from Bobby." Dean handed the angel a small, neatly wrapped box. Cas smiled gratefully at the gruff hunter and tentatively opened the paper. He opened the box inside and grinned.
He slipped back into his room, closing the balcony doors, and climbed onto his bed. He longed to have a book that detailed the customs of the different kingdom's from a view that wasn't biased. He wasn't bothered by Novak, MacLeod, Adler or Roman, he knew all about them, he cared about the savages. It was them that his father was the most cautious about and he wanted to know why, from a neutral standpoint. He knew that royals, such as his family, regarded them as violent and uncivilised but it seemed that they were exaggerating when they told their stories.
"You think that's worrying, you should see yourself." Said Sam from the side of the bed. Dean jumped up from the bed and dashed to the bathroom. Staring back at him was himself but not as he was when he fell asleep with Cas in his arms rather as he was at 17.
An unusual rush of activity alerted Castiel to a change on the ward. He put the patient's file on the end of the bed and hurried out into the hall. The double doors to the ward were being breached by a hospital bed with a man laying on it and two of the nurses from the ER were pushing the bed through.
Other people may have found it odd to find the boys sat comfortably in a room full of endoskeletons, metal body parts and empty suits but they found it fascinating. Cas had grown up with stray pieces of metal around the house and loved to watch his father work in his workshop, so sitting in the costume storage room was like being back home.
"If the victim truly loves the siren then it will become human." Cas elaborated. The boys looked down in thought.
"They'll be better off without me. They all are." Dean had a guilty, far away look on his face as he thought about his children growing up without him in their life, without them in his life.
They pulled into the garage in silence. Cas hopped out of the car quickly and unstrapped Levi. He hurried into the house, ignoring Dean as he comforted his son.
"Why not?!" Cas exclaimed. Levi frowned from his place in the back seat, he was watching his parents confused, he was smarter than most his age, that came with being half angel but he didn't understand what his parents were arguing about.
"Oh, babe, your longing is so obvious. It's heartbreaking. Perhaps we can have a little fun before my friend gets here, hmm?" Not-Dean purred. Cas looked up at the other, confused. Not-Dean cupped Cas' jaw gently and pulled him into a kiss. Cas melted into the kiss, momentarily forgetting that it wasn't actually Dean. He allowed himself the luxury of the illusion for a few minutes before his senses returned. Cas forced himself to break away, turning his head to the side. However, Not-Dean was having none of it, he simply turned his attention to Cas' neck. "Come on, angel. I know you want this. It'll be just like you're with Dean, I promise." Not-Dean murmured into Cas' neck. Not-Dean pressed kisses down Cas' neck, sucking and nipping gently. Cas sighed and let himself enjoy the feeling, it wasn't like he could do anything about it anyway. Not-Dean smiled against Cas' warm skin and ripped the white dress shirt open, the blazer and trenchcoat had already been removed before he'd been tied down. A furious blush spread up Cas' neck to his cheeks and over his chest after he let out a quiet moan as the other sucked marks into the angel's neck possessively. Not-Dean smirked and continued to mark the angel's chest after he was satisfied with the dark bruises scattered over Cas' tan neck.
The man's short, brown hair was greasy and flattened against his head, he had an angular jaw that was covered in day old stubble and plump lips. His bare torso was toned and muscular, his legs were muscular too and were covered in fine hair. Everything about him screamed masculinity, though his face was relaxed and youthful in his unconscious state.
"I thought you loved him, Dean." Sam murmured softly. Dean's face softened at his baby brother's tone, he sounded like a sad child.
"Harharhar, very funny. I would ignore it but she's making me feel like a bad parent." Dean said, sounding defeated.
"No, there never is." Cas offered without further explanation. But again, they all knew what he meant; nothing ever managed to damage Freddy's, though many tried. Not man nor nature. A flood had passed though Lawrence a few years prior, many lives were affected, but Freddy's, Freddy's remained completely untouched as though an unseen force was protecting the perimeter.
He looked around the dark forest and took a shaky breath, the occasional flash of the fireworks did little to light the dense forest. He didn't have any other form of light that wasn't the useless fireworks or the bright moon. He knew that if he shifted he would be able to see better but he wouldn't be able to wear his cloak, which would make his adventure more dangerous than it already was and he couldn't take that risk. Gadreel didn't have any maps of the surrounding forests and he couldn't ask the servants for them without the servants telling his father or brothers, so he knew that the next leg of his adventure would be the most difficult. He had to make sure he always knew which way he needed to go to get back to the Kingdom of Novak. Or he would become another victim of the forest.
"Yeah, baby, I'm fine. They're just a little tender." Dean reassured softly. He took Cas' hands in his own, joining their fingers together to pull him down and press their lips together in a loving kiss. Dean released one of Cas' hand and pulled Cas closer by his waist. Cas sighed happily and curled his now free hand around Dean's head, letting his thumb gently flick at the hunter's earlobe every so often.
"But I... You... No... I don't... No." Castiel stuttered, shaking his head in a panic. Dean frowned and cupped Castiel's cheek, letting the omega scent his wrist to calm down. "How do you know?"
"I'm showing Omega Prince Castiel around." Dean said pulling Castiel to stand in front of him. "Omega, this is Donna, she's in charge of this place." The bubbly omega grinned at Castiel and stepped forward with her arms open. "Go ahead." Dean murmured when he felt Castiel hesitate.
"Levi, uncle Sam is coming to pick you up." Cas said softly after kneeling next to Levi. The little boy perked up at the mention of Sam.
"It looks like the ones I found in your house, Cas." Dean said, looking up at Cas, his eyebrows furrowed.
"I wanted to make sure you were ok." Dean confessed, not making eye contact with the angel. Cas laughed humourlessly.
"I do. I love him so damn much. That's why I gotta go. I gotta respect his wishes, right? That's what you do when you love someone, right Sammy? You do anything for them, anything to keep them happy, even if it kills you." Sam had never heard so much emotion in his brother's voice before, like he was barely holding himself together, like he had to fight every instinct he had to even get the words out. Dean wiped his face quickly, clearing his face of tears, then turned to the table and grabbed one of the books on nephilims. Sam watched him for a moment, watching the movement and the deflation of his spirit, and frowned. This wasn't his brother.
"Did you even listen to me earlier, Gabriel?" Cas snapped. Dean chose to re-enter the kitchen and return to the table.
"Cas, what happened? When the siren took you?" Dean questioned hesitantly. Cas frowned and turned his face away, hoping the distance would prevent Dean hearing Cas' sniffles. Dean frowned and reached his hand out to grip Cas' shoulder but stopped himself upon recalling the way the angel had flinched away from him, "Cas, whatever it was, it wasn't your fault but... I know it must have been bad and... it must have been to do with me because you've never flinched away from me before, not like you have been doing." Dean watched Cas' breath stutter before the angel slowly turned to face him.
"What you doing there, sweetheart?" Dean asked lowly. Their bodies were close, Cas could feel the heat coming from Dean and the way Dean spoke sent tingles down Cas' back.
"I know you do, Dean." Sam replied, his eyes on his nephew. They continued watching the movie until Cas started down the stairs when Dean turned to face them. Cas was wearing some tight, soft-looking, black pants with a black tank top that had a white lace collar, Dean's jaw dropped.
"Yes, bitch, I can be professional." Dean bit back with a returning smirk. "Suit up we'll go in 10 minutes." Sam and Dean went upstairs and changed into their FBI suits.
"One each day." Levi said in a deep voice then he burst out in giggles. His parents laughed along with him before Cas continued his explanation.
When they returned home, everyone gathered in the living room. Levi was toddling around happily with his otter in one hand and Cas' bee in the other. Cas was making everyone dinner, watching Levi with a small smile.
"I have my reasons to be happy; I live with my brother, my best friend, my boyfriend and my son, my boyfriend finally 'got his head out of his ass' and is acting as though we are a couple again and I have a job." Sam's eyes softened and he gave the angel a fond smile.
"Dean..." Dean's attention was turned away from Cas and their son when he heard his mother's voice, thick with emotion. Dean had given Mary three photos; one of Sam, Dean and John, one of just Sam and Dean and one of Sam, Dean and Cas.
A few hours later, Castiel returned to Dean's room but startled at the form sat in the chair next to Dean's bed.
"Thomas, if you don't mind I'd like to speak with you for a moment." Dean said. Thomas nodded and lead Dean into the kitchen, shutting the door behind them. Sam turned back to the 'happy couple'. Out the corner of his eye, he saw Cas nod at Ryan once again then he watched as Hayden reached into the sofa cushions and hold the knife against his side.
"Daddy do it." Levi stated after swallowing. Cas joined his family at the table and smiled to himself at the boy's answer.
"Cas! You're ok!" Sam exclaimed when he saw the figure stood next to Gabriel. "I'm so glad you're ok." Sam said pulling Cas into a tight hug. "Is the baby ok?" Sam asked.
Cas had also told him that Sam hadn't visited since he was first admitted and he was worried about Zeppelin.
"You underestimate me once again." Gabriel said. "They're in your rooms. Get into them then I'll take us there." With childlike excitement, the brother's ran up the stairs to change. "You too, Cassie." Before long, the boys were downstairs waiting for Cas. Dean turned when he heard Cas' soft footfalls on the stairs, Gabriel had given her a simple, black, halter neck bikini. Dean smiled softly and made his way to the door with Sam.
"We'd need tools to break that open." Dean muttered to him. Phil nodded in confirmation then dropped the chain. Dean lead the way around the perimeter, checking every board-covered window, until he reached the outside play area. They jumped over the fence to check the back door. "It's a fire exit, not chained but locked. If we can get in this time then we can unlock it and close up the way we come in. Leave this open." Dean suggested. Phil nodded, he stepped forward and pressed his face against the cool glass of the door, his hands cupping around his eyes so he could see better. It was understandably dark within the building as he peered in but his eyes were drawn to the light streaming in from deeper within, behind the show-stage.
"Cas, he... he said it was my fault." Dean stuttered out between sobs. Sam frowned and pulled Dean into a tight hug.
"Levi, come here please." Dean said sternly. Cas stood up and put his hands on his hips. Dean crouched down to Levi's height and looked at the boy with hard eyes. Levi avoided his father's eyes by looking at the floor. Dean put his hands on Levi's cheeks gently so he could meet Levi's eyes again. "Do you want to go shopping with me and Papa or do you want to stay here with Uncle Gabe?"
"Levi, coat please." Cas said, holding the brown replica of Dean's leather jacket in his hand. Levi stopped in his tracks and skipped back to his father.
"It could be." In a silent agreement, they turned from the door to hop the fence again. The arcade room, along with the kitchen and the storage room, jutted out from the main rectangle shape of the building. They checked each of the boards carefully, seeing if any of them were loose. "Dean," Phil called out softly. "this one's hanging off, the window is open." Dean jogged over to the window Phil was stood in front of. The black haired boy tried to tug on the wood to move it away from the window but found he wasn't strong enough, it was shifting slightly but the nails weren't coming loose.
He prayed that the baby was Dean's but he had a dull ache in his chest that was telling him that it wasn't. Things in their lives never seemed to go as they wanted so he had the feeling that his pregnancy wouldn't be any different.
It took them a few hours without stopping to get to the house that held Cas. Dean had jumped put the car as soon as they'd stopped, barely taking the time to turn the engine off. Sam grabbed Dean's arm before the elder could run into the building with no protection.
"How are we going to get passed it?" Dean asked apprehensively. The fire exit was right next to Pirate's Cove, right next to Foxy.
