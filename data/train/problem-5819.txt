Sometimes Bucky’s bad days lasted a few days sometimes it could be hours. It amazed Steve how quickly they could switch. “How come I don’t like sex,” Bucky asked.
Everyone was the small little Lego piece version of the other Avengers. Natasha felt herself getting choked up. “Thanks,” she muttered and walked away before she could embarrass herself.
Sam laid on his side as Loki relaxed against the board. “It’s illegal to film musicals and plays without permission and royalties, but people do it anyways. They’re called bootlegs.”
Still, Bucky meet his eyes and started to juggle the knives not even looking at them. Steve was hopelessly in love with him. They weren’t together. Not really. Neither of them were ready for a relationship like that. Not that Steve thought Bucky remembered that they had been in a relationship before.
“After Natasha left,” Steve explained and pulled Bucky off the quinjet leaving Tony to follow, “we decided to go sightseeing. Vision gave us a few recommendations for some great places in Europe.”
“Don’t drink that,” Rhodey warned not looking away from his conversation as Wanda levitated the coffee away from Clint.
It had been a Sunday evening and he was walking around Queens, disguised in his hat and sunglasses. If Natasha saw him she would throw a fit, but it wasn’t like he was on a mission at the moment. He’d spent the evening at Sam’s apartment helping him move in.
Bucky looked down at Loki and dropped the blanket in his lap before going over to Steve and climbing on top of him. Steve sighed and stretched out his body to get more comfortable.
Loki drummed his fingers against the stone then his fingers danced over his wrist, empty of chains but still feeling them. “I want to know why you did that to me,” Loki announced and then gulped, “I don’t understand. I was being
“I wanted a nap and I’m not sleeping in a fucking chair,” Bucky answered climbing to his feet and leaning against Steve’s back.
Peter woke up at ten fourteen and quickly got dressed. He grabbed his advanced chemistry book and headed down the stairs to the couch by the window. He pulled his Captain America blanket across his lap and started reading. When he first brought the blanket over Tony had screamed.
Before Sam turned around again Loki was gone. The next day Loki did not leave his room again. Sam brought in chicken noodle soup at lunch but left Loki to his own devices. F.R.I.D.A.Y kept track of his activities which mostly included sleeping, reading any book he could find, and sneaking out of his bedroom at night to go to the kitchen and poke around looking for books. When Sam ran into his again at night he gave Loki a Stark pad with books on it and explained how it worked to him. While Loki still wasn’t speaking he seemed pleased.
Then she disappeared into the crowd and Steve kept walking into the crowd ignoring Scott and Clint’s protest. As he got near the dance floor a man snatched his finger’s into Steve’s belt loops and tugged him onto the dance floor. “God you’re handsome,” the man purred.
It wasn’t like they spent all their time together. Bucky went to the shooting range with Clint a lot and Steve went out with Sam. But for the most part, they were together a lot.
Sam turned his head towards Bucky’s shout. “Coming asshole,” he answered taking Loki’s original plate with him.
Tony quirked up an eyebrow. Loki shrugged. “I was gonna say that the parent instincts, I have somehow, developed tell me to warn you away from my kid, but they are new and need some fine tuning and you can’t even defend yourself, so you can’t hurt him and since you said that and didn’t drive him away that means you’ve seen the R5 videos and I’m rambling.”
Loki scrunched his nose. “Yesterday you said that the meats on Asgard aren’t good for Frost Giants, does that extend to all meat? What kind of food is good for you.”
When Peter finally got better Natasha was very attached to him more than she thought was possible and he seemed fond of her as well. In his semi-conscious state, he had recognized it was her taking care of him so he tried to show his appreciation. And Tony was appreciative as well.
“How do you like living with Sam,” Gideon asked, “not too boring huh? If he won’t take you out to do anything I’ll give you blackmail material.”
Like they didn’t know that she was telling the truth but that wasn’t what the question was aimed at. And she knew that damn well. “How did you get in here,” Vision questioned popping up from behind Sam.
The words pressed against Sam’s throat but wouldn’t come out. Tears slid down his cheeks. She whipped them away without looking kissing the top of his head. “Rylie,” he admitted.
Steve supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised when Thor arrived three days later. Steve was getting into one of the ranch house kitchens to look for Clint's secret stash of girl scout cookies when he saw the Thunder God sitting at the bar eating a pop tart. “Uh, Thor?”
“I guess he had a point,” he admitted and his brain glitched back to being an awkward mess, “you got heart kid. Where’re you from?”
Thor hadn’t mentioned that to Loki, but he supposed that didn’t matter. Loki shrugged. “I’ve never met her,” he answered, “but I saw her in Thor’s and Jane’s? dreams. Strange little thing, not powerful, but I’m sure that comes from lack of training, but very dedicated.”
Sam considered and went up to Steve’s studio. “You’re not painting me,” Sam informed him as he went over to the window to watch Bucky take Loki around his garden.
Loki heard the dismissal, but this had to be the wrong room. This room was nice and comfortable. Well furnished. Warm. Usual he had to earn these things. This has to be wrong.
The next day Tony was having breakfast in the tower by himself because Peter had gone back to May’s yesterday for school and Pepper had a meeting. Rhodey walked in a large set of papers in his hand. “You’re going to go see them tonight aren’t you,” he asked.
“Still,” Sam argued, “no one’s asked you to be a part of that and if they did you’d have all the right to say no, but you haven’t. So thanks.”
His eyes flickered to Rhodey and now that it seemed to be clear that this wasn’t going to turn into a fight he asked softly, “how are you holding up?”
“Your kid was a horse,” Sam exclaimed unable to process that even though there were more important things to deal with, “I don’t get how that works.”
Natasha was laughing as she hung up. Sam chuckled rolling his eyes. The room was more or less just as set up as the last room was so Sam called it close enough and went back downstairs using the fire pole because sue him, he had wanted to be a firefighter when he was little.
Sam and Bucky tensed. Pepper smiled. “He’s fine,” she assured them, “you seemed very worried about him in your letters.”
There was a set of staircases that lead to a basement that sounded quieter, the lights looked gentler. “The café is down there,” a short little woman announced with a smile, “you have that newcomer look. It’s for the younger people, the ones who don’t want alcohol, or for people with sensation sensitivities. Welcome home.”
The other teens frowned at Loki’s sudden defensiveness, about something that no one accused him of. “The only non-obvious way you could cheat is if you were shuffling the deck,” Drake stated, “and you haven’t shuffled the deck.”
He shook his head at her. “It’s still Rhodey, not Colonel” he answered passing over a cookie with a smirk “Pepper is in the screening room picking out a movie for us to watch.”
Loki nodded and followed after the smaller man. Loki wanted to see the Temptress of Jane and Jane herself he liked Jane. That’s why he had tried to split her up from Thor. Thor the fool loved dearly, but a human woman would not have been able to survive him if Odin had turned Thor into what he had dreamed.
Loki smiled. “I appreciate that. I’m going to stay here,” Loki informed him, “I have school tomorrow.”
“I forgot about that message,” Sam said as she entered, “I thought we had at least a few years to figure this out.”
The next day Sam watched Lo rush down the stairs in his favorite skirt and dark “Bucky Barnes” sweater and eyeliner the way Natasha had taught him to wear it. Natasha pulled him into the lighting and took a few pictures and had them sent to everyone.
Natasha nodded pulling herself and Peter out of the tub nustling him close to her chest. Wanda got up from where she was sitting in the hall and followed them to Cho’s lab in the house. Wanda plopped herself on a chair in the waiting room with a look that said she was listening for when they would need her and she was going to stay out of the way till then.
Sam really wished that Peter would ease Loki into gay culture, but this needed to be addressed anyways. “Do you know what consent is?”
She hopped off the counter and made her way over pulling him in for a hug. He hugged her back. “I’m sorry for what happened,” she apologized.
That had been all she wanted from him. Support, someone to watch her back and he had given it to her freely. He rolled his eyes but smiled.
Wanda didn’t bother to answer thinking. She did spend most nights here because she helped Laura with dinner unless it was Wednesday night which was when she went out to dinner with Rhodey or Friday Avengers and Family dinner night. And on those nights she usually fell asleep on Rhodey couch and ended up in the guest room by morning. Oh geez. “Wanda,” Laura persisted guiding her over to a seat and brushing her hair away from her face.
“He appeared to be having a nightmare earlier and woke up before getting sick. He is currently reacting,” she answered.
Wanda rolled her eyes and hugged him. Then she brushed past and started to talk to Loki. It was easy to talk to her and Loki sat with his gifted plant in his lap as they talked.
He meant it as a joke but Bucky answered: “I think Sam and Scott get pretty decent hours, but other than that not really.”
He did as she requested and then they went to breakfast together. “Well don’t you look like a pair,” Tony announced.
Loki ran out of the room. Sam left as well. He was not having this argument today. Loki didn’t leave his room for two days. Another week past and everyone was more settled with the idea. Steve, when he came out of his house, said it was like having a Cat that Sam took care of. “The muzzle,” Steve told them, “and the way that Loki’s eyes were dead and let himself be manhandled unlocked some pretty violent memories Bucky had been suppressing.”
Sam woke up to the smell of fried eggs and ham. He rolled off the couch and crept towards the kitchen. Natasha and Loki sat at the counter with Natasha silently doing Loki’s hair as music swelled into the air and they both had a look of peace on their faces. Sam knew that they knew he was there, but he leaned against the wall anyways and gave thanks that this was his life. It was horrible some days and the trauma came at levels the army hadn’t. But he had a ex Russian spy who snuck into his house in the morning to make breakfast and a small teenage demigod who made his house feel full, and that was good enough for him.
Sam watched Steve and Bucky kiss and made a gagging sound. Loki laughed and Steve flipped him off. “How was it while I was away,” Sam asked as he and Loki arrived in their house.
Janie stared and Sam watched her mind work. “But Vermont was the only state to legalize gay marriage before you got back and they wouldn’t let you get hitched overseas.”.
Peter giggled. Training with the Black Widow was intense. Kind of more intense when Hawkeye and The Falcon we’re watching as well. Peter had a great time and he couldn’t remember falling asleep so easily in such a long time.
Wanda giggled. Peter looked at her. “Speaking of college,” Tony announced, “there are three nearby that’s commutable from here. We’ll go see them after I drop Peter off at home tomorrow and after that, you can decide which one to attend. I’ve already got you accepted into all of them. We can look at MIT as well, but that’s a two-hour commute from here and it doesn’t match up nicely with your classes. I already have your credits transferred and classes lined up as best as possible.”
“Hi, Sam,” Peter answered skipping over to the counter and sitting on a stool dropping his backpack.
“That’s not really news kiddo. There are like three different sex tapes out there when where I’m with a guy.”
By lunch, they’ve moved on from flowers to gardens. Fruits and vegetables. Loki sat with Bucky at the table poking through an ordering manual. “You are not growing cucumbers Bucky,” Steve snarled throwing a discarded sketch at him.
The car stopped and the women climbed out. And the next thing Wanda was aware of was she was being introduced to two brunette women with sharp faces and kind eyes. The one she didn’t know was May Parker, Peter’s Aunt who felt fear for her nephew but not of her and Laura Barton who jumped to her feet when she saw Wanda and hugged the teen.
Loki nodded and ducked into the house, “don’t forget that the list of his triggers is in there and foods we’ve found out he can’t eat, and-“
Sam nodded. So all that was left was to wait. And wait they did. Tony eventually made his way over to Wanda and they started a game of go fish with Clint and Scott. Bucky had joined Sam on the couch and Natasha had squirmed her way between the two of them and Sam was obediently doing her nails.
Peter opened his mouth in an O shape and then snapped it shut before nodding. “Hey, Mr. Loki! How are you hanging? Fitting in? Doing? Getting Comfy?”
Tony pulled out his phone and hit play on a video. Peter and Ned were sitting on the carpet in the tower. Peter’s mask was on the ground and R5 was at their feet. A girl with thick curly black hair laid on the couch reading a book. Pepper walked into the room a long purple dress and black heels. She finished hooking an earring into her ear. “Ok I’ll be out for two hours,” she announced, “I have brunch with some members of the board. And Peter if I see your dirty clothes on the dining room floor again I will ground you.”
Scott and Clint continued down the hallway starting to bicker. Bucky got up and stepped over to Steve. He cupped the other man’s cheek and stroked it with his thumb. “Your numbers in my phone and on the fridge, I’ll text you tonight, send me blackmail pictures,” Bucky demanded.
Loki watched Sam look for an answer, Natasha nodded. “That’s right,” she agreed walking over to the window and opening it, “hey, wait for Sam.”
Sam and Loki went on a few more excursions outside of the neighborhood before Thanksgiving. Working their way up to large crowds. Three days before Thanksgiving Pepper took Loki out to see Mama Mia on Broadway and Loki came back shining. Pepper smiled softly as he slipped inside. “Taking him out more might do him some good,” she suggested.
Steve grumbled again. How had he missed this? He was the worst. Bucky kissed the top of his head. “This makes sense why I had to explain to him why you weren’t trying to kiss him and ignoring and brushing off the signs that he wanted to kiss you.”
He waved goodbye to the women at the shelter and followed the Temptress out the door. He held out his hand to her and she took it allowing him to teleport them to the Ranch House in the Neighborhood. The front door clicked open and Loki watched Sam run out.
Sam turned towards the golf carts. Loki paused at a window looking at his reflection. “You ok,” Sam asked.
Tony took out his phone and hit record. “Alright, kiddo go throw your Father the ball,” Tony ordered.
“I know,” Steve sighed with a smile as his body relaxed and he knew he was never going to live this down.
Two days later Natasha got back and Sam took her to his room and told her everything. “Thank you for sharing,” she stated when he finished.
She let out a sigh of relief and then went to lead Sam about the whole mess. Four days later Sam was in DC again looking at the shiny courthouses. Bucky was to his left glaring at them and Nat was at his right face timing Loki. Sam was very done with the whole process. It had taken them from their carefully constructed routine and Sam wasn’t sure if that was good for Loki. It definitely left him with less support, but Steve and his mother were there with him for now. And Sam was aware that it was ridiculous that he was concerned with someone babysitting his immortal teenage son, but what frickin' ever. Whatever. He was just tired, wanted his marriage license, and wanted to go home.
Then he watched Supernatural with Clint and then searched Supernatural on Tumblr and apparently Dean was a flaming bisexual and being only three seasons in Steve didn’t get any of that and had to google bisexual and that was like a punch to the gut. Which made him spiral into a google and Tumblr search of everything LGB and later when he figured it out T.
Tony laughed. Trust Peter to not realize he had called him Dad and not even realize it. “I’m going to go call Aunt May Dad” Peter announced and ran out of the room.
Loki and Sam at dinner and lunch at Steve and Bucky’s and went back home to watch a movie with the rest of the team. After the movie Loki let Sam undo his hair and brush it out again.
Tony felt ice freeze him. His lifelong hero and celebrity crush wanting to die? He couldn’t imagine it. He shook his head. “Well, I’m glad you’re alive.”
Ned jerks up and followed Mj out of the room. Helen gave Pepper her notes and they snuck off into one of the guest bedrooms. Clint kept watch as Natasha slept in her chair and everyone else continued on with their day. As much as they could. Natasha tried to extract more information from Clint about Mj but couldn’t.
“Don’t be sorry,” Clint told her firmly “you know I thought you and I would work up to this point one day. I just didn’t expect to be co-dading with Rhodey, but it’s good.”
Peter whooped and ran off. Peter came back with the gold cart. “So where is everyone else,” he heard Sam asked as he stopped the golf cart.
Spiderman started doing backflips at the request of someone below. Steve chuckled. “He’s very excitable isn’t he?”
Natasha followed after him. Loki looked at Wanda and Vision. The couple was leaning into each other without touching watching him with soft eyes. “Have you settled in here yet,” Wanda asked with a smile, “I know that when I got home it took me a couple months to get my act together.”
Loki felt a giggle rise into his chest. He let it out slowly, even though he was scared and unsure and scarred, but he always had been. And Sam had stayed. That was more than Thor had ever done. If Loki had wanted Thor to do something for him he had to manipulate him into doing it, but Loki in his tired and befuddled state had asked him to stay and he had.
Steve Rogers knew damn well who Spiderman was. He had found the kid. Of course, everyone thought that Tony had because he was a genius and had F.R.I.D.A.Y who could watch out for those kinds of things, but nope it had been Steve.
Peter looked confused before a moment before he gasped. “What! Not like that gross. I read one of his old time war letters to Bucky and realized that two dudes can love each other. Geez.”
After seeing Lo for the first time Sam’s mother had taken a great liking to him, and whenever Sam was on the phone with her she wanted to talk to Lo as well. In fact once she figured out that Loki was staying with him semi-permanently and that his family had left him she had started to treat him like a grandson. She only has granddaughters, but always wanted a grandson. Her brother had a few sons and she was jealous. Not that she didn’t love her granddaughters, but variation was good
Steve gave Tony the address and then said, “I’ guessing his parents are dead and he’s being raised by his Aunt May. His Uncle was the victim of a fatal mugging a year ago which is when the Spider-Man activity started so I’m guessing no one knows.”
Against popular belief, Tony could cook. In fact, he insisted on cooking family dinner on Saturday nights. Pepper and Rhodey said that Tony was in a much better place than he had been when he first became Iron Man and needed to be reminded to eat. Not that wasn’t still a problem but F.R.I.D.A.Y now reminded Tony and if he ignored her then Steve would go down to the lab to get him. Still, he could find Tony dancing around this kitchen making dinner.
The man stepped forward and shook his hand. “I’m Scott, Ant-Man,” he introduced cheerily “we fought at the airport!”
Wanda smiled and they talked until Rhodey showed up to usher Wanda off. Wanda rolled her eyes. “You’re such a Dad,” Wanda complained rolling to her feet.
At that Loki finally, finally reacted. Nails scrapped down Thor’s cheek. “You didn’t act that way when you chained me down and brought me here,” he screamed a sob tearing out of his throat, “you are a liar! I would have followed you willingly. You didn’t have to do this.”
Steve and Bucky had locked themselves in their house, blocking all entry. Apparently seeing Loki had triggered something about Bucky, but that was the only message that Steve had sent and he wasn’t communicating anymore. So everything was a question mark.
I hate you right now. I hate you so much. You hate my perfect teeth. Well, fuck you too. I want to put you on top of the list of people that I hate, but I can’t, because even though everything you’ve done sucks it’s nothing compared to other things that have happened to Bucky and I.
Shuri made a disgruntled noise and looked over at Tony. “Will you call Helen Cho, or do I need to organize my medical staff?”
Tony didn’t really think that was the truth, but they all settled down anyways. After a minute the cameras started rolling. The reporter gave them a kind smile. “Welcome to CNN,” he greeted, “I’m here today with the Avengers for their interview since the Accord split them apart. Right now we are joined by Tony Stark, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Iron Patriot, The Falcon, and Scarlet Witch. Later we will be joined by Captain America and the Winter Soldier.”
Bucky stopped talking and looked in the direction he was called. It was a small group of Tweens. “Where’s Hector?”
As soon as it was posted Tony got to his feet and walked over as Shuri pulled Peter into conversation. He hurriedly started to drag her towards the house. Okoye looked slightly alarmed and braced herself but she stayed put.
The three of them sneered, but somehow it was friendly. The way three people who had known each other for eternity looked at a new member.
They ducked into a car and Rylie’s mother hugged him. “So are you going to visit me more now,” she asked.
Loki’s eyes caught on Wanda and he leaned forward slightly. Sam got out of the car and waved the girl over. Her face lit up when she saw him. “Sam! What are you doing here?”
Darcy whined and Jane laughed packing away Sam’s fine China that Tony had rescued from his house in DC. Which was great because that had been his grandmother’s and she would kill him from the grave if the government confiscated it.
Fury grunted and stood up. Sam wondered what kind of power Mj had to make Fury listen to her. They said goodbye and left. Sam and Loki followed soon after. “Are you ok,” Sam asked as they arrived home.
Bucky, Steve, and Tony listened to Peter fondly, but they were distracted when Bucky’s phone rang. He answered it. “Why do I have to find out from American News and Twitter that you and Steve got engaged,” she demanded.
“Sam why does he speak in sentence fragments and verbs,” Tony demanded with a huff waving his hand around.
Tony got up and grabbed the newest version of the accords from where Sam left them. He handed them over to Steve. “They fixed the accords,” Tony explained.
Loki nodded. Sam got up pulled a piece of the sandwich off of it plopped it into his mouth and chewed it. “Do you want the door open or closed?” Sam asked as he left.
Scott gasped at the bear, before taking it and shaking Tony’s hand. “Thank you, Tony, for everything.”
Then he was tugging Steve out the door and Steve waved goodbye. Clint shoved them into one of the cars and suddenly they were at a restaurant.
The words hurt to say and the understanding and anger that came across his families’ faces told him he wasn’t alone. “Of course,” Gideon agreed, “anything else?”
Peter waved his hand at him. “Yeah But Cap is the bisexual to end like all bisexuals. Mj has made Ned and I read three books about it and it’s totally confirmed now which is amazing. You have no idea how many trashy books I read when I was younger because Cap is bi as hell and was part of my sexual awakening.”
Tony sighed. “As in a sense that it’s an accident that suck, yeah it’s the niece thing. I guess Rhodey and Barton are really good at picking up strays.”
He looked down at the smaller boy and found Peter curled into sleep at his side. “House Temptress please tell Sam that Stark’s small son is sleeping next to me and I have not hurt him.”
We’re all fine, everyone misses you. I’m resending the names and numbers of those therapists I was talking about earlier. Here’s a picture I took today of everyone.
“I’m ignoring you”, Natasha declared and Sam laughed, “you two head to the living room I’ll get the pie.”
Wanda watched Happy punch the professor. “What the hell,” Happy muttered shaking out his hand, “what kind of creep starts to tell a girl how sexy her brain would be on an operating table. Fucking sicko.”
“You’re Tony’s son hence my Nephew,” Rhodey answered and plopped the gift bag into his lap sitting next to him on the couch.
“He knows that Odin is dead and you handed him away to his enemies,” Bucky interrupted, “he knows that’s what Odin told him you would do. He thinks you’re following in your father’s footsteps, dressing him up in a spell, a muzzle, chains, and a damn book to control him so you can whore him out. So you can use him and dispose of him as needed. All those skills he learned lying and tricking and stealing and pleasuring men for your use to gain power and territory.”
Loki followed silently. Sam cooked in silence while Loki laid on the couch half-watching him half reading. Sam didn’t bother to say much. They ate in silence and after dinner, Loki slipped back to his room.
She appeared to be in her twenties. Loki grew in stature until he looked about the same. He picked up the children. “You should not have brought them here,” he warned.
Sam took in a deep breath. “Technically when I was in the Air Force I did something that wasn’t entirely legal nationwide.”
Sam nodded. Tony was not the only one shocked by Loki’s change of appearance, but he was the only one to point it out.
She gently tugged him away. Everyone followed. Natasha almost felt bad for Thor the confusion and desperation that was clear on his features, but she didn’t have time to pity him, she had a child with Sam who needed her to keep him safe from his past and his own mind. So Natasha had no pity. She had only rage that the older brother had refused to see how broken the younger was.
Tony nodded and waved the other man out. As soon as he was gone Rhodey moved his hand from Peter’s mouth and pulled the boy into his arms. “The Rouge Avengers have been officially pardoned, and are allowed to return to the states. They’re not all coming back at once, but they are returning. Your father is a nervous wreck,” he muttered.
“And it’s pretty damn clear that Loki has some problems of his own. Get your heads out of your asses.”
Loki looked away. “We’ll talk more about that tomorrow,” Sam answered, “you should go back to sleep.”
Steve set his book down with a frown and squinted his eyes at Bucky. “Bucky we don’t have an anniversary.”
So he put on smooth jazz if Natasha came over and they would dance quietly in the kitchen swaying to the music. New pop songs and old lindy hop if Steve and Bucky stopped by, so Bucky could dance or sing along if he wanted to.
Sam rubbed his eyes again. “I have West Side Story on DVD we can watch that after breakfast,” he offered, “Bucky gave me Hair Spray as well. So we got some options. If you like that well enough I’ll get Tony to get us some of the other ones and Peter can find bootlegs.”
Scott shrugged. “Kids need a loving stable environment with their entire family giving them support. She has plenty here, but from what I get neither of you got closure with each other in general and while her perception of you has been turned on its head she’s being forced to realize that she wants something different and that makes her moody and scared. And I love this kid as a little sister, so you fix your mess with Steve so that you can fix your mess with her.”
He watched Tony tinker with the red and blue suit. “I really do think this kid is meant to be ours,” Tony hummed, “blue and red. I’m red obviously.”
Sam fused slightly glaring at the pale walls, Somehow it wasn't enough. Loki deserved more. “I miss the days were my biggest concerns were war veterans,” he grumbled.
Loki listened patiently as the House Temptress explain what had happened. “They were made from the Mind Stone,” Loki noted and then paled, but sat perfectly still as Natasha braided his hair “how Wanda alive? Trying to do something like that should have killed them.”
Tony drove for a while and they talk about nothing in particular. When they get arrived they were greeted to the sight of a small little house and a white picket fence. “Fuck you Stark,” Steve announced while Bucky’s breath hitched.
He smiled. “You don’t ever have to call us anything, but we’re happy to be your parents as long as you want us in your life.”
The door slid open and Princess Shuri the most intelligent person in the world swept in. Sam flinched. It was very hard to dislike Shuri. Besides intelligent, she was kind and funny, if not a bit brutal. Though Sam wasn’t keen on her getting in the middle of one of the super soldier's fights.
Polyamory wasn’t a big deal to Steve. After he had fallen in love with Peggy, Bucky had kind of fallen for her as well, so they had been a triad. It was strange not knowing he was part of a triad, but he supposed he really should have known. “Best tactile mind of his generation,” Tony snorted.
They settled into easy conversation. At dinner, Shuri met Rhodey and scoffed at his mechanical legs. “We’ll fix this,” she announced, “it’ll be insulting if I don’t.”
The door clicked open and Peter squeaked. Tony walked in. “Whoops,” Peter said as Tony’s eyes drifted over to the letters.
Vision caught her as she fell. Loki felt himself stumble and Sam grabbed him helping him keep on his feet.
Loki shook as Sam picked up the glass and bowl. “Still hungry,” he asked filling up the water again.
Tony let Bucky’s words drift into silence and then sighed. “I don’t know what he would have even told me. Oh hey, my old boyfriend who I had thought was dead but is actually made into a weapon and brainwashed by Hydra killed your parents. Sorry?”
Shit indeed. Sam composed himself. If he had known that Loki was a child he would have done things differently, but there was no time to dwell on that.
He dropped the stack of papers in front of Tony. Tony looked at the stack. “Is this... Is this the accords?”
Loki couldn’t even defend himself now, but when the spell was gone it would be different. Seeing as it wasn’t Sam figured he could sooth that worry. Sam knew that Loki resented not being able to fight, he would feel the same way.
Eventually, the other man fell back asleep. Sam put him back in bed and cleaned up the bathroom before going back to his bed.
“How do I lose a lookalike contest when I’m the only non look alike,” Tony complained sitting on a chair watching Natasha pull a chalkboard out from behind a wall and add a new column to it giving it a mark.
Bruce Banner walked in and rolled his own eyes. “Tony stop whining, you don’t need to ruin your body even more. It’s for your own health. And stop calling me Banner, it sounds ridiculous coming from you.”
Steve turned as Bucky walked into the room. He stopped. “Who are they and how did they get in here,” Bucky demanded his hands going for one of his guns.
Truth. Despite the closeness of the Compound, it wasn’t personal. “Everyone has a house here,” Tony announced, “well except Cap and his boy toy, I didn’t think they would ever want to be apart. And everyone has their own room in the main house. That’s where Peter, Pepper, and I will live. Peter has a house here to when he’s ready to leave and you do of course, but I was thinking you should stay in the Big House until more of the others arrive if that’s ok.”
Wanda sat on her bed staring at the ceiling. The wooden rafters that Vision liked to sit in were empty. Vision surprisingly had a roaming soul. He said that if he wanted to understand humanity then trying to understand creatures who weren’t entirely human was not going to help him, it would only explain the outliers. So Wanda had told him to go and discover the world for them because she wanted to see it too. She couldn’t though. Right now she craved stability and while living here in France offered some running from the consequences of their fight wasn’t right. Everyone home that’s safe and happy has stability.
Tony gapped. Bucky chuckled softly. “Sounds rough, I know. It kind of was. But that’s also Steve. He doesn’t really tell people things. It doesn’t matter what it is, but if you don’t ask about it or it’s not important at the moment he won’t ever bring it up. It doesn’t occur to him. When I showed up to the funeral he just looked at me and ‘said hi Buck’ like he had no idea he never told me anything.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes and hung up. Tony joined Pepper on the bed and pulled her into his arms. “Steve should have been here,” Pepper whispered, “not me.”
Loki downcast his eyes. “Well by Midgardian biology I suppose not, but on Asgard, I would be,” he responded, “intergalactic laws function by age equivalents by species when visiting other planets.”
Steve trailed off and he gave Sam a shrug. “Just make sure your all on the same page,” Sam suggested.
Loki shook his head no. Definitely not. He was hoping to keep the broth down. “Alright,” Sam said handing over the glass full of water. “I’m going to make a snack, you can stay or go.”
Steve shrugged. “He’s alive,” Steve answered, “I’m responsible for him. He’s still my best fella. I’ll search forever for him if I have to, but if he was killed,” Steve choked, “or brought back to Hydra I couldn’t live. Tony, I put that plane in the water to join him.”
Still, Bucky clung to him. They touched, cuddled, occasionally kissing on the top of the head or hands a careless gesture. And they had started out in separate rooms. They really did and that lasted about a week. In their defense...well there wasn’t much to defend. They both had terrible nightmares that kept them up but felt better if the other one was there. And they got separation anxiety. So it wasn’t really a surprise when neither of them managed to stay by themselves the whole night and joined the other.
Loki pinched him and Tony danced out of reach. “Come on,” Tony whined “I’m only teasing. Now go get ready.”
Sam felt a shot of excitement go up his spine. Despite the frown, Loki looked entertained and curious. Sam had Friday pull up dance videos to watch while they ate. Natasha and Sam answered Loki’s questions as best as they could. Natasha knew a lot about dance from her ballet background, but Loki apparently knew more. So they spent the morning in front of Sam’s tv watching dance shows and documentaries while Loki swayed across the living room his long and graceful limbs picking up the moves.
She arrived on a Thursday so Peter wasn’t at the Neighborhood when she arrived which sucked, but she was also a little scary which made Peter nervous.
“It’s about time you’re happy. You haven’t been well and truly been happy since we’ve known you and it’s good to hear that now.”
She stuck her tongue out. Tony took a moment to look at her. She seemed so old now. Like she had grown up more while she had been away if that was possible. Their relationship was weird. Extremely painful in the beginning. Especially since she had blamed him for killing her parents, but she had also been brainwashed by Hydra so he didn’t really blame her. They got over that though. He figured if she got over that then he could get over Bucky. Besides that Tony had tried to be a parent like figure to Wanda, but she had been so grown already so used to surviving with only her brother that any attempts felt awkward. He had tried protecting her in all the wrong ways. It was why he had pushed Peter away without Steve around to help.
Bucky regretted speaking immediately when their wide eyes snapped to him. He heard Sam sick in a deep breath. Without warning, Rhodey started to laugh loud and boisterous, and Pepper giggled. “Oh,” she exclaimed, “tell Natasha that the next time we go out to get our nails done we are bringing you with us.”
And Steve spoke highly of James Rhodes and Pepper Potts. And if Steve spoke highly of Pepper Potts then Natalia just gushed about her, well gushed in the Natalia way of course. He didn’t want to seem like he was trying to scare the other James and he wanted to make a good impression on Pepper. Well, the whole assassin killing Tony’s parents, with all those letters wasn’t a great start, but damn he had some manners at least.
Thor laughed. “You are in very good hands then. If you ever wish to return Asgard opens its arms to you.”
“Well, he quit band. So there’s that,” Steve answered setting his shield down and dropping himself over the couch.
“Do you do structural refracturing?” Tony asked a few moments later when the children stopped for breath.
Loki flinched. “I’m sorry Master,” Loki cried out his forehead bobbing to the floor with a rough sob “I’ll be better, I’ll be better. I promise! I promise! Please, Master.”
Steve hushed him and kept his attention on the News. "Several of these Tweets suggest that the pair is living together in a house that Tony Stark built for them. However, this has caused some controversy as some ecstatic illiterate people are suggesting that the pair is sexually involved. This grotesque and inappropriate assumption has caused massive fights to break out on Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter-“
I knew bringing Peter was a mistake, he’s not like Wanda. He’s still too young, even if she is as well. Take care of our girl and make sure she blossoms. And I’d tell you to give my apologies to Natasha, but I’m sure she already knows that I was pushing her away because I was scared and that I’m sorry, but that’s a conversation I’ll have with her one day.
After dinner is finished and they were washing dishes F.R.I.D.A.Y alerted them to unexpected visitors.
Tony didn’t ask him how he had done it. Rhodey was a genius after all. “And you think they’ll sign this?”
Steve nodded like he understood. “When I meet Peggy, Bucky he said I should be with the both of them. He gave that up for me.” he confessed his eyes tearing up.
After dinner, Natasha announced that Steve said that they were staying with relatives. Which was interesting, because the last anyone knew Steve hadn't even had living family members when he went off to war. So who in hell were they staying with? She also added that the pair suspected they would get a late start tomorrow morning. Which might be a problem since the Avengers had their first interview since they disbanded the next day. The interview that Bucky and Steve had set up themselves mind you.
Tony groaned. “God bless America,” he exclaimed, “Do you kiss babies on the weekend? You know if you ran for mayor you’d probably win.”
That made ten words today, Sam noted. Shuri smiled and shook her head. “The cool part,” she repeated holding out a pen-like object, “is that this Steve can use this to draw on your arm.”
Bruce gave Natasha a long-suffering look. “I’m going back to my lab, don’t let Tony have any more coffee.”
He didn’t think Bucky would hurt him. Bucky let him help him with his flowers and they were pretty flowers. People who like to hurt others didn’t let the people they were going to hurt take care of their flowers.
It all but confirmed that Loki at one point had been some kind of sex slave at one point. Sam felt his stomach turn. “Loki,” Clint breathed.
Loki was not hurt, he had known he didn’t have Thor’s trust but he needed to hear it. He nodded. “If you had asked me, I would have followed you.”
Loki sighed. “When I worked up the courage to tell him I showed him the earnings first and before I could explain he asked me which poor women I had stolen them from and if it was my tongue or my fingers that persuaded her,” Loki answered the innuendos dripped from the words, “and before I could deter him from that path he laughed at me and told me that he was glad I was not a woman or I would seduce men from their fortunes and wives and then take on other diplomats with my pretty lips. When he finished laughing I stabbed him and I wouldn’t speak to him for three years. But I don’t think you’ll have that problem. I hope your mother cries.”
Natasha had assured Steve that Tony flirted shamelessly with everyone he met. Tony flirted a lot though.
Tony felt like he should be offended. He was known for his wit! But between wit and his apparent big heart, Bucky had noticed the other. He was about to make a quick response, but they had already reached the plane and Bucky was gone and Tony hadn’t realized it.
Bucky and Steve arrive at the Neighborhood and they are both Trolls. Shuri is the greatest and everyone agrees.
Tony set the Vodka back down. She sniffed them gently and handed them over for Bucky to hold. “I’m sorry to have left you so easily,” she told him.
Shuri tossed him the pen and kept with her update. Steve sat beside Bucky and stroked his shoulder where metal met skin. Bucky let out a soft sigh and without warming the metal melted into skin. Sam could have sworn, if he didn’t know any better, that the arm was real and not metal. The hologram stayed in place even as Steve ran his fingers down to Bucky’s hand. “Try it,” Shuri demanded to Steve.
The air around Loki flashed white and suddenly he was a bit smaller, just as lanky, but wirier. Sam locked his jaw as Loki’s face softened, but his cheeks were hollow from hunger, and eyes baggy. A proper seventeen-year-old. Sam finished cooking as Natasha brushed and braided Loki’s hair.
Steve nodded and took the sleeping boy. Tony leaned against the wall across from Loki. Tony seemed conflicted about something. “Peter is the person you die and kill for,” Loki answered.
“Oh my gosh you’re the Big-Small dude,” Peter started to bounce up and down, “you stole Captain America’s shield from me and then you got really really big. How did you do that? What technology was that? That’s not one of Stark Industries inventions.”
“Oh,” Natasha asked and opened the folder, “oh,” she agreed and then reached over and squeezed his hand her eyes burning with fury, “I’ll start gathering my contacts.”
Wanda stood to Tony’s other side. The helicarrier landed. Wanda squealed as Sam popped his head out, but wait patiently. Sam went right to her and Peter watched with amazement as The Falcon spun Scarlet Witch around like they had grown up together. Ned would be so jealous.
Sam tended to agree. The “Kiss The Cook” was tacky not to mention it was in bright red black lettering surrounded by hearts.
Then she felt Tony’s mind. Nervous and scared, buzzing, and hopeful. Wanda squinted until she saw him. Their eyes connected and Wanda felt an overwhelming wave of love come off of him. She dropped her bag and ran straight into his arms.
She took a strawberry and floated a pawn forward on the board. Peter made happily delighted sounds and Wanda relaxed into the tornado that was Peter Parker. After Wanda beat him at chess and they finished breakfast they went around the house searching for things to poke at. It was a good morning. They ended back in the kitchen at lunch. “Alright,” Pepper announces walking into the room, “I have my evening cleared. Wanda are you ready to go out?”
“Ok, but Wanda is like that one sad cat sitting out your bedroom window in the rain begging to be let in, so you let her in, but if you get to close she freaks out and runs away and then every time it rains again your worried about her and feel like a terrible person, so when she comes back you feel like the best person ever, and you try not to scare her anymore,” Peter put in.
“Technically, but he puts Red Bull and monster energy drink in it and that’s poison enough,” Rhodey answered.
And of course Tumblr was broken and Reddit for that matter. The press was having a field day and Steve had fourteen texts from Pepper about the whole press disaster. Steve found the remote to the tv and they turned it on snuggling in bed.
Tony shrugged. The others signed and Tony felt relief course through his body. “How long until your plane takes off,” Natasha asked, “I can pull out one of the extra beds for you.”
It was an easy joyful sight. Bucky tapped his screen taking another photo of them. “How did you get so addicted to Twitter,” Tony asked.
Steve: Bucky has him. I tuned them out when they started arguing about eggplants. I’ve been hanging out with Peter too much.
“So your not going to explain why you know Mj,” Wanda asked, “I mean I know her through Peter, but I don’t see why you would.”
Sam’s eyes widened but Bucky didn’t give a shit about the accords so whatever. Rhodey sighed and rubbed his face. “Last time we talked about this we were all talking and not listening and we got dragged into too many complicated things” he stated “I saw Steve reading the draft, but it didn’t occur to me that he was objecting for other reasons besides his stubbornness and then we never got to have a second conversation until it was too late. Well, we’re going to start having that conversation right now. You and me Sam.”
The picture was of Sam on one knee looking up at a white man blond man who was crying. Loki noticed the small ring in his hand. That didn’t make sense. No one had announced that Sam was married? Not even Bucky’s map had mentioned that.
Peter grabbed his bag and scrambled after her. “Wait you’re going to be training me,” Peter squeaked.
Sam should have known his mother would do this with his siblings at her heels. “Sarah is making calls at home now,” Mom told him, “the whole community is up in arms. I’m sorry to tell everyone baby, but once you said something at Thanksgiving to the family that secret was gone and you better know that.
Before Loki could reply Sam arrived setting a different plate in front of him and taking the plate he had prepared himself away. “Loki,” Sam sighed sitting down, “why did you grab a plate full of meat?”
The next day was Avengers Thanksgiving. Sam spends the day in the compound kitchen with Tony and Darcy cooking. Loki was with Wanda and Peter getting a tour of the city. It made Sam nervous, but they’ll be alright. And they were. Wanda, Peter, and Loki came home safely and laughing, and everyone let out a sigh of relief. At dinner, they sat around together as a family Happy is included sitting between Pepper and Wanda. They don’t pray because most of them have given up on any god out there or never believed in the first place. But Steve gives a speech and some of them cry because really Cap should probably be getting a public speaking degree or something.
Steve had never shown any interest in anything like that before. Wanda shrugged. “Well, he took me there to get registered and kinda got sucked in.”
Tony lead Rodey to the lab and Pepper sat with the letters. She got them framed and they hung in Tony’s office.
A couple of months went by and Peter was running around the compound after training. Vision was currently in town which was so cool! But his Dad, Uncle James (that was so cool by the way), and Vision were having an adult meeting and he wasn’t allowed in so he was exploring. “Hey F.R.I.D.A.Y Where is my Dad’s office,” he asked.
Loki shrugged. “Is there a difference? And if there is a difference does it matter? I’ve never been anything more than pretty illusions, and lies, and tricks.”
“How often were you around him growing up, would you have listened to him? No,” Natasha spat, “that is a conversation you need to have with him one day. Today you are staying away from him.”
Bucky stuck his tongue out which started a fight between the two men. Not an actual fight, but the play wrestle two brothers often found themselves in and Tony found himself shocked. Eventually, they split apart smiling.
Clint did like some country, but Sam played techno music for him because of the loud bass. Clint had great hearing aids, but he didn’t always wear them.
Sam shoved his family out of the building. When he returned to the VA Sam was still smiling. “Well Sam all you need is something pretty to lay down next to at night,” Alex said as he walked in, “and then you got it all.”
Loki both understood and didn’t. “I don’t know how this fits into grammar,” Loki said a half an hour later, “but I do not mind.”
Clint and Rhodey waisted patiently watching the panic spread across her face. “Wait! No,” she exclaimed, “that was an accident. I totally didn’t mean that. I’m so sorry!”
“I’ll send what he had figured out over, but it’s barely a skeleton, Steve doesn’t know what Peter’s fully capable of so he couldn’t get a full schedule done,” Sam answered.
The robot indeed gave him a fist bump and Peter said pumped his fist into the air and both Peter and the robot started to dance. “I’m impressed,” Tony commented.
Thor grabbed the chains at his feet and snapped them. Loki flinched and then his muzzle appeared. “You are a free man Loki,” Thor added and crushed the piece of metal.
“Until Steve arrives,” Natasha answered biting her lip, “he knows better than I do. I learned a bit unconventionally.”
Tony was overwhelmed, Peter brought him so much joy and confusion, but there was also an empty part in his heart. Steve should be here and not running some bar. But that was their fault and here were the consequences.
Sam walked away and into the kitchen to clean up from lunch. Natasha waltzed in thirty minutes later. She picked up the hand towel and started to dry. They were silent for a few minutes. “I left him in the living room watching hip-hop,” Natasha informed him.
Bucky buried his face into Steve’s neck flinching. Steve gripped Bucky’s hands and looked over at Loki. “Take the muzzle off,” he demanded.
Ned broke down into hysterical laughter and Mj justed flipped Clint off. At noon after Sam brought in some sandwiches a screen popped up stating it was a call from Tony. Mj hit accept. “I think I should come back,” Tony announced.
That answer was no. Loki was as good as in a coma his skin growing more and more blue and his temperature rising. They finally sent a message to Thor. Loki is sick, help. But they didn’t know when Thor would get it and if he was able to come back. So they tried things and waited.
Sam didn’t press Loki further. When Sam finished he set the brush on the nightstand. “Thank you,” Loki whispers.
Loki nodded. Sam pulled his arms around Natasha and Loki pulling them into his lap and against his chest. Natasha started to sing baa baa black sheep and Sam sang along. The song didn’t matter. The soft repetition did. Eventually, Loki cried himself to sleep. Natasha slipped away. “Go lay on the couch with him,” she ordered, “I’ll be back in a minute.”
They ate pie and once that was done Peter helped Sam wash the dishes. “So do you have your suit with you,” Natasha asked.
Loki went flying again and the sound of gunshots went off. Loki twisted in the air and flipped as best as he could, he knew that the wizard had opened his teleporters and sent them flying at Loki’s they shot into his back as he landed. Loki felt himself lose balance so he rolled with the impact getting to his feet again. “You think a few bullets are going to kill me,” he spat.
“Murdering someone's children is a little more than fucked up,” Rhodey snarled, “but what Loki said was very different. No wonder the guy has a few screws loose.”
He poured another cup and eyed Loki. Loki wanted to shrink back, but Natasha was still braiding so Loki fought off the impulse. “Good Morning Lo.”
Tony groaned loudly and Fury laughed while Peter continued to whine. But that broke Fury’s hold over everyone and they sat around for another couple of hours. Mj had her feet in Peter’s lap watching Fury and Loki and once everyone was semi-relaxed she cleared her throat.
“I walked into the apartment, the apartment I lived into, and you threw a knife at me,” Sam pointed out.
He sat with Steve as Steve painted and they talked about everything but the broken boy in Bucky’s garden. The painting when it was finished was of a garden with two dark blurry silhouettes walking through it, one large and bulky and the other tall and lanky. Steve titled it “Brokenness Takes A Walk Towards Healing.” Steve flicked some paint at Sam who protested a bit too loudly.
Loki felt his breath hitch. He hated that. Hated when his captors acted kind and then took him places to be tortured afterward. Still, Loki obeyed and followed Sam away. They left the house. Loki blinked at the light. It was a lovely place. Sam lead him into a garden and sat on a bench. “Tony built this part because I told him that meditation garden helps with psychological healing. I’m going to sit here for a while. You can walk around if you want.”
Sam rolled his eyes. Then Bucky walked in with grocery bags. Steve and Sam froze for a second. “Thanks for getting milk Buck,” Steve answered after a long moment.
Bucky rolled his eyes at him and climbed up onto the bed. “What,” he asked confused, “not yours and my anniversary Steve. Our anniversary with Tony.”
Sam tried not to feel sick that Loki was basically talking about sex slaves. And Sam knew enough to read the implication that Loki had been one at some point. “Well, I suppose you have some of that in Earth’s history,” Sam answered, “but it’s of considered legal now. I don’t know how it works in space, but on Earth, there are now places that let two people of the same sex get married if they want. Bucky and Steve have been in love for a very long time.”
Tony gave him a sympathetic look. “Don’t worry about it. You’ll find your hubby and if you don’t you can be mine!”
Loki’s eyes glanced up as two children barreled into the room. There was a small dark-haired girl and a darker haired boy with wolf ears. He smiled at them opening his arms. Those at the table scoffed.
Bucky and Loki talked about power arrangements until Sam walked in. “Hey,” he greeted, “dinner is ready.”
Loki snorted. “I had to call Jane and Darcy,” Bruce announced, “they are the only ones on Earth who have any idea about alien biology. I didn’t want to touch your skull without being aware. I think they are on their way here. It looked like Darcy spilled coffee on the computer and phone so who knows.”
“I’d like to see Africa,” Bucky hummed, “Shuri keeps sending me lists of places in Africa to go and Nakia keeps telling me not to fuck up her missions in response.”
Steve smiled at Tony and Tony smiled back. They spent the rest of the night watching YouTube videos of Spiderman thinking about how to help the young hero.
It was awful because he was supposed to be charming and suave, but he just didn’t have it in him anymore. Why would he? All his work to make sure Thor wouldn’t turn out like Odin had failed. Sam ruffled his hair, and for some reason, Loki felt better.
Loki slid from his spot on the couch over to Sam looking over his shoulder at the pamphlets. Sam passed them over letting Loki read through them. “They’ll teach me your Midgardian dances,” Loki asked after a long pause.
She got up, but Clint tugged her back down on the couch and tears burst down her cheeks. He hugged her tight as she let out sob after painful sob. Rhodey wrapped his arms around her as well. When she finally cried herself out Rhodey meet her eyes. “You’ve been doing this for months Baby Girl,” he announced.
Eventually, they pulled back and Steve was blushing. “God that was hot,” Tony breathed, “though you don’t taste like Doritos.”
Loki looked at Sam again. Exhaustion and sleep poured off the man. A grey sleeping shirt. Sam was kind and did not want to hurt him. Sam was helpful. Loki shuffled into the room. “Do you want to talk about it,” Sam asked.
“You shouldn’t be talking about proper English when you look like your seventeen Mr. Loki,” Peter answered.
Wanda froze. Clint didn’t even blink. “Geez, it’s like you can’t secretly adopt a kid anymore. Rhodey Bear I can’t believe this! It’s like two grown ass men can’t adopt a child together before people throw a fit about it.”
“And you’re the blue,” Stark went on waving some tool Steve didn’t know the name of, “he has my stunning good looks.”
Scott was still babbling, but Tony only started to pay attention as soon as Wanda came out of his lips. “Wanda is getting all teenage angst like Bucky.”
It wasn’t until they had gotten back to the Neighborhood that either of them remembered that he had called her his Niece. And they only remembered because Pepper handed her a card that said To the Best Niece Ever and showed them the news channel clips of people trying to figure out how the pair was related. “Shit,” Tony swore.
Natasha had no idea what to make of that. “Well, I’m just going to say this for everyone. What the hell was all that,” Sam asked walking in.
Fifteen minutes later Tony was dying of boredom and Bucky walked in. He was carrying two different mugs. He slipped behind the bar and set the coffees down in front of them. It was eerie how he had managed to make it silent. He leaned down under the bar and pulled up a tub putting it in front of Tony.
Loki looked at the blanket in his lap with confusion and then over to Bucky with admiration. He pulled the blanket up to his chin. Rhodey flipped on the movie. Loki was enamored by the movie. Sam felt proud by his choice of “Because Of Winn Dixie”. Loki laughed and cried at all the right parts which helped the rest of the team relax.
Afghanistan was rough. We got sent back stateside a couple of times. The last one we ended up in Vermont. It was legal for us to get married there so I dragged Rylie to the nearest damn church and we got married before the eyes of god and the law. When we got back everyone ignored the gold rings on our fingers and didn’t say one damn thing about the paperwork. Then we went back. Only suppose to be for a few months until we got released for good. Rylie and I kept dreaming of getting our heads back on and starting a family.
“Magic is different from science because science is measurable and exact and unchanging. Magic has a mind of its own and changes depending on the relationship of the user and wielder. Everyone is capable of wielding magic through careful study, but there are those of us who are born with true magic. Magic that wiggles and waves and becomes a part of us just as much as our bodies.”
She left. Sam went to his room and carefully put the rings into a box and went out to meet Loki. He was sitting in their golf cart his bag gently placed on his lap looking at the map they had made of all of Sam’s family members. “Remember what I said,” Sam started.
Sam took in a deep breath. “A mother should know if her son is married,” he answered, “and I should have told her long ago.”
A couple of months ago Tony would have never mentioned Bruce Banner, even so offhandedly, but lately and thanks to therapy he was loosening up a little. “What about Uncle Rhodey,” Peter demanded.
Peter gasped as The Black Widow stopped next to him. “Uh, Yes? No? Is this a test? Oh my god,” Peter exclaimed and thrust out the present towards her like a crucifix.
She flipped through the pages and suddenly a hologram popped up. A young dark-haired boy went flying across the scene and a large blond man walked after him. “Say it,” he demanded.
Sam knew that Bucky would be shipping out another letter tonight. It usually went something like this, Bucky would watch Steve write an angry letter to Tony and then Bucky would drag Sam to one of Wakanda’s fancy libraries to write an angrier letter and make Sam read it, which Sam usual agreeing with both and not wanting to upset Tony more wrote a quick note to Tony and then Bucky would drag Sam down to the post office so he could ship both letters, Steve’s, and Bucky and Sam’s to Tony, which Sam wasn’t sure if it was a good idea or not. They did it anyway, and really Bucky writing Tony letters was the most expressive he got and Steve was being honest, and Tony had missed that so maybe it was good for all of them. God Sam hoped it was good for all of them.
The video repeated for the twentieth time. Sam now understood his Sister’s half dead expression when his niece demanded to watch the same episode of Blue's Clues again.
The three other men turned and looked at him. “What did you think we were staying,” Steve teased rolling his eyes.
“Well, I have who knows how many properties I could live on,” Tony responded, “if he wants another place to crash who am I to blame him?”
“I haven’t seen my true face in a hundred years,” Loki admitted, “as a shapeshifter, it is expected of me to live between my forms. I abandoned this one in the hopes that the loss of boyish charms would chase away desire”
Wanda paused. Did she really have that much clothes here? Laura looked at her. “Wanda, are you alright?”
“He agreed,” Natasha repeated giving him a patient look, “he still thinks you’ll hurt him, but I don’t think he doesn’t think that about anyone. His brain is a mess. He likes you through, thinks you are kind. He wants to trust you which I suppose is why he’s agreed.”
“Loki,” Natasha exclaimed kneeling down next to him, “Loki I need you to look at me,” she ordered as she waved Tony and Clint out of Loki’s line of sight, “please.”
Bucky sighed happily and stroked his fingers through Steve’s hair. Peter plopped down next to Tony. “You did real good,” Steve told him.
His mother was silent waiting to see if he would continue and when he didn’t she pushed. “To who Baby? How is that illegal?”
The door to the elevator popped open to the sound of whirring gears and James Rhodes stepped out with a backpack slung across his shoulder and a gift bag in his hand.
When he woke up and the shower was running. Loki looked towards the closed door in the room. Then he looked over at the room. It was mostly neat and organized, but overall pleasant. Loki rolled over and saw a picture on the nightstand.
There was an awkward silence. Dummy brought over a milkshake and handed it to Steve. “Thank you,” he told the robot.
Natasha came in before anyone could say anything else. “There you are,” she exclaimed, “let’s get breakfast Lo and I’ll tell you the plans for today!”
Loki looked down at his outfit as if considering it. He said nothing, however. Like Sam promised they watched West Side Story and Hair Spray which Loki took great delight in. Not only because it was theater
“Geez passed out right after supper,” Rhodey sighed, “you’d think all we did was watch Lord of the Rings today.”
“Well, the Tower obviously didn’t work. Not enough privacy, to close together. This has worked out a lot better so far,” Tony babbled.
The next day was a bad day. So bad in fact that Sam had to leave the apartment. Which means that Bucky is polishing his knife collection, only talking in Russian, and is just staring at Steve. Which could easily mean he’s trying to remember why he hasn’t killed Steve yet or planning on killing anyone who even looks at Steve. Which means that Sam has to leave and the building goes on lockdown.
Bruce shrugged. “Well not really any different from when we first saw him. Cunning and self-serving. But on the ship, after we left the ruins of Asgard it was different. Loki he spent time with the doctors using his magic to heal injuries, and he made sure that the mothers and the elders were taken care of. Anything to get away from the warriors who kept picking fights with him. He avoided Thor when Thor was talking to their warriors, and when he wasn’t he seemed very content. Until we got close to Earth. Then Thor brought out a bag and Loki just froze his eyes going wide. And he kept froze as Thor told him the plan and he didn’t react until Thor pulled out the chains apologizing, and from there he lost it. He took out seventeen guards had Thor in a death hold with his knife ready to stab him, but he dropped it like it was hot coal and turned on the guards still charging him. When they finally got him down he just kept screaming that Thor was betraying him and that he was no better than Odin. It seemed to upset Thor who was confused, but he chalked it up to Loki not wanting to see the Avengers again and I thought he was right, and Loki’s been like that since the muzzle got on.”
Sam relaxed into his friend’s arms. An hour later Bucky nudged Sam awake. “We’re home,” he announced.
Tony and Steve made it their joint mission to help out Spiderman- Aka Peter Parker- AKA the most precious child to have ever existed according to Tony. Who had decided to make a new suit for the kid after they determined that the kid was just wearing a costume and had zero protection.
Bucky’s lips pursed, “Jesus. F.R.I.D.A.Y remind me to buy Natasha and Sam some fruit baskets or some shit.”
Tony turned the tv onto the news channel and saw his new plane up in flames on a beach. He swore. “Boss,” Happy grumbled, “I’m pretty sure the security cameras are showing Spiderman on the plane fighting some bird guy.”
“Now for the cool stuff,” Peter exclaimed and he dropped a few stones in front of the robot,“R5 can you give Ned a blue rock please?”
Sam was out of bed grabbing his robe and running out of the room before she had finished. Sam found Loki throwing up over the toilet bowl. He pulled the other man’s hair back. Loki tensed, but he was too sick to fight him off. Sam held his hair and rubbed small circles into his back saying soothing words.
When he finished his mother hugged and kissed him again. “Alright,” he said, “I have a kid to go check on.”
Sam rubbed his face and stretched out on the couch. Loki climbed to his feet moving his body in a few slow motions. Then he popped his body the same way the dancers had.
Cho ran her hand over the boy’s forehead. “Let’s get him to my lab,” she ordered, “I need to take a scan on his biological components. I don’t want to try anything until I have a better grasp of what’s going on.”
Rhodey kept her pressed to his side. “Don’t apologize,” Rhodey told her, “that was rough and we all have some damage. I think we need ice cream. Happy what place can we get ice cream at this godforsaken hour?”
“I didn’t realize the emotion that could be added by changing the angle at which the viewer sees the actor,” Loki admitted softly.
“Thank goodness I don’t have to teach you espionage. The other put on hats and sunglasses and call it good,” she exclaimed.
Sam groaned and got to his feet. Steve and Loki were waiting at the landing pad. Loki rushed up to Sam the second the door finished opening. “I’m home,” Sam grumbled encosing the boy in his arms.
He stepped forward but Loki held out his other hand. “Don’t,” he demanded, “the Magic Child is not in control right now. Let the magic run its course.
“Well, really he helped me. I was cooking and Bruce came in and asked if I was making anything, not meat related because he’s a vegetarian. I told him he could help me make those dishes," Wanda corrected.
Bucky rolled his eyes and put his lips against Steve’s ear. “Bucky, Baby, please. Please Baby. Let me suck you off. Want to make you feel so good,” he purred “Buck, Bucky, please please, want to get in my knees- and then the phone fucking rings.”
Rhodey nodded to the bag and Peter fumbled with it taking the decoration paper out. Inside was three very large books. Peter pulled them out. “They’re from MIT,” Rhodey announced, “that one is from the advanced freshman chemistry course, and the blue one is an introduction to biochem engineering.”
“Younglings who manifest with magic. Typically they do not have a mind stone awakening it,” Loki noted, “maybe that is why she survived. A magic child must receive proper training immediately or they are a danger to everyone. Without help to control it, the magic will manifest unformed and without direction which will cause it to be unstable and uncontrollable before killing the user when they react to danger.”
Sam looked him over. “Look at you,” Sam exclaimed, “a day in the gardens and you have light in your eyes and color in your cheeks.”
When Sam, Natasha, and Wanda left the room Loki looked up at the camera. “House Temptress please show me what happened yesterday before I passed out.”
Wanda gulped and whipped tears from her eyes. She hesitated and her voice cracked in one of the most heartbreaking sounds Clint had ever heard. “Okay, Oče.”
But Thor was back. Had he felt Loki’s pleasure and health? Had he grown bored of acting as a malevolent king and wanted his plaything? Maybe in order for Asgard to rise again, Thor needed to trade him off. Thor would take him from here whether Loki was willing to go or not. And if he was not willing to go the Avengers would fight for him. However, they were not god’s and Loki would not risk their safety for his own happiness. If they were hurt trying to help him he didn’t know what he would do. What lengths he would turn to Avenge them.
The commercial break went on and Bucky slaughtered over to the interviewer. He leaned his full weight into the man’s face. “If you ever make our girl uncomfortable like that again we are going to have a big problem,” he warned.
She left. Rhodey sat up. Tony smiled at him shaking slightly. He let out a short laugh. “She says all that like it’s nothing. Like two hundred doctors didn’t tell me that it was impossible and god himself would have to handle it. She delivers a miracle and all she wants in return is to hang out with my kid?”
Steve laughed leaning forward until his forehead was pressed against Bucky’s. “I promise I won’t kill Sam until you get back.”
Natasha’s angry maternal instincts, which she didn’t like admitted she had, got kicked in the face after spending an afternoon with Loki. They didn’t speak much, she just showed him Midgardian knives and weapons.
Sam flicked on his meditation playlist as Loki continued to shake in his arms. Eventually, Loki drifted off to sleep. “Do you think Thor knew,” Natasha asked.
“He’s Sam and I’m Mrs. Black Widow,” Natasha asked leaning against the counter next to Sam bumping his hip playfully.
“When we were young, Odin made me go to Thor’s chambers every night to brush his hair,” Loki told Sam.
be getting goats. Sam arrived home when Loki is helping Natasha make dinner. The truck horn blast and Steve and Bucky made their way out. Loki watched as the three men moved the planks from the truck to the yard. Natasha sat beside him and sighs, “they’re too pretty,” she complained, “no one should be that pretty and know it.”
Clint’s voice trailed off as they stared at Loki who had walked in the moment Clint had said Present. What was worse was that Loki had sunk to his knees spreading his thighs as far as they would go with his shoulders angled back and his head inching towards the ground. He had his arms clasped behind his back and it wasn’t hard to hear him hyperventilating.
Sam nodded. Peter nodded back seriously. And it was funny because Sam fit well with them and he accepted the challenge of keeping Wanda in the dark about herself with gusto. And soon the new atmosphere became natural. It didn’t get exciting again until the Black Widow arrived.
Loki snorted and set the kids down. “Hel,” he instructed, “I want you to cover your brother’s ears and put your face in his fur.”
Loki’s sobs increased, but his head slowly lifted up. Natasha stroked his face. “It’s ok,” she cooed, “come here. I’m not going to let anyone hurt you.”
In the quinjet Bucky and Steve were ignoring safety and laying on the floor of the plane. Really, Bucky had decided he was going to lay the fuck down and Steve was going to lay with him if he wanted to or not.
Then she slipped out taking the roses with her. “She was very distressed when she arrived,” Bucky said softly, “she kept yelling something about a fool who got himself into too much trouble and had no idea how to take care of himself.”
When we kissed that first time. I remember a gasp far too small to come from your giant form and for a moment all I could see was the pictures of you where you were small and I was afraid that I would break you. But then you pressed yourself against me and I was swallowed by you. I wasn’t sure which image was true, the small boy or the large captain. And I remember not caring. Which I guess was my mistake. I remember staring at your lips during that whole damn movie because I wanted to kiss you more than anything, but I couldn’t tell if you were gay or homophobic and it was driving me crazy. And I guess that sums up our relationship, I reacted instead of asking and you took everything I gave anyways. Until you didn’t.
Loki doesn’t focus much on what happens around him after that, because Sam was there and Sam was safe so Loki watched the movie like the Temptress requested and fell asleep as the next one started.
“Wait until he does his first interview. People will want to arrest him again,” Wanda announced sitting down across from Peter.
Natasha sighed. “It’s not your fault,” she waved him away, “it’s probably better that we have a  clean slate to work with Tony isn’t the best at hand to hand. Want to come Sam?”
Steve would love to explain it all to him, but he didn’t have time and they were in the middle of a fight. “Look Kid. There’s a lot going on here that you don’t understand,” he wanted Peter out of this fight as soon as possible.
Sam flinched. Great he had not figured out how to have this conversation yet. Well his mom did appreciate blunt honesty. “I’m not coming home for Thanksgiving,” he admitted.
The pair eyed each other for a second and Bucky set his phone on the table. Then Peter was rambling and firing off more questions and Shuri kept up with his ramble and he was eagerly keeping up with her.
Peter almost laughed at the way the two men tensed up and shot each other twin looks of excitement and confusions. Ah so they caught that but Wanda didn’t. And while they were both confused they let it roll.
“Vermont legalized it while we were on leave. One of the first fifty homosexual couples to get married in the United States,” Sam admitted.
It turned out Snickerdoodles we’re good. “Clint, Wanda, and Vision have arrived,” the House Temptress announced.
Loki groaned. “That can’t be comfortable. Let’s get you to the coach if you're going to sleep here.”
As Bucky returned to his chair the tv popped up with Shuri’s face and she giggled. “That was the gayest thing I have ever seen,” she exclaimed excitedly.
He turned his head and watched the three other exiled Avengers plus Scott, and Vision floating next to Wanda walk in. “Mr. Stark,” Vision flustered, “I believe there is an explanation.”
Natasha drummed her fingers on her chair watching the entrance to the news set. The reporter walked onto the stage and shook hands with Sam and Rhodey before falling into conversation with the pair. Tony sipped his coffee looking around distractedly and texting Peter. Wanda walked in with Clint. “Oče,” Wanda whined reaching for his coffee.
Peter wrestled with the blanket trying to get up and fell when he heard Nephew. “Nephew,” he squeaked.
Sam resisted the urge to facepalm. “That’s Bucky”, Sam informed him, “and they are engaged. It’s not really considered polite to call someone a bedmate.”
“Nah,” one of the boys answered, “we’re going to race home, but Sue and Jacque might want one, oh and Dylan’s Dad is picking him up tonight so don’t let him leave until then.”
Steve was stunned for a second when he saw Spiderman at the airport in the suit he had made for him with Tony. That almost hurt more than anything Tony had down so far, but he could yell at Tony later. He had to stop Zemo and he had to make sure Bucky was safe. Get that programming out of his head. Then he could fix things with Tony, or just fight for fucking custody of the kid.
The screen faded away. After the Avengers hurried off stage to the dressing rooms. The news studio was silent and then it was a flurry of emotion and excitement. Bucky showed them the video of the proposal, and they made plans to go out to eat, but to pick up the kids first.
They were walking to the next bar when Steve saw a pride flag hanging under a neon sign. “What about this one,” he said switching his directions and heading towards it.
Natasha assessed Thor who was the picture of panic and frustration, but she waited until Sam had taken Loki back into the house. “I came as soon as I received your message,” Thor added, “my friends what is going on?”
Clint shrugged and started to chug. “Can we have everyone take their seats?” A producer asked, “and has anyone seen Captain Rogers or Sargent Barnes?”
Bucky and Sam crowded around Steve large shoulders blocking his view. “I’m not going through college classes again with you again,” Sam told him signing his name, “ that was torture.
“And Thor said the spell prevents him from doing so,” Sam argued, “watch us through F.R.I.D.A.Y. You’ll see if anything happens.”
Loki teleported to the vault Tony kept his book. His hand ghosted on the cover, but he would not look at it. Instead, he sent out his magic to search for Thor and found him at one of the houses in the Neighborhood, so he teleported himself there.
I can’t fucking believe you, go to hell. Your father had more sense than you, and he convinced me it was a good idea to have do some gunplay in the tent next to the general's tent.
Loki allowed himself to flinch. Allowed himself to be a scared little thing trembling at the power before him. He didn’t speak. “Loki. Please. You don’t look well like that. Get up. Please.”
Wanda had been walking from her late night class to the student parking lot where Happy was suppose to pick her up from. As she entered the parking lot in the dark mind you, someone grabbed her arm. “Miss. Maximoff.”
“The Universe believes that you are dead,” Thor pointed out, “and if you had come with me they would have found out the truth. I didn’t want to risk your life until we were settled. So I needed you to come here. And I needed them to be unafraid of you, but mostly I did not trust you.”
“Not until you start loving me again,” Tony whined as Bruce took the coffee away and poured it down the drain.
Peter made an O gesture. Loki didn’t get a chance to explain himself before Mj and Furry walked in. They were silent. The Barton children squealed and jumped at Fury. Furry knelt down to wrap Cooper and Lillia into his arms. He kissed their cheeks before balancing one on each hip and standing up. Jesus the man did not act his age. Mj sat on the sofa next to Peter. “You could look a little happier to see me,” Nick pointed out.
They left and a moment later Thor walked in. His hair was still short, but it looked better styled now. He was wearing black sweatpants and a sweatshirt. “Your fashion sense is horrendous,” Loki complained.
Tony stared at the paper in his hand for another moment before daring to look up at Steve. Steve’s cheeks were red and tears were rolling down them, and Tony had no idea how to handle that and a sound that sounded like he was being strangled escaped his lips. Bucky was rubbing circles into his back not looking at Tony.
Loki pried his eyes open. Sam was crouching down in front of him. Loki flinched banging his head against the cupboard. Loki bit his lip. “I’m going to back up now,” Sam announced and took a few steps back.
Peter groaned, and went to his bedroom to update Ned, Mj, and Wanda. “Oh cool,” Wanda responded immediately.
Odin made him that way. But it was still who he was. “You’ve sucked at those descriptions lately," Natasha chuckled.
He smiled. Okoye started at him for a moment passively staring before the side of her lip twitched into a smile. “James,” she greeted.
Tony set a bag down and pulled out a bottle of vodka and a dozen roses. “I owe her an apology and if I want to live to give a proper one,” he shrugged, “it does not hurt to have advantages.”
Sam stood from his spot on the couch, stepping closer to them. Not because Shuri needed protection, but because if Bucky managed to hurt her he would never forgive himself. “I’ve finished the updates for your arm,” she announced happily pulling at his flesh hand towards a chair.
Natasha sighed setting a plate of food onto the coffee table with a bottle of vodka in her hand. “Should I read this,” she asked motioning towards to the book.
“We are giving you hell tomorrow,” Bucky corrected pulling the blankets over all three of them and wrapping them both up in his arms.
Steve whined blushing. Bucky slung an arm around his shoulder and started to laugh. Tony started to laugh as well, and Steve just sat there blushing. He felt horrible about not knowing he was dating Tony. What kind of boyfriend was he!
So Peter stumbled out of the car with his backpack and she gave him a tight-lipped smile. “Hi Mrs. Black Widow,” Peter exclaimed, “thanks for making sure I don’t die this week!”
Mj’s eyes didn’t leave the book. “Through the front door,” she answered, in more of a duh tone she had any right to have.
Wanda blinked in surprise. “He actually does have a story book,” Natasha put in, “a big old list of all the stupid shit we’ve done, that nearly killed him.”
Bucky laughed batting the paper away. Loki watched the interaction fascinated. He had never seen two warriors act like this. They were on completely even ground both physically, emotionally, and throughout their relationship. Most times they acted more like separate pieces of one person than two separate people. Sam had been right Steve and Bucky weren’t a danger to each other. Sam kept his promises and told him the truth.
Two days after he found him in the garden Sam was sitting with Natasha in Loki’s hospital room followers from Bucky, Wanda, and Peter surrounding them. Cho was going over the schematics with Jane again. They had gotten his temperature to stop rising, but if that was a good thing or bad thing was questionable.
Bucky eyed Tony and Sam pressed a hand against Bucky’s mouth. “Don’t start the teenage angst bullshit again,” Sam warned.
Loki sat up. “I tried to take over your world and destroyed your city”, he stated, “you deserve an explanation. Thank you for allowing me to collect my mind. Since I have not been attacked I assume that you are aware that not all I did was of my own complete violation.”
Wanda broke down into tears clutching the older man. Somehow he managed to get them both into the car and a blanket around her pressed against his side. Happy like usual was muttering grumpily, but this time it had some bite to it.
He had already liked Peter from the airport fight, but this child was... “wouldn’t we all,” Sam agreed.
“That wasn’t a play by play,” Bucky corrected “a play by play would be telling you where his hands were, where his mouth was going, how he licked-“
Bucky got his Twitter up and running and was verified. Clint gave Bucky a selfie stick much to Bucky’s delight and everyone else’s horror. Somehow they ended up in one big group photo. Which Bucky proudly posted with the caption
When Tony finished he wasn’t sure if he was laughing or crying. That was so much better than Steve’s first letter.
Sam laughed and they set off. An hour later Loki knocked on the apartment door. The gathering was already in full blast. Sam’s Mom shouldered her way to the door and opened it. Music danced past them and Sam watched Loki relax. “There’s my boys!”
Tony’s head snapped up and Steve threw the vial. Tony juggled It before he caught it. His eyes lit up and Steve was a little in love with him at that moment.
Thor nodded. “Besides Loki cannot harm you,” he announced, “I have had an old spell placed on Loki traps his magic and prevents him from hurting anyone. I’m sure you’ll find Loki quiet pleasant. Which is also why I brought him to you in the most non-threatening way as possible.”
As November hit them Sam got a call from his mother. They were a pretty close family, but he did tend to be the oddball, especially when he moved out of DC. “I booked your ticket for the flight home,” she announced when he picked up, “and don’t tell me you aren’t coming home for Thanksgiving.”
Well, Loki didn’t speak much in general. Only if he was spoken to. Even then he mostly preferred to communicate with head shakes.
It was silent for a moment. “I thought you’d be in charge next to Cap being his boyfriend in all,” Tony stated.
Pepper blushed and looked down at her ring. “I always told him I wouldn’t marry him until he got his life together. I didn’t ever expect him to really,” Pepper laughed, “but he did, and he did it for Peter. Maybe I should be jaded that he would change for a child and not for me, but parenthood looks good on him.”
“You talk on the phone every day,” Bucky pointed out, “it's not like you haven’t talked in a month.”
By dinner, Loki had charmed everyone in the house, which didn’t surprise Sam one bit. He had expected Loki to do this. What he wondered was if Loki liked any of them back. There was no time to figure out though. After dinner, Sam’s mother called him into her room.
Sam looked at Lo over his nieces curly hair. He was frozen, looking confused and determined and a little scared. Sam wasn’t really sure how well Loki’s brain processed homosexuality and its history and cultural reactions on Earth. Sam figured that Loi thought that some men forced smaller men into sex, but men having sex was something taboo. He seemed alright with Steve and Bucky, but Sam supposed that was because they were both entirely equal that Loki wasn’t worried about a power imbalance. And his past relationship with Rylie didn’t both Loki either, but again they were equal footing. Sam wasn’t really sure if Loki knew that Darcy and Jane were together in the romantic kind of way, or if the atmosphere made him relaxed about the idea.
“If I feel uncomfortable we can leave and if I start to feel bad I have to tell you,” Loki repeated.
“Be good at languages,” Steve suggested without sympathy, “I was pretty good with them before the serum.”
Despite how messed up Steve and Bucky both where it wasn’t hard to see that they were in love. You just had to look at them and you knew it. Then there was the fact that if someone touched Steve Bucky basically had a meltdown. Yeah, there was definitely some unhealthy codependency issues there were working at.
Wanda didn’t try to put her smile back in place, but she kissed Vision’s cheek. “Peter,” she called.
The wrapping was an emerald green. He ran a finger over the silver bow. He pulled at the bow and let it twirl through his fingers before he carefully unwrapped the box popping the lid open. It was an intricate bracelet or maybe a wrist cuff? “Well Pepper knew how to get it made, and Clint suggested the designs to Steve who drew it, and Bucky added the flower indents to it, and Tony might have classed it up a bit, but it was my idea.”
None of the other Avengers knew what the pair was doing, despite Natasha's pestering, until a picture popped up on Twitter again.
“When you want to have sex with someone you give your consent to them. When one party isn’t giving consent or isn’t able to give consent that’s called rape, and that messes up a person. And from what I understand you didn’t give consent and you weren’t able to give it. You didn’t want it.”
Thor spared her a quick glance. “Everyone this is the Valkyrie Brunnhilde, my new second in command,” Thor quickly introduced, “forgive me for not making the proper introductions earlier.”
Nikita took T’Challa’s hand and he kissed her's. Bucky smiled at her. “Selfie,” he asked waving his phone.
Tony snorted “and he got all that righteous fury from you. If I can get that stick out from your ass I think you have some snark to I think he could get that from both of us.”
Good days Loki acted like a slightly reserved and shy teenager, maybe a little content, but bad days he sat silent and still staring out a window and flinching at anyone who came too near. Sometimes he only sat and screamed. Some days were worse than others and Sam spent many days on the couch with Loki watching movies and musicals and dance videos just trying to soothe him. Some days it worked and some days it didn’t.
So Loki couldn’t listen to what they were saying. It didn’t matter. It didn’t matter. It really didn’t matter. Except Thor was undoing the chains. Loki rubbed his wrist. He hated handcuffs. Hate them. “Be good while I am gone Loki,” Thor ordered and hugged him, “once we get settled I will come back for you.”
His mother was silent for a long minute. “How is that possible? There wasn't any place at the time was there?”
Tony set the flowers and vodka down and hugged the other man. Bucky froze at first but slowly hugged back. “We’ll work on it,” Tony promised when he pulled away.
Sam tried not to groan. “You want to tell me something and don’t act surprised that I know because we both know that I know when any of my kids are troubled,” she scolded shutting the door.
Despite her guard, Wanda felt enraptured by the women in front of her. And despite herself, she enjoyed the day. Lunch to her surprise was easy going and they talked easily making sure she was included even if she wasn’t saying anything, and going shopping was fun. Wanda had learned her sense of fashion from magazines she had stolen, but she had three people wanting to help and update her look.
Bucky smirked and leaned against his side of the wall. Tony looked at Bucky, who was wearing a self-satisfied smirk. and groaned. Bucky’s eyebrows raised in alarm. Tony groaned again. “Don’t do that,” he demanded, “god don’t do that!”
“Ok,” Peter agreed bouncing on his toes knowing he had somehow convinced Tony to do what no one else had.
He came back out in sweatpants and a purple sweater. “No,” Shuri and Sam yelled at the same time pouring back the room.
Steve leaned forward and pressed the play button on a school video. There was Peter Parker stumbling over a chair. “Peter be careful,” the person behind the camera whined.
Darcy poked at him again grabbing his hair. “I think you're hair is longer than Thor’s. What’s up with you Asgardians and long hair?”
Steve got up from the table and laid down next to him on the ground and propped up his head on his elbow watching Bucky’s face. “Yeah Buck,” he answered.
It was a small little game they had. Bucky would gift Sam with the worst thing he could find and see if Sam would refuse to use it. Sam was not going to lose. Hence the terrible apron and iron man slippers in his room.
Later back at the compound Tony thought that he’d always regret bringing Peter into that fight. That was why he couldn’t look at him. Peter was supposed to be his and Steve’s responsibility, but that was ruined now.
Loki focused on Wanda and the way her magic was pulsing at his mind. He searched for the section it was aiming for. It was the section in which his memory of invading earth was in, the part the Mind Stone touched. Loki looked a the android who had the mind stone.
When they both woke up in the morning Bucky had over ten million followers on Twitter and Steve have almost nine million, which was interesting, to say the least. Bucky didn't think that was normal. There was a very adamant Tweet from Tony.
He lead Darcy and Jane who had followed him out of the room to a set of twirling stainless steel black stairs. He beckoned them up “oh Sam,” Jane exclaimed, “it’s perfect.”
Sam nodded. “We were sent to Vermont for a two-day leave,” Sam stated, “and we were there the day they started to officiate marriage certificates.”
Loki tried not to focus on anything. Not even his swirling thoughts. Not of his own memories of Odin dragging him to the planets of their allies and laying Loki at their feet in offering. His angry hand on his shoulders crushing it, telling Loki what he would do to him if he didn’t obey these people. How eventually all he had needed was to hold Loki shoulder and tell him to behave to reduce him to a trembling mess.
Loki watched Tony pat Wanda’s shoulders. The House Temptress said that she was a witch, but she didn’t smell like sage or yellow weed.
Loki sniffed it and put it down. “What are my mimosas not good enough for you,” Natasha demanded in the way that Sam knew she was teasing.
Pepper rushed into the room followed by Wanda. Tony saw Peter standing in the doorway with Shuri. Pepper kissed the other man and Rhodey pulled his daughter into his arms. Tony left them to it and grabbed his son’s shoulder, “I’m going to go call Dr. Cho, but do you want to head down to the lab? You could show Shuri R5.”
He watched every muscle in the captain's body relax, a very forced effort. Without a word he took it and started to read.
He watched his family listen to his plea. Lo relaxed as well and they stayed for another hour before they went back to the quinjet and back home. “That was interesting,” Loki noted.
Sam and Bucky jostled in. “Hey,” Sam greeted laughing, “let me take a shower and we can have dinner.”
He took the plate and left. He knocked on Loki’s door. It slid open immediately. Loki was sitting on the floor against the wall facing the door a book in his lap. He didn’t meet Sam’s eyes keeping them downcast. Sam set the plate on the desk. “Hey Loki,” he greeted, “I don’t think we did introductions yesterday. I’m Sam Wilson.”
Loki whirled his way in and waved. “Hi, Grandma Wilson,” he greeted as instructed after their second call, and ducked under Sam’s arm and pressing against his side.
Natasha shrugged. “He’s settled down,” she pursed her lips, “he agreed to move here, but it’s got him tense.”
They walked a block before either of them said anything. Finally, Bucky spoke. “Ya, know Steve’s Ma basically raised both of us. My own Ma she was great but I had a fair share of siblings. Mrs. Rogers basically adopted me when Steve did. Misery loves company and loving Steve is defiantly a misery.”
Sam hadn’t thought about taking Loki out of the neighborhood. Loki was so recognizable, but now he looked like Sam’s biological kid. Sam could take Loki where ever. He could get Loki some damn therapy. He’d been probing around the Recovery community, like he had when they got Bucky, but he hadn’t said anything concrete about it. Sam made a note to call T’Challa and see if he would help. Sam didn’t like to ask much of the King, but Wakanda did not care much about what happened in the outside world. They had not cared about Bucky so maybe they wouldn’t care about Loki.
Thor shrugged and laughed. Loki stared blankly at the wall in front of them. “Sadly where I must travel to secure a planet for my people has a bounty for Loki’s head. So despite the history, I must ask you to shelter Loki while I am away. You are the only people I trust to do so.”
There was a silence in the room, but then Sam moved pulling Loki into a hug before he called Thor. Natasha led Loki to the living room and he curled up on the couch a blanket wrapped around him. Bucky and Steve arrived before Thor did. “I’ll be right outside the door,” Bucky promised kneeling down beside the boy, “and if you ever try to turn yourself in again, I will burn your pumpkin patch.”
They sat in the kitchen. Tony had taken Peter to school and Wanda was being dropped at college as well by Rhodey and Clint. “Friends what is going on,” Thor asked as soon as they were all sitting.
Monogamy was fine. He was monogamous with Bucky for a while until they meet Peggy. Well kinda. They were as monogamous as two queer kids could be in the nineteen twenties. Which meant Bucky chased skirts and pretended to. Peggy had grabbed Steve’s heart the moment he saw her and Bucky knew the second he saw them. Which didn’t bug Bucky so much as long as Steve didn’t leave him. So Steve wouldn’t mind one bit sharing Tony with someone if Tony was interested.
Tony and Clint still kept their distance, but a polite distance instead of an angry one. Peter hung around Loki whenever he was at the neighborhood.
A few hours later Shuri came onto the server and over to Bucky’s farm riding a rhino, she created because she wanted it. Shuri didn’t say anything to him, just left a cute stuffed bear in a chest which Bucky put on the bed.
Four hours later Loki was coherently awake and Natasha was smiling. Flustering over him in ways that only she could.
Tony locked his jaw and nodded to Sam. “Thank you,” Sam soothed and nodded his head to get the others to leave.
“Hey Sam,” Tony asked after the second movie finished and they were all staring at the sleeping demigod, “why does Lo sleep so much? I don’t remember Thor doing that.”
Then Loki went over to the bookshelf and started looking through the books. He danced his way down the line and his magic suddenly brought him up like steps. Loki ended up pulling a rather large book out and plopped down on top of the bookshelf.
Loki laughed. His blood pumping. This is what he expected. He knew this. “Try,” Loki dared pulling himself to his feet with all his grace, the grace that had been drilled into him the grace he had spent his whole life learning to weaponize.
Only when Bruce at looked at him with fear in his eyes as he had finally given up of trying to break Tony out of a science binge after an hour of trying. “Not really.”
No one saw Shuri and Peter till dinner, but F.R.I.D.A.Y assured them that the teens were alright. Natasha laughed with Nikita and Okoye, who she hadn’t spent much time with previously. “Congratulations on your engagement,” T’Challa said to Steve and Bucky as Tony passed him a drink, “Mother sends her congratulations as well.”
Loki nodded a soft breath of airbrushing past his lips like a prayer. “All good things are green,” he explained, “my birth mother eyes, my Mother's favorite color, the color of the apple Angrboda gave to me when we first meet, and Jörmungandr’s scales. The twins had the green of my birth mother’s eyes, and their mother wore green on our wedding day. When Thor came home from his first campaign of war we went swimming in the green sea. Nature is green and so is my magic,” Loki paused and looked up at the sky through the roof, “and Hulk. Hulk is green and good”
Scott yelled again and Bucky settled against the wall again. A couple of girls walked by and Bucky juggled his knives around offering a small smile to them. They stopped to watch giggling. Eventually, they kept walking and Bucky kept juggling effortlessly.
Since it wasn’t Shuri Bucky flipped him off without missing a beat. Then he realized that Miss. Potts was there as well and felt ashamed. “Sorry Ma’am,” Bucky apologized.
Steve mentally came up with a cover story to match Chase. The apartment was nice, very obvious kids lived here. Steve made the mental note that Sam and Tony would love the kitchen.
Sam forced himself to stop talking. Loki looked at the picture again and back at Sam. “Losing your spouse is pain beyond measure,” Loki murmured, “thank you for sharing with me.”
They sat in silence. “Is it safe to bring Peter home?” Tony asked, “I haven’t told him why we are staying at the tower right now and he’s getting antsy.”
Sam pulled up some of the paperwork he needed to do for the VA. He had tomorrow off as well then he had to go back to work. Natasha and Steve were going to watch Loki. Bucky said he would help Loki start a garden if he wanted. Sam suspected that Bucky might spend the day teaching Loki some dances of his age. Maybe.
Yeah, it could have been. Between the hot chocolate warm pretzels and ice cream Wanda fell asleep. When she woke up she was in her bead and her head was thumping. The events of the previous night rushed over her. She groaned and threw a pillow over her head.
She only lived because she needed to see Pietro again. That was the thing about their powers. Pietro had needed to get to her so his powers had manifested in physical abilities and Wand had needed to see her brother so she had got the mental ones. But oh had that been painful with HYDRA’s knives stabbing them as well.
Most of the team thought that he and Sharon had a thing going on, and he supposed they might. Honestly, the idea of dating Peggy’s niece sort of disturbed him, especially since Peggy was still alive and they had been sort of dating when he went into the ice. Sharon agreed, even though she did admit that what she felt for him wasn’t necessarily familiar or friendly. Steve didn’t really like thinking about that mess and really they were both happy with their weekly wine nights. Wednesday nights Steve would bring a bottle of red wine to her apartment and they would drink while watching trashy reality tv shows and doing each other's nails.
Right he was the little shrinking one. Everyone was quite insistent that Steve was in love with him, but whatever. Liars or something like that.
Loki turned his head towards the direction of the small version of the hulk. He indeed did not have any meat on his plate. “Oh,” he answered lamely.
Loki did not respond. When they arrived at Steve and Bucky’s house Loki went ahead of Sam to the door and knocked.
“Congratulations,” Rhodey answered and he smiled with them, “I’ll be back tomorrow is the kid still going to be there?”
Loki stared at him. Which Sam thought that said more about his mental state than anything he had said today. “Let’s go get dinner,” Sam suggested walking away.
The bouncer raised her eyebrows at him and he handed over his fake ID. “And why wouldn’t I,” he asked as the bouncer handed his ID back.
Wanda almost didn’t hear what Tony had said because she was overwhelmed by the love in the room and the purity that radiated off of Peter Parker.
Bucky shrugged. “You’re weird about your personal space,” he answered, “we’ve been waiting for you to invite him.”
MJ shoved Peter towards Wanda and Peter stumbled over. He looked objectively confused and Tony walked across the room to be busy with something else to hide his emotions, because really who wouldn't get choked up at people choosing you as family. “Spider-Man,” Fury greeted, “I don’t have to tell you to drive your old man nuts.”
The winter soldier wasn’t in Bucky’s brain anymore, the triggers were gone, he couldn’t be turned into that anymore, Shuri and Wanda made sure of it, but there was still something dark lurking inside him, a completion of the effects of torture and brainwashing.
She patted the spot over her heart. “So tell me all about it. Now that you’ve confessed, you aren’t getting out of it.”
Tony sighed. “I close my eyes and see fucking wormholes. I should at least be able to tell him that.”
“We’re proud of you,” Gideon announced, “for sharing this with us. Now please tell me you are dating Alice because I have fifteen dollars on Alice.”
Steve snorted. “Despite popular opinion I do understand technology. I might not be as intuitive as Bucky but I work my way there. I’m even taking a few computer classes at the college.”
Sam had an ecliptic taste in music and would listen to just about anything that anyone put on, except country. He put up with enough shit to deal with country music. And everyone knew that. Thankfully.
Steve heard their door open and Tony’s brown tousled hair poked in. “Hi,” Tony wiggled against their door frame rubbing a circle with his toe.
When Steve and Tony pulled away Steve leaned down and picked up the letters. His face was beat red. “So you came to France to give me a reply to letters I never sent,” Steve asked clearing his throat.
“Don’t you?” Scott asked and then immediately backtracked “I mean of course I don’t mind-I-we-thought-you.”
Loki watched Bruce go. It felt like his last lifeline to his brother was gone. He locked his jaw and heard the sound of a book hitting a thigh and flinched. Thor hadn’t brought that had he? Loki looked into Tony’s hands. Yes, the book was there. Tony squinted at it. “How to take care of your Loki,” he read, “why in hell are you sitting on a throne?”
“Maybe. We could move you in here and it would fill it up a bit. The Ranch house gets a bit crowded,” Sam offered.
“Not to mention detailed instructions on how to break him and fourteen different spells to keep his magic and himself from hurting anyone,” Bruce added
Steve smiled lovingly. “After I rescued Bucky from Zemo’s lab and we were back at base he was shaking so bad. Kept saying that all he feared was that he wasn’t gonna see me anymore. Kept telling me he would marry me if he could. Said he wanted to marry me so bad. I agreed. And we exchanged our dog tags. Our plans was to find an apartment in Brooklyn after the war and settle down" he explained.
Steve gave him another smile and Clint turned back to the interviewer. “Alright buckle up for this one, this is the best story you'll get all year.”
“I have work from six to five tomorrow,” Sam announced as Hair Spray faded away, “Bucky and Steve plan on coming over. I think Bucky is bring over some lilies to plant.”
Keeping his story in mind Steve answered, “not really. My wife did most of the cooking, but I gotta step up now.”
Bucky snorted as Peter took off running. Everyone had gotten into the habit of calling Steve Peter’s father and it was so ingrained that no one could stop. Really though Peter didn’t seem to notice it that much, especially if it wasn’t Tony taking. Or maybe he did notice and just decided to ignore it. Who knew?
Despite what his words suggested Steve knew that Bucky had been having a hard time earlier. Bucky nuzzled into Steve’s neck until Steve tickled him.
Shuri was silent for another moment. “I want to meet Peter,” she answered, “but I am not a doctor. I’m agreeing to this because I admire your Colonel Rhodes. Not because I think you can give me anything I want.”
Loki hummed, and Tony strolled in. Loki watched the small man stroll over to the coffee pot and poured a large cup. “Did Pepper take away your coffee supplies again?” Natasha asked.
He grabbed his phone. He needed to fix it before it was too late. It rang as he picked it up. Happy.	Tony hit answer and he heard his security guard’s deep breath. “Tony. We have a problem,” he announced, “check the news.”
Sam glanced over at Loki. What could be said? “Lo’s a prisoner of war,” he announced deciding it was close enough to the truth, “his family left him with us to help him,” also close enough to the truth.
She slid down to the floor and held him tight and Sam stopped trying not to cry. He broke down in his mother’s arms. She rocked them back and forth and made calming sounds. “I’m sorry Baby. I’m sorry you had to go through that alone.”
So here’s the thing Steve Rodgers might have a small crush on Tony Stark. A lot of people assumed that Steve was quiet around Stark because he didn’t like him, but Steve had been the same way around Peggy and Bucky the first time they meet. Steve had a thing for falling for people larger than life.
Sam remembered the long afternoons in Wakanda of Natasha and Steve playing with Bucky’s hair. The pride he had felt when Bucky had first asked him to do the same. The fact that he had Bucky’s trust was breathtaking.
Tony nodded his agreement. “Yeah and he’s having a slumber party at my tower in twenty-four hours,” he complained with a smile, “he has good friends.”
Steve didn’t know that he was dating Tony Stark. Honest to god he didn’t. Sure he had been flirting with Tony a little before he had discovered that Bucky was alive, but they hadn’t really gotten further than that. At least that was what he had thought.
So the next three or four chapters will feature Loki and Sam, I didn't expect this part to get this large, but it got a little away from me. Hope you enjoy.
“Peps he has bed head,” Tony complained as they walked to a board meeting, “it’s like criminal. My bed head is a mess and it’s so sexy on him. Ugh,” Tony complained.
Loki pulled his knees up to his chest out of Sam’s reach. “Which is fine,” Sam added, “but you need to eat. Man, you look like you haven’t eaten in weeks. You didn’t look like that when you arrived.”
Loki decided to answer the question rather than point out Sam’s lack of understanding. “I am tethered to the Avengers,” Loki answered, “not necessarily this place.”
“Who the fuck are you and why the hell are you getting your rocks off attacking a defenseless kid,” Bucky yelled.
Loki pursed his lips. “You did not inform them that you are going to go see your family,” he pointed out.
Sam didn’t argue that technically Loki wasn’t his kid, because in truth that was what he was. Sam didn’t ever expect Loki to call him anything like Dad, that might be weird, and besides, there was a lot of trauma attached to that for Loki. “We’ll come and visit soon,” Sam promised.
Tony didn’t look at the picture for too long. Instead, he quickly reposted it and spent several minutes looking down at his hands. He should have been at that funeral, but he hadn’t wanted to get in Cap’s way or bring the attention to himself, so he had stayed home and drank. Peggy had been one of the nice constants in his childhood. Less frequent than Jarvis, the human one, but still just as kind and caring and taught him to shoot a gun and be pretty when you were about to screw someone over. So yeah that sucked.
Loki stuck his tongue out at him. “I’m going on lunch,” Sam told Dax and Alex, “I’ll be back in an hour.”
“I believe that Peter is referring to the nine letters that Steve sent to James Barnes when they were separated during the war,” Vision put in.
“I’m not running the technological advancement of a country.” Bucky stated, “I’m just in charge of a door.”
It was weeks of steady progress to Bucky after that. Bucky still wasn’t talkative, but he talked more. Sudden sly and witty comments no one was expecting. Joking with Scott and Clint and Sam. Going out by himself. Making food.
Peter sat shocked for a moment. He had met the man a couple of times, he was Tony’s best friend after all, but he was busy so they often missed each other and the times they had meet it had been quick looks and waves.
I’m laying in bed right now and I’m thinking about the way your eyes get darker when you're sleep deprived. How you bite your bottom lip when your tinkering on Peter’s suit. I miss you, and I hate that. I still kind of hate you.
The tall lanky god glared from his spot leaning against the wall. His hands were chained in front of him and a muzzle was locked over his mouth. Like the one, Thor had taken him home in. Thor rolled his eyes and marched over to his brother. Loki’s eyes went wide as Thor picked him up and walked back over. There was something resigned and defeated in the way Loki hung limply even when Thor set him back down. Thor put his large hands on his brother’s shoulders.
When Sam went to check on Loki in the morning Loki was sitting on his bed with the blanket in his lap. “I want to return this to Steve’s bed partner.”
Loki froze suddenly very phased. Sam can’t blame him. He scooched the chair back some and Loki climbed onto his lap pressing his face into Sam’s neck taking large and deep breaths, just like Sam had taught him to. Sam held on just as tightly and breathed with him.
Furry was silent for a moment before nodding. “Just make sure the public doesn’t know he’s here,” he ordered.
Sam felt sick and Loki dissolved into maddening screams of grief. It wasn’t the kind of thing you could fake. Sam gently combed his fingers through Loki’s hair until he cried himself to sleep.
Tony swung the door open. “What’s your obsession with green Lo,” he asked but didn’t stop talking, “Jane and Darcy just arrive and since your well enough to be up and moving your well enough to come and greet them.”
“Okay,” Sam agreed and looked over at the time, “we got some time. Want me to put on Dancing with the Stars?”
Loki could hardly bear it. Why would Thor act so sweet if he was going to be cruel? “Loki,” Thor repeated, “Brother. Tell me what is going on in your head.”
Steve smiled and sat up, knowing he could get a rise out of Tony peaking his phone out to film the reaction. “Hey, do you own the Incredibles.”
Bucky glanced up at the drawing and his lips drew up into a snarl. Steve laughed at him. Ok, so they were both in a mood today, not just Bucky. It was just Bucky was homicidal like this and Steve was an asshole.
Bucky fiddled with his favorite knife and waited. Scott diapered for a second only to return letting his legs dangle off the ledge a gun resting on his lap. “I come in peace,” Tony Stark yelled waving around a small white flag.
He squished Steve in his large arms and Steve hugged him back bewildered. “What new Light is in your eyes?”
Rhodey bit his lip. “I think we need to explain our thoughts on it clearly and discuss why,” he shrugged, “maybe we can and maybe we can’t. We’ll see what happens, but Tony and Steve can’t do that themselves, so it’s up to you and me.”
Rhodey finally up and walking again took walks with Loki through the gardens. It was slow going for Rhodey, but Loki didn’t complain. He just made a lot of deliberate slow stops, and then acted like he didn’t.
Pepper and Rhodey’s screen shrank and a video appeared. Peter Parker tumbled onto the screen followed by a loud whine “Peter be careful!” Ever protection instinct Bucky had kicked into overdrive.
“NoPe” Peter agreed, “my Dad is going to kill me, but Mj kidnapped me and brought me here and told me to come here so I figure she’ll kill me worse and she said ‘no, to the questions you have when you get there’ so I figure New York wasn’t actually you and you are not evil.”
The result was Tony scanning the entire neighborhood with Thor giving them all a troubled and suffering look. The shapeshifter was gone and would appear again when he wanted to. Thor knew this, new that there was a chance that they wouldn’t know even if he did show up again in another form.
“Hydra had the Winter Soldier kill my parents,” Tony confessed, “and my reaction was not something I am proud of.”
Tony looked a little shocked but an easy smile spread across his face and he gave Steve a fake salute. “On my way Cap.”
Bucky swept over to Steve’s side. They sat beside each other their chairs touching. Steve whispered something into Bucky’s ear and Tony groaned. They were so disgusting together.
So yeah everything worked out. Sam finished putting the French toast on a plate and took Natasha’s outstretched hands. They swayed around the kitchen a little drawing Loki’s attention who watched with a small smile. As the music picked up so did Natasha and they swung into a couple of moves that looked easy but had taken to much practice to learn.
Bucky and Steve were the last to leave. Daniel stopped them on their way out. “Captain Rodgers, Sergeant Barnes,” he said shaking their hands his own shaking violently “Thank you. It means so much to people like us. My partner... he, uh, tried to kill himself when he was sixteen because he was such a huge fan of you, but his parents convinced him that he was going to hell and that you would hate him, hate people like us. So really thank you,” his voice shook, “it means the world to us that you’d share this.”
Dr. Strange didn’t look impressed. “I came because he is unconscious and dying. I can tell Stark how to heal him.”
Shuri shrugs like it’s not a big deal. “Oh,” she said, “Miss. Potts and the Iron Patriot are calling.”
That’s because Loki had dropped his glamour once he was alone. He had put it up so Thor didn’t think he had gotten weak. “There’s food on the table,” Sam indicated, “you should eat. Dinner is at six if you want to come join us. No one's going to bug you if you do. You’re free to walk around the ranch house. F.R.I.D.A.Y will prevent you from going anywhere you are not permitted to go.”
He had known that Clint and Scott were coming to get Steve so he had wanted to scare them a bit to make sure they remembered what he had been. Bucky knew that who he once was wouldn’t have wanted to scare anyone, but that was then and this was now.
Natasha raised her eyebrow in a way that promised violence. Clint squeaked and Ned looked up at him and Ned felt glad that he now had someone to suffer with. Clint nodded slightly. “Yeah I don’t really want to die today,” he announced, “and Mj can get me thrown off a roof and she won’t care that I have kids.”
Sam heard the grief in Loki’s voice and remembered that he to had lost his spouse, lost two wives. That Loki would understand his grief.
Loki was shaking. It was the most he had spoken without prompting since he had arrived, and apparently, the idea was distressing as well.
Sam had been on fifteen different news shows in the last two days explaining his case to the American people. He had gone on Ellen
Clint threw his empathy coffee cup at them. “Shut up already. Geez. I thought the European trip would have gotten you out of this.”
When she woke up she was in a soft room that smelled like lavender. Wanda rubbed her face as she sat up on the bed.
Finally, evening came and everyone sat at the table to eat leftovers. Janie’s eyes flickered up and down the table and when Moma asked if anyone wanted to say anything. Thanksgiving in the Wilson household was a time for sharing and confessing. Janie locked her jaw. “I have a girlfriend,” she announced her voice firm and steady, “I’m bisexual”
Michelle snorted. “Ned incas, you forgot we are sitting in their living room. I thought it was kind of obvious,” she announced.
The two men nodded and Shuri waved off. A second later Pepper Potts and James Rhodes was on the screen sitting on a couch. For a moment both pairs assessed each other before Rhodey started to laugh. “Why do you both dress so old. F.R.I.D.A.Y screenshot this and put it in my blackmail folder,” he exclaimed as Miss. Potts hit his chest.
Tony took out paper from his pocket. “I wrote letters back,” he announced, “I just couldn’t send them either.”
Bucky was already out of his seat looking over Steve’s eye with a soft growl. Maybe he wasn’t 100% sane like Tony had been starting to believe. “Yeah that,” Steve agreed a little nervously setting down a book bag, “I was walking straight home, but then I found a dog running out by himself so I returned him home, and then when I was walking back I found this dude harassing these two Muslim girls and well he just wouldn’t back off Buck.”
The girl's eyes widened further. “Rebecca get out of here,” the manager yelled, “I’m sick of hearing about this guy whenever he messes with someone.”
Bucky just grinned. Natasha arrived next plopping herself into Bucky’s lap and started complaining in rapid Russian. They banter for a moment before Steve butted in and they glare something fierce, except for Sam whose face was scrunched like he didn't have the same grasp on the language as they did. “This is bullshit,” Sam decided, “how am I supposed to keep up with your super serums brain.”
Peter whined but he was delirious. Cho rushes into the room. “The fever is stabilized,” Natasha told her, “but it hasn’t gone down.”
Wanda offered him Nathaniel who Fury cooed at the baby taking him, but his eyes stayed on Wanda. “Don’t be afraid to give your old man some trouble. He deserves it,” Fury decided finally.
The thing is if I went to you now all I would be able to do is break down and scream because I hate you so much I love you, but I have no idea who you really are. I can’t come to you because I’m afraid of who you are. But at the same time I want to know the real you desperately. I don’t think we can work out our issues until I work out my own, so until then screw you and live well.
“His stomach can’t process meat so he’s a vegetarian,” Sam said instead, “and make sure you don’t touch him without asking first. He’s had...a real rough time with a lot of men.”
Peter sympathized with the look of panic on Sam’s face and gave him a nod of solidarity. They showed Sam his new house and when Wanda left to go over to Clint’s to help Laura with the kids Sam turned on Tony and Peter. “So who adopted Wanda now and why is it a secret? I mean is this like the nice thing?”
Loki could use this nervous energy Sam had against him. Act like a wounded bird and let Sam fix him. He had done that countless times. But with the Grandmaster that has backfired on him. Loki shuddered to think of how badly that had failed. No, he couldn’t do that now. He couldn’t.
“White button-down shirt under the sweater with the color out, and blue jeans. We’ve talked about this,” Shuri demanded
Loki nodded and slipped away. Sam waited a few seconds before following him. From the kitchen, Sam heard Loki squeal and Natasha soft rumbling in Russian. “Oh Lo. You’ve changed. Let me look at you.”
Steve sat at the kitchen table sketching, watching as Bucky slowly cleaned his knives for the fifteenth time this morning. Neither of them had slept last night. Well neither of them need much sleep, to begin with because if the serum, but this was different. They were kept awake by nightmares. Sam said super soldier PTSD was different than regular soldier PTSD, but whatever.
The three men laughed. Sam rubbed his face. “We can talk about that later. Thor has his hands full with his people right now or whatever, it would do Loki a lot better to experience being around people who aren’t going to hurt, belittle, or distrust him. He obviously doesn’t trust Thor. Here might be the best place for him.”
Bucky sighed and Sam removed his hand. “You’re so whipped,” Tony noted as they walked up the stairs.
“This is too confusing to figure out in one night,” Clint decided, “we’re not going to learn anything until he’s stable. Our best option is to help get him there.”
Tony rolled his eyes again. “Natalie talk to Banner and make him give me my coffee back,” Tony demanded.
Loki arrived in the kitchen his hair wet and neatly braided back as Sam finished up with breakfast. He was wearing a green button up shirt with a black skirt and sat with a fluid grace that was anything but natural. Sam set a plate down in front of him. “Did you pick those clothes out?”
Bucky shrugged. “Sam calls them fidgets, but yeah a lot of them are like puzzles. It’ll probably hold your attention for a bit. He said some people with ADHD. I dunno though. Just that we have the bin available and it helps some people.”
Wanda laughed. Peter was everything. He stopped his rambling as soon as she did his eyes wide and shining full of awkwardness, anxiety, and hope. She reached forward and ruffled his hair. “Please be my younger brother,” she requested.
Sometimes it amazed Sam how easily they joked about Bucky’s missing memories but then again the pair was fucking weird to begin with.
Wanda felt a warm hand grasp her shoulder and she turned to look. Rhodey was there. “Hey,” he greeted softly, “let’s get in the car ok?”
Tony rubbed his face. “Alright so trying to force him to stop is a bad idea, I can’t stop so I can’t imagine an impulsive teenager could.”
“Kids,” Steve answered without hesitation, “they’re starting to let guys like Bucky and I legally adopt. Not easily, but that’s progress right?”
The dancing seemed to relax Loki more than anything ever and he freely hummed dancing around the kitchen helping to cook lunch. He chatted softly asking Natasha about Midgardian ballet and wondering if Tony had any books about dance in his library. It was good to see him so relaxed and open.
Peter tapped his chemistry book and watched Clint throw together a-fifth sandwich because according to him Wanda was always too skinny. Frankly, the last few weeks had been hilarious because Peter saw what had happened to him happening to Wanda.
Tony supposed that summed up Bucky to an extent. “I suppose it’s about expression,” Bucky added, “I wasn’t allowed to be anything that I was and now I can, and it helps me to remember that if I can show other people. That I’m real and I’m a person.”
Ned would have cracked by now, but Mj was Mj no matter how scary the Black Widow was Mj would kill him if he cracked. She had said so. So Ned was not going to crack. Nope, not going to crack. He was just going to keep his head in his hands so he couldn’t mess this up.
Sam didn’t both to reply. Natasha’s phone chirped. “Darcy and Jane are back,” she announced and then added, “Loki and I picked out some clothes online this morning and I had them get those as well. I’m going to go help them unpack.”
The days faded into weeks. Loki and Peter got closer and closer with Wanda tagging along at their side whenever she was able, and Shuri when she came to visit. As a result, Tony and Clint gave up their leftover animosity to the demigod. Which made Laura happy since Loki was very good with her kids and was always happy to babysit, not like any of the other Avengers weren’t happy to do so as well. Tony built a dance studio in the rec center claiming it was for Natasha, but everyone knew it was for Loki. Tony would sometimes sneak in and watch the boy dance. He was still perplexed at how the boy was the same demigod as the one who destroyed part of New York, but that didn’t matter anymore.
Pepper beamed. “He’s going to come to the tower four days of the school week one day he’ll work with me and the other three Tony is going to be with him and on Friday Happy is going to drive him to the compound after school and every other Saturday. It’ll be great for training and getting to know the others.”
“Our argument wasn’t really about the Accords. We were both at a bad place in our lives and the Accords was the realization of all the issues we hadn’t taken care of. Like I said before it’s been a lot of therapy for us.”
No. Bucky had been the one to cook when Steve’s Mom passed and with so much to learn about the future there hadn’t been much time to learn how besides a few simple things.
Sam didn’t answer looking away. “What do you mean you aren’t coming home,” she exclaimed, “I did not give you to the army for those years to not get you back home on the holidays.”
Tony laughed. He knew he shouldn’t but he did. “What are you laughing at Stank,” Rhodey asked from the couch.
Steve grinned at him while Alex and Dax roared with laughter. “Lo, you wound me. First the eggplant and now this,” Bucky snickered.
Tony started to make a list about the things he knew about Steve Rogers because he was a genius and this was how genius learned to deal with people obviously.
Bucky was about to reply when his phone chirped. He slid his knife away and answered it. The halo projection came up and he could see Shuri sitting at her desk. “Hey,” she greeted not looking away from her computer, “when did you beat my level?”
Steve made a delightful little sound and muted the television. Two hours later they were in their civilian clothes. Steve watched Bucky check his Twitter as he texted Tony.
Steve nodded. “I’m helping Sam stress bake,” he offered with a shrug, but that made Loki laughed as well.
All the questions they had was answered that night as Pepper was getting ready for Bed and Tony was obsessing over Bucky's Twitter. Apparently, Bucky had a sister who was about ninety and still alive somehow, who they were staying with for the night.
Sam’s mother called at ten. “Are you on your plane yet,” she demanded, “where’s my Lo? How is he? You better be here by twelve.”
“Peter, this is Shuri Princess of Wakanda and their head of technical developments. She’s the one who got rid of the Winter Soldier programming and made me this arm. Shuri that’s Peter Parker in the flesh.”
“Sam you’ve been getting random texts that make you grin all month, we’re happy for you,” Dax stated, “so when do we get to meet the lucky guy?”
What Sam did know was that if someone were to react badly to Sam Loki would do everything he could to help Sam, and Sam didn’t want to know what that looked like.
Gideon got up and pulled Sam and Janie into his arms. Gideon’s eyes searched his and he suddenly tensed. “Rylie,” Sarah exclaimed beating their brother to the mark.
Tony dropped his wrench. “How dare you,” he spat waving a finger at the super soldier, “who owns movies anymore? Get to the future Cap we stream things now. Jesus! You know what order a pizza if you can figure it out. We’re watching the Incredibles.  F.R.I.D.A.Y cue up Incredibles.”
“Ned and I were doing a research project in sixth grade about Captain America and we got really confused as to why there’s no public record of any letter he wrote. So three days latter Ned and I are neck deep in conspiracy theories and looking at letters that Bucky wrote to his mom, and the more we read them the more we realize that they were tampered with so we started to search for the originals and we found a place with copies of the originals and Bucky asks his mom to look after Steve like all the time and his mom says that Steve wrote him every day. So Ned hacks like every government agency he can think of until we find the letters. And we spend like three more days trying to figure it all past the government cover-up and crap and then we leaked it to conspiracy theory sites ‘cause hacking is illegal folks.”
Everyone but Peter paused. “Or what about the week before when he stumbled into a bookshelf in the library, or the day before that when Clint turned his back for five seconds at the shooting range and Loki accidentally stabbed himself with an arrow. Or when he got bored when Sam was at work and Natasha was gone and Bucky and Steve were doing an interview so he was alone for twenty minutes got bored somehow wandered into Dad’s lab and he glued all the screwdrivers down to the table? Or Jane was supposed to be with him, but she turned away after showing him a Rube Goldberg machine online and he got curious and made on in the living room.”
“Did you know that there is a vigilante in Queens?” Steve asked skipping over that entire conversation.
“Hey,” Rhodey protested, “we’ve talked about this self-deprecation junk. Not better, just different.”
He handed the phone back and started to google using his holograms. Steve let Tony watch a few more videos. “So why are you bringing this guy to me. It looks like he has it figured out,” Tony questioned, but Steve knew that the genius was hooked.
It turns out Peter and Shuri got along better than she had hoped. They texted every day and when she called Bucky she was beaming instead of looking steadily disinterested or like she was about to fuck someone over. Instead, she looked joyful, smiling softly and her wit was still sharp, but the playfulness didn’t hide any bitterness.
Five hours later Peter was resting peacefully in a hospital bed his fever slowly going down. Cho and Natasha were sitting by his bed and Wanda was updating the team about his condition. And Tony was basically having a panic attack across the world. Natasha had spent the last hour and a half getting him to calm down.
Tony had seen Steve around gay couples and his eyes had burned with such fire, but sometimes Tony caught Steve giving him lustful looks. It pissed Tony off because he couldn’t tell if Steve was secretly homophobic or had a secret crush on him and he was a genius so he should be able to figure it out, but he couldn’t. And as they sat on the couch together after months of wondering Tony finally gave in to his curiosity and lust. Consequences be damned.
The bar is going well. You wouldn’t believe how many pairs come one dressed up at us, I’m sure you would get a kick out of it, but I can’t see you helping us run this place either. Still, the door is always open to you. It’s not like anyone could prove you showed up.
“Sam in all your letters home you mentioned Rylie and in all of our video calls Rylie was there and Rylie is the only thing you won’t talk about with anyone, it wasn’t rocket science,” Sarah pointed out.
Thor shrugged. “My sister I didn’t know about came out of banishment and tried to take over Asgard. I was sent to the plane of Sakaar and found Bruce and my brother! We returned to Asgard to valiantly save it, but we had to destroy Asgard in order to destroy Hela. But my people are safe and we are now refugees. I left them in the care of Valkyrie, Brunhilde. I have returned to seek your help and to return Banner!”
Wanda felt the fear and confusion she had at the other colleges, the people here were not so easily tricked as they had been in France. Not when she lost all five Scarlet Witch look-alike contest. It would take getting used to but she could do it.
Peter bounced up and down on his bed flipping back and forth watching R5 put together sentence fragments. His door opened. “Peter, Pepper is making lasagna tonight are you staying over? If you are you need to call May and have you finished your homework yet,” Tony rambled.
“No, they are hanging out with this girl Michelle now. It’s kind of weird and it’s more like she has decided to exist in their space, but it works.”
“Kat King,” Tony exclaimed understanding that much of what the former assassin had said, “why isn’t he with his bae?”
Peter nodded with a squeak. Natasha slit open the wrapping with her thumb and opened the box. Inside was a Lego replica of herself. “My Friend Ned and I made it for you! She’s crossing her arms because she’s mad at everyone else for being so dumb.”
Steve once told Sam that the best thing about his big body was that he was big enough to hold Bucky. Now with Loki Sam understood. As Sam held Loki he began to think of something he could take Loki out to do. Nothing extraneous or full of people. Which didn’t really help because Loki’s likes came down to reading, magic, any kind of theater, and gardening. They could just go for a drive, but Sam didn’t want to drag Loki around without some kind of pay off. If it went bad with no positive pay off that wouldn’t do well for anyone. Especially Loki.
Soon Christmas came. Sam took Loki to meet Rylie’s mother who doted on him much to Loki’s pleasure and they visited his family on Christmas Eve, but on Christmas they were home, with Natasha singing in the living room while Sam baked in the kitchen, Steve was drawing the fireplace while Bucky and Loki played the board game Peter gave Loki for Christmas in front of it. It was a very good day.
Wanda threw the pillow away and bolted up. And there Clint stood at the edge of her bed with his stupid grin and a tray of breakfast that he slid onto the coffee table as she launched herself at him with a cry. He laughed catching her. “What are you doing here,” she cried pulling back.
Janie’s jaw dropped. “But I looked at the records for that day and you weren’t on that list,” she protested.
Considering the fact that she had texted him three hours ago asking if Peter would be there when she arrived Tony would say yes. “I don’t see why she wouldn’t.”
That’s how Steve first meet Peter and Steve didn’t think he would ever forgive Tony for that, but that was just one thing to add to the list.
Like the accords was a minor argument. “It was a lot of not communicating and a few things that were kept hidden.”
Thor jerked away disgust written on his face. “You think I want that,” he demanded rising to his feet.
The point is take care of your kid before Rodgers decides to come out of hiding and do it himself. That’s going to be a worse fight than your break up.
Instead, I woke up in the Chitauri’s hands. They did not have the spell to keep me tied to them, but they had the Mind Stone. They held it for millions of years and were well versed in its ways. When I had been there the first time I had learned it as well. They told me they wanted me to take over Midgard for them. A smaller unguarded virgin planet, but too far for their ships to reach in a beneficial time.”
“Vis is traveling around Uganda right now,” Wanda added rolling her eyes, “I think it’s one of his favorite countries. And my Dads are cooking dinner I think.”
Sam snatched his phone back and tapped on the picture shoving it back in their faces. “Oh,” Dax stated, “so it’s an actual eggplant.”
Sam wasn’t sure what that was about so he ignored it. Instead, he enjoyed the gentle day with Loki. That night Sam watched Loki’s breath rise and fall in his room sound asleep.
After the finished breakfast, Sam plus Loki with the blanket made their way out of the house. “We can walk or we can ride over,” Sam informed Loki who only shrugged.
“Get it off,” Steve ordered Tony knowing he would get the job done so he could take care of Bucky, “I’m taking him out.”
Steve didn’t anything because he knew she didn’t want him to. Steve was a good listener. Even when he wasn’t listening at all. He would never tell anyone’s secrets.
Lo looked like he wanted to argue, but he kept his focus on Sam. Sam leaned down looking at the board, making a large show of it. “Let me guess, green?”
Which Steve rolled his eyes at and opened his unused Twitter account to repost it. Bucky was a brat and he would get him back for the Mr. America jibe. Steve took a photo of Bucky sleeping on their bed that night and said:
Sam didn’t say anything. “He thinks highly of you Sam,” Natasha admitted, “you’re doing the right thing.”
Bucky sighed. They were terrible judging his fashion choices making him change his outfit. If it was just Sam he would have flipped him off and while Shuri was happy to flip anyone off Who mildly annoyed her he wasn’t going to endorse those bad habits around her. So he went back to his room and changed again.
Sam slowly spun Natasha as the music faded and was rewarded with a breathless laugh. She released him and set the French toast on the table. Sam divided up their bacon and followed her to the table. “I didn’t recognize that dance,” Loki announced a frown on his lips but his eyes were sparkling.
Steve sighed and looked down at his fiancé. “A year ago,” he admitted, “I would have made it work. But Tony’s not Peggy, and Bucky and I aren’t the same guys from back then. It’s messy Sam real messy. Maybe in a few years after we've all settled down, but...”
Natasha was back in a minute, pale and with the book Thor had brought and none of them had thought of touching. “What is up with sucky people and books,” she demanded setting it down on the coffee table.
The tray dropped. “Oh my god,” she squeaked, “I’m so sorry, but I can’t believe someone is calling him out on his shit! I hope he gets them.”
The men came tromping up. Sam held his breath waiting to see if Loki would react negatively. He didn't even look overwhelmed. Thank god the Avengers were crazy. “When did you get a kid,” Rubert demanded looking down at Loki.
Both drunk men yelped and followed Steve inside. The music was pounding so loud it’s almost felt like his skull was on fire, and all the lights were blinding, but the air was clean. There was a stage for a band, we’re currently couples were grinding against each other next to dancing Drag Queens as the DJ played.
“Sam tells me I have PTSD, depression, maybe separation anxiety, and a handful of character defects and poor coping mechanisms that all lead to behavioral issues that make me a handful,” Loki chuckled, “apparently I need attention or I’ll get into trouble.”
When the morning light drifted into the bedroom Loki turned his head to see Sam sitting on the ground leaning against the bed sleeping. Loki turned over and tapped the top of his head. “Bucky I’m going to slap you,” Sam groaned, “and if you make that Toy Story joke again about your arm I’ll slap you with it.”
Two kids ran out of the bar holding hands looking high on love. Bucky and Sam stopped their bickering. “Want me to call a cab,” Bucky asked them.
Which didn’t make a ton of sense to anyone, but Bucky, but the internet lost their shit anyways. Bucky had tagged everyone and Tony, Natasha, and Clint had reposted it on their own accounts so everyone following them was now following Bucky which was ridiculous. But shit happens, Tony was not jealous of Bucky's instant popularity.
Loki took the jewelry out of the box. They were composed of silver snakes intertwined small flowers for scales and green emerald eyes. He turned them over and felt his throat tighten. “I mean we all did a little something, Rhodey and Bruce argued for three days if bracelets were a good idea or not,” Natasha added, “but Sam he had the engravings done.”
After lunch, Sam showed Loki around his house excluding the room he had prepared for him. “It’s lovely,” Loki stated, “but it appears empty.”
