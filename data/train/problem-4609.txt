"Why not?" asked Gabriel. For all he looked relaxed and unrepentant there was a spark missing from his eyes. He was worried too. "We handled it. Didn't even break anything."
The Angel watched him, a bit taken aback. He waited until he thought he could be heard to ask, “Did I not answer appropriately?”
As Dean pulled his coat back into place Castiel faced his mother, eyes hard. “What’s it to you? I’ve broken no other covenants. The only fate you can legally hand down is banishment, and I won’t contend that. What more to this is there?”
Dean would have kept probing, but that was when they left the trees. Castiel lead the way towards the base of a low mountain, the area before it mostly dirt and stone. The cave's entrance was large, plenty big enough to accommodate a dragon, and at a slight upward angle. A handy feature for keeping out rain and damp.
“I know my mother. Her maternal instincts are minimal. Gabriel has been dancing the line between son and disowned disgrace since he learned to speak full sentences. I have only been spared this long because it was easier to keep my mouth shut and avoid her than deal with constant conflict. I’ve simply reached the point where I’m no longer willing to endure her. I’m sorry.”
“Who said I do?” His eyes widened slightly, and he snapped his fingers. “Oh, almost forgot. I got something for you.”
When Castiel was satisfied with that, they moved on to jerky. Then to trail mix and dried fruit. Only when Castiel was satisfied that they were stocked on the proper fuel for tomorrow did he agree to head to the checkout. He didn’t always join Dean on these grocery runs, particularly since he only seemed to annoy his husband, but this was something he needed to have a say in. If Dean was left to the task he’d come back with travel packs of cookies, every single flavor of jerky they had in stock, and little else.
He didn’t answer right away, going back to his work. As he stirred in the mix of thick fluids Castiel thought aloud.
Initially, when Dean led her out of her stall, she eyed Castiel like she was trying to decide if a bite or a kick might be better. Her nostrils flared, her head rearing back as she gave a quiet squeal, jerking up against the reins Dean still held, ears pricking forward, tail swishing as she stomped a front hoof.
“It’ll be just like the park. Don’t think about it too much. Besides, it’ll be fun. When me and Sammy did this, it got a lot of love.”
That posting, meant to be a punishment when Michael had gotten his sense of propriety bruised by Dean being right when he’d been wrong, had turned out to be a blessing. He had had far too much time on his hands and a great deal of energy leftover after a shift. But if anyone asked it had been dreadful and he’d learned his lesson.
“I tried to find you. When you were born your soulmark appeared on my arm. I searched for you, but my own kind interfered. Eventually someone was able to get me penal duty in purgatory. The only reason I was able to leave was because I’d managed to earn enough favors to get myself out.”
Castiel turned his best deadpan expression to the camera. “Three times since I have been romantically attached to this person, he has walked out of a grocery store having cleared out every single pumpkin pie and every single can of whipped cream currently on their shelves. They had to make announcements over the P.A. system to announce the terrible news. People wailed. Clothes were torn.”
Rather than try stepping inside, knowing the wards wouldn’t allow it, he grabbed the hunter by the collar and yanked him outside. “You know exactly what I’m talking about. Alistair had you torture and kill a Knight of Hell. You were given a curse to do so. I would like the antidote, if you please.”
Benny gave him an incredulous look. “Come on, chief, you ain’t that dense. Name anyone else, besides demons, that could pull something like that off.”
When he was close enough to see his nest Castiel slowed his pace, allowing the Alpha to finally catch up. In seconds he was tackled to the ground, a triumphant snarl in his ears, hot breath panting against his shoulder. He expected to be pinned down and fucked there and then. His three previous encounters had begun as such, and everyone he'd spoken to on the matter had told of virtually identical experiences.
He took his hand away, fingers still glistening. He rocked up on his knees, crawling up higher so he was positioned over Castiel’s hips instead of his thighs. He got a bit more lube on his fingers, spreading it over the Angel’s cock.
Castiel watched the movie. And its successor. By that point not only was he a bit miffed at Dean for his crack, which seemed to exasperate the Demon, he was hooked on the universe those movies were set in. He was delighted to find there were many more where those had come from, even though it might take a while for him to watch them all.
Dean balked at the entirety of that statement, particularly the word ‘beautiful’, but before he could object Castiel was leaning forward. The human’s eyes widened as warm, chapped lips pressed gently over his, and he froze, staring at the seraph when he pulled away to study his face. He was faintly aware of his beer hitting the linoleum, but neither of them so much as twitched.
Before he could finish the motion John was snatching up the papers again, thrusting them into his face. "Sam's walking out, that's what."
Generally that shade of orange meant it was spicy, so Castiel got out the yogurt, bread, and milk. Dean liked spicy things. He’d gotten a taste for it himself, even gotten to where he only ate twice as much yogurt as Dean instead of four times as much.
“You can share, you know,” Hanna protested, blushing at the kiss that had been planted on her cheek.
Considering they'd changed course in a rage, this new brand of life suited them oddly well. Sam was happier than he'd ever been as a full time hunter, he was doing well in school, and he'd become fond of a pretty blond Beta. Dean still got to drive around killing things and saving people, working with other hunters on occasion if he needed backup, and he had someplace solid to come home to. Castiel liked the regularity and simple satisfaction that came with his job, as well as the flexibility of being able to join his mate on hunts. They hadn't heard a word from John since that day, but according to Bobby he was alive and well, still maintaining the family business on his end.
Blushing, Dean tried to protest. Mostly because Sam and Bobby had, by some miracle, slept through their tramping in and out the front door. In the end Castiel agreed to postpone his reward until the house was empty. How else was Dean supposed to fully appreciate it when he displayed his enthusiasm and awe?
As he turned, picking up the bowl of potion he’d now have to discard, Dean asked, “Is it because you know Sam?”
at 4:00a.m. Whether or not you remembered the exact time was often dependent on the person. Some didn’t care, ignoring or outright forgetting that moment in time. Others had it memorized from an early age. He hadn’t told anyone, but Dean had set an alarm that morning when the clock turned over and he’d turned thirteen years old. The only reason Sam knew was because they’d shared a room at the time, he’d heard the alarm go off. Dean had wanted to be awake for that special moment, silly though he felt it was.
The gas station was on the edge of town, just before the exit most cars took to the nearest interstate. Dean pulled up to a pump, getting out to fill Baby's tank as Sam went inside the shop. Castiel hesitated when he had both feet on cement, not following the younger Alpha right away.
Choosing not to go poking at a raw wound, instead of asking after Castiel he drawled, “No thanks to you. The hell took you so long?
It took a great deal of self-control to keep from just banging his own head against the nearest painted cinderblock wall. He wasn’t sure HOA was the right label, but there was a portion of rent that went to things like building upkeep and all that shit. Frankly he’d rather not pay it until someone got his sink fixed in less than eight days, but apparently this was one of the suckier parts of adulting. Dealing with shitty landlords. Maybe he wouldn’t have put up with it for the better part of three years, but there was nowhere else this close to campus with rent this cheap.
“Well, yeah. I mean look at it. It don’t look anything like anything else on the damn planet, and it
"No, you're not," Dean was quick to assure him. He rubbed the back of his neck, smiling sheepishly. Considering he ran the business he looked no different than his own mechanics, clad in coveralls with the sleeves rolled up, sweaty and dirty from the hands-on work. "Listen, I uh, I never mentioned you to anyone. And I don't just mean you being a...”
Whatever he'd expected, it wasn't a kiss that made his head swim. Dragons and humans were alike in that regard, he knew. Alphas always marked their Omegas, it was what triggered a mating. But not always did the Omega mark their Alpha in turn. Some Alphas grew angry at the very suggestion, as it implied a level of equality in the relationship. Castiel was delighted to realize Dean was not such an Alpha.
Humans were the most common of the species walking the planet, but in total they made up roughly fifty percent of the worldwide population. That meant he’d just knocked out half of all prospects. Once you whittled it down to non-humans who had feathered wings, you had even fewer. At the same time, this made even less sense. There weren’t many who fit into that category as a species, but any linguistic connections he’d made had not led him to believe he’d be dealing with wings. At best maybe a shifter or a dragon, but not a siren or a phoenix.
What members of his squadron that had come to aid in the battle, most of them now, all stared at him with some mix of horror and dismay.
Any questions, comments, or concerns are welcome. I love the feedback, and it's always a pleasure to hear from my readers.
Castiel opened his mouth, but all that came out was a low hiss as he felt a hostile force crash into his wards. His head jerked towards the impact, eyes narrowing. “She’s here,” he growled, slowly rising to his feet.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “In addition to your guilty pleasure, you often join me for Game of Thrones, for example. But yes, he does prefer movies. Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, most Westerns. You have a diverse pallet.”
Black eyes blinked slowly, returning to their eerily human green. Tilting his head back to stare up through a narrow gap in the trees, the Demon said in a low voice, “Good.”
Gabriel shifted his sucker from one side of his mouth to the other, hands thrust into his jacket pockets. Out of all the wonders humans had made over the years, their confections were among his favorites. Right up there with the marvels of indoor plumping.
“Broken record, Cas,” Benny interjected wearily. He was half interested to see if either would balk at his barrowing Dean’s nickname for the angel. They didn’t seem to. Maybe others had used it on the outside, then.
Castiel glanced up from where he was pouring a slow stream of hawthorn and rosemary puree into his bubbling potion.
If a pin dropped, you could have heard it. Castiel positioned himself between his family and his mother, shifting his shield to act as a second layer of protection over Gabriel’s, which now included everyone except Castiel himself. Never had he been so glad he’d taken to carrying his power-retention crystals. One he’d poured strength into for six solid months was currently hanging in a pouch around his neck, under his clothes, and it was playing battery to every magical working he performed.
Stumbling to class was a pain, even worse than when he’d been hung over in times past. Every sound grated on his nerves, even the rumble of his beloved Impala. Never had he thought in a million years that Baby’s purr would be unwelcome. He had curtains and blinds for his tall windows in his apartment, but this was the first time he used all of them even in daylight. Anything brighter than a low light made his eyes pound.
When they did part Castiel found himself breathless. He took some solace in seeing Dean was in a similar state. The Alpha's lips were swollen, his eyes smoldering in a fashion that robbed Castiel of what little breath he'd regained. Enough that he didn't protest when Dean lowered his face he obligingly tilted his head to allow the Alpha access to his neck. He didn't even know why, though it did feel good. Having Dean's mouth on his scent glands, kissing, suckling, nuzzling, nibbling.
I am open to question requests! I will only use them if I feel I can do them justice but I love to hear from my readers!
“I told you, Mother. Perhaps it is the hormones. Perhaps it is the fact I am damned regardless of what I do at this point. But I am tired of catering to your fragile ego and archaic ideals. There will be no convincing you you’re wrong, so please pass your sentence so we can be on our way.”
“Yes, in the heat of the moment. In hindsight I pity it. More so than the other vermin that hitched a ride on that tree.”
The third and final thing Benny was absolutely sure of was that there was something truly profound between the human and his angel. Whatever they’d been through was earth-shattering. It had to be, given the circumstances. He hadn’t asked. He was curious, though. Perhaps once they’d found her he’d finally get to hear their story. Though likely as not it wouldn’t be until they were out of Purgatory, which was fine with him. Even a vampire had to have his priorities.
Castiel blinked owlishly. He didn’t lower his weapon or relax his stance, but he did take an extra moment to study this Demon’s face. They seemed…familiar. Normally this was bad, he preferred to slay old foes before they learned his ways. But he didn’t think it was that kind of familiar. That being said, what else was there?
"I wanted to help and display support. You mentioned you were planning on making a trip to resupply part of your stockpile tonight and it helps to have a second set of hands. I would like to accompany you."
Turning to the camera, Castiel explained, “He had his heart set on getting this big screen TV, and this one store had a really good sell on it. This was back when we had to save up for things, we’d already graduated college and we had work, but we were at the bottom of our respective totem poles. We had a slightly better apartment, but we were still using the same poorly constructed, cheap furniture we’d had before. At the time the table our old TV was on could barely hold it, and only because it was small.”
Castiel might have objected being confined to the space, however comfortable, but Dean took care of him. When he was thirsty he'd be brought water or sweet wine, when he was hungry the Alpha cooked for him. Once he'd even found the Dragon's small horde of things that his Omega side favored. Bolts of soft fabrics, a few shiny trinkets, sealed containers of candies, and jars of scented oils. He'd selected Castiel's favorite of the oils, then proceeded to give the Omega a massage from head to toe.
Castiel ran his thumb over the mug’s surface, glancing back at Dean before focusing his attention on John. He tried to remember back over the videos, what was said, what stories were told. Would any of them set him off? Or perhaps encourage him to be reasonable? The first video’s questions had been primarily directed at him, but the second time their questions had been more about the relationship. So was the third. Perhaps it was that they were doing well? That they were shockingly normal? As far as he could tell they were downright boring in many cases.
“What good is a Slayer who doesn’t slay?” quipped the chieftain. “You confirmed that there is a dragon out there, correct?”
"Look, uh, this is great. I'm glad the whole family reunion thing is awesome, but we gatta go. Cas?"
“I wouldn’t call it sitting pretty. It was relationship counseling,” Castiel argued. “Which we both benefited from. We owe them a great deal. They even gave me quarters for a payphone.”
“You’ll wake up once we get walking,” Castiel reminded him, turning the lens forward again as they rolled through the gates.
Midway through the week Castiel was making his way through town, picking up some things after he’d sent Charlie and Balthazar to school, when he left the bookshop and almost ran directly into Naomi. He gave a start, genuinely shocked to see her there. As usual his mother was impeccably dressed in modern clothing, a pale blue pantsuit over a white button down, her hair drawn back into an immaculate bun.
Dean raked a hand back through his hair, wincing as it tugged his stitches. “Forget it. We’ll talk about this later.”
He left it at that. When he descended the stairs to Dean’s basement. Once down there he found a table with a clear space and set the necklace down atop it. Then he began removing things from inner pockets in his trench coat, setting small vials and a few jars out in a line. There were nearly a dozen when he was done. A little poking around produced a mason jar, which he rinsed out and dried.
The Demon grabbed the gun, taking the knuckles as Castiel dragged him out the door. Gripping his shoulder, Castiel teleported them to the gate. He made sure to land outside it, facing the warded border, hoping to come up behind the attacking force.
Castiel lowered his weapon, returning it to the inside of his coat with unsteady fingers. "Sam. What's wrong?"
By the grace of one deity or another, they managed to get satisfaction out of that position before Samandriel woke up. Castiel was sprawled over the Alpha, head on his chest, Dean’s fingers idly stroking his hair, their legs tangled together as they caught their breath and just enjoyed each other’s presence. The Omega was actually being tempted with a nap of his own when an all too familiar sound made him crack an eye with a reluctant groan.
Deciding he had nothing to lose, Castiel straightened and allowed his grace to show. One of the first tricks they were taught was to channel it through a ring over their heads, to illuminate their surroundings without blinding themselves or blotting out things just out of reach. Simple, but very practical. He’d thought it funny, when he heard humans had caught some of his siblings while they were using this trick. It was a source of amusement, that they’d named this trick ‘halo’ and deemed it a sign of something holy. If only they knew of all the battlefields they lit, of all the illicit activities they’d illuminated over millennia. Before electricity, if you wanted to see your lover in a post-sunset rendezvous it was your least risky option.
. Granted he wasn’t the sort of person Dean had seen himself settling down with, but then things changed when you were out of the oppressive environment of high school. Back when he was the Omega who was stretched between studying and taking care of Sammy and getting in as many hours as Bobby would let him. Back when they were technically under John’s care, before their surrogate father had adopted them and refused to let Dean do more than part-time work while in school. He’d block out the ridicule of other students by day, generally barbs tossed at an Omega who hardly fit the traditional stereotype, and at night he’d dodge John as best he could. He’d been aware of the Alpha who hung around the fringe of things, the one with black painted nails and eyeliner who snuck smoke breaks on the school roof. That was how he’d met Castiel, he’d found the roof was a good place to hide from tormenters and get school work done. The Alpha hadn’t sent him away, and they’d spent hours in mutual silence.
Dean stuck a hand in front of the vents. “It’s getting there. I think Mom threw some hot cocoa in the snack cooler.”
When John didn’t protest, Castiel carefully perched on the couch at Dean’s side. He waited in silence, which stretched on a bit as they focused on drinking their respective cups of coffee. Eventually Dean cleared his throat an asked, “Was there something you wanted to talk about or did you just want to sit around taking up space?”
"Because I'm proud of him. Your father wouldn't let him go on hunts and now he won't let him do anything else. He's being smart about it, he's not just rushing into this with no preparation."
The Omega grimaced. "A few thought I would make a suitable mate, and I always disagreed. Thanks to them I had to leave more than one culture early. I hate being run off by an Alpha who believes themselves entitled to me, but I couldn't stay. Very few cultures honor an Omega's wish to turn down a propositioning Alpha. If I settle down it will be with a mate of my choosing." He quirked his head to one side and asked, "Were you trying to see if I'd give away the locations of less pleasant dragons?"
Castiel gazed at the human standing before him, someone he'd known less than a day without hormones clouding their minds. Yet he was offering so much so easily. The Omega found himself unable to grasp the words, so instead he stepped forward and took Dean's face in his hands. He didn't need the physical contact to initiate a telepathic link, but he wanted to in this case, particularly since he wasn't going to ask this time.
It was easier to think about that than going to a gynecologist. He wasn’t looking forward to allowing someone besides a healer or Dean to go poking around down there. If it wasn’t for the health of his pup, and getting suppressants more effective than sterility tea, he was willing to go through with it. Their birth control was better, chances of ‘accidents’ were next to zero, but as he understood it the proper suppressants could reduce the symptoms even more than Tessa’s tea.
Dean, who was making taquitos, shrugged and went back to his work. Guacamole and other delights most humans associated with South America were already on the table. Castiel dropped the lube in the bedroom, then went to help himself. He was crunching on a very loaded down chip when Dean set the last of the dishes on the table, plopping down across from him.
John had his hands shoved into his jacket pockets, eyeing Castiel with an expression he couldn’t quite place. It occurred to him very briefly that he was still wearing a pair of boxers covered in Star Wars logos and a gray undershirt, his feet bare. Likely his hair was still standing all over the place, and he needed a shave. Hardly the standard for ‘presentable’. Then he resolved that anyone who arrived unannounced would have to deal with the consequences, particularly this individual.
Just to be sure, Dean reached over to roll up his left sleeve, exposing his forearm. Those symbols still glowed softly, but it faded a bit once he stuck it under the harsh light. He turned a few more pages, scanning each one carefully, looking for any letter or symbol that might be close to those of his soulmark.
“I don’t know,” Dean groaned. “I didn’t have that many lines, but I wanted to be on the stage crew. I specifically said I didn’t want the part. There were plenty of other kids to choose from, but
"May I speak with you, Dean? All I ask is that you hear me out. After that you may do with me what you wish."
“Let them be the judge of that,” his husband stated, motioning to the camera. “And you’re totally at liberty to say no.”
Castiel turned the camera over in his hands as Dean pulled into a parking space. “Yes. Are you sure about this?”
In a desperate attempt to keep that from happening, Castiel gave a sharp flap, trying to reach Abaddon before she could launch an attack of her own. He should have known better. She was almost as fast as him. Fast enough she turned to face him at the last minute, blade slicing into his left arm right before a boot to the chest sent him flying backwards.
For his part, Castiel had had enough. And seeing as Dean could not storm out as he had nowhere to storm to, he stalked for the door. “I need some air, when I return I’m bringing cement with me” he bit out, wrenching it open and slamming it on his heels.
Slowly, Dean dragged himself upright, narrowed eyes not leaving the person before him. “That ain’t what I’m talking about. Where the fuck have you been? What the fuck even
It had started small, just breaking in so he could get some pictures to work off of. Then he decided that such valuable antiquities deserved better than their current owners. Then one of those collectors had stiffed Benny at the shop, and one thing had led to another. The next thing Dean knew, he was breaking into an antique shop to remove an orihon style Japanese text from a very secure safe.
"The road is no place for this, you know that. The only reason you boys got into this life was because there wasn't another choice. Do you really want to drag an helpless Omega into this?"
“You would let me drive the Impala to school and back? On roads heavily populated by teenage drivers?”
When he did, though, he felt a blush warm his face. “I, um, don’t know. I’ve just been taking it one video at a time. I suppose as long as a significant portion of his viewers enjoy my presence….”
Castiel took his sweet time, circling the cabin at a decidedly meandering pace, before going back inside. Dean was fully dressed by then, jeans belted into place, but for some reason he’d felt the need to wear all three of the torso coverings at the same time. Was he cold? Castiel saw no other reason why the Demon had felt the need to layer a t-shirt, then a flannel shirt, then a jacket. Or he’d just wanted to get them fitted with wing slits right now and didn’t feel up to taking them off again. Those could be tricky, for all it became second nature after the first few decades.
Lips curling in a knowing smirk, Gabriel added, “Or how intrigued you were with the brother Knights of Hell.”
Gabriel didn’t comment on that. Instead he returned to normal volume and asked, “Is there a TV in here?”
John shot his oldest son a look. "We need to leave. You can come, for now. I'm not promising anything."
"Yes. Though I'm afraid Balthazar might be a bit like his uncle. He likes to concoct things that are often outside the realm of practical magic."
“How about you drop some info instead? Not like I’ll be able to do anything with it at this point. Those hunters were Men of Letters terriers. The ones that get the good shit.”
Slowly Dean trudged out, making his way upstairs. Castiel returned to his post at the table, taking up his scissors once more. As he worked the shower ran for a while, then after some thumping around Dean went quiet. It was just as well, Castiel had traded shifts to allow time for this but Dean had spent all day in the shop. Not to mention he'd just slogged through a battery of assignments and tests. He would be tired, and if Sam's accounts were correct then it wasn't uncommon for supply runs to last for hours. Seeing as his brother had been his drafted assistant for virtually every run leading up to this point Castiel took his word as gospel.
Castiel studied the menu as he nibbled his soft pretzel, pointing to one of the options that looked most appealing. He deliberately finished his food before he went to the bathroom, using some wet paper towels to clean off most of what remained of the thrown drink. He was still damp when he went back to the table, but far less sticky.
"Look! These are agogo bells, from west Afri, one of the oldest Samba instruments. They're typically used in religious ceremonies. You either knock them together or hit them with the stick. Want to try?"
He was still trying to decide what might make giving up an informant worth it when Dean asked, “What about names of Angels I know inform to other Demons?”
“So here we are, Cas dragged my butt out of bed at o’ dark thirty. And he says he ain’t feeding me again until we get to the third mile marker.”
“You’re going into withdrawal, you look like hammered crap,” Dean protested. How had he been so blind? He blamed his own drug-induced haziness, writing it off as only mild anxiety triggered by an injured mate.
"Dean, I.....I have to....Dean I have to go," he protested between kisses, trying to pull away. Bracing a hand on the Alpha's shoulder he mumbled against his mouth, "We can do more later."
“Regardless of whether or not we retain our immortality we are incapable of birthing Alphas. Only Omegas and female Betas. It’s my understanding many Alphas wish for male children, if not Alpha children. My biology makes that impossible.”
Gabriel managed a bloody smile. “I was leaving. Thought Cassie had the right idea. She didn’t take it well.”
However bad Castiel had felt about the whole thing, he knew it had hit Dean hard. Despite everything his father had done, he’d still respected him on some level. Looked up to him. Hadn’t been able to help it. To hear the utter disgust in John’s voice as he stated that he only had one son had broken his heart. Castiel had seen it, for all Dean had never admitted it.
Right before one of his shrewdest lieutenants got stabbed, Castiel rammed his blade between the Demon’s shoulders. She jerked, eyes wide as her soul flickered. He wrenched his blade free, shoving her aside.
The Alpha gave him a toothy grin before letting himself be reburied in the Omega’s ass, humming, “Such a bossy little bitch.”
“Well, I gatta admit, the angel’s got his strong points. But holy hell if he ain’t a magnet,” Benny pointed out, watching as Castiel walked away from his most recent smiting victim.
His boyfriend's younger brother wandered out, shaking his head. He was almost out of the kitchen when he stopped, turning to look back at Castiel. "Are you sure you want to go with him?"
Cobalt eyes ran the Demon up and down slowly as he worked. Since Dean was always very focused on cooking, it was the best time to do so. He’d thought the jeans would be too big, but they fit well enough. Clinging to his ass and thighs, set low enough on his hips that when he raised his arms to take things down from cabinets his t-shirt lifted to bare a strip of skin. It was far more intriguing than it should have been. Though to be fair, Dean was pleasing to look at in general. Should he share that? Wouldn’t that be a suitable flirtation, complementing the appearance of the source of your affection?
“I like those dates,” Castiel recalled. “They were simple. Things were simpler. I got to spend time with you, we each had each other’s undivided attention.”
Once downstairs Dean found two extra sub sandwiches in the fridge. He had Castiel eat one while he loaded up the binder and added the new coupons to it, running a few quick calculations to compensate for the addition. He had a list that detailed what he'd be getting, how many of each item he'd be getting, and exactly how much the total for them should be. He didn't even seem mad that Castiel had made him rewrite part of it.
“No, I’m perfectly sane. But then ninety-four percent of psychotics think they’re perfectly sane, so I guess we have to ask ourselves what is sane.”
Sam gave Dean an incredulous look. Dean let his forehead thunk onto the floor with a quiet groan. It was going to be a very long day.
“I know, but you need to get home. You’ll come back soon, right?” He raised his eyebrows at Castiel, nodding meaningfully.
He paused, looking up as he put completed extra credit papers into a shoulder bag. “Yes, Krissy?” She was in his second period, and not among the people who generally stopped by when class wasn’t in session.
At this point he was dearly hoping Dean’s odd behavior had been tied to his injury. He’d been cleared as fully repaired today, he’d even done his three circuits before coming here. Hopefully Dean would be back to normal, especially after the most recent incident. Yesterday the Demon had invited him to play poker with the worn deck of cards he’d unearthed a week or so ago. This wasn’t the first time, but it was the first time he suggested they play something called strip poker. They hadn’t gotten very far, first because Dean complained taking off one shoe didn’t really count, then because Castiel accused him of intentionally losing.
Rather than answer, Dean made a grab for the phone. He and Sam went down in a tangle of limbs, crashing onto first the couch, then the floor in a very undignified manner. He was still trying to wrestle control of the phone when it was plucked from Sam’s hand, and both brothers froze, looking up as Castiel studied the device.
“You feel sorry for it?” Dean demanded incredulously. “You were cursing that thing up and down at the time.”
Castiel did his belt, admitting, “It might be best if I didn’t. The more normal I remain, the less attention I risk drawing.”
Benny fought the urge to roll his eyes. Something he’d never done before he’d gotten himself saddled with a human and their angel. “Obviously, I’m less than comfortable with that.”
“It may become necessary to pick off the hunters, if they’re persistent. Hopefully they’ll give up, think you’ve gone somewhere to lick your wounds. But it’s no guarantee.”
He began leading Balthazar towards the house, only remembering when they were halfway across the yard to warn, "Remember to speak aloud."
He had just enough time to note the glasses of specialty drinks in their hands before one of them was thrown in his face. He gasped, spluttering as alcohol and juice seeped through his shirt, hurridly wiping at his eyes, relieved none of it had actually gotten in them. When he could see clearly, Meg was on her feet and in the girl’s face, impressive considering they had three inches on her.
the weekend. This apparently entailed gray sweatpants and an old S.C.U. t-shirt he would normally wear around the house.
It was true, Castiel’s middle name was James, and until high school had gone by the less conspicuous nickname. He’d switched back to his first name when he’d donned all the black. Dean had never used it before, but for what it was worth his mate seemed to like it. He got a little more enthusiastic as the moans of “Cas” turned to whimpers of “Jimmy”.
He cocked his head, considering. “I’m thankful for a healthy, mostly sane family,” he said slowly. “I’m thankful to have work, to have a roof over my head, and a husband who is also healthy and mostly sane.”
They didn't sleep much that night. When Castiel did spare a glance for the clock, shortly before nodding off, it was well passed midnight. The Omega wouldn't be surprised by this until later. While some of it was more rough and ready, he felt he could honestly call much of the sex they engaged in that night love making. When he did nod off he was utterly drained and more sated than he'd ever been outside of a heat.
Only when he’d looked around the house and peered out a window at the backyard did Dean turn to him and ask, “What did you have in mind for a surprise?”
Charlie not only survived online school, she thrived. She interacted with online classmates, she even made a friend that was local so they could meet and play. As a bonus, she got the hang of computers very quickly. Within a month she’d taught herself to type. Within two she’d surpassed both Dean and Sam’s skills. By her tenth birthday, Dean had to explain what hacking was to Castiel so they could properly handle Charlie’s escapades.
Everything left Dean's face when he slept, or at least it used to. These days there were some things that stayed, especially recently. The strain of the job, the sorrow of losses. If it wasn't so ingrained into the brothers Castiel might have tried to get them to retire years ago. He'd settled for striking a balance, then personally warding their apartment against anything and everything. If they ever did leave the life, they would have to do so on their own accord. He couldn't, wouldn't, force them.
Perhaps the Angel still wouldn’t have understood, but the strained way he said the words, the way his voice broke at the end…he knew. He just knew. He drew away just enough to cup Dean’s face in his hands, taking in his expression. He kissed him slowly, murmuring, “I love you too.”
A smirk Castiel had come to dread was starting to spread across Dean’s face again. “You mean to tell me you’ve never done a little cloud seeding?”
“Yes, but we didn’t let it escalate. Spending some time with Sam was nice too. I’d never met him before then.”
Gadreel didn’t comment, focusing the entirety of his attention on stopping the SUV outside a familiar house. It hadn’t changed much over the years, the roof was new, the garage had been rebuilt, but otherwise it was always exactly as he remembered. With bumblebee windchimes and baubles decorating the front porch right alongside an assortment of charms. Safety, longevity, fire-repulsion, and the like.
But when they reached for his hand, Dean jerked it away, hissing, “Don’t touch me. You don’t just grab people, and you don’t- what the hell was that, anyway? How’d we get here?”
As Charlie stared a grimace crossed Dean’s face, and he shook out his left arm. “What’re you talking about?”
He smiled sheepishly, acutely aware of Gadreel being stalled in the hallway, being subject to an embarrassingly detailed threat of bodily harm should he hurt a hair on Samandriel’s head. It was the same threat Castiel had given to Rowena a year ago, when Charlie had finally brought her home. Samandriel had known about the red-haired witch for some time, though he’d gotten the impression his sister had stalled bringing her here. He had no idea what she was worried about, so long as no one tried to flex magically she could coexist with their mother, and she got along eerily well with Dean. Now that he thought about it that was probably when Charlie had finally given up and agreed to marry her.
“Sorry. Never got to touch an Angel’s wings before. Well, not living, and they get all brittle after you’re ganked. Are they always that soft?”
School was another matter. He was able to wrap up what was left of their current level of education in short order, at least on the academic level. His concerns were on what to do after. Charlie was quick to volunteer for the online option, but then all things computer had quickly earned her fascination. Her current mission in life was to demolish Dean in every video game he had and many he didn’t. Balthazar was another story. He was a social creature, even if he’d been a target for bullying by classmates who found him odd. Dean had mentioned sports and camps, some of which they could try over the summer. That seemed like a good idea.
Charlie hopped up into the chair, kicking her feet happily as she munched on bacon. Castiel hung back, smiling fondly while Dean hurried to get scrambled eggs out of the pan before they burned. He put them on what now appeared to be Charlie’s plate, then started cracking some more into a bowl.
“I haven’t even been doing the cheap stuff, either,” Dean continued, apparently as fed up as the Angel. “I’m doing all the gentlemanly stuff that’s genuine. But no, I might as well be asking you if it hurt when you fell from Heaven.”
“’S wrong, Cas?” At least he’d noticed something was off. This wasn’t the usual feeding or diaper changing that usually woke the Omega.
Smiling fondly at his husband, Castiel mused, “Though I’m not sure how long you’d last without it these days. You tend to get twitchy if you’re forced to abandon your work. Perhaps if you had warning and you could tend things to your satisfaction, like when we took that second honeymoon. You were able to arrange for the gap in your presence, and aside from texting family members on occasion you left your phone alone.”
One of the steps smacked into his temple all the way down, spots flashing behind his eyes. A buzz started ringing in his ears after that, the bumps hurting far less than they should. It was just as well, he hit a lot of body parts on the way down. He'd be black and blue for days, weeks, he just knew it.
Giving his head a sharp shake, Castiel made sure his grace was as concealed as was possible, then shrugged off his trench coat. He found a branch to drape it over, then sat to get off his boots and socks. He set those neatly side-by-side next to the tree’s base, then folded his pants and shirt atop them. He left his underwear on, just because he didn’t like the notion of being caught naked by enemies. While modern briefs were close to the loincloths that had been a constant over the centuries, these days he’d grown fond of boxer briefs. They were more comfortable.
Only because Gabriel had baked them did Castiel do as he was bid. He adored Mary, really, but there wasn’t much she was able to cook successfully. That was mainly left up to her visiting children during the holidays, though she could make a mean pie.
He hadn’t been lying. He was tired. Tired of searching for someone who, he was starting to suspect, did not want to be found. Tired of being in constant pain. Tired of having to keep track of a new set of appendages while coping with a perpetual migraine. Tired of wings that got sore very easily and throbbed whenever he knocked something over. Tired of accidently ripping his own clothes. Every time his wings showed up they promptly tore slits in whatever shirt or jacket he was wearing, and this time they’d done that through his work coveralls.
“I’m fine,” Dean groaned. Then promptly jumped a solid six inches off the floor as a semi on the highway outside honked its horn.
“What is that?” Dagon asked, eyes narrowing. She came around the table, extending a hand towards Dean, palm out.
Meanwhile the creature was leaning forward, one limb braced on the floor, two more folded beneath it so it could lean into the hole it’d made by collapsing a wall, at least two more reaching over the roof, others bracing against the floor and grasping walls. Dean was faintly aware that the people who’d kidnapped him, and then begun to fight over who got to kill him, were now screaming. He did spare them a glance, but only briefly. All had their hands, paws, or whatever else clamped over their ears as they shrieked in agony. Their eye sockets all burned with fire, each of them dropping dead one by one, goners from the moment they looked up at this creature.
It had been very good spaghetti, in truth. And Dean’s logic was sound. He still had to check in with their healer before he went on patrol.
“I agreed to go anywhere and do anything so long as I didn’t have to get on one of those flying death traps,” Dean reminded him. “And we didn’t.”
“I am not here. I was never here. You’re gonna have to call in that cleanup crew again.” Waving his blade at Abaddon, poking her with a booted toe, he added, “It’d be more trouble than it’s worth to say it was me even if I wasn’t in hiding.”
Castiel was adding a few stems of white flowers when a brown-haired bunny made its way through the grass, nose twitching. Smiling fondly, the dragon slowly took one of the white flowered weeds and offered it to the creature. After a few moment's hesitation, and some cautious sniffing, the bunny ate his offering and continued on its way.
“This is also a lesson you taught us, not to resort to hurling magic when a problem is not easily resolved. Really, mother. I’m the pregnant one, at least I have an excuse to be unreasonable.”
They stopped by the kitchen, where the cook fussed over them and agreed to send up dinner. She also promised to send up a whole pie, which delighted his mate. He only just managed to get his mate out of the kitchen before he coaxed a second pie and supply of turnovers from the matronly woman. He didn’t mind Dean stocking up on such treats, but not right now. Dean had promised to show him the lord’s library after they’d met with the man. Despite his mate’s insistence he didn’t feel comfortable just helping himself, regardless of how to ground the place had been allowed to go. But he did know a spell that helped speed the duplication process, and he intended to use it. Dean could hardly help him tiptoe into the library if he was stuffed with baked sweets.
"They displayed concern when you dropped off the map as your cousin did." Glancing at Castiel he added, "Your parents are still distraught over your departure."
"No, I'm aware. I've seen the TV shows. Considering the alternatives for addiction this seems like a constructive outlet."
While it was satisfying, seeing the look on Gina’s face as it finally hit home, it was never as satisfying than one would think. “I…I’m sorry. I just thought…”
When morning came he was sprawled on his side, head resting on a pillow, eyes fluttering open as gentle touches stirred him. Fingers were combing through his hair, the sensation of nails on his scalp incredibly soothing, warm lips pressing idle paths across his shoulders. A faint smile graced his face, his eyes fluttering at the attention. If he'd been a cat he would be purring.
Castiel had smiled, bending to pick up his bag with one hand and lacing their fingers together with the other. As he’d led Dean back towards the diner he’d said, “Come on. I’ll explain while you eat. They have good pie.”
It was not over in the morning. In fact, Dean was unconvinced it hadn’t gotten worse. Tuesday was much the same as Monday had been, so was Wednesday. On Thursday he dragged himself to work, reasoning that if he’d managed to survive classes all week the least he could do was some damned paperwork. Bobby did relent on that front, but made him do it all in Baby. Something about all those lightbulbs being a pain to replace.
“I will return the favor,” Castiel growled. He shifted his weight backwards, hauling Uriel off balance just enough so he could lift a foot, yanking one of his feet out from under him. They went down hard, the Seraph atop the younger Angel.
Castiel brushed Jimmy’s hair, wandering back towards the tower and returning to his library. He’d set out some of Jimmy’s favorite toys for him to play with while he began cataloging the additions to his literary collection. Like as not he wouldn’t be in much condition to sit in the morning, might as well get started now.
being bored. He hadn't even thought it was possible, but recently he was being proven wrong on a daily basis. The Omega blew out a plume of smoke between scaled lips, watching the tendrils drift up among cottony fluffs floating in the crystal blue sky overhead.
A hand came into view, fingers brushing his cheek. A shock darted between them at the touch, seemingly startling the Alpha. Then, to Castiel's dismay, he gave his head a sharp shake and sat back on his haunches, removing his touch.
But he’d deal with that later. He still had a good deal of time before he was expected back with the rest of his squadron. Tossing his coat over the back of an armchair, Castiel started searching drawers and cabinets. In truth he wasn’t expecting to find much, considering the hermit had been a lifelong bachelor.
“I don’t know,” Castiel admitted at length. “I was giving it thought because it would be a less dangerous posting, closer to home, and I could ideally keep more Angels alive in the long term. But I’m not sure how good a trainer I would make.”
Henry got off the crate, still grumbling, and marched off. Castiel ignored him, opening the crate as bare feet pattered across the cobles from the stable. When he glanced up it was to see two heads of bobbing curls, one gold one black, dashing towards him.
Something soft and wet brushed his sides. Dean dragged his eyes open, turning his head just enough to get a look at what he hoped was a freshly formed wing. He wasn’t disappointed.
Dean cracked a smile. He leaned up, pressing his lips briefly to what Castiel assumed was a blood-free part of his forehead. When he withdrew, he flipped the blade in his hand so it was point down then offered it to the Angel. “You’re gonna need this. They’ll know it’s the one what did it.”
Absently reaching up to push his glasses back up his nose, he jiggled his house key out of the mess and jammed it into the lock. They were black, thick, horn rimmed things, but his eyes were so bad the lenses he needed were thick, and these frames were the only ones he could use that he actually liked to some degree. They were annoying, but contacts had never worked for him and he hadn't worked himself up to Lasik yet. That and it wasn't exactly what one might call 'in the budget'. Not when both he and his mate were working while he took classes.
“Middle of town. Just head straight on this road. It’s the one with a fountain out front. Shouldn’t you slow down? The speed limit sign says ten.”
“We’re gonna talk about this when we get home, ya hear?” He waited until Castiel nodded against him, then said, “I’m gonna take that out, alright? There’s backup questions we can pick from.”
The Alpha pulled back, going over to their hearth. He sank into one of the two comfortable carved chairs with a sigh, pulling the stopper from a bottle of whisky and pouring some into a glass. Castiel kept one eye on him as he toed out of his boots, setting them neatly aside. He took off his clothes as ordered, one article at a time, folding them with care and placing them on the clothes trunk.
The dragon was starting to doze when the door creaked open, but he only cracked an eye when he heard the bolt lightly click into place. He rolled over, smiling up at Dean. “You’re sure we won’t be interrupted this time?”
It occurred to Benny that perhaps things were different with angels. Dean had given him a brief run-down about the species, perhaps they were genderless and this one simply happened to be in a male vessel. Whether he’d been blind to the vessel’s gender, or oblivious, it didn’t change the facts. And the simple fact was, Dean was in love.
“Fine, uh…I like a lot of things about it. But I guess my favorites would be the food and spending time with family.”
Frankly Castiel was just glad it hadn't caused trouble until after they'd taken care of the ghouls, when they were leaving town anyway. They'd suspected, they weren't blind. Sam and Gabriel had gone to get supplies and try circling around what was stuck to their shoe, Dean had stepped out to get them checked out. Castiel had been loading their things into Baby's trunk when he'd seen a familiar face slipping into their room. He'd grabbed the first blunt instrument to hand and stood ready to nail whoever came out. When he came back Dean had bound the Alpha and put in for another day with their room. From what they could tell it was a bounty hunter this time, rather than a private investigator.
“Also I’d like to ask that all the question requests stay PG,” Dean continued in a firm tone. “I love your input, but my channel is PG and it’s gonna stay that way.”
Once it was done, Benny grasped the cut in the human’s arm, Dean doing the same to his. “I’ll see you on the other side,” the vampire reminded him.
Smiling fondly, Castiel did as he was bid. Pancake mix, coffee, cereal, soup, pasta, and snack mix were among the things added to their second cart. As Castiel had suspected he was sent to fetch a third cart. By the time Dean made a final count and led the way to an empty checkout lane they had four and Castiel was beginning to question whether or not Bobby's truck had sufficient space.
“It will make a suitable backup.” He went to set it on the table. It would not harm him, not like the blade he’d given to Dean.
If he didn’t run the risk of a confrontation in his weakened state, Castiel would be packing up his workshop right now. But he did, so he reluctantly began pouring his latest potion into a jar. Perhaps he could pack subtly, so it would be easier when the time came. He’d also see about taking Gabriel up on his offer.
Turning to stare at the Angel, eyes oddly blank, he asked, “Did ya know they send out the hellhounds if they know you’re about to die? Even if it’s natural, even if you have time left? Only reason they didn’t see it is because I talked them into letting me rest, that I’d catch up. Didn’t know until I was already dead my head was bleeding, on the inside. That’s what did me in. That and the fucking hounds.”
“You would have what? Stopped me? You have no right to that, and you know it. The choice to breed is one we are free to make as we see fit.”
At some point the Alpha noticed the sun was rising overhead, blinking blearily at the lighting window and mumbling something about needing to get to work.
His trouble was with the curse he suspected Alistair had provided. He hadn’t seen something like this in some time. Mostly because the ingredients it had to be drawn in were hard to come by. Considering Alistair was supposed to specialize in torture, perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised. He’d gone all-out for his old apprentice. If he had any sense Castiel would let it work, or finish the job. The last thing the humans needed was another alive and kicking Knight of Hell, but as he’d said, he’d been spending too much time around his Father’s prized creations. Apparently, their sense of sentiment was contagious. Like the flu.
Dean was awake by the time he came out of the steam filled bathroom, frying up some eggs and bacon. None of them spoke much, if at all. There was no need. Castiel tried to help where he could, but the brothers hadn't bothered to hide the fact he wasn't much of a cook. So instead he kept the apartment clean and did the grocery shopping between shifts. Both he and Dean refused to let Sam do much of anything, insisting he focus on his schoolwork.
“I dunno,” he admitted, scrubbing his face wearily. “He’s legit, I’m sure about that. He’s definitely gonna have limits, but…if he can make nice with Sam too, I guess I’ll go.”
“Wuss?” Castiel repeated, bristling. “I was devout, I upheld a standard of moral fiber. I advanced in rank and power due to skill and training.”
A bemused smile that didn’t reach Uriel’s eyes tugged the other Angel’s face. “That’s unusual for you.”
Gabriel was in his kitchen, looking up from a cup of tea. He set aside the scroll he'd been studying, along with the mug.
"I wouldn't worry about them. I've never met them, and I doubt you will. As I understand it their existence is paralleled to ours, our ancestors were Fay who chose to stay in the human realm and were affected by it. It's why we're not quite Fay, but not quite human."
He almost made it to the showers before Uriel stopped him. The man was a good soldier, but a little too…traditional, for Castiel’s liking. He looked forward to the next rotation when he could pass him to someone else’s squadron without it looking unfavorable.
He hadn’t forced Dean into anything, the Omega had to give him that. He hung around, spent time with him, helped Sam with his homework, got Bobby’s shop’s taxes in order, and generally managed to worm his way into the reluctant Omega’s heart. In the week between finals and when they walked for their diploma’s, Castiel mated him.
“Dean, enough. You have plenty of paid leave time you’ve never used, and I’m sure Bobby will understand. Hasn’t he been after you to take time off anyway?”
"Because I knew what it would do to you," John snapped, glaring at him across the table. "He could handle it, you picked a strong one. Castiel's fine. Go find your brother, talk some sense into him."
Castiel blinked a few times, trying to clear his head. "Yes. It develops along with their natural abilities. When they're small enough an adult will-o'-the-wisp can carry a youngling with them." He hesitated, then said, "Not yet. I want you to meet them, but...not yet."
Castiel was faintly aware of the finishing guitar solo in the background as Dean countered, “Not really in the mood for that one. What about…that thing we did when you brought me that one Zep album?”
Castiel didn't comment. In truth after coming very, very close to dying he'd chosen to remove himself from the field. He wasn't about to chance a risk like that again, not when he had children to care for. He'd come to the decision that hunting would belong in his previous life unless very critical circumstances demanded otherwise, and while he wouldn't force Dean to join him in retirement he'd seen his mate heading in the same direction. The longer they'd been in this new, normal life the easier it had been to separate from hunting. It had been a gradual change, but one neither regretted.
That got a pair of raised eyebrows from Dean. He reached over, lacing his fingers through Castiel’s free left hand and holding both their hands up for all to see. More specifically, both their wedding bands for all to see. “Actually, Dean is married to Mr. Novak.”
Dean paused, bottle halfway to his mouth. His eyes narrowed, and he asked, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Balthazar skidded to his knees in the pools of rainwater, thrusting the box he’d been sent for against Castiel’s side. “What happened? Why’d someone put a pincher spell on him?”
Benny, who had been looking at him carefully, only offered an unrepentant grin and a shrug. “Can’t help it. You smell a little different there, chief, anything you wanna tell me?”
So saying, a cap opened behind him. Shortly after Gabriel hissed, flinching away from the initial cool touch. His new mate stroked his hair soothingly, pressing gentle kisses to his shoulder. His right hand continued to slowly massage aloe into his abused buttocks. He caught a peek at them in the dresser mirror, the red welts from Sam's belt still marring his flesh. He'd found it interesting how Sam had taken more offense over his neglecting to be straight with him than he had about Gabriel going after a wendigo. After delivering fifty lashes, ten for each day of deception, the Omega had been subject to a very thorough round of sex before Sam had asked him to be his mate. While Gabriel blamed it on his state of mind at the time, he didn't regret it.
"So Balthazar and Samandriel are Omegas, and Charlie is a Beta?" the Alpha asked near the beginning of his probing.
“You sure?” And index finger gingerly brushed against a shoulder blade, making the Omega tremble. “You’ve got some real pretty welts all over, all red and raw. They might even still be here in the morning.”
“Purgatory is…hell adjacent, I suppose. Hell can only contain human souls, not non-humans, so they and their soulmates go there. I was on duty there for the last twenty years, if I had tried to leave it would have cost me my life. That is why I couldn’t come to you.”
Castiel drew out the thong, holding it up for inspection. Sure enough, it was a basic necklace, like the humans had had for centuries. That much wasn’t noteworthy. Castiel was interested in what hung from it. A small idol, as wide as his thumb and not half as long, as old as the Demon who owned it. Castiel had heard of it, seen drawings when he’d asked Sam about it, but never thought he’d see it in person.
Dean's shoulders sagged in relief even as a wide grin spread across his face. A proud smile tugged at Castiel's mouth as Dean paid and the staff who'd gathered to watch drifted away. The sun still wasn't up, but it wouldn't be long in coming.
He lurched to his feet, pacing the small bedroom slowly, raking a hand back through his hair. At a guess he had eight hours, perhaps less. Thankfully Angels weren’t humans, like the rest of his squadron Castiel had twenty-four hour shifts, and would only be off for twelve. Meaning he had time to work the remaining eight hours to break the curse, the only question was how he’d go about it. He hadn’t seen this curse in centuries. Last time had been when it had been laid on a group of Angels as retaliation for banishing a group of Fay back to their own world. They’d managed to save most of them, but not all.
John pushed his plate aside, which the Omega found odd. He'd been able to watch the older Alpha through several windows as those two hours had gone by. John had been here the whole time, and Castiel had seen this plate come to him over an hour ago. One of many traits that came with the Winchester name was a hearty appetite, and while their diet varied none of them ever left food on a plate. This one had just been picked at.
Dean started looking down at his chair again as bickering started in earnest. Now just about everyone was arguing with someone else. He jerked at his bindings, rocking himself back and forth, only to go very still as a curved piece of sharp, cold metal pressed against the side of his neck. He froze, then very slowly lifted his gaze up until he could look at the knife. Yup, it was the dragon’s. When his gaze followed the blade up to its handle, then up a jacket clad arm, he met cold eyes.
As he ranted Dean heaved a sigh, rightening himself and opening his eyes, rotating to regard the Angel. It didn’t help Castiel’s temper that he was blinking up at him like a sleepy cow. Completely unfazed, unbothered. It was infuriating.
“Don’t call me that, I feel old enough as it is.” Dean stepped forward, offering a hand for a firm shake.
He half turned towards the footsteps coming around, but he went still, eyes widening. The first words out of his mouth were, “The fuck happened to you?”
Dean was genuinely afraid to leave his apartment that day, and Sam ended up ordering delivery rather than leave when dinner time rolled around. He had classes to get to, shifts at Bobby’s shop, he couldn’t afford to start holing up in his apartment indefinitely. So he had to get these wings figured out, and fast.
Dean had stopped in the middle of working off his second boot, staring at him. “Bees?” he repeated, deadpan. “You like bees. Why? No one likes bees.”
Castiel was pleased to wake and find himself in his nest. He was not pleased to find the Alpha awake and somewhat coherent. He turned over in time to see something like dismay, or possibly horror, cross the Alpha's pretty face. The human had scooted to the far side of his nest, evergreen eyes wide, as naked as the Omega was.
Castiel’s lips twitched. Like many fledglings, Samandriel was in awe of the Archangels. Gabriel just happened to be the one they got to see themselves, none of the others were willing to soil themselves with the presence of fledglings. “If you ask nicely, I’m sure he’ll be happy to let you have some of his latest concoctions for your trouble.”
Castiel took the paper, reading it over. There were a few he wasn’t so sure about, but for Dean he’d go through with it. Once he’d studied all the questions and contemplated suitable answers he handed back the list. “I’ll need to get a shower first.”
When they got home he would call Gabriel. Maybe his cousin and Sam could get somewhere before the Fall semester started. Dean was happy, as happy as a hunter could be. Sam deserved that too, and if he had to give things a little nudge Castiel would gladly provide it.
By this point he was thoroughly annoyed, he’d suffered for these damned things the least Sam could do was look at them. For the first time he really tried to move them. New muscles and torn flesh screamed, but he was able to make them fully extend, reaching just over six feet to either side of himself. For a moment he was wondering if Sam was playing some kind of messed up prank, but then his brother’s eyes bulged, and he stumbled back a step.
“To keep an eye on you. He is being dealt with. Metatron is actually rather fond of humans, he enjoys your stories, but he is also disgusted by the notion of having one as a soulmate. It seems rather hypocritical if you ask me.”
Gabriel didn’t answer that time. Not verbally. He popped his sucker into his mouth, then rolled his shoulders back, grace lighting up his eyes. Castiel took an involuntary step back as the room was suddenly lit not by electric lights, but by angelic grace in the doorway. Bright gold angelic grace radiating from Gabriel, triple layered wings thrown into sharp relief, raw power filling the room so abruptly Castiel could taste it.
The voices were bad enough. He might respond on occasion, start if one started yelling or just plain screaming, but for the most part he could tune them out. It was actually the easiest thing he’d had to deal with so far. But now he was seeing things.
Apparently ordering various food types online was one of many new phenomena. Castiel watched over Dean's shoulder as one pepperoni pizza was ordered along with an olive and sausage pizza. The Alpha hadn't batted an eye at the request when it was insisted he could have anything he wanted on one. Within the hour someone was knocking on their door to drop them off. By this time Dean had introduced him to the world of hobbits and wizards, and he found himself enthralled with the creatures. He'd read the books, of course, but he was fascinated to see what modern movie makers had done with the tale.
The old field was overgrown, but the graves were apparently intact. Dean was leaning against a now ancient windmill, catching his breath, wrapping a scrap of cloth around the wound in his arm. There was no sign of Castiel. Considering he’d put all that effort into trying to talk Dean around, to convince him it wouldn’t work, the vampire did feel regret. If only because he knew how it felt, to lose the one you loved, to have them torn away from you.
He might dislike the idea of his new mate ridding his scent from his skin, but it wouldn't be a problem if they showered together. Besides, he knew Castiel preferred to be clean, and neither were very presentable at the moment.
After the first week Castiel started picking him up with collapsed boxes in the trunk, collecting them for their pending move. Dean tried to help, but he was still limited. He compensated by trying to be even more understanding about the more delicate state his Alpha was in. More patient. Castiel was even more on edge than usual, and for all he swore to the contrary it was obvious he wasn’t getting much sleep. It wasn’t just because of the extra shifts he was picking up, either.
“Nice to know your aim is still true,” he mused, stepping further inside and closing the door at his back.
Samandriel glanced sideways as the car jerked to a sudden stop, hands jerking up to brace on the dash. “What’s wrong?” Considering they’d been driving for twelve hours he would have thought Gadreel would have been happier to arrive at their destination.
“Made it. The kitchen is a damn chemistry lab. I could ‘a made a bomb if I’d wanted to. Relax, I wouldn’t. Not for you, anyway.”
Dean grimaced, but he grabbed his underwear before going back to the kitchen. Castiel tried not to rush, but nor did he linger. He enjoyed his lover’s food, and made sure to tell him as much.
As he held up his hands, Dean noted, “He looks like an Archangel, he feels like an Archangel, but he doesn’t talk or act like an Archangel. I’ve heard some serious shit about Gabriel. You sure you’re him?”
“Dean.” Sam stepped forward, slowly raising his hands to grip his bare shoulders. Staring directly into his eyes, he stated, “I didn’t feel your wings. I saw them, twice, but I haven’t felt them. I can’t see them right now. But I believe you, this is real,
His real problem came with that, if he was really focusing on a person, he could tell if they were lying. That he quickly learned to turn off, just for the sake of his own sanity, or rather he learned now not to see it. It helped that he had to really hone in on a person and look for a truth before he could tell. This did not apply to seeing a person’s nature, or seeing if they were ill. He could see Charlie’s carpal tunnel, which he hadn’t even known she had. When a sweet old lady brought her car into the shop, he could see the cancer gnawing at her bones. When he finally worked himself up to a grocery run, he could see the set and healing bone hidden by a cast, the COPD in an old man’s lungs.
“’Who’s the better…kisser?’” He gave his husband an unamused look. “What happened to keeping this PG?”
Castiel sighed quietly as his cousin's appraising gaze was turned onto his mate. In a rare surge of jealousy he moved to stand at Dean's side rather than Sam's. Only when he was at the Alpha's right hand did he introduce them.
"Dad, please, just hear him out," urged Sam. He was four years younger than Dean at fourteen, and had recently presented as an Alpha. For his part Sam liked Castiel, more than anyone else Dean had dated before. It had been one of many marks in Castiel's favor, that he'd gotten along so well with his baby brother.
Brow furrowing, Dean stared at his wing. He tried to move it again, getting them to twitch upward a little, wingtips quivering, and Sam’s hand jerked away. “They’re back,” he blurted. “What’re you doing?”
The Omega took a few small, slow steps forward, extending a red fruit with one hand. The mare’s ears flicked forward, eyeing him wearily. But when it was close enough her nostrils flared, and she gave it a careful sniff before taking it daintily from his hand. Her bit wasn’t in yet, so she was free to crunch the treat.
Castiel glanced around, making sure the store was still empty as he fished his phone from a pocket. He was restocking the shelves before the next shift came in, and there weren't exactly many patrons at 3:30 in the morning. He swiped the screen, bringing the phone to his ear as he continued placing cans of Pringles on the shelf.
“Silence!” Naomi glowered at him with what Charlie abruptly realized could only be called hate. “You may not speak here,
Dean eventually found he didn’t care much, dully watching a few episodes of The Wire before sluggishly dragging himself back to the floor. He had a feeling TV wouldn’t be very effective anymore, so he went around and gathered some notebooks, pens, his computer, and the book Sam had given him. He scrubbed his face wearily, opening up the spreadsheet he used to keep track of what texts he’d already been through. Sam’s idea, actually, but Dean had taken pains to make sure he didn’t know he’d gone through with it. Not after he’d made such a show of scoffing and mocking the idea. In his defense, that was back when he’d only had a few dozen texts to keep up with. Back when he’d had no idea just how difficult the quest he’d set out on would be.
The Alpha shook his head, looking around the store. They were in a lull, just one or two people wandering the isles without a blue vest. "Think they'll let you knock off early?"
Apparently that noise was what did his partner in. He was actually disappointed when the Alpha lifted his head and moved forward, rolling his hips and grinding two very hard cocks together. Castiel whimpered, reaching up to grab his shoulders and hooking a leg over his waist. The Alpha kissed him again, even as he obligingly slid inside his dripping entrance.
Castiel smiled, stepping forward to press a hand to the Alpha's cheek. He leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together, uncaring of the sweat and grime. It was a gesture of great affection, generally reserved for a mother and their child. He'd never done it to anyone else, either the gesture or the gentle wave of emotions that accompanied it. Just enough for Dean to notice, for the Alpha to register the warmth Castiel himself felt in his chest.
Dean appreciated how many people at least looked at his soulmark, but he did wish so many didn’t say the same thing. Over and over. If he had a dollar for every person who said, “Just wait until you turn twenty-one, it might make more sense then,” he wouldn’t need to pick up shifts at Bobby’s anymore. But that would only work if his soulmate was a non-human. Granted that seemed more and more likely with each human dialect he discarded, but it didn’t mean he shouldn’t stop looking. And what if they were wrong? What if his soulmate was human too? Then what good would waiting have done him?
Hands fisted in his jacket as the Omega pulled him towards the stairs, cheeks pink and eyes bright. There were already a few bags by the door, nothing much. Mostly clothes, books, and whatever cash he'd been able to find in his parent's safe. They weren't home tonight, but then they often weren't. It was part of why it was so easy for Castiel to agree to this. There was no one to miss him.
The angel didn’t respond right away. From the looks of it he was familiar with the human’s stubbornness. So rather than argue further he said simply, “I understand.”
"Admit it, you would," Gabriel chided. "We did exactly what you would have. Well, not exactly. I doubt either of you would call that thing an assbutt to get its attention before firebombing it. But you get my point."
“I passed old traces on my way to you. I think you’re close to something, you might have missed it from the air. Perhaps we should split up, cover more ground.”
“I am more content with monotony in my diet than you are,” Castiel admitted. “But I think the one thing I would eat every day if I were able would be honey.”
Castiel frowned slightly. “Happy ending?” he repeated. “I am quite happy with its conclusion already.” Lurching to his feet, shaking out his wings, he stated, “Thank you. For the PB&J’s, and the massage. If you have the list ready I will go get more supplies. I’m surprised you have any left.”
“Their native language and English.” They’d only recently gotten a good grasp on reading their native tongue, they weren’t ready for other languages yet. But Henry had mastered English and had nearly done the same with the Old Tongue.
The Omega cocked his head, taking his time in studying the figure below him. Again a blush spread from his cheeks and neck, but this time it actually spread to his chest. Castiel leaned in, curious, pressing fingertips to the pinkened flesh. It didn't feel overly warm, but it did blot out most of his freckles. He liked seeing this Alpha's freckles.
“So do you,” Dean protested with a huff. “They’re awesome. Come on, when else are you gonna see Snoopy and Superman
Castiel carefully got to his feet, finished flower crown in hand. "Hello. Are you lost?" he asked innocently.
Castiel cracked a smile, watching as their son finally made it across the tile. He was just three, but Henry disliked being left out of things. He stumbled a little, but managed to keep his hands extended up towards his father. Dean reached down, lifting him up onto one hip and returning the tyke's hug.
"Barely. Doctor's said he was just eight weeks along, didn't stop it from being messy when he lost it. Figured it was the life that did it. The pills, the liquor, doubt getting thrown halfway across that house by a spirit helped either."
“Yes. At a slumber party in middle school, on a dare. Nothing came of it, though they did try to prank me.”
His brother had risen to the challenge presented to him, and then some. He fully intended to do the same. At least now he had a narrowed suspect pool.
After no small amount of consideration Castiel decided there were very few people he could actually speak to. He did have friends, but none he felt he could risk telling of something this delicate. As much as he loved his mother, she wasn't an option either. Naomi was a stickler for rules and regulations, suitable considering she was a law enforcer, but being her child could be...difficult. Particularly considering her firstborn was a self-proclaimed trickster. Despite this, Gabriel was a very loyal sibling. Both were solid reasons Castiel chose him as a confidant.
The Angel took solace in that. And the fact that Dean still seemed enthusiastic. This time it wasn’t written off as being that desperate a need for connection, though. Later, perhaps, but right this moment it was by far superseded by the rather jarring realization that Dean was serious. This didn’t feel fake, it didn’t feel forced. For whatever reason, this beautiful if demonic creature wanted
But seriously, the hardest part with every update is the questions they do. Feel free to make suggestions. Please. Pretty please?
"You're not supposed to carry a bunch of crap up at once, either. And if the queen bitch starts screeching you ignore her."
The kids had hurried upstairs, eager to start now that they’d finally been given permission to start packing. As soon as they were out of sight Dean jerked around, and to Castiel’s shock slammed a fist into a doorjamb. He jumped, staring at the seething Alpha. Gabriel tensed up, but Castiel waved him away.
She was about to ask, but didn’t get the chance as Dean floored the accelerator. Charlie’s eyes widened as they surged forward, roaring through the shields that hid Kansas Haven from the rest of the world. Instead of driving straight into marsh, they went straight through the illusion and onto a flat dirt road, freshly shoveled snow heaped on either side.
