With the ocean to his left, Steve began to run north and, in what seemed like no time, passed the sign for entering the Malibu city limits.
Steve was always there for him from the beginning. He was the one who convinced Tony to reach out to Peter. He was the one who convinced Peter to give his dad a chance. He listened to Peter…Steve consoled him, protected him, and loved him like he was his son. Peter knew Steve would do anything for him,
Steve was clenching his jaw so tightly Tony was surprised his teeth weren’t popping out yet. He was barely keeping it together. Without looking at them, Tony said to the others, “Guys, can you give us a minute?”
Peter did not know what to expect. When she opened it, he flinched back but nothing happened. He cautiously peered inside the cylinder and only saw darkness. There did not seem to be any threat but his senses were still going haywire with dire warning.
“Snuggle time is the best time,” Peter agreed with a small sigh. He settled back into Wade and Wade wound his other arm around his front, so he was completely wrapped around Peter. Peter sighed contently as he relaxed into Wade’s hold. He woke up to such an embrace every morning. Wade had gotten into the habit of wrapping himself around Peter every night and Peter couldn’t sleep well without the tangle of his limbs now. Feeling them around him now brought a wave of fulfilment through him.
When he traveled through time, he at least knew what to expect. Being in the dark sucked. This must’ve been what Steve felt like with the knowledge of the future being dangled in front of him like a faraway lure and he didn’t like it one bit.
They laughed and Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist and closed his eyes. It was going to take at least an hour to get back to Sam’s with the traffic. They had a lot of planning to do to foil Hydra’s plans but…in that one hour Tony decided he was going to take a chance to relax in the arms of the man he loved and take comfort in the fact that, for the first time in his life, he was going to be happy.
Steve shook his head and replied, “The plane crashed a few days ago…I can’t give you an exact date.”
Venom let go of her and she got to her feet with narrowed eyes. She murmured, “That is more than a shield…”
“I am not a part of your boy band, Captain,” Tony replied and turned away from him. “I’m just a consultant, remember?”
“It’s my past!” Bucky countered. “It’s a past when the Winter Soldier was more than just a machine! I want to remember more,
Steve tightened his hold on her hand and heard the gears beneath the artificial skin moan with distress. Mary smirked grimly and Steve commanded, “Jarvis, stop the noise.”
“What will we do about Peter?” Tony asked the question that was at the forefront of Steve’s thoughts.
“I know, Dad,” Peter sighed. “I'm going to stay in uniform the entire time. Peter Parker won't be making any appearances in New York today. I'm an adult. I can handle this.”
Before they put him under, Steve saw him with Peter on his hip. His super soldier was already wearing a worrisome expression. He look from Tony’s exposed chest, the wires they already got in him, and then back to Tony’s face and his frown deepened.
“Papa!” Peter gasped, frightened by all that was happening. Cameras flashed as Peter clutched his neck and burrowed his face into his chest.
Rhodey was pacing next to him like an agitated wild cat and was muttering under his breath about higher command.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Steve blush, it appeared redder than usual thanks to the red light of dusk. Steve sputtered, “W-Well…I-I mean… I can’t really dance?”
Tony was already sitting at the counter with a cup of coffee. He glared at his husband as he happily got to work and then picked up his tablet to continue his work and ignore the fact that Peter was at Wade’s place because he had spent the night…with Wade…all night…with Wade.
I have left of my old life. Everything and everyone else is gone. If I..." Steve bit on his lip as his emotions threatened to spill over. "...I can't destroy myself entirely."
“And thereby tell the entire world to get more eyes looking for him…” Tony sighed. “Coulson doesn’t think he’s even in New York any more…”
“I literally had icicles growing on me,” Steve added with a chuckle. “But Tony rubbed me down, even took my hands and warmed them up nicely with his breath.” He ran his fingers together and smiled down at his hand with a slight flush from the memory. Steve had been harboring a crush on Tony for weeks and when Tony’s mouth came so close to his flesh and his hot breath warmed his skin, Steve became more than flustered.
After all the aliens were killed or captured, Steve stormed up to Tony, with gritted teeth and filled with indignant anger.
Steve upturned his left arm, beside Bucky’s, showing his own implant. He got a new one almost as soon as they had returned to the Tower. He felt uneasy without it.
“He’s the richest, smartest, and most resourceful man on the continent!” Steve retorted with a harsher whisper, “He may be able to get Tony his Palladium…or even find a way to help him. He’s like Tony, he understands this stuff.”
With those words, Steve knew with absolute certainty that Norman knew Peter was Mary’s son. He did not know how but Norman somehow learned of it. And he was trying to use this information to not only toy with Steve and Tony but Peter as well.
Peter shook his head and murmured, “But I can’t…Please, go Wade. I’ll be alright as long as I know you won’t get hurt…”
Tony turned away from him and opened another hologram. He expanded it and scrolled through the results to look like he was doing something.
“The officers would probably get some oscillating fans but their prisoners will get nothing,” Bruce naysaid the idea before it could take fruit in Tony’s mind…and he really liked it for a second.
“I can’t wait to be able to breathe again,” Tony sighed. His lung capacity had been restricted ever since Yensen put the cylinder in his chest to house the reactor he had made. It had originally been the shell to a bomb that his company had made. He ironically wondered if Stark Industries was still legible on the side after all these years…
The strangely dressed people and the additional skyscrapers suddenly made so much more sense. And the quip Iron Man made about his long nap…He was in a new millennium.
Steve stared at the message for at least three minutes and was running out of time to reach the lower levels at the elected time.
They went through the underground garage and Steve only saw a brief glimpse of the crowd gathering outside the Tower. Steve groaned lightly. Would there ever be no reporters outside their home?
Steve was still frowning and Tony pressed, “I’m fine now. In fact, it was a wakeup call. It made me turn my life around for the better. If it hadn’t happened I probably never would have found that base and made my way to you…”
So Steve did. He recited their entire conversation from the moment he woke to the moment he left her. When he repeated Mary telling him Tony went mad with grief, his husband leaned heavily into his side and brokenly whispered, “I did, I truly did.”
The tower did not stop shaking the minutes it took Steve and Tony to get ready. As Steve was changing into his uniform he was talking to the rest of the Avengers over his communicator and SHIELD as well.
Steve sighed heavily and placed the phone on the edge of the tower. He pushed himself up and looked at the world beneath him one last time before turning away.
Peter moaned with frustration and Steve met Tony’s gaze with the familiar look of an aspirated parent.
“People know who you are now,” Tony murmured, not picking his head up from where it was tucked in the crook of Steve’s neck. “Jarvis told me while we were on the helicarrier. I didn’t get a chance to tell you until now…”
“I’m okay, buddy,” Steve murmured huskily to Peter, trying to hide the emotion in his voice. “D-Do you want some ice cream? I thought I saw a vender up the ways.”
Laying there in the silence was the worst part. It was another reminder that Steve was not there. Tony hadn’t realized it but, with Steve living with him, there was always some kind of noise in the background. Whether it the super soldier laughing loudly at the local TV program or the barely audible sound of his pencil scratching the paper of his sketchbook, Tony could always tell Steve was there. But now knowing that he was not, made the time passing by immeasurable and it dragged out torturously.
The lights dimmed, signaling for everyone to take their seats. Peter sat down and Wade managed to snag a seat beside him and Eddie took the seat by Peter’s other side. He kept looking at both Peter and Wade, trying to figure them out.
“I do too but…” Wade cupped Peter’s face and closed the distance between their gazes so he could fully look into Peter’s eyes. “What is it?” He asked Peter, “What am I missing, baby boy? I want to help you but I was never into the big and noble gestures, you are, so I need you to show me the way…”
Bucky didn’t notice as he clapped Steve on the back and teased, “They think you walk around in your tightie-whities and pose for pictures!”
“My romantic prince,” Peter countered and he lightly kissed Wade’s lips. He took Wade’s words to heart however and his body began to move against Wade’s. Their cocks rubbed together and they both gasped into each other’s mouths.
Comprehension dawned on Tony’s face and he said, “Okay, can you at least wait another hour so I can get a cleaning crew to sanitize the shi-
There was murmuring in the room until he made his entrance. Peter stepped in and saw both of the men he was looking for sitting on the couch in the corner of the workshop.
“How much longer until I can see Tony?” Steve asked. The last he saw him, he thought he was dead. He desperately wanted to affirm with his own eyes this was not the case.
Seeing Harry again after everything that had transpired was a whole other thing. His best friend was the only one of his friends that knew everything about Peter. So Peter decided that, that factor in their relationship would not change and he asked Uncle Bruce to tell him about Venom. The only thing Peter had requested of his friend was to continue to keep his secrets but, with this new information, he asked Harry to keep this from his father as well. Norman Osborn always knew Peter was Pops’ son and had powers. Mr. Osborn was always lax in the rules concerning his only son but he might just keep his son away if he thought Peter was a threat to him…
“Oh…” Bruce sighed sadly for him. They shared a silence as Bruce struggled to find words to comfort him. Eventually, Bruce lightly grasped his arm and asked, “You wanna go blow something up?”
However, Tony kept looking at Steve, searching for that strange feeling he felt in the heat of battle. He chewed on his thumb and watched Steve as he and Monty laughed at something Jim had said. Steve’s laugh made the butterflies in Tony’s stomach flutter and his denials began to crumble.
Tony pulled back slightly and looked down to Steve. Steve picked his head off Tony’s chest and slowly met his gaze. His bright blue eyes were glassy from his shock but also held a warmth Tony never saw or, perhaps, noticed before. Tony felt drawn in by the other man’s eyes and just realized how intimate their position was, with their faces only inches from each other.
Pepper testified to the firing of Tyler and the reasons why. She also provided the video evidence of Tyler putting the Avengers’ trash into the trunk of her car that got her fired.
Steve chuckled and leaned heavily into Tony’s side. He whispered, “I wish we could get some real alone time…”
Tony gently pushed himself out of Steve’s embrace and he felt Steve’s fingers spasm slightly, like he almost was going to pull him back. He hated the idea of giving Steve false hope, but he stated, “There may be a way I can fight this…not totally stop it but stall it long enough for me to get back to the future.”
His experiment and any inkling of talking to Bruce or Vision about it was finally lost as he was immersed in Wade’s story. The background worries about his parents and Wade were stronger than those of the mix-up in his experiment.
What exactly has happened to the future and the suit will be revealed next time! Thanks for reading! :)
Pepper sent the message and put away her phone as she glared at Tony and retorted, "I would and have."
Eddie quickly pulled out his hardcover book on cell and molecular biology. It usually sat in Eddie's personal cubby beneath the table for easy access, if he wanted to refer to it. The thing was as thick as an English dictionary and Peter’s spidey-senses flared in warning. Peter could have easily dodged it but he then would have displayed his superhuman speed to most of the people in the room. Cursing Eddie, Peter raised his arm, tensing for the pain.
Steve released a breath of relief and said, “Thank you, Tony. Hopefully my ‘old friend’ is just someone they’ve made up to get me specifically to go through this door.”
“T-Tony,” he tried to warn but he could not get out any more words. His entire body shuddered as he was tipped over the edge and he came into Tony's mouth with relieved groan. Tony swallowed eagerly then released his cock with a loud pop.
The comfort of a bed and Steve’s familiar form, made Tony’s body feel sleepy but, on the inside, he was an emotional wreck.
He caught a glimpse of the dark car and Tony, void of his cap and sunglasses, slid back through the crowd to his side. He positioned himself in front of Steve and Peter and helped block Peter from the reporters with his body.
Sam shrugs, heading into the bathroom for a few seconds before returning with both of their toothbrushes and a mostly empty tube of toothpaste. "Out of town, someplace. JARVIS said he'd send us coordinates when he's found a place."
"Oh," Steve answers, very definitely surprised, but apparently he decides against looking a gift horse in the mouth; rather than asking the very legitimate question of why Tony's suddenly decided to talk to him again, he just says, "Okay, I guess we'll see you later, then. Thanks, Tony."
Sam is not. Sam has plenty of self-preservation, and a healthy amount of Steve-preservation too, which is why he’s wearing his very finest Kevlar vest and already has his hand resting on his glock as the jet touches down on the roof of Avengers Tower.
, because it's fucking ridiculous that he's trying to justify his childhood, even more so that he's trying to do so to Bruce, whose father was one of the shittiest shits to ever procreate. "Not like you guys had. No one ever hit me, or whatever."
It doesn't matter where the asset runs, whether it stops in town for a week or a night or an hour. Captain America knows it has been there, and he shows up soon after.
Well, whatever. As long as JARVIS isn't pushing him to read whatever bullshit Steve's written him, Tony really doesn't give a shit.
Steve is still asleep when Tony gets out of bed, which is not something he can remember happening before. He's always woken up first, his internal alarm set to hellishly early o'clock, and the fact that he's barely even stirred means he really must need his sleep; as much as he really doesn't want to fuck and run, Tony isn't about to wake him if he doesn't have to.
He’s Iron Man, for crying out loud. An actual goddamn superhero, with the action figures and nemeses to prove it. He’s in his own home, he has the prototype mini repulsors on his wrists if Barnes even twitches the wrong way, and JARVIS is ready to sound absolutely every alarm in the building if he needs to. There’s no need for Tony to be nervous.
It doesn't, at least not as much as Tony was hoping, but it's probably about the best he can hope for. "Yeah, I guess," he answers, leaning down to kiss her cheek again, catching a faint hint of the same perfume she's always worn, something that smells light and simple, more akin to fresh laundry than the usual overly floral old lady perfume. "Thanks, Aunt Peggy."
“Yeah,” Tony answers, taking a healthy gulp of coffee to settle his nerves before picking at his breakfast. “Yeah, I think that went okay.”
"It's fine, you can keep that," he says, nodding at his mug in Bruce's hand. "I'll get a fresh one."
Tony looks him in the eye, reaching for Steve’s hand; Steve takes it, allowing Tony to pull him close again. “I definitely didn’t regret anything we did then, or any other time, and I very definitely won’t regret anything we do now.”
It's something he's avoided doing for fucking months, no talking to Steve about Bucky Barnes or basically anything else apart from when they've all been called in on the same fight, but maybe Peggy's right. With this visit, Tony has found out just about everything he can, and he doesn't honestly think he's angry with Steve so much as he's just plain
“It is for him,” Barnes answers, resorting to stating the fucking obvious because Stark clearly isn't getting it. “Look, it's not like I want to be recaptured by fascists, tortured into being their puppet and then put down for the good of humanity. But if it does happen, and if I'm not able to take myself out before they break me, I don't want Steve to have to live with being the one who kills me. You're about the only person I can count on to make sure he doesn't have to.”
Steve pulls a face like he's about to object, which, no. Tony's not arguing with him about this. If Steve wants to sleep in that shitty little car, that's his prerogative, but Tony is spending the night in whatever hotel JARVIS has found for them.
Sadly, it’s too late for Sam to try beat some sense into him; the elevator doors slide open, and they both step out. Sam pushes in front of Steve (because, as the person prepared to shoot if they’re attacked, he is definitely the one who ought to go first, even if he’s not as durable as Steve is), and enters Steve’s living space with an appropriate level of caution.
He's on his own at a table in the corner, far enough off to the side that none of the waitstaff seem to be trying to hurry him away even though his plate is empty. Steve joins him, nudging an empty chair out with his foot and dropping into it heavily, frowning down at his plate.
“Very good, Sir,” JARVIS says, relaunching all the holograms Tony closed down when JARVIS first told him Barnes was out and about.
Besides, her words have reminded him that there's still one more question he wants to ask, and it should hopefully be innocuous enough not to cause her distress. "Was Bucky a good man, do you think?"
He stands up, feet still on the couch cushions, then hops to the ground. “Yep,” he says lightly. “That’s what I’ll do. You want another beer?”
kind of firm). He's the only one of them still sat down, not that Tony knows when in the argument he stood up.
His entire body hurt from the fumbling he took and his head spun like a merry-go-round. If his head didn’t right itself soon he was going to be sick and the smell of the rotting food wasn’t helping.
Steve lightly kissed his cheek and pulled his phone out of his pocket. His voice was all business as he answered, "This is Steve Rogers."
“I miss you too,” Tony whispered back after a long pause. “But I do not…” Tony sighed heavily and murmured, “We need to have this discussion face-to-face. I am not going to have a heart-to-heart with you over the phone…mostly because I am not going to factor out the make-up sex and because it’s better to do this in person. But I also want make-up sex…and a ton of it.”
This was the first time he’d seen what Wade was wearing and the man needed to stay in bed because he was in nothing but tight, white
Yes, that was perfect. He would cripple the Captain by using that humanity he possessed. The Captain and Erskine thought the Captain better than the Red Skull because the Captain had “heart.”
“That’s not healthy,” Steve replied with a frown. “You should get some sleep right now…Peter and I can go.”
“Steve,” Bruce whispered, sounding somewhat speechless, and drawing both his and Tony’s attentions. “You were right, this is a symbiote, but it’s been
Steve nestled his face against Tony’s hair and his heavy arm draped over his side, drawing him closer to him.
“It’s alright, Peggy, I just…” Steve began lifting his head to meet her eyes. The words died in his throat when he suddenly caught sight of Tony over her shoulder, walking through the camp and looking around as if he was searching for something…more likely someone…
Steve pulled back slightly and Tony groaned in protest as he tried to pull Steve back down. Steve let him pull him close enough that their noses touched. He asked, “Where are you, Tony? Are you safe?”
Many religious organizations claimed it to be a gift from their god or gods and the S.I. Organization did not confirm or deny their statements (a century later it will come to light that certain Norse Gods had a hand in creating the soul implant but that’s another story…).
He dialed Fury, held the phone up to his ear, and the Director picked up on the first ring. Coulson stated, “Sir, we’ve got a problem.”
“...No, he did not,” Tony replied carefully. “I know this may sound shocking but Richard Parker was not your birthfather. Your birthfather was disallowed involvement in your life.”
Steve smothered a chuckle then mockingly gasped, “Tony! What happened? You just spoke in first-person??”
Wade touched his bare cheek and murmured, “Oh, yeah.” He stopped wearing the mask around Peter and hadn’t gotten around to putting it back on since he and Peter were
“Why what?” Tony deflected the question but, by the way he tensed beneath Steve’s fingers, he knew he knew exactly what Steve was asking.
Steve’s face flexed oddly and his gaze widened. Tony spared him just a glance before his eyes were drawn to Bucky as he replied, “It would be disastrous. The military is usually lax when it comes to the common soldiers but anyone who’s higher up…or under the public eye like Steve is…He could go to jail or worse…”
Before Peter could think more on it, Wade steadied him and that feeling drifted away in seconds, including the anger. He smiled gratefully at his boyfriend and Wade smiled back unknowingly as to why.
“I’m a bastard,” Tony hissed. “I should have kept tags on them. I did not even know my own cousins were dead! I’m horrible! I’m a horrible, horrible person! He is going to despise me!”
Peter kicked over his nightstand and he heard Wade hiss to May, “Go to your neighbors’ and call the police!”
But, most importantly for the future, Cap wasn't going to live much longer, less than half a year if he was remembering correctly, so he'll take whatever secrets he learns from Tony to the grave.
He reached out to where he knew the radio to be. His limbs shook and ached with the effort. The cold had sunk into his limbs, hardening his muscles and, as he stretched them, it felt like they were crackling open like thinning ice.
“I will find you guys later…I am actually going to meet up with someone,” Peter replied apologetically.
He’d been back in the future for weeks and he never thought to look. What if…What if the future had changed? What if Steve…
“Okay, good…everything alright? Did you need something?” Tony asked, his heart was still racing under his hand.
Tony grinned and said, “This guy could have stolen all of my technology but there’s one thing the Avenger's have that he will never have…”
Steve smiled warmly at his friend and stepped over to him to embrace him. He whispered, “I’m fine, Buck. I’m home now.” He slipped out of the hug and continued, “And now my fella’s going to give me a good shave. What more could I ask for?”
Only a couple of days ago, Peter would have freaked out with Wade holding him so, but now…his mouth was dry, his pulse was racing, and he wanted to lean back, deeper into Wade’s embrace.
She grasped the front of his shirt before he could recover and hissed, with emotion shaking her voice, “You made the biggest mistake of your life.”
When Steve woke that next morning, his arms were unpleasantly empty. He sat up with a small frown as his heart ached for the man sleeping a few feet away from him in the neighboring tent. They couldn’t risk Tony being spotted leaving his tent in the light of day so he left late last night.
He gasped, “W-who?” Code Silver meant one of the Avengers was in mortal danger or held hostage. Friday was not being forthcoming so Tony demanded, “It’s not Steve, is it?!”
They separated only centimeters to catch their breaths and stared into each other’s eyes. Steve grasped Tony’s cheek, his heart full and near to bursting from happiness and sorrow and he whispered with a yearning voice, “
“He’s grown so used to flirting that it’s probably ingrained in his soul and he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it. Don’t overthink it. He’s been looking for you for decades…Don’t doubt he’d throw that all away for a dizzy waitress.”
“Glad, I’m only a part-timer. I can’t believe some of the stuff you guys put up with,” Sam said, shaking his head. “I’m going to head out. I’ve got a meeting with the V.A…unless you need any more from me?”
Tony and Pepper had planned out who’s going and when all before lunch. Nothing could be approved without Peter’s say-so and, according to Friday, Peter was out as Spidey. He placed an alert to be notified when his son returned and went down to his lab.
Peter was wearing a nondescript shirt and plain jeans. His wild hair was untamed as it always was but he looked as handsome as the first time Wade saw him in a designer suit with his hair slicked back for his parents’ wedding.
“Who else is here, Harry?” Norman asked, leaning back into his chair as he continued to scrutinize his young son. His skin took on a green tint but, as he was sitting in a dark room, he doubted his son would notice. He hid his hands under the desk as they elongated into long claws.
, Peter,” his Pops stated, as Peter settled into Uncle Bucky’s hold, and Peter’s head jerked back in surprise.
Tony needed surgery to remove the two bullets in his torso. The one that hit his thigh was a through and through and, thankfully, did not create much damage and needed to only be patched. But he had to be anesthetized for his other injuries and the doctors promised he’d be out for only a couple of hours.
Steve fell forward and his fingers speared into the damp grass where Tony had been laying moments before. There was no sign of him.
Hello! I am back!! Sorry for the delay! Life has been supercalifragilisticexpialidociously busy! And it will remain so for the rest of this month! So the next chapter will probably take just as long to come out!
They did the quick version of the ceremony but both of them were a blubbering mess by the end of it. Even though it was a little odd, Tony thought the ceremony to be
century, he thought having a family or any kind of normal life was lost to him but Peter provided him wrong.
-!” Tony hissed in warning as the Winter Soldier took a step forward to put himself between Tony and Fury.
Fury dodged the blast from his repulsor and whipped out a large gun out of his trench coat and just as quickly shot Tony. The EMP he fired at Tony hit him in the gut and the Iron Man suit collapsed like a sack of potatoes.
“Steve?” Tony murmured sleepily. Tony lightly reached out and touched the corner of Steve’s hip. Steve was sitting up with one hand stretched out in from of him and away from Tony, pointed to the phantom whose image was now engrained in his eyes.
Steve wanted to grab him and scream that of course it was alright for him to touch him! Tony was his husband! He was the love of his life! He never needed to ask if he could touch him…But Steve did not say this because it was not entirely true…Steve wanted to throw himself into Tony’s arms but he was no longer just Tony’s husband…he was also Venom. This fact created a great divide between them that seemed uncrossable despite the fact that they were connected through their clasped hands.
“No…We knew this was going to happen sooner or later. You can give an official statement…” Peter replied, his voice at a lower level from his melancholy.
“The Goblin created Venom himself. He made it so it could fuse with Peter’s arachnid DNA. As my master so eloquently put it, ‘There’s no stopping Peter’s evolution.’ What’s done is done. He is Venom now.”
“Yes, Cap, it’s a very good thing,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. He let go of Steve’s hand before Steve could decide what to do with it. Tony paused and scrutinized him for a second before saying, “Well, you could loosen up a little…”
“Nothing happened,” Bucky whispered monotonously into the glass, speaking for the first time since they entered the car. His gaze did not break away from the window but everyone’s eyes were drawn to him, even Clint’s eyes flickered in the mirror to look at him.
The father made no move toward Venom but, instead, waited in the cage. Venom circled the cage but made no move to enter.
“He's only at 45 degrees? When do you think you’ll be able to warm him up more and wake him?” Bruce questioned as he stared at the reading.
“I don’t know much about the science about it,” Steve said with a laugh. “But it protects Peter and it’s made from his DNA and some other chemical things.”
Tony grinned slyly at Steve and crawled up his body. He collapsed on his chest, almost totally smothering the light from his arch reactor. Tony’s erection was hot and hard against his flaccid cock. However, Steve felt blood pooling back into his cock and every tiny movement made by Tony made his blood flow faster.
He put a hand over Steve’s hand and explained, “It…It’s just the darkness. Whenever I’m in it…I’m just thrown back into that moment, when I first experienced it and you-you were dead or, at least, I thought you were…” Tony grasped his arms, the remnants of the darkness still making him scared of losing him.
His weird behavior must had been because he was tired. That coupled with the trauma over the Venom incident probably was making him a little wonky. Peter chuckled and said, “Alright, you want Friday to wake you in an hour?”
“Imagine if all of this never happened with Tyler? We’d still have our heads in our asses without a clue that the other was feeling the same thing!” Tony gasped dramatically.
Still not looking at him, Steve stated, “I’m going to go and speak to Peter and Wade and apologize to them for tonight on behalf of both of us…And then I am going to Bucky’s place and sleeping there tonight.” Steve’s eyes finally met his but Tony could barely see it because his vision was starting to blur. Steve leaned forward and grasped his head. He paused but then lightly kissed Tony’s forehead and then pressed his forehead to Tony’s. Steve assured him, “I love you Tony but I am so upset with you right now. I need my space but don’t ever doubt my love for you.”
“She’s one of a kind,” Steve replied. This was home. It may have changed but he could feel that he belonged in his very bones.
Pepper put her hands on his shoulder and hissed, “Woah! Wait! You just had major surgery! You can’t move just yet!”
Tony leaned into Steve’s hold and looked down at his cards. He studied the words for a moment then slammed them face down on the podium. Behind them, Pepper groaned.
He could not stop kissing him. Steve tasted of dirt and dust but he was warm, he was there, he was not a dream, and he was
Because then he saw his father standing behind Steve’s shoulder and he was looking at Tony like he was the Nobel Peace Prize in Applied Sciences with his name stamped into it.
“I am going to check in with my friend and make sure he’s okay!” Tony hissed as his suit molded around him.
The situation with Ross when the man was trying to killing Peter and then later when he and Bucky kissed all heightened his emotions. He was an emotional wreck and was not thinking as clearly as he was right now. It was the only reason why he reacted to Bucky so strongly! He was out of his mind and he turned to the only source of love that had been a center for him for the majority of his life. From even when he had nothing he had Bucky. Bucky had always been his right-hand man and when he was in such an emotional turmoil it was no wonder he turned to Bucky for support and latched onto it, thinking it romantic love.
Tony’s eyes swept over the area until he saw the slight distortion in the air that was his suit. Had he heard it correctly?
Peter’s arms were around him in seconds and he pushed Wade out into the hallway and into the opposite wall. Peter’s tongue was down his throat in seconds and his body was pressed into his, moving almost sensually against his hips.
“You owe me a hundred dollars. Add it to my nonexistent paycheck,” Stark mocked, saluted them, and then blasted off.
Tony ran his hands through his hair, sighing heavily again, and turned to Steve. Steve looked ashamed but, when their eyes met, Tony saw that there was a smolder there purely for Tony.
Her heartrate picked up in the quiet. Had she gotten to him? Had he remembered something? Was he unwilling to kill her now?? She so badly wanted to embrace him. She’d wanted to ever since she saw he was still alive. But, she held back, conscious of the fact that he may not strong enough to overcome the murderous compulsion of his mission.
“I think I was trying to say, ‘wow’,” Peter replied and stole a quick kiss, his tongue flicking against Wade’s.
“Fuck,” Tony cursed, stepping beside Steve. “How could it not know? With the right access, one could know about anyone through social media and internet databases.”
With that thought, Steve spun around with the mindset to stop loitering and go to the Emergency Room.
Tony continued, “So, since I strived to explore the stars, I obviously studied the stars. The skies aren’t exactly the same in New York as they are in France but, there are some constellations that can be seen from anywhere on Earth.”
Steve’s pace quickened and he was kneeling in front of Tony before he knew it. He grasped Tony’s hands, forcing them out of the white-knuckle grip they were in. He gasped, “Tony, you should have called me! I would have come!”
Peter sighed heavily and pulled away from Wade's touch as he sat up on his lap. After a moment of hesitation, Wade sat up too, looking worried and he lightly placed his hands on Peter’s hips. staring at each other, eye-to-eye, Peter grasped Wade's hands and promised, “I am totally alright. I may still be a little physically banged up but I will be fine soon…Venom’s gone, everything is great.”
They reached the remains of the Avengers facility in no time and Steve exited the car with a heavy heart.
Tony frowned. After their last encounter, Steven made it very clear their association had been a coincidence and he did not want to continue it but…but Tony may need to butt into his life once more to answer these lingering questions and assuage his nagging uncertainties.
Steve leaned into Tony’s side, resting his head on his shoulder and holding one of his hands. He closed his eyes and Tony started by explaining how they got to the future and of the battle to save their future son. He trailed off when got to the part when the Goblin had crushed his reactor.
Peter let himself drop further and when he caught himself this time he slid down the glass several feet before coming to a stop. To Jarvis, he retorted, “Programming –
With his free hand, Schmidt grasped the edge of Steve’s implant that was sticking up and then looked at Steve. He whispered, “Say it.”
…” Peter gasped, his eyes overfilling again. Tony sat up as Steve rounded the bed and, in moments, his stepfather’s arms were around Peter.
“What?” Tony said, not really able to form any other words…nor look away from Steve. Steve simply smiled warmly at him, but he didn’t seem to plan to look away any time soon either.
Wade gulped and felt around the bed for wherever he dropped the bottle. As he did, Peter positioned himself over Wade and Wade’s arms moved more wildly. Wade hissed as their cocks brushed together and Peter bit back a moan.
“Steve and I can continue this elsewhere,” Tony teased and pinched Steve’s shirt arm, lightly pulling him in his direction.
It was the first time Steve was leaving Peter for an extended period and he was a nervous wreck about it. Jarvis had locked down the entire tower and Ben was there to personally watch Peter. He stopped by every weekday after work and luckily Doctor Doom choose that time to attack.
The good humor slipped away as quickly as an ice cube on a slick, vertical surface. Her instructor rounded the bench and she realized the time that remained on her timer would dwindle away in seconds so that meant…
He’d had a short fling with a guy in college but had never felt attracted to another man until now. He’d thought it’d just been a faze…he never imagined it’d happen again…and with
They quickly dressed and Peter paused before the mirror to try to tame his hair the best he could before giving up on the shaggy beast. Wade pressed a kiss onto the mess and swore, “You look adorable.”
Peter was hyperventilating and everyone around him was yelling and he could distantly hear the priority alarm going off. He closed his eyes to try to get a hold on his terror.
Steve was dragging himself out of the bed within the next hour. Outside, the night sky was giving way to the dawn of a new day and every time he looked out the window it was a different color sky outside. Once he got his land legs back underneath him, he was asking about being discharged.
“And you did the jitter bug. It’s a match made in heaven,” Tony teased Bucky, bumping him lightly with his elbow. Bucky glanced incredulously at Tony then shot Steve a look from across the counter and his gaze seemed to ask, “You’re really dating this?”
“Oh, only when the Hulk is angry, I run out of coffee...or when you look at me like that,” Tony replied.
Nothing happened. Eddie’s longshot was also a failure. Peter grumbled, “How on earth are we supposed to dispose of this? How do we tell our supervisors we have
“Thanks, Daddy…” Steve retorted drolly. Tony bit down on his lip to keep from bursting out laughing.
Being with Peter was like a fantastical dream filled with sparkly unicorns, gay rainbows, and the sweetest dick-shaped chocolate lollipops on Earth.
“Yes, Master Rogers,” Jarvis confirmed. “He currently lives in Queens with his aunt, May Parker.” All the images from the ceremony but one disappeared from the wall and that single image grew to encompass the entire wall. It was of Peter and an older woman with brown hair, streaked with grey, who Tony recognized as the wife of Tony’s eldest cousin, Ben Parker.
Coulson nodded them out and picked up his phone as they closed the door behind them. He dialed the number he knew by heart and only had to wait until the second ring until Fury picked up.
“Why?” Steve whispered before he could stop himself. His voice sounded small and sad and nothing like it usually did but he didn’t notice it.
Bruce was making quite a ruckus as he turned on various machines and Tony came in a few minutes after Steve sat on the examination table.
He said nothing as Bucky took his place or as Bruce announced that it was ready or when Bucky picked up the case with the infinity stones...or when Bruce asked Bucky if he were ready and Bucky looked to Steve.
“Those are all empty excuses and you know it. Steve would never do that. He’s lived with you for months and knows all your quirks. He’ll embrace them just like he’ll embrace everything about you that is amazing, and there are so many more good qualities about you…”
Peter rubbed his eyes furiously but, nope, he couldn’t get the image of his father and Steve, both half naked and rubbing against each other, with Steve’s hand in Tony’s pants.
“He was trying swing me to safety, but I wiggled to get some shots at the baddies and threw him off balance…” Wade murmured guiltily. “We slammed into the side of a building and he got knocked out.”
They untangled from each other and then both slipped outside the van for the leg room to change and separated the clothing between them.
“No, everything in here belongs to Stark Industries. This was never Mac’s. This belongs to your dad!” Eddie hurried back to their workstation and Peter was quick to fall in step beside him.
The team was already on the surface, but Tony was older and knew the fragility to his body oh too well.
“Okay, egghead. You are just asking for it now. Can Kilian take you back? I asked for eggs benedict not burned and definitely not scrambled…”
“So you’re going to let Bucky stay with be as long as we bunk up with a cover model? Sold. Bucky you good?” One of Bucky’s eyebrows rose, and he looked at Tony like he was crazy. Tony grinned and said, “That means yes!”
“I’m so glad I hit on you, baby boy,” Wade whispered. “Every morning I wake up in your arms feels like a miracle…”
Steve was too shocked to reply. Tony’s people came up to the car and gave them enough room to exit. He let Tony lead him out of the car and stared at all the people and cameras with a dazed expression.
He tried to think of other things like his upcoming classes or where he should patrol tonight but his mind kept straying back to Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.
Tony turned around and started to rub the soap into Steve’s skin. He circled the mesh ball down his torso until he reached his cock and he conveniently dropped it and smirked, “Oops.”
As Peter’s fingers danced across Wade’s torso and he laughed with no abandon, Peter knew at that moment that he’d want to come out to the press with him. Wade did not think well of himself but Peter could see deeper.
He just…needed to be strong. He needed a chance to breathe and collect his thoughts and then, and only then, would he be able to face this without worrying his friends or the other soldiers.
They were back at the tower and were all gathered in the community room, waiting on word for the Hulk cage from SHIELD.
“The main Jarvis connection to the Mark 42 has been lost…The suit has an emergency beta Jarvis uplink that will take over if Sir becomes comatose,” Jarvis informed them.
Tony’s eyes widened and he stared at Steve as if he held the power to turn the Earth. Everyone was waiting for Tony’s reply and were staring at him but his eyes were riveted on Steve only.
“Eliminate the problem,” Clint murmured darkly and it all clicked to Steve. Dear God. Would Hydra really kill all those people based off the results of a computer program?
She and Bucky dragged the man away as he started to hiss what sounded like nasty expletives in Russian.
Fury replied, “And if you had been a terrorist? If I had given you a courtesy call, who knows what you would have done? We could not even covertly look in on you because Jarvis would have known in seconds. Besides, we did not attack first, Stark. You fired the first shot.”
“No,” Steve gasped. He barely felt them digging the bullets out of him. His emotional pain was stronger than his physical pain. He felt like his heart was being torn apart. He loved them both but could only have one. Both men were great in their own right.
…” He gasped her name like a reverent prayer. Why was she saying this? Was it her or…or did she talk to Steve?
“We finished the suit. Yensen and I will be free soon,” Tony whispered into his lips and then drew him into another kiss.
Tony was trying to be quiet as he tried to appease the flustered Commando but he should’ve factored in the bat ears of the former Hydra assassin in residence.
Steve relaxed a fraction when his friend did not reveal Steve ulterior plans. He shot Bruce a small but grateful smile. Bruce returned a wearied smile in return but his eyes held no trust, as if he expected Steve to run away as soon as his back was turned.
“I see why he wants to but…I…” Wade looked to Peter and continued, “I’m scared of how the media will react to me and…it will change us. I know it will and I’m scared it’ll be for the worse…I don’t want to lose him, Logan…”
More blasts rocked the building but Tony ignored it in favor of checking on Steven and put his hand on his neck, feeling for a pulse. His back was an ugly mess of electrical burns and he couldn’t tell if he was breathing by the odd way his torso was twisted.
Peter’s emotions began to flutter madly within him as he considered his next words. To keep his voice steady, he carefully whispered, “Never in my mind was this an experiment and you know me well enough to understand that I would never do that with someone. Because of the life I live, I need to consider everything before I become romantic with someone. Dad… You know that I don’t want what happened to Gwen to be repeated…” Peter paused as an echo of an ache pressed into his heart as he remembered Gwen. He dropped his gaze, not wanting to see anyone’s reactions. Everyone remained silent which he was grateful for. He knew what he needed to say now but…but it was going to be hard and painful and he was hurt and angry that he was being forced to say this.
“I…I love you, Steve and I remember wishing we together. But I also remember giving up. I remember letting it go. I had given up on there being anything more than a friendship between us. There will always be an attraction, you’re gorgeous I can’t help it, but…but the love I feel toward you is only from our friendship. I…I did not realize this until recently. I’m sorry about pulling you along like that…I had only remembered those feelings or attraction and thought it was real. My kiss was just to confirm it. I have kissed…others and knew when it was love and when it was lust. What I felt toward you was lust.”
Steve bit down on his lip as his heart clenched. His emotions warred within him and he did not know how to reply. Yes, New York had always been his home but the Tower...the Tower had been more than that.
Tony groaned and popped open the lube as he gasped, “I’d have thrown it completely off its axis and careening into space if I had the chance to get to you.”
He doesn’t know why he does it. But Johnny’s phone goes off again, and he moves an inch, just so he can catch a glance at the glossy screen.
Tony swallows, tense. He’s explaining to Johnny why they don’t dispose of old post-its on the meeting room’s whiteboard, when he finally decides to face him. That nagging sensation on the side of his head, right where Johnny’s insistent eyes keep targeting him, is what makes him snap.
Is how Steve probably wants to end that phrase. Of course Tony minds. He wants to trust Steve, but he also knows he's beginning to love him deeply and doesn't like the idea of someone else trying to take him away. Still, he can't tear down the image he's so carefully crafted. He knows how powerless he is, how he only managed to get Steve’s attention by chance. If he starts acting possessive, Steve will quickly switch him for prettier, nicer, more open-minded Johnny.
He despairs. He's old and weak—he's breaking, chipping away at the edges, losing himself in a way that hurts and terrifies him, but worst of all, it's pathetic. And it all comes down to the source, he thinks.
Hearing his response, Steve smiles. It's sweet and fond, and Tony thinks he could die for the softness of that smile, for that glint in his eye.
Steve likes the sensual Tony, Tony with the sly smile and welcoming mouth, and Steve could maybe even love the Tony that never says no.
Someone from work added him to a group chat full of random people looking to hook up, and Steve happened to be there. Tony's lonely brain was foggy enough to privately reply to one of Steve’s messages.
This is not sadness, or longing, or any of those simple feelings that come and go. This isn't heartbreak. This is something that requires intervention. A disease. Normal people don't curl up in bed like he does, and they don't think about swinging from trees.
There's James, too. Steve’s childhood friend radiates a charm that only youth can provide. That's a particular kind of pain for Tony, who's nearing his forties and feels like he has nothing to offer. At least, nothing like the tight skin, painted nails, and carefree attitude that James possesses. Whenever Steve smiles at his phone with a genuine glow on his lovely face, it's sure to be James teasing him on the other side.
There's always a moment during his nights, while he's already in bed, undressed and vulnerable, when a cloud descends upon his mind. The cloud is deep, dark and heavy, impossible to diffuse. It sucks away all the light in a room that's already pitch black, turning the shadows around him into something tangible and real.
In the beginning, though, Steve seems to only have eyes for Tony. When they first meet in person, they go to the beach together, where Steve ends up holding Tony amongst the waves. Tony feels like merfolk: as if discovering a whole new world in a daze; willing to trade his soul for a set of legs to walk by Steve’s side forever.
Steve doesn't really have a stable job, but he's very consistent with his workout routines and always looks like he just stepped out the cover of a Calvin Klein editorial. He drives a vintage Harley, none of his denims are whole, and as cliché as it may sound - he makes it work.
“I want to have you too,” Tony pleaded, treading carefully over each word and unraveling Steve’s body with soft caresses. Tony was already kissed raw and flushed, aware that this particular look would help him get his way. It worked.
Tony works a boring office job, clocks in at nine every morning and yawns his days away in front of insurance forms. He has a couple of close friends and a decent relationship with his mom. His hobbies include tennis every other weekend, building circuit boards from internet tutorials, and practicing his rusty french by watching old Brigitte Bardot flicks at home.
He gets it. It's not realistic to expect the same amount of passion and interest all the time. Doesn't matter if he's still as obsessed with Steve as ever.
around Steve. He doesn't want to embarrass himself that way, not in front of Steve, who drinks whiskey like it's water and whose leather jackets always smell of gym soap and smoke.
Tony associates everything with age. He feels unattractive because he's eight years older than Steve. He thinks his skinny body will always remain the same way, unlike Steve, who changes every week and becomes more toned, more handsome, more… powerful. Tony's embarrassed to admit his left knee will never be the same. He's got a little heartburn. He's just old. Not really ancient, but old, and no doubt much older than Steve. Older than James. Older than Johnny.
“Just tonight. And I can't promise I'll enjoy it,” was all Steve managed to say in between kisses. His voice was low, unreadable.
“I trust you,” he lies, in the end. It's the way it is. He doesn't trust Steve not to cheat, not because he thinks Steve is a bad person. He just knows Steve is out of his league.
Making love with Steve is another thing altogether, though. He's so passionate, making Tony burn from the inside out. Steve is always hard and fast—Tony can't help the urge to devour every bit of him, from his neck to his nipples to the warm, wet head of his cock. He doesn't remember ever having such a strong oral fixation with anyone else, but with Steve, his mouth waters and his tongue begs him to fall to his knees, open up, and swallow himself full.
Steve tells Tony it still surprised him, because he'd always talk to Johnny about Tony, about how they're happily dating.
Johnny catches him looking, but the triumph never shows in his calculating eyes. Tony doesn’t know what sort of expression he’s making, but it must be pitiable - or at least, that’s what’s reflected on the other man’s regretful grimace. Well, it’s too bad.
Take Johnny, for example. Johnny is smart and pretty; the movie star type of good-looking that hurts to look at after a while. He's witty, sharp and
Johnny's phone keeps going off all the time. At first, its vibration is barely there, and Tony doesn’t think much of it. That’s how young people are with their phones, nowadays.
Things start to develop from there. Casually, gradually. Steve takes Tony to a nightclub and they dance, sweaty, hot bodies pressed one against the other. Tony doesn't mention that this is his first time going out in a couple of years. It would be kind of uncool, and he's careful not to display his
There's something rehearsed about the way he says it, and Tony imagines he might have been bracing for a bout of jealousy. He understands, but he isn't really that kind of person. He knows everyone likes Steve and it's no surprise he's got an admirer.
Steve is worth it. Waking up next to him and cooking him breakfast, being able to see his sleepy smile first thing in the morning, it makes it all worth it.
There are many parts of himself he needs to disguise or embellish, after that. It becomes a common occurrence in Tony's life. In order to captivate Steve, he sticks to a provocative image of dark, loose clothes and cloudy eyes. It's the adventurous Tony that Steve likes. The Tony who drinks alcohol like it doesn't make his stomach churn, who'll suck him off in a parking lot or even on the dance floor if he's wasted enough.
A month and a half after the first mention of Johnny, Tony has already managed to put it out of his mind. Mostly. Things are going well at home, even though Steve has been working overtime and slowing down on text responses. Sometimes he shows up, and other times, he does not. Tony thinks this is normal, that most relationships eventually reach a plateau when life gets in the way and the sex drive slows down.
“I’m still really pissed at you,” Tony stated but he grasped Steve’s hand and carded his fingers with Steve’s.
“Only cleaned what would be visible,” Tony explained. He bent down and lifted a pant’s leg to show the dirty skin underneath. He stated, “I figured I should move fast. I did not want you to change your mind.” Tony stepped forward and grabbed his elbow. The warmth from his touch made Steve’s head spin. His skin was touching Tony’s skin. Could Tony feel his pulse? Could he feel him shiver? Tony nodded his head to the exit and said, “Let’s go.”
“I-It’s nothing,” Tony stuttered. “We would have sued the department if we went through that again.”
When he was a teenager, he would plead with his father to let him help him in his projects or try out Tony's ideas.
“Sedated and currently housed in your old cell,” Natasha replied. “Stark is reaching out to some of the pieces of SHIELD that survived Hydra’s attack. He’s going to help them reform and have them take the Red Skull somewhere far away.”
Tony growled, “Also, I don’t want you to think we will easily forgive you if you somehow find a solution. You will need to do much more in order to gain it and maybe get rid of that guilt.”
event that he noted as being different was Bucky’s survival. Because Bucky survived he was there in the plane with Steve, he piloted while Steve devoted his entire attention to the Red Skull and was dragged into the portal because of it…from there he could only speculate. Somehow his father survived and they created a whole new company together. If something significant like Howard Stark living to an old age or the Avengers actually happening…then what other major things had changed?
Her mate looked down and ran his metal fingers across the pad of his thumb. She wondered if he could feel anything with those metal fingers. He took a moment to answer but Natasha could see his internal struggle reflected in his eyes.
Tony grinned and flew to his son’s side. Peter was crouched over the side of a building, looking down to the street below. Tony disconnected from the comms and opened his face shield. Seeing this, Peter tapped his ear and turned off the communicator beneath his mask.
Steve followed Tony’s lead and pretended like everything was alright…but, on the inside, his newly broken heart foolishly yearned for life beyond the dreamscape.
Bits of his uniform were left behind in the ice and his hands had left deep imprints into the ice as he had pushed himself out of the chair. Coulson’s jaw dropped as he examined the irrefutable evidence in front of him.
“There’s not going to be a safe landing,” Steve replied, looking at the screen in front of him with all of the red warning indicators. “But I can force her down…”
In the hour he spent there, he had a number of people ask him for an autograph or a picture. A few paparazzi somehow found him and snapped pictures of him eating from a distance. None of them approached him which he was grateful for. He did not want to deal with them.
When I tried to look up Peter Parker's birthday the best I could find was that it was in August. I choose August 20th in the end because it is Andrew Garfield's birthday so it was a win-win! :)
The man had been with him since he was born and Tony took it for granted. He naively believed he’d always be there.
Silence fell between them again, but it was calmer. Steve took comfort in his hold and the skies outside slowly cleared up.
I've been wanting to draw at least one picture for this series and I'm finally getting one out with the last chapter! But the chapter won't display the picture so, if you want to see it, here's a
When Dr. Erskine created a new serum and another super soldier, he killed the good doctor, obviating the knowledge of the serum, and then destroyed his super soldier, leaving him to die in the icy Atlantic. This made the Red Skull the only super soldier thereby the strongest man on the planet.
The hardest part was actually putting Peter to bed. They worked together to gently lower him into his crib and Tony whispered for Jarvis to keep playing the music in Peter’s room at a low volume.
“You heard me, I'm going to woo you and then progress our relationship as normal once you've fallen for me.”
"I'm only telling you this, so you'll know what happened if I don't return. I know it's stupid and it probably won't work. But I gotta try. You'd do the same, Steve. I woulda called you an idiot, but I would support you all the same..."
feared. I’m not ashamed or disgusted. I…I’m sorry if you thought that. I’m just scared. This is all too much, even more so now that the public will know.
Peter’s eyes heated up as he was overcome by emotion. He smiled at all of them tightlipped in order to keep his lips from trembling. He leaned into Steve’s touch, carded his fingers through Wade’s fingers, and basked under his aunt’s reassuring smile.
“He’s fine,” Natasha whispered. She was also crying but a small smile graced her lips. In a broken voice she gasped, “He beat it...”
He tried to catch his father’s eye but the man was glaring at Wade. So Peter asked for clarification, “I…I’m sorry?”
“Yes, agent, a man. Potts and Stark wouldn’t let me see him but they clarified Stark was in a relationship with a man,” Coulson pressed. “You really knew nothing about this?”
But Tony wasn't totally unaffected by the honeymoon fever either. During their foreplay, Steve whispered his vows again into Tony's flesh as he kissed him all over. At first, Tony listened with a bemused smile but, as he listened to his words: the declarations, the promises, and the effect he'd had on Steve's life...Tony's bemused smile wobbled as he was overcome with powerful yet simple fact that what they had was perfect. He had married his best friend, this amazing and loving man, and they couldn't possibly be happier.
Tony hurried over to the line and got his tray. Today’s tray was carved up. Hydra’s symbol had X’s over the eyes, a very voluptuous woman's body was attached to the head, and someone played tic-tax-toe in the upper left-hand corner. Tonight’s meal consisted of chicken, buttered biscuits, mashed potatoes, and boiled carrots. Tony’s stomach rumbled lightly as he smelled the meat. It was a small serving again, something that was sadly becoming a norm. He couldn’t wait to get back to the future that wasn’t so limited with something as simple as chicken.
“Love you, love,” Steve whispered, running his hand through Tony’s hair. Tony nuzzle his head deeper into Steve’s grip and lay his head on Steve’s bicep.
Bucky shook his head and Tony said, “Okay, well, I’m going to go downstairs to my workshop then. If you need me, I’ll probably be there for the next couple of hours! Come to me for anything, okay?”
Alright, she was intrigued but was nowhere near swooning. Even if her heart was beating faster with an emotion she couldn't clearly define.
She paused before the door then, ever so carefully, pushed it open. Her eyes focused on Peter’s small form. His back was to her but, as soon as her eyes fell on him, she felt what she could only categorize as a strange lurch inside her.
Pepper departs for her next meeting shortly after this, while Bruce remains in the kitchen, picking at another slice of cake and trying to decide if he really wants to meddle in Tony's personal life the way he's about to. Reluctantly, he thinks he does, but he's also well aware of how inquisitive his friends are, and in the event that he is wrong he would prefer not to accidentally start a rumour that will undoubtedly work its way back to Steve and Tony eventually.
He knows Steve would answer, if he asked, as would Sam, but he thinks it would hurt Steve to know that he’s asking about Natalia and barely able to speak to him. He’s trying, but Steve knows everything about who Barnes used to be while Barnes is barely scraping by in return, and he doesn’t know how to ask Steve without it seeming like it he cares more for someone who isn’t there than he does for the person who is.
“You told me to drink this first,” Steve says, holding up the mug of barely warm coffee. He’s stalling, and he’s not being remotely subtle about it, but he’s only just got Bucky back and… And he’s been scared, if he’s being honest, that coming out would change the way Bucky thinks of him, that the trust he’s so carefully been cultivating would be shattered, that the friendship he’s trying to rebuild would be irreparably damaged.
putting stuff away again. He’ll do emotional support and gallant loser at anything from poker to hand-to-hand, but he draws the line at housekeeper) before sitting down.
"Crap," Steve mutters under his breath. He picks up the papers and sits down in their place, bracing himself for the Conversation he's going to be subjected to as soon as Sam returns with their clean clothes. "
He holds back that first instinct, though, which is maybe a good thing because his second thought is that, even as pissed off as he is, Tony doesn't want to be responsible for Steve coming to harm.
"How long have we got?" Steve asks, jerking into motion, scooping up the few articles of clothing that have escaped from his duffle bag; he has to be ready when the jet gets here,
Bruce shakes his head, thinking back over the last few… months, really; certainly, Tony has been both more maudlin and more irritable since they returned from Barcelona, but his behaviour changed before that. Tony's reclusivity, his increased determination to seal himself inside his workshop and never leave, his shift from eagerness to sullen reluctance to get involved in missions – all of this started months ago, and whilst at the time Bruce put it down to the revelation about his parents' deaths, he has to wonder if perhaps that wasn't the only reason.
Nathalie slides her oversized shades up to rest on top of her head before stepping inside, picking up a basket and following a zig-zag route around the grocery store. She’s already stocked up on non-perishables on her first few days in town – canned goods, flour, sugar, powdered milk, coffee, all those other boring things it'll be useful to have waiting in the cupboards next time she needs to get away from the city for a few days – so this trip is purely for things she
“Jesus, Steve,” Tony says again, even quieter this time. “Come here, you big dope,” he says, halfway between instruction and invitation, standing up and holding out his arms.
He sits up slowly and very carefully, propping himself up against the leg of his work bench, forehead pressed against his knees as he tries to remember how to breathe without vomiting.
He spins his stool around, standing up and weaving his way through the shop to the coffee maker. There's still some in the pot, but Tony's fairly sure DUM-E made it; he empties it down the sink without bothering to try work out what today's unconventional ingredients are, then sets about making a new pot.
," Bruce cuts in, with yet another fucking sigh. "This'll go better if you're honest. With yourself, even if you won't be honest with me."
"Won't it?" Tony answers, eyes on the display in front of him, tracking each line of code that scrolls past.
“Off,” he says insistently, tugging at the fabric bunched at Steve’s armpits until Steve raises his arms and shifts back just far enough for Tony to get him all the way out of his shirt. He runs his hands down Steve’s torso, all the way from his shoulders to the waistband of his trousers, nails dragging every place he knows is going to make Steve shiver, rocking his hips into Tony’s.
situation. First with the wings, which make the set he had before look like Icarus' wax-and-feathers model. He knows the originals weren't actually clunky or difficult to control, once he figured out how to steer and, you know, got used to the fact that he was freaking flying, but these are… They're insane, is what they are. He's flying by instinct, controls so smooth and so intuitive he barely has to think what he wants to do, wings more like an extension of himself than technology he has to put on and take off.
Tony's workshop is as noisy as it usually is, a combination of robotic beeps, angry hammering and rock blasted loud enough that Clint wants to turn off his hearing aids. Fortunately, the hammering and the music break off as soon as Tony realises he's there, before he has the chance to acquire any more damage than he already has. Unfortunately, the ensuing almost silence isn't actually a whole lot better.
expression (and if it's true that practice makes perfect, working with the Avengers means that expression has to be as close as it gets), and Tony huffs a loud, exaggerated sigh. "What I
Tony pulls up another screen alongside the file and the specs for the gauntlets, then keys in the code to start running diagnostics. He's not sure what he's expecting to find, or even if he's expecting anything, but he's not good at doing nothing.
He knows how it'll go, because it's happened seventeen times since he met Sam: Sam will give him his
"Well, that's… something, I suppose," Pepper manages, thinking she perhaps might be a little more pleased with the end of Tony's reclusivity if it didn't also involve him disappearing who knows where at a very inopportune moment.
Barnes frowns, though since he’s only doing so now rather than a few moments ago Tony decides to believe it’s because he’s trying to remember rather than because he’s offended. Tony doesn’t try to hurry him, figuring he’d rather get the very slow, considered answer that Barnes is sure about than a rushed one he might later change his mind about.
[His primary purpose is, as ever, to protect Sir, from himself as much as from other people. JARVIS can hardly be blamed if doing so requires him to occasionally withhold information.]
“You’re sure you’re okay with this?” Steve asks, reemerging from his bedroom dressed in the sort of clothes Barnes saw lots of people wear for exercise before Stark found him, except Steve’s running clothes fit much tighter than most people’s.
“Way Steve spins it, you weren’t you at the time,” he tells the gears, which is still a whole lot ballsier than Barnes was expecting from a man who can’t enter a fight unless he’s wearing dangerously colourful armour.
(because Tony built him, didn't he, so he knows how much processing power JARVIS has and therefore knows he could have run all possible interpretations of and responses to Tony's words in a fraction of that time; obviously J is making a point, even if he hasn't let on what that point is yet).
“We showed him his room after we ate, and it didn’t seem like he wanted to leave,” Steve explains. “Sam thinks it’s important that he knows that’s his space, so we’re trying not to bother him when he’s in there. Plus, I wanted to thank you.” He pauses, looking conflicted, sort of leaning towards Tony like he wants to come closer but doesn’t know if he’s allowed. “Not that I have any idea how I’m supposed to thank you, Tony.”
At this, Barnes very definitely does react, but since it’s a flinch Sam isn’t sure it actually counts as an improvement.
Wilson looks at him, not entirely approvingly. "D'you think that's a question you should be asking him instead?"
His outburst is met with silence, even from JARVIS, and Tony lurches up from the sofa, storming across to the coffee pot and pouring himself another cup. He's halfway through it before he feels balanced enough to turn around again, leaning back against the counter and looking back at Bruce.
The third door leads onto the rest of the floor. Like the door to the bathroom, it has a lock on it. Also like the door to the bathroom, the lock only engages from the inside.
The blueprints show how those beautiful, clean circuits attach to the muscles, tendons, nerves and whatever the fuck else was left in the Soldier's shoulder. They show how the Soldier's body had to be reinforced to support the weight of the arm, bones pinned and plated and in some cases actually fucking replaced by mental replicas.
The asset falters, confused. “Steve said it was okay,” he answers slowly, before it occurs to him that his alarm is probably due to the fact that anyone sitting on a rooftop at this hour probably doesn’t want company. “Sorry, I’ll… I’ll go.”
Tony heads up the ramp to help out, pulling out the box containing the wingpack from the kit locker and entering the sixteen-digit setup code for the biometric lock. "Hand here," he instructs, pointing to the correct panel, then inputting the secondary confirmation code.
"What?" Steve asks, because it's apparently his turn not to understand; there's no doubt in his mind that the coordinates he's been getting have come from JARVIS, but if he's not doing so on Tony's instructions then why
enough, but then the only thing he thinks would actually be sufficiently reassuring is Stark promising to empty a clip into his brain the second it becomes clear he’s going to fall into Hydra’s hands again.
"Sir, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Wilson departed the tower approximately fifty-three hours ago," JARVIS reports, when Tony's had enough time to decide that he needs to know, even if he's still not entirely sure that he wants to. "They are currently investigating a Hydra base in Springfield, Pennsylvania. Would you like me to connect you to their communications system?"
He gets back to their room to find his duffel bag lying on the foot of his bed, empty, right next to a stack of carefully uncrinkled doodles.
a laugh, either. It seems redundant to say it's the first sound Clint has heard from him, given that he's only just got his hearing back, but from the way the guy startles Clint thinks it actually
, says his inner Rhodey (Pepper calls it his conscience, but she’s clearly never heard it), and, as ever, Rhodey is right. It’s a shitty thing to say, and Tony regrets it, he does, but Steve’s talking before he can get out the apology he definitely owes him.
“You would?” Steve asks, which is about when Tony has to stand up and round the table, still holding his hand, only stretching his arm in a very slightly uncomfortable way in order to do so.
"That wasn't-" Tony cuts himself off, not sure how to say what he means. It's not so much that he's angry JARVIS is still following that instruction – that would be like saying he
"Right," Clint agrees, since that seems to be the answer Tony's looking for, and he's clearly invested enough in his unnecessary but not unwelcome project that Clint won't be able to change his mind. "So, that's a net arrow, and the molecular whatever, that's glue, yeah?" Tony nods, and Clint waves at the next unopened file, intriguingly named
sort of voice; Jim recognises it from all the times he's tried to warn him against doing something particularly self-destructive, only for Tony to do it anyway and somehow walk out the other side in one piece. “Okay. Cliff notes. Short and sweet. I got this.”
Tony's still giving him that look, and the way he says, "Steve," so very kind and uncharacteristically careful, is enough that Steve works out where he recognises that expression from: it's the same way Sam and Natasha looked at him in the van, like he's almost painfully concerned for him. "I'm trying not to be insensitive here – and, believe me, this is probably the first time ever I can honestly say that, ask Pepper, she'll tell you I love being insensitive, and- That absolutely isn't the point, is it, and now you're giving me
The sound of Tony's repulsor powering up is both noticeable and more than a little threatening, and the Soldier's half flinch is gratifying enough to make up for the time Tony spent adding a completely cosmetic sound effect to his silently engineered weaponry.
The bath products smell familiar, even if the asset can’t work out why or where from. He doesn’t use them.
"Seconded," Maria answers; in her opinion, any spider too big to fit down the plug hole merits a resolute
Barnes isn't sure what his face is doing, but given Stark’s reaction it's definitely doing something it doesn't normally; Stark laughs, short and not entirely amused. “Why so surprised?” he asks. “Believe me, I don't want to be a terrorist group’s plaything anymore than you do. One of those t-shirts is more than enough, you know?” Barnes
Clearly, thoroughly enjoyable sex followed by sleeping a full eight hours has completely addled Tony's brain, otherwise he would have realised that waking up at half past ten in the morning in Barcelona still gives him over three hours to get back to Manhattan for the meeting at eight.
Barnes shakes his head, still not sure what he’s supposed to say or do here. It’s therefore reassuring that Clint doesn’t seem to be expecting anything in particular, still relaxed in his perch atop the couchback.
"Fantastic," he answers, over the thud of his fists on what Sam can only assume is a thoroughly reinforced Stark-made material. "On top of the goddamn world, Sam."
“I didn’t mean to suggest he has control over your actions, Tony,” Thor answers (or doesn’t, really, since it in no way resolves Tony’s query), his words coming quickly and sounding very serious. “I do not believe Steve would take advantage of your relationship like that.”
It’d be easier to scrap it and start over, Tony’s quite sure, and there’s no question at all that he could do better. He’s not going to, because Tony might let pitiful reformed murderers live in his home and monopolise his ex-friend-with-benefits, but he’s not going to spend hours of his life building a brand new, state of the art prosthetic for the guy. Even if starting up a line in brand new, state of the art prosthetics is the kind of business decision that would make Pepper cry in happiness rather than frustration and absolutely no one could object to him using the Winter Soldier for human trials: if they say it’s immoral to attach untested tech to a human being, Tony can point out that he’s a mass murderer; if they say it’s not fair to give a mass murderer the best prosthetic the world has ever known, Tony can tell them it’s untested tech and who knows how it might turn out.
The other end of the phone is momentarily every bit as silent as Sam's judgement, and then there's a voice, clearly a recording, with a background of road traffic, staticky radio and people talking.
His time on the run had him liking his invisibility, finding it so much better than being noticed, but he's got used to people seeing him over the last couple of years; Bruce knows it's his issue, but between Steve not talking to him in the kitchen the day before yesterday (hell, Steve not even letting Bruce know he was back in town, which he's always gone out of his way to do in the past) and Tony glaring daggers at a paused holograph rather than looking at him, Bruce is perhaps feeling a little too sensitive.
He puts the toothpaste and his toothbrush in his washbag, then chucks Steve's at him, mock-glaring when Steve catches it.
"I left a note. Yeah, I fucked up the time difference, and yeah, I left while he was sleeping, but I left him a note asking him to call so we could talk about it and figure out if there was a way we could work given the whole
"It's not ideal," Steve says through the comms from where he's trying to corral Hulk. "But we've managed it before."
"What the hell, JARVIS?" Tony interrupts, specifically angry with his AI for the first time in quite a while. "Read."
He accepts Clint Clint Barton’s hand, though he lets go as quickly as he can, immediately taking a step back.
"Pep, come on, I have Avengers stuff," he protests, wafting his hand around to indicate the inside of the quinjet, the Iron Man suit standing sentry in the corner, and Bruce at the controls. "Important, save the world type stuff. I can't just drop it because the board are getting antsy."
"Really. Bucky was… I won't tell you I didn't love him – I did, more than anything – but not like that."
suggestion fast enough to give Steve whiplash. Steve wanted something involving dinner and a movie, walks in the park, and arguing with the press about how he had the right to date anyone he pleased, and Tony made it quite clear he didn't want a relationship outside of the bedroom.
, Tony thinks. He’ll graciously accept Steve breaking up with him, but he’s not going to let him do the
“He is, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS replies, pausing for a moment before adding, “Do try not to hurt him, won’t you?”
“Want me to try get in touch with her?” Clint offers. “Might take a couple of days, but I’m happy to do it. She’s been off-grid for a while now, actually. About time she came back again.”
” No, she's in a public place, that can't be her question; her Nathalie Rousseau identity can survive a few minutes without the smile and the bubbliness, but asking if anyone’s dead is much too noticeable. “
In truth, he thought that it would be Steve, crashing onto the asset's rooftop with all the subtlety of a mallet.
“Nah,” Bucky agrees. “Won’t have to. Hey, Wilson,” he adds, as Sam returns from breakfast, JARVIS apparently having decided his exile to the communal floor is at an end. “Get your ass in here. Steve’s gonna ask Stark to go steady, and since my wooing experience is rusty and his is goddamn non-existent, it’s on you to make sure he doesn’t fuck it up again.”
"Yes, I think they might have," Bruce agrees softly, while Tony is still gaping as JARVIS' disloyalty (because the
It doesn’t last, of course; Bucky tenses up the moment he realises Steve is there, pulling away from Natasha, though she makes zero effort to move.
Bucky made no secret of the fact that Steve was the centre of his universe, and it turns out that's the kind of thing that sticks around.
Steve throws a final punch, sending the bag flying into the wall about six feet from Tony. It’s more the thud than the proximity that makes him flinch, because even when he’s as angry as this Steve is still completely in control, but the reaction alone is enough to make Steve look terrible.
goes unspoken, and Tony reminds himself that it's not Peggy, just her illness making her short-tempered and downright mean, sometimes. Peggy loves him, even if she sometimes forgets that.
He stops, then, his hands closing around Tony’s, gently but firmly preventing him from unfastening his belt. “Tony,” he says again, but it’s far closer to his normal voice this time, serious and decidedly not how Tony wants him to be sounding. “Hang on, slow down a minute. Are you sure you want to do this, Tony?”
The other end of the call is silent, and then a very familiar voice says, “France, I take it. How’s it going?”
"The locations you've been sending us," Steve explains, because he is extremely grateful that despite his anger Tony is still willing to help, even if he's getting a middleman to do the actual sharing of information. "Or the ones JARVIS has been sending, but I figured it was because you told him to, right?"
"No, maybe not," Bruce agrees. "Still, I think you should consider calling him. At the very least, he owes you an explanation."
The Soldier makes a noise a bit like Jarvis' rocking chair used to make while he read Tony his bedtime story, all
look; Steve will say he's fine; Sam will sigh, tell him, "yeah, okay, but you know it's okay not to be fine?" and then come up with an anecdote that manages to make light of what Steve's thinking without making fun of it, all without Steve actually saying what he's thinking. It usually ends with Sam giving him a hug and Steve feeling painfully like crying without being entirely sure why.
(He might not be at the L-word, not quite yet, but he can see it coming, now that he’s letting himself look.)
The first page isn't so bad, really. Mostly just the facts behind the Russians finding Barnes, the location, time, a few details about his injuries: an assortment of broken bones, a fair few cuts and bruises, his left arm mangled beyond saving.
silences, so neither one of them particularly bothers him; he has, after all, lost himself in his work on more than one occasion, so it'd be hypocritical of him to object to that. This, on the other hand, is Tony very deliberately not talking to him, and it feels an awful lot like he's back to being the loser with the bruises, thrift store clothes and taped up glasses, invisible to all the other kids unless they were looking for a punching bag or someone to cheat off.
Steve continues staring at him for what Sam thinks is probably slightly too long (he’d certainly be uncomfortable with it, if he was the focus of that much prolonged attention), then nods jerkily, making his way to the elevator.
Bruce sits down next to him, his expression the spitting image of Tony's high school principal whenever Tony accidentally managed to piss him off. "This isn't some gossip session, Tony," Bruce tells him firmly. "You're clearly miserable as hell, and since there's no chance you'll speak to an actual therapist, I figured you'd prefer talking to someone who knows who you're upset over. But if you'd rather I got Pepper, I can do that."
, let's just leave it at that, but the things in this file, the things they did to a man who was by all accounts loyal and honest and
, because that’s who he is going to be now ‒ is expecting Clint to say something about it, but all he does is smile again, clap Barnes on the arm, and say, “Okay, cool. Like I said, it’s good to meet you for real, Barnes. Hey, you disappeared last time before I could offer, but I totally owe you a beer, you want one?”
"That was fucking rhetorical! He murdered my parents! There's nothing you can say to justify helping Steve find him,
He steps closer, then goes to his knees, folding Steve into his arms, and does his very best to hold him together.
"Right, sure, but, in my defence, I was avoiding dealing with massive amounts of trauma when the giant rabbit happened."
"Is that it?" Tony asks, flipping up his faceplate to glare at the closest barely conscious body on the floor. "You called us in just for that?"
"I have, Sir," JARVIS agrees, still unrepentant. "I was under the impression you would want me to do so."
Half the time, Steve doesn't even realise he's doing it. Or, rather, he knows he's drawing, but it doesn't really register until he looks down and sees that ridiculous monkey chasing after things it can't have, his mental state spread across the page for anyone to see.
Natasha sighs down the phone at him, like Tony doesn't know that any sign of emotion she expresses is nothing more than an affectation.
The other three are silent for a bit, and then Pepper tilts her head to one side and says, "Should we be worried about this? It's so hard to tell with you all."
could deserve what they did to him)… Tony's been beaten and shocked, cut up and drowned, over and over until he begged his captors and the universe to please just let him die, but that's nothing, absolutely fucking
"Not even a little bit," she answers, laughing. "There is no doubt in my mind that I'd have been out on my arse in a flash if I'd taken him up on the offer."
Precisely twenty minutes after she hung up on him, JARVIS announces the arrival of Natasha's email. She has to have done it deliberately – not even the Black Widow can so perfectly gauge the time it'll take to finish a mission – and Tony spares half a second to be irritated at her for making him wait before flicking away the footage of the Winter Soldier in action, replacing it with holograms of every page of the file Natasha's sent. He picks back up the gauntlet he's been fiddling with (not altering, not improving, just fiddling, checking it's in good working order despite the fact that JARVIS would report it if there was a problem) while he waited.
The masters aren't hunting for the asset. Captain America is, but he's expecting the asset to keep moving, not visit the place that its body once called home.
Assuming Tony ever leaves his office, that is; it’s currently getting on for nine in the evening, and Steve is still waiting for him.
At that, Steve falters again, because even if he has been an idiot with demonstrably poor interpersonal skills, at least in this much Bucky is wrong. “Buck, he doesn’t feel like that about me. We’re not- we’re just fooling around.”
Given that Steve was expecting to encounter at best some broken furniture and at worst a full panic attack, he thinks he’s allowed to be a little surprised by this, though he’s still not sure that excuses the fact that it takes him thirty seconds to come up with a response. Even worse, that response is only a concerned, “Alien?”
Finally, just after noon, JARVIS announces that Tony has just flown into his workshop (unexpected, since Pepper was sure he took the Aston for his impromptu day trip), and that she has approximately three minutes to get to the roof before he leaves again.
) in. Bruce misses Pepper. Due to his friends' aforementioned failure to recognise his lack of psychological training, Bruce knows that Pepper and Tony's on-again off-again relationship wasn't making either of them happy, that Pepper spent most of her time worrying about Tony and Tony's idea of a solution was to make enormous and poorly thought out romantic gestures that he couldn't actually follow through on, that they're both happier now that things are permanently off between them, but Bruce misses her thoughtful, rational presence all the same, and not just because he's now the one JARVIS deems most capable of convincing Tony to leave his workshop after having locked himself in there for over forty-eight hours.
“New?” Bucky says, incredulous. “Steve, I’ve known you were a fairy since I caught you ogling Jimmy Hauptman back when we were fifteen. Do you actually think that’s what I’m pissed at you for?”
There's only an inch of scotch left in the bottle he's been steadily making his way through since Bruce's visit earlier, and there's no point at all putting the lid back on it at this point; Tony throws it back, leaves the empty bottle on the desk for DUM-E to take care of, and stumbles over to the elevator.
They’re all more-or-less finished and squabbling about whose turn it is to do the washing up when Tony arrives, at which point the light-hearted arguing comes to a very sudden halt.
Either FHD has impeccable taste in kitchenware, or he's properly tooled up, and Clint thinks he can probably guess which one it is.
Barnes was not expecting that, not at all, and it takes him a long time to really understand. It sounds like Steve is asking his permission, but that’s so patently ridiculous it obviously can’t be the case. Barnes can’t remember Steve ever waiting for anyone’s permission, let alone his, and the idea that he might start now that Barnes is barely even himself is just stupid.
," he starts, before remembering that acknowledging Tony's attempts at distraction only ever encourages him; Steve might as well jump right in with what he actually has to say, because if he waits until Tony stops trying to avoid a serious discussion he's going to be waiting a heck of a long time. "He's Bucky. The Winter Soldier is Bucky."
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing now?” he asks, looking down at himself like he thinks his clothes might have changed since he put them on.
He reads it, then reads it a second time before folding it back up, pressing it flat along the same creases Steve left in it.
The asset was prepared for it to be the archer. He was almost prepared for it to be his spiderling, all grown up and even more deadly than the asset remembers her, or Ca-
Once a scan for heat signatures reveals that the four of them are the only people left above ground, they regroup at the elevator, where it takes Tony a matter of seconds to override the security and get them access to where they want to be.
"Sorry, what?" Tony asks, then directs his next question elsewhere. "He's not actually holding hostage the beer that
"I did wonder," he says, attempting to prompt Steve into something resembling a healthy way of dealing with his feelings. "The way you talked about him seemed a little more than just friendly."
It’s a little overcooked for Tony’s taste, but not inedibly so, and neither he nor Steve speaks for a few mouthfuls. The silence is unutterably awkward, but even if Tony’s willing to eat the
There’s a lot of conditionals in there, but it’s also a lot closer to an affirmative than anything Stark’s said so far and Barnes thinks the man wasn’t lying when he said it was the best he’s going to get. And it
JARVIS does his passive aggressive silence thing again, judging Tony for whatever he's apparently done wrong this time, but the elevator descends anyway so it hardly matters, at least not until it stops at what is very much not his workshop.
All of a sudden, the determined confidence she used to chase Steve out of the apartment is gone, and the woman beside him looks an awful lot younger, and something very close to vulnerable.
The Soldier nods again, placing his right hand on the back of his head. His left arm makes a hideous grating noise, but doesn't actually make it a whole lot closer to his head.
Steve sits up the second it does, reaching for the note, hoping against hope that it'll tell him something else, something good, something to convince him that this isn't what he thinks it is.
JARVIS doesn’t answer, so Tony no longer has an excuse for not looking at Steve. “Okay,” he says, after a few seconds of watching Steve fidget uncomfortably, his thumbs tapping against each finger in turn, the movement rapid and a little uneven. Nervous, Tony thinks, though he’s got no idea what Steve has to be nervous about.
“Mostly just that,” he says. “Think he wanted to know you were okay after he shot you. Called you Natalia, wasn’t sure if I should tell him you don’t go by that anymore.”
The name hits him just as sharply as it always does, filling him with a stinging blend of grief and resentment. Howard might have been a distant and fairly shitty father, but Tony loved him all the same, and it's not fair that he's gone, that he and Maria were murdered for whatever the fuck Hydra wanted them murdered for (all his searching, and still Tony hasn't managed to find an actual motive behind their deaths). It fucking sucks that Tony's been an orphan for more years than he hasn't and he's still stuck in Howard's shadow, that he can't hear his name without his brain automatically adding
His quiver is on the table, too, with what looks like the same number of arrows he had before, but his bow…
Tony halts his endless, restless fidgeting, even his hands falling still on the screwdriver he's been flipping from one hand to the other since Bruce entered the room.
Clint holds his gaze a moment, then nods once, sharply. “Okay,” he says, no longer serious. “Unsolicited advice over and done with. If you ever want to talk, or to sit and absolutely not talk, JARVIS’ll know where to find me, and until then I’ll leave it at that, unless there’s anything you want to ask.”
“Bucky was so insistent, though,” he says, like Barnes has seen them interacting enough to make a statement either way. No sooner has Tony thought it than Steve very effectively counters it, “And I figured he was wrong, obviously, but then when Sam came up he didn’t even question it. They both acted like it was a fact, insisting I should tell you, and I had to wonder if I agreed too quickly when you suggested such a casual relationship.”
So, he's not objecting, not really, but he's not exactly agreeing, either. Nevermind fairness, nevermind right or wrong; the fact remains that the folder contains information about the man who killed Tony's parents and Tony's pretty sure that takes precedence over the fact that that man was also Steve's best friend.
He fills a plate from the breakfast buffet, piled high enough that he gets dirty looks from more than one member of staff, and apathetically prepares himself tea in the largest mug he can find (Peggy used to extol the virtues of a good cup of tea, and since caffeine does nothing for him Steve figures he might as well give it a try) before scanning the room for wherever Sam's sat.
“Or maybe you just need to think better of yourself, Iron Man,” Steve bounces back, like telling the self-proclaimed narcissist he should have a higher opinion of himself isn’t complete bullshit. “I do love him,” he continues, ignoring Tony’s grimace completely, “but not the way I think you think I do, okay?”
Clint tips back on his chair, drags his next piece of sushi through the puddle of soy sauce in the middle of his place, and laughs. "Nah," he says, "'S just an average Tuesday, this."
"Tony," he says, after swiping at his phone screen, not making much effort to sound like he's not freaking out. "What's happened? Is everything okay?"
Bucky sighs, dropping to the couch at Steve’s side. “Okay, maybe then, but have you talked about it since? At all?”
That, Bruce thinks, is an interesting way of putting it. Again, there's a possibility he's over-thinking this, but JARVIS specifically said he can't give
If there are any lights on the roof, the voice hasn’t turned them on for him, but the ambient light of the city is more than enough for the asset to see by. He’s not up there to sit, so the asset bypasses the furniture, instead pacing a careful route around the edge of the rooftop, scoping it out for possible threats. There’s any number of acceptable hiding places, though none are occupied, and while there’s plenty of buildings with a clear line of sight at parts of the roof, there’s nowhere that would allow a potential assassin to cover all of it; although it clearly wasn’t designed by someone with any experience in assassinations, it’s also not as vulnerable to attacks other places the asset has been.
JARVIS hesitates a moment before replying. "There is an emergency staircase down the hall to your left, Sir. If you wish to use it, I will not prevent it."
Again, let me say thank you to Chalenmimi, for being the most supportive and patient and all around wonderful artist a gal could hope for.
The display is impressive enough that Sam watches from the doorway a moment, trying to work out how Steve's gone from being equal parts pleased to be home and anxious to start the hunt for the Winter Soldier to being six foot whatever of barely contained anger.
"Sam," he corrects absently, dragging his hands down his face in an attempt to get a little closer to awake. It takes a moment, a stretch and shoulder roll that has his spine clicking, and then, "Holy shit. The house is talking to me, Merry," because under the wings and the chill Sam is actually a gigantic dork.
Tony's in his armour, the strongest, sturdiest version he's built so far, utterly impenetrable to everything Tony can think of to test it against, tough enough to bring in the Winter Soldier without getting so much a scratch. It's also the most heavily armed version, the only time he's created himself a suit with more weapons than any of the War Machine ones, deadly enough to take out the Winter Soldier without needing to get close.
Cookery, it has to be said, is not Steve’s strong suit. He can manage toast and cereal, not that those entirely count as cooking, and his skills at boiling pasta and heating up a jar of sauce are unparalleled, but when it comes to preparing something that might actually count as a healthy, home-cooked meal, he’s somewhat less competent.
He dries himself just as quickly, then pulls on the clothes he was wearing last night, checking his pockets for his cellphone and room key. They're both still there, along with a text message from Sam letting Steve know he's gone down to breakfast and that he should join him if he ever wakes up.
"That's…" Tony starts, finally still, finally done with trying to reassure Steve. "You know what that date is?"
"It's five in the morning, Tony," Pepper snaps. "If waking me up half an hour before my alarm goes off is your petty revenge for needing you to be at this meeting later on, I am really not impressed."
“Riiiiiight,” Bucky drawls, long and exaggerated. “Steve, I’ve only been human for a few months, and even I know Stark has no problem broadcasting his relationships to anyone who wants to know about it. Maybe you didn’t outright ask him to, but if he kept quiet about this, he was doing it for you.”
glance, and Steve really doesn't want to wake up one morning to a message from Natasha directing him to an eBay listing for CAPTAIN AMERICA'S MISERY DOODLES!!!!!!
s – but Tony doesn't actually know if he prefers neutrality when it means he's imagining how the sentence ends rather than knowing it.
“I think it’s had enough, Cap,” he says, once he’s sure Steve has at least noticed he’s here, even if he hasn’t said anything yet.
He shouldn't. He should turn around, go back to his room, order some food and then go to bed. His own bed. Alone.
"Am I supposed to care about that?" he asks, when he's sure he'll be able to sound appropriately irritated by the suggestion.
Still, he allows Bruce to herd him over to the beat-up couch Tony has spent the last decade refusing to replace, sitting when Bruce gives him a very pointed look, then claims his unsugared coffee and, less enthusiastically, the cake.
"Establishing connections now, Agent Hill," JARVIS answers, as the first reports of people drawing guns start to roll in, shortly followed by the news that bullets don't seem to be doing any good.
It takes a couple of seconds for Steve’s gaze to return to Tony’s face, then another couple for him to actually make eye contact again, but even so, he persists with arguing. “That’s not what I was asking. I meant… emotionally, I guess.”
"The SHIELD info dump?" he prompts, and then, because firmly telling himself not to be insecure didn't actually work, adds, "I saw Steve a couple of days ago. Poor guy's having a tough week."
Tony decides now is definitely time to clear out, and for once, his workshop isn’t going to cut it. As soon as Barnes is done yelling at him, Steve’s going to come looking for Tony to pass the yelling  on, and the fact that it’s Thor’s fault that Barnes knows won’t make a lick of difference.
“It’s easier if you get it over with quickly,” Tony advises, when Steve continues to just stand there.
Bruce smiles, not happily, more like he's just trying to be supportive, and then shakes his head. "I'm finding it hard to believe he'd do something like that," he says softly.
“Oh dear,” Tony says, because Pepper might have bullied him into not running away from his problems-slash-imminent-dumping but she can’t bullying him into dropping the pretence that he’s fine with it. Not from the other side of the country, at least, and since she’s in California until Friday Tony gets another few days of pretending he’s absolutely okay. “What’re you making him promise, J?”
All of which brings him back to the second reason he loves having a billionaire paying the bills: before today, Sam didn't realise hotels could be this nice.
"Well," Bruce murmurs later, once the doors to the elevator have closed. "I think that went well, don't you, JARVIS?"
He’s equally unsure how to defuse Steve’s sudden tension, and the three of them engage in what is almost certainly the longest awkward silence Sam has ever encountered, until eventually Barnes shifts a little, straightening his shoulders and seeming to grow a good couple of inches in the process.
pity-party with a serving bowl sized cup of tea and a box of slightly stale doughnuts down in his lab, except JARVIS sent for him rather than just shutting down whatever Tony was working on until he's eaten and slept. Clearly, he thinks Tony needs to talk to someone more than he needs to get out of the shop, and, unfortunately for Tony, Bruce is the best person JARVIS was able to get hold of.
This cell is by far the largest that the asset can remember being kept in. One wall is floor-to-ceiling windows, and although they don’t open, there are no bars, nothing to prevent the asset from smashing through the glass and escaping. The other walls are painted pale cream, with monochrome photos of the city at semi-regular intervals. It’s furnished with a bed, soft and far bigger than necessary, particularly since the asset sleeps on the floor under the oversized writing desk in the corner furthest from the door (the writing desk makes less sense than the bed, since the asset can neither read nor write, though he thinks maybe he could before).
"You think I won't help you?" Tony asks, reeling back like Steve shoved him physically rather than verbally, only to bounce right back again. "Yeah, okay, the thing with us might make it a little bit awkward, but I'm going to help you. Drop the benefits, we're still friends. You want to track him down, you want to bring him here, unbrainwash him, then you got it. You just have to-"
“I missed you,” he murmurs, the words muffled where his face is pressed to Tony’s hair. “God, Tony, I know it’s… Well, even so, I missed you.”
"Time machine?" he suggests, only half in jest; if anyone can sort out time travel, it's him and Bruce. "Otherwise, no."
It's not up to him, though. The world is ticking on just fine, mass destruction has been averted, and Tony believes Pepper will absolutely follow through on any and all threats she's made regarding his anatomy if he's not back at the Tower in time for her meeting.
It’s familiar, wonderfully so, and Tony gives it his all, throwing himself at Steve with an eagerness that borders on desperation. Steve’s hands seem to be everywhere at once, threading through Tony’s hair, pushing his tee-shirt halfway up his chest, curving under Tony’s ass, and Tony reads that last one like the cue it’s always been, trusting Steve to hold him up when he pushes himself off the ground and wraps his legs around Steve’s waist.
Sometimes, when Tony's been watching the footage of his parents' deaths on a loop for hours – maybe even days – at a time, he forgets that Steve is his friend, his teammate, his former semi-regular casual hookup.
thing first. “You really don’t,” he says. “I knew this was coming, sooner or later. To be honest, I thought it’d be quite a lot sooner, actually.”
he doing it? "Can we talk about this, Tony?" he requests, not feeling remotely optimistic about the answer. "Tony!"
He stands up, pushing his chair back too quickly and grimacing at the noise it makes, then pauses briefly to plate up the last two waffles. He drowns them in syrup, the way Tony usually has them, and bats Clint’s hand away from the leftover blueberries, tipping them over the top in a poorly presented but earnestly intended apology gift.
He stops, pinching the bridge of his nose and taking a series of deep breaths before turning back to whatever the hell it is he's working on.
If he was having this argument with anyone else, this is the point where Tony would storm out of the room, have JARVIS take him down to the shop, and then proceed to drink himself close to unconsciousness whilst building something unnecessarily loud and explosive. As it is, he's already in the shop, well over the legal limit, and getting away from JARVIS is damn near impossible unless he leaves the building and takes no tech with him.
“Because I was tied up in a basement, yeah,” Clint agrees. “You lot left me for dead, and the only reason I’m sitting here is because this really angry homeless dude got me out of there.”
stupid, utterly stupid, but finding out that Steve has fucked off after the Soldier rather than trying to talk to Tony again hurts, it really hurts, and the thought that Steve at least left him a letter makes it the tiniest bit less painful.
"You're welcome," he says, just as blandly. "Remember there's food upstairs, okay? I'll make sure Clint leaves a plate for you."
"Wrong," he says. "Two weeks when I was ten. Mom and Jarvis thought it would teach me the kind of skills I couldn't teach myself, Dad was thrilled to have an excuse to get me out of the house whenever the school sent me home, and I let them all keep believing that was where I was every Wednesday evening for the next year and a half."
Steve has only just stepped through the door when JARVIS decides to bring his post-workout buzz to a very abrupt end.
"Hey," Tony says, heading over to where Wilson is leaning against a wall, looking about four different kinds of exhausted. He makes a fairly lacklustre effort to straighten up as Tony approaches before appearing to think better of it, and Tony would be joining him if he thought the wall in question could take the weight of the suit. "Good fight. How were the wings? Better than the crap you had before, right?"
He stops at his usual florists, only a few blocks from Peggy's nursing home, and buys his usual exotic, over the top bouquet for Peggy to fob off on the reception desk, and then a bunch of daffodils that he hopes she'll actually like and want to keep in her room.
Because he's a wonderful, lovely, benevolent person, Tony doesn't go with his instinctive desire to respond sarcastically (and the fact that
Sir flinches, though JARVIS puts it at equal odds between it being at the name or at the suggestion, then shakes his head. "Don't," he answers. "I got this. Power up the Mark 58, J."
that wants to follow, on account of how he likes Bruce and Rhodey says he needs to start being better to the people he likes. "Or, well, I said
Tony makes an effort to swing by the kitchen at least one meal a day, but either Steve and Barnes show up or neither of them do; even on the days Steve and Sam go running first thing in the morning, Barnes still waits for Steve to get back before he goes to breakfast.
“God, no,” Natalia answers, laughing. She rises, stretching, and offers Barnes a hand. “I’m going to downstairs, where the food might actually be edible, and Yasha’s coming with me, aren’t you?”
Despite his efforts to pretend for Steve, the asset is not good at conversation. Because of this, he waits for Clint Clint Barton to continue the conversation, which is made difficult by the fact that Clint Clint Barton ‒
Steve looks instantly on edge, like he thinks he’s going to have to jump between them, but neither Sam nor Natalia seems remotely concerned, so Barnes does his best to pretend nothing is different. He mumbles a response when Sam says good morning, answers Steve’s tense smile with an equally tense nod, and doesn’t manage to do much more than glance at Natalia out the corner of his eye.
Sam blinks at her, surprised, then glances at Barnes for his reaction. Unfortunately for him, Barnes is working very hard at not having one, so Sam is just going to have to decide for himself whether he wants to object to her words.
"Fuck if I know, J," Tony answers, kicking off from the roof. "Guess I'll figure it out when I get there."
Tony isn’t expecting to see anything of Steve for at least a week, given how quickly he vacated the team floor when he found out Barnes wasn't there.
He can't ask Steve about him. Even if they were on proper speaking terms rather than the stilted awkwardness (and that's putting it mildly) that they have now, Steve is the furthest thing from an unbiased source when it comes to Barnes.
Tony grinned as he imagined all the things he could do to mess with Coulson. Coulson took the smile as acceptance and nodded them inside.
Tony smirked, running his thumb over Steve’s knuckles, and whispered, “I love you too, beloved. Do you want to find me some blueberry jello to spoon feed me later?”
With a combined yell from both Wade and Peter, they both gave their all in one final jerk. They fell back together, wrapped in each other’s arms.
Frantic to establish a connection, Steve reached out to him. Tony took his hand and Steve immediately relaxed. He asked, “Will I see you in the morning?”
“How does one explain color to the blind?” Logan retorted, his eyes slid back to the trashcan and he stared at it with a hard gaze. “Look...My sense of smell is so strong that I can even smell the chemicals in your bodies and know how you’re feeling. For example, both of you have high levels of dopamine and serotonin right now, both indicators of love.”
Friday was silent whereas Jarvis would have been berating him on his actions. He missed J. Vision may have retained his voice, intelligence, and memory components but…they were not the same. Friday was a good AI but she wasn’t his Jarvis who was programed with the same sass the real Jarvis had, had…After years of noise from the team and his family, the current silence was surreal…
my boyfriend. And for some reason that insane boyfriend is complaining about my wisecracks when he should be worrying about himself! I am a little stressed out right now!”
He woke up to the sound of Pepper’s voice demanding, “Get up, Peter! No more sleeping in! It’s time for business! You’ve avoided me long enough!”
“Master Stark will return soon and wishes to relay his joy to your return but says he wants to greet you personally,” Jarvis stated. “In the meantime, perhaps we can provide first aide. There is a kit in the kitchen.”
Steve’s image was back. Tony’s half of the photo was still blank but Steve was there so they were on the right track.
He couldn’t move and he couldn’t look away from his wife, even as Bucky’s fingers wrapped around her neck.
He unfortunately had to remind himself of that fact as he cooed to his wailing son who had been crying for the last hour.
Normans eyes snapped up and his glared at his pathetic excuse for a progeny. Harry, an average boy with none of his intellect. Peter was smart and, with time, his intelligence could have measured up to Norman’s. In that regard, he had been more of a son to Norman than his own flesh and blood. Harry would amount to nothing and Norman was reminded of this every time he looked at him and his naïve eyes.
Steve squeezed his arm one more time then slipped from his side and went over to Peter. They played a bit before Steve began to tell Peter about his mission.
“Sir, I have found multitudes of video with a woman fitting the description of Mary Parker. Shall I play back one with the clearest feed?”
He leapt over the fence and an alarm started to blare. He ignored it and ran to the small plume of smoke rising out of the roof. Steve grabbed whatever he could to propel himself up and memories of his last moments with Tony spurned him to move faster.
Dad ran his hand through Peter’s hair and murmured, “I have bad dreams sometimes too. They’re scary…It’s okay to cry, Peter.”
“No one is tracking my bike,” Steve retorted. “Tony removed all of SHIELD’s bugs and promised not to—…” He trailed to a stop as he thought of his late boyfriend. His heart squeezed painfully and he looked down as he whispered, “Bucky, forget the bike…Listen, I contacted you because-because I…I was thinking about my mother’s funeral. And you…You stayed with me the entire night, remember?” He paused in his retelling, wondering how much he would have to explain to him.
With a small grin, the Soldier picked up the gun that had fallen to the floor and sat on their remaining chair. He happily did as she commanded, it was a sentiment he’d never once remembered feeling.
But so far, so good. He clocks in on a Thursday and it's been three days since Steve last texted—he never calls, but it's fine. There's paperwork to catch up with and several client requests for the day. He can busy himself with meetings and the shrill ringing of his office phone, which seems livelier than normal, a stark contrast to his own personal cell.
Tony has let Steve do many things to him and he has loved them all, but will always treasure one particular night the most. The night in which Steve finally let Tony take control, for the first and last time.
Dressed down and domestic, Tony doesn't feel as appealing as his other self. For now, Steve seems alright with it.
Johnny is looking at him with a hint of something that doesn’t sit quite right. Maybe it’s a challenge. Tony wouldn’t know - he doesn’t even pretend to be a match. He’d be way over his head, and frankly, he just feels tired. It’s so tiring. All the pretending, on top of forcing himself to stop thinking about Steve, his ignored messages, his ignored existence.
They've been together for a couple of months now, sleeping in each other's arms, fucking like it's always the last time. So he nods and listens.
One day, Steve brings up Johnny; it's unexpected, too. Tony thinks he knows who he's talking about, but his memory strains. It's hard to think about other people lately. His mind is full. Eventually, he remembers, or rather, Steve forces him to. Johnny is someone from that chatroom who Tony happened to see every now and then around his office building hallways. A young intern, perhaps. No doubt much fresher than Tony. Attractive, too, all sharp angles and stunning blue eyes, certainly magnetic. He didn't know Johnny had reached out to Steve that night as well.
“Jeez, don’t make it sound like a difficult mission, Cap,” Tony teased, leaning in closer over the counter. He continued, “Alright, good to know we’re both onboard. Now, everyone already knows we’re best friends since we hang all the time. But once it gets out we’re dating then they’re going to put two-and-two together and assume we’ve been together longer and think our friendship was a cover for something deeper. So whenever we went to gala events together with no dates was actually because we were going with each other, comprendo?”
references I make for the rest of the week because, holy shit, I think we just killed the mother of all aliens before it impregnated and killed the crew of the U.S.S. Avengers.”
“…Or maybe somewhere else? In plain clothes?” Peter asked, remembering how badly he wanted to be with Wade without his mask.
Tony was still smiling like an idiot but Steve’s eyes were dancing and his smile was radiant. Tony did not care how stupidly happy he looked like because he was there in his kitchen sharing breakfast with the love of his life and they were probably going to be doing this the rest of their lives.
Peter pressed back into Wade, making the older man inhale sharply, similarly to what Peter had just done. He pressed back onto Wade’s sex and knew the merc had to be biting back a groan.
him go down!” The Captain hissed his disbelief and buried his face in his hands. He painfully asked, “I screamed his name and he did not move.”
Venom had been trying to escape in vain and everyone had been ignoring it. Yet, with Peter’s words it froze and slowly sunk back to his chest. Wade watched it sink with a grin. It looked like the alien finally realized it was beat.
Bucky inhaled sharply but did not say anything more. After a moment’s hesitation, he hugged Steve tighter and Steve let himself relax into Bucky’s mold. With his right hand, Bucky gently pet the back of his head.
Bucky shook his head and whispered, “We’ll talk about that another day. Tony is gonna be here soon and I don’t want you to feel bad for me when you see him…He’s been missing you, Stevie. He’s tried to hide it from me and be strong but he’s a broken man without you and when he sees you…the last thing the two of you will want to talk about would be my past. It happened. We can’t change it. It’s over. We’re here now and we’re alive.” Bucky squeezed his arms, smiling widely at him as he said it. “You’re alive and you took your sweet ass time waking up.”
The boot up felt like the longest of his life. He stepped back into the suit and watched the BIOS systems run through all the vital needs of the CPU. He felt like he was watching a countdown do his execution.
Peggy pulled on his arm and he stumbled back and out of the tent. He gasped, “Wait, Peggy! I wanted a word with the Colonel after Howard.”
Tony quirked an eyebrow. With his back to the rest of the people in the room, he made no move to cover his lips as he stated, “There’s no way he would accept help from you, you are practically his ex…me on the other hand…” Tony grinned and Steve could see the gears turning in his head. Tony whispered, “And I can go a step farther. He clearly still loves her and she clearly is still crazy about him—.”
“Which is why I never did that,” Peter countered. He hit enter and waited for the light to turn green.
The Winter Solider saw what he was doing and pushed Steve back to give himself enough room to swing up his arm and fire at Tony. Tony made no move to dodge because he expected the bullets to bounce off his armor like the last time the Soldier had fired at his suit.
Natasha did not reply but clenched her fists at her side. She spun on her heel, avoiding everyone’s gazes and strode straight out of the room.
Steve smiled, seeing right through his act, and teased, “You know, a wise man once told me, the future isn’t set in stone.”
When he was younger, he had dreamt of countless scenarios where Bucky came on to him like that and, for a moment, Steve gave into his younger self’s desires. He immersed himself back into the past and forgot all about the present and Tony… Steve rubbed his lips again and called himself all kinds of names ranging from idiot to bastard.
“We’ve been serious as a heart attack,” Wade stated, straightening his back to stand as tall as he could while sitting down.
Steve's hold knocked him out of his fix as he relaxed into his warm arms. Scotch had nothing on Steve. Steve was more than his friend,
In his mind’s eye, Steve saw Tony disappear into the void with the nuclear missile and he drew his gaze away from the broken window and back to his fiancé. If Tony hadn’t been there, New York would have been destroyed.
A large explosion bloomed from the side of the Avenger’s Tower and Peter gripped his uncle’s side tighter.
Another news van pulled into the parking lot and stopped right in front of them, blocking their path. Tony growled and Steve frowned at the people who jumped out. The obstruction gave the others enough time to catch up to them and they were quickly surrounded.
Once satisfied with the small fire, Steve stood and unbuckled his pants. He froze with both ends of his belt in hand when Sneaky seemingly materialized out of thin air. The robot had said it had advanced stealth technology but Steve hadn’t truly appreciated how advanced it was until that moment.
“Colonel Rhodes,” the President called out to him. “Glad to see you make it, son. I feel safer already.”
Tony draped his arm across the small of Steve’s back and lightly placed his hand on his hip. Steve’s jumpy reactions were getting better and the arm holding the spatula merely twitched a tiny fraction. Steve let himself lean into Tony and the perfect fantasy world around him was complete.
The lights dimmed and a slow beat started. He held out his hand to Steve and murmured, “C’mere, Steve.”
Steve popped open the pretzels and handed them to Peter. Peter eagerly grabbed it and began to eat enthusiastically.
Peter looked around them. His Aunt May was thankfully nowhere in sight and most of the street had cleared as soon as Venom made its appearance. Some foolhardy people stayed behind to film on their phones, using a car or post as a barrier between them.
Wade pressed Peter into the tiled wall and kissed him with renewed fervor, physically showing Peter how much he loved him.
“Moving on,” Tony said then groaned as he pushed himself slowly inside. Steve tensed as pain and pleasure hit him all at once. Tony dug his fingers into his thighs and grunted, “Relax, relax Steve.”
“The time glove was on my hand when the Goblin ripped it off so it just must be laying in the tall grass anywhere in between,” Wade rationalized. “Beast can probably sniff it out!”
Steve shook his head and, still looking at him like he was insane, the man said, “By car it takes like two hours…dude, you’re going to be walking a while.”
With tears starting to run down his face, Stave gasped, “I’m sorry too. If I could…” He inhaled sharply and said, “Tony, that night on the couch, I wanted to kiss you back.
