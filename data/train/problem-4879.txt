is a replacement for love, boy?” Castiel pulls Dean back far enough that he can look up and meet Cas’ gaze, so just the head of Cas’ cock lies hot and throbbing on his tongue. He doesn’t know the answer, he doesn’t
Day falls naturally to dusk here, wherever here actually is, light creeping from clear gold to amber to a deep seeping red that feels too much like a warning, like Castiel painted the sky with unbridled wrath so Dean would remember he’s in trouble (not like he can forget that at the moment). It’d be an understatement to say that Dean is unsettled by the day so far.
Sam shudders when he pulls out, pressing his face against the stone. Hiding. Dean can hear small noises, words choked off by fear, but he doesn’t want to know what Sam’s begging him for now. The only comfort Dean can offer is to get this over and done. More spit in his hand and Dean wraps his hand around his still-aching dick. He has to take a moment to breathe, overwhelmed by sensation and as he slicks himself up, the dying embers of anger. He’s going to get off on this. Castiel hasn’t left him any wiggle room there.
“You dick, you’re
“Good.” Castiel moves his hand, rubbing in small circles over the head of Dean’s cock, and somewhere in the middle Dean’s clothes are gone. Fingers wrap around the length of his shaft and stroke from root to tip, spreading leaking precome as they move. “This is your only chance, Dean. Be obedient. If you refuse me…”
They can’t die here.
“You’re going to take this,” Castiel’s fingers squeeze in a ring around Dean’s erection, “And you’re going to go find Sam.” Horror starts eating away at the haze and Dean jerks back. Castiel doesn’t let go, hand squeezing tight enough to make Dean sob. “You offered a substitute for love to
Dean dies by inches.
for you, Dean, and you shut me out at every turn.”
He expects the night to be worse, but the hours of darkness pass in fitful naps and eerie silence. There’s not even any crickets. Or frogs. None of the normal night time choir, no city sounds far in the distance, not a damn thing. They might be the only two living things in fifty miles, and Dean may be a little concerned about a possible lack of food in their future.
Standing is a challenge; his limbs are floppy and his head is still spinning, but he manages it. And then Cas is right there in his space, nuzzling along Dean’s neck with a sign, one hand curling along his hip as the other traces along his stomach. It’s too easy to lean into him, rest his head on Castiel’s shoulder and bring his hands up to steady himself. Castiel slides his hand down to stroke Dean through his jeans. He gasps silently and his knees almost buckle — he’s achingly hard and Castiel is moving feather light, teasing.
Castiel is still standing there when the light fades, holding Sam against the wall and thrusting against him. It’s like he didn’t even
“Not now, Dean,” Castiel says absently. Sam looks at Dean in horror and twists away, only for Castiel to slam him back against the wall by the throat, closing the non-extant gap between them to pin him in place. He moves lazily once Sam stills, riding against Sam’s thigh. Dean is going to kill him. “Relax, Sam. I know you can be good for me.”
“Cas?” It’s a broken whisper, and Dean can’t tell if Sam’s talking to the real Castiel or the one in his head. The one that’s going to come and save him from everything that’s happening.
“Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up, dickhead. I’m actually a decent boyfriend when I get the chance.” he said, rolling his eyes.
Everyone looked completely stunned.
************************
“Craving affection? How dare you. That's disgusting.” said Cas, deadpan. He pulled Dean even closer and chuckled as Dean sighed in relief.
“But is it romantic if we agree on it first? Kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? Hamm, I really do need to think about this one.” Dean pondered aloud.
“You really think so?” Cas asked, sounding surprised.
“Papa had to go check on something, he'll be back in a little while.” he said, reassuringly.
Cas began laying cutlery on the table. “I think I know which one you're talking about. Was it the barbecue challenge from last Thursday? Jack was intrigued by that as well. Although he was more excited by the dragon fruit sorbet.” he said casually.
Dean looked thoughtful as he pulled the wheel to steer them onto the forecourt of the garage.
“Good to know, but I'm fine for now Jo, maybe a little later when this adrenaline has worn off. I'll probably crash hard then.” said Dean, grinning “Get comfy everyone, let's get the fuck away from here before those losers figure out we're still on their doorstep.”
Hi *waves*
“What the fuck.” Dean breathed out heavily.
“I'll have to give Cas some more medicine soon, Bobby doesn't want to stop again.” she said in explanation, waving to her mate driving the other truck.
Cas. True form as big as the Chrysler building. A being made of holy fire and righteousness.
“I could hear everything... the screams. The bastards were torturing them. They wanted to know where you were, Castiel. They knew we were coming and that you were our leader.” Alfie sobbed out.
He didn't have to go far, Bobby and Sam were outside the radio room, both looked pensive and they had obviously been waiting for Dean.
Gordon grinned. “My apologies. I was just curious about the gorgeous Omega working away all by himself. I thought you might be lonely.” he stepped even closer.
“Cool, so where we headed?” said Dean. “Uh, about a mile ahead is a giant rock shaped like a boat, It's there.” said Cas, his expression relieved.
Dean shook his head. There was another fact about Cas he’d never known about before. Did he really know Cas as well as he thought he did? To be fair, Cas wasn’t exactly forthcoming about himself. Maybe he felt that the brothers wouldn’t be interested. It was something Dean was going to rectify, and soon.
“Do you think they'll make it in time?”
“Yeah, I wanna get started on digitising the library. It’ll make it easier to create an app.” Sam said dreamily.
Cas walked over to the door, unlocking it and opening it to find Mary on the other side, her eyebrow raised and a smirk on her lips.
him, man.” he said, with an edge to his voice that made Cas start growling again.
Cas had never been a morning person. This morning was no exception. He'd awoken to the sound of whining and the scent of Omega distress, something he'd always been particularly sensitive to. He tried to sit up to find the source only to grunt in agony at the pain lancing up his side. Jess was at his side immediately, holding a cup with a measure of poppy syrup to his lips and pushing him gently back down onto the bed. He protested and fought, even growling lowly, but Benny had appeared at the other side of his bed and added his strength to holding him down, preventing him from hurting himself or anyone else.
The doorway to the kitchen was wide open and they made their way swiftly across the room, peering out into the corridor. All was silent. Dean pointed out the door to the Omegas dorm and Cas nodded. They crept along the corridor, hardly daring to breathe.
Cas narrowed his eyes suspiciously and Dean avoided his gaze. The room fell into awkward silence.
“Well, I don't think he's a danger to us personally. If that's what you mean.” said Ellen, her face screwed up in thought.
Bobby was already on his feet as Garth burst through the doorway to the kitchen.
Look, a new chapter! It's a short one, but I will be posting another on Friday. You lucky, lucky people.
Last chapter of fluff, next chapter things start getting serious, with some new characters and surprises in store.
“What the hell is going on?” Bobby snarled.
Balthazar sighed. “Yes. Gabe told me to keep it a secret, he didn't want Michael to find him. I was only to tell you if you decided to leave the clan, so you'd have somewhere to go. I kept an eye on you where Gabe couldn't. I gave him semi-regular updates on yours and Hannah's welfare. He was devastated when he had to leave you both behind.”
“Cas? It's me. Bobby's cool with that. It's fine.” said Dean, looking up to see Bobby ushering everyone out and closing the door.
For the next half hour Sam and Dean took Jack and Cas through the basics. Both celestials swam like rocks at first, but soon got the hang of it, growing more confident and proficient. Cas actually seemed to be enjoying it, cutting through the water like he was born to it. Dean challenged Cas to a race to up the ante.
An angry look passed over Castiels face, he clenched his fists and Dean stepped back, gripping the knife that Cas had given him, the scent of Castiels anger mingling with the scent of Deans fear.
Sam blushed and laughed. “Sorry, Cas. It's just weird seeing you out of the coat. I forget that it's not actually part of you.” he said, reaching for the bowls on the top shelf above the counter.
Dean felt a rush of affection for the Alpha. He was willing to do whatever it took for things to work for the both of them. He figured he should probably do the same.
“What? Don't give me the credit, old man. This was your idea.” said Dean, pointing at Bobby.
As always, comments and kudos are what keep this story going. Seriously, without encouragement I would have given up ages ago. This month marks a year since I started this story, thank you to all that have given your time to reading it. <3
“I love you too. Good luck with your family. Talk tomorrow.” Dean sagged in the chair as Cas ended the call.
Sam only just stopped himself laughing out loud. “I can bookmark some stuff, if you like?” he offered.
“Oh, yeah. Thanks, Sammy. That does sound good.” replied Dean, turning to start emptying the wash tub. Sam busied himself making lunch as Dean emptied the bath tub, putting it away just in time for Sam to serve lunch, he'd even poured them both a beer.
Cas disappeared behind the curtain and Dean looked around as he waited, catching Jakes eye and giving the older man an awkward wave.
Cas suppressed a laugh at Deans antics and pressed on. “It's the only way, if you punch him, Jess kicks your ass, then Sam feels guilty for that and the cycle continues. Just tell him what you told me. Once he understands, I can almost guarantee he'll back off.” he said with a smile.
“Oh, sorry. I guess not having any home cooked meals for a while made me forget my manners.” said Benny sheepishly.
“Oh, man. Jess is gonna kill you. You weren't supposed to get your wound too wet. I'd better go get her so she can take a look.” said Sam, shaking his head as if severely disappointed in the Alpha and went off to find Jess.
“I'm sure you will eventually, so I have refrained from pushing too hard. But.. this is not about that.”
“Then, may I kiss you again?” he said, quietly.
Dean sighed. “His douche bag clan must have given him crap or something. I'd better go, catch you later Sam.” he clapped his brother on the shoulder and ran to the house.
Mary smiled. “Nice feeling, isn’t it?” she was speaking from experience.
Dean nodded and rolled his eyes as Charlie turned to once again lean into the cab to reach the radio.
Yeah, it's really badly written, but the diagrams in the back are pretty interesting. I'd like a chance to try out some of those traps. Although I'm pretty sure the trap they have for shifters doesn't work.” he said with a shake of his head and a small smirk.
“I'm not here to hurt you, I want to help.”
“Well, we can't have that, your majesty. So a bath it is.” said Dean, pulling the blanket up around his ears.
“Are we buying it for our trip?” Cas asked, looking completely overwhelmed at the gear surrounding him. Almost everything had buckles and straps and came in various types of camo.
Dean stepped towards his husband and straightened his hat and wig. “I know you do, you big softy. He just got overwhelmed, this is the first Christmas he really understands and he can participate in properly. I promise, we haven't scarred him for life.” he reassured.
(He's shy) Dean mouthed at the older lady and winked. She giggled and patted Deans hand sweetly. She smelled of violets and trouble.
Finally cried out, Dean sat up, pulling away from Castiel and looking embarrassed. “Uh..sorry, man. I dunno what happened there. I'm not usually...y'know...uh...” fumbled Dean, wiping his eyes.
“Yes.” Cas said, looking away, out over the lake where a light breeze was whipping up the surface.
“Hello, your majesty” said Dean, flopping heavily into the chair and frowning at the stew now dripping down the front of his shirt. Wiping it off with a piece of flatbread, he shrugged and ate it much to Charlie's visible disgust.
Jess was extremely concerned about her patient. He had begun to refuse medication and was pushing himself too far, too fast. When she found him dressed in his own clothes and lacing up his boots in order to go outside, she had given him such a stern lecture that the rest of the household had all decided they had somewhere else to be, and Bobby and Sam suddenly had more volunteers to finish Garth's cabin than they needed.
Dean sighed. “Cas, please. I know it was something to do with what Kitty said. Are you-”
Mary smiled. “That sounds good, a night in with all of my boys.” she said, looking relieved.
The bathroom door opened letting out a cloud of steam and a freshly washed Winchester dressed in a bathrobe and towel turban.
She gave him an incredulous look. “Sure you are, poppet. I'm sure Cas would love to see you wearing your dinner and smelling like eau du rabbit stew.” she said snarkily. “Could you try not to spray food everywhere? I thought Bobby told you not to eat in here any more?”
Cas looked excited. “I have so many ideas I want to try. How do you feel about beehives? It wasn't something that would work in the mountains, it's too cold up there for bees. But here? It would be perfect. I can probably name fifty different ways having them would benefit the settlement. Also, I have an idea for an irrigation system that would double the output of your chosen crops, we'd only need half the space to grow the same amount. Oh, and just think what I could do with greenhouses here.” he said, almost squirming in his seat.
“Is that wise?” said Sam, looking concerned.
Jack nodded, and squirmed feeling shy suddenly. His lip trembled as he held back tears.
“Relax, man. It's fine. I need that radio to call Bobby. I need to find out if my brother is ok.” said Dean, who was trying to seem as he wasn't spooked by the truck almost going off road and into a ditch, but not doing a very good job of it.
“Of course it's true. You credit me with saving you, but you were right there with me, saving yourself. You didn't passively stand by, you fought as hard as I did. Even after everything you had been through, you didn't give up. You care, about everyone. You didn't even hesitate to help the others find a home. You, are nothing less than wonderful.” he said earnestly.
“Ugh, like hammered crap. You know how it is, tired, sweaty, and itchy. I dunno why some Alphas still think Omegas are like sex crazed ninja zombies when we're in heat. I just want to nap in a cold bath for the entire week. The last thing I feel like doing is chasing and pinning some 'poor defenceless Alpha'. I mean, yeah, it'd be nice to have someone, but they'd have to do all the work. I feel too lazy to do much of anything when I'm in heat.” said Sam tiredly, slumping into his chair and reaching for his tea.
“I love you too.”
“Michael is utterly without mercy. It just doesn't even enter his mind to consider it. He is absolute. When he broke the deal he made with Dean, he didn't do it out of malice. He did it because he didn't consider Dean to be anything other than a tool for him to use.” Cas said bitterly. “The cruellest torture is indifference.”
Instincts making a decision for him, Cas threw back the blankets and grimaced in agony as he crawled out of the bed and onto the floor, the loose cotton pants he wore twisting around his legs and partially hindering his movement. Panting heavily, he crawled across the floor towards the chair holding Dean.
Cas. What you said. Before the Empty took you.
I’m sorry.
Dean finally sighs and passes his hand over his face, unable to withstand the puppy eyes for that long.
I meant it.
She shrugs. “Hey, what can I say? I’m a fangirl at heart. And I love hot elven chicks.”
(softly, as if this moment is one he could break)
Thank God.
I’m dreading this question but I have to ask. “Did you…see the colors?”
(speaking with certainty)
The spell breaks; Dean opens his eyes, flinching when he sees Castiel just standing there in the doorway.
“I’m sorry, I am. Um, I-I really have to go.” I attempt to get up from the table but accidentally knock over my coffee. It spills across the table, staining its perfect wooden gloss. I only stand there, watching it spread.
Dean glances around. They’ve outpaced everyone—it’ll be a while before anyone catches up. “Yeah,” Dean mutters unhappily. “Thanks.”
“She died.”
BOBBY
Dean. (He waits for an answer, but none comes.) Dean, please.
EILEEN
“Mocha. Thanks.”
But I do. Against all odds, I do.
“Now, this is a bit, um, well, you might wanna scroll through some of this,” explains Charlie, wincing at Sam’s look of utter disgust, “But the overall story, it’s… ugh, it made me cry. I still can’t listen to Elvis.”
Cross-country practice is the part of the day that Castiel simultaneously loves and dreads the most. Through running, he can escape from his loneliness and boredom… but he has to face the fact that no one really talks to him. The only person who seems to have any interest in him at all is Dean—and Dean makes fun of his clothes, his way of speaking, his uncle’s car (all deemed “pretentious” and “stuck-up”).
“My name--My name’s Dean.”
After a few minutes of general chaos, Bobby finally brings the team to order with a hoarse “shut up!” The boys quiet, settling into a sort of messy semi-circle. Castiel desperately hopes for a talking-free practice.
His head cocks to one side and eyebrows scrunch, noticing my faux pas. He eventually says, “Gold.”
“I figured it was time.”
On a whim, I hesitantly ask him, “Do you… want to come for dinner tonight?” God, this is a mistake.
“Are you okay?” The tea man turns around. Messy dark hair and deep eyes. Tall, but not as tall as me. Bow-shaped lips. Not Lisa.
(slightly embarrassed, yet as unguarded as we’ve ever seen him)
Had a life to live.
Dean nods, and turns to gaze out over the bridge. Cas slips a hand into his, and they stand together, looking at the sunset, breaking gold and crimson rays over the water, finally calm, finally peaceful.
As time passes, as I fall more and more in love with him, these subdued shades become beautiful.
“Thanks,” Castiel mutters, and carefully takes a pack of spearmint gum from the stack.
CASTIEL
Dean’s smile falters. He glances at Sam— they both feel guilty for leaving Cas behind. Castiel catches this look, and is about to speak, but winces. A curl of blue Grace floats from his mouth, winding into the air and vanishing like smoke.
“Love you.”
BLACKOUT.
, thinks Sam. But there’s no way out. Charlie’s got that look on her face, and Sam knows the only way to get her to shut up is to read this fanfiction.
“Do you like Elvis?”
(with a slight smile, hardly believing it himself)
Charlie laughs evilly. “You’ll definitely need Jesus after you read some of this stuff.”
“Hey, guys.”
“What’s your name?”
(breathing slower, but doing his best to look his brother in the eyes)
Castiel begins to enjoy his walks home from practice. The late afternoons begin to mellow, turning from uncomfortably hot to a pleasant, breezy warmth. Over the next week, he learns his way around town, exploring the two main streets and hidden alleyways, ice cream shops and clothing stands. He buys more gum from the general store, and Dean counts his change with a blank face, giving him a small nod each time he walks in.
Bobby grunts, motions for Dean to sit down next to him. He hands him a beer from the cooler.
, Dean.” Lisa laughed, pink flushing her cheeks.
(softer)
“You ordered peppermint tea.”
“CARRY ON MY WAYWARD SON” begins to PlAY.
looking at Dean.
I didn’t immediately register it. I took her in, and there was something different about her I couldn’t quite place until she choked, eyes wide. Hazel eyes. Brown hair. Red lips. Colors.
“Hey, Casteel or whatever your name is,” Dean says, seeming to feed on the other kids’ stifled laughs and admiring looks, “Tell your daddy to take you back to whatever rich suburban hell-hole you crawled out of.”
“Fuck,” Dean gasps suddenly, and crumples. Castiel skids to a halt, panting hard, hands on his knees.
I think— I think I’m falling again.
EILEEN
(sighing)
She pulls out a silver knife, slashes it on her arm. She lets Sam pour some holy water on her hand. She goes through every test, staring at Sam’s face, willing him to believe her.
. Behind the counter is Dean Winchester, air-drumming to rock music playing over the speakers and mouthing along enthusiastically. His eyes are closed, so he doesn’t notice Castiel staring.
Dean flips the omelet off the pan and onto a plate, setting it in front of Sam, who barely looks up.
“Have you ever heard of fanfiction?”
of it weird and perverted?”
BLACKOUT. Heart monitor FLATLINES.
“Sorry, guys.”
The rest of our lives, man. Everything that comes after.
“Her name was Meg,” Cas blurts, then immediately looks as if he regrets saying anything.
Cross-country, though daunting at first, has become his haven from the silent house. Even though Castiel hasn’t made friends, he enjoys hearing the other kids talk and laugh. It makes the loneliness bearable.
“What’s wrong, Sam?” Cas walks over and puts a hand on his shoulder. “No major ailments, everything seems to be in place mentally, no curses or hexes or any sign of magical meddling… The only possible reason for your distress… did you watch a sad movie? Perhaps one of those ‘chick flicks’ Dean always talks about?”
Sam, it’s me. I promise.
INT. BUNKER - KITCHEN
She wasn’t breathing
He shouldn’t accept. He should just keep walking and never speak to Dean Winchester again. But for the first time in his life, Castiel feels brave.
But then—
these before?”
“Mine’s green.”
“Lisa?”
“Yeah, I suppose.” I get up again, thankfully not spilling anything this time.
CUT TO MONTAGE:
of it. “You—” She points at Cas, “And him,” she motions towards the open door, “are in love. Just admit it, get over it, and move on with your lives as a happy couple. I can’t fucking take it anymore.”
he reminds himself, and pulls a crumpled twenty from his pocket, laying the gum and the money on the counter.
“I thought you didn’t like chick flicks,” Charlie cuts in.
“Are you…Are you okay?” I ask him, confused.
“That’ll be $64.99. Thank you.”
he thinks disgustedly, kicking pebbles down the dusty sidewalk. He remembers Dean Winchester’s taunts, the accusations of
I frowned and squinted. The blue was lost from the sky and I couldn’t see color… at all. This hadn’t happened since I met Lisa 3 years ago. Either I had suddenly gone color-blind or something terrible had happened.
. The camera moves from them to the window. The curtains. The soft light outside.
Back home, there was no Dean Winchester.
The house lights were on and the door was unlocked. I left the groceries in the car and fumbled with the doorknob.
“Don’t let him weasel his way out,” warns Sam, slowly beginning to smile. “Please. I mean, this has been so long coming… It was driving me insane.”
and Sam’s glancing guiltily down at his hands.
I met her in May. It was nearly summer in Kansas, and the heat was beginning to creep up to unbearable. She was this… tall, thin fairy that was so clumsy she could barely move without knocking something over, including my coffee in the shop I stopped by to get my daily fix.
“Did you finish it?”
“Whoa, Sammy, what’s up?” He looks at Charlie accusingly, and she has to admit that it
, for fuck’s sake.”
She drags him over to her sleek black laptop, sitting open on the table in the bunker. He sits down, half-scared, half-curious.
“Sure,” Cas mumbles, and swings his bag around his shoulders. He avoids eye contact with his uncle, climbing into the passenger seat of the impeccable cream-colored BMW, a possession of which Zachariah is greatly fond.
The field is golden and beautiful, yet as ragged as Dean remembers it. BOBBY SINGER sits on his rocking chair, beer in hand. Dean walks up to the porch. He takes his time— he has all the time in the world, after all.
. Help me up, will you?”
EXT. BOBBY’S FARM - PORCH. LATE SUMMER.
He laughs, a hint of bitterness tainting his voice. “No. My girlfriend died about a year ago, and this is kind of bringing back memories.”
I don’t know. I think it’s something to do with The Empty— sapping his grace, somehow. Saving you probably took a lot of mojo.
“Novak! Hey, Novak!”
The answer is, pretty damn hard.
Cas nods determinedly, taking a calming breath. “Here I go.”
Charlie cannot believe how far this situation has escalated. Dean’s face goes bright red and he starts to shift around, clearly uncomfortable. Sam decides to put Dean out of his misery and take one for the team.
Well, she wasn’t expecting that.
“I did, yes. My favorite.” He looks at me, puzzled.
There is a pause. Dean swipes a hand over his face and shifts closer on the bed. There is so much left unsaid, between these two, and it hangs heavy in the air.
“Oh.”
, she’s shipped it for so long and so much, and these idiots have barely made any progress, and she’s
“Whatever, man,” Dean scoffs, kicking a pebble that skitters over the pavement and lands next to Castiel’s shoe. “Come on, Sam.” He grabs the skinny kid by the arm and they start walking towards the parking lot.
her fault.
pretty well-written!” Sam suddenly bursts out, looking completely overwhelmed.
know what fanfiction is!”
(eventually)
Thought you’d be able to magic yourself one of those from thin air, up here. Service not working lately?
“Are you alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“Of course, Uncle,” Castiel says, not confident in the slightest. “I’m sure I can find someone.”
“No!” Sam says defensively. “I-it was—”
thinks he is about to speak— but he remains silent. Cas merely looks back at him, at the face he thought he’d never see again. The awkwardness is mostly on Dean’s side, which is not a surprise. Castiel seems content to merely look.
Castiel straightens his trench coat and a serene smile appears on his face.
Sam’s son goes off to college, and Dean takes a breath, and claps a hand on his shoulder. Smiles proudly at him.
“Guess we’re in the same position, huh?” Cas says after a moment, meeting my eyes again.
“All because of fanfiction,” Charlie sighs, smiling at Sam triumphantly. “Now you have to admit, it’s totally awesome.”
I smile down at him, eyes soft with love. “And yours are blue.”
“Lisa.”
Even—
It’s more than Charlie ever dreamed of hearing, and she falls backwards, letting out a squeal of pure joy.
They don’t really know what Cas and Dean talked about, but judging from the sounds that leak out of Dean’s room an hour later, it must have gone well.
The words just come out and I can’t take them back. Cas stares at me, eyes wide and shocked. I’m surprised at his reaction, since most people look uncomfortable and offer condolences. But his eyes…they look like mine when I look in the mirror.
I sat there, astonished, while we stared at each other, eyes hungrily drinking in this new sensation, the explosion of color that overtook our senses.
I sit down, trying to avoid looking at his face.
Behind, there is a flutter of wings. The light bulbs blow out, glass shattering on the ground. Sam freezes, hoping against all odds—
“Okay,
“Damn! I’ll be late to my writing class.” He looks at me regretfully.
(voice ragged)
“Novak!” Dean yells after practice on the third day of camp. “Hey!”
Dean chooses that moment to come in, tying his bathrobe and warming his hands around a mug of coffee.
That was how my life ended.
He sways, and Sam rushes to hold him up. Dean looks at Cas, who is, as usual, unreadable.
Dean chokes, blood pooling from his mouth. His eyes are glassy and fighting to stay open. SAM’s eyes are filled with tears--he can’t believe it.
“Yeah, yeah, of course. Thanks.” I shake my head, trying to cover the bitterness and regret boiling inside me.
BOBBY
Castiel decides to buy a pack of gum at the general store, which is a charming little shop; the words “General Store” are plastered in sloping red letters above the little sign that says “cash only.” Anxiety thrums through his blood. He’s never bought something by himself before, sheltered as his childhood and teen years were. This, however, is a test. If he’s able to do this, to walk into a store and buy a pack of gum, maybe he’s able to be independent. Maybe he’s not such a coward after all.
Cas— are you okay?
“I’ll pick you up at five o’clock,” says Zachariah, and peels off in a dignified cloud of dust.
Silence again.
of them. It’s like the entire school is on the cross country team.
“Who the fuck is this asshole?” Castiel hears one of the boys say to his friend. The boy has dirty-blond hair and freckles, lots of them, dotting his face and his arms. His ears start roaring, and he doesn’t hear what the other boy says in response. When his ears roar, Castiel knows, his face turns bright red as an accompanied humiliation. He turns away, his chin dropping to the ground as he takes one deep breath, then another.
“What’s ‘Destiel?’” asks Cas obliviously. “And what’s fanfiction?”
Shut up.
The shopping cart clicked over the tiles as I made my way through the aisle. “Sure, no problem. See you in a few.”
When a person meets the one they want to be with for the rest of their life, the colors flood into being, filling the empty spaces. The reds, blues, yellows that failed to make an appearance suddenly pop to. Scientists theorize that a switch flips in the brain to make them appear, but even with research and MRI’s, nobody is completely sure why this is. And nobody knows how the brain can know the perfect match for it, why the system is in place. But when a match is made, no one questions it. Divorce is almost obsolete. Suicides relating to marital strife are almost nonexistent. There have been no flaws in the system… ever.
Cas. Jesus, you’re— you’re
“I’m seeing red, Lisa. I’m seeing colors, how is that happening?”
Sam sits at the table, flipping through a huge, ancient tome. A stack of books rests next to him, waiting to be studied. Cas is not at the table, a noted absence.
The stop sign was gray and I almost missed it, even though stoplights and signs are altered to be noticeable in black and white.
Jack. He came for me.
At least he wasn’t last. At least that.
(with deep relief)
“See you around, Novak,” Dean calls as Castiel is leaving. Surprised, Castiel pauses in the doorway, sneaking a glance over his shoulder. Dean is carefully not looking back at him.
He looks up from the laptop, tears streaming down his face.
“Do you want to…? I don’t know, go out or something?” I asked in a rush.
“Oh, God, Charlie,” he groans. “Not this. Anything but this. Show me Frodo and Sam fanfiction, Harry and Voldemort, even, but not this. I do
Castiel sleeps, his face serene. Morning light spills in through the window, the drapes gently fluttering. It’s a beautiful scene, almost like a painting. The song “THANK YOU” by Led Zeppelin begins to PLAY. PAN TO Dean in the doorway, awkwardly holding a plate of eggs and mug of black coffee. Dean’s face is softer than we’ve seen it in a long time. He hesitates, not wanting to disturb his friend.
“Oh, it’s you,” Dean says, cheeks flushing a deep, embarrassed red. “What do you want, Novak?” The unfriendliness is palpable in his tone, so different from the relaxed, even happy state of a moment earlier.
They’ll be here soon.
Sam frowns. “Isn’t that perverted stuff written by seriously messed-up twelve year olds?”
No, Dean, no—
“Why are you so jittery?”
“Castiel!” bellows his uncle from downstairs. “It’s two o’clock!”
Castiel Novak stares at the blank page in front of him, twisting his pencil fretfully between his long, skinny fingers. A slight breeze from the open window rustles the pages of his notebook, and he sighs, putting down his pencil and rubbing his aching temples. He likes to write, sure, but this kind of generic narrative essay bores him to the point of exhaustion. It’s nearing mid-August, and he dreads the beginning of school. At least in the summer, he can seclude himself and pretend it’s by choice.
“That’s pretty.”
Copper Beach High School has a tennis court, a baseball field, a soccer field, a football field with a track around it, and a few dilapidated buildings that Castiel assumes are used to house the actual classes. The fields themselves aren’t in the best condition, either; the grass is patchy, and the tennis court fence is rusted through. Still, a track is a track, and a route is a route. You can run anywhere.
He arches a thick eyebrow in confusion. “Are you okay?"
Dean’s looking at Sam like he can’t actually believe that
Dean isn’t at practice for three days—“Bed rest,” Bobby says cryptically whenever anyone asks him—but he shows up the fourth day, stubborn as a mule. He doesn’t run the full route, but he’s there, and he tries just as hard as any other day.
I couldn’t scream
Without further ado, he grasps Dean’s body and pulls him off the nail. Sam winces at the sound, but Castiel does not flinch. He grips Dean by the shoulder and puts his hand over the wound. An unearthly blue light— the light of angelic Grace— flows from his hands, shines from his eyes. It is not the healing we’ve seen before— this power seems to come from the deepest part of Cas
“So can I.”
Charlie types the words, Destiel Fanfiction into the search bar and Sam immediately knows what’s happening.
That asshole ain’t to thank for this one, Sammy.
Dean snickers. “Crying over hot elven chicks, is that right? Damn, Sammy, I know you’re desperate to get laid, but this is a new—”
Air hisses through my teeth. “It’s just that my former girlfriend… that was her favorite drink. And it sounds so…so stupid when I say it like that, but you remind me of her and…yeah, I’m having a rough time.”
“Icebreakers are fool things made up by middle-aged pricks,” Bobby begins. Castiel has never loved anyone more. “But we don’t all know each other here, and since we’re a team, we got to get to know each other. Cas—Castee—” he frowns. “New kid. Novak. Say something about yourself, son.”
Which only makes Sam cry harder.
“Okay!” says Charlie loudly, hoping to diffuse the situation. “Let’s just forget this ever happened and get on with our lives!” She glances at the Winchesters hopefully. “Right? Good? All forgiven and forgotten?”
Great.
“Dean, can you pick up peppermint tea while you’re there?”
(looking between them, suddenly weak)
The music fades, but remains in the background of the scene.
“That’s cute.”
“There go your teammates,” Zachariah says with a hint of disdain, then stops the car. “What are you waiting for, Castiel?”
He half-smiles and looks down at his hands, cupped around the mug of steaming tea.
After practice, Castiel drinks heavily from his water bottle and wipes the sweat from his forehead. It was a hard run, but he feels spent in a good way. Less anxious. He survived the first day; how hard could the rest of them be?
No one dies today.
(Meaning, of course, he goes into town for the first time by himself, not tagging unenthusiastically behind Zachariah to the bank.)
(smiling)
PAN UP from that picture on a table to an older Sam, reading in the study while his son reads next to him, a picture of his father.
“No, no, let me. I’m—I’m sorry, Cas, you’re trying to help and I’m just being really—”
I kicked open the door to our room. Fell to my knees.
(demanding)
Dean hunting with Charlie and Cas, watching their backs as they move through a dark tunnel.
“NO!”
“Oh God, please, please…” I muttered under my breath, “Let her be okay, let it all be fine...”
It’s been two years since the world reverted back to black and white in my eyes.
I pay.
It looks like I have to sit with the tea guy; everywhere else is full. Just my luck.
“Does this mean…”
“Lisa.”
CARRY ON WAYWARD SON begins to PLAY again as the credits roll.
So he settles in, preparing for a long night of reading.
“Do you not see—ugh, you stupid, oblivious dorks!” she half-yells, finally venting her frustration because,
“Same.”
“Your eyes are green,” he says, reaching up to stroke my face, a small smile twisting his mouth.
Bobby moved silently towards the tree line, he could see areas where the undergrowth had been disturbed and the ground had been churned up, the smell of blood was faint but it was all around.
He suddenly stood up and stalked off. Leaving the group reeling.
“Sorry, Cas. It sucks that you can't. Maybe we can find something you can enjoy. Doesn't have to be food, even.” Dean suggested.
Cas started the engine and leaned out of the window giving Dean a sad smile.
“Changed your outfit, Castiel? You look nice.” she said, chuckling as Cas looked away bashfully.
“The shed will take me a week to go through. Have you been in there recently? I have no idea where Bobby finds this stuff” said Sam not-so-secretly itching to explore and categorize the wonders of the shed.
Dean felt sick. “Fucking hell, Cas. No wonder you want to kill the bastard. I would too.”
Sam nodded, until it was confirmed one way or the other, it was wise to act as though he was pregnant. No heavy lifting or anything too strenuous. He wasn't being given busy work, the tasks he had been given were essential, and would probably have fallen to him anyway, so he wasn't offended in the least.
“I’m tired.” Jack said, yawning. “I don’t know why. I haven’t done anything today.” he said looking surprised. “Although I didn’t sleep well last night. I watched TV with Cas instead.”
“Uh, yes. Yes I am.” he said slowly, looking at Dean for help. Dean just shrugged and mouthed wordlessly that he had no idea what to say.
Sam was blushing furiously as he finally found his voice.
Moving swiftly, the group headed through the door, which Cas locked securely behind them.
Dean groaned and dropped his head in his hands. Charlie and Ellen looked sick. Amy was clutching Matthew to her chest, while the little one protested softly in his sleep.
“You have a twin sister?” said Amy, timidly.
“Many of them begged our father to intervene, to guide humanity back from its wasteful and destructive ways, but he was adamant that you learn for yourselves.” Cas continued.
Jake laughed. “Aw, he's alright. Just a little out of his depth. You one of the friends he's goin' with?” he asked.
“Well, my Baby ain’t makin’ it no further on this road.” Dean said regretfully as he pulled the Impala over to turn her around.
The curtain opened and Cas was back in his suit, although the trench coat was over his arm. He didn't meet Deans eyes and his cheeks were still a little pink.
Garth was virtually giddy with excitement at the newcomers after being alone for a few days, the Alphas enthusiasm rubbed off on everyone else and dinner was a festive affair with everyone talking over one another and when Bobby broke out his home brew, it got even louder.
Dean frowned. “What was that, Bud? I couldn't hear you.” he said, looking at Cas in confusion.
Castiel switched from relaxed to battle ready in an instant and fired off multiple questions.
“Castiel!” someone called over the crowd and he turned to identify the voice. “Castiel! Over here!”
Cas shrugged and opened the fridge, bringing out the cheese and setting it on the counter before reaching back in for the beer.
Cas nodded, panting as Deans hand sped up.
Dean thought about if the situation was reversed and felt sick. “Uh, yeah. That makes two of us, I guess.” He smiled. “This is it for me, okay? Us. We’ve gotta make this work, Cas. Neither of us fucking around, and we talk about stuff, okay?” he said seriously.
Suddenly Deans feet began moving of their own accord, chasing the truck.
Cas chuckled. “I know, but still, I felt it only fair to warn you. I tried to clean it up myself, but I made it worse.” he said quietly.
“Dean.” said Cas quietly, he looked nervous and suddenly Dean was too.
Sam snorted a laugh that was cut off when Jess elbowed him.
“We're here, idjits.” he gruffed, trying not to smile at the three pairs of eyes glaring daggers at him in the reflection in his rear view mirror.
Also, Cas is hiding something.
Cas huffed a laugh and fell asleep with a smile on his face.
Dean gripped Cas' shoulder and wept with relief. Sammy was safe.
Bobby took one of the headlights out of Deans truck and wired it up to the trucks battery, suspending the light above her patient in order to give her enough light to operate by. The crates were turned over to create surfaces for various pieces of equipment and bottles and jars and even a raised bed for Cas, the crates covered in a thin bedroll.
“Just put one arm through, Cas, or you look like a dorky kid on their first day at kindergarten.” Dean advised, helping the angel take one arm back out. He gave him an appraising look and grinned. “There, now lets get going.” he said, patting Cas on the shoulder and pushing him towards the door.
Dean recovered first and threw on the charm. “Thank you ma'am.” he said politely as Cas disappeared behind the curtain again. Clearly overwhelmed by the attention.
“ 'One thing led to another'. Yes boy, I know how it works. Congratulations, ya idjits. I suppose I'd better add a nursery to my list of projects. As if I ain't got enough to do around here.” said Bobby, his mock scowl in place as his eyes twinkled in mirth.
Dean frowned. “I ain't a fuckin' homophobe, Sam. Or completely ignorant, I just never thought I was gay... or bisexual, I guess.” he said, with a sigh.
“Let's take a little break, shall we?” said Jess, breaking the kiss and winking slyly at Sam, who grinned back.
Dean watched Benny closely, the Alpha seemed to be doing his best to make up for the bandit attack by throwing himself into making the camp-site habitable again. Knowing they would be there for a few days, he had taken the tarp from the truck and made a temporary shelter. He was as skilled as Dean in survival and by late afternoon, the camp was almost cosy.
Cas looked confused again then a look of dawning realisation came over his face and he rolled his eyes. “Oh, I see. Sausage fest. The sausages are penises.” he said, making Dean choke on his own spit and he could hear Claire roaring with laughter from the phone again.
“Oh. Yeah, that would be bad.” conceded Dean with a grimace.
One by one the group agreed, and Jess let her shoulders relax. Ellen stepped forward “What do you need?”
“It’s gonna be like pin the tail on the donkey, but with rocks and cans. You put on the blindfold, I spin you around and then you try to nail the can with a rock, okay?” he said, untying his shirt from around his waist and hanging it on the trucks mirror.
Jack pouted. “Yeah, I remember.” he sighed sadly.
Sam nodded in agreement. “Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I just hope Cas can explain it to him. He’s an angel, so he doesn’t get most of this stuff himself.” he said, brushing his hair over his ears.
“I think you're pretty wonderful too.” said Dean, before dashing out the door, his face on fire.
“Dean, you don't have to thank me. I'm happy to help you figure this stuff out. And if you decide that Cas is what you want, then I'm happy for that too.” Sam said, with a chuckle.
“If I'd have known you kissed like that, I'd have done it ages ago. You have been holding out on me.” said Dean, looking a little put out at not knowing this essential information.
Dean nodded then grimaced as he felt Cas’ come drying between them.
“I guess all I can do, is start passing off hunts to other hunters. Other than that, I'm lost, Cas.” said Sam, looking helpless.
Landing softly he ducked down behind a truck and surveyed his surroundings. Noticing a tall, thin Alpha exiting one of the wooden outbuildings and marching towards the gate, lantern swaying. He hunched down further until the Alpha was out of range. He figured his best bet was hiding in the building the Alpha had just exited as it was unlikely anyone else was in there, seeing as he had taken the lantern with him, the windows were dark.
“Sure, Dean. Don't think I didn't miss you singing his praises to Sam last night, and the casual check whether Balthazar is his “friend”, seriously, you're transparent dude.” said Charlie, smugly.
Castiel dropped the mic and moved the radio out from between him and Dean, Dean was sobbing so hard he could hardly breathe. The scent of his distress filled the cabin of the truck and Cas couldn't bear it. His instincts to protect dictating his actions. He pulled Dean towards himself and held him, gently stroking the back of his neck as Dean buried his head in Castiels shoulder. Charlie, Jo and Amy were also crying now, having heard the conversation and being similarly affected. Cas looked at them mournfully, unsure how to proceed, so he just held Dean until his sobs died down.
Bobby nodded and stomped off towards Garth's cabin where Benny was now helping Garth move a large rocking chair onto the porch as Cas hung what looked to be a wind chime from the porch roof.
“I do know, Sammy. Dad is just trying to protect us the best way he knows how. It can't be easy for him either. Two Omegas to raise on his own, he must be out of his mind with worry half the time”
Hearing a noise behind him, he turned to see one of the Alphas from the newcomers standing in the doorway to the work shop.
“So, I take it you ain't gonna shoot him?” said Dean to Ellen.
Cas stepped forward. “A few days ago. But I have had feelings for Dean for a very long time.” he admitted, looking guilty.
Bobby gasped as he recognised Dean immediately. He was thinner, his face had a slight gaunt quality to it and his hair was much longer than he usually kept it. The cotton shirt and pants he wore hung off his lean frame, but his smile was exactly the same as he stumbled forwards in his haste to get to Bobby, one arm out in front as his other arm was strapped to his chest.
“I changed my mind. No more kids.” Cas said ruefully, into Deans pyjama shirt.
Cas looked confused. “That didn’t answer my question.”
“Urgh, I don't wanna touch anything in here. Jesus, was he collecting communicable diseases? My guess is he was going for the whole set.” whispered Dean in disgust. Cas frowned and nodded his agreement with that statement. They crept through the room, being careful not to touch anything, their shoes sticking to the slightly tacky floor.
Dean shrugged, trying to play off being called out on his rudeness. “Whatever, I can still run faster than her.” he said cockily.
The distant sound of an engine had Bobby on alert immediately and marching to his porch where his shotgun rested upright against the front step.
in there, and I
Cas had begun to stir as Jess checked him over. Her hands were quick and efficient, checking his wound and making sure he was comfortable, before going to check in on her mate in the other truck. Nodding at Dean as he approached the truck. Dean awkwardly climbed back into the truck bed trying not to disturb the patient he thought was still sleeping. Swearing under his breath, he settled down next to the Alpha and peered over, checking whether he had woken his friend and was rewarded with a sleepy eyed smile.
“I dunno. I'm just tired. Ain't been sleepin' too well.” Dean said, his voice hoarse. “Probably slept about 2 hours in the last three or four days.”
Cas’ hand reached for Deans and covered it, threading his fingers and gripping as he picked up speed, pressing his forehead to the space between Deans shoulders.
His heat had only lasted two days.
It was telling that the younger brother's shoulders tensed as he prepared himself to see his brother. “Cool, I'll start cooking the noodles, if you wouldn't mind taking care of the cheese, Cas?” Sam asked politely.
I'm on twitter (@zoeleeclark) you can give me a follow if you want. I don't tweet much, but I like chatting with new friends.
“Cas! Cas, I’m sorry. That was a dick move. I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I did, and I’m really sorry. Please don’t leave.” he begged.
Cas didn’t answer, he merely undid the tie to his shorts with one hand, loosening the waistband of his shorts with the other.
Sam was humming along to the track and smiled as Dean looked over. His ever-present phone was away for once, and his arm was out of the window, his fingers dancing in the breeze. He too looked more relaxed than he had for a long time.
“I got something that might help with that. It should bring the tension down a notch.” said Bobby, holding up a clear bottle of oil with some sort of flowers in it and an oil lantern.
Claire nodded tightly. “I knew that too. I was your vessel once remember? I could feel how you felt about him, and how scared you were. I just never figured Dean would ever get the balls to do something about it.” she said shaking her head and turning away.
“Uh, Sam?” said Dean, his voice muffled by Sam's shoulder. “What's up with your scent, man?”
“Don't do that again.” said Cas, grumpily “We're almost there, that's the rock I was talking about.” Dean looked at where Cas was pointing, the silhouette of the rock stood out against the gradually lightening sky. He slowed down and steered towards it. Pulling up a few minutes later, he let the truck idle as Cas jumped out and ran over towards a shrub growing off to one side. He turned to the tiny window at the back of the cabin to talk to the girls “Hey, ladies does anyone need the bathroom? This is the last stop for a while” he chuckled as all three of the Omegas scrambled out of the truck bed and disappeared behind a rock.
Cas sighed with relief. “So, you’re not upset with me?” he asked.
Dean huffed and swallowed down a little more tea “Nah, it's just unusual to have this many Omegas under one roof durin' heat season. It's also the first time for her without her mate, that's gotta be hard on her. She might not go into heat at all though, some Omegas don't after their mate dies.” said Dean sadly.
Garth had come through on that, his network of contacts rivalled Bobbys and he had brought in an Alpha medic from a clan that lived in the ruins of a long dead city. The city clan were more advanced than most, they had hoarded knowledge in vast libraries, the kind of which made Bobbys hands twitch with eagerness at the thought of gaining access.
Hi *waves*
For the first time, Cas looked angry as well, he sat up straighter in his chair and glared at Dean who faltered a little under the scrutiny. “Because, my clan is not just the Alphas, Dean! I stayed this long to protect the Betas and Omegas as much as I could. I thought I could change it from the inside. I see now that I was wrong, the Alphas will never change because the current situation benefits them too much. I am not blind to the problems in my clan, Dean. But Lucifer is far, far worse. He is trying to get his hooks into my clan, if he manages a coup... my god. Between his clan and mine? The numbers alone, every other clan on this continent is at risk. If you think the raids are bad now, just wait until he gets organised.” he said coldly.
A look of realisation came over Cas’ face. “Oh, I see. Its a challenge designed to test ones spatial awareness and reflexes.” he said nodding his head. “That sounds acceptable.”
Sam looked over at where Cas was making sure Jacks hair was properly dried. “I’m sorry, okay. I was a jerk. I’ll do whatever it takes to help you guys. This is the only family we’ve got, I wanna keep it together. We didn’t fight all of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory only to lose it now” he said, looking determined.
“So mom was a bad-ass then?” said Sam, still giggling a little, eyes shining. “Your mother was
Cas shook the mans hand firmly. “I am Castiel. Thank you. My friend probably has some idea already, but it's appreciated.”
“Cas, look at me. Please.” Dean begged.
Dean spluttered out a laugh and Sam looked incredulous. “Do I even want to ask how?” he asked.
Back at the motel, everyone quickly changed into shorts, leaving t-shirts on for the walk to the indoor pool. Cas wore a pair of Deans shorts that were loose on Dean, but fitted Cas a little more snugly. His ass and thighs were bigger and the tight material was a little distracting for Dean who was trying not to stare as Cas walked ahead of him next to Jack, who was chattering excitedly.
Sam froze and looked at Jess worriedly.
Balthazar kept backing up, almost out of the cave itself at this point.
“Is he okay?” he croaked out, his voice rough.
Dean ran his hands over Cas’ torso, it felt a little weird. Girls bodies were soft, whereas Cas was solid, firm and as muscled as his own.
Bobby sat at the kitchen table, carefully putting his favourite rifle back together. He'd managed to bring down two large Deer yesterday morning, more than enough meat for a little while. It had taken him the rest of the day to get back and strip and preserve it. So he'd left cleaning his gun until today.
Dean watched Cas climb into the car until Sam stood in front of him, blocking his view.
Dean looked over at Cas and smiled softly. “Eh, normally I’d say hell no. But it’s got to taste better than that soda. Maybe I’ll give it a try.” he said.
Dean chuckled, still sweeping sawdust from the workbench to the floor. “Mostly, yeah. Sam and Bobby do some, but it's just me right now.”
Also, please don't copy this story or post it elsewhere. I know I don't own the characters, but the story and the world it's set in, is all mine.
Dean did up the last button and pointed at Cas with his eyes narrowed. “Okay, rude.” his mouth twitched as he fought not to smile.
Cas' smile lit up his whole face. “This is the best surprise I've ever gotten. Thank you. But why?”
“Sneakin’ off for some heavy petting with my boyfriend? I am officially a teenage girl.” Dean said, rolling his eyes and sighing.
“Just, uh… saw them on the way back and… I know it’s stupid and really fucking corny, but I wanted to give them to you.” Dean has, however possible, grown even more embarrassed. His face flushed, he plays with his fingers, head ducked down.
Cas immediately notices that there’s no music, and Dean lets him turn the radio on. Cas chooses a station that plays nothing but the current crap Top 40. Dean complains that each of the songs is more horrible than the one before, but Cas doesn’t agree. They bicker about it all the way to the store.
Dean chuckles. “L-l-l-like it's hard-d-d,” he teases. “Your s-s-slang still sucks, d-d-dude.”
Despite Dean’s words, Cas is looking at Dean with compassion, like he’s still seeing something completely different than what Dean is. Like he’s not getting at all that Dean isn’t the bright and loving being that he believed him to be.
“Getting ‘frisky’,” he says, using his dorky air quotes, “would only dirty the bath water, and then you would complain.”
Dean scowls and makes sure to enter the mine shaft before him. Not that it did much good the last time they entered a place like this.
“Okay, f-f-first of, n-n-none of your business. S-s-second of all, news f-f-flash, somet-t-times people l-l-like to take it s-s-slow.” Dean has to swallow and force in a deep breath, because now he's agitated on top of tired, and that means he’s a hair’s breadth away from blocking on every third word. Sam at the very least has the decency not to interrupt him while he struggles with his mouth. “Stop m-m-making th-this about m-me. We were just talking-g-g ab-bout
Later, when he goes to retrieve a lore book he left there, Castiel finds Dean in their room. He’s bent over his desk with a deep frown on his face, looking frustrated. Surrounding him are balled-up papers.
Cas cocks his head to the side and squints. "I thought Sam was on a date and Jack was resting."
“And, um.” Suddenly it’s Cas who sounds downright shy. “If you imagine a line stretching along the handle of the dipper, it leads to the constellation of the Herdsman and a star you call Arcturus, which is Ancient Greek for ‘guardian of the bear’, as he is the Great Bear’s keeper, the one keeping watch over him.”
It’s exactly what Dean didn’t even know he needed to hear, which is why he can only stare at Cas mutely. Cas is not mad? Even though Dean lied? Even though he's a mess?
Castiel steps up to him and draws him into a hug, rubs his back. “Happy Birthday, Jack.” His own eyes feel hot but he’s smiling, overcome with joy. Jack clings to him for a moment before letting go and searching his eyes.
every time someone refers to him as Dean’s husband or the other way around.
They put Dean down in a dark and soft place, and then the place starts to move even though Dean is lying on his side and is not moving. He drifts in and out of consciousness, not understanding anything that’s happening. Someone is sitting with him, holding him in place and talking to him softly, but he just wants to sleep. Why aren’t they just letting him sleep?
Sitting up as well, Castiel starts stroking Dean’s back as a compromise. “Do you still want to swim when the others come back? It’s calm today but it might not be tomorrow.”
“Can do more in the water than just get wet, Cas.” Dean waggles his eyebrows and Cas rolls his eyes.
“Was this the surprise?”
“Of course you were.”
Satisfied with the outcome, Castiel sits back down on the edge of the bed and watches the way the water reflects the light. Dean is done eating and, after licking his fingers clean, moves himself closer and lies his head down on Castiel’s shoulder, takes his hand.
To better coordinate their efforts and to offer a home for the holidays for every hunter who wants it, they are preparing to have the bunker not only function as headquarters but also as a sort of holiday bed and breakfast. Castiel can tell that Dean doesn't really like it—his quiet time with his family is important to him, and now "their Christmas" got pushed to a later date. But Dean didn't protest when Sam shared his plans, steadfast in his decision to let Sam take the reigns regarding the network and have his back every step of the way.
“If it causes you too much distress, I won’t go.”
, too. With the relief and the joy of finally realizing that he was home had come the memories and the flashbacks. The migraines that came along with them left him in agony, and more than once Cas had to knock him out, Dean incapable of doing anything but puking and shaking so hard Sam was worried about seizures.
“Can I ask you something?”
Shortly after the lasagna is in the oven, his family is drawn to the kitchen by the smell. Cas is the last to arrive when they've all already sat down to eat—he drops a kiss into Dean's hair and then frowns down at his plate.
Cas squeezes Dean’s fingers back, and then just holds his hand, holds it steady.
"I'd like to make it up to you. Would you like a bath? I've, um. I've maybe stolen Sam and Eileen's Epsom salt. Please don't tell them."
Dean hasn't said a word since he cried earlier. It's not unusual for him to go nonverbal when in distress or when he has a bad speech day, but Castiel isn't sure which one it is right now. When he asks about it, Dean blocks three times before finally getting out "T-t-too ha-a-ard-d-d."
Cas is saying that so far they’ve got nothing and that it will be a while yet until they’re done. It ends with him asking how their meeting went.
The fingers stop carding through his hair, which Dean is not on board with. He frowns and blindly tries to find the hand and put it back there. Cas chuckles, and Dean finally realizes his face is smashed into Cas's chest and the reason that it's wet under his cheek is because he drooled all over Cas's shirt.
“Sor-r-r-ry.”
“If it’s ever not enough—tell us. Please.” She gently squeezes his shoulder. “As for Jack—I think maybe you don’t have to worry quite so much.”
For more days like today, where we can just all spend time together and have fun and no bad things happen." He huffs a breath of laughter. "Dean would say it's really corny, but I don't care."
It's the fucking best. Dean's clean and warm and fed and doesn't have to do anything but cuddle with Cas and laugh at funny pictures of Sam.
“Huh?”
“Best husb-b-band ever!” he exclaims while shrugging into his robe, oblivious to how his words make Castiel feel like he’s once again been handed the sun to keep as his.
“Not true!” Sam says and signs frantically when Eileen turns to look at him with a raised eyebrow.
At long last, and using his superior strategizing skills to his advantage, he manages to navigate past a woman with three shopping carts who has a small goat strapped to her back in a baby carrier, and reaches register six.
“I’ve had lots of vegetables the last couple days.”
Dean gasps awake. He sits up so fast he gets dizzy, pushes the covers away, far away. He shudders, pants, feels the phantom touches like a brand on his skin. His tee is sticking to his back with sweat. When he shifts, he realizes he’s half-hard.
Thinking himself finally free of the fucking back-stabbing blanket, Dean gets up so he can at least make a graceful exit.
Disentangling himself from Cas, Dean got his first good look at him. Cas’s eyes were shining wetly and he looked ruffled and adorable and proud. He shot Dean a shy but happy smile, and Dean found himself mirroring it.
Making frantic shooing motions at him, Dean stage-whispers, ”Go, go, go!”
A part of him wants to hold onto his anger, but it flows out of him with every mile Baby eats up. Shame fills the empty space it leaves behind, leaving him with heartburn and a persistent prickling heat behind his eyes. His phone has gone silent.
Sam sounds urgent, and Castiel quickly puts his shoes on and grabs his trenchcoat.
“Dean?” Castiel tries to keep the alarm out of his voice, leaning forward and gripping Dean’s fingers tightly.
Still uncertain how they even got to this topic or why exactly Dean is so insistent about it, Castiel nonetheless is quick to reassure him. “Of course, Dean.” Sensing an opening, he adds, “If you return the favor.”
If they didn't have guests, Castiel is sure that Dean would long since have made himself at home with his head on Castiel's shoulder, snoring directly into his ear.
“We ate lunch together though,” Jack pipes up, looking confused at the sudden tension. “Me and Dean. He ate just as much as me.”
frown. He looks rumbled and confused and adorable. His hands are
He can hear Sam sniff and then a noise like Sam’s rubbing a hand over his face.
Cas arches an eyebrow at him. "Dean—you promised."
Dean would make a quip about how Sam should change careers and become a birthing class instructor, but he's too busy forcing himself to calm the fuck down. His heart rate gradually goes back to normal but a pounding is starting in his temples that he's unfortunately very familiar with by now. Dean squeezes his eyes shut against it but doesn't manage to suppress a groan.
Dean shakes his head.
“I told you they don’t exist, Dean.”
“Sor-r-ry.” Dean makes a pained noise. He seems to try and gesture at his head with his free hand but the movement is so uncoordinated he mostly just succeeds in smacking it against the pillow behind him.
When Cas got up to get his laptop earlier, Dean took off his hoodie and sweatpants and exchanged them for his nightgown (it’s wrapping him in hugs! And now Cas will too!). So after brushing his fingers over the shiny inside of the abalone, he grabs his sleep mask and then turns off the lamp.
Cas sighs and then moves his hand to lace their fingers together.
Predictably, Cas rolls his eyes and sighs long-sufferingly, but he does snatch the cookie out of Dean’s hand. Ha! Victory.
“You both okay?” Sam asks, elbow deep in suds.
There’s a couple of shampoo and shower gel bottles next to the tub. Castiel nudges Dean awake, coaxes him to sit up a little. Craning his neck to see what Castiel is doing, Dean starts to smirk when Castiel selects a shower gel that has essential oil mixed into it and squirts some into his palm.
. Reluctantly, he pushes himself off of Cas's chest and rubs sleep out of his eyes with the backs of his hands. He squints outside, and it looks like a motel parking lot.
"I've already told Mary. She will come sit with you later if you're feeling well enough."
, which is to touch you, and help you climax, and watch your face when you reach your pleasure."
“You know I’m just ribbing you, right?” Sam is saying, still amused but softer now, fonder. “It’s good to see you—you know, nest. Enjoy stuff again.”
“How you feeling?”
“Cas, hey! Welcome back!” Sam hands one of the hunters, Stevie, a file from the pile in front of him, and offers Cas a gentle smile. Sam seems to have really settled into his role as the leader of the refugee hunters, and while Dean deliberately keeps himself to the sidelines, Castiel hasn’t missed the way Dean’s eyes shine with pride when he watches Sam.
Instead of matching his playful tone, Castiel lets his voice carry the affection he's feeling.
Dean walks him calmly through the steps and they solve the problem together and then Jack tries the next one on his own. They’ve solved five problems out of ten and Dean’s showing Jack a trick how to solve them faster when they’re interrupted by the kid’s stomach growling.
There’s genuine sorrow in his voice, and Dean nuzzles his cheek against Cas's belly.
He had cried a lot since getting back, either from relief or from pain, but nothing like he’d cried then, slumped forwards on his elbows with his hands pressed over his eyes, violent sobs shaking his whole frame, stealing his breath.
“Not a lot, just… sometimes.”
Or maybe it’s only Dean himself that’s a little ridiculous. He certainly feels that way when Cas lays a hand on his shoulder and gently squeezes it. The touch immediately sends Dean’s heart galloping and his stomach quivering. It’s so stupid—Dean’s idiot body actually believes that this touch means more touches will follow. More hugs, more everything. That maybe his hand will be held. That Dean won’t have to lie alone in his bed tonight, hurting and yearning.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel counters, “I know you were excited about swimming and I want you to have that.”
Castiel opens his mouth but then pauses, frowns. He wants to say that Dean being moody sometimes isn’t anything out of the ordinary, but then he thinks. Dean’s been quiet, by turns clingy and distant. He’s been keeping to himself during group activities, claiming to be tired. Which made sense because he hasn’t been sleeping well, but now that Castiel looks back on the last couple of days, it feels like he has been missing something.
Cas must get that this is one of those moments where Dean feels too emotionally vulnerable to answer. He puts a comforting hand on Dean’s back and steps slightly forward where he’s standing beside Dean’s wheelchair, shielding him from everyone’s view.
And he does.
"Yeah, c'mon man," Sam is saying, smiling encouragingly at Dean like he's some stubborn toddler. "There's tomato sauce and cheese on them, you won't even taste much else!"
Rolling himself out, Dean blinks against the light.
Yeah. Just another moment.
Castiel puts an arm around him and strokes up and down his side. “You’re very affectionate today,” he observes, though really Dean is generally quite cuddly when they’re in private. And often when they’re not in private too, like when they’re all watching a movie together in the Cave.
“Do you want me to stroke your hair?”
Jaw clenched and shoulders rigid, Dean waits until he can't hear Sam's footsteps anymore. It takes him an additional couple seconds to get his feet moving, and then he walks around Baby and picks up the plate.
Cas is looking something between touched and embarrassed at same time, so Dean grins ruefully and adds, “Remem-m-m-ber our first k-kiss? I was so nerv-v-vous I alm-m-most missed your mouth.”
“Well, I d-d-don’t l-l-like t-to b-b-be touched without perm-m-mission, b-but you h-h-have it, so.” He shrugs. Something in his tone must suggest there were times when someone did not stop when he said no, and Cas is looking at him like he wants to ask about it, but Dean shakes his head. Not now.
Dean, who had been completely ignoring the two of them, whirls on them now.
One kiss turns into the next, and the next, Dean slowly melting into relaxation beneath him. There’s nothing but the sounds of their breaths and their mouths and the shifting of fabric on skin as they adjust their position slightly. The calming scent of chamomile from the cream wafts up as Dean rests his still upheld hands on Castiel’s arms.
Castiel examines the guilt for a moment, and then lets it go. It's in the past, he's tried to atone, and he was different then.
It’s now been about twenty minutes. But there is probably a line in the restroom, or maybe Dean is shopping on his own and about to meet Castiel in the middle.
The screen goes dark, and Dean presses the button again. He can’t be sure, but he thinks this is from before the flashbacks started, when he couldn’t bear thinking, much less talking about what he’d been through, when he was still struggling with his shattered voice and exhausted body.
Dean shakes his head and leans back in, because nope, just no.
“May I…?”
“You scared me, Dean.”
He pitches forward and pinches the bridge of his nose, tears running down his hand and dropping down onto the sand.
Dean glowers at Sam, but it has zero effect. Smugly munching on his stolen chocolate and his eyes lit up with mischief, Sam only seems amused.
Joy and pride light up Sam’s eyes. “Yeah, I think you’re right about that.” Castiel isn’t sure if Sam realizes it, but he is being every bit the protective, supportive big brother to Jack that Dean has always been to him.
Putting Baby back in drive, Dean turns her around and points her home. He doesn’t bother putting any music on. Rain hits the windshield in waves, endless waves.
“Yeah, I talked with him already, think he's packing a bag now. Hey, are you really not gonna eat that?”
A tear trailed down his cheek. Dean angrily wiped it away. “You’re l-l-left w-with
There’s a smudge of chocolate at the corner of his mouth, from the s’mores they had earlier. Reaching out, Castiel rubs it away with his thumb. Dean playfully tries to chase after it to bite it, pouting when Castiel evades him.
“You said you would be okay with it as long as there was meat in it.”
“Cas? You th-there?”
“What for?”
Old guilt tries to rise at the thought; the angels streaking through the night sky like falling stars, crying and screaming and dying.
“So get this,” Sam is saying. “That thing up in Hot Springs, South Dakota, that we thought was probably just a couple of ghouls gone rogue? Is heavy duty black magic. I’ve already called Rowena, she’s going to meet us there.” Addressing Maggie, he asks her to stay back and take care of things at the bunker, but Castiel is no longer really listening.
“Oh y-yeah?” Dean asks, leaning in, looking at Cas through hooded eyes, unable to keep from smiling.
Cas meets his eyes. Because Dean’s apparently a pining housewife whose husband just got back from the war, his heart skips a beat and he has to fight the urge to reach for Cas’s hand.
That makes Dean smile like a dope, a warmth running through him that has nothing to do with his arousal. He shifts even closer and gets his hand around both of them, echoing Cas's moan, pleasure zinging down his spine to pool between his legs. It’s good, so good, he could totally get off on this, but he kind of—he wants—
Dean claps Sam on the shoulder, “St-t-tay safe.” Then he draws Castiel in for a quick hug, “You too.”
long, making Dean salivate just from looking. One day, he’s going to sit on that thing and ride it until they both forget their names. Maybe while wearing his Stetson, just so he can annoy Cas by making a million cowboy jokes before, during, and after.
Trying not to show his irritation—didn't Cas want to spend time with him?—Dean waved him off. "Sam's still not back from his run. And when he is, he's gonna take a shower, and then raid the fridge, and then take a nap, trust me. Besides, the freaking lore ain't going anywhere." Well, neither was the movie, but—but! "I told you man, you gotta learn to kick back and have fun from time to time."
“It sounds terrifying,” Cas says, his voice rumbling in his chest where Dean's ear is pressed against it. Jack and Sam argue something back, but Dean barely registers half of it, finally drifting off.
Dean must have decided that he feels lonely, because he tugs at the back of Castiel’s shirt insistently. Acquiescing to his demands, Castiel lies down only to immediately have Dean make himself at home with his head on Castiel’s chest and an arm slung around his waist.
“Dean?”
Jack lights up.
Chuck had looked at Dean then, contempt written all over his face. “Like you. You know, if you’d just done what you were supposed to, I’d maybe have shown mercy and snapped my fingers and
Castiel stares out the window, sometimes grimacing at a particularly uncomfortable twinge in his chest as his grace is hard at work.
“Well, he b-b-better k-keep it to himself, or I’mma stick his h-h-head in the sand-d-d.”
Sam huffs out a laugh and Eileen coos. “Aww, you brought Dean pie? You’re such a good husband.”
Shifting on the bed, Dean takes a moment to marshal his thoughts, sort through his feelings. Let down the protective walls. There’s a loose thread in the comforter and he starts fiddling with it with his free hand while he talks.
“Not th-that, dummy.”
The others seem to buy it, teasing Dean lightheartedly about being a grump, though Sam meets Castiel's eyes and nods once in understanding.
So, once the coffee is done, Dean parks himself at the stove and prepares a serving of scrambled eggs for himself and two egg white omelets for his stupid hippy brother. His stupid
“You did well.” Castiel is gentle in this, and Dean hates himself for finding comfort in the soft stroking motion. “It’s your decision if this happens again. Have you learned your lesson, Dean?”
“I’ve done enough for you. He won’t die here. He can’t.”
Sam hasn’t run away, and that may honestly scare Dean more than anything else so far. He’s still on his knees, head bowed. It’s… wrong. Sam is the one who never stops fighting, who pushes and punches and screams at the world to make sense. He doesn’t give in, not to Hell and not to Heaven, not to the monsters in the dark and not even to family. He’s always sure of himself, even when he’s plainly not in the right. It’s one of the things Dean can always count on.
Sun-warmed grass underfoot, soft breeze against his skin as he walks across the lawn. Dean has never felt so naked in his life. He can still taste Castiel, feel the places Cas was touching him — there’s a warmth circling around his cock where Cas’ fingers were and the sensation is keeping his erection from fading.
“Good boy.” Castiel cups his hand along Dean’s cheek and eases Dean back, until his cock slips out to lie against his thigh. His thumb traces over Dean’s lips. “On your feet, Dean.”
. He pushes ever so slightly and Castiel spreads his legs wider, wide enough that Dean can shuffle closer and rest his head against one thigh, nuzzling as he does. Like a fucking pet.
Night spreads over the sky like ink in a well, and Dean shivers and shakes. He’s lost feeling in his legs and his hands have gone numb with cold. At some point he passes out, coming too with his face pressed into the gravel and light seeping in from the east. He takes the time to ease the feeling back into his limbs, to drink greedily from a nearby pond and relieve himself, and then he comes back before the doors and kneels again. The sun slowly washes over the building, pooling down onto the stone where he waits.
, Dean pleads silently as he maneuvers Sam over to the bench. Sam fights every inch of the way, fights to stay on his feet when Dean shoves him facedown, fights to get back up once Dean has him lying on the stone. Dean half-stands half-kneels over him, one knee wedged between Sam’s legs as he twists Sam’s arm until he cries and stops struggling. Dean flattens one hand against Sam’s back to hold him in place and starts pulling at his jeans with the other until they’re mid-thigh.
He’s such an idiot. His head is a mix of static and adrenaline, awake and distant all at once. The sun is out, he had sex with Cas, and now he has to rape his brother. Dean doesn’t really have a plan when he walks into the greenhouse. How do you plan raping someone? But Sam isn’t in the greenhouse. Dean searches the building twice, but he’s just not here.
The darkness parts like a curtain and Dean finds himself in a large space, open with sunlight and warm wood and living greenery and flowers. There’s a dais on the far end of the hall, and a plain white throne where Castiel sits watching. His face is in shadow, unreadable from where Dean stands.
It’s so hard to think.
Gentle fingers against his face, tilting his head up and blue blue blue eyes meet his like a shock.
“Castiel, I swear to God—“
“On your knees, you pathetic little ant. You do not stand before me.” Dean holds his hands up and sinks to his knees. “Better. Maybe you can be taught.”
The silence is overwhelming but not unending. God if only it were. Dean makes small noises as he goes about his days here, one after another turning into weeks — the shuffling of socked feet on dirt, the brush of clothes against plants, the clanking of pottery on stone when he fetches water.
. “I haven’t touched him, Dean. I didn’t have to, not with you to push him out of safety.” Sam whimpers in counterpoint, and Cas tilts his head in detached curiosity. “Honestly I’m surprised he was able to make it here.”
Sam gives a dry, mirthless chuckle and says, “What isn’t?”
How much porn did Castiel watch on his own?
A month ago Dean would have sworn they could fix this. Cas had been stubborn about his choices, so sure as he burned every bridge that he was doing the right thing, but he’d kept reaching out to the brothers. And now… it’s like Sam and the demon blood all over again. Something in the power Cas took in has changed him, but how do you get someone to understand that their head isn’t right? And how do you kill a God when they control everything? Everything they have in this garden is there because Castiel gave it to them, everything that’s missing is because he took it. Every weapon, every opportunity. Even the fact that they’re together instead of separated… it’s all by design.
Anything’s worth it, though. For Sam.
The world is quiet as he approaches Sam, broken only by their breathing and the pounding of Dean’s heart. Sam flinches at nothing and makes a broken croaking noise. He shattered his voice again while Dean was gone. He’s on his feet and swinging at thin air before Dean can reach out to touch him, and that simplifies things. Gives Dean a role to play and no illusions about what he’s about to do to Sam. Sam doesn’t even see Dean approaching, but he lashes out as soon as Dean grabs his arm. It connects hard and Dean’s going to have a bruise, but he ignores the pain and twists until he has Sam in an arm bar.
Castiel finally moves, fingers weaving through Dean’s hair as he gives another moan and closes his eyes. He’s gentle, more holding onto Dean as he moves than any attempt to change the pattern, but his hands still tug gently with each bob. It sends a pleasant tingle from scalp to toe, and Dean flushes when he realizes he’s responding — the taste of precome on his tongue, the warm heavy weight of Cas in his mouth, the familiar position of being on his knees in front of a partner — the sights and tastes and sounds of arousal build on one another, and warmth pools in his groin.
Dean repositions himself on the bench, half lying on top of Sam, and gently pushes in. Sam tenses and Dean can hear his breathing speed up, panic layering over the paralysis of fear. It’s still on this side of tight and Dean pants against Sam’s shoulder as he fights to go slow, not hump his way too deep into the blissful warmth of his brother’s body. He starts moving, rolling his hips in smooth long strokes to give Sam time to get used to the motion. The soft sobs start mixing with panting and then Sam presses back into him and Dean’s lost, chasing after the friction and ecstasy waiting just out of reach.
Sometimes it’s
Which really makes the tentacle plants weird.
Castiel’s hand wrapped around Sam’s throat, holding him against the frosted glass of the wall.
Hands in his hair pulling him up just enough and air rushes in, sweet and bright and euphoric. Dean manages a few breaths before Castiel starts moving him again, fucking into the tight muscle at the back of Dean’s throat. It burns and Dean whimpers voicelessly. “You would do anything for your brother, out of love. You come to me on your knees with resentment in your heart, because you love him too much to see him suffer. You think
Dean looks up through his lashes and licks his lips, the ones half the men across the country have told him were made for this, leaving them parted ever so slightly in invitation. His skin is heating up, shame at having to do this mixing with adrenaline, but he can pass it off as desire. Desire that Castiel is very evidently feeling; Dean can see the line of his cock slowly filling out inside his slacks.
You do not get to say no.” The grip on his hair tightens painfully, and Dean can’t make a sound. “You do not get to rebel. You do not get to put
No real space between them. Sam’s shirt rucked up and his jeans loose around his thighs. Blatant hunger as Castiel bites at Sam’s lips and his hand moves between their bodies.
He kneels in front of the door, head bowed in prayer.
“Then
There’s nothing behind Castiel’s eyes but the weight of that gaze is impossible to escape, and Dean can’t breathe. “Say thank you, Dean.”
Dean chokes out another “thank you, Castiel” before the angel-turned-deity vanishes, leaving the brothers alone.
“I am God.” Castiel reaches back and pulls the angel blade free from his own flesh. He stares a moment at the bloodless blade before vanishing it. “A better one than my father. Heaven’s throne has been abandoned for too long.”
“Didn’t mean to stab me in the back?” There’s fury underneath that coolness and Dean is on thin ice.
“If you’ve come to beg on your brother’s behalf, spare me.” Dean shivers at Castiel’s tone. It’s ice and knives and fury.
they can do. Some kind of way out of here. There’s less hope and more desperation in Dean’s spirit but he’s not broken yet. Not by a long shot. He’s broken out of Heaven and Hell, faced down demons and demigods and archangels and Death himself (the part where he was terrified of Death and didn’t actually win most of these encounters is, of course, not something he thinks about here.) Step one to fixing this is exploring their new prison.
Castiel hushing Sam again, then, “Spread your legs for me, Sam.” Skin slick and wet and a pleased groan. Dean drops his head to the ground — he can still taste Cas on his tongue and nausea finally floods over him. God, what has he done.
Enough of his common sense comes back online that Dean relaxes into it, letting Castiel in. Generally speaking, saying no to a god doesn’t end well. Side effects include death, dying, pain, and oh yeah death. But none of that happens next. Castiel presses against him, leaning into the kiss and making Dean very aware of the hot line of his erection. But he doesn’t grind or thrust. He pulls back and stands a breath away, eyes closed.
Dean’s musings are interrupted by a distant shout. He jerks around towards the source and then he’s pushing through the tangle, heedless of the cuts he’s inflicting on himself, running as soon as he hits the lawn because that’s Sam and he’s in trouble. The flowerbeds may be trampled in the process, Dean doesn’t notice except to make sure he won’t twist his ankle as he heads to the greenhouse.
. Dean’s mouth forms the shape but nothing comes out. He reaches out to cradle Sam’s face, brushing the tears away.
Castiel sighs, kisses Sam one more time, and lets him go. Sam slides down to his knees as Castiel turns and stalks over to where Dean is hanging; hair standing on end like a current lives under his skin, blue eyes blank and not even a crack in the stone of his expression, the only thing human about Castiel is the rumpled and half undone state of his clothing, and Dean remembers he should be terrified. The adrenaline racing through his veins screams at him to run and he can barely flinch against the weight of Castiel’s will as the deity closes in on him. Dean glares his defiance, certain as Castiel brings his hand up that this is the end and just as certain that he’s going to find a way to make Cas pay. He’s not expecting for Cas to kiss him, hand fisting in Dean’s hair. It’s angry and forceful, full of teeth and hunger and domination.
The crushed stones make his bones ache, and the sun is relentless as it beats down on him, but Dean holds fast. That first day, Castiel told him what he wanted. Love faith and obedience. He told Sam to be good and let Castiel take what he wanted — be obedient. So Dean waits on his knees and begs silently for the chance to try and be good again.
“You still have no idea what I want, do you?” Castiel muses, moving a hand to wrap around the back of Dean’s neck. When Dean tries to pull back this time Castiel doesn’t let him; the gentle touch turns into steel, holding Dean in place as he starts to panic, pulling him further down until the head of Castiel’s cock pops back into Dean’s throat. He can’t breathe like this, he’s choking and Cas won’t budge even as Dean starts pushing and pummeling at him.
“You are going to fuck your brother, Dean.” Castiel speaks and somewhere those words are etched in stone. “You’re going to give him the same paltry offering you
Dean shudders.
He looks up slowly and brings his hands to rest on his thighs. Castiel is a statue in front of him but that’s nothing new. He can do this.
“And what do you think I want?” Castiel asks, soft as velvet over steel.
Dean swallows hard and walks across the room to stand and then, as gracefully as he can manage, kneel in front of his former friend. He keeps his eyes low, focusing on the base of the throne and Castiel’s shoes. Black on white. The silence is deafening, broken only by the sound of his own breathing and a faint ringing noise that might be panic or might be angels. Dean can’t tell.
filled with so much hope and despair all at once.
Dean’s anger flickers and fades in the face of his desperation. All his plans of killing Castiel and exacting revenge crumble to dust as slowly he understands. There’s no way out. No one’s coming to save them. There’s no way to fight their way free. Only one choice is left, really.
Only Castiel’s breathing betrays him. His hands are still on the armrests of the throne, his face is still impassive and unreadable, but Dean can hear the difference. He’s spent weeks listening, after all. One hand glides up to cover Castiel’s cock, and Dean starts squeezing and stroking, encouraging Castiel to full hardness. A low groan meets his efforts, and Castiel slides forward slightly in his seat. Bingo.
“Do you know what you have to do?” Castiel bites at the join of Dean’s neck and shoulder, and Dean shivers and humps forward into Cas’ hand instinctively.
It takes time for Sam to come to. Longer until he recognizes who Dean is, and Dean is pretty sure he’ll never get over the look on Sam’s face when he first wakes up. His first panicked word was “Lucifer”, so that’s a fantastic sign.
He goes. The door shuts behind him with a thud.
For what, exactly, Dean isn’t sure.
Sam crying.
“How very like you,” Castiel finally looks at Dean, and Dean flinches away from the storm there. “You betray me, try to manipulate me out of fear while professing you care, and as soon as Sam is hurt you abandon all pretense of caring for me, your Lord and
Well screw that. There has to be
“What the hell are you talking about?” Dean grits out.
There’s a greenhouse nearby, fairly large and flush with living plants, long-leaf tropical shrubs and trees and flowers, orchids and blooming cacti, soft mosses and dangling vines. It’s beautiful, and humid, and devoid of weapons. It takes the better part of an hour to move Sam from the lawn where they arrived into the building; Sam stumbles and jumps at everything, leaning into Dean for support and nearly toppling them both, then trying to run away. Every instinct Dean has is telling him to pray to Cas and beg for help, because somehow his brain hasn’t quite caught on yet that they aren’t friends anymore and God, Sam needs help so badly. But this time Cas won’t come when Dean calls.
The gardens belong to a massive sandstone house that Dean can’t get into; iron bound oak doors taller than his head stand firmly locked, the windows are pitch black and shatterproof, and the longer he stands in the shadow of the building the more uneasy he feels. He’s not meant to go inside. There’s nothing else that offers decent shelter on the grounds — benches covered by dripping wisteria and gazebos twined with clematis and rose, dozens of nooks and crannies that would be perfect for a tryst if you’re into plants, but nowhere to get out of the rain.
“Look at you,” Castiel says softly, pleased. Dean’s still humping against Sam, trying to hold still enough that he doesn’t lose Cas. “Do you want to come, Dean?”
Castiel lets him go and sits back down on his throne. He’s still rumpled, skin sweat slick and with his dick hanging out; achingly human and entirely not. There’s something in his eyes that makes Dean shudder and look away, a deeper hunger that Dean doesn’t want to think about. “Go.”
. Even in the quiet of his own mind it is difficult to force them out.
It’s impossible to keep emotion out of it when your words are a prayer crafted between mind and soul, and Dean winces at the anger and resentment that’s still welling up in him on seeing Castiel again.
The dark nights are broken by desperate Latin prayers, banishing demons and begging for God to cleanse him and forgive him. Or by Sam raining down unbridled fury with kicks and blows meant to kill.
A wave of force slams into Dean, and this time it doesn’t stop. He’s pinned against the glass like a butterfly about to breathe his last, and Castiel finally looks at him.
It goes on. Until at last the light of Sam’s soul cuts out, and Dean is left in the dark. Castiel makes a pleased sound and the rest (skin on skin, wet and filthy fucking and Dean can’t…) comes to its own end. He does not hear Castiel approaching, too focused on the sound of Sam’s breathing, the quiet hitching noises of stifled sobs. The hand in his hair is a shock, and he flinches but he can’t make himself look up.
Broken clay tears roughly through Dean’s palm and he sketches the ward to banish an angel on the stone floor. “I said,” he slams his bloody hand against it and the world whites out, “let him
Castiel huffs, a bitter chuckle. “So ready to sell your soul again, for him.” Dean can’t help but flinch at that barb, but he straightens and meets Cas’ gaze because yeah, actually. It’s
“Cas—“
The temperature drops when Dean hits the greenhouse entrance, which makes him stumble. A layer of mist hides the plants and cacti more than a few steps beyond the door and muffles all sound, even Dean’s footsteps. A lifetime of experience hunting is screaming that something powerful is angry, but Sam is somewhere deeper in.
This time Cas might actually want Sam to suffer. Penance for sins committed, or maybe just because Dean managed to piss Cas off.
He’s pounding into Sam now, curled over his brother’s body and thrust thrust thrust, grind deep and beg to come.
,” and here Castiel snarls, “will be left unpunished. I allowed a great deal when we were friends, Dean. Pets and playthings have much less grace and will learn their place.”
Deicide is also on the table.
It’s… a garden. Manicured lawns, flowerbeds, artistically shaped trees, quiet ponds filled with lotus blooms, babbling fountains and brooks. It’s beautiful, and too-perfect. No weeds, no plants out of place, no cranky gardener yelling for Dean to get off of the lawn, no mosquitos, no birds. No squirrels. There is nothing alive and nothing out of place and Dean grows more and more uneasy the further he explores.
Cas squints up at him.
"I'll expl-l-lain it w-w-when you're older, Sammy.")
His phone is in his pants pocket and he needs to lean to the side to get it out. His grip is so shaky that it slips through his fingers and slithers away over the tiles. With a bitten off curse, Dean twists even more to the side to reach it, and that's when he finally notices the warning signs his body is sending him.
Still, “I don’t know if I c-c-can, y’know. Just turn th-that off. And I really d-do n-n-need to t-talk to S-S-Sam l-l-later. Didn’t g-get a chance with this,” he taps against his temple, “a-a-acting u-up.”
“Can I help you up?”
"Did you have a good birthday? If we went overboard, you can tell us."
Dean sat down between them at the head of the table, eyes low, hands fidgeting in his lap.
“We’re good here,” Castiel translates, wrapping an arm around Dean’s back.
Sometimes, the slimy, dirty feelings are still there. Dean never thought that simply having someone like Cas by his side, who knows about them and never pressures Dean to push through them, would be such a great relief.
Cas makes to add something, then suddenly falters. He looks almost nervous when he says, “I thought it would be a waste of money to get two beds since I don't sleep, so. Our room just has one, um, bed.” He looks up at Dean, and he's definitely nervous when he peers into his eyes. “I hope that's okay?”
Sam snorts and Castiel tries to hide his smile, though he’s mostly unsuccessful. Dean had lit up when the baby had smiled at him, and it was deeply endearing to watch them play, to see how happy it made Dean when the baby laughed and squealed in response to his silly faces.
He retreats back into the hallway. In the kitchen, he carefully washes and dries the plate and puts it away.
"St-t-tupid piece 'a crap won't g-g-get c-c-clean."
Cas shifts on the bed, avoiding Dean’s eyes. He looks like he’s as surprised as Dean is by what he just said.
Putting his boots back on, he makes his way to the kitchen. First order of business : fix their buggy stove so Dean can do what he does best—feed his family.
The sun is rising.
That moment when he realized the curse on the object they’d been looking for was stronger than he thought, and Dean's frantic hands on him before everything went black. Jack's smile when he told him about the movie he wanted to watch. How Castiel feels so many things, and he sometimes still doesn't understand them.
Yeah, that's ‘cause he was thinking. Never been his strong suit.
It wants Cas to never leave Dean’s side ever. It wants Dean to claw off their dirtied skin and never have them be touched ever again. It wants to kill everyone that’s ever put a hand on them, no matter how gentle it was.
“Dean…”
“How did the hunt go?”
was a tiny little bit mopey. And hasn’t been sleeping well. But you didn’t hear it from me.”
Sam keeps fiddling with his phone; putting it away, pulling it back out again, then stuffing it almost angrily into his jacket. Dean leaves him be. When it looks like Sam is settling in for a nap himself, Dean switches the radio to a soft rock station. Zep's
Cas hums. “They’re marsupials, actually. And while they look soft, their fur is very coarse, like sheep wool. They used to be the size of a full-grown bull, and—”
It’s early afternoon when Castiel and Jack return to the bunker after their hunting trip. It was a simple case, a haunting, and Castiel had stepped back and let Jack make most of the decisions. The hunt was a success, and seeing Jack gain confidence and learn to trust his own instincts makes Castiel feel incredibly proud.
“That’s your problem then.”
for a chance to dirty the bath water with me,” he points out, closing his eyes and leaning further into Cas’s touch.
“She in the area?”
Castiel had of course offered to put Dean to sleep with his grace right away, but Dean had refused. Ever since the “incident” where Castiel had misjudged a cursed object and ended up basically powerless for several days, Dean’s been insisting on self-reliance more and more. It hasn’t led to a full out fight—yet—but certainly to many arguments.
“You will sulk if I don't kiss you, won't you?”
, of all things, and he tries to cover it up with a snort.
"Your eyes look glassy. Maybe you're coming down with something."
Cas sits down in the middle of the backseat, the kid to his left. Dean plasters himself to Cas's other side, resting his head on Cas's shoulder and immediately closing his eyes. The last thing he’s aware of is Cas putting his arm around him and the car rumbling to life under them, and then he’s out.
Dean pouts, and briefly contemplates complaining, but he knows Cas is right. He needs to get going.
Bent over his bowl of soup, it takes Dean a moment to realize Jack is looking at him.
“It’s not bowing out, Dean,” Cas says, mildly chiding. “It’s taking care of yourself.”
Something desperate arises in Castiel and he leans forward and steals a second kiss. Dean smiles into it, his mouth sticky with syrup, his soul so strong and so fragile in Castiel’s hold.
Like a switch getting flipped, the way the kid clings to Dean activates whatever caretaking abilities are buried within him. His muscles relax, his heart beat becomes steady. His arms come up around Jack and hold him close; one hand rubbing over the kid’s back and the other cupping the back of his head.
They’ve just returned from shopping and Sam is helping them stow everything away. “What took you guys so long?” he asks, though he sounds more amused than annoyed. “Dean flirt with Betty again?”
“Cas?” he asks when they’re done, holding his hands up per Castiel’s instruction so the cream won’t be rubbed off again right away. He sounds so small, and when Castiel looks down at him from where he’s sitting, all of Dean’s protective walls are stripped away and what’s left is a tired, emotional, and vulnerable man. It's a side of him Castiel really only gets to see when they're in private, when it's just the two of them.
There’s a ringing noise and Sam screams as light floods the twilit grove, outlining Castiel in pure blue white — Sam’s legs bent up, Cas thrusting quick and deep, supporting himself with one hand and the other arm moving in Sam’s chest to touch his soul. Fixing him. Raping him.
. Dean moves cautiously, heart in his mouth at the danger if Castiel objects to what he’s about to do. He leans forward and hesitantly places his hands on the tops of Castiel’s knees, sliding his thumbs up along the inside of Cas’ thighs; there’s a small inhale of breath, which Dean takes as a good sign.
“Sorry,” Sam mumbles. His eyes aren’t focusing and he doesn’t seem to notice the tears still falling down his face. “I’ll be good.”
Sam hisses, half angry and half pleading. “Don’t, you promised. I said yes and you promised you’d stop, please.”
“Sam.” Castiel hushes when Sam whimpers and tries to hide his face. His touch is gentle as he moves Sam, abandoning the rough stone for the cool damp of the lawn. Gentle kisses and petting as Sam struggles in Castiel’s arms, disoriented, until he relaxes and quiets. From here, Dean can see the mess he made of his brother; come dripping from Sam’s hole, face and stomach and limp cock all scratched up from rubbing back and forth on the bench. There’s a dull ache where his heart used to beat; he’d kill anyone else for hurting Sam like this.
He looks broken.
Five weeks of screaming and silence is all Dean can take.
“You want so desperately for me to fix your brother? Fine.” Cas brings one hand to his own cock and begins stroking quickly, just brushing against Dean’s lips up the upstroke. “Then you can play by the rules you’ve set up.” Cas strokes himself one last time and curls forward with a gasp. Hot liquid floods Dean’s mouth, bitter and salt and too much to be able to swallow at once, though he tries. Castiel lets him go as the last few spurts dribble across Dean’s tongue. There’s enough thought left in Dean’s head that he stays put, holding Castiel’s still-hard cock in his mouth.
“Looks good, buddy.”
Even though it hurts to see him like this, Castiel feels a certain peace wash over him that only Dean has ever been able to bring him. By Dean’s side is the one place in all of creation he feels like he belongs, the place he has chosen to be his home.
“Don’t fall asleep,” Cas warns. “We need to go over the case now that Eileen is here.”
Dean frowns, immediately feeling his mood sink.
“I m-m-mean it’s j-j-just w-w-weird, w-when you th-think y-your p-p-parents a-a-are a c-c-certain w-w-way a-a-and then they’re not. A-a-and it’s w-w-weird w-w-watching your m-mom m-make out with someone. ‘Cept I’m not Sam’s m-mom n-now. I just w-w-was.”
It would be even nicer if Cas would run his hand up and down, rub Dean's back a little, but he's going to take what he can get.
Dean wants to smile and laugh, because Cas is repeating his own words back at him, and they mean so,
, you were too far away.”
Eileen and Dean have developed not only an important friendship, but also, in the face of their communication barriers, somewhat of a language of their own. It's not the first time Castiel has noticed this, but he's maybe a little emotional today and the sight of Dean happy always does things to him.
“Dean, you’re shaking.” Cas tries to maneuver Dean to get a look at him but Dean only clings tighter, hiding his face in Cas’s shoulder like a stupid kid. If Cas looks at him then he will see
The bed creaks a little underneath Castiel when he turns over onto his stomach so he can type and look at the screen more comfortably. Dean makes a soft noise in his sleep, shifting a little.
Maybe, yeah. But when has that mattered, like ever?
Having expected the conversation to go kind of differently, Dean doesn’t know what to say to that.
Or with car trouble.
"Yes, you've just missed him. He went for a run, he wanted to clear his head."
Cas's arms come up around Dean’s shoulders, holding him close, and Dean leans back to search his eyes.
Dean sticks his head into the kitchen.
Used to his antics, Martha snorts and shakes her head, smiling in amusement. “Your husband is quite the sweet-talker, gotta say.”
Castiel keeps up the humming for a while longer while he pets Dean’s hair and just enjoys holding him. While it has worked before, he’s still surprised that he could actually help with Dean’s insomnia without using his grace at all.
Dean wants to say that after all she’s been through, she probably can’t trust someone she doesn’t even know with something that private, but Cas is already talking again.
Dean knuckles at his eyes and squints. His brain feels like mush. It's definitely time to go night night, but Dean doesn't like it at all. It means he’ll have to leave.
None of them own swim trunks, so that means shopping trip. “I w-w-want one w-with a sh-sh-shark on it,” Dean says when they’re back in their room and he’s brushed his teeth for the second time today so Cas stops complaining about the lingering walnut taste he does not care for.
Cas strokes his back for another couple minutes, but then his hand slows a stop. Dean’s about to make his displeasure with that known when Cas says, “I wish it could always be like this. I
About an hour after they turned on the TV, Dean finally returns. Sam, who had been dozing in his chair, startles awake but Dean doesn’t look at either of them. He’s wearing a bathrobe and toweling his hair dry. He must have just showered, but there's still a faint smell of chlorine, so he probably swam laps down in the bunker’s pool. Ever since they discovered it and got it running again, Dean has turned to it for stress relief.
Castiel only just manages to heave him up a little and grab the bucket before Dean's throwing up into it. Dean had felt less nauseous while in the bathroom, so Castiel had hoped it wouldn’t come to this.
“Gonna be. Just uh, need time.”
Dean pushes himself up so fast he dislodges Castiel’s hand. He’s frowning at Castiel, mouth pulled down unhappily. “What? Why?”
“What? Why?”
“I know, Cas.”
“I’m sorry, but your mouth tastes terrible.”
help. But—
Dean’s own vision is swimming. Ignoring the consequences, he reaches out for Cas’s hand.
He gasps every time he breathes in and his cheeks are wet and he knows the despair he feels is stupid and senseless but he just can’t stop it. The
“There. All better.” Cas looked even more amused. “You know you’re supposed to drink it, right?”
Tugging the blankets up higher over his back, Dean huddled into them for warmth, huddled into them and hid himself.
"I want to see him. I won't try and use my grace, I just want to check on him."
“Dean, listen, this might be temporary. And even if it’s not, we can find a way to work around it. It’s—”
Cas goes very still.
From somewhere behind him, he can hear Cas chuckle.
"Uh, yeah. Th-thanks." Dean doesn't lift his head, doesn't meet Castiel's eyes, doesn't clap him on the back. He just turns and leaves. It’s only now that Castiel realizes Dean never demanded
“Send it to me,” he says and then yawns, moving to lie down flat on his back inside the shelter.
“No, Dean.”
There hadn’t been a lot of refugee hunters who were able to come at such short notice. Dean had stepped up to take care of the ones that did come, taking some of the weight off Sam’s shoulders. He’d been in the kitchen with two of them—Kit and Valerie, he learned later—getting some beer out of the fridge for them, when it happened for the first time.
“W-w-what’re you using-g-g right n-n-now?”
d-d-don’t need you to be. I just w-w-want a little more of
"I'm okay to keep driving. It's only a few more hours, and you need the rest." He does feel kind of drained from the case, but he’d rather get back to the bunker and recuperate there.
w-w-wanna watch?”
"It's great to see, isn't it?" Castiel had been so lost in thought, he didn't notice Mary sitting down next to him.
When they’ve sat down to eat, Jack asks after
Cas sounds amused. “I can see that.” A thumb rubs at the back of Dean's neck and Dean sighs. He just wants to go back to sleep, but now that he's more awake he’s becoming aware of how bad his mouth tastes, that he needs to take a piss, and that he's
When he'd started talking, Dean had lifted his hand a little to glare at Cas defiantly. It wasn't very impressive with his eyes drawing moisture even in the dim lighting. Dean holds the glare for a moment but then his expression softens.
It makes Dean feel warm all over.
At some point, he can hear Sam talk with the doctor about which antibiotics are safe for Dean to take so they can prevent a lung infection. He falls asleep with a ventilator helping him breathe and then it’s gone when he wakes up.
After lunch the next day, Castiel is finally allowed to do some work again. There's research to be done for one of the hunters in Sam's network and Castiel relishes having something to do, even if he has to do it while tucked into bed.
Jack stares at him, and the next thing Dean knows the kid is clinging to him, pressing his snotty face into Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel thinks the grate looks quite finished already, but Dean sounds deeply unhappy and frustrated. He's stopped scrubbing and is blinking at the dirty water in the sink like he's not quite sure anymore what he's even doing.
"I don't want those. They're too warm."
“I c-c-can’t. I t-t-t-tried b-but I c-c-can’t. R-r-r-read. It d-doesn’t w-w-work a-a-an-n-ny-m-more.”
“You mentioned that you get why you and me—why Sam reacted the way he did and was then confused by his own reaction. And I’m not asking you to disclose private things that he’s told you, but I. I’d like to understand.”
His armpits smell okay but he gives them a quick wash anyway. He’s about to put the washcloth away when he hesitates.
“A picture of the sunrise Jack sent me when we were on that case in Colorado three weeks ago.”
“It’s alright, I can—I can talk about it, a little. ‘Bout nine years ago, when I still had my apartment, there was a break-in. Never even saw the intruder. Or I guess if I did, I can’t remember. He shot me in the head. Bullet’s still in there,” she says, tapping a finger against her temple. “Did some real damage. I can’t hunt anymore, can’t work. I lost my home. If I don’t get my meds every day, I’d die.”
"Yeah, wanna try?" Dean can see that Cas is about to refuse, so he picks up a cookie and holds it out to Cas with the best pleading look he can muster. "C’mon man, live a little."
“I’ll tell you later.”
It’s not that he’s cold, but he feels emotionally drained and in need of comfort. The blankets in the car aren’t as soft as the ones Dean keeps piling on his—their—bed, but it still helps a little. It hasn’t occurred to him before how used he has gotten to having Dean’s warmth near him.
Eventually, the pressure ebbs,and his heart rate calms down. But instead of feeling like there's a vice around his chest, he now feels a hollowness there. It builds and spreads until it seems to have reached every last part of his body.
The credits are rolling when there’s a knock on the doorframe.
Dean draws back, instantly awake again. “You what? W-w-why?”
Dean opens his mouth, then closes it again. Cas is not wrong; this could save them a lot of time and work tomorrow, maybe even save somebody’s life. But, “A-a-a-and if that fucker at-t-tacks you with no b-b-b-back-up, what then?”
“I’m never w-w-walking ag-g-gain. Anyw-w-where. I g-g-got my b-best girl t-to g-g-get me places, right B-B-Baby?”
They sit and watch the waves and the growing light in companionable silence. Dean must have felt a little cold—he’s wearing sweatpants and a hoodie that’s a little too big on him because it’s actually Castiel’s. It’s navy blue and very soft—one of the items that Dean insisted they get for cuddling time. Dean’s gotten into the habit of “stealing” it, though only after Castiel has worn it at least one time, something that he still doesn’t quite understand.
He’s off to dreamland shortly after and everything is nice until he wakes with a gasp and a racing heart from a nightmare slash flashback of that moment when Michael dragged him under, taking over control until all Dean knew was the black water he was drowning in. Only half-awake, he reaches out for Cas, and when his hand meets only empty air, he clutches the pillow in front of him until he’s calmed enough to sleep again.
“It doesn’t need to beat,” Castiel points out grumpily, but he deflates at the look Sam gives him. “I didn’t know I was out that long; it didn’t feel that way to me.”
tries to rise up. Instantly, Dean craves more,
Dean turns around to see Cas standing beside Baby. Dean had just walked past her, like she wasn’t even there. He instantly feels bad.
Instead of replying, Dean finds his hand and tugs on it.
“It’s okay,” Cas says, even though he too must know it’s not. “I shouldn’t have pushed.”
“Sh-sh-shoot.”
“Yeah, g-g-g-gimme a sec.” Dean's about to get up when Cas puts a hand on his chest and pushes him back down on the bed again.
anymore these days. Every time Cas touches him, it comes out, and he just can’t stop it.
Dean's fingers clench in the rag. He has to force his hands to keep moving like there's nothing amiss; rubbing the rag over them and the dirt even deeper into his skin.
Maybe now that they’re back home and there’s no rush, Cas will hear him. Maybe Dean can be really, really brave and pause the episode halfway through and tell Cas the rest of what he’d wanted to say.
“A-a-anglin’ for a New Year’s k-k-kiss, huh?”
Nodding mutely, Dean shuts his eyes and takes in a shuddery breath. He leans forward, initiating an embrace. Clinging to Castiel tightly, he asks, an edge of desperation to his voice, “Cas, you’re happy, right?”
it’s a kind offer, and that Eileen’s just trying to be nice. He doesn’t get why it makes him so angry. Not trusting himself to speak, he just shakes his head, jaw clenched.
Cas holds out the beer to Dean and he lights up.
sit-t-ting on your dick, Cas, quit a-a-acting like a virgin at prom ni-ni-night." Snatching Castiel's hands up, Dean plunges them under the water to rest on his belly where he intertwines their fingers.
Instead of replying right away, Sam hands him a piece of paper. "Rowena came through. We're still trying to get the dosage right so he doesn't build up a tolerance too fast. It's dulling the pain and helping him sleep."
Getting up on shaky legs, Dean digs through his drawer for a towel and after making sure the coast is clear, sneaks into the showers.
Dean?!”
Cas sets Dean’s backpack down. He turns his flashlight off and then reaches over and turns Dean’s off as well, only the glow sticks around their necks remaining to illuminate the space between them. Putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder, Cas steps close, and points upwards. Following the line of his finger, Dean finds one of the very few constellations he knows.
(looking around, smiling slightly)
Mornin’, sunshine.
Sam’s hand hovers around the wound, as if trying to cure it. Dean shakes his head. He doesn’t want to die, but he’s past the point of no return.
You’re not her. You
Dean turns on the car, smiles nostalgically, and flips on the radio. “HEY JUDE” by The Beatles begins to PLAY.
Dean kisses him. “Thank You” by Led Zeppelin resumes. Cas pulls him in, closer. It is a beautiful, tender kiss, a movie kiss.
(firmly, as if with all the power of Heaven on his side)
“Yeah, love you too.”
Scratch that about loving Bobby—Castiel has never hated anyone more. “Um.” His heart begins to thump inside his chest as he meets the gaze of the blond boy, the one with freckles. He quickly shifts his eyes to the grass. “My name is Castiel Novak. I moved here from San Francisco this summer. I don’t know what else to say.” He looks appealingly at Bobby.
be her. No one ever really comes back, no one that I— that I—
The tea dude leans forward, stirring the honey into his tea.
“Okay,
Sam looks up at Dean, an apologetic expression plastered on his face.
Cas nods, reassured by Sam’s gradually lightening tone.
INT. CASTIEL’S ROOM
Dean moves to sit on the bed, a respectful distance away from Castiel. He sets the plate and mug on the bedside table. Castiel shifts into a sitting position. Dean looks at Cas, and we think he is about to speak—
They walk back to camp, Castiel supporting Dean while Dean swears viciously and hobbles on his left leg. It doesn’t take that long, but to Castiel it feels like an eternity. Dean’s hand is warm and sweaty on his arm, and Castiel feels its imprint a long time after he leaves.
“What?” Castiel calls back, cautious and a little bit nervous. Dean doesn’t sound malicious or teasing—in fact, his face is neutral, absent of any cruelty.
I hope so, Bobby. I think so.
Castiel’s hands pause on his shoelace. He straightens, reluctantly meeting Dean’s gaze. “May I be of service?”
