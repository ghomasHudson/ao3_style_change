Despite the feelings of hopelessness, Dean stayed up all night aimlessly searching for information about the Empty. He normally tried to get out of doing research, but he couldn’t sleep without returning to his nightmares. He could feel his eyes drooping and his head beginning to get hazy, but he just kept endlessly scrolling through online message boards and random websites that were mostly full of complete bullshit.
Dean woke up in a cold sweat with a scream on the tip of his tongue that he just barely stopped from coming out. Once again, he’d dreamt about Cas being taken from him. The words Cas said ran through his head on an endless loop, tormenting him. Dean hated himself for how he’d frozen in the moment, for letting Cas die without ever telling him the truth. He wiped away the tears that were gathering in his eyes and looked at the clock on his nightstand table. It was nearly two in the afternoon and he had no interest in getting out of bed, even though he knew it would worry Sam.
” He could do this. He could keep moving on. Cas wouldn’t want him to fall apart. It almost felt like he was outside of his body as he forced himself to leave the room and head into the library, where Sam was buried in a mountain of books.
in a way that no kiss ever had before. It wasn’t just about feeling good; Cas was kissing him like he was something precious, something to be treasured. Cas knew who he was — knew the good and the bad, knew every dark and tattered part of him — and he loved him anyway.
“And it’s not like we’re leaving the life, not really,” Dean said. “We’ll always be there to help other hunters, maybe make things a little safer and more coordinated for everyone like you did when we had the apocalypse refugees here. We’ll always be a source for hunters who need help with research or supplies or training, and we can answer the phones when they need a cover.”
Hearing that Dean wanted to begin retiring into more of Bobby's position left him just as surprised as Sam and Eileen, but happy with the idea that they could avoid taking on all of the world’s problems themselves. He was beginning to understand that they earned a little bit of peace. Dean had been hunting since he was a child, and they had spent their entire lives being forced into tragedy after tragedy. Both brothers deserved something better, something that was their choice for once.
“Yeah… I don’t know,” Sam said with a frown. “We’re going to need to come up with something. Maybe we can make a deal with the Empty.”
room soon. He usually kept things tidy, not wanting to make his sanctuary a mess, but he had been allowing things to pile up since he'd lost Cas. There were dirty dishes he never bothered to put away, random research books and hastily scrawled notes that cluttered the floor, and bits of clothing thrown everywhere. After cleaning everything else and making his bed, he started shoving all of his clothes into the laundry basket.
Dean took Cas’s limp hand into his own and thought about how Cas had woken up the first time. Jack had managed to get through to him by praying to him, by wishing for his return. Dean’s prayers had gone completely unheeded from Earth, but they were in the Empty now. Cas was
Dean rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “I know you had sex with April and you kissed Meg, but I don’t know what… you really feel about… um, that part of romance. Is that—uh, when we kissed earlier, did you like that? Would you want to do, uh, more than that?”
Rage and guilt consumed him, and he punched the wall in frustration, piercing a hole in the only bedroom he’d ever known. He stared down at his bruised hand; the pain was almost comforting in the way that it momentarily distracted him from the pain he felt from losing the one person who could tear down his walls and make him feel something,
The Empty rolled its eyes as Cas remained lifeless on the ground. He knew the being’s patience wouldn’t last forever, but Dean didn’t want to rip out Cas’s grace and escape the Empty without knowing if Cas could ever wake up.
“I’m fine,” Dean grumbled as he sat up and stretched, feeling the ache in his body from falling asleep at the library table.
"I always have been yours. We've just been too busy being idiots." Cas mused as he allowed himself to pull Dean’s shirt off and move his hands over Dean’s skin, admiring his body in a way he’d never been able to before. They spent hours exploring each other’s bodies, and Dean could only hope that their room was sufficiently soundproofed to avoid Sam overhearing anything he shouldn’t. Sam might begin wishing
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but Sam found him slumped over his laptop the next day, and shook him awake.
Sam had been studying the bomb spell that Jack had used which woke everything up in the Empty, trying to figure out if there was anything in that spell that could hint at how to put the Empty back to sleep. Eileen was by his side most days, also helping with research. They signed half of the time they talked, and Dean couldn’t tell if it was just because Sam was getting better at signing or because they were talking about him behind his back. He felt like they were treating him like a bomb that was about to explode, and he supposed that he was.
Dean watched as Rowena and Sam painstakingly went through every aspect of the ritual and spell they'd done to turn Jack into a bomb. Sam explained to her what happened, how it had woken everyone up in the Empty, and how Jack began to suck up people's powers afterwards. Rowena took it all in with delight; it was clear that this was a kind of magic she hadn't seen before.
As he was making Cas’s sandwich, he started rambling. “You know, there’s a lot of food that’s better than PB&J. I’ll cook for you, whatever you want. I don’t know what you tried last time you were human, but I
"A peanut butter and jelly sandwich sounds great right now, actually,” Cas answered with a small smile.
to be more emotionally honest and to show Cas how he felt about him. Going through weeks of hearing Cas’s speech over and over again in his head, knowing that Cas had died thinking he didn’t love him, made him need to show Cas that he could be better. He was sure he’d slip sometimes, put up the walls that always made him hide his feelings, but he never wanted to make the mistake of letting Cas think he was unloved or just a tool to be used ever again. Cas had said he did everything for love. He still wasn’t sure that was true, but he was going to strive to be the person Cas believed he could be. After everything they’d gone through, Cas deserved that much.
Castiel couldn't help but smile and laugh softly at Dean asking the question so quickly. He rubbed the back of his neck. "Um...well, yes. That would make me very happy."
His voice was uncharacteristically shaky and cracked on the last word. He looked down at the floor to avoid the gazes of everyone else in the room as he felt his face redden, but he could feel the weight of their pitying stares on him as they watched him fall apart.
later. Now all he needed to focus on was getting Cas back. Dean’s heart pounded as they went through the ritual to open a portal to the Empty. He tapped his fingers against the crystal in his hands as Sam and Rowena chanted together until finally he saw the rift open.
Dean nodded and said, “Yeah, that’s...what I...I didn't know if you ever really…wanted that either. Even after you slept with April, it seemed more like an experiment to you. And you never sought it out again…"
He was too far gone that he didn't even notice Sam had entered the room until he felt a hand on his shoulder, the same shoulder Cas had branded when they first met, the same shoulder he'd touched before he died. He started shaking with tears even as he felt his brother pull him into his arms. He would normally push Sam away and tell him he was fine, but this time, he clung to him and let his brother rub his back.
to sleep. I don’t even know how you intend to get him out of the Empty, since I don’t think your little angel can make it out through that rift alive. But that’s not my problem. I brought you Castiel, now it’s
“We’re keeping the coat though, I hope you know,” Dean stated firmly. “Don’t care if we need to dry clean it to get the blood stain out.”
The Empty’s face looked calculating as it considered the offer. The background screams that Dean could barely hear in the void seemed to get louder, and Dean watched as the Empty’s irritation became increasingly more obvious. With a sigh, the Empty snapped his fingers and Cas appeared next to them, lying asleep on the ground, his face molded in a painful expression that Dean never wanted to see again.
“Hello, boys,” a familiar Scottish voice said a few seconds later. Dean turned around to see Rowena, standing there waiting with an unsurprised, but mildly irritated look on her face.
“Cas, I don’t know if you can hear me,” Dean prayed. “But I need you to wake up. I...have a lot I need to say to you, but right now, I just need you to hear me and open those big blue eyes. Can you do that for me?”
Dean slowly dragged himself out of bed and kneeled down on the floor. As he’d done for every day since they’d defeated Chuck, he tried in vain to pray that Jack would bring Cas back. He opened his eyes, hopeful that Jack would suddenly appear, but he knew he wasn’t coming. Jack had said he wasn’t going to meddle in the world anymore, and he wasn’t going to change his mind just because it was Dean asking. And why should he? Dean had said Jack wasn’t even family. This was his fault.
He looked down at his regular clothes and trenchcoat that he was still wearing. "I...might need some other clothes now that I'm human. I can sweat now. Angels don't perspire. And there’s all this blood I can’t vanish..."
where we need your help, Rowena. We know the spell that woke everyone up. We’re hoping you can take a look and see if you can come up with a spell to put everyone back to sleep,” Sam said.
“We’ll get you a whole new wardrobe. Whatever you need. But you can always borrow any of my clothes. I uh—I think I might like that,” Dean said. “You’re probably not all that comfortable in that suit and trenchcoat now that you’re human. It’s not exactly the most comfy outfit ever. Especially for just sitting around the house.”
As soon as he was done cooking, he piled the bacon, eggs, and toast on everyone’s plates and then moved them over to the table, taking the seat next to Cas for himself and scooting their chairs closer until their knees were touching. Before even touching his own food, he kept his eyes on Cas, wanting to see how he reacted to eating the breakfast as a human.
Dean squinted. “You mean we could remove his grace. I don’t know if he’d want that. He felt...lost as a human.”
he feels from having his cock out in a public place is damn near enough to make him come here and now. He must make some involuntarily sound when he wraps his fist around his cock, because the couple fucking both turn towards him and he feels desire hit him like a bolt of lightning when their eyes drop to his dick.
a monster!” Liam says, clearly not bothered by it at all. He curls his fingers into what must be claws, and shouts, “ROAR!”
“Good.” They’re both quiet for a little while, and Cas is so still he thought Cas was falling back asleep, but he jerks suddenly and breaks the silence between them with what sounds like a life-changing revelation. “I’m in heat!”
Liam says, surprising him again with the boldness of the comment. “You can still play if you want to.”
“Didn’t think I was gonna let you off the hook just because your boyfriend’s here, did ya?” Bobby asks.
“Okay,” Castiel agrees. “I’d like to shower while you’re gone, so take my keys with you in case I don’t hear you try to get back in.”
He wants to believe him, he does. But Cas doesn’t know his dad the way he does. He doesn’t know how far The King is willing to go in order to ensure a Winchester baby comes out of this marriage. “But—”
They’re quiet for a second or two, but once they figure the coast is clear, they look at each other and both instantly dissolve into laughter. He leans in for a kiss, but Castiel pushes him away, still laughing. “Go shower. I’m not having Bobby on my bad side.”
“My head does kind of hurt now that I can breathe,” Cas admits, and Jess snorts outright with laughter this time.
Cas disappears into the house, likely to find Kevin and give him his prize, and Dean is left standing there with his face hot and not nearly enough alcohol in his system. He sets out to remedy that, and somehow gets roped into several rounds of shots with Sam, Jess, and eventually Cas. He only participates in the first two because he doesn't want to drink
certainly doesn’t fit anymore, but he doesn’t know what other term Cas would be comfortable with, so he just leaves it as it is.
that. He likes a nice-smelling omega as much as the next guy, but he freakin’ loves that Cas smells as unique as he does, that his cool scent matches the unbelievable blue of his eyes, that Dean would be able to catch the faintest whiff of his scent anywhere and know without a sliver of a doubt that it’s Cas. Just today he’s already become familiar with the intricacies of his scent—the tang of stress, the refreshing hint of happiness, and the clean, unflawed essence of all of it currently streaming from under the bathroom door—and he’s eager to learn even more.
Castiel looks at the window, then at the huge, dark wood, four poster bed that takes up most of the room. “But your guards,” Castiel protests.
He stops when Ellen comes back with a tray of five shots. He looks up at her questioningly, knowing she knows that five shots plus three beer will have him crawling home, and she throws her head back and laughs. “Two’re for your boyfriend, sweet cheeks. You didn’t think I was gonna let you spill your guts when the city boy gets to keep his dignity, didja?”
He doesn’t know what Cas likes, but he figured he'd probably be safe with a breakfast spread, so he pops it in the oven to keep it warm and then goes to put Grace’s newly folded clothes and blankets away in the nursery. Once that’s dealt with, he goes to take a break back in the living room. Grace is
Feeling confident about his appearance and everything to do with him and Cas, he goes out into the kitchen to start some breakfast, but he catches a whiff of eggs and finds Cas already at the stove.
nightmares,” Dean jokes, and to his relief, Liam laughs, loud and uninhibited. “This is a no baby zone.”
Castiel keens suddenly, and for one heart-stopping moment he thinks Castiel has reached his orgasm, but instead, Dean’s pushed gently until he rolls onto his back. Castiel fills the open vee of his legs but stays up on his knees, keeping their groins apart. Castiel’s eyes are bright blue, not quite glowing but almost, and with his flushed cheeks, kiss-swollen lips, and bed head sticking up haphazardly, he looks so sexy Dean can hardly believe he gets to be the one in bed with this man hovering over him.
He leads Dean a few aisles away, closer to the front of the store. Children who come in with their parents are always drawn to them, so because they’re an easy sell, he makes sure to keep them in the open. Most of them aren’t worth more than ten dollars, so Castiel has a little basket of them that he gestures to now.
He’s still not really sure where things stand between them, and because of it, he doesn’t know how to react when Cas trails a hand along his lower back. His jaw unclenches when Cas presses a chaste kiss to it, and he’s blushing furiously when Cas pats down his flank with his big hand. He’s torn somewhere between embarrassed and pleased about how easy it is for Cas to soothe him with his touch, and he feels his shoulders relax slightly knowing that Cas is trying to calm him down even when they’re still fighting. Cas must really care about him.
“Thank you,” Castiel says earnestly. “I made it myself. I thought it was appropriate for work since today’s the day I’m switching out the fall decorations for Halloween ones.”
Dean looks up at the clock. “You’ve got almost two hours until they spring you outta this joint. You can nap, if you want.”
Castiel nods and runs his hand through his hair, which is when Dean notices how part of his hair is flat from his hat and other parts are sticking up wildly. It takes a lot to keep a straight face, but he manages. “I haven’t had a full night’s sleep yet, but I’m hopeful about tonight.”
The last thing he needs is for his mom to talk about how late he sleeps in on the weekends in front of the guy who hasn’t slept more than a few hours at a time in
Cas smiles, then picks up his coffee and takes a sip. He makes a quiet sound of surprise in his throat, then swallows and looks back at Dean like he just saved a kitten from a house fire. “You remembered how I like my coffee.”
to fall for Cas and he hates that idea, so he pushes it down and concentrates on how happy Cas looks instead—how happy Cas is gonna be when he tells him he loves him for the first time. Hell, it won’t even just be the first time for
“Really?” He lifts his eyebrows at the new information, and she confirms with a shake of her head. “Well you fake it a lot better than I do.”
“I’m not doing it for you, I’m doing it for me,” Sam says, already walking in the opposite direction down the hallway.
It’s a bizarre feeling to walk into a crematorium and come out with the remains of a person you used to love in an urn that fits comfortably in your hand. Everything Lisa ever was is reduced to a pile of ash, and maybe because he can’t quite wrap his head around it, it turns out it’s not upsetting for him at all. This is Lisa’s body burned down to ashes sitting strapped into the passenger seat in Baby (he didn’t want the urn to fall over), but he doesn’t really feel like it’s her. How could her smile be in that urn? Her laugh? The sleepy smile when they’d wake up all tangled together mid-morning after a night out together? It’s not really her, it’s just what’s left of her, and for reasons he can’t even explain to himself, it doesn’t bother him all that much.
“You are so sweet in your own way. I won’t tell anyone!” he says before Dean can protest. “But I love that about you.”
“For sex toys, right? Kidding! But Dean?” Dean waits, and she says, “I don’t think exes can be friends if they still have feelings for each other, but I do think some people are meant to be together. Think about it.”
“We've come to the point of your ceremony where you're going to say your vows to one another. But before you do that, I ask you to remember that love—which is rooted in faith, trust, and acceptance—will be the foundation of an abiding and deepening relationship between you. No other ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred than those you now assume.” Castiel squeezes his hands again, his thumbs caressing the backs of them, and Dean smiles shakily. “If you are able to keep the vows you take here today, not because of any religious or civic law, but out of a desire to love and be loved by another person fully, without limitation, then your life will have joy, and the kingdom you will someday rule will be a place in which you both will find the direction of your growth, your freedom, and your responsibility. Prince Dean, please now recite your vows to your chosen one.”
Sam shakes his head in clear disbelief. “You can’t see what you look like when you’re together. You’re
He considers lying for a split second before he remembers how bad things went the last time he lied to Dean. “I’m nervous. I’ve never showered with somebody before.” His face is burning when he admits, “I don’t know what to do.”
Because Castiel agrees, he says, “I really can’t even begin to tell you how much this means to me. How much it means to us,” he corrects, slipping his hand into Dean’s. “We’ve been so happy here since we moved in, and to know that all of you are willing to put your necks on the line just so we can keep that is... truly above and beyond anything we ever would have asked for.”
Maybe he will be once they get started, but the only thing he can feel right now is arousal. “No. I’m good.” He shudders in Castiel’s arms when he hears the click of the bottle, anticipation coiling low in his stomach. Considering he had no idea what this even felt like this time yesterday, it’s amazing how badly he wants to have Cas moving inside of him again already.
Unfortunately, the reminder of his grace doing more than they thought it could brings reality crashing down on him. They’ve both been careful not to mention it since they left their bedroom for the reception, but Castiel’s dad is still locked in the dungeons and they have no idea why he attempted to kill The King of the Hunters or what’s going to happen to him now that he has. He feels Castiel’s previously relaxed body tense, and he knows he’s thinking the same thing.
They’ve reached the throne room now, though, so Dean says, “Yeah. Until now. Do you know anything about what’s waiting for us in there?”
“Gross!” Liam exclaims, and Dean scoops him right up off of the ground and turns him upside down, getting a loud shriek of excitement. He grabs his own granola bar off of the counter and carries Liam into the living room, bouncing him and making Liam laugh so hard he can hardly breathe by the time he tosses him carefully onto the couch. He’s barely even sitting down before Liam jumps into his lap, throwing his arms around his neck in an impromptu hug that melts his whole heart.
Dean grins back, a little wobblier than he was a second ago. “Always knew you’d be a bad influence on me.”
“Cas was just asking me for a blowie in the bathroom,” Dean lies. It’s worth it to hear Jess laugh so loud and to see Cas’s jaw drop, and even worth the backhand he gets across his chest from Cas.
Lights explode behind his closed lids, his stomach does flip flops, and his mind is spinning twice as fast as it was from the alcohol. He can hardly process anything at all, but at the same time, everything is so overwhelming that he can’t even think.
Cas.” Cas has stretched him so damn good that all three incredibly thick fingers are sliding in and out easily, and Dean’s surprised to find he wants to feel the stretch again. He wants to feel
“You can be a clown if you want to, but that means no great big candy bars from me if you do,” Sam threatens.
“She loved him so much,” Cas says next, still quietly enough that Liam won’t be able to hear him. “I mean, I knew it all along, but reading it was—really hard. I can’t imagine knowing that you’re running out of time with your own child.”
one,” Dean replies. “Though she is nice and shiny.” As they walk into the garage, Dean says, “Liam, this is Baby. Baby, Liam.”
Dean has a tiny smile on his face as he stretches his legs out. He has one leg about to rest on the coffee table when he stops and looks over at Cas. “Can I put my feet up?”
The tension he’s so desperately trying to hold on to is causing his extremities to shake, his muscles to tense, and his skin to burn—and it
likes it (windswept, like he just got in from a fast ride with Baby) instead of how the hairdresser did it, he deems himself officially ready to meet his bride-to-be.
They’ve made it down two aisles when Cas catches his eye and gestures behind him to where the woman is. Dean nods, letting Cas know he’s aware, and from then on, the fun trip to the store that started out as something they could do as a family now feels strained and uncomfortable.
“You wish. Let’s go,” Dean says, getting to his feet and leading the way towards the hallway where the girls had disappeared to. They don’t get far before they’re stopped by a short but slimy looking guy wearing an all-black suit.
Dean sighs heavily, mostly for show, while he tries to think of which song he should play for Cas. “She writes the best break-up songs, and a few of them are some of the saddest songs I’ve ever heard, so not exactly something that makes me think of you. But uh,” he pauses, puts his fingers on the fretboard, and plays the first chord. “This one’s sorta romantic. It’s called ‘Lover.’”
Castiel huffs a laugh. He appreciates the sentiment, but he’s well aware that Dean must have had plenty of more exciting sexual encounters. “I’m sure.”
“My dad,” Dean says quietly. “He didn’t want me to like guys, so I knew I couldn’t really date any without it inevitably leading to the ‘I want to meet your dad’ conversation.”
“I understand,” Cas says quietly. Then he startles him when he bursts out with, “Wait! Your leftovers!” Cas hops up off of the couch and dashes into the kitchen, coming back with the container in his hands and his dick tenting his pants so obviously Dean can feel his mouth fill with saliva. “Here.”
His feet carry him inside of his favorite pizza joint. His lips quirk into a tiny smile when he sees the woman behind the counter. Jo. A fellow alpha. With her long blonde hair pulled back in a sleek tail, her big brown eyes, and her sly smile, she’s absolutely beautiful. She’s a little rough around the edges, and honestly, she scares him a little, but then again, most people do. There’s still something about her that he likes, though.
Cas sighs heavily, somehow managing to roll his eyes and smile as big as Dean’s ever seen him at the same time. “You’re going to be
“Yeah,” Dean answers, voice gruff. The man picks up his spoon, then leans in over his bowl, which is a good thing considering how badly his hand is shaking. “You sick, or just hungry?” Dean hears himself ask.
“You didn’t,” Dean tells him honestly. “No harm done from pushing at the friend line a little. I just really hope you don’t hate me for it in the morning.”
“Fffuck,” Cas whispers hoarsely, grappling uselessly at his back and rolling his mouth watering hips to fully ride against Dean’s crotch.
They keep right on kissing as Castiel’s hands drop to his ass, groping and squeezing as he pushes their groins together again and again. Dean feels Cas growing hard against him, and it has the same effect on him, causing his erection to fill out more and more every time they brush together. Cas lets out short little humming sounds whenever they line up just right, and between Cas's low voice filling his ears, the hands kneading his ass, and the cock pressed up against him, Dean’s head is already spinning.
“Well, I suppose it’s a good thing I’m used to Gabriel, then. I’m almost certain it’s impossible to be more crass than he is,” Castiel says. “Besides, I’m more than happy to pour. This is a lovely tea set.”
of watching his omega walk out of the bedroom completely naked. He has to wait until he hears the water going before he trusts himself enough to get up and
“Bold of you to assume we’ll make it to a mattress with thighs like that,” Dean replies, smiling seductively. “I’ll follow you.”
Cas lets Dean pull the door open, and he smiles nice and wide when he sees it’s Donna and Liam. “Hey guys, come on in,” he says happily.
It’s foolish, he realizes now, but he never really thought about the possibility. He knows on some level that relationships don’t always work out, that he’s not even Dean’s boyfriend yet and he might not even get that far, but he never considered that he could lose this just as fast as he found it. He never saw Dean coming. He was content and comfortable with his life before Dean walked into his store and upended everything, but now that he’s experienced actual happiness — now that he’s laughed and snuggled and kissed and fooled around with Dean — he knows there’s no going back to being content without it.
Sam calls right as he’s about to start his lunch hour and he declines the call because the last thing he needs right now is a lecture, but once he settles into a comfortable corner in the carpeted living room and reaches into his lunch bag, he finds it hard to stay mad.
Dean’s laugh is surprised out of him, a low belly laugh that echoes in their bedroom. “Only because you say so, huh?”
“You should probably stick it in one of those little pockets in the front so it doesn’t disappear on you again,” Dean suggests.
“Apparently he and Cas are distant cousins, but they never saw each other until Gabriel moved here a few years ago. He owns the bakery now, and he does photography on the side. He flirts with
“You kind of stole my thunder by giving me that big speech a few minutes ago and casually letting it slip that you want to spend the rest of your life with me, but it also took a lot of the pressure off,” Cas says with a smile. He takes Dean’s hand in his and sounds completely genuine when he says, “I only waited to tell you about my interview because it was the one thing I had left on my mental checklist of things I wanted to do before I could ask you to marry me.”
and apparently all it’s going to take is one look for Dean to accept some tea after all. “I guess that wouldn’t make me much of a host,” he says begrudgingly, and for the first time, he thinks he sees a hint of a smile around Castiel’s mouth. It makes him look about a hundred times more friendly, and he’s absolutely positive he’s never wanted to see a full smile more. Distracted by his thoughts, he slips back into the way he usually talks. “Want me to pour or whatever?” Gabriel snorts a laugh and Dean winces at his mistake before he decides to just own it. “Full disclosure, Your Highness, I can fake it well enough on occasion, but the truth is, my etiquette lessons never really stuck either.”
Dean laughs a little at the nickname, knowing his face is red and blotchy from crying. “I know I look like shit when I cry. And I’ll be fine.”
Cas’s hands have shifted until he’s pushing Dean’s shirt up, distracting him with the sensation of fingers drifting over his newly bared skin. “You’ve barely even looked at me in five days,” Cas says, nudging his chin up to suck briefly just below his Adam’s apple. He feels hot, wet kisses pressed to the hollow of his throat, and after Cas pushes his shirt up and over his head, on his bare shoulder and collarbone. “How do you touch somebody who won’t look at you?”
“I got chocolate!” Jack says, jarring Dean out of his thoughts with the excitement in his voice. “Can I go to the next house?”
“Awesome. Listen, I hate to cut this short but I gotta get back to work. I’ll be checking my phone for those pictures, though,” Dean says. “If I don’t hear from you, I’ll see you Saturday, okay?”
He’s surprised by the bold statement because they haven’t talked about that at all since Jess mentioned it the day it happened. “I’m not against the idea, but don’t you think it might help jump start your career for people to think the handsome face singing to them is available?”
Cas chuckles, nodding knowingly, and Dean thinks that’s going to be the end of this crazy conversation, but then Cas’s laughter stops and suddenly he’s being looked at in the kind of way he’s always sorta dreamed about Cas looking at him but never thought it would actually happen.
Dean drops his gaze and for a few seconds, Cas wonders how badly he’s stuck his foot in his mouth. Here’s Dean, trying to make a grand gesture the way all the romance movies and books and pop culture has taught him to, and Cas is basically telling him it wasn’t good enough.
“I know you will,” Castiel answers, not an ounce of doubt in his body, mind, or heart. “Make love to me, Dean.”
It whispers of promises that are insane to think let alone voice on a third date, but maybe his life of solitude has made him crazy after all because he would swear he can feel them in the brush of Dean’s fingers on his cheek and the slow, worshiping way Dean’s lips are clinging to his.
Dean shakes his head, but turns his attention back down to Grace. “We should work on that, shouldn’t we, Grace?”
“Smooth,” Dean quips, amused at the Cas-speak even at a time like this, and Cas shoots daggers at him with his eyes.
“Basically, dad told me regardless if I’m gay or not, a Winchester was going to marry into the LOA.” He waits to let that sink in for a second, then finishes with, “And he didn’t really care which one.”
He tries not to stare at the way Cas’s long, thick fingers dwarf the tiny shot glass even more than usual, but he fails miserably, and he doesn't even attempt to look away from how Cas’s pink lips wrap sinfully around the mouth of the glass. He can feel the heat from his cheeks seeping down his neck to his chest, and despite knowing that he really shouldn’t take another shot so quickly, his throat is bone fucking dry and so he knocks back another one anyway.
Dean laughs, and in the very next breath, he starts to sing the song Castiel has heard in his head more than any other song, hands down.
“Nope, not for another month. Just got this itch under my skin I can’t shake. Like I’m supposed to be doing something that I can’t remember for the life of me.”
Maybe he’ll tackle the kitchen cupboards this weekend. At least he can mostly sit while he strips them. He cracks a beer before bed, then showers away the layer of sweat and sawdust that always seems to cling to his skin. He considers rubbing one out while he’s in there, but he’s craving some visual stimulation, so after a visit to PornHub and some old fashioned man on man porn, he falls asleep feeling completely satisfied with his vibrator, his house, and his job, trying desperately to ignore how he feels almost unbearably lonely about the space next to him in bed that’s always fucking empty.
the head of his cock is squeezed tight between Dean’s cheeks before he drives his whole length inside of him over and over, letting Dean feel the stretch of every inch before he nails his prostate and pulls out again.
“Don’t forget your lunch,” Cas says, stepping away to pull open the fridge and hand him a brown bag.
Dean places a smacking kiss to his lips and rolls out of bed, walking over to where his duffle bag is on the floor. Castiel rolls over onto his side to watch Dean’s drool-worthy bare ass as he bends over, absentmindedly stroking himself as he admires Dean’s bow legs and the flexing muscles in Dean’s back. He truly hit the jackpot with Dean in every way, but his body type is something pulled right out of Castiel’s dirtiest dreams. Even knowing that he just had all of that impossibly perfect freckled skin and firm muscle laid out on top of him and
and it’s like a drug. Like a shock to his system, to his memory, and the most primal part of him wakes with a roar to claim what should only be
Dean’s smile grows even bigger. “He’s gonna get one look at you and be terrified of the giant in the family.”
Dean’s head whips around to glare at him. “No.” Dean says it like he knows exactly what Cas’s response is going to be if he says yes, which makes Cas grin nice and wide. “We’re gonna be fancy and all romantic and shit—”
His breath feels like it’s stuck in his lungs, his cock is swollen and thick with his arousal, and each and every stroke, every piston of his hips into the curl of his fingers, brings him closer and closer to the edge. The hand on his chest drops between his legs to cradle his testicles, the extra stimulation drawing a low, long moan from his throat. He rolls them in his palm as he continues to fuck his fist, the sex-slickened noises echoing off the walls in harmony with his own heaving pants. The fantasy of Dean whispers sweet nothings into his ear, and combined with the memory of Dean’s nose sliding along his skin and the shiver it produced, he feels his insides clench and his muscles tense.
And yet here he is, so fucking gone on Cas already that the self-preservation part of his brain has completely left the building all just so that he can spend more time with him. Even the sound of Cas’s voice coming through the speaker to buzz him inside made him feel a little better about his day, lying to Sam and Jess, and the fact that he’s nervous as hell to play for him again tonight.
Cas kisses the bend of his shoulder. “In a few more months, I’ll be there to make sure nobody raises a hand to you ever again.”
Dean groans, surprises him with a sharper thrust with more power behind it, and he calls out as pleasure shoots through him like lightning. “Again!” Dean pounds into him, driving him closer and closer, goading Castiel with strong hands on his ass to match his faster pace. Pleasure spikes, sharp and darkly alluring.
That surprises him, but in a good way. It’s not quite dark yet, but he knows it will be shortly, and he’s definitely not against stretching out their date long enough to wait for them. “That sounds nice.”
Cas’s voice pulls him out of his thoughts, and he looks over at where Jess is holding up two different suit jackets. He forces everything out of his mind except for the wedding and tells her what he knows. “The one on the right with the shawl lapels are the most formal you can get, so if you’re stuck on the black tie thing, I’d go with that.”
Dean fakes a look of surprise. “Wow, Cas, I’m impressed.” Cas just shakes his head gently, letting him know Cas is onto him being disingenuous. “This is called Free Fallin’, and it’s one of the first songs I learned how to play.”
It’s a necessity. I had to take over my dad’s toy store, and it would have been a disaster if I couldn’t repair the toys myself.
at least until I’m divorced,” Cas says. That’s news to him, but as out-of-nowhere as it feels to hear, it’s nice to actually have an explanation for why Cas hasn’t been trying to take things further, too. “But I don’t even know if that’s really it.”
Dean chuckles and smiles up at Ellen, who’s watching the pair of them with a shrewd eye. “What?” he asks her.
Because he knows Dean still carries guilt for what happened the day he first found out they’re soulmates and that a part of his sweet soulmate probably always will, it settles something inside of him. It reminds him that this isn’t only sex, but love and intimacy and something special he’s held onto for so long
“I just came from the chapel, and everything looks lovely. The chapel is already full, and it seems like the whole kingdom is crowded around it,” she tells him. “I’ve never seen such a large turn out for a royal wedding.”
He knows exactly what his parents would have wanted him to wear, so even though he always feels a little bit like Peter Pan in this outfit, he puts on a long, emerald green, velvet shirt. It has a v-neck, golden stitching, and a matching loose-knit, decorative golden scarf that he wears over his shoulder and ties like a sash.
Cas waits for Hannah to turn all the way away, and then he squeezes Dean’s hand as hard as he possibly can.
“I’ll get Cas to go get it,” Dean decides. “Hey, uh, what exactly is he supposed to be lookin’ for? I’m sorta new at the whole car seat thing but there’s different ones for different sized kids, right?”
For once in his life he lets his lover move him just how Dean wants him, lets his body rock into the steady pounding his alpha is giving him, letting go and trusting that Dean will give as much pleasure as he takes from Castiel’s willing body. He’s completely malleable in Dean’s hands, matching the pace Dean wants, agreeing to every dirty word Dean utters between thrusts, and baring his neck for Dean’s mouth to do whatever he pleases, but the first time Dean plunges in deep and grinds his knot against Castiel’s soaked opening, Castiel
“Wow, are you sure it’s not you and Eileen who are related, Dean?” Cas says as he walks in from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee in his hands. He places them on the coffee table, then takes his seat as Sam and Eileen both chuckle.
Castiel is smoothing out some kind of fabric runner along the length of the ledge around his desk. “You didn’t hear it from me,” Castiel replies with a horrible attempt at a wink that only endears Dean further to the nerdy guy.
Cas lifts his head just enough so that they can see each other’s faces, and even before Cas says anything, Dean can see it in his eyes. All of the love he could have ever hoped for and so much more he never could have predicted gazing back at him from his favorite shade of blue.
He nods, but Cas’s words have caused a weird sinking feeling in his stomach because now that he’s finally given into the idea that he
It feels like it lasts and lasts, like each wave of pressure is stronger and more powerful than the one before it until finally it begins to ebb away. His head is spinning and his hearing is fuzzy, but they clear just in time to appreciate Dean’s face pressed into the curve of his neck where Dean shudders and grunts his way through his own orgasm.
He’s trembling everywhere at once, his body shaking from the combination of his hands holding himself up and the restraint it’s taking to hold himself back, and he stutters, “C-condom.”
“I feel fine. You only get one wedding day, and I think we can all agree there’s been too many interruptions already.” When he opens his mouth to argue again, John continues, “The whole kingdom is out there waiting to celebrate with you. We can’t disappoint our people.”
You might have noticed the “dubious consent” tag. It’s the first time I’ve ever used it. Personally, I don’t think it’s warranted, but a single chapter got some varying comments, so I added it just to be safe. There is a warning ahead of the chapter in question, so please don’t skip the whole story for that one scene. I really think this one is worth reading.
Less than two weeks later, Dean, Sam, and Cas are standing just inside the front door of The Winchester house at the ungodly hour of five in the morning, waiting for the car that’s coming to pick up Dean to take him to the airport. It’s way too early to do more than stand there with Dean’s back to his front and his arms around Dean’s middle while they wait, and while it’s more affectionate than they typically are in front of other people, Sam doesn’t make fun of them for it today.
“No, I agree, but for a man to respond to a photo of an attractive woman with an emoji meant to be a penis? Who would do that?”
He glances around at the forest green comforter spread over his king size bed, the dark brown faux-leather headboard and matching dark wood nightstands on either side of it with large white lamps on each. He watches as Cas takes in the two art prints he has—one of a mountain he liked peeking out of the clouds and one of a dock surrounded by a random body of water that reminds him of fishing with his dad—both with wide, white frames to brighten up the room. Not that it needs a lot of brightening up with the huge picture window looking over his backyard, complete with a window seat and big, plush cream colored cushions, but he likes the look of them anyway.
The words slip out before he can stop them. His nose is already pressed to the inch of skin directly next to Dean’s scent gland as it is, so he’s not sure why the desire to officially scent Dean is as strong as it is, but it’s almost as if his body is craving
“I’m not interrupting anything, am I?” Eileen asks as she crosses the living room. “Because I’d be more than happy to go back upstairs if you wanna pick up where you left off.”
He snorts a laugh at his own thoughts because he’s been half-hard all fucking day in anticipation and there’s no way he’s not gonna want to get off if given half the chance, even if it is some old perv watching him. It’s that thought that has him climbing out from behind the wheel of his 1967 Impala and strutting with his bowlegged gait to the front door.
His heart sinks like a stone and he fucking hates the way bile rises in his throat between one second and the next, but the sight of the flag that made him so unbelievably happy yesterday looking like a war zone is such a shock to his system that the coffee mug falls to the ground with a thud and a splash.
Dean’s tongue meets his with a groan that travels directly to Cas’s cock, and he hauls Dean into his lap just to have him closer still. Dean never breaks the seal of their lips as he swings his leg over Cas’s hips and lowers himself down so they’re pressed together where two swelling erections fill out more and more rapidly the more they come into contact. It’s been
“Fine. But good luck getting your jollies by feeling me up with the mesh panel of chastity in the way.”
This is probably Dean’s first time here, just like it is his, which means Dean really must be doing all of this just to romance him. It’s the sweetest, most adorably misguided attempt at winning his heart Cas has ever had to withstand, and he resolves to make this night as bearable as humanly possible for them both.
Meg arches one perfectly shaped brow. “Well, I’ll tell you what. For the birthday boy, me and Chastity will dance for you both privately - two for the price of one - as long as blue eyes comes along.”
One of the hands on Castiel’s hips slips around to palm over the erection Castiel is surprised to find he has while standing in his daughter’s nursery. Dean murmurs, “Fuck, you’re perfect.”
“I want this to hold onto,” Dean finishes. “To have the memory of how your hands have brought me more pleasure than I could have dreamed. I want—I want my first time to be
“Yeah, sure,” Dean huffs. “Ask literally any woman how she feels about bras and then try that on me again.”
“We’re partners,” Cas says easily, lifting his hand to lovingly cup Dean’s face. “I’m happy to pick up the slack when I need to. I want you happy, Dean, and I know you’re not happy when you have to be away from us more than usual.”
“I remember,” Dean says. Cas seems surprised by that, so he explains, “People don’t really say that kinda thing about me. Other than my mom,” he adds, which gets a low, drawn-out laugh from Cas.
He’s not sure how he feels about that, but seeing as there’s nothing else he can do about it now, he turns towards Ellen and Jo.
The conversation kind of stills at that point, though it’s not surprising seeing as Bobby was always a man of very few words. It’s not uncomfortable either, sitting there in silence with someone he used to look up to as a father figure. It’s nice.
“I think you do, ‘cause you’re really damn smart when you want to be,” Dean replies. “So I want you to take a seat at the dinner table and think about it for a second and see what you come up with.”
“I knew it was risky before coffee,” Cas admits, and Dean kisses him again just for knowing that. “But I couldn’t wait another second. I’ve been wanting to ask for ages.”
“Cas,” Dean pleads. It’s quiet at first, but Cas’s teeth sink into his skin making his head spin, and it’s a little louder and a little more desperate the next time. “Fuck,
Liam comes running over with his tablet in his hand talking a mile a minute. “I’m watchin’ this—this—video about a guy who’s gonna put
It certainly helped me put some pieces together. I should probably warn you just in case that traditionally, I’m very, very bad at recognizing when I’m being flirted with.
Cas’s hips twitch feebly as he leaks onto Dean’s tongue until he’s completely spent, and even then Dean doesn’t want to stop sucking his softening cock. He keeps Cas in his mouth, suckling gently for every drop of liquid evidence of Cas’s pleasure he can get until Cas is whimpering and writhing with oversensitivity, and his hands finally push weakly at Dean’s shoulders to make him stop.
“Sure thing,” Dean says, grabbing his wallet out of his back pocket while he tells her his number, then passing his licence over. She jots down the information and returns his card, then he asks, “That’s it?”
“How about you go change into your pjs so you’re nice and comfy, and then we snuggle up with that blanket you love so much and watch some TV to get your mind off of whatever’s bugging you before bed?” he suggests.
It sounds so simple when Cas says it like that. By the time he’s done talking, something has definitely loosened in Dean’s chest, and he’s starting to feel more like he just had ridiculously good sex instead of...
“I have never had sexual intercourse,” Castiel says plainly. “But I am not so untouched as you were when we met, either.”
Castiel nods but knows he won’t be able to brush this off entirely until he finds out for sure. “You’re soulmates?”
He opens his eyes to look down at Dean—likely seeing how his jaw is clenched and how his chest is heaving with how overwhelmed he feels already—and smirks.
out loud, but the way Dean’s looking at him makes him think Dean will understand. “Maybe I didn’t want to be seen.”
“It’s actually bizarre how much he looks like both of you,” Sam says, looking between them. “He’s a perfect mix of you both.”
“I, uh, don’t know a whole lot about kids, but me and Cas went out and picked up some toys for you to play with if you wanna check them out?”
has him so horny he makes a high-pitched sound into Dean’s mouth, and he’s genuinely panting for breath by the time Dean pulls away to move his lips down the column of Castiel’s neck. Dean releases him enough for his feet to hit the floor, and then Dean’s fingers are tugging at the drawstring keeping Castiel’s pants up. They’re quickly shoved down to mid-thigh where they expose his leaking cock thanks to Castiel foregoing underwear once he got home. He tries to reciprocate by freeing Dean’s cock next, but his wrists are caught by Dean’s, and the next thing he knows, he’s being spun so that he’s facing the wall. Dean uses one big hand to pin both of Castiel’s wrists over his head, and when he’s trying to decide if he’s going to let Dean get away with manhandling him like this or not, he hears the sound of Dean’s fly being unzipped.
A sound of relief escapes Castiel, and he surprises Dean by dropping to his knees in front of him and pulling Dean in for a firm, heated kiss. Dean opens to him immediately, inhaling sharply when Castiel kisses him much more fiercely than he’s used to. There’s a desperate edge to the way Castiel licks into his mouth this time, letting him know the fear of the two of them not being together is hitting Castiel now the same way it has been eating at his own insides since last night. He gives himself over to the searing heat of it, to the bruising, claiming kiss that Castiel lays upon his lips, feeling Castiel’s wandering hands set fire to his thighs, his hips, and up his back where they grapple for purchase in his too-short hair.
Dean shrugs, not ashamed in the least. “Never really cared too much about it before, but I’m not gonna pretend I don’t like knowing I check all your boxes enough to literally make your eyes light up.”
A part of him wants to curl up and die by the time Cas’s finger on his lips stops his nervous babbling. “Funny your mouth is so affected now when it had no problems telling me what a pretty cock I had not too long ago.”
He can feel the heat of Cas’s body when he takes a step closer before he hears his response. When he looks down at him, Cas rests his hands on Dean’s chest, looks deep into his eyes, and breathes, “Mistletoe. Merry Christmas, Dean.”
“Feel free to use it anytime, for anything you might be interested in.” Dean’s lips part automatically, his skin buzzing with the chemistry between them. Is Cas really saying what he thinks he’s saying? Did he just give him his number for real? Cas blinks suddenly and shakes his head slightly, breaking the eye contact Dean had been subconsciously tethered to. “I’m so sorry. The timing couldn’t be any worse and I literally couldn’t pick a less appropriate time to... do
“Whatever,” Dean replies, putting his spoon down so he can drink his milk. “Guess I better get used to it.”
Castiel releases his hand to put his arm around him, and Dean feels his cheeks turn pink when Castiel’s lips brush his temple. “You’ll have to wait and see.”
“Wish I knew,” Dean responds honestly. “It’s just somethin’ about you, man. I never had that problem with anybody else.”
“I don’t think another grown man in costume is gonna help his case,” Dean says. Cas is still frowning though, so Dean knocks into his shoulder gently to get him to look at him. “He’s a good kid. People like him. Try not to worry so much.”
“I do, gorgeous. I do,” Cas croons, his low voice as smooth as honey for once. “You like when I’m a little bit rough, don’t you Dean?” Dean licks his lips in response to the way Cas’s voice is getting grittier, aware that he doesn’t really have to answer because Cas already knows. “You like thinking I’m stronger than you. That I could lift you up and fuck you against the wall if I wanted to.” Dean moans, nodding shamelessly, gasping when Cas’s fingers tighten just a little bit more around his wrists. “I’d do it if you wanted me to,” Cas tells him, his voice dropping into a whisper. “I’m powerless to say no to you. I’ll give you anything and everything you want.”
He might not know the kid very well yet and he has no idea if Liam’s his son or not, but it doesn’t seem to matter. He loves him just the same, and he’ll be here for him to provide for him or hug him or force him to eat healthy shit even though it’s gross for as long as Liam needs him.
Desperate to please his omega, to see and taste his sweet release again, he drills into him the same way again and again, feeling Dean’s walls clenching around him deliciously and dragging him closer and closer to the edge.
They both get to their feet at the same time, but before Cas can say anything, Dean pushes his guitar around to his back and takes Cas’s hand in his.
Dean seems genuinely confused by the question. “Because I don’t. I know I’m not great with the words or whatever, but I’ve slipped up with the other stuff, too. I’ve never done anything like buy you flowers or take you out for dinner before tonight.”
who they are, but if the best Halloween he’s had in years is any kind of indication of the other holidays coming up, they’re in for one hell of a year.
A few minutes later, they put their plan into action, and Dean is handing Castiel a fresh stack of sheets Castiel insists on putting on himself. He hovers in the doorway for a minute, feeling a lot weirder about somebody other than Sam staying in his place for the first time than he thought he would, but determined to shake it off.
knows the exact effects his low voice has on him, and for the first time since he left the house, Dean’s incredibly aware that he’s still wearing the lacy panties he was trying on when his phone rang. Actually, he’s a little
The self-deprecating sense of humor from a man that gorgeous is endearing, so he musters up his remaining courage and attempts to offer a wobbly smile when Dean
Cas hums as if he’s contemplating that, then decides, “Yeah. I’ll accept that. Unconventional sounds like me, doesn’t it?”
He keeps his tongue in the game the whole time, flicking the tip and pressing the whole of it up against Dean’s shaft as he slides him in and out of his mouth. Dean keeps making the most deliciously needy little noises, making him wonder what Dean will sound like when Castiel makes him come. Is Dean going to grunt like he’s lifting heavy weights, is he going to be one of those guys who tries to muffle the sound of pleasure on Castiel’s shoulder, or is he going to be Castiel’s personal favorite: a screamer?
“I never—” Cas’s eyes flick up to his, hopeful almost, and Dean’s extra careful to make sure he doesn’t say anything to hurt him more. “I never wanted that for you. I never wanted to hurt you.”
things that could happen to Liam in the change room. “You know how he runs everywhere.” Yeah, Dean’s
of his lips, and Dean knows he could do this forever. Savoring the taste of Cas, learning what makes his cock pulse and how to milk another bead of precum from him, making Cas feel as good as he should always feel.
Dean nods, exhaling shakily while he tries to find his balance between relieved and disappointed. Will it be enough if Cas
Their easy back and forth reminds him of his receptionist back home, and his smile grows as he considers doing something really, really stupid. “Have you ever worked in an office?”
It only takes a handful of thrusts until Dean’s matching Cas’s pace, rubbing both of their cocks together at the same time they fuck Cas’s fist again and again, and yeah, it’s been a while but there’s no fucking way it was ever like this. It’s
Cas rolls him onto his side and fits himself between his legs. Strong arms come around him to hold him together exactly the way he needs right now, and Cas’s voice is low and soothing in his ear. “You still with me, gorgeous?” All Dean can do is nod, but when Cas hums happily as he nuzzles behind his ear, he knows that was enough. He feels the blunt head of Cas’s cock kissing his hole and lets out a quiet sigh of pleasure, knowing he’s about to get filled just right.
