Sebastian raised the gun and pointed it at the soon-to-be-corpse. A firearm was a strange thing. Moran would have liked to talk with John about it, but he wasn't supposed to know he had shot the old cabbie. With one hand gripping the gun high on the back strap, the other pressed firmly against the exposed portion of the grip not covered by the first hand, with the index finger pressed hard underneath the trigger guard, how could it be that you actually held the life of a person in your hands? It was ridiculously easy. Firing a gun did not even require the skills of a sniper. Anyone could do it. By merely applying pressure to the trigger, you could take the life of the person in front of you. Sebastian had always thought it was a bit like magic. In better.
But he did not know them. They had to exist, for this felt like something every human on earth must have looked for since the dawn of time. But he, Sherlock, did not have them.
When he was done eating, John went to Sherlock and nuzzled the palm of his hand in thanks. Not expecting the gesture, Sherlock froze. He averted his gaze and so missed the suspicious look John shot him. The manul tapped on his thigh with his paw insistently until he turned back to him.
Sherlock froze and almost missed a note – almost. He blinked, then seemed to consider the different (and very varied) options that were being offered to him. It was extremely difficult, all the more so as he'd set up all this little romantic outdoors 'stroll' only for John's benefit. Even if the doctor himself had never realized it, Sherlock had deduced that 'sex out in the open' was definitely one of his fantasies, and since he still seemed a little upset about not having been able to touch Sherlock the previous night, the consulting detective just thought it would be a good idea to give him the opportunity. Yet here he was, poking his cheeks, pulling them gently, playing with his nose, his earlobes, his curls, tracing his chin and his eyebrows, stroking his lips, as if he were a nice wax figurine, a toy of some kind, and John a five year-old girl.
"Why is Whewell more useful than Hume?" John asks, and you can once again focus on what he is asking rather than feel awkward about his touch.
was much sexier," she dropped before leaving him on the pavement. Sherlock could not repress a smile.
He put some bank notes on the table, enough to pay for the both of them, and left. Outside it was warmer than he had expected, and he was hit by the smell of London. The smell of the street. It had been so long.
I had never intended to make this chapter so long. But considering this is the only chapter Lestrade gets for himself, I thought I shouldn't force myself to make it shorter just to fit the average chapter length. I hope you will enjoy reading it! Reviews are much appreciated ;)
Regardless of what Sherlock said, Victor had played a part in the way the consulting detective cut himself off from people and decided to focus on facts and facts alone. It was difficult for John to forgive him for that, even without taking the drugs into account.
When he woke up in a hospital bed on December 30, John had no idea he was in a hospital bed, nor that the date was December 30. He remembered vaguely having his stomach pumped out, but his brain just couldn't connect the dots and make sense out of it.
As he walks around, he takes in every detail, every little thing that he couldn't bear to see a few months ago. Now he craves them – he needs whatever can remind him of Sherlock, regardless of the pain it causes him.
For a moment Sherlock lies petrified by the intensity of this gaze. Then he fears whatever this might lead to – note to self, check on Google how to deal with a crying friend – and sits up abruptly, letting go of John's hand.
You jumped, barely dodging the giant's arm trying to catch you. Yo heard it. You truly heard it. John's voice.
But John hadn't said a word. He hadn't left, either. So Sherlock could only find one explanation: he must still be in shock. It must have been more hurtful than insulting. He must be more broken than indignant.
He found it adorable, but even if he loved seeing John vulnerable, he didn't want anyone else to see him being so.
Starting at the shoulder area, John spread his fingers and used his fingertips down his back in a raking motion, moving them alongside the spine where the nerves were most sensitive. Sherlock jolted but slackened just as soon, making obvious efforts to relax because it was what John had asked him to do. Smiling tenderly, his look somewhat pain-filled because he loved this man squirming under his touch so much it hurt, John altered the motion of his hands so that one went up one side of Sherlock's back while the other went down, kneading, palpating and raking rhythmically.
"Hum, John... Surely you must realize there is absolutely no way that I will ever let you lock me up in a room away from everybody's eyes?"
You wonder idly how come a room in a Bed & breakfast near Chicago can be noisier than one in Manhattan – you hear you brain mention vaguely something about the top floor and double glazing, but you're not paying much attention.
They stood there, facing each other, for a few dreadful seconds. Then the detective remarked dumbly:
"You're a very handsome baby, you know that? I mean it. I've seen plenty of babies at the clinic, so you can trust me."
"I thought you might want to do it, but the other way around. And if one day we both got into the mood, I didn't want us to... you know, give it up just because we didn't have the right things."
"Well, off you go, then. I can't come with you once you've gone through customs" she says, readjusting his jacket.
The only thing that made Irene feel better was how much Sherlock was suffering from all this; and, to a lesser extent, how she had succeeded in manipulating the Iceman and having him exactly where she wanted when she wanted. She did not feel any pleasure at Moran's suffering, though. She did not sympathize. She did not enjoy it. It was painful, but someone had to play that part, too, and Sebastian Moran was incredibly well-suited for it. He was a real player. With a good poker face.
? Soldier at heart, tough enough to put up with you and kill a man in cold blood to save your life, long-suffering and forgiving John... A strong man. Wasn't he? And what about you?
"Hello, there! I thought babies always cried and made a fuss when waking up, but there you are, just looking around."
, couldn't be used as a weapon against him, analyzing him, deconstructing him, like Mycroft's or Moriarty's. John intensified his gaze and breathed in deeply.
Glancing at your watch, you realize you're going to be late if you do not hurry. You jump to your feet and run up to your room to change – Mary likes red and green jumpers on you the best, you know, and presently you are wearing a blue one. Absentmindedly, you wonder if Sherlock had any preference at all as to your jumpers – more precisely, if there were any that he found less distasteful than others – then dismiss the thought as utterly stupid (as if Sherlock would have bothered with such useless musings).
Turning to Sherlock, he fell on his knees and wrapped his arms around him, stroking his head and neck feverishly.
John took a deep breath and entered the living-room. He froze. Sherlock was sitting, back to John, facing the windows and absorbed in the contemplation of an old battered hat that lay on the low table. It was snowing outside, and the room was grey and silent. John's heart clenched and he bit his lips as the loneliness radiating from the scene hit him. He felt the urge to run to Sherlock and hug him and say: "Merry Christmas!"
John smiled and kissed his way down to the area he was massaging, pressing his lips to the left hipbone, the coccyx, the right buttock, the left one... As he went back up again and traced the pelvic bone with kisses, his touch sent jolts of electricity throughout Sherlock's body at first, then shivers and waves of soft, gentle pleasure that went straight to his groin.
"That is a difficult situation, indeed. It must have been for you, too, to comfort her during a holiday that is supposed to be a happy time."
He closed his eyes as he started to circle his hips in a figure eight motion. Attempted to, anyway. Such coordination between the data he held and his own body had never been useful – for fighting, yes, running, jumping, ducking, certainly. But dancing?
. Even if coming back for the sandwich had been unexpectedly sweet of him, John still wished he'd answered his numerous texts.
Sherlock was walking, only draped in a sheet, white as a ghost roaming the barren land; a luminescent phantom in the dark. There were shrubs here and there, taking fantastic heights in the silver glow of the rain pierced by the moonlight.
Sherlock swiftly tripped John and brought him back down into his arms, pinning him to the ground before he could put any clothes on.
This was the sign that Moran had started the last act. The sign that everything had been set in motion.
Ethereal blue eyes widened in bafflement, unbelieving. Sherlock couldn't fathom why John would say such a thing without being subject to orgasmic release or lying limp in its afterglow.
It didn't seem to bother him that a manul arrived from God knows where was still in his living-room as he was about to try and take a nap. To be fair, said manul had a powerful death glare, but other than that didn't look very frightening. Sherlock curled on the couch, his back to the cat. It was so much like John, he thought. It snapped, but would eventually come back, of that he was absolutely certain. He wasn't sure how long it would take, though, and that was bad news for for his unoccupied mind that craved
, though. If anything, he was the one who had been forced to abandon people – three in particular. One especially. She shivered. John wouldn't have been stupid enough to kill himself for those exact reasons, would he?
. When she became pregnant, he said he would marry her only if she cut all ties – what kind of man asks that of the woman he loves, huh? But she did love him. And she accepted. So she left her country and everything she knew to have a life with him here, and then what? Then
"Some call me Kazimir. Then there's always the obvious, boring name– but I am rather reluctant to your using it."
"Nothing," Mycroft had said when Lestrade had asked him what he could possibly do. "You have to let him overcome this himself."
? Worried? Oh God, don't tell me this is some psychological inversion and that I'll have to deal with Big Brother from now on. Because I'm not putting up with his crap."
"Oh... Sorry, I just assumed... It's just, I didn't really know him, but we did meet a couple of times. He just didn't strike me as the suicidal type. But, yeah, how would I know..."
John's retelling was definitely far from the truth as far as the man's thoughts and feelings were concerned. Just like that post for "A Study in Pink" where he'd claimed that he found terrifying the thought of someone being able to hold power on the life and death of someone else. At this Jim had burst out laughing. John was quite funny, for a doctor! Really... considering he'd been the killer at the time, that was very funny.
Molly sent him her most dazzling smile and he fell quiet. Sherlock had been right all along. The blond hair
He turned on his heels and marched back to the kitchen. If Sherlock wanted to sulk all day, then so be it. He certainly wasn't going to worry. What he done anyway? He'd told Sherlock he didn't want to have sex with him – a lie, admittedly. But couldn't Sherlock
For a moment, she seems to think you're joking, then you can actually see doubt dawn on her, and she frowns.
"I'm sorry. It's not your fault if you're like this," she amended. "As you said, John is your only friend, and I understand you'd be rather possessive and inconsiderate, but..."
Lestrade. It wasn't the first time he'd snapped at the man. So why had John been so angry? He was usually upset when he was a prick with Mrs. Hudson or Molly, and Sherlock thought of it as John's natural gallantry. But he didn't usually get so irritated from Sherlock just refusing a case.
John had to conjure up with all his strength the image of Sherlock broken beyond repair if he were to be killed tonight. He closed his eyes.
"Ummm... I dare say you do," you reply playfully, circling her waist and bringing her closer to you, just enough to give her an Eskimo kiss.
"I'm considering it, yes. But if you don't mind, I'd like to see the flat again. Before I make up my mind."
"His note?" she said, voice blank. She turned to the fridge. Her eyes widened and she paled abruptly before sitting down as if her legs were giving way.
He had typed it before he could stop himself. Great. Now not only was he useless, he was also pathetic. Sherlock's puzzled look told him the consulting detective must have been wondering about his mental health. John was expecting him to ask again what was wrong with him.
? His eyes snapped opened as he became aware of the wetness on the face that was pressed to his. He pulled back and broke the kiss, trying to put some distance between them, but Sherlock buried his face in the crook of his neck.
when Sebastian, who was standing behind his employer, nonchalantly pointed his gun at him. John's gaze hardened in cold anger, but he sat down on the bed stiffly. Moriarty grinned.
You smile, and nod in silence. The evening flies by – the food is great, as expected. Mary seems to be delighted. She eats twice as much as you do, under Angelo's approving gaze.
No, of course not. Why would we be honest with ourselves after all? Why should we tell the truth about everything, least of all our feelings?
"What?" Sherlock said defensively. "This is the first time anyone tells me this! Of course I'd want to keep a trace of it."
He showed Sherlock the file. The consulting detective's eyes sparkled as he read and looked back up at John.
sake, ready to dry your hair, ready to help you in the shower, ready to hold a towel for you and help you dry yourself while he is still dripping. All day you've been trying to find what it was that made you apologize for what these three years had done to him. Now you have the word. Selfless. Those three years have made him selfless.
He is standing very still in the middle of the living-room. But his eyes are moving everywhere, taking everything in. A wave of fondness hits you, so violent it feels like a blow and you stand dizzy for a moment, not saying anything, not moving either.
You decide not to interrupt her anymore, because you still don't understand. Your gaze keeps asking.
He did not develop, and John felt a little silly for asking. He couldn't quite picture Sherlock sharing quarters with his brother, anyway. The thought elicited a chuckle from him.
"Well, yes. I wasn't the one turned into a begging mess by your touch. But you must understand that there is nothing wrong with
You've been terribly worried about Mary since someone left poisoned apples on your doorstep. Because they truly were poisoned.
When he woke up in the morning, John was very surprised to find himself in Sherlock's bed. With no trace of Sherlock. He panicked and wondered what the hell they had done, but he couldn't recall drinking or anything of the sort that would have led to... this.
"You're not coming down with me?" Sherlock asks, and his tone must not have been the right one, for John looks wounded. Sherlock clicks his tongue with as much despair as annoyance. Then he notices that the trembling is back in John's hand and the annoyance vanishes. Guilt hits him so hard he acts without thinking and grabs John's hand instantly. "I didn't mean it like that."
Sherlock should have asked. He should have talked to the man more often, answered him more often, perhaps. They had become so close in the past three years. It was strange. It felt as if he had known Seb all his life, but he hadn't, he clearly hadn't. Sebastian knew everything about him. Sherlock too, of course, as far as the facts were concerned. Chronologically, he knew everything about Seb's life.
Behind the practical, matter-of-fact tone, John wondered if he did not hear some insecurity. Then he remembered Maggie's awful words, and slapped himself mentally.
"You are the unconditioned," he blurted, memories from university courses on Kant flooding his overly confused brain.
As he felt something sink inside his chest, he shook his head and tried to get a grip, distracting himself with the case at hand.
The faintest puzzlement lit up John's face for a fleeting moment. Then he simply smiled and turned the hairdryer back on.
"Now, now... Be good. I'll give you a treat. Speaking of which, have you eaten at all in the past two days?"
"In dreams," Mary went on. Mycroft had to refrain from rolling his eyes. Silly girl. He saw Mrs. Hudson give her a pained look, which she missed. That dear landlady was too kind for her own good. She could not take care of every tenant she had. She should not
The car was gone already and she felt a little stupid now, fidgeting in front of a stranger right on her doorstep. Luckily, he broke the ice first.
This time, Irene had to admit she was quite surprised – agreeably so – by Mary's question. It was so frank, so funny in its directness, that she couldn't help but smile. It was a smile that escaped her, a truly entertained one. Not one meant to be seen, and to produce an effect on an addressee.
When John regained consciousness, he was only half surprised to see he'd been brought forcefully to the Diogenes Club –
"Thank you," John murmurs, a tremor in his voice. Sherlock wonders what he could do in order to stop
But then he'd wondered. Had John expected him to say "me too"? Was that why he'd refused any other experiment before the night, and also the reason he'd snapped so easily and ran after Lestrade? Sherlock considered the thought. If love was purely physiological, then he definitely loved John. His body reacted to him even more than it had to Irene Adler – and he'd definitely been attracted to her. But John was above all his friend. Flatmate. Colleague. He was just so much more than Sherlock's image of a lover that he wasn't quite sure the word fit him.
Slowly, Irene felt something cold creep up her chest. Something that felt like disbelief at first, but soon turned out to be more akin to fear or unease.
He sneaked a hand between his partner's legs, went past the trembling shaft and stroked the balls, eliciting a yearning whine and a reproach: "John!"
John chuckled against the black mop of hair and let himself be swayed against Sherlock's chest – he felt slightly trapped, what with his arms being twisted behind his own back just because the self-centred git wanted to hug him and simultaneously keep his hands in his. As he hummed and rested his head on the angular shoulder, John thought he couldn't have been happier to oblige.
Sherlock's hand shakes a little as he takes it out, and he makes sure it no longer does when he puts it again between him and John, palm open, waiting for John to put his hand there.
"This is it, then," she says with wonder. She is getting quite dizzy. "The end." She looks at the stars around her and smiles.
You never knew what to forgive meant. Nobody knows until it happens, maybe. "I will never forgive you" is such an easy thing to say. I'll never forgive you. Never.
John woke up with a jolt and instinctively searched for his handgun, then realized he was in the living-room with an eerie blue gaze fixed on him. It all hit him when he saw his friend's worried expression.
"Yes it is! When he texts you to come, you always go, and when he doesn't, you go because you find it suspicious that he
John felt his hand begin to tremble and clenched it into a fist. He stared at Sherlock, voiceless. What had he been trying to say anyway? He didn't want Sherlock to have sex with anyone else. He was never jealous with any of his girlfriends, but he wasn't used to sharing. Especially not Sherlock. He couldn't bear it.
His hands roamed down the beloved chest, stroking the hips and circling the waist, finally lifting Sherlock's back slightly to sneak his hands under his buttocks. He was pressed so close to the detective that he felt the air catch in his throat, and his heart miss a beat. John froze and was about to remove his hands, but Sherlock sat back on them forcefully, and John squealed in painful surprise.
. Smart, but only interested in power and money and all those dull human passions. The head rules, certainly, unlike a certain someone – oh, don't lie, dear, you're a kid, and kids are ruled by their temper. But your temper was fiery and your goal was mine: to defeat boredom. Their goals were so ordinary... I wonder if you'll manage to catch them once I'm gone. If you're good and distract me until then, I might give you a hand.
When the doorbell rings he knows Harry must have had Mike on the phone. She's pressing it more insistently, and he can even picture her frown. Or maybe her excitement, because she wants to know if he feels better, now that he'd gotten completely wasted. Great, now he's analysing everything like... He stands to meet her at the door.
Even though he'd used the past tense, John felt something sink in his chest, and he stiffened visibly.
John could not help but glower at him a little. Sherlock had said that Victor was clever, after all. Clever enough not to show it too much, had been Mycroft's verdict when he had first met him. What had been his verdict for John, again? Bravery... just another name for foolishness. For a moment, John fought down the urge to strangle the man sitting across from him. The way he took everything so lightly and said words seemingly without thinking twice about them made John reel. He was not unlike Sherlock in his frankness, but he seemed to be a lot more...nonchalant? frivolous? John could not quite put his finger on it. All he knew was that he did not like it.
The silence soon became unbearable. Sherlock was even tempted to turn the telly on. He almost laughed at the absurdity of the thought – when had he even started to regard crap telly as a sufficient distraction? … No, he didn't want to think about that. Sighing in exasperation, he looked around the room to try and occupy his restless mind. The skull. 'He's a friend of mine. Well, when I say a friend...' No, no, that wasn't right. His gaze fell on the shelves of books. 'What, you haven't read
In this instant Greg had hated himself so much he could have walked out of the cemetery and under a bus without the slightest hesitation. It had risen in his chest, choking him, and no words could describe it – not guilt, not self-loathing, nothing. This was unlike anything he'd ever felt. He couldn't think, couldn't move, even less speak. He felt crushed. Physically, concretely, crushed.
His tone was so inflexible that John did not dare protest any further. Still, he very much wanted to comprehend this. Coming closer to Sherlock on the mattress, he ended up taking his hand unwittingly. Sherlock did not shake it off.
"from silence" ; an 'argumentum ex silentio' is a conclusion drawn based on the absence of evidence, rather than on the existence of evidence.
Their eyes locked, and it took only a few seconds for them to break into a fit of giggles. John loved it when Sherlock laughed. It was never noisy or ostentatious, but sober and genuine in its simplicity. You barely heard it, but the way his face lit up mischievously and contorted into a smirk was so full of jest John found it irresistible.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?" John almost shouted. "He's gone, all right? Have you seen him anywhere on your bloody cameras?"
John simply smiled, then remembered their conversation and refocused his attention on the elder Holmes.
Howling with pain the dog kept fleeing, until suddenly all became quiet. Sherlock froze in the night. The cold silence dampened his ardour and he stepped carefully to the small, still form lying on the pavement. It was the headless carcass of the dog.
"Because they fly, of course!" Eliska had stared. "And flying is just like falling, except there's a less permanent destination."
Now Sherlock was more alone than ever and he was playing Lucifer. Mycroft was starting to fear that he might even enjoy it, or come to enjoy it for lack of anything better. John Watson had had a very good influence on him – even if he was just as reckless and addicted to the thrill. But now that Sherlock knew he was dead to him and so wouldn't wait, knew that any mistake on his part could mean John's death or his own, he'd probably want to erase everything even remotely related to the doctor. Knowing him, he'd hurt too much, and would eventually cut himself from it all. That meant all considerations of good and evil would be disregarded as well, as useless and irrelevant in this situation. Sherlock couldn't delete the fact that he was doing this for John, but he could hide it away from his awareness, in order to focus completely on the task at hand without being distracted.
He smiled shrewdly and Sherlock felt sick. The nausea was now overwhelming and more than a bit distracting. But maybe it was better that way – he didn't know nausea could act as Dutch courage and increase boldness, bringing a dizziness that could distract from fear.
When the ex-soldier turned to him and their eyes locked, Greg knew he'd found the right person. The hollowness in John's gaze was mirroring his own. Before he knew it, he was asking – no, begging – not to be forgiven, but to be blamed, punished maybe, by someone, anyone who'd understand just how responsible he was for what had happen, and who wouldn't ignore it. Who wouldn't let him get away with it.
When they finally broke away they were both panting. Sherlock's features were still stricken with fear. He rested his brow on John's. They closed their eyes as they tried to regulate their breathing. "I need a case," Sherlock murmured. "One I can... do."
, John chided himself. He was so emotionally unstable that he couldn't even get the words out properly.
"Seb," Sherlock says quietly. Softly. You don't remember his voice ever being so soft. Maybe when he apologized to Molly that night on Christmas Eve. Did he ever say your name like this? Did he ever call you in such a way?
"What I mean is that..." His fingers danced up John's arm all the way up to his shoulder and ended on the nape of his neck – John realized this was, for both of them, a very intimate, vulnerable, and consequently erogenous part of their bodies; John loved touching Sherlock there, but the detective himself always seemed to prefer the throat. Naturally, the throat was just as intimate and vulnerable and erogenous, with the jugular vein and the sensitive skin. But for some reason, the symbolic dimension of the nape was much stronger for John. He hadn't thought Sherlock had noticed at all. But for him to play the end of the
That had reminded John that stupid Big Brother had put cameras all over the flat – or so he said. Maybe he'd just been messing with his mind. But then again, maybe he hadn't, and if there was even just one camera in their home, filming their most intimate moments, John had to find it and get rid of it. Or better even, avoid doing anything in front of it. If Mycroft had managed to bug the flat once, then he'd be able to do it again. He sighed.
John frowned slightly, bemused; then out of the blue: "Maggie found something weird while cooking yesterday."
Ah, those boys really did not know how to take care of themselves. Or maybe Sherlock just had used everything that was in the fridge for his experiments.
The manul groaned. He'd just hoped the consulting detective would not bring it up so soon; if at all. What a mess.
Don't do that. - Do what? - The look. - Look? - You're doing the look again. - Well, I can't see it, can I? It's my face. - Yes, and it's doing a thing. You're doing a "we both know what's really going on here" face. - Well, we
"I don't understand why you needed to see the grave," the man who had just arrived grumbled. "You of all people should know how delusive the name on a gravestone can be."
"That's preposterous!" Sherlock protested. Then he saw the graveness in John's eyes and sighed, closing his eyes and diving into the sensation. "You're more idiotic than I thought if you believe I don't want you when I'm this hard." He slid his fingers against John's flesh, mimicking his gesture, teasing more at the tip to stress his point. John groaned, pushing him back against the wall, bucking his hips – they gasped in unison.
Sherlock put his hand on her wrist and stopped her gesture. She looked up at him, and in her eyes he saw the embers of her old weakness. He smirked. Two could play that game.
The bloke keeping one eye on 221B saw a young lad come out of a car with a basket, go in, and come back not a minute later. But he left with the car before we could do anything."
to do so. Sherlock was addictive, and John knew their relationship wasn't healthy. Not because they were both addicted to each other, but because Sherlock wanted nothing to do with relationships, and the doctor himself was well aware that he was in denial as to the nature of his feelings towards his flatmate.
? And she completely believed what John had written about Moriarty on his blog. She knew Rich Brook had been a fake, and had developed a deep hatred and scorn towards the media – that is, until the situation had been reversed. Sherlock Holmes was now widely considered a misunderstood genius. No one knew why he had committed suicide in the end, but most theories involved his superior intellect and weariness of the world. One reporter – a certain Langdale Pike – had even gone as far as to wax elegiac about Sherlock being misjudged and condemned by a society he always tried to bond with through his job as a detective [
, Mike ponders, a bit gloomy. But John sounds so excited about it – and that bakery he's found by Covent Garden, they should really go and have coffee there once, oh and there's this funny club where they play jazz every Thursday night and it's actually really good...
"Oh really? What is there to explain, John? I think you could still have given me a call, you know, to tell me things were over because you'd finally admitted to yourself that you were gay?"
But because of that, he wouldn't be a very good subordinate. He wouldn't listen. Although he probably wasn't one to act rashly, he would still be very determined to challenge one's authority if he thought of something better to do. Sherlock hadn't told him anything because he'd known John wouldn't have waited home. He would've come with him, and he would've been a hindrance.
"I was wrong in my first deductions on this case. Sure, I lacked data, and Lestrade didn't help by withholding information, but–"
Yngvar goggled, nonplussed and more terrified by the second. Jeff took off the blond wig that hid silky black curls, and threw the leather jacket to the side. He sat in the imposing armchair and pointed to a stool near the bed.
"As I said, he's just playing. Testing me. It's so simple, really. He must have told the two girls that if they didn't blame the murder on me, he'd destroy them, because they owed him. Something of the like. He's just having some fun."
Hearing that singsong voice was possibly the worst way Sherlock had ever been forced back into consciousness after being drugged. Because, although he couldn't quite recall the actual occurrence, he certainly had been, if the numbness of his limbs and the drowsiness was anything to go by. He willed his eyes open however, as
"But that's not the case. You did something I never expected; you broke yourself down to pieces. You were already broken. What was the need?" She played with her glass a little, making a clear, clinking noise with her nails. "You killed yourself, Sherlock. So I had to send the Iceman to revive you. You understand, don't you?"
Rolling his eyes at the smugness of the answer, John lowered his leg and bucked his hips against Sherlock's groin. The detective yelped in surprise
Sherlock blinked, twice. John tilted his head to the side and returned his stare. He didn't seem to be expecting Sherlock to make small talk; he wanted to talk about the case. Sherlock wasn't sure why he thought the way they spoke to each other should change — he shouldn't have been surprised. After all, they mostly talked about cases. Why should it change?
"You're really not catching me at a good time, you know? I told you I just flew here. I am jetlagged, I haven't seen Sherlock in a decade..."
And as she said so, she walked down the last two steps, and past Eliska. Of course, the door leading out of the mansion was also guarded by two other men. Not a problem, though, Irene thought idly.
"The truth," John let out in one breath. "I've taken advantage of you when you were at your most vulnerable. It made me happy to be the one who could fix you because I had been the one used to break you. I enjoyed being in charge. Even in the basement, I–"
Bit long, this chapter... The longest till now I think. And I know I'm messing with the second-person narrative too - but that's fully intended, I'll let you guess as to why ;) Sorry this chapter isn't as happy as the previous one :) In two chapters we have John's POV, and it's definitely not as dark! Even if the fact that John's chapters are getting lighter and Sherlock's darker is pretty dark in itself... ;p Hope you enjoy! And thanks to all my reviewers, you guys are great :)
"Hello there," John said with a tentative smile. For the first time, he was rather self-conscious, and he did not like it at all. But once he'd got under the cover and snuggled up to the warmth of the tiger's plushy chest, all doubts vanished from his mind, and he fell asleep peacefully, lulled by the low, regular purring his presence elicited from Sherlock. Before he was completely gone in the land of dreams, John wondered absent-mindedly whether the tiger wasn't aware of it, or was now comfortable enough with him to not feel foolish purring in his arms.
The bed was warm and filled with Sherlock's scent. It was strangely soothing, to feel enveloped by somebody's presence simply from their body's warmth and smell. Sherlock...
It was rather embarrassing, and Sherlock wasn't used to adopting the submissive attitude, especially knowing that there must be a camera somewhere in the corridor leading to his room. But he could tell John was enjoying it – a lot. And that in itself was enough to persuade Sherlock to go along, and to make him ridiculously excited, too.
John squealed as Sherlock poked his tongue and lapped his way up his shaft, curling under at the top and swirling it over his balls. He mouthed one and brought his fingertips to the top of his partner's manhood, drumming and teasing skilfully.
"I am not having this conversation with you, Harry, but no, that is not the problem. Not really. Maybe. Look, it doesn't matter! I'm just not interested."
As the whipping continued and the belt around his neck was tightened at an agonizingly slow pace, a hand stroked his back soothingly. It was warm and gentle, the skin rough rather than smooth.
He grabbed some clothes in his suitcase and went to change in the bathroom. He was half expecting Irene to have vanished when he came out, but she was still there, beautiful in her green evening dress and amber jewels.
"Did you buy it for... this?" Sherlock inquired more hesitantly, not so sure of the brilliancy of his plan now that John's cold body was so close to his.
All right? Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock... Sherlock! Oh Christ. Are you OK? - Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine. That, er... thing that you... that you did, that, um... you offered to do...that was, um... good. - I'm glad no one saw that. - Mm? - You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might talk.
Sherlock had never been good with gifts. His parents' gifts had never truly felt like gifts, except for the eye patch his father had bought him on the last Christmas before he died, and the chemistry set Mycroft had given him the next Christmas to
That night, John falls asleep in the armchair while reading the paper, and it is way past midnight when he wakes up with a start after a nightmare. He cannot remember his dream at all, but the feeling of unease remains, and he stands up to get a glass of water. As he goes into the kitchen, he turns his head to the right, and his eyes meet the door to Sherlock's room.
"Thank you for inviting us tonight," Molly said, turning her cup of herbal tea in her hands absent-mindedly, thinking of a yellow mug with green polka-dots.
He shook his head and jumped out of bed, stretching his back. Every time he woke up after his transformations, he felt stiff, his back aching. It was so easy to consider it all a dream, having never woken up with his friend by his side, and he wondered if Sherlock felt the same way. Except that it wasn't a dream: he checked the calendar and a day had indeed passed. John smirked as he pictured Sherlock waking up while he was cuddling him on a bed. Obviously the detective would make a run for it. John was just surprised he hadn't screamed or jumped the first time, effectively waking him up.
Sherlock pulled one of his sweet smiles, trying to look reassuring, but John found it rather wolfish.
The door opened and in the darkness, John could make out that his flatmate had changed into his pyjamas. He shivered when Sherlock closed the door behind him, but remained composed when he came and sat down on the bed.
"I love Fridays," Mary declares. John finishes work around noon on Fridays. When he announced he was considering working full-time, she had refused right away, saying they'd just be careful with the money, and she didn't want him to be away from home all the time. She found many reasons, made up excuses; she knew that considering their situation, she wasn't supposed to act like a wife entitled to ask her husband to spend time with her. She'd been the one to say she wanted a divorce after all. But John never mentioned it again. He simply takes care of her, attentive and loving as always. Sometimes Mary completely forgets they even had that conversation. But only sometimes. Like when he came to discuss with her the matter of taking up a full-time job at the clinic. In the end he managed to convince her – mostly by explaining that full-time only meant 37.5 hours a week, so that he would be home at 5.30pm every day and at 1pm on Fridays, with the weekends off. Admittedly he had to get up early to be at work at 8am; but Mary was used to getting up early for school anyway. Moreover, she could have a lie in if she felt like it: she wasn't the one working at the clinic now, was she?
John wasn't sure whether the tiger scoffed or pouted disdainfully, but either way, it looked so silly it was actually cute.
"It is a lovely place. It's lucky Mrs Turner's tenants moved out, really. Don't you think this is great? You'll be living close by. You'll get to see your son whenever you want."
He nods. Then he tells you the conversation they had then, word for word. Without any hesitation. Without a pause. He remembers it all. And as he says them again for you he ingrains each and every word in your mind, indelible. How alone he must have felt. How scared before he jumped. Scared of the fall, scared of the snipers, scared for you, scared for himself... He hadn't planned on Moriarty shooting himself, had he? It was as if Moriarty was telling him
Sherlock's head fell back, hitting the wall, and he moaned loudly. Biting his lip, he glared down at John.
But Jim hadn't beaten him that day. In the end, he hadn't beaten him. And now he could no longer watch him dance. Could no longer watch anything, really.
"You could be one too," he replied to the Woman, some distant part of his brain trying to keep track of what was being said.
John swallowed, closing his eyes. This was a bad situation. He was a manul in a foreign country, locked in a room without Sherlock. The consulting detective did not know where he was, but Irene Adler did, and when she came back, she would expect to see a man. Not a frenzied fluffy cat. John calmed his breathing and let his military training kick in. Fully alert now, he glanced around the room and found a clock. He blinked. He hadn’t actually paid any attention upon coming out of the shower, and he had no idea around what time Irene had led him here. Consequently, he did not know how long he had been out. There was no time to lose.
Molly had been traumatized with coffee – more precisely, with asking people out to have coffee. Now, she always specified 'go out for a drink', so nobody would be dense enough (or obnoxious enough) to thank her and say what kind of drink they'd like her to bring them. She was about to be traumatized with that formulation too, though.
"I'm not.. ah! Ungh... Will you stop doing that?" John growled, referring to Sherlock's damned talented mouth. He was horrified to hear his voice come out as a whine.
"Dead, yes. Obviously he left the letters before he died for someone to make sure Sherlock would read them, but that is not the point."
feelings", believing in some kind of asexual Sherlock, had only been a more elaborate kind of denial. He could never be sure about Sherlock's sexual inclination, but John knew his friend wasn't a sociopath, knew he
And why should Sherlock have paid any attention to him? They could not even have a proper conversation when John was a cat. He could not "bounce back ideas" in any way, and if Sherlock was patient enough to put up with keyboard dialogues on non-case days, John was fairly certain that his mind would fly off to consider more interesting things than whatever John would clumsily type about an ongoing case.
Trying to shrug it off, you curl up in the synthetic blanket so as to look asleep – and not because the tightness in your chest is choking you and will no longer be ignored, naturally.
John nodded decidedly. This was no time to be embarrassed. But to his surprise, Sherlock's annoyed face broke into a smirk.
Sherlock put a hand on Victor's shoulder, squeezed a little, and left. Where could have John possibly gone? He couldn't open the bedroom door alone, that was for sure. Perhaps he hadn't wanted to be around when the ambulance arrived, so as to avoid drawing attention. It was true it was illegal to keep a manul as a pet, and people were more sensitive about protected felids in this region.
"Come on, let's get into the shower," John interrupted, standing up. He didn't extend a hand to Sherlock, nor did he help him stand again, but his hand never left his friend's arm. He looked him in the eye.
Sherlock ignored the fact that this sounded very much like an order and obliged. As he did, he felt John's middle finger deliberately enter him.
Your eyes keep scanning his face, noticing the most insignificant details, the way one curl is flattened as if he's been sleeping on it, the way one eye is more bloodshot than the other although both have bags under them, how one ear is showing more than the other between the curls... You look away.
It was on Christmas 2011 that for the first time, Greg Lestrade had an inkling of what he might be lacking. Quite concretely then, what he lacked was a presence by his side. There was the roughness of the linen and the semi-darkness of the room and the ceiling, as there had always been. And Greg realized that whether his wife was in bed with him or not, he woke up, got up, in the very same way. He was always alone upon waking.
John averts his gaze and they fall silent. He's at a loss as to what he should answer. It's true he'd love to be a father, but...
Something fluttered in his stomach and the heat pooling between his legs increased. This was mad and confusing and brilliant. This was so utterly
"I hope you've planned to buy John another phone, considering his was crushed during this adventure."
"And the police believes Henry is the culprit because it all seemed so 'crazy', right? The way it was done. The notes. The bomb."
"You're not grotesque," he whispered, resting his brow against Sherlock's, their noses rubbing, their lips brushing. "You're beautiful." Then, as an after thought. "You're handsome, Sherlock."
John's mouth moves slightly against yours, as if shyly – unsure. Well. You're not sure what you're supposed to do either. But John should. He must have kissed countless times.
Sherlock smiled. Although he refrained from pointing it out because he was quite sure his flatmate would not appreciate the remark, he found rather adorable how John went through the trouble of typing as he spoke, with ellipses to mark pauses. Sherlock's hand moved and caressed the soft fur of John's back.
Sherlock had his back to the mirror, but he still shivered when the shirt finally fell to the floor and his torso was bared. The last time it had been so, he was writhing on a chair in front of John and a stranger, Moriarty in his back, pulling his arms and exposing him even more. He paled abruptly and felt his head swirl, but all of a sudden John's hands were back on him, pressing his arms slightly, bringing him back to
"I just flew in from Singapore, and I am exhausted. I do want to talk to Sherlock as soon as possible. I came here straight from the airport. But of course I will wait until morning if you think it best. I do not want to alienate Sherlock before I even tell him about the case."
Are you all right, Sherlock? - Of course I am, John. Just thinking about the case. - That's not your
But he wanted to have some fun with the Iceman now, too. He was curious. Both brothers were so different, yet complementary. They made sense, together, and Jim was almost jealous. He was glad their relationship was so bad, for he knew it hurt Big Brother more than he ever let out, and there weren't many things that held that power. No, Jim thought with a wide grin, Sherlock was probably the only way to get at the Iceman. That, and his job. The British government, was it? Then Jim would strike doubly.
That last thought was preposterous, and Sherlock knew it. All the more reason to remain quiet and not make the situation worse.
How? was the first thing John thought. How could he pull it off and fool even Mycroft? But Holmes the elder had said so, after all. The only one who could ever deceive him was Sherlock. John refrained from cursing under his breath. So Sherlock had known. Why hadn't he told him, at least, if not Mycroft? Did he think he could not keep a secret? Had he preferred to keep it for himself, like a precious memory, something for him alone? John must have looked l like such a fool, telling him that Irene Adler had survived thanks to a witness protection scheme. Well, he thought bitterly, nothing new there.
Seeing that John was truly upset, Sherlock regretted his trick a little. But really, that leap and dash had been worth it. Still, he did not want John to sulk for the rest of the day and refuse his caresses, because he liked to caress John very much. So dropping the smirk, he walked up to the armchair and crouched.
wanted. But it was the only way to warn John properly. Reveal to him the truth – tell him he wasn't dead, but that either of them could well end up dead very soon if they weren't careful, because Seb was looming.
John's face broke into a challenging grin. He pulled Sherlock down into a bruising kiss, piercing him with his tongue, running his hands through his curls damp with perspiration and bucking his hips. Sherlock moaned into the kiss and John sneaked a hand down his torso to tease his leaking hard-on. This distracted the detective enough for John to suddenly reverse their positions, rolling them around and pinning Sherlock to the floor. Sherlock cried out in surprise and frenetically grabbed the leash to pull John down, glaring at him heatedly. John chuckled.
So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot; and taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And searching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no fault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back from the outermost boundary, and returned by the high road towards the city.
"We can't state one before we've retrieved the letters, of course," John cut in before Sherlock declined some seriously needed money now that the doctor was out of work. "And naturally it wouldn't exceed what you have – God, it wouldn't
"Well, whatever you call it. Doesn't matter. The only thing that matters, really, is the final problem. So have you figured it out? The ultimate problem. The most important one."
She shivered. Hearing his voice saying this now sounded ominous, too ominous for her. She didn't like it. It would be horrible, just horrible if Sherlock truly died after all he'd gone through to...
Sorry about the weird formatting of this chapter. AO3 just hasn't ben cooperating with me on that one and thiis the bestI could do. If the lack of break lines really put ou off, you can read this chapter on FFnet.
The poor cat jumped back in horror, as if he actually understood what Sherlock was saying. Or maybe it was just the Cheshire cat's grin on his face that scared it. As it tried to get away, Sherlock pulled it closer by the paw, and it fell from the chair with a loud yelp. This surprised the detective, who hadn't truly meant to hurt it.
I woke up this morning to the sight of your sleeping form beside me. I think I haven't got used to it yet: you, being alive. Being here.
John wouldn't have presented things this way – it all sounded so simple, so common... But perhaps this was what Sherlock was aiming for.
way would help? Sherlock had been right – as always. Talking was not the thing to do. Moriarty's scheme had been much more
just because Sherlock had asked him if they were on a date? Well. Thing was, Sherlock wasn't just Sherlock. He was a man.
You scowl at your brain for using the word 'junk' and ignore it. Arching your back, you sit straighter in the old armchair. Apparently, you can no longer sleep in beds. Not that you used to very much, evidently. But the last time you did, it was in John's room. His hand in yours.
But today, Prince Charming came. He wasn't riding a white horse, nor was he wearing a large red cape blowing in the wind. Wrapped in a dark grey coat, his black curls fell in waves on either side of his porcelain face illuminated by the most radiant blue eyes Concetta had ever seen. Her mouth fell open and when he passed right by her, her eyes widened and she dropped her lollipop. But like in a fairy tale, the stranger swiftly caught it before it touched the ground, and handed it to her with a smile.
"At the end of the fairy tale, the protagonist goes home and marries the farmer's daughter, since everybody else in the world was as silly as they were," he said. "Miss Hooper. Do you think Sherlock will come back?"
"Think, John, just think! Don't you find it weird that she kept playing oblivious when she knew who we were?"
Downstairs, Mrs. Hudson is waiting anxiously, going back and forth from the staircase to her quarters. She would be overjoyed if John came back to 221B, but she can't help thinking it might not be the best for him – it's a great flat, not that small and in central London which is an asset for sure, but will he be able to move on if he lives there? To build a new life for himself?
– at all. But John did. And the fact that he'd be ready to spend it with a woman he'd just met in order not to spend it with his flatmate was significant enough. Why did he have to burst into Sherlock's life if only to recoil and leave him shrouded in his solitude again?
Oh God. Maybe sexy times wouldn’t have been so bad, John mused as Ferdinand’s chubby hands picked him up and brought him to his chest again. He could’ve hidden in the bathroom and tried to block the sounds out. Not ideal, but anything would’ve beaten this.
He simply let her, unmoving. Unmoved. The gaze she met when she broke away was unartifically dispassionate.
You feel stupid. There's no other word for it. John said that even if you had other night terrors he would run after you, always, and catch you. But you don't feel like reiterating the experience. At all. You liked it much better when
Sebastian pouted sulkily, but obeyed. Once he was gone from the room, Sherlock took out a letter from his jacket's inner pocket, and unsealed it. More poems from Wiggins.
"If you do not mind, I would rather wait for Sherlock," Trevor said with a charming, casual smile. "I know you are his associate, but—"
Sherlock scoffed and turned away, but John caught his tail with one hand, while putting a plate of grilled beef on the table.
Sherlock snapped back to reality when he realized John was actually talking to him and not just chanting his name. Bringing a hand to John's sweaty brow, Sherlock ran his fingers through his hair, a smile playing on his lips.
OK. Definitely not good at this. But it's the middle of the night, how can you be expected to say anything clever? Or even vaguely coherent? You should learn to sing. You should learn a lullaby. That doesn't require much thinking.
Sherlock had stopped pacing and was now sprawled on the sofa, craving a cigarette but not daring to light up –
he thought. It wasn't like John could really act all domineering and order him around when he wasn't in tiger form. And he'd stayed home for Sherlock, after all. He hadn't gone to the clinic.
, then he could handle showering alone. John had taken a look at the stitches and they were fine. He'd still given Sherlock some painkillers over breakfast because he had heard his quiet whimpers in bed every time he rolled on his bad arm, and he had grimaced when he'd woken up, as if the first thing he had registered was the "annoying pain", as he called it.
John kissed him again, silencing him effectively. He wouldn't be able to stop if Sherlock kept being so damned adorable and oblivious about it.
As he posted it, he tried not to think too much about whether he would prefer getting an affirmative answer or not.
"But you mess with people's heads a lot more than I do, Sherlock. You have no idea how much you're messing with
Soon they got to their destination and paid the cabbie. As they walked up the stairs to the flat, John finally mustered the courage to speak, and began:
He groans, refusing to move: if he closes his eyes, he can still feel Sherlock's body on his and the soft puffing of his breath on his shoulder. He never wants it to stop.
Truth be told, he wasn't that comfortable with his body either. He was a soldier, not a dancer. He had seen and still saw every day many kinds of bodies, and his scrutiny had always been an anatomical, practical, professional one. Not with the women he dated, of course. He found them pretty and attractive. Nothing like Sherlock, though. It was funny how someone so awkward, with such long limbs and an unharmonious face, could have struck John as the very first body in which he saw true beauty.
"Someone's been killing young women using poisoned apples. The police are out of their depth! I thought that would have been right down... well, you know, his street. And I think it is that D.I. who used to come by who's on the case."
She did not seem very happy about it, but complied without a word. John's eyes fell on the list she handed them and widened as he read the name of James Oakshott:
"Call an ambulance," Victor ordered. And as the maid was still standing there, horrified, he bellowed "Now!" She complied shakily.
Half an hour later, they were having tea as John took down everything their new client was telling him.
"Mrs. Cubitt," Sherlock said, extending his hand to shake hers, "such a pleasure to meet you. Finally!"
"It's fine," he said finally, rocking their bodies together slightly as he stroked his partner's back. "You can keep doing it, since it reassures you."
. He rolled his eyes in exasperation. This was dull. Really dull. With nobody around, it wasn't entertaining in the slightest.
The man whose existence he had completely forgotten for a moment: more than a moment, if he was honest with himself. There had been nothing at first, no clear thoughts, no memory, he had only felt dizzy and comatose. Then he had seen Harry, and had formed proper thoughts – but none about
Sebastian pouts and drinks a sip of wine to comfort himself, which seems to work quite well, for a second later he is beaming again, and turns to John.
Sherlock looked almost... sheepish. He averted his gaze, pursed his lips, and sulked. Or so John thought, anyway. He stood up, walked around the table, and squatted down in front of his friend, putting his hands on his knees.
A white page. The last letter was a white page. Was it the last thing Moriarty wrote before he killed himself? Did Seb know it was blank? I have a feeling he did. A final way to cock a snoot.
And he was, indeed. Such a child, too. A brilliant, reckless, proud and candid child, who didn't shun the world, but just didn't get ordinary people's thought process because it was so
She furrows her brow and her nose wrinkles slightly as she tries to remember where she's seen the name. Just because she's cute, you decide to spare her the trouble.
You do not point out that you could take care of it yourself, and you watch him as he swiftly rubs his towel against his own body before slipping on his bathrobe. John was somewhat aroused by your touching him, but you are just as limp as before. And you feel just as cold.
The detective took a deep breath, trying to calm the fury bubbling in his chest, the outrage he felt for being so weak, for being like anyone else, every common person, and even worse than everyone else because this whole bloody affair was getting under his skin so much and it shouldn't have, it shouldn't...
John's head fell back as he was brought up to his legs forcefully, crying out in pain and pleasure as Sherlock pulled him by the neck and the groin. He was pressed to the detective's chest like a ragged doll, Sherlock's hand still between his legs, groping, his fingers brushing the nape of his neck, his mouth on his, his tongue penetrating him. John came in a matter of seconds, screaming his pleasure.
As the two men closed the case and rolled it down the corridor, Mycroft arched an eyebrow and observed John closely.
... Chris's theory was that sexual attraction just came last, as a logical consequence from the craving. John was addicted to Sherlock and everything he represented; they were complementary. It wasn't sex for sex, like he enjoyed sex with all his girlfriends and even women he hadn't dated – that kind of sex was just normal and healthy. Sex was fun and pleasant and always a nice moment of intimacy shared with someone close, even if it wasn't the love or your life.
"I am calm. You still haven't told me what you want. Why did you call me here? To see if I still took two sugars in my coffee? Or did you time me, perhaps, see how long it took me to get here?"
"Fine," he said, standing, "well, you can just join me in our room once you're done with breakfast."
"If you're still talking, then you're not in bad shape," John commented, a little too feverishly perhaps to be convincing. But Sherlock was quite admiring of his friend's calmness. Through the pain, the detective could still see how collected John was – very effective, too.
a few minutes prior, so he was glad to hear it for himself now. Even if that was a small consolation, considering his gloomy impending future.
"Is it a friend of yours, Miss?" Yi Lin asked, quite evidently displeased. Irene could not repress a smile at her affronted yet professionally polite tone.
It was amazing how smooth a tiger's fur was – it gave John this peculiar feeling of cosiness he thought was only possible with a fellow human being. He'd never been one for animals – he had nothing against them of course, but he wouldn't want to have a pet. He much preferred fellow human company.
John's other hand came to rest on his chin, and caressed his tight lips until his mouth trembled under the touch and fell apart – just like Sherlock felt himself falling apart.
"He doesn't live in a mental hospital, Sergeant!" Sherlock burst out. "He's a PhD student in history doing research on Napoleon at Queen Mary University. He wasn't a messy person — look at the kitchen, look at the bathroom! Only the living-room is upside-down. Doesn't it strike you as strange? Why would he start throwing books all over the place?"
"Through her husband's therapist," Donovan developed unhelpfully, simply wanting to show what she thought of that.
"That, he is! Funny bloke, huh? Our little Mary was doing her show there sticking her tongue out and all, and there he goes to her table to ask her if she's been grimacing at him or not! Ha ha ha!"
was his little brother; but also the fact that he would go to great lengths to protect him, even if it implied some dark deeds as well. Even if it implied eliminating any living, threatening shadows around Sherlock.
"Right," you concede as you get into bed next to him, careful not to touch him. "But that's different."
Sherlock  frowned pensively – or perhaps, in annoyance. "Don't have enough data  yet. But it's probably linked to the place he met them."
"No! I mean, yes... Well, she told me about him, that's all! And... Isn't he the only one who can tell you about Sherlock's childhood?"
You cannot bear seeing his distressed gesture, as if about to drop his phone and run to you. You realize you've never craved his touch so much. You also realize you must let go – for real. No more hints. You shouldn't have given any in the first place. John must move on.
She knew and he knew and suddenly she felt a sense of serenity wash over her, a sense of transparency. She went to the window and looked outside. She welcomed her wrath with a studied placidity. Calm and incensed, she could feel her rage sharpening her features, increasing the tension in her muscles
When he comes back down the stairs half an hour later, she looks up at him expectantly and holds back her breath. John understands she's been waiting all along and sends her a warm smile, if a little wistful.
"She's our number one suspect's sister, John! Of course I was buttering her up, we don't want her helping him to get away now, do we?"
From what he observed from the window across the street, Mrs. Watson isn't a woman in search of a partner – even a more satisfying one than John.
So they had spent the evening in silence – not their usual, comfortable silence, but one that was off, like a false note – and finally John had retired for the night, saying he was tired. As if he needed to explain himself. As if Sherlock would question his decision to go to bed.
"I told you you should have talked to her yourself, John," she reminds you, her smile only faintly apologetic. Her eyes are twinkling at the scene. But Harry seems completely lost.
So does that mean...? "Here's the sentence: 'Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.'"
Truth be told, the detective had no idea. He wasn't thinking that far – in fact, he couldn't really think at all. Not like he usually did. He was drowning in the ruins of his mind palace and knew he had to leave before any more damage could be done. His 'mission' was accomplished. He chuckled darkly at the phrasing, but it soon turned into a sob and he almost threw himself at the door in his urge to run away. However he stopped abruptly in the doorway and, stiffening his trembling body, murmured:
Well, maybe that part was true, Molly mused. She didn't buy the one about Sherlock killing himself because he had felt "
I've been thinking about what he said at the very end – his last words to the world. To us. He talked about the symmetry, and I wonder how he could possibly have felt, not knowing exactly what Moriarty had in mind for the grand finale. Maybe in the end, it was all improvised.
so as not to spend Christmas alone. Let me assure you, you're the only one who finds it depressing. Well, maybe like all of the ordinary people out there. But I certainly don't. So off you go. I'll see you tomorrow."
to boot! Last time it'd been at night – and with Sherlock, too, always at night. Which was a good thing, since John had no idea how he'd hide a tiger in their flat during the day - especially if said tiger was in fact an infuriating consulting detective who couldn't keep still in one place and was bored to death the moment the Work was on hiatus.
You try to swallow the lump in your throat. "Oh, so you don't care if I can never get aroused with you?"
And with those words, she shook his hand off and left, slamming the front door. John felt a pang of guilt and grit his teeth, walking back up to the flat morosely.
You spend the afternoon writing about the case of the Sussex vampire, which you did manage to get out of Lestrade eventually.
The tiger just glared, and didn't stop scowling. Chuckling, John knelt down and wrapped his arms around him, rubbing his cheek against his warm fur, stroking his back. Sherlock kept frowning for a few seconds, before a soft purr resonated in the room.
When the Woman had truly died, John couldn't bring himself to tell him. So he'd lied. Only for Sherlock's own good? Really? The gnawing feeling in the pit of his stomach today says otherwise. John had been confronted with death before he met Sherlock. Many different kinds of death and grief. He knew that death somehow conferred a glow to the one we missed. The person was idealized and became so unreachable that their memory was ingrained in the deepest recesses of one's soul. He didn't know whether Sherlock had loved her or not, but he had certainly been fascinated with her. And John couldn't allow her to take any more room in his mind palace.
Sherlock grumbled sullenly, but complied, biting the doctor's bottom lip, making him gasp – teasing the inside of his mouth, crowding him until he was wiggling helplessly under him.
Lestrade just stared, at a loss. Sherlock sighed in annoyance. "The request! Perhaps this is the way the murderer receives his requests: the victim must write a letter to the police depicting the way they want to be killed, and write it as if they were the murderer, and not the victim."
They locked eyes. John's mouth twitched with the trace of a smile, and Dreamt-Sherlock's lips mirrored it. John turned away. Dreaming-Sherlock too.
"Not yet. But I am considering moving there. Lovely area, isn't it? There's a house just down your road—"
"I proved that Mr. Trevor had been murdered by exposing his past financial crimes. It was... difficult for Victor after that. His father had been a justice of the peace, esteemed in his jurisdiction. Victor's mother died with his sister in a car accident when he was seven. His father had raised him, and they were very close. I think... I think he would have rather never known about his past."
"Here," Sherlock says briskly, handing her his coat. "But hurry up, would you?" His tone is rather sharp but Mary takes the coat gratefully.
Anyway, so what if he had? You specifically avoided mentioning IOU to him. That was for the best. After all, tomorrow, at this time of the day, you'll be...
John was too used to this by now to freeze again and pause his ministrations. Still, he checked, just to be sure:
sucked and fondled and taken care of, mind you). But as ridiculous as it sounded, this was Sherlock, and it made all the difference.
"I was not trying to hurt you," Sherlock says quietly, eyes riveted on his cup of tea. In the dark liquid his face is staring back at him, another face overlapping it.
Except that Sherlock would not have reacted thus even if John had said it out loud. Not just because he was a tiger, but because something was seriously wrong with him. With them.
Sherlock was, of course, right. Soon the water stopped burning John and he felt his body get warmer and warmer. Slowly, with a gesture tinged with tentativeness and not devoid of a certain gentleness, Sherlock turned John around so the smaller man would be leaning back against the tiled wall, and rested the shower head on the nape of his neck. The liquid warmth sent a shiver down John's spine and he sighed, closing his eyes and trying to block away all images of Sherlock screaming under neon lights.
Sherlock turned abruptly as John made it to the bed, which, expectedly, was cold and hadn't been slept in. As he curled next to the pillows, he also missed the detective's unwitting smile.
He gasped as he opened his eyes and was hit by the smell of cigarettes. Without a word, Moran handed him one. Sherlock took it mechanically.
"I've been waiting here for you all day long," he remarked. There was no reproach in his voice; not even threat. Just a cold weariness, as if the reply had been expected of him. It simply came naturally as he stood up.
With a roll of the hips and a tilt of his head John spun around in the detective's arms, sneaking a hand around his lower back and tapping his fingers on his torso through the thin fabric of his shirt. The first movement was going to end soon. John looked his friend in the eye with determination.
Jim was a criminal, and Sherlock a detective, but that was accessory: what mattered was that they didn't really take sides. Jim wasn't officially a criminal, he only helped criminals achieve their deeds. He never dirtied his hands. All he did was the thinking, his clients were the real criminals. He'd tried it, and killing wasn't thrilling enough. He never wanted anybody's death after Carl Powers anyway, because it didn't satiate him. Being the puppet master, on the other hand, never bored him. He loved it when people got indebted to him. Especially powerful people – fallen Angels, he thought, smarter than average, but still idiotic enough to be after money, power, contacts... and so on. Moriarty could provide the contacts. He was more brilliant than anyone, and so could master them all. With communication and globalization as it was nowadays, the job he invented for himself was marvellous. It allowed him to be feared by Mafia leaders, to have quite powerful people dancing on the palm of his hand. At the apex of his career, he created IOU.
that he'd get what he wanted eventually. John was melting before his very eyes, and he wouldn't last much longer. Sherlock put a little more weight in his paw and accentuated the supplicating gleam in his eyes.
When he woke up in the morning, the first thing John saw upon opening his eyes to the world was Sherlock's face mere inches from his. His breath caught in his throat, and he stiffened noticeably, but Sherlock
Regardless of his somnolent state it seemed that he couldn't fall asleep, but he didn't mind much because he found solace in the warm figure enveloping him. The messy room now seemed cosy and snug.
"Well, good. Good, it's good. If you're doing well, it's... good." He looks down in a way that reminds you of a child sitting down at dinner with adults and who doesn't dare ask if he can leave the table. "I should really go now, don't want to intrude."
"So..." Hilton began once his wife had gone off to sleep – or had told them as much, anyhow, "Have you found what those little dancing men are?"
The  hardest part had been not to let John know. If he had, there was no  doubt he wouldn't have approved of such a "dangerous" plan, unless he  was to serve as bait himself.
. Sherlock didn't understand why Maggie's words had crushed the joy he had felt upon hearing John's confession. John loved him, had just admitted it out loud, and had dismissed the girlfriend. This meant indefinite cuddling with him in manul form, or when Sherlock himself transformed into a tiger. So why did he feel so cold?
"But you would know, wouldn't you?" Sherlock suddenly cut in, eyeing Elsie. "That he isn't especially gay friendly."
"The barman's an old friend," she replied. Then, as if she suddenly thought of something: "Look, actually I'm married, and I'm not here to..."
"Then don't be a fool now and don't change your mind. You know it's for the best, anyone would. It's quite simple."
Sherlock couldn't have been Moriarty's snipers' target, if the whole point was to kill him anyway. He would've rather taken the bullet than bend to his enemy's whims. If there had been any targets at all, they must have been people he cared about.
, John thought grumpily, wondering why the day was getting worse and worse with every passing moment.
Sherlock frowned and was about to edge away from the unwanted touch – he never liked anyone crowding his personal space too much. John was an exception.
"But I don't want to take a bath," Sherlock groaned, now definitely seeing an opening and intent on not missing his chance.
He snuggled up once more against the other man's chest drowsily, half dreaming already of blood painted lips. He could feel Sherlock's body slacken blissfully against his. Sleep was taking its toll on both of them.
"What kind of memories?" you press on, just to make him talk, just to hear the sound of his voice again.
Sherlock leant in against the table. In the candlelight, his curls looked even damper than they were. The flame danced in his pupils, endowing his eyes with a surreal glow.
in the room, for God's sake, how could he have been distracted now? Cold fury mingled with pain. His own stupidity angered him to no end, but somewhere deep inside it also
Before long John felt that the thrusting of his hips and tapping of the foot weren't enough to beat time and express the intensity of the frustration and shame and hopelessness he had experienced upon his return from the war, and that still threatened to overthrow him sometimes (mostly at night – and how he hated being so vulnerable against the nightmares). His right shoulder began to jerk, and soon his whole torso, and the space felt too crowded so he started moving his feet as well, as if he were spreading his rage and fear and sheer energy around him. He realized he was almost jumping up and down to the beat now, marking time with each step, back and forth and to the side, feeling the wood of the parquet under his soles. A groan escaped his throat.
my fault. No one could deny that," Sherlock remarked matter-of-factly. John blinked. But his partner did not develop any further. He seemed to be still preoccupied about John going out on his own. The doctor knew this was part of the trauma, too – not the one that took place in the Basement, but from the time Mycroft had the wonderful idea to make Sherlock believe John had left him, and then the time when Moriarty had managed to kidnap John just as he went out of the hospital room for two minutes to get a cup of tea. Sherlock had good reasons to be paranoid. John did not intend to spend the rest of his life always in the presence of his friend, no matter how much he loved him. But he knew that for now he should find compromises.
the guest? He was hit by a wave of nausea – the first of many to come. The warmth of the man's body standing beside him was making him queasier with every passing second. On the table before him, Sherlock's pearly grey body appeared to be made of ice and ashes. It looked so cold.
John took a deep breath and complied. A few seconds later, he felt Sherlock's hands on his throat, spreading jam all over his neck and under his ears. This wasn't what he'd expected. Nor had he expected Sherlock's first kisses to be on his eyelids either: a silent 'thank you'.
Moriarty grinned, enjoying his dominance, and began pacing around the doctor like a predator circling its prey.
When he had found out the reason for the murder of Victor's father, he had known that his friend would hate him for it. He had known that telling him would destroy their friendship. And he had known that despite all this, he would still tell him, simply because it was the truth.
Someone was talking to him. He couldn't decipher the words, but someone... The voice was familiar – or should have been. He couldn't quite put his finger on it. The darkness surrounding him was opaque, and he wasn't sure whether his eyes were closed and he couldn't open them, or if there truly was no light to be seen anywhere around him. It was cold and forlorn, dreary in its emptiness - vacant, irrevocably.
John's first reaction had been in accordance with this portrayal. But not the second. The second showed how much he had changed – how much he was
, it's none of your business. And the man seems to be genuinely in love with her. But still, it would be better if she knew... Right. None of your business.
John gave him a lovely pout, though he was probably unaware of how cute it made him look. Sherlock smirked.
As he stood back up, thoughtful, it dawned on John that Sherlock hadn't meant to hurt him at all: in that instant, the doctor realized that the first time Sherlock had transformed, he had not attacked him, although he could have easily overpowered him.
If Sherlock was like that in every day life, she had to admit her brother was even more twisted than she'd thought. But who was she to talk anyway?
Eliska looked at him strangely, but his gaze was still on the raven. "Well," she said. "Be that word our sign of parting."
"They're encrypted with different methods. More complicated ones. This was encrypted using the Vigenère square, and this one, the Playfair cipher."
Maybe he had finally lost it. He couldn't care less. Throwing himself at the dummy he started beating it to a pulp - except that it wouldn't actually bruise nor bleed. John could, though, as he soon found out, punching and kicking the hard plastic repeatedly, bestially.
John Watson"? "Bachelor"? What the hell are they implying? "Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson...
Home? Is it even home to him? You only spent 18 months together. Not even two years. He's been gone for almost three.
His gesture stuns you. A memory of a white sheet, a nightmare, and Sherlock poking you at night to help you feel better flashes in your mind. "I know. It's fine."
For once, Sherlock couldn't read his thoughts. He had no idea why John should be suspicious of anything.
It made him wonder sometimes if there was some meaning to it. Him, turning into a manul, and Sherlock, into a bloody tiger.
The weather today was endowed with a briskly stimulating coldness. Invigorated, Irene smiled and delicately tilted her head to the side, enjoying the shiver that ran down her spine under her vermilion cashmere dress.
"Sherlock, I don't know what you hope to find up there, but we've already looked at the flat – he's gone, probably ran away yesterday. He's now our prime suspect. But you already knew that, right? That's why you texted–"
"Mrs. Hudson, we're going out, very urgent matter, we might be back late!" John told their landlady after knocking on her door. She barely had time to open it and see her tenants run out, apparently in a hurry. "Oh dear," she said, shaking her head tenderly.
"I was just thinking that I'd miss your eyes tonight," he snorted, unaware of how romantic his remark could have sounded, if not for the sulky tone.
Yet here Sherlock was, sitting on the bench, looking at the pond. He was enjoying the quietness and the cool evening air; it felt almost warm against his cold skin, but not quite. It wasn't just dark, it felt dark. He could just close his eyes and smell the night in the silence of the park.
type of fan too, I'd say – but what do you think? Ha, what am I asking! You didn't do much proper thinking about John Hamish Watson, did you? Really... Everything is in the name already. Although I must say, he proved less boring than I thought at first. Bit more perceptive, too. Enough to understand you. Enough to change you.
John jumped at the name, befuddled. So she truly had known all along their real identities? They must have looked like idiots, playing married to fool someone who was in fact fooling them... Well, not fooling Sherlock, obviously.
You swallow and try to dispel the thought. John didn't have the money to move out of Baker Street and stay in London for very long. He wouldn't want to go to Harry's. Would he leave London altogether?
John had not offered they shared a room, so Sherlock hadn't either. Perhaps that was the safest course of action for now. Silence.
, too. Time has become three-dimensional : there's a before, a during, and an after. The before is white, the after is black, and the whole spectrum of colours can only be found in the during.
"John?" Sherlock called, interrupting his playing and following the stout fur-ball speeding off into the bathroom, "Is something wron–"
Sherlock was reminded of that time in Molly's flat when he'd been waiting to leave and there was nothing to do but think of pointless things, because all the important ones had been dealt with. As he had this last thought, he could tell something wasn't quite right in the reasoning, but upon examining it, could not see where the flaw was in his logic. Perhaps there was no flaw after all.
That wasn't exactly right, he thought, smiling perfunctorily at the waitress as he went in. He could feel it to some extent, but it had turned completely cold. He could feel whatever he was touching, but not the hand itself, as part of his body. He shrugged it off. After all, his left hand had remained cold since he'd left Austria, for some unfathomable reason. Sherlock thought he'd probably deleted the thing that could explain it. It didn't matter. Both hands were cold now. The balance was restored.
"This," he said abruptly, making John start. "I think this is fine." John blinked. "Better than fine. It's... good. It is completely irrelevant to consider it from an objective point of view, because there is nothing objective to it. From an outer perspective, you have been imposing yourself on me and I have been manipulating you. Now, even you must realize how illogical this statement is."
"Or just not interested," Sherlock replied, looking thoroughly bored. Sebastian rolled on the bed and stared at Sherlock's back.
Sherlock felt himself being engulfed in the darkness as the spotlight became brighter and brighter. He had to squint to see John's body move on stage. He felt Jim's body pressed against his from behind, grinding his hips, thrusting in a poor mimicry as he was revoltingly flaccid.
Victor swallowed. He stood up and walked towards the window, as if he needed to get closer to the light.
"If Sherlock had been bored, terribly bored, or if for any reason he'd been inhuman – if you had met Mary Morstan then, would you have still cared for him?"
Sherlock really was the kind of man you had to shoot right away if you wanted him dead, because if you gave him a chance, even the slightest, he'd definitely find a way to get out of it.
John was pacing in the living-room while Sherlock took a shower. He'd basically thrown him out of the bathroom, saying he needed to wash and get prepared to meet Mycroft – to "kill" him, more precisely.
While Irene read, Sherlock thought. He never liked riddles. In the past few years, Jim had taught him to
You spent the rest of the night on your knees in the bathroom, throwing up every now and then. You couldn't know this had been part of John's everyday life just a few months prior. Your informants weren't close enough to know anything so intimate as how John Watson spent his nights. They didn't have access to his flat.
Sherlock's head throbbed. He could recognize the Woman's voice, and Seb's, too. But everything was blurry and the migraine was making him dizzy.
, John's round eyes told the consulting detective. So Sherlock went to get it for him, plugged it in, and turned the computer on as well, mechanically entering John's password under the manul's indignant glare. Then he went back to the kitchen to make some toast and tea for breakfast. John's breakfast, of course. Sherlock certainly did not feel like eating at all.
Sherlock took the steps two at a time and Lestrade was breathing heavily, trying to catch up. John wouldn't be out of breath just from walking briskly up a couple of floors.
"I don't know, that's why I'm asking. This is such a strange case, I don't see what could possibly explain your reaction to the dancing smileys. Why didn't you think of anything before he was so desperate he went to a detective?"
They were standing a little way down the street of the house of Brad Campbell's wife, staring at said house. Or, to be more specific,
John blinked, then stared. Finally, he couldn't help but chuckle. Sherlock looked up, quite offended.
"Can't read those thoughts, can you? No wonder, they're so stupid... Oh, don't give me that 'as-if-you-weren't-always-stupid' look or I'll stop petting you."
He walked down the corridor and entered the sombre room. Sherlock hadn't turned the light on yet – not that the light in his room was very bright to begin with, but this was downright gloomy. The sleuth was sitting on his bed, and at first John thought he was staring at the periodic table hanging on his wall. But he wasn't. He was only staring into the void. When John entered though, he turned and looked him blankly in the eye. As if on cue, he laid himself down onto the mattress, spreading his legs slightly, body limp. John's eyes widened at the implication – and the hollowness in his friend's irises only strengthened his nausea.
How quaint. However Sherlock couldn't help but smirk as he pictured Mycroft's face upon seeing his own name card with a note on the back in his own handwriting. Sherlock had always been good at copying perfectly anybody's writing.
"Never thought of opening a bed&breakfast?" he asked, to make small talk. Hilton's clear eyes became even rounder.
"You mentioned Brad's divorce with Helena in his file," Sherlock said without transition, still standing and looking around the room. John repressed a sigh and took the seat closest to him.
Sherlock kept his promise and made him come again. And again. And again, until John begged for mercy – at which point he retorted: "If you're still begging, it means you've got some energy left." And he made him hard again, weaving fire in zones John had never even thought of. Sherlock played with his hands, his wrists, saying something about the reflex point of the prostate being there and stimulating it; he turned his nipples into ecstasy buttons, harassing them until a mere brush was enough to send John to the seventh heaven; finally, he aroused him again simply by groping his buttocks and thighs, applying pressure to certain spots that made John jump and shiver and gasp, never touching his shaft but blowing on it teasingly until it was rock hard and dripping.
"Oh, that again? I told you already!" She stands up and washes her hands, putting the rosemary pot away proudly.
The clouds were getting darker and darker, but Mrs. Hudson paid it no heed and arrived in front of the grave with determination on her face and a bucket full of disinfectants in her hand. Rolling up her sleeves, she was about to put on the latex gloves she had brought when a voice interrupted her.
"That's fine. Seb doesn't often ask for favours. He's a discreet guy, y'know. Didn't even know he had such... well, mature friends."
John clicked his tongue and refused to blush. This was stupid. "I meant get ready, Sherlock. I'll be in the shower."
Sherlock was stunned, his arms still shaking, his legs held impossibly tight in an attempt to hide the very obvious bulge in his pants. His breathing was irregular and a little quivery. John leant in closer until their foreheads almost touched and draped the jumper around his neck as if to protect him from the cold – not that the room lacked warmth, mind you.
After Sherlock had told him all about the five orange pips case and John had taken notes on his laptop, the consulting detective had continued recounting other cases. John had listened eagerly, if a little enviously, wishing he could have been there.
"I do," she concurs. "I do, but I've already made up my mind. That's why I wanted to say goodbye today. Plus, there's no point in getting married if we don't live together, right? And don't you think we've waited long enough?"
The door to the bathroom was shut again. Irene walked to the windows and opened one, looking out. Her face was impassive. John couldn’t even tell if she was thinking or just bored out of her mind. The shower started, and a minute later Irene moved towards the minibar. She poured two glasses of whisky, and in one of them, casually mixed some white powder. John’s eyes popped. Was she going to
Sherlock was too busy sucking his fingers and mouthing his hand whole to answer his delirious pleas, but he shifted
He'd laughed his head off at the recounting. He'd laughed even more his head off when John got married and said man was at his wedding party.
John is shaving off in the bathroom when Harry bursts in and he starts, cutting himself unintentionally. He groans in annoyance and doesn't notice Harry's eyes widen in horror when all she sees is her brother holding a razor blade with blood on his hands. She snaps.
