And then he was waking up, jerking awake with a gasp, skin clammy with sweat. The AC still chugged noisily in the background and his radio still hummed some distant song behind the new jarring noise of his alarm. That laughter as the man fell to his death was left to fade into the air as he blinked the sweat and sleep out of his eyes. He tried to focus his eyes on the ceiling above him, struggling to separate the dream from reality.
He groaned grumpily, grogginess tugging at his limbs like a heavy weight as he threw the blanket off his legs. Rather than get up like a normal person, he instead rolled straight out of bed and onto the floor with a crash, nevermind the downstairs neighbors. His knees banged against the floor painfully and he tiredly blinked at the floor, his thoughts slower than molasses. The alarm beeped jarringly at him from his end table and he reached over to turn it off, hitting it a little harder than was necessary.
Dean nodded in agreement, “It’s beautiful…” At hearing how wistful and soft his voice was, he cleared his throat again and moved on with a gruff voice. He did not want this pastor to think he was some sissy or weak kneed boy! “Did you happen to get the artist’s name?” He pointed to the corner of the painting. Instead of a signature, there was only a feather that curved into a ‘C’. “I wonder if it’s the guy I know. Never thought of him as a painter,” he lied.
(See the end of the chapter for
It started when he was rifling through the cash register, the weirdness he had been waiting for. The TV flickered on, static blaring as a ringing started inside the building. He flicked it off even as the radio burst into the life. The TV turned back on as he looked around, then rushed to a shelf. He closed a hand around a salt container before running to a window, dumping it hastily over the ledge. The fine white grains spilled onto the floor as the ringing became louder. A pressure built in his head as he tried to pour more salt but it was soon too much. He dropped to his knees, hands clasped to his ears as he groaned with the pain. A short burst and the windows started to explode, knocking him sideways.
“On the altima, I checked the hoses and they’re all soft and leaking. I’m not sure what is going on but they’re all ruint to hell, so just strip them all. Might want to flush the system, too. He’s not picking it up until tomorrow. Parts will be in tonight or in the mornin’.”
The person turned out to be a man, the flickering of the overhead sign giving way his gender. Dean Winchester stood in the neon lighting of the motel sign, barely moving despite the absolutely deplorable conditions outside. He seemed to be asleep, standing stock still with his eyes squeezed shut. The only sign he was awake was when the rain started pouring down with another erupting boom of thunder. He turned away with an expression of sudden anger, quickly turning the handle of a nearby door and ducking inside the room behind it.
He stopped in front of the sink, tying the towel snugly across his waist. He stared at the steam clouded mirror for a long moment before reaching over to draw a crude picture on it, smirking at his masterpiece. Then he flipped off the radio and clicked the exhaust on as he left, heading to his bedroom. He didn’t bother to mop up the water scattered across the tiles, leaving it for unsuspecting socks to find later.
Since his hands were now taken care of, the Hunter looked over the desk for a moment. He snatched up a book at random that was most likely made from human skin, the cover dry and crackly under his fingers and flopped down onto the now vacated couch. He sat down the half empty bottle of alcohol onto the floor next to him after another generous gulp. It was rationalized as being a bracing shot for reading the book, which already had his skin crawling with revulsion. And to think it was only page one.
“Hey old man, your favourite is here.” he called a greeting as he walked through the front door and scraped his boots against the rug. Ellen would skin him alive if he didn’t clean his shoes and tracked even half a speck of dirt into their house. And sweet baby jesus, score! On the entryway table was a box of doughnuts open wide to show a mix of glazed and iced goods, which he greedily stole two of. He ate the first in a single bite, cramming the entire glazed doughnut in his mouth. Dean had zero shame in his loud moan at the sweet, sweet taste of sugar and carbs.
“What are you doin’, you stupid boy?!” Bobby thundered.. no roared, his face quickly starting to turn an alarming shade of angry red and purple. “You’re supposedta take the hoses off the altima, not the friggin’ cobalt!” He pointed a finger accusingly at the cobalt, as if it were somehow the car’s fault, too. “Damn it, Dean, the owner’s gonna be here in a few hours to pick her up!”
He adored watching them struggle on each and every time he visited, enjoyed watching their vehement objections dwindle away. Their cursing eventually turned into half-hearted “go fuck yourself”s, their voices too raw to keep the pure hate in their throats. Eventually they would all accept his offer. No one had managed to not say yes to the demon whose whip bit the hardest, whose cuts sliced the deepest. They all eventually were let down from their rack, their chains, their torment with a whip delicately placed in their hands. They all eventually added to that softer undertone of maniacal laughter to the song of the damned.
Icarus stretched his hands out to the sky like a plea, still grinning savagely with pure elation. Every feather that dropped away was taken by the darkness and turned into new stars, gleaming like gems around him.  Icarus laughed as if the fall were some secret joke and the last Dean saw of him was him laughing as the stars swallowed him whole. Instead of falling straight down, it seemed like he fell almost… backwards into the night sky.
While he rambled on, the Hunter absented reached over to shove one of Cass’ wings down a bit more; the wet feathers had been tickling his cheek, making the skin itch a bit. The motion drew Dean’s gaze downward until his eyes rested on the shiny scars of a handprint burned into his flesh, long since healed over. Before the disjointed memories of Hell could overwhelm him, he turned the hot water up, the spray gradually warming up until lazy swirls of steam curled in the air. He scrubbed a hand over his face, watching rusty flakes of blood wash away from his face, surprised the rain hadn’t washed it all away.
His phone suddenly buzzed in his pocket, prompting him to fish it out and stare down at the flashing screen. “I have to go, Michael. I’d say it was fun but you spent most of the time judging my life choices.” He kept his voice dry but quirked a half smile at the end to soften the words. “Congratulations on the new title. I’m sure you’ll do a fantastic job at ‘preserving the Novak name’.” His brother was gearing up again, probably for a new lecture as he took the call and walked out of what Michael called ‘a paltry mansion’. It had 26 rooms, a foyer, three kitchens, a dozen bathrooms or more, and a whole slew of other things yet it wasn’t enough to house Michael and his egregious ego.
“Cass, get your feathery ass back inside.” Dean lowered his voice, now only slightly above normal while he stood beside his companion, face creased with worry and irritation. “It’s freezing balls out here, man. You’re going to get sick. You aren’t even wearing your stupid trench coat,” a note of accusation coloured his tone now as he gave the Angel a quick once over. “Why are you out here in the middle of a friggin’ storm?”
“Why? What happened?” Dean’s voice came from the kitchen and was closely followed by the steady sound of him starting to chop something up, the knife scraping against the cutting board in a way that made Sam wince in irritation. He wished his brother was more careful with their cookware but he was a hurricane unleashed in the kitchen, a force to be reckoned with.
“You know, even Gabriel is turning into something worthwhile. Admittedly the idea of owning a bakery, of all things, is still beneath us but at least he is a businessman. He makes a very generous salary. Studying abroad in France almost paid off for the brat.” Michael carefully stowed the painting in a thin box that sat atop the table, packing the extra space with tissue paper to keep the painting from jostling during transport.
Dean, with surprising patience, guided him through the hazardous process of shaving. He smeared the foam over his face, smoothing it over the spots he had missed. The razor was tricky to maneuver, it bumped unevenly over his face, grazing through the shaving cream. He winced at a sharp pain but moved onwards at Dean’s urging, dipping the blade in water a few times. When it was all done, he sighed at his reflection in the mirror. A half dozen nicks bleed openly over his face, but all the stubble was gone, lessening the gaunt look to his face. He used a splash of water and the towel to wipe away a few stray flecks of cream.
Tonight he went home alone, his body swayed with each step, arms swinging loosely by his side as he hummed half-forgotten lyrics. His apartment was less than a block away from the bar and he made decent time. He staggered his way through a shower, he giggled as he scrubbed away the oil stains with bland scented soap. When he got dressed, he barely made an effort, just tugging on a pair of boxers. Still humming to his half remembered song, he collapsed into a rumpled bed, passing out in between words drunkenly sung.
“This is Castiel,” he answered the phone with a polite and clipped voice. Much to his satisfaction the automatic voice droned about his car’s extended warranty and he ended the call as he climbed into his car. He dropped his money into the passenger seat and immediately dialed up his partner in crime and probably only true friend, Meg Masters. She was a highschool teacher at the public school with a feisty personality and the biggest metaphorical balls he’d ever known.
He finally shut the laptop down, even remembering to do it properly instead of just shutting the top and leaving it to die. He leaned back against his pillows, digesting his new information. Would the angel painting have been painted by the youngest brother, Castiel? With the scandal he’d read, it seemed bizarre that he would be painting angels. He hadn’t found anything about whether the son had been disowned or just punished. And besides, who named their kid Castiel, anyways? It was such a mouthful!
Castiel studied the back of Dean’s head with a perplexed expression, a frown marking his forehead. His thoughts were in turmoil, confused tumbled over and over within his head, it was enough to bring up a dull ache, unassociated with the copious amount of alcohol consumed the night before. Emotions were still too new to him, he hadn’t had the time to explore each feeling as they came. No. Life with Dean Winchester was too hit and run to stop and contemplate what he felt.
Five months. These months had been a close mimic to Hell, full of dangerous cases. The worst had been a siren problem. Men were murdering their wives (or in the case of one, their mother) with perfect clarity to their minds. At first Dean had been at a loss to what was happening until a doctor mentioned the unusual levels of hormones in their blood. Then all it took was an hour long phone call with Bobby to discover it was sirens. The memory of it still made his skin crawl, how easily he had fallen under their spell. He would have killed anyone just for the barest chance to please the siren. If Cass hadn’t shown when he did, Dean might have just been another body to add to their growing list.
He watched as Cass carefully cleaned his angel blade before he stowed it away. The Angel rolled his shoulders carefully before bringing in his wings until they were tucked safely against his back. It was something he did often when in door; the blue black feathers were always clasped snug against his back to avoid knocking shit over. He had noticed it long ago at Bobby’s house, the over cautious way the Angel minded his wings. It looked uncomfortable. Dean coughed when he realised his mind had wandered a bit, he had missed Castiel’s reply.
The air was thin, dust tickling heavily at his lungs as he coughed violently. His breaths came in short pants, his hands scrabbled at his jeans. His mind lurched with confusion, disjointed screams echoing inside his head. A soft click echoed noisily inside the tight darkness before a whoosh overwhelmed his ears. Light burst free from a small flame of the lighter he held tight in one hand.
Thwack. The meaty noise of a head rolling over the ground preceded the loosening of the hands around his neck. Dean shoved the suddenly slack vampire aside, the corpse sliding limply to the ground as the Hunter wiped blood off his face. “Oh, dude, seriously. Gross.” He groaned, voice tapering off to a harsh cough and sharp inhale. He blinked the water from his eyes and saw Cass standing nearby with a bloodied machete clasped in his hands, looking unruffled by the turn of events. The only sign of his alarm was the twitching fluff of his wings, feathers spike outwards in alarm.
There was only one place safe enough to take care of a broken Angel. A broken Angel that was unwilling to admit he was broken. A place where broken cars litter a gravel lined lot, where weeds sway lazily in the breeze, and a house sits on a dusty patch of grass, sagging with that lived in, homey look. That place was owned by Bobby Singer, an old mechanic who liked his alcohol too much and had a slight hoarding problem. It was the perfect place to take a broken Angel, a perfect place to slap on a mental band aid and look into a solution to fix what was broken.
Dean listened to some crazy old lazy harping on about a brand of anti-freeze she wanted in her car. Her voice was shrill through the phone he had cradled between his head and shoulder, it grated his ears with every word she spoke. He made appropriate sounds to appease her before hanging up with an estimation on when her car would be ready. He carelessly tossed his phone into his tool box and went to search his stock of anti-freezes for the brand she wanted. And of course he didn’t have it out back. Just his luck!
He eased himself out of the vehicle, sighing with pleasure at the brisk wind that brushed through his wings. They flared out behind him, arching upwards toward the sky in a lazy stretch that had the muscles burning temporarily. Then he shook himself vigorously, feeling comfortably loose after the too tight squeeze of the car. A curious look around showed nothing special beyond snow coated trees and an almost hidden gravel road. He puffed out a breath that smoked in the frosty air then followed in Dean’s footsteps toward the door.
“Cass, you have a lot to learn. How about some TV. Let’s watch it for a bit while the aspirin works on your cracked head, ok?”
Dean smirked at that, eyes crinkling with the force of his smile. Their lips clashed together with a slight clink of their teeth, a huff of their laughter, and the feeling of completeness that ease over them both. Dean’s work roughened hands gently cupped Castiel’s face, fingers smoothing tenderly over his cheeks. And Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck, not even caring that the counter dug painfully into his ribs. Neither of them cared for anything except that perfect kiss. Not even the idea of possibly being caught by their boss.
The memory of the siren case had Dean take another hearty gulp from his beer, washing away the bitter taste of the memory. When he lowered the bottle, his eyes focused on the new figure standing in the room. Bright blue eyes watched him with such seriousness, tainted with the ever present look of disapproval. Dean licked his lips as he sat up, setting his drink aside on the nightstand. “Well, well. If it isn’t my Angel in a trench coat. Seriously, dude, your sense of fashion blows.”
Dean continued mercilessly through the chant and now Castiel had joined, his voice strong and clear. “
are you?” Cass finally looked up to stare at the Hunter, unable to hide the slight note of confusion from his voice. “I’m an Angel of the Lord.” Wasn’t it obvious what he was? Humans!
Dean immediately felt uncomfortable as they both walked into the building, brushing a few clinging drops off their suits. Sam wasted no time in heading into the inner sanctuary, securing him and Bobby a seat near the back. For a man who had almost no family, the church was surprisingly busy and nearly full, the pews crowded with people. Steve might have been a paranoid man, but his heart had been kind and he was well liked despite his oddities. Dean almost wondered how the suicide would stay a suicide before he remembered people simply wouldn’t care that much to fight it.
“Cas, my wayward bird. Whyever would you be calling me at 8:30 AM on a Saturday?” Meg’s voice was a soft, sleepy purr in his ear, punctuated with a delicate yawn. “I don’t have the brats to handle for another two weeks, I like sleeping in while I still can.” He heard some shuffling and the sound of a keurig heating up, the clink of a mug against the countertop. She must have him on speaker phone then.
A baby blue sky greeted his eyes when he blinked them open, not a single cloud in sight. His panting was loud in his ears, uninterrupted by any noise of nature around him. It was eerily silent. It was the silence that gave him the energy to stand up, bracing his arms against the ground to push himself upright. He stumbled wearily as he straightened up, still breathing hard from the effort of his escape.
Sure enough, within the space of an hour, the two were loaded up into the Impala and roaring away at 85 miles an hour, the landscape turned to an artful smear outside the windows.  Carry on my wayward son blared through the radio over a faint undertone of static, just a hair louder than comfortable for listening to. Dean drove with his hands clenched on the steering wheel, he stared straight ahead without a word spoken. Castiel was curled up in the back seat, wings awkwardly tucked around him.
It became an unspoken agreement between the two: that night was top on the “do not speak of” list. Neither were willing to acknowledge what had happened between the two while their blood drowned in whiskey. So, when the morning dawned too early and too brightly, they hurriedly stumbled their own way with pounding heads and heaving bodies. Bobby was less than sympathetic to their case; he only threw aspirin down onto the table, followed quickly with the slap of a newspaper hitting the old wood surface. Dean winced at the sound, hand clutching his coffee mug a bit tighter.
“Of course you do, Dean. Why else would you summon me?” His breath smelled sweet, like rotten blood, and Dean repressed the shudder of revulsion that threatened to shiver through him. “Let me guess. You want your brother back, huh? Want your little Sammy alive and well again, hunting at your side as you two wreak havoc across the states.” His hand rose to gently cup Dean’s face, his fingers tightened briefly on his chin.
Rather than give a good reply, Dean shunted away the question with a listing of the tools. “Stakes, iron, silver, salt, a knife… I mean, we’re pretty much set to catch and kill anything I’ve ever heard of.” He waved his bandaged hand over each item as he listed them, even gesturing backwards to include something behind him. His words were grim with an edge of murderous promise. And when Bobby expressed, “This is still a bad idea,” Dean gave an exasperated huff. He gripped the table tight, “Yeah, Bobby, I heard you the first ten times. What do you say we ring the dinner bell?”
Dean slowly rose from his crouch, a venom polluting his voice as he spat. “Get the Hell out of here. There’s no such thing.” He stood with his shoulders hunched slightly, his eyes darting downwards with poorly disguised concern for his companion. Castiel leaned forward a fraction, smoothing in a firmer note to his voice, “This… This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith.” The Angel squared his shoulders back as a flash of lightning illuminated the room, his wings flaring outwards.
Dean shot up in bed with a gasp, hands fisted in his sheets. He was drenched with sweat, the blanket tangled up in his feet like some elaborate knot. He blinked blearily around his room, already soothed by the familiar chug of the air conditioning and the tinny sound of his radio in the background. He felt disoriented and the realities of the dream escaped him, just barely out of reach for him to remember much more than haunting blue eyes and a chilling laugh.
The Hunter could see his wings! The realization had him jerking his wings in tight against his back, the feathers fluffing outwards with discomfort. Dean licked his lips nervously as he watched, his voice a hoarse whisper. “I-I can see your… Your wings? They weren’t there a moment ago. God damn. What the Hell?” The Angel glowered at the blasphemy, muscles tightening with the urge to scold the human.
“What I am about to say is of utmost importance, Dean. You must never repeat this. I fear it may be disastrous in result if any soul were to overhear.” Castiel spoke gravely, coming to kneel next to the sitting figure of the blood spattered Dean. “You must know. When I rose you from Hell, you broke the first of a series of seals. These are barriers meant to keep Lu-“ The Angel suddenly gagged on his words, choking on the sentence. Fear turned his eyes a glassy shade of pale, pale blue even as he fell sideways.
“CEO, huh? Michael Novak, CEO of Novak Oils.” Castiel wasn’t surprised by the news, his voice almost bland. Their mother had been hinting at retirement for a few months now. Granted, she was a little young to be thinking about retirement. She was only in her early fifties. “Don’t let it go to your already blown up head. I don’t think I could handle it anymore. Just you wait, oil will probably crash soon anyways. Better start investing in better stocks.” It was the same old stab he made every time Michael brought up their family business.
That prompted Dean to notice that only the parts closest to the Angel’s shoulders were still wet, feathers clumped. “Can… will you help me?” His voice was softer than usual, the usual self-assured tone absent, replaced with an ache of loss and fear. The events of the night seemed to weigh down harshly on the Angel, the attack that rendered him bound to the ground crushing hard into his soul.
“It is an honour to meet you. You’re quite a legend downstairs.” He lazily stretched his hands through the air as if he presented a banner. “Dean Winchester. ‘The One That Got Away”. The demon stopped his inspection and stood in front of Dean with a sleepy looking smile that matched his eyes. He raked his gaze once more down Dean’s body with an admiring glint and he waited for the inevitable words.
Castiel was an artist, it was how he lived, and the pictures in his mind were brought to life on creamy paper. Unfortunately, he was an unlucky artist. His soul mate had green eyes, an unseen colour he grew to hate. Everything was green. Trees looked bleak and dull, their grey leaves rustling through the wind. Grass looked downright sad. The world felt so incomplete to him, especially in his paintings, always left unfinished with splats of grey to mark where green ought to be.
The Angel sucked in a breath before he tersely spoke, wide eyed blue gaze glued to the medical kit. “I have sustained a wound from the fight. I cannot stop the blood flow, my grace is entirely shut off from my access. Are you able to…” he floundered for a word before he gave up, a flush flared bright on his too pale cheeks. Dean abandoned his half eaten meal at the table, guiding Cass down to the couch. The wound in question was a few deep slices across his chest, cut deep into his right breast. They wept blood in a dark stream.
The next chapter will be from Cas POV. :) I really hope you all like my version of Castiel. Per usual, I don't have anyone to proof read or edit, so all mistakes are my own.
The demon spat out an insulting slur that suggested his mother had been a whore and his father made a mistake bedding her, producing the disgusting disaster that was Dean Winchester. In reply, the Hunter sank the needle into her eye, finger slowly depressing the plunger, emptying the contents. She screamed that wordlessly scream of true and utter pain, scrabbling frantically against her bonds. Her legs jerked brokenly against the chair, feet sliding and skidding in the blood that saturated the floor. Barely a moment later her eye burst with a sickening pop, splattering out a mix of gore and holy water.
Sam started to say something then stopped, looking thoughtful. He didn’t bother to actually say what he was thinking, instead letting the rest of dinner fall into a comfortable silence. He let Dean’s word turn in his head a few times and he felt a bit like an idiot. Maybe he was getting too worn out with his classes. It rubbed him the wrong way that he was stuck taking this Humanitie II course anyways and having assignments that felt useless didn’t help anything. He was going for a degree in law and the extra classes were just added expenses he didn’t need. Sam smothered a sigh and dug back into his dinner, even going to get seconds. The roasted bell peppers were actually very tasty and did bring out a bit more flavour.
A few moments later, the pastor called for quiet and began the service. He read from the bible first, quoting scripture in a loud and steady voice. A few people were already wrought with tears, a quiet sound under the pastor’s words. Once the quotes were completed, he moved on to read the obituary and added personal words of praise and regrets. Steve had been in this sleepy town of Kansas for his whole life, a good man with many ties to the local people. His death would take a long time to recover from. When the pastor ran out of words, he allowed person after person after person to come up to the podium to praise and remember Steve.
“Cass, I’m not hauling you out, you hear?” Dean braced his hands against the lip of the tub, pulling himself up until he stood, scattering droplets of water as he did. “Get your ass up. You can borrow my spare clothes but there ain’t a chance in Hell that I’m changing you into them.” He gently nudged the Angel with his foot before climbing over the side of the tub, wincing at the chill of the tile under his heated skin. He set two towels down on the seat of the toilet, “Dry off. I’ll be back with clothes in a few, alright?”
A sudden bang on the door made him jump partly in alarm, a moment later Dean was popping his head in. The Hunter’s voice was partially slurred, the words smearing together. “Cass, c’mon. We’ve got some learning to do!” Castiel offered him a nod for reply, smoothing a self-conscious hand over his shirt as he moved toward Dean. Learning? The statement sent an unhappy shiver up his spine, dread slipping through his veins. Being a human was extremely inconvenient.
He immediately took a sip of his morning caffeine and sighed blissfully, unbothered by the heat of the drink. He shuffled over to the fridge, still sipping slowly as he looked inside. The fridge looked woefully bare and was in desperate need of being restocked. Dean shut the door and gave up on the idea of breakfast, instead hoping that today was a day Bobby brought donuts in. He set his empty cup on the counter and made quick work of the bathroom, taking a whizz and brushing his teeth between yawns. A splash of water did nothing to help him wake up more and his eyes already had the beginning of black circles under them.
Dean steadied himself against the rush of hate that filled him, an itch to start a fight. He forced himself to smile, made it waver as if desperation were making it too hard to keep his façade up. “I want to make a deal,” his breath fogged through the air when he spat out the words through his clenched teeth. The demon licked his lips, a bored expression replaced his previously excited one. He stalked forward the final step between them and leaned in uncomfortably close.
When the morning dawned far too soon, alarm clock blaring, he dragged himself through his usual routine. First on the list was cursing his stupidity from the night, head aching and pounding with his hangover. Next was down three aspirin with a gulp of coffee doctored with a generous pour of Baileys and woof down a hasty breakfast of cereal. Last on his list, he jerked on a wrinkled t-shirt, stained jeans, and boots with ten minutes to spare before he was late to work. He snatched his keys off the hook by the door, and so began another day of fixing car after car after car.
Had he known it would take forty years in Hell to find his charge, Castiel might have had doubts before launching into this almost suicidal mission. Forty years of witnessing destruction. He had looked over millions of souls, hidden from millions of demons, worked continually without cease to find one soul in a tide of endlessly souls. Castiel did not know if he could ever recover from the forty years of Hell he had witnessed. Or so he thought until his eyes flitted over one more soul and he was nearly blinded by how brightly it shone.
“Jesus Christ, Bobby. That sounds insane,” Dean managed. “Steve was always a paranoid guy, but I mean, him and dad were pretty tight when he was around.” He winced at the unwanted memories and shoved them ruthlessly down before he could think too hard about his father. “What about his family? Are they just letting it go?” Sam sat down next to him, the chair squeaking against the linoleum. Dean was distracted for a second, thinking about how they really should put something on the chairs before the linoleum got ruined.
The ring of a bell signaled the end of his shift, loudly clanging through the roar of his music. He snatched up his coat, tossed a tool into the mess that was his tool box, and bellowed a farewell to his boss as he left. He clapped a hand against the shoulder of the mechanic trading shifts with him, wished him a good night, and was on his merry way. He slid into his car, a gorgeous ‘67 Impala, sleek black and glistening from a fresh waxing. The car roared to life with a rumble, subsiding into a smooth purr as he pulled away and raced off to his favourite bar.
He brushed off the rudeness of Dean when the human shoved past him, shouldering him out of the way roughly. He took a small sidestep toward one of the two tables in the room, looking around briefly to take in the sight of hundreds of drawings. He was almost impressed when he looked back toward the two humans. Dean was crouched next to Bobby, his hand pressing against the unconscious one to check his pulse. Castiel resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Instead he rifled through the pages of a book.
Castiel tenderly turned the memory over in his head, relishing the gentle beginning and rough end. Dean just vomited copiously for a while before he came out, shaking and pale. He urged Cass up with a touch to his arm, not even uttering a word. And there they stumbled with aching heads and heaving bodies into the kitchen. And now he was crammed into the too small backseat of the racing Impala. His wings ached something fierce, wanting to be freed from the confinement of the car.
Because of her antics, it was all too soon that they were paying up and the anxiety of the club started to creep under Castiel’s skin, making him fidgety. Outside the rain had dulled into a generous sprinkle, dotting their hair with tiny droplets. The club was within walking distance from the restaurant and she had parked in paid parking. He topped off their meter for the evening and offered Meg his arm, considering she wore high heels taller than his dreams.
The Hunter methodically worked through the process of cleaning up his mess, he dumped bleach on the bloodied ground then used a hose to wash the mix down a drain. He took an hour to burn and bury the body and another half hour to wash himself clean in a scorching hot shower that left his skin red and almost raw. When he stomped down the stairs to seek out a bottle of whiskey, he stumbled into the hard body of Castiel, standing at the bottom of the stairway. “Dean? Did you get the information you wanted?”
Dean crawled back over to the Angel, unable to see from a rapidly swelling eye. Damn that would be a wonderful shiner in the morning. He clamped a hand down on Castiel, creeping his fingers up to firmly hold onto his jaw. “Damn it Cass, you’ll choke on your own tongue, if you aren’t already!” The Hunter was panicking, his voice trembling as he shouted. He worked his hand into the mouth of Cass, yelling when the Angel bit down on his fingers. He pried his jaw back open, slipping the stained leather of his belt over Castiel’s tongue, holding it down.
Then Dean had awoken next. It was a process that fascinated Castiel, the process of waking up. His breathing had slowly eased away from the deep and slow pace of sleep, smoothed into the quicker breath of the waking world. When Dean woke, he started to move a little as his dreams eked away. His fingers fluttered restlessly, his legs flexed slightly, his lips moved with unspoken words and mumbles. When he finally blinked open sleep clouded eyes, they had been such a beautiful shade. A colour that he struggled to put word to, even with his vast knowledge as an Angel.
Castiel absently shook his wings with a flick, snow falling away in clumps. Dean worriedly noticed that a few feathers fell too, quickly lost in the white of the ground. “I felt caged inside, it was too stifling. I needed to stretch and think. It’s peaceful out here.” His voice sounded mournful, too soft and almost stolen by the wind. Dean felt a rush of guilt grip him hard but he shoved it aside as his remembered solution exploded back into his thoughts.
Castiel’s shirt was laying on the counter, already discarded, and he was in the process of removing his jeans. The yelp made him pause though, hands hovering over the undone zipper. “You said I cannot shower with my clothing on. I am removing my clothing,” he spoke slowly, confused with Dean’s behaviour. It dissipated with the explanation the Hunter offered, “You can take your pants off after I leave. We’re just gonna cover your wrings first, ok?” He nodded before turning sideways, letting his wings ease open loosely with a slight shake.
. It wasn’t overwhelmingly obvious, in fact he was suppressing much of the sounds and his face barely betrayed his emotion. It was only the wet trail down his cheek betraying the path of a tear and the nasally catch of his breathing unable to pass through his nose. Castiel hesitated at the realization, uncertain how to proceed.
He grinned when he saw the cashier bent over the counter, browsing through what looked like a catalog. He was a cutie for sure with messy black hair, looking as if he had just rolled out of bed. The cashier’s clothes were a bit strange though, a white button up with a backwards grey tie and a pair of black slacks. Nonetheless, Dean marched up to him, whistling merrily along to the tune in his head. He set down the anti-freeze, barely hearing the stuttered ‘hello’ before he breezed through the standard.
That same night, Cass had briskly explained he was there to help Dean. He barely let his words sink in before Dean was doubled over as his ribs burst with sudden pain. The Angel had etched enochian wards into the very bone of Dean and Bobby’s ribs; wards meant to hide the two from any searching demons or Angels. Remembering that awful pain, Dean absently rubbed a hand over his ribs until Cass coughed politely. “Dean? What do you want?” He repeated in a bored voice.
Castiel discovered in a short amount of time that hot water felt incredible. The water pressure was excellent, spraying hard against skin in a comforting way. It took some coordination to wash himself, his wings kept brushing against the wall, making the tape pull tight against his skin. He scanned the back of the bottle labeled ‘shampoo’, mouthing the directions before squirting a dollop into his hand, scrubbing it vigorously through his hair. He had to crane his head a bit to rinse the suds free, water hitting the plastic over his wings with a light pattering sound.
Dean sucked in a hard breath, harsh words just resting on the tip of his tongue, ready to be shouted or screamed. He opened his mouth, moments from spewing out the hateful sentences but then he blinked and all the fight drained out of the Hunter. Instead of speaking, he dropped the back of the chair and stumbled over to Bobby. A few gulps of whiskey, a muttered curse or two, and he was back to being the usual Dean. Which wasn’t saying much, the usual Dean was just wrecked but stubbornly determined.
“Ugh, today sucked.”
It didn’t take too long to remove the two radiator hoses to the cobalt, the pile of shredded and cut hoses steadily growing larger next to him. He was arms deep in the engine, trying to twist the end of the second hose off, when a shout startled him, his elbow banging painfully against something sharp. Dean swore loudly as jerked his arm out and cupped a hand against his throbbing elbow as he turned around to glare at Bobby, who was in turn glaring at him. If looks could kill, Dean would be dead.
Whomever it was, they argued viciously with Castiel and their raised voices were alarmingly loud in the crossroads. It wasn’t in a language that he recognized and he took a wary step forward. Castiel flinched at the crunch of boots, his too wide eyes turning toward Dean as if he had suddenly remembered him. The argument died down as Cass walked toward him, wings outstretched again, flared with his temper. Feathers rained down on the ground with each step.
He smoothed dull grey and muted blues over the scenery, which was a scarce few tufts of grass, a broken sidewalk, an angry sky with heavy clouds. When the clock turned from three in the morning to four in the morning, he cleaned up the paint, left the brushes in a pool of water, and collapsed onto his rumpled bed. Within a few minutes, his short stuffy snore filled the room, mixing into the forgotten music, still murmuring through the speakers. The painting was left to dry, crookedly laid across the desk. It was painstakingly realistic… except for the tufts of grass, coloured a muted grey, looking forgotten in the vibrant colours staining the rest of the page.
Castiel grabbed his own plate and took a seat next to her, where they ate in companionable silence while Rain begged pathetically from the floor, giving them the biggest puppy eyes ever known to man. She was ignored, her wiley charms already wasted on the pair; they were far too used to it. “Now, Clarence, tell me about our date. Can I at least dress you up all sexy? You already have the sex hair and your tattos are a magnet for trouble.” Meg talked with her mouth full, a habit that made him cringe.
He jerked open the door to the fridge, looked at his supply of beer for a brief moment and cursed loudly. There were only four bottles of beer left; actually, three now as he grabbed one and slammed the door shut. A twist of his wrist had the cap off and soon the cool liquid was gliding down his throat as he gulped a long pull down, absently wiping away a few clinging drops with the back of his hand. He worked his way over to the bed, flopping down with a groan (mindful to not spill his drink).
“Okay my dude, let me check if we’ve got it all, m’kay?” the cashier smiled awkwardly before ducking his head at the lack of response from Dean. He hurried uncomfortably away and was gone for what felt like forever but was less than 5 minutes. “Okay, um, your total will be, um, $253.77. You’re lucky you came in today, we had a sale on them hoses.” The boy babbled at Dean and tried another smile that went ignored again. Dean winced at the price but just jammed his card through the machine, sliding it down maybe a little too forcefully.
Together they wasted away the morning and afternoon with ease. Meg insisted they start re-watching Criminal Minds from the beginning; a show they’d already watched at least a dozen times over. She. as usual, acted as if she had never seen an episode before, excitedly babbling the entire time. He smiled at her antics as he started sketching out a new painting, the rough shapes and lines slowly turning into the body of his puppy, Rain.
Sam started to argue with him but the thought of popcorn seemed to wilt his resolve. He looked at his homework then back at Dean then sighed,“You’d better make two bags. You always eat all of it and I barely get any.” He stacked the mess up then hastily shoved his books and binders into his backpack before kicking it over to the front door so he could grab it in the morning. “You get the popcorn, I’ll put the DVD in.”
He curled up on the ground amid the shower of glass, hands clutching his head. The noise was too much, he felt like he might implode. And just before it was too much, the sound ceased entirely. He slowly pushed himself back up before he bolted out of the station, slamming a hand into the phone booth as he shoved himself inside. The first number was out of service. Damn it Sammy! Then Bobby cursed him with a threat to kill him, heightening his confusion at the aggression from Bobby.
“Get dressed, Cassie. We’re in for a fun night, the storm be damned.” She disappeared into the bathroom to freshen up while he got dressed. He purposefully took his time to get dressed, still casting worried looks to the window that lit up with flashes of lightning. The evening was still young, the sun not yet ready to set. But it was now a sickly looking yellow outside and the thunder continued with the heavy drum of the rain. He knew Meg would have to drive, the idea of driving in the dismal weather enough to make his heart speed up with fear.
Sam didn’t seem to notice his burned popcorn as he accepted a beer and started the movie, ignoring Dean’s complaints about their poor couch. The comforting sound of Galadriel filled the room and he reached over to turn off the lamp next to their couch, plunging the room into darkness, save for the glow of their small TV.
Sam opened a notebook to clean page, jotting his name at the top with the date, a motion now ingrained into him. He chewed at the end of his pencil, then continued in a grumpy voice. “I also have a five page essay due by next week. Or a rough draft at least. It’s over the most ridiculous myth possible. Do you remember Icarus and Daedalus? From high school? Or was the middle grade?” The last words ended in a musing tone as he tried to think back, hunting for a memory that was just out of reach.
Once he was inside, Dean made a beeline for the kitchen, for the cabinet that held too many bottles of whiskey. He poured himself a too generous glass of the amber liquid, throwing it back with a long pull, relishing the burn sliding down his throat. He had a daunting task before him, the task of teaching a broken Angel how to cope with his newfound humanity. Castiel was not stupid, in fact he was stunningly intelligent, but there was too many things he did not know. Too many things his grace had taken care of for him, doing the busywork of maintaining his vessel.
” The demon started to choke and gag now, throat convulsing as smoke oozed brokenly from his mouth. He gasped and heaved with desperation against the exorcism and he fell to his hands and knees as his body twitched viciously.
“You can take your offer and shove it up your ass, you pathetic leeching blister. Shove it up right next to that stake jammed up your oozing, disgusting ass.” His words bubbled and popped through the blood filling his mouth, dripping with venom, mixed freely with hate. Dean Winchester was such a fighter, it made Alastair grin ever wider as he carefully wiped his cheek clean with a conjured handkerchief.
“They’re ruling it as a suicide but they found his computer smashed to bits next to him. Sounds t’me like a robbery turned to murder.” Bobby’s  voice grew louder and his flat tone changed to disgusted and pissed to hell, his accent thickening into an angry drawl. “His cameras were broken, too. Like the bastard didn’t wanna be found. Lazy cops don’t wanna do their jobs. Who th’ hell just offs ‘emself after smashin’ their shit.”
He repeated the routine with the white bar he found, rubbing it over his skin until he was covered in a thick layer of soap. A few splashes of the hot water rinsed him clean, leaving him free to enjoy the feel of the shower. His muscles slowly loosened under the hard spray, he shifted enough to lean against the wall, pleased as his eyes closed. Cass didn’t know how long he stood there; it was long enough that his skin turned a shade of vibrant pink. But, in the space of one second to the next, the water flushed into an icy cold.
What happened next greatly puzzled Castiel. Dean went from staring at him with absolute hatred burning in his expression, to stumbling backwards in shock. The Hunter landed hard on his rear, hands scraping against the concrete that composed the floor of the structure. His eyes, an enchanting shade of bright green, widened with something akin to fear or perhaps wonder. Cass tilted his head toward the side, following the line of Dean’s stare. Then it was his turn to be confused.
Five months. It was nothing short of amazing how quickly time passed when someone worked themselves to the bone. Dean Winchester barely spent a week resting after discovering who had risen him from Hell before he launched himself into the draining task of being a solo Hunter. He worked case after case with barely a pause between. In fact his longest rest had been a week in the hospital after a Shifter broke his collar bone flinging him into a brick wall. If Cass hadn’t healed his miserable ass, he may have been there much longer.
It was awkward moments like this that Dean missed Sam the most. Castiel never offered more than the strictly necessary few words whereas Sam would banter and laugh with Dean through any hard case. The loss squeezed his heart as he rolled his shoulders, loosening the muscles that tightened when he felt nervous. “Alright chatty Kathy, let’s roll.” The machete was drawn with a smooth pull, the metal gleaming wickedly in the flare of lightning that lit up the warehouse every few seconds.
Dean watched as a man dressed in a trench coat marched his way into the shed, moving with a confidence that stuck even the cocky hunter. It looked like a human, one with scruffy black hair and eyes bright enough a blue to see from where Dean stood. A human that didn’t even flinch when Bobby and Dean started firing, shotguns recoiling in their hands. The lights overhead continued to explode in flashes of light, showering everyone beneath with sparks and glass. The man continued to walk at his sedate pace, staring down the Hunters with an intense gaze.
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice was almost hesitant, stopping Dean at the door with his hand extended toward the handle. “If you do not wish to be drenched, I can fly the two of us there in seconds.” Dean shifted his weight away from the door and turned to look at the Angel, standing with stiff discomfort. This was the first time he had ever offered to fly Dean anywhere. A moment’s glance toward the window and the sheets of freezing rain made his mind up. “Deal. I don’t feel like freezing my balls off.”
As the last of the word died in the air, Bobby leaned over and snatched up a sawed off shotgun loaded with rock salt shells. Dean stood at the ready, weapon raised defensively as he looked around the room frantically. The moment ticked by with agonizing slowness, fading into a minute, then five, then ten. With each passing minute, both Hunters started to relax a fraction. When it marked fifteen minutes past, Bobby muttered a curse and sat down on the table, resting his gun in his lap.
He dropped his shirt back down, the soft black fabric settling against his skin; he still wore Dean’s clothing from the night before. The new clothing Dean had given him was on the bed in a neatly folded pile, he couldn’t quite bring himself to change. Besides, he couldn’t find a knife or scissors in the room to make the shirts wearable. Cass let his wings settle back down, snug against his back, his nose wrinkling at the faint odor lingering about his body. He would have to ask Dean about it later.
He had slept the entire night and got a decent six hours worth of snoozing, but it felt like he hadn’t slept in a week! It was ridiculous. Maybe he was getting old at the tender age of 26. He narrowed his eyes at himself through the mirror, then rolled his shoulders and left to get a second cup of joe, breaking his usual routine of only having one cup. It made brushing his teeth seem useless as he winced against the acrid taste of toothpaste mixing with black coffee.
Dean blinked tiredly at his phone for a moment before standing up to get another cup of coffee. If he died from an overdose of caffeine, so be it. He also poured some for Sam since he had forgotten about it and added his fancy oat milk creamer. He said it was healthier than the usual coffee mate Dean bought when he wanted a little more flavor than half&half could offer.
This loosely follows Season 4 Episode 1. From here on out my story will only vaguely follow that of Supernatural.
Dean scrabbled furiously at the dirt, swiping it downwards to pile under him. Without his light, he worked blindly, digging upwards. Somewhere in his mind he thought of zombies that crawled free from their graves. Surely he wasn’t a zombie. Zombies would not be this sentient, would lack the clarity in which he thought with. He scooped and packed the dirt away, his chest squeezing painfully with the need to breathe.
Sam flipped the page over to the next one and continued the story, his voice bored. He had already read the myth through a few times today. “Icarus doesn’t listen to Daedalus and he started to fly too close to the sun. The wax melted and his feathers fell out until he couldn’t fly anymore. He ends up drowning in the ocean. Have you ever heard the phrase ‘Don’t fly too close to the sun’? That is called an ‘idiom’ and it basically comes from the story of Icarus.”
Please leave comments and/or kudos! :) I am putting a lot of work into the story and would love some feedback. I feel a bit awkward without anything to tell me how I'm doing.
Despite her efforts, he did not leave the club with a date or a man on his arm. Instead they stumbled out together arm and arm and dove head first into their uber, her parking meter forgotten and probably overdue. Meg slept on his bed while he took the couch, something he was due to regret by morning when his back was aching. His dreams were vague that night and he woke up thinking strangely of an unknown pair of forest green eyes and a spread of freckles looking like stars against tanned skin. Something unfamiliar but tempting.
When Dean reached the door of the station, he glanced briefly at the blue and white “CLOSED” sign. Ignoring it, he knocked noisily on the window, the door rattling faintly. He managed to croak out a “Hello?” as he waited a moment. Then he sighed and looked to the side, checking to see if anyone was around. His doubts were confirmed, nary a soul was in sight as the Hunter untied his coat and wrapped it around his hand. A firm smash sent glass flying inwards as the window broke easily.

,” he managed to pant out between a few labored breaths as the adrenaline slowly drained out of his blood. It made his hand shake as he cleaned his weapon and stuck it haphazardly hilt down in his pants, the point barely pricked at his back. “I thought you were dog chow, man.”
~_~_~_~_~_~_~
Sam sighed as he sat back down at the table and grabbed a pen. He might as well start his rough draft now. Dean would be in the shower for at least half an hour, if not longer. His brother was worse than a girl when it came to using up all the hot water in their tiny apartment. He looked down at the grainy picture of Icarus. It showed the man with wings falling through the sky, feathers surrounding him as he plunged toward the ocean. The picture made him uncomfortable for some reason and he quickly turned the page.
Instead he was greeted with the sight of Cass holding a bloodied angel blade, the boy dead at his feet. Dean sucked in a relieved breath, chest loosening just a fraction. He hadn’t even noticed it was so tight, so hard to breath. “That… that
The Angel and Hunter sat like that on the couch. Dean leaned into the warmth of Castiel’s wing, head drooping against his shoulder, his thumb lazily dragging against the back of the Angel’s hand. Castiel let his cheek rest against Dean’s soft hair, slowly breathing in the faint scent of his shampoo. They both soon gave way to the drag of sleep, alcohol still rushing through their veins like a thick drug. It erased the boundary that usually stood between them. And when Bobby found them slumped together on the couch, he just muttered ‘idjits’ and draped a blanket over the two, shutting off the light and carrying away the empty bottle of booze.
“Oh Dean, always a delight speaking with you my boy!” The demon licked his lips, wetting them with a touch of his tongue. “What do you want today? Whip or knife? Or maybe we can explore something more exotic?” His words dripped with a soft musical lilt as he lovingly fondled the instruments lain on a tray next to the rack. His hand paused over a knife, “I think I’m in a mood to carve,” he mused as his fingers folded gently over the blood stained handle.
~~~~~~
We're finally getting somewhere! I am sorry for the delay, I wasn't very happy with this chapter and re-wrote it like twice.
He spared a moment’s glance at the Angel, whose eyes were beginning to grow glassy, his wings drooping drunkenly around him. Cass offered him a sloppy nod and lurched forward, shoes scuffing against the ground as he followed Dean into the adjacent room. They dropped onto the couch together, it groaned under their weight. Dean twisted the cap off his bottle, taking a quick gulp before handing it off. “I’m sorry, man. I… I tried my best. But they aren’t guilty. For once.”
Dean lowered himself into one of the other chairs and circled his cold hands around the warmth of his own mug. He cleared his throat with a short cough before he launched into his explanation. “I uh, had a dream. Last night. It was about Sammy, uh, but you don’t need to know about that. Anyways, long story short, I think we can visit a Crossroads demon. A few years ago, Sammy and I took down one that Bobby had found. They grant ‘wishes’,” his fingers clawed the air in short air quotes, “for the price of your soul. Nasty bastards.”
Galadriel’s rich voice overtook the soft music, “The world is changed… I feel it in the water… I feel it in the Earth… I smell it in the air….”
Dean took a long draw from his beer, sighing happily as the cold liquid slipped down his throat. He immediately stole a handful of popcorn out of Sam’s bowl, earning himself a solid smack on his hand. They did that throughout the three hour long movie, bickering with each other between repeating the lines dramatically to each other. At one point, Sam was tipsily sprawled across Dean’s lap, dramatically repeating Gandalf’s powerful cry of, “You shall not pass!” and knocking the almost empty bowl of popcorn onto the ground, scattering the kernels across the carpet .Dean shoved him off, dumping him on the floor as they both cracked up during what should have been a somber scene.
The drone of his babbling voice was almost lost in the roar of the storm that lashed at the motel. Dean did not care in the slightest that he was babbling, the need to make noise was almost overwhelming as he methodically stripped the Angel. His fingers scrabbled at the knot of Castiel’s tie until it loosened enough to be pulled off, getting tossed aside carelessly. The shirt was too much for Dean with bother with, a few slices of a small pocket knife had it removed in under a minute. Another few minutes were used up in removing the ruined dress shoes Cass wore, socks following quickly. Then the Hunter leaned himself under Castiel’s arm and wing, leveraging the weight over Dean’s shoulder enough for him to pull the both back to standing.
~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~_~
Castiel Novak was, well, he was a little bit of something and a whole lot of nothing. Three days a week he goes to college, four days a week he works and works and works. Between each day he sleeps very little and draws too much, painting his life as it flies right by with a splash of colour here and a bold line there. His hands were always stained with flecks and swipes of paint, finger tips smudged with pencil and charcoal.
Today was just like every other day, rushing past him with barely a chance to breathe, leaving him to stumble along and hope he didn’t fall behind. His hands worked without rest, scanning and packing each item even as he faked a smile and cheer, eyes dancing with false happiness. Most barely responded to him, some mumbled a ‘thank you’ and ‘good day’, and a scarce few bothered to ask about his day, eyes sliding away even as they forgot his reply before it was spoken.
When it was clear their shotguns didn’t do the monster any damage, Dean and Bobby shared a look before bailing toward their arsenals on the tables. Dean grabbed the knife that extinguished demons, holding it tight against his back, hidden from the view of the monster. His breathing was harsh even to his own ears as he stared into the bright blue of the beasts’ eyes. “Wh-Who are you?” Dean asked aggressively, shoving down his fear to burn in the pit of his stomach.
oops i almost posted this on the wrong fix. bad me
“Of course you already knew where the vampire was,” Dean muttered when he finally looked around, recognizing the warehouse he had scoped out two days before. He was glad there was a machete already belted around his waist, left there from earlier. Castiel just stood with his serious eyes and stared at Dean, not offering a word of opinion as the Hunter floundered awkwardly. “It’s in the next warehouse, we can go through the door over there,” a flick of his hand pointed where, “and the guy nests down there.”
Dean slowly backed out of the bathroom, pulling the door almost shut as he left. A third towel lie crumpled on the bed, left there from washing his face that morning. He grabbed it, roughly toweling the fabric over his skin until he was mostly dried. He vaguely heard the sound of movement from inside the bathroom, something he took as a positive sign as he padded over to his duffel bag. The first set of clothes he fished out where quickly pulled on, catching slightly against his damp skin. It was nothing special, just a black t-shirt and another pain of well-worn jeans.
omg some actual destiel fluff. apologies if this chapter feels rushed, its like 1:30AM. :D
The cashier awkwardly packed up the hoses and receipt, “Um, have a good day, thank you for shopping at Advance.” The words ended up directed to Dean’s back as he hurried out of the shop, oblivious to his rude behavior, only aware of his irritation and need to hurry. He tossed the bag into the truck and back out of the parking lot with a screech, racing back to the highway.
“You were explaining something about a seal before it happened,” he offered when he looked up at Cass, now sitting next to Dean. His wings were folded tight against his body once more but now there was a noticeable damage, feathers sticking out, broken from his episode. Castiel’s expression darkened with confusion, his voice thick and slow. “A seal? I know nothing of a seal, beyond the fundamental requirement of seals such as those around doors.” His head tilted off to the side, that curious little movement that was purely Castiel.
Little did he know, as he began to climb through the trembling roots of the fallen trees, his progress was being watched. Two piercing blue eyes studied the back of Dean Winchester, tracking him as he cleared the destruction and marched North. With an emotionless expression, Castiel turned away and launched himself with a powerful flap of his wings. Only a soft swoosh of feathers marked his departure.
“Oh shit, yeah, you’re going to need some stitches.” Dean whistled low in sympathy as he dug out a needle and thread from the kit. He stuck the end of the needle in the fire for a moment then wiped the blackened end. “This is gonna hurt like a bitch.” He stuck his tongue out absently as he threaded the needle with a mumbled curse or two. “Like really hurt.” He clarified when Cass didn’t reply, something he was getting used to from the guy. It took less than ten minutes to stitch and bandage up the cuts, a stretch of white gauze secured around Castiel’s chest.
“How soon can we be there?” He asked after a moment of silence, a new determination turned his formerly dull gaze back to burning bright with renewed energy. His shame at his emotional outburst faded away, taken by his eagerness. Dean smirked at him, relieved to see him perking up a bit and amused at the rush of different emotions the Angel displayed. He took a quick gulp of his own coffee and pushed away his now empty mug.
“Okay, Clarence, loosen up or I’ll get arrested for kidnapping.” Meg chastised him as she thankfully took his offered arm, fingers curled loosely around his forearm. “And before you say it, yes, I know you aren’t a kid nor am I ‘napping you.” She wrinkled her nose at him and avoided stepping in a puddle. He caught the door to the club for her and she murmured something sarcastic about him being a gentleman.
He deduced the alcohol had broken the inhibitions that prevented the Hunter from previously breaking down. The two of them had nearly drained the bottle by now, only a few sips left in the clear glass. He worried his bottom lip with the press of his teeth, biting absently in a gesture learned from Dean. What was he supposed to do? What was the human approach to grief, to pain, sorrow? He did not know what was appropriate and he was slowed down with the drunken weight of whiskey.
“Forgive me, I must leave to investigate this mystery. I apologise that you sustained injury during my attack.” He rose while speaking, cautiously extending his wings in a slow stretch. They quivered for a moment in an unfelt breeze before rising and falling in a powerful beat. Yet, instead of disappearing with that tell-tale sound of feathers through air, the Angel instead dropped to his knees with an inhumane scream that shattered the windows of the warehouse. Dean slapped his palms over his ears, a scream ripped free as blood immediately rushed from his nose and ears.
By the time he was walking back into the shop, it was a quarter to 9 and his time was dwindling. It didn’t really take long to replace and reconnect hoses but if the client came back early, he would be screwed. Bobby seemed to have vanished during his trip to town and he was thankful to avoid the disapproval. He wasted no time, immediately getting to work on the replacement. And still, those same few seconds of song kept repeating over and over in his head, as if to mock him.
Dean dug his way through the rest of the boring history, trying to figure out how the church fit in with this oil empire of a family. He clicked out of the wiki to poke through a few obscure news articles detailing the successes of the oldest son, Michael Novak. It sang the praises of how he was a brilliant businessman who graduated with high honors from Harvard. There were plenty of the same style of articles, all of them about this singular son, the eldest of the bunch and arguably the most successful. He hummed with the radio, now playing some Metallica, something he was thankful for. Nothing like ‘Enter Sandman’ to keep him going!
With a frustrated curse he used a rag to wipe his hands mostly clean of oil and engine grease, throwing it down in a pile of dirty rags. Today was simply not his day. First he had accidentally touched a live wire, singing his hand with the sharp sting of electricity. Next he’d banged his head against the underside of a car when some jackass revved their engine outside, startling him even through his music. There was a small cut on his temple as a result. It had bled like crazy for nearly ten minutes. And now he had to go to the front for some stupid brand, which meant dealing with the cashier while they rang it up under his name. That always took forever.
Hey, welcome to the story. I'm very sporadic about updating. Some days I may post more than one chapter. Sometimes I may go a few days without an update. Everything is posted as I write it. I also do very little editing, I just write and toss it up on here. So my apologies for any errors. Comments+Kudos are appreciated! I especially like comments. I want to know how my story is, how my writing is, etc.
He followed her reluctantly, “What my, ahem, uh..” He trailed off uncomfortably, then gave up on it with a huff of annoyance. “If she makes a mess while we are gone, you are cleaning it up,” he threatened weakly. Meg ignored him and pulled out a pair of skinny black jeans, a navy button up and the aforementioned pair of boots. She dropped the clothes on his messy bed then tousled his hair lightly, ruffling up the already messy curls with an affectionate hand.
Castiel was frozen to the spot, lost in the bright green eyes of an oil stained mechanic. The world finally felt complete, the missing piece slotting easily into his life. He finally had what he was missing, the bright colour that stained the trees and the grass. It was in the green of Dean’s eyes, looking like what he imagined two leafs plucked fresh from a tree would look like. Cass took a deep breath before he managed, “I think I’m going to kiss you.”
They climbed into the impala and Dean almost flicked the heat on but abstained at the thought of the stinky first heater smell. Besides, it wasn’t that cold outside. Instead he switched the AC off and rumbled away, the GPS instructing him down some familiar backroads. He had never actually heard of the church, Freewill Baptist, but the roads were something he often raced down when the itch for speed became too overwhelming.
