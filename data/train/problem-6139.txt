He woke up with a start. Someone was trying to move him from his cosy spot on his Mama. He opened his eyes to glare at whoever it was. His Daddy just made a silly face back at him when he noticed Peter was awake.
Harley squeezed him tighter. “Don’t be silly Peter. I’m sorry for ignoring you, even if I didn’t know I should have been aware of how sad you were. How about this? Tomorrow we can go to that ice cream place you like and get some? I’m sure your Mama and Papa won’t mind coming as well.” Harley knew full well they wouldn’t let Harley take him all the way to Queens himself. Peter might have said that Harley was an adult but Harley knew that was Tony’s only way of explaining why he had more freedoms.
Although if he was being strictly honest, he wouldn’t mind taking a few aspects of this life with him, such as Tony and Steve being his parents and having a little brother as cute as Jamie. He didn’t need the whole baby thing though. He was wearing a diaper for goodness sake, one that he was adamant he wasn’t going to use in any way! He’d demand they bring him to the bathroom. Then there was the fact that he wasn’t allowed to call Tony and Steve anything besides Mama and Dada. He blushed thinking about it. Every time he tried to call them Steve or Tony though all that came out was Dada and Mama. As if his brain couldn’t wrap his head around the words at all. This was hurting his brain. He needed to stop thinking about it.
“I need you to know Pete that you are the most important person in my life. More than anyone else. I’m sorry. No matter if I didn’t realise I was doing it, I’m still sorry I made you feel that way. You have to know that I love spending time with you. Being with you and Papa and Harley is the best part of my days. I’m sorry if we ignored you today in the car and any other time we did it. I promise that I’ll try my best to never do it again and if I slip up I want you to call me out for it straight away.”
“What’s wrong doll?” he asked, rubbing a hand down his bare back. Tony just grumbled and snuggled closer into Bucky, making himself comfortable. Steve rolled his eyes at the obvious display.
“I think he’ll be my baby brother,” Peter said smugly and Bucky couldn’t handle it anymore he opened his mouth to tell him to shut his mouth but all that came out was a wail. Once the first sob slipped through he was done and couldn’t stop. He didn’t even notice the arms around him until his head was being pushed into a solid chest that had to be Steve’s. He wrapped his arms around his neck and cried out his troubles, tensing when he realised in the middle of his crying he didn’t remember to concentrate on his bladder. He’d let go without realising. He stopped crying for a second and looked at Steve who was grimacing at the wet heat but looking sympathetic at the same time. “Oh, baby. Let’s go get you cleaned up.”
Steve watched Tony as he tried not to move too much and control his pleasure for the next five minutes. He could barely see the tip of his cock touching the shirt and slightly tenting it. Peter wouldn’t notice a thing. It was one of the upsides of Omega’s. Their cocks were small enough that being hard with just a shirt on was passable.
“Knew you’d be great at this life baby.” Steve murmured, giving him a kiss on the temple before the two of them turned to watch Clint now being fucked by Bucky. Watching them got him squirming again. At least he’d have no issue staying hard if Bucky and Clint were going to be around. He’d count that as a win.
Long time I know! This chapter went in a way I didn't know It would but sure look that's half the fun. I was going to leave it on a cliff hanger but I hate when that's done when I'm reading a story so you're welcome 😂
“Mr Parker, if you don’t calm down, I’ll be forced to make a call.” He professor said finally, sick of Peter’s jitters. Peter calmed down straight away, trying his best not to glare at the man. Papa rang one day and told the school that Peter’s final warning was that they were going to make a call. It was a sure fire way of getting him to focus because if he didn’t heed the last warning and continued on then they would actually make the call and Peter would have a red bottom by the end of the day. Sometimes it was worth it. Not today though, today he could very likely get the privilege of sweets taken off him which would be devastating.
The lady tapped away on the stark pad in front of her. Now Peter was sure his Mama owned this place. They had his tech here!
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, strapping Peter into his highchair to go over and see what was wrong with Bucky. Bucky, seeing his Mama, put his arms out for him. “Why are you traumatising my child?” Tony asked, taking Bucky out and rocking him.
“Such a good boy aren’t you? Protecting your Alpha from the mean Omega. I think your heroics deserve a treat? What do you say?” He asked, running his hand firmly up and down the shaft. Tony whimpered but this time for a different reason. His cock was way too sensitive after the number of orgasms he’d had that day. He was worn out. If the shitstorm with Clint wasn’t about to go down Tony was nearly positive that he would be asleep in Steve’s arms right now.
“I get that you’re upset Petey. This has been a big change for you. We were the same when he realised we remembered. Do you know the only thing that kept me going back then?”
“We’ll go with 25 for now I think, make it less confusing for everyone.” Cho smiled and wrote something down.
He watched as his Dada closed his eyes and looked to be saying something under his breath before opening them and looking sternly at Peter.
“Okay well, the results show that he’s a young little. Probably around the 9-12 month mark. He shows some cognitive ability and is able to recognise people he cares about but he’s still young enough that seemingly simple tasks elude him when he’s little.”
“Already? I thought I’d have more time to get lunch ready. Think you could take over for me?” He asked, gesturing to the makings of the pasta he was putting on, smiling his thanks at the incline of Natasha’s head before leaving to see to his Omega.
“Want Mama!” Jamie cried, his arms out for the man. Peter began to cry as well, looking for Mama, getting a sigh off of Dada.
“Keep going Stark.” Bucky rolled his eyes, which went wide in alarm when Steve’s other arm went around his waist to lift him slightly off the seat so that his bottom was exposed before he received a light swat on it.
Steve and Tony moved closer together so Peter could get a photo of them, Tony putting up bunny ears on Steve’s head and Steve nudging Tony in the ribs because he knew what Tony was up to, causing Tony to lean forward slightly, laughing. Peter snapped the picture quickly, delighted with the way it turned out.
“Bottom is red but no issue there,” Bruce said, brushing his ass before pulling his cheeks apart. Clint flushed at the smell of his own scent hit him. He heard Bucky inhale deeply and could feel his erection poking his side. “Okay Clint, I’m going to put two fingers in to check back here,” Bruce warned before he felt Bruce’s fingers placed against his hole. Two of them sinking in easily. “Good amount of slick,” Bruce’s fingers pushed in further angling up and Clint couldn’t help but buck up into his hand, moaning loudly. Bruce had just nailed his prostate and the pleasure blackened his vision. Feeling Bruce stretch his two fingers and pushing against his prostate had him trying to ride the fingers, getting a laugh from Bucky.
“But I don’t want it done here!” Clint burst out. No way was he going to get this horrible exam done in the kitchen. He’d rather not do it at all!
“I have to keep being the favourite some way. It just so happens this is an easy way. C’mere champ. I have a few things for you.” He ignored the pointed look that Steve sent him and opened his arms to let Peter jump into them.
“And- and they just ignored me the whole way home Papa. Mama doesn’t want to spend any time with me at all because Harley is here. Do you think Mama likes Harley better than me?”
“Okay, into bed you go. Bucky off the bed, please. Pick a book for Peter.” Steve said, shooing Bucky from the bed to get Peter snuggled in.
Tony shrugged, looking down at the picture he snapped. You couldn’t see Peter’s face, only his mop of curly brown hair and his slight build. The main focus of the picture was Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist and the glare he was giving the camera. It was made even better that Peter was in his Ironman Pyjamas. It would be the perfect photo for Peter’s profile as it kept what he looked like hidden along with showing that it wasn’t a spoof account.
“Awh, Baby, don’t be upset. You’ll have all day tomorrow and the next day and night with Harley.” Peter didn’t respond, afraid that if he opened his mouth he’d start crying and he didn’t want to seem like a baby in front of Harley.
Steve was in his and Tony’s room, sitting on the rocking chair they had in there, with Peter on his lap. Peter loved the comfort of rocking on it.
Steve grinned up at Clint. “I had this specially made for Tony. I have a rule that he can only come on my cock or not at all.” He unlocked the three little hinges on the box and stopped before opening it. “I want to both of us to have something to eat but Tony’s heat is more intense than I expected. With this, he gets to come as much as he wants and I’m free to move about so I can get some food into us without being out of commission with being tied together.”
“Yes, he’s in Steve’s arms. It’s one of those hiding who they are. He’s crashing at the moment, you know how it is.” Tony smiled at the woman who luckily caught on.
Bruce looked at the result of the vial and wrote something on his sheet before looking back at Clint with a small smile. “Awesome. Let’s move onto the physical. Can you stand up for me?” He asked, raising a brow when Clint’s hand shot out to clutch onto Bucky. “Bucky can stay with you. He can even still hold you if you like. I just need you standing for one or two things.”
“I think the needle went in when you were looking at Steve. That probably took up most of your attention and I don’t blame you. Steve can be pretty scary.” Said Bucky, twisting his wrist and drawing a groan from Clint. Steve grinned over Tony’s head.
“So what? I can’t go back to work?” Tony didn’t think he could do that. “Steve, I’d go crazy within a day. You have to let me into my lab. Please.” He nearly choked on the word but the thoughts of staying out of his lab for another week sent a bolt of fear through him. Steve hushed him and was quick to reassure him.
Steve was halfway across the field before he realized that he was running. There was a sharp tremor dancing in his fingers, and it doubled in intensity as the whine of Tony’s repulsors filled the air. In his mind’s eye, he could clearly see the glove of the Iron Man suit pointed at his chest. Steve’s steps stuttered, but he managed to right his footing before he fell on his face.
Steve’s right eye twitched in annoyance as soft, plush carpet hugged his toes, cradling his full weight. He hated fighting barefoot. The muted sound of Dorothy Lamour’s “You’ll Never Know” played in the background, growing more loud and clear with each step he took. A tremble danced in Steve’s fingers, and he quickly shook it off. He knew this song. It had been a popular tune with the dames left behind waiting for their soldiers to come home. Steve had listened to the song once with Peggy, and he would never forget how the soft light of the bar lanterns had framed the lovely sheen in her eyes before she blinked, and it disappeared.
“Peggy,” Steve croaked, finally finding his voice. He found himself mesmerized by the burgundy color staining her lips. He slid a trembling hand across the table, fingers stretched out in a silent plea, but the gesture wilted and died as his eyes fell upon the soft curve of her belly.
The boy was a physical manifestation of Steve’s dearest dream, and he was perfect in every way. Steve reached out and touched the boy’s cheek with shaky fingers. He glanced back at Peggy, desperate for any sign from her, be it confirmation, or simple support. He noted that her belly was flat, and the sight made his nerves itch. Steve pushed Peggy from his thoughts and turned back to the boy.
The scent liquified Steve’s body down to his bones, and he felt himself melt into the mattress and become one with the memory foam. He closed his eyes and allowed himself a long moment of relaxation. It had been so long since he’d slept in a real bed, and even longer since he’d had the luxury of wrapping himself in bedding washed in the Gain detergent that Tony favored so much.
“Rogers, answer me!” he cried, his voice raw and desperate. “Stevie, you answer me right now goddamnit! I’m almost there!”
Steve lost himself in battle. His muscles screamed for relief, his lungs were one breath away from bursting at the seams, but he kept rolling along. Bucky had permanently opened the comms, and Steve could hear him singing the Army hymn as he fought. Each cadence call stimulated Steve’s tired mind, and when the world finally bled into a whirlwind of swirled colors and acerbic aromas, Bucky’s voice was the only thing that guided Steve forward.  Finally, just when the darkness framing the edges of his vision threatened to take over, his shield tore through the last drone in the western quadrant.
Tony spent most of his free time watching the news in his new lab and keeping watch. He hated that he felt like the proverbial mother left at home while her family went to war. He wanted to be there for his team. He needed to lend his support, to help where he could, to fight by them. He’d drop everything and
He heard Pepper sigh and move away from the window. Her heels made no sound as she walked to stand in front of him, and Tony noted that her face was dry. She gave him a long, assessing look that stirred his insides, and he braced himself for the impact of her decision.
He sighed and turned over on his side, willing his body to go back to sleep. It was an uncharacteristic move for Tony, but he wasn’t ready to tackle the weirdness that had infected his life. Maybe by morning, after a pot of coffee, he’d be coherent enough to care enough that he’d lost his girlfriend and gained a new roommate whose eyes were more haunted than Tony’s own.
Tony-dupe reached out and took Steve’s hands within its own. Its eyes were bright with adoration. “Your resolve is what drew me to your heart, Steve Rogers. You’ve had my fascination since the day your heart found its resolve.” Tony’s shade squeezed Steve’s hands. “Thanos thinks himself a self-made god, but he’s nothing but a weak impression of power. He could never command one such as I, even though he is trying his hardest to do so as we speak.”
Tony-dupe sighed and offered Steve a tired smile. “Walk around, explore. Spend some time with your son.”
Steve took in a ragged breath.  “Take Stark and go, Queens!” he commanded, his voice breaking at the end. A chorus of voices rushed over the comm line.
It was his duty to carry the essence of his lost comrades to the end of his line. Dead soldiers always lived on within those who still breathed, still fought. On and on the essence of dead soldiers were passed amongst survivors, until finally, a brave heart would tow them all past the finish line. He wondered, not for the first time, which poor soul would inherit his scarred spirit.
“I guide the energies of the lost…onward. Where I take them depends on the person. There are multiple heavens, Steve, and an endless number of hells.”
Tony-duped laughed, the sound deep and throaty. “Well, now, it would be rude of me to ruin a surprise, wouldn’t it?”
Steve attempted to swallow down the large ball of emotion that had lodged in his throat, but it was a futile gesture. He slowly turned his body, and his stomach clenched as he locked eyes with Tony. He was dressed in a pair of stone-washed jeans and a gray raglan shirt with red sleeves. The look was comfortable, but uncharacteristic of what Tony Stark was known to wear. The outfit that he donned was something that Steve had always secretly wished to see him wear, if only just to see Tony in something that was normal to Steve.
A chill raced up Steve’s spine, settling at the base of his skull, and he fisted the powder blue sheets still covering his legs with a desperate grip. He remembered dying in Tony’s embrace near the borders of Wakanda. Death had shut down Steve’s body, and it was a sensation that he had never experienced before, not even when the Arctic Waters had entombed his body. The freezing water had lulled Steve to sleep, pulling a blanket over his mind as it slowed the beats of his heart to a mere memory of a crawl. He’d floated for years, drifting in silence.
Steve stared at Tony-dupe for a long moment, trying hard to ignore the heat flooding his face. He felt stripped bare by its stare, and it was a type of vulnerability that he hadn’t felt since childhood. A gaggle of goosebumps erupted along the length of his arms, stretching out to the middle of his back. For a moment, he could feel the bitter cold that snuck in through the large crack in his window and set up shop in his childhood room. No matter how many pieces of wet paper his mother attempted to stuff it with, it was never enough to keep out the elements. The last thing that Steve had felt at night during the Winter months was the cold kiss of Winter’s breath as it pushed through his threadbare blanket.
A choked laugh rumbled in Steve’s throat, but he was spared from replying by Sam finally touching ground. His gear was battered and charred, and Steve caught sight of a significant tremor throbbing in his friend’s arms, pushing against the dried blood caked to Sam’s skin.
“I suppose I could try to isolate the flow of time around the wound. It may buy us a moment so we can attempt to treat him.”
He took in a short, choked breath, and it tore through his body like a bullet, leaving a trail of disintegration in its wake. “Looks like I’m finally going home,” he meant to say, but what came out was, “H-home.”
“You touched the dirtiest part of your face, young man, and that action warrants another good hand washing – with lots of soap.”
Natasha snorted and cupped the sides of his face. “Come back to us, Steve. Bring Bucky if you want.”
Steve stilled in his steps in the doorway and let his weight drop against the doorframe. A long minute passed before he finally answered. “I just followed the light.”
Natasha’s left eye glistened with emotion, which Steve ignored as a courtesy to his friend. He sat up and pressed a kiss to her temple. “Go to Fury and meet up with Clint and Scott,” he urged. “Make sure their families are still safe. Find Wanda and make sure she finds her way to the safehouse. I’m going to need you all at your best to help T’Challa strategize with T-Stark. Most importantly, get some shut eye for me. I’m pretty tuckered out.”
A dry laugh rumbled in Steve’s chest, and he tucked its remnants deep into his memory. He saw Bucky run toward a large mob of drones, bright sunlight encasing his metallic arm with a deadly gleam. It was ironic that an antiquated future, in the form of two worn out super soldiers, was all that currently stood against a future that no man had ever dared to envision.
“I'm in here.” He calls, practically vibrating with the anticipation of meeting this person. The tap tap tap of dress shoes sounds down the hallway, announcing the arrival of a man slightly shorter than Tony himself. He's a little broader though, dark skinned with warm brown eyes and close cropped hair. Tony sucks in a breath, the mug rattling in his hand.
“I, Tony-” He's standing in front of Tony before he can catch up to his own intention to move. It has been three months since they started this; Steve has faced down countless enemies, but somehow laying himself bare is so much more frightening. “Tony, oh
“Hi,”  He said, turning to Steve, holding out his arm for Steve to clasp if he so chose, “we’re the Avengers, and someway, somehow, you must be Captain America.”
The walk back to the mansion feels short with the buzz of Steve's nerves unhelpfully carrying him along. He places the flowers in the cold, ignoring Natasha's pointed glances from where she's perched at the kitchen table as he does so.
“Sure ya’ are,”  Steve said, smiling, “Only one Tony Stark out there, fella, that makes you pretty special in my book.”  Maybe wearing his heart on his sleeve wasn’t the best way to go about things, but as all the Invaders never hesitated to tell him, he was a lousy liar.
“Uhhhhh.” Points for intelligence Stark. Steve is starting to hunch in on himself, and that is just not on. “Is that Tiramisu?” He asks for lack of a better starter.
Steve curses floridly, pulling back from Tony to dig the offending thing out of his pocket. Tony's head is tipped back on the couch, eyes wide and stunned, but he seems to shake himself. He's so intent on the little card he almost misses the flashing light at the corner of Tony's tech glasses.
“Yes, amazing, your hands always feel so good.” Tony says, low and hot as Steve rubs broad palms over his flanks. His touch is light, but Tony still shivers, closes his eyes and pants open mouthed when Steve presses their hips together.
“Always have time for you Cap, don't tell anyone else but you're my favorite.” Tony whispers conspiratorially in the way only those on their way to being soused can.
“Well sure, she’d tell me off for talking her up, but she’s not here for her head to get too big, so I can say what I please.” He said, smiling when that startled a laugh out of Tony. “The first thing you need to know about Sarah Rogers is that she took no lip from anyone, and she was the best alpha I’ve ever met,” He touched his fingers on the glass over her familiar face. It wasn’t as hard to talk about her as it once was, and he would’ve liked to have thought she would be proud, seeing the man he’d become.
Not far from where he crouched there was another building, the doors to it had long fallen off, but it was positioned near a fairly unstable looking chunk of outer wall. Steve eyeballed it, and edged around to grab a flashbang from inside the weapon cart, hurling it into the open doorway, and then crouching down once more. As expected, Zemo raised his gun in alarm, barking out orders to his assembled henchmen to investigate the smoking doorway. Of course, he’d never go himself, and Steve had been counting on it. With the last of the men in the building, Steve let his shield fly with all his strength, hurling it at the crumbling stone wall near the entrance, it collapsed with a resounding thud, spilling bricks and dusty mortar over the doorway, trapping Zemo’s men inside, and leaving he and the baron alone.
“Steve,”  He said, climbing into the passenger side, “I trust you with my life on the field, of course I do.”  He smiled easily, as if he wasn’t just casually speaking to Steve’s heart.  “I trust you to keep me safe.”
. Iron man's words filter back to him as he catches sight of the moon outside his window. Steve heads to the gym. He doesn't sleep that night, too afraid he'll wake and another seventy years will have passed.
There's too much banging around in his head. Ideas and inspiration warring with his mortal terror of this uncharted territory with Steve. In the end he knocks out bent over his worktable, head pillowed on his arms, a coffee mug resting by his left elbow. He dreams of blue eyes and a warm hand resting on his cheek.
A short span of minutes passes before Iron Man is stepping into the room with him. The slump in his shoulders is gone, a new reactor glows brightly out of the armors chest. “You alright Shellhead?” he asks, but Iron Man doesn't reply, stepping close instead to adjust the icepack on his arm before speaking.
Cap holds a quelling hand out.  “Plan please, what are his abilities? Would be nice to know before you draw his attention.” Steve says, and that's his Captain America voice for sure.  In the suit Tony grins, firing the repulsors to hover just above the team. The carnival looks completely untouched, save for the Ferris wheel rotating and glowing at a truly alarming speed. Tony calculates it a few times between one breath and the next, quickly coming to the conclusion that they are about to have a spinning wheel of death thrown in their direction.
They make it to the Pinkberry before Tony realizes that he's managed to be in a car being chauffeured around without needing to do deep breathing exercises, or distract himself from the trip. It blindsides him, causing the breath to stutter in his chest. Steve catches his wrist, rubbing his fingers over his rabbiting pulse.
“Talk it over, let me know when we have a plan.” Natasha says, gesturing around the room pointedly. The space fills with the sound of shuffling feet and clothing as the rest of the team slips out. Natasha pauses just before leaving, fixing Tony with a sharp stare. “Thor is right you know, we'll fight for you, don't be an idiot.” She's gone after that, disappearing off on silent feet and leaving the room just as quiet in her wake.
“Captain America, you idiot, that's Captain America, and you or whatever the hell you're involved in nearly caused a major injury to an Avenger.”
“Steve-are you-are you sure you only want to sleep?” Tony speaks slowly, the hand he has on Steve's abdomen trailing a tiny fraction lower.  Steve catches that hand up in his own, turning back over and getting comfortable with Tony against his back. If they keep this up both of them won't get any sleep, and there is absolutely no way Steve will put his dick's inclinations above Tony's need to rest, no matter how hard and aroused he is.  Besides, it isn't as if he's not almost perpetually interested in Tony's presence. He thinks Tony could get him this keyed up with just a look, just a touch.
“Cap-Steve, he's such a good guy. He's...he's amazing, and me I'm-I'm” Tony falters, scrubbing a shaking hand over his face again before shoving both hands in his pockets and hunching over on the couch.
“How's that?” He manages to get out, the low gravelly cadence of his voice surprising even to himself.  “Does it feel good?” He asks, turning his fingers to stroke around, until he's rubbing right up against a spot he knows well in himself, hopefully Tony likes it as much as he does. Tony's eyes widen, and his cock jumps, leaking precome out messily over Steve's abs.
“It's fine, I get it.” He croaks, letting his legs slip back down to the floor. It doesn't work out so well though, because Steve is still holding him up. His legs dangle for a moment, before Steve gets the memo and slowly sets him back on his feet.
Gal follows him into the house as if she belongs there. Tony wonders if the person who takes care of the house when he's not there has been letting her inside. He hopes so. It gets pretty cold here, and the thought of his new fluffy friend braving the elements is not a pleasant one. One of the kitchen cupboards proves to contain several cans of fancy wet cat food. Tony opens the can for Gal and sets it out, watching her eat enthusiastically before setting out to explore his surroundings.
“Yeah,” Steve said, swallowing the sudden lump in his throat, “headed back home now, safe and snug as a bug in a rug.” It was such a simple statement, going home, but it meant so much. Ever since coming out of the ice he’d felt adrift, like some castaway on a sinking raft. The flight back to the mansion felt like sighting land at last. The team was there, waiting for him to come back, Tony was there, and worrying about him from the sounds of it. There was something to come back to, a real home, and a purpose to boot. Even the encroaching drop didn’t feel as ominous as he sat back and engaged the autopilot for New York. “See you soon, Iron Man.” He said, and settled in for the rest of the flight.
“I'm not, I'm not. I wouldn't laugh at you, not about this.” Tony says hastily, holding his hands up in a quelling motion. Tony doesn't think that Steve is a virgin, but he's definitely not the type to talk about sex and intimacy openly. This has to be difficult for him, whatever he's getting at.
As if reading his mind, Steve joins him in the garage where he's been waiting-looking so sharp in his tux that Tony feels like he might put an eye out if he stares too long. Steve seems to be having the same problem. He smiles so brightly that Tony thinks the sun must still be out after all instead of setting as the laws of nature dictate.
“Let me up you big patriotic octopus or I'm gonna-” Tony yawns so widely his eyes water. “gonna fall asleep on you. You won't like me when I'm sleepy.”
“Natasha, Hulk, Jan, my occasional child Underoos, Thor, and-” Tony stops to look at his hand as if he has something written on it. “Clont.”
“Nothing about me is little Shellhead.” Steve says as cheerfully as he can manage, sitting down on the ground and gesturing at himself with his good arm. Iron Man stares at him momentarily before crouching at his side.
On the way down Steve is momentarily startled by a door being thrown open to spill light out into the hallway. The scent of something spicy and warm fills the space, Steve looks over to see that he's being watched with great interest.
Hours later Tony has returned from work, and they're in one of the many sitting rooms scattered around the house. The others are somewhere in the house, he thinks he heard something about a tv night.  But it's just he and Tony in this room now.  Tony is bent over a holo-screen gesticulating with one hand and holding another one of his atrocious smoothies in the other.
“Looking awfully grumpy there, handsome.” Tony's warm tones draw him up short. He's leaning in a doorway, all insouciant grace and languid poise. Steve feels the tips of his ears go hot when Tony meanders closer and drapes an arm over his shoulder. Steve doesn't shrug it off the way he might have once. Not now, not when there's this
“Yes, I'll marry you Steve, oh my god! I love you!” Tony snickers when Steve dips him, and kisses him again. They're both naked, sated from sex and more than a little messy, but it couldn't matter less. “Oh my god, we're getting married!” Tony gasps, breaking away from the kiss and stroking over Steve's face.
“Tony, c’mon, you’re not heartless.” He came closer, and after some mental deliberation, rested his hands on Tony’s shoulders. “You can’t fool me, smart guy, I know you’ve got a big heart beating away in there.” He thought of Tony’s heart, destroyed and then replaced, his strength, his courage. No, he didn’t think heartless described Tony Stark at all.
“You’re coming to bed with me?”  He said, elated by this possibility, unable to think of why that might be incorrect.
“Nah.” He murmurs, reaching out to brush dark hair away from covering Tony's eyes.  “Just think you'd look better in red.” He pauses, eyes sliding over Tony's body thoughtfully. “Or maybe blue. Always thought you'd look pretty in blue.” Tony chokes, shoulders shaking with laughter. Steve sighs, he wonders if stripping naked and showing up on Tony's bed would work. Nothing else seems to be doing the trick.
“Tony, hey man, you with us again?” That's another new voice, warm, full of worry and the slightest hints of exasperation. Tony feels the inexplicable urge to show this man he's doing just fine, even if he's really
“I've never seen someone that likes frozen sweets as much as you Cap-but I'm surprised you want spumoni, would have thought it would be butter pecan ice cream.”  Tony says, sounding fondly amused.  Steve
“Oh!  No,” Tony laughed, touching over the gold with one gloved finger.  “Gift from a very good friend, I wear it for good luck when I have shareholder meetings.  Rhodey is a peach, you’d get along, I’m sure of it.”  He looked so fond when he spoke of his friend.  It was sweet, vulnerable in a way you might not think a fella like Tony Stark might be.  It was also encouraging in a way, Tony definitely accepted jewelry.  Maybe the cufflinks wouldn’t be as off the mark as he’d thought.
“I am so ready for this.” Tony says immediately, having apparently been waiting for Steve just outside the elevator.
Tony is so gorgeous, so beautiful. If Steve could touch him, he would palm down the line of his back, feel the way his lean muscled body is flexing against him, touch the smooth texture of his skin. God maybe one day Tony will come just like this, all over him, rubbing up against his hip. Steve moans just at the thought of it, his hips hitching up off the bed and rocking Tony up against him. The hand Tony had on the pillows moves to curl around the back of his head, Tony settles more solidly atop him, catching Steve's mouth in a kiss, swallowing more sounds Steve can't help but make.
“It's too late, it's done, it's over and he's gone. I'm just sorry you all paid the price for my sentimentality.” Tony mutters, hiding his face against Steve's chest. He thinks of all the things he could say to that, worthless platitudes that won't mean anything to Tony right now. Things that speak of how they have both failed each other in these painful weeks apart. It all rings hollow compared to what he really wants to say.
“You've got something,” he murmurs, turning his palm slightly, and Tony sucks in a ragged breath. He has touched Tony like this before, but something about this moment makes it different. He wants Tony, wants so badly that his hands almost tremble with it.  “Right here.” Steve watches with fascination as Tony's pupils blow out when he drags his thumb over a smudge at the corner of Tony's mouth. Soft, so soft. Steve can feel the warmth of Tony's breath over his fingers. He curls them, tucking them around the curve of Tony's jaw. That electric hum gets almost imperceptibly louder as Steve leans in. He rubs over soft lips again, before slipping his thumb down and out of the way. It feels charged between them, tension ratcheting higher as their eyes lock and Steve feels suddenly hot all over.
“Oh” Tony breathes out “I um. Praise. It ah-it's very good, since we're being honest here, you should know this about me.” Tony shifts closer, rubbing his cheek against Steve's in an unconscious demand to be touched.
“Come down to the lab, um see what's on the slab. Uhh-I'll call you down after I get this airplane smell off of me. I uh. Uhhh” Tony's cheeks pink when Steve rubs his thumb over the sleek hairs of his beard.  “I have something...for you. Yeah. Um. Okay leaving now!” And then he's off, power walking down the hallway and tossing rapidfire instructions to JARVIS in a language that's definitely not English.
, if someone would only just fucking reach out. But, there was that little promise he had made to Pepper, wherein he had stated that he was done being a superhero.
Steve wiped the sweat from his face with his forearm and pushed back his sweaty bangs before sprinting forward into the battle. He scanned the field until he spotted T’Challa, Natasha, and Bucky moving through the fray, all at different points, and he instinctively moved toward Natasha’s aide. Her pale hair was stained red with blood, and he grimaced as wet tendrils slapped against the side of her face with her every movement, marking her skin. Natasha was exhausted, and she was quickly losing steam, as was Sam. It wouldn’t be long before they fell.
“Okay,” Alaric grumbled, crossing his arms. “But for the record, I already washed my hands like mom asked.”
“What’s for dinner?” He asked, taking a seat at the other end of the table. “It must be something good. I smell truffle oil wafting through the air.”
Tony chuckled and bumped his shoulder against Steve’s. “And you do it so prettily, Steve. Now eat up so you can go shower and relax a bit. We’ll have plenty of time to talk in the morning.”
Pepper laughed and pulled away. She trailed her fingers down Tony’s arms and squeezed his hands. “I know you do, and I’ll always love you. But we’re just not meant to be, Tony.”
face was really dampening his inventive energy. He hadn’t shaped thought to tangible creation in weeks. Then again, some of his attention had been absorbed on the S.H.I.E.L.D. deconstruction incident.
Elise walked in to the room before Tony could answer, pushing a stainless steel card loaded with food. She offered the two men a warm smile before filling their plates with a standard vegetable medley assortment, and a seafood fanfare of salmon, scallops, and lobster, all lightly coated with truffle oil and grilled to perfection.
A golden circle of pulsing light manifested behind Thanos, accompanied by a bright flash of green and the angry whine of Iron Man’s repulsor. Steve heard Thanos yell in outrage before being violently sucked into the door of the portal. He felt a hard tug on his battered body, but the man Tony had called Strange closed off the portal, cutting off its grip. Absolute silence followed in Thanos’ wake, and it exploded across the field, causing Steve’s ears to pop from the pressure.
“You bent the chair again, Pops,” Alaric laughed, skipping out of the kitchen. “Dad’s goin’ to have a bird! He’s going to buy replacements from IKEA and make you put them together without instructions!”
The action bought Steve enough time to punch the hand away from Iron Man’s location. Thanos quickly recovered and smacked Steve away like a fly, sending him soaring into a steadfast tree line. Steve crashed into a thick tree trunk, his weight splintering the top half beyond recognition. Sharp fragments pierced the exposed skin on his neck and arms, drawing blood.
A wan smile touched Steve’s lips, and it made something in Tony’s chest flip upside down. “Hello, Mr. Stark. I’m sorry to intrude, but may I please come in?”
A desperate sob spilled from Pepper’s lips, and she threw her arms around Tony’s neck and hugged him tight. “I’m sorry, Tony,” she breathed, sobbing into this neck. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I thought I could handle who you were…who you are…but I can’t. I’m scared all of the time, and I never know when someone is going to bust through the door.”
“I don’t understand what’s going on, other than the fact that I’m being…judged,” Steve admitted in a faint voice. He ran his hands through his hair and tugged at the roots.
It was heartbreaking that the act of rallying the world had cost so many lives almost immediately after nations had vowed a pledge of peace. It seemed blood was always the preferred medium of the gods when they allowed roads of peace to be paved in their realm.
Steve took in a gasping breath, and the action made his lungs burn. “B-Buck,” he managed to stammer before Tony tore the earpiece from his ear.
“Hey, none of that. Mi casa es su casa and all that jazz, no matter where the location. Any house that’s in the Stark name is your home, too, by default.”
Steve was only a few yards away when a large, metallic hand punched Iron Man out of the sky. Tony fell, hard and heavy, and Steve’s ears were filled with the sickening crunch of metal grating against compacted soil. There was no doubt that the metallic hand was indeed the infamous gauntlet.
Steve had clutched his blanket so hard he was sure his fingers were going to poke through the weak fabric. He remembered staring at his mother’s sleeping face, her eyes framed by dark circles born from sleep deprivation. He had been scared that if he died without gazing into her eyes that he would be lost forever, his soul would be claimed by the void. Steve had struggled to call out, to find the strength to pull himself from bed, but his efforts had been in vain. He had been able to do nothing but lay in place as the world faded around him, and just when he thought it was all over, warmth had filled his chest, spreading through his body and easing the distress in his lungs. He fought through the pain and took in a much-needed breath.
Peggy was indeed gone, as if she had never been sitting beside him, but Steve could still detect hints of her jasmine perfume hanging in the air. His plate of half eaten eggs and bacon was still on the table, and Steve watched as Tony reached over the mess of congealing yolk to grab his coffee. Tony knocked back the cup and drained it dry in less than a minute.
“What’s with that expression?” Peggy laughed, ushering Steve toward a red, Formica table sitting in front of a picture window showcasing Clint’s rustic backyard. “You look as if you’ve seen a ghost. Sit down already, Steve! The bacon should be ready to come out of the oven by now.”
Steve found that he could not let go of Tony-dupe’s hands. It had been too long since he’d been allowed within a thousand miles near Tony’s space, much less within touching distance. To be able to make physical contact with his friend was like a balm to his spirit. “What do you mean as we speak?” he finally voiced.
Steve raised a trembling hand to Tony’s face and cupped his jaw. “N-no,” he gasped, hoping that Tony would understand. He had no more fight left in his soul. Steve had fought against many enemies, he had saved countless lives, and he’d taken just as many in return. He had sacrificed his heart and soul to the cause of being a just soldier, and Steve had willingly become a villain to fight for the greater good.  There was nothing left to give now, nothing but this moment, where he could take some of Tony’s pain with him to the afterlife.
A faint blush bloomed on Elise’s face, and she patted Steve’s hand. “It’s my pleasure, sir.” She took a step back and bowed lightly before pushing the cart back out of the dining room.
Darkness framed his vision, threatening to cut off his sight, but Steve forced himself to meet Tony’s gaze. There were tears pooled in Tony’s eyes, magnifying the absolute loss silently raging within the pupils. There was so much Steve wanted to say to Tony, but he didn’t know where to start, or how to voice his feelings.
“I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming,” he chanted. Steve’s heart stopped as Thanos raised the gauntlet high into the air with the intent of squashing Tony into the earth. Steve was still too far away, he wasn’t going to make it, he’d failed to do his duty, he’d failed to protect what was most important….
He stepped toward Pepper and cupped her face in both hands, tracing her elfin features with his eyes. “Why can’t you just come out and admit that
“That’s the understatement of the year,” Tony murmured. He walked over towards Pepper’s abandoned seat and relocated the dishes and cutlery to the space right beside Steve. He settled into his seat and pressed his knee against Steve’s leg. “Jarvis, please inform Elise that we’re ready for dinner to be served.”
Steve whirled around in his seat, bumping his elbows into the steel border framing the table. A little boy stood behind him, and he guessed the child was about four or five. His heart lurched in his chest as he drank in the boy’s features. Chestnut brown hair framed a set of hazel eyes that were accented with thick brows, and Steve could see the artistic blending of his and Peggy’s nose and jaw shape in the gentle bends of the boy’s face. The cherubic curve of the boy’s mouth, however, belonged completely to his mother, and it made Steve’s heart hurt.
Peggy was standing in front of a stainless-steel stove, humming along with Dorothy Lamour. She glanced back and offered him a warm smile before flipping the two eggs that she was frying in the pan. Peggy jumped back with a giggle as oil splashed into the air. She let the eggs sit and cook for a long minute before she slid them onto an olive, ceramic plate.
Tony-dupe offered Steve a soft smile, the action crinkling the corners of its eyes. “I see you know what I’m talking about.”
“Yes!” Pepper choked. “He’s a superhero, Tony. He would’ve found a way to…cope…with his situation. Superheroes always do.”
“You were ready to what, Capsicle?” Tony-dupe prodded. He pulled his hands back and crossed his arms.
Steve’s bangs fell across his forehead, framing his sweaty brow. He pushed through the horde, forcing his body to keep moving every time he took a hit. His shields moved through the air like weaponized ailerons, cutting through the smoke and the screaming and the blood lust with nothing but a whisper.
Peggy jabbed Steve in the chest with the toes of her right foot. “Yes, your son.” Her eyes flicked behind him. “Isn’t that right, Poppet?”
Whether it was the cold, or the heat and soil, it was his mother who always sat beside him when he had an illness attack. When fever burned the synapses of his brain and threatened to shut down his body, or his lungs were forced shut, depriving him of oxygen, it was always Sarah Roger’s face he saw haloed by the light. She spent the last part of her life crying for Steve, but the tears were more pronounced during his most intense bouts of sickness. It was during the moments where Steve swore he saw the proverbial light that her love shined brightest, the emotion magnified by the tears in her caerulean eyes.
Steve’s senses became permeated with the metallic scent of his fallen brethren. The smell coated the lining of his throat and savagely crawled through his system until it burrowed into the marrow of his bones. Resolve took root at the base of his heart, extending long arms outward. Steve almost choked from the weight of it.
Tony waited until he heard the shower start running in Steve’s room before making his way toward his and Pepper’s bedroom. The room sat at the back of the house, and he wasn’t too shocked to find the door wide open. Pepper stood in front of the large picture window that framed a backdrop of a clear, black, moonless sky. Tony could clearly see tear tracks glistening on the cheeks of her reflection. Two large suitcases sat perched near the food of the bed, and he knew she meant to leave for good this time.
He sidestepped down the staircase with silent footing, keeping his back facing away from the music streaming from the far left of the stairs. The breath stilled in Steve’s lungs as he glided across the oak floorboards lining the living room and inched his way toward the large doorway leading into the kitchen. He pressed his back against the inner edge of the crown molding and took in a deep inhale before rounding the corner.
Thanos was currently ripping the universe apart stitch by stitch, and some force had seen fit to tuck Steve Rogers into bed for a posthumous nap. What was the point of keeping him around if he was dead? Did Thanos have a way of resurrecting the dead to do his bidding? Steve steeled his nerves and padded toward the entrance, his senses on high alert. He scanned the room for anything that he could use as a weapon, but the only objects around him besides the bed and the chest of drawers were the various reams of fabric Laura stored against the back wall.
,’ he mouthed, dragging his hand down Tony’s face. Steve’s fingers trailed down the Iron Man suit and cupped the light of the reactor shining bright in the center of Tony’s chest. He meant to say, “See, I was here for you, just like I said, Stark,” but what came out was a gurgled, “H-h-here.”
“Wait!” Steve cried. He rushed toward the back door, but Tony-dupe had already slipped through and closed the door behind himself. Steve yanked the door open and stepped outside onto the back porch, his bare feet catching traction on the wooden planks of the patio. He was greeted with a fresh wave of the evening breeze that carried with it the modest sounds and clean smells of Summer in the country.
Right now Tony could feel the angry glare of the antique grandfather clock - the one Pepper had insisted on purchasing - burning a hole through his skull, and the itch was slowly driving him mad. Dinner would be ready to serve in exactly seven minutes, and there would be no mercy for him if he was late again this week.
An iced chill suddenly raced down Steve’s spine, and the unchecked part of his heart recognized the hollow energy. He shivered as intangible fingers caressed the back of his neck, carding through his hair. He’d felt that touch before.
Steve finally reached Natasha. He tore through the mob that had surrounded her, avoiding most of the attacks sent his way. He absorbed multiple blows as he curled around Natasha and pushed sideways, rolling their bodies to a safe distance in the trees, where the area was temporarily clear. Natasha managed to throw a grenade before collapsing on top of his body, and Steve’s heart twisted as he felt her ragged breaths push hard against his chest.
Sam immediately dropped to his knees and wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders. “Give ‘em hell, brother. I’ll be waiting for you to join us when we make our move to finish this war, so don’t do anything crazy.”
“You know me, Steve,” it insisted, reaching out to take Steve’s hand. Steve wasn’t sure why he allowed the move, and he watched as Tony’s double unfurled his clenched fingers and pressed his open palm to its chest. The cold sensation that seeped into his pores froze the simmering anger burning in Steve’s veins, and he could feel it settle into the joints of his bones. He’d felt this energy before.
The silence that filled the house after Pepper’s departure was thick and heavy, and it squeezed the breath from Tony’s lungs. He’s not sure how long he stood in the center of his room, combing through the fibers of the blue carpet with an empty gaze, but it must have been a while. The sound of someone clearing a throat snapped him out of his morose reverie.
Steve’s eyes shot open at the thought of Tony, and he bolted upright in bed. He threw back the saffron colored blanket covering his body and ran both hands down his torso, checking for wounds. He felt whole, which was impossible, and he raked up the navy t-shirt he was wearing to inspect his body. There were no signs of open wounds, evidence of convalescing tissue, or scars. Steve had taken a direct hit from one of the Infinity Gems, but his torso was completely clear.
Had Tony known that he would be expected to attend daily “family” dinners - at precisely 7 o’clock in the evening - when he promised Pepper a normal life, he might have thought twice before making the offer. It wasn’t so much that he didn’t
Silence echoed in Steve’s ear for a long heartbeat. “Yeah, someday,” Bucky finally huffed. “So whadda ya say, soldier? You ready to earn that ride home?”
Tony-dupe laughed. “The answer to that question is quite complicated – people’s actions really do affect their eventual resting place, but it is not I who makes the final decision.”
A strange light filled Steve’s eyes, but Tony had no time to try and decipher its meaning. Hell broke loose in the dining room as soon as he escorted Steve through the doorway. Pepper rose from her seat with a deadly grace that would put Natasha’s to shame, and she speared Tony into place with a heavy gaze. He gently pressed the tips of his fingers into the small of Steve’s back.
“I’m not a coward,” Steve snapped, jumping to his feet. He jabbed Tony-dupe’s right shoulder with his index finger. “I’ve fought my whole life, Tony, and I fought until I couldn’t anymore. I’m just an old soldier whose time has run out.”
“Tony,” Steve gurgled, choking on blood. The right corner of his lips tugged upward into the shadow of a smile, and he forced his eyes open. The comforting, russet hue of Tony’s eyes pushed away all light, filling his vision. Steve found himself mesmerized by the gold flecks scattered throughout the brown irises, warm and liquid like the bold energy of stars that sketch constellations in the galaxy.
The steady beat of vibranium fending off alien elements pulsed against his skin like the sound of a mother’s heartbeat, its comforting cadence a sharp contrast to the piercing staccato of extra-terrestrial gunfire tearing through human flesh. The field vibrated with the cries of the wounded and of survivors, their wrecked voices filled with pain and sorrow. Steve filtered them out, putting his focus on the few battle calls still pushing through the chaos. He inhaled, pulling the lingering determination reverberating through the smoky air deep into his lungs.
Tony’s doppelganger dropped its gaze and stretched its toes, pressing the tips into the wood flooring. Steve waited for an answer, but Tony 2.0 seemed pre-occupied with branding toe prints into the clean floor. Minutes passed, long seconds that wore down Steve’s nerves like magnified sunlight on water. He was one second from grabbing the entity wearing Tony’s face and putting it through the nearest wall when it finally raised its eyes, glancing up at Steve through Tony’s long, sooty lashes.
Steve snorted, swallowing a chuckle. Alaric needing to have the last word reminded him of Tony. The thought hadn’t even finished forming in his mind as Alaric’s visage rippled, contorted, and he watched the ends of the boy’s bangs bend into loose, unruly curls around his face, framing his darkened brown eyes. A playful smirk bloomed on Alaric’s face, and it fully displayed the infamous Stark charisma. Steve started in his seat, gripping the back of the chair tight with both hands.
“Stay in the North quadrant and head East. I’ll take my stand here in the South and head West. Let’s clear the field as much as we can so the others have a minute to catch their breath. T’Challa and Stark are going to need reinforcements later.”
He pushed through the doors and practically waltzed in to the dining room. Pepper was sitting at one end of their formal dining table, her long, painted nails curled into the smooth finish of the mahogany table. She was wearing the look Tony had come to hate, and it broke his heart that he wasn’t capable of giving Pepper the normal life she so desperately craved.
“Most believe Death to be a male. You know, Grim Reaper get-up and all that – somehow the image of an overflowing black robe screams penis to the populace, and I’m not sure why. But you, what you picture in your mind when you think of me, well, I must say, Steve, it’s flattering.”
“I think you need this place more than I do,” Pepper smiled. She wiped fresh tears from her face and dried the tips of her fingers on her dress. “And maybe the Captain does, too. The house is quiet and secluded…I think you both need some down time. And if any more stray heroes find their way here, well, at least I know you won’t be alone.”
The fire exploded around Steve’s heart, scorching his system with an intense orange flame. He took in a shuddering breath as it filled his mind and neutralized all pain. Steve gave into the flame’s siren call, and he fell into the echo of Tony’s voice. And then he knew no more.
Steve stepped toward Tony and placed a warm hand on the man’s shoulder, lightly squeezing the side of Tony’s neck. “You tried,” he pointed out, “and that always counts for something. You’re a good man, Tony Stark.”
“Now that’s the Pepper I know,” Tony smiled. “I’m not too fond of heartless Pepper. She’s kind of mean – hot, but yeah, mean.”
“Alaric, what have I told you about touching your face at the dining table?” Peggy scolded. “Now you’ll have to wash your hands before you eat.”
Steve’s nostrils flared. “I’m not having this conversation with you. You’re not even Tony. You wouldn’t understand.”
“Cold, black coffee with a side of bacon and eggs – the breakfast of American icons! It suits your old man style, Spangles,” Tony quipped, setting the chipped, ceramic cup on the table. He wiggled his naked toes in Steve’s lap.
He took the weathered, oversized gym bag out of Steve’s hands, barely holding back a rude noise of disgust when his fingers sank into a thick coat of dirt and grime that covered the black, nylon handles. He tossed the red bag to the side, ignoring the sharp clang of Steve’s shield hitting the floor. The sound echoed throughout the large foyer, rattling Tony’s bones. The metal seemed to be singing a ballad of an untold war, one where the outcome had resulted in an infinite loss.
Steve stood in the doorway wearing a sorrowful expression that stretched Tony’s heartstrings further than they already were. “I’m truly sorry, Tony,” he offered, walking into the room. “It wasn’t my intention to cause any trouble when I knocked on your front door tonight.”
“No!” Steve yelled as he watched Thanos take aim. He stretched out his hand, shield at the ready, and willed time to stop for a moment, just long enough for him to cross the last few feet that separated him from blocking the attack. Queens stepped into the hot zone and stilled Thanos’ movement with a shot of sticky webbing.
When Winter passed, Steve’s room was always invaded by heat and dirt so soft and fine he was sure the granules were made of silk. The soil would float throughout the air, coating everything in his room. During the first night of Spring, a fine layer of dust would settle on his skin, caressing his hair before crawling into his sinuses and settling in for a long, Summer nap. The Summer months were hard on Steve – he had daily battles with his asthma that left him completely drained, and some were so bad he swore he saw God’s light beckoning him home.
Steve ran a shaky hand down his face, pulling lightly at the ends of his beard. He was surprised to find his facial hair combed and well-conditioned. It had been quite some time since he’d bothered to properly groom the wayward fuzz on his face, and yet, he could smell the faint scent of sandalwood and oakmoss clinging to the coarse hairs. Someone, or some
“No, my darling, I merely offered you a chance. You were the one who fought to live, and your courage saved us both.”
He left before Tony could question him further, and Tony found that he wasn’t even irritated with Steve for just walking away. He found his eyelids falling shut a moment later, and he managed to ask Jarvis to turn off the lights before falling asleep.
Tony pulled Steve’s body close. “There must be something you can do, Strange!” he pleaded. “Turn back time, make it stop – there has to be something!”
Tony awoke with a start and lay in the darkness for what seemed like hours trying to catch his breath. His phone alerted him of a message around 4:30 in the morning, and it was from Pepper. She’d finally made it in to New York, and she’d settled down in a guest apartment that SI reserved for special clients.
A shaky exhale fell from Steve’s lips, and he slowly rose from his seat. Tony frowned as his feet fell to the floor with a hard thud. “I’m going to ask you one more time. Who, or what, are you? What is this place?”
Thanos filled Steve’s vision as his eyes finally cleared, and he was larger than Steve had imagined. He scanned the area and recognized one of Tony’s companions to be the kid from Queens. He recalled Natasha disclosing that Queens was Spider Man. The second companion was a stranger, and from what Steve could see, he was a flyer who wielded magic. Whether he was the one who cast open the portal was open for debate.
“It’s your ass that always needs savin’, Rogers,” Bucky quipped. “Best keep your focus on what’s in front of you.”
There wasn’t anything Tony could really say to that. He unconsciously pressed his knee harder into Steve’s leg and speared a bite of the man’s salmon. “Anytime, old man,” he smiled, holding Steve’s gaze.
A large portal opened in the sky, framed by a fluorescent, gold light. Steve fell forward on his hands, panting, and willed his vision to clear. His head hung so low to the ground that his breath stirred the charred soil, and it rose up to caress his face with a lover’s touch. Steve licked his lips, taking the earth within his mouth like a benediction. ‘Just one more round to go,’ he thought.
“What? You’re not intruding, Captain,” Tony assured, ushering his comrade inside. He took note of the ragged state of Steve’s clothing, and the dark circles practically tattooed under the man’s eyes. Wherever Steve had been wandering, whatever battles Captain America had been fighting, it had taken a toll on Tony’s friend.
“It’s not your fault, Cap,” Tony croaked. He pressed flat hands against his outer thigh. “Pepper and I, well, things have been rough. She wanted a new life, a fresh start, and I tried to give it to her, but I just…couldn’t.” A bitter chuckle rumbled in his chest. “We’ve been in Texas for a little over five months now, and she never really unpacked her suitcases. I should’ve known with just that, but yeah, I didn’t want to see it.”
Steve knew it was time to send them onward with T’Challa so they could prepare for the final volley he saw brewing on the horizon. He gnashed his teeth and pulled his right wrist toward his mouth. “It’s time,” Steve rasped, speaking into the mouthpiece embedded in the cuff of his glove.
The tired sigh that was attempting to crawl up from Tony’s chest lost its footing at the sound of the doorbell ringing, and it promptly fell to a quick death much to his relief, landing in Tony’s stomach. The last thing he needed was to stoke Pepper’s ire even more than he already had. He jumped up from his seat and checked the video screen set into the wall beside the front door.
Sam flew overhead, waving in silent gratitude as he zigzagged through more aerial attacks. Relief flooded Steve’s system, and he released a shaky exhale. He wrenched his shield free from the dead alien and scanned his immediate surroundings. Steve seemed to be lying in a small vacuum of stillness filled with nothing but the sounds of war. He shook his head and pressed the heels of his hands into his brows in a vain attempt to ease the pressure building behind his eyes. Steve took in a cleansing inhale and released a sharp breath, the sound mingling with the eerie cacophony of clashing weapons playing loud and fast in the background.
Tony’s face twisted into a bewildered expression. “Are you even listening to yourself, Pepper? A year ago, you would’ve probably covered Steve up in bubble wrap and spoon-fed him homemade hot cocoa until the color returned to his face!”
Steve jerked his head up toward the wooden awning and was greeted by the sight of Clint’s upside down, smiling face. “Clint?” he breathed, taking a shaky step toward his friend.
to attend, it was that he forgot to make it on time more often than not, and that never sit well with Pepper. Five months of having to look at her pouty “
Okay, most of his attention had been fixated on the event - mostly because a large chunk of his inner friend circle had scattered into the infamous four winds of the earth without being seen since. Clint had taken off after Natasha before the dust had settled around the ruins, taking nothing from the Tower but his weapons and a change of clothes. He’d offered Tony a smile and a two-fingered salute before stepping into the elevator, and Tony had known in that moment it would be a long while before they would meet up again.
“You made a wish once, my darling, one borne from a place of absolute hope and untainted love. I traveled through the cosmos for eons, bouncing from star to star without any hope of finding a place to settle – to call home. And one day I heard your voice from across the galaxy, I felt the conviction of your wish, and I knew at that moment that I could find a home within your heart.”
he was at this point, but he was far from feeling afraid. He knew this room – Clint had allowed Tony and Steve to call it home once.
“Your soul chose this place to take a breather for a reason, Steve,” Tony-dupe interrupted. “Your job is to figure out why. When you do that, we’ll sit down and have a chat about your hereafter, yeah?” He offered Steve a playful wink and sauntered toward the back door. “But don’t worry, you’ll have backup, Spangles. I mean, you’re all still friends at heart, right? Never fear, Steve, you’ll be interacting with the real deal.”
He pushed his legs over the side of the mattress, bunching the sheets near the foot of the queen size bed. Steve had slept in this bed before, and he’d shared its limited space with Tony. He raked his eyes over the right side of the bed and found that the bedding was undisturbed. His first thought was that Tony was puttering around in Clint’s barn and hadn’t made it to bed again, but he pushed the absurd notion away.
Steve started, and he staggered backward, falling into his recently vacated seat. He still held Tony-dupe’s hands within his own. “What are you saying?” he rasped. “Did I – was it - does Thanos have it?”
Tony-dupe snorted and rose to its feet, gently releasing Steve’s hand. It moved to stand in front of Steve, sticking its thumbs in the jeans pockets. The sight of Tony basically lounging about in Average Joe clothes and bare feet was enough to tickle Steve’s fascination in a way he wasn’t sure he could decipher. The playful smirk that bloomed on Tony-dupe’s mouth wasn’t helping the situation.
“Too tired,” Steve sighed, and the heaviness of it pushed against Tony’s chest. “I hope you’ll forgive me this once for my impropriety.”
Steve grimaced as a hefty, metal elbow connected with his right temple. His eyesight filled with white light, and he pitched forward toward the burning earth. The back of Steve’s neck began to prickle, and he swung his right shield high, impaling the razor-sharp tip into a Chitauri’s skull. The lifeless form went down heavy, yanking Steve hard. He fell on his left side and slid across compacted rock and dirt, skimming the skies with a blurry gaze.
“I thought I was supposed to be taking care of you,” Tony snorted, keeping his eyes on the floor. He raised one hand and covered the one Steve hand on his shoulder.
If for some reason his heart rate skipped a few beats at his friend’s answering snort, Tony didn’t feel it necessary to be concerned.
Nations had put aside their differences to join arms in Earth’s defense, and the colors of various countries had been hoisted high into the air as soldiers charged into battle. These colors continued to wave from the bodies of the fallen, and each tiny movement of bloodied uniforms fluttering in the wind was a silent reminder of what was at stake.
Tony felt the loss of at least three layers of skin as Pepper tore her gaze away. He watched her stalk out of the dining room without so much as looking Steve’s way. The sharp staccato from her nude colored Malono Blahnik heels flooded the hallway, a clear message that she was done with any civil conversation tonight. He sighed and ushered Steve into his recently vacated seat.
“Good evening, Miss Potts,” Steve smiled, running a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry for my impromptu visit, but I wanted to check in with Mr. Stark.”
“N-no, not yet,” Tony choked, giving Steve’s body a light shake. “Steve, stay with me! Strange, do something!”
Steve shrugged, seeing the how comfortable Peter was in his skinny jeans and Ugg boots. Peter was happy, healthy and one of the kindest boys he’d ever met. Steve knew that he was being biased but as Captain America, he had met many kids.
He hooked his baby finger on the sucky thing in Peter's mouth and took it out. Peter looked at him in outrage as it was so rudely taken off him. His glare turning to a whine when the cookie was taken off him.
Steve rolled his eyes. That was Tony for you. Always trying to help people. “Her nametag said, Hannah. Don’t know her last name”
Natasha took a sniff of the air and made eye contact with Bucky, nodding her head. Clint was oblivious to a lesser Alpha and the smell not being strong enough yet. Bucky jerked his head to Natasha so that she would get Steve and quick, Tony would be getting desperate soon.
“You lied. You said you’d carry Bucky in but he’s asleep in the buggy. He’s going to cry.” He said, accusingly, eyes narrowing at his the thought of his Daddy making his baby brother cry.
Cho could see that Bucky was not that exception. He was hairless and the pre-puberty size he should be.
“You know you’re my favourite person right? Even more than your Mama and Papa? Even more than my friends. I love coming here because of you?” Harley asked, nearly choking on his cries.
Peter let out a shuddery breath once he was done his bottle. Mama hadn’t left him. He wasn’t alone because he was big. He didn’t like being alone. He looked up at Mama, his bottom lip poking out. Mama made the same face back at him causing Peter to giggle. His Mama was really silly.
Peter nodded, “Yeah, Jamie. You’re sick. Mama is gone to shower, but Dada will try his best.” He said, getting a laugh off of Dada.
“Oh look, there are some photos of us at the airport.” Harley burst out laughing as he scrolled through the photos people took. There was one of Peter staring at the camera with his arms crossed over his chest, sticking his tongue out while Tony and Harley hugged.
Steve thought the best course of action would be to change the subject. “You eat all of that sweetheart and then we’ll go get ready for trick or treating, okay?”
“I don’t like the idea of a bunch of strangers asking you questions. It worries me.” Steve said, going with the truth so Peter could see where he’s coming from.
“You’re going to warm my cock for a while and once Clint is done we’ll give you a nice orgasm, how does that sound?” Before Tony could protest Steve had the plug out and was driving up into Tony.
Bucky and Peter were also very aware of the scrutiny, both of them hiding their faces from the stares.
Steve curled his arms around Tony, pulling him back so he could cuddle into him properly, brushing his lips against Tony’s neck, smiling when Tony unknowingly rocked back against him.
“Steve Roger’s, Steve?” Peter couldn’t believe it. He wouldn’t have thought Steve was going to be an Alpha like that.
“You’re the best avenger, even better than Mama and Papa.” He said, ignoring his parent's outrage, cheering when Bucky took out a bag of sweets that he knew Peter loved. He poured the ranchero’s he made Nat pick him up along with Maom bars and Meanies into the bucket. Peter might as well get all of his favourite foreign sweets since he was going to have a lot of the American ones that were filled with sugar.
“Thanks, guys. Your Mama will be back after a shower. How about we all go to down and get Jamie a bath? What do you say, Pete? Want to be my big boy and help make your little brother feel better?”
Thanks for all the comments and Kudos in the last chapter. I have a load of college work I'm currently avoiding during the Easter break but sure look. I'm sure it'll all get done.
Tony sighed. “Petey, Harley is like a big brother to him. We all consider him family and he is our family where it matters but the difference is that Harley has a Mom back in Tennessee that deals with his discipline and all the rules. That leaves me to be able to joke more as a friend with him than a Dad. I am your Dad though which means my first priority is your safety and happiness. That sometimes means that you’ll get in trouble with me quicker than Harley would. Harley is old enough to be afforded a bit of leeway with that stuff. You’re still young enough that I have to give you a bit more structure. Do you understand?” Tony took Peter’s shaking hands and began to rub some heat back into them.
Steve took over when it appeared no one else was going to. “Bruce, you’re certified to do the classification exam, aren’t you? Can you give Clint his one since he obviously lied on the last one?” When the Avengers came together Bruce went through the exam to be a classification officer so that the privacy of the Avengers would always be upheld as an Omega’s needed a check-up three times a year along with mental checks with them after they’ve mated. Bruce already had Friday put an appointment reminder for Tony tomorrow to see how he was doing after his heat with Steve. They never thought they’d need Bruce to put the other side of this qualification to use though.
Peter nodded eagerly in response, reminding Steve of a puppy. His doe eyes holding a pleading edge to them. Steve had to squash the urge to shoot him down straight away, he was trying to take the advice Tony gave to him after they put Peter to bed and were just relaxing in the living room.
“No? Want to stay with your Mama instead? That’s okay honey, I won’t take you off him, I just need to see how bad your ouch is.” He felt Captain America put his hand on his back, rubbing it gently up and down, before whispering. “Maybe after we can get some cookies from the kitchen after?”
Tony came in and put Peter’s phone in his pocket. “Don’t worry about them, baby. It’s not a thing got to do with them how we raise you. That’s the bad side of Twitter. Luckily we can block them for you from now on and everyone will know what not to write to you about.”
He made his way over to where he knew his clothes were, cringing when he saw that the only clothes there were for littles. He tried to pick the least offensive to his eyes, going with a T-shirt that said ‘My Daddy is Ironman’. In fairness, he probably would have worn something like that in the other world. Next was a pair of sweatpants with little Captain America shields on them. Jeez, talk about self-promotion. The shields weren’t too obvious though so he took them out as well and started to work his clothes off him.
For some reason the tone made Peter’s chin wobble. He wouldn’t have had to throw it if they had just listened to him! Before he knew it he was letting out a wail, unable to help himself. He wished he had Ironman back so he could snuggle with him. Mama and Dada weren’t going to since they were angry at him. He put his head on the highchair tray and continued to cry loudly. He was only trying to help! He could hear he Mama and Dada speaking quietly around his cries and then all of a sudden he was on his Mama’s lap. He gripped onto him straight away, curling himself into Mama’s neck. He didn’t care if it was Mama giving out to him. He wanted a cuddle and who better to get it off than Ironman himself?
“I dunno, I see you as more of a mother figure sometimes and it just slips out. Is that okay? I’ll try and stop if you hate it. Do you really hate it?” Tony felt panic at the slightly teary-eyed boy in front of him. No way was he going to get Peter to stop. It was like his own unique nickname for him.
“Tony, pasta.” Steve reminded him after a few minutes of Tony not doing anything but riding the dildo. Tony whined in response, opening his mouth for Steve to deposit some in. He was too busy at the moment.
hurt. He clutched the top of his head trying to stop the tears from coming. He wasn’t even sure why he
“Let’s go out and see what Daddy is doing will we?” Mr Stark asked, Daddy? Who the heck was Daddy supposed to be? Did this mean that Mr Stark was his Mama? Or Papa? Peters mind was running wild and overwhelming him like it tended to do sometimes. Instead of answering Mr Stark he pushed his head into his neck and sucked on the object in his mouth. A whine left his mouth involuntarily when they began to leave the room. Mr Stark seemed to be able to interpret it easily enough and chuckled, shuffling Peter around so that he was sitting on his hip rather than his front so that he could get his plushie.
He knew he’d have to get tested eventually but he never imagined it would be in the kitchen with Steve looking over him as Tony rode him. It was all very surreal to Clint but might as well get it done now. One glance at Bruce showed he was ready to go. A tap to his hip got his attention pulled back to Bucky who was giving him a no-nonsense stare.
Peter looked up from playing with Bucky’s metal arm, it was one of his most favourite things to do. “Eh yeah, sure Mama.” He giggled, turning his attention back to Bucky.
“I think you’ll find that I am the coolest person there is. I was the one that spent a few years in the ice.”
Peter could feel eyes on him and looked over to see Bucky staring at him with near worship in his eyes. Huh. That was a nice feeling. He looked tired though.
Clint blushed and nodded his head, glad he was going back over Bucky’s need and didn’t have to look at Bruce any longer.
“Steve, we both know that he’s little and so does Bucky. If he wasn’t he wouldn’t be in that car seat right now. Any other classification would just explain calmly why they were not going into the car seat and that would be the end of it, not resort to tears and whining until you got him in and gave him a pacifier to calm him down.” Tony would never make someone that is not a little go by the classification, not only was it illegal but it was a bad time for all parties involved.
Bucky nodded, “Yep, he thought that mouthing off to me before the two of you came over would do him any favours, as you can see it hasn’t. He’s got another ten minutes on that before he’s allowed off. I’m pretty sure he’ll be able to come at least twice more. I have faith in him.”
There were similar bags with Tony and Steve’s on it at Steve’s feet. Peter bounded over to the bag, jumping up and down in excitement.
Bruce put the blood in some solution, giving the vial a shake. Usually, when the test was done it would turn up a few different colours. The main ones were for Alpha, Beta and Omega though. Alpha was a gold colour, Beta a brown and Omega a light blue colour. There were a lot of sub-classifications such as Lesser Alpha which more of an orange than gold and Carer which was a pinkish colour. There were endless possibilities for the test but the one thing about it was that it never lied, so how Clint was able to get away with being classified as a Lesser Alpha instead of an Omega was beyond them. They all watched on as Bruce shook the vial, waiting to see which colour would seep into it. None of them was shocked when it turned an almost powder blue/ white colour. That was interesting, Bucky noted. It was the same colour as Tony’s which meant, like Tony he was a submissive Omega. Those were quite rare and it was nearly impossible that they’d have two on their team. Nearly as rare as having two Higher Alpha’s on the team, like him and Stevie. The Avengers was just a team full of exceptions it seemed.
Peter grinned, Karen was awesome. He’d figure out a way to go as an AI for Halloween and go as her next year. Right now though he needed to get upstairs and get things together! He’d have to be smart about it if he wanted to get out of his after-school ‘eye rest’, maybe Papa would let it go this once so he’d be able to spend his time getting ready! Who cared if he was ‘grouchy’ without the nap. He was sure he’d be okay today. The sugar would keep him going.
The door flew open and he jumped in fright, his cries becoming louder now that he his kidnapper was here. They were probably going to hurt him way worse than the bump he could feel on his head. He closed his eyes so that he wouldn’t see their faces, still clutching his head to try and stop the pain. To his surprise though no pain came. Instead, he felt someone picking him up and cradling him against their body, one hand under his padded bottom and the other rubbing his back as they rocked. It confused Peter how much comfort he felt from just being held and rocked. The shock of being picked up and comforted made it that he didn’t resist when he felt something being pushed against his lips. When he felt the press of a rubber bulb in his mouth stopped his crying so that he could give it an experimental suck. Huh, it actually felt kind of soothing to suck on it. He did it again, this time more quickly and with more force. Liking the sounds and comfort it gave him. He wasn’t sure what it was but whoever was holding him wasn’t getting it back. He didn’t care if they just saw him crying like a baby, he would fight them for whatever he had now.
“’m not behind,” Peter whined. Peter wasn’t listening to what they were saying, just the last part and if Mama meant he was behind in school or something then he couldn’t take the blame for that! That was the other Peter.
“Okay, darling. We’ll sit down and I’ll take you.” Tony cooed, walking over to a set of four chairs around a small table. There were a few other people there as well but it wasn’t overly busy. No one paid them any attention.
He took off running down the hallway once more, stopping suddenly when he heard Jamie’s cries. He ran back to Mama, not wanting to see Jamie hurt. It sounded like he was hurt. He lifted up his arms to be picked up which Mama did instantly and walked with him out to where Dada was trying to feed Bucky some applesauce and Bucky throwing himself back in his highchair as if Dada were feeding him poison.
“Good, good.” Bruce moved from his ears down to his neck, running his hands down and pressing where his mating gland was. Clint whimpered and his knees went weak, leaning back on Bucky. “He’s very responsive there. I barely pressed down.”
“There are a few main rules. One is that when you're around Tony will be going around in only a shirt and nothing else. I wanted him naked at all times but he negotiated with me.”
“Baby, that’s not true. You still go to high school and you’ll go to college as well, just not in the conventional sense. You’ll be able to work with me any time you want, big or little.” Tony blew out a breath when peter began to calm down.
“Did Clint consent to that?” He clutched onto one of Steve’s arms while he asked, afraid that the answer would be no. He didn’t want to hurt Steve by asking but he had to. There were way too many stories out there of omega’s taken against their will and Tony just couldn’t ignore this. He must have made some sort of noise because all of a sudden Steve’s knot popped free and he was turning Tony around into his chest, comforting him.
Both took off at a quick walk to get to the terminal that Harley was going to meet them at and Peter had never been happier that he was holding his Dad’s hand. He would have definitely gotten lost without the added security.
“Right you can get him dressed again, I have a set of questions and tasks here to determine his age range. It’ll take around a half hour to forty minutes to complete. You can assist in whatever he needs help in.”
“You don’t need that anymore, you have me now. I’ll take away the pain.” He lifted Tony as if he were nothing, sending a wave of arousal through him. By the way, Steve’s nostrils flared he knew it. The grin he sent him was wolf-like before Tony found himself being slowly embedded onto Steve’s cock. It was even bigger than his biggest dildo, causing Tony to groan the whole way down until Steve bottomed out. He was panting by the time Steve settled his legs on either side of him unable to help the moan when Steve shifted back so he was sitting against the top of his bed.
Hey! Short chapter I know, I have another commission this week for this one so it should be longer hopefully. I'm visiting my sister so time and wifi are limited! Let me know what you think of this chapter :D
“Clint will you get two chairs with our lunch ready please, I’m going to carry Tony in now.” He also needed to tuck himself back into his pants. Clint wide-eyed look at his cock was beginning to make him uncomfortable.
“Yes, sir,” Clint responded, unsure why the sir slipped out or why it felt so natural. By the quirk of Bucky’s lips, he said the right thing.
“Yeah, Mama.” Peter said softly. It wasn’t spending time with Harley but Peter loved his movie nights with his parents. He was always allowed to stay up late to watch them.
Peter whined this wasn’t going his way at all. Maybe if he turned the tears on? He glanced over at Bucky and saw that he was crying and Daddy had still put him in the car seat. That’s that plan gone. That was good to know, his parents were heartless. Poor Bucky’s face was all red and his nose even had snots! Daddy was trying to give him a pacifier but Bucky just kept crying and shouting no at him. Did Bucky not know how amazing paci’s were?
He was supposed to go to college and get his PHD’s and work with Mr Stark. Not be a baby and have Mr Stark be his Mama instead.
“B-But you said I could help! I want to help!” He cried, falling onto his padded bottom and letting out a cry. He didn’t want to go to Mama, he wanted to stay with Dada and Jamie. It wasn’t fair!
“Looks like we're up!” Tony stood up and walked to where they were being called, relieved that it was Cho.
“I don’t see why we have to wear them. They look cute on Peter but a bit ridiculous on me.” He complained, trying to pull them on.
Steve raised an eyebrow at his Omega glaring at him. He had not been expecting this when he walked in. From Peter maybe but not from Tony.
“There’s my favourite boy. Did you bump your head?” Peter nodded, unable to help himself. His new Daddy had a really soothing voice that he just had to listen to. He even pointed to where it hurt to show him.
“Okay, Clint. I’m just going to check a few things. Can you open your mouth please?”  Clint did as asked, earning an approving grunt from Bucky. Bruce ran a gloved hand over his teeth and gums, testing the incisors and putting pressure on them to bring them out and testing their strength only letting go when he was happy with how they felt.
Steve cut a look at Tony that sent him racing down to Peter’s room. Tony knew he was in the dog house with Steve. That was one protective Papa. He knocked quietly on Peter’s door and poked his head in when he didn’t receive an answer.
Hey, I have a stomach bug so I've been puking my way through Christmas. Could only eat half of my dinner before legging it to the bathroom which is extremely upsetting. I've been confined to my room because apparently I'm contagious, because of that I've had loads of time to read and write. I wanted something fluffy to write and this came to mind. Let me know what you think.
He put Peter back in the car seat as quick as the first time, making sure to tell Friday to only stop Peter from opening the car seat and nothing more. He closed the door once more and jumped into the front seat, glancing into the rearview mirror at the kids. Peter looked content to examine the car seat and harness, swinging his legs and sucking on his pacifier. And he tried to say he wasn’t little at the minute, he’s lucky Tony is good at seeing past the bullshit.
“Thanks, Tony! See you later! uh, enjoy?” And with that Bruce rushed back out while Tony continued to bounce on Steve’s cock.
Mama raised an eyebrow and Peter knew it wasn’t looking good for him. He remembered that look from the other world. It usually told Peter he was in trouble if he kept going. Call him stupid but Peter just had to make a try at not being in the admittedly cool car seat.
“How about this, me, you and Papa will have a movie night tomorrow night. We’ll make some chocolate popcorn and watch whatever movie you want while Harley is out, that sound good to you?”
“Yes, Karen told me how excited you were.” Karen was Peter’s personal AI that Tony made for him for his rooms in the tower and complex.
Harley was excited to see Peter as well, even going as far as making Tony pay for a larger suitcase for him so he could bring a new lego set for Peter that they could build together.
Tony and Steve just sat in silence for the first few minutes after Peter fell asleep, relishing in the silence after Bucky’s and Peter’s meltdowns. It was Steve that ended up breaking the silence.
They had all thought once Peter and Bucky got their memories back from the other world, they would have a fight on their hands. Peter had accepted it a lot quicker than they thought he would. Still, Tony did remember that he was an affectionate child in the other world. Always hugging and cuddling every chance he got. Tony wasn’t blind because Peter looked up to him and saw him as a father figure. It was why he was able to slide into his role as ‘Mama’ so quickly.
Peter sniffled, and wiped his eyes, nodding. He was a big boy, so he would be able to help Dada make his baby brother feel better. “Jamie needs my help?” He asked, pointing at himself to make sure that Dada got the point. Peter didn’t say it but he knew that his Dada needed help, because he wasn’t Mama.
“Okay sweetheart. How about a little snack and then we’ll get dressed and go trick or treating. Go say hello to your aunt and uncles.” He put Peter down and turned him toward where the rest of the Avengers were sitting.
“It’s okay sweetheart, we’ll take care of you in a while. Just wait.” He placed a hand on the small of Clint’s back, stopping his movement.
“If he comes on the sofa you’re cleaning it,” Clint muttered seeing Tony’s cock hitting the cushion.
“This room is warm enough, I know you’re just doing it to be dramatic.” Bucky pouted at him but stopped his theatrics, still cuddling around the blankey.
“What’cha get me, uncle Bucky?” He asked, searching his pockets, making Bucky laugh as he hit tickly spots on him.
Peter came running back into the room and jumped into Steve’s waiting arms. He looked even more delicate in his Iron-Man swim shorts that barely reached mid-thigh. “I’m back!” He declared, his brows furrowing as he took a sniff of the air. “Why does it smell a lot like you, Steve?” He asked. Steve took a sniff of the air and could see where Peter was coming from. Steve’s scent was nearly overpowering.
Bucky finally lifted his head from where he was hiding and took the blanket that was offered to him, not protesting when he felt the pacifier against his lips. His two comfort items served to do what Tony couldn’t, and calm him down. Tony breathed a sigh of relief. He was afraid that Bucky was going to make himself sick.
Bucky snorted, “You told us that you were sick that week Steve! Not that you weren’t allowed to leave.”
“Hmm, you make a cute bear. I don’t think Papa or I will look half as good.” Peter grinned up at his Dad and made a growling noise, making Tony laugh.
Steve rolled his eyes when he saw Tony making himself comfortable one Bucky’s knees. He’s lucky he chose Bucky or he would have more to worry about than one small smack to the bottom.
“Mama, Do you-“ Peter cut off and took a breath before just going for it and asking. “Do you think I could have a twitter account?”
“This all looks in order. I’ve been told that Bucky is crashing so this is more of a confirmation test rather than a full-scaled classification test?”
Peter posted the photo and locked his phone, he would look later to see what the response was. He had learned the hard way that spending too much time on his phone got it taken off him fairly quickly.
“In here Stevie!” Tony heard Bucky call back, letting them know he was in the living room. Tony made to go in but Steve stopped him in his tracks.
Their appointment wasn’t for another hour yet so they could afford to take their time getting the babies settled.
Clint nodded and without another word left to do as he was asked, giving Steve a moment to think that Clint was more suited to being an Omega than an Alpha. That was something to look into later, right now he had an Omega to sort out.
Clint looked up from the game he was playing, “ Yeah Tones. You look good naked, it’s probably way better than being in clothes- ”
Tony raised an eyebrow and tried to withhold a smile. “Maybe you’re not doing it, right? They never wake up when I do it and you did get Bucky in to the buggy without waking him so kudos for that.”
That made sense he supposed but he did feel the need to correct his Mama. “I’m not a little kid.” His eyes narrowed when he saw his Mama’s grin.
“Yes. You are Mama’s big boy. You’re way bigger than Jamie!” Well, that sounded like a cop-out to Peter but after his meltdown, he’d take what he could get.
“Mama.” Peter could hear the love and reverence in his voice as he said it like Mama was his whole world. Obviously Mama could too because he squeeze Bucky to him getting a coo of happiness out of the baby. Peter was kind of jealous, he wanted a cuddle as well.
He obviously said the right thing because Tony’s shoulders fell from their defensive position, and he cuddled deeper into Steve.
He thought about crying but that really went against his whole idea on being big and not letting his emotions get the better of him. Hmm, this was going to take some thinking. He’d have to find a way to let them know without seeming littler than he was. He looked over at Jamie; he was already fast asleep with his blankey covering half his head. It only took ten minutes of driving for Peter to feel his eyes go heavy. This car must have some sort of rocking part for the seats because it felt like he was in a hammock. There was nothing he could do against the soothing back and forth movements of the car. He was tired anyway. This was not a nap in anyway. Peter consoled himself with that thought as he fell asleep.
“Okay, we have a lot to explain, but first you need your baba and then a change. After that, we’ll explain it to the both of you okay?” He asked. Peter found himself nodding, happy that it was going to be explained to him at some point. He was kind of thirsty as well and he found that in the short time that his new Mama held him, he loved his cuddles. So when a bib was put on him and he was laid back so that he was reclined in his Mama’s arms, he found it no trouble at all to take the baba. His only trouble at the moment was staying awake.
“Amazing. Now Bucky I’m going to show you some blocks. I need you to take a look at them and sort them into three groups for me okay?” Bucky nodded eagerly, he liked blocks. They always looked so fun to play with.
Steve hugged Peter to him, running a hand through his hair in the same way Tony did the night before to him.
“Now, this is better than the fake one isn’t it?” He murmured, nosing at Tony’s gland on the side of this throat. He licked it once, twice, three times and Tony was clenching against him. Steve chuckled and kissed the spot pulling another moan out of Tony.
Mama places Peter gently on the floor. Peter remembered the last time he tried standing and he hurt his head. Not this time! He gripped onto the side of the chair, making sure his feet were planted solidly on the ground. He was proud that his legs didn’t shake like before, they felt a bit off-kilter but nothing he couldn’t handle if he put his arms out to steady himself. Maybe it was just because he woke up his legs felt like jelly? That had to be it.
Tony and Harley shared a look over Peter’s head. Peter wasn’t subtle in his jealousy but at the same time, he was completely oblivious to it.
Peter didn’t take into account the comfort he would get from being held while he was bottle fed and found himself losing the battle against sleep. He was more drinking out of comfort than anything else when he was coming to the end of the bottle, he whined when he felt it being removed and he was shuffled around until his head was resting on his Mama’s shoulder. He wiggled unhappily when a light patting started on his back, jumping slightly when a big burp came out.
The room went silent for a second as if collectively trying to process Steve’s attempt at a joke before Bucky let out a snort.
Steve and Tony shared another, more intimate look before Tony turned back to Peter. “We love you too, bambino. More than anything.” And if they both saw Peter smiling a bit, neither one said it. All just enjoying the silence of each other’s company at the end of a successful Halloween.
Clint snorted at the boy. “Oh, we get a hello now do we? Earlier on you only had eyes for Bucky. You could have gotten me out of that meeting too but no, you left me to listen to your Dad.”
Tony threw up the peace sign and continued to follow his family ignoring the pleas of his teammates.
Steve was going to defend himself against his little one but before he could hear another cry from the buggy. Bucky was awake, and by the sound of his wail, he was not one bit happy.
“Sure.” Captain America responded, “ I’ll need to see his face though. Petey, think you can show Daddy your pretty brown eyes?”
“Yeah well, I knew I’d never have lived down Tony essentially locking me in my room. This time though, I knew it was okay since Jarvis practically lit the way for me.” He said with a little thrust up, making Tony moan once more.
“You mated without consent?” He growled. Tony could admit privately that he was a lot more fearsome than Tony’s ever would be. Steve’s hands never stopped touching him even as he argued back with Bucky.
10 minutes later Peter was ready to start crying again. Why was getting undressed so difficult? He should have been able to do it fine but here he was with on strap of the overalls off and unable to undo the last one. He stopped himself from getting worked up. He knew it would do no good to get frustrated. Taking a deep breath he tried to wiggle it out again, nearly cheering when he
That was a relief. He was glad he hadn’t lost Aunt May. “So I have to wear a diaper?” He asked again, wanting to make sure it was necessary.
Tony smiled at the happy boy in the back of the car, eagerly munching on his apples and peanut butter.
Peter blinked at him. Huh. That was a lot easier than he thought it would be. “Yeah, Mama. Let’s do that!”
“Come on my cock or not at all. You know the rules.” Tony pushed back, sensing that Steve was close and if Steve was close that meant he didn’t have a lot of time.
“I know baby. Friday is a big meanie, isn’t she? Scaring my Peter like that. Will we spank her?” He asked the still crying baby in his arms, Peter giggled wetly at the thoughts of Friday getting a spanking.
Peter watched on smugly while his Daddy tried to calm Bucky down. He knew Bucky wouldn’t be happy in the buggy and he was right. He had taken Bucky out of the buggy straight away and was bouncing him up and down while Bucky sobbed. It was strange to Peter, why was Bucky acting so young even though he was able to hide it so well earlier? It confused Peter to why he was acting like a baby now. He asked his Mama who was also watching on, luckily he had an answer at the ready for him.
Peter shrugged. “I know he loves me but does he like me? I think he likes Harley better. They’re going to go down to Mama’s lab and leave me up here like they always do.”
Tony messed around on his phone after that, answering emails and setting up meetings for the week ahead until enough time had passed that he didn’t feel bad waking Peter up.
Natasha stared at him for a long time, long enough that Peter glanced back at his parents who gave him a nod of encouragement.
“God you feel good.” Steve rubbed up and down Tony’s stomach, making sure that the back of his fingers passed over his straining cock, earning a moan off of Tony, pre-come leaking from the tip.
Tony felt Peter trembling and pulled him closer. He knew Peter wouldn’t understand the whole traditional aspect. Maybe that was his fault. He did tend to baby him a lot but in his defence, Omega’s were always more innocent and affectionate compared to Beta’s and Alphas. This was why he told Steve to let him break it to Peter first before he came in and explained the rest.
“You have loads of questions. You can answers as many as possible until dinner is ready and then no more phone for the evening okay?”
Instead of answering Tony rubbed their noses together, effectively ending the near pout on Peter’s face. Instead, the boy scrunched up his nose and giggled slightly.
“Steve,” Tony muttered embarrassed, here he was, legs thrown wide open on either side of Steve’s thighs as his hole was filled to the brim while Steve’s best friend watched on and there was literally nothing he could do about it. His cheeks reddened and his cock jumped, getting a laugh out of Bucky, which made it jump again.
Peter sucked hard on the thing in his mouth as he weighed up the options. He really wanted a cookie, he loved cookies but he didn’t want to face everyone in the room. What if they made fun of him for dressing like a baby? Then again, apparently in this crazy world, Mr Stark was his Mama and Captain America was his Daddy. Didn’t that mean that they would beat anyone up who would laugh at him? He’d also have to face everyone soon, he couldn’t live out the rest of his life in Mr Starks neck, no matter how nice it was there. Coming to a decision he poked his head out of Mr Starks neck and came face to face with Captain America, who was smiling gently at him.
Peter pumped his fist in the air. “Yes! See Mama, I bet if I go onto my twitter I’ll have a blue tick and everything!”
“Dad! I’m home! Where are you?” Peter called, looking around the living room for his Dad. His heat was finally over and Peter wanted a cuddle. He hated being away from his Dad for so long. He even asked Aunt May to move into the tower so he wouldn’t have to go between the two houses.
Clint’s muscles were too much like jelly for him to move so Bucky just picked him up and carried him to the chair.
Peter was all but dragging Tony out to the living room where the rest were waiting. Peter threw his arms out when they were in front of everyone.
“Now they can’t say you’re not my son,” Tony said as they walked towards the school doors, taking Peter’s bag from him and throwing an arm over his shoulder.
I read back on the first 3 chapters, I'm not too happy with how they're written. I'm going to have to go back at some point and edit them.
Steve was not having any luck with Peter either. He took one look at the needle going into his brother’s bottom and began to sob as well.
“Awh uncle Bruce, did Mama and Papa put you up to that?” Peter asked, before realising what he said. “Not- Not that I don’t like them, because I love chocolate covered raisins. They’re the best kind of raisins, not that I’m allowed them because you know Dad and Papa are health nuts but that’s fine as well but I really love sweets so thanks uncle Bruce for trying. You’re  the best though.” Peter babbled nervously.
Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair before throwing on a clean t-shirt. He’d showered earlier in the afternoon, and that had to count for something at least. He didn’t keep up with hygiene issues when he was off from SI duties. Tony sprinted out of the lab and followed the marbled corridor that led to the dining room. He stopped just outside the wooden French doors, grateful that the frosted windows allowed him that extra nanosecond he needed to paint a sunny smile on his face.
Tony-dupe laughed, the sound rich and vibrant, and even though he knew the entity wasn’t Tony, it mimicked his velvety laugh perfectly. The sound washed over Steve, soothing his aching heart. It had been a long time since he’d heard his friend express happiness.
An electric current suddenly raked its claws across Steve’s skin, digging its nails into the vulnerable sides of his bruised torso. Steve’s nostrils filled with ozone. He recognized that magic was the cause behind the energy, and he braced himself to meet the caster. Steve shook his head, and the action loosened the beads of sweat sitting in the hairs of his tired brows. Large drops rained down his face, mining through layers of grime, desperation, and resolve.
“Shh, d-don’t talk,” Tony choked, shaking his head. He ordered Friday to scan Steve’s body, and Steve knew the action was meaningless. He was dying, and nothing could stop Death from taking her claim. Strange and Queens shuffled near, but their footsteps were drowned out by Bucky’s voice.
“What is this?” Steve demanded in a strained voice. He continued to stare at the empty place Alaric had stood in only moments before. “Who…what…are you?” He felt a shift in the weight still sitting in his legs, and he knew Peggy was gone.
Tony hated projects with time limits– there was always so much expectation attached to deadlines. Pepper was expecting a complete end to the horrors that had plagued their lives for the last few months, but she was in for a rude surprise. Trauma has a way of sticking to a person after he or she experiences a tragedy, and while Tony sometimes envied the rose colored glasses that seemed to be super-glued to Pepper’s face, he knew that Father Time had no liking for them. Sooner or later, his girlfriend would be forced to face the bitter truth – there was no going back to once was for either one of them.
“Well good morning, my darling,” she greeted, walking over to hand Steve the plate. “I was wondering when you were going to get out of bed. It’s not like you to sleep so late.”
The determined expression on Alaric’s face was one Steve was familiar with. He’d seen it every day in the mirror during his childhood. He ruffled the boy’s hair and took a moment to marvel at its softness. “Do as your mother says,” he encouraged. “It won’t take but a minute, and then you and I can talk about this fishing trip.”
The landing was brutal, and Steve felt his teeth tear into the sensitive flesh of his cheeks like a starved animal. One exhausted heartbeat passed, then another, the sensation filling his head with white noise. He forced his tired body to stand, spitting out a large pool of blood that stained the earth the vibrant color of a Camilla bloom. Steve saw Iron Man finally rise in his peripheral vision, and the sight granted him a fourth wind. His body was running on wispy vapors so delicate his breath threatened to send them out into the void. He had just enough energy left to make sure that Tony got to safety.
exactly?” Steve hissed, spearing Tony-dupe with an unyielding gaze. “I know I died. I embraced death as I took my last breaths. Did you resurrect me on Thanos’ orders? Is my consciousness in a computer simulation? Are you planning to rewrite my brain? If your goal is to use me to do harm, I’ll fight you every step of the way, no matter what the cost.”
“It’s too soon, Buck! Tony isn’t supposed to be here! The team hasn’t had time to regroup! This is all wrong!”
Steve’s mouth fell open and he stared at Tony-dupe with wide eyes. “What does that mean?” he wheezed. “What are you saying?”
Tony swallowed hard and nodded. He dropped his eyes to the floor and gently pulled his hands from Pepper’s grasp. “So what now? I bought this house for you, you know,” he reminded. “It wouldn’t be right to make you leave your new home.”
“Not many are willing to give me a dual role of life and death,” Tony-dupe explained. It reached out and loosened the hard grip that Steve had on his biceps, encouraging him to rest his arms at his sides. “Most regard me as an infinite end, a complete loss of being. But really, all I am is a guide.”
see one another again because Clint had left his belongings in the Tower, and if Clint was coming back, Tony knew that Natasha would eventually follow. Banner had chosen to take everything he owned when he’d run off into the night, which had been an obvious message stating he didn’t want to be found. Bruce’s silent departure had stung in a way Tony had yet to process, as had Cap’s. Steve hadn’t even bothered to stop by the Tower. He’d just vanished into the void without a word.
Steve’s trembling fingers lost their grip on Thanos’ fist, and his hands fell limp at his side.  Gravity gently pulled him down toward the waiting embrace of fragrant earth, whispering of silence and forgiveness and rest. He locked eyes with Thanos, staring down the arrogant greed filling the alien’s irises, and the ghost of a smirk touched his blood-stained lips.
A wet rattle vibrated in her lungs, and the sound set Steve’s nerves on fire. He had to get her out now.  Steve palmed the crown of Natasha’s head and held her close for a few heartbeats, knowing she would understand that he was saying goodbye.
The event in Wakanda had filled Steve’s mind with a terrible sensation of finality, a total shutdown of consciousness with no return ticket. And yet, here he was, breathing, thinking, feeling. He should be frightened at the thought of not knowing exactly where he was,
“Why, individuals play a big part in this decision,” Tony-dupe offered, tilting its head. “And that, my darling, is why you are here.”
The man’s mouth was moving, but Tony couldn’t hear what he was saying. The only thing he could focus on was the anger burning in the man’s eyes – anger he knew was directed at him.
The attack was laser-hot, and it tore through Steve’s mid-section like a heated knife cutting through butter. His lungs seized around the air trapped within, and Steve choked as the organs began to fill with blood. Cold air swept into the open pit that was once held several vital tissues, cooling the blood that rushed toward the gaping wound. Azure eyes filled with terrified awe, erasing the remaining resolve from Steve’s face. He knew in his heart that his fight was finally done – there was no way the serum could compete with the amplified power that Thanos wielded.
Peggy slid nimble fingers up Steve’s arms and let them settle on his shoulders. She gave the tense muscles beneath her hands a light squeeze before guiding Steve into a metal chair with rounded corners. He jumped when her lips pressed a kiss to his temple. “My, my, you’re so tense this morning, my darling. You’ll feel better after you’ve eaten.”
The day’s events had drained Tony in the worst of ways, and he found that he didn’t even want to protest as he was led to bed. “Are you going to tuck me in and read me a bedtime story, Cap?”
“You didn’t get caught up in Steve’s world, Pepper, you got caught up in mine,” Tony intoned, jumping to his feet. “
“Hello, Captain Rogers,” she offered in a tight voice. She kept her eyes glued to Tony’s face. “I didn’t know that you were expecting company, Tony.”
Tony dreamed of New York. He was surrounded by an icy chill and shadow and silence, but there was a large star pushing through it all. Its bright light illuminated Tony’s vision as the star drew closer toward him, and soon the only thing Tony could see was Captain America pushing through the chaos pulling Tony down into the abyss.
Steve forced himself to take a few bites of his eggs, and he took a drink from the cup of coffee that seemed to have manifested out of thin air. He stared at Peggy as she moved about the kitchen, piling an exorbitant amount of bacon on another plate. She was wearing a flattering red, shirtwaist dress adorned with black buttons. The calm air was filled with a soft staccato melody sung by the chunky, black heels she wore on her feet, and Steve found himself being lulled by the sound. The tension slowly bled from his muscles, and he offered Peggy an affectionate smile as she stacked a small mountain of bacon on his plate.
Pepper snorted and walked toward her suitcases. “I’m catching a red-eye back to New York. I’ll send you an email when I get in. The car will be waiting for you at the airport.”
A comfortable silence took root between them, and for just a moment, Tony could pretend that he was sitting back at the Tower. For just a heartbeat, he could pretend that the rest of the gang was busy washing up before coming into the dining room because no one liked to have Cap’s disapproving smile aimed his or her way – it felt like being stabbed in the heart.
The hairs rose on the back of Steve’s neck, and he raised both shields high, blocking blows from both sides. He pushed against the force of electric spears aimed at his torso and sent the Chitauri wielding them out toward the center of the field. Blood rushed through his system with the force of a tsunami, the pressure of the discharge pounding in his temples.
Steve ran, tearing through any Chitauri that dared to step in his way. One of the aliens managed to knock his feet from beneath him, and he rolled into the fall, jumping back up as soon as he found some traction. They had all been fighting beside a united world army for two days, fending off wave after wave of enemy forces without any real rest. Sam and Natasha were at a severe disadvantage due to lacking the enhancements that pushed Steve, Bucky, and T’Challa to keep moving forward.
Steve wakes up in a familiar place, surrounded by familiar faces, and it seems mission assignments have followed him into the hereafter.
Someone called Steve’s name in the distance, and the sound filled the jagged cracks in his spirit, igniting the strange warmth burning in his heart. The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn’t place the owner. He wanted to turn, to seek out the voice, but the anguish in Tony’s eyes held him fast, and Steve found all he could do was hold on to the warmth and wait for Tony to release him.
