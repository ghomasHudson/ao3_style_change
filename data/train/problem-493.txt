Yeah so I didn’t think the last one would be that sad. I’m trying to speed this along to get them together but it’s hard to do with all the damage Moftiss have done to them. Fixing them is not easy. Still, here goes nothing...
“Yeah— yeah I gathered,” John says. He doesn’t notice how close he and Sherlock are as they step slowly from side to side. All he knows is that he feels incredibly warm and at peace. He feels like if this moment could last a lifetime that he would be happy for it. The song is sensual and soft and adds to the tranquillity of the moment, but the singer’s voice seems to evoke a sort of longing desire. John suddenly recalls the so-called ‘heartbreak theme’ of Sherlock’s routine so far and begins to wonder at the significance of the words the artist is expressing. “What does it mean?” He whispers in a haze, staring into Sherlock’s ever-changing eyes, almost without meaning to.
“Not quite. But yes, you left it in the cab,” William answered “and it was either the engagement party tonight or yoga with Irene, so I thought that...”
Sherlock purrs but despite John’s efforts, blinks himself awake. “Mmm’ nope. ‘S too late, John. ‘M already up. You woke me - terribly bad form,” he slurs.
John climbs up the stairs to 221B, a sleeping Rosie in one arm and her day bag strapped over the other shoulder. Remembering this morning John knocks on the door and listens carefully for any noise inside.
“God bless you, John Watson.” Sherlock praised sarcastically as John continued, “... and if supporting them on the most important day of their lives–”
He sighs and begins to meticulously prepare another bite for Rosie, who waits patiently for him. John sees that Sherlock’s fingers seem to shake a bit and finally takes the utensils away from him, saying, “Oi, you okay?”

But seriously I had no idea they were going to get so sad. I was expecting Sherlock to have a string of lovers and being all devil-may-care about it while John was angry and like: no Sherlock you’re mine rarr! Like right from the get-go (which he is Kinda) but fuck me I guess I just like to see them suffer. Wow I’m a dick.
“Obviously.” Sherlock answers tersely from his position on the ground. He hadn’t heard her come in, the vile witch, a testament to how tired he was.
Sherlock swings the woman up and twirls her once more, their legs kicking out once more. As the song comes to an end they perform one last flip and again Sherlock catches Iris safely, she twirls away from him one last time so that when the sorrowful voice sings its last note Sherlock is reaching out for her sitting on the ground and she has gone back to the space she’d hidden in before the song has started. John is simply awed.
he thinks, but he uneasily brings his gaze back to Henry. Dorian hands Sherlock what looks to be a Long Island iced Tea before Sherlock can say anything more. Sherlock smiles politely at the older man and raises his drink in salute. Dorian, beside him, bounces with energy, taking out his phone and instantly yelling, “Smile you’re on camera!” As he reverses the screen for a selfie with the group.
“Yyyyep.” Sherlock answers, popping some chicken from his own meal into his mouth and then feeding one piece to Rosie.
Next week: Bouquet and balloons, Watson, Harriet. (“Unf! John isn't she perfect?” John slammed the door in the delivery guy's face.)
Molly sits in the VIP section next to a few friends of the other competitors. It’s currently intermission and she’s waiting on Sherlock or Irene to text her from backstage. The two of them have been frustrated at their lack of clues and, according to Sherlock, they had had a major argument about Irene hiding some things about the investigation. Molly still finds it hard to believe Sherlock trusts her, after how things ended the first time the two of them worked together. Then again, Molly felt that she was stupid enough to freaking date Jim Moriarty before she knew he was an obsessed psychopath, so she probably shouldn’t be judging Irene for wanting to use him to get to the Holmes brothers. At least Irene hadn’t fallen for him. Not that Molly had been in LOVE with Jim, but…. She’d hoped since at the time she had been so hung up on Sherlock, that he could have been an opportunity for a relationship. She sighs as she checks her phone for the fifth time since the current dancers began their performance.
He’s so happy he could cry. Thinking that that might be a little too embarrassing for him he decides instead to pull John’s face towards himself, begging for another heated kiss. John surprises him however, and gives him something even better.
But before Sherlock finishes a look of realization dawns on John’s face as a single name runs through his mind: Janine! “You utter bastard.” He suddenly says, enraged, “You’re doing this again? What the hell kind of a case would justify this? Going this far? Are you bloody serious, Sherlock?”
At Sherlock’s voice Rosie struggles in John’s arms to point at the door and the broken monitor while she says, “Oops! Uh-oh! Mess, Shewah!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “May I have a scotch, three fingers, no ice, please?” He asked the bartender.
that she told you the last time she spoke to you all those years ago. Aside from all that, she’s also…  my friend? Sort of? I mean she’s annoying but I quite enjoy her company.
John made his way into the New York Journal's offices following the instruction of a receptionist at the front. He had been glad to hear the Sherlock was still employed by the paper. John walked briskly to a corner desk in the back row, next to a few cubicles, that had a sleek metal name tag with the name 'William Sherlock Scott Holmes', neatly printed in gold letters. It was plain to see that this was where he worked, but John couldn't see any other sign of Sherlock anywhere. It was late at night, however, so there was a huge possibility that Sherlock had already gone home.
John hears his mistake as it is repeated back to him and tries to calm the explosion that is sure to erupt at any moment, he raises his hands, placating, “No, Sherlock that’s not what I–”
John takes in a deep breath and exhales slowly but the evidence that it has no effect is quite clear when he hisses, “And how many more waiters are we going to encounter on our nice family outings?”
Sherlock laughed and bowed again. He then pretended to struggle as sat down on the bar, swinging his feet like a child. “Next round is on me!” He shouted and laughed again, tipping slightly and steading himself on John. Everyone around the room cheered and went back to their peaceful drinking, the concerns over Jennifer Wilson seemingly forgotten.
On the car ride home Harry regaled John with stories about her modelling adventures in New York and LA as well as about her most recent girlfriend... all the way from the airport to John's flat.
Please be reminded that my experience with this stuff (the smut) just comes from other fan fictions so I may be incredibly inaccurate. (I’ve mentioned it before but I’m actually asexual lol) I have a basic understanding and whatever I've read in other fics. I’m just making this shit up as I go and hoping that it sounds in character for them. Can’t really imagine it myself so you can imagine my difficulties writing this chapter but despite that I think it’s relatively okay? I’m definitely happier with how this story turned out as opposed to my other fanfics thus far (does this mean I’m getting ... better?)
Sherlock turns to his closet, then checks the time on his phone again, “Fine,” he huffs, throwing hands up in the air in surrender, “Fine! Do as you like.”
“Ah... noooo. I work Saturday nights, remember? Here,” He tossed a box of chocolates into her hands, “from the bride and groom.”
John lies awake all night after bringing Rosie home. His inability to sleep tonight confounds him. He was sure that after the exhausting case he’d had with Sherlock that he’d be more tired by now, but he just can’t shake this odd feeling that’s been with him ever since he and Sherlock had been on this recent case.
Stupid movie. Stupid Johnlock. Stupid sentiment! Stupid fluff. I hate you. I want more hilarity. >:(
John grabbed him by the back of his neck and pulled him forward, sliding his fingers into Sherlock's still wet curls and grinding their naked bodies together as the kiss got deeper and heavier by the moment. Sherlock finally pulled away and slid himself downwards, his eyes dilated and his kiss-swollen lips looking plump and pink. He continued staring into John's eyes as he scraped his teeth against another nipple, licking and tugging at the flesh gently. John felt more than heard the soft whimpering noise he made as he felt his dick harden to a more impossibly stiffened state. His breathing grew more and more ragged and his skin felt hot, like he was on fire.
Irene put on her sunglasses and smirked, “If you say so. Hold on tight Johnny this is not going to be a slow ride!” She backed out of her parking spot in under a second and quickly merged them into traffic, swerving this way and that as she floored it.
The man rolled his eyes, imperiously “Your speech, John. Lovely story about your comradely with our Bill.”
Sherlock takes his dance partner’s hand – and squeezes it for support. Molly smiles at them both as they breathe. Just two more couples and they’ll be on next. Here goes nothing.
“From the very beginning, Harriet and Mary,” John stepped aside to read as the show commenced “were destined for each other.”
“John why didn't you ever mention Humphrey?” Mary asked around Harry's head as Harry popped a fry into her mouth, doing her best to not look at John.
“This isn't fun Sherlock, it's morbid and creepy and...” But John knew even as he said it that he didn't really mean it. He hadn't had this much excitement since Afghanistan. The closest he'd gotten was running back and forth between two weddings a couple of months ago.
“Irene… you’ve barely told me anything.” Sherlock had whispered, a hand reaching for one of hers, “You’ve been keeping me in the dark - of course, we’re hitting a dead end. I’m probably going after clues that have nothing to do with your own case!”
“And that – whenever he’s rude you never say anything to him. And now apparently you’re defending him?” His girlfriend suddenly looks very irritated. Apparently John’s response was the wrong answer.
“She’s not coming to dinner then?” John asks, for lack of a better thing to say. Of course, he wants to ask how Rosie could possibly know her name, but among that question are so many more questions as well. Now that Irene is gone, however, he feels suddenly very nervous and he only ends up voicing the first question that comes to mind. On top of that, Sherlock looks… well, as good as ever, really, but there’s something subtly even more attractive about him than usual. He can’t quite put his finger on what it is though.
In this moment, as her big brother performed for her this song that was so incredibly precious, miraculous even, Eurus felt the loss of her opportunity to feel this for anyone incredibly deeply. She felt sad that she almost didn’t understand it, that she probably would never experience it with another human being. It was rather sad and more than a little infuriating, but Eurus held no contempt for her brother. Instead of anger with him, she felt honored that he would share this piece of himself with her. She felt pleased that he wasn’t afraid to allow her to see this thing that he had that she might be tempted to covet. This is what he’d tried to explain to her.
“I'm sorry, could you just give us a tic, Harry?” John requested, “I'm going to bring him over here, for just a second, talk to him – talk about you.” He took Sherlock by the arm and lead him away as Harry nodded her assent.
“Oh, you know what else? I've been thinking a lot about what you said and I think you're right.” John stared at Harry as she spoke, “I think it would be so special if I did a wedding just like mum and dad's,”
During the applause at Bill's wedding there were some rather enthusiastic drunkards cheering and in one distracted moment one of the drunken groomsmen somehow elbowed John on the head and knocked him out cold.
The video feed cuts to Sherlock and Iris (Irene) in a studio, holding each other and prancing about the room while Iris chants, “And one and two and, that’s it…” The video cuts again, this time to both of them sitting snuggled close to each other on the floor, Sherlock’s arm thrown casually around her as they wipe their brows. Sherlock’s voice speaks over the scene, saying, “We’ve been practicing non-stop for this number, as usual but I feel like I’m finally getting the hang of getting in some down time.”
“How are you two feeling?” Claudia asks. Irene barely stops herself from glaring as the woman pulls away.
John sat on a stool in Mrs. Watson's little shop as his mother spoke to him sternly, “Look, Johnny all I'm trying to say is that the two of you are siblings, and it breaks my heart to see you both this way,”
“Well, there you have it, you got us all to cry for you Sherlock. Well done. Now go on up and go tell Claudia all about it,” Tess encourages and Sherlock and Irene disappear up some stairs to go talk to another hostess.
“Sherlock?!” Mycroft's voice was in a panic over the phone, as he shouted into the receiver shakily, “Sherlock?! What have you taken?! Did you make a list? Sherlock please, when I get to you, please, have a list. I'm coming over! Stay–”
John looked around the shop guiltily, then brought his gaze back to Sherlock, “... You want to find the ugliest things in the store and register Harry for them?” He asked, by way of apology.
Edit: I edited chapters 1 & 2. They're not perfect but they might be a little better. Sherlock was way too happy at the end of Chapter 2. Like, whoa man calm down.
Harry didn't notice, “Oh! And guess what? That writer that you obsess about? He wants to do a whole commitments column on us in the Journal. He called me! Can you believe it?”
“I knew you’d recognize me,” the young man says, “Henry tells me you asked him not to alert me when you got here,” and Sherlock can practically hear the pout in his voice as he slips an arm around him and squeezes even closer asking, “Have I done something wrong?”
Molly is dumbfounded. She sits there, continuing to gape, even after the screen has switched to other celebrities. She doesn’t know what to do. She’s shocked in the most confusing way. She does know one thing though, and that’s that she has got to tell John. She can’t tell him now, of course, because he’s on his date, but as soon as he gets back… but then, maybe Sherlock doesn’t want John to know? Why else would he be avoiding him, after all? Oh, but this is such a strange and tempting story to tell! Molly isn’t normally one for gossip, but this is Sherlock – dancing - on live television, on a popular celebrity dance show known for its glitz, glamour and, and, and, sequins.
Tess interrupts with a laugh, “Yes I can’t imagine what Adele feels about that Americanized version of her song!”
John releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. He grins widely and takes a step towards the two people he loves most in the world.  “Yes, yes I think that’s alright,” he says in a hushed tone. He reaches a hand towards Sherlock, who slowly brings his face back into view, revealing an adorable pink dusting on his cheeks, the remnants of a blush. Sherlock takes John’s hand and pulls him forward until their foreheads touch and their lips are only a couple of inches apart.
“I was just bidding my time. I knew you'd show up.” Sherlock said smugly and moved his coffee closer to the edge of the table as the waitress came over to re-fill his cup.
“Yes, exactly my thoughts, it's why I insisted.” Sherlock nodded at Mary, looking quite satisfied with this solution.
“I would hope it’s unnecessary, but yes.” Sherlock says, watching as John squirts some lube into his palm and begins to stroke his dick. “Now,” Sherlock says, lifting his hips slightly, “Are you going to fuck me, Doctor Watson, or are you going to continue to tease?”
me.” John’s grin feels like it’s been permanently fixed to his face. Sherlock blushes prettily but doesn’t respond. John’s smile grows wider and he hungrily takes another deep kiss from Sherlock’s lips. He feels almost drunk on the taste of him as he tells him, “I love you too, Sherlock. You know that now, right? You
A similar thing had happened at Bill's wedding, where John had held onto the man's suit jacket while Bill staggered doing his best not to miss the urinal.
John can’t help it. His eyes flick momentarily to Sherlock’s lips and he just barely stops himself from reaching out to touch them.
In the next one (a 1920's male tailcoat complete with black top hat and monocle), John danced with a cane and did tricks with the hat.
John glared at Sherlock and pulled his arm back and using it to punch Sherlock in the face, shoving him back a few paces on the pavement. “No, Sherlock! No! You don't touch me! You don't
“Sherlock– I,” John gasped as Sherlock's mouth clamped around a nipple, “I never do this,” John said, his back arching slightly as he rubbed against Sherlock, “–with men I mean. Not since...
“J-John.” Sherlock finally heard himself rasp. Where was John? Where had John gone? Sherlock wanted John back.
“Well,” John says, “guess i know what I’m doing when I get home. D’you think Greg knows? He’d have a laugh.”
John tiptoes into the house, balancing the still sleeping baby in one arm while he locks the door behind him.
Sherlock tilts his head in thought and answers, “Hmm, I think we’re ready to order actually, John?” He looks to the doctor for confirmation.
John spoke through the laughter, “As they grew up they both shared the same level of dedication and commitment to their education.” This was followed by a photograph of Mary on her graduation day, and one of Harriet dressed as a cheerleader with her hand halfway up another cheerleader's skirt and whispering into her ear with a look that was less than innocent. Laughter rang out in the room again.
Eventually Sherlock’s nerves calm a bit and his body relaxes as they sit in silence, just being there for each other. And that’s actually rather nice. They both unconsciously move closer to each other, Sherlock silently sharing his blanket and John accepting is as they concentrate on the movie.
“We have no idea,” Greg cuts in, “The police report that Francis gave when people started to look into Hallward’s disappearance only said that Basil came to an Estate that Dorian owns in Selby. And as for your other question – apparently Francis was on Henry’s payroll at the time, but he was living with and working for Gray.”
John ignored her and turned to the man who would be running the projector saying, “Alright, it's unlocked right now and you'll find the file on the desktop under the title
“Oh stuff it Irene, just lead the damn way will you? We're this far from late! and here!” He pulled a plastic bag out from under the clothes bag he was holding and handed it to her as they neared her vehicle “I brought you a kerchief for your pocket, a pair of my cufflinks, and some paracetamol... now about your hair...”
Josh is the only boy i named (and i named him Josh so that Sherlock wouldn't get in trouble when he made J- and Jo- noises while gettin it on) that Sherlock slept with and I couldn't just leave him hanging with no text reply. He and the second guy Sherlock slept with in the story that I didn't name - are officially dating now, and yes, the guy's anme starts with J, like Josh's because I needed something for Sherlock to write on the paper and I thought it would be funny if I continued with the theme of Sherlock's lovers having J names. But yes, everyone gets a happy ending! Woo!
“It’s fine John,” She sighs as she goes and calls to him when she gets to the front door, “I’ll be home late tonight, by the way. Girls and I are doing our book club tonight because Jenny’s daughter has a school play on our usual night.”
A few minutes later Sherlock’s handsome brunet exits the bathroom and with a fond expression removes the note after reading it. “Your clothes are in the front hall and living room. Don’t worry about the locking up when you go. -SH” it reads. Of course. The brunet recalls how the older man had cried out another man’s name last night as his pleasure had peaked and he kisses the note softly. He had expelled it with such longing. He really couldn’t find it in himself to be angered. He’d stayed, knowing the other man had needed this, but he could never have predicted that he’d catch a glimpse of the person he had been standing in for. He pads his way over to the living room and hall to collect and put on his clothes. He looks around the desk for a second until he finds what he’s looking for. Picking up a pen and paper he writes a note himself and after he’s fully dressed stabs it to the door of the room he (correctly) assumes to be his host’s. With that done the man follows his host’s instructions and leaves, not bothering with the locks on the doors.
“Hush, John!” Sherlock hissed, imploring him with his eyes to remain silent. “DI, Dimock?” Sherlock asked as he noticed the young detective hesitating.
“Cheers,” John says, then adds, “Dorian… was it?” Again, his mouth takes over for him while his brain plays catch-up.
The lights came back on and the room stared around at each other awkwardly. Irene got up quickly from her seat and tapped Archie on her way over to John.
Honestly, this was originally meant to be light-hearted and without quite so much mutual pining... but it's now Pine Central up in here.
With that John yanked his cane out of Sherlock's hands and walked towards his apartment building without so much as a by your leave.
“You’re on!” The boy shouts back, barely audible above the music, then he, Gladys and Sherlock huddle together and step closer towards the inside of the circle.
Sherlock pets John’s hair and stares up at the ceiling, willing himself not to allow any sort of tears. “It was...” he begins, then swallows, clearing his throat lightly, “It happened while I was away,” he reveals. “Mor-“ and he clears his throat again at the mention of the name of one of the people he most fears, “sorry, Moriarty’s network was... vast and - unpleasant. It wasn’t - look, I’m fine, now., so just don’t-”
' “Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor, do I look like I'm joking? Turn, face me. We'll play a game.” William took John's hand in his, feeling its warmth and the callouses in his palm while making a slow circle on John's wrist with his thumb.
John frowns at this comment and at where he thinks this is going - Sherlock and Irene did brilliantly - and he didn’t notice a single moment in which they were ‘off-tempo’ – sure John isn’t an expert, but he’s still pretty sure that Sherlock and Irene were near perfect. It seems some of the members of the audience agree with him as some of them begin to grumble and hiss in the background. Craig doesn’t seem bothered as he continues, “I like that you’re trying to keep a theme, and while yes, the song choice is refreshing in the sense that we haven’t heard it before and it’s not the same old jailhouse rock… well, It’s originally a ballad for a reason. To be honest I almost would have preferred a song I’ve seen performed before. The jive is a very happy dance - these lyrics and your theme, well they just don’t fit too well with it. I understand you’re attached to your story but I’m just not seeing it mesh. Yes, yes you ended the song apart and it was all rather cutesy, but it’s not the same emotional pull that perhaps a waltz to the original version of the song would have had.”
“Any chance we could maybe use your mobile?” John asked the bartender politely from where he had moved to stand beside Sherlock.
Sherlock doesn’t appear to notice and just shrugs at Dorian’s response, “Sometimes it pays to stay safe,” he says, obviously referring to his and Irene’s mistake. He looks like he’s trying to end the conversation. Irene catches Dorian’s barely-there wince at the response. Sherlock speaks distractedly to himself just as their competitors on-screen attempt a daring lift. They slip, just barely, but the judges will surely notice, as has Sherlock, as he comments “– oh watch your – tsk, they’re offbeat now,”
Sherlock grunts softly as he pushes back against the strong warm soft body behind him, his hands braced on his desk while the owner of that body grips his hips more forcefully than before.
. They didn’t shame his struggle and his sobriety was shown as the victory it was. Many people, especially fans, were incredibly kind and showed their support for him. The sentimentality of the story and his ability to be vulnerable with everyone made him so much more approachable now. He gained much more supporters than Molly had thought he would with just that interview and it looked like he hadn’t lost any on the way. And how could he have, when he had spoken with such great sincerity? Molly had nearly cried at seeing it. Sherlock was showing a side of himself to London that he’d never shown them before and it was working to his advantage - the people were proving to be just as infatuated with him as Molly was, despite (or perhaps because of) his flaws. They were seeing the man beneath the coat and, clearly, they loved what they saw.
John huffed out a breath through his smile, “Yeah... horrible, mad, crush. Mad. Absolutely insane,” he sighed, “but you'll be fine Mary.” He patted her arm as he opened the door, “You'll get somebody in this position who will stay for two years, maximum, because that's what acceptable and appropriate–” Mary stopped him then as she crowded in closer to him, pulled his shirt towards her and kissed him awkwardly.
“A nightmare?” She asks, looking worried and John suddenly realizes it’s morning. He must have fallen asleep in the guest bedroom.
Sherlock almost rolled his eyes at the joke. He looked at the hands and thought for a moment. If he were this man, where would he put the poison bottle, this hand... or that one...? Of course.
...? I think is the technical term...” The way Sherlock is looking at him is confusing the hell out of him completely, it’s the look he gets when he’s discovered something new, and John adds, “Sorry, I always assumed you knew that?”
“... Yes, definitely on the dancefloor by now…” Sherlock is saying, apparently having deduced Jack’s location.
“Either way we need to see what we can glean out of these people. Irene is working on flirting information out of every woman she can get her claws into. We’re looking at three that would have likely known Basil or Dorian’s Servant or at least how he died – Lady Brandon’s daughter – Camille, Henry’s wife – Victoria, and Henry’s sister – Gwendolyn, who have all been close enough to the three of them that they might know something.
“Thanks for coming!” Jim answered, looking decidedly drunk hanging from his fiancée Sebastian's neck.
Sherlock’s face seems to pale at that, but still he says nothing, only nodding minutely for the judge to continue.
Sherlock and John swore in panic as the car slipped off the road and onto the the grass zig-zagging across the wet planes this way and that until it turned full circle and slid backwards until the back of the car hit what must have been a large boulder.
John rolls his eyes at the grouchy voice in his head, “Alright, Sherlock, good point,” he whispers, “though fuck if I know any of your habits with romantic partners,” he adds. ‘God, Watson, talking to yourself now?’ His own voice in his head asks. He shakes his thoughts away and decides to just go check the bedroom quietly. If Sherlock is with his boyfriend, John will do the decent thing and leave, and if he’s alone... well, maybe John will make him some tea and dinner. He’s sure Sherlock most likely hasn’t eaten.
Sherlock tilts his head, “um... that’s not what I meant - I, um. I know it is,” Sherlock looks down at his feet and, was that a blush?
John knocked on the door of Mary's flat. “Hey, I need your registry list,” He said when Harry finally opened the door with a large grin on her face. She didn't open it all the way though and only peaked out through it asking nervously, “Hi! I, er... thought you were going to wait downstairs?”
Sherlock’s pleased expression falters, “Ah no, I’m afraid I’ve been keeping my involvement with Strictly a bit of a secret from John. I’m sure if he finds out he’ll be impossible to live with, teasing me about the glitter and all that.” He winks at the screen, and gives a small chuckle. “Shhh. No one tell him. It’ll be a fun surprise,” he says in mock whisper.
Sherlock glares as he slips into it and makes his way to the loo. His look only makes Irene laugh harder. “
John smiles at her. She’s so sweet and thoughtful. He worries for her sometimes - about how much she genuinely cares for Sherlock. She coddles him almost as if he were her son but at the same time is so devoted to him. He hopes that someday she meets someone who will love her the way she deserves to be loved.
!' sort of look but it failed to catch her attention) she kept prattling on, “He keeps them but pretends he doesn't, but he does.”
A very camp man with an accent who is nearest the hostess answers, clapping, “Oh, marvelous! Simply marvelous, darling! Oh, you had such a perfect routine this week, there’s not much I can say! Your expression! Your feeling! My god! What can I say? Just wonderful! Simply wonderful!”
It has been just over a year since all the horrible business with Culverton and Eurus. John is still guilty about the beating he dealt to Sherlock and the easy way with which his friend seemed to forgive him. Sherlock has always had a great and noble heart. He’s proved it time and time again. John recalls the conversation he’d once had with Mycroft about Sherlock’s kindness. “My brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher yet he elects to be a detective. What might we deduce about his heart?” At the time John hadn’t known what Mycroft had meant. Sherlock cared for people, in his own way and his capacity for kindness was a great one. After all, choosing to use his gifted mind to solve crimes and help provide justice certainly says something about who Sherlock really is. Sherlock has even forgiven Eurus for her misgivings because he cares for her. He continues to visit his sister to this day. How often he does so is a mystery to John, but he can always tell when Sherlock has seen her. His eyes always seem glassy after a visit with The East Wind, like he’s in a far-off place, a solemn cloud following him. John doesn’t stay over long on those days, not unless he’s with Rosie, as she seems to be the only thing that ever rises Sherlock out of his depressions. Her or a case anyway. John has tried, but his meddling always seems to just irritate Sherlock further. He sighs. He’s been an awful friend to Sherlock ever since he returned, so he’s not entirely surprised that Sherlock doesn’t want him around during those difficult moments. John doesn’t bother with wishing he could take things back though. He just continues to try to do better and to respect Sherlock’s boundaries when he makes it clear he doesn’t want them crossed.
“May I please speak to John?” Sherlock asked politely on the other end as he walked out of the London Journal's headquarters.
“Mmm...hmm.” Sherlock couldn't help the expression that crossed his face then, one of complete disbelief, he was sure.
Irene and Lestrade make space for Sherlock and Molly to sit near them. Sherlock chooses a spot beside Greg so that Molly can sit with Irene. Lestrade is seated in a laid back pose, both arms resting on the back of the seat, one hand curled protectively towards Irene to continue the illusion of dating her.
I think it's rather obvious that Irene is Iris, though. I mean... Iris? Come on. Who didn't see that coming? lol Also If you follow me on tumblr, you already knew that Irene was Iris because I spoiled it for you. I posted that the whole idea behind this story was that John would see Sherlock dance a certain song with Irene and ... things would happen. So... my bad. AND also, not sure if anyone got this but, for her last name, here was my logic: Adler - Addler? - I know it's not a real word but I took it to be be like, one who "addles" aka 'confuses'. Then I was like confusion.. how do you say that in Russian? So I google translated the word "confusing" to Russian and it gave me this: "запутанным" with the English pronunciation as "Zaputannym" And that is where Irene's hilariously bad alias came from.
At that Sherlock explodes into another peel of laughter. “I’m not!” He swears, “I’m not crying, Eurus. I’m laughing. You made me laugh.”
John frowns and adjusts the squirming Rosie on his lap, “Of course,” he replies. He barely registers the eight that Darcey gives Sherlock and Irene for their performance as he concentrates on his girlfriend.
He met Molly by the elevator on the way in “...and there's been another serial suicide, did you hear? Absolutely dreadful business.” She prattled on.
“We could switch. Mary takes Irene's. You can drive mine, if you like. This way Mary can return it to Irene, after all she's a mutual friend, is she not? I can drop you off wherever you like, John. It's really no problem.” Sherlock had no idea why he was insisting but it seemed imperative that he do so, “Besides I've a few more questions I really wanted to ask you, for the article.”
Irene just kept talking “I can't believe it. I cannot believe it, there is no one out there that won't fall for her little charms, even a goody-two-shoes like Mary, she's become hypnotized by her voodoo and has lost her mind. You can't plan your sister's wedding to the woman you love, it's sick!”
Sherlock laughed and stopped his ministrations for a second to help John tear the shirt off of him and toss it to some far away corner, then undid his own trousers and tossed them somewhere over John's head when they were off. He pushed John back again, kissing him and rubbing them together, moaning all the way, all in swift movements. John would have been disappointed in not being allowed to appreciate Sherlock's nakedness with his eyes, but Sherlock was knew exactly where he wanted to be and was moving quickly to get just where he wanted. John found that he
“Hi,” The deep and melodious voice that could belong to none other than the annoyingly handsome William greeted, “How are you?” He asked, “Was that note a bit much?”
During that exact moment Sherlock was walking down the street during his lunch break along side both Molly and Greg, “He'll call me soon enough. You see, I happen to have quite the effect on both men and women.” He was telling them.
“Greg? Seriously? Huh… didn’t peg him for a Strictly fan, but guess I’ve been wrong before,” his girlfriend answers, continuing to knit, “I didn’t even realize Strictly was on yet…” she comments, “How many weeks have I missed?”
She’s all settled in and about to pop a buttery kernel into her mouth when she notices something on telly that has
Sherlock clapped, saying, “Yes! There we go, now we've got something to dance to!” as an upbeat mix of David Bowie's 'Let's Dance' started to play. John laughed along with a few others in the pub as Sherlock began to dance to the music gracelessly. A couple of minutes in two girls got up and joined him. The three of them began to sing along with the lyrics, laughing. Sherlock beckoned John to join them. He shook his head to decline and held up his glass as an excuse. Sherlock simply shrugged and continued to dance with the girls. They
“Hmm. Not as such. Dorian invited me and an old mutual friend of ours, Basil Hallward to see her perform on the night he was going to propose. We tried to watch her but she was so dreadful, with her droning words and pitchy singing that we couldn’t bear to stay past the first act. I believe it was the same night Dorian decided he no longer loved her. She was pretty, but not the least bit talented,” Henry shrugs, “I can’t say I’m sorry they never married, though if anyone was relieved that night it was Basil.”
It had taken him weeks to do it. Irene was just as wily as always. She had taken to sleeping in Sherlock’s bed with him, and she never seemed to have the phone when they were asleep, but always magically had it when they were awake. Sherlock had tried searching for it when she was sleeping many times, but whenever he returned to bed empty-handed she would be mysteriously awake with a smug look on her face. She never said a word, and neither did he, but they both knew he had been looking.
“Hello, Algernon,” Sherlock greets,”And no, this is my dearest friend, Doctor John Watson. John, this is Algernon Moncrieff – he’s an actor and another competitor,” Sherlock replies, more for the benefit of politeness than anything else. (He’s pretty sure John watches a very badly structured buddy-cop show starring Algernon.) Sherlock says, pointedly, “I’d really appreciate it if no one throws him to the wolves tonight — the man keeps me sane,” Sherlock explains.
The boy has apparently not given up though, “Nope!” He shouts as he takes Irene’s bag from Sherlock and hands (read: tosses) it to Henry. He pulls Sherlock with him to the dance floor in the direction Irene and the others are now gathered in. “No such thing as too much! Come, indulge me,” and it’s not like Sherlock has much of a choice. He allows himself to be dragged into the mass of writhing bodies and joins them. Before he realizes it, he’s grinning from ear to ear as he and Irene allow the stresses of the competition and their mystery to wash away.
Sherlock raised a brow and turned back to the closet, taking a step forward and his eyes dancing in glee, “Are those what I think they are?”
“The harpies, more like,” Algernon complains, “They’re vicious little beasts,” he continues, pulling down the collar of his shirt to show them a long angry-looking scratch on his collar, “Iris held me down with Vicky and Gwen, I’ll have you know,” he explains looking at Sherlock, and then turning to Dorian pouts, “Little Ceci almost clawed my eyes out.”
John smiled and continued to update her on the things she'd missed on her trip and had left John in charge of, “Mrs. Hudson's had her hip x-rayed, I just want to give you her updated progress sheet. Seems fine for now but you might want to have her come in again next month, since she's getting on in her years. You've got some returning patients, Mrs. Turner and her son, coming in for an appointment at eleven and Bart's called asking if you'll be attending the benefit. I left the number on your desk but if you'd like... Should I call them back and let them know you're attending?”
” he sent to Sherlock, hoping that the man is able to hear or feel his phone from in there. From the sounds of it, the club is extremely loud. John walks around the line-up that’s set up outside to get closer to the front entrance so that he can be ready to be let in.
before he finally replies, “No, Dorian, not at all. I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed. There are… a lot of people around,” and technically that’s not a lie.
Mary followed and stood next to him as he clicked around the screen, “John, I am so thankful that I could call you tonight... I can always count on you.” John looked back at Mary and nodded a smile. Mary continued, looking away with a slight blush on her face, “You never say no... which I love.” She looked back at John with her pinked cheeks just as he turned to her, a sudden realization filling his eyes.
John laughed nervously, “Don't know, but uh... changing the subject... we just got the new ads in, what do you think?”
“Don't be silly Mary, you must know the best help volunteering to clean up parks is given by petite vegetarian women in kitten heals.” In that instant John hated himself for how absolutely sexist that sounded coming out of his mouth. He needed to calm down.
“Right... you're terrified.” John said flatly, setting down the mugs on the coffee table and sitting next to Sherlock.
He heard Mary and Harry saying their thank you's to Mrs. Watson and sighed as he sat against the door, forcing himself not to shed a tear. He stayed there a moment longer, taking his phone out of his pocket to send a text message, (meet me @ Brook-Rich Pub in 20 mins) if only to distract himself from the agony he was feeling. It was like being shot all over again. The pain in his leg was almost as great as the pain in his heart. When he finally felt put together he exited the bathroom and made his excuses to leave.
“Sure, yeah,” John answered as a waiter came up to them and offered them some hors d'oeuvres, “Oh! Look!” John said, grabbing one in false excitement, “Pigs in a blanket! Want one Harry?” He asked, shoving it under John's nose.
The doctor tries to shake the grey cloud of depressing thoughts away. He can see the clinic up ahead and he doesn’t want to be distracted while he works, but the thoughts pass over the surface of his mind anyway.
Greg has been working on talking to a few of Henry’s music industry friends and a few people who went to Oxford with them, just to see what they can tell us about Henry’s character or about any observations in their relationships. Molly is working on talking to Henry himself. He hasn’t left her side all evening, and Sally is sort of floating around making sure Molly isn’t alone with him in case he tries something, but hopefully Molly can get something out of him.
John is finally broken out of his reverie as the hostess announces the upcoming dancers. John’s breath catches in his throat in anticipation.
“Oh, god yes I know, I mean, even being a vegetarian is a challenge. Every time I do volunteer work I have to struggle to cook myself something meatless before I leave for the day.”
John rolled his eyes, “I wouldn't have had so many nice invitations printed if we weren't going to use them.”
“John.” Sherlock says seriously, with a slight tremble in his voice, “I know you can be very self-depreciating but I’d hope that you see yourself as someone who is at least half-way decent.”
On the designated ‘battle-ground’ Dorian tries to make up for his clumsy attempts at being equally as sensual as Jack by making lewd faces and running his hands up and down his body to ‘
Okay, so still very similar to the movie script right now, please do not sue me. I'm literally wasting my life writing this because I love this romcom and johnlock more than anything when i should instead be doing something productive that actually makes me money.
“Shit!” John let go of Sherlock, but it was too late, the car was spinning out of control on the road and no matter which way John turned the wheel or how hard he slammed the breaks the car was
Sherlock turns, slicking now shampoo smothered hair back out of his face and tilts his head at John, “Oh, but Captain, you so do enjoy the sound of my voice.” He says in that low sex-oozing baritone of his.
At first he hears nothing, but when he places his daughter into the spacious portable crib Sherlock had long ago placed by the couch, he hears a light snoring coming from Sherlock’s bedroom. John panics for a moment, hoping Sherlock is alone in there. In his sudden panic he hears a voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like Sherlock scoff at him, “As ever Watson, you see but you do not observe. Look at the front entrance! There is only one pair of shoes by the coat hangers which incidentally are only holding on to one coat, and it is a familiar one. If I had company over of the romantic sort wouldn’t it be logical to assume they wouldn’t take their shoes and coat into the bedroom with me?”
Also: I've changed the setlist... AGAIN – I think I'll create a playlist on youtube or Spotify when I finish writing the fic with only the songs I'm using. I have a playlist right now but it's gotten messy with all the ones I wanted to add.
No, it doesn't because I had a few plot-holes and beginning notes that ended up going in a completely different direction. Also, um I completely forgot to mention Sherlock using protection earlier so that was... bad. Lol! Whoops! I didn’t mention it but i like to say he did because Sherlock isn’t that careless. The last guy before John though... :/ oops \_(‘-‘)_/ Sawwryy Sherlock. Um I’ll edit it later??? Forgive me, cinnamon roll~~! (in my defence you got to sleep with John and unnamed guy was nice and didn’t give you any diseases so you win in the end. And John loves you. ... don’t hate me. John probably hates me. He’s going to beat me up, I know it.)
is what I wanted to wri– John, I wrote that article because you interested me so much when I first met you, and yes, it wasn't kind, because I didn't know you any better then, and I wanted to believe that your beliefs were childish and stupid but I - I did
Harry lies some more, Sherlock is annoyed by Mycroft, John finds out a secret, Sherlock also finds out a secret, there's a rain storm and there's hilarity and shenanigans spread out across the chapter.
Sherlock and John suddenly ‘unfreeze’ and laugh happily with her, praising her for her good job. Rosie grins smugly and babbles proudly.
“Are you sure? I feel like I’m doing brilliantly,” Sherlock teases as he nods his head to the song and lifts his belly so that Rosie will be raised a little off the ground.
“Great!” John stopped paying him attention for a second and zipped open his clothes bag. He started removing his suit as quickly as he could get the wretched thing off.
“Mycroft... Sorry, Mister Holmes...” John started, “Look... I know that Sherlock is your brother, and that you love him. It's clear you do...” Mycroft was silent and made no move to get up, “I have a younger sister, as you know, from reading Sherlock's writing, and though she seems a tad over-bearing I know you understand how I feel about her, because it's the same way you feel about him so... So, trust me when I say that I know how you're feeling because if someone hurt my sister, I don't know what I'd do...” John whispered then as he kneeled in front of Mycroft, “But, I need you to trust me when I say this: I'm not here to hurt Sherlock Holmes. Quite the opposite, in fact. At least... I hope.”
“How many have you attended by the way – just make an estimate!” Sherlock shouted, the glee on his face very audible in his speech.
“Okay, um... Antoine, remember when I brought you the Sowersby's and they commissioned that six-tiered Diamond shaped masterpiece? And,
“Quite dapper, John, do you feel dapper?” Sherlock asked as John came out in a forest green plaid suit.
“Sherlock, I've been waiting my whole life for the right person to come along...” He started, “and then you came into my life... and... you're nothing like what I imagined...” John drew little unconscious patterns in Sherlock's hand as he spoke with a fond smile, “You're cynical, and cranky, and... impossible, but meeting you is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I think there's a very good chance that I've... well, that I've fallen in love with you.” John blushed as he finished, looking at Sherlock but not quite being able to meet his eye.
People walked this way and that, dragging around luggage and embracing loved ones in the crowded waiting areas. John paid them no mind as he stood in cleared off space and waited anxiously for his little sister to appear. The plane was about an hour behind schedule and John's leg was beginning to ache a little. The doors opposite John opened for what seemed like the thousandth time today when John finally spotted a familiar head of long blonde curls. Harry's smiling form appeared from the crowd. She was bouncing up and down on her toes as she made her way towards John. Her smile was as bright and radiant as always.
Harry ignored John and turned to Mary, “I can see how you'd believe that, but let me tell you...” She began as she dragged Mary off while John took his sandwich, rolling his eyes. “I actually really enjoy all that helpful lark, you know, feeding the homeless, saving children and building ...new... things. But, to tell you the truth I haven't done much volunteer work since... well since my dog died. John and I had this dog growing up, Humphrey, and I just, I loved him. We would just go out to the animal shelter to do volunteer work and bring him along to play with the other dogs and we went on all sorts of rescue adventures... not a day goes by that I don't miss that bag of fleas” She finished mumbling the last bit and avoiding eye contact with John as they sat in plastic chairs in front of the stage, “... good old Humphrey.”
, “Now, as I said, everything is going to be fine, there's no need to be alarmed, I'm just going to have a look upstairs. I must also, however, going to let you all know that my partner and I will be making some rounds around the pub and would appreciate it if everyone stayed until you've all been questioned. You are not legally being held here, of course so you may leave if you wish, but if any of you have any information on Ms. Wilson I'd really appreciate you staying for just a bit, and in exchange I promise to answer any concerns you might have.” Sherlock gave them all a charming smile.
“Um… bye?” he answers, looking up at the stairs. “Guess uncle Sherlock had a visitor?” John whispers to Rosie as the door clicks shut behind him leaving John and Rosie alone at the foot of the steps.
“That's ridiculous, John, why would I be terrified?” Sherlock turned his body toward John, but his eyes wouldn't meet his face.
John carried three cups of coffee and some breakfast in a paper bag as he walked into the clinic that morning. Just behind him a car screeched to a halt and honked as the driver squeezed herself into a parallel parking spot just outside the building.
time I called they said they had a cancellation. Apparently the groom slept with the bride's mother, and sister and all these people so obviously they put a stop to it and they were all devastated but it means... we're getting married in three weeks!” Harry squealed and hugged John.
“Well alright then… you think your new boyfriend might have been dating this Basil guy and this Henry guy could have killed him and Dorian’s Servant. How does this help Irene?” John asks.
“The story got a phenomenal response, and the police were actually impressed with your help catching the prisoner. It looks like you get your wish after all. You may move on to investigative journalism, if you so desire.”
They finally get downstairs and Sherlock links an arm around John’s own, leading him to the bar. Once they get there Sherlock lets go of John squeezes through. John, never one to allow Sherlock to leave him behind, squeezes in with him. He watches the detective and admires his immediate change in attitude as he leans flirtatiously over the counter in order to get his drink faster. John marvels at how easily Sherlock has always been able to do that – to charm people into getting his way. As John looks out into the crowd of dancing human beings he realizes why Dorian is probably so charmed with the false Sherlock he’s met – why the audience keeps voting for him and Irene to remain on the show week after week. Sure, partially it’s because he’s very talented (and beautiful) (and because
“No, it's just... I didn't realize you wanted that, but if it is... it's fine. I just want you to be happy, Harry, you know that.”
Lestrade laughs while Sherlock sighs, fixing his own curls in the mirror mutters, “She’s not wrong,” then turning around asks, “Alright, is everyone ready?”
John takes a cab to the clinic. Now that he’s no longer worried about Rosie, however, he finds his mind wandering to his best friend. He’d said he needed help putting up some shelves? It‘s odd, thinking about Sherlock doing something as mundane as re-decorating, but he supposes Sherlock does have his own tastes. After all, Sherlock was the one who had brought in all of their weird mis-matched furniture, curtains and other Knick-knacks to the flat in the first place. Still it was odd of him to invite the man when he was merely thinking about redecorating. Maybe he works in interior design? John can’t picture Sherlock hiring someone to redesign the space but John decides to shrug it off. Who could ever claim to know what goes on in Sherlock’s head anyway? (Well, besides Mrs. Hudson.) Probably he just needs to make more space for his ever-expanding collection of science equipment. He smiles inwardly, thinking about the fact that the collection has recently expanded to include children’s chemistry sets as well. Sherlock’s enthusiasm for teaching Rosie is heartwarming. John never thought he’d get so attached to her, especially since they were so distant from each other in her early years of life, for a variety of reasons.
“Don’t, Irene. I know it’s… but I —Can’t. I’ve tried, I just. I can’t alright?” Sherlock sighs, suddenly very sleepy. “Let’s just go home.”
The nurse looked at John, about to ask him to leave, but John made a b-line towards Mycroft and was at his side in one swift movement.
John stood there for a second letting them walk away. He doubted they'd notice his absence anyway. Just then he felt someone tap his shoulder twice. He turned in surprise as he heard who it was before he saw them,
“Pink.” John said, suddenly. He didn't know why he said it aloud. It just sort of slipped from his lips as he stared at her with a solemn expression. This had not been what he'd been expecting to do tonight. He thought for sure he'd have been home right now fuming at Sherlock's stupidity over their previous fight if it weren't for their accident. Life threw some strange curveballs at you.
Sherlock stared, this was suspiciously easy. Mycroft raised a brow, “Back to work, then Sherlock,” He said, ushering him out.
Sherlock fumbles with John’s trousers and John allows him to until Sherlock has snaked his hand in and grasped onto John’s hard aching cock.
“Welcome back, Doctor Watson,” Irene smirks, waving him and Rosie in and closing the door behind him, “Sherlock’s just upstairs getting dolled up. He’ll be down in a moment.”
,” he twists a finger in his shirt and looks at his phone nervously, “Should I really end the conversation now?”
“There's no such thing as chance, John. It was a nice deduction, on your part, even if it was an unconscious one. Shot in the dark, perhaps, good one, though. For someone who has little insight into himself, you managed to –what's that saying?– 'hit the nail on the head'?”
“Oh, God, are you teaching her to deduce her toys?” John’s voice says in amusement through the door.
, Sherlock?” He spat his name like a curse, “Do you want another picture, for your paper?” He fumed.
” and then the music in the background suddenly becomes quick, and Sherlock strikes his body into action, turning and beginning a stepping sequence towards his partner who materializes in a golden fringed dress from behind a shower of beads of the same color, dancing towards him. They reach each other’s hands and begin to swivel back towards the center of the stage where they separate again as they dance to the quick rhythm. “
“Right. That's right, I understand.” John said, then stuffed the whole thing in his mouth gracelessly while looking between the two of them and chewing.
Mary giggled her agreement, “Yes especially when you've got a party to attend and have absolutely nothing to wear.”
Jim's wedding: John wears a bowler hat, a fake moustache, pale make-up, a purple cravat and vest with a black shirt, studded bracelets, an earing and eyeliner – lots of eye-liner. He's actually feeling happy today, seeing the look of pure joy on Sebastian's face as Jim enters. John gives Harry the sign of horns, in an attempt to be funny by sticking out his tongue and smiling. Mary returns the gesture. Harry ruins it by taking Mary's hand, extending the thumb and whispering, “Did you know that in sign language, this means I love you?” causing Mary to whisper the words “I love you too Harry,” back to her before kissing Harry softly. John's face falls and he looks over at Irene over by the side of the isle hopelessly. Irene frowns, follows John's previous eye line and gasps with a disgusted look on her face.
“Sort of. My wife is one of the competitors, as is my sister, but neither have gone on yet - this boy is also a dear friend, though, so naturally I can’t get out of coming,” he winks charmingly and adds, “And yourself?”
Mozart found his calling at age five, composing his first minuet. Picasso discovered his talent for painting when he was nine. Tiger woods won his first club well before his second birthday. John... John was eight when he discovered his purpose in life. He was at St. Mary's Church, on the grounds of Goldsborough hall, in the heart of Yorkshire England; it was his cousin Leonard’s, wedding. It was their first big event since his father died and his mum was not in great shape. John, his little sister Harriet, and his mother sat at a pew while the church filled up, waiting for the bride and groom to arrive.
life that is insane. What do you do other than work at that clinic and help people marry one another?”
“We’re alright,” Sherlock answers, “Iris and I are a little disappointed, obviously but, not in the results, just at ourselves. We’ll definitely make it a point to work harder this week, and perhaps, as Bruno suggested we might try to tear ourselves away from my little theme.”
Sherlock had shielded his head with his hands at her attack until he’d managed to literally pull the rug out from under her, making her topple backward, but not before the big man caught her just before she hit the floor. He’d looked like he was about to attack Sherlock until Irene held him back, “No, no, darling, it’s alright. Miss Adler is finished with this little worm.” She had left the flat then and had locked herself in a suite in Soho, where Sherlock found her hours later after he’d recovered from her beating.
Not beta'd. Not edited. Again. Just get used to the cringe-worthy grammar, spelling and fucked-up tenses. :S
“Ah, yes, of course.” Sherlock answers as his partner begins to move behind him again, a sly grin on his face. Sherlock glances at him over his shoulder, slightly annoyed, but not all together displeased. His partner continues as Sherlock hears John continue, completely oblivious to Sherlock’s situation without the ability to see him – “Yeah. Anyway, listen, I was wondering – Ouch! – Hold on,” Sherlock hears John rustling about and tries to concentrate on listening for his return while suppressing a groan at his partner’s deliberate movements behind him. “Rosie,” Sherlock hears John say, “sweetie, don’t pull daddy’s hair.” Sherlock shudders at the combined pleasure of hearing John’s voice, even if it isn’t speaking to him directly, while Sherlock is currently being fucked from behind. “Thank you, darling,” John says to Rosie on his end, then his voice returns, much clearer this time, “Sorry. She’s a little cranky. We’ve had a bit of a rough morning.”
And so it was that John found himself back out in the rain while Sherlock held an umbrella borrowed from Mrs. Laurinston, walking towards a dead fucking body. They were a few paces away when Sherlock gasped.
Tapping her finger on the couch as she waits for Sherlock and Iris’ turn to dance, she looks in the direction of her bedroom. She’s babysitting for John again and doesn’t want to turn up the volume too much, lest she wake the sleeping baby and miss Sherlock’s performance, but she’s so excited to hear their song choice. Maybe just one bar will be enough? She nearly squeals as the screen switches to a clip of Sherlock in 221B - and Molly is surprised again that he’s allowed the cameras in there. Last week, as he and Iris got acquainted Sherlock had brought her to his home and had revealed his ‘murder’ board for a small case about a missing dog, which they solved together for the benefit of the public. Molly had been shocked to see him so co-operative and patient with Iris, but the reason why was quite evident as she had proved herself to be quite clever, helping him solve the case quite quickly. If there was something that Sherlock appreciates in another person it was their intelligence. The smile they had shared when the final pieces of the puzzle were in place had been the only genuine one Molly had seen on Sherlock while he participated on this show. Well, apart from the grin he’d had when he’d danced with her. Indeed, his relationship with Iris looked to be the only true part of himself that he was presenting on the show. Molly supposed that was a good thing, since dancing was really quite an intimate activity, involving trust and care of one’s partner. The two of them almost seem like old friends whenever they’re shown together. She’s a little jealous but mostly she’s happy for Sherlock and proud of his behavior so far.
John gives Sherlock a tender smile. It’s really sweet of him to want to spend time with Rosie and he suddenly feels awful for keeping them apart for so long. Clearly they miss each other. “Yes, I think that sounds great,” he says, and they begin preparing to leave. Before they go, Tony returns to them with a small bag which is apparently carrying a box filled with Italian desserts.
“Wait!” Sherlock suddenly pleas, placing a hand on his arm - because much as he wants this, the thought has just occurred to him. He refuses to ever sleep on this couch again. “Wait,” he explains more calmly, “let’s... perhaps the bed would serve better...?”
“No, no, it's good. Da would have wanted this, I'm sure he'd have loved to see you in it.” John's mouth was working on autopilot at this point as he tried very very hard not to fall apart.
Sherlock, as if sensing that someone is thinking about him, shifts in his sleep and snakes an arm around John’s chest. He somehow pulls himself closer, his head now partially on John’s chest. John shifts a little at the movement, until he can move the previously crushed arm to stretch his tingling fingers.
Harry stared after him, a look of slight concern on her face as he walked away. John did not look happy.
Sherlock feels a lump in his throat at John’s kind words. There are too many emotions running rampant inside him right now. The pain of memories loss, the shock of victor’s loss still fresh within him because he never allowed himself to suffer for it before. The heartbreak at Eurus’ betrayal and mental health - her torture of himself and of his friend’s haunting him til now. But worst of all is the longing he has for the love of John Watson. He turns away from the doctor, looking resolutely at the screen instead of answering him. He can’t talk about it right now. He’d break down. He knows he would, and today had been such a lovely day after he’d come home from Eurus. Waking up to John and little Rosie was like a dream. And John had even made him breakfast in bed! Sherlock didn’t want today to end, ever.
“It’s not a date,” Sherlock replies softly, sounding a little defeated, “he’s living with someone- a woman. He would never… besides, he’s still vehemently in denial about the possibility of being bisexual. And… I’m just happy to see him, that’s all. And I like Rosie. I don’t mind her coming with us,” he ends a little lamely.
He opens up his laptop and plugs in some head phones, then lies on the couch with the machine balanced on his legs while his upper body is propped up with two couch cushions by the arm rest. He taps Sherlock’s name with the words “hit dance competition” into the search query and is immediately bombarded with gossip articles and links to videos.
“It's just... now that I've...” Sherlock struggled to find words when he finally settled on, “gotten to know John, I realize that what I initially deduced might have been partially... well not incorrect but rather... there's more to the story than I originally anticipated.”
“Heh, yeah.” John turned back towards his office as Mary closed the door to hers. Irene followed him in, “Oh. My. God. John Watson, you poor soul,” She commented.
Archie glared at John, a look of betrayal starting to form in his face when Mary insisted, “No, come on John we've more than enough doctors in today and your boss is a bitch anyway. Do say yes.”
Sherlock raises a brow at her, “If you think I’m falling for that, Watson, you have another thing coming,”
The audience cheer again and Tess laughs saying, with a sweep of her arm, “Oh, I’m sure he’ll find out soon enough. And speaking of finding things out, Mr. Holmes, can you deduce who we might have paired you with for the competition?”
Eventually, Tony returns to their table, somehow managing to carry all three plates of food with him; John’s plate and Rosie’s are balanced along the length of one arm and Sherlock’s in the other. Because of this, Sherlock is served first, then Rosie, and finally John.
“They’re very good,” John comments to Jack as Algernon and Gladys really start getting into their moves.
“‘Too much sentimental twaddle.’ I believe were his exact words.” Sherlock smiles and speaks quietly, “I think Eurus would have hated it too, but back when we sat together with mummi to watch it she was much too young to understand it, or perhaps just too young to feel she could protest.”
“Look, when you brought me to the clinic after Afghanistan I was grateful, and I was blown away by you, and your abilities. I got so caught up in it, in order to distract myself from the pain I was feeling, that I never actually bothered to get past them and get on with my own life. And then I guess I was too comfortable to leave which is when, of course, I realized I had to be there every day to see you because I was so madly in love with you.” John closed his eyes, laughing a little at his final admission.
John is about to open his mouth to reply in anger when Sherlock interrupts him once more. “This isn’t for a case, idiot.” And before John can interrupt him with an irritated “then what is it then?”, he continues, “What I’m trying to explain is that this is the first time I’ve ever been with this man.”
In my defence I did not remember all this sadness was in the movie before I started writing this shit. I should add angst as a tag. with happy ending though.
“So sad...” Mrs. Laurinston remarked, “Such a young girl,” As Sherlock and John made to get up from their seats.
John made his way back over to William with his face still slightly flushed. William was beaming so brightly John had the urge to knock his stupid fucking teeth out of that ridiculously pretty face right then and there. Instead, he grabbed his drink from William's hand and knocked it back.
John, I know it's why you did everything you did. It's why you became a doctor and why you joined the army and that's noble and all that but look... look what it's done to you... I know that I might seem selfish and entitled and, and, and...
Sherlock stood and grabbed his things as fast as he could. He had to make it to where John and Mary were before they finished. He
“Oh... well she...” John searched for something... anything he could say against Mary and could find nothing really horrible about her, “She um... enjoys going to the gun range, which I think is a little odd, and she's got suspiciously good aim for a civilian and that honestly scares me a bit.”
But John has raised himself on an arm to listen, staring at his face as he talks and the more Sherlock speaks, the more John understands. He’s always assumed and acted like Sherlock was off on some grand romantic adventure while he was away, but John has never actually thought about the reality of it. Sherlock has endured so much more than what he lets on. These are scars from obvious torture. If John has to guess, he’d say Sherlock was flogged, and from the way the skin is still raised in its scarring, John has to assume that he was unable to take care of his injuries properly. The thought of Sherlock, frightened, angry and alone, enduring this kind of thing brings tears to John’s eyes. The thought of any other sort of pain he might have endured while he was out there, alone with no back-up, breaks John’s heart and he thinks, not for the first time tonight, that he has been such a
John looked up at the ceiling, “Ugh... Oh god...” He sighed, “Mary, I quit,” He said, “Yep... I quit.” He started walking around Mary towards the door,
As far as John knows, Sherlock doesn’t have that many friends, and the pool of straight men that John
The first judge, Bruno, rises from his seat and looks over at ‘Craig’ in understanding – “Oh, yes! I caught that too!” He exclaims.
The four of them have just exited a shiny black car Mycroft had graciously provided them at Greg’s request. Sherlock and Molly walk on ahead, arms linked together while Irene and Greg follow, mirroring them.
And then John smirks, remembering Sherlock’s earlier confession, “You said you couldn’t tell with me...” he begins, moving up to grin at Sherlock...
“Good, I’m glad! I’m sure we’re all glad to hear it, in fact. We’re definitely all excited to have you! I know I’m a huge fan of your blog, anyway!”
Sherlock doesn’t see John’s text message. He doesn’t see it because Irene, the little tramp that she is, has stolen his phone. She doesn’t do it with malice, nor does she do it to keep him away from John. She does it because Sherlock had stolen her phone first. He’d stolen it because Irene had not been particularly forward about the case they are investigating and Sherlock had had his suspicions, because of course he did.
Sherlock flops back on the couch and for a long time he says nothing, an arm thrown haphazardly over his eyes, repeating the motion from earlier in the day. There’s a slight grimace on his face, as if the conversation pains him when he finally admits, “I did.”
Iris doesn’t let go of Molly’s hand as she walks over to Sherlock, dragging Molly with her, “Anything interesting?” She asks.
Molly attempts to hide her smile at his retort. She’s figured out by now that Henry is the type of person who always has to have the last word so she doesn’t address the question. Instead, she nods her head at the people below, “You really know all these people?” She asks him the question with the knowledge that it’s unlikely he’ll answer it. So far, Henry has rarely answered any of her questions — choosing instead to turn every opportunity to talk in some great philosophical epithet. She asks him more to try and stir up the conversation, and because, occasionally it either throws him off or seems to annoy him. Yet with every jab she makes at him, the more he seems to want to stay around her. He’s probably a masochist. If he is, Irene would probably be proud of her.
marriage, but also her own. You'd seen the ring on her finger when you'd picked her up. She was dressed all in pink, like on her wedding day, when she lied to your sister's face and told her she was wrong... but you knew your sister wasn't. Everyone in town knew. They weren't exactly subtle, Jennifer and Carter. But you killed Jennifer, not because you didn't hate Carter for hurting your sister, but because you knew that even if you killed Jennifer here, it'd be more difficult to suspect you. You've only killed in London so far, so you knew that if the police thought this was a suicide much like the London ones they still wouldn't link this death to you, because after Jennifer you planned to go back to killing in London and she would be an outlier in your only established pattern. The police would see this incident with Jennifer as not only a set-up but an inside job as no one other than the police and the killer could know the details of the case so well. Your brother in law would be implicated for Jennifer's murder because of his affair with Jennifer and after her death you'd get them both away from hurting your sister ever again.
—” and John notices how for some parts Sherlock seems to mouth along or hum as he shuffles around with little Rosie.
Sherlock seems to be in the same situation as he stares at John for a good few seconds before his eyes break away and he says, “ehm... can we... er. I’d like to um... explain? Possibly?”
“Shut-up,” Sherlock admonishes, donning his coat and tossing Lestrade’s leather jacket at him. He looks to Lestrade and asks, for the fifth time that evening, “Are you sure you don’t want to borrow something—?”
Sherlock and John finally blink themselves to awareness as both look to each other in shock, gasping, “The baby!” They scramble out of bed and each man takes one of Sherlock’s robes, wrapping it firmly around themselves and rushing up the stairs to investigate the screeching toddler.
John’s face is glowing with warmth at his response. At last he stands and opens up his arms for Rosie, “Come here, sweetheart, let’s give Sherlock some time to get up out of bed.”
“Pleasure's all mine, Mr. Holmes, I'm so sorry, it's the hospital, I've got to take this,” Mary apologized and opened up her mobile, “Sorry, Hi, yes, what's going on?”
John let her, and kissed her in return. This is what he'd been waiting for all this time... this was what he'd wanted all these years... but... somehow, even as her lips brushed against his he felt nothing. It felt odd... and wrong... somehow.
She brought them in to a large lavish looking office behind two double doors. She went round the desk and picked up a mobile phone.
John scowls, “Well yes, but also… why to everything?” He asks, “Why’s she here? Since when does she know Molly? Why Strictly come dancing? Why does my daughter know her name? Is she staying with you? Are you two—?”
“Huddews!” Rosie exclaims as Mrs. Hudson lets herself in, carrying Sherlock’s customary morning tea.
“You did good, dear Doctor,” Algernon proclaims, “But! As promised, drinks are on me – let’s go crash Harry’s party,” Algernon points to a private elevator which will lead them up faster.
Sherlock merely hmmm'ed and began rubbing John's groin through his trousers with his hand as the other worked awkwardly to remove the zip.
Unlike Rosie, Molly isn’t quite sleepy yet, so she sits down on the couch and turns on the telly, the baby monitor sitting just within reach while Rosie snores the night away softly in a portable crib in Molly’s bedroom. Molly flips through the channels with a bored sigh, resting her hand on her chin until she finally settles on what looks like the familiar flashy stage of Strictly Come Dancing. Molly pouts, the show is one of her guilty pleasures. She’d forgotten all about it this year and hasn’t kept up with who this year’s celebrity dancers will be. She’s a little disappointed at that but decides she may as well carry on. It looks like this is only the middle of the first episode, so she’s probably not missed much.
. Sherlock Holmes is a fucking revelation. He has never had anyone give him a blow job like this. It’s as if Sherlock knows
“Oh speaking of work, I'm meeting up with some people from the clinic tonight for a party. You want to come?” John asked as he poured the now-ready tea into two cups.
Sherlock gives her a pleased little smile and offers, “Ah yes, thank you, that’s all thanks to the efforts of a friend.”
Doctor John Hamish Watson, formerly Captain of the fifth Northumberland Fussiliers." Sherlock quips.
“What? Do you think I’m falling for it?” John asks, sharing an amused look with Sherlock, “I’ve been here the whole time, young lady, you aren’t fooling anyone.”
Irene taps on John’s name now and brings up his texts. She frowns a little when she sees that it was Sherlock who had texted first. “Have some self-respect,” she mutters to herself as she reads on. By the time she gets to the end, however, she’s feeling a little smug. Sherlock hadn’t once seemed to be blushing this morning, which means that he had handled that innuendo with a very good poker face. She’s so proud of him.
in distasteful encounters,” and he giggles and hides behind Sherlock when Algernon tries to hit him.
And so the three of them get changed (Rosie with some help from John and from the copious drawers of adorable little outfits Sherlock has purchased for her), and make their way to the restaurant where they spend a happy calm evening eating until they’re stuffed. When John and Rosie finally go home, it’s dark out and Sherlock is filled with so much warmth after seeing them that as soon as he arrives in 221B he crawls straight to bed and falls right asleep with a smile on his features. Today was a good day and now he knows exactly what song to write for Eurus next.
John tries to interrupt but Rosie squirms out of his arms to go sit closer to the screen which brings his attention back to the show for a couple of seconds as he catches Bruno speaking on screen, saying,
Sherlock sniffs, clearly annoyed at Lestrade’s rebellion then extends his arm towards Molly. “Shall we?”
The very last song they dance to is actually part of Sherlock's set for next chapter. It's not a huge spoiler since I already used it. Anyway, the song is called "Besame Mucho," It's in Spanish and the version they dance to is, I believe, the original by Cesaria Evora. I also recommend you look it up on youtube. It's really nice.
A low melodious laugh reaches them, even above the blaringly loud music, and a deep voice from somewhere behind Sherlock says, “Don’t listen to the big bad man, Dorian, I will do no such thing. You go on and enjoy the pleasures of life while you’re still young.”
“I-Ree is coming to dance?” Rosie asks and John recalls that Sherlock never answered shy Rosie knows her name. He scowls just as he sees Sherlock wince at Rosie’s question.
John sits at home in front of the telly with Rosie in his arms. His girlfriend walks in to join him after emerging from the bedroom carrying a basket full of yarn and some knitting needles. She settles down beside John. John doesn’t really acknowledge her presence as he shifts Rosie to his other knee so she won’t attempt to grab at the needles. He needn’t worry, since Rosie is distracted by the dancers on the screen and is watching them, mesmerized by their movements. John, for his part, also ignores the dancers while his mind wanders. Sherlock hasn’t texted him back and it has been a full week since he’d sent the message. John had since then texted Molly to see if she knew anything about Sherlock, and Molly had since responded with a simple text that just read, “He’s fine, John :)” And just what the hell was he supposed to do with that? He’s decided, however, that he isn’t going to send a follow-up text. Instead, John has decided, he’s going to watch the performance of this week instead. He’s actually started anticipating it as he’s seen a few online links to rehearsals on a recent social media page that Sherlock has appeared to have opened. John suspects it’s the show producers who have gotten him to do it as there aren’t many details posted on it. The page has a total of four photographs. One is of Sherlock and Irene or “Iris” as she’s calling herself, in silhouette, dancing. The second photograph is of Sherlock with a bunch of other people that are on the show, apparently at some kind of after-party. The third is a photograph of Sherlock, at home, reading a book about bee migration, and the last is a photograph that was posted early this morning. It’s a picture of a pinstriped red shirt, black suspenders, and shoes with a caption that reads, simply, “I heard…”
Sherlock had smiled tiredly, “Of course, John,” he’d said in goodbye, and to Rosie, “I’ll see you both soon. I promise.”
John smirks, “You know I think it does,” he agrees, putting on a false thoughtful look to mess with Sherlock, even if he had thought the same thing about Dorian only moments ago.
John doesn’t respond. He keeps his eyes glued to the screen, watching the dance unfold. He’d wondered if Sherlock would continue with his so-called “Heartbreak Theme,” this week. It appears as if things with Irene aren’t going as well as Sherlock might hope if this week’s song choice is any indication. Still, they seem to be very in-sync in their dance. Sherlock expertly lifts and spins Irene, both kicking their legs in the iconic rock-and-roll style movements while the singer continues in his deep country tones to sing his cover of this song. “
“Hmm. These.” He points to one of the pairs of shoes. Irene mutters a ‘thank you’ but before she goes Sherlock bursts out — “Wait, what happened to the necklace?”
“What?” John asked, his head popping back up and looking at William as if the concept of saying no to his sister was the most ludicrous thing he'd ever heard.
Suddenly he looked up and noticed the silence in the alley as well as a bunch of smokers staring at him. John blinked and felt himself flush in embarrassment.
, the insolent little shit. John would definitely make him pay for that one, as soon as this stopped feeling so good.
“Ugh!” She screamed as she accidentally knocked over an empty plastic vase, “What?!” She yelled into the phone.
Iris and Sherlock’s grins broaden impossibly more ecstatic. Clearly this is the guy to impress. “Bruno was right, what can we say? It was a beauty to watch. Sherlock, you have surprised us from the beginning. When you first came on stage, I admit I thought you would be an awkward gangly mess, but each and every week you have proved me wrong. Brilliant job. Fabulous. I do, however, have to comment on one thing –”
“Ugh... fine.” And so John took Sherlock's hand as another song (Elton John's Benny and the Jets) came on, joined him on the dance floor and sang along with the rest of the pub. Sherlock was stolen by one of the young ladies from earlier almost immediately after returning to it and Sherlock laughed as John watched her drag him away. John continued dancing as per Sherlock's instructions and soon found partners of his own as they all danced song after song. It had gotten quite lively in here.
“Okay, yeah that’s weird. Wait – why was Francis at Dorian’s home if he’s Henry’s butler? Also do we know why Basil was looking for Dorian at that hour? I mean, if it’s so important, why wouldn’t he just phone him?” John asks.
Sherlock felt his eyelids flicker and a bright light flashed heavily above him. He shut his eyes instinctively and tried again. As his eyes opened again, slowly this time, the room he was in came in to view and all the sounds around him suddenly rushed into his ears. He heard the stable beep-beep-beeping of his heart beat monitored on a machine, and saw that he was in a white hospital room with a woman (presumably a nurse), his brother Mycroft looking particularly disheveled, and John Watson looking particularly beautiful even with the look of nervous worry in his eyes.
As Sherlock shakes his hand does he notices something odd about the man. He can’t quite place what it is, but the dark eyes seem to pierce into his soul. As the man’s cool fingers slip away Sherlock feels an involuntary shiver run down his spine. Sherlock gives the man one of his patented cursory glances and the deductions fly at him from every direction. Mid-forties, wealthy, a sensualist, an intellectual and somewhat flighty if his marriage to the young singer Dorian is currently doing shots with is any indication. The man wears a smile as Sherlock looks him over and his eyes don’t back down at Sherlock’s gaze as most people do. He appears oddly confident and almost comfortable with the scrutiny. Sherlock’s own eyes suddenly roam the club nervously, looking for Irene.
he’d said in response to John’s query about girlfriends, yet he and Irene somehow had an odd relationship that John wouldn’t categorize as lacking in sexual tension. Still, Sherlock never denied being gay whenever it was implied… John didn’t know what to think. Add to all that the picture of Sherlock with the young blond boy with his hand stuck in his shirt and laughing and John’s mind found itself in complete disarray.
For some reason, even though Rosie appears to be falling asleep, Sherlock doesn’t let go of John’s hand, and so John doesn’t let go of his. Sherlock keeps them swaying at a slower rhythm, this time moving gently from side to side, presumably to continue rocking the child to sleep. It seems to be working as her hand slips out of John’s and curls up to hold onto the front of Sherlock’s shirt. Her head is nestled between Sherlock’s head and chest and her breaths begin to become more even as she starts to fall asleep. John slips his hand onto her back and continues to sway along with Sherlock, the only noise in the room now coming from the steady voice of the singer and the soft instruments along with a slight creaking of the floor as they move.
John carefully picks himself up, along with Sherlock’s help, though his knees are still aching. “Alright, I’m coming, I’m coming.”
Craig chimes in next, “yes, I agree, you were off tempo for a few moments, and I love that you did keep to your theme even with the type of dance you had to perform this week. I must say that emotionally, I felt you were a bit more connected last week, though.”
John gives Jack a look as he steps into Sherlock’s space right as Dorian leaves. As he looks up to face Sherlock, however, John freezes, panicking a little. Sherlock, for his part, gives John a little smirk of his own, but unlike Dorian’s, his isn’t malicious. Sherlock sways slowly and begins the dance by lifting his arms, stepping rhythmically from side to side as he snaps to the music. John takes a deliberate breath and takes his lead. He doesn’t copy Sherlock’s movements exactly but he closes his eyes as Algernon had suggested and bobs his head to the beat of the song, allowing himself to sway from side to side. When he finally feels like he’s got a good rhythm he opens his eyes to peek at Sherlock. And he immediately regrets it. Sherlock has now decided to pull similar moves to Dorian, moving his hips sensually and flipping his dark curls to emphasize the long lithe lines of his neck as he twists and turns. He adds in some fancy footwork to sort of change it up a bit. John feels the heat rushing back to his face.
“Hullo?” John answered it, “Oh! Hi! Yes... not a problem. I'll be right over. Okay, bye.” John smiled as he closed the door of the closet with a sigh of relief then calmly walked over to his room to get dressed.
John is just putting Rosie to bed when he gets a text from Greg. It’s a link to a video and the caption beneath it just says “You seen this yet? Apparently, he’s on again tonight.” John’s face pales a little. He knows what the video link is… and he’s been avoiding searching for any of these for weeks, but now that Greg has sent the link... God John can barely resist. He sits on the hotel bed and looks to the door. His girlfriend has just gone out to drink with a couple of their colleagues. Likely she’ll be back in a few hours. Dammit.
“Yes. I need you alert. You were in the army, I'm assuming you work well under this sort of pressure.”
I really want to draw the outfits the most (i'm kind of a huge fan of fashion illustration) but I also really like designing wedding invitations and flower arrangements so I might make and draw a few of those as well... We'll see how my RL work schedule goes...
“God, FUCKING dammit! Why?! Why? FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUUUUCK!” John yelled as he punched at the wall to his left.
Anyway my loyal sweet audience who likes to read my trash, thank you for your continued support, you’ve encouraged me to keep writing this (and I’ll probably finish it before In Pursuit - oops.) I didn’t think I’d like this fic this much since I abandoned it years ago and only recently decided to post the first chapter and finish it,  but once I started writing i found I couldn’t stop. I guess, like you, I just want to fix the way season 4 ended, even if it’s just by doing my own unlikely extension to it.
John pauses a moment while he passes by his bedroom door, wondering if he should try to address the fight with his girlfriend or just let her fall asleep. He finds he doesn’t really want to, especially since he feels the argument is a little unfair. He hasn’t seen Sherlock in months, especially since Mrs. Hudson went on a trip to her sister’s and John has only brought Rosie to Molly when he needs a sitter. He’s his best friend. It’s only natural to miss him, isn’t it? As for defending him, well, again, best friend - they’ve been through a lot together. He feels he’s entitled to care for Sherlock.  Aside from that, Sherlock hasn’t called him on a case for a while. Possibly since around the time John and his girlfriend had moved in together, so it’s not like John has been paying very much attention to him at all either. In fact, John would argue that once he and his new lover moved in together his life with Sherlock came to a bit of a standstill. John scratches the back of his neck and resigns himself to going to bed late. He’ll have to wait until his girlfriend is asleep. If she’s so upset by the subject, he’d really rather not bring it up again tonight, especially since seeing Sherlock and Irene on that dance show always seems to leave him with a heavy pit in his stomach. The two had looked happy dancing together this week – a contrast to last week’s performance, in which Irene had seemed very happy, but Sherlock had seemed very emotional. Then there was the fact that it had been a week and Sherlock hadn’t replied to John’s text. John had been worried that the man was upset with him, but perhaps he was just busy.
“Enjoy the party,” John spat and pushed past her towards Irene, where, incidentally he was keeping a bag with his laptop in it.
Sherlock scowls at John and opens his mouth to argue about the boyfriend bit, but Greg interrupts, hoping to avoid a crisis from either of them – “We’re not sure exactly, but if Irene’s blackmailer is looking for Basil, maybe one of his friends can identify him? Or maybe it’s one of his friends that is looking for him? Either way if we can find someone that cares about the missing painter, then maybe we can find who the blackmailer is.”
Sherlock’s nervous laughter would be funny right now, if John weren’t so mad at him. “Ah. Well, I supposed even
Guys this whole chapter is mostly sex. It’s... That’s it. It’s smut. That’s - yeah. So... uh smut. I think it's a good place to end it, right?
John had moved into Sherlock's cozy flat at 221B baker street about five months ago. Since he'd quit his job with Mary at the clinic, he had begun his own wedding planning service. It was going quite brilliantly, actually. Sherlock had gone back to work for Mycroft, but this time as an investigative journalist. John of course, lived a precarious double life planning weddings by day and helping Sherlock solve crimes for his journal by night.
Rosie wriggles out of John’s grasp and jumps down to slowly and clumsily mimic the kicks involved in the dance. John, without thinking, uses his phone to snap a quick video and photo to send to Sherlock later. Somehow, though, he is still mesmerized watching Sherlock and Irene moving around the dancefloor expertly.
John laughs. That’s too cute. “That settles it then. We’ll see him later tonight. How does that sound?”
’ Irene types, and breaking her promise keeps the phone out of Sherlock’s grasp for a few seconds while she lets the implication of her words sink into John Watson’s tiny mind. It seems to be working as Watson’s dots appear and disappear on the screen. On the ground, Sherlock begins to tap a finger but doesn’t protest Irene continuing to not surrender the phone.
Currently a couple dressed in white waltzes to a version of a romantic American pop song that seems to have a tune he vaguely recognizes
). He looked back at the best man, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things. He wasn't. The man was still anxious, still bouncing, and still checking his watch. What could it be? What could be so important he was worried about being late but not so important as to have the man run out of church right this second? Sherlock just couldn't put his finger on it...
First Sherlock and Irene did one dance. Then Molly meets Irene. Then John goes away and is sad. Then Sherlock and Irene do another dance, which Greg watches and is like "Lol this is great." and then John finds out Irene is Iris and then Sherlock and Irene dance again and then John - bless him - HE TEXTS SHERLOCK BECAUSE HE'S A JEALOUS MESS! Aha! Ahahahahaha!
Harry beamed, “Oh, I was thinking, you could do a slideshow for us at the rehearsal dinner, you know, put pictures of Mary and I together and say funny things.”
’ Dorian steps into her space and begins his own sensual grinding in her direction, though he never quite touches her. The video stutters but continues, the shorter-haired brunette pushes her friend aside and steps in to dance in Dorian’s face. The boy laughs and backs down while Sherlock steps forward to challenge the woman.
Ever since Eurus Sherlock has decided to start exploring himself emotionally and physically. He’s realized that shutting down his emotions as he’d been doing before is not healthy for him and that suppressing his desires is equally harmful. Eurus has helped with that, in her own way. She has shown him what free reign of his emotions could do to him and to others. He always feels drained when he visits her for that reason. Eurus, unlike Mycroft, to put it mildly, is extremely mischievous (read: chaotic). She encourages Sherlock to free himself emotionally through their music and also through short conversations.
The stage is lit in golden lights. Sherlock stands in the center of the stage in a black suit with a tight white shirt and a shiny golden tie. One of his hands reaches slowly above him as a woman’s voice begins singing “
“I understand completely, John. Soooo maybe I'll bump into you during morning yoga?” Seeing John's livid expression Sherlock quickly amended, “Maybe not. I'll see you around,” He nodded his goodbye and swaggered towards the exit waving at John without looking back.
“I can see that,” John comments, “So, why am I here? I assume it’s not to watch you get groped by a child.”
“Hmm,” John intones, his nose drifting over Sherlock’s shoulder as the other man rubs his cheek against the side of John’s face. “Well, Consulting Detective Holmes… I hope,” he pauses to kiss Sherlock’s shoulder, “That you didn’t wake up the landlady just so you could come in here…” another kiss, this one on his neck, “because that might be considered by some…” this kiss is on Sherlock’s jaw, “to be a bit not decent.”
“Hi, Sherlock,” the little twat simpers, “I hope you don’t mind me coming over. You said you’d be gone for just a moment and I
John laughs along too because Sherlock’s joy is infectious, “So which one have you picked then?” John asks, curiously.
Also this one's really short. Maybe should have combined it with the last one. Maybe I will when I finish and decide to edit the whole thing.
it a secret anyway?” John asks, curious, “I mean, you’ve never been shy about any of your other talents.”
“Taxi! Taxi...! Over here!” He yelled, extending his hand. A shiny black taxi pulled up to the curb in just under two seconds. John thanked his royal stars and jumped in, giving the cabby the address.
“Oh yeah, you sure about that?” Greg smirked at Molly while gesturing towards Sherlock with a facial expression that clearly read
“Oh please, this is so typical of you Harry!” John finally stormed, “You're not taking any responsibility for the shit that you've done! Harry you lied to Mary, not me! You manipulated–” but Harry glared at John as he advanced on her and picked up a bottle of air freshener, preparing to spray it at John's face, “Put down the bottle! Harriet, put down the bottle!” He struggled with it trying to hide his face as he grabbed her, not wanting to use too much force until he was able to pry it out of her hands. She screeched and bit him to make him let go of her wrist, “God-dammit Harry!” and she squirmed out of his reach, dashing as she reached for another item to throw at him, John stopped her and turned her round, grabbing both her wrists and holding her as she yanked back, trying, but failing miserably to escape his grip, “Did you even love her?” He asked, “Or was it just convenient?”
He should have known that wouldn’t last either though, because the next sound he hears wakes him up completely and at once he is entirely aware that he is still on the couch, naked, sticky with sweat, spit and other bodily fluids, and also completely covered in the naked body of another man who is, to his mortification, in a similar state to Sherlock’s. You see, the sound that has fully awakened Sherlock is none other than the voice of John Hamish Watson saying loudly, “Good morning, Sherlock - I hope you don’t mind my letting myself in - I wanted to talk to y-“
The sentiment makes Sherlock burst into laughter just as the phone dings to remind him to check the two previous messages. The sound just makes him laugh more, but only because Irene’s frown just continues to grow more thunderous. She gets up, apparently fuming, to go get the device. She claws through a pile of clothes in her bag until she gets it. She opens the messages and grimaces to hide a smile - not wanting to let Sherlock know that the message actually made her kind of want to squeal at the cuteness. She pretends to glare at the still giggling Sherlock and makes sure to catch his eye before she tosses the phone in his direction. She miscalculates and Sherlock is so busy laughing at her facial expression that the phone hits him square in the face. To Irene’s annoyance, the convenient accident only makes him laugh harder. Her lips twitch and suddenly she’s done for. A burst of giggles leaves her throat before she can stop them. Soon she and Sherlock are sitting there with stupid grins on their faces for no reason.
Rosie grins innocently and answers, “Elfant?” Referring to her stuffed pink and very inanimate friend.
Ribbons of semen suddenly splash out onto John's belly and coat his hand with the slick white liquid. Sherlock has arched his back completely, scratching at John's back with blunt yet sharp fingernails. He's crying out in a loud exhale as his body shivers and spasms with his release. John shudders at the site of Sherlock's face - those gorgeous eyes open wide in an expression of surprise and his mouth open in an "Oh!"
“In her defence she didn't know I had feelings for Mary. She's my boss. I'm just going to have to get over it. I don't really have a choice... and neither do you by the way...” Irene looked at John questioningly as they switched from downward facing dog to warrior, “She wants you to be her bridesmaid.”
“No. No, I won't do it. I say no on principal, count me out.” She stuck her nose in the air petulantly.
His thought is confirmed and his expectations are even surpassed when the man finally starts fucking him. Sherlock loses himself in the heat of it, pushing all memories and thoughts of his recent case with John as far away as he can until he is just Sherlock, living in this moment, feeling everything and his mind is blank, free of all his heartbroken agony. The body against him is warm and strong. It isn’t John, and there was no romance behind it - just pure carnal pleasure, but it is perfect. It is what he wants - what he needs right now. His eyes sting a little but he doesn’t pay them any mind. Instead, he keeps them shut and pulls the warm body of his anonymous lover against him. He holds tightly as the other man fucks him into sweet oblivion. Sherlock comes with a loud shout and his partner quickly follows, collapsing over him. Sherlock puffs and the rearrange each other more comfortably. The other man sighs contentedly and pulls the throw blanket over them, boneless and spent just like Sherlock.
John stared around the shop and said nothing while he waited for Harry to start yelling. He knew by now it was best to let her get out all her anger first and then try to reason with her. If he spoke first, there was no way she would listen, and anyway Harry owed him as much of an apology as he owed her.
“Was that really necessary?” John asked, laughing as Sherlock came back to the bar, “What about Jennifer?” John hissed.
Sherlock snorts a little impolitely, “Doubtful. Our strongest competition is probably Algie and Gwen, followed by Dorian and Cecily.”
As the men attempt to distract themselves by staring at anything but each other, clearing their throats in a transparent show of both shyness and excitement, a voice interrupts them saying, “Hi, welcome to our café, I’ll be your waiter, my name is –” and as the two men begin to turn their attention towards the speaker. The owner of the voice – their waiter – gasps in recognition, “Sherls?” He asks.
“Oh Mary! Of course I will!” Harriet practically jumped Mary as she pulled her in for a kiss, one hand of each side of her face.
“Ah Doctor, I'm afraid I'll have to decline, you see I've already set my sights on you, but I'll tell you what we can do; I propose that if at any point in your life, should you feel the need to speak with someone who doesn't need you to accompany them to a fitting or cake tasting or some ridiculous rehearsal dinner, you just give me a ring.”
Also, Rosie is a big surprise for me and I dunno what I'm doing when I'm writing her because I don't have children and I've not spent time with an actual real-live two-year-old since my youngest brother was a smol thing back in '98. Yeah, I'm old.
John kisses him sweetly in return and then begins another trail of kisses down to Sherlock's neck, where he once again decides to suck on the man's throat. Sherlock marvels at John's obsession with that part of him and grasps onto the back of John's head. He stretches to pull his head back and expose more of his throat. He allows another low moan to escape him. That seems to spur John forward as he drives his hips harder against Sherlock now, burying himself deeper and deeper. "Yes, John! F... just like that," Sherlock encourages. John's hips roll at a sinuous pace. Sherlock leans his head back once more, his low pants and whines coming back. He savours the feeling of fullness with John's cock sliding in and out of him. He pulls his arms around John and brings him closer still. John brings a hand down and begins to pull on Sherlock's now incredibly and painfully hardened cock. John is riding him into oblivion now. He can feel it as the combined sensation of John's cock inside him and his now moving hand make Sherlock feel a frantic pounding in his heart. He feels his body and mind begin to loose all inhibitions as he starts to sigh and moan slightly louder than before.
John goes first points to his chosen meal on the menu as he speaks, “I’ll have the risotto with the scallops and Caprese salad, please.”
Sherlock suddenly scoffs as he realizes where John’s funny little brain has taken him this time. “Oh, John do shut up,” he says, exasperated.
But John holds Sherlock back, waiting until his eyes are clear, “Sherlock,” John says again, to get his attention, then asks, as he runs a hand over what feels like some slightly raised flesh similar to some other points he’d felt further in, “What’s this on your back?”
She mentally asks, because at this point it’s obvious to her. John saw the photo. He’s even searched out Dorian’s name - and these texts? They are the equivalent of counting the number of texts Irene had sent Sherlock years ago (yes, Sherlock had told her about that and she’d almost made the trip back to London to hogtie them together). The texts are the equivalent of John Watson saying, “
An older woman walked up in front of him, blocking his way and startling him on his path (cousin Joseph's mother, it seemed) saying “John! You look so handsome! Good for you! Oh, darling it must be so hard seeing your younger sister get married before you!”
John laughed, and seemed about to speak when the nurse from before – the one who had squealed at John and glared at Mycroft walked up to them looking a little nervous and a little curious, “Mr. Holmes, I'm told that William can see you now. He's asleep, just now, but the danger is over. He'll wake up soon enough.”
Sherlock huffs and counts the reasons on three fingers, “You only date women. You’d said on many occasions that you’re not gay - stop I know, I misunderstood - but how was I supposed to know what you meant? - and then you married,
“John, John would you please stop apologizing?” Mary gave him a soft pitying look and stood to walk over to him from around her desk, “Look, the only reason I called you into my office is because I wanted to make sure you're okay, alright?”
“I’m sorry, darling,” She whispers as they leave. In her mind, she begins to devise a plan to try and help Sherlock tomorrow evening. She will not have him pining for that idiot forever. She is going to gift wrap John Watson for her friend even if she has to resort to her dirtiest tricks.
Sherlock’s brow wrinkles. Today doesn’t mark any particularly special day that he can remember, and The Woman doesn’t usually text him without an excuse. He contemplates whether or not he should even bother checking it. Most likely she’s just bored and wants to get a rise out of him. He snaps the violin case shut, clicking the latches into place and just happens to pass by his phone, which sits on the coffee table. He also just so happens to glance at the message flashing on the screen.
“Hey there Archie, how's it going?” John asked, genuinely glad to see the kid, ruffling his hair, “Sorry, you getting too old for that?” He asked.
Mary gave him a winning smile, “That's why I love you!” She exclaimed happily and popped her head back into her office, presumably to eat.
Oh his heart. His poor heart. Sherlock weeps for the state of it and how Eurus plays its tune so well, despite not understanding its plight. It must be suffering greatly, if even
Lestrade raises a brow at Molly who smiles at him and gestures that he should watch the interaction. Lestrade turns his head to look back to Sherlock and Irene.
him to. Sherlock's legs begin to tremble and a flush of red begins to bloom on his chest, creeping its way up to Sherlock's neck and face. He looks bloody marvelous. Sherlock is sweating and panting, his mouth is open in a silent scream of pleasure as sultry little sobs escape through his lips in a frantic rhythm. Finally Sherlock pleads, "John, please,
” This could. Sherlock is making an absolute fool of himself hoping, after years of evidence, that John would change his mind about being with Sherlock. The truth is, Sherlock knows exactly where he stands with John. He just keeps kidding himself into thinking that John will ever decide to… but he won’t. He never has done in the past. Why would he change now? John has a woman. He lives with her. He shares his life with her and is intimate with her in a way that he will never allow himself to share with Sherlock despite every opportunity that Sherlock has served him up on a silver platter to take. And now, this closeness together – this dance that should be sensual and seductive. God, it feels like a farce. It feels empty and Sherlock’s heart squeezes in his chest achingly. Piece by piece it’s broken while John moves against him instead of with him.
“What?” John asks, embarrassed and irritated all at once because he can’t believe he’s having this argument with yet another girlfriend and he’s not even living with Sherlock anymore. His posture stiffens as he remembers the words of one of his previous lovers spitting in fury, “
He figures out she has it of course. The first morning he wakes up without it he looks her in the eye and says, deadpan “Just make sure you don’t sign me up for social media – And please don’t bother Eurus.”
“Oh, er - no - just - she’s off to Molly’s,” Sherlock answers, finally coming down the stairs, eyes on John the whole way down.
John has gone over to pick up the broken monitor and he’s midway through gathering up the mess when he replays Sherlock’s words in his head, “Hang on,” he says with a smirk, “since when do you call her darling?”
While his mind throws a myriad of words towards him Sherlock also hears it screaming a familiar phrase at him:
Sherlock's other hand crept under John's jaw and Sherlock gently tilted John's head up so he was looking at him again, “You
Sherlock had blushed at her frankness, mainly because he wasn’t expecting her to comment on this again and especially not now.  Where had that even
“Oh... I'm...erm...that is...” He stammered, then frowned slightly, “Those things will kill you, you know.” He said gesturing at the cigarettes. He backed up into the club a bit, “Right... well... carry on.”
Thanks for reading and sharing and, and, and...!!! – for all the LOVE and kudos and COMMENTS (I live for them omg) and support and encouragement and for putting up with my awful grammar and lack of spell checking and run-on sentences. enjoy the chapter. I love you all! Xoxoxo!!
“What paper?” John asked, just as Sherlock raised his cup half-way to his face and stopped suddenly. His face paled while his eyes grew large in panic. He looked at John frantically as the waitress passed him a newspaper.
“Anything?” Dimock clarified, also standing. He hugged his arms around him and moved closer to John to hide in the sanctuary of the umbrella. The poor bloke looked like he was freezing in his thick rain-soaked jumper.
To Sherlock’s relief John answers him right away, “Yeah, hi, Sherlock. It’s nothing serious. Just can’t text very well with a wiggling toddler in my arms,”
“You know, the thing that I like about Harriet is that there's no –and pardon the word –bullshit. She's not afraid to be herself, and I love that in a woman.”
Sherlock frowned, not understanding. He said no to Mycroft all the time; whenever he could get away with it in fact, “But... you
Ps. Warning for smut? I mean I started this story with smut so I hope that it doesn’t present an issue Lol
John stared at the photo, “Well, it's your flash, it's blowing it up weird...” John tried. Sherlock's brow went up, “Alright, yeah it's... not good.”
“Ow, John, you’re hurting me!” His girlfriend protests and John blinks, frightened. He drops her hand immediately.
John picks her up. “Yes, we are at Sherlock’s. He’s sleeping right now though. So shhhhh!” He explains, pressing his fingers to his lips.
XD. Listen. It’s hilarious. Also I know that this is what some of you wanted ;) so I decided, you know what, maybe not exactly IN THE ACT buuuuut... close enough. I almost DID have John catch them going for a round 2 in the morning but I also didn’t want Sherlock and Unnamed Guy to get too attached to each other. I prefer they just be friends after this and for John to be jealous for no reason just like he is with Irene, cuz he’s a fucking idiot. John. Jawn. Babe. You’re stupid. I love you. I’m sorry. But you’re so dumb. To be fair Sherlock is also dumb. You’re both dumb. Y’all need to just fuck each other. You idiots.
“If you say so...” Sherlock replied, standing and pulling out a little tray from under the coffee table as he kneeled down next to it, “Now, swan or sydney opera house?”
,” he’d said. He should be happy for him… shouldn’t he? But he just can’t fight this feeling of foreboding… of wrongness.
Henry laughs, “Well if I’m going to be full of anyone it may as well be the person I like most, don’t you think,” he asks, nudging her.
“That's just what we were asking before you came in, actually.” The mousy girl told John as she turned to give a stern look to the severe woman, “We have a right to know, Anthea, he's our friend.”
“Five,” John answers, and winces. He’d answered a bit too quickly. She doesn’t seem to notice though.
Sherlock looks appalled, “I do not need a –! I can handle the boy –! I just can’t concentrate on too many people at once with him nattering on by my side,” he looks at John, explaining, “I swear he doesn’t stop talking. He just
Henry laughs, apparently seeing right through Sherlock because his eyes smile with a secret mirth while he says, “Yes, of course, my dear man, take all the time you need,” then he adds, “Of course, you know, when he finds out I didn’t contact him immediately after you arrived I shall have to blame you entirely for it.”
Finally both men reached the countdown in their head and came out of each door walking to meet each other at the altar.
Sally grimaces looking disgusted and Greg laughs saying, “I was going to say bold.” He looks at Sally with a wide smile, “D’you think John knows?”
Sherlock was stunned for a second, and looked at the road ahead. Realizing he had no idea where they were he asked John as calmly as he could manage, “... Could you perhaps just slow down a tic so I can read that sign coming up?”
Amazingly enough, it’s Sherlock who caves first. He rolls his eyes and sighs out, “Fine – but I’ll be feeding it to you, alright?”
“I saw you changing suits in the cab earlier while I was smoking,” Sherlock's eyes glittered. After watching John the whole night he'd figured out what John had been doing and now he
Both men are temporarily stunned, with Sherlock pausing and having his second awkward no-blinking stare of the evening, this time directing it at Rosie. “Um…” he says after a minute, then turns a nervous glance towards John, “John — I haven’t taught her that,” he explains, as if John would be angry with him.
John waited until everyone was seated. Once he was satisfied he tapped his champagne glass with his fork.
“Oh, very, very much.” John replies instantly, grabbing hold of Sherlock’s hand to play with his fingers, “And someday you will let me know who I have to thank for teaching you
“I'm going to give you...” William said, getting out what looked like a familiar little black book and handing it to John, “here you are.”
“Well thanks.” John answered as Harry got up. “Milk is in the fridge, sugar's on the counter and in the cupboard there are some –”
He was still in the clinic, well after everyone had gone home, sorting out some paper work throughout the offices when he notices Mary had left her purse in hers. John frowned at it, looked through her calendar without a thought and rushed off to return it to her.
“Your mother was a romantic.” Sherlock began, “She raised you and your sister with those beliefs. Your father however, was not so kind. In fact, he abhorred the romance she so adored. So much so that he wasn't particularly pleasant to her. You resent him for it. Hate him, in fact. He ruined your mother's perfect happy marriage, like so much poison. Worse. He took her from you when he lost his mind.
“God, it's so good to be home. Six months away feels like forever.” Harry plopped herself onto the couch and picked up John's framed article of their parent's wedding. She smiled again, genuine this time, if a little melancholy. She turned to John as he finished struggling with the luggage letting the door slam closed on its own, “They were my age, you know.” She remarked.
“Ungh, Sherlock...!” Was all he answered as they both felt their bodies shuddering. John watched as Sherlock's eyes opened wide and his pupils blew black practically covering the iris as the hot sticky liquid pulsed out of him onto John's stomach. He gave a few more hard thrusts in the afterglow and then fell boneless over Sherlock, completely spent and nuzzling against his neck.
“This is Iris,” She answers in her false accent, “Ah the crew is here? Yes, of course, we’ll just come down to get you. Do you mind turning the cameras off for a moment while we come down? Our dear friend is here with a child and the parent has not consented to have them on the show. Yes, we’re sorry we forgot that we had invited her. No. No, the child must remain out of video along with our friend. Yes. Thank you.” Irene hangs up the phone, “They’ve agreed to shut the cameras down, but I think we should sneak the little darling out along with Molly through Mrs. Hudson’s back door.”
Sherlock picks her up as he stands and cuddles his face into her curls, “I know how you feel. I’ve missed you, darling,” he mumbles. He turns to Molly, smiling and he’s sure his eyes probably look a little wet from unshed tears, “Thank you, Molly, though I thought you said you wouldn't be coming.”
“Of course you can, Ms. Watson, it's why I'm here.” Sherlock answered charmingly as John was left standing there looking crushed. John took a deep breath and went back to talk to Antoine.
John glances sideways at her, but he admits to himself that, yeah, she’s right. John had prayed for Sherlock to be polite but he’s utterly floored by the fact that he was. He honestly expected him to go off on the man on public television. Of course, this is a contest. Sherlock must really want to win if he hasn’t spoken back. To think, the man had had no issue practically flaying a court judge with his words during the Moriarty trial… Well, this was certainly a surprise. “Yeah,” John finally says, “Yeah I did not see that coming,”
Next month: Photo of Harry on Mary's desktop screen. (John breaks the syringe he's holding as Mary talks on the phone.)
The director indicates that the next dancers are ready and Claudia continues, “Alright, darlings, you can keep us posted during the week with me on It Takes Two, and for the audience at home: don’t forget to vote for your favorite couple - you know where to go!” she signs off as the cameras in front of them are switched off. “Well, I’ll be back in a minute, play nice children,” Claudia comments as she makes her way over to the make-up artist just behind the curtain to powder her nose.
“How d'you know they were having an affair?” John asked as they got off the bike in front of the pub.
John rolled his eyes and said, quietly, “Harriet, I didn't know he was writing an article about me...”
Rosie looks to John, who has now leaned back slightly. John shrugs at her and picks up his drink, leaning back, even more, to signal that he won’t be assisting her in resisting Sherlock’s orders. “You did say you were hungry, Rosie,” he states.
, Sherlock thought as he grasped John's thighs, pulled him closer and swallowed John's thickened cock all the way down his throat.
John feels himself redden at the reminder of it. The doors of 221B closed, the curtains drawn, the closeness of Sherlock’s body to his own, the deep notes of his baritone voice instructing
At the look of confusion on both John and Harry's faces he explained, “William Sherlock Scott Holmes. I use Sherlock for the by-line as it seems a tad more romantic, also I don't get stalked by the Crazy brides and grooms.” Harry giggled at that, while Sherlock continued, “So how did you meet Mary?”
“Shut up, Sherlock! Shut-up! We're about to fucking die and you're sitting there making jokes, just shut the fuck u- AAAAHH SHHIIIITTT!!!”
, he thinks to himself, because what the hell is that about? He looks away quickly, turning his gaze to the people behind Sherlock and coughs awkwardly, “No, I suppose not,” he mumbles awkwardly.
“Oh it’s quite simple, really,” Algernon assures John, “especially if you use Dorian’s strategy. Don’t worry about everyone else in the room – not even your dance adversary. What you want to do is shut your eyes and picture yourself having sex. Move your body the way you would to hit that sweet spot when you make love. Sherlock is a good dancer, but his weakness is that he’s very technical. If you go at him with things he doesn’t expect he gets shy. It’s how Jack beat him the last time we had a dance battle. Just do something he wouldn’t expect. It’s bound to throw him off long enough to maybe get us a win. Plus, I’ve seen him downing drinks like a mad-man tonight. With any luck, he’s drunk enough to be clumsy.”
“Yay!” Rosie cheers. Sherlock’s speaker begins to play the jive from last week that he and Irene had danced to. Rosie begins to bounce in Sherlock’s arms, so he puts her down and gets on his knees to twirl her around on the living room floor. John laughs along with them. Seeing Sherlock on the ground like that is ridiculous but it’s so much better to have this sweet image of him waving his hands around in a silly way and twirling his daughter than to have the images of Sherlock actually dancing appear before him. He knew, of course, that Sherlock wouldn’t be pulling any of the moves he did on video in front of him, but he’d still been afraid that seeing the man dance would make him dwell on the past images.
Sherlock groans and flops back against his pillows, “Must we...?” He asks. Rosie flops on top of him and sighs dramatically to emphasize his point.
And now… Now he was likely going to see Sherlock do what he had done to unravel John up close. God, he wasn’t sure if it was luck or some kind of curse coming to this party. Isn’t it enough for whoever runs this cruel universe that John had already seen him dancing against this kid earlier tonight? Isn’t it enough that Sherlock had tried to dance with him just now? Fuck, how is John going to survive this?
“John? What?” Sherlock asks, rubbing one eye as he sits up slowly and reaches over to bring Rosie onto the bed with him.
Anyway, enjoy the update. I probably failed my midterms by choosing to write this instead of studying, (update – I only almost failed ONE midterm, which is fine because I totally saw that coming and also I hate that class and I'll recover eventually)so... you're welcome. But also it was my choice and I am very bad at managing my life but no one cares about that anyway so i'll shut up about it.
Sherlock blinks in confusion at the sudden anger and disdain dripping from John’s voice. “What?!” He asks, his tone equally as appalled as it is confounded. “What in the hell are you on about?”
Sherlock is actually relieved when he gets a whiff of a very distinct cologne even while he’s being overwhelmed with the data of the strangers around him. While this scent doesn’t belong to the person he’s looking for, it does mean some kind of reprieve from this false intimacy with John. Besides, if he’s guessed correctly (and he has, he knows he has) then the person they were looking for can’t be far behind. He steers deliberately in the direction of the smell and purposely crashes himself into the person it belongs to, effectively disentangling himself from John’s grip.
“If you say so, but that’s meant to be for you, so don’t feed her all of it.” John scolds teasingly.
Dimock looked out the window and saw another flash of lightning crack through the sky. “Alright,” He finally conceded, “but here,” He handed Sherlock a pair of keys, “It's for my motorcycle. It's parked 'round back. I'll go with Carter.” Sherlock made a grab for them, and DI Dimock looked at him before he relinquished them, “It's a little ways off from here, farther up the road towards the other said of town, almost facing the country. Do be careful Mr. Scott, I know you've been drinking.”
“Give me just a second, I want to get you something, Harry, don't go anywhere!” Their mother flittered out of the living room and went in the direction of her own bedroom.
“No.” John said suddenly, “No, no, no, no, no. Nope.” and he turned and walked out of the little room, his heart suddenly feeling like it was shattering into pieces. Harry turned and followed him, confused.
“Ah there you are Archie!” Mary popped into John's office, smiling at little Archie, followed by Harry. “This is Archie, he's basically my adopted son.” Mary explained.
“Sherlock, a dead body? What the hell?” John asked him as they walked round the side of the little pub to a tiny parking lot.
John took it gratefully “Oh, great Ta,” he sighed then pulled the receiver to his ear and smiled, “Hi Bill... yeah they just finished steaming it... Yes, yeah, I know, thank the stars we're both still the same size and build – Army did us a favour, didn't it?” John laughed, “... Yeah, don't worry about it alright? I'm going to bring it over to you in just a minute. Don't fret over a thing – this is your day, mate.” With a thank you from Bill Murray (the groom), John hung up the phone and turned to the tailors.
“Mary, let me just explain,” He began as he walked into her office, “I had no idea what he was writing,”
“But... but you write the most beautiful things.” John looked so disappointed as he asked, “Do you actually believe in love and marriage and just pretend to be a cynic or are you actually a cynic who knows how to spin romantic crap for saps like me?”
Sherlock reaches John’s swollen length within seconds and feels his mouth water with the thought of John’s thick cock inside of it. Sherlock looks up as he grasps John’s dick and finds John is holding himself up on his elbows to get a better look at Sherlock bent over and laying between his spread legs. Sherlock smirks. He brings his lips to the head of John’s cock and presses a light kiss to it. He continues to watch John for a reaction and when he sees John swallow he turns his head slightly and licks a long trailing line up the shaft. He turns the other way and does it again, lathing it with his tongue as seductively as he can. He then brings his lips up over the head again and sinks the ring of his mouth down to envelope John’s cock. He hollows his cheeks in a suck and then begins to bob his head up and down around John.
do is I can be their friend, and I can give them all the love and respect and gratitude that they deserve for ever daring to care about a person like me. Again, I can only do this
Yes, sister. That first night I met you I didn't think of you as anything more than the cabby who had driven John round London to help him attend two weddings. Still, I noticed the photo you kept on your dash. You and a woman slightly younger bearing a striking resemblance to yourself. Younger than you but not young enough to be your daughter. Sister, then, obvious. Next one's easy, you know it already.”
Sherlock receives a swift smack on the back of the bead from the detective before he returns with, “Oi, shut up, you! You’re not much younger –Mr. ‘
“But you wrote it.” John said, quietly, “You wrote it and you gave your brother the story anyway. Be a man, and admit it... or don't, but please, please don't pretend that you give a
go by without a teensy weensy bit of vengeance. If he does, then clearly he doesn’t know her very well. She takes the device the first chance that she gets. Sherlock is asleep, but unlike Irene, he doesn’t hide his phone from her. Why would he need to? He leaves the thing on his bedside table before they turn in for the night. At first, Irene thinks he’s trying to tempt her. Later she learns that he actually just doesn’t care. He doesn’t often use it. Either way, she decides to steal the phone despite his lack of care for it and she snoops through it every chance she gets.
“You'll recognize her too John, that woman there is Jennifer Wilson. She was the bride featured for one of my articles in the commitments column called 'A Marvel in Pink.' She was the one who had that horrible cotton-candy wedding. God it was torture.”
“To you it's just another casserole dish, to Harry it's the pot she's going to cook mum's christmas roast in.” John explained.
John gives Angelo a fond grin and shakes his hand in greeting as Rosie shyly hides her face in the crook of John’s neck, “Hello, Angelo, yes and thank you. Yes, she’s growing up fast. She’s two already.”
want that for this part. I did mean to make it a little funnier but it kept getting too sweet and adorable every time i added the sillies.
“You need to get out.” Sherlock says as the man pulls out, a slightly disappointed yet sly grin on his face as he asks Sherlock in return,
Greg shakes his head, answering loudly, “No! She’s upstairs in VIP with Sally and that Henry guy – we snuck Sally in earlier with one of Molly’s new friends from the make-up crew – I didn’t want to risk leaving her alone in case Sherlock buggered off somewhere!”
Sherlock merely took one of the foil packets and tore in open with his teeth. He crawled back a bit and made quick work of rolling the thing onto John's cock. He took a liberal amount of lube and grabbed at the base, slowly moving his slippery hand upwards to cover John with it. He smiled up at John shyly then and crawled forward to kiss John another time. This time the kiss was slow, sweet and warm. John ran a hand through his hair one more time and caressed Sherlock's cheek tenderly.
“Thank you, Tony,” Sherlock says, addressing the waiter with a small smile, “that’s wonderful of you. Give Angelo our thanks.”
is the famous Doctor Watson. I wondered when Sherlock’s partner in crime-solving would be making his appearance. I was under the impression that the two were inseparable if the old blog was anything to go by. Oh, but would you look at that —! How close they are — Oh, this is
The man grins at her and takes her hand in his, lifting it to his lips, “Henry Wotton,” he says, “Charmed.”
Sherlock sat with the rest of the guests in church looking up as Bill and his wife were joined in 'Holy Matrimony' as they said. Ugh.
Once he’s gone, Sherlock and John fall back into a slightly awkward silence. Finally, Sherlock clears his throat softly and says, “You shouldn’t encourage him,”
“I'm sorry.” She said, her eyes suddenly worried, “It just sort of... came out of me. It was just sudden– I mean you–”
Holy rusted metal Batman! What a fuckin’ doozy of a chapter. It ended up being super long and I really just had to cut it off here so you guys could read it sooner. For some reason whenever I write a case it gets annoyingly long and complicated because I always start off without a plot and then I add all these stupid details that I later have to go back and address because I forget about them, and then I have to avoid all the inevitable plot-holes (I always miss something though).
Thoughts of Molly bring with them the association to Sherlock, though, and John’s mind is quickly occupied by him again. He gives up on actually doing any paperwork during his break (as he’d originally planned) and instead decides to google Sherlock’s name in relation to strictly. A few articles are the old ones he’d already seen, and a few videos are repeats of previous interviews that John had also already binged through. Finally, he gives up and goes to the social media page he’d seen Sherlock open over the past few days - ‘Instagram’ the icon reads - and he finds Sherlock has posted two new photographs since last night - or at least, the PR person in charge of it has? John’s pretty sure Sherlock wouldn’t open one of these on his own unless he was allowed to share photographs of murder victims and ask the general public to help him solve them. He especially doubts Sherlock has opened this page as the pictures from last night feature him at a nightclub. The first is of Sherlock with his hands splayed on Irene’s waist while her back is turned to him as they appear to be dancing somewhat sensually. Her face is turned away from the camera, but John knows it’s her because she’s still wearing the costume she wore for her performance. Sherlock’s eyes are closed and he looks almost at peace. John’s a bit stunned to see it up, wondering why Sherlock would allow such an intimate looking picture to be shared online. It’s like he never listens to John when he tells him to be careful about his public image.
When John returns Sherlock is snoring quietly. That was quick. He gives the man a fond smile and steps forward, wiping him clean. He then takes a few linens out of Sherlock's closet and does his best to arrange them over the sweat-covered sheets. This is exceedingly difficult as Sherlock is lying like a heavy stone deep in slumber on his side. John finally gives up and just climbs into the bed, throwing the duvet over himself and Sherlock. Sherlock, for his part, quickly snuggles up to John, holding him close in his sleep. John sighs contently, brushing away a curl and kissing Sherlock's forehead,
“It’s Kate.” She’d said, as soon as Sherlock had sat down at the little table while she had poured herself a drink. Her eyes had been red-rimmed as she’d said it.
“It's just... I wanted to ask...” Sherlock hesitated, “... about... her. About... Mary. I- you don't have to... that is... I'm just... curious, I suppose.”
“Oh,” Dorian says, his cheeks flushing in pleasure, assuming Sherlock is flirting back, which, admittedly Sherlock is doing, hoping to charm some information out of the naive little twit. Sherlock would feel guiltier if he wasn’t already used to using his charms to gain information on cases, besides, a few couple of questions wouldn’t hurt anyone. So long as he didn’t let things get too far, everything would be okay.
Sherlock pouts, but brings his hands to John’s hips anyway and abruptly pulls John to him so that their erections rub against the other’s body. “Better?” Sherlock asks, with a roll of his hips.
Sherlock nods in agreement and they both finally make their way back to the exceedingly loud party downstairs. As they make their dissent, John turns his head back to ask Sherlock who is just a step behind him, “So how are you planning on talking to Jack through all that noise?”
“Well hello, gorgeous.” The man greets Sherlock when he arrives. He’s slightly shorter than Sherlock and Sherlock can see that the man’s photos certainly didn’t do that body any justice. He is even better-looking in person. Mid-forties by the look of him, but still quite the specimen. Or maybe Sherlock is just really desperate for it. Without further thought Sherlock grabs him by the collar, pulls him inside and
John woke to the feeling of Sherlock stroking his fingers up and down his spine as John lay over him feeling completely relaxed. He smiled into Sherlock's neck, “Good morning.” He mumbled groggily.
Sherlock saw then that John would never forgive him. He felt his throat constrict and he knew his eyes must be glossing over right about now. He looked back behind John's face in an attempt to hide the distress he felt and a quiet sound, almost like a breath and a sob escaped his lips as he looked into John's clear blue eyes for what he intended to be the last time and began walking away.
“If you say so…” Sherlock says, swiftly and somehow gracefully sitting up with his arms full of squirming toddler and then standing. He proceeds to do a quick twirl with Rosie in his arms before he stoops to John and offers him his hand, “come along, John, you heard the lady. We need to stand in order to dance.”
. John isn’t sure he’s ever seen anything like it. He feels his cheeks go red as he tries to open the app to find the video again. He finds his hands are a little shaky and his palms are sweaty as he taps the screen. Dear God… was that really Sherlock Holmes?
Irene snorts, “My god you are really deep in it aren’t you?” She mumbles as she passes him in the hall.
Sherlock can't find any words to say, so he just nods, his eyes begging John to continue. With a gentle squeeze to Sherlock's leg, and quick kiss to the inside of his knee, John enters him. He grunts when he feels the head of his cock is completely enveloped inside of Sherlock and stops himself, wanting to be careful with his lover. Sherlock, however, has other ideas. He wraps his other leg around John, and with a pull that is much more forceful than a person of Sherlock's body type looks capable of achieving, drags John forward and further into his body. His cock is coated in so much lube that he slips inside of him quite easily. "Move, John," Sherlock commands and John doesn't have to be told twice. He starts his movements slowly, pushing in and out of Sherlock to get him used to the sensation of him inside. Sherlock reciprocates by pushing against John, continuing to bring him closer to himself until John finally almost falls forward over him.
John let go and kissed Harry's cheek. “You'll look beautiful, I'm sure of it,” He said and letting go made a show of hiding 'manly tears' while going to the bathroom and shutting the door to hide before he broke apart in front of them.
“You know her?” Dimock asked, crouching down beside Sherlock. John moved to stand over them with the umbrella, if only so they'd get less wet.
Mike visibly calmed. “Oh... thanks John. Thank you. God I feel much better. You're right. Of course you're right.”
Sherlock brought his hands back to his face and covered the shock on his lips with both as best he could as he took a breath, “John–”
. A more accurate statement would be 'most overly romantic women in london rip open that page'. Third and most importantly, I've said it once and I'll say it again, girls are not really my area, nor do I want them to be.”
Harry's yelling and John's reverie were interrupted by the ringing of John's home phone. John made no move to stand up and Harry turned, exasperated to pick up.
Sherlock sighs, getting up to press his forehead against one of the windows. It has been exactly two years since the whole business with Mary’s death along with Eurus’ kidnapping of John Watson and John has since abandoned Sherlock in favour of another boring potential wife. Sherlock can’t be bothered to remember her name. He deletes any information he receives about her as soon as he gets it. He supposes that it was bound to happen again eventually, though, John having one more go at a normal civilian life. He does have a baby to care for on his own now, after all and Sherlock’s lifestyle is hardly an environment in which ‘normal’ or ‘sane’ people would want to raise their child. Sherlock thinks it’s rather unfair, to be honest, because Sherlock would give his life to protect John’s progeny - to teach her and guide her would be an experiment he would be curious to perform - but at the same time he can hardly fault the man for wanting to keep his baby away from him. Sherlock has a way of destroying everything he touches, if not directly, then by indirect contact. Even knowing the logic behind John’s actions, Sherlock can’t help the ache in his heart as his mind conjures unwanted images of John with a faceless woman, fingers skimming down her skin, holding her, embracing her. Her lips grazing his lips…
“Ugh. Stop,” she says, looking happy for him despite her words, “The idiot probably doesn’t even realize it’s a date. He’ll probably bring his daughter. Invite Molly over tomorrow evening and tell him she’s staying with me to read over some case files or something. Maybe he’ll be willing to leave the child so you two can be alone.”
“Go on up!” Algernon yells over the loud thumping music, “Harry’s upstairs greeting everyone – I’m off to find Cecily. Join you for drinks, later alright?”
John's still a little ooc and so is Sherlock... along with everyone else. I'm hoping me sneaking in quotes from the show makes them act more themselves but... ah... difficult with this story. >.>
Eventually, after a whole week of waiting to see if Sherlock will ask him to help with the case, and with Sherlock dodging him, John grows a little frustrated and gives up on the hope of being called to help at all. Clearly, if Sherlock isn’t going to say something to him about it, then he is deliberately keeping John out and John is not keen to interfere where he is obviously not wanted. He doesn’t go see Sherlock, and he doesn’t watch or follow-up on Sherlock’s process in the competition. He finds that he doesn’t like to explore the feelings of uneasiness he’s gotten after the images of Sherlock embracing his dance partner had haunted him that first night he’d seen them. At first, he tells himself it’s because it just feels so wrong seeing him look so tactile and fake on a screen, knowing everyone thinks that the mask he’s putting forward is a real picture of him… but part of him – a part that he’s decided to keep buried deep inside of himself, going so far as to deny its existence even to himself – part of him is afraid that Sherlock is having fun on this case without John. That same part of him whispers darkly in his ear at night, telling him his worst fear – that Sherlock doesn’t need him anymore.
the tower of edible gifts for the Berwick outdoor charity. You can do anything, and we both know it, so you're going to do the cake, and you're going to do it in three weeks and I would like a discount, please.” John commanded in his best Captain's voice. Hadn't done that in a while. It felt even better when the chef smiled warmly at John, answering him with a look of admiration,
Sherlock lets his body guide him, feeling as if his heart is beating along to the sound of the music. He’d be lying to himself if he said he wasn’t taking every opportunity he had right now to rub up against John - to touch him the way he’s always wanted to touch him – the way he wished he had during their “not-a-date”. John, on the other hand, is resisting Sherlock’s touches. He pulls away when certain parts of themselves get too close. He moves slightly clumsily to the music, but he doesn’t take a single opportunity to touch Sherlock in return. He simply maneuvers him strategically away when he feels the need to. Sherlock begins to second-guess himself. His movements begin to subconsciously become shyer as they dance their way further into the crowd. Had he been wrong about everything the other night? He’d thought that perhaps John might finally feel something for him in return. Had he just been imagining it? Was it just wishful thinking?
alert. I was the minute you told me to help you do this. And even more so when you told me to watch the door. Second, the key word here is
Sherlock and John looked at each other, but Sherlock spoke first, a sly smile on his face, “You're right... I'm sure they will, after all they owe you for catching them their serial killer. Now, if you wouldn't mind, detective I am exhausted. I'd love to come in and make my statement in the morning. John and I need someplace to stay the night, though, of course.”
“You don't know what you're talking about!” John shouted, “She's my boss, she's my sister, they're both gay, and I am thrilled,
” Sherlock exclaims the words without a care who’s sitting nearby. “John, what the HELL is going on in that funny little head of yours? You think that I was giving Josh my– That doesn’t even make any sense, John!”
. He feels himself vibrating with the pleasure and excitement of it. “Perhaps...” he says, quietly - voice slightly muffled by its place by Rosie’s little arm - “... partner?”
Sherlock smiles at John’s choice of words, knowing well why he’d felt the need to extend that last bit. God, could this be any more embarrassing? “It’s fine, John,” he answers then adds, “So, are we, um...?”
Sherlock eyes her suspiciously, “If you wouldn’t mind…” he begins, hesitating slightly… she’s up to something, he can feel it.
Mary kneeled in front of her, holding her hand in one of her own, “So... I've no idea how my parents met because as you know, I'm an orphan, but I like to imagine they were married for many happy years even if I didn't get to be a part of their family. I... I've been waiting my whole life to feel the way I always imagined my parents would feel for each other, and for the most part I know I've been busy making something of myself but, I think I miss someone sometimes and Harry... Harry the moment I saw you I knew that we could be great together. So, um... Harriet Watson...” Mary opened the bos with a beautiful ring in it, “will you do me the honour of becoming my bride?”
Oh,” she turned back to John, screaming in his face and waving her arms about as she spoke this last part, “But you'd better alert
“She asks you if you want a drink, you smile charmingly, lead her to the bar, and you let her buy you a drink. If you already have a drink you down it and say gin and tonic, then there's some flirting, some inner office sex, an accidental pregnancy, a shot-gun wedding and a life of bliss!” She explains, “How many times do we have to go over this?”
Sherlock opens his eyes and leans forward to deposit the alcohol the young man has brought him on the table. He turns as soft a grin on him as he can and says, “No, no. I’m fine. I just needed to have a little rest.”
Sherlock glares at her, suddenly brought into the conversation, but he grins at the competitors as he says, “We might be willing to join you...”
John nods, “Yes, and I’d better get back to Sherlock.” Both men return to the restaurant, John holding the door open for Josh as he allows the man to walk back in. They share a last polite exchange and John returns to the table, where he finds Sherlock spoon feeding Rosie some soft fruits and cereal and a plate of a freshly laid out full English breakfast in both his and John’s place.
So this chapter is really short, just like the last one. As I said, Originally this and the previous chapter were meant to be one chapter but I didn't want to make you guys wait. I thought leaving you off with Irene's text would be a fun place to stop the story while you waited.
He starts off fine, but as the day progresses he grows more and more irritated with himself. His mind is driving him mad - the image of Sherlock lying naked and peacefully asleep with another man coiled around him is simply burned into his memory. It plays on and on in his mind like a video feed on constant loop, torturing him into a state of scorching rage bubbling just beneath the surface of his skin. And, ugh! John just doesn’t understand why he can’t just fucking stop thinking about it.
about it.” Sherlock stops. He turns to the screen and breathes, and John says nothing. What can he say?
Sherlock rolls his eyes and chooses to ignore John’s kick in favour of passing some of his own food to the baby, “Please. Mother would do that anyway. No, I just think it would be funny to see him annoyed that mummy gets to be the one spilling one of my ‘secrets’ instead of him.”
“YOU RIPPED A FUCKING WEEK OUT OF MY DIARY?! Are you insane?” Came John's angry voice over the phone.
I wanted to show Eurus in a different light for this story. I know she’s the ‘bad guy’ but I want to show how Sherlock has literally ‘defeated’ the evil with Love. Though she’s still a nut-case. Hopefully I’ve done what I wanted with her. I didn’t expect her to show up so much but I found that when I started writing her I almost couldn’t stop. I’m pretty sure that now that she’s (almost) stopped wanting to squeeze her brother like a child wanting to squeeze a cute bunny till its head pops off that she’s on board with Sherlock having a relationship. John better watch out though. I feel like if he hurts Sherlock again Eurus won’t be as understanding as Mycroft has been.
“– but if you don't, then you'll just be my brother, which is what it should be.” Harry hesitated, “Maybe... when I was young I needed you to help me or you needed to help me, but
gay, Sherlock -“ at Sherlock’s look of utter confusion he adds, ”look I suppose if we’re labeling it I’m about half-way on the er, Kinsey scale -
John shakes his head and starts to move towards the couch to sit down when Rosie calls loudly, “Daddy, you dance with us too!”
Irene raised her eyebrow again and grabbed the envelope. John scowled at her and snatched it back. “Your face'll get stuck like that one day, you'll see.” He grumbled and tore open the envelope with his letter-opener. And pulled out a simple card with the just the following words typed out:
The lovers wake up in each others' arms all cute and sweet and d'awww. And then the shit hits the fan.
Poor Sherlock. His day with Eurus must have been tough today. John often wonders what happens during Sherlock’s family visits with his sister, but he’s never had the heart to ask, and he doesn’t do so now. He can’t - not with the way Sherlock looks at the mention of her. The loss of his friend must really eat him up inside, especially knowing that it was his beloved little sister that took him from him. John sits next to Sherlock and murmurs gently, “Why wouldn’t I want to watch it?” His smile is soft and supportive.
John whines. Sherlock is going to ruin him isn’t he? This is going to be so good and so perfect that John will be ruined for anyone else after this - he just
She wrings her hands in her lap, barely concentrating on the show and even missing the big musical celebrity number as she considers whether or not to tell John when he comes home to get Rosie. Would Sherlock be terribly upset with her if she told?
couple,” Here John gave a barely noticeable unpleasant smile as he continued, “A couple whose love is the stuff of myths. Their compatibility is so exact, that it can only be described as having been designed by the gods.”
“So far so good. We’re in at least. John is coming. He’ll be texting once he gets here,” Sherlock replies, leaning closer to Lestrade.
Once they settle, and Rosie is snuggled up to Sherlock’s side, John comes over and sits at the edge of the mattress. He reaches for the tray of food and extends it towards Sherlock. “Made you some dinner,” he says.
“What? No.” John was very clearly annoyed. “No, that's okay,” John turned to Mary, “I'm sure we can get you back on time, I've borrowed Irene's car, that thing is very fast, too fast even,”
One month later: John finds another note by William stuck to his lamp at his desk. “Dinner?” It reads. John throws it in the trash.
The bartender seemed to hear that and looked up at them, “Did you say murder?” he asked, his eyes practically bulging out of his face.
“Well, more accurately put he's my godson. He comes over to hang out with me sometimes when his mum's got important business things to do. Keeps me company, don't you Archie?”
“Dear God,” John says, horrified, “Or ever, if I have anything to say about it,” which only makes Sherlock laugh more.
“You do volunteer work? Really?” Mary looked impressed. John paid for the food and tried to ignore his embarrassment on Harry's behalf. “No offence meant,” Mary continued, “But you just don't seem like the type of person to take time out of your day for those sort of things, especially in those shoes.”
John feels his face morphing into an expression of incredulity. His mouth opens in a slight gape with a hint of an amused smile while his brow raises in confusion, because John knew Sherlock could dance a waltz - he’d been rigorous in his training before John’s wedding - but never in a thousand years could John have guessed that Sherlock had the ability to move like
“John those aren't exactly deal breakers, they sound more like pretty cool hobbies. Besides, you can shoot a gun and your army training makes you a pretty good shot but you don't see me freaking out about it. You sexist.”
John stood at attention immediately, “Hi!” Irene gave him a look, he tried to relax a bit but found he was still smiling very wide. John tried to ignore the feeling of his cheeks flaring up and went forward in his greeting. “How was it?” He asked Mary as she entered the office.
“You know what I think?” John asked, as he removed the glittering pig from the register list using his own scanner, “I think that all of your statistics and theories are just a smoke-screen.”
Greg walks into his office and sits down at his desk to watch the full video of Sherlock’s routine on his own phone. He allows himself a small chuckle of wonder at his friend’s newly revealed hidden skill. Sally was right to show him. The footage is a welcome distraction from the photographs and the information hidden in his manila folder. Before opening his file, he decides to satisfy his curiosity. He fires off two texts, one to Sherlock and one to John.
“No! John, look, please!” Sherlock followed after him and said, “Come here, listen to me,” as he grabbed John's hand and pulled him back to face him.
Last but certainly not least, as you know already, I’ve been with Gray all night and honestly I think I got lucky finding out all I did. I’m not sure about re-joining him again anytime soon. He’s annoying, but either way, I’d like you to join me from this point forward.”
Dimock nodded. He began told Sherlock that Jenny's story, then, as far as he knew it. Apparently Jenny had been in town to do some local travel destination features in a newspaper from Cardiff. She was doing some reports on small towns in the English country side and that the only person he'd seen talk to her much was officer Carter, who had often taken her to local landmarks and generally showed her around town. “I remember Carter told me she'd called to schedule a cab before the storm broke... I guess it never arrived. I'm sorry... that's all I know.”
John and Sherlock sat there, breathing heavily as the shock of the moment passed and they waited for their adrenaline to simmer down.
shoves him against the door. He practically chokes the man with his tongue as he kisses him. His visitor melts in his arms, groaning at Sherlock’s enthusiasm.
John’s face falls and the anger is immediately seeped out of him and plummets like a stone through what now feels like a deep black hole in the pit of his stomach, which, incidentally, now feels like it’s been punched. “Oh.” He says, “Oh.” John feels like a moron now. He’d come to apologize to Sherlock for being a bad friend, and here he was again, assuming the worst of him. ‘I’m such an arsehole,’ he thinks, ‘Fuck, and I should be happy for him. This is what I told him to chase after, didn’t I?’ He notices that the silence between them has grown a little uncomfortable. He should say something, “Oh, right well. Um, that’s, er. That’s good then,” he stammers stupidly, “Ehm, good for you.”
“Of the body, you're a medical man,” Sherlock said, taking the umbrella with one hand and handing him the torch with the other. He gestured for John to investigate, handing back the keys for John to put them back. He also gave John another pair of latex gloves.
“Shut-up.” Finally, standing up straight, Sherlock takes mercy on Molly and gives Iris a light pinch on the shoulder, “Let go of her, you tart. Sorry about her Molly - she’s a shameless harlot.”
He nods his head and swivels it around in a wide circle from one shoulder to the other in a stretch, feeling the bones in his neck relax. He sits on the ground breathing deeply and finally lays back so that his whole body is splayed on the floor. He allows his body a moment of rest as his mind goes back to the case. He truly loved Irene for this. She had been right, this isn’t an easy mystery to solve. It’s an absolute marvel of a puzzle. Everyone in this godforsaken business has a secret, making their investigation so much more difficult to solve. They’ve been working the case for months now and they’re no closer to a clear suspect than they were in the beginning, but they have uncovered a variety of fun or useful little pieces of information that may help them in the future. Irene is particularly good at sorting through the scandals, deciding on which they might need to use later and when. There are many dead ends to sort through as well, but well, at least now Sherlock is decidedly not bored. He grins and inwardly thanks his clever friend for giving him the chance to work on this with her. Being able to use his dancing skill set for the purposes of a case was a bit of a secret dream for him - a truth that he had only ever admitted to Janine when he’d tried to befriend her at John’s wedding (ugh). Thoughts of John rise to his mind again, at the reminder of Janine and distract him from thinking about any details of the case. He tugs at his hair in frustration and growls. That bit of emotional baggage was probably what was slowing him down.
“Hm?” Sherlock asks, distracted by Rosie’s babbling, “Oh, Yes, that. It’s in the bedroom. Irene’s using it as a sort-of make-shift beauty table or something. May have to get a new one.”
John gave him an a soft smile and explained, “Look, I don't care if someone wants me to wear a funny outfit. Its their special day, not mine.”
“No!... It's just... you asked if I had enemies and... well we've had a huge fight and I've been staying at Dimock's for a while, the whole village knows about it... But I don't think she did it! She would never! Why would she?”
“Yeah, they won't call you, they won't bother you, they'll pretend they've never even met you. You can't beat that.” Greg answered.
“Always?” Sherlock inhales after asking the question, turning his head slightly towards the man to give him a questioning glance.
Sherlock positively vibrated in glee, “Hmm, I've been asked that latter question so many times that sometimes I wonder, but as for your former statement, yes, I did. It's an experiment, you see, I'd like to find out how you bear with your week without every second of your life mapped out. By the way, my dear Doctor Watson I believe it is
John felt it then, the warmth in his chest as his balls tightened just as Sherlock pulled him forward and kissed into his mouth painfully and messily, “John I'm close, I'm so
“Hmm?” Sherlock answered quietly as he stood, flicking the wet strands of his hair away from his face.
Mary smiled at him sweetly and pulled him in for a hug, “That-a-boy. Alright, don't you worry about it anymore, do you hear me? No one reads that stupid section anyhow, right?” She asked as she let go and opened the door of her office to let him out.
Mycroft did his best to look composed and sniffed, “Yes, well. You're alright now, I can see.” He gestured for the nurse to leave as he began heading towards the door, then and turning to give John a meaningful look he said, “We'll leave you to it then. But remember what we discussed. If you hurt him, Dr. Watson, I
was Sherlock Holmes' story. It seemed like the more he talked to him them more complicated the man seemed to get. John wondered where that previous boyfriend fit in all this... but there was no time to ask that now, since
Irene glares at him but Sherlock just gestures towards the mirror above the mantel. Irene stands on Sherlock’s chair to get a better view of herself in it, growls in frustration and stomps to the bedroom —presumably to retrieve her necklace. Lestrade turns back to Molly with an appropriately amused look which she returns.
“You haven't found the right guy...” John continued, (a raised eyebrow from Sherlock.) “You're afraid you never will...”
“What things?” John asked, “What few things pan out, exactly?” He felt his teeth grinding and tried his best not to seem upset in front of his mother. Harry was saved from answering him, though as her phone began to ring. She stood quickly and rushed to tear it out of her bag, a huge grin on her face as she saw the called ID. “Mary!” She mouthed and ran into the other room to answer.
Mrs. Laurinston's Gardens. Eh?? Anyone? Anyone? I'm so funny. No I know I'm not shhh. I think there are other easter eggs from the sherlock but i don't remember them. I didn't proof read this XD
Sherlock looks back at him after wiping away some spaghetti sauce from Rosie’s cheek, “What do you want to know?”
“I never brought them in the bedroom.” Sherlock repeats, this time clear enough to be understood by human beings.
“If I didn't know you so well, brother dear,” Came Mycroft's voice from behind him, “I'd say we should be expecting a happy announcement by the end of the week.”
Sherlock looks so sad, his panting breaths barely evident. Finally, the audience explodes into cheering and he seems to shake himself free. He stands and his partner runs back out from behind the beads to join him by the hostess’ side. Sherlock now has a broad grin on his face and so does Iris. John can’t help but feel like he’s seen that grin somewhere before, but he can’t place it. He watches as the show hostess speaks to the judges, asking their opinions on Sherlock’s performance.
Sherlock’s eyes sparkle with mirth as John rolls his eyes and gets on his knees as well. They take turns twirling and dipping her around the room, neither man unable to hold back a grin.
Sherlock ruffles her hair, chuckling,  “Alright, well, I’m sure spaghetti can be arranged.” His eyes are bright when he looks up at John and it fills John’s heart with warmth to see him look so happy. He feels his own expression change to match Sherlock’s as he looks back at him. Sherlock lowers his eyes shyly just as Angelo arrives with their menus, a bottle of wine and a juice box.
Sherlock nods, and clears his throat uncomfortably, “yes, well, Molly is stronger than she looks,” Sherlock mumbles, and then adds, slightly more cheerfully, “Besides they get along swimmingly. If Irene weren’t already committed and Molly weren’t so caught up in being monogamous I’m sure they’d elope. You should see them. It’s mildly entertaining.”
“John, we are hydroplaning, you must let go of me and regain control of the vehicle!” Sherlock instructed in slight panic.
I'm not sure if you've figured out Irene's text from the previous chapter. I won't reveal the answer just yet, as I plan on having her reveal it later on in the story to someone else, but congrats to those of you that have bothered to even try or who already figured it out. It's not really that important anyway XD
again as John changes his dance from innocent to something that he doesn’t realize looks borderline sinful for those that can actually see him.
Sherlock laughs at her sudden outburst and cleans her face where she’s somehow managed to get spaghetti sauce on it, “I did promise you that didn’t I?”
With that John and Rosie exit and allow Sherlock to change and get himself rightly sorted. Once they leave Sherlock takes a moment to eat a few more bites of the meal John had prepared before rising out of bed and getting changed. He’d fallen asleep with a dress shirt and trousers and they were now decidedly quite rumpled. As he sorts through his shirt drawer for something comfortable he recalls something else he’d stuffed in a drawer. Sherlock’s brow wrinkles at the boldness of the brunet from last night. The note he’d left stabbed to Sherlock’s bedroom door had been hastily crumpled by Sherlock when he’d found it there before he left for Sherringford. He had resolutely stuffed into the drawer of his bedside table with a huff. ‘“Good luck with John,” indeed’ he thinks as he removes his dress mshirt. ‘As if there is even a chance.’ Sherlock rolls his eyes and pulls a t-shirt on over his head and changes into pyjama bottoms. He picks up a piece of left over bacon, stuffs it in his mouth angrily and grabs his now mostly empty tray of food to bring to the kitchen. ‘Stupid perceptive brunet. Stupid perceptive sister. Stupid John. Can’t believe I had to ask the idiot to stay. Of course I want you to stay, moron.’ If there was any truth in this world it was that, that Sherlock would always want John to stay. N
Irene speaks next as the video cuts to them sitting in 221b, “Yes, I was dangerously close to dragging you to a girl’s spa day yesterday,”
John glares at him and pounds a fist on the table a little more forcefully than he thought he would. “I know he isn’t your neighbor Sherlock,” he mutters darkly.
The hostess moves down the line to two other judges, both female, whom both say similar things, clapping proudly. When the hostess reaches the last host, a more severe looking man… John thinks he had at some point read that he was called Craig, or something like that? – ‘Craig’ stands and claps.
John shakes his head at him and finally separates himself from his detective. "You've a filthy mouth, you know that?" He says, slapping Sherlock softly on the knee as he gets up to remove his condom and moves towards the door to go grab a rag from the bathroom with which to clean them both up. "Be right back." He whispers.
Irene’s evil grin spreads across her face, “I see you decided to breed,” she says, tilting her head in John’s direction.
Greg hears a semi-familiar theme song with trumpets that he vaguely recognizes as one of those pop celebrity reality TV shows his ex-wife seemed to enjoy so much emanating from the device. He rolls his eyes and pushes the phone away from himself.
“Oh brilliant idea Johnny!” He exclaimed, seeing the flower in John's hands, “You've certainly saved the day, here, pin it on me, why don't you?” Len smiled as he bent down on one knee and allowed John to remove the pocket square and replaced it by pinning the pink flower onto the pocket, the stem, tulle and leaves covering right over the stain.
let alone The Sherlock Holmes (as John was so fond of saying jokingly) else could misinterpret anything Dorian is saying. “Well then,” Sherlock responds, “I suppose turnabout is fair play. I’ll have to get to know you too.”
“I see, thank you Mrs. Laurinston,” DI Carter had slurred after the old woman finished her story, “Look, Dimock, I'm not sure I'm in the right head for this. I'm going to sit back with Mrs. L, if that's okay with you, besides, you've got Scotland Yard here to help.”
But Sherlock isn’t listening – he is not having any of this shit anymore. He loves John Watson but he will no longer allow John to blame him for any of the stupid conclusions that his silly little brain comes up with. No, Sherlock Holmes is not going to put up with this. He is livid, “–Really, John?” Sherlock continues, speaking rapidly, “I’m the one making a scene? You start looking at our waiter as if you’re going to kill him the minute he speaks to me with an ounce of familiarity, making me have to go through the trouble of removing him from our presence before you smash your fist into his face (or whatever it is you were tempted to do just then) and when I return you start questioning me about it as if I have done something wrong? No, Doctor Watson, I rather think if anyone here is causing a scene it isn’t me who’s doing it.”
They were downstairs awaiting their breakfast at the little Inn's adjoining diner a few minutes later, both shyly sipping their coffee and attempting not to stare at each other too much, lest the other notice. The waitress came by in a moment and laid down their plates, asking pleasantly, “Anything else for you?”
Algernon and Jack give each other amused grins. “Guess you’re stuck with us old boy,” Algernon comments to John, squeezing his shoulder. He pulls John along with him as the three of them follow Dorian, Sherlock and Gladys to stand at opposing ends of the designated ‘battleground.’
