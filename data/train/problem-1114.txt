When he was done he hesitated in the hallway, glancing between John’s room and the guest room. Since Molly was no longer using the spare bedroom he didn’t have to sleep in John’s room. Of course, that didn’t mean he didn’t
"Yes, tomorrow…okay…yes, you too…but I-…fine, I love you too…yes, goodbye…bye"  He ended the call and sighed tiredly, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands.
After whatever barrier that had caused them to pause broke, the pair of them bolted towards each other, exhaustion forgotten as John ducked under the police tape that sectioned the area off and Sherlock's blanket slipped off his shoulders.
"I love you..." Sherlock said again, this time unable to keep emotion from gripping his throat and making his voice shake.
"Your shampoo" Sherlock replied simply, as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. A common theme with the detective.
The call was suddenly ended and screen switched back to the image of Eurus. She looked a mixture of intrigued and pleased with herself as she peered at her brother’s fallen expression, “Fascinating” She breathed, tilting her head and watching Sherlock’s eyes dart about the screen as if there was some small piece of John left on the tv that he could recover with just a look.
“No! Don’t hang up! Do not hang up!” Sherlock raised his voice, reaching out towards the screen as if he could touch John, could encircle him in his arms and whisper a thousand ‘Sorrys’ and ‘I love yous’ until the pain went away for good.
The call ended and the screen was replaced with Eurus again, an inquisitive smile on her face as she peered at her brother,
John’s eyebrows raised, slightly taken aback. Of the few times Sherlock had visited the home John had shared with Mary, he’d given off the impression that he disliked the place; usually deigning to stand instead of sit on one of the chairs or engrossing himself in his phone for the whole time. The one time he had sat down in the living room was brief and he only perched a little awkwardly on the edge. John had once caught his face curling into a thinly veiled look of resentment at a photo of him, Mary and Rosie on their sofa not long after she was born. He had brushed it off as a buried sense of hatred for Mary after being shot by her and was quick to distract the detective, finding relief in the way his face had cleared once the picture was pushed out of mind. Still, in his current state, John wasn’t in any place to deny Sherlock much of anything, so he nodded with a small smile.
"I don’t think this is okay," John said breathlessly between giggles and Sherlock shook his head, lost to his own laughter. Rosie had rolled onto her stomach and was attempting to push herself up onto her hands and knees, a large smile on her face as she watched the two men laugh. John eventually found the strength to stand and plucked his daughter from her mat, tossing her into the air briefly just to hear her excited giggles. He kissed her cheek and settled her on his hip, ribs still aching from his previous laughter.
Sherlock shifted, resisting the urge to wring his hands when he caught sight of the steadily decreasing time. He watched it in horror for a moment, the reality of the situation suddenly picking through the rush of adrenaline that had spurred him on since the first ring of the phone. “Why? Of course you can, it’s not like-” he swallowed hard, “It’s not like it means anything” He said, hoping the tremor in his voice wasn’t noticeable. He still didn’t believe that John could ever love him back – ‘Not gay’, ’Not a couple’, ‘Not his date’ – even if he was gay, no one would want have to deal with Sherlock’s constant demands and the danger that seemed to follow him wherever he went. Even John wouldn’t want that forever.
“Saved him?” Eurus asked incredulously, the ghost of laughter dancing through her words, “From what?”
"Okay, I’m just gonna get changed and check on Rosie, yeah?" John said and Sherlock nodded against the pillow, withdrawing a hand from beneath the bed cover and waving it dismissively before it dropped onto the pillow beside his face.
John smirked, "Good. You’ll need the lie-in because the wee devil upstairs won’t go easy on us tonight," he said and chuckled at Sherlock’s groan, "We’ll take turns and I’m not above kicking you out of bed if you won’t get up on your turn" he nudged Sherlock, who’s face had warmed again at the sheer domesticity of their conversation.
"I've been waiting for this one" she said, her voice conveying her anticipation as she watched her brothers warily enter the room, "I feel it'll be the most....interesting, of all my tests"
Coming back out of his Mind Palace with a mixture of emotions, Sherlock ducked under the police tape and spotted John leaning against his car a few meters away. He was staring at his shoes with his hands fidgeting in his jacket pockets.
"Clearly" Greg said with raised eyebrows. His hands slowly moved from where they had come to rest on Sherlock’s shoulders and he glanced out across the expanse of field, "He’ll probably be on the outskirts of the crime scene, we can’t let him in, obviously, but if you’re all clear then I reckon he’ll be waiting for you"
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something indignant when a high pitched cry rang through the house. John groaned and dropped his head onto Sherlock’s chest, the sharp point of his collarbones pressing into his forehead, "That has to be a record"
"What do you reckon she’ll be like when she’s a bit older?" Sherlock suddenly asked and when John looked up at him, he too was watching the children with a veiled fondness in his eyes. His adoration for Rosie had come as a bit of a surprise to John, a pleasant one at that. The first time he’d held Rosie was the same day she had been born. Mary had fallen asleep and John called Sherlock in as the detective hadn’t been allowed in the room during the birthing process. John had handed the tiny baby over to Sherlock, who’d held her with such care he may have been convinced she was made of glass. She was still slightly pink and she’d scrunched up her nose before settling against Sherlock’s chest, falling asleep almost immediately. John would forever believe he had seen Sherlock hold his breath when the baby cuddled into him and he would be lying if he didn’t feel overjoyed at the whole experience. It was almost like an initiation and Sherlock had passed with flying colours.
Rosie was surprisingly obedient when John dressed her. It could be the good night's sleep or the abundance of affection she’d received that day, perhaps even a mixture of both. Either way, her joy was contagious and once she was dressed warmly, John kissed her forehead and picked her up off the changing table.
"Alright, let’s get you home then, hm?" John said standing and pulling Sherlock to his feet along with him. His legs buzzed with pins and needles and his head swam slightly, the quick recession of his fear and anxiety leaving him with something akin to vertigo. Sherlock seemed a little worse off than him as he stumbled and gripped John’s shoulders for balance. It hurt to see the usually cool and composed detective so vulnerable and clumsy, but John swallowed the lump that rose in his throat and instead guided Sherlock over to his car.
Sherlock, sharp as he was, read his glance and shook his head minutely, "I know what you meant…" he said softly, "And I understand now, not fully, but-…I get why you acted the way you did. I was foolish back then and…" Sherlock bit his lip and his eyes shone with tears as he swallowed thickly, "I doubted you"
John felt a deep ache bloom in his chest at Sherlock’s tone (trying to be hopeful, but ultimately weak) and he squeezed his hand as he tried to come up with a reassuring response. The slightly forlorn look on Sherlock’s face felt like being crushed under a heavy weight, "Then perhaps…it was a blessing in disguise"
John smiled, "Me too" he whispered, searching Sherlock’s face and finding only contentment in the soft expression. He swallowed thickly before speaking again, now just above a whisper, "You said this morning that you meant it when you told me you loved me"
"Are you two gonna tell me what happened now?" Molly asked, glancing between the two men and pausing her ministrations on Sherlock’s still ice cold hand. "You were really frantic when I came to watch Rosie" she settled her gaze on John and noted the minute flush of his cheeks. He sighed and shifted positions slightly, maintaining a respectable distance from Sherlock whilst still remaining a comforting presence.
Sherlock clenched and unclenched his fists. He wanted to answer back. He wanted to scream and shout and tell Eurus to shut up. To leave him alone and let him curl up by himself for the rest of his days because he couldn’t do it anymore. He couldn’t take the pain anymore and he wanted out. Out of this cursed facility or the world in general, he wasn’t yet sure. The world just kept turning too fast for him to keep up and he was getting dizzy and sick on the idea that he had hurt John and he just wanted it all to stop.
John dragged a hand across his face like he knew Sherlock had flinched and he sighed heavily, exhaustion colouring his entire demeanour. There were unshed tears in his eyes and his breathing was sharp and stilted through the staticky receiver.
Sherlock's breath hitched and his eyes widened as he saw John on the sofa, relaxed, with his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles, Rosie cradled in his arms.
"Very good, Sherlock" Eurus' smile had grown predatory in the time it took for Sherlock to come to his conclusion and she reached for her remote. She pressed a button and one of the screens flickered before showing John's living room in his house.
“Sherlock, breathe” Mycroft whispered beside him, and Sherlock realized he had been holding his breath. He exhaled shakily and held the gun out for Mycroft to take, which he did silently.
John emerged from his room, having likely finished putting Rosie to bed while Sherlock was in the bathroom, with his pyjamas draped over an arm. He smiled at Sherlock and jerked his head in the direction of his room, "I forgot to tell you earlier that one of your brother’s lackeys dropped off some of your clothes and stuff while you were half asleep. It should be in the box in my room" he said, gently squeezing Sherlock’s arm as he passed on his way to the bathroom. His hand left Sherlock’s skin buzzing and he had to suppress a shudder until the doctor had shut the bathroom door behind him.
"Oh, he’s here. I came to fetch you so he could take you home but…I wasn’t sure if you were all finished up here" Greg explained and glanced back into the empty ambulance. Sherlock huffed a bit through his nose, indignation filling the void where he had once felt fear and anger and simply nothing as he stood abruptly. The world immediately spun on it’s axis and he stumbled, shoes squeaking on the wet grass. "Hey, hey, easy, Sunshine" Greg had leapt up alongside Sherlock and gently held the disoriented detective until the fields stopped whirling around him like a tornado.
Sherlock looked at the soft sheets inside the wooden coffin, 'Someone who loves you'. The Woman flashed briefly in his memory before he dismissed it, she was on the other side of the world at the moment, it would be impossible. Molly's name floated to the forefront of his mind, dangling on a bit of string and bobbing tauntingly before his minds eye, but no, it was a little too wide for her, and her name drifted back to it's little filing cabinet.
John laughed, though there was no humour behind it, cold and disquieted, "You fucking cock" he was smiling now, though not his usual smile. No, this one was angry, tilted and tight, concealing the storm behind ocean eyes as the waves crashed and winds howled, "Why should I? Give me one reason and I'll say it"
"It was years ago. She’s back in Sherrinford now so…" Sherlock trailed off and his gaze slid from the window to his and John’s entwined hands. He moved his own so that he could gently trace his thumb over the thin lines of John’s plans before speaking again. "He was my only friend…apparently I was so traumatised at the time that I ‘re-wrote’ my memories into thinking I had a dog instead. Redbeard." His lips quirked up slightly at the mention of his (imaginary) dog, "And when Eurus was sent away I gradually forgot about her. Until recently."
“And look what you did to yourself” Eurus didn’t show any signs of stopping until Sherlock was reduced to a shivering heap on the cold, cell floor. She wanted to break him. And she was succeeding. “All those complicated little emotions, I lost count”
Sherlock's only reply was incoherent mumbles through the heavy sobs that wracked his body and John reluctantly pulled back to give the detective room to breathe.
"Yes, but you can’t just say that and expect everything to be okay again. Two years, Sherlock. If you had just told me none of this would have happened" Even as he said it, John knew he couldn’t and wouldn’t change much about their current situation. His eyes trailed guilty over to where Rosie was still lying across her mat with one of the toys she’d pulled from its string hugged to her chest.
He remembered waking up in a cell, the governor killing himself and the three men hanging from ropes. He remembered John, the phone call, the 'I love yous' and him threatening to kill himself. Redbeard-...no...Victor. Victor in the well and Eurus in her blackened and charred bedroom.
Sherlock wandered out of the kitchen and into the living room while John went about making another two cups of tea. He took extra care into making the drinks and he knew he was stalling, though did nothing remedy it. Once the drinks were finished, he carefully trailed into the living room and gently set the mugs on the coffee table.
Mycroft shot a troubled look at his brother as Eurus' lips curved into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Sherlock tried not to think of the similarities between that and Moriarty's dead eye smile.
"You’re just going to-" Sherlock grunted as he rolled over, switching their places so that he now lay on top of John, "make me go out there- Christ! Your hands are like vices! -and not follow me- let go!" Laughter coloured Sherlock’s words as he tried to pry John’s hands from where they’d interlocked around him.
John shifted on the sofa and lifted his phone away from his ear to look at it, his throat working as he swallowed and regarded his phone with a hurt face.
to sleep with John. That night had been one of the best nights sleep he’d ever had; the gentle huff of John’s breathing and his comforting warmth had lulled him into a sense of security. It had helped immensely after the day at Sherrinford (he still shivered at the mere thought of the place) and he wasn’t quite ready to be alone.
Red and blue lights flashed across the walls as the cacophony of noise rose to it's peak and all Sherlock could bring himself to do was drop his head back down. He closed his eyes, and let out a half sigh, half sob as his aching limbs throbbed painfully.
"I'm not going all the way to Baker Street just to hand you your phone. You're using it now aren't you?" He said, his voice tight and slightly thick from disuse. He was irritated.
Sherlock's brow furrowed as he walked into the cold, damp room. The harsh winds from outside were sweeping into the room through a large vent in the ceiling, directly above the neat, polished coffin, sitting innocently on a metal table. The lid was on one end of the room, propped up against the wall and with the front facing away from the two brothers. There was a large TV screen on the opposite side of the room, mounted on the wall and identical to the one to it's right.
When they opened the door to John’s house, they were greeted by a very concerned, very tired Molly. She was dressed in her pyjamas under a thick dressing gown and her hair was tied in a loose plait that hung over her shoulder.
"Yeah, course" He said, opening the car door and watching Sherlock gingerly sink into the seat before closing it again.
"Don’t worry about it, John, I’ll live" He said, and John waited until he heard the detective slide under the duvet before turning back around. Sherlock looked impossibly small all alone in the bed and his eyes were already closed, fatigue drawing lines in his face as he buried himself further under the duvet.
“Now, pull yourself together” Eurus sat back with an air of finality and Sherlock wanted cry because she had finally stopped. She must think he is suitably broken by now. “I need you at peak efficiency, the next task is no going to be this easy”
When they pulled away for air, John kissed Sherlock's nose and the duo laughed softly, blinking back more oncoming tears in favour of embracing each other and savouring this moment. This beautiful, broken moment that encapsulated their entire relationship up until this point.
“Okay, okay. I’ll call one more time” She said, sounding almost disappointed as she called John again. Sherlock swallowed the bile crawling up his throat and his eyes trailed to Rosie in John’s arms. She was wearing the little, knitted onesie Mrs Hudson had made for her and she slept with her mouth slightly open. He longed to hold her close and curl up around her. Keep her safe and warm and happy. She was probably happy right now, but she didn’t know much different, and she certainly didn’t know she could blow up at any second.
He had, shamefully, not thought about John since the phone call, too caught up in the whirlwind that was Eurus' sick games and the prospect of never leaving that cursed prison alive. But he was alive, a bit shaken up and probably harbouring more emotional damage than he had the energy to process, but he was alive.
"She didn’t- you don’t think that-" Sherlock groaned in frustration and buried his face in his hands. John watched him patiently, waiting for him to find the words and knowing that this wasn’t exactly his forte. Hell, it was hardly his speciality either. "When I told you that I-…that I love you, I meant it," Sherlock said after a deep breath, "You told me to give you a reason to say it and I gave you one. It’s true." He was still avoiding John’s gaze and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees.
"Why did you say I was busy?" John asked, trying to conceal the grin he could feel pulling at his lips at Sherlock’s faintly pink cheeks.
"I’m fine" Sherlock snapped once the ground was once again solid under his feet, bristling like a harassed peacock.
The sky was moderately clear with a few snowy white clouds drifting lazily in the chilly breeze and blocking out the sun occasionally. John had Rosie in her carrier and she had her head tilted back towards the sky, staring at the shapeless fluffs that coiled in the endless blue with fascination. Sherlock walked beside them and had to bite his lip to stop the chuckles that threatened to bubble out of his throat, finding the image of Rosie looking at clouds open-mouthed and wide-eyed extremely amusing. John was grinning too, unable to wipe it from his face as he continued to walk down the street with his two favourite people in the whole world.
John shook his head, "No, Sherlock, you need a proper nights sleep and a bed is the best way to get it" he said, but Sherlock’s frown only deepened and he opened his mouth to reply when Molly interrupted.
John pulled back and looked into the cool eyes that had gripped tightly onto his heart and hadn't let go since that fateful day at Bart's hospital.
"How are you doing?" Greg asked, settling beside Sherlock and watching him. He wasn’t expectant, though he looked at the detective with thinly veiled concern.
"Whatever you say," He said lightly, turning and leaning against the counter, "Do you need me to come with you tomorrow?"
John bristled an held his phone away from ear to look at it, frowning as if it had grown a pair of eyes and was staring back at him accusingly. He raised his second hand and his thumb hovered over the end-call button, “Not now”
"Mycroft will probably send a car, but I think we agreed on 3 pm," He said, hoisting himself back onto the counter again and crossing his ankles.
Under normal circumstances, Sherlock would sneer at being looked at in that way in any capacity, but right now he could understand it; he wasn't entirely sure what he looked like but he knew it was far from his usual self. Besides, it's not like he had the strength nor willpower to tell Greg to stop.
Rosie had gotten fussy on the way home and was squirming in Sherlock’s arms, having been handed over to him halfway there when she’d started thumping at her father's chest. She whined irritably as Sherlock tried to hush her with gentle kisses to her cheeks and forehead, though she soon began to angle her head away and push at his chin.
His heart ached as he reread those three simple, yet somehow terrifying, words. The words he’s thought to himself when his eyes caught John’s own ocean blues from across the room. Words he whispered into darkness when he was alone and John was safely away and asleep. Words he could never bring himself to say, even if the moment felt right. They’d clog in his throat and jostle and jumble around into something entirely different by the time they’d reached his tongue and fell past his lips. If John felt any small amount of what Sherlock felt for him, then he would not wish to force his friend to say it as though it meant nothing.
He owed John an explanation. More than that. He owed years of unsaid words and sorrys that Sherlock's pride had cruelly withheld from his best friend. An explanation first, though, he'll get to the rest later, right now, he needed to find John and fucking talk to him.
“Because it’s true!” John snapped and Sherlock flinched, memories of a cold morgue and angry fists briefly clouding his already foggy mind before he blinked them back. He didn’t mean it; he hadn't been thinking straight. He wouldn’t do it again.
The next cell was much like the two before it. Cold metal walls with scuffs and dents marring each of them, a tv mounted on the wall to the door’s right. This time, instead of there being a large window looking out to the sea, there was a coffin in the middle of the room, propped up on two apparatuses with its lid taken off, exposing the fresh, white linen that lined the wooden coffin; ready to be used. The lid was leaning against the far-left wall, opposite the tv, with the front facing away from the room. A large vent above the coffin whistled over the static from the tv as the harsh winds from outside swept into the room and ruffled the soft fabric inside the coffin. It made the cell colder than the ones preceding it and Sherlock clutched his gun in both hands.
Mycroft’s face twisted into something close to sympathetic and Sherlock turned back to the tv screen to avoid the unfamiliar expression on his brother’s face. He didn’t need any pity, especially not from his brother, it did nothing to aid him and would only make him feel less capable to save his friend.
It was messy and desperate and probably not the best in full perspective, but to them it was perfect; a moment of pure clarity between them as years of pent up frustration and anger washed away like sea foam drying up on the shore. It was triumphant in a way, and, if you asked either of them, they wouldn't trade it for a thing.
Heavy footsteps thundered up the stairs and Eurus’ grip tightened even more. Sherlock wanted to comfort her, to tell her it would be alright, even though he knew he would be lying, but his mouth would not cooperate; his tongue a dead weight behind his teeth. The door swung open and the room was filled with noise. Too much noise. Sherlock’s ears rang and he vaguely registered his sister being tugged from his loose grasp, her hands untangling from his coat like cat claws in a blanket. Someone pulled him to his feet and said something along the lines of ‘Easy, lad’ in a low, gruff voice he couldn’t recognise when he swayed dangerously far to the side. He was guided back down the stairs of his first childhood home, the walls and floor bubbling and swirling like lava slopping down the side of a volcano. The sparrows that decorated the wallpaper convulsed and  wriggled in his peripheral as though trying to burst through the paper. He closed his eyes.
"Hi, John!" Molly’s voice crackled over the line, her voice far too cheerful for this time of night. "Sorry for calling so late, I couldn’t find a spare moment. I’m just checking in to see if everything’s alright?"
"C’mon" John said once the door to the guest bedroom had clicked shut, holding out a hand for Sherlock to take, which he did after a moments hesitation. It didn’t register in John’s mind that he had held hands with Sherlock all the way up to the bathroom, where he left the detective with instructions to clean up before bed, until he was rummaging through a drawer in his room for some pyjamas that might fit the lanky detective. It gave him pause and that familiar fluttering feeling filled his chest at the ghost of Sherlock’s cool palm against his own. Shuddering a little, John found an oversized jumper his sister had given to him one Christmas that should fit Sherlock comfortably enough and went about finding some pants to go with it.
A hand gripped his shoulder and Sherlock realized he had been teetering precariously on his own feet, the nausea being very real and very disorienting. He was going to be sick. Mycroft held him upright without saying a word, just keeping Sherlock on his feet while he sent a venomous look to his sister.
"I think we’ll be alright, and you have a shift at Bart’s later, don’t you?" John tore his eyes away from his happily eating daughter to see Molly nod reluctantly.
Sherlock looked up from where he had been staring at his hands, cradled in his lap, and straight into the eyes of Greg Lestrade, "Hey, Sunshine, John's looking for you, you should go to him if you're not too roughed up, he was in borderline hysterics when I left him" the DI said, looking at Sherlock as though the detective may shatter at any second.
John felt the blood drain from his face and he stopped walking, Sherlock coming to stop beside him, "I-I just meant…well I wasn’t sure if you’d…want this, y’know?" He almost immediately regretted his words as Sherlock’s eyebrows raised in disbelief, "I mean- I want you to know you have a choice in this"
They met halfway and didn't think to pause as they embraced each other, stumbling from the force with which they had collided and almost toppling over before they regained their balance.
"We all went out after you left, so she missed her nap and got into a bit of a tizzy. She’s still up now but I think she’ll fall asleep soon" He said, stifling a yawn that both Rosie and Sherlock caught. John grinned.
Sherlock shifted his weight, resisting the urge to wring his hands as the timer ticked by too fast - too fast. Not enough time. Need more time. Need to save John. Rosie. John and Rosie. Oh fuck, oh god -, "Why? Of course you can it's not-" Sherlock swallowed, "It's not like it means anything"
Sherlock had set Rosie down on her mat with the toys dangling over her head. She giggled and raised her arms to bat at the colourful, plastic animals above her while Sherlock sat tentatively on the sofa. John joined him a moment later and they found themselves in that familiar charged silence that only seemed to encapsulate them. It was rare that their silences ever penetrated anyone nearby, even if they appeared aware of it's presence, and even more so Rosie, who continued to be blissfully unaware of the thick tension between the other two in the room.
Something about the sight of his best friend made Sherlock stop in his tracks, unable to move further or tear his gaze away from the man a small distance away. The events that took place at Sherrinford over the phone flashed before his eyes and he wondered if John was angry at him. It wouldn’t be the first time and he couldn’t blame him. He’d left him out again and put him and Rosie in danger in the process. Sherlock chewed on his bottom lip and took a tiny step back, but it was too late. John had looked up and their eyes met almost immediately.
Tears welled up in John’s eyes and smiled up at his best friend, the man he loved. "Of course I’ll let you. She deserves you in her life" He said, voice a bit wobbly, and he ducked his head slightly to blink back tears. If Sherlock’s eyes were slightly shiny when he looked back up, neither mentioned it and they kept walking.
"Oh Christ, good luck with that. It’s Sherlock’s first all-nighter with her isn’t it?" Molly chuckled and John snuck a peek at a virtually unconscious Sherlock.
John almost choked on his coffee when he inhaled sharply, forcing him to quickly swallow it properly and clear his throat before he spat it out all over Rosie. Sherlock didn’t react and continued to blindly stare out the window with his coffee cup clasped between his hands.
Sherlock looked up when he entered and offered a very small, weak smile. John set the tray on the coffee table and sat on the other side of Sherlock.
"The formula would be great right about now," Sherlock said over the beginning hiccups of an oncoming crying fit and John hid his smile by hurriedly dipping into the kitchen. It was a little funny to see Sherlock struggling to get a good grip on Rosie and making a face when she wailed a little too loudly in his ear. His daughter’s cries had only gotten louder as John impatiently waited for the microwave to finish heating up her formula, Sherlock’s gentle coos almost entirely drowned out in the noise.
"Unfortunately. But you’re sure you’ll be fine?" She asked again, this time glancing over at Sherlock, who had been silently listening to the conversation.
Sherlock frowned, his head tilting to side slightly as he tried to pick out the meaning behind those trembling words. “No, I…why can’t-”
"Cheeky little minx" John teased and kissed the laugh from Sherlock’s lips before he left to tend to his daughter.
"Meant what?" John asked gently, his face still mere inches from Sherlock's as he tenderly tucked a wayward curl behind the detective's ear.
"Good. Now eat your food, you’ve barely touched it" John said, leaning back and nudging Sherlock’s plate closer to him, ignoring the eye roll it caused.
“What words? Sherlock, I’m really not in the mood” John sagged into the sofa and stared blankly ahead. It was so unlike John’s usual demeanour that Sherlock felt something clench in his chest. His heart, probably, it seems he did have one after all.
The café, as Sherlock had promised, was nice. Tiny and quaint with rustic decor and warm, dim lights. It smelt strongly of coffee and pastries and the pleasant murmur of voices added to the homey feel.
The doctor gently shook Sherlock’s arm, "Sherlock" he prompted, trying to catch his eye, "Talk to me, Sherlock, tell me where you want to go or we’ll be here forever"
“It doesn’t work like that, Sherlock” He said quietly and he started to shake his leg irritably. Sherlock’s bottom lip trembled, and he knew John was right and that this was cruel, but one glance at the timer made him bite his lip to keep it still and avert his gaze back to John’s hunched image on the sofa.
"Nothing you should be concerned with" Molly replied, smiling at Sherlock when he shot her a suspicious glare as he went about getting Rosie’s formula.
"Mycroft didn’t think it was a good idea to tell you and I was already too exhausted from Moriarty’s games to argue with him" Sherlock continued, angrily swiping at his eyes that had begun to tear up again. They could both clearly remember those last adrenaline-fuelled days leading up to the fall. They were both on edge and tired from both the lack of sleep and the mental strain the endless stream of mind games Moriarty laid out for them.
Sherlock’s heart picked up its already quickened pace, beating like a rabbit’s in the jaws of a fox, “No! No, John, please! This is important-”
"I wanna tell you what happened last night, but I’m honestly not entirely sure of the specifics," John said suddenly and Molly looked at him with slightly raised eyebrows.
The evening passed in a blur of takeaway and baby toys. Rosie had woken up halfway through their meal and was settled in a circle of her toys. Sherlock and John alternated between being sprawled out on the sofa and sitting beside Rosie to play with her. It had gotten dark outside and the little girl had yet to show signs of sleepiness, seemingly content to play way past her normal bedtime despite both her father and godfather fighting sleep.
Sherlock froze and John felt panic surge through his veins. He made to pull away, cursing himself for overstepping a boundary, when a cool hand cupped the back of his head and tugged him back in.
“His home is rigged to explode in approximately three minutes, unless I hear the release code from his lips.” Eurus continued; the enjoyment she was getting out of these tests evident in her voice. Sherlock rounded the coffin again to stand in front of the tv screen, staring in abject horror at the image of John so relaxed and unaware of the danger he was in. His sister’s words hadn’t even processed in his mind until he realized he didn’t know the release code. “I’m calling him on your phone, Sherlock. Make him say it” Eurus’ words came through the intercom and Sherlock looked up towards the camera in the corner, pointing straight towards the coffin.
"Sherlock?" Molly brushed past John and he walked further into the house, slipping into the kitchen whilst Molly spoke in a soft tone to a marginally unresponsive Sherlock. John went about making tea, the motions a comforting routine he’d learned from a young age. While he waited for the teas to steep, he quickly headed upstairs to check on Rosie and, finding her sound asleep in her cot, poked his head into the living room.  Sherlock was leaned back in the sofa with Molly beside him, murmuring softly to him and rubbing one of his hands between her own. Lips twitching fondly, John ducked back into the kitchen and finished making the teas, taking a deep breath to calm his still racing heart before taking the tray of mugs into the living room.
John's face inexplicably darkened and his jaw tightened. He took a deep breath and began picking at a loose thread on the wool blanket draped over the back of the sofa, his hand shaking. "You're a right bastard, you know that?" He said, his voice dangerously quiet as he viciously tugged the thread loose, looping it around his fingers, tying knots and forming shapes, "I'm gonna go, talk to me when y-"
"Good. Did you change her?" He asked, watching Sherlock shake the bottle with practised ease as he nodded with a hummed affirmative. John raised his eyebrows, but Sherlock didn’t seem to take notice as he handed to bottle to John and sat down at the kitchen table. Molly placed his mug in front of him and he took a few long, appreciative gulps of the beverage before putting it back down and wiping his mouth with his sleeve.
This was it, his last chance, there was no point hiding it anymore. All these years, all this time spent pining and hurting and grasping at what little affection he could was all coming to a close.
It wasn’t long before Regents Park was in sight and they passed through the wrought iron gates onto the worn path that snaked between stretches of half-dead grass. With the swift approach of spring, the once yellowing and dry grass was returning to its former green glory as it often was in the summer. Very few parents with their children had decided to have a picnic on such a cool day, but there were still a couple dotted across some of the grassy areas. Their children ran through the tiny gathering of trees not too far from where their parents had set up and they ducked and weaved in an attempt to hide from one another. A tiny dog that would probably barely reach halfway up John’s shins was skittering around the children, it’s excited yaps mingling with the high pitched giggles and squeals.
If you had told Sherlock 5 years ago that he would actually appreciate a shock blanket, he would've laughed and slammed the door in your face. Yet, here he was, sitting on the step to the back of an ambulance with the bright orange blanket draped over his hunched shoulders.
"It's true, Sherlock" John repeated, his voice quieter now; defeated, "It's true and it's always been true from the very first time I met you"
"I know" Sherlock interrupted, and this time John did look at him, finding his face solemn as he dipped his head to give his goddaughter better access to his hair. "I know we have to talk, but I just-…" he sighed and trailed off, but John understood. They both knew that whatever the outcome of their conversation would be, their relationship would change. Whether it be noticeably or not, it didn’t matter, the change was inevitable and neither was sure if they were ready.
"Now, pull yourself together, I need you fully alert for the next task. Don't keep me waiting" Eurus said with an air of finality before the screen went dark once again and the brothers were finally alone in the room.
John laughed, though there was no humour behind it. It was far from his usual sunny laughter that bubbled out of him after a witty remark from Sherlock or whenever Rosie smiled or giggled at him. No, this was a cold and disquieted laugh that spoke of years of trauma left undealt with in a dusty box in the corner of his mind. “You fucking arse” He said, and Sherlock nodded minutely even though John couldn’t see him. John was smiling now, as he was known to do when he was extremely angry or frustrated. It wasn’t a happy smile by any means and it forced Sherlock to suppress a shudder. The waves raging in the howling winds outside of the cell were reflected in John’s eyes that had lost some of the vibrant ocean blue they’d had during the early years of their friendship.
“Coffin. Problem; someone is about to die. It will be, as I understand it, a tragedy” She continued, bottom lip sticking out slightly in a faux pout. Sherlock adjusted his grip on the gun. “So many days not lived, so many words unsaid, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera-”
A smile slowly spread on Molly’s face and she rose from he seat to start making tea for when Sherlock inevitably came downstairs. Her amusement was contagious, it seemed, as John felt his own grin forming on his face and he settled back into his chair, listening to the soft noises upstairs.
Sherlock suddenly retracted his hand as if burnt and sniffed loudly, wiping at his eyes with his sleeve, "Sorry. I didn’t mean to ruin your day. It was supposed to be a nice break, but now I’ve just-"
This time when the phone began ringing again, John visibly sighed a shifted carefully so as not to disturb Rosie. He lifted his legs from the coffee table and rose to his feet and, for one horrible second, Sherlock thought he might leave to escape the incessant ringing. But John leaned down and picked up his phone, answering the call as he left to the room to put Rosie in her bed.
The screen momentarily filled with an image of Moriarty as he made the tick tock sounds of a clock again and Sherlock huffed a small sigh through his nose, “John, please repeat these words for me” the screen switched back to the angles of John’s living room and Sherlock took a deep breath before continuing on, “I love you”
"Oh, he’s absolutely smitten" John agreed, chuckling along with Molly as footsteps padded from Rosie’s room to the stairs.
"She’s not allowed any of this yet, is she?" Sherlock asked as he sat opposite John, shrugging his coat off of his shoulders and letting it pool around him on the seat.
When they arrived home, the sky had darkened slightly and the clouds were tinted pink by the slowly setting sun. It sent warm light pooling into the living room and onto the soft rug under the coffee table, where the two cups of tea John had forgotten about still sat side by side.
"Yes, I suppose that would make sense...." He mumbled, moving toward his brother and flipping the lid over so that the front faced them.
The phone began ringing again and John visibly sighed, standing with Rosie still in his arms and, for a moment, for one terrible and horrifying moment, Sherlock thought he was going to go upstairs to escape his insistent phone. But, John picked the phone up and his brow furrowed when he saw Sherlock's contact name. The detective could practically see the different possibilities of why Sherlock was calling John running through the doctor's head as he left the room to take Rosie upstairs.
John exhaled through his teeth and switched position again, planting his feet on the carpet to ground himself and shaking his leg irritably, "Why? Why are you doing this, Sherlock? I can't. You know I can't" He hissed, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees, perhaps to still his leg.
John had to blink a couple of times before he could respond, "The usual place?" Sherlock nodded, "Sure" he shrugged and waited for Sherlock to disappear through the door before he let out a shaky sigh. John could swear the bugger kept doing that on purpose.
John has never seen Sherlock loose control like this. Never seen the man properly weep with such hopeless abandon and he wished to never see it again. He vowed, that day, that he would never allow Sherlock to reach a point such as this ever again, for as long as he should live. He made it as he pressed his forehead to Sherlock's and closed his eyes, listening to the soft hiccoughs of his first love over the hum of voices and staticky radios.
They sat in companionable silence for a while, drinking their teas and listening to the quiet sounds of the morning, where the world outside began to stir into wakefulness. It was odd to think that London could be so tranquil, however short-lived it may be and it was one of the things John loved about the place.
"Now this task is fairly simple, but no less fun I assure you" Eurus said, pressing another button and the screen flickered again before the image split into four squares. Three were all different angles of John's living room, and one was a timer, frozen at 3:00. "I have set up John's living room with bombs and they will go off when the timer gets to zero. Your task, is to get your dear little friend to say the code words that will stop the timer and diffuse the bombs" Eurus explained, studying her brother's reactions like she was watching a particularly interesting soap opera.
“…What?” was all Sherlock managed to say once the images had faded and he heard Mycroft’s breath hitch behind him.
"I think we both know how much I care for Watson," Sherlock said, his face relaxing into something more neutral, "If I didn’t want to be a part of her life I wouldn’t be here today. So long as you’ll let me I will always be there for both of you"
John rubbed gentle circles into Sherlock’s back, but didn’t speak, just rocked them slowly and let the detective cry for the first time in god knows how long. He wasn’t sure what Sherlock was apologising for and he didn’t doubt that the man himself probably had no idea either, but he knew they would have to talk about it (about everything) and apologies could only go so far at mending what had become of their relationship. At some point he hushed Sherlock’s continuous apologies with a soft "Ssh" and waited for the quiet sobs to lessen into sniffles and hitched breaths. "Got it all out now?" He asked and pulled away from the embrace, watching Sherlock nod and wipe his nose and eyes with his sleeve. They sat there as Sherlock composed himself and John gently took one of his hands into his own, stroking his thumb across the back and feeling the bumps of the delicate bones beneath thin skin.
"Yeah, okay, I think this one needs it" She conceded, gently patting Sherlock’s hand and smiling at the very small huff that could have been laughter from the detective.
The inside of the coffin was filled with soft linen, snowy white and freshly cleaned, ready to be used.
Sherlock straightened at that, staring at John with a perplexed expression, "But I said I was sorry" He said, his voice rising into a question as if he couldn’t quite remember if he actually had.
He struggled to think of anyone else. All of the obvious options that matched the profile had been marked off. All except…
John sighed, "I think so, but not so much about last night…" he chewed on his lip thoughtfully. "Obviously, I’m a bit peeved that you left me out of the loop" Sherlock shifted uncomfortably beside him and he resisted the urge to reach for him, "But the phone call was out of your control…I didn’t realise at the time that…well…I knew something was off about it, not that your raving lunatic of a sister was putting you up to it-"
"Thought so" Greg smiled weakly before falling silent, the comforting warmth of his presence keeping Sherlock grounded in the wake of Eurus’ destruction. Closing his eyes again, Sherlock could see the splintered foundations of his Mind Palace, the thick fog that rolled through the hallways, the room dedicated to subjects and people all left in disarray. All but one.
Eurus remained indifferent, "All the more reason to get this right" her eyebrows twitched upward into a deceivingly open expression.
Suddenly, the two screens burst to life, both showing the same image of their sister, Eurus, with a wicked glint in her eyes and her head tilted ever so slightly to the side.
Silence was left in her wake, broken only by Rosie’s suckles as she finished her breakfast. Regardless, it lay thick on the two remaining in the kitchen and they avoided each other’s eyes. The air prickled with the charged energy they both kept withheld from the other and John wished he could be as obliviously happy as his daughter. She finished her formula and John dropped the bottle into the sink so that he could adjust her to half lean over his shoulder. He stole a glance over at Sherlock and found him watching them with the ghost of a smile on his face.
John sighed and quietly slipped into his daughter’s room, leaning over the bars of her cot to press a featherlight kiss to her forehead. She stirred slightly and one tiny hand curled into a loose fist, trying to grab at her father with little success. She settled back down and John smiled. The love he had for Rosie sometimes surprised him and he knew he wanted give her as good a life as he could possibly manage. He had partially abandoned her after Mary’s death, but now he found it hard to part himself from his little girl.
Rosie had just finished her formula when Sherlock’s phone rang and she scrunched up her face at the sudden noise. Sensing the impending doom, Sherlock grabbed the empty bottle and his phone and disappeared into the kitchen to take the call. John watched him go, a tiny hiccup from Rosie being the only thing that broke him from his daze and prompted him to go upstairs to settle her into bed. She went down surprisingly easy, having tired herself out from her tantrum and the long day outside. John pressed a kiss to her forehead and tucked one of her stuffed animals closer to her before shutting the curtains and silently exiting the room.
"Yeah, well…he had a proper cry while we were there, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him that upset before" John took another sip of his tea and grimaced when he found it to be cold. He opened his mouth to continue when they heard a thin, high pitched wail from upstairs. They both glanced at the door and made a move to get up to tend to Rosie when the gentle thump of feet crossed the landing upstairs and a low, soothing voice cooed to the whimpering baby. John looked over at Molly, who shared the same look of bemusement as Sherlock’s muffled voice carried over the tiny cries of John’s daughter.
The effect was almost immediate as John softened and the fire that had been coursing through his veins extinguished as quickly as it had lit. The ever-burning flame in his chest, however, only dulled to a tiny flicker, forever a memory of the white-hot fury he’d felt that night Sherlock had shown up at The Landmark.
"Where’s John?" His voice was still hoarse and quiet, his jaw aching from being clenched for so long.
"Not a chance," He said, attempting to wriggle out from under John, who curled his arms around the detective’s waist. "Oh- you bastard, let go!"
Then there was Molly. She seemed to fit the description; practical about death, unmarried, 5’5. But there was something that didn’t quite match up properly, like a puzzle piece that’s been bent or damaged in some way, so that it no longer slots into its designated spot.
"Oh, come now, Sherlock, use that wonderful mind of yours and figure it out" She said, encouraging but with sinister undertones that sent shivers trembling up Sherlock's spine.
Sherlock was beginning to shake all over now. ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, just SHUT. UP.’
The dial up sound echoed in the room and Sherlock could hear John's phone ringing through the TV speakers.
After a while of weaving through police officers and paramedics, Sherlock found John at the sidelines of the crime scene, his hands buried in his coat pockets and his jaw clenched. He was looking around, probably for Sherlock, with his mouth pressed into a thin line and his brow furrowed into a worried expression that drew deep lines into his skin.
John’s raised his eyebrows, but didn’t speak, waiting silently for Sherlock to continue, which he did after a moment of trying to compose himself.
John’s heart fluttered and he placed a hand on Sherlock’s back, rubbing it in a soothing circle, "I know, I didn’t mean it in that way" he reassured and felt the taut muscles in Sherlock’s back loosen a little. "Though, I was going to say that I think I’m still a bit angry with you about the fall"
Sherlock was ordering their food and drinks while John looked for a table. He found a small booth in a more secluded corner that offered privacy and he slid onto one side. He carefully undid Rosie’s carrier once he was settled and pulled her out, disturbing her from the light doze she had been in since they left Regent’s Park. He set the carrier beside him and settled his daughter on his lap, where she leaned into his chest and drifted off into sleep.
The bedroom was as they’d left it; the bed still unmade with the duvet folded to one side, the jumper Sherlock had borrowed folded on the pillow, the wardrobe door slightly ajar and John’s phone perched on the bedside table. The only difference was the cardboard box by the side of the bed Sherlock had slept in that night. Opening it revealed his pyjamas folded on top of his dressing gown that hid the rest of his clothes; enough to last at least two weeks. He smiled slightly and quickly changed into his pyjamas, hooking his dressing gown on the back of the door and relishing in the worn softness of his bedclothes.
"One week!" Lestrade placed his fist over his desk, startling Donovan, "one week and you have what? Nothing. I'm calling him, Sergeant Donovan, and for the last time, I don't want you to bother him, I don't want you to call him freak, either..." he paused. The woman in front opened big eyes. "I'm sorry... it's just..." his voice softened, "there must be something we're missing..."
government?" Mycroft made a circular motion with the umbrella in his hand. Armand smirked, a confident little smile playing at his lips and it made Mycroft frown, surprised.
They talked about Mycroft and Rosie; she asked about the case and rambled a bit about a website she had found about creams and homoeopathic products.
From the good view they had, and the dark, which now had an important role aiming on their behalf, they saw how from in between the people, a petite, blonde woman emerged and eyed her surroundings. When she saw there was nobody at sight, she took a phone from her pocket and talked for less than a minute. Behind her, about seven young girls, five with dark skin and two with light skin, were tied up with ropes around their wrists. They were wearing very fancy clothes. It was a contradictory view, but soon Sherlock realised how logical it was.
And then Sherlock was on the roof again, throwing his phone and then there was a man knocking him off against the hard, cold floor. And then Sherlock was there again, twiddling an ashtray in front of him, a huge grin on the detective's face.
Once away he felt himself craving for a coffee. Nicotine patches long gone since early this morning. He got closer to a little cart and almost bought two cups, out of habit.
. He hid his face on his left bicep next to his head and closed his lips tightly when he felt an unintentional moan coming up. His hand slid up to his chest, his mind supplying the needed fuel as he remembered John touching the same spots earlier.
John stretched a bit in his chair and took a large breath of air. He eyed around the place, coming out from the trance of typing his emotions down. He knew he had been typing like mad.
He stared at the cold dark liquid in his cup for several minutes. He noticed that his hand was trembling for the way the liquid moved inside there. He was feeling something very close to rage... combined with the still lingering betrayal sensation.
, John thought immediately about the strawberry pills and chocolates –, and his laptop, he sat back on his chair.
"If you rather do that than speaking directly to me... though I doubt it would suffice now..." he sighed loudly, "I'm sure you're aware of what happened before I came here. I can't reach to conclusions but I can be almost certain that I'm wanted dead."
"It's clean, and the supplies are new, maybe waiting for a new boat..." Sherlock sat over a folded net and waited for John. "I need your phone."
So he grabbed Sherlock’s hand and walked them to the bathroom. Sherlock followed obediently and silently. As soon as the door was closed he pressed Sherlock against it and, with a hand on Sherlock’s nape, moved his face back against his neck. After a second or two of hesitation, Sherlock followed and attacked the spot like a starving man.
It was a simple yet recurrent fantasy of his during that time, yet now it rested in a carefully labelled drawer. Under seven locks (seven, why seven? Always seven).
“The label of the spa just said lemon and ginger, why does it have grass?” John said with a frown, serving rice on three plates and spreading beans on top of each.
"Lestrade." Sherlock turned to look at him and stopped his walking, John stopping next to him, as lost as Lestrade was. "If you really can't see where this is going then my help is nothing but futile. As long as you obstinately work for my brother, this investigation will end in nothing, as the Netherlands' one. Even if you find the responsible of this black market or the drug's market, it is going to lead and end in nothing." Sherlock turned and kept on walking, Lestrade tilted his head, processing the detective's words. He turned and looked at the force surrounding the facility, suddenly not trusting anyone around him. Suddenly all of them were strangers and, as he watched John and Sherlock walk away, he wanted to reach for them, asking them not to leave him all alone.
Sherlock frowned at this and John cleared his throat. They both snickered and Sherlock asked, “Are there any special products for these… services?”
God, he loved the man. He let himself be lead, Sherlock was right; Sherlock could do anything to him and he would never say no. Sherlock was right to be afraid. But John allowed himself do it because he trusted Sherlock with his life, and he knew it was the other way around.
“It’s utterly bizarre how she took a liking to you,” Sherlock sighed as a greeting, dramatic, “It’s going to be years and years and I will never get used to that.” He walked back to the living room to take Rosie’s phone and checked the pictures. “Psychologically, big noses usually create the sense of trust, interesting facts you find on the internet.”
There was an experiment he thought about last night, and for that, he needed to be... unaccompanied.
Now she was seeing a whole new side of John Watson's personality. He was actually able to switch his mood in a quick manner and most importantly, he was capable of laughing like
Phillip laughed, his almost bold head shinning with the faint lights of the office. "Come on, Mycroft... you're better than that!" Mycroft's disgusted expression was deeper now, his discomfort was clear, "you know how even the most minimal non important detail can be transformed into a very powerful tool. I tell you this as a friend." The man in front of Mycroft took his phone from his pocket. "Would you mind if I make a call?"
“This morning she confessed what happened in New York years ago. She wasn’t the guilty one but she participated with Abby Slaney and was an accomplice, so maybe they’re going to leave her in prison.”
John snorted, Sherlock giggled. They locked stares and laughed shortly. Sherlock's attention came back to the paper in front.
“It’s okay, Miss Hanson, don’t you worry!” Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at Mrs Hudson’s thought of changing her name to Rosie’s attempt to her last name. “Are you alright?”
"Okay then, let me have a look at it." John moved as if to walk out of the kitchen and Sherlock walked in front, to the living room area, sitting in the sofa.
If someone had told Sherlock that someday there would be a possibility of him getting off with John in the same room, he would have laughed aloud for days. Of course, they had flirted, before. Loads of times, even before
But Sherlock was already taking his phone, coat and scarf. “Mycroft is coming in an hour,” he said as he hurried for the stairs. John was still trying to make sense of it all when he heard Sherlock stopping for a moment in the foyer downstairs so he rushed before losing sight of him. Sherlock was rapidly throwing his dressing gown over Mrs Hudson’s chair and replacing it with his coat.
Mycroft could almost recreate the complete scene of Sherlock's attack in his mind in a nanosecond. Sherlock just stood there, completely aware of what his brother was doing.
Forgetting completely about Lestrade, who didn't say a thing to disturb them, John moved some curls out of the detective's forehead. Lestrade noticed the gesture, it held a brotherly sentiment behind, it was very familiar, as if John did it often. He found himself smiling at the scene in front. He had never seen John being this nice with anyone, and certainly had never seen Sherlock being so obedient with anybody.
. It was too late to go back, now. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and seemed to scan his face for a couple of seconds, searching for something John couldn’t grasp and then, as if making a great decision, he stood up from his chair and muttered:
"Urgh..." Sherlock tilted his head quickly and moaned again, clenching his eyes. As he was now completely awake, his mind began to work in a very rapid way, even with the headache that didn't want to leave him alone. John shook his head, he could almost hear Sherlock's mind working and mentally he pictured the scene of a rocket launch.
, Rosie hitting his eyes with her little fist. This was almost two years ago. He smiled as he bizarrely remembered Sherlock’s contemplative face when Sir Elton started to talk about his adopted kid.
“Y’know, Sherlock,” John sighed. He grabbed the much larger hand on his and just held it. Sherlock let him. “I’m going to massage your scars tonight. I’m going to grab that bloody lotion and you’re going to let me because even if it’s for my selfish self I will do it because I need it to be alright with myself, with you. You might be alright with me but I’m not and I know that now. I’ll…”
"I hope so, Mrs. Hudson..." Mycroft said, placing his umbrella next to the mantelpiece, his smile widened as he spotted John lifting himself up from the sofa, the doctor was evidently annoyed at the sudden visit. "Hello, John."
"Right." John made them tea and again, there it was: the comfortable silence. It was only disturbed by the noise of the news’ channel. There was a reporter with a very anxious voice, throwing away the news about a minor earthquake in South America.
“Duly noted,” it was still a weird sight Mycroft opening his palm to grab a much smaller one. Rosie walked from Sherlock to take Mycroft’s hand as John took Rosie’s nappy bag and the three of them walked downstairs, making one of the uncanniest pictures Sherlock had ever seen in his life.
It wasn’t a lie. He hadn’t but then, how could he possibly explain his own excitement? Had he ever felt shaken in the presence of another man the way he had been with Sherlock? It was tough to admit to himself how this time and all of the massages before hadn’t even been the first time he had been in such a state because of his friend.
"You're clueless when dealing with emotions, aren't you, Sherlock... emotions are for you like the solar system; you know the basic chemistry, the basic body functions, we talked about the pituitary gland..." He squeezed the fingers between his and Sherlock turned around slowly to look at him, "you were fine with the teasing but now, Sherlock..." John made a pause and turned to the window.
"You don't have to." John placed his hand over Sherlock's thigh and squeezed. "Don't do that... Sherlock. Please."
Carefully, he entered the flat and the first thing he saw... John, sitting on the large couch, looking out of the window.
The car that had picked him up had stopped in an underground parking lot. A chuckle that sounded quite sad to Armand's ears resonated in the place. It was dark and he could only see a silhouette in the shadows. And he was standing there, at lost; he wanted to get closer to the man in the dark, but he was a bit terrified. The male voice had told him to talk to Sherlock, to make him withdraw from the case and to convince his friend Xavier to
at me and told me to… have a good time,” John snorted and continued, remembering. “There was also a box in her office with small packages that at first I thought were oil samples, but now that I think about it, I think…”
As soon as he blinked a couple of times, his brain came back to reality completely. He felt the soreness of his body and his arm going limp as he removed it from its trapped position. He moved his ankles as well and he was surprised how even his toes hurt. He was panting lightly too.
He moved a finger outside his entrance the same way Sherlock had done it, the tip of his finger entered a little and he clenched his teeth, it wasn't so bad, the soap and the water were helping a lot to do this smoothly.
The older Holmes let out a soft chuckle. Armand frowned at that. This man in front displayed an emotional jumble; not even
"Nnno." John smiled wider at the answer. This kind of intimacy felt extremely odd but extremely good. "Did you like it though...?"
There was silence where Sherlock didn’t know what was really going on, but going by John’s silhouette and the light coming from his hand...
"People do little else." Was Sherlock's repeated reply. They remembered that time at the pool and they both smiled, looking at each other.
Sherlock smiled, it was a tiny smile but John saw it clearly. He also saw Sherlock standing up, slowly moving his feet from the table to the floor, he walked to John, two, three steps until he was standing next to him. John didn't let his eyes move away from Sherlock's face for a while and then he deliberately moved his gaze along Sherlock's body, his eyes stopped at Sherlock's hand, now moving to cup John's face and sliding behind his neck.
"Yes!" Sherlock exclaimed as he went to take a rope. As soon as she saw the knot Sherlock was making she waved exasperatedly and left.
She smiled, all teeth. “I know, all I’m saying is that you leave Rosie with me if you ever need some privacy.” And she winked.
“Oh, my God, yes.” Her tone was tired. She stretched her back. “How often do you get massages for that?”
"Oh Armand..." Mycroft said with a condescending smile, "idealistic people can't go too far. But I'll give you credit for that..." he added, nodding lightly.
"Check it, then." Sherlock stood quickly and paced with long steps to his laptop, just when he was about to open it, Sherlock's phone went off with the message ringtone.
"Well you are..." John stopped as Sherlock opened one eye and glared up, he couldn't help a smug smile "...sometimes."
"Sherlock, if you want a massage so badly, you just have to ask for it, really." John turned to face him and gave a short headshake, "Now I am really worried, you might have something serious, the crack sound was awful last time. I'm not joking here... set aside your loud cry."
"Are you-? Wait, why are we even talking about this..." John tried to sound curious and cool there, almost defiantly.
"What happened to your date?" Sherlock inquired, there was no surprise in his voice, no expression evident whatsoever. John felt naked, as if his mind was an open book, right there on the table so Sherlock could read it at will.
John snorted at the comment. Really, now he could see how silly this situation was. He ran a hand through his hair and stretched his neck, letting out a soft groan.
"There is a tray... cakes and sandwiches..." she said talking in a very hushed voice, "I also brought milk because I didn't know if you had any. If you need anything else, let me know dear..." she added with a smile, walking to Mycroft who held the bags to her reach and then she quickly walked to the door.
It was new, this. To be almost caught in an intimate position. John and Sherlock shared a look, both of them breathing a bit heavily through their noses, both had a weird expression between seriousness and a smile, surprised at their action.
Sherlock's expression changed quickly from sleepy to confused noticing the position they were. John watched attentive every move of his companion above, how his eyes were wide open and the expression of total perplexity on his face, he saw how his eyes clenched shut for a couple of seconds and frowned. He moved the arm that was beneath John and the cushions to the side of John's face, supporting himself further away from the doctor, like noticing he was almost crashing on top of him, his right fisted hand making little pressure on the doctor's chest. The movement was very fast, and finally he lowered his gaze to the man beneath, like seeking for an explanation.
“Yes. Hold this for a moment,” he said as he took John’s hand and placed Martin’s wrist into it like you would do with an object before disappearing into the kitchen. There was some noise of cutlery and then Sherlock came back with three clear slides and purple nitrile gloves.
"One last time." He told himself as the rage was slowly subsiding, the feeling passing by self compassion, then to realisation, finally to resignation. He cried himself to sleep.
He tried the table first, his nose inches from where he and John had been the morning before. He waited for a few moments trying very hard not to think about yesterday’s activities. He sat down and thought about the chemical components of aloe, of possible products he could make with a leaf and calculating quantities and components.
“Green slide is honey and ginger.” John nostrils flared as if smelling the scent. It was fragrant in the air. “Odd pattern. Did you write them down?”
The flat remained silent as she walked downstairs. Sherlock heard a click on her door and lifted himself quickly, walked to the door and locked it without a sound. John was still in the kitchen placing the contents of the tray inside the fridge.
The doctor tossed on the couch. The tranquillity of the flat still disturbed him, making him to fall into a slumber slowly, his mind battled between the comical situations today with Sherlock and Lestrade and all of the dreadful case involving the hot line. He had been wondering about Armand the whole day, since in the morning the young man had walked out the flat with firm steps, like he knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing next. He had turned to John before leaving and had shook his hand, with a firm pressure, not saying a word, but the mid frown on his features and the secure smirk on his lips had spoken by themselves.
John smirked and looked down at his empty plate. “So, we stick to the plan and see what happens? Are you going to tell me all of it now or…”
Maybe unconsciously, John adopted the same posture Sherlock had; his laptop was now balancing on his knees, his palms together and his fingertips below his chin. Sherlock lifted an eyebrow to him. John observed him carefully, his mind was running at a speed he didn't know it had.
"It's an order sergeant, don't make me repeat myself." Sergeant Donovan nodded with a frown. "And Donovan!" Lestrade called, as she turned to look at him, he added "Tell the men to keep an eye out until those two reach the city." He said lifting his chin to the direction Sherlock and John had taken.
"If I answer him now... will he remember later?" Lestrade asked. He had this big grin on his face as he watched the-always-composed Sherlock being in such an awkward state.
His lips clenched and his frown went down but soon his expression changed, his lips curved in a smile, he bit the lower one childishly and his eyes smiled. "We're doing it."
If Sherlock’s sigh was a bit shaky nobody acknowledged it. “Aloe speeds up cellular regeneration and my scars have been there for years, so... you’ll probably need a lot more than just aloe to get rid of them.”
Sherlock lifted his forehead from John's shoulder and gave a little step further, his chest was against John's back now. His chin was right next to John's temple.
Armand returned the smile and turned his back to the doctor, getting closer to the sleeping figure. The detective's neck was tilted to a side in a very odd position. John observed, with a little of discomfort - he had to admit - how the young man moved the shoulder of his flatmate. Again, the touching was oddly familiar and, he had to admit it again: he
His brain was still processing, he knew what he was going to find inside the room, so it wasn’t really a surprise when he saw Sidney Eldridge pouring liquid after liquid onto the bed. Chloe was deeply asleep, obviously sedated and naked below the sheets.
"Sherlock..." John's glance travelled to the cabbie's rear-view mirror; the old man at the wheel had a little knowing smile, eyeing them from time to time "...no wonder why people talk, mate." The doctor whispered. Sherlock's lip just curved quickly in response.
