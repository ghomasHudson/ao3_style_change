Tony watched as Fury started shouting. He sat back when Dean added his two cents. He observed Natasha and Clint have a silent exchange and come to some sort of telepathic agreement. He folded his arms across his chest when Rhodey told Sam Winchester flat out that he was a nutjob.
Tony grinned. “Really? I didn’t know that.” He leaned back against the trunk of a large tree. “So anyway, things started changing for me. I found out that having the crazy in my house was actually a crap-load of fun most of the time, apart from pissing Bruce off, but that goes without saying.”
Steve lay on his side, watching Bucky. He’d not opened his eyes, but Steve could see the slow movement of his chest so he wasn’t freaking out.
“In this case, it’s a two birds, one stone sort of deal.” Natasha’s gaze moved to Tony. He thought his testicles were trying to crawl up into his body and out the other side. “Stark.”
Captain Obvious.”
“He did.” Bucky’s voice was very soft. “Even before he started with this crap, he’d saved me.”
“And kick your ass.” Rhodey's comment broke the tension and they all laughed a little. Even Bucky's mouth curled in a tiny smile.
“A small matter of protection from our absent daddy dearest,” Crowley snarled.
“He never talked about you.” Rhodes put his cup down and leaned back in his chair. “He talked about the others. Natasha, Barton, Banner, even poor, crazy Wanda. But never about you.”
Clint, Natasha and Steve looked at each other. “I guess we’re going to find ourselves a Hulk,” Clint said.
tongue.
What?
I hope you will forgive me.
Steve didn’t think he could feel any worse. Apparently he could. “Natasha has been working with your scientists. Bucky has been conscious for about half an hour at a time twice now, and the B.A.R.F. technology has maintained control both times.”
Tony stopped thinking.
Matilda chose that moment to let out a shriek of rage. Tony tried to launch himself out of the bed to rush to her rescue. Steve lunged for him, holding him down. “Nope, you stay put, Tony.”
“That would not have worked.” Strange put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Metal and magic do not generally function well together.”
Tony fell off his chair.
“Including interest and death benefits, approximately three million dollars.” The answer was prompt. She’d definitely been digging in her own time.
“Fan fiction?” Bruce looked even more confused.
“And we have the Mind Stone,” Vision reminded them with a little poke to the yellow gem on his forehead. Tony had to grit his teeth at the sweater vest combo he was wearing because fucking Steve Rogers infected everything.
“I went looking for
“Nothing about this is going to be easy,” Steve agreed. “You don’t trust us and quite frankly, since Leipzig, we don’t really trust you.” He ignored Rhodes’ protests. “You all fought us. Yes, maybe we didn’t think everything through, but still, the people we trusted most tried to take us out. And then the RAFT just made it all worse.”
Tony heaved a sigh, secretly delighted. “Fine, Killer Queen, get moving.”
Bucky would be here when he came back.
Steve jerked his head towards Wanda. “She won’t sleep properly unless you do.” Ever since she’d downed them all with her magic, Wanda had watched them all warily, alert for any possible threat to Vision.
Thor opened the cage, holding a hand out to Matilda. “Loki, if it is truly you, then please, let us help you. Your magic has caused damage to our friend and if we can restore you then perhaps we can restore him.”
“There had better not be porn here, Cap. My virginal eyes couldn’t handle it.” Clint grinned at him.
like an arm,” he growled. “That’s because it
,” he narrowed his eyes at Rhodey, “was being a bitch about it.”
And as he walked into the room, seeing his friends, his family, turn to look at him, he thought that maybe, just maybe, he actually was.
“And?” Tony made a rolling motion with his hand to hurry Thor up.
Steve’s gaze sharpened. “Emergency meeting?”
to be broken, because it’s magic doing the actual breaking, it’s reversible.”
“What?” Steve was all business now. “Which ones?”
Peggy was silent now, but Steve could feel her awareness around him, her essence in every molecule of the walls and floors. “Peg. Are you telling me that Matilda isn’t what she seems?”
Loki’s lip turned in a terrible facsimile of his usual sneer. “You cannot force me to tell you.” He sounded as though he hoped they could.
Bruce frowned. “I just…” He glared at Vision. “Why did you change that?”
Rhodey just shook his head. “And to think that the universe has to depend on you to protect it.” Tony flipped him off.
Tony gave an airy wave. “Bonne nuit, mes amis.” He turned to go, Rhodey at his heels. Bruce rested a hand on Tony’s back as they left with Bucky in tow.
“I didn’t,” Rhodey assured him. “But now the coast is clear.”
Sam shrugged. “It’s kinda our thing though, isn’t it?” He looked around at them. “I mean, accomplishing the impossible.”
“Who the fuck are you?” he snarled.
Sam stepped closer to Dean, partly shielding him with his big body. “Don’t threaten us, Billie,” he cautioned. “You’ve seen what happens when you do.”
~o0o~
“Yeah,” Bucky moved back, headed towards the house. “That's what I figured.”
Crowley’s gaze was a crimson consideration as he stared at Steve. “I would offer you half of my kingdom if you just promised to love me,” he said.
“Asgard,” Steve said, nudging Tony’s plate towards him again. “He’s going to collect Vision and Wanda and meet us back at the tower.”
“Rode her hard, put her away wet,” Coulson assured him. The
“I’m sure we can dispense with pleasantries,” Xavier said in his cool British way. “We are all aware of how very little you approve of mutants and superhumans.”
Steve stepped between them. “Tony….” He held his gaze. “Don’t.”
“I’m so fucking sorry, Clint,” Tony said, pushing Clint’s face into his shoulder. It was all he could think to say.
“It’s something we were taught in Basic.” Bucky’s expression didn’t change.
“They’re on their way.” Tony ended the call and turned to face his friends. “T’Challa reckons they’ll be here in a couple of hours.” It was late, the kids were in bed, and they were all in the kitchen enjoying one of Bruce’s special teas. Tony was sure there was something more to the ‘tea’ but teasing Bruce tended to end up with Tony hanging upside down by the foot thanks to the Other Guy.
“What about Jane?” Tony knew how much Thor loved her.
“She’d better show up,” Dean grumbled.
“I thought Hogan was your bodyguard,” Stane said, taking a step to the side. His annoyance was even more visible when Steve just moved in front of him again. He didn’t notice that he was suddenly flanked by two police officers.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied. The pause was like a shout.
Bucky snapped his fingers. “You can play happy house husband later,” he told Steve. “Right now, I’d like to make sure Tony’s first experience with us contains as little pain as possible.”
“You’re totally jealous of my awesome,” he informed her loftily.
Her agreement came in a flash of green, apology stroking at his mind like the tendrils of the old weeping willow back home by the creek.
Tony watched Rhodey twirl on his chair. “Yeah, this is going to get boring fast.”
“Don’t make him choose, Tony.” Bruce took his glasses off. “That’s a very bad idea.”
“Pep?” His voice sounded scratchy, hoarse as though he’d been screaming for days. He turned his head to look at her.
“I hate you and I’m going to get Tasha to kill you with a hair clip,” Tony threatened, body arching up as Steve pressed a second finger in. He had big hands.
Tony didn’t flinch. “I can separate the man from the Asset, Rogers. It took me some time, but I got what you were trying to tell me about him. As the Winter Soldier, he had no choices. He obeyed no matter what. He’s not someone I want in my life.”
“What information?” Tony asked, unsure if could really handle anything more right now.
It struck him suddenly. “I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.”
“That’s…” Steve stopped. “Pretty horrible actually.” What a way to grow up. At least he’d just had to worry about bullies and even then, he’d always had Bucky to take up for him.
“The Accords,” Tony said. “I pushed too hard, too fast, didn’t look at the fine print. Didn’t give you all a chance to have your say before I went ahead with signing. I was stupid. Stubborn. Arrogant. I wanted to save everyone. I didn’t want anybody else to die because I hadn’t done my job.”
Tony mentally rubbed his hands together. “Turns out Hydra loaded his system with gamma radiation on top of explosive nanites that were designed to kill him if he ever went off mission.”
“And…. Go!”
Natasha shrugged in that inscrutable way that drove Steve nuts. “If Thor was the last of his kind then it would be of no matter.” She tipped her head to the side, looking at a visibly uncomfortable Thor. “Your hammer is your totem.” It wasn’t a question.
“If he’s a member or whatever of Set’s little party, then whatever he told me to get Xavier, Richards and I out of there was just a bunch of bullshit,” Tony said.
“I’m going to fix you,” he promised. And he meant it. The voice in his head had become familiar in a way he couldn’t explain.
Steve snorted, kneeling over Bucky and nipping at his belly. “Tony’s right, you’re a menace.”
He scrabbled for the glass of water and chucked half of it down his throat in an effort to banish the monster.
Tony sank to the steps, lifting Steve’s head onto his lap. “Get help,” he ordered Happy.
“Nothing to say?” Tony said eventually, unable to handle silence for too long.
Bucky knelt on the bed, hand still in Tony’s. His gaze slid from Steve to Tony. “I’m thinking we’re a package deal.”
Steve saw his eyes gloss over. So did Tony. “No!” Tony poked a finger in Scott’s chest. “No tears. There have been way too many tears and I’m completely teared out.”
“Tap once for yes and two for no.” Steve’s mouth curled in a very distracting way. It distracted Tony.
She nodded again.
Steve stood outside Tony’s workshop, watching Tony and Bucky.
Steve took a step towards Tony. “All I’m asking is that you give me a chance to regain your trust.” He watched the emotions roiling in Tony’s eyes. “I’m not insisting on forgiveness. I wouldn’t dream of it. But please, let me try to earn your friendship again.”
Rhodes nodded slowly. “No matter what stupid shit he pulled, he was always my brother.”
“Having our Chief Science Officer believing that he is a fictitious Earth-based superhero is
Steve watched Natasha put the new Avengers through their paces.
Before Tony could reply, the elevator dinged again. “That the rest of the team?” Dean asked, looking alarmingly eager.
pushed into him. It was hot and hard and never-ending. Tony lifted his legs, wrapping them once more around Steve’s hips to get him closer, further in.
Tony glared at him. “Anyone ever tell you you’re an asshole?”
“Perhaps Sir should remember who he is talking to,” JARVIS reminded him, censure heavy in his tone. “Captain Rogers is not only a remarkably outstanding physical human specimen; he is also a very good person.”
Steve frowned. “Then surely he’d be willing to help us? He’s going to suffer too.” It made sense if the Collector was going to be affected as well.
They all stared at him, holding their breath. Nothing happened.
“I hate you both,” Tony closed his eyes.
“I’m not going to force you to come back,” Tony assured Bruce. “But I’ll be really happy if you do.”
“He had you too,” Tony said, bringing his arms up eventually and gripping Steve’s forearms as he leaned back against him. “Even though you weren’t there, he always had you.”
Bucky burst into the room. “You two douchenozzles are holding everything up!” He grabbed each of them by the hand. “Move it!”
“You want us to go to Hell?” Dean’s eyes were as wide as Sam’s. “Are you fucking kidding me?”
“Make sure you have condoms and lube,” Natasha suggested with a disturbing leer. “I don’t think that your virginity is going to last the night.”
Bruce shook his head, clearly not believing Tony. “I said I’d think about it.”
“You're Steve,” Barnes said. “I read about you in a museum.” The shadows beneath his eyes were dark and sunken. Fuck, Tony thought. I can’t hate him. He’s just a kid who had basically been mind-raped for decades.
“Go for it,” Steve said.
“Pish,” Tony said, grinning back at him. “And yet….”
Clint looked a little green. “Epic levels of awful,” he agreed.
he say?
“Sorry, J, I shouldn’t have even asked.” Tony watched as thousands of terabytes of data began scrolling across his screens. “This is not good,” he muttered. “This is
Tony met that dizzying gaze. “It’s not exactly a spell.” He didn’t understand why he was blurting things out, but he felt that this weirdo could somehow help.
Steve turned his head to the side so that he could meet Bucky’s lips with his own. “Knew you were awake,” he muttered against Bucky’s mouth. “Knew you’d move your ass eventually. You hate missing out.”
Fury threw his hands up. “Are none of you listening to the crazy here?” he asked.
Fury nodded. “Good job.”
“Uh…” Bruce raised his hand. “No wings for me?”
Tony’s head shot up. “What?” He stared at Loki. “That fast?”
Bucky broke then, arms coming around Tony in a vice-like grip as he returned the kiss. Tony grew light-headed as the kiss went on and on.
“Bruce?” Steve croaked, finally released by Thor. “What’s going on?”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y. get that for me, would you?” he called.
Natasha’s cool gaze met his hot one. “Including HYDRA's.”
easy,” he said. The doors of the elevator slid open at the top floor and they stepped out. He balked. “I don’t know if this is a good idea.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony could see the carefree boy he’d been. The best friends they’d both been. They’d lost so much, the two of them, and yet, looking at them on his bed, teasing laughter lighting up their faces, they were still standing. Metaphorically speaking, Tony thought, mind delving back into the cesspool that was his hindbrain.
“And that’s Tony?” Steve asked.
“The simple life?” Steve looked skeptical.
“Tony then,” Rhodes said.
“Not…!” Tony yelled as Thor and Vision crashed through his ceiling. “Fuck.” They all stepped into the center of the room and looked up at the gaping hole in the roof. “Goddamn, fucking asshole.”
“Something happened,” Bruce mused. “Something so bad that you needed to come back and fix it.” He tapped a finger against his mouth while he thought. “Something involving Steve because that is pretty much all you’ve been talking about since I got here.”
Thor squirmed a little. “He assisted my Jane and I in defeating the evil dark elf Malekith in his desire to rule this world. I thought that he had died in the battle, protecting me. I was prepared to offer a hymn to his courage, but discovered that he had fooled me once more and taken the throne while our father was mourning the loss of our mother.”
“And that means what, Captain Cryptic?” Clint asked. His arms were folded across his chest and his chin jutted out.
“But of course,” Loki's velvet tone was deceptively mild. “Come on in, I've been waiting for you and your friends.” The door slid open.
Thanks for the enthusiasm.
“No.” Bucky sounded very sure. “You need a nest, Hawkeye.”
“He has a really tight circle of friends.” Tony thought about the few times that he’d been around Steve in a social sense.
“You didn’t tell me.”
“Is he…?” Natasha asked, eyes worried as she stepped towards him.
“What?” Steve asked, visibly trying to control his temper. Yeah, things might haven gotten a
Tony blinked. Steve and Bucky were still staring at him. “You said something about two years in the past,” Steve said.
~o0o~
“Who is this JARVIS you speak of, friend Tony?” Thor boomed. “In all the days of our acquaintance, you have not mentioned this name.”
“What are the chances of getting our hands on the Tesseract?” Bruce asked Thor.
Bucky had shoved his nose into the curve of Steve’s neck, mouth half-open against his skin. Steve’s arms were tight around him, holding him as though he was something precious. His lips were relaxed ina half-smile as Bucky’s hand pushed into the hair that was just long enough to curl into Steve’s nape.
“That’s because Nat keeps kissing you,” Rhodey said.
She laughed, leaning against him for a moment. “You miss them,” she said. It wasn’t a question.
“There.” Strange spoke from behind Tony, his voice echoing between the glassy cliffs of the abyss. Tony followed the direction of Strange's finger.
“Whatever.” Tony hunched his shoulders. “He let it go.”
“Or?” Ross was wise to sound doubtful.
“Still doesn’t explain what it does,” Bucky said.
“What about him?” Bucky jutted his jaw in Bruce’s direction. “I thought you went to find him so that he could help me.”
Tony laughed then, a genuine belly-laugh that shocked the entire Assembly into silence. “Damn, I’ve missed you, Doc.”
The crack of thunder had everyone jumping. Thor, Wanda and Vision appeared in the golden stream of the Bifröst. “Friends!” Thor boomed. “We are all together once more! We have vanquished our foes! It is time for revelry!”
“No!” Tony clasped one hand to his chest. “You don’t say? All that cow dung and chicken shit?”
“Matilda,” Steve repeated. “We have to get Matilda.” He headed out of Pepper's office trailing the rest of the team behind him like some sort of kite tail.
“Nope, not psychic,” he whispered back out of the side of his mouth, never taking his eyes off her. “Psychotic, possibly. Psychopathic, there's evidence...” He trailed off when Natasha met his eyes. “Hey Nat, you look gorgeous in your murderous rage.”
The owl guy blinked. “Huh.” He turned away, heading back to some sort of odd machine. “I may have made a minor miscalculation,” he muttered.
“Did you tell
“I have my own dysfunctional band as you well know, Stark. Thanks for the offer, but they’re all yours.”
Steve rubbed a hand over his eyes. “You’re ridiculous.” He sounded incredibly fond.
Steve felt a moment of concern. Wanda was a teammate now. They needed to speak about each other with respect.  Then he looked where Tony was sitting, arms wrapped around his torso like they were the only things holding him together, and wanted to shake the answers out of her.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I swear it’s like looking at two sides of the same demented coin.”
“I was perfectly happy before Bucky came along,” Tony said.
He reached out to cover Bucky’s fingers with his own. They stared at each other over Steve’s shoulder as they moved their hands over Steve’s skin.
“How are you planning on stopping me?” Tony asked. “I’m out here and you’re in there.” He waved a gauntleted hand at the Cage.
She didn’t even flinch, instead smiled a little at him. “I like this one.” Thor declared.
“Hey, F.R.I.D.A.Y. can you scan the area for signs of the other Avengers?” He had a feeling that they'd be around sometime soon. He'd had a head-start but a nine hour nap had probably eaten into that time by a lot.
Thanks for sticking with me through this. I've been so grateful to you all for the comments & kudos. It makes the writing even more fun,
“Alright, this all started because people are fucking scared,” Bucky said. He looked around the table. “We can all do things that normal humans can’t do. I’m guessing, from some of what I’ve heard here, that there were fuck-ups along the way.” Steve winced at the language but held his tongue.
Everybody turned to gape at him.
pleased to meet you.” Yup, Tony thought, flirted like he breathed. Absolutely nothing real about it though.
Steve laughed, it sounded like he was crying. He felt like it. “He never stops,” he said. “Not when it’s important. He just. Doesn’t. Stop.”
Bucky snorted a laugh into Steve’s stomach. “You have quite the hair-trigger, Stevie.”
Steve fell forwards onto the bed, releasing Tony to stop them from doing any damage to each other. Tony still felt the breath rush out of him as he hit the mattress.
Strange folded his hands, clearly trying to pretend to be Confucius or something. “And you’d best get on with that,” he urged.
Tony blinked and that awful blankness was gone. He smiled at Steve, lifted a hand to his cheek. “Yeah, I really do.” He leaned in to press a kiss to Steve’s angry mouth. “I’ll be okay.”
what you got out of it?” He wasn’t going to admit that he had several names for his dick, including Mjolnir. Certain things weren’t meant to be shared.
Steve flinched. “I….”
“They had my back several times, long ago when I was a carnie,” Clint said.
“Yes, it was, Captain.” Fury wasn’t budging. “If the Winter Soldier was brought in by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, what do you suppose would have happened to him?”
, Creepy McCreeperson,” Pepper said. “Get over yourself and go talk to him.”
“Tony,” Bruce said. “Not helpful.”
Tony's brilliant idea goes terribly wrong. But then again, they usually do.
phone started ringing, and Tony couldn’t ignore this one. It was the best-bro version of the Oval Office Red Phone.
Steve paled. “I’m with you…”
“So,” Scott asked. “When do we leave?”
fucking apologize for what those bastards did to you,” Steve snarled.
“Hm.” Tony waved at the nurses and doctors at his door. “Thanks all, I’ve got this covered.” Vision closed the door in their faces. That’s why Viz was his favorite.
Tony felt a little warm. “Yeah,” he nodded. “That’s a good thing.” He hoped that he could help Bruce. That the world would be kinder to him this time around.
Thor chugged his drink. “No matter, it is a good saying.” He offered the plate to Loki, who took one of the sandwiches.
Bruce snorted a laugh at hearing JARVIS swearing. “He doesn’t change,” he noted.
“Well, yeah,” Tony said. “You know, like she talks to you.”
“What for?” Steve looked confused.
“You and Barton would get along like a fucking house on fire.” Tony pulled away from Strange, and peered over the edge. “You sure we need to go down there?” He felt that he was entirely justified in the heebie-jeebies currently running through him.
“Tell me about Cap’s condition,” Tony ordered.
~~~~~~
Zemo started a typical villain shtick, telling them all about why he had brought them here and drooled a little over Steve’s eyes. And then he said, “An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead… forever.”
Things were just getting a little more interesting, with Bucky’s warm hand on his cock and Tony’s fingers in his hair when the sound of a throat clearing broke them apart.
“Anything,” Bruce said, fixing him with a glare. “The Other Guy wouldn’t be happy with you.”
Thor landed and Steve and Bucky were running almost before their feet touched the ground. “Status, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?” Steve called.
“I apologize, sir.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded as mortified as a non-human could possibly sound.
Vision still watched Steve. “Mr. Stark said, and I quote: “That fucking piece of vibranium has taken more from me than anything else ever has. I never want to see it again. You may as well give it back to the bastard.”.” Vision’s words, repeated in an exact replica of Tony’s voice hurt Steve in a way that felt like a small death.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting to speak with you.”
Bucky made jazz hands. “Surprise.” His voice was flat.
Hell and the Cage...Tony isn't quite ready. Lucifer makes his case. There's a double-cross in the wind
“Tony, we wanted to get to you as quickly as possible,” Rhodey explained. “It was convenient.”
There was absolutely no sound once they were surrounded by the trees.
“Why do we need Matilda?” Bruce demanded as he scurried to move up next to Steve. “She's not the problem.”
Tony wanted to tell Thor that it was inter
!” Tony insisted. “If I plan on wooing our Capybara, then I need to be as squeaky clean as I possibly can.”
The doors slid open and Phil Coulson walked in. “Director Fury says that trying to blackmail him will only end in misery.”
I'm getting there, I swear! These boys are playing a long game. Thanks again for all the comments & kudos. It's a blast & I'm loving it.
Bucky lifted his head, mouth wet and lips swollen. He raised an eyebrow. “Okay.”
Tony let his eyes go wide. “Do you think that means that Stargate is real?” He loved winding up the ‘serious’ scientist.
“I got no problem with that.” Rhodey’s chin jutted out.
Tony liked kissing Steve. Sure, up until today he'd figured that at best, Steve tolerated him. However, the past few hours had indicated that perhaps a little more than tolerance was involved.
And just like that, it slipped away, bleeding back into Tony’s body like some terrible metallic slug.
Tony nodded. “He made some noise about a visit. He hasn’t given a shit for two months so I’m guessing he just wants to check up on me. Make sure I’m not drinking myself into an early grave without the distraction of being Iron Man.” He looked at Jim apologetically. “There’s no way he didn’t hear you.”
A guy who looked about Tony’s age moved up beside the weirdly named woman. “Do you know who you are?” he asked. He looked like a cautious owl as he peered at Tony through his spectacles.
“What is it?” Clint asked.
“Oh, you do not get to do that.” Bruce put his hand out. “You are the poster boy for self-destruction, Tony.”
“You didn’t see it,” Bruce said. “It was fucking hilarious.”
Tony thought he was being
“Okay,” Tony said, “Maybe we can work this out together. And then run it past them. They know more about the Infinity Gems than anyone else.”
?” he grumbled.
“Then let us depart this realm and pray that the Collector is near to the Rainbow Bridge and Heimdall.” Thor swung Mjolnir in several quick circles.
know that.”
“That’s the general idea,” Steve agreed.
Tony side-eyed him. “We’re the Avengers, what do you think?”
“Brother, explain yourself.” Thor clearly hadn’t been distracted by their antics as he fixed a glare on Loki’s face.
Tony ignored him, moving quickly towards his car. Another reporter shouted, “Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'.”
“People hate what they don’t understand,” Clint told him, and it sounded so much like what Charles had said earlier that Tony shut up.
Yggdrasil sounded drily amused.
“Nobody knew it wasn't Odin?” Steve asked.
“I will speak with my brother first,” Thor announced with grim determination.
And then they were gone.
Tony flapped a hand. “Can’t talk now. Things to do. Theft to plan.” He crooked a finger at the Asgardians. “Come along, puppies. I need intel.”
A gorgeous brunette stood in front of him, mouth red as the suit she wore and almost too bright to look at. “Are you God?”
“He’s going to hear it one day,” Steve cautioned.
“Don’t leave me again,” Bucky ordered, pushing himself up so that he sat next to Steve and Tony. “I can deal with anything but that.”
That moment came soon enough, everything felt loose and open as Steve’s cock practically touched the inside of Tony’s belly. “Oh.”
“Fucking grandstanding showoff asshole,” Clint declared in mock disgust. “You’ve been waiting for the right moment to make your grand entrance, haven’t you?”
“Mr. Stark asked that you come to his laboratory as soon as you can,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. hedged. “He wishes to introduce you to him.”
“Tony.” Rhodey was laughing as he protested. “It’s not that important.”
There was an ease there, a trust that Steve recognized. A level of closeness that he’d once had with Bucky. Whatever was going on between them, they knew each other well.
“What do you reckon he’s up to?” Rhodey asked as he and Wanda unpacked the food they’d brought from the local diner.
Tony’s gaze went sharp. “Drain the magic, destroy the world?” he asked.
~o0o~
” Skurge noted from behind him.
“Look,” Scott said, “We go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them. Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.” He gave them jazz hands.
Tony felt hunted. Coulson always did this to him. Wore him down like a river on a rock. He was a mountain, goddamit!
“Then what is it you want?” T’Challa’s quiet question had Tony looking at him. “What do you want us to do?”
“Well, listening to the story of what led up to your 'strategic retreat',” the asshole even did air-quotes. Tony
Tony snorted. “Suck-up,” he muttered. Coulson turned that flat, scary stare on him.
“I need a minute,” he rasped, the enormity of what Tony and his team had been dealing with on their own while he and the others had been skulking in Wakanda washing over him in a tidal wave of anguish.
all fight the enemy without, and
“You already have two of those,” Natasha pointed out. Her mouth was curved in a grin. Happy looked good on her, Tony thought.
Tony poked him in the ribs. “And don’t you forget it,” he said.
“As do I,” Thor declared, striding into the living room. He had a plate full of sandwiches and a jug of liquid. Loki trailed after him, clearly wanting to be anywhere but here.
“Tony.” Pepper’s voice was arctic. “If you don’t come out of there I will tell everybody about Budapest.”
He knew his smile was wobbly. “But you hate it.” She tried to pull away from him, but he held on. “Tell me I’m not lying and I’ll drop it.”
Still trying to be voice of reason, Natasha said, “Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.” And she was right. Even though the thought of what he was going to have to do made Tony want to throw up.
” Jörmungandr’s low growl made Tony jump. He’d sort of forgotten that they had other company.
“Too bad,” Steve croaked. “You’re not always the best person to decide what’s good for you.” He wanted to put his hands on Tony. He dug his fingers into the muscles in his own arms instead.
“Again with the not telling.” Tony never wanted to see Strange again. Cryptic and sarcastic were never a good combination.
,” Richards said. “No offense, Stark, but you’re a loose cannon.”
you’re worried about me?” Steve could practically see the scorn on Tony’s face. “That would have meant a lot more if I don’t have the abiding memory of my friend leaving me to die on a floor in a cave in Siberia.”
He took a breath and forced the doors open. Steve crouched on the stairs, shield in front of him, Barnes at his shoulder, rifle pointed straight at him.
“Let me care for him.” Thor shone in the late afternoon light as though he was a beacon.
on that sofa!”
“You’re the best.” Tony bent his head to his task. This was going to take a while.
“Desperately,” Steve dead-panned. “You done?”
“Tell me the Superhuman Registration Act hasn’t come up yet,” Tony asked.
Bucky snorted. “My ass.”
“Not everyone.” The cool voice sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. As one, they all turned towards the door. “Some of us think that you all behaved spectacularly badly.”
“Yes?” Thor didn’t sound sure either.
She frowned at him. “No card. Cash money.” She smacked a gnarled hand down on the counter.
Tony flinched. “I may as well have pulled the trigger.”
“Dude, you don’t have anything on me when it comes to daddy issues,” Tony said. Yeah, he was apparently deranged if he thought he could out-issue the half-god giant with a hate-on for his father.
“Uh,” Steve said, exchanging a helpless glance with Bruce. “We don’t?” Bruce shrugged.
“Jane touched it,” Tony pointed out, only a little petulantly.
Tony mumbled something under his breath and Natasha’s eyes sharpened. “Really?” She quirked an eyebrow. Steve wasn’t sure but he suspected that eyebrow had actually killed before.
“Synthetic,” Tony said, poking at the skin. “It’s got nerves and shit though.”
Yggdrasil sounded dismissive.
Tony gaped. “
Coulson’s mouth curved in a tiny smile. “Now where’s the fun in that?” he asked. He sobered. “Are you telling me that the Watcher assigned to our planet decided that something you did was so awful that he altered time so that you could fix it?”
“This is no time for your tricks, Loki.” Thor folded his arms across his chest. “Show yourself or be branded a coward!”
“But I sense much power within,” Thor said. He seemed reluctant to touch it.
Not meeting Tony’s gaze, Steve nodded, obediently heading for another elevator. Tony sighed, stalking to the back of the lift. Bucky stood beside him as the others filed in. “He’ll get over it,” Bucky said, keeping his voice low.
Loki sighed. “I am not the person I was before this all began,” he said, ignoring Thor’s angry bristling at Natasha. “I’ve grown up spoiled and selfish.”
“I’m not in the army. You’re not my boss.” Natasha’s cool reply made Tony want to kiss her. But only for a moment and then the fear set in again.
“Seriously?” Bucky glared at Steve. “All that talk about working together, and being on the same page, and you two can’t even fucking look at each other?”
And then the gates of heaven opened and God’s voice, who sounded an awful lot like Nick Fury, said, “Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better.” There was a pause and Tony heard the beautiful sound of a Helicarrier. He would have to buy something pretty for Fury. Maybe a to-scale size model of himself. “Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.”
“What…?” Steve looked at them. “You’re just going to sit here?”
Why would he have missed out on this? He….there was something there, tickling the back of his mind. Something about Steve. Something important.
Matilda jumped off the bed, heading straight for Steve. She twined around his legs with a plaintive mrrraoooww. “I guess it’s the easy way then,” Steve said. He bent down and picked her up, careful of those sharp claws and teeth. She settled into his arms easily, a soft purr the only noise.
Natasha nodded, nibbling on the corner of a Pop Tart. “He’s like a cockroach,” she agreed. “Would survive a nuclear disaster.”
“So did your family.” Vision pushed the doors open. “I hope you’re all very comfortable here.”
“I'm sure you didn't call to ask me about my training as an Avenger, Tony,” Vision replied.
“You are.” Steve was suddenly serious again. “You’ve given us more than you know.” He looked over to Bruce and Natasha. “Look at them.”
I do apologise but Tony persists in being snarky even when I want him to be angsty.
“I’m big, Tony. I don’t want to hurt you.” Steve went a little pinker. Tony wanted to wrap him up and hold him forever.
Steve couldn’t speak. His eyes were burning and his throat was tight.
“I’m serious, Tony.” Steve looked even more frustrated. “You’re good for each other.”
Happy jumped out of the car when he spotted Tony. “Boss?” He sounded worried.
“Me.” Bucky stated, looking annoyingly smug.
“Stop thinking.” Bucky lifted his head, looking down at him. He was beyond gorgeous, Tony thought dazedly. Dark hair hanging over his face, playing some sort of sexy peekaboo with those stupid eyes.
“That’s what
“I will rip off your head and spit in the hole.” Natasha’s hiss had them stumbling to a halt. “Get your fucking ass down there, Stark.” She pointed to the garden where Bruce stood, nervously fiddling with his tie.
His brain was definitely exploding, he thought. There was no actual way that Bucky Barnes had just outed his relationship with Steve after catching them kissing.
“Now that’s some cool shit.” Dean’s drawl had Tony turning around. “Not something you see every day.”
having another conversation about who’s fault this is.” Rhodey flapped a hand at the latest incarnation of the exoskeleton. “I’m alive. I’m walking. End of.”
“I’m good.” Bucky’s voice was wrecked and it made Tony’s cock twitch again at the thought that
Tony glared at him. “Telling me how I should feel, Bruce?” he sneered. “Well I guess I’m okay with being the bad guy.”
Thor put him on his feet with a contrite brushing off of his jacket. “I always forget how fragile you mortals are,” he mumbled by way of apology.
“I was worried.” And that sad little confession just pricked the bubble of righteous indignation that Tony had been blowing in his mind. He really needed to work on his internal metaphors.
“Breathe, Tony,” Pepper urged. Her voice was almost frantic; Tony could hear the panic that she was struggling to keep under control.
Sam’s glower as he bent his head to his food, hair falling across his face, reminded Tony so much of Bucky in that moment that he smiled.
Tony stared at the cauldron. “Is that what this is...?” Strange’s extremely strange and unsettlingly sentient cloak smacked Tony’s arm. He snatched it from the cauldron, glaring at the cloak. “I'm going to allow that.”
Silence again and then, “Guess it’s Rogers then. Barnes is fine.” Tony’s reply was as flat as Natasha’s had been.
“I’m not Cap or Captain when we’re here like this.” Steve paused in squeezing the lube onto his fingers. “In here, in this bed, I’m Steve and you’re Tony. And we’re lovers. Not leaders, not superheroes, not Avengers. Lovers.” His face was very serious.
“Hey, Big Guy.” Tony held out his fist in the exact same way he’d done to Bruce.
Tony asked as he dropped the towel and rummaged in his drawers for a shirt and boxers..
“I just did.” Tony was prevaricating like a boss. “Bucky, arm, Bucky, head.”
Steve just rolled his eyes. “Please remember that I’ve lived here before. I know all of your stalling tactics.”
“I believe it is my brother’s scepter,” Thor rumbled. “It too needs to be found and returned to Asgard.”
Tony put a cautious hand on Thor's shoulder. “I'm sorry.” They'd been told of Frigga's death. Tony had been the one to hold Thor in his arms while he shook in sorrow. He knew what it felt like to lose a mother to violence.
“Uh,” Clint put up a hand. “I may know somebody.” They all turned to stare at him. “What? I
“Lies,” Tony sang, gouging Rhodey’s ribs with a pointy elbow. “You adore me.”
Bruce frowned. “It’s not like he’s another person,” he began. “It’s like having a twin, a larger, angrier twin, but instead of standing next to me, he’s inside me.” He looked frustrated. “I’m not explaining this properly.”
~o0o~
Tony was in a quandary.
“That’s not what you said when we first talked about the Accords.” Tony’s voice was sharp with accusation as he tucked his hands into his armpits. “What were your exact words? Ah yes, “The safest hands are our own.””
Bucky followed, stopping at the doorway. “Steve?”
“So, are you and your brother are pretty close, then, huh, Thor?” Of course, it was Clint ‘no filter’ Barton who asked the question.
“What?” Clint muttered, scribbling as fast as he could. “That’s just…” He ignored the barrage of questions from the rest of the team and carried on writing, looking up, again and again, asking Atlantis to repeat something occasionally and then shaking his head.
need to make amends.”
Thanks so much for all the comments & thoughtful concrit. It really does help me flesh out the story. I love to read every single one of them (even those that make me a little sad).
Michael leaned his head against the bars, closing his eyes. “You should leave,” he told Tony. “You won’t have much time.”
She turned that sharp gaze on Tony. “Because May asked if we could keep him occupied. On weekends
Pepper stepped in front of Tony’s wheelchair, every muscle in her body shaking. “How dare you come here and ask
Steve stopped, mid-punch, and looked at her. “Thank you, Ayo. Where is the guest?” He tried to stay on their good side because they were as fearless and almost as fearsome as their king. He’d learned some devastatingly effective new  fighting techniques from the Dora Milaje.
“My Impala?” Tony growled. “That little fucker. I’m not a fucking pawnshop.” He counted the money. “Okay, fine, he added enough to appease my mercenary heart.”
Tony squared his shoulders. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. can you hack into the communication systems inside the Situation Room?”
distracting.
Bucky’s hand squeezed his shoulder. “Shut up, Stevie, I’m about done with this crap.” He moved to the seat that Laura had vacated, beside Steve. Tony mouthed ‘Stevie’ at him with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
Tony gaped after him. “What the fuck?”
“We called them wiseacres back in our day,” Steve said.
“One of the nanites must have been in your brain,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied. “In an area that supports consciousness.”
Tony sighed. “Man, I can’t believe I missed that,” he complained. “That’s like showing a thirsty man a river and then making him walk the other way.”
“Oh my god, what is wrong with you?” Rhodey screwed up his face in disgust. “You are the most warped asshole I’ve ever known!”
Rhodey wrapped an arm around his shoulders. “You okay there, Churchill?” Bruce, Laura and Pepper followed them towards the car where Happy stood waiting.
Knowing now what he knew about Steve and Bucky’s relationship, things made a whole lot more sense. Steve had been distraught. It had taken Bruce dressed up in his big green muscle machine to keep Steve back while Thor and Tony went after Bucky.
“I don’t need a fucking babysitter just because I broke up with my fucking girlfriend!” Tony’s venom was surprising, unwarranted and it hurt like hell.
“I’m just not in the best kind of place for people right now, Steve.” And there it was, the
Natasha put a hand on Thor’s arm. “Dear friend, we have experienced many things in this universe that are both improbable and impossible. Why would this not be such a thing?”
had a life outside of the Avengers, you know.” He sounded a little defensive.
Bruce shrugged. “It’s close enough.” He looked over at Steve. “You should probably wear some form of protective gear,” he noted. “This is dangerous stuff.”
~~~O~~~~
“And I get the dead?” Rhodes didn’t appear happy about this at all.
“We are the guardians of Midgard.” Strange didn’t even seem a little worried. Tony was clearly the one who was the worrier of this relationship. Which meant that Tony was clearly the only one with a brain. Or sanity.
Vision shrugged. “I cannot lie so it seemed best for me to be…elsewhere.”
“You’re all idiots,” Natasha declared, not missing anything, but her tone was fond.
Sam squeezed him a little. “Don’t wait so long between calls, Barton. We like to know that our friends are still alive.”
“God, people just never believe me that Captain America is such an
“I need new friends,” Tony finally gave in, tapped the remote for the lab door and lifted his head to see Rhodey and Pepper tumble in. “Here to laugh at me too, Brutus?” He raised an eyebrow at Pepper.
“Steve.” He rolled to his back, stared up at the aluminium and chrome roof trusses that Clint loved to perch in. Fuck. This hurt like a motherfucker, he thought.
“Okay,” Tony said, taking her hand. “Show me the future, Wanda.”
“Really?” Tony had never been so happy to hear that sarcastic tone. “’Cause I thought you had me killed.”
Bucky’s voice was a rumble against his ear. Tony wondered how the hell he’d ended up in the Twilight Zone. He lifted his eyes and looked straight at Steve.
“Whoah,” Bucky said, holding his hand up in apology. “Sorry guys, I looks like I read this whole thing
“Who did it?” Dean growled. He was clearly itching to go out and destroy someone. A man after his own heart then, Tony thought.
Steve fell into Tony, wrapping him in his arms as he shoved his tear-damp face into Tony’s neck. “I thought I’d lost you,” he breathed into warm, alive skin.
Natasha stepped forward. “Pepper, this has already gone on too long. We need to get the past year, the bad choices, and the losses out of the way as soon as possible. The wounds have been festering. They need to be lanced and cleaned.”
Tony knew what Ross had done to Bruce. How he’d hunted him like the biggest game prize on the planet. “Okay.” He kept his voice soft, not wanting to have Bruce relive bad memories.
look which meant that her eye twitched.
Steve could see the slight flush on Tony’s cheeks though. Plus Tony glanced out at him from the corner of his eyes several times, as though he couldn’t believe Steve
Tony held up a hand. “If you say that you didn’t mean to do that, I will not be held responsible for my actions.” He watched Steve’s face.
Bucky looked around, suddenly alert. “Where’s Tony?”
Tony shook his head. “I swear I’ve been hanging with Thor too long when this sort of speech pattern is normal for me.” He stopped walking. “Um, you mentioned a crystal cave or something?”
Uatu said.
Tony sighed. “I know I’m not exactly the poster child for successful relationships, Pep, but…”
Which…. He turned his head and looked to where Bruce and Natasha sat, heads together and whispering things to each other. “Huh.” He grinned.
“Yeah?” He had a screw between his teeth as he wrestled with a bolt that wasn’t in the right place.
“He wants to ask you out on a date.” Barnes was clearly the devil. His blue eyes danced.
~o0o~
Only as he walked back to the stove did Tony realize that Steve was wearing an exceptionally frilly apron. “Oh my god,” he crowed. “You
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Tony warned.
Steve nodded. “Have there been demands? Requests?” he asked.
going to be discussing appropriate banter when we get out of here,” Tony threatened.
“I hate you,” Steve told Bucky when he finally wrestled him beneath him.
“They're not military, Buck.” Steve needed him to understand.
“Tony…” Steve took a step forward.
Next chapter will be a big time jump - be warned. I hope you're enjoying my alternate take because really boys, the team should always be together.
“It’s magical not physical,” Bruce explained. “While the laws of physics

“You need to sleep.” Steve dropped a hand onto his arm. “I’m sure you’ll feel better afterwards and then you can catch us up on the finer details of the mission.”
“Anyway, how can Thor's
“Fuck!” Steve rushed back to Rhodes. “We need to go back to the hospital. Bucky’s gone missing.”
?” Fury asked.
“The Soul Stone,” Thor said. “That one has yet to surface, but my fear is that the enemy already has possession of it and means to collect the others and wield the Infinity Gauntlet to destroy us all.”
“I don’t care!” Loki hissed, leaping to his feet. “Kill the snake and save the universe! I care not for the fate of a child I do not know.”
h said, thinking of the changes he’d made, some subtle, some not.
Thor walked over to Carol. He held his hand up, and caught Stormbreaker as it flew over to him, missing Carol by inches.
“Hot Tub Time Machine.” Rhodey nodded at Scott respectfully. “Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.”
“We are all on the same side, are we not?” Vision asked.
Tony watched in astonishment as Natasha, emotionally crippled, vicious Natasha moved into Dean’s arms without another word.
“Oh lord,” Steve groaned. “I am regretting
Steve knew from experience that he would get nothing more from him. “How are your doctors doing with Bucky?” he asked instead, changing the subject. Saving Bucky had been the only good thing about this entire god-awful situation. And even then, he was locked away in ice now, a prisoner of his own mind.
“You’re thinking it’s some sort of portal?” Bruce asked.
Tony grimaced. “Agent Agent will hopefully get back to us soon.”
Steve threw himself over Tony, using his body to shield Tony who tried to shrug him off. “Everybody capable of moving, out of the room!” he shouted. The scattering of footsteps told Tony that at least someone was obeying.
Steve gave her a hard look. “What?” she asked. “You don’t think I’m sane?”
“Not so,” Thor refuted. “Perhaps Matilda had no choice. Perhaps she chose to hide because she was afraid. That is not cowardice. That is self-preservation.”
And wasn’t that the scariest thought of the day?
“Tell Steve and Bucky that I died with honor!” he yelled over the side.
It wasn’t his nature to be passive, but there was a neediness in Bucky’s eyes. Something haunted and desperate that kept Steve’s hands on the bed, clenched in the sheets. “Anything,” Steve rasped, hips stuttering up towards Bucky.
“God,” Tony dug his palms into his eyes. “This is why I hate people. They make demands and everything gets so fucking messy.”
And what comes after? Well, that's up in the air.
Tony grinned. “The gauntlet?”
“The fact that you just used the word ‘cool’ in a sentence to describe your coolness tells me you know shit,” Bucky drawled.
“Everyone who knows you.” Vision sounded entirely sure of his facts. He probably was, Tony thought morosely.
“You’re not putting the armor on again?” Pepper asked.
“This is fascinating,” Strange said, sounding anything but fascinated. “Whoever is coming with us, please step through the portal?”
“I could ask Billie again,” Dean said with a grimace.
“Focus on saving the world, Tin Man,” Bucky ordered. “We can talk personal shit later.”
here?” Tony asked, eyes fixed on the amulet. There was something about it…. He blinked.
been doing since you took him back to Asgard?” Natasha asked, picking carefully at her nail with a knife. Tony had no idea where she’d hidden it and he wasn’t going to ask.
“That’s what she showed me!” Tony felt defensive.
wouldn’t approve of,” Bucky guessed. Tony kept his eyes on Steve.
“We should get going,” Bruce said when they reached the lawns and stood in front of the Quinjet. “Maybe you can give me a lift?” He looked at Tony in question.
The doorbell chimed again. “You planning on answering that at any stage, Tones?” Rhodey asked, an entirely fake supportive BFF grin on his face. Tony was
“Okay, to recap, the sea is Asgard, the sky is Earth and the serpent is the wall between the worlds?” Tony wanted to make sure he had this all square in his head.
“You will be,” Steve promised. Tony perked up at that. Oh lord, the possibilities.
Bruce nodded towards Vision. “Good to see you, Vision.”
“How do
“Yes.” And there it was. The simple truth laid bare with a word.
Natasha looked between them. “Better?” she asked.
“You okay?” Steve asked softly. Tony nodded into his shoulder. Bucky ran a comforting hand down Tony’s back. It was still surreal that they were this, that they could
Tony gasped as he pulled away from Wanda. “What the fuck was that?” he demanded.
Or possibly that he’d kidnapped her.
Being the focus of those eyes was unnerving. “Tony Stark. Your father was one of the first I reaped.” She smiled a little. “He was feisty.”
“And a heads-up would have been too much?” Sam was the peace-maker, his hand touching the small of Dean’s back.
“I’m completely insane,” Steve said, rubbing his eyes. His mouth was still a little swollen from their kiss and Tony was easily distracted. “Bucky is bad enough, but adding you to the mix is like mixing fire and gasoline.”
Bucky tucked in closer, body hunched over and tense, all the gentle teasing from a moment before gone. “That’s what
“He’s a great guy,” Tony agreed. “Once you get past the crazy.” He kept his tone joking though so that Steve would know he didn’t mean it.
Tony lifted his glass as well, taking a tiny sip for appearances.
The big meeting will happen in the next chapter. I have
“Has anyone ever told you that you’re kind of a dick?” Tony took Strange’s hand.
“And since I’ve spent the last few months with Tony’s B.A.R.F. technology, we’ve come to a sort of understanding,” Bruce added.
“Any reason that happened?” Steve’s question was too studiedly casual. He was incapable of subtlety. Captain America was the actual opposite of subtle.
Tony turned to face the other three. “She's a classy lady,” Steve said.
know what Tony and the Buckster were doing,” Clint said.
“Because my friend needed me,” Clint said.
“What if Thanos gets the Time Stone from the cocksucker and then changes the game again?” Tony demanded. “Isn’t it better to destroy
He licked his lips. “When Secretary Ross came to me with his proposal, I was bleeding inside. I knew I was at fault for the devastation of Sokovia. I had no excuse but my own arrogance. I could see that people were starting to fear us instead of trusting us to save them.” Rhodey’s hand was a solid warmth on his shoulder and Tony took courage. “I knew that the Accords were going to happen, no matter if I signed or not. But in signing, I hoped that I would be able to have a little control on just
you, Sammy.” Dean looked like he wanted to shake Sam.
“Your mind isn’t on it,” Tony told him. He didn’t seem particularly upset about it though. “I don’t need you to reassure me.” He moved away from Bucky’s mouth. The growl that Bucky emitted was sub-human, and made Steve shiver. “What I do need is that, if you’re kissing me, you’re kissing
“I. Know.” Tony replied in the same tone.
“Guys, this is Sam Winchester,” Clint introduced the long drink of water first. “And his brother, Dean.” The pretty boy’s eyes were harder than anyone’s had a right to be. There was history there, Tony thought.
“And you didn’t think of maybe perhaps sharing with the class?” Steve had that pissy look on his face again. The one that usually meant Tony was about to be subjected to
“Buck!” Tony raced forward, dropping down to pull at Bucky’s arm. “Let him go! You’re strangling him!” He knew that he didn’t have the strength to actually get Bucky to let Steve go, but he wasn’t going to stand back and watch Steve die.
Natasha raised an eyebrow. “I would never be in Gryffindor. I’m a Slytherin.”
“Sitting right here,” Tony informed them, fluttering his fingers.
“You said ‘dick’,” Bucky pointed out. Tony grinned at him.
“I hate you.”
from people he doesn’t care about. If he cares, he can be a complete asshole.”
“So, anyone want to know what happened?” he asked as he went about detangling them. It was clear that neither of them intended on letting him go anytime soon. And Tony was totally on board with that.
Tony looked around at his friends. “Any questions?”
Bucky appeared unmoved. “You’re asleep on your feet,” he told him. “Those awesome, sexy, intelligent potatoes are about to pass out.”
“What? So terminal boredom is worse than being tortured on a rack?” Tony asked.
“Still such a punk.” Bucky shook his head, mouth curving in a fond smile. “I’m giving you permission, Stevie.” His eyes darkened. “I really want you to kiss me like you mean it.”
Tony pushed Bucky’s hand away. “You bust my beautiful arm sparring with god knows who, and got drunk on Asgardian mead with Steve without acquiring photographic evidence. You are so far from being allowed to tell me to do anything. I saved the fucking world!”
“I swear, I’m okay, Cap,” Tony said, this time, less annoyed, more careful. “Come here.” He held out a hand and Steve immediately pushed away from the wall, grabbing hold.
F.R.I.D.A.Y. broke into his pathetic musings. “Sir, Mr. Barnes is requesting entrance.”
~~~~~~
return, Thor,” Pepper said, waving at Clint. “Atlantis had something to say while you were gone.”
“Same song, different tune, Cap,” Sam said.
Steve’s arms were a fairly clear barometer of Steve’s feelings. Right now, he was determined. Tony had to get him off this topic. “I needed some time to myself,” he said. “It was more difficult than I thought it would be.”
of you. I mean it.”
“If he did, the world would end,” Tony agreed. He started a search for Barton, trying to determine his location.
“What if things were different? Where would you begin to make amends?” Tony lifted his head to peer at whoever was talking, but he was just
“And they do?” Bruce asked. “I mean, inter-dimensional wanna-be demon gods aren’t exactly anyone’s milieu.” Tony loved that Bruce used words like ‘milieu’ when he talked. It made Hulk’s grunting even more entertaining.
Also, Bucky is so sassy :D
“Director Stark has promised safe passage for all of you, Captain.” T’Challa repeated what he’d said to Steve about ten times already. “Your friend will be in safe hands until he is able to answer to the United Nations on his own.”
“So, Blue Meanie, where is your purple parent?” Tony asked.
Tony nodded. “Have you heard of him?” Please God let him have heard of him and then perhaps there might be something a little less bonkers about this entire situation and it might not actually be a wish-fulfillment dream…
“Huh.” Bruce was looking at all of them. “Seems like our little family still puts the 'fun' in dysfunctional.”
be better than this.” He put a sandwich together and passed it over to Bucky. “Eat,” he ordered.
Tony backed away from Loki. Steve was in front of him before he could blink. “Stay back,” Steve ordered. “I don’t know what you think Tony knows but you don’t get to come near him.”
“Not anymore,” Sam said, moving to one of the other soft chairs in the library. “We’re as far from a team as we possibly could be. We’re here, Tony, Rhodey and Vision are in New York and Bruce and Thor are god knows where. We’re no team, Steve.”
Loki still came.
~o0o~
Ah, Tony thought. So Steve
be the guy flying the nuke into space.”
Steve shook his head. “We’re a team, we’ll do it together.”
One of the king’s personal guards came into the gym where Steve was sparring with Clint. “There is someone here to see you, Captain.” She had been left behind at the palace, much to her disgust. And she hadn’t hesitated to tell Steve and the others about her annoyance at being their babysitter.
“I do not!” Tony was aghast.
Steve glared at Clint. “That’s not helpful.”
“Don’t do that again.”
“Hey,” Tony lifted their joined hands to his chest where his heartbeat gave its steady lup-dub. “I’m alive. Peggy gave part of the universe as well as pieces of herself to me so that I could live. She thinks you’re the best thing since chocolate, by the way.”
“He’ll be fine.” Clint sounded like he was reassuring himself. “Tony’s a big boy. He’ll be fine.”
“Okay.” Steve clapped his hands together. “How do we do this?”
Again.
be laughing at his pain. “It’s not funny, you dick.”
Thor’s mouth was set. “It is unconscionable.”
Steve nodded. “I know. But there’s serious trouble coming so we need to do it fast.”
“He’s not going alone!” It was Steve shouting suddenly, moving to Tony’s other side.
Steve nodded. “I thought he’d choose to fly himself rather than in the jet.” He stared at Bucky. “Are you planning on fighting with us?”
“Brother, you should trust my friends as I do.” Thor stared at Loki’s mutinous face. “If you trust me…”
“I don’t know how the two of you ever managed to finish a month of college, let alone years,” Bruce said, dropping minute amounts of blood onto several microscope glass slides.
His mind was whirling. So many possibilities. He couldn’t wait to talk to Bruce.
“I have to,” Tony grumbled. “Even if it’s just to get the bastard off the scent.”
So this feels wa-aa-aa-ay more angsty than the last one. Sorry about that. Hope you'll stick with me
Tony lifted his head, met Steve’s gaze as Bucky shuffled in behind him. “Because if I fail, then at least I know you all will be here to hold the line.”
“When you’re too happy or too sad?” Lila persisted.
Steve touched Bruce’s hand. “If I sleep, I see Tony falling,” he whispered, glancing over to where Natasha and Clint sat. “I see Bucky falling. I can’t do anything to stop it.” He clenched his fists. “I’m supposed to be a super soldier and I can’t do anything to save the men I love.”
They looked at each other in confusion. “What the hell?” Clint’s succinct question said exactly what they were all thinking.
“It’s one I’ve called you in my head since I’ve known you,” Steve told him, grinning at Barnes as they went past. “Hey, Buck, I reckon I don’t need to worry about dames liking me. I think I may be getting lucky.”
Bruce flushed. All. Over.
He started laughing then. If Tony had been here, it would have been a disaster. Thank god for small mercies.
“He did it with anyone who hurt him,” Rhodes corrected. “The fact that you’re here, that he’s talking to you, that he’s willing to work with you again… It’s huge. Tony doesn’t give second chances. Ever. Don’t fuck it up.”
“You’re not going to open that alone.” Steve’s voice in his ear made him shiver a little.
Yggdrasil said.
“That’s because you gave yourself alcohol poisoning.” Pepper’s grim tone had him realizing he’d said that out loud.
“No-one is defecating,” Vision said, looking puzzled.
“I know.”  Her eyes softened to only mildly homicidal. “I’m sorry, but if we’re brutally honest, nobody was expecting it to last.”
Tony stared up at the man that stood in their way. “Barnes?” He hated the slight quiver in his voice.
“Just ‘cause I wear the stars and stripes doesn’t make me perfect,” Steve grinned as he swept his leg, dropping Clint to the mat like a stone. “You done?”
Tony nodded, body suddenly aching with exhaustion. “That’s a great idea, Viz. Can I leave you and Laura to take care of that? Maybe call them, let them know where they should be headed.”
Bucky put a hand over his mouth. “Stop,” he said. “Nanites. Still there.”
Tony looked at him. “You’re looking remarkably satisfied with life,” he noted. Hopeful, Tony thought, Bucky looked hopeful.
“I’m right,” Steve breathed. “You
Uatu told him.
Tony took a moment to appreciate it.
“Talk,” he snarled at Thor. “What is Peggy saying here?”
“Found it!” Sam crowed, making a loop-de-loop around the Quinjet. “Definitely Banner's last stand...what? Ow!”
Bucky made a scoffing sound. “Seriously, we all know that it’s the old guy who’s trying to get it up over here who’s the menace.” He gave a yelp when Tony grabbed his hair and yanked. “Oh, kinky,” he purred a moment later.
Actually, it probably was exactly what he'd been expecting.
Tony lay back on the floor, sticking his tongue out at her. “I’m totally your favorite,” he told her.
“Whatever extra juice was added to Extremis healed him completely,” Tony said with a grin. “He actually, literally kicked my ass.” He glared at the cape. “Stop that.”
“So is Cap,” Tony reminded him. “Can you locate him, J?”
Steve held Tony in his arms, relishing the chance to be close to him. Tony had never been the most affectionate of the team, but Steve had missed those odd little aborted pats and touches that Tony handed out absently. He hadn’t realized how precious they were until he didn’t have them anymore.
“Who’s going to ask him?” Bucky looked around the room.
“No.” He turned back to the view. “He’s known where we are the whole time.”
Hell is just....Hell. Dante had it right and it scares the crap out of Tony
“Okay.” Nate let out a soft snore. “Now, take this blanket hog and get some rest.”
Sam's quicksilver smile was his reward as he hurled himself out of the Quinjet. Apparently whatever new tech Tony had kitted Falcon out with was more than a match to keep up with War Machine.
Tony cackled at Steve’s blush. “Babe, we’re in the middle of a threesome. No place for the vapors.”
Tony watched them, noting the silence as they worked. Bruce and Natasha talked quietly to each other. Steve went to get coffee for everyone, Coulson and Clint at his heels. Bucky sat beside Tony, eyes fixed on Sam and Dean.
“Darn straight,” Tony said, holding onto her just as hard.
Tony made a meeping noise and promptly came all over himself without even a touch.
“You do realize that I’m not going to let you bind me for another thousand years without a fight, don’t you?” Lucifer’s eyes blazed. “My time of retribution is too near to allow you to jeopardize it.”
“Magic has a signature,” Strange replied from behind him. “And my magic is particularly obvious.”
“No.” Steve stood, folding his arms across his chest, trying his best to appear intimidating to an alien god. “That’s not how this team does things.” He glared a little at Thor. “And
Tony stared back at her. “That’s not something I’m at liberty to share with you.”
“Of course,” Vision said. “Your presence here has already caused Mr. Stark considerable physical and emotional trauma. I intend to mitigate it as much as I possibly can.” He paused. “Mr. Stark requested F.R.I.D.A.Y. inform me of Wanda’s demise. May I enquire as to the reason for her murder?” He sounded as though he was asking about the weather.
Steve shrugged. “I’ve already told her.”
“Oh look at that, your line is
Bucky patted his shoulder, reaching around Steve. “I wouldn’t want to treat you like a lady, babe.”
Tony glared at her. She wasn’t looking at him so it wasn’t particularly effective.
They were making slow progress, cautiously feeling their way in the dark.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Are you trolling me?”
“I’m not sure,” Tony admitted. “I just asked for an extraction.”
“Never funny,” Bucky said, mouth tight. “The rack is fucked up.”
“Not even your precious Pepper?” Tony sneered, feeling small and mean.
Thank you for your patience & encouragement. I would like you to know that I may not reply to the comments but I clasp every one of them to my ample bosom with joy.
“My brother’s freedom is at stake as is the salvation of my realm,” Thor said. “I will return as soon as the Infinity gem is within my grasp.”
The air in the room literally moved out of the way for the newcomer. Tony didn’t know who he was, but he already didn’t like him.
Tony held Steve tighter. “We got really, really lucky,” he murmured into Steve’s neck. “I don’t even want to imagine how awful my life would be without you and Bucky and the team.”
Tony made a scoffing sound. “I told you, Barnes, when I do things, I don’t go halfway.”
“Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this,” Natasha’s voice hitched. “I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.”
“Hi?” Tony said.
“The fact that I’m alive is wrong?” Now Steve sounded wounded.
“I do.” T’Challa inclined his head. “No-one should be without boundaries. Not even you, Captain Rogers.”
Steve stared at Natasha. “Stark sent you?”
“For fuck’s sake,” Bucky groaned. “Would you two please just get a room and have angry fucking make-up sex and get it over with?”
Thor grabbed him, lifting him in his huge arms and swinging him around. “It is good to be back in the new city of York,” he boomed. “I find I have missed the stench of this most noble town.”
“Jeez, you guys should get a room or something.” Steve sounded amused.
to be okay.
Tony bit his lip while he thought. Steve saw Bucky follow the movement. Something dark and ugly twisted deep inside him and he shoved it ruthlessly back down. This wasn't going to ruin his friendship with either of them.
Steve and Bucky exchanged glances. “Okay,” Steve shrugged. “I’m up for the challenge.”
Tony chuckled. It was filthy. “Oh, Barnes, you are totally showing right now.” He wriggled a little, smile getting wider as Bucky swore.
“And I’m sure you’ll do it again,” Tony said. “Just try to remember to take it outside before you leave?”
Bruce pulled a small StarkPhone out. Tony’s eyes narrowed. The asshole could have been traced the entire time with his phone. Tony had been an idiot! “Nat?”
Tony stopped at the opening. “Into the void,” he said, and stepped through into Purgatory.
Loki sighed. “And yet, I am not convinced.”
“I thought you said you were done with being Iron Man?” Steve asked.
“Did he just…?” Clint asked.
“No it wasn’t,” Pepper countered. “You only drank yourself into a stupor for a week. That’s barely a heart-bruise for you.” She looked like she wanted to laugh. He needed new friends.
Suddenly Tony was terrified.
Tony wedged in-between them with a hip bump, nudging Bruce nearer to Natasha and making a space for himself at the bar. Bucky and Steve joined them a moment later, finding their own spots around the elegant counter.
