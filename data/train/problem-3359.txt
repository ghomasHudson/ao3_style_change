“Pestilence and Famine shouldn’t be too much trouble,” Crowley clears his throat, “Put the demons on one and the angels on the other. Should make for a merry tussle.”
“Humans are more adaptable.” Bobby snaps, “Plus it was Sammy, all you had to do was turn the TV on and he was happy.”
Gabriel makes a long noise that's half a sigh and half growl. "Fine." He tips his head back and stares at the ceiling for a long moment, leaving Dean waiting. "Crowley wasn't just hurt. He was dying. You couldn't see that with your puny human eyes, but the demon's soul was in shreds. I'd say Jhudiel half exorcised him from his body a few dozen times, then dragged him back while keeping up the damage to the flesh."
Castiel turns and Dean realizes just how up in the angels personal space he’d gotten. “Do you honestly believe you’re the first person to have tried?”
Remiel smiles, a slow indulgent thing. "I perceived a sudden breach in your wards so I followed, expecting danger. I know now that I was mistaken. You can tell that idiot he can stop hiding behind doors, I know he's in there."
The book hits the ground with a 'thud', pages splaying open as the binding twists. Barachiel can't even feel anger anymore, he's not even sure he should pity whatever his brother's become.
Dean tipped the mug back, not caring that the cooling foam was making a home in the stubble over his upper lip. He looked at Cas, who was standing at the counter explaining to a customer that her husband’s infidelity wasn’t his fault but was probably the root of her displeasure with the dairy-free beverage she’d ordered, and every wire in his body, every twist that Dean tried so impossibly to undo, bundled into a knot under his ribs.
“How is it blasphemy if our Father has abandoned us?” Afriel asked. She seemed sincere and finally pulled the ratty beret off her head. Dean winced at the clumps of hair that fell off with it.
“This is how I’ve wanted you,” Cas whispered against his throat. “Dean—” He didn’t finish, choosing instead to test how it would feel to pull Dean’s collar aside and bite gently into the salty curve where his neck met his shoulder.
“But the sky is getting dark,” Afriel responded. “Don’t you know anything about humans? This is when they ‘sleep’. We should wait a while before talking to them.”
Cas disappeared almost instantly, and the three hunters didn’t speak as they spread out. They moved quickly and quietly through the rows of destroyed metal boxes and cinder block frames, stepping over the dead potted plants and broken window shutters that littered their path. Their senses were on high alert, but they didn’t see anything move other than some rodents and their own shadows—the whole place was quiet.
Dean hated it, sending Cas in undercover without backup while he and Sam ran around the city chasing leads.
Dean laughed and batted her hand away. “I promise I’ll try,” he said, a lop-sided grin pulling at one side of his mouth.
Normally he’d go over and see if Bobby needed any company, but he couldn’t bring himself to walk over. He shuffled for a minute on the low, rotting stoop before giving in to the pull to head back inside.
As light flickered over Cas’ face, Dean could still hear the sparks that exploded in the barn the first time they’d met. He remembered Cas’ curious expression as Dean plunged Ruby’s blade into his chest. It felt like a lifetime ago, and in the dim light on Bobby’s porch, it looked like every moment of that lifetime was weighted on Cas’ shoulders.
It is only once he leaves, and sets down in an empty parking lot near where Dean said he could find good ol' Prudence that he allows himself to really think --
"Robert, obviously." Castiel said, opening the highchair as he'd seen Barachiel do, slipping Elle inside. She held out her hands for her lion which he removes from his pocket and hands to her. She had decided after some deliberation to leave Sir Bear Bear with Dean, for protective reasons.
It's like watching a penny drop off the Empire State building, small, sudden, and deadly. Raven's eyes widen and it takes her about three seconds to start flailing around the yard. "You can't be
“You mean it was stay in Heaven or go find Abe?” Dean asks, because that’s fucked up. You shouldn’t have to pick between your kids or home and hadn’t that war been going on for like three hundred years?
Dean kicked off his boots and put a small lantern on the table between their beds before throwing himself on the mattress, his hands crossed behind his head.
“Then we find it, Sam. That’s not a fucking option.” He dug his fingers into his hair in frustration. He motioned to Bobby with one hand, and without a thought, Bobby passed him the flask from his pocket.
Dean thought back to their first run in with a group of hunters. The ones that had destroyed the back of Bobby’s home, hurt Cas, and forced them to abandon their safehouse. He could tell they were all a little uneasy about joining forces with another group, but he trusted Charlie and he knew the others would come around.
“You’re in pain?” Dean leaned away from the wing that was still half under him, angry at himself for not seeing the signs sooner. Cas had all but told him when he said they were sensitive.
The room was surprisingly clean. There was barely any dust inside, other than what would normally accumulate over a few months sneaking in through the cracks in the window or through the vent from the other rooms. It was cold, but that was expected. Not as cold as a damn trailer with half of the back room missing. It felt familiar. It felt a little closer to that kind of normal he was hoping to find somewhere.
Cas squinted in concentration, leaning over the hood of the car to get a closer look without dragging his jacket through the dust. Dean watched a tendon in his neck stretch with the effort of keeping balance, and for once split, stupid second, he imagined what it would be like to follow the groove of it with his tongue.
This is my first Supernatural fic, and I'm so thrilled to finally be able to post it. I hope you like pining, and I hope you like post-apocalyptic sexual tension because lordt are you gonna get some.
He set out four bowls anyway, filling them up and adding some of the chopped canned fruit that made it more palatable for all of them (even Sam had come around to the syrupy topping, at least once in a while).
“Is that going to be safe? That’s a lot of rooms to clear. Anyone could be staying there,” Sam said, sounding tired. Dean searched his face for any hint that he was sick again, wasn’t at 100%, but he couldn’t see anything more than the typical exhaustion from spending a day on the road.
“If this was angels,” Cas said, “they’re very likely after me. I can make the trip alone. Make sure it’s safe.”
He listened to Cas, who explained more about the spell, what went wrong, and what would happen if Dean didn’t leave. And he listened to Dean, who told him that there was a survivor from Rufus’ group, and people knew where they were, and they couldn’t put themselves through that again.
Is Dean really Dean now? There's no John to hide from or, conversely, base his entire identity around anymore- he's free.
One more voice in crying out for mercy he doesn’t have, one more tortured soul to add to a very long list.
He reaches up to inspect the damage on his overlong hair and it catches his eyes then, the angry red splashed across his shoulder. He lowers his arm and inspects in it the mirror- a handprint burned into the flesh of his shoulder. It’s just a little smaller than his own hand, the fingers longer, the palm more rounded. He can’t bring himself to touch it.
The next words shake the building again and something in Dean's chest freezes. "Because you are the Righteous Man. Because we have work for you."
Bobby was a good man. John was not. Sam, Dean thinks, stands in the middle of them, all that righteous anger a double-edged sword that cuts him as deeply as he cuts the world. Dean, having died so young, is still unformed. The years in Hell don't count, he won't let them, so these will be his proving grounds. The literal apocalypse is happening around him and if these aren't the fires that forge a man, he doesn't know what are.
and certain that this is an illusion and why wouldn't it be? Dean knows how that sense of unreality will linger, will make everything seem just slightly wrong, taste like ash and ambrosia at once until something more fucked than even the demons could think up happens. And it will, because that's their life.
Dean reaches out and smooths Elle's messy hair then runs his fingers through Cas' before swallowing. He didn't want to bring this up but... "We need to talk."
They’re in the car. Dean’s in the driver's seat, keys in hand. Sam’s next to him with Ruby's knife and the Colt between them on the seat. Castiel is in the back, still holding the baby.
coming up with great ideas lately so he'll take the praise where he can get it, and because Gabriel stopped being a restless mess as soon as Sam had gotten close to him again. This was something he could work with. He bends, and presses a kiss to the spot behind Gabriel's ear, smiling at the noise Gabriel makes.
He's trying to move, struggling to get away while Barachiel struggles to keep a hold of him. Castiel and Gabriel immediately slide between him and the humans in the house because the fallen is dangerous when he
He can see Dean and Castiel making their way back down the stairs and he shakes his head. Dean is holding Elle, whose eyes are still so very wide. "Doesn't matter now. Look, these marks. She should not have these. This line here? It's like a vacancy sign for demons, any bastard worth his salt could possess her without a lick of trouble. This other one?" Barachiel isn't sure if he should explain, the words 'tramp stamp' keep wanting to bubble out of his mouth but he doesn't want Robert to pick him up and throw him across the yard. "That second one is... Well, it's Remiel's name, they bound her with his name so we couldn't sense her. Nothing angelic could. It's like a fake mark so anyone would think she's already claimed and leave her alone."
They have seven whole seconds before Dean loses sight of Gabriel and the others outside, before there are hands and faces shoved against the windows, breaking through the glass, splintering the front door. There's no way they can hold their ground when push comes to shove. The colt runs out of bullets before Dean can even fathom a break in the crowd in front of him. Castiel's holding his ground, while Dean sees Sam get shoved up the stairs as he keeps slashing. The angels are falling, easy to take out but there's just so many.
"Uhhh," Barachiel starts and then realizes that really isn't a good way to start anything. "Um, Rem might not be as delirious as I thought."
“I apologize again. I knew my brother would be be desperate to see Abdiel but I at least hoped that we could discuss a plan before traveling to your location.” The angel continues cleaning.
"What choice?" Sam asks. He knows he shouldn't be this interested. He's telling himself that it's just something new. New information and he likes learning. But that isn't it, not really.
Anna and Crowley are sitting in a huddle on the floor by Michael’s feet, pouring over one of Bobby’s notebooks that they both seem to be adding text to one at a time. Remiel is talking to Lucifer, keeping up with the pacing as the devil nods and Remiel occasionally grabs a sheaf of parchment to present it to him from Barachiel who stands there with his arms full. Dean scans the room and sees Emily asleep with her head on Bobby’s desk, a blanket thrown over her.
Another kiss is pressed to the top of Dean's spine. "Dilectus meus candidus et rubicundus electus ex milibus," Cas whispers against his skin; each word a brush of lips against Dean's skin.
“From what I gathered from the database it seems that the case is still open because the hunter that testified had every word that came out of his mouth red flagged. Autopsy showed crushing trauma, and from where the body was found it was ruled as accidental. But from the testimony we can’t tell what exactly happened.”
Carefully and unsure, Mendel gives the fledgling over. "She's so tiny," he ventures. "And her grace is so bright."
about that later," Gabriel tells her. She pales and bites her lip. If this wasn't Anael, who loved humans so, who loved the world so, he would worry that she was on Lucifer's side. "First you're going to come meet our niece."
It's early, early enough that the blankets still contain the best feelings of warmth, of cradling and comfort.
Dean snorts and gently places Elle in her crib. He strokes his fingers over her tiny features, before covering her with a blanket. "It's already done, you can't change it," Dean says as he straightens. "I think the more pressing issue is
"Courting?" Sam asks, that was really not what he was expecting to get asked. Fucking, sure. Dating, maybe. But courting?
A sick clawing feeling works it's way up Dean's throat, choking him. "What happens to Cas then if..." he cuts himself off and carefully sits his beer down on the counter. He rubs his hand over his face before going on. "Zachariah sent me to the future once." That seems a good place to start.
Slowly Sam lets out a breath and wraps his hand around the center of the blade, and squeezes just a fraction of an inch. He feels the blade shift, just where he's touching it, going from a solid to... The metal slides through his fingers like water, like smoke before he's pulled his hand through it, unscathed.
"Yeah," he says, standing, pushing himself back into Gabriel's personal space and the archangel leans towards him like a moon caught in orbit. He flips a book open. "Barachiel said he could seal her into one form or the other but the problem was that if we just sealed her in human form, then all the power she would be generating as an angel wouldn't have anywhere to go. She isn't supposed to have two forms, they aren't quite compatible. She hasn't shifted in awhile, not after you guys took her flying, but that was the longest she'd spent in her angel form."
Cas’ thrusts grew more frantic, and Dean grabbed the side of Cas’ face, holding him so he could watch as the angel lost control. Bright blue eyes shone down at him and he looked magnificent and powerful and Dean was wasted by it as electricity shot through the base of his spine. Cas tightened his hold on Dean’s cock, stroking him until his body hit a trembling crescendo.
“How Sam managed to sleep through that racket I’ll never know,” Bobby said once he was clean, dropping the cloth in the pile of rags they needed to boil.
“I’m mostly healed,” Cas said, stiffly trying to find a more comfortable position between Dean’s legs. Dean’s arms tightened around him to stop him from moving. He’d seen enough shit in his life, stitched up Sam enough, that it was hard to override the instinct to keep people still.
He frowned, trying to flatten it as he sat down beside Dean, who grabbed him around his shoulders and messed it up again. “I like it messy,” he said, pressing a fruit-sticky kiss to Cas’ temple.
So instead, he turned off the light, and whispered in the dark things he’d said before, and things he was saying for the first time, and fell asleep breathing Cas’ air and happy.
it,” he muttered, trying to get his bearings enough to pull himself up. His right hand had landed in the sludge puddle, and as he turned over to sit, he sighed as he wiped his hand on his carpet. Then wiped what stuck to his hand from the carpet onto his jeans.
“How?” he asked simply. “How do you make it stop?” He started to move towards Dean but stopped after taking a half step forward.
They hammered out the details of their plan until things started to make sense, even to Dean, who was struggling to focus through his fugue.
There was silence until Bobby spoke over the flurry of the rising flames. “I made a life here with Karen. And I made a life here for you boys. This is where I raised my family—where I raised two heroes.” His voice broke, and he took a moment to finish, “And this is the hardest goddamn thing I’ve had to do in my life.”
Everything hurt, his bones hurt, and he nodded tersely, ignoring Cas’s hand as he slid off the hood and stumbled into the driver’s seat. “Yeah. G’night, Cas.”
Cas looked down at the mark, like he forgot it was there. “Yes. I manifested it when we left Illinois. It’s a series of Enochian warding symbols, similar to the ones I marked you with,” he said. “It keeps me hidden from angels.”
They made it work, as best they could, and did their damnedest not to dwell on what they’d left behind. Dean’s hands were still shaking a couple of days in, and no matter how badly he wanted it to, the pounding in his head telling him to go back to Bobby’s had barely started to fade.
Cas moaned and his tongue darted out to lick what he could reach off of his lips. His thick cock was still clenched in his fist and he was stroking it with frantic gasps.
He had the front of Cas’ jacket dripped tightly in one fist, like a sick pantomime of how they’d stood the night before. Dean's face twisted as he dragged Cas to the edge of Sam’s bed and pointed at his brother.
They all agreed to meet at first light the next day, and finally getting settled in the room, Dean put the chain on the door and dragged over a chair to wedge under the handle to keep them somewhat secure for the night.
Dean swore when he saw it. But he also wondered if he’d ever seen Cas’ handwriting before. He couldn’t remember, but it was so easy to imagine Cas carefully printing the straightforward, blocky letters with one of his small, private smiles.
“Well,” Dean had said, standing over her, “that ain’t for you to judge. And the fact you went all Minority Report on innocent people means we’ve got to come to some sort of agreement here.”
“Of course it’s not fucking easy.” Dean couldn’t control the resentment that twisted through him. He’d been agonizing over this shit for weeks—months—and the cavalier way Bobby just threw it on the table pissed him off. “He was a fucking angel, and because of—” Dean faltered, “because of us, he’s losing his mojo. He’s losing everything.”
“We all say things we regret,” he said quietly, leaning down so his face was level Dean’s, but it also gave him a moment to rest some of his weight on the back of the bench at Dean’s shoulder. He dragged his thumb along Dean’s cheekbone and drew himself up, looking down at Dean in a way that made him feel defenseless. He stared back, held in place by the fierce look in Cas’ eyes more than the hand on the side of his face.
Cas took a shuddering step forward, throwing Dean a little off balance as he carefully let him go. “No.”
Dean’s breath hitched and he turned around to face Cas, grabbing his head to kiss him deep and slow. He felt Cas’ hand slide over the curve of his ass and press their hips together, and as Dean groaned and rutted against him, he could already feel Cas getting hard. The angel broke their kiss and dropped his back with a quiet, needy sound that made the hairs on Dean’s arms stand on end.
He tried to take a breath, tried to quiet the rage that burned in his chest and down his arms. But everything he ignored—Lucifer’s laughter, his brother’s bloody face, and the way Cas fucking
“I do actually. But you’re still healing from the breaking of the spell. Don’t… overexert yourself.”
It took Cas a second to figure out what was happening, which is why Dean mentally explained away the small smile and hand that ghosted over his hip.
After a minute, Sam said, “We should have left them something,” talking more to his chest than to his brother.
This new Cas, this unpredictable, half-human disaster, was just the kind of crazy Dean found it hard to keep his wall of bravado up against. Every time he put a brick back in place, Cas was pushing another down.
Sam just rolled his eyes. “We need everything we’ve found. And we can’t expect Cas to keep making runs for us.”
“It’s the end of the world, son. Maybe now’s the time to live for yourself a little.” When Bobby said it, his face cracked open, like he’d been holding in the words for so long they’d scabbed over.
“So what does this have to do with Henry Winchester?” Bobby asked, his eyes flicking between the angels in the booth and the burger in front of him.
“We’re not actually following her?” Dean turned on the group, not believing for a second they would all agree to go.
From this distance, Dean couldn’t make out his features. He couldn’t see anything, except for the light shining out from under the display. He took a breath and stood where he was as Cas shuffled to retrieve it.
Cas finally looked up, locking eyes with Dean in the mirror. Dean turned his head quickly to get a glance of Cas outside of the grimy, reflective surface. His eyes were brighter blue, highlighted by the muted tones of the ash Cas hadn’t yet bothered to mojo-away. Dean brought the car to a sudden stop and twisted in his seat to look at him.
Turiel laughed, although it was a breathy wheeze more than an actual laugh. “You’ll help us because when the war is over we’ll be able to help you. Michael wasn’t the one who started… all of this,” he said, gesturing to the room and the world around them. “That was all Lucifer. Michael doesn’t care about this pathetic little planet, but he does care about defeating his brother so that he can claim our Father’s throne.”
Their last leg wasn’t a long one—Cas told Dean it should only take a few hours. He took the opportunity to close his eyes for a minute against the ache that had settled into his forehead.
This was the side of Cas that scared Dean. The side that was so devoted to a father that had abandoned him, who couldn’t see beyond his own selfish ideas. And he was this unknowable
“It’s difficult to get into details. But once he destroyed the world of man, Lucifer turned his wrath on Heaven. I’m here now, but I—” he stopped to take an unnecessary breath, a habit he’d picked up from humanity. “But I doubt I’ll be welcomed back, and my connection to the Host may start to fade.”
He glanced at Cas out of the corner of his eye, but it was impossible to get a read on the guy. It drove Dean crazy the way Cas could be so expressionless—he never could tell what was going on in his head. And right now, especially after last night, Dean could really use a fucking clue.
Dean thought back to their drive into the city. Nothing stood out to him as inherently dangerous about it. But something wasn’t sitting right in his gut, following this stranger to some secondary location they weren’t familiar with.
Afriel smiled and nodded. And with a rustle of feathers, they were off to see the rubble that remained of the City of Light.
“Sorry about, uh, anything you might be pissed at me for.” Dean avoided eye contact choosing instead to look at the steam rising from his coffee.
“I’m gonna go look after Sam,” he said, gathering the journal up and turning on his heel. He didn’t hear the press of dead grass and leaves following him, so he assumed Cas stayed where he was.
They finished sweeping the rest of the area, avoiding the sharp, rusted metal that jutted out from any units that had siding left intact and convened around the man-made pond in the center of the property. It was filled with garbage, and Dean was pretty sure he could see a dead cat floating around in the water.
Dean pulsed from the aftershock, his entire body sensitive to fingertips and tongue and the stretch of Cas inside of him and the sharp pain of teeth biting into his shoulder. Muscles tensed under Dean’s hands as Cas’ thrusts grew more frantic, more erratic, until Cas finally came, buried deep inside of him, shuddering and spent.
“Very much,” Cas said softly, turning to rub his face against Dean’s stubble, before leaning in to kiss his mouth. It was quiet, firm, perfect, and left him reeling.
With all of his angelic… stuff. It shook him, that this person he thought he knew better than anyone, other than Sam, wasn’t really a person at all.
Dean wondered if the feeling of home he’d felt so deeply at Bobby’s had just somehow transferred to the angel in front of him. A fluke. Residuals of the spell. That had to be it, the reason for the warm, excited buzz that was spreading through him at Cas’ hesitant touch.
“Alright. Well… drink that,” Dean said, not knowing what else he could say, but feeling like he needed to say something. Tell his brother what to do even if he wasn’t sure what the right move was.
Cas cocked his head to one side. “This vessel is organic. It would be impossible for me to have ‘wires crossed’ as I do not possess any. You prayed to me. My people skills may be rusty, but my bond with you—"
“Cas is right.” Dean had to force the words out of his mouth, the throb in his head getting deeper with every word. The angel’s face was drawn tight and his eyes were shining as he stared blankly at the scene around him.
But he believed her, or wanted to. As a rule, he avoided ganking witches and only considered it as a last resort when it was clear they couldn’t be saved. And even then, it was never an easy decision. Witches were human. Looked human. Monsters were always easier to kill when their outsides were as ugly as their insides.
“It was the right thing to do. If even one of those assholes made it back to whatever camp they had, they might have brought back more trouble. People—hunters—know me. Know where I live. I couldn’t put you boys in that kinda danger. You’re more important to me than a pile of brick and mortar.”
They sat at the pine bar a while, drinking their drinks and hardly saying a word—like they were scared if they questioned anything the spell would break and they’d be transported back to the scorched Earth waiting for them outside. Dean ordered another without being asked to pay or put down one of the fake credit cards he still kept in his wallet.
Turiel shoved Cas off of him easily. The force threw Cas into the diner’s long counter with a crack, and Dean rushed over to check on him. He was dazed, but not out, and he ignored Dean as stood up without a word. His mouth was a hard line and there was a spark behind his eyes.
Dean worried about his brother, about the idea of loading him in a car and expecting him to fight. There’s no way Sam could do it in the shape he was in, regardless of whether or not the enormous idiot would admit to it.
The house was the same as the last time Cas had been there—dark, cool, and filled with a lifetime of hunting supplies and memories. As they put away groceries, Dean realized he’d only been there a few times, mostly confined to the kitchen, and, for a time, the panic room where they helped Sam break the pull of his addiction to demon blood. Not all the memories in this house were good ones. There was a layer of grief that coated everything in it, like the ash that suffocated the world outside.
Something twisted in his gut, trying to push against the happiness he felt seeing his brother healthy. He ignored it and pulled Sam into a hug he might not have been ready for, but at that moment, Dean really couldn’t give a shit.
Outside, Sam clutched the box in his hand. They’d left Larry in his enchanted farmhouse sitting at the table, still begging them to lose the key and the bunker forever as they awkwardly pushed each other towards the door.
“I am very much ‘over this’,” Cas said quietly, leaning against the headboard when he was finally settled.
Sam invited them to take it by pointing at the half-unwrapped tablet on the ground, still lying where it landed when Abaddon attacked them.
Wiping his hand on his jacket, he looked around at their camp. It was already half packed up and most of what they’d brought with them or found, that they’d use again on the road, was gone.
In Sioux Falls, it wasn’t as overcast as it was closer to the coast. Even a few hundred miles made a difference, and the small amount of sun they got this far inland helped Dean feel a little bit better about the… whole thing. He sat looking at the light shining through a crack in the boarded-up window beside him, the gun he was cleaning forgotten on the table in front of him.
Dean met Sam’s eyes. This had been their fight, something that had torn them apart and to pieces a hundred times over. If Sam was up for it, so was Dean.
“Okay, so, we don’t put on any jewelry while we’re looking,” Dean finally took his legs off the table, stretching them out and wiggling his toes to get rid of the pins and needles. “It’s a tablet. That’s a big, cement slab, right? Can’t be hard to miss.”
The pain in his head had barely faded since they left Bobby’s, so he was having a hard time figuring out what was the spell and what was the hangover.
Inside, it was dark except for a small fire flickering in a small table-top barbecue near an open window. And around it, a group of people were huddled cooking something that might have made Dean’s mouth water if it weren’t for the smell that hit him like a punch to the face. It was hot inside, and rank, and the group stood up and started scrambling to snatch up their belongings at the sudden intrusion.
Dean’s knees were finally about to give out, so he walked over to the couch and let himself sit, hands still in his pockets. He stared at the puddle of sludge in the corner of the room, the one that no matter how often they’d tried to sop up, persisted and continued to rot through the carpet.
Before he put everything away, he turned the ham radio that was set up on a table near the library to the frequency he’d given Charlie.
He almost dropped the can of food when he saw what the blanket had been hiding. Sam’s mouth was covered in blood, and the entire side of his face, the side that was lying against the stained pillow, was coated in it, practically stuck to the fabric that was sticky with what Sam had coughed up.
He stalked across the room and pushed into Cas’ space, throwing the useless flat-screen TV off balance as he grabbed Cas and captured his mouth in a kiss. Cas made a deep noise in the back of his throat and leaned into it, opening his mouth to let Dean in while his hands found their way beneath layers of clothes to dig fingers into the dip of Dean's back.
Rufus laughed. “Even if you manage to chase us off, you think we’re the only ones who know you’re here? And with what you’ve got in that house of yours, you’re sitting ducks. Always will be.”
“Well, I wasn’t expecting that,” Afriel said, glancing around the room at the hunters like they were all in on a joke.
Cas’ body was motionless even as the wings continued their undulant movements around them, and Dean could feel the rise and fall of his chest slowing as if he was holding his breath. He knew how the guy felt—Dean’s heart was pounding so hard it was threatening to crack his breastbone.
Cas still technically had his own room, but Dean opted to fold up Cas’ new clothes and put them in the dresser in his room, the one they’d been sharing. He hung up white dress shirts (Dean had grabbed a couple of those on their run, too, still finding it hard to imagine Cas in anything but) and used one of the fancy wooden hangers for his trench coat—discoloured with Abaddon goo, but wearable after Dean had spent a few hours soaking and scrubbing it with a toothbrush. It would never be perfect, but it was wearable, and Dean secretly thought the faded splatters looked pretty badass.
It was wet and messy and imperfect, and all around him Dean could feel the soft strokes of those feathers—a stark contrast to the solid weight of Cas’ hands as they moved from his hips to press into his back. And as the exploratory touches brushed over him, they left behind more of that delicate, heady scent. Dean’s body felt damp with it.
the wrong idea,” Afriel added. “Castiel, could you really?” she asked, a lightness to her voice that Dean wanted to choke out of her.
“One engraved stone tablet. Uncovered at an archeological dig in Iran, retrieved by Elder Richard Roman. Multiple civilian casualties reported at site. Age of artifact unknown. Purpose unknown. Language unknown. Suspected metaphysical intendment. 1981. Storeroom 6, shelf 2B.” Dean stepped back, eyes already crossed from deciphering the small handwriting.
“Good idea.” He put the whiskey on the table, the bottle a little lighter than it had been, and reached to turn out the dim light between them.
“So, today was something,” he said aloud, more to get it off his chest than to start a conversation.
Henry lifted his hands off the arms of his chair in a pretentious shrug. “She was stealing souls, turning innocent people into demons to, we assumed, build her army. Then she came here, looking for the very same thing you’re after.” He stood up and grabbed a leather-bound journal off of a shelf against the wall. “It’s all documented here,” he said, handing the journal to Cas.
There was a knock on the door, but before he could answer it opened, and Cas was standing there at the foot of his bed.
“Sammy,” Dean said, slapping his hand away from the machine. “Tomorrow you can have all the quiet you want. You can even wear that bitchy little look on your face all day. But tonight, we’re gonna enjoy some R n’ R. Drink?”
Sam hurried back into the room and leaned Dean back up to take his shirt off, wincing at the bruises that were already spreading across his torso.
Dean reached his arm into the back seat. “Cas, water.” He twisted the cap off with his teeth after Cas placed a bottle in his hand.
Dean could hear his brother’s heavy, measured breaths beside him, Sam staying carefully focused on the scene in front of them.
“What’s wrong, Ruf?” he called gruffly. “Your Band of Merry Men didn’t expect to go up against my buddy, here? And… merry women,” he quickly added.
“I know you’re not the sleeping type,” Dean says quietly, “but I need to catch some z’s before tomorrow.”
“Well, that’s settled,” Dean said, hesitating for a second before he reached to clap Cas on the shoulder. It was the first time they’d touched since Cas held his face—for medical purposes, Dean reminded himself. But he hated that he had to second guess something that had come so naturally before he fucked everything up.
“Yeah,” Sam said, like he couldn’t believe it. He twisted to look at the space where Cas had collapsed. “Did Cas—?”
Bobby focused his eyes on Dean. “Sure thing, son. Do what you gotta do,” he said, without stepping away to clear Dean’s path to the door.
Henry looked between the two boys with bemused curiosity, but remained silent. He walked over to the window and pushed aside the heavy red curtain casting a square of sunlight into the dark room. “If I wasn’t merely a projection of Henry Winchester, we might have had a touching family moment,” he said, turning to look at them.
He crossed into the west side of the park, the area that suffered a lot more damage than where they’d managed to find someplace livable. It was row after row of nothing more than the scorched bones of places families had once lived or come to stay on weekends. He stepped over a few deflated pool toys and thought, not for the first time, about the kids who were here when whatever happened happened. They’d come across a few bodies during their stay, but luckily hadn’t found anyone they thought might have been a child. A couple of suicides, a couple of unknowns. They’d left them where they lay, searching around them and trying not to disturb much, but still taking anything they found that they could use.
“Wait, sweetheart, wait,” Dean finally gasped. He was too close to the edge, and although this was the first time they’d gotten here and there was no reason to rush, he needed it too badly to stop himself from saying it. “Put your fingers in me.”
As Dean blinked and sat up on his elbow, Cas’ hands slid away from his middle, a thumb gently running over the spot where Aaron’s blade had cut him open before the touch left him entirely.
“Found something,” he said, holding a pack of ramen noodles, a single bottle of Gatorade, and two cans of spaghetti.
He took a breath and looked to the back of the trailer. Willing himself to move, he did, just to shut Sam up. Standing outside of the room, Dean raised his hand to knock, but stopped, dreading what was on the other side. If it had been open—a black void at the end of a dim hallway—he’d be fine. Instead, he had to announce his presence, ask to come in, and face rejection.
Cas’ lips were dry, and although the kiss was chaste, Dean could still feel a flush creeping up his neck. He rested his hands on Cas’ waist and angled his head to taste more, to push deeper into Cas’ mouth—but the angel stepped back.
Sam stayed in the library as Cas, Dean, and Bobby went back to their physical search. Shelf after shelf of dusty old relics, weird pendants, and unassuming chairs that wanted to kill you. They moved faster today, finding their rhythm after the disastrous results of the day before. It was quicker with three people, easier, and although the room they started seemed massive and looming when they first walked in, they got through it pretty quickly. Still nothing that Cas could confirm was any sort of demon tablet, though. Nothing that even came close to looking like one.
Sam looked as tired as he did the day before but his face was already buried back in the ledger, eyes darting across the page and back like he was watching a slow tennis match.
They ended up taking the case, leaving Bobby at the bunker to man the radio while Sam, Dean, and Cas drove up to Falls City and helped clear out the nest of ghouls without a hitch. It was Cas’ first case without his grace, and although Dean was worried about bringing him along, it turned out he had no reason to be.
“Yes. I believe I have something you’re looking for.” He turned and walked towards the back of the bar, to a bookshelf none of them had bothered to notice. Tilting one of the volumes, the shelf swung open and Henry disappeared into the space revealed behind it.
“Well, whatever you like, I’m sure it’s crap,” Dean muttered, reaching over and ruffling Sam’s stupid, long hair.
Dean climbed into the driver’s seat, and as he slammed the door behind him, he knew exactly what kind of look Sam was giving Cas.
His pulse felt supercharged at the touch, like his blood was thrumming twice as fast and burning twice as hot as it moved through his body. He grabbed Cas to crush the angel’s mouth against his own, licking back inside and meeting Cas’ hips against where he was helplessly grinding against him. As Cas slid his hands over the curve of his ass and pushed them even closer together, Dean moaned around Cas’ tongue.
It was late. Hard to tell how late, but enough time had passed that Dean’s arm was falling asleep where it was trapped under the body lying beside him. Once Cas had started to calm down he’d lost his energy—hit with that post-big-feelings exhaustion that Dean knew too well. Dean had leaned him down into the pillows as the angel rested and got himself a little stuck. So, he’d stayed.
“What, no—,” he started to protest, but gave up, lacking the energy to add more plaster to the wall in his head that was falling into total disrepair. He blinked into the smoke as the wind changed, making his eyes water. “I’m into girls, I just like Cas more,” he said.
They both knew medicine wouldn’t do a damn thing. They’d seen this before plenty over the last few months. Radiation sickness, Dean thought, acid burning his throat.
But as he moved to close the distance between them, Cas dropped down to his chest, kissing his way down the taught planes of his stomach. He paid special attention to the dip of Dean’s hip, gently digging his teeth into it and sucking at the sensitive skin as he ran his hand up the length of Dean’s cock.
“What’s up, Cas?” Dean asked, putting down the two records he was trying to decide between. “Get it figured out?”
His eyes slipped closed. He couldn’t look at Cas right now, couldn’t take the way he searched his face as Dean bit off quiet moans and ground against Cas’ hand.
The entire front of it was dark wood and black-brown brick and it seemed to loom over the rest of the once-red-and-beige block. Now, the other buildings were as non-descript and empty as this one, but the club still had a weight to it that the others didn’t.
This might be a good time to try to get through that apology he’d started a few days ago, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. It was done. Buried. And as far as he could tell, if he didn’t fuck up too badly again, Cas was going to let it stay dead, too.
Dean’s mouth pulled tight around his teeth. “Nope,” he said, popping the ‘p’ and ending the conversation.
In another place entirely, a man in a blue suit stood amongst the carnage of the men he called brothers. His hands stuck to the wooden box he held, the blood coating it drying thick and dark.
“Dean, you chose freedom. You refused to be ruled by fate, and I believe that’s something worth fighting for. Even now.”
“Aaron, no!” the man at the window yelled. Cas gestured with his arm and Aaron flew across the room, hitting a wall. The knife dropped and so did he. He was too weak, too sick, and he collapsed in a bony heap with the power of the impact.
Making this chapter deadline in the nick of time. The curse of the COVID-era... sometimes it's difficult to remember what the hell day it is.
Sam's eyes brighten and focus- whatever he has seen in Dean's mind comforts him where he had meant to comfort Dean. "You should try praying," he says unexpectedly, voice creaking with disuse. "It won't work if it's not you that's praying."
The trailer they chose had three solid walls, close to four. Most of the master bedroom in the back had been burned away, but with the tools they’d brought with them from Bobby’s, they managed to grab enough scrap metal and pink insulation from around the park to patch up the worst of the damage. It was still cold as hell back there, and the bathroom was unusable, but they had somewhere to bunker down for a few nights.
“Alright buddy, rub it in,” Dean said, as he and Sam grabbed some of the bags from Cas’ arms and pushed their way inside.
Dean looked over at Bobby. The brim of his hat was pulled down so Dean couldn’t see his face, and Dean took this as a signal to get off the floor to help survey the damage to the house.
Inside, it was pitch black. They pulled out their flashlights to try and get a better look but it was hard to piece it all together in the small circles of light. They could see ancient computers with all sorts of buttons and dials, a typewriter, a radio. Outdated communication tools the Men of Letters would have used to run dispatch on their operation, Dean guessed.
“I just wanted to, you know, say I’m sorry for being just a jerk the other day. Kinda covered that in the prayer but, uh, here it is in person, too.” He tried to keep his eyes on Cas’, but his attention kept getting pulled to the wings like he was stuck in their orbit. They were so ethereal it was hard to understand how they could even exist somewhere as dull and three-dimensional as Dean’s bedroom.
“But those men, good men, died for nothing. I escaped with the help of a colleague and hid the key.”
Cas stayed quiet for a moment. He rolled his shoulders and lifted a hand to knead at the sore muscles in his neck before dropping it back in his lap in defeat.
Dean’s shins were warmed by the flames, intensifying the chill he felt around his shoulders. He pulled his jacket in across his chest and held it closed.
“I’ve been shot,” Cas answered weakly, his voice hoarse. Dean let out a sob that almost turned into a desperate laugh as he pressed his lips against Cas’ temple.
They stopped at a few of the cars stopped on the side of the highway as they drove, but they’d already been hit, tanks drained.
And as for Cas' outburst... It's not easy going through angel-to-human puberty. So many feels. And when all you've got is Dean Winchester to rely on for emotional cues, it might take you a second to figure it out.
Cas looked around at the cold cement walls and dirt-covered floor. There were cobwebs hanging from every corner of the ceiling and the naked bulb that hung in the middle of the room cast an ever-moving, sickly glow over them both.
Cas launched off the dresser and spun them around. Dean felt himself being hauled onto the wooden surface as Cas gripped his thighs pulled them apart so he could push between Dean’s legs. Dean bit back a groan and wrapped his arms around Cas’ shoulders, dragging him closer and deepening the kiss—breathing in and tasting and surrounded by Cas.
Dean was still struggling to catch his breath when a hand fisted into his hair and pulled his head back. Cas was leaning over him, his knees bent and tucked against Dean’s sides, and blue eyes were locked on Dean’s as he stroked himself above him.
“What do you expect? It’s exactly what Lucifer wanted,” Turiel replied, sullen. He felt, not sympathy, but something for the fallen planet.
“No. Not bad. But we should hurry. There was no one on the other side of the bridge, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t people in the area. Like I said, my senses are fuzzy on Earth.”
Sam scoffed and took a deep breath like he was trying to stop himself from saying something he’d regret. “You get he’s an angel, right? Wings are kinda part of the deal. I know you don’t like talking about it, but I can’t tell whether you’re more freaked out by angel Cas or human Cas.”
for doing what you needed to do.” Dean searched his face, looking for any sort of sign he believed him. He let go of his wrists and leaned against the car instead, crossing his arms over his mist-damp jacket. He fucking hated angels.
Sam's head falls forward unable to hold it up on his own. Jhudiel walks around him and pushing his chin up with the tip of his knife. "One little word, Sam. It's all we want from you. Just one little word."
His laugh is wet, sticky with desperation, as he raises a hand to Sam cheek and grins. “You’ll say yes. The plan will go through as
He smiles again, leaning down to kiss her forehead. "And us," Dean's necklace hangs down from his shirt.
“I thought we were most especially not gonna talk about this?” Dean shoots Sam his patented "conversation over" look, ignoring hands trying to yank at his mouth.
"We tried to save her..." Remiel's voice is rough, distant. He's still hunched over by the couch, his eyes closed. "Don't think we didn't try."
Sam blushes instantly, he can't help it. He's torn between utter mortification that he actually did it and a sort of breathless tingly anticipation for what Gabriel will say next. But it's quiet, except for the crinkle of paper being pressed into his hand with tangled fingers. He doesn't want to look at it, even though he's got the angel practically wrapped around him there's still that chance that... that he's still being played with. But he's a grown up damn it, and he did leave the note. He asked for this without explanations so he damn well better...
A moment passes while Sam fidgets and then Gabriel steps across the wards and hauls Barachiel to his feet. "Come on, get up."
Gabriel presses his lips together, watching the wards glimmer and shift around the perimeter of the salvage yard. He thinks of Sam begging and threatening to have his brother back; of Dean willing to go to hell in trade of his little brother's life. "Dean Winchester would die before fighting or killing Sam."
"I only knew because Gabriel told me. As to how Gabriel knew, that is information best gleaned from Sam or Gabriel," Castiel says after a moment's pause. "You were happy, Dean, at peace. I did not want to disturb that. I had thought I'd have more time to tell you."
"Okay," Sam looks up as Gabriel starts talking, "Here's the deal. We can't teleport out of here. So we're stuck until we figure out what the hell is going on. Good chance is that they're holding sigils that are keeping us in. A worse theory is that they're using our own wards against us. Which means we can't get out unless we give them a way in, otherwise known as the world's shittiest siege."
"Gabriel told him. Gabriel... he woke me up from it," the words leave Sam in a rush. "I've been... I've been having dreams about Lucifer. No, not about him, really I guess. He shows up in them. The first time he was... he was.... he was wearing Jess and he..." Sam trails off closing his eyes for a moment.
"We do not mean to be a imposition on you, Robert," Castiel says, trying to keep his hold on the baby. She stretching her hand out for Dean, as if she thinks if Castiel lets go she can just
Dean moves his arm and lifts his head. "Cas," there's something bitter and sharp edged about Dean's tone. It cuts at Castiel, and makes his grace clench in his chest... or maybe that's his heart. "I really don't want to talk to you for awhile."
Elle, of course, picks that moment to wake up. "Bottle?" she asks tugging at Cas' shirt as she squirms into a sitting position. Then, still half asleep with her hair sticking up, demands, "Daddy, where Bear-Bear?"
It’s a baby angel, curled up in a pile of plaid blankets with messy white-blond hair and a set of wings that were more grey downy fluff than anything else.
"And don't do the angels don't eat bit. Cas already did that, but I'm not trying to find a place open at two am because missy there is hungry and screaming her head off. Sam's also getting sunglasses."
“Oh no, no way am I going to tell Bobby I have a magical angel love baby,” Dean stands and starts pacing. Sam’s sure his brother hasn’t noticed that he’s doing it.
Sam shakes his head, “That’s because you freaked him out and when he’s freaked out he gets stressed and when he’s stressed, he yells.”
Sam rolls his eyes and makes what Dean's calls a 'bitchface' at Dean. "Good morning to you too, Dean. Morning Cas, morning Bobby." He strokes a hand over Elle's hair. "Morning, Elle."
"Oi! Who says? Maybe I was gonna ask him how his day went, eh? Or how he slept?" Barachiel's eyebrows raise in the customary lewd gesture and Anna rolls her eyes.
Castiel goes to pull away but Dean's refuses to let go. "Why not? You don't want her!" he hisses back.
He enters the room the wail is coming from and finds Mendel holding the fledgling. This isn't, though, the human child they'd taken from that traitorous fledgling of Gabriel's and the stubborn righteous man. It could be Castiel when he was first delivered into Gabriel's care, when he still wailed in fright at Michael. She's shadow and light but instead of wings of shadows her tiny wings are molten chrome, which is splattered all over the room. She wails, crying in Angelic and English for her fathers, for her uncles.
“Atta boy, Sammy!” Dean called, walking over to help his brother. He could feel Cas’ eyes on his back the whole way over which made the few yards feel like a few hundred.
Dean looked over at Sam and Bobby and they looked back at him silently—unwilling to get in the middle of an angelic dick-measuring contest, but willing to stand up for Cas if it seemed like he needed it.
“Dean,” Cas deadpanned, not buying the act. “You’ve been keeping your distance from me,” he continued, because grace or not, he’d always be an Angel-who-was-too-forward-for-his-own-good. “Is it because of the spell?”
“Thank you, Charlie,” he said quietly into her ear. Stepping back, he said, “If you’re ever in Lebanon, look me up. Do you have a pen?” She handed him a Sharpie from her pocket and he grabbed her hand to write a set of numbers on her palm. “We’ll keep our radio set at this frequency, so if you got a ham, you got us.”
“They’re not exactly subtle,” he said instead. “You can’t go out in public like that—you look like a Halloween store reject.”
Thank you to my immaculate Beta Tardimaid who is and remains to be the most patient and talented Beta possibly off all time. (Actually, nope, definitely of all time).
He felt so fucking selfish, threatening a friendship that had seen him through the apocalypse, through so many ends of the world it was almost impossible to track. How could he ask more from a man who fought and died beside him… died for him?
“Stay back,” Cas yelled into the room. The flashlight had come to a stop against a wall, casting a sickly glow on the crumpled man who had attacked Dean. The rest of the group, in a panic, rushed towards them.
Dean could feel beads of sweat roll down his spine. His mouth was thick with the sickly-sweet aftertaste of his breakfast and the fumes of last night’s dinner.
“You’d have a shit ton of nickels and still nowhere to spend ‘em. It’s dangerous. We’re doing this together.”
Dean filled his own small cup again then moved to pass the bottle to his brother, half-standing to reach over Cas, whose eyes widened in drunken surprise as he got a face-full of canvas jacket.
Cas answered by grabbing the sides of Dean’s face and pushing their mouths together, showing him he could want, that Cas wanted. Dean made a small sound of disbelief before bringing his hands up to pull Cas forward by his shirt, dragging the angel on top of him as he laid back on the bed like he belonged there.
They all sat down to eat at the long table in the library, preferring the more comfortable chairs there to the hard, unmoving stools attached to the table in the kitchen. They hadn’t talked about it since that night—about Dean kissing Cas like he was the only thing in the whole damn universe that mattered—and he wasn’t sure Bobby and Sam would ever expect him to say anything about it, and he appreciated that. It made things easier.
“Get it your damn selves,” Bobby muttered, still brushing dust off of his jacket as Sam bent over to pick it up.
“The food is rotten,” Cas said, picking up a container that may have at one point held croissants, but was now just a plastic box filled with something moldy and green. “It smells foul in here. Dead.”
He saw Cas reach forward and grab their shoulders, and suddenly they were back on the worn porch of the familiar blue house. And as quickly as Cas disappeared after depositing them here, he returned with armfuls of their supplies from the back of the Honda.
The hand ran up his neck and Dean felt Cas’ grace cool the throb that had settled in his head and between his shoulders.
Dean felt someone grabbing at him, and he called Cas’ name hoping his voice was loud enough, already too far gone to fight back. Cas pulled the attacker away and turned the power of his grace on the group, and as white light filled the room, the deafening sound of smashing glass and the screams of the strangers rang as their eyes burnt out of their skulls and they dropped to the ground.
The rest of the group said their goodbyes, and when they were finally ready to go, Charlie flashed them all the Vulcan salute. “Peace out, bitches,” she said, watching as they turned to head over to the cars.
He was enjoying his coffee more than he should, so he stood up before he was done and left the shop with nothing more than the quiet sound of the bell tinkling overhead. If anyone watched him go, he didn’t see it.
“Make him better,” and nothing in his tone said both men would leave the room alive if Cas didn’t comply.
Cas’ face darkened but he didn’t say anything. Dean fought back a smile as Cas marched over to him and wrapped his arm back around Dean’s waist.
“Hey. Did you do this?” Dean asked, pointing to the symbol drawn on the windshield when Cas finally got to him.
“I’m not a stranger. I told you, I’m Charlie. And you’re Sam, and you’re Dean. Who’s tall, dark, and handsome over there? And who’s the guy in the trench coat?”
When he was done, he ducked back into Charlie’s tent towel-drying his hair, draping it back where it had been hanging when he was finished. She was cooking some kind of meat over the fire but he didn’t look too closely at what it was.
“You know, the things I heard about him, I thought he’d be meaner,” Afriel said, scratching at the tight scar tissue that ran up her neck.
Dean answered by whispering Cas’ name again and again against his skin. He started shivering, not from the cold, when Cas grabbed his belt loops to pull their hips even closer together.
He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands and gave himself about five seconds to try and relax before reaching to the table to grab the bottle and lift it to his mouth.
With a groan of old metal, the passenger door slammed closed, and looking in his mirrors Dean realized he was the only one still sitting in a car. The other three men were already gathered together on the otherwise empty sidewalk.
“What the hell, Sam?” Dean said, surprised at his brother’s candour. Sam just shrugged his shoulders, like he hadn’t known what else to say.
“Ammo?” Dean leaned back in the chair to try and take some pressure off his ribs and looked at his brother skeptically. “You’re usually more creative than this, Sammy.”
“An Aquarian Star,” Sam said, resting his hand on the hood of the car. So, not a hexagram. Dean shot a smartass look at Bobby. “It’s an occult symbol, but variations of it have been adopted by different religions.” He stopped, trailing off before he was wracked by another coughing fit. It sounded wet, and painful, and Dean wasn’t sure if the liquid Sam wiped off into the crook of his elbow was saliva or blood. “Who put it here?” he gasped around ragged breaths.
Afterwards, with the taste of Cas still on his tongue, they said goodbye to Eileen, Kevin, and the rest, and if Dean noticed the way Sam looked at Eileen before they left—and he did—he tried not to give his little brother too hard a time about it.
“You’re lying,” Cas said suddenly, glowering at Henry. “The Knights of Hell were eradicated by the archangels.”
Dean climbed under the covers and Cas stayed on top, but as he drifted to sleep with Cas’ warm weight against his back, he couldn’t help but feel content.
It had only been a few minutes, not long enough to worry, but Dean got up anyway, muttering something about checking on Cas and stuffing the Colt in the waistband of his jeans. He sped up the stairs and as he opened the door of the bunker the chill and harsh light of the world outside almost pushed him back inside.
Cas finally arched up into him. The light in the room flickered as his body shuddered and he spilled hot and messy across the button-up he was still wearing.
“This vessel isn’t built to support the additional weight, and it feels like my grace is getting torn between the astral and the physical realms. It’s making it difficult for me to heal properly.” He sighed, and his body language—withdrawn, worn-out—was so different from the calm strength of the feathers that it really was as if he’d been split in two.
“The way I see it, Dean,” Rufus said, scratching his patchy beard with the back of his gloved hand, “Out there,” he motioned to the broken-down yard behind them, “we die. But here, even if we have to shoot through you and your boyfriend, we might not.”
Without another word, they climbed out of the Impala. Dean took a second to crack his back before joining the group where they stood in the road between the two cars.
That’s when Dean noticed that where the beam shone across the dirt-matted tiles, there was a dark puddle still spreading across the floor. The sour smell of decay hid the tang of iron, but there was too much of it, and it was too fresh. Something had just killed… something.
“Alright. Let’s do it,” Dean said, squinting into his coffee. There was something floating in there. He swore quietly when he burned his finger struggling to drag whatever it was against the side of the mug.
As they were rolling down the desolate highway, Dean still felt pretty good despite the depressing scenery. It felt right to finally be moving.
Dean heard Sam make his huffy little noise, the one he made when his brain was working overtime to solve a puzzle.
I know I know. Dean's a real jerk. but at the end of the day, protecting Sammy is something he will always prioritize over everything—even if it comes at the expense of relationships that are good for him.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Bobby said, rubbing his side and remembering the pain of getting the engravings. “Wish that had been an option for us.”
The car clicked off as Sam reached over the seats to turn off the engine, the sudden quiet pulled their attention away from each other.
“I like the way you taste.” He pulled down the waistband of Dean’s jeans and opened his mouth to bite at the sensitive skin he found there, sucking until the surface was wet and crimson and then scraping his teeth over the mark.
“Take off your shirt,” Cas said. It wasn’t a request, it was a command, and Dean pulled the t-shirt over his head and let it drop to the floor.
“What the hell, Sam?” he asked, worried, passing the water to his brother. Sam drank deeply, gasping for breath afterwards, but settled down.
His jaw was slack, mouth practically hanging open, and when he finally looked up at Cas, he saw blue eyes staring back at him, curious and studying. His blown-out pupils were the first sign Dean had that Cas was as affected by this as he was.
Another huge shout out to Tardimaid, my stunning and glorious Beta, who was elemental in bringing this piece of the story come to life (and every other piece, if we're being honest).
Afriel was already distracted pouring sugar on the table from the glass dispenser, watching the tiny piles peak and collapse. The rest of them shifted in their seats, except Cas, who sat unmoving like he was made of marble.
“Who the fuck are you?” Dean barked at the figure standing in shadows on the other side of the road.
Fixing the door had taken up a pretty big part of the day, and after bringing Sam some food and something to drink, Dean spent the rest of his time wandering around the park, avoiding Cas, and looking for something to kill.
is not an option,” Turiel spat. “You would sacrifice the lives of your brothers and sisters—for what? For this reeking planet?”
“No, we were waiting for you to rest up. Needed that gargantuan brain of yours to help us figure it out.” He dug the heels of his boots in the dirt, noticing a crack in the leather at the bend of his foot. Frankly, Dean couldn’t believe his brother remembered any of their conversation about the symbol drawn on the Impala. It seemed like it had taken place about a hundred years ago even though it’d been less than a week.
Dean woke up to someone banging on their door. He really wished he’d gotten a little more sleep—or at least more time to relax in a real bed.
It took a few days, but they got the cars packed. Bobby’s Chevelle and the Impala were filled as much as classic cars could be without the bumpers dragging. They were all on edge, waiting for the alarms Sam had reset to go off again, so they focused on pulling out Bobby’s most valuable books, weapons, and stocks out of their dusty corners. Although that all came secondary to packing the food and water they’d gathered over the weeks.
When they pulled up to the curb, Cas turned to look out of the window at the house beside them. Dean crowded against Cas, leaning into his personal space to get a better look.
“We should get started,” Cas said simply, but he said it low, like it was coming from his chest. He still wasn’t looking at the hunter, instead choosing to poke at the fire. He pulled the charred pot of bubbling water out of the flames and carefully poured it into two mugs sitting on the chair beside him. After stirring the muddy coffee with a spoon that probably shouldn’t be used in anything meant for human consumption, he finally looked up to pass the mug to Dean.
“Tell me to stop, and I will.” He sounded like smoke, but his eyes were penetrating and clear as he looked down at Dean who just nodded, reaching up to get Cas’ mouth back on his own.
