Dean straightens up from the engine of a 1960 Camry and tosses the rag on a chair. "Yeah, sure, what's up?"
"Jesus." Sam's quiet anger has simmered into disgust.
So, being twenty-six, alone, desperate for attention, Dean knows that it would have meant the world for someone like Cas - and, really, there is no one else quite like Cas - to have offered him something so unconditional. It would have meant everything. It would have changed him.
to take care of your brother, it was so clear you loved him more than anything. You were so full of love you were damn near bursting with it. And even though I was a cantankerous old bastard with a hunter's calcified heart, I loved you like a son the moment you were dropped on my doorstep. You cared so much. It's not right that you were forced to be a caretaker, but your love was so bright. It always has been. You're a fool, don't get me wrong, but I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of my boys. Any father would be. It's a privilege to have helped raise you and Sam." Bobby pretends to take a sip of his coffee, but Dean can see that he's choked up. "Anyhow, what I'm saying is, if there's anyone out there who can return the kind of love I've seen in you, then it just might be someone who's given up everything, over and over, just to save you. You deserve love, Dean. And I sure don't give a damn if that love comes wrapped in a trench coat. It don't make a lick of difference far as I'm concerned."
Sam tosses the boy up in the air and catches him against his chest, making him giggle again. He kisses the side of his face, unbearably gentle and sweet.
Dean ignores this - it’s true, but Sam didn’t need to tell Hank that. “You served, didn’t you?”
Cas is quiet for a moment, his nose nuzzled into the crook of Dean’s neck. They’ve finished washing by this point, but the water pressure is perfect and the heat soaks almost all the way into Dean’s bones like this, so he makes no move to get out. He can feel Cas’ thighs against the backs of his legs, surprisingly strong thighs that Dean’s not really over marveling at. He’ll probably never be over just looking at Cas, truth be told.
“Guess I just wish you were here. I… I always wish you were here. Felt that way when you were alive too, so maybe it’s not that different. You were always leaving, and I was always letting you. I’m sorry. Fuck. I’m so sorry, Cas.”
Sam doesn't believe he was John's favorite, not really, but he understands why Dean has that idea drilled deep in him.
“He’s not. You are one of the most intelligent men I know.”
Cas shrugs. “I don’t know,” he says. “I don’t understand what Crowley did, so I don’t know what the limitations are.”
It's Dean who makes their first breakthrough. He does it in the trademark Winchester way, dumb fucking luck. He's flicking idly through a brochure for an art museum in Venice, not really expecting to find anything, but not really sober enough to be reading anything more challenging.
“Nah, I think that ship’s sailed. Besides, I got my shot with you, didn’t I?”
Jack had looked at him blankly. "Did you want to go fishing or something?"
“That doesn’t mean that it wasn’t exploitation of your situation, Dean. You don’t have to think of it this way if you don’t want to, but just because you were forced to choose among bad options, and even though you may have been compensated for that choice, it doesn’t mean that it wasn’t a violation. I’m not telling you how to frame your experiences - I don’t want to write your narrative for you. But I do want you to understand that you don’t have to blame yourself for the things you did in order to survive as a child. It’s not your fault.”
"No, not exactly. But we did get him, Dean. The demon who killed mom, his name was Azazel. About a year after dad's death, you're the one who kills him."
"So, what, he's a carbon copy or something?" Older Dean sounds disgusted and Dean feels himself bristling. "What the hell are we supposed to do with him if we can't send him back?"
John pushes him hard against the wall. Another blow lands on his arm. And then one to his gut. Dean doubles over, putting up his hands simultaneously.
Sam and Cas, pressed into either side of him. His boys, each in their own way. His little family. Sometimes it was a weight, the way Sam and Cas both seemed to look to Dean like he was their salvation. But sometimes it was this - Dean being the rock they leant towards.
Dean shifts on the bed, the mattress creaking slightly. "I don't know. Non-binary, maybe? Or… agender? Christ, Cas, I don't know what the words are. I just thought maybe that's what you were trying to say and I blew you off."
Dean sniffs and runs the cleaner part of his wrist over his nose. He tries to wipe the dirt off his hands but they stay grimy, and anyway, it doesn't matter. Everything's going back in the ground after all. He lifts the jacket out of the bag, careful with it.
"You're welcome," Cas says, formal and unironic. He takes a seat a couple chairs down from Dean and, to Dean's surprise, pours a glass of whiskey for himself.
"I'm grieving too." Sam's voice over the roof of the Impala is quiet. "I think we need to at least acknowledge it, or…"
When Sam pulls his eyes from his red tea - too light, too aromatic to be blood - young Dean is looking at him with a bewildered expression.
Dean points double finger-guns at him. "Looks like I don't need you to life-coach me through everything, Frasier. Told you I was coping."

They spend the next few days talking an awful lot about trees. This seems to be an exciting development for Cas, who appears to have a near encyclopedic knowledge about arboriculture. Eileen, who sticks around for the morning after Charlie’s visit, is also interested in the topic of trees as a matter of religious importance.
"Nothing." Sam seems to be restraining himself for a moment before he breaks. "It's just, you know, one time we had to wear "salmon" colored shirts to blend in with a company uniform working a job, and afterwards you burned them both because you didn't even want to look at the color on me. And one time in Ohio, that girl gave me a pink tie for Christmas, remember? And you said -"
“What?” Dean says, because someone has to.
and just, he couldn't. He couldn't deal with it then, and he can't deal with it now, but running off into the park doesn't seem like a real option and he's not gonna punch Sam this time.
. Always
, but it’s implied. He’s pretty sure Cas hears it. “And I still… I don’t know. I might die in two days, so…”
There are motorcycles too, neatly lined up in rows. Some of them old enough that Dean doesn't even know the year or make.
"I haven't seen them all, but Dean liked everything except the last in the trilogy. Apparently they jumped the shark on that one."
"Are you… are you purposefully misquoting Avril Lavigne lyrics at me right now?"
It's Sam leaving him for Ruby, Dean echoing their father's words to him and Sam walking out that door anyway.
Sam laughs. "Yeah. It's basically a mini computer in your pocket. You can make calls and send texts." Sam points to two of the nonsensical icons on his screen. "But you can also use the internet, Google, email, all of it."
Eileen pulls Dean into a quick hug once his arms are free of her son. “Hello boys, come on in. Sam’s in the kitchen.”
"After Sammy woke up, I couldn't get him to stop crying. I thought maybe he was hungry, I sure was, so dad went out to the store to pick up baby formula." Dean had forgotten about this part but he remembers now. He laughs bitterly and rubs the back of his neck. "He, uh, he came back with baby formula and two six packs. It took him two days to think about food."
“So, you think…?” Sam trails off into a question, not quite asking it.
“But that shouldn’t be possible,” the poor botany graduate student kept saying, poking at all the plants that were absolutely not supposed to grow in the mountains of Wyoming.
"What? You didn't think he was hot?"
was. But you wouldn’t go, and I couldn’t stay anymore. I couldn’t. Tell me you understand that now.” Sam’s voice drops off into pleading at the end.
“Yeah, okay, can you hold on a sec?"
"Use mine instead," Cas offers. He takes out a similar phone and slides it across the table, offering them both a little shrug. "I barely know how to use it anyway. The only person likely to call me is Jack, and he's out of range for a couple more days."
Dean pours himself a cup of black coffee and ignores the glass of smoothie Sam set aside for him. He sits down across from Sam, all purposeful nonchalance, and only then glances at his brother's face.
Dean is ashamed, too, of the way he spoke to Cas, of the hot twist of jealousy in his gut that Cas was defending his younger self. There's too much to unpack there: the painful fear he's been trying to squash that Cas and Sam will realize that younger Dean is a less fucked up version and want to keep him, the pang of envy that Cas might want his younger self and that younger Dean might even be capable of wanting him back, and the unbearable feeling Dean has when he thinks about what it might have been like if he'd met Cas when he was younger.
The irony in this is not lost on him. To realize that he
“I do not think you are an idiot, first of all,” Cas says. He’s always standing too close to Dean, never quite grasping the concept of personal space. At this point, Dean just kind of allows it.
For a moment, Dean feels all the old familiar spiking of dread, the anticipation that he’s about to have to fight, that he’s about to have to fix things, to rescue Cas from this. But Bobby’s just looking at him calmly, sipping his beer.
started ringing too loud in his head. He drowned it out with alcohol and a desperate promise that he'd deal with it when they got Cas back. No point in handling all that pain if he was going to pull Cas out of the empty. He'd been operating in a semi-fugue state, carefully grounding his thoughts in
Sam was sort of bowled over by the moment he was witnessing. He knew, yeah, and it wasn’t like he’d walked in on them having sex or even kissing, but it was just so… tender. Dean was in profile to the doorway where Sam stood, and he wasn’t smiling, but Sam could see how relaxed his brother’s face was. It made a lump rise in Sam’s throat.
“I swear to god, if you tell me that I’m just a kid, I’m going to punch you,” Dean snaps. “We were never kids. You fucking know that. And I’m twenty-six, okay, it’s not like I haven’t already seen shit.”
Dean shrugged, tapping his thumb twice on the back of Cas' hand. He hadn't even let go when they'd reached the kiosk, which, really, was progress.
Sam smiles at his brother, grateful and still full of nerves, bouncing a little on his feet. "Thanks. It's not just that, though. They've offered me a full-ride, full-tuition and board and everything for all four years."
Dean closes his eyes again and mentally takes stock. His head doesn't feel too bad, considering he'd had his face bashed by the flatside of a shovel and his skull slammed into the floor. Not too bad at all. He touches his face gingerly with the fingertips of his left hand. There's a little tenderness and swelling that tells him he'll have some bruises, but, hey, nothing new there. Dean cut his teeth on bruises.
Dean is
Dean comes around and leans over Sam's shoulder. Somehow, after everything, this Sam still manages to smell like his brother. It's weirdly comforting.
Dean has to drive all the way out to some bougie hippy "natural foods" store he wouldn't normally be caught dead in, just to find the right ingredients for the summoning ritual. The very cute curly-haired cashier named Liz flirts with him, and Dean flirts back, an easy routine he can fall back into. When he gets back to the Impala he realizes she's written her number on the back of his receipt.
There's something both familiar and
Crowley twists his hand, the stool in the corner of the room comes skidding across the floor, breaking through the outer circle of the devil’s trap, and he’s gone. The scent of sulphur lingers in the air.
Dean hears his past self's voice break on Cas' name, reaching for his face where he's slumped in that chair, an undeniable hole in his chest from the angel blade. If Dean wasn't locked down somewhere unreachable in his body, he thinks blandly, he might be embarrassed by his own obvious desperation.
"Want to talk about it? No. Thanks for shutting me up. Know it tears up Sam."
"You gonna eat, man?"
Dean doesn’t know why it’s still so hard. He gets frustrated with himself that he has to force the words out. Cas deserves better, deserves to hear that Dean loves him every day for the rest of their lives together, if that’s what he wants, if that what really makes him happy. Dean has to duck down and scratch Captain behind the ears to calm himself, and it’s ridiculous. He’s loved Cas for forever, it feels like. They’ve died for each other. They have a life together, roots together, tying them to each other.
It's one thing to accept that they were in love with each other this whole time, because of course Dean was in love with the stupid bastard. He's known that for a long time, he just never thought it was possible. But it's another thing entirely to actually imagine what that
It’s weird things that trigger Dean now. He hates that word, hates how he knows that his younger self would have talked about “trigger warnings” as a bunch of pansy bullshit. It never gets to him in a fight - maybe it’s the adrenaline, the necessity of the moment, but Dean is damn near unbreakable under stress or pain. So it doesn’t make sense to him, really, that anything less than that could make him lose his grip.
"Last time I tried,  he nearly shot me," Sam admits. "He made me promise not to."
That's the chapter.
As Rhonda leaves them with menus, Dean glances across the table and when older Dean meets his eyes, he knows that for once they are on the same wavelength. Older Dean is hiding his reaction better than Dean, but his shoulders are hunched. He glances at Sam, then back, and shakes his head slightly in answer to Dean's unasked question. Dean relaxes a little and glances at Cas, but he doesn't seem to have noticed anything either. He's frowning at the menu, both hands wrapped around his off-white mug of coffee, and Sam is saying something about "egg-white omelets".
Cas doesn't look up from his printouts. "I know everything," he says mildly.
“Can you be more specific?” Cas said, after struggling with the question for a moment.
"Uh. Is this about to get kinky? Because I'm open-minded, but…"
important.
"Out," Dean says, speedwalking by. He's clutching a paper bag to his chest in a way that he knows is conspicuous, but he can't help it. He's clinging on for just these last few moments.
Sam lets out a long low sigh. “Both of you, Dean. You should both get that.”
"Dad. Please. Just one more day."
"Naw, kind of let the family business become more of a - of a hobby, you might say. Sammy's in social work now and doing great. He and his wife have a kid." Dean lets go of Cas' hand to whip out his phone and pull up a photo of Jude, like the embarrassing proud uncle he is.
It had made him feel crazy, desperate, and utterly helpless.
It’s not like Dean doesn’t know too.
"Cas, don't forget the pie. And… what's that? Sam says to grab him some of those stupid protein drinks. You know the ones. See you in twenty."
Sam's son. Sam as a father. Dean as an uncle.
Dean steps back and sits on the hood of the Impala. "Go on. Take care of your souls."
Cas laughs. “I believe Sam would tell you that’s a very 2005 thing to say.”
It feels, in the worst way, oddly fitting.
Dean doesn’t answer right away. It’s a nice theory. A little too nice. He thinks about Cas saying “Good things do happen, Dean,” on the day they met. Dean hadn’t believed it then, can’t really believe it now. Maybe there’s no Chuck anymore, no force of evil driving a storyline, but that doesn’t mean there’s a force of good, either.
This chapter was originally supposed to be about something else, but the characters literally would not let me write it that way, and to be honest, they were right.
It occurs to Dean around the point where Sam jumps into the pit that he's not sure he's ever actually talked about his life like this. He's never been inclined to give anyone the full synopsis before. Sure, Sam knows, and Cas, mostly, but they were there for most of it. He's never actually had to say it before.
anything.
Dean gets up and follows Sam out into a windowless hallway. It looks like a military base or something and it's kind of really cool. "What the hell is your Dean's problem, anyway? If he's me, then what the fuck does he think I'm going to do?"
Cas sighs. He rests his hands on the rock and leans back, tilting his head up with his eyes closed.
Cas shrugs, like he didn't expect Dean to take him up on the offer.
"You don't get out much do you, huh?" Dean yawns on the last word, covering it with the crook of his arm.
Dean hasn't really thought about the reality of this since he said yes to Sam. He let Cas coax him back into bed not long after their phone call, feeling that at least he was going to do something to deal with the issue soon. Other than that, he threw himself into finishing up the interior of the barn and helping Cas with his truly astonishing horticultural pursuits. Cas was childishly delighted about the success he was having with all of his plants, including a number of species that had no right thriving in the Wyoming climate.
Hear me out on the nurse thing
Dean raises an eyebrow, his face closing off in that way that Sam hates. It's the fucking trauma, he knows, the way Dean's face just shuts down like that sometimes. It's his defense mechanism, cutting things off, pushing them down. That facade of closed off anger is the easiest thing for Dean to reach, even when the threat is just his brother's words. Sam knows, because it's how he feels too sometimes.
"'Course it was about me," Dean snaps. "I mean, Jesus, if I grow up and hate who I was so much, then maybe I'm just-"
"Sammy… don't. Don't do this. Not like this."
"We will," Sam says, his deep level voice full of a certainty that Dean knows he doesn't feel. "We will. But Jack's doing his part, and besides research there's not much we can do right now. So we're gonna take cases, and we're gonna get you de-cursed, and we'll sort out what to do with younger you. And then we'll keep on worrying about… everything else." Sam rakes his hand through his hair and Dean takes a second to examine the creases around his eyes, the lines in his forehead.
Nothing in particular happens for a few days, which feels like a small miracle in itself. Dean reads more about speculation on tree species in Ancient Greece than he ever cared to know, he actually manages to teach Jack how to cook scrambled eggs - which Sam says is a stunning feat of patience - and he gets more sleep than he can ever remember having. Older Dean forces himself to be at least polite around Dean, even if it’s through gritted teeth, and Sam does indeed sit through the rest of the Star Wars cinematic universe with him. Dean finds himself spending a lot of time with Cas - he wasn’t exactly consciously trying to do it, but Cas is always around and older Dean seems more inclined to go off alone with Sam, and Jack disappears for long hours at a stretch. And anyway, Dean likes Cas. It’s sometimes impossible to tell when Cas is being sardonic on purpose, or when he just hasn’t understood Dean’s sarcasm, and Dean finds this unexpectedly charming.
"The absolute worst," Dean mutters, but he reaches across the table and takes Cas' hand almost absently. "Hey. I think you earned it."
I want you to come with me. Come with us."
"I have to go."
"You're not good. Look -"
Cas tries to put a hand on his shoulder and Dean shoves him roughly away.
Dean might be a little in love with him too.
Sam smiles that fond little smile of his. It’s weird, to observe all of these small paternal moments in his little brother, but Dean is glad to witness them. It feels, in some inexplicable way, like redemption.
“It was one thumb.”
Cas’ hand hesitantly brushes his shoulder. It’s the thinnest tether, but Dean grabs on to it, tries to keep himself out of sixteen-year-old Dean’s head as he lays there pliant, breathless, choking beneath John’s tightening hand.
"You've never asked me what I want," Cas said calmly.
“Because, I think…” Cas breaks off. “I’d like to call Garth back.”
Of course, besides Sam, there are two profound absences. Bobby says that Cas and Jack are "around", which is a little infuriating. Dean prays to them sometimes. He doesn't get a response, but he thinks they hear him.
Content warnings in end notes.
"And then all your crap about the Ma'lak box," Sam plows on, ignoring him. "And I don't know what you did when you thought I was dead last time, but I know it was something stupid even if you won't tell me. And now this? Dean, we had a plan. You don't get to throw it away because you're hurting or having a complex about younger you, or because you can't accept how much Cas and Jack and I love you. We need you. I fucking need you. You don't get to come out here and wait to get offed when there's another way."
It was Cas saving him.
“Yeah, well.” Dean passes his hands over his cheek and runs them through his hair. “Call me crazy, Sam, but you don’t seem shocked by this information.”
Cas got up too, stacking the case files, trying to make order out of the chaos of Dean's personal, inscrutable filing system. Dean wasn't even tipsy. The warmth in his stomach wasn't the Jameson. Honestly, the whiskey at this point was just an excuse.
Older Dean's room is pretty much exactly the set up that Dean would want. There's the record player and a stack of albums, most of which Dean recognizes and a few that must be newer music he hasn't heard yet. Dean has a few books on a shelf: Vonnegut, Palahniuk, and Gaiman, of course, but also titles Dean's never read. There's a few fantasy and sci-fi novels, a copy of
Dean had wanted, momentarily, to tear the statue down. He's gotten resigned to it over the years since, and as they pass by on their way home, Dean only spares the shrine the briefest of antagonistic thoughts.
Cas lets him fumble to the words this time.
Dean could barely look at his younger self. Young Dean was so lithe and unbroken, his eyes full of vibrant vitality. Not that he hadn't seen some shit by the time he got to that age, Dean has to remind himself, but he hadn't known anything yet. Dad and Sam were still alive, Dean didn't even believe in God or angels, had never been to hell.
Kissing Cas is like…
Other than maybe a few slaps, John had never hit Sammy. Dean wouldn't let him hit Sammy, was always in the way, always taking the fall. But it wasn't like John had really tried, anyway. He'd clearly loved Sam, clearly felt a need to keep him safe. There was something about Dean, though, that seemed to set him off. Maybe it was just that Dean was older, old enough in John's eyes to become a partner, a confidante, a soldier. Maybe it was that Dean really did look like his mother, that as a child he'd been too pretty, too feminine, for John to bear. Maybe John had somehow guessed that Dean wasn't going to end up straight. Whatever it was, he'd done more than try to toughen Dean up.
Dean looked at him like he was biting back laughter. "Well, Cas, not all of it is."
"Of course," Dean mutters.
“I like it,” Mary said. “It’s happy-sad. I used to play a lot of Johnny Cash around the house.”
Cas nods. "It's worth acquiring. I think I could manage a trip to Turkey."
“Well, it’s kinda like that. Which Charlie does too. But cosplay, it’s usually at conventions and stuff. Like, uh, comic con type stuff? She goes to these things dressed up as fictional characters. Like, I don’t know, female Indiana Jones was a couple years ago, I think.”
It's Sam, shotgun rounds to the chest in that hotel room, moments before Dean's own death, before Heaven.
It would be easier, maybe, if Cas could bring himself to find a vessel that Dean could fall in love with. He thinks there's a chance, maybe, that if they had the relationship they have, if they kept that love and that tension, between Dean and a female vessel…
Dean likes being able to touch Cas in their own home. He likes calling their place home. He likes watching Cas work in his garden, likes how at peace Cas looks with dirt all over his arms and a little trowel with a baby blue handle in his hands instead of an angel blade.
Dean's mouth twitched at the corners. "Okay. Fair. You're hired. What else?"
"You haven't asked
“ I don’t know what love is. All I’ve ever known is
Sam shrugs. “I’d like to know that we can offer them a bigger space. We’ll still have to pass inspection and everything, but yeah. Yeah, we’re serious about it.”
Dean pulled off the narrow road onto an even narrower dirt road that ended in a mostly abandoned parking lot at a trailhead. Cas supposed it was the middle of a workday, but the sky was the kind of cloudless that made the warmth of the sun on the back of his neck feel infinite. He let out a little sigh as he got out of the car, face upturned to the sun with his eyes shut, letting the light burn red through his eyelids.
It's a motley crew, a mixture of races and gender, the youngest in body no more than a teen and the oldest a silver-haired man in a ragged traveling cloak. Sam gets a drop on a Latina woman, taking her head off with one sweep of his blade before anyone has even turned to notice the newcomers.
And then Dean accidentally - he has no idea how he got there - finds himself in the voice-mail storage of the phone. Either older Dean is the only person to ever call this phone in the last two years, or Cas has kept every message he's ever left.
Sammy, but the engrained need to provide for his little brother is strong.
Dean laughs at the same time that Sam, across the table and apparently already halfway through his copy of the play, groans.
“What I said about… if you wanted to, with younger me. It’d be okay. I mean, he’s me, you know. So…”
Dean thinks about the work he wants to do with Charlie, all of the things he’s going to work towards. He thinks about himself, and Sam, and Cas, their little broken, good, family. He thinks about himself and Cas, all the points where they’ve missed each other and now, finally, the way that they’ve come home.
"I'm telling you that you can't ask me not to do this," Sam says. "I'm your son, not your soldier."
“You sure that’s the comparison you want to go with to an alcoholic, doc?”
Dean broke off again with a noise of frustration, dropping his hands to Cas' shoulders and glaring into his stunned expression.
“I don’t mind.”
Older Dean glares at Cas for several solid seconds, and Dean thinks, distractedly, that they might as well just bang each other right there on the table for all the misplaced passion they're giving off.
Cas’ sigh is softer this time. He takes a moment to answer. “I suppose it’s because even then, you try so hard to fix everything too. Humanity can destroy - selfish, unnecessary, and irrevocable destruction. And yet, Dean, they rush into burning buildings to save their pets. They rescue wild animals from floods. People chain themselves to trees in front of bulldozers. You and Sam, you spend your life battling evil so that others can go home to their families at night. Humans were created to believe, you know. And for some of you, that belief manifests in faith to God or gods or some other religious principle. But when it comes down to it, down to the wire in this life, I think perhaps the strongest faith I have ever witnessed is the belief humans can have in each other. It’s…” Cas struggles with the words for a moment. “It’s foolish and beautiful all at once. Love, human love, is… unbearable. It burns too hot for Heaven, too deep for Hell. God bid us to love mankind, but no one ever told the angels what love means to a human soul. I think no one told us because once you know the desperate brightness, the blinding force of love, that is all there is. I love humanity because, destructive or not, it is worth saving.”
Dean can’t help huffing out a laugh and grinning to himself. He thought he’d lost this old thing forever, somewhere between crawling out of his grave and the first apocalypse. He runs his fingers over all the old nicks, the familiar groove in the middle. He could use any old thing to open a beer - the butt of a lighter, the rim of a table, the cap of another beer bottle, a knife. All anyone needs is the right angle and pressure, but this ring had been his go-to for a long time. He’d kind of had a thing for jewelry for a while. It was like keeping pieces of home strapped to him - this idea of home that didn’t really exist outside the Impala.
Cas is quiet for a moment before he speaks softly into Dean's hair. "Have I ever told you what I saw when I arrived in Hell at the head of my garrison? We fought our way to you, you know, down in the very pits of that place. When we came bursting into the darkness where Alistair held sway, we were in a wedge formation, pushing our way through the hoards of Hell with brute force. Our mission was not to defeat their armies. Our only mission was to reach you. To save you."
No one has told him there's anywhere in the bunker he has to stay out of, but he hasn't had much inclination to go looking outside of Sam's initial tour before. He starts with Sam's room now, since it's obvious his brother has become the one in charge of research - not that it's a surprise. Sam was always so goddamn smart. Even when they were kids, it had been obvious to Dean that Sammy was going to be a genius one day. Dean just couldn't keep up, but he was always secretly so proud of his little brother.
Cas sighs again. He turns to look at Dean and those eyes of his catch the light of the morning sun behind Dean's head. They seem to pull light in, getting deeper the longer Dean looks into them, blue like the sky, like the platonic ideal of blue, like light pulled into being. Dean wonders if it's an angel thing, or if it's just Cas.
Cas sighs. He shoves his hands into his pocket and gets that distinctly shifty look on his face. Cas is a terrible liar.
Slowly, a smile starts to spread over Dean’s face, until it’s a grin, until it’s a laugh coming out of his mouth. Bobby smiles along with him, clearly understanding.
Dean mock-scowled at him, raising a finger warningly. “Not the point.”
“Sam, we can’t just… I mean, yeah, that sounds great, but we can’t just leave.”
"Say it again. Slowly."
Dean makes a scoffing noise. "Ah, c'mon, Sammy," he says. But then he doesn't have anything to add. Sam turns to him, pulling his gaze away from the far-off view, eyes snapping onto Dean's before he can look away. There is something in his brother's gaze that makes Dean kinda want to crawl under the Impala and hide. Sam always knows how to look right through him.
reads the first question, followed by a set of lines that Dean doesn't think could possibly be long enough to even begin describing his situation.
"Angel, like,
"Sam, don't." Dean knows it's begging this time, and he doesn't care.
"I know. I know. But what was I supposed to say? He's going to figure it out if he's around those two for more than five minutes and I didn't want him freaking out and making Dean, our Dean, panic again."
Cas and Jack look miserable. Young Dean just looks pissed.
poetry, you know? But I figured, it's the Beat Generation, maybe it wouldn't be so bad."
Dean averts his eyes, looking at the grove instead. It's pretty, beautiful, full of quiet, ancient memorial.
John bangs into the motel room from outside and fourteen-year-old Dean sits up straighter automatically. Sam looks up from his book, his face wary.
Cas’ eyes are still closed and he looks a little miserable. He nods. Dean wants to kiss the sadness out of him.
Cas leveled him with his most deadpan stare. "I can do our taxes in my head," he pointed out.
“Look, you’re not dying for me. I’m the one who got cursed, I’m the one who’ll take the consequences. Besides, I’m older. I’ve already lived longer than I had any right to, so…”
Seeing Dean from 2005, Sam wishes he could reach back further, to Dean at sixteen maybe, Dean at thirteen, somewhere in their past when Sam could have grabbed Dean by the shoulders and told him that none of this was his fault, it wasn't his responsibility. Tell him that life isn't supposed to be like this, that he doesn't deserve this. Probably throw in that it was okay if he was into dudes, just for good measure.
"I'm sorry, Dean. I know these are your secrets, but you aren't…" Cas stops.
Dean hadn't planned on letting Cas stay. He'd figured they'd fuck and then after an acceptable minimum, he'd kick Cas out so he could sleep. But he hadn't planned on Cas' face when Dean finished and crawled back up to lay next to him.
Dean’s not fucking stupid. He gets why this one is different. He gets that having no one to protect him since the age of four, growing up too fast, being put into this position to be both a father and a mother to Sammy, a soldier and a replacement partner to John, he gets that this has fucked him up. This was just life, crummy, dirty, exhausting life.
"But it's also, if you want to take the broader view," Cas goes on, rifling through the hangers himself. "That you didn't always have this dichotomy of gender. I mean, how do certain pants make you one gender or another? What if you went nude, would that be neutral?"
"No," Dean says without a beat. "You may be as old as dirt, Cas, but you've only been making choices for ten years. That one's not gonna fly."
Dean shakes his head. He's sweating. He needs… God, he needs something, anything. He needs pain, maybe. Sometimes that grounds him. He digs his fingernails into his palms.
Sam's face is that deep, complicated kind of sad again, but he meets Dean's eyes at least. "Hey," he says. "I'm… I'm sorry about him. Let's…" he glances at Cas, with this look on his face that tells Dean he doesn't quite know what to say to the angel either. "Let's, uh, go back downstairs, get you some pain meds now that you're up."
And then - no space to breathe, no time to come down from the fear and adrenaline leftover from what, after everything, was still one of the worst nights of his life - Dean sees her.
“Is this a pattern?” Cas asks before Sam and Dean can even say hello.
Sam finally arrives two days later. He'd been calling Dean twice a week in the meantime, but Dean told him not to bother coming up until he had a place for him and Eileen to crash. Dean set up a guest room in the downstairs bedroom farthest from his, because the floors in the farmhouse are magnificent old hardwood and they creak like Dean's joints. He does not need to hear his little brother banging it out with his girlfriend.
Dean smiles and gets out of the car, stretching. He doesn't really need to, his body never seems to ache or cramp here, but it's habit. It's human.
“It’s good news. I think.” Sam turns the laptop toward the three hovering men. “Charlie found some sort of forum for cursed art and relics. It looks like there was more history about this vase than we could originally find online, probably because the dealers would have wanted to expunge a record of past owners dying. So look at this, there’s a retired art dealer who specialized in supposedly cursed objects for awhile, thought it was a good market to get into before he got too deep and realized some of his stuff was legit. Anyway, he had the vase twice in five years and both times he acquired it, it came with the same story.”
Dean can feel it happening now, as the memory of his mother's death plays out before him and Cas. Four-year-old Dean is there again, standing outside their burning house, clutching Sammy in his own small arms while his brother cries and twists. He tries his best to rock him, but he's heavy and Dean's arms are weak.
Dean turns away from that thought and the mirror. He doesn't shave or get out the clippers for his hair. Just the shower was exhausting. Mostly sober, he goes back to his room and dresses on autopilot. He's deeply hollow.
What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Dean wondered if this was how Cas felt all the time - like he was so full of light that he was sure to burst with it, chest so warm and glowing that it seemed to come right out of his fingertips.
still light and color - he is electromagnetic radiation that has been encased in muddled flesh. He is pinned to the earth by this human body, but he is that same formation of energy and entropy that watched millenia go by, waiting, just waiting mostly, for his part to come.
He thinks Cas might be there, because there's a glow through his eyelids, a glow that is soft and warm and he wants to curl towards it like a plant unfolding towards the sun, but his eyes won't open.
Young Dean scowls at them, but he shrugs. “Whatever. So future me has got a stick up his ass about Jack using his power, right? Is putting the vase back together going to kill him or something?”
remembers what fourteen-year-old Dean is thinking: He's already done this once for free. He might as well do it by choice, for money.
Cas is glaring - just sort of generally - and when he looks at Sam, he glowers straight through him.
Cas smiles and pushes Dean off him gently, taking his hand. "Yes. Can we look at the view now?"
Dean nods again. His throat feels tight and the embarrassment of having said too much overwhelms him.
They're standing in an open space that isn't large enough to be called a meadow, but the grass underfoot is lush and green. The crowns of many of the trees weave together, but they don't grow crowded against one another. There are little saplings here and there, other trees around Dean's height, still others that wave in the breeze above his head. There are no statues, no plaques, no litter. It's like this place has been forgotten.
"He's not coming back."
“Of course you were,” Sam says gently. “You do know that, don’t you?”
Dean shrugs. “Sure, doc. I promised Sammy three months anyway, so you got a little time to convince me.”
expanding. When humans say "the observable universe", they mean it, they mean what can be seen from their orbit. So no, it's not strictly the other universes. But also yes. Each of those multiverse worlds has their own observable universe that exists very far away from our own. Sometimes it's called the "meta-universe," and we're all a part of it. Those other worlds are a part of us. The rifts that can exist between systems of life in the totality of the universe, it's… it goes beyond space-time. I don't know how to explain it. As Death, it's easier to see how
a liability tonight, the only one of them to get really banged up, and these men don't need him, he's worse than useless here, and how he should have known, what's wrong with him that he didn't think about his orders, he's supposed to follow orders, it's the first lesson he ever had beaten into him, and…
They're back in the dark bedroom. Dean knows now that he's eight years old, a shadowy shape on top of the covers, listening to his four-year-old brother breathe deeply in his sleep.
In their third therapy session, Dean finally brings up the nightmares. He’s embarrassed by how rough his voice gets when he explains waking up to find that he was strangling Cas.
"Aw, I can read you like an open book, sunshine," Dean said, grinning now, close to teasing. "What is it? C'mon, spit it out."
“For us.” Dean can’t quite believe they’re just having this conversation, like any of it makes sense.
“I think so. She needed closure.”
John looks away first. "Fine, well done," he says gruffly. "You've proven yourself smart enough for college, great. What now?"
“Thanks,” Cas says dryly, but Dean knows he’s pleased beneath their doubled sarcasm.
Dean had discovered this newest, if temporary, addition to the household the evening after Christmas. He’d woken up in the middle of the night with the feeling that something was watching him, sitting up groggily in a bed that contained Cas, one of the cats sleeping between them, Captain draped over Dean’s feet, and Earp curled up at his back. Yarrow was in his usual spot in a ball on the floor next to Cas’ side of the bed. Yarrow never forgot that it was Cas who saved him from the side of the road, and it’s not like Dean can blame him for that.
"Exactly, he's
Cas frowns as they slide into the backseat of the Impala. "
Dean isn't even gay. He definitely likes girls, no question there, no sir. He could be bi, maybe, but he's never even slept with a guy.
Dean doesn't quite stifle his laugh. "Okay okay, Mr. Cosmos, you don't have to eat if you don't want to. You've got some molecules on your face."
"Okay, so according to the play, Xerodicus was this guy who was born to a very poor woman who traded him to a hermit in the woods for a season's worth of grain when he was three years old. The hermit dude, name of Odinian, taught Xero how to hunt from the moment he got him, and Xero grew up a woodsman who never missed his mark, etc. When he was ten or twelve, the twin gods Artemis and Apollo were hunting some impossible to catch golden bird, only to arrive in a clearing and find this random boy collecting his arrow from its corpse.
"This is exactly how it changes things, Dean. You lose hope. When we lose someone, when we lose Cas, you spiral. I mean, look, I do too. It feels like there's this colossal weight on my chest all the time. But at least I know why I wake up feeling like I can't breathe. I can't bottle that up or pretend like it doesn't exist, or it would kill me. The way it's killing you."
"So… if we can see all the stars and planets in Heaven, does that mean one of these guys could be another world out there?" Dean points at a bright, steady point of light in the cosmos.
It reminds Sam of Osiris, of Dean being judged and found wanting. At least with Sam there, maybe he'd had a fighting chance of seeing himself as worthy of something. If Cas is right and each of the seven doors is a test, a level of personal hell, of confronting one's worst memories and darkest secrets, then Sam is not sure Dean will make it. He should have woken up on his own by now.
“We’ve had too many years of secrets. They always end up coming out somehow.”
But Sam doesn't know about that. Surely he doesn't know. He can't know. Dean would never tell him, no matter how much has changed in their lives, he'd never burden Sam with
Dean shuts his eyes. There is a feeling racking his body - he doesn’t know what it is, it doesn’t seem like there is a word for this. This is like every dissociative episode he’s ever had - like he’s totally outside his own body, watching his life from the outside, unable to connect to what he’s actually experiencing. Except the body he’s kneeling next to isn’t really his own, and he’s still safe in his head, and his brother’s grief, Cas’ grief, is too much for him to understand.
There's this thing that happens to Dean sometimes, something that for a long time he didn't have the words for. He just assumed it was something wrong with him, just another crack in his skull somewhere.
"Hello, other Dean. It's good to meet you," Eileen says, her distinctive, careful way of talking full of a hidden amusement.
Dean touches Cas' face, the way he has a hundred times, the way he has always done to comfort himself that Cas is still alive and real and himself.
Cas glowers more darkly at the countertop, but young Dean just grunts, so Sam heads downstairs to their rooms. He knocks three times, and when he gets no answer he pushes the door open.
"I think…" Once again Cas' eyes drag over to meet Dean's, like he can't help it, before he turns back to the younger version dying in front of them. "I think maybe you
The creaking from the hall gets closer.
"Women of Letters, maybe," Charlie says. She has a point. Dean noticed that most of the new recruits who have been filing into the bunker are women, including Claire and Kaia.
It wasn't who Dean was. Things just happened, sometimes. It hadn't happened again.
It was after they'd killed the rougarou, Dean having wrestled with it and refusing to let Cas heal his bruises, icing his arm back in the hotel room. Dean flipped through the TV channels, but the only thing on besides infomercials and static was a children's cartoon.
Dean digs his fingernails into the wood of the back porch steps, feeling it give way easily enough. He'd balked when it seemed like Sam wanted them both to go to a professional for real. But then Sam had announced he was abandoning law school to become a social worker, of all things. And Dean wasn't above poking fun at his brother, but, really, it made sense for him. Sam was good with people. He was sensitive and open, he got people to talk, and he wanted to help. Sam wasn't a quack, and unfortunately, Dean was pretty sure this meant he was going to have to accept that not everyone in the therapy business was either.
Sam makes a choked little noise. Dean opens his eyes and watches Sam sink lower to the ground, pulling younger Dean’s head into his lap, stroking his hair.
"In many parts of Europe, right now, yes, but I fail to see how that's relevant." Cas turns to younger Dean. "I should be able to heal you now."
“Well, it’s your decision of course.” Hank’s expression is still neutral. Dean can’t seem to crack him. “But I think medication might help you.”
One night together turned into a second, a third, until Cas lost track of the number, until sleeping together was just something they did. Sometimes Dean kicked Cas out afterwards, but more often he let him stay, let Cas hold him and caress his skin and sometimes even let him murmur that he was beautiful, so beautiful.
“No. I don’t.”
Sam sort of smiles at the floor, ridiculous hair flopping in his face. "I like her too," he admits. "Although given my track record, I don't know if I'm good for her."
"This is my room, by the way, if you need to find me later. Dean's room is that one, Cas is down the hall." Sam jerks his thumb at the three doors in turn.
Dean tries to reconcile himself to that, because, well, it would be okay. If he can still keep his best friend, it'll be better than anyone could reasonably ask for after… that. It's not like he expects anything from Cas, not like he'd ever ask anything from him. Dean doesn't even know how to feel about this spell thinking that
It’s true. It’s different outside, looking in.
“I always look at you like this.”
Dean rolls his eyes. "You keep saying that."
But staring at the baby giggling and grabbing on to this other Dean's fingers, all now-Dean can feel is a ramping anxiety. If this spell is trying to show Dean what it thinks he wants to see, it's wrong. Dean
Dean didn't really blush, but Cas could sense the heat coming off him, the blood in his face, that human thing that was so endearing in him.
"Are you… okay?" Cas winces as the words leave his mouth. It's the human thing to say, but he knows the answer.
Dean tries to tell himself he's crying because half of everyone he knows is dead and long gone. Because he's stuck here and might die in a few weeks. Because everything is confusing and his head still hurts and apparently this Sam just knows one of his darkest secrets and doesn't care.
"Don't," he says again. "Don't talk about yourself like that."
"No," Dean says again sharply, cutting him off. "Shut up. I'm the one who got cursed. The marksman is coming for me. If we can't figure this out another way, you're not taking that arrow for me. No discussion."
His body is a resource. His body isn't his, but at the same time, no one can exactly take it from him, no matter how much it may have felt like it. They can't, but they can.
Dean opens the second beer and slings it back. The shifting sunlight on the lake is a blinding silver in the rippling gray water.
Dean lets go of his wrist and leans his forehead against Cas' shoulder instead. Dean shudders, a whole body movement that shakes the bed. Cas hesitantly touches Dean's hair, and when he doesn't stop him, Cas runs his fingers through it. He's always wanted to do that.
Dean had a pack of Camel's that he'd bogarted off a drunk a few months back. He didn't smoke all the time, but nights like tonight…
Dean flashed him one of his grins so full of easy charm - bravado veiling whatever nerves he might be feeling. "Sure I'm sure. Not like you're asking for much work from me here."
Content warnings in end notes.
body and he hates remembering what he did with it, what was done to it when he, human-Dean, now-Dean, wasn't in charge.
"I need you to hold on to something for me." Cas speaks over him, reaching beneath his own shirt and pulling a black cord over his head. He holds it out to Dean.
That anxiety doesn't exactly wane. Dean still wakes up with his throat full of it. Still reaches out to touch Cas and make sure he's real: asleep but alive, his human heartbeat steady under Dean's palm.
The entire room shakes. Dean jumps and Cas jerks his head up to look towards the ceiling. The walls are rumbling.
Cas closes his eyes and Dean jolts at the thrum of electricity that seems to come from him. "A dozen," he says after a moment. "Eight downstairs, four upstairs."
Dean had let the laugh huff out of his chest and patted Cas' arm. "Yeah, Cas, that was okay. I'm good." He'd turned his face half an inch, blue eyes too close to his own. "You good?"
Dean didn't get back to sleep that morning after his own voice had woken him up screaming - which, Jesus - so he's tired and groggy when he stumbles back into the kitchen around 8:00.
Twenty-six year-old Dean isn’t good at waiting around to die. He’s also not
Sam is the one who lets out a careful, slow breath this time. He spreads his hands out in front of him in subconscious supplication. "If it's a life worth saving, then isn't it a life worth living?" he asks, his voice so earnest.
Sam wakes up with a jolt, his body already twisting, half-rising, adrenaline spiking in whatever part of his subconscious pulls the alarm bells. It takes him a moment in the dark of his room, this little piece of quiet efficiency that isn't quite home but close,
Dean is a fuck-up with a pretty face and some outsized bravado. His only plans in life are hunting, and dying young. He doesn't even have a high school diploma, let alone ambitions or anything to offer except a life on the road. He's not tough like John or smart like Sam. He's just a soldier, there to do what he's told.
And that, Dean thinks, is good enough. He starts to step away, intending to leave his past self alone with his broken arm and hurt feelings, but younger Dean stops him.
"It's one of Dean's. He and Sam insist I carry one ever since I had to call them to wire funds to an alpaca sanctuary, but that's a long story."
“Mm,” Dean says.
"Hey, tell me something, did Blink-182 ever get back together?" Dean asks. He wants to establish the conversation far away from where they left it in the library, and Sam seems perfectly willing to oblige.
Cas can't fully understand Dean's hang up around his sexuality, because Cas himself is so utterly indifferent to this aspect of the physical body, but he accepts that it matters to Dean. He knows there are years of ingrained self-hatred there, and Cas just does what he can to let Dean work it out.
“Ah, hey, you can’t think like that, man.” Sam puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. He really has gotten touchier in the last two years. “You’ll just get stuck in that loop. I know it’s hard, to think about the ones we couldn’t save, but… Look, I’m proud of us. All in all, Dean, I think we did good.”
“You must have been sixteen, seventeen. You were in a deserted parking lot in Nebraska, teaching Sam how to drive. I remember looking at you through the Impala window, thinking you were so young. The both of you. You were so… human. Sam kept pulling into the parking spaces outside the lines, but you were being patient, talking him through driving in reverse, how to account for the car’s engine. You were teasing each other, laughing so easily together. I didn’t stay long, but I remember thinking that the way you loved each other was so apparent. It was something I didn’t really understand then. Even so, I wanted to protect it, protect you. That was when I began praying for you.”
Dean sniffles, alone in his dark and grungy room, and looks around again. His eye catches on the jacket hanging on his closet door. His body stiffens in anticipation of the rush of guilt and self-hatred and keening bereavement that he's been drowning for six months with work and booze. Something softer comes in its place, a bittersweet understanding of what comes next. The blood on the shoulder of Dean's jacket is all that's left of Cas. It's all Dean has left of him.
"Thanks," younger Dean says. He seems awkward this morning, his initial shock wearing off.
Sam doesn’t say anything for a second. “Oh,” he murmurs finally. Then, louder, “Oh. That’s great, Dean. No, that makes total sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”
Cas shrugs. He doesn't look upset by the question, just contemplative. "I was never looking for niceness," he says. "You are kind, mostly. Capable of cruelty, I suppose, but we all are. Even when you struggle to show your kindness, your caring, you are an inherently loving person."
Of course, a lot of the time Dean had just slept in the Impala. It was cheaper, and less lonely somehow. He'd curl up in the back under dad's old leather jacket that still smelled like the old man no matter how many years Dean wore it, with a flashlight and a paperback book he'd found at a thrift store or stolen off a tourist's table or something, and read until he fell asleep.
This older Dean is reading a well-worn copy of Vonnegut's
Chuck told them once, and Dean believes that was real surprise in his voice. Castiel was never supposed to rebel, just happened to come off the line with a "crack in his chassis," a split in the seams of his faith and obedience that Dean managed to worm through with his own persistence and blind obstinacy. Cas falling, always so literally falling, for Dean wasn't destiny. It wasn't pre-determined, wasn't something Heaven had planned. They weren't soulmates, weren't
Cas' expression is understanding. Kind. He looks about two seconds away from asking "And how did that make you feel?"
There's an old Jukebox behind the pool tables, and older Dean puts a handful of quarters in, smiling to himself as he puts on back to back classic rock. Then he rolls up the sleeves of his flannel and goes behind the bar. He pours himself a half-glass of whiskey and sips it while he does inventory. The blackboard above his head already has weekday specials listed on it. Monday's special is the "Misty Mountain Hops" IPA, Tuesday's is a cocktail called "Sammy's Bad Day" which seems to be a vodka tonic with too many olives, Wednesday features a nightmarish mix of Jaeger and Coca-a-Cola which Dean has apparently chosen to call "Coda," Thursday is half off pints from the local brewery, and Friday's is "Hunter's Helper" which is just a full glass of bottom shelf whiskey.
Sam snorts when Dean pauses. "Have been desperately in love with each other for years? Yeah, also got that memo."
Dean puts in a R.E.M tape, although he will deny it if anyone asks. His dad always hated the band, thought it was too soft and crooning, just the wrong side of pop-rock.
Dean thinks he's entitled to this one thing, to this validation of what was always between him and Cas.
“Sam?” Jack says as Charlie hangs up.
And Sam, looking at his brother while the engine purrs a different kind of lullaby, Sam feels safe.
"Come out as what, though? What did you think I was trying to say?"
“That wasn’t the point of my story…”
Dean wasn't planning on dying. But he's sure not going to let some kid die for him either, even if he hates who he was at that age. And maybe, if Dean takes an arrow to the chest in three weeks and young Dean doesn't go up in smoke or something, maybe he and Sam can have a healthier run at things. Maybe Sam can figure out who he is without Dean, without entirely losing his brother.
Cas had followed him willingly down the hall and into Dean's bedroom, willingly let himself be pushed back against the door and manhandled out of that stupid coat. He'd brought one hand up to cup Dean's cheek, kissing back with his own ferocity now, and Dean let himself get swept along with it, let his brain turn off and his body pursue the thing it wanted.
“Hey Cas,” Dean says quietly when he can’t stand the feeling any longer. He swallows, shuts his eyes for a moment, and looks back at the old water stain. “Dunno if you can hear me. Probably not. But. In case you can, I miss you, man. I… I might be going a little crazy. I think about you all the time. Think about you being here with me. I think you’d like it here. Not like you ever complained about the bunker, but… Well. Maybe you just didn’t know any better. Guess you never really had better, unless you want to count that time you spent as Emmanuel. But anyway. I think… I really blew it with you, huh? You were the goddamn love of my life, and I just… Ah, it doesn’t matter. Not now.
Sam can still hear the whistle of the bullet passing next to his ear as he'd ducked to the side and Dean's waking voice saying "Shit. Sam? Sammy? Are you okay? Are you okay?"
or even
Hank nods some more. "I'd like to come back to that if you don't mind. For the moment, who else would you say is in your social support network?"
Now-Dean doesn't have to look at his own face to know that that one bites deep. It's a confused flush in his chest because he loves mom, knows that dad still loves mom, but it's just another way John has pointed out how
It had been almost a month since they'd slept together and things were still a little strained, so Cas hadn't made any retorts back about his heavenly powers being reduced to electrician tricks, just gave Dean a little tired smile and nodded.
"Yeah, he knows."
Sam looks confused for a moment before he realizes Dean is gesturing at the rectangle in his hand. "Oh. It's my phone. Right, you're still probably using a flip phone, huh?"
And it doesn’t make a goddamn difference.
Dean’s always really liked kids. There’s just something sweet and earnest about them before a certain age, but Dean knows that they are also people with their own big thoughts and feelings and fears. A lot of adults forget that, which Dean thinks is probably why kids generally seem to like him too.
Dean looked down at the dust beneath their feet, and Cas could see how hard he was struggling with words. "Always thought I did. That I wanted all that. Or, I wanted to be able to give somebody that. Marriage and kids and a mortgage or whatever."
Younger Dean looks a little startled that Dean is asking, but he nods. "Yeah. That's, uh… that's plenty to be going off of." He looks back at Cas, his smile a little less tentative. "And thanks."
Cas lets him change the subject. “It’s a tree like that one.” Cas points to a surprisingly small tree with rounded yellow and red leaves, and here and there a few green survivors holding on into the fall. “But that’s not the one. I’ll know it when I see it.”
Cas pulls Dean back into his chest now and Dean wraps one of his arms up around Cas’ back this time. This is how he usually falls asleep with Cas, as close as they can possibly wrap themselves up in each other. If Dean Winchester is going to snuggle anyone, he’s going to do it right.
Which is fine. It's fine that his brother is, nominally at least, keeping the longest and most important relationship he's ever had from Sam. It's fine. They're all fine.
Then half the vampires are turning away from Cas, older Dean, and the two headless bodies they've already dropped.
about it if that's too much for you, but man, you gotta tell someone."
"C'mon, I'll bet there's something kinky in that freaky little head of yours. I'm trying to be nice here, Cas." Dean couldn't keep the scowl up, his lips quirking in spite of himself. "I know you ain't had a lot of occasion to actually
“Is this legit?” Sam asks, something like hope caught in his throat for the first time in awhile. Although it would be just like Dean to go for a suicide run right as they find a solution.
I'm sorry about younger Dean (see: Crossing Lines), but I wanted to give Dean both the death he deserved and the life he deserved. We should have gotten at least one.
“Cas?”
So. I wasn't going to name who the other two faces on Jack's level were, just sort of let them be implied by appearance. But then I read the superwiki on nephilim, and apparently it's canon that Queen Sheba was one??? I did not know this beforehand and I'm unreasonably proud of myself.
Cas asks Eileen something about agriculture, and Eileen starts excitedly explaining about whatever is going on in environmental law at the moment, her hands rapidly moving as she signs half the conversation. Jude waves his hands around in ASL babble, and Dean extracts him from Cas to go look for Sam.
Dean nods. He clears his throat. He's just not good at this.
Sam sighs a little louder this time, but he exchanges the tapes.
“There’s never time.” Dean sighs and rolls onto his knees, pushing himself up. His very bones ache and he mourns the lost cinnamon roll briefly. “C’mon, kid. We got our sob stories out.” He reaches down a hand and Sam lets him pull him up. Dean gives his brother another brief hug, thinking to himself that he’s going to need to drink a half bottle of whiskey the second they get back to the bunker to forget all of this.
I've added this fic to a series, the title of which is taken from Leonard Cohen's
It's Sammy - safe and happy, out of the life. With a wife and a son that he's named after his brother, a baby that Dean gets to dote on without being fully responsible for. It's having Sam near enough to see, to check up on, but somehow being able to let him go, just a little. Just enough for them to find out who they are without each other.
When Cas turned to Dean, Dean looked away from the view and met his eyes. There was something deconstructed in Dean's face as he stared back into Cas' eyes, something warring with itself and losing.
"Seriously, Sam, what's an angel doing slumming it in a hunter's bunker in Kansas? Shouldn't he be, I don't know, out dispensing the wrath of God or making miracles?"
“Ah Jesus, Sammy. Not this again.” Dean scrubs a hand over his face. His palm smells like lemon and verbena from the car wash Cas bought for him.
"All those people, Dean, those regular people, their lives are worth saving, aren't they?"
Jude adores Cas in the same way that some cats latch on to the one non-cat-person in the room, just out of obstinacy. Not that Cas doesn’t love Jude, and he’s better with him than he ever lets himself believe, but of them all, Cas was probably the most nervous to hold or be left alone with the baby. He holds Jude more easily now, but there is such a loveable awkwardness to him even after a year.
really is excellent. Twenty-six year-old Dean flops down next to older Dean on his bed and they binge straight through the first three episodes with the laptop balanced over both their legs.

“Okay,” Cas says. He doesn’t get it, isn’t quite human enough yet to know what that means on its own, but he sounds wary. His hand still cradles Dean’s face.
Dean bends down and starts gathering the bags back up. "Okay," he says. "We've got canned goods, dry goods, perishables." He passes the bulk of the bags over to Annie. "Snacks." He tosses two bags at the ten-year-old who peers into them and grins wider. Dean rummages in the remaining bags and pulls out a bottle, tossing it to the teenage boy in the hallway. "Those are for Lucy. Prenatal vitamins. Make sure she takes them, and for God's sake, Sean, let one of us know the next time the two of you need a ride to her appointments."
bonding with Sam, but fuck it, that's what's happening. He can't sit there and watch his brother get attached to this copy of something he once was.
"No," older Dean snaps from his seat across from Cas. "You're not burning yourself out like that again. We'll just have someone ship it to us like normal fucking people."
“Dean,” Cas’ voice softens. He reaches for older Dean. “You’re not -”
"I - dad, it can wait 'til morning. Get some sleep here at least, you drove all the way out."
And isn't that what he's been doing his whole life? Creating meaning out of what he'd been given? Dean learned young how to create a home out of a car, a necklace, a ring, a leather jacket. He learned how to find love in the spaces between John's words - and sometimes his fists - in dad teaching him how to shoot, to drive, to survive. Dean taught himself how to stay alive for Sammy, to find happiness in making his brother laugh, to carry on for him.
"That's not…" Sam sighs. It is too early for this kind of earnest ethics inquiry from Jack. "It's not gonna happen, Jack. Okay? We're not picking between them."
Chapter Content Warnings: suicidal ideation, self-esteem issues, reference to past childhood emotional abuse, use of alcohol/lapse of sobriety
Dean stands there frozen in a hardware store and thinks about ending the fight by - what? Grabbing Cas' hand? Kissing him on the cheek? Full-on kissing him there in the paint aisle in front of the construction workers and old ladies who patron the store in the middle of a work week?
"Because he loved you," Sam says firmly - Sam, who had run away from dad more than once, who had yelled at Dean that he was a coward to stay, who'd accused him of being nothing more than a whipping boy and their father of being a shell of obsessed grief, who'd almost seemed to hate John from the moment he'd hit puberty. "He loved both of us. I know he was crap at showing it, and it took me a long time to understand, but he did. I'm sorry. You deserve his apology from him, not me, but just know… just know that dad wished he could fix things, Dean. He never did, and I don't think he could have, even if he'd lived, but for what it's worth, he wanted to."
Dean can hustle up enough money to make sure Sammy eats, and when he can't, he can always steal or grift their way to a meal. It's not always easy, but he always gets it done one way or another. When it comes down to it, thrift stores are cheap, or he can steal things like shoes and clothes. But there are some things, like dental cleanings or keeping up with vaccines, that Dean can't really lie and cheat his way through, that pool and card money doesn't usually cover. When they stay with Bobby he usually pays Dean for his help on cars, but they're only in South Dakota sporadically and Dean's too young to get apprenticed at any other mechanics.
“What are we making, anyway?” Dean cuts a generous amount of butter into a pan and dumps in the onions he chopped.
“Okay,” Sam says softly. “I’m back. How the hell do you do that?”
Dean waves a hand abstractly in the air. "Whatever."  He rubs his face. "You ever tell anyone about any of this, I will Nair your head. I mean it, picture yourself smooth as a baby's bottom."
Sam rolls his eyes, as if to say
Older Dean snorts. “Had to rebuild her a couple of times, but don’t worry, she’s the same tough broad.”
Cas had frowned at him in confusion, and Sam had only seemed marginally more in the loop, but Mary, bless her, had looked up from her coffee and eyed Dean.
Cas' flash of grief doesn't make sense to Dean, but he only says "I do not have a harp."
Sam Winchester lives forty years without his brother. He marries, raises a child, and dies a peaceful death at home in his late seventies. When the time comes, he finds himself rising from his bed and realizing with a pang that his spectral form is exactly the age he was when he last saw Dean. He can’t help the swell of hope in his chest as he looks around the room, waiting.
"They do give off some pretty clear pining vibes," Charlie admits with a sigh.
"Dean -" Cas starts, looking wary, but Dean just leans his forehead into Cas' shoulder, slumping into him, and Cas goes silent.
Cas sighs. His fingers rub the small of Dean’s back too. “He treats me better than I deserve,” he says quietly. “You don’t know the things I’ve done, Dean. The ways I’ve hurt you and Sam. If you did…”
“Sorry,” Sam says over Dean’s shoulder. “It’s… I’m on edge too. It’s weird, I know.”
Hi folks, thanks for reading and to everyone who has commented. One comment equals one drop of serotonin, which, y'know, in this economy...
It's useless to ask why.
Cas' thumbs rub into his shoulders, pressure bearing down on him, circles of motion he feels through his jacket and two shirts. He's always wearing so many protective layers. It's a metaphor, like everything else.
“Well, when you leave today, I’d like you to think about what would defy this narrative - even a narrative in which Chuck returns. You say that he treated your lives like a show, correct? Then I’d like you to consider what would be impossible to the narrative structure of the show. What would go against production? Against character and theme? I want you to think about that before our next session and see if we can’t find a few ways to poke at this idea of a narrative, if there are things you can do in your life now that can help you to feel like your own person and like you are moving away from the ending that was written for you. How does that sound?”
"I… I don't know, Sammy. I'm glad it's helping you, okay? But I don't get how talking about my feelings or whatever to a stranger is supposed to fix me."
There's an awkward pause. Dean realizes dully that he's breathing again. His heart is still going too fast, but he doesn't feel like it's about to explode.
“We could call Rowena first…”
"Christ. Fine. You're the worst. Thank you, doctor," Dean mutters, tipping his daily dose into his palm and swallowing it down with a mouthful of water.
Cas finally unglues his hands from Dean's shoulder. He pushes Dean's face back up to look at him, and Dean can't help flinching.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Sam steps back out of the Impala's way and Dean nods at him, slamming the car door. As he leaves the garage, he thinks about how he could have invited Sam to come along, how Cas was his friend too and he deserves to mourn, how Cas deserved more than one broken little human at his last memorial.
But Dean doesn't know what he'd be feeling, what he'd be expecting. He was so full of bluster and bravado at that age.
to get the little guy to clonk out, and Dean leans over his bed rail for a few minutes, watching Jude sleep.
"Okay, don't call me that," Dean says.
Dean has no attachment to Belleville, Wisconsin, but he also doesn't have any ghosts there waiting for him. Or, if he does, they're literal, and he can deal with that.
Even with his stomach empty, Dean stayed down, half-retching, half-sobbing on his knees. It was the violation almost as much as the pain sometimes.
Dean would have argued that Doctor Sexy could never get old, not with its perfectly constructed format of hot doctor drama and sex, but Cas chooses that moment to walk into the kitchen and Dean finds himself entirely unwilling to talk about hot doctor sex in front of the guy.
It was cold in the old house, but by the time they were both naked the heat between their grinding bodies was already beading sweat on Dean's chest. Dean got an arm under Cas' back and flipped them, a reverse of his fighting moves, so that he was pulling Cas on top of him. Cas' eyes got wide as Dean awkwardly wriggled one leg free so that Cas fell into place between his thighs.
while they eat. He's careful to keep his face turned towards Eileen, and only speaks when his mouth isn't full - which certainly are not the table manners Dean raised him with.
"Cas, he made a deal. For me. When I was dying. The Empty would take him instead. But… it would only come for him later, when he experienced a moment of true happiness. So that he would experience true loss in the moment he had the most to lose. But…" Jack looks from Dean to Sam and back.
Sam snorts, not budging. "Shut up and hug me, you idiot."
He's running out of backroads to drive on. If he keeps it up at this rate he'll be back on a highway soon, and as much as he wants to run, that's not why he's out here.
“What?”
Charlie pats him on the knee again, a little soft this time, and leaves her hand there. “Thanks for telling me, Dean.”
"Interesting. I'll ask." Sam takes his baby back and tucks him into the stroller, securing the straps around him while his son waves to Dean only two feet away on the bench. Dean waves back and makes ridiculous faces until the baby laughs again.
“What’s going on?” Jack asks, sounding like the kid he is.
“A collection of letters from the french revolution. They’re quite sad.”
It's Cas, blown up again by Lucifer.
Dean manages to stay on his feet this time, although it's a near thing.
It had taken such a long time to glue himself back into something that resembled the Dean of before. He's pretty sure that he hasn't really settled into that shape since. What he does, the ways that he copes, it doesn't work. Not really. It gets him by, and if all Dean is ever looking for is survival, then yeah, he's somewhere in the neighborhood of managing.
Dean can't look at Sam's unflinching expression anymore. He can't seem to raise his eyes at all. He just stares down between his boots at the kicked up dirt, trying to let himself fall into it, fall into anything outside of himself.
can. He could. I could have, I think, back then. And it would have…” Dean meant to tell Cas about how he thinks this would have saved him, how he’s maybe starting to believe that he deserved to be saved by Cas back then, that he deserved a fucking chance at life. Dean isn’t sure what the word is for coming to realize this just when he realizes the only way to have it is to give it up. Irony, maybe, or paradoxical.
It starts with Dean imagining dragging Cas along to Ace Hardware, getting into a fight in the middle of the paint aisle, bickering over color swatches until one of them gives in and then -
It’s so dorky and loveable. It aches.
Dean didn’t have an answer to that. He could still taste the acidic sweetness of bile in his mouth, still smell it on the floor.
“Go on,” he says. “I’ll see you again soon.”
Season 15 timeline?
Dean’s first impulse is to tell Cas to fuck off. That he doesn’t need Cas to be his fucking therapist.
Hank puts his clipboard aside, as usual, and gives Dean a familiar smile.
Drunk Dean is a different kind of desperate. Cas honestly doesn't know if he's doing something wrong in letting Dean ask for what he wants when he's intoxicated enough to let himself want it. Cas has tried to talk to him about it when he's sober, but Dean always shuts him down, shuts him out. So Cas lets Dean ask for whatever he wants in whatever ways he can, and Cas just bears the uneasy guilt of it. He doesn't know how else to handle it. He doesn't want Dean disappearing on him again.
Dean listens to his future self's hoarse voice snapping off mostly short, irritated messages.
- or like Chuck and Amara. But it's not…
That was why Dean didn’t fight back, wasn’t it? Why he always stepped between them. Why the night that Sam left for Stanford, the night that Sam ripped the beating heart out of Dean’s chest, he’d ducked between them as they screamed at each other. Dean had thought of himself as an adult, or at least as a hunter, but Sam had been just a kid. He’d tried to let Sam be a kid. Tried to take it all on, so Sam wouldn’t see, so Sam wouldn’t hurt.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice is sleepy and worried at the same time when he picks up on the third ring. “What time is it? What’s wrong?”
Silver.
Cas thinks of this like a sickness, it has to get worse before it can get better. It's a cruel ward, this spell that was safeguarding the sanctuary. Cas can see how it is stripping Dean down, how it is progressively challenging him. And now that Dean has been hit over and over with his own traumatic past, now that he's a little cracked, a little open, Cas watches the ward tear into his weakened defenses.
Sam and Dean, and Cas most of all, have skirted and bargained and cheated death so many times over. They never know when will be the last.
“Goodnight, Dean.” Cas’ eyes are so intensely blue. They continue to stand there looking at each other, the seconds passing.
Sam's face is weary, like he's spent a lifetime not sleeping, a lifetime being chased by something. "Dean's cursed," he says after a long pause. "Got hit by something strong, something of demonic origin, we think, which is why we went to Crowley, the guy who brought you here. He's… let's just say he's something of an expert in demons. Anyway, in three weeks, at the next new moon, an ancient Greek marksman named Cerodicus is going to turn up with an arrow patterned to Dean's soul. So far, we've got nothing on how to stop it. But we didn't ask for this," he adds hastily. "We're not going to let either of you die. We'll just… we'll figure it out, we always do."
Dean hesitates. He doesn't, actually, almost as much as he does. "I just… I want to know what changed."
Sam spares a small, tight smile for this younger version of his brother. “Right. So. I’m going to fucking Utah, I guess. I’ll take one of the cudgels and -” Sam’s phone cuts him off, and he hurries to answer it, not really daring to hope it could be Dean.
Dean can’t. He just can’t.
Sam reaches the park bench and grins, holding out his arms.
It’s why he does odd things sometimes, things that it’s taken Cas a decade to recognize as part of a complex and often cruel defense mechanism. Even in the off moments when Dean could theoretically enjoy his time with Cas or Sam or Jack, when they drive without purpose in the Impala, when Dean’s singing along to his favorite tapes, headed towards a show or a field for stargazing or just a good beer, Cas has watched him shut down sometimes. It’s a frustratingly purposeful thing. As if Dean cannot let himself be happy, cannot let himself have this. After all this time, and he is still the man who does not believe he deserves to be saved.
“Thank you,” Cas murmured again into Dean’s hair. “Oh Dean. You are such a good man. So lovely and so good.”
Sam's expression is understanding but apprehensive. "Yeah," he says tentatively. "Sure. I can come with you, don't want you getting lost."
“I was thinking about, uh, about becoming a nurse.” Dean winces at the word and the silence that greets it on the phone.
But Dean is weak, and he keeps choosing Cas over and over. And Cas keeps letting him. So round and round they go.
Cas rests his cheek momentarily on the top of Dean's head, and Dean hears him inhale into his hair before he straightens back up. Dean almost ribs him about smelling him, but he stops himself. It's weird, but it's sweet. That's Cas' M.O. in a nutshell, really.
Cas looked just as broken as he moved in Dean as he had the first time. There was unabashed wonder in his face as he took him, pulled Dean's hips up to his, stared with that cracked intensity into Dean's face. Cas looked at Dean like he was the most beautiful, unfathomable creature he'd ever seen. Cas looked at him like it was taking every last ounce of his self-restraint not to say everything he was feeling.
If Dean was the type of guy to blush, he's pretty sure he'd be red all over, but as it is he just feels the flush of warmth in his chest and throws back the last of his whiskey. Sam looks nervously between them before focusing on Cas.
"I'm gonna go wake Dean - other Dean," he says. "He slept through breakfast yesterday, and you know how he is when he won't cook for himself."
"Sam," he says, slowly, like he thinks Sam is an idiot. "You fought off the devil. You took on Satan and you, little Sammy Winchester, you won."
“Yeah, okay buddy, let’s go.”
Cas makes a strained little sound and older Dean glances guiltily at him.
The things that seem to trigger full-blown flashbacks don’t make any sense at all to Dean. Once it was
Dean kisses Cas’ cheek and closes his own eyes. The music is kind of corny, but it doesn’t matter. He has this. Petty arguments and shopping lists and all. He has this.
It all goes to hell after that.
Hell was so long ago. A lifetime now, really.
"What happened to you?" younger Dean asks, his eyes on his coffee mug. "'Cause I'm coming from a weekend at Bobby's in 2005, Sam and I haven't talked in years, dad and I are barely speaking at this point, and I'm still not as pissed and prickly as you."
Cas thrusts up, his hands pulling Dean’s hip down in rhythm, and they’re definitely getting somewhere doing that. Dean is starting to have trouble keeping his thoughts from spiraling, but he focuses on just moving and Cas’ voice saying his name again.
at eight years old, but a person? Someone who is a friend of dad's?
“For what it’s worth, Dean, I’ve never met anyone who wasn’t worth saving.”
“I wasn’t supposed to,” Dean mutters finally. It’s not really a complete thought, but Sam has never needed those from him anyway.
He was so
When Dean recites the ritual and lights the bowl on fire, Crowley materializes in his blood-spattered apron, looking quite put out and holding the freshly bleeding head of a deer in one hand.
Dean pulls up the long driveway to his new garage, but he sits there a minute parked outside with the car off, thinking.
The vein of anger pulses stronger. Sam clenches his fist, fighting the temper that used to rear its head so often before the Cage.
"We met hunting Banshees," Sam says, careful to tap Eileen's shoulder first so that she can turn to read his lips. His hand lingers on her jacket for a moment too long.
Dean's eyes widen as he understands. "You'd die human?"
Deans shrugs this time, giving his brother a small smile. “I still think you, me, Cas, Eileen, and Jack at the beach is a nice picture. Young Dean can come too if he sticks around. Can’t really picture it, man, but if I could… sure. We’re getting old. Could be time to slow down.”
“I mean, yeah, I guess. But it’s not like… I mean, I’m functioning.” Dean can hear the defensiveness in his own voice. “And it’s all in the past, and things are fine now, so… There’s no reason I should need to be here, right? I’ve seen some shit, and I’ve done some things, but I’m friggin’ normal these days. I don’t even drink anymore.”
"Can we just… not psychoanalyze me right now? Can you just come to bed?"
Of course, this is the same thing as going numb. He can hide his emotions, his desires, his pain, from himself to some extent, but learning that trick means that sometimes Dean doesn’t feel anything. And that’s… It’s fine. It’s just like general emotional anesthesia. Better to cut off everything than to be awake for the surgery, or whatever. It’s not an extended metaphor.
The Dean next to him considers this. "Well, I haven't promised anything," he says. "You want me to do it?"
"Okay, old man. You're into him. I can tell." Dean tries to keep his own voice light and level. He's not sure he's telling the truth. He thinks there's a good chance it might destroy him if Cas did sleep with his past self. He's just also starting to think that maybe it's something they both deserve to have.
"Dude," Dean says as Cas dusts his hands off on his pants. "What the hell was that?"
Dean plays his part in all of this, will go on doing anything and everything to protect his little brother as best he can, but he's just self-aware enough to know that somewhere along the way it became Sam who is holding them all together. It's Sam who really acts like one of the Men of Letters, who took on responsibility with Earth Two's hunter organization. Somehow, in all of this, Sam turned out to be the stable one, the one who could take it all on without buckling. The one who jogs every morning and drinks green smoothies and can still laugh at Dean's jokes, can still like a girl without making it twenty different kinds of complicated.
"Dad." There are tears in Dean's eyes too, and for once it doesn't matter. There's no pretending here. There's no need to toughen up, put on a brave face, be daddy's little soldier. There's just this: All the pain between them, and all the understanding they never had the words or the time for in life.
Sam glances at Cas again. "Is it safe to tell him?"
Dean catches, through one cracked eyelid, Cas' hand ghosting across older Dean's shoulder.
Definitely not condoning Dean's behavior, but we'll talk more about that later (at least generally).
They were silent for another moment.
Sam glances at Dean, and Dean knows exactly what he’s thinking. Even if Chuck isn’t here on Earth at the moment, even if he isn’t orchestrating this, the situation with Heaven and Hell…
"Hey, no, it's listening time. You're a trainwreck, and I have watched you barrel through the last decade of your life with the brakes off, and I figured, well, the life we live, there are no healthy coping mechanisms. You just do the best you can with what you got, and if you wanna drink yourself half to death, okay, it'd be a wild dream come true to live long enough to see you die of liver failure. When you and Cas started hooking up - what, five years ago?"
"So you're God's accountant?"
And he flees, back to the room in this place that isn't his, but will be one day, in this life he shouldn't be seeing yet. It's his and not his. Himself and not himself.
Besides, if Dean isn't completely broken when he comes back, his utter panic about it will be a little bit delightful to watch.
Dean turns on the car and keeps the radio on low. Grief rackets around his ribs. It’s always there, ping-ponging back and forth all over his insides. Dean’s never taken Cas’ deaths well, of course, and the finality of this one is brutal. But on top of all of that is the grief for what could have been, what they could have been.
“It’s stupid,” Dean continues, a little muffled, into Cas’ thigh. “Not like we haven’t spent time apart before.”
on your
There's always been something weird and intense between Dean and Cas, he knows this. There is a tension that's been building in his body and between them for twelve goddamn years. That's more than enough for a repressed, traumatized bisexual with daddy issues to deal with - Dean really doesn't need words like "soulmates" and "true love" tossed around. He doesn't need to be having a crisis over this idea of their… their love as a paradox - something that exists because it exists because it exists.
Dean’s fingers twitched as if he wanted to reach for Cas again. “Please,” he mumbled.
Older Dean breathes out a string of profanities and stalks out of the room, his shoulders tense. Sam starts to go after him, then stops, looking back at Dean with a pained expression before exchanging glances with Cas. Dean gets the impression that they are having a silent conversation, an entirely mental version of rock paper scissors they've played before for
"Stop him," younger Dean says, then, back to Cas, "You're not killing yourself trying to save me when I've just saved you, dumbass."
Ahhhhhhhhhh
"No, you're not." Cas looks at him sadly, almost those same puppy-eyes that Sam gives him. "I'm sorry," he says again. "Sam wanted to be the one to come, but the spell… it might have been compromised by another human consciousness. And we don't have time for complications. We need to move, Dean."
Dean can see the two other guys shifting in his peripheral vision, but he doesn't tear his eyes away from this Supposedly-Sam's tired face.
Dean knows it’s a peace offering and he probably shouldn’t push it, but he does. “Can I drive?”
College actually wasn’t so bad. Dean went in with the expectation of clinging on by his fingertips for the eighteen months, and ended up completing the two full years he’ll need if he wants to become an RN at some point. He didn’t sail through or anything. There was one night in his second semester when he’d called Sam up, practically in tears, and said he was quitting.
"Hey little monster," Dean says, balancing the baby on his knees and bumping their noses together. The little boy reaches up and grabs a fistful of Dean's hair. Dean leans forward and blows a raspberry into the belly of the baby's onesie overalls. The boy giggles, full of absolute delight, and Dean laughs at his laughter. The love in this Dean's eyes is so obvious it's painful.
"No," he says, and his voice is icy too. "I don't know. What the fuck are you trying to say?"
Dean tries to see "Damian" in the mirror, that falsely self-sure and cocky kid who was all wide eyes and hollow-cheeked, all freckles and sharp hip bones, mouth wet, parted, and willing.
None of it was ever, ever good enough for John. Dean blamed himself, always has, for not being tough enough, for being too pretty, for not having a mind that went fast like Sammy's. Dean was always, always failing.
"You don't, like, just trigger a common law marriage by being in a relationship for long enough. You have to consider yourselves married and refer to yourselves that way to other people. Basically you have to be seen as a married couple in every way except legally. And even then it varies by state."
"Hey, Cas? What do you think is going to happen to me here?"
“Dean.” Cas sounds completely exasperated. “I have no intention of having sex with your past self.”
"Just." Dean spread his hands, gesturing at nothing in particular, at everything. "I mean. Come on, man. I'm no good for you, you know that. I'm like seven different kinds of fucked up and I'm never going to be able to give you what you want, what you should get to have."
Dean’s most reverent feelings come out in nature, though, and for once he lets the silence go between him and Cas. It’s another reminder of how well Cas knows him that he doesn’t seem to mind at all.
Cas leans into him, one hand fisting into Dean’s shirt - which, that’s fine, that’s cool, that’s a totally normal reaction under the circumstances and Dean is not going to think about it for any length of time at all.
Cas falters and he sighs again before continuing. "I think I loved you then. But I began to know it when we'd captured Alistair. You remember, with Uriel…"
Dean usually gets up with him. He likes the companionable silence over their coffee in the morning, likes the routine they have going. It makes him feel very
John's hand leaves a red mark on four-year-old Dean's face, and the boy reaches up to touch his cheek, staring up at his dad with his eyes wide.
"It's okay, Dean," Sammy had said, in a sad little voice that broke Dean's heart. "I can just stay in the regular classes. They're fine."
"To damnation," Dean says, raising his glass.
Older Dean lets out a long breath and abruptly turns away, vanishing back down the hall. Cas doesn’t go after him. He leans back against the wall and closes his eyes, but the hurt is plain on his face this time.
“I can’t,” Crowley snaps, giving it up. He sighs, drops the deer head on the floor with a sickening squelch, and reaches into the pocket on the black suit jacket he’s wearing under the apron. He pulls something out and tosses it to Cas, who catches it and looks down at the item, frowning. “It’s a one and done sort of thing. You should be thankful, I was planning to use it to clone myself for the most intensely pleasurable purposes.”
someone to step in it.”
Dean found himself mumbling Cas' name, one hand pulling his hair, one digging his nails into his own palm. It had been a long time since he'd done this, he never let himself do this, it was too complicated, too rife with triggers. But it was
Maybe Sam should have let Dean kill him. Maybe Sam is just sending Jack through a slower death. Maybe this is all still what Chuck wants.
Dean just wishes he was braver.
"You don't understand what you'd want with me." Dean catches a glimpse of hurt in Cas' face before he schools it into a gentle understanding and Dean feels immediately guilty. He doesn't want to fuck things up for his future self or hurt this guy, even if he is a total odd duck.
If Dean was being honest with himself, which he wasn’t, he hadn’t really expected to live to eighteen. He had a fake I.D., so being a legal adult didn’t feel that different, but still, he’d sort of figured he’d die young enough that he wouldn’t have to deal with the existential crisis of it all. He wasn’t sure how to just… go on living. He couldn’t just stay behind with Sam anymore, not when dad needed him and Sam didn’t. Dean liked hunting, but his purpose for so long had been taking care of Sammy. And soon enough, Sam might want to leave for college or something else, something more, and then what would Dean do? Follow him? Follow around after dad forever? The thought made him restless and hollow at the same time.
“Oh sure,” older Dean says, rolling his eyes. “Wouldn’t want to make you repeat yourself. Not like it’s about my life or anything.”
Twenty-six-year-old Dean had tried. He'd visited every step he thought his dad might have taken, called all the usual contacts, called all the morgues and hospitals in the three nearest states. He'd checked police scanners and bookings, called the national park rangers in the areas. He'd done everything he could think of. And then, in a panic, in the middle of the night, he'd gotten in his car and driven to California.
"What do you think?" Dean asks, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet, making the old wood floor creak beneath him. "I know it needs some repairs, but the foundation is sound and we can do most of the work ourselves. We're gonna have to scrap the barn if you're serious about keeping anything in it, but permits will be easy to get out here and I already looked into building models. We can have a whole barn raising, it'll be fun. Plus, if we decide we want more room, the lot next door has been for sale forever, Shannon says."
Dean looks down at the counter and tries to feel the weight of his own soul.
Once it was Cas’ hands on his stomach. They’d been making out in Dean’s bed, and Cas had been kissing the freckles on his shoulders, arms, and chest. He’d kissed Dean’s ribs, his stomach, down to his hips, thumbs brushing under the waistline of Dean’s jeans. Cas had teased his mouth over the front of Dean’s pants, lips pressed open along the line of his zipper, with his hands reaching back up Dean’s body. His fingertips had raked down Dean’s stomach, nails a light scratch over the softness of his belly, and Dean had lost his mind.
"I love you," Dean whispers to his ceiling, and rolls over to sleep on his stomach with one arm thrown over Miracle.
“No,” Hank says. “I don’t think so.”
The line of poetry is from "Almost Tenderly" by Carl Phillips. Highly recommend.
"Hey, who's that?" Dean asks the baby in his lap. "Who's that big tree talking to us?"
It’s not exactly happiness or peace, but it’s the first time in a long time that Dean hasn’t felt mainly empty. The first time he’s
To Cas' surprise, as the hospital is swirling around them, reforming into something unknown, present-day Dean says "I know that all of that… I know I shouldn't have handled things like that."
“Your brother seems very proud of you.” Hank’s voice is mild. Dean glances up at him, but his face doesn’t give anything away. “He seems, ah, protective of you.”
"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor… But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it."
Dean shows Jack how to start the fire, so it takes a while before it really gets going, but then the three of them are sitting around roasting marshmallows on sticks and Dean just feels…
“I know.” Cas flashes him a smile. He still looks tired, but it’s nice to see him smiling. “I don’t mind.”
It's the closest all night that Sam's expression has come to remorse, but he shakes his head. "I can't do it. Not anymore. Come with me or don't, but I'm going to California."
“Cas… Cas…”
"Look, are you ever going to talk to me about what happens to us?" Younger Dean shifts in his chair. "Sam told me some stuff last night about the last couple of years. Getting possessed by an angel, and Cas dying, and you and Cas, uh, falling out pretty bad recently over this Jack kid getting someone killed. He wanted to make you seem less like an asshole, you know. But he said there was stuff you should be the one to tell me about what happened after… after dad died."
Dean sighs, squinting off a little wistfully at the red rock in the distance. “No, I’m not gonna run.”
Dean remembers what Jack said the last time he saw him.
John goes to the empty bed and sinks onto it. He looks like a shell of a man. It's worse than Dean remembers, actually. He can see the shaking in his dad's hands, see the lines deepening in the circles beneath his eyes, see the way he is looking at his empty hands like he doesn't know what to do with them. Only Sammy has gotten any sleep.
“Didn’t make it in,” he mumbles. He turned his phone on silent after the fifth text from Sam earlier, unable to face his brother’s judgement and disappointment. “I didn’t know there was a - a… like a personal history form. And I don’t want to… I mean, I don’t even want to talk about it in the first place. I sure as shit don’t want to write it down and have to like…”
Well, what the hell at this point, right?
It was a simple, naked truth. Nothing Dean didn't know already. Nothing Dean wasn't already expressing back with his actions. That was the Winchester way - finding other ways to say "I love you", in a home-cooked meal, in a mix-tape, in stitching skin back together.
"You were choosing to stay. Yeah. And I should have seen that. I should have seen you weren't thinking straight, should've tried harder to convince you to come home."
Sam’s mind gets too full of, well, everything to sleep, sometimes. He has a Greek chorus of myths running through his head - the story of the goddess Psykhe who was the deification of the soul, the story of Zeus splitting eight-limbed proto-humans in two and creating soulmates, the story of Patrocolus’ soul unable to rest until his remains had been laid with Achilles’.
Cas sighs. "He is in no way our child," he tells Rhonda wearily.
Dean lays on his stomach and tries to turn off his brain, but it just keeps spinning. He’ll probably be dead soon, or someone will be. He doesn’t let himself think about where he’ll go when that happens. A part of him just… It’s not that he wants to die, not really. It’s just that, when he does, he wants it to be over. Heaven or Hell, whatever’s waiting for him, he just wants to know that that’s it, there’s no more false hope in coming back, no more hurt he can cause Sam.
Dean’s stone number one has always been family. Sammy, when it comes right down to it, but, yeah, people. Saving people, hunting things. Loving people. Losing them.
" and he hangs up, handing the phone back to Sam. "They're going to scan over a copy today. I gave them your email. The text they have is in the original Greek, but apparently they have a foreign exchange student who has been working on an English translation, so they'll send that too."
It was the most vulnerable Dean had ever felt around Cas. Cas' expression, the feel of him, letting Cas' weight pin him down without fighting it, letting him take control of their bodies, letting Cas have him, fuck him, mumble into his ear that he was "incredible. Dean. You are incredible. You are the most unbelievably beautiful man I have ever met."
God is dead.
"S'funny, I used to just sort of drift from town to town. My whole life, I guess, but especially when I started hunting for real myself. Used to find the local spots between cases and make friends with whoever I came across. I'm good at that - getting strangers to talk, y'know. I used to have a spot back in Kansas, where we were based before, knew the owner of the bar and all the regulars. Just a place to go drink and play pool. So I know I could do that here. Even if I'm not drinking, s'easy enough to hit up a bar, chat, charm a few folks. But the thing is…" Dean looks back at the carpet. He thinks about the morning he spent digging in the dirt with Cas, the serenity of the early morning light on the garden beds, the rich earthy smell, the dampness of the soil, the dogs playfully yapping at each other as they skated just around the perimeter of the garden beds.
Sam pulled himself together, easing his hand off the doorknob. He glanced at his brother, his hands curled loosely in Cas’ shirt, looking softer than Sam had seen him in a long time. He knew Dean hadn’t been sleeping, that he’d been fighting Michael all the time these days. For the first time in recent memory, Dean's face was smoothed out, mouth slightly open, breathing slow and heavy, no trace of nightmares or the waking weight on his shoulders. It was good to see Dean like this, but bittersweet to be reminded of how rare it was.
It was Dean who broke his own rules.
“Rhonda, my love, I don’t know what you put in that coffee, but it’s gonna keep you young long after the rest of us are spinning in our graves,” Dean says, giving the waitress one last grin and a wave.
Younger Dean coughs, and Cas leans back from his face, still holding his hand. When younger Dean’s fit subsides there is blood on his lips. He sucks in a great sigh and then tries to look around, too weak to raise his head off the ground.
Dean blinks a few times, then cautiously sits up. He's back in the spare room. The digital clock on the nightstand says 10:00pm, and, assuming its the same day, that doesn't seem unreasonable.
Now-Dean is expecting this vision, whatever it is, to fade, but instead he finds himself following this older Dean out of the park.
Dean calls the realtor in Colorado and asks if she can expand her search into Wyoming.
“We’ll start searching tomorrow on a grid, go over everything again, anywhere you missed,” he says tonelessly.
And that's it.
Of course, this Charlie isn't really forty-one year-old Dean's Charlie. He can't look at her without seeing the blood in that bathtub, the mutilated corpse of one of his closest friends. Charlie was one of the few people who had ever coaxed a softness out of Dean, who had loved Dean for his somewhat repressed geekiness.
“Helped out a lot last year, when Sam and Eileen - that’s Sam’s fiance - were both starting college, and we didn’t want to… I don’t know, we kind of only just retired, you know? I guess we were all worried about something coming after us. Didn’t want to leave Jude with someone who didn’t know what to look out for. Honestly, if he was my kid, I don’t know if I would even now. But someone at Eileen’s synagogue runs a daycare, and he goes there now. But anyway, yeah, I still see them most weeks.”
“Yeah!” Charlie grins. “‘It’s okay to be Takei!’ That’s his motto, and I love him. We’ve also got Ian McKellan, Neil Patrick Harris, Frank Ocean… Anyway, it’s still definitely scary sometimes, in some parts of the country, but most people are super chill. But like, back in your day, all we ever heard about was gay people getting killed or killing themselves, right? And I remember growing up feeling so small and alone. And then the internet happened and I started finding other people who felt like me, even if I couldn’t meet them in person, and things got so much better just knowing how many of us are out there. I mean, I’m saying it like “one of us, one of us,” but it’s like, a whole community.”
Sometimes, Cas likes to read Dean poetry. It was kind of like the music thing, where Dean allowed it at first mostly because he felt bad about shutting down so much of what Cas really wanted from him. And anyway, it wasn’t so bad to lie there with his head on Cas’ lap or chest, listening to the rumble of his gravel voice, Cas’ free hand playing with Dean’s hair. Cas really liked poetry in general, and there was a lot of it that Dean didn’t get, but that was fine. It was the poems he did get that were a problem, the ones that skipped over all the flowery metaphorical bullshit and cut straight through him. Dean carries those around with him, the way he does song lyrics, and they never really go away.
But take a fundamental belief, like, say "the Bible prohibits sexual relations between two men" and present the evidence that, actually, the words
Dean scoots over, leans his face farther down.
The memory-Dean is… what? Twenty-three? Twenty-four? Dean can't really remember, which is something of a surprise. Whatever age he is, he's an idiot, the way he fumbles through excuses for why he has to leave town, again, why he's always bailing, why he sometimes comes back through all scratched up.
And now here they are, perilously close to middle-aged, still each other's greatest anxiety, greatest comfort.
Content Warnings: Abuse, emotional abuse, (light) verbal abuse, abandonment
"Uh." Dean would probably have laughed at anyone who said "social support network" to him in his life, but the answer is not really funny. "That's kinda it. We've got the hunter network and some friends who are still in it. My friend Charlie's been heading the central network since we left, sometimes we video chat, and our friends Garth and Jody check in once in a while. But… it's, uh, if you're trying to leave the life, it's hard to stay in touch."
"But… is he… I mean, you say he's our kid, but whose kid is he, really?"
Eileen is first out of the - Jack help him - Prius that pulls up Dean's driveway. She leaps out and barrels into Dean for a hug, which he returns with pleasant surprise. He's not used to touch like this.
"Well," Dean says to the three-way silence hanging between them all. "'Night. See you in the morning."
The memory swirls and blends, and Dean thinks this will be it, but no, it turns into another hotel room, one of the thousands from Dean's life, but this one is a 5-star, swanky, sleek suite, and there's only one period in Dean's life when he was staying in places like this.
By the time Sam heads out to the kitchen, older Dean is up and drinking coffee standing. He looks hungover, but Sam can't tell if that's from alcohol or just his general state of mind at the moment. Knowing Dean, probably both.
When she's gone, Dean shoves Sam and says "move. I'm gonna hit the head."
, Dean doesn’t even complain.
"Yeah, it's not an argument because there's not going to be any arguing. I'm older than you which means a) you should listen to me, and b) I've got dibs on death. Wait your turn."
. Real. He’s lost him too many times, even in Heaven he doesn’t take Cas’ existence for granted.
Why else would he leave like this? Sam has talked about running away before, yeah, but he always tried to convince Dean to come with him. He always talked about it as them both getting out. Dean can’t believe that Sam, Sam of all people, would abandon him.
Twenty minutes later, Dean has a jacket with a hefty stake resting in the inside pocket, a backpack with an axe and a couple other tools, and a passport that shows his face ten years from now. Cas doesn’t appear to have gathered anything. Older Dean hovers anxiously in the background while Jack sits with his computer at the kitchen table, ignoring them. Sam, however, with the air of someone asking for the impossible, says “Just don’t do anything stupid. Try to make it quick, okay? Take whatever time you need to recover, Cas, but I don’t like the idea of any of us being out in the open right now.”
"What's going on? You alright?"
Cas watches as all of Dean tightens, tries to hold on to whatever it is inside of him that copes with his own self-hatred and guilt, but he's sliding. He's dropped Cas' hand and is standing with his arms crossed over his chest, letting the memories wash over him. Like this is something he deserves too.
Christ. That's so far over Dean's head that he wants to let it drown him.
Dean forces a grin, all distracting charm and charisma that has never fooled Sam. "Me? I'm too old for that."
Dean still hesitates, looking at four hundred dollars in cash and wondering if it's worth crossing this line.
When they start walking again, Cas doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand.
Cas pushed Dean’s legs apart, and he simply didn’t have the words for this part of Dean’s body, so he followed the brush of his fingers with his mouth and tried to let his tongue show appreciation with something other than words.
but I bet it helps anyway, don't you think?"
Sam breathes out again and slowly clambers to his feet. In his head, it feels like it takes ages. There's a lot of him to unfold, after all.
"Yeah."
"You're leaving out the third option," younger Dean says, his voice too glib to be entirely natural. "Third option is that I do what I got pulled here for. I mean, I'm just a copy. I'm not even supposed to be alive right now, so -"
Title notes: In Through the Out Door - Led Zeppelin Album
"I can't stay, you know," Cas says. It's apologetic and hopeful all at once. "Not yet."
Dean breaks off with a little involuntary sound that he’s never going to admit to making. Cas is breathless beneath him, head still tilted up to him, eyes wide and staring at Dean with a kind of understanding that makes Dean want to hide.
Is that supposed to be his son?
Which. Okay.
Sam snorts. "Yeah. Got that myself." He toes Dean's side with his boot. "We might as well take a break. Eileen's heading out, so come say goodbye and we'll fix up leftovers or something."
and Dean screams with the pain of breaking bone. He pulls himself through the dizziness of it all to lean his head up and spit into the vampire's face, because Dean Winchester is going to go down a defiant little shit until the very end. But just as the vampire wipes his spit away and leans in with hot, putrid breath between his fangs, everything goes red.
Dean glanced at him. "You know, it's not even noon yet. There was that turn off for the national forest a couple miles back…?"
to do the things they asked you for?”
"Sure you don't need me for Missouri? The crops could be nothing."
“I’m fine, Sammy.” Dean can’t get away with hugging Sam, not now, not without ringing every alarm bell they’ve got. He settles for clasping Sam’s shoulder on the way out.
Dean snorted. “Yeah, okay, good luck with that. Pretty sure that’d take a couple of years or a tongue bath.”
Dean cries himself to sleep after that, lulled faintly by Miracle’s steady breaths under his hand.
Jack's frowning at Sam too. "What's being an angel got to do with it?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The silent treatment never worked on Sam when he was older and started pissing their dad off himself, but it was torture for Dean. In some ways, Dean would rather John hit him, because at least then it was over, at least Dean knew when the punishment would end. For Dean, trying desperately to keep his family together, trying to please, trying so damn hard to make the only two people he had in the world proud of him, losing John's already sparse attention was like having his guts pulled out.
Cas’ eyebrows furrowed as he searched Dean’s face, one of Dean’s feet rubbing lazily between Cas’ calves. There is so much that Cas had never said out loud, and so much that he’d only ever told Dean.
When Miracle calms down a bit, Dean clambers back up to his feet and sheepishly returns Jody's hug. Claire and Kaia are on a road trip, she informs him over a beer, but she promises to send his regards. She doesn't chastise him for not picking up the phone for six months, just ruffles his hair and offers him some potato salad.
and for some reason a book of poetry.
Cas runs his big hands over Dean's body in the shower, rubbing warm water and soap into his skin. Dean's body has changed over the last -
"I hate that movie," both of them say at the same time.
Dean blinks, swallows, and looks away again. His only exposure to therapy has been through movies and TV shows, and that one time in a psychiatric institution when a wraith made him hallucinate up a shrink. His own subconscious had reproduced exactly the kind of psychiatrist he’d seen on television; demanding, accusatory, and unhelpful.
It toppled something in Dean's chest, the careful way Cas spoke, that he thought Dean might just walk out of there. It made Dean feel a little monstrous.
"Cas, you dumbass," older Dean mutters. "You could have gotten yourself killed. You don't have the juice to be jumping timelines."
"What are we, anyway?" He feels stupid asking it, it's the kind of question that would make him bolt if a girl asked him that, but he has no context here.
If Dean is supposed to lay all of his fucking emotions out for this place, if he’s supposed to resolve everything that’s ever gone wrong in his past, then they are shit out of luck. There is no amount of time that is going to be enough for him to come to terms with it all.
Jack frowns into his cup of coffee, that confused, I'm-actually-only-three-years-old sort of look he still gets from time to time. Sam tries very hard not to worry about this in terms of their plans for him.
Jo breaks away, triumphant and stuffs the roll whole into her mouth, managing to stick her tongue out around it.
“I know.” Cas’ mouth twitches a little bit, like it’s going for a sad smile but can’t quite make it.
"Anyway. The desert did you good, huh?"
Dean snorts at this. “Art world contacts?”
Dean glares harder at the table. No Banshees yet. Barely any demons. No angels. No leviathan. No Chuck.
"They're just so formulaic," Cas says with a slightly pained expression. "And I'm human now, I only have room for so much memory. These superhero movies, they never give you enough human interest to really be moving."
Dean had been so hungry, but after that first night he wasn't going to bring it up. He'd just made sure Sammy was fed and tried to ignore the new sensation of his gnawing stomach.
“Christ, Sammy, haven’t we had enough goddamn heart-to-heart today?”
Dean leans his foot down on the gas, lets the Impala speed up until she's flying through the dark, her headlights only just illuminating the curves in the road in time to take turns sharp enough that she feels like she might tip over. Dean doesn't worry about tickets, not out here, not this late at night. True, getting pulled over for speeding is the second-to-last thing he needs right now, but the
"Dean," Cas tries. Then louder. "Dean."
Mary smiled, and no matter how complicated things were, Dean was still helpless to his mother’s smile. “Hey, I’m a person too. And it was the 70s. Small town kids gotta make their own fun, you know?”
"I… We had an… argument." Cas shifts on his feet. "Last night."
Every piece of self-preservation he had told Dean to say no, to shut him down and out, just turn off and stiff until the tenderness in Cas' voice went away.
"C'mon," Sam says, clapping Dean on the shoulder. "Ignore him. Let's go."
It doesn’t matter how it happened, only that this makes sense. This seems fair.
Dean sighs. “Yeah. Okay. Both of those are good, but I meant like… I don’t know, you guys ever just go out for dinner or, like, hiking or something?”
Dean had kept their eyes locked, biting his own lip to keep himself from saying the traitorous thing that his whole body wanted to pour over Cas, wanted to break over, wanted to confess.
Dean narrows his eyes. He's pretty sure this is what passes for Cas' deadpan humor.
"Cas, I need you to stay here."
, if you will, that creates a double standard wherein the use of alcohol to cope with emotional distress is seen as natural, but the use of prescription drugs to treat emotional distress is seen as weak. Do you see the irony here?”
Somewhere along the way, in fixing up the house and buying plants and all this domestic shit, Dean starts talking to Cas. He tells himself it isn't that weird. After all, he used to pray to the guy all the time. And yeah, Dean knows that probably Cas can't hear him anymore, but that's not really the point. Cas never really answered his prayers in words before either.
“I like talking to him better when we’ve got something to threaten him with.”
“I don’t hate him,” Dean says finally, quietly, staring at the door, willing it to catch fire the way that door number one had.
“You think?”
Cas had caught his weight, of course, hands already trying to steady him as Dean looped his arms around his neck and mashed their mouths together.
Now-Dean stares at the baby, his heart racing. He doesn't know what this is - a dream, a vision, a look into the future.
Then it's Cas, blown up the first time by Raphael.
in Cas' expression. Dean feels a sudden surge of protective anger; he knows what rejection feels like, how these little daily dismissals of what Cas is offering have to settle like stones.
"Yeah," Cas says, wishing already that he could take it back. The whole night has been strange.
Dean closes his eyes and he is going to blame the tears on his broken arm and almost dying. He wipes at his face angrily, mortified to be
Cas gives him this tiny little smile that manages to be both sad and pleased. "I'm glad to think you might feel more comfortable thinking about your sexuality here, Dean. But what you and I have, it's complicated. By more than orientation. There is a lot of loss between us, and other things that Dean has never come to terms with, I think. He feels safer, this way, and I don't begrudge him that."
Dean and Cas stare at the soot-blackened door for a moment.
Younger Dean sits up and puts his head in his free hand. "I'm not saying I don't believe you. I'm just saying it's crazy. But what about our lives has ever made sense?"
(See the end of the chapter for
But he can't.
yet," Cas says mildly. "Why God would create and abandon this world, why bad things happen to good people, why so many prayers go unanswered."
Sam doesn’t complain when Dean claims the driver’s seat again. They pull out onto the highway, headed home. This time, though, when Dean turns on the music, Sam has put in one of Cas’ tapes. Dean scowls over at his brother, who is outright laughing at the look on his face as Celine Dion plays in the car.
Sam can laugh about it all he wants, but Dean finds he actually doesn’t mind the eager college kids traipsing around his property. They’re all so in awe of Cas, like he’s not just some nerdy dude with dirt under his fingernails and leaves in his hair. Like the rumble of his voice shakes something in the very earth itself, mesmerizing students, plants, and animals. Like Cas’ own reverence for creation sows the seeds of a practical worship; a cult following in his methods of treasuring life.
Dean swats her hand away but he can feel his cheeks already heating.
Dean’s fingers itch for a beer. He’s not looking too hard at how much he’s been drinking. Theoretically, with less hunts and less horrors, he has the impression he ought to slow down on Hunter’s Helper, but he is already feeling unmoored. Alcohol is an easy thing to fall back on when so much is changing.
Dean is going to
"You just? What? You fall in line."
Eighteen-year-old Dean stops scrabbling at the demon's hands as he presses the pillow over his nose and mouth, suffocating him. He fumbles instead for his clothes, discarded on the floor. He's going lightheaded by the time he fishes the necklace out of his jeans pocket and blindly shoves the Magen David into the demon's face.
Dean hasn't seen a doctor outside of an emergency room or a case since he was a kid. He's not even sure if medical doctors are allowed to make mental health diagnoses.
Everyone is still milling about the kitchen when Sam returns. They’re all waiting on him, and Sam knows that it makes sense this time, but the pressure of having to be in charge, of having to make the decisions when all he really wants to do is lie down and sleep, gives him a headache.
by The Beatles.
“As am I.”
And orders… Dean could laugh at the cosmic irony there if it didn't make him feel so sick. He remembers when they first met Chuck Shirley, when they thought he was a harmless, dorky little writer who didn't know they were real. Chuck had bemoaned how he had killed Jessica, all for the sake of symmetry in Sam's storyline. Dean can't help thinking of everything in terms of plot these days, in literary analysis, trying to see Chuck's next move. There's a certain kind of symmetry in Dean's storyline - from the soldier following dad's orders, to the rebel fighting against the ordinances of God. Maybe, in some ways, this is what Chuck wants. He built Dean, after all. Maybe he's been shaped for this just to give God's show a fitting end, a fully realized character arc.
That’s when things start to get strange.
It is everything. Dean is carrying it inside him everywhere he goes; Cas and his love.
this," Cas said. His voice was tentative, full of an overwhelming affection.
Thirty years in Hell broke Dean, and the
"When did you know?"
"Dad? Say something."
“I’ve had clients who have killed and raped and tortured. Clients who have done awful things, with or without cause. My job, my only job, is to help them find a way to forgive themselves for things they did in order to survive. A way to come to terms with themselves. I’m not here to pass judgment on you, Dean. You can talk about what you did, if you’re able to tell me about it.”
“I…” Dean starts. He doesn’t have anywhere he’s going with that.
and Cas had gripped his hand tight for the entire rest of that drive.
"Hey, I missed you too, bitch. Sorry I was stubborn too."
"Yep," Sam says, seeming to smile in spite of himself at Dean's disbelief and excitement. "Pretty cool, right?"
It burns a little, and Dean is biting his own tongue to keep from making any noise about that. Cas mumbles his name, still with that broken awe from their first night together, the way he always does, and Dean loves him.
"Yeah," Sam says. His voice breaks. "Go look at a farm. He would've liked that."
"You know, he's got a point," Eileen says. "Not about killing kids, but I mean about the whole "deserving" thing. An eternity of torture for a life you had very little control over? I always liked the idea that there was a sort of purgatorial period after death, where maybe you were punished for or made up for your sins, but eventually you ended up in Heaven. Or at least, some place like Hades where it isn't Hell or Heaven, it's just neutral. I mean, why create souls just to measure them against a system you made and find them wanting? Why test your creations if you're not going to set the conditions to be equitable? I know God is a dick, so it makes sense, but where's the chance for redemption or restorative justice?"
"Afraid not."
Older Dean gives her a mock scowl, but he just says “Fine, whatever. Take your pick.”
"I wasn't done," Cas murmurs when Dean lets him go.
It's the sad, tired, kind of schlumpy guy who kisses Dean who is also the first person to want to hold him after. He pulls Dean into his chest, their bodies aligned, spooning, just cuddling him. And what Dean hated in that moment more than anything was the realization that he wanted something like this.
"Try not to get killed, and I'll see you in a couple days," she says.
"Okay, okay. Shut up."
“Yeah?” Dean takes a sip of his decaf coffee. The mug is still warm in his hands and he feels snug in his jacket, just warm all the way through, really. “You guys are serious about taking the twins from foster care, huh?”
“No, of course not,” Dean mumbles, not really giving it proper thought. It’s the same old refrain, anyway: what Dean wanted didn’t matter. “But it - it doesn’t matter. I still did it. I mean, I still chose to do it.”
"Tell me something, Cas. You say "the observable universe." Is the unobservable universe Chuck's multiverse, or...?"
Dean gives up on the “things to do in Lebanon, KS” Google search and tries for broader Kansas. There are a couple of breweries that he keeps in mind, but he’s not sure Cas and Jack would find it all that fun hanging around a brewery shooting the shit with the locals who always seem to populate them. Which, actually, now that he thinks about it, might be kinda sad - that the reason Dean likes breweries is talking to strangers. Not being alone. Fuck.
So at least that's progress.
Dean notices Sam's hesitation as he leads him up the hallway, just a step ahead with his freakishly long legs.
"No, of course not. Dean…" Cas pauses for a long time as they look up at the sky together. "I would have come sooner if I could. Jack and I have been trying to untangle Chuck's messes, and I've been busy with Death. I assume Bobby told you."
It took some time, but Dean extracted himself without waking the other boy up. Levi’s face was so soft in his sleep, and Dean stood just staring at him for a moment, feeling something unnameable in his chest. He wondered how someone his age could still be so soft, how Levi could say the word “gay” without cringing.
Or fuck, Dean doesn't know, maybe it is. He donated
“Not for your body, Dean,” Cas went on, pressing his mouth to the dip of Dean’s lower back, thumbs stroking over the sides of his hips. “Although it is a good body. A beautiful, achingly beautiful, body. But do you know how deeply you are cared for? How much love is reflected back into your soul? Sometimes I think the gravitational well of your love and conviction must curve spacetime, that your being is so singular that it could tear apart the laws of physics as much as the law of Heaven.”
But it did. It was.
Dean clams up for a moment. He’s never been fully honest about it, not even to Sam, not even to Cas. Dean was twenty-two at the time, and he wants to say that it was a lifetime ago. That it doesn’t matter now, after all these years, that he and Sam have talked it over and the sting of it is long gone.
They fought and killed and died for
Dean scrubs a hand over his face, pulling the threads of his composure back into his iron grip. "Tell you what, Sammy, I need a damn drink. You got any alcohol  in this bunker?"
Not by choice anyway.
The form on the clipboard has a section for his name, address, medical history, and any current prescription. After that, there are a series of what look to Dean like short essay questions on an exam. He skims over them all at once.
Dean winces. He hears what goes unsaid there - Gadreel, mostly. And yeah. Yeah. Dean's messed up with Sammy too, he knows that, he
Cas insists on doing a little ritual before they break off any limbs. He sits down in front of the tree and puts his hands on it, eyes closed. Dean watches him. Cas is… The word Dean wants to use is
Devil Makes Three songs in the order they appear: Chase the Feeling, All Hail, Chains are Broken, Paint My Face
"Fuck," now-Dean mutters. "Really? More of this?"
"Here, let me show you."
Sam pulls a rectangular something out of his jeans pocket. "Half past six, why?"
"Dean, Jesus, just -"
Cas gives him the smallest smile, just a twitch in the corner of his mouth, but it… helps.
Cas didn't really have, or at least know, a gender until Jimmy. And it wasn't his vessel who gave him one, not really.
Cas kisses sloppily, like a teenager, but it doesn’t matter because he presses so eagerly against Dean, his hands on him, and the feeling of it is like a current through Dean’s entire body.
It's funny enough to hear Cas say "gutterpunk" that now-Dean almost laughs.
Rhonda is saying something like "pleasure to meet you," and Dean is vaguely aware of his own voice responding, but his whole body has tensed and he suddenly feels trapped in the booth, stuck behind Sam.
“Did you try the airplane thing?”
"Hm?"
Dean wants to defend John, even now. Wants to say
They didn't need to. Dean didn't know what his father might or might not have seen, but he'd decided it didn't matter. The thing with Graves had just been… a fluke. An experiment. A moment of loneliness and loss at the hands of a bottle of whiskey. And if it was something that him feel that much shame in the presence of his father, if his dad couldn't even
Sam doesn’t say anything, and Dean sort of slumps down in the dirt with his knees pulled up to his chest, hugging them to him, consciously stopping himself from rocking forward like a little kid trying to soothe themselves. He’s all fucking wrung out and raw, and he knows this is happening as much from their earlier conversation as the from the revelation of this newly re-opened wound. Sam’s right about that, at least, that it’s all piled on top of each other.
Dean narrows his eyes and tries to spot any of his brother's tells. Either Sammy developed an incredible poker face in the last decade and a half, or he's telling the truth.
Sam frowns over their gently knocking fists and Cas looks like he desperately wants to heal them both, but neither of them comments and Dean retrieves his own coffee in peace.
“Sure. I’m getting this for Sam.” Dean holds up the bison. On impulse, he reaches over and plucks an elephant off the shelf. “And Cas is getting this one.”
“Did he hurt you?” Sam asks in the same gentle voice.
"Are you sorry you asked?" Cas' face is a little worried, all his familiar earnestness written in the lines of his forehead.
“Dean…”
None of this is real. It's all in his head.
Happy 100,000 friends!
Dean tries, unsuccessfully, to turn down the song in his head. It keeps looping through his thoughts whenever it seems like he was about to forget it. And if that ain’t just a metaphor for Cas…
