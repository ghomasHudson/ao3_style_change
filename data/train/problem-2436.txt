How much hurt could someone face and swallow, before becoming prey to an all consuming anger? And to the sequence of unhealthy coping mechanisms, consequent bad decisions, subsequent regrets, and inevitable self-loathing that anger would jump start?
and I-“, and the stress of the last couple of weeks simply melts away. Dean’s hypnotized by the look of shock on Cas’s face when he takes in the table set for their dinner, the candle light around the room, the barely audible music playing in the background.
When he had no more excuses to put the inevitable off any longer, he went to the office. “You’ve been avoiding me, why?”
Worst of all is that, the longer the whole thing goes on, the smugger and more daring in his appreciation the kid gets, and the sulkier and insecure Dean becomes, both of his ability to still being able to entice his amazing boyfriend and of the strength of their relationship. Because the thing is, there is a reason the kid is getting smugger. Is it really possible that Cas doesn’t see? Doesn’t he have even the tiniest suspicion? And if he does, shouldn’t he, like, put a stop to it? Or, you know, shouldn’t it be enough for Dean to have expressed his concerns for Cas to listen, even if he thinks Dean’s being a little crazy?
the same thing for his baby brother – even though, at 6.4 feet, it would be quite difficult to find someone bigger than Sam.
A gasp. Cas gasped when Dean bit him and he whimpered a little. Bites were OK too. There would be time to gauge Cas’s thoughts on marks and bruises.
He started by cupping his face and looking him in the eye for a couple of seconds, before lowering his eyes to look at those plushy lips he was a little obsessed with. Cas’s tongue darted out to wet them and Dean dived in. He kissed him softly at first, his lips on his boy’s, nothing more. He opened his eyes to check on Cas and saw him relaxed, with his eyes closed and his hands where Dean had told him to put them, never once breaking position. He was always so, so good.
“Love you too,” Cas replies, frantically kissing Dean now. When he stops kissing him, Cas fixes his impossibly blue eyes on Dean’s and starts laughing, as if he’s suddenly realized something supremely funny. “Dean,” he says, between a moan and a laugh and a punched out noise – because Cas’s actions might have made Dean’s rhythm falter a bit, but he hasn’t stopped fucking him and he has no intention to – “We’re getting
The answer is given before he even asks though. A throat being cleared alerts Dean that he's no longer alone and when he lifts his head what he sees is beyond endearing. Cas is standing, shy and awkward in his own living room, his eyes wide and vibrant, his face still flushed – and Dean would lie if he said that knowing he's the one who put that lovely shade of red on Cas's cheeks doesn't make his cock stir in a valiant attempt to rejoin the party, in spite of it still being trapped in the mess of drying come inside of his pants – holding something in his hands, which he seems to be using as a shield. A change of clothes. Which can only be intended for Dean, since Cas has already changed into a pair of sweats and a t-shirt.
love. And I will not have you joking about being with anybody else, even if that somebody is just another version of me.”
Dean doesn’t need him to elaborate. Doesn’t reply with “What do you mean?”. He knows. He’s known all along the dance they’ve danced so far was meant to give Castiel the time and the means to make up his mind.
Dean can’t help an indulgent smile of his own. “You got inside of me months ago, Cas. This would just make it official.”
Dean’s moaning shamelessly, saying “yes, yes, yes” on repeat, loving how Cas’s dick grazes against his prostate and how the sounds they are making will really make everyone outside the door aware of what it is they’re doing. It’s not like that’s unheard of, it’s the fucking restroom of a fucking gay club, of course it’d be used to fuck, but Dean loves that Cas is fucking him so loudly in here, that he has no qualms in making everyone who might be passing by know he enjoys fucking Dean.
When it was finally time to go, Dean literally flew out of the body shop and definitely started walking a little faster than usual. He stopped to buy a bottle of water, a turkey sandwich and a fruit salad, because his brother was a broken record when it came to “eating healthy, Dean”, so Dean knew far too well that fruit contained a lot of vitamins, and he figured it could only do good to someone dealing with a cough and a cold.
That’s how he finds out that Cas is an only child, when Dean tells him about the banter between him and Sammy and Cas replies that it must be nice having siblings, that he wouldn’t know because he has none. Or that he’d rather eat meat than fish but doesn’t hate greens as much as Dean does, when he tells him that Sammy had tricked him into eating a soy burger because “it looked
“No, Cas, please. Don’t defend me. God knows I don’t deserve it. I’m not-“ Dean sighs, scrubbing his face with one hand, which comes back wet with his tears and his snot and it’s fucking gross, but he can’t bring himself to care about that now or worry about what a disgusting picture he must make to Cas at the moment. “I’m not looking for absolution here,” he confesses. “I-. Please, let me finish?”
So he looks at Cas with suggestive eyes and says “I wish, Gabe. I have offered, in fact. Cas here ain’t interested.”
brain quips. His brain isn’t as amusing as it thinks it is), cooking together, going grocery shopping together, fighting over who gets to control the remote controller. He’s fantasized about being Dean’s boyfriend, because he
Dean’s flustered “Shut up” seems to suggest that teasing him was also a good choice. He does appear more relaxed now. But he’s also... embarrassed?
That’s when he realized being casual didn’t mean they couldn’t exchange numbers. Private numbers were, well, private and personal, that was true, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t be used for strictly logistical reasons. No good morning and goodnight texts, no cat gifs, no uplifting or motivational memes. Just short, straight to the point texts to arrange a meeting time and place. And sexting. Dean supposed sexting was well within the boundaries of their absolutely casual, exclusively sexual relationship. Yep, texting was definitely something they should do. Dean wondered if it would be too hard to convince Cas to send him pics and videos of himself getting off. It probably would. Dean would have so much fun trying though.
They get in front of a door with Cas’s name on it. Hannah knocks, waits for Cas to reply ‘come in’ and opens the door for Dean with a smile, closing it behind him.
Dean’s suddenly dizzy because of all of his blood rushing downstairs in a swoosh. Cas’s smug smile confirms his predicament didn’t pass unnoticed. Not one to back down from a challenge, Dean tries to regain some footing. “Yeah? You wanna go all sexy cowboy on me?”
, let’s add a little jealousy to the mix, that’s even better. Cas and Benny get along fairly well, but his boyfriend suspects Benny has a thing for Dean, which Dean knows isn’t true, but isn’t above exploiting a tiny bit every now and then to spice things up.
Because his boyfriend is the hottest man in the world and Dean can barely help himself around him on a regular day. But when he wears blue and his sky eyes get even more unreal, Dean can barely fucking
While Cas is walking to the en-suite, not doubt to get rid of the condom, Dean is left there, to think about how much he already misses being filled by Cas and how much he’s loved the simple kiss. A kiss that wasn’t meant to lead anywhere. I kiss that said ‘I’m not doing this because I have to, I’m doing it because I like you, because I have been inside of you, and you let me, and I enjoyed it.’
Castiel lets him munch for some time while he kneads Dean’s calves, which makes Dean release little groans of relief, before he speaks again.
Castiel can’t help his evil chuckle. Just like he can’t help watching the last inch of his dick being swallowed by Dean’s stretched hole. He knows he has a mild voyeurism kink, and watching himself being taken by a beautiful ass is probably his favorite thing in the world. Castiel is aware that he’s pretty well endowed, both longer and thicker than average, so he knows that whoever’s able to take all of him like Dean is doing now is more than deserving of a little praise.
As he’s closing his bedroom door, Dean realizes that he can’t recall what the demon woman at the front desk told him yesterday about the location of the breakfast room. ‘Oh well,’ he thinks with a shrug of his shoulders, ‘just go downstairs and follow your nose.’
“I am, Cas, I promise you I am. And if you give me a second chance I totally know my past self doesn’t deserve I swear I’ll spend every day from now on being deserving of it.”
. Dean didn’t realize it at first, because Novak rarely parts from his ill-fitting tan trench coat that totally hides the treasure the court reporter packs underneath. But after the first time Dean saw him remove it, he’s started paying attention and has noticed that the man’s body is
Castiel had left though. And Dean hadn’t stopped him. And was now apologizing for it. And not even shrugging it off. A full out apology. Admitting where he had gone wrong, saying he was sorry. Saying he had forgiven him. But had Castiel forgiven Dean? Better still, could he go back to him, knowing they might never get to where Castiel really wanted them to go? To where Dean, deep down, wanted them to go?
He bends forward and sticks his tongue out so fast he risks making himself dizzy so soon after his first orgasm in days.
When they finally get to Dean’s apartment, Castiel breaths a sigh of relief. He isn’t sure he could have helped himself and not fuck Dean in a semi-public space had the journey lasted much longer.
Dean’s hands tighten on his sides to arrest the motion immediately. “Baby, wait, you’ll hurt yourself!”
Still more focused on whatever it was Cas was reading - even though it looked more like he wanted to set those papers on fire with the mere force of the hatred in his eyes - he took a moment too long to reply in a detached, impatient tone, “It counts in everybody’s case.”
“Hey, it’s no trouble. And it’s not much, anyway. It’s-, um, just a couple of ham sandwiches, some fruit, and a relaxing tisane. That’s, um, something Jess suggested? Says it doesn’t contain I don’t know what that doesn’t have exciting properties like tea, so you can have it before bed and it won’t prevent you from sleeping but it helps you relax?”
“Yes, Sir. I love them,” Dean says before having to pause to release a soft grunt. He definitely loves when Castiel uses the plug to pull his rim down a bit. “So
“And if you aren’t ready yet I’ll totally understand and wait for as long as it takes. But if you are, I’m here ready to start building that path right away too.”
Dean’s there, Kleenex box still in hand, looking at a man who’s looking at him as if he had grown a second, third and fourth head, and each of them was wearing a hat uglier than those worn at a fancy party by the British nobility.
, to show his beautiful boy that kneeling didn’t equal being inferior. That nothing they did together meant one was more important than the other. That Dean taking control and Cas letting him didn’t mean Dean would only think of himself and that Cas’s pleasure was secondary, or a mere side effect. He wanted to show him that he’d always take care of him as he saw fit, because Cas was
decided to pay for the renovations the building where Dean’s apartment is located is in desperate need of. As fantastic as that is, it also meant that Dean had to find another place to stay at for a fortnight. Not being a fan of imposing on his brother, friends, or, worse, of couch surfing for that long, a hotel or a B&B seemed liked the best choice. However, he needed to stay in the area to be close to his workplace and didn’t want to spend too much on a fancy hotel. Money isn’t exactly tight, but it’s not to be wasted either. Plus, fancy isn’t exactly his style. Cozy, homey, simple, welcoming is so much more his scene. So when the time came for him to make his reservation, he just knew the perfect place. The small, well-kept hotel he always passes by when driving to and from work, with a patio and a swing, and the nicely furnished living room he can always see from the open windows.
know is how badly that evening in the locker room fucked him up. He became so insecure in himself and his sexuality that he couldn’t gather the courage to so much as flirt with someone until the end of his freshman year in college. Castiel thinks that’s why Balthazar started the tradition of trying and rope him up in his orgies. Because his friend knew he was lonely. He was the only one Castiel had told about that evening. The only one he had to dissuade from beating Dean to a pulp. If Balthazar could see him now, he’d probably beat
Hence, planning a scene that ticks off most of the kinks in the ‘Yes’ column of their contract that they have in common could only result in incontrovertible perfection. Dean, the perfect sub to Castiel’s Dom, due to his need to please and being taken care of, which perfectly balances Castiel’s need to be pleased with blind obedience while also caring for his sub, always gives his best, beyond his best, in scenes like this, even though he’s absolutely perfect even during those scenes were kinks are explored that Castiel favors more than he does.
, until they were both naked and had finally reached the foot of the bed. Cas dropped to his knees and swallowed Dean down right away, without him having to do or say anything. Apparently his good boy was as hungry for Dean’s cock as Dean was for Cas’s ass.
With that – and another swat to Dean’s ass that absolutely does not make his toes curl in anticipation of how possessive Cas will be in bed tonight – he’s gone, leaving Dean with a smile he couldn’t wipe away for all the money in the world.
He can’t fuck Dean tonight though, can he? Bend him over the dinner table and drive his cock into his ass as hard as he can? Too soon, right?
‘Right, so keep your cool, Winchester. Just go out there, have a coffee while your boyfriend has his posh afternoon tea, then drag him home and do wicked things to him.’ Nodding to himself in the mirror is probably a new low in Dean’s life, but his mental pep talk actually helped and he feels like he can leave the restroom and go back to their table without being tempted to take a detour to the kitchen and strangle the kid on his way back to Cas.
. Where you make plans and text and call and date and talk and dirty talk and sweet talk and are...boyfriends. That’s what they are, aren’t they? Castiel And Dean are boyfriends. He should probably talk to Cas about it, and it’s not like labeling what they have is a priority right now, but that’s basically what they are.
‘Grandpa proposed to Grandad while he was buried balls deep inside of his ass in the backseat of his car’ is
He tries to tell himself that at least he now knows what he feels like to date Castiel Novak. Even though it’s clear it was never real for Cas, it still was for him. He’s dated Cas for a few blissful weeks. Dean now knows what it means to be flirted with by Castiel Novak. To spend hours texting with him and talking about everything and nothing and find Cas’s use of proper grammar in texts adorable. To share his thoughts about one of the most challenging experiences of Dean’s life, his moving to New York, with him and having him listen and offer suggestions and words of support. To see Cas smile and look at Dean as if no one else exists. To kiss and by kissed by Castiel Novak. To make love with Castiel Novak – because that’s what last night was to Dean – while his forget-me-not blues never leave Dean, not even for a second. To tell him about himself and learn about Cas in return, like when he told him about his grandma. Dean feels so
He spent the first leg of the journey with his thoughts, or just generally enjoying the view. After a while though, the silence and the open roads started to seem endless, so he decided to pull over first chance he got, take a break, and then go back behind the wheel.
the meal is part of a date with someone who’s been on your mind for over a decade, apparently. Sometimes Castiel still has trouble believing that part. Dean thinking about him for fifteen years. Castiel spent a considerable amount of time over the last months of his senior year in high school and his freshman year in college thinking about Dean. And he’d lie if he said they were all bad thoughts. Sometimes he couldn’t help replaying a compilation of Dean’s smiles in his head, for example. But he would never dwell on those thoughts for too long, the angst linked to the locker room incident strong enough to chase away the good memories. But he slowly stopped thinking about him every day. Until he managed to go years without so much as remembering Dean even existed or that they had ever crossed paths. All the while Dean had been thinking about him constantly instead. How had the tables turned.
It’s clear Cas can’t see what any of this has to do with any good news Dean might want to share with him. There’s not even a trace of hope on his face. He’s not even considering the possibility Dean might have put in a good word for him. So much for taking advantage of Dean.
Dean hasn’t broken eye contact for even a moment, clearly trying to understand if Castiel is serious, wanting to chat while buried balls deep in his ass.
Dean would be a lying liar who lies if he said he’s not also having sexy thoughts about what the two of them could do above that very spacious desk. Or under it, or against it.
tonight, sweet baby Jesus. He always does, but he must have used a cologne he uses for special occasions and Dean must confess, Cas knows his way around this shit because Dean’s feeling
And he decided to open it in this neighborhood because it was an area of town they were trying to reclaim, where violence and crime had been spiking and involving teens more and more consistently. Realizing that investing in the area was the best solution to both deal with the increasing crime rate and the involvement of young people in illegal practices, the town hall started infusing money and resources in a redevelopment plan and inviting the opening of new businesses. It seemed like fate was calling Castiel’s name. He wanted to open his hotel to create a safe space for himself, his family and for others, so contributing to help a whole neighborhood in the process was the proverbial cherry on the cake.
Truth be told, Dean’s been thinking about it for some time now, ever since Meg quit unexpectedly and left them to fend for themselves. He’s thought about suggesting it to Cas a couple of times before, but he was afraid of overstepping way more than their still young friendship could survive to.
Even acting unhurried and disinterested as he is now, the muscles in Dean’s calves and thighs are tense from him wearing heels, and his perfect little bottom looks rounder as a result of the shoes too. When he grabs the chair to move it, the muscles in his biceps bulge as well, and Castiel’s cock gives a happy twitch. All that perfect flesh showcased just for him to lust on, Castiel muses while he takes another sip of his liquor, and he gets to fuck every. inch. of. it. however he pleases. What a lucky man.
“I don’t know. I mean, we’d just met that morning and there I was, texting you a picture of me exploring the city. I-,” Dean sighs and then clearly decides to say what he was about to say. “I debated sending it. I didn’t want to come across as suffocating. But the truth is, you were the first person I wanted to share those experiences with. Not my friends or family, not even my brother. You.”
Dean’s heart feels so full hearing those words leave Cas’s mouth, the ‘right’, ‘right’, ‘right’ feeling an explosion of fireworks behind his ribcage. Cas trust him
That was all the confirmation Dean needed to place the lube on the floor next to his right knee, handy for when he would need it, and lean over Cas to start kissing him.
“Shh, baby, no, don’t worry,” Dean cooed as he made his hands leave the grip they had on Cas’s hips to start caressing his belly and chest. “You’ll have it for as long as you want it.”
for Castiel. He wanted to save him for himself too. Not only to prevent Castiel from being stuck in Purgatory alone. But also to avoid Dean being stuck on Earth without Castiel.
Dean’s dick explodes no later than five seconds after the words have left Castiel’s mouth and the sound he makes is almost pained. It’s a sound Castiel knows well, and that makes satisfaction and pride and love and awe spread through his chest. It’s the sound Dean makes when he comes so hard the pleasure is almost too much and borders on pain. That knowledge combined with the clenching of Dean’s inner muscles against Castiel’s cock is pure bliss and Castiel starts coming before he even realizes that’s what’s happening.
The scene isn’t one of those Cas and Dean have designed together. They’ve been mates for long enough that that only ever happens anymore when they mean to try something for the first time – and there are
“I will!” Jack replies with a big smile that makes his dimples appear. “Mister N even insisted I had a double portion of bacon and fruit for breakfast this morning. He says that’s brain food, so I needed it even more today.”
The shock on Cas’s face when he heard his request lasted a moment, before he huffed a disbelieving huff and told him to stay right where he was before going for his jacket, turning around and wearing it, one sleeve at a time, without ever breaking eye contact with Dean. He then started walking back to him, slowly, deliberately, and Dean could very clearly see in his mind’s eye what a picture he was painting for his boyfriend right now. On his knees, more than half hard in his jeans, his lips slightly parted, his eyes fixed on the jacket, every one of his muscles tensed, eagerness written all over his face. Dean was
“Yes?” Castiel replies with a head tilt+confused squint combo that has Dean’s insides squirm pleasurably at the thought that someone so unmistakably handsome can also be this adorable.
He has to take a leap of faith. He might be wrong, he’s still not convinced he isn’t. And that might lead to heartbreak, so much worse than the one he went through as a kid. But it’s not Dean the one who has to give him back that missing piece of his soul. It’s Castiel. Castiel needs to look for it. To do that, he needs to let someone in and let that someone show him, in time, that yes, people can be shitty and they can make mistakes and be awful and say and do bad things, but they can also be good and loving and trusting and accountable and supportive and everything you want them and need them to be. It just so happens that the person Castiel wants to let in is the same person that kickstarted this quest for the missing piece of his faith in humanity in the first place. But if
‘Shall we?’. His favorite sentence. Jesus Christ, Dean loves this man with all he is and all he has.
As usual, thank you so much, a big hug and endless cookies to every beautiful soul who showed loved for the fic and me in any way, big or small, so far. Y'all amazing :-*
A hand shoots to get a hold of Dean’s chin and turn his face to look at Cas in one second flat. “I haven’t prepped you in days, Dean. Doing it sloppily and push my cock inside would hurt you. And I will
Cas’s groan goes straight to Dean’s cock, and Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been this hard in his life, and he‘d have never thought he’d come in his pants ever again, not since becoming an adult, but that’s what’s about to happen because he’s close, so close, and he’s moaning like a slut, and urging Cas on, begging him not to stop, and the friction of Cas’s cock against his own through their jeans shouldn’t be glorious but totally is, and Cas’s hands are keeping him in place just where they want him and they’re so
“Would you do me the honor of being my date at the reunion? I can’t wait to see the look of my classmates’ faces when they realize I only have eyes for you, and I tell them that’s nothing new, because it was like that in high school too.”
Knowing how on edge Cas was about the whole thing, Dean made sure to show him off just like he deserved, making everyone, Cas first and foremost, see how lucky Dean felt that Castiel Fucking Novak was his plus one. Dean was absolutely delighted – and, judging by his smug smile, Cas was too – when he saw the shock and sheer jealousy on the cheerleaders’ faces when Dean proudly introduced Cas as “his date, who I was already hot for when we were still studying here.” Rhonda Hurley was the one who took the news less favorably of all, and it didn’t take a genius to understand that she was hoping she and Dean could have a quick roll in hay for old times sake’s. Cas, of course, failed to notice least of all, and interrogated Dean about it at the end of the night until Dean confessed she had been one of the girls he’d gone all the way with, as they had been together for almost fours months at the beginning of his junior year. Dean ended up admitting that she had even made him wear a pink and satiny pair of her panties once and he had liked it. The confession was initially followed by a few jokes about how deep in denial Dean was back then if not even
“Come closer, my darling boy,” Castiel orders, and then thoroughly enjoys the cat-like motion of his precious sub, who walks on high heels as if he was born wearing them.
Dean – slowly, deliberately, to give Cas all the time he might need to process that yes, the atmosphere has changed and the electricity he’s feeling in the air is not because of his imagination running wild – bends slightly to put his guitar back in its open case lying on the floor next to his feet. He then turns around on the couch, angling his body towards Cas, an arm extended on the backrest, a leg bent at the knee resting on the cushion, his body language open, inviting.
“I, um, got busy with laundry and dinner, so I haven’t had the time to set the table. Can I ask you to help me with that while I finish here?”
Apparently, the nutritious meal, the pleasant conversation, the comfortable couch and the warm blankets had done the rest.
Because on top of him is his beautiful boyfriend, who Dean has taken care of and made come like he wanted, who’s smiling against his neck as he waits for Dean to get his breathing – and heartbeat – back to normal, who’s ambushed him to be fucked savagely in his car, because he’s a kinky fucker and because they need to make the mos-
, Sam. People get close to me they get killed... or worse. You know, I tell myself that I help more people than I hurt, and I tell myself that I am doing it all for the right reasons and I believe that. But I can’t, I won’t, drag anybody to the mud with me, not anymore.”
And Cas does. Boy, he does. When he gets like that, Cas fucks Dean’s mouth and ass, sometimes both, without holding back. Dean feels his jaw and ass ache for days after, and he loves it. He loves the building up to it, the anticipation, the dance they do around each other when they know, they
to know. Cas isn’t into flings, he’s into committed relationships. Exactly what Dean was hoping to find out. It’s getting harder and harder not to get overexcited and hopeful.
Dean gasps. He knows what Cas is doing. He’s always liked it a bit rough, but it’s no coincidence he’s opted for that choice of words. He knows Dean needs reassurance, and he seems to need it just as badly, and he needs for the both of them to be reminded that no one owns Cas but Dean, and no one owns Dean but Cas. They chose each other years ago and they keep choosing each other, every day.
“I didn’t have friends, I had colleagues, and they slammed the door in my face when I was fired. And my family...they live in another state, and my parents don’t want to have anything to do with me because I’m gay. I was terrified enough that I didn’t come out to them until a couple of years after finishing college, so they did pay for my education and I don’t have student loans to deal with on top of everything else, luckily. But, both of them and all our family friends literally shunned me after I refused to “repent for my sins and renounce my devilish inclinations”. As if I could just turn off the gay.”
Novak takes a moment to even register Dean’s spoken, he’s so stupid with lust he’s confused and unresponsive, so that when he finally processes Dean’s words his ‘you want me to do anything but this right now and how can you even talk and think ahead’ expression is both adorable and extremely arousing. Dean feels so smug he can’t help but behave like a little dominant shit.
When they’re done with dinner, Castiel insists on helping Dean clean before going back home. Dean switches on his stereo, claiming that he absolutely hates cleaning and he can only bring himself to do it if he can have a reward. Dean talking about a duty-reward dynamic does not send Castiel’s mind to the gutter. Uh uh.
A warm feeling courses through Castiel’s entire body. He’s providing for his guests like he’s always wanted to, creating a welcoming and pleasant space for them. Even better, he’s providing for
They don’t do this often enough. Sure, they’re sickeningly in love and all their friends love to make fun of them for it, while not so secretly wishing they could find something similar for themselves even knowing that the kind of chemistry, unconditional trust and love Dean and Cas share isn’t that easily found. They aren’t afraid to be very affectionate with each other, constantly hugging each other while they cook, or lounge on the couch at the end of a long working day, playing with each other’s hair, rubbing each other’s back and arms soothingly. When Dean and Cas are in the same room, they’re likely to be touching somehow. So Cas can’t say they don’t cuddle. They do. And sometimes they even manage to make love sweetly, slowly, without falling into the spiral or hunger and desperation that has always characterized their sex life. That uncontrollable need to be inside each other that gets the better of them more often than not and leads them to fuck passionately, roughly, like two lost lovers who haven’t had a chance to be with each other for a decade rather than the boyfriends, who share a house and wake up next to each other every morning, that they are.

Similarly, betas are raised to become pros at suffering from borderline personality syndrome. If they end up with an alpha, they irrevocably feel the need to behave like bitches who could rival porn stars for their sluttiness, since they have tough competition from omegas, who are naturals at being sluts in bed and can even self-lubricate, which spares alphas a lot of time and trouble with prep. On the contrary, if they start a relationship with an omega, they end up acting like the most aggressive, competitive and possessive of alphas, as they need to overcompensate the fact that they don’t, in fact, have a knot and there are a lot of alphas out there ready and willing to mount and knot their omegas if need be. Either way, they are always considered – and always consider themselves – a black and white copy of the colorful original. Almost an omega or an alpha, but not quite. Many of them end up in beta/beta relationships just to avoid the constant feeling of not being up to the task. It doesn’t mean that most betas do not still suffer from a more or less severe case of imposter syndrome. They most certainly do.
What attracts his attention right away, however, is a braided chest at the foot of the bed with a handwritten note on top of it stating
Dean’s facial expression changes for a moment, but it’s too fast for Castiel to interpret. Maybe he thinks Castiel’s an idiot for still thinking about others in his situation. Hell, sometimes Castiel himself thinks so. But that’s how he is, and, quite frankly, holding on to the last shreds of what used to make him
“Ever since Meg quit her job at the front office we’ve got swamped and swamped, wouldn’t you agree?”
As soon as he turns around on wobbly legs, Cas’s right hand goes to pull down the front of his panties. His left one is still on the wall next to Dean’s head, probably for support, but effectively caging Dean in, which he simply loves because it feels like Cas is shielding him from the rest of the world and he feels safe and protected like he only ever does with his amazing boyfriend.
“We can,” Dean concedes, and his mind is already filling with images of Cas fucking him from behind.
happy,” he starts, looking at Cas straight in the eye. “In fact, I have a very personal interest in you liking me,” Dean concludes, his tone suggestive and his gaze doing nothing to hide the eruption of raw desire which is racking his body.
outfit showing off the incredibly tempting body that was underneath. But now Dean’s put on the green sweater he’s brought along in case the air got chillier, which it did, and Castiel is being blinded by how much that damn sweater brings out his green eyes. As if he wasn’t already obsessed with Dean’s face as it is.
, Cas is gonna do despicable – awesome, hot, smutty, delicious – things to Dean. He loves the act in itself, the unrestrained drive they have to get as close to each other as possible with their bodies and souls. And he loves the aftermath, all of the little physical reminders of how completely he’s loved, and wanted, and cherished, and owned.
He takes the two steps that separate them and puts his hands on each side of Dean’s face, pulling him towards himself not too aggressively, but not too gently either. Dean’s stunned for a couple of seconds, his hands up in the air by their side and his lips unmoving. It doesn’t escape Castiel’s notice that this is their first kiss. Something they could have shared fifteen years ago, but are sharing now for the first time instead. That could be what’s shocking Dean so much. Or the fact that he really didn’t expect Castiel to kiss him tonight. Castiel didn’t expect Castiel to kiss Dean tonight either.
Castiel takes a critical look at the space around him and determines that, from the couch, he wouldn’t have a chance to really observe Dean while he makes dinner. It’s an open space, and he could see a lot, but not
Castiel chuckles. Trust his boy to see right through him. “Yes, I suppose it was predictable I wouldn’t resist,” he concedes. “What else?”
When he finally can go attend to Dean without feeling guilty about abandoning his other guests to do so, Castiel is welcome by his radiant smile. His knees go a little weak all of a sudden.
The first mistake was not realizing for so long that he was in love with the hunter. Not even when the evidence was right there, from the start.
It was at the end of one of these sessions that Cas had to lend Dean a T-shirt to go back to the dorm for the first time and kept the one Dean had been wearing to clean it. Dean was still to get his T-shirt back, and was obviously keeping Cas’s for ransom.
The swat on his ass he expected. The not so gentle nibble to his earlobe he didn’t though. And those hands sliding possessively around his waist to press him against a now very solid chest are making it difficult to focus on the words being whispered in his ear.
Dean has a moment to think that he’s being crazy and seeing things that aren’t really there, but no, that is definitely his blanket. Quite unlikely there could be another one in the world, considering
The rough treatment isn’t turning Dean off though. If anything, it’s turning him on even more and he groans and moans and whines and says “yes”, “fuck”, “God” more than he normally would in a whole month. That’s probably because he knows he deserves to be treated as a whore, because that’s how he’s behaved. He’s been a whore for weeks, trying to get Cas to snap, all because he’s fucking unable to
“I’d love to be the judge of that,” Dean had taunted, because Gorgeous – Castiel – was making his sluttiness levels reach new heights and all he wanted was to feel this man’s
Sammy says his jokes are the most obvious of his self-deprecation mechanisms. Now that he suddenly feels nervous at the thought Jimmy might not like what he cooked, Dean is almost inclined to think his brother might be right. Sammy also says Dean’s self-deprecation is often unwarranted. Dean can only hope his brother’s right about that too.
Placing a knee on the mattress, he bends over until one on his hands makes contact with the pillow and the other reaches for Dean’s face, so he can press his lips, again soft and lingering, on Dean’s.
They kiss, and kiss, and kiss, naked and pressed against each other, holding one another close, so, so close, and their cocks constantly brush against their bellies or each other and it’s deliciously teasing.
These past five days, for example, Cas’s been in full mother hen mode. Having Dean drink honeyed tea and eat fruit, cooking him his delicious broth, forcing him to take his vitamins, and making sure they were tucked in bed by nine, warm and safe, ready to watch one of Dean’s favorite movies, every night. It was clear that his protective instincts were going a mile a minute, because Cas kept calling him all sorts of lame nicknames, which he always does when he feels Dean needs even more care than usual. And the weird thing is, they are all food related. Muffin, cupcake, honey, cinnamon roll, sweetie pie... Maybe Cas has a food kink they should explore? Do blue foods exist? They should definitely look into it.
He grabs hold of Dean’s hips and starts pushing him back against his dick, and is enraptured by the glorious sight of how much of him Dean’s little hole can take, of how his fully thick cock is swallowed by Dean’s ass like that’s all that ass was made to do.
“I mean that I don’t believe in the fact that there are general rules about being a good boyfriend. Every person is different, what is great for someone would make someone else cringe. So... let’s talk about what are the guidelines to be a good boyfriend to
there, between him and Dean. Something that could be significant, even long term, regardless of how afraid Castiel is of getting his hopes up too high and see them crushed and burned when Dean inevitably leaves his hotel. He cannot help but
“No, Dean,” Castiel replies with a particularly gravelly voice and a suggestive tone, “I really don’t think it will be.”
is not true, so now I don’t know what to do, I have been going through all my files and the schedule for my next deliveries, plus the list of suppliers in this area and their prices and delivery times, but it seems like I either give in and take the abuse, or I refuse to pay and give back the products I don’t wanna pay so much for, but this way I’d run out of stuff in the next two, maybe three, days and will no longer be able to offer half of the things on the menu and two days aren’t enough to find another trustworthy supplier that I know will not charge me too much for poor quality products, and-“
Dean took half a step back, his arms still around Castiel’s shoulders, Castiel’s arms still around Dean’s waist. The hunter seemed almost… disappointed? Like he had to visibly force himself not to say more? Could it be that...?
Cas’s face passes from concern to shock to relief to softness in a matter of seconds. One of his hands goes to cup the side of Dean’s face, cradling it as if it was something precious, touching it as reverently as one would touch the finest Venetian glass. His eyes bore into Dean’s, so intense they’re almost glowing, and his smile is indulgent, as if he can’t believe the words that just left Dean’s mouth.
“Gabe, nice seeing you,” Dean replies, trying to sound actually interested in catching up with him and probably failing to hit the mark by approximately 75 miles.
Dean’s face freezes in surprise, eyes and mouth wide open, for a second, before he springs into action, grabbing Castiel by the wrist and dragging him along, almost tripping on his own feet a couple of times in his haste. He’s probably afraid Castiel will change his mind if Dean allows him to have enough time to think about what they’re doing rationally. Castiel feels a tug in his heart when he realizes that. When he realizes that Dean must want to have this hard enough that he’s ready to give himself completely even knowing that Castiel might change his mind either now, or tomorrow.
Dean’s never chuckled so much in his life like he has ever since he and Cas adopted the twins. “Yes, Cat, Uncle Balthy.”
Cas didn’t even blink and sounded mighty bored when he replied “You don’t have a usual, the number of espresso shots changes based on how tired you are, so I’ll be thanking you for telling me how many you need today. And we ran out of soy milk, my apologies.”
Either this is sending Cas’s ego on a premium cruise to Jupiter or he’s really the better person, because he doesn’t comment on it but suggests “Shall we?” with a slightly indulgent smile. Again, Dean nods and follows Cas. Dean has a déjà vu to the night at the conference, when he followed Cas to the bar full of hope and trepidation. Dean likes following Cas a lot. And that has nothing to do with how awesome the man’s butt is. Well, OK, that’s part of the reason, but it’s not the
“Of course I will!” Dean’s scandalized expression, as if the very thought of never speaking with Castiel again is ludicrous, is
They stared into each other’s eyes. It was unhurried. They were truly realizing they had all the time in the world now. And simply got lost in the reassurance that what each of them felt could be seen reflected in the other’s eyes.
For a brief moment he even had the fleeting thought that the man looked like the driver of the sexy black car, but he dismissed it immediately. Someone who looked like
At the beginning of November, Cas did accompany Dean to his 15 year high school renioun as his plus one. It was frankly one of the best nights of Dean’s life.
Cas drops his gaze and he knows, he feels, that his cheeks are in flames. It’s not even an act. He feels exposed and vulnerable and he loves that Dean is taking care of that rather taking advantage of it. He can trust Dean always. Always.
Cas’s eyes start filling again. “I don’t,” the poor man needs to clear his throat twice before speaking, and he’s still choked up when he says “I don’t have to sleep on the street tomorrow?”
But when his mom sends them on their way with the usual two day worth of leftovers in the usual Tupperware container, Dean breathes a sigh of relief.
. He’s done with breakfast anyway, and what he knows will be the hardest part of his day is next: the shower. He’s got a bit of a fixation for masturbation in the shower in the morning, and apparently Cas is a fan of morning sex in the shower too. The more they talk, the more it becomes clear how very compatible they are, and that’s simply awesome. Dean knows his future holds a lot of mornings spent on his knees now, and he can’t wait for that future to become present. Aaaand, stopping that thought right there too, dammit.
Dean’s loved every second of it, even though dealing with his cold sucked and he’s a giant baby when he’s sick. But he’s felt so taken care of, so cherished, so safe, he wouldn’t have changed a single thing. Not even the freaking cold.
“Hello, my precious baby boy,” Castiel greets, once he and Dean are face to face, before leaning in and pressing his lips to his sub’s, while his arms sneak around his back so he can hold him close. Castiel spends some time just kissing Dean’s lips and holding him against his body, until he feels his boy go completely lax in his arms.
“It’s absolutely perfect, love,” Cas says, fondness and love in his voice, and the sudden absence of his left arm around Dean makes Dean assume that Cas is probably admiring the ring around his finger.
“So, I know we kinda did everything backwards. Living together before getting together and all. And I totally understand if you feel like you need your independence and to find a place to stay. But, um, I mean, you could stay here. You know? Just, instead of being friends who share a place, we’d been boyfriends who live together. Unless you don’t think it’s too soo-“
Ten past two. He’s got one hour and twenty minutes. Start unpacking and taking a quick shower it is then, Dean thinks as he gets up from the couch and heads for the box of toiletries to start the process of doing just that.
At first, Castiel hadn’t been sure that was a good idea. New Mexico wasn’t exactly far away from Kansas. But he decided to give it a try in the end. San Mateo wasn’t close to the border either and, as isolated and tiny as it was, it wasn’t a place the Winchesters might end up in by accident. Castiel had only to hope that nothing supernatural would attract their attention. Or that he could find out about it and deal with it himself, before they had any reason to get involved. Plus, he liked the name of the place. Saint Matthew was what Dean, and Àngel too, would have defined as a “cool dude”. It was comforting to go to a place named after him. So the following day he told Àngel he had thought about it and he’d be grateful if he could call his friend. He then added, with a twisting feeling in his stomach that the angel suspected was shame, that he’d also be grateful if he could tell his friend that his name was Jimmy, not Castiel. Once again, the cook narrowed his eyes for a few moments and seemed to think it through, before replying “Sure thing, Jimmy.” Àngel
hands, hyper focused on each little thing Cas is doing like he seems to be. It’s so empowering to be the center of the attention of a man like Dean.
The common phrase signaling the entrance of the judge pulls Dean out of his naughty train of thought and into the very important present circumstances. He has a just cause to fight for. And fight for it he shall.
The second question Castiel’s ever asked him, and he chooses to go with the one question that could make it or break it.
Considering Cas’s past experience and what they themselves had done the last time they’d been together, Dean wanted,
is Novak’s voice? That low, gravelly timbre is how his voice sounds? Dean can’t wait to hear the man scream himself hoarse when Dean fucks him, the sound is gonna be divine.
Dean loves taking his Dom’s dick in his mouth. The feel, taste and smell of him are absolutely heady. The musky smell of Cas’s cock combines with the sweet honey smell of his slick and it adds to the feel of Cas’s hands on top of Dean’s head and at the back of his neck, of the taste of Cas’s bitter pre-cum and the velvety feel of his cock’s skin on his tongue. Cas’s heated gaze and that deep voice made for sex talking dirty to him only fuel the fire, until all Dean can feel is a delicious onslaught of sensations that envelops him completely and makes him feel like Cas is everywhere – inside of him, around him, above him.
Dean’s smiling. But it’s not cocky, or flirty. It’s tight lipped and uncomfortable. Castiel doesn’t have time to process that though. While his eyes are busy assessing the interaction between Dean and the flirty waiter, his hand feels warmer all of a sudden. He looks down to see Dean’s hand covering his. He’s about to tell him off when he hears him say, “Could you please get us some tap water while my date and I take a look at the menu?” A smile follows his request, but it is polite and detached and, just like his hand on top of Castiel’s, leaves no room for misunderstanding.
Once Dean’s placed the pillow on the floor like Castiel instructed, he fixes big, hopeful eyes on his Dom before remembering himself and dropping his gaze. Castiel will not punish him. Not tonight. Not when all those beautiful, green eyes were saying is “Please, please let me kneel on it.”
A hand yanking his head back by his hair and a simple command to “Open and always keep your eyes on me” was all the indication Dean had that their scene had started, before his Dom’s cock was thrust, none too gently, into his mouth. Dean had already been floating by then, the very act of kneeling on his blue pillow (“I can’t stand the idea of you hurting, unless it’s pain I’m deliberately inflicting, My Heart, so we’ll always use this to protect your knees”) more than enough for him to let the rest of the world disappear in the recess of his mind and start living in a place and time where only his perfect Dom and Dean himself exist.
Very, very far. “I’m glad you think so,” he replies, still as subservient as he’ll ever be. He can’t see it, stubbornly focused as he is on Dean’s feet, but he can very well image the ‘What kind of game is my boyfriend playing?’ look on Dean’s face right now. His lips pressed in a thin line, before he releases them in a pucker, his knitted brow. His vain attempt to be rational and in control enough to analyze the situation objectively. That won’t last. It never does when Cas gets his hands on Dean, or Dean on Cas. The thought makes Cas almost dizzy. They give so much, mean so much, to each other. It scares him and makes him feel blessed at the same time. And Cas wants it to be like that always. Always.
By day four he’d started to feel a hitch that needed scratching though. As loved as the TLC was making him feel, he was starting to feel much better and he needed to fuck or get fucked. When he told Cas, his boyfriend replied that he’d have felt better if they could wait one more day, give Dean’s body some more time to recover completely, and reminded him they had his colleague’s party the following day and could have their own private date night at home once back from that.
The moan that leaves Dean’s glorious lips and the long, delectable expanse of his throat as a result of his throwing his head back make Cas understand Dean’s not about to complain.
They take the metro back to Castiel’s place and chat a bit now and then, but never about anything too deep, and spend a long time in comfortable silence or people watching. Dean is clearly coming to terms with the incredible variety of human specimens New York has to offer, of which the metro is a pretty accurate summary. Castiel is busy
He then looks at Samandriel, as if he’s just realized his presence, and asks “Hey there, kid. Mind bringing my fiancé his fancy afternoon tea – you know which one, god knows you’ve spent enough time memorizing anything you could about him – and a black coffee for me?” Smiling smugly, he adds “Ten bucks tip if you make it quick,” and stage whispers “Cas promised I’d get laid as soon as we got home, so.”
Dean can only do as asked. He smiles brilliantly at Cas, trying to convey how happy his reply has made him and pours all his happiness and talent into playing his go-to songs, which, he knows, will tell Cas more about the kind of man Dean is at heart that anything else could.
“Because even after you told me, I kept finding the whole thing laughable!” Cas screams, getting in Dean’s face and clutching the lapels of his jacket between his closed fists. “He could almost be our child and I thought you
“You don’t have to accept, if you don’t want to,” Dean hastens to add. Cas needs to understand this is not a condition for them to stay friends. He’s not gonna be like every other person in Cas’s life, who’s only stayed as long as Cas respected the conditions they had set up. No. Dean’s offered Cas unconditional friendship. And he’s gonna take Cas in whatever shape and form he comes along.
, a warm feeling of accomplishment spreading through him at the praise. He's good enough that Cas is fucking him like it's his life mission and is about to shoot his load inside him, and Dean’s never hated condoms more than he does now.
“No problem. Go ahead. I’ll start dinner and then take care of laundry. Take your time, okay? Shampoo and body wash are in the shower, and your sponge is the blue one. The green one’s mine. Enjoy the long, warm, relaxing shower I promised.”
“I’m close, baby. Your mouth was so good already, and your ass is perfect. So warm, so so welcoming, always ready for me. I-, ah, I can’t wait to get inside of you again.”
Castiel takes his time. They do have all the time in the world, so why rush things, when he has a marvelous sub all to himself ready to do whatever it is he wants of him? He kisses Dean’s lips thoroughly, tilting his head left and right, making sure to pay the same attention to both his upper and lower lip. He kisses the corners of Dean’s mouth too, for good measure. None of them is keeping their eyes closed. Dean’s lips pucker up every now and then in response to the pressure of Castiel’s, but he’s just sitting with his hands on his own lap and his eyes locked with his Dom’s. They don’t close even when Castiel’s tongue brushes lightly against Dean’s lower lip, and he dutifully opens up. Castiel will never have enough of his sub abiding by any request he makes, even those which are not spoken. At first, Castiel only lets the tip of his tongue slide against the tip of Dean’s, slowly. They have time, after all. He spends long moments alternating between licking Dean’s lips and meeting his tongue for a brief second before starting all over again. It’s only when he can no longer control himself and he sneaks all of his tongue into his mouth and tangles it with Dean’s in a full make-out session that Dean’s eyes close and he sags in relief. Dean loves being kissed passionately. Once they spent almost one hour doing nothing but kissing and it had been divine.
Dean has also started calling him ‘Cas’ more and more often, especially when he’s particularly relaxed, like when he sends his goodnight text, which he’s never failed to send since the day at Sarabeth’s. Castiel has been letting it slide every time without ever correcting him like he had done at the conference. It’s like an unspoken sign that Castiel is slowly acknowledging that things between them are shifting and he’s no longer that interested in keeping a safe distance between them. He’s starting to think he doesn’t
That’s something Dean had never really considered a priority, too much of his time and energies devoted to taking care of Sammy, working, making music and remembering to eat at least twice a day, sleep at least four hours a night and shower at least once a day to really consider a romantic relationship. He didn’t really see the point when all his sexual urges could be taken care of with a night at a bar every once in a while. Lately though... it’s not sex he wants. Well, not
That’s how he learns that Cas’s favorite course in college was actually an elective one, an English literature course on pathetic fallacy in poetry, which only solidified his decision to apply himself to the study of green economy.
Until the silence is broken by Dean’s chuckling. “I can’t believe I came this quickly with how much I have been jerking off in the shower lately.”
Next chapter up on Tuesday. These two morons will FINALLY do something about all that pining and UST :-D
Silencing him by thrusting his cock back a little and then pushing it forward inside the tight, warm, delicious channel of Dean’s ass is a little (‘A
. Especially his students. Or he wouldn’t “constantly raise the bar” and demand they complete “increasingly more articulated projects” within impossible deadlines. That simply wasn’t humanly possible. Truth be told, Dean had always suspected the professor was a demon in disguise, and this last
“So, here’s your dinner - burger, fries and water. The hot tea, there’s sugar in the bag too. And, uhm, I also got you these. I-. I couldn’t help but hearing you cough earlier. Figured you must be dealing with a cold and this stuff might help.”
Cas just needs the little something that will push him over the edge. For all Dean knows, he might be the kind of person who loves that, walking on the brink for as long as he can, prolonging his pleasure with denial and anticipation. And Dean will find out if that's the case, if Cas lets him. But right now Dean needs him to come. He needs Cas to let go and he needs to know that's because of
When Dean’s eyes land on Cas, he’s hit all over again by how beautiful he is and how much he feels for this man.
‘His life?’ Castiel thinks, ‘Probably not. But his ass? If he really turns out to be this decent a human being?
If Dean had any hope of not letting his tears fall again, that sentence makes it evaporate. He starts crying and sobbing again, but Cas doesn’t stop. He actually goes back to kissing Dean and holds him, and when Dean calms down a bit, he starts working on his pants to remove them and just goes back to lying on top of Dean right away once he’s naked too.
He fell asleep then, even though he had no intention to. The months spent living in the street have changed his sleeping habits dramatically, for obvious reasons. Deep sleep is a thing of the past. He only allows himself to fall into a relatively deep sleep once a week or so – and always when he finds a bed at the shelter – clutching his measly belongings to himself. The rest of time he slumbers, and he’s always ready to wake up at the first sign of someone or something approaching. And Dean really seems to be a decent person, more than, in fact, but if the street has taught Castiel anything, it is that trust is the most precious of gifts, and shouldn’t be distributed lightly. So when Dean bid him goodnight after helping him turn the couch into a bed and headed for his bedroom, Castiel had lied down with the intention of making the most of this break from the unforgiving winter cold and the hard surface of the sidewalk, but without falling asleep. Not that that would have been an easy thing to do regardless, with all the thoughts clouding his mind. Winter had just started, how he was going to survive until spring Castiel frankly had no idea. The stuff Dean had given him and that would save his ass for some time would only help so much as winter got colder. So Castiel wasn’t really worried he’d fall asleep. Resting would have to be enough anyway. He was in an unknown house with a man he barely knew. A man who was bigger than him. And, considering how scarce food is when you’re homeless, was certainly stronger too. Castiel has been propositioned more than once ever since he ended up on the street, and been looked at as meat more often than he cares to remember, but he has managed to avoid being sexually assaulted so far. And he wants to keep it like that for as long as possible.
When Cas’s hand starts stroking him just how he likes it and his mouth swipes along his lips demanding entrance, Dean loses any ability to think. His hands go to Cas’s shoulders and his fingers start gripping him tightly. His hips start a rocking motion following the lead of Cas’s hand. His mouth lets Cas’s lips and tongue dominate it. His eyes remain closed in bliss.
Just like Dean knows what Cas needs, Cas knows just as much about him. That’s why he moves his mouth closer to Dean’s ear and licks his earlobe before whispering “C’mon, love, come in me.
. Dean simply loves sucking Cas off. And it's even better when he gets to take him in all soft and get him harder and harder until he's fucking warm, and throbbing, and Dean starts chocking on it because his boyfriend’s cock is
Before going back to his ass eating duties, Dean stopped briefly by the bedside table where they kept lube and condoms. There was no time to hover over the fact Dean had just thought about it as the place
Their position changes more than once – first Cas’s legs are around Dean’s hips, then Dean folds Cas almost in half, then he sit on his heels and pulls the lower part of Cas’s body over his tights while he grips Cas hips tightly – as does the rhythm of their fucking – slow, fast, hard, deep, slow again – but they stay face to face the whole time, Cas on his back, Dean before him, above him, on top of him.
Jimmy’s bashful smile is truly a little gem. Dean needs to get a fucking grip on his errant thoughts.
It’s the endearment that does Dean in. And the concern that Cas might have hurt Dean when, in reality, it’s Dean the one who’s been hurting both himself and Cas for fucking months, however unwillingly.
down there, bobbing his head up and down along his shaft, using his right hand to stimulate his balls, while his left, where a matching engagement ring is shining, is gripping Dean’s left side tightly, and swirling his tongue around the head of Dean’s dick only to sink down as far as he can go because he doesn’t have a gag reflex.
Totally speechless in response to the omega’s blunt reply, Dean didn’t have time to react when the man took the two steps separating them and planted his nose on Dean’s mating gland. Dean wasn’t the only one who was deeply affected, clearly. The totally blown out pupils Dean had been able to see for a second when the man had got closer to him only confirmed it. Dean could only close his eyes and fucking
The first slide of his boyfriend’s dick along his crack after so long is so glorious Dean couldn’t have helped the groan of pleasure he lets out to save his life. After a few seconds spent like that, Cas pushes his cock between Dean’s tights and instructs him to keep them as close as possible. The front of his panties prevents Cas’s cock from sliding too far ahead, and the friction that provides on Dean’s hole and balls is incredible. Nirvana is reached when Cas’s hands leave Dean’s hips and join Dean’s hands on the wall. Cas interlaces their fingers and keeps a strong hold on the hands beneath his palms, while his mouth and tongue start kissing and licking and nibbling at the right side of Dean’s neck.
“Absolutely,” Dean replies with honesty, holding his gaze and allowing for the other man to see that there’s nothing in his eyes apart from a burning need to give him a hand. Dean should probably look at said burning need a little bit more closely, but whatever.
Wow. Breathing is a marvelous thing. Dean should remember that next time he decides to give another long, heartfelt reply.
Still, Dean’s more than a little certain Jimmy won’t be there when he resurfaces from the bathroom. He absolutely refuses to believe he might not be the only thing no longer there though. Jimmy will
“You were that desperate for it, eh?” The smirk in Cas’s voice is the best indication the question is rhetorical.
does. He’s not embarrassed of how unabashedly he moans as his Dom’s tongue licks and sucks around his hole, while his hands pull his cheeks apart to give him room to lap at Dean's entrance as greedily as he wants.
He must sound and look as furious as he feels, because the kid appears just about ready to shit himself. Dean can’t say he’s not feeling a perverse satisfaction at seeing Samandriel taken down 25 notches,
The plug Castiel gifted his boy with this morning before he had to leave the house. The first part of his birthday present.
So Dean decides to give Cas as much reason as he can to forgive himself for even considering giving Dean the time of day and lies all his cards on the table.
The same applied to Cas riding him. He only came untouched if they were sitting and Cas’s dick was trapped against Dean’s belly, or if they were lying chest to chest with Cas on top. Those were lowkey some of Dean’s favorite moments because Cas liked to keep their fingers interlocked and never stopped kissing Dean while he worked his hips like a maniac to get his pleasure before Dean came inside the condom.
Bending forward from where he was kneeling in between Cas’s spread legs, he supports himself with his left hand on the mattress next to his boyfriend’s head, while he grips his cock with his right hand and starts brushing its head against Cas’s hole, teasing him to help the muscles unclench even further. When he can’t take any more teasing himself, he slowly, gently pushes inside, a low, relieved moan leaving Cas’s lips when the head pops in and stretches him just right. From there, Dean keeps pushing steadily until his balls are flush against Cas’s hole, and only then carefully lies on top of his boyfriend, Dean’s front plastered to Cas’s back, until he can start lightly kissing Cas’s neck and inhale the familiar scent of his hair, while his hands take the scenic route through Cas’s arms until his fingers can lace with Cas’s under his pillow.
That doesn’t mean that Cas hadn’t noticed Dean before last time, though. A shiver runs through Dean at the idea of Cas’s eyes tracking his movements on one of those occasions. Of those intense, blue, otherworldly eyes watching Dean approach another man and take him out of there with a very clear intent written all over his face, while Dean was unaware that that was what those beautiful eyes were doing. He doesn’t know whether he hopes that’s what’s happened or not. He sure knows he loves the idea of Cas’s eyes on him. Jealous, possessive, hungry.
Their journey back is spent mostly in silence, even though Castiel is pretty sure Balthazar would define what they are doing as “eye fucking”. They are admittedly busy with navigating the traffic and deal with the throngs of people you can only meet on a Sunday evening in New York, so it’s not exactly the ideal situation to have deep or long conversations. But they do seem unable to take their eyes off of each other. Now that Castiel has come to terms with what he feels and what he wants, he sees no need to prevent his attraction to Dean from shining through. Dean seems to be flustered and then pleased and then happy and then aroused by it. Castiel enjoys watching all the little signs on Dean’s gorgeous face and in his body language that signal the passage from one emotional state to the other. How his eyes have passed from darting everywhere else to be permanently locked with Castiel’s. How the respectful distance he was keeping at the beginning of the journey gets shorter and shorter as the trip back to Dean’s place progresses, so much so that they end up chest to chest on the busy metro for the last leg. They both keep one hand in their pocket and the other holding one of the overhead handles, and just stare at each other.
The London Eye has got nothing on Dean’s eye roll in reply to that. This wonderful man doesn’t know how to take a compliment. Interesting. “Shut up and tell me what I can give you to drink. Bacon and pancakes OK for breakfast? Hope so because that’s all we have.” Dean chuckles and rubs his neck again, as if he’s embarrassed he’s not giving Castiel even
Dean is uncertain at first, clearly trying to understand if Castiel means what he’s said, but then he starts, tentatively at first and then with vigor, to roll his hips in a sinuous motion. Those trim hips Castiel is gonna spend hours kissing and licking and sucking and biting and touching very soon. The rolling of Dean’s hips lets Castiel’s cock drag in and out of his ass in a way that seems to be making Dean delirious, if his increasingly loud noises and his inability to keep his eyes open are to be trusted. It takes Castiel a few moments to realize that Dean has angled his hips so that his prostate is hit every time Dean moves. Castiel didn’t think he’d ever like something like this, but he does. He really, really does. He’s keeping perfectly still, and letting Dean use him for his own pleasure, giving Dean a hard, warm dick to impale himself against. It doesn’t mean that he’s not enjoying the stimulation on his erection immensely, and he’s not watching how Dean’s hips make his cock disappear inside his ass avidly. The moment he moves just a fraction to adjust his hold on Dean’s wrist, however, his muscles relax some and he realizes that keeping himself that tense was keeping his orgasm at bay, but he’s much, much closer than he thought.
. He’s gripping Cas so tight he’s almost afraid to be hurting him, but Cas doesn’t complain, so either he’s not or Cas is so far gone that any pain turns into pleasure.
Cas craned his neck to the right and look at Dean with open, honest eyes. “Because you always give me what I need, exactly how I need it.”
To be honest, Castiel didn’t even try, after their non-date turned date, to stifle his sex dreams. When he entered the building that night, he knew that he was going to rub one out as soon as he walked through the door of his apartment. Just like he knew he would have thought about fucking all of Dean’s holes in every conceivable position for the next ten days at the very least.
Dean is gorgeous. Castiel absolutely adores the little pudge on his belly he referred to the first time they met, when Dean told him he had decided to start walking to and back from work. Castiel is so grateful it’s still there as he takes the opportunity to kiss it, after having familiarized with Dean’s neck, and shoulders and chest, and having even licked those delicious nipples, and enjoyed every single response this beautiful man has gifted him with.
Before he can reply, Cas takes a page from Dean’s book and start kissing and nipping his neck, which makes him way too distracted to reply.
“You fucking me in the shower, from behind,” Dean replies, panting a bit, “My, ah, face against the wall,” he adds, and then moans, forgetting to add “Sir” at the end. Yep, his boy’s already getting lost, and Castiel won’t fault him for it. Not when that’s all he wants right now.
He started with feather light kisses while keeping his hands spread on Cas’s ass to knead that delicious flesh and keep him as open as Dean’s mouth wanted him. His tongue darted out to start licking around Cas’s hole, circling it, before Dean hummed his elation at finally tasting his boy like he’d always wanted. The sound clearly sent sparks through Cas’s body because that’s when the first “Oh God” left his mouth. Dean continued lapping at his hole for a while, feeling Cas’s muscles relax the more he kept at it and his body start rocking back into his face. “Oh God” was soon joined by “So good” and “Please more”, until the three phrases became a continuous string interrupted only by Cas’s increasingly loud moans.
“No, no. It’s not like that. I wouldn’t take advantage of him any more than he would me. But he’s my friend. And-“
“A house where our brothers can also come visit, maybe even at the same time, if they can stop bickering for a single moment, and where maybe Jack, who might be married and a father by then, could come too.” Dean adds, because that’s the most comforting part of his daydreams about their future, and the loves the idea of sharing it with Cas.
tire of this slutty side of his otherwise proper and perfect boyfriend. When lost in the heat of the moment, Cas can get a mouth so filthy it can give professional whores on fleet week a run for their money. Dean will be forever thankful that
we’re talking, Winchester”, without a hitch. Dean wondered whether the fact that it had been one of Cas’s employees, rather than Cas himself, the one who had served them could have had anything to do with it. That was just ridiculous though. Cas was busy waiting on a table when it was their turn to place their order and things would have been just as fine if he’d been the one to attend to them.
Dean opens his eyes and looks at Castiel, hesitant. “Dirty talk.” His hesitation increases and the tone of his voice lowers when he adds, “But, like, no name calling, I don’t like that.”
When Dean turns around and Castiel gets an unobstructed view of his ass, he has a moment to consider that this might, in fact, be a mistake. Having a chance to look his fill of that ass and not being able to touch is gonna be torture.
There are many things Dean regrets and will forever regret. But none of them nearly as much as the way he dealt with – or
and his insecurities and the frustration of the past weeks bubbling up, and he’s powerless to stop them, he doesn’t even want to, because he’s pissed and hurt and logically he knows Cas wouldn’t cheat on him but he has to make sure.
So that’s how Castiel spent last evening. Beer in hand, sitting next to Dean Winchester on a couch in the garden of his hotel, soaking up every last bit of information about himself the gorgeous man felt like sharing with Castiel. It’s also how he hopes he’ll spend his evening today. That still doesn’t make him any less greedy for the opportunity to see Dean again in a few minutes, when he’ll come down for breakfast.
They stay like that for long moments, longer than it’s ever happened with other men, silent, enjoying these last stolen seconds of being one with the other. Until Cas presses a soft, lingering kiss to Dean’s back, pushes up on his arms and pulls out.
inspired to jump his bones right now. Admittedly, that might also have something to do with the tight black jeans that perfectly hug his ass and those magnificent thighs Dean hopes more than anything he’ll feel wrapped around himself before the night is over, or the tight fitting blue T-shirt Cas is wearing that showcases just how powerful his chest and biceps must be. He’s
“Then Cas it is,” Dean winks. Yep, still got it, Winchester. “And It’s OK, you know, to ramble about what you love. I’m the same. Don’t let me start talking about music,” he jokes.
Dean doesn’t reply, not verbally, but brings the glass to his lips and takes a small sip, his eyes never leaving Castiel’s. That’s when he says “I do. I like it very much. Absolutely delicious.”
Cas has been mostly silent so far, just asking a question here and there, but he’s listened to every single word Dean has said. Dean knows he’s being measured. Castiel
, the wide smile which makes his gums show, his nose scrunch up and the skin around his beautiful, blue eyes crinkle – not to mention that bright glint in his eyes that speaks of genuine, unadulterated joy – has appeared, making Dean feel like a God for putting it there. He’s even started singing along the last couple of songs, shyly at first and then a bit more boldly, aware that his voice is far too low and gravelly for those songs, but willing to show he’s having a great time anyway, almost with the kind of childlike delight and mischief one feels when they know they’re doing something they maybe shouldn’t do but end up doing anyway.
As expected, Castiel sees a flash of hurt in Dean’s eyes. Both of them know that’s the kind of thought which is still linked to Dean’s alpha male image in high school.
"How come you need to stay at a hotel for two whole weeks? You work around here, so you’re not a tourist.”
Cas had outright declared that was the one thing he wanted to have unconditional power over. Anything else, he gladly left to Dean, their mothers, fathers, brothers, and friends. He wasn’t the little bit interested in any other choice that was being made. “As long as you’re there and I get to marry you and you are happy and our families and friends are there, I will be happy.”
“Yeah, I think I’d have been scared shitless if I had to move here straight out of college. I don’t know that I could have been that strong.” Dean adds a smile for good measure, to make sure Cas sees he’s not being ironic. He’s trying to use his body language in combination with his words as much as possible, to make Cas understand what he really means with his words. He feels like when he uses emojis during a text convo for fear of being misunderstood. God, he’s exhausted. He
The pain in his neck shoots through Dean’s body like a bullet and lights up all of his nerve endings, turning him into a desperate mess. He moans loudly and grabs Cas’s ass with both hands to spread him as wide as he can as he fucks into him hard and deep. Cas’s exhausted body is heavy on top of him, and he’s not doing anything besides worrying the bite mark he’s left behind with his lips and tongue and letting himself being used for Dean’s pleasure. Dean’s fucking like an animal now, short, powerful thrusts that are setting his muscles on fire and making his breath labored and labored, only one goal in mind.
Somehow, that’s enough to put his mind at ease enough that he falls into a deep and dreamless sleep.
The following day they came back to the café after lunch and ordered their coffee, which actually tasted like it should and had Charlie say “
see Cas’s face. He doesn’t need to be reminded of every smile he’s gifted the smarmy kid with, while Dean was sitting next to him, watching the display and feeling mocked and powerless. He needs to lose himself in the rest of his boyfriend’s body, which has always only belonged to him ever since they started dating. His muscled back, his toned arms, his big hands, his broad shoulders, his soft hair smelling of his citrusy shampoo – a scent that makes Dean feel content and calm instantly after so many years – his strong thighs, his round, perfect, tight ass, which always opens up for Dean and welcomes him home.
“You aren’t so full of yourself to believe you’re getting lucky tonight, are you? Not with me at least.”
That damn smile is a weapon, and the worst thing is that Dean’s not even using it against him on purpose. He’s just so happy that his smile is lightening up his whole face and body. Castiel is powerless, isn’t he?
Dean started to snap his hips faster and faster and to go as deep as he could, Cas’s hands falling on the mattress next to his shoulders to help him stay balanced and counteract the strength of Dean’s thrusts, his face on the pillows and his fingers gripping the sheets tightly, his back arched beautifully and his ass canted in the air for Dean to fuck however he wanted. Fuck Mona Lisa, The Starry Night and The Kiss, this man right here was the true masterpiece.
His grunt when he pushes himself on his elbows to look down at Dean and lightly peck his lips, as if that was something he's used to doing whenever, speaks of the mighty effort required of him to leave his comfortable spot on his human pillow.
cock he has, with how much that delicious dick stretched his lips when Dean got down on his knees for him after he finally got him naked. But being drop dead gorgeous and having a big dick don’t guarantee the guy will know what to do with it. This dude here though? This one knows
“If that is the case,” Dean starts, because he has to know for sure, “do you think you‘d be opposed to me still having breakfast here, even though I check out tomorrow?”
Castiel stands up too and kisses him softly, Dean perfectly still and only his lips reciprocating what his Dom is giving them. Still not touching because he hasn’t received explicit permission to do so. Perfect.
As the day progressed, his anger got worse and worse. But the concern resurfaced too. He alternated between being worried and pissed, constantly looking for a rational explanation that could justify Cas’s sudden change in behavior, and concluding that there was none and that Cas was simply being a giant baby.
Dean doesn't mind. He quite likes it, in fact, to be kept in place by the full weight of Cas's body, while he's enjoying the afterglow of their spectacular fucking and Cas is still snuggled inside of his ass.
Castiel needs to stop this train wreck from happening because it is frankly painful to watch. “As enticing as the idea of you on your knees and begging is, I think I could be persuaded to have breakfast with you either on Wednesday or Thursday next week.”
“It is. And, well, we’re getting swamped. She used to make appointments and handle the whole logistical aspect of the body shop, from answering the phone and welcoming clients to reminding my dad about orders and deliveries. This has always allowed us to focus on our job, and now we need to stop doing what we’re doing to go answer the phone every so often, among other things, and it’s fucking annoying.”
. And he has populated it with every kind of shit over time. Knick knacks without any kind of function, or stuff he scarcely ever uses or even looks at. But if things have even a lick of sentimental value for him, he keeps them.
Dean’s eye roll is unexpected, and totally exasperated, as if he can’t believe Castiel is this dense. “I don’t want this, Cas. I want
"They have all the organic products I like, a lot of interesting menu choices and reasonable prices, Dean. Samandriel's just a polite, hard-working young man who knows his revenues depend on tips more than anything."
They’ve never talked. Not once. They’ve met at most of Dean’s trials for the better part of one year now, and none of them has approached the other, even though they both want to. Their eye-fucking certainly cannot be taken as a sign of lack of interest on either of their parts.
They’re in his bedroom, and they’ve just finished fucking. As usual by now, Cas has helped himself to Dean’s en-suite to clean himself up and come back with a damp cloth for Dean. Unlike their first night together though, Dean’s started to drag Cas back to bed for some post-sex making out after he’s washed his come away from his chest or from wherever it’s landed. He knows he’s getting clingy and clingy, but he just doesn’t care one bit how desperate that makes him look, because he just wants Cas that much and can’t, won’t, miss out on even a second of their time together. This time it’s even worse, his need for Cas. For one reason or another, it‘s been two weeks since the last time they were together and Dean’s missed Cas so much, missed being with him, touching him, kissing him, smelling him, feeling him inside and been touched and kissed and smelled and filled by him, that the relief of finally being together again is almost too much.
That seemed to be enough of a reasonable explanation, because Jimmy’s shoulders visibly went down, allowing Dean to keep talking.
“You’re lucky you’re cute, Winchester,” he says, trying to sound stern but sounding disgustingly fond instead.
“Just-“, Cas hesitated again, staring at Dean for a few seconds as if to make sure Dean was actually interested in his reply. Dean held his gaze the whole time. He didn’t like seeing Cas so tense, and he needed to understand if there was something he could do to help.
When he steps into the shower, he can’t help but marvel at how spacious it is and at what an incredible water pressure it has. The products he finds in there are green and eco-friendly, the label proudly says, and he can see, and smell, that both the shampoo and the shower gel are based on lavender. There’s someone who has an obsession with lavender in this place, isn’t there?
, the kind of good you feel when you are safe and taken care of, and he can’t help but consider how weird it is to have that kind of feeling in a place that should, for all intent and purposes, feel foreign and instrumental, rather than safe and welcoming.
What that situation and the current situation had in common? Castiel going away instead of staying. Castiel punishing himself thinking that he was doing the best thing for everyone, when he just needed to talk, even argue, with Dean.
“Yes, yes! It’s-. Thank you, Dean. I-, I can’t believe this.” Cas’s eyes start filling with tears he doesn’t even try to stop and his hands go to grip the edge of the kitchen counter, not doubt for support.
“No, Sir. We wouldn’t,” he agrees, his green eyes sparkling with excitement and hopefulness. How he can be both sexy as sin and adorable as a puppy at the same time is a mystery Castiel is pretty sure will forever remain unsolved.
Every side of himself finally satisfied, Castiel pulls out carefully and grabs Dean’s legs so he can lower them down in a way that doesn’t jostle his boy too much. Dean’s still lost in his own head.
Dad clears his throat and doesn’t even try to hide the fact he’s drying his cheek with his hand before he asks, “Does he know how to do the job at least?”
he was baking. Cas loves Dean’s baked goods. ‘And your non-baked goods too, hehe,’ the fourteen year old that lives permanently in Dean’s head supplies, causing older Dean to stifle a laugh in spite of himself. Gosh, he’s a giant idiot, he can only hope Cas won’t notice before Dean’s put a ring on it.
Dean is the one who leans on Cas when Cas pulls him against his side, not the other way around. It is Cas who constantly scent marks Dean to reassure him Cas’s love is always with him. Dean is the one who always wears a black leather bracelet with the engraving “Property of Castiel Winchester” on the inside.
Dean ignores him. A promise is a promise, after all. He keeps rimming him until his jaw aches – Dean’s sure it will ache for days, which is a small price to pay just to hear all the filthy things Novak’s saying – and kneading his cheeks so his thumbs can help spread Novak’s hole for his tongue to push inside.
Dean smiled and added “Since we are exclusive, I want everyone to know. I wanna be able to come here and kiss you.”
for Dean to both mentally pat himself on the back for another good decision, and to think he’s falling hard and fast for a huge dork and he’s okay with that.
“So I fingered myself as soon as I got to the hotel,” Cas adds, because he clearly wants to make sure Dean’s brain will never be able to function again. “I thought about you, while I was doing it. I always think about you.” Cas’s need to slip his tongue back inside of Dean’s mouth forces him to cut himself off.
Dean stands up carefully, mindful of the lack of stability that wearing heels that high entails, and Castiel revels in seeing his pretty cock poking out of the hem of his panties because Dean got fully hard just by sucking him off.
So things are going okay, all in all. Mostly, Dean hates the impossibility to get in touch with Cas when they’re not together. He even offered to buy him a phone, but Cat refused because he doesn’t want Dean to spend even more money on him and also because he would probably be mugged for it.
Dean honestly appreciates working with committed people he knows he can count on. It doesn’t really hurt that Novak is eye candy too. Dark, thick and silky-looking hair, big, expressive baby blues, plump lips any sex worker in the world would kill to have, high, defined cheekbones, strong jaw, eternal five o’clock shadow and
For his part, Cas is more than determined to not take more advantage of Dean than strictly necessary. So when Dean suggests he could buy Cas some clothes for the first few days at work, Cas counter suggests that Dean might keep lending him some, as they are mainly the same size, until he gets his first paycheck. Dean almost has a stroke at the thought of Cas in his clothes again and again, since apparently he has a possessive kink a mile long that gets activated right away when his clothes are on the man, but it’s not like he can say no without it being suspicious (‘Try obvious…’) as hell. Cas seems extremely pleased when Dean agrees and seems to love to choose what clothes to wear in the morning while Dean is in the shower. Doing naughty things based on even naughtier thoughts.
He starts leaning forward and Castiel can only meet him halfway. And thank his lucky star that he ever got to meet this man and he now gets to kiss his beautiful lips.
As soon as they entered the coffee shop Charlie commented on how homey and welcoming it was, and that made Dean feel giddy. He was maybe, possibly, a little bit, invested in Cas making a good impression. Not that he’d ever tell her. That would influence her judgment and put the objectivity of the test at risk.
Dean’s a face Castiel couldn’t help but fall in love with desperately when he was a teenager, no matter how many reasons he had not to, and that he could never forget, no matter how much time and how many reasons he had to.
The complete silence is what brings Dean back to the present moment. The room is empty. So much for speaking with Novak.
He hadn’t expected Cas’s enthusiastic reaction though. It’s not like he hadn’t daydreamed about it, he totally did, fantasizing that Cas would jump him as soon as the words would leave his mouth. He didn’t actually
Because if Cas really was, or is, into the bad boy thing, Dean can no longer be of service. Dean couldn’t behave like that now, not even for a sexy role play. Whenever he thinks about his high school entitlement, his insides churn with guilt and disappointment. He knows he’ll never truly get over it, and that that particular brand of guilt will always be there. But he’s been working hard to become someone he can be proud of, and he’s not going back, not an inch, not for anything or anyone. Not even for Castiel fucking Novak.
moved on. He had a job, an apartment, in a tiny town which ranked so much better than most areas in terms of livability. He had friends. That he had made on his own. Going back now would make everything complicated again, one way or another. Yet, he was doing it because he wanted to find his way back home. He
'Akwaaaaard,' Dean muses, as they ride up in the elevator, both of them silent and clearly tense. They're not even attempting small talk. Dean wishes he could know why Cas is so wound up. He knows he himself is this tense from a mix of anticipation and trying not to jump Cas right here and now. Yes, he might have fantasized about it when Cas mentioned the elevator ride this morning at breakfast, but he doesn't actually want their first – but hopefully not last – time to be in an elevator.
“That’s because you are so incredibly good for me. Go on, beautiful. I will only be a minute, promise.”
“No,” Dean whispers, seemingly unable to focus on anything but Castiel’s approach and his lowering himself on Dean’s body.
Cas groans as he slicks his cock all over, making Dean gasp and moan in turn when he gently removes the plug, adds some lube to his hole and spreads it around a bit. He doesn’t waste any more time after that, pushing inside in one smooth thrust, until his hips are pressed flat to Dean’s ass and Dean can finally be filled like he’s wanted for hours and moan to his heart’s content. He puts his big, strong hands on Dean’s sides and caresses his hips, lower back and ass to give him a moment to get used to it, and then starts a rhythm of short and fast thrusts. For all his talk about foreplay, it’s clear Cas is as desperate as Dean.
How could he not? The mental images of the hot court reporter’s blue eyes looking up at Dean from beneath his eyelashes demurely as he’s sprawled on Dean’s bed about to be speared on his cock and of him squirming on his seat in court the following day, while he fights to stay focused and take notes even though he can barely sit because his ass is still aching from what Dean’s dick did to it the previous night, and while he flushes red – because Dean just
Dean and let him feel his Dom’s adoration and pride through actions as well. Castiel keeps a regular motion at first, his hands back on Dean’s hips, his eyes fixated on his cock pushing inside Dean’s hole. He also pulls out just to push back in a few times, because he loves the feeling of Dean’s muscles around the head of his cock when he breaches him, loves how there’s always a bit of resistance that grips the sensitive head like a vice, only to give way and grant his cock entrance. But then the need to push deep again, like before, like when he was buried all the way inside of his boy, becomes impossible to ignore.
Speaking of Dean, please enjoy another portion of Mr Novak's slow but sure descent into Winchesterland 😬😬
He comes with a strangled cry, surprised that he’d been so close to his climax and he hadn’t even realized it. Cas groans loudly when he does, clearly reveling in Dean’s inner muscles clenching around his cock and goes back to fucking Dean in earnest while Dean’s still trembling from his aftershocks and his toes are still curled in his boots.
On Friday, he takes all but ten steps inside the club and he’s ready to admit that hooking up with someone else is the excuse, and hoping to see Cas is the real reason why he’s here. His shortened breathing and the lump in his throat are pretty clear indications of that. He’s not excited at the prospect of meeting and getting to fuck someone new, like he usually is. He’s a nervous wreck.
“C’mon, baby,” Dean says, trying not to laugh and failing spectacularly. “Gonna get something to clean us up.”
clearly determined to speak to him, if the confident stride of the gorgeous man walking in his direction and his eager green eyes and even more eager smile aren’t deceiving him.
space at last; about getting familiar with his new neighborhood and having stopped getting confused about the metro; about meeting his new boss and colleagues and getting along with basically everyone, even though the jury’s still out on a couple of colleagues he’s had a few bumps with because “I look younger than I am and people somehow take that as a sign of lack of experience, or strength of character” – meaning someone didn’t take Dean seriously because he’s too good looking to also be a smart businessman, which is something Castiel himself has had to deal with a time or two; Dean tells him about face timing with his family and friends all weekend long and how his brother Sammy (“It’s Sam, actually, but, you know, I have my annoying big brother duties to perform”) has been making fun of him for “finally snatching a date with the boy you’ve been pining for since you were a junior and that I honestly thought didn’t really exist”. Sam was a fresher when Dean was a senior, so Castiel missed him by one year and has never met him. He didn’t even know Dean had a younger brother. But that’s not the most relevant piece of information in that statement. Castiel is actually stunned by how straightforward Dean is about his pining for him. Dean did say he had been thinking about Castiel since high school the very first time they talked at the conference, but Castiel had sort of taken it as a hyperbole. He’s realizing that it very much was not, and that Dean’s putting himself on the line without reservation. Castiel could easily stomp on him and do as much damage as Dean did in high school, if not more.
He’s almost afraid to leave the bedroom though. He knows Castiel didn’t leave anything in here, but he doesn’t know that if he goes to the living room or kitchen, hell, possibly the very door to his apartment, he won’t find a snarky note about how his ass had been good enough that the time Castiel’s wasted on him hasn’t been all wasted after all, but he shouldn’t call Cas ever again, or something equally degrading. Same reason why Dean will delay looking at his phone for as long as he possibly can. If Cas didn’t leave a note, he might have sent Dean a text along those lines.
The walk back to his place had been a silent affair, an awkward silence reigning after the brief “Hey Jimmy, ready?”, “Sure” interaction they had when Dean met him at this spot after work.
Dean’s surprised face is hilarious and extremely satisfying. Then he chuckles and says “I’m getting a friggin’ mango and coconut flavored chapstick on the off chance that might entice you enough that you might want to kiss me next time, aren’t I?”
That earns him a relieved “Thank you, Dean,” and a number of small cues in his body language that make Dean understand Cas has relaxed a tiny bit. Dean doesn’t think he could have hoped for better than this.
He had started learning soon after that infamous conversation. In fact, it was then – when he was presented with the choice between Dean and heaven – that Castiel stopped playing his part, the part that God himself, disguised as a failed writer with a drinking problem, had written for him. “You guys aren't supposed to be there. You're not in this story!”, that awful, absent father that told them. Castiel would never forget Dean’s proud and awed reaction when he replied “Yeah well, we're making it up as we go.” Castiel couldn’t have predicted, that day, exactly how far he would go in his rebellion to protect the Winchesters and this world, and how many unforgivable mistakes he himself would have made. But the moment he consciously decided to help the two hunters avert the apocalypse was the moment Castiel became Castiel.
“So we can actually have two last first times,” Cas comments, and kisses Dean’s mouth. “As fiancées and as husbands.”
How could all of this not have contributed to what was, ultimately, the summary of all that Dean had to go through and, consequently, the one true reason why Dean never expected or never looked for anything good to come his way? His complete inability to believe in happy endings?
Oops. Dean’s words might have got away from him a tiny bit. Let not be said that, when Dean Winchester finally decides to do something, he does it halfway. Once the dam gets broken, it’s fucking
He pours some lube on his fingers, warms it a bit and starts circling Cas’s hole, while his other hand goes to trace small soothing circles on his lower back. Cas tenses briefly then, but Dean knows it’s from the cold of the lube. He relaxes immediately and Dean pushes a first finger inside. The sigh Cas releases can only be described as relief. Dean knows he’s sorry and he feels guilty, so he’s not surprised that he’s sighing in relief now. When Cas asked Dean to confirm he was still his, that was his way to say “please tell me I didn’t fuck up so bad that you won’t want to touch me ever again”. As if. Deep down, beyond all the bad feelings caused by Dean’s own fears and Samandriel’s cheating behavior, Dean knows Cas is just inherently too good and often forgets most people aren’t like that, and Dean can’t really say he’d like for Cas to be different or to change. Just like Cas loves and accepts all of Dean, Dean wouldn’t change a hair on Cas’s head.
. You, Dean. Just you. Exactly the way you are. Because you are as stunning inside as you are outside, and I want you so much it hurts.”
Luckily Charlie is in his corner about all of this. Her rainbows-and-puppies attitude certainly has a lot to do with it, but she always says she’s proud of what he’s doing and he should be too. She also never fails to mention that she can’t wait to meet Cas and that she’s sure he’s totally a Hufflepuff (‘She’s wrong, Dean. He’s totally a Gryffindor like you,’ his brain amends every time she says that. It’s
He replies with his biggest, brightest smile, wanting for Cas to realize how absolutely thrilled the offer makes him. "I'd love to, Cas."
his best friend not walking through that portal even though Dean had fought tooth and nail, literally, to allow him to.
One was spoilt for choice, when it came to pick out a reason why Dean had never, and might never, confess his love.
He took hold of the lube but left the condoms there, which earned him a frown from the lean, fit, sexy beauty who was patiently waiting for him, completely silent but with eager eyes that weren’t missing a single one of his movements, and were laser focused on him as he made his way to the couch.
So that’s what Dean has learned, and always done. Always respected everyone else, never thought he was better than others, never underestimated – or overestimated – anyone based on their primary or secondary gender, always behaved as a strong, reliable partner with the omegas he was in a relationship with but never let himself go with them, not completely. He never showed too much affection, because, in his mind, showing affection meant showing feelings, which meant showing and admitting to being weak. He did let go during sex, all of them were absolutely satisfied with his sexual prowess, as he never failed to mount them and knot them without restraint. That was the only way he had to feel really close to them. He would have wanted to talk to them, share his desires and fears, but he couldn’t. That would have been unbecoming of him. Of any alpha, really.
With a sigh, he sadly decides to relent with the heavy flirting. He almost starts feeling sorry for Dean’s ass. With how much sexual frustration he’s accumulating just tonight, he’ll end up positively destroying it the first time he gets to bury himself in it.
After dinner, they each bath a child, dress them in their footed pajamas – the solution to prevent Will from taking off his socks and getting cold during the night – and put them down for the night. As usual, Cat and Will are read a story, which never fails to make them go out like a light. Tonight it’s Cas’s turn, and he opts to read from
A high-pitched whine is punched out of Cas, and then he’s screaming his pleasure as he starts shooting rope after rope of warm come on his own chest, some of it predictably landing on Dean’s clothes – his neck is
He starts leaving little open mouthed kisses along the whole length, which he’s still stimulating with his hand too.
