"It's fine, Sherlock," John said, taking a breath to sort himself out.
"Two two one," Sherlock says slowly as if he is too drunk to understand, pretending to stifle a burp,"B-Baker Street."
"Fetch the cable," Sherlock suggested. Well, he said it with the same matter-of-fact tone he used most of the time when he was pointing out obvious things, which many people found to be demanding. John hadn't seemed to mind it so far, and two-thirds of people object to it on the first exposure, so that was a good sign for how well John understood Sherlock's meaning.
"Nobody. For now, but I won't die a nobody, now will I?" Sherlock can't argue with that, and tiredly leans back in his seat. He blows out a long breath through his nose, trying to concentrate. Having gathered himself as much as he can he points to the capsules on the table.
"Sherlock can have that effect on people," Lestrade chuckled conspiratorially. "Never mind trying to keep up with him on a normal day, let alone while on the mend."
"Pardon?"
"So can severe blood loss. He didn't mention my fitness when he was running down my life's story earlier, so I have to wonder if he was just being polite..." John began.
"It is a two-patch problem," Sherlock replied, though he wasn't just talking about the case. He'd have used a third if he had it, and now he didn't have any emergency stash left in his coat. He took several slow breaths, holding the patches on his skin to speed the delivery, sighing in relief when he started to feel the change in his personal chemistry. John was thinking. Sherlock could see him without turning toward him using the reflection on the window and every line of the man's body screamed with the effort of processing what he'd just witnessed, but he said nothing. Vague approval dawned in the man's eyes and John gave a silent nod before stepping away.
"Cardiff?" Lestrade prompts, ending the awkward moment.
"Jus' round the corner! It's Baker Street!" Sherlock slurs, wobbling around a bit unsteadily as if he can't quite manage flat pavement.
John followed Sherlock's periodic directions, catching sight of the man frequently as he swanned over the rooftops like the chimney sweeps from Mary Poppins. The zig-zag path Sherlock had taken over the rooftops and through alleyways was hard for John to follow on the ground, and the man was moving swiftly whenever John caught sight of him, but the time Sherlock took between moving from one alley to another had let John keep pace so long as he didn't stop moving. The only problem was the misty rain that started coming down on the soldier's hair as the clouds rolled in. The breezy weather wasn't quite a proper storm, but the winter wet was still a great deal colder than John's tropics-adjusted body cared for. The exercise kept him warm, but only just enough not to duck in somewhere to warm up. Several chirps of his phone signaled that Sherlock had 'found it, I knew I would' and navigated John to the detective's exact location. The last in the series of excited and impatient messages was some sort of special link thing for the map that essentially let John walk his dot toward another dot that was Sherlock until the two collided head-on. The manic brunette was holding a small pink case when he poked his head out of an alley several blocks away from their starting location.
"Trouble is, your friends all think you're acting," the cabbie taunts him as he struggles to sit up, recognizing dimly that he is now in the back of the cab. The last things he is aware of before losing the fight with the sedative are the sound of the engine starting and the cabbie's voice from the front seat: "That's the thing about people. They're all stupid."
"You wanted me to call someone?" John asked.
"Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie," he tries some flattery. Rubbing his fingers across his chin, he drops his hand but is now strong enough to keep his head up. He looks at the cabbie. "How did you choose which ones?"
"Well, you're gonna have to go, Captain Watson, I've bent the rules enough tonight. Though... Where are you assigned that you ran into Sherlock?"
"You make the slightest move towards that phone, I'll kill yer."
The situation was intolerable. No one liked being around him for long periods of time. He didn't like being around people much, either. He considered Miss Molly Hooper, a pathologist at Bart's morgue, but her apparent infatuation with him would add complications he was neither inclined nor prepared to deal with. Also, the cats were incompatible with Mrs. Hudson's allergies. Lestrade still hadn't left his wife because of their children despite how much of a wreck his marriage was. No one else on the force tolerated him. His various street contacts either didn't have sufficient funds or were unsavory enough that Mycroft would evict them on Mrs. Hudson's behalf. He was quite certain he'd need to find new accommodations yet again quite shortly. Either Mycroft would send someone who would drive him away or he'd drive whoever Mrs. Hudson found away and it would end in disaster.
"And who the hell are you?" Lestrade asks, as if he hadn't met John earlier tonight.
(noun) a person made weak or disabled by illness or injury.
"What did you think?" Tense with nerves, or perhaps eager to impress? The man was a bit public school, with a lot of expensive belongings, but looking to cut costs with a flat-share. There were plenty of spare sons of such-and-such blue-blooded line in the army, used to a certain standard of living before being weaned - or kicked - off the family bankroll. John was familiar with the breed. A bit of a show-off, then? John could work with that. John nudges his way past the posed stance Sherlock hid behind by scoffing quietly at Sherlock's question with calculated precision. Nervous, clearly, and very concerned about John's reaction going by the way the man's expressive face crumbles at the dismissal.
"Doesn't matter; it was poison," Sherlock dismisses with a wave of his hand. "Same pattern each time." Sherlock picks up the woman's hand and looks at it while he is talking. He sniffs at her face, palm, and nails, much as John had, but then gently shifts her clothing more than John had. "Each one of them disappears from their normal lives: from the theater, from the office, from the pub." John has to move out of the way as Sherlock comes around to the other side of the body, continuing to gently examine the body. He checks her pockets and prods at her coat here and there, even turning her collar up for a moment. "Then, turn up a few hours later somewhere they've no reason to be, dead." Sherlock's voice has slowly lost volume as he explained, ending up soft and sad before shaking himself and starting to speak at normal volume again. "No marks of violence on the body, no suggestion of compulsion. Each of them has taken the same poison – and, as far as we can tell, taken it voluntarily."
"I've spent the majority of my life in communal living arrangements of one sort or another," the former soldier reminded Sherlock.
"I didn't mean to..." Sherlock tried to backpedal.
"Thank you, Angelo." Sherlock's dismissal goes completely unnoticed as Angelo is speaking only to John.
Sherlock's answer was a little slower to arrive this time.
Why was he even talking about this? There was a case on! Focus!
Dinner, getting to know each other, and a bad cab ride.
"How do you know she had a case?" John interrupted with his own question, as that seemed to be a better question to get the two men on the same page than the things they were actually saying to each other. Sherlock pointed down at the back of the woman's right leg, letting loose another rapid-fire explanation.
He had already checked the outside for anything useful, running a bit of tape on the outside to catch fibers as soon as he could, but that would be a Hail Mary given the amount and type of rubbish the ratty tarp-covered skip contained and the wet mist that worked its way under the bedraggled makeshift cover. Fingerprints would be a lost cause on the textured surface of the suitcase as well. There were no useful marks or scuffs on the outside at all. Sherlock pulled out his cell phone to do a reverse lookup of the identification on the suitcase tag and noted the results. The extra pair of hands that joined his when he started shifting the pile of cold case files sitting on the coffee table and laying down plastic to prevent contamination halved the amount of time he had to wait to get the suitcase open. Then, he carefully opened the case, removing the items within one at a time and setting them aside. When Sherlock finished, he sat back in his chair and steepled his fingers as he ran through various scenarios to explain the items arrayed in front of him and get a proper idea of the victim's movements and intentions. The missing cell phone was a glaringly obvious clue, but it would not do to get too distracted by the obvious and fail to consider the smaller details.
"I'm just getting a drink while we wait," John's voice pierced through Sherlock's thoughts again. "Not much in at the moment, but I've got filtered water, orange juice, milk." Sherlock looked over at the doctor. He stood in front of the counter with one glass in front of him and the cupboard open ready to take out a second. Dr. Watson must be big on hydration, a good habit to develop in the hotter climates he spent the majority of his career in. Probably best to appease him.
"No sign yet, then?" John asks when he is about halfway through his aubergine pasta.
"The whole 'ouse is empty. Even your landlady's away, so there's no point in raising your voice. We're all locked in, nice and snug," the condescending words drip from the man's mouth.
"I've seen men die before," John began to speak slowly, looking away uncomfortably as clearly unpleasant memories surface,  "and good men, friends of mine. Thought I'd never sleep again." When he looks back at Sherlock, the tension has gone, leaving his blue eyes as calm as quiet lakes. "I'll sleep fine tonight."
"By who?" John asks, a half-second before realizing that is the point of their investigation.
John thinks, but keeps his answer simple.
"Oh... oh! To regain the lost dexterity in your dominant hand, yes, I should have realized. I attributed the pressure marks and calluses on your fingers to using that medicinal fidget device you bought," Sherlock said as he hopped into his slippers and shrugged on his coat. "This is extraordinarily detailed! It must have taken ages to make."
Sherlock was unaccustomed to having this kind of difficulty. He had a case. It was a good case: a creative serial killer. He should have been able to easily focus on solving it to the point of blocking out all other demands on his time and attention. He'd been following it avidly, soaking up as much information as he could get out of his various contacts and irritating Lestrade long before the D.I. caved and brought him in to help. He wasn't even entirely sure what day it was, as he had been on an odd sleep cycle to begin with due to his other cases and might have lost one from the flips to nocturnal and back he'd done. Even with that complication, the little puzzles he'd been thrown to keep him too busy to bother Lestrade about the two oddly similar suicides had been quite disappointing, then even more so when there were three deaths. Now, there were four identical suicides, there was something new about the last one, and there a mistake to chase down. Nothing should be intruding on his focus.
"Oh! Brilliant! Thought it was going to be a dull evening," Sherlock exclaims as he puts on his coat, turning briefly to John. "Honestly, can't beat a really imaginative serial killer when there's nothing on the telly." Leaping across the room while he puts his scarf on, traversing the coffee table in the process, he goes to dig something out from a box. "Mrs. Hudson, I may be out late. Might need some food."
"But the Pride parades aren't for months," Sherlock managed to say when they were winding down, hoping to tag on another crass joke to keep the bright smile on John's face and realizing a beat too late that his mind had flown well ahead of his mouth resulting in him voicing a punchline without the necessary setup.
"Yeah, I was there when you came by to fetch him, looking to rent a room from Mrs. Hudson. Flat-share, actually, as the upstairs is just a bed and bog. That's how Mike set us up, might have to phone him and ask what the blazes..." John says absently as he looks up at the sky tiredly, hoping to discern which way was north despite being recently accustomed to the brighter and differently positioned stars of a rural setting and distant latitude. No luck with the patchy cloud cover obscuring most of the sky. What he did see brought his thoughts to a halt. There, among the chimney pots on the roof across the street, was Sherlock Holmes. Tall frame lit by the full moon and the shine of a thousand city lights, he cuts an imposing figure as he stalks along one roof-line and then turns abruptly to dash to the other side of the building to look down along the other side.
"Do you want to eat?" Sherlock asks, ignoring the implications easily now that he has gotten his mind properly focused on the case again.
"There's been a fourth, and something is different this time," Sherlock says to himself. Someone hurries up the stair - did they even knock? - and Sherlock speaks before they come through the open door. "Where this time?"
"Doctor Watson," Sherlock's voice breaks through the haze and catches his focus again.
"So: ran after a cab. Told you that limp was psychosomatic."
"Damn my leg!" The words burst out of him involuntarily. An old woman fussing over him when he absolutely doesn't need it is just a bit too much for a moment, but his manners come back in the next second. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that sometimes this bloody thing..." John finishes his sentence by smacking his bad leg with his cane.
"What am I doing here?" John says softly as he clumsily lowers himself to one knee, still holding tight to the cane so that it doesn't bump into anything and disturb evidence.
"It's January, and I'm used to lower latitudes. Not that Afghanistan is hot all the time. Peaks of 45C in the summer, of course, but it can be downright frigid at times with the Himalayas right next door. Add to that, I'd been in Africa and the South Pacific a good long while before that," John explained with a shrug. "It's been years since I've been back in London for winter. A nice thick jumper is usually enough, but then this misty rain. I'll be fine once I dry off."
"Good god, it hurts just looking at you using that," Donovan scoffed.
"He has obviously been dead since the Christmas party, and the gift I gave you then is the evidence collected from the scene prior to our arrival this morning. The level of decomposition is not inconsistent with the time frame. For the purpose of this puzzle, 221A and B were empty because we were all away, Mrs. H on an extended holiday visiting family in America and us to Edinburgh on a case that became a bit of a holiday. We were called back when it was spotted by Mrs. Turner's ladies from their window yesterday evening and took the night train home." Their neighbors had actually been away on a second honeymoon until last night, the rather loud argument that detailed their trip an unexpected event which fit the narrative too perfectly to be left out.
"Maybe," Sherlock spits back over his shoulder, sounding tetchy and not caring about how transparent his feeling on the matter are, "but he's dead." Sherlock walks away, still clutching the orange blanket. Lestrade snickers quietly, but even with the crowd of idle police hanging around making comments Sherlock still hears it. Sherlock goes straight over to John.
"It's still chance," Sherlock argues, shaking his head hoping to clear it.
"Who, Sherlock Holmes?" John asks.
In any case, I am gay but you are not gay so nothing will come of it. I'd say I've proven quite well that I can contain myself. Aside from just now, that is, which I am sorry for." John physically stopped the lanky man from winding himself up further by halting his expressive hands, squaring up in front of the detective so he couldn't be ignored.
All in all, he was feeling a lot more like himself after having two bottles of water slowly forced upon him to help the process along, and retroactively resented having to piss in a bottle while laying down in the ambulance while too drugged to do anything less embarrassing. Drugging people and then using hypnosis tactics on them was just cheating - the steady, unchanging tone of voice that Jeff Hope used coupled with the pageantry of setting out the pill bottles was textbook magician. The worst part was he still didn't see how he tricked the other victims into taking the correct pill. Two pills, but with his other victims only one would kill. He knew how the man tricked people into playing the game, drugging away inhibitions would be quite effective if he chose his victims carefully, but he didn't know how Hope ensured he won.
"I don't follow," Lestrade said when they started walking again.
"I'd hypothesized something between ballistics gel over a plaster skeleton and a dressed-up inflatable doll depending on the amount of time and work you put into creating it. How does one commission a knitted cadaver?"
he added.
Captain Watson spent hours at the range when on a proper base, hanging out with the snipers when they were sizing each other up and trading techniques with the other soldiers who spend far more time on the front lines than any member of the RAMC ever should. In the beginning, he hadn't minded being the man who came in last for their pissing contests. It saved someone else's ego and was a fair bit of fun. A doctor's pay grade meant buying a round at the end for his loss didn't hurt too much. Later, he placed bets and won a fair chunk of money surprising the 'real soldiers' with how good a 'squishy non-combatant' could shoot. When stationed closer to the actual action, he had a steady stream of books to read. Thanks to a network of libraries in America somewhere determined to 'support the troops' by regularly sending mixed boxes of books to coalition forces, the available reading list was rather diverse. The fiction books were always snatched up quickly, but that was fine. Watson found the random assortment of non-fiction books he picked up are easier to read without getting distracted by the weird way Americans use spelling and punctuation than anything less cerebral. Getting pulled out of a narrative to ponder basic grammar wasn't a good time, but he could ignore it if he was already puzzling out some obscure bit of philosophy or history.
"Yeah, but some of the guys wanna take photographs." Lestrade's snicker grates on Sherlock's remaining patience, and he looks away from him in disgust. At least the case isn't completely over. He may not have figured out how Jeff Hope did it, and will need to ask about what was in the pills they collected to know if his murder-suicide hypothesis was correct, but there was a new mystery to solve.
"Those permits cover trace evidence and samples of human tissue one gram or less in size, not whole thumbs," Lestrade pointed out.
," Sherlock explained, flapping his hands around as if trying to swim through the unfamiliar subject matter and looking at everything in the flat except for John. "Sex isn't generally something I voluntarily waste time thinking about, yes, and I do have a low libido, but I am not... that is, it isn't
"I dunno," Sherlock said, sober enough to find the lingering slur in his speech abhorrent. He lies: "In all the confusion, I lost track. I don't know which I chose. Maybe they were both poison." He turns to walk away.
Escapism was popular. Some of his fellow soldiers read high fantasy novels, or watched every movie they could. Others had letters full of daydreams about 'when I get home.' A few indulged in chemical vices, sometimes to unsafe extremes, but usually within both the law and reasonable parameters. There was even that one fresh recruit who (due to an idiot putting gray water where it didn't belong, a very loud portable speaker attached to a solar-powered screen, and an excitable Irishman who many thought ought to stop playing video games and take up voice acting) managed to introduce an overfull medical tent of groggy men to the concept of "Let's Play" videos. He made most of them cry some days later when they reached the emotional highpoint of the
"Sherlock, the mess you've made!" Mrs. Hudson moaned when she caught sight of the currently unusable kitchen, distracting her from her ruminations on John and Sherlock's relationship status. The older woman snatched up a bin and stalked into the cluttered room to try and make sense of the jumble covering the worktops and table. John mused that the bin was probably the worst tool to take up in the battle between the Kitchen and Chemistry Lab that was underway in that room, as everything John could identify was quite expensive and in good condition.
He spends his leave time in Continuing Professional Development whenever he is back on his native soil, and not just in classes that will get him to his surgery fellowship. The classes and conferences weren't all work, not the way he saw them, anyway: there was always some group he could hook onto that took a trip to a cozy pub or a nice restaurant afterward, and the Captain was a personable sort. He'd made quite a few friendly and professional acquaintances over the years. That this method of staying busy at home kept Harriet from being drunk when she called or visited as much as she normally would have been is a double benefit. Even during those months where she is at her worst, she still has enough self-awareness not to embarrass the both of them in a place full of his fellow medical professionals - a good indicator she hadn't hit rock bottom as much as a statement on the power of a room full of well-pressed suits. He's lost track of how many times she's promised to stop drinking. He stopped believing her sometime after their father drank himself to death.
"A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you," he corrects himself automatically, grabbing the copy of the Times off the side table that she'd set down. He hears Mrs. Hudson turn abruptly and move back toward the door heading downstairs, wisely giving up on preparing tea amid the riot of Sherlock's chemistry equipment and letting John finish regaining his composure.
"We've identified the..." Lestrade spoke up.
"What do I think?" John parrots, having nothing to say that wouldn't sound like he was borderline necrophilic or extremely petty over Anderson's reaction.
"What about these suicides then, Sherlock? Thought that'd be right up your street. Been a third one now," Mrs. Hudson interrupts, walking over with a newspaper in hand.
At length, and refusing to abbreviate things absurdly as he knew was common, John sent Sherlock a text reading:
"You don't have long, though. Am I right?"
"Want to see some more?" He finally gets to the point.
"Vegetarian?"
"I'm not a betting man."
"The bullet they just dug out of my wall was from a handgun. A shot clean through the heart over that distance with that kind of a weapon? That's a crack shot you're looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hand couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he was acclimatized to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principles. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service, nerves of steel...." Sherlock trails off as he notices John hanging near the police tape. The man is standing against the wall of the building across the street from Speedy's. Rather than slouching down against the brickwork as would be expected of a relieved bystander his feet are planted firmly and his posture in parade rest like a soldier awaiting his next set of orders. His cane is nowhere in sight. Sherlock stands up quickly, pausing to let the head rush the sudden movement causes pass.
"I'm not on duty, an' I don't do drunks," the old man says with finality. Sherlock pretends to fully lose his balance and rolls along the side of the taxi until he is facing the rear of the vehicle. Reaching into his coat pocket, he takes out his phone and dials the victim's phone. He holds the phone to his ear as, inside the cab, another phone starts to ring.
"Didn't look like it."
"Of course I'm all right." And so he was, but that didn't quite fit with his personality as Sherlock understood it. He was a doctor - do no harm and all that.
"We will only need to wait fifteen minutes or so to send the text to ensure that it remains charged long enough to get to a proper stakeout location. I told you, we can set the time frame if we have to, though the exact wording needs to be perfect," Sherlock reworded what he'd said in the cab, which was tedious. Why was John being tedious all of the sudden? He pulled off his gloves to search out some nicotine patches from his pockets. Only two, which was suddenly a problem. Even just opening his eyes to get his coat and jacket off filled his head with garbage deductions from the state of the carpet. He managed the sit on the square little loveseat, though he could feel John's eyes on him as he fumbled off the wrapper of the first patch. Perhaps this was where it would go wrong? It always went wrong somehow, but he'd hoped he could at least get one whole case finished before John realized how unlikable Sherlock was and started teasing him.
"No, no not... I'm not. That. I'm not
"Right, let me get you sorted," Lestrade said. His demeanor shifted from mildly annoyed and distracted to the pinched sort of pity that John hated most. He'd hoped that the Detective would have been more professional than that. "I'll have a talk with him later about professional courtesy. It's never worked before, but repeating it..."
"Why have I got this blanket?" Sherlock asked the paramedic. The man turns away wordlessly, looking deeply harassed, which is unfair because he ought to be more invested in his job given its importance. He spots Lestrade walking up to him and changes focus. "They keep putting this blanket on me."
"Sorry, you're ...?" Lestrade asks John.
"Sherlock!" John shouted, pulling him out of his deductions.
"Where're you going?" Sherlock can hear Lestrade step forward to follow him.
"Two pills."
"It'll be a good few hours before I have a full charge, not to mention the travel time back and forth," John said, craning his neck to see the clock in the kitchen. "It'd be midnight, at least."
- accommodating. Yes, John was quite accommodating of Sherlock's scientific apparatus taking up much of the kitchen. His initial displeasure at finding out that all the clutter in 221B belonged to Sherlock had faded quickly. As soon as Sherlock demonstrated a willingness to make room in the parlor for his potential flat mate's things the former soldier visibly relaxed and went upstairs to examine the second bedroom, returning looking satisfied. Perhaps he wanted to display some memorabilia collected from his travels or just a photograph or two of his army mates in uniform. That would be an interesting addition to the aesthetic: a candid shot of fit men in uniform sweating in the sun, or perhaps a proper portrait of his unit in dress uniform from some function. -
"If they are on, if someone answers the call, if the target has the latest software on the phone itself, if there are at least three cellular towers in range of the phone that are also properly modern, then yes, they could narrow it down to a four to six-hundred meter radius. It is a far less reliable option than you might assume to track a cell phone by tracing a call, particularly if the phone is not answered. Those crime dramas in print or film are riddled with future tech and inaccuracies," Sherlock said with a dismissive huff, taking a few swallows of the now tepid tea. John said 'we,' lit fireplaces, made tea, and shared laughter with him: he could put that aside as a list to review later. "You have your phone?"
"I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent."
"Ah, some decorative thing that's a pain in the arse to clean?" John guessed. Not a bad guess, considering, but not accurate in the slightest. "I've got a fairly utilitarian white set." Then, after a pause and a glance at a shelf displaying some of the expensive gifts Sherlock has received from clients. "I say set, but I just mean I have enough to make a set. Picked them up here and there as I needed to, whatever was cheap since they were likely to break as I moved around."
"I know who you are, Mr. 'olmes. The moment you said your name, I knew. Sherlock 'olmes," the cabbie says, wandering around the room and messing with Sherlock's belongings. "I've been on your website loads of times. You are brilliant." Tiredly, Sherlock manages to turn his head to look at him. "You are. Proper genius." Sherlock's head slumps down onto his hand again. The man is properly nuts, uncaring of who he hurts and only desiring the feeling of power he gets toying with his victims before death. There isn't much leverage that works against men like that. The cabbie turns and walks back to the table.
"Mrs. Hudson left the kettle full and the cups and saucers out on a tray. You were too deep in thought to notice an air-raid siren, but I figured you kept the honey pot in the box of teabags for a reason," John answered with a shrug. "Couldn't find the rest of the service, but a shot glass does the job."
Drunk Sherlock and the thrilling climax!
"That doesn't sound clear enough for me to consider it consent," John said, releasing Sherlock's arms and backing away a step to emphasize the point. "Which is rather a shame considering I sorted out that I was a little bit bisexual while you were gone."
"He won't be your assistant."
"And is also not wasteful in the instance that I don't take milk," Sherlock said as he dumped the milk into his cup and pried the sticky lid off his small black and yellow striped honey pot. "The tea service is still packed, one of the boxes under the kitchen table I believe. Can't be certain, I never unpacked it at my last flat and everything got a bit of a shuffle."
"Where is it?" Lestrade asked when the door opened. While a visit from the D. I. wasn't abnormal, bringing Anderson and Donovan with him was.
"Ignore what I just said. It's the shock talking." Sherlock pulls the blanket tighter around his shoulders as he starts to walk towards John. "Probably need this blanket."
"But for this man, I'd have gone to prison."
"I know that it wouldn't be... It won't happen again," Sherlock said firmly.
Christmas was nicer than John thought it would be, given that both John and Sherlock's friendships had been heavily strained by the aftermath of Sherlock's 'hiatus' and return. Even with seven months of settling back in it wasn't the same as their previous Christmas parties. Molly was no longer infatuated with Sherlock, which triggered Sherlock to treat her much more like a respected colleague than a willing servant. John guessed that a fair amount of the residual distance Sherlock's time as a druggie had caused in his family had been worked out when Sherlock met with his parents to explain his faked death. Mr. Scott and Mrs. Violet Holmes had since made a habit of dropping in at least once a month, and they gossiped with Mrs. Hudson for most of the party. Greg was so glad for the drop in the number of unsolved crimes he brought some of his fine spirits to celebrate with. The D.I. managed to talk Mycroft into some sort of drinking game that ended with both of them being poured into a car by Mycroft's staff. John teased Sherlock's upcoming birthday surprise with his Christmas gift, wrapping some hazelnut chocolates atop a mystery box that he refused to put into context. The tall man spent most of the time after opening it distracted by the box full of oddly-shaped knitting, a torn-off section of a stained map, a snapped in half knitting needle, and a cheap cameo brooch John had found at a second-hand shop and intentionally damaged. The card read:
"That whole business with the two pills was shit," John said as they hobbled their way along. He was certainly swearing more than he had been, so his leg must really be bothering him. That or fatigue, but the returned limp pointed to physical discomfort. Between the late hour, John's bad leg, and the lethargy induced by Sherlock's full stomach they likely appeared to be a pair of drunks. "Utter shit with that ridiculous game."
Sherlock very rarely cooked, not for lack of ability (he was a chemist, of course he could mix exact amounts of ingredients together to produce a known result) but for lack of will. John did cook but lacked much ability, by which he really meant a lack of flexible recipes and the practice required to make up a meal on the fly out of what was to hand instead of making specific purchases. Purchases that didn't necessarily follow what was on special and invariably came in amounts that meant lots of unused perishable ingredients piling up until they rotted, which was troublesome when living on a tight budget. According to that definition, Sherlock also lacked the ability to cook, and said as much. It was no hardship to live on tins and take-out, not after having done it since he was sixteen, and John didn't seem to disagree.
"I would never dream of dragging you to a concert or movie without ensuring your interest beforehand," John confirmed. "Although seeing The Piano Guys and Lindsay Sterling next week has nothing to do with solving this."
"You should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I'm flattered by your interest, I'm really not looking for
"There's a good Chinese at the end of the road, stays open 'til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle."
"We don't know it's him," John points out.
"Sherlock Holmes and polite don't belong in the same sentence," Anderson chimed in from where he was blatantly eavesdropping while supervising his team just inside the doorway.
"You may as well eat. We might be waiting a long time," Sherlock says, voice flat.
The repeated interruptions upset Sherlock a bit, but he was immersed in the fictional crime again before long. When he realized that John had only specified that 221A and B were empty over the holidays in his opening narration, John handed over the key to the basement so that Sherlock could examine the 'victim's flat.' Once again second-hand dollhouse furnishings were in use, but that didn't seem to bother Sherlock in the slightest. In fact, he collected the lot and brought it upstairs to demand that John use the pieces to lay it out in proper scale with a few books for walls. Abbreviated interrogation transcripts were also in the basement flat for a family of women: A mother, and Aunt, and two daughters. John had made all the suspects female and related in an effort to make things a bit more confusing, as any gender- or family- specific clue would too quickly rule out a suspect otherwise.
"Breathing's boring," Sherlock said dismissively, sticking the first patch onto his forearm and wishing the drug into his body faster. John's hand settled on Sherlock's shoulder. The thin material of his green dress shirt and vest did nothing to inhibit the warmth of John's fingers, giving Sherlock's mind something tactile to focus on. It immediately stopped him from overloading. Untrusting of that sudden relief, Sherlock started unwrapping the second patch to correct the issue chemically. Habit ensured he hadn't rolled the sleeve up too far and exposed anything incriminating.
"The height of fashion for the woman who matches everything she wears," Sherlock quipped. "The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens, but forgot that her suitcase was in the car. Wouldn't have taken him long to realize, not more than five minutes. Then the killer - serial killer so male is most likely - has to dispose of this bright pink case somewhere, but couldn't be seen with it. Quite a notable sight, a man with something like this, and in that neighborhood? Twitching curtains all around. Little old ladies, I love little old ladies. Better than CCTV, but no one saw anything odd. Lestrade would have been all over it if they had. He had to find an alley big enough for a car so he could dump this as soon as possible."
"Fine," Sherlock said, launching himself out of his chair and taking his scarf off the back of the door of his new flat as he spoke, "we'll go together, use your phone to test a theory while it is plugged in, then you can bring the cable with you when we continue on. There will be a plug so that if you have further need of it as the evening progresses you will be able to use it." By the time Sherlock wrapped himself in his heavy wool coat and turned around, John had taken his own coat off the back of his chair and was ready to go. The smaller man wasn't putting an ounce of weight on the cane he held as they left the flat, which was something Sherlock would have to keep an eye on. He had a few theories about what sort of thing might cure John's limp and it would be extremely convenient if the doctor would be regularly useful and not just a live-in consultant.
"I know." He turns his head to glance over his shoulder at the flashing lights reflecting on the window pane. "I'm not blind."
The walk was quiet, but not uncomfortable. After a while, John takes his hand out of his jacket pocket and reaches down to take Sherlock's hand. That was good, and the buzzing thoughts in Sherlock's mind quiet as a large portion of his focus drifted to where John's fingers wrapped around Sherlock's palm. The shorter man was starting to feel the strain he'd put on the muscles in his leg by the time they reached the restaurant, but was doing an admirable job of ignoring it. John seems surprised and approving of the volume of food Sherlock orders without even looking at the menu. Not that anyone needs a menu for Chinese like this any more than one would need a menu at a sandwich shop. They all serve the same basic foods, after all. Sherlock is a bit disappointed when John adds his own meal to the order, and he has to re-wind his thoughts to realize he expected John to eat the food with him family-style. Surely some of the long list of items must have appealed to him. They sit down in a family-size booth to wait for the order. Sherlock manages to contain himself for a full one-hundred-and-eleven seconds before he breaks the companionable silence.
"A pink suitcase!" John exclaimed when he closed the distance enough that he didn't have to shout. A slight waver in his voice betrayed how close to chattering his teeth were.
"I propose an exemption for any incidental exchange of saliva caused by enthusiastic kissing," Sherlock squeaked out.
"Sherlock?" John calls down the stairs.
"Oh, er, bottom of the Thames," John answers quietly, looking sharply to the left in a move that showed both guilt and some level of deceit. It would take around fifty minutes to walk to the river from Baker Street, twenty-five or so running full-tilt or if he nicked a bike - and that wasn't including the return trip. No matter, as long as John didn't have the gun on him, and Sherlock was reasonably certain that he'd be able to spot it even with the lumpy jumper given that he'd seen John both with and without the firearm already today. If John disposed of it in a place he though he could retrieve it later that only meant it was more likely to be picked up by someone on the street. Either Sherlock could get it back from his contacts, or it would turn up at the Yard in relation to some other crime and John would have no connection to it or its new owner.
"That's not what people usually say," the man confirms unnecessarily.
"You wanna risk it?" The phone stops ringing. The cabbie nods down to the pills. "Wouldn't you rather risk this?" The phone beeps as it goes to voicemail. Sherlock looks down at the pills thoughtfully. "Which one do you think? Which one's the good pill?" Sherlock blinks, trying to drag his eyes away from the pills but finds himself unable to, too tempted by the challenge. "Come on. I know you've got a theory." Sherlock raises his gaze and the two men lock eyes. After a few seconds Sherlock looks down to the pills again and raises his hand, his fist clenched above the table for a moment before he extends his arm and points to the pill on the cabbie's left, the one which wasn't pushed across the table towards him. The cabbie looks at the pill with interest but his voice gives nothing away as he speaks.
"Which is also why it is white, you can get new all-white or mostly white items to replace the broken ones from just about any manufacturer easily and they will match well enough," Sherlock deduced, keeping his attention on his tea and watching John's reflection in a mirror that was not yet installed on the wall. Then he remembered his earlier misstep of not having obvious space set aside for John's things. "We will have to sort out what things we are and are not willing to consider part of communal space, though generally speaking anything functional in the kitchen or parlor would be shared with allowances for items of personal value we do not intended to use for their functional purpose." John was on the verge of laughing at him, so Sherlock shut up.
"Yes, kissing is fine," Sherlock immediately said, nervously clarifying "good, even. Preferable to not kissing, but not preferable to ending our understanding about the sleeping arrangements."
"Sometimes you don't get all the clues gift wrapped in one package," John countered. "In fact, you repeatedly describe cases where you do as boring and not worth leaving the flat."
He hadn't had his prescribed walk today. At least it wouldn't be the same boring route.
"Oh, yes, I got that for him," John said.
"We need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case." He looks around subtly as he speaks to make sure that nobody's in earshot.
"We'll have to mention it to Mrs. Hudson. She will claim it is a rare thing she's doing just the once, but any significant amount of time spent in her company will see you fed and watered on a regular basis whether or not you need it. It would be most unfortunate for her to offer up a Shepperd's Pie or some other homemade delicacy and have to navigate some form of polite refusal."
"Nowhere, invalided," John said, tucking his notes away to give his cane a waggle. "Rightfully, since I feel like someone's soaked my brain in molasses."
The men who detach from their surroundings don't last long. Those who put blinders on, who seem to ignore it all: those are the ones Captain Watson worries about, the ones who trigger the parts of his training aimed at spotting developing mental illnesses. Some of the medics coming in fresh from training often look to the 'workaholic' types like John, but there is a healthy and an unhealthy way to go about that sort of single-minded dedication. He'd seen enough of it, lived enough of it, that he could spot the difference. The older set agreed with him that this new-age rejection of machismo might work in some cases, but didn't apply as much to the sort of person who volunteered for military service. There was never a lack of work in the military, so it was the perfect place for a workaholic. They thrived like flowers in the sun. No, it was those who detached that got out quickly, either through some form of discharge or in a box. Detachment, as a coping mechanism, was the true danger.
Sherlock realized.
"Course, maybe God just loves me."
"It's genius. I know 'ow people think. I know 'ow people think I think. I can see it all, like a map in my 'ead." Sherlock turns his head away, exasperated. "Everyone's so stupid – even you." Sherlock looks back at the man sharply, but his head is still stuffed with the sort of drugs he has never enjoyed and he can't help feeling that he's missing something obvious. He drops his gaze too quickly, the clues he'd observed about the man's life floating uselessly in the murky soup filling his mind.
"Of course not. Playing for time," Sherlock lies easily.
"And then, together, we take our medicine," he says expectantly and licks his lips. "Let's play."
"Just this once, dear. I'm not your housekeeper," he registers her words, even says another something in reply that comes from his hazy stock of polite statements, but his attention is caught by a picture of the man that just came to fetch Sherlock on the front page. The headline and caption mention the recent set of serial suicides Mrs. Hudson was talking about. John thinks that someone had mentioned them to him last week sometime, or he'd overheard someone talking about it. Perhaps when he'd stopped into a coffee shop to rest his leg while out walking? Well, the man who fetched Sherlock is Detective Lestrade, and in charge of the investigation. John is just starting to read the article when he hears something behind him.
"'Cause you're an idiot," John says with such conviction it startles Sherlock silent for a moment. A smile slowly spreads across his face as Sherlock realizes that John understands him perfectly, so evasion is unnecessary.
"How do you know?"
"It is always the quiet ones," Anderson tutted as they followed John. Sherlock looked up at the noise and immediately protested.
Their first case, and getting to know each other. You've all watched the taxi scene a thousand times in re-watches of the show, YouTube clips, and fan videos by now so I'm skipping a few lines of dialogue to get right at the meat of what we came here for.
"Obvious?" Lestrade questions. If they work together often, shouldn't the Detective Inspector sound less incredulous?
"And a similar problem with men?" Sherlock asked slowly. He felt as if somewhere in his Mind Palace the rust was being knocked loose from some disused filing cabinet, the familiar feeling of a puzzle coming together now that all the pieces were available. He looked out the window awkwardly as he tried to figure out what it is that has been itching in the back of his mind for the last twenty-four hours. If he just had a little more time he could think it through properly, and he wished it would keep until the case was over, but he really needed to secure a flatmate as quickly as possible. John Watson was his best option. People generally took a couple weeks to sort out their old lease and get all the paperwork in order when attaining new premises, so even one more week of searching would likely put him past his deadline. More importantly, there was a good case on. He ought to be concentrating on that. Whatever it was that kept trying to derail his thoughts could surely wait, and in any case, it felt more like a positive than a negative. If it turned out that there was something that made the doctor impossible to live with, he could sort it out once the mystery had been solved and the first month's rent properly secured.
"They can trace phone calls, can't they? I mean if we give the number to the police, they could find the phone and we'd have another potential crime scene with more evidence to work with," John asked. Sherlock got momentarily hung up on the repeated use of the first-person plural in John's speech. When Lestrade used it, he meant the police force, usually his specific team, and did not intend to include Sherlock within those covered by the pronoun - most people meant it in that manner. 'We' always indicated a group that did not include Sherlock, sometimes with emphasis to ensure he understood the exclusion. Then, he fully processed the nonsense that John was suggesting.
"You said before you didn't know who the killer was but you knew what," John prompts.
"Out of my restaurant! Cretino! You're drunk!" Sherlock stumbles clumsily across the floor as Angelo bundles him toward the door, continuing to insult him in Italian and making a splendid scene until he shoves Sherlock out into the street. "And stay away!"
"Sorry," Sherlock said, backing away frantically. "That was... I didn't intend..."
Sherlock's next text chimed just as John sent the second line. John could easily imagine the awkward posture and faint blush from Sherlock's earlier tidying spree returning.
"Yes, actually. Very much up my street," is the slightly grumpy reply, though something catches his eye out the window and the taller man trails off, distracted.
"Don't be absurd," Sherlock scoffed, "most of it is clearly crochet. The only macramé on the skeleton itself is the distal phalanges."
"There's plenty of other cabs round 'ere. Get another cab."
"I ask 'cause you're very resilient. Most people would have passed out by now." Sherlock blinks, looking down at his arm. He had thought it was pinched against the window glass, but something about the sensation isn't right. He reels away from the cab as he sees a hypodermic needle hanging from the underside of his left upper arm. He shouts wordlessly in shock, flailing as he tries to reach towards it to take it out. As the drug begins to take effect Sherlock feels his legs fold under him. The cabbie gets out and reassures nearby passers-by who have stopped to watch what's going on. "It's okay. He's just had a few," the old man explains as he manhandles Sherlock. Sherlock tries to wave his arm towards where he'd seen John watching, but whatever he'd been given was strong. The world is swiftly getting too hazy to keep track of, and he tries to call for John.
John took another look around while the mess was being sorted through. Despite the outer door to the street specifying 221B, the foyer below was clearly shared between the flats A, B, and C. This flat used what was clearly an original main stairway, the bottom stair only a few steps from the outer door. Accessing the bath was a study in squeezing modern utilities into and carving modern apartments out of a building that wasn't originally designed for either. A solid door next to a window on the back of the building led into the tiled bathroom from a short hallway
"Bit of trouble too, I bet," Sherlock prods, and he's either stalling or intentionally being as dramatic and drawn out as possible.
"I've outlived four people. That's the most fun you can 'ave with an aneurysm," the cabbie says, leaning forward like he is sharing a secret. Outside in the street, a vehicle can be heard coming to a halt with a screech of brakes. The flashing lights of a police car come through the window. Sherlock's gaze flickers briefly to the window but then he turns his attention back to the cabbie.
Sherlock had his fists raised just in front of his chin in a joyful, twee little dance of delight by the end of John's narration. He took another very careful pass around the body dump site before delicately closing up the bag and flapping his hands impatiently at John until the doctor took up one end of the bag. The entire assembly was very carefully brought inside and laid on the sitting room floor with the box of clues John had given him for Christmas. John didn't want to help too much, but he did lay out his knitting needles, tweezers, a few re-purposed take-out containers, and fabric scissors while Sherlock was looking over the knit corpse with his magnifier.
"The term seems self-explanatory," Sherlock replied, finally relaxing a little. John dropped back down onto the sofa and patted the cushion next to him. He waited for Sherlock to sit down before elaborating.
"Look at him, dashing about! My husband was just the same," Mrs. Hudson giggles at Sherlock as he bounds out of the room, full of energy. "But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell." John just sighs and sinks into the chair. He can almost feel the haze coming back over him now that he doesn't have anything to focus directly on. It's ridiculous, he never needed to be... to be
"Good news for breathing."
"Oy! Who are you?" the elderly man asks.
"You keep saying 'suitcase'. There wasn't one," Lestrade explained.
"I'll get a candle for the table. It's more romantic," Angelo says to John after a bit more fussing. Sherlock is fairly certain it is said with a wink.
"Do you see what is missing?" Sherlock asked, pointing at the suitcase.
John didn't say so, but it was obvious from the way his eyes flicked over the plates and Sherlock's body that John was surprised at how much the skinny detective had eaten. It was true that it had been more than a day since Sherlock had had anything solid to eat, but short-term fasting was nothing new to him. The large meal was fairly standard at the end of a case, and discretely adjusting his belt to accommodate it was a practiced motion. He hoped that the doctor's interest in his eating habits wouldn't become troublesome. Before long they were both finished. There wasn't enough left to warrant a take-out box, and they started back towards the flat.
"I haven't heard back since we called in her ID," Lestrade said as he ushered John down the stairs. "It can take a couple hours even for a priority case, New Scotland Yard or not."
"I'm taking it out of your security deposit!" she shouts back at them. Giggling, John calls over his shoulder.
"You were gonna take the damned pill, weren't you?" John asks in a sudden change of subject.
"Oh, yeah. In the shoulder. Nasty infection, too, that spread to my femur and kept me in hospital for months." John heaved a sigh, clearly reluctant to say whatever it was he was about to explain. "Honestly, I will need the cane back. Today's been a good day, mobility wise, and sure some of it was psychosomatic, but that doesn't mean it was all in my head. If nothing else, I can see the atrophy when I compare the size of my thigh muscles. It has been half a year since I was shot, and all the PT in the world can't stop the damage when I've been limping the whole time." Sherlock quiets to process this, sorting out all the questions he wants to ask about that unusual medical complication and wondering if he should refresh his knowledge with some research before peppering John with questions about how an infection could travel from his left shoulder to his right leg without ravaging everything in between irreparably. They make it less than a dozen steps before Mrs. Hudson smacks him on the shoulder.
"What day is it?" Sherlock asks distractedly, his mind focused on scanning and categorizing the people walking past on the street.
"It's just that if she is, and a coat bright enough to be seen from space isn't necessarily good evidence, but if she is, then she should have something to record things on her. I had one fellow, some assistant to an intern or what have you that wasn't even a proper reporter yet, who tried to interview me about my job after he'd nearly had his finger severed in an argument about a woman." John had more trouble with his leg going down the stairs since he was focused more on wrangling his train of thought than where his cane was landing. Someone in a rush to get upstairs bumped into him hard and pitched him into the wobbly banister. Lestrade gave the other officer the evil eye on John's behalf, and the woman trailing after offered an apologetic nod to the short man.
"Well, she's from out of town, clearly. Planned to spend a single night in London before returning home. So far, so obvious," Sherlock declares almost as soon as they are in the room.
It was perhaps a bit unfair to give Sherlock a box of clues like that when it was only a tenth of the required information John expected him to need, but Sherlock still occasionally mentioned that he had been too obvious in his suicide note phone call and John should have deduced it was all a trick. Giving the man a taste of what it felt like to have the facts deliberately held back was only fair play, as it was in the note that the body wouldn't be in the garden until Sherlock's birthday. Still, John had to restrain himself as Sherlock first scoured their own back garden, and then went to every location in London he thought that John might describe as a garden looking for the body he'd been promised. The wait for January 6th gradually became more stressful as John would only respond to Sherlock's deductions with 'read the note again' no matter how close to the mark the excitable man was or wasn't.
"Maybe she checked into a hotel, left her case there," John thought out loud, though that sounded off as soon as he said it because....
"I know I've said this in the cab, but is this really the most efficient way to do this? Shouldn't we just call the police and get it done that way?" John asked. The repetition was tedious, but the comment was accompanied by swift action. Sherlock had barely crossed the threshold and John's now properly dead phone was plugged into the waiting charger by the desk.
"Captain Watson," John supplies absently, some important thought about the dead woman struggling to come together. Glancing back at his notes, his eyes fixed on Lestrade's unanswered question about the missing phone.
I don't care for the John Watson Moffat created, particularly in Series 3 and 4 but the signs are there from the beginning. When I think about Watson across interpretations, the Granada series is the classic I use as a touchstone. For more recent works: I feel that Jude Law was given a better script to work from for all that I think Martin Freeman did amazing work and I'd have loved to see him with that script because he clearly loves the character from the original stories. He starts great: both in A Study in Pink as it was aired and the Pilot, developing in The Blind Banker, and right through The Great Game with a few bad moments; however, the longer the series goes the more off the rails the characterization of the main characters gets. John gets angrier and angrier, always seeming to doubt Sherlock's intentions despite all his other incarnations knowing that while Holmes's methods are utilitarian the man behind the method cares deeply about justice. It's that trap in modern media where the stakes must always be raised higher and higher as things go along clashing with previous character development until we end up watching a mash-up of Saw and The Ring starring Sherlock's secret sister. John's character development suffers for that, and from a gas-lighting wife that only makes his PTSD and anger management issues worse.
"Two of them?" John asked, a doctor's concern with the edge of doubt. Did he think they were laced with something? Had Mycroft stuck his nose in already and warned John about the drugs? No, there would have been signs, and John might even have just told him directly if he'd had a clandestine meeting with the personification of the British Government.
"I understand, dear; I've got a hip," Mrs. Hudson forgives him gently and goes back into the kitchen.
There are a few different methods for staying sane in a warzone.
"You did get shot, though."
The hour and a half round trip was acceptably inefficient given the alternative scenarios. Had Sherlock lost John back in Brixton and needed to summon him from his gloomy little flat it likely would have taken even longer. Sherlock wouldn't have contacted him until after he'd fully formed the plan, would have then needed to devise a way to convince John to come back and implement that plan, and finally wait for the limping man to come to him. True, having John in the room was slightly distracting, but talking to him seemed to clarify things very easily so that was a wash. John also seemed to move much faster when Sherlock was leading him compared to the pained waddling around he'd managed at other times. The white noise of the cab rides was very good for brain work and John had generally left him to it.
"Anything on the menu, I cook it for you myself," Angelo said, setting down two menus with a flourish.
," John answers carefully, a brief pause giving himself as much time to think as was polite. Tense, Sherlock was tense, perhaps because people who look him up often find the mess William got into and ask uncomfortable questions?
"No, it's... it's fine," Sherlock answers as he stuffs his phone back in his pocket.
"...but performing an autopsy of a complete corpse in here is ridiculous. We'd never fit it on the kitchen table and doing it this way would ruin the floor!"
"Yes, well, collect your evidence and let's get inside where there is light and heat. I do have to tell you a few things before you get properly started. The body bag was a concession to keep any frost or rain off it in case the weather turned. I'd originally thought I'd just lay it out under a tarp, but the starch I used would fail fairly quickly if it got damp and that might damage some evidence or create red herrings. I figured the less explanation I'd have to give due to failures or limitations of the construction the better. Just delete it from the scene as best you can, or else imagine the corpse was bagged by some over-eager newbie on forensics before you arrived and then arranged exactly into its original position inside the bag. It is meant to have been found skinned and decomposed enough to cover the irregularities in some of the organ shapes. A proper autopsy will be required to find all the trace evidence, some of which is symbolic because knitting things smaller than a certain size is fucking brutal. The absence of all musculature is another concession to the construction method as I know that removing all traces of connective tissue would require boiling the bones and that has not happened. To that end, assume that nothing useful could have been found in or on the remaining muscle beyond confirmation that the body was originally left in this location. Also, assume that they exist in a state consistent with a skinning clean enough that it suggests a bit of culinary training at minimum, though the level of decomposition makes assessing the exact skill level of the killer impossible," John explained.
"How do you figure that?" John asked between sips of tea.
"She never made it to a hotel. Look at her hair! Color-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. A woman like that would never leave the hotel with her hair still looking that ..." Sherlock babbles out the same thing John's slower mind was just processing before suddenly stopping and going wide-eyed. "Oh. Oh!" Sherlock's face lights up and he scampers out of the room, tugging at the blue cover-alls as he goes. John instinctively follows, which is a developing habit he's going to have to assess later.
There was silence for five seconds as the two men locked eyes, each assessing the other's carefully blank expression, and then they dissolved into inappropriate giggles like a pair of teenagers. Sherlock was just getting himself under control when John made a couple gestures toward the retractable handle of the bright pink case set between them and squeaked out a few half syllables that Sherlock wasn't exactly certain how to fill in, but he was still able to glean the infantile humor suggested by holding on firmly to a pole on a moving train while holding one's own wood in the other hand and the possible arrest that would follow. They laughed even louder. Sherlock hadn't shared such easy laughter with someone else in years. It was wonderful.
While John kept his hands busy, Sherlock relaxed into the inadequate loveseat with his hands pressed together and turned his focus inward to play out a few different scenarios. A sudden chase through London's streets, the urgency and danger of catching a killer reminding John enough of his days as a soldier to command all of his attention, might get rid of his limp. Those happened often enough in Sherlock's line of work, and setting up a stakeout by laying bait for this killer was likely to result in optimal conditions for that occurrence. The only method of contacting the killer was the victim's cell phone, which made John essential. Well, he could have bothered Mrs. Hudson, but that might have brought her into the line of fire and she was unlikely to allow him to use her mobile for this purpose knowingly. John was a willing participant in the evening's events. 'Oh, God yes' was clear and enthusiastic consent.
Living in a bedsit in London, John can feel himself detaching. He is meant to be recovering from a gunshot wound to the shoulder, the rushed surgery that affected the nerves there, the osteomyelitis that got into his bruised femur, and an immune system so run-down by the lot that he'd caught the flu and two colds since he'd returned to London from the Middle East despite years of regular vaccinations and fairly sterile living arrangements for most of his recovery. Recovery is meant to include improvement and he certainly hasn't gotten much of that. The world around him is becoming blurrier in steady increments. He knows it is a bit not good. He knows that the time it took them to haul him off the battlefield contained some unmeasured period where his brain wasn't quite getting enough blood, and that was when the fog and the infection first got in. His left hand and sometimes his forearm tremble on bad days from the nerve damage, and his right leg steadfastly refuses to function reliably despite there not being anything obviously wrong with it mechanically speaking. That was a bit not good as well. He didn't blame Bill at all, he'd even had a coffee with the nurse he'd served alongside and thanked the man for saving his life. Bill had gotten married since, which was good for him. Getting on with life, having things happen to him was good. John wasn't getting any of that, either. The therapist meant to help him adjust to civilian life after signing up for an Army Medical Corps cadet program at age 16 with plans to stay there until he was ready for retirement is decidedly not helping. All of her suggestions sound like they are straight out of whatever trendy, new-age, metro-sexual theory those young idiots he didn't get on with were spouting. She's trying to get him to settle down into a nice, quiet life with nothing that could possibly trigger his PTSD and practically everything she says about the beige-soft life ahead of him makes suicide seem like the better option. He isn't sure how many mentally sound soldiers she's ever met, but he doubts they would crowd up his small room if they all came visiting. Trust issues, she writes down one day.
"Lay off the veteran, Donovan, you have a job to do," Lestrade prompts. John stands just on the other side of the crime scene tape and types as best he can on the slick screen. He felt fiercely jealous of the little keyboard he'd spotted on Sherlock's more utilitarian looking phone the entire time the other man was fiddling with it in the car. Why these i-Apple things were so popular and expensive when they were so badly designed was beyond his understanding. His laptop was just as bad. At least he'd used Microsoft computers before. He'd bought the silver Mac when he was still spending money as if he expected to heal up and ship out soon and needed a computer of his own to keep up with email correspondence while in hospital. They sold him some cock and bull about Apples being simpler to learn, having the phone and computer match being important for some technical reason, and that it would make both easier to use if they matched. Fucking dishonest salespeople, he should have just gotten the Thinkpad. At least then he'd be able to call up some of his old Army buddies for help getting it set up instead of standing around waiting for a ridiculously twee 'Genius' for half a day while still in a wheelchair.
"Yes, well, this is more fun." Sherlock smiles down at him, which is a bit out of place at a murder scene.
"Oh. I was assuming you'd taken it away," Sherlock replied, looking around the room reflexively to confirm.
"So are you."
got him a corpse?" Greg asked.
"Myc set you up?" Lestrade echoes, and Donovan says something quietly in the detective's ear just beyond John's hearing. John ignores their mumbling and speaks over them.
"If you wouldn't mind." Instantly Angelo leans forward, seizes Sherlock by the scruff with one hand and his arm in the other and drags him out of his chair.
"Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don't get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, judging by the spread. A case that size, woman this clothes conscious: could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying the night."
"Maybe he beat you."
"Did you choose the right pill?" Lestrade asks, his eyes staring at Sherlock as if he could drive home some unspoken point by force of will.
"Appreciation. At long last the spotlight. To you it's an arrest; to them it's a coming-out party. That's the frailty of genius: it needs an audience."
"This one's stopped," Sherlock says, nodding toward the mirror.
Sherlock staggers around on the pavement as if he is drunk and trying to get his balance. He totters to the curb and almost falls down it before stumbling out into the road, causing a car to slam on its brakes to avoid hitting him. The driver blares his horn as Sherlock holds out his hands apologetically. Holding his fist to his mouth as if trying not to vomit, Sherlock continues his drunken walk down the street. Reaching the driver's window, he raps on the glass with both hands as if drumming a beat. The driver inside, a much older man estranged from his wife wearing well-worn clothing, shakes his head.
"Well, yes."
"Now, now. The drug's still in your system. You'll be weak as a kitten for at least an hour," the old cabbie sayas, walking over to loom over Sherlock as he tries to right himself. "I could do anything I wanted to you right now, Mr. 'olmes. Anything at all." Whimpering from the effort of fighting the drug, visceral horror from memories of the darkest days of his drug use looming unhelpfully in his mind,  Sherlock manages to get up onto his knees and elbows. "But don't worry. I'm only gonna kill yer." Suddenly, he grabs Sherlock around the waist and hauls him to his feet before dragging him a few paces across the room and dumping him onto a wooden desk chair. The small wooden desk has another chair on the other side of it, a partner's desk he'd taken as payment after a simple inheritance-related case for when his clients have documents they want to review with him. Sherlock slumps forward onto the wood before he slowly manages to sit up. He thinks of Mrs. Hudson and turns to reach vaguely towards the door behind him, mostly on instinct. The cabbie walks around the table towards the other chair.
"So, we're bringing in another psychopath to help?" is Anderson's snappy reply.
"No, you weren't. It's how you get your kicks, isn't it? Risking your life to prove you're clever," John says, seeing through Sherlock's still slightly tipsy denial.
Sherlock's point of view on the way back to 221B and thoughts on John.
"Oy! Sherlock!" Rolling his eyes, Sherlock stops and turns to Lestrade as he walks over. "Still got questions for you."
"Dear God. What's it like inside your funny little brains? It must be so boring," Sherlock complains, then launches into another explanation while poking his phone. "Her coat: slightly damp. She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London until the last few minutes. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it's dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind – too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so she must have come a decent distance but she can't have traveled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff." As he finishes speaking, Sherlock turns his phone to face Lestrade. John can't see it from here, but looking up the weather is such a simple thing that for a moment he can't see why they hadn't done so themselves.
"Anderson won't work with me."
"People do their best thinking
"Because they were all poisoned."
"Dinner?" Sherlock suggests, gesturing down the street.
and John is shocked at the late hour when he finally stops reading to use the toilet. There is something about a drugged-out son of a lesser blue-blood family getting in a bit of trouble a few years back in the search results as well, but that is a William Sherlock Scott Holmes and so John dismisses it. As a common man with the uncommon middle name Hamish, John knows how some odd old family names can get passed around out of tradition even well after any high-society connection has been watered down to nothing. William could be Sherlock's long lost cousin, and this Sherlock didn't seem the type to blunt his senses with drugs. Not with the way he flaunted his brainpower and observational skill on his website.
Thankfully, none of that is necessary in the universe created by the Very Gay Pilot Episode. Clearly, the version of the characters in that universe did not need two bedrooms for long.
"What if I refuse to play?" Sherlock asks.
"You have just killed a man," Sherlock prompted.
"Oh, because we're stupid," John answers. His expression is sufficiently deadpan that Sherlock can't tell if he has genuinely taken offense or is just teasing. Sherlock bites his lip as John casually takes another bite of his meal. Perhaps he should have taken advantage of the implied invitation to share the food. The longer they wait the less likely it is that the killer has taken the bait, and while the chance of catching the killer dwindles so too does Sherlock's ability to block out the irritating demands of his transport. A few nibbles would not necessarily slow him down, though sometimes a small snack only serves to give his body the energy to demand a full meal.
"I see what you're saying," John starts, slowly. Sherlock fidgets in his seat expectantly, waiting for John's guess. He doesn't seem at all sure, and looks down to poke at his pasta before looking up and admitting, "No I don't. What are you saying: that the killer's got an invisible car?"
"It's not a game. It's chance."
"Gas, thankfully, the electric ones are no better than decorative hotplates." Sherlock wasn't sure why he was still talking. "Wood-burning would be my personal preference, but that is obviously impossible to manage in Westminster."
John supposes there are a lot of ways to stay sane while outside a warzone, but he's spent so little of his life there he simply doesn't know what they are or how to go about learning them. God knows he didn't have decent role models for a healthy civilian life before he dove head-first into the military lifestyle. Six months into his new civilian life, three months after the Army officially gave up on him recovering enough to be useful, one month after his last overnight stay in a hospital bed, he is on one of his therapist-prescribed recreational walks - a task he completes with the air of a man ripping off a particularly stubborn plaster from a particularly delicate bit of skin. Mike Stanford recognizes him as he passes a bench outside Bart's. John has the same reaction he has had whenever anyone who used to know Captain Watson spots him with his cane. He hates his weakness, and hates them for seeing it on display, and pushes all that unpleasantness down because he has always been professional and polite unless there was great cause to be otherwise. Changing that, too, would just be another defeat. Swallowing it all down, the world goes a little fuzzier, a little grayer, and he is barely aware of what he is talking about.
"He had fish and chips from that shop you hate just before death," Sherlock answered deliberately vaguely, pointing in the necessary direction so that only John would understand which one he meant before picking up a tiny plastic fish with a pair of tweezers. "These are anchovies, not cod, and you always complain that the fish there stinks like old anchovies when I use it as a stakeout location." John nodded to confirm that this was a deliberate choice and not symbolic of fish in general - or rather that he'd worked the detail to his advantage after looking at his limited options for tiny plastic foodstuffs among the more realistic dollhouse accessories he'd found. Sherlock pointed at the most obvious clue, which was the carefully folded respiratory system next to him that had been partially stuffed with red ribbon to indicate inhaled blood. "He was killed using a knitting needle, plunged into his neck repeatedly until it broke, damaging the wind pipe and piercing the esophagus. The killer attempted to remove any lingering forensic evidence by skinning the victim. There was no skin and only a little bit of blood found at the scene..." Sherlock explained, holding up the box John gave him for Christmas full of 'blood splatter' and 'hair samples.'
"And you know which is which," Sherlock adds quickly.
The bell rang two hours later. Sherlock didn't so much as glance away from the fluffy knitted entrails he was carefully picking through, so John hurried down to see what was going on.
"Did anyone see it? Where did it come from? Who is firing? Who is firing?" Sherlock looks across the road to the buildings opposite. Most of them are in darkness but one room is well lit, and the sash window is slightly open. "Clear the area! Clear the area now!" Sherlock turns back and looks again at the dead cabbie, then turns and looks across to the open window opposite. Moving as quickly as he can, he chucks his keys out the smashed window and looks down as pandemonium continues down in the street below, panting slightly as reality re-asserts itself and his brain finally kicks out the deduction that had been trying to form through the drugged haze. This game was rigged. This wasn't the same as when the cabbie killed the others: this time it was meant to be a murder-suicide. One of the officers scoops up his keys and shouts, pointing up at him. He slumps down, first leaning on the window frame and then crunching onto the floor amid the glass, closing his eyes.
"Good god," John said, breathless from laughter but sobering rapidly, "Harry's going to try and drag me out for that."
"God, yes!" John gasps out like a prayer. Sherlock spins on his heel and John is already following him at a decent speed out the door and into a waiting cab.
"I suppose it is a long shot. We have to be realistic," Sherlock admits, realizing that he'd started drumming his fingers on the table. His visible impatience likely prompted the renewed conversation so he straightens up in his chair.
If you got down to root causes, then really Sherlock's wandering focus was all his brother's fault. Mycroft had been quite irritating all month. If Sherlock wanted to be completely honest with himself, and he tried to be so that he could sort things properly in his Mind Palace unless he had a very good reason to misfile something, his elder brother was not inventing problems to solve. He was overreacting, rather severely in Sherlock's opinion, but there was a little bit to fuss about. Sherlock's previous accommodation had been horrible. The place was run down, infested with vermin and mold that occasionally contaminated his experiments, and built primarily out of paper maché given its structural integrity. It was the fourth flat Sherlock had rented in a year, and he'd been tossed out after the scent of sulfur from one of his experiments disturbed the other tenants. In a fit of anger at being called on the smell when the woman next door filled the hall with a perfume of ripe diapers and boiled cabbage on a far more frequent basis, he'd let loose with the evidence that half of them were breaking laws. He'd intended to use the blackmail on the landlord to keep his place of residence. Instead, the police came in to mop up the criminals after one of the relatively law-abiding neighbors called 999. The arrest ensured Sherlock had a week to vacate instead of being tossed out on his ear the same day in a careless flaunting of tenant protection laws. How anyone living there could have not noticed that the basement had a grow room full of cannabis he'd never understand.
"You got me a corpse." It was perhaps a bit abnormal to say those words in that tone of voice, but at least John knew Sherlock was appreciative. The overlarge child raced out into the back garden to claim his new toy in his pajamas and dressing gown. John bundled up quickly and followed with Sherlock's coat and slippers in hand, muttering to himself about how cooperative the weather was being for once. He was under no illusions that any amount of rain or cold would have altered Sherlock's behavior at all. Sherlock was crouched down muttering to himself as he examined the body in the garden when John reached him.
"Yes; and I can read your military career by your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits by your mobile phone," Sherlock fires back.
"Why would I do that?"
"I 'ope you don't mind. Well, you gave me your address," the voice of the cabbie drifts over his shoulder. Sherlock heaves himself out of the chair, fighting for equilibrium and nearly losing the battle as the older man continues. "You've only been out for about ten minutes. You're strong. I'm impressed." Sherlock manages to stand reasonably straight, holding his head up by propping his elbows on the mantel. " That's right – you warm yourself up. I made everything nice and cozy for you."
"I'm left-handed, never touched the body with my right hand, did I, Detective Lestrade?"
It is only after he has gotten back to the horrible little room he's been put away in that his mind completely catches up to the events of the day. He fires up his laptop and plugs the man's name into a search engine. It is distinctive enough that John figures there aren't likely to be many hits, and he is right. The top result is a website titled
John had decided that he would tell Sherlock about his new hobby with the most dramatic reveal he could think of, and to that end he started making Sherlock a birthday present. He kept it in a box in Mrs. Hudson's sitting room so that it wouldn't be discovered accidentally. He had almost thrown it out after Sherlock jumped off Bart’s roof, but Mrs. Hudson had asked to keep the unfinished project when John went to clean it out for sentimental reasons as it had been complete enough for her standards.
John, dazed, has a conversation with Lestrade on his way out, then does the obvious thing and texts Sherlock.
"Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake," Sherlock crows happily. The lanky man rushes off, freeing himself from the blue coveralls just as he reaches the ground floor and out of sight, absently calling to them over his shoulder: "Back in a moment!"
"Thank you." John's manners are impeccable. They turn and walk away, Sherlock smiling proudly at his new roommate as John blows out a relieved breath. Sherlock takes the blanket from around his shoulders and tosses it into a police car as he passes it.
"Anyone who didn't know where they were going, 'cause they were drunk or lost or new in town," he chuckles. "Anyone I could walk through the wrong door."
"After six am and breakfast, if you still want me to," John promised as long limbs wrapped around him securely. They were both asleep moments later.
"Obvious, isn't it?"
"Her mobile," John answered immediately. Sherlock twitched to look directly at John, surprised. The soldier tapped his notebook against his knee. "I've had a few minutes to review things."
"Wait, back up a moment. Just to be clear: you're fine with kissing me?" John asked, military firmness demanding a simple answer.
"Especially as that's the police," he says with some relief.
Unfortunately, the second bedroom being up another flight of stairs was a bit of an issue that would need ironing out since Sherlock seemed intent on taking this one. The high ceilings in the Victorian-era building were a great contrast to the closed-in little box John had been living out of since his release from hospital, but seventeen steps per floor was asking a lot of his leg on a bad day. John climbed up to the other bedroom to know what sort of argument he'd have to construct. The stairs terminated at a landing with only one door, though from the way the landing was shaped there used to be another door at some point in history that had been blocked off. The upstairs bedroom was painted a soothing blue, had its own toilet attached (the location of which explained why the landing looked like it did,) and was a fair bit larger than the downstairs bedroom. A bit spacious for the heart of London in general, even. It had slightly mismatched furniture just like the rest of the flat: a double bed, two nightstands: one modern glass and steel and one weathered oak, an Austin Powers inspired dressing table, and a large more modern-looking storage cabinet that might have come from Ikea. It also sported a rather solid old wooden desk against one wall that the other bedroom didn't have. The closet was behind a narrow door and barely deep enough for a hanger to fit. John had a strong feeling that explained Sherlock's preference for the smaller room more than anything else. John honestly would have preferred this room if it wasn't for his leg, as it had a nice view of the back garden and the privacy of his own toilet and sink was a serious bonus. Then again, half the rent - even reduced - of a two bedroom one and a half bath flat this size might be more than John could afford, rendering the question moot.
"I've been thinking about that fireplace longingly for the last few blocks," John said. He had a sheepish tilt to his head and fiddled with the handle of his cane. "Is it a gas conversion or electric?"
"So what d'you think? Shall we?" Sherlock sinks back into the chair. His focus is entirely on the man in front of him. "Really, what do you think? Can you beat me?" Sherlock blinks several times, his head still swimming a little, but reasonably certain of the bluff. He lowers his gaze and picks up the pill in front of him. Both men prop their elbow on the table, holding their pill a few inches from their mouth. "I bet you get bored, don't you? A man like you, so clever. I'll bet you're not bored now." Sherlock's gaze drops to the pill in his hand and he begins to breathe heavily in anticipation. It is a thrill, and the adrenaline has cut through the haze in his head. This is the right one, he's smarter than this man - he's caught this man. He beat him once tonight and he can do it again. "This ... this right now – this is what you live for, innit, not being bored?" Sherlock continues to breathe heavily, his gaze locked on the pill. Slowly he begins to move the pill closer to his mouth. The cabbie matches the movement with his own pill, his eyes fixed on Sherlock who opens his mouth as the pill gets nearer.
"Agreed."
"Night, Mrs. Hudson!" Grinning like schoolboys, they continue down the road as Mrs. Hudson turns to argue her way into her house.
"He's gone," she calls over to the pair of them when the officer in the car jolts at the sight of the DI and redirects Donovan's attention.
"You risked your life four times just to kill strangers," Sherlock says with a frown. "You're dying, aren't you?" The cabbie's eyes flicker but he manages to hold Sherlock's gaze.)
"There's a good pill and a bad pill. You take the good pill, you live; take the bad pill, you die."
"This is my flat," he says weakly. Obvious, dull, but it should buy a bit of time talking while his head clears up.
"That about sums it up, yeah. Anyway, I wasn't happy being strictly veggie. I like seafood, and I also eat animal products like eggs and milk. Just no land animal meat, full stop." John suddenly twitched a bit and hurried to add on. "Oh, and no, I don't mind it being in the same fridge or smelling it cooking or anything like that. A label on anything not obvious, like soup or sauce made with chicken stock, would be appreciated." Their conversation was briefly interrupted by their number being called, and they went up to collect the trays of food from the counter. After a few moments arraigning the plates so that anything John wouldn't want to touch was on Sherlock's side of the table and the sharable items were nearer the middle, Sherlock continued.
"Oh." Lestrade goes quiet after that. Sergeant Donovan is still outside, now leaning against a patrol car chatting with the officer inside. John can see the fresh-faced man smiling at her gamely. Well, every division had a bicycle - ready and waiting to take a ride around the block. Once upon a time John resembled that remark, though he never let it distract him while on duty like this.
"Half of London is passing by. How will you know who he is?"
"She had a handbag. Why'd you say she had a case?" Lestrade asked.
"Fun? There's a woman lying dead," John says with a twitch of his right hand on his cane. He still hasn't gotten used to only having one free hand thanks to the stupid thing, and come to think of it he shouldn't transfer anything to or from the handle and will have to do his examination one-handed even after getting down on the floor. Sherlock's eyes dart to the movement before settling back on John's face. He sounds a little disappointed when he replies.
"Who do you think you are?"
What the landlady was attempting by requesting John's help setting up for her knitting circle wasn't subtle. She knew that the intermittent tremor in his dominant hand was neither gone nor fading as quickly as John wanted it to and how much he upset himself when he fumbled things. John ended up going down to help them wind and detangle skeins a couple more times before they fully convinced him to keep his hands busy with something constructive while watching crap daytime telly with his landlady on days when he was idle.
"'S my birthday," he mumbled half asleep, "y've got t'tell me."
"You've gotta admit: as serial killers go, I'm verging on nice! Anyway, time's up. Choose."
"This is Angelo. Three years ago I successfully proved to Inspector Lestrade that at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, Angelo was in a completely different part of town, carjacking," Sherlock introduced the excitable Italian as the man shook him in a one-armed hug.
"Hey, hey! Come on!" Sherlock slurs in his false drunkenness, drawing out the last word. After a moment the window rolls down halfway.
"Do you know you do that out loud?" Sherlock asked, which popped John's head up from looking at the notebook.
"He has killed four people. Still, he'll pass by a couple times looking for the loose end, might even loiter."
"So, no internal exchange of bodily fluids until further notice. Is that good enough to start or is there something else you want to be sure of before you can relax?"
"Don't look it, do I? Funny little man, drives a cab. But you'll know better in a minute. Chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know," the cabbie says smugly. Sherlock finally gets his head up and glares up at the man.
"Oh. Interesting." He reaches out and slides the left-hand pill across the table while pulling the right-hand one back towards himself. Releasing the left-hand one, he picks up the other pill and looks at Sherlock.
"And then?"
He might be able to convince Mrs. Hudson to take half the rent as a check from his business account and agree not to cash it until he'd gotten a well-paying case or two, but he doubted it. She might adore him, but she was already giving him a discount on the rent and there was only so much she could bend without incurring her own financial difficulties. The flat had been vacant for a few months already thanks to her late husband's reputation, the moldy state of the C flat in the basement, and the fallout after the rather nasty removal of the previous tenants. She was unlikely to evict Sherlock immediately, but she would likely come to the same solution Mycroft threatened him with and procure a tenant for the second floor without his input. Since the second floor was not fully equipped, the majority of the upper floors belonging to Mrs. Turner's 223 ever since the building was cut up into smaller sections from a single estate well over a hundred years ago, whoever lived upstairs would have to share Sherlock's kitchen and bath. With no door between the kitchen and parlor, they would also frequent the space Sherlock expected to host his clients in. Finding his own flatmate, someone he could stand well enough to ignore their presence at minimum until his business picked up again, was a far better option than having someone randomly answer Mrs. Hudson's advert or arrive on Mycroft's orders and payroll as a babysitter.
"Quite right," Sherlock says softly, smiling down at this surprising man. A soldier first, then, and quite deadly indeed. The world should be glad John Watson had such a strong moral compass.
"Who's on forensics?" Sherlock asks.
"Yes?" Sherlock responded hesitantly.
"Oh, do as he says. Help yourself," Lestrade bites off before stepping back and leaning out the door to tell the forensics team to wait their turn.
"Five completely different people. They had no friends in common, and another thing I mentioned earlier: Lauriston Gardens. Twitching curtains all around. Little old ladies, they are my favorite. Better than any security cameras, but according to the police, no one remembers a strange car parked outside an empty building. Not one person remembered even though someone must have seen." Sherlock leaned forward, watching the crease between John's eyes deepen in thought.
"But what, Sherlock?" Sherlock looked down at John nervously for a few seconds and clearly was not going to answer. "Right, so, really boring people with vanilla relationships that stay boring until they die can skip this sometimes, and most people build up to it after a bit of snogging at least, but I think maybe we start with it since we've managed to misunderstand each other so badly. Are you familiar with the term affirmative consent?"
John Watson was a respectable British gentleman, or at least he tried his best and apologized when his temper required him to spew profanity at everything in the vicinity. To that end, he felt rather poorly when Mrs. Hudson did too much cleaning up in 221B. Sure, Sherlock wasn't exactly tidy, but there was a difference between cluttered and messy. The detective really did know proper lab procedures for containing the experiments he ran and usually cleaned up any accidental spills when they happened lest they contaminate his workspace. He also used and reorganized the files, notebooks, and knickknacks that were strewn about the sitting room often enough that they weren't ever that dusty. When it came down to actual filth John could be just as lazy as Sherlock about leaving used cups and plates behind when they had a case on and were dashing in and out of the flat for a shower, nap, or change of clothes. As for getting the hoovering done, washing the curtains, dusting the higher shelves, and other chores, John wasn't any more likely to spontaneously do a deep cleaning than Sherlock was and both of them had a rather high tolerance for what constituted a filthy room. Mrs. Hudson, on the other hand, had a rather low tolerance. While Mrs. Hudson might protest that she wasn't their housekeeper on a regular basis, she still brought up ready to eat food, cleaned up behind them while they were out, and even picked up some groceries from time to time to stock the fridge. It was nice, and John was rather protective of the elderly woman due to the real care she showed them.
"I'm not on duty, mate. You see the light?" The cabbie says a bit irritably, pointing up to the roof.
"What? What did ... what did you say?" Spinning around, Sherlock swiftly grabs at the cabbie's jacket with both hands to ensure he can't drive off.
"Okay, I'll pull you in tomorrow. Off you go." Lestrade sighs, the flicker of embarrassment flashing across his face as he finally recognized John and dove into a way out of having to admit he'd forgotten the smaller man existed amusing Sherlock further.
"Four people in a row? It's not chance."
"Less than an hour," Sherlock echoes, before suddenly launching into rambling motion again, "An hour! News blackout - can you do that? Don't say that you've found her; nothing for a day."
"Sergeant Donovan's been explaining everything to me. It's ... the two pills? Dreadful business. Dreadful," John says when Sherlock comes up to the police tape. John's attempt at appearing innocent is the truly dreadful performance of the evening. The man couldn't possibly be less convincing, and there will still be powder on his hands. He is obviously unused to deception of any kind. John pushes off the wall and steps up to the police tape, without a limp.
"Do you know her occupation?" John interrupted before he could get distracted again. "You had her name, Jennifer Wilson, but do you actually know if she is in the media or not?"
"Afghanistan," John cuts the detective off when the misunderstanding registers, "Army, not police. Signed up when I was sixteen as a cadet and became a surgeon. Don't really know what I'm doing with myself yet, now that that's gone. I don't think I'd have thought of forensics on my own. I was set up to work at a surgery handing out band-aids by the people assisting my discharge, and become a proper GP after some re-training. I guess... Well, I hadn't thought I had much choice, but then a friend of mine tossed me in Sherlock's path."
Then, Sherlock turned up at John's clinic looking rather worse for wear but very much alive. In what passed for an emotional fit for a Holmes, the dark-haired man proceeded to deduce absolutely everything John had been through in the last two years including the fact that John was currently dating a retired assassin, with commentary on what he should have done or what Sherlock would have done in response to any perceived idiocy. That resulted in a black eye for Sherlock and a rather public break-up for John, and within a week the two men were back at Baker street trying to remember how to live together. Mrs. Hudson brought out the project box when John inevitably came down to visit her, and the work resumed. His plans became somewhat more elaborate than the gag gift the project had started out as, and he spent a fair amount of time working out the details.
"Ah, no pork for me," Sherlock offers in exchange. John's brow furrows, and his next question is so hesitant that he clearly realizes that Sherlock must be an Atheist, as most scientists truly were no matter what level of respect they chose to give to their family traditions.
"Highly unlikely to travel so far for such a short trip of that nature, particularly when you consider the print-out confirming her hotel reservation. Hardly the sort of place a woman like that would choose for R&R and even if that was the limit of her budget there are much better options closer to Cardiff. Also, why bring a power suit on a pleasure trip? No, she came to London for work and dropped the phone somewhere. She's clever, too, wouldn't have dropped it accidentally. That phone was her life and livelihood."
"Take a moment," the man says like he's setting up a side-show at a circus. Sherlock sighs, utterly disgusted by the ridiculous showmanship. "Get yourself together. I want your best game."
"Don't you want to keep your eyes on it?" John asked. Sherlock pointed at a large and quite obvious mirror hung on a pillar not far behind John and answered irritably.
"Yes, of course, I mentioned it before. No phone in her handbag or suitcase, but a number on the luggage tag. What use is putting a land line on a luggage tag? None. So, she was traveling with a phone and no longer has it," Sherlock rapidly explained.
"Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? Or a triple-bluff?"
"Water is fine, just a small glass. We had tea not long ago," Sherlock answered. He wouldn't normally give the explanation, but if he was going to live with John, he would need to set a strong precedent or waste untold amounts of time fending off the doctor's reflexive caretaking.
