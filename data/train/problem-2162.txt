“They are a delicious pair, Louis.” There was a satin tone in the voice of his maker, as Lestat stepped towards his raven-haired fledgling. The tone bore admiration and a hint of a predatory purr, of which Louis was not quite sure was directed at him or for the two young men.
Momentarily lost in the visceral memory of the man, John didn’t resist as he felt Sherlock’s hands grip his hips and shift them so that it was John pressed into the wall beside the door instead. He leaned against the wall, using it as a support and once more looked up into his friend's eyes. He wanted to kiss the taller man, wanted to run his hands along his soft, firm skin. He wanted so much from this man.
"Do you honestly think she will return if she doesn't want to be found?" John countered, giving a skeptical lift of his brows.
Being the dear that she was Mrs. Hudson had heard the raucous calling and was soon toddling up the stairs with a freshly brewed cup.  She was nattering away, something ridiculous about the break-in’s on the news, and she set the warm flowered mug down on the kitchen table beside his microscope without stopping to expect a response from him.  Sherlock pretended to be intensely busy concentrating on the half readied slide shoved under the light at the sound of her approach and she in turn continued yammering in her melodic lilting way as she swept from room to room, tidying and straightening what he had left undone.
Caramel eyes took their time reading the days paper as David sat in the quiet café. The few other patrons were quietly enjoying their own reading materials or chatting politely amidst the low methodic sounds of remixed classical that pumped through the wall mounted speakers. His long-time home was in the midst of a huge change for the nation to which he found great distaste in the whole concept. Finishing his article he folded the paper neatly and shook his head, setting it on the table in front of his chair. Despite his choice to no longer mettle in the mortal world, he was still a part of it and like all creatures who hoped to survive within it, he needed to be aware of the environment in which he was living.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning slightly away from the touch, as he admitted, "I was hit by one of the deflected projectiles, but it is of no consequence."
“She was unaware.” David replied, with a shake of his head, “With how this is affecting the organization I am surprised that she had as much information as she did.  This would be leagues above her standing.”  The vampire paused, both of them deep in thought, before he resumed, adding, “She was able to release the name of an individual that she believes is linked to the rebel faction.  I do not see as there is a clear link to this Moriarty but we have nothing else to go on.”
Lestat’s hands rubbed together in delight as the young woman confirmed what he suspected.  John had gotten a message out and Lestat knew exactly where he was.
Lestat cared not to hide the body in the usual fashion of the immortal blood drinkers, he wasn’t in the mood.  Instead he grabbed the woman’s lifeless form and tossed it into the nearest bush, leaving her for her wayward lover to find perhaps.  Someone undoubtedly would, at any rate, and so he left her and carried on his route, at the same leisurely pace.
A vampire sauntered at a slow pace over the roof tops of the old buildings scrunched into rows aside the length of the still blackness of Regent Park.  The soles of his leather shoes made no noise above the thrum of the ever active metropolis that London was and had been for centuries.  No one could see his immortal prowess here, so high and removed from the mortal world that was continuously moving blithely onward without any notion that a predator stalked within the shadows.  Lestat was hungry and bored, an irritable combination.
John enjoyed this very much--pulling one over on the detective. It was a low blow, seeing the detective considered pop-culture unsuitable for his own retention, but there were very few places where he could get anything in on the man. He chuckled at the man's comically scrunched face, as he attempted to search his hard drive for a hit, and casually explained, "Just hit me, genius, with your best theory. How did Moriarty get this power?” he reiterated.
Louis’ fingers grasped the tiny china cup, needing an object to fidget with.  It wasn’t that he was nervous, he was the exact opposite in fact.  He found the elderly woman’s attentions and mannerisms oddly calming and familiar, as though his dream of mingling perfectly amongst the mortals were a distinct reality here within the confines of this woman’s kitchen.  He fiddled with the cup out of habit, as all immortals learned to do to blend in.  They certainly could not drink the contents within the cups but most mortals never noticed.
He waved flippant hand dismissively at her, spouting acridly, “It’s just a flesh wound, Mrs. Hudson, nothing more.  I’m sure you’ve seen worse in your Florida days, hmmm?”  Sherlock turned his eyes back to the microscope, focusing on the slide slid crookedly onto the stage.
The last word was punctuated by a thunderous explosion that rocked the entire hotel. Dust, flying debris, and rubble formed a melee of confusion. It blinded John, pelting his near naked form with wood and mortar shrapnel. As the smoke thinned it revealed a massive hole that had been blown through the outer wall of the small room.  He didn’t need to see the entirety of the room to know that his maker and the detective were gone.
The vampire looked down at the gift and then the plastic was popped and sweet tangy human blood was filling his mouth. John moaned in appreciation, as the nausea receded, and the thirst slowly dissipated to a dull ache in the put of his stomach. He finished them off, one by one, growing less enthusiastic as he went through them. As his hunger was pushed down his mind began to wonder just where the packets had come from.
The whites of John’s eyes showed brightly as the front legs of his chair snapped back to the hardwood floor. The idea was unfathomable. The doctor’s mind was cluttered with the medical data that flooded in, as he failed to calculate how the madman managed it. Still boggled by the prospect, all John could manage to caution his friend was a lame, “You should sleep more.”
Sherlock didn’t meet John’s eyes. Instead he staring fixedly, determined and solely focused on Lestat, as he added, “Please, John.”
Then, with the barest of movement, Sherlock felt a gentle rustling of his coat. It had been almost imperceptible. Most people would have missed it, along with their wallet. When he looked back there were still people close, but none near enough to be the offender. He checked the pocket of his wool coat and found a note.
John cringed, the tension visible in his face and body, screaming the irritation that he was attempting to hide.  Lestrade huffed his own frustration in more of a disapproving grunt and then ignorantly prodded, “That’s all you got, is it?”
In a single violent swing he flung the crystal vase of flowers from the table.  It hit the floor with a tinkling crash and a spray of glass and water, skidding out into a blossoming pattern of destruction.  For good measure he kicked the table over before turning to walk away.  His teeth grit and his hands holding his head he made his way to the balcony—every fiber in his body was screaming for air—just breath!
She paused, leaning back against the sink and looked away in consideration for a few moments before meeting his gaze. “Quite a few of the vampires have the gift of being able to infiltrate minds, I suspect John will as he always was an empathetic man in life. As a newer vampire, if he can get into your mind, then I am positive Ludvik will have no problems. You need to utilize the resources that are available to you, limited as they are. It’s widely known that David was an excellent telepath, he can help you if John cannot but,” The expression on her face became very serious as she looked at him.
When the two men met up at the designated location a few blocks away from the consulting detective’s connection, John’s expression was enough for Sherlock to confirm his deduction was correct. The connection that the two men shared was fascinating but it was also going to be troublesome. The consulting detective required his privacy, not that John was an intruder but there were things that he really did not care to have John know. About his past or about his thoughts and so he had to build mental blocks for himself to keep from his mind revealing more than he was wishing.
Glaring warning signals were going off in his brain, instinct demanded he leave the highly dangerous creature alone, but the scientific mind demanded that he utilize the little time remaining to determine what he could. The risk was a necessity for the greater understanding of John’s vulnerability in this state. It would help him determine what the threat of disturbing the vampire was, how well the creature could defend itself on its own, and some of the instinctual reactions of the transformation on the man. Sherlock gaged first the maximum extension of his reach with the broom and then cautiously moved towards to foot of the bed, not trusting the distance provided by coming along side the creature. With a deep inhalation, he slowly extended half of his maximum reach out and touched the edge of the broom head to the footboard on the bed.
The detective inhaled a deep breath and blew it out.  He wanted to close his eyes, but they resolutely remained open against his own will, burning with the wicking of tears.  The pads of his fingers moved over the muscles of the pulsating heart under their grasp, as his hand pushed ever deeper. The cool wetness of the body tightened around his forearm was disillusioning. Even more so was the feeling of his hand finally encircling the fist sized organ.  John cried out, gasping for breath, as the front of his torso wept faster.  His head snapped forward, his breathing now ragged. He lost the fight to control the pain Sherlock inflicted.
John consider this. It was something to pull the wool over the genius’ eyes. John realized now that he had sensed a presence in the house when he had woke or perhaps it would be more apt to say that he smelt the remnants of a presence. That remnant now that he thought more about it had a slight familiarity to it. “You know, I could tell that someone had been in the house.” He mused aloud.
Lestrade was taken aback by that.  He had dismissed the awful thoughts that haunted him in his weakest moments, when he was tired and worried sick about his friend and his fiancé.  Losing Mary would put John Watson right back to where he had been.  Was that why he was missing?  His dark eyes shot back to Sherlock, who seemed to want to evade the intense gaze and scrambled out of the leather chair.  The detective began to pace, his feet seemingly at war with where his mind felt that he should go, his hands the entire time fidgeting.  It all put the inspector very much ill at ease.
There were times, Louis would admit, that it felt as though the two of them could not be without the other, as though they were working parts that made a whole, with a function and a purpose.  There were other times, in far greater number, where the gears seemed to grind, whine, and hiss, leading to a breakdown that would put the two of them on hold, sometimes for decades.  The gap between them recently had not been as long, but felt just as painfully raw and unhealed as any of the separations started out like.
Sherlock pulled away at that single word, slowly shaking his head. He took a step back and carefully shrugged out of his jacket before he turned to hang it on the back of the door. He glanced over his shoulder to look back at John. “This.” He scoffed. “You can’t even say what ‘this’ is.” He punctuated his words with a low, mocking laugh and another shake of his head.
"Alright." Came the detectives surprising response and immediately John somehow knew the detective’s focus had switched to attempting to gain access to the 'safe room' while the vampire was gone.
His response was defensive and peevish, a snarled retaliation of, “I do not need John to search for a crime scene.  We agreed to part ways and I have returned to collect a few essentials.”
"Sherlock Holmes and John Watson! You’re right! You knew exactly who I was talking about—I love that about you!" Her friend squealed, causing a few others to glance up and draw attention away from the other girl. The rounder faced girl was definitely the more animated and dramatic of the two. John focused instead on his tea cup, as his eyes met Louis’ and the two continued to listen with interest.
Sherlock stood incensed by the demon’s audacity.  “A little pre-emptive and presumptuous, isn’t it?” he called out, breaking the pattern of the play Moriarty had constructed to act in.
—perhaps some kind of supernatural phenomenon—akin to her knack for disappearing and appearing in places she had no business being able to get into.
“How do you want to die?” He whispered with a purr into the boy’s ears and felt the twitch of resistance, the pitiful struggle of the dying mortal, fervently trying to convince himself that he had slipped into some horrible nightmare.
John hesitated another moment and then plucked the phone from the pale slender fingers of the hand extended to him. He swiped the screen and brought up the call menu then tapped in the digits of the consulting detective’s mobile.  The doctor gave the blond one last look and the other threw up his hands in a defensive gesture, chuckling, "It's not going to bite you, John."
The Talamasca were done helping. The agent had made that perfectly clear. This would be the last time he was able to use his clout as the former head to garner any interactions from the group that they did not initiate. That being said, his focus was now on the rogue faction and that was precisely whom he was now going to seek out.
She didn't take it.  With cool resolve she tipped her head towards his and chided, "God help us both."
John’s lips were pursed into a thin line and despite his new form, with its smooth white alabaster skin, there was a crease between his furrowed brows.  He gave a cursory nod and Sherlock took it, leading the way into the Baker Street flat.
“No, I think it actually makes sense.” John affirmed. “Louis had felt that Lestat was acting out of character. Not enough to suspect some kind of outside manipulation but enough to seem odd.”
The detective then retrieved his jacket from where he had shed it so haphazardly the night prior and it was then that he spotted his mobile, obscured by the rubbish bin and some discarded balls of paper that had missed their mark.  He was both delighted and bothered to have found the thing.  It sent his pulse racing, a reaction that he tried with all his might to stifle, as he clicked the black screen on.  The phone refused to react.  It was dead.
His fingers were working in tune with the marching story he laid out for his readers, sentence by sentence, with a languid fluidity. He marvelled at how the quiet of the usually raucous flat aided in his progression. He thanked his lucky stars, perhaps a little too soon.
Keeping things as focused on the case as possible was the best bet. Unfortunately his homeless network did not have a whole lot of information to add to that which they already knew. There was a curious matter with an individual asking a lot of questions about him, trying to infiltrate or gather information from his own informants. Some young woman, in her twenties with long black hair and a story how she was another hard luck case who lost everything. Claiming that she wanted to meet Sherlock so he could help her find her missing child. It warranted looking into and so Sherlock had told his connection to message him next time she showed up.
Sherlock thought of John. He thought of the power that the man himself now loathed. He thought of how he wished Lestat had not been interrupted that night – his mobile rang. The detective scrambled out of the bathroom. Wet hands fumbled to answer the call. A familiar female voice was on the other line. Sans the greeting, she simply asked, “How close are you?”
The only sound that replied to his pleas for help was a clicking and sliding that evolved into a fizzle and a creek, as the metal slab suddenly pulled back, retracting into the wall like some kind of Star Trek door.  Revealed behind it was a proper door, with silver trimming.  The handle was large and elaborate and the tongue on the top moved, as the person on the other side opened it.
"Sherlock...?" John's concerned voice quietly asked from the open doorway to his room.  His eyes opened, took in the worried visage of the other man before him, as he ventured to inquire, "What are you doing?"
She smiled again. It was too understanding, too patient, too kind to be real. It was patronizing now. Looking upon him with pious pity and condemnation. “As if you had a choice in the matter.”
John came back in from the patio to the warmth of the penthouse and wondered why he was so anxious—or was it truly excitement?  Either way, it was unsettling.  He still had no real reason to trust the American and he wasn’t even really sure what was to happen to him after tonight.  Louis had said that they were leaving, going somewhere safe, and that Sherlock would be included in that plan.  That part wasn’t as exciting.
Louis took a seat off to the side of his designated gate, staring through the large bay windows into the darkness outside. He brushed back a few straggling tendrils of raven-black hair which had escaped from his braid to curve under the turn of his jaw, all the while tracking the movements of luggage trains that taxied about on the tarmac and the pulsing of airplane lights on the runway beyond the thin barrier of glass. Looking away the immortal set his worn canvas messenger bag on the empty seat beside him and adjusted the loose fitting navy cable knit sweater to sit more comfortably against his frame. He crossed legs encased in worn button fly jeans and opened that day's copy of the New York Times.
Sherlock leaned over and spat a mouthful of blood onto the floor, before he glanced back up at the demon.  “Boring.”
As if the pain of the rent flesh wound had been somehow circumvented by his thought processes the landlady’s blatant reference back to it broke this and the pain returned double fold, radiating out with each pulse of his thrumming heart rate.  He could hear his molars grind together, from both her inopportune intrusion and to fight the searing ache.  He wanted both of them gone and so without a word he paced to the door, slamming it shut.  Mrs. Hudson gave a grumble of complaint, muttering under her breath all her grievances, as he heard her turn and begin to make her way back down to her own flat.  Then the dark haired man turned back around, his feet desiring to return to their pacing, when his eyes caught the edge of a shadow that was unfamiliar to him.
John stood abruptly, his spin cracking straight, with the fright of the thoughts that were now barreling through his mind, rampantly escalating his heart rate.  Mary was at home.  Why was he out here, pining again for what had been?
“You mustn’t tell him of what you are going to be doing or who you are going up against.” Her words were firm and to finalize it, she added, “Don’t ask why because I cannot tell you and if you press me then I am done helping you. Just know this is how it must be.”
John was fighting hard against a clashing wave of impulses, from shoving the other off him to ludicrous ideas that involved shutting those wide cupid lips with his own. He could feel himself tensing as the heat of the others body contributed to the sweat that was forming on his brow. Nervously he licked his own lips, eyes blinking more than necessary as he tried to look away from the darkened pools of Sherlock’s gaze.
"Hmn." It was all Louis could say before Armand’s lips were against his and the light frame of the smaller man was straddling his lap. The gentle rocking of the ferris wheel car was easily fading away the outside world, as bodies pressed and rolled with the rhythm.
“Yet…” John looked from his friend back down to the pig his hands were deep within, and gave a satisfying smirk, “you were unable to prove it, weren’t you?”
"No, I won't hear it," he said, as he turned on his heel, shook his head at the man, and left the room.
It was easy for Lestat with his immortal powers to tap into the conversation.  The detective’s mind was locked against him once more but the girl was an open book, he simply spread the pages of her mind, and listened.  They were discussing in code, something about money for a cup of tea or a bite to eat.  It was obvious that this was not a random encounter, they had met before in passing, and she had obviously waited to bring him something.  The money was a part of this exchange, he gave her a bill, and then she in turn gave him a piece of toilet paper.
His eyes flashed open, gaze drawn to the source of his temptation. In a blur of motion he sat up, the thin blanket he no longer required falling to his waist as he spotted the wayward detective. The tall man lay curled on his side at the far edge of the bed, one hand tucked protectively against his pale chest, the other outstretched as though unconsciously reaching for John during the daylight hours.
Despite the caffeine endued glow provided from the still warm cup in his hand the man was exhausted.  Mentally from all that had been happening, much of which he was still having difficulty putting together but also physically from his active forms of stress relief. With the coffee set on the side table, John sat.
“Sleeping.” John reiterated with emphasis on the verb. He folded his arms over his chest, leaning the chair back onto two legs as he elaborated, “Let’s say, for clinical purposes, more than two hours at a time.”
Then he seen the dark exterior of the home they had shared, movement so fast and unnatural, slipping in through the upstairs window—as though he was seeing through another’s own eyes.  There was Mary again, in a defensive pose, intense and angry.  She was bleeding.  There was blood all over her, staining her camisole and her flannel bottoms, thick in her hair and darkening her shoulder.  Yet she fought back, swung a trained punch and then a kick that was deflected by an intruder in all black—a lithe man nearly twice her own size.  Then she was struck hard to the gut.
His mind paused at the thought, distracted for a moment as the world regained some balance and the pain became a throbbing ache.
Marisa's expression was hard, resolute, despite the betrayal that lingered between them like an unspoken ghost, foul and haunting.
Again, John rolled his eyes and flopped back in his chair rubbing at his temple with a free hand.  He spotted his glass on the side table, thankful it had survived the miniature pillow fight.  He retrieved it and downed the last of it in a single gulp.  Then, through a stifled a yawn, he reaffirmed, "Right. No. Not happening"
“I suspected as much and I thank you, David. I have some rabbits I set to run on this course and can only hope the hounds will come chasing. I don’t care to play this type of hand often but don’t see much use in the conventional means of acquiring further useful information.” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling the tension slowly mounting behind his eyes. He hadn’t slept more than a few hours since the explosion of his home. Honestly, the last few months for the highly engrained government agent had been hellish.
The man’s hand returned to his pocket and he smiled that wide sleek smile. The vampire felt something else now, entirely new to him. He likened it to what a patient must feel during a pancreatic attack. The onset of the pain was sudden and acute, taking root inside of him and growing in intensity until he could not bear to keep silent anymore. His hands grappled at his torso uselessly, their pressure unable to give him any kind of reprieve. The pain began to radiate out in tendrils, as though the agony had sent out vines, like shoots from a seed, that carved new pathways through muscle and bone. It was a horrific feeling, squirming under his skin, and the knowledge that something else grew inside of him made him wretch. Nothing came out.
may be developing a crush on you, Sherlock Holmes." Without hesitation he lent forward and kissed the pale lips of the man in the bed, chuckling when the other pulled away after a startled moment. The vampire licked his lips and let his eyes admire the sharp lines of the man’s face and bare torso before he rose from the bed and stopped in the doorway. "I know you're starting to think on how to be rid of me. Trust me when I say that it is impossible now, Sherlock. You gave yourself to me, remember?"
“John,” Sherlock’s voice, hoarse with emotion, finally broke the silence. He swallowed to clear it, “I’m sorry. I won’t ask this of you again.”
Sherlock nodded, and the vampire ran his fingernail like razor across his wrist, cutting him open with a crisp crush.  The detective lowered his wrist to John’s mouth.  The blood dripped onto the still lips.
John was invited through the expansive home to a large study boasting a wide wooden desk, crimson curtains, and a large portrait of the queen.  John recognized the painting, the one of her majesty in the golden tulle dress with the wattle blossoms.  It claimed the wall, as large as the reproduction was, especially seeing it was the only adornment to the room, besides the standard bookshelves and chairs that one might expect.
Distantly he felt arms tighten around him holding him in place, straining against him for a long moment. After a time, those arms allowed him to collapse to the bed, staying firmly wrapped around John as the doctor drifted, floating slowly down from the high. Slowly reality drew him back and he found himself being pinned by the taller man.
The black-eyed devil was what had Lestat perplexed, who and what was he? It? For a creature that had warred with the most ancient of their kind, danced with witches, and argued with the devil, nothing should surprise him and yet this one had. Why stop Lestat from turning the brunet only to leave him with the vampire. There was a morbid curiosity growing in him which begged to kill the ‘toy’ just to see if the other would re-appear like magic to prevent his demise.  Yet, he wasn’t interested in a second round until he had time to better prepare. As well, he really did want Sherlock. The man was wildly driven, obnoxiously intelligent, beautiful and Lestat truly believed he had the stamina for immortality.
The air inside the flat was infused with many different odors and each one was identified in his mind like the pinging in his mind like points from a database on a large hard drive, as he stood stock still and took them all in.  There was no reason to rush, he already knew that no one was at home.  John’s coat and casual shoes were missing.  Even with the dark he could also tell that the entrance lacked any female accessories as well.
Lestat looked unnerved. Like a caged animal he eyed David with great scrutiny before his attention shot to the woman who shook violently when his eyes met hers. It happened so quickly all David could do was stagger back a step. Lestat had moved forward, snatching the woman by the neck in his iron grip and ascended into the dark sky. She hadn’t had enough time to even let out the strangled scream before he had closed off her windpipe and David was looking at the empty doorway where she had been as he muttered a curse. Glancing quickly down both sides of the street. No one had noticed in the evening bustle, thankfully. The apathy of those around and the dim lit faces staring down at mobile screens, he was, for once, thankful for as he leapt upwards after the other vampire and his innocent victim.
As much as he wanted to sleep he would not allow himself to succumb. Instead he turned to the quiet detective, who he knew was deep in thought, no doubt somewhere between the doors of the mind palace and reality. Just deep enough that he could still drive and respond to stimuli.
Marisa’s eyes narrowed, as she tilted her head to the side to look at the vampire. “That was incredibly stupid, John!” she chastised.
"Your binders on the bookshelf are labeled 'Carrington'." the detective indicated, "So, that means that you've left him and moved on, taking up your maiden name again.  Probably has something to do with the fact that you would rather hang out with your birds than other people.  Is that because they talk less or because they don't ask anything of you?"
He was still strangling the neck between them, but Sherlock was on the other side now. He faced John, pleading with him to relent. The legs gave way and John felt the body fall like a dead weight. He let go and let it fall to the ground, between them, not at all regretting what he had done. The blond head lolled lifelessly to the side, the blue eyes vacant and grey now in death, the pink tongue slipped out past parted lips.
Hands trailing down over breast and abdominals, shifting with each shallow breath, as the detective spread the soldier’s legs and positioned himself between them.
“Look, John, it isn’t like I’m the only one who noticed that you were less than ‘here’ today.” She started, none to gentle about plodding right damn into it with him.  “But you can talk to me about it, if you want to.  If you don’t, that’s fine.”
John gave a resigned sigh.  This kind of talk made him anxious.  A part of him still wanted the man.  The idea of having him close and intimately still made his prick twitch.  The other part just wanted to be left alone, wished to seclude himself from this sort of temptation and distraction.  Finally, John grumbled a response, "Fine."  Then he pointed a finger in the detective's face and warned, "But no projectiles or brooms this time."
There wasn't much in this earthly realm that could hold the fiercely daring blond's attention for long and many of their kind would consider this his biggest crux. Louis found it impossibly vexing, for more often than not he also felt the repercussions of the blond's adventures because of the dynamics of their complicated relationship.
Armand felt like he could listen to the velvet tones of Louis moan for all time. The low rumble in the beautiful man’s broad chest made his own erection twitch with excitement. The muscled and lean body was a feast for the eyes and the thick length of the shaft in his mouth was something that left him pleasantly surprised the first time they had an intimate encounter centuries ago. His skill had been learnt early in his sexual life, being able to bring another fully into his mouth, regardless of the impressive length Louis provided him. It was something he happily utilized when it came to the pleasures of his bedfellows.
that's what you were planning! How does it feel, huh?! Having someone else always, just, know what it is that your planning on doing. Who's deducing whom now?!" John actually felt pretty damn good about realizing that his access to Sherlock's thoughts could be an incredibly useful tool.  It was at least one good thing about the bombarding thoughts that zipped through his head like bullets.
It was massive and grandiose, to say the least.  The large double doors were immaculately carved and were surrounded by blue and green stained glass in a beautiful geometric pattern.  He rang the bell and a butler opened the door, inviting him inside without hardly a glance let alone a word.  John said a cheerful hello regardless.  The man continued to ignore him, as stone faced as a British Royal Guard.
Those two little words combined with the man’s expression sent a flood of desire through his veins. Oh yes, he would definitely be fucking this man, but not just yet. Instead of finding out where the man had stashed the lube and sinking into the tight heat of the other genius’s body he carefully released the genius’s captured wrists. “Touch me.” His words were a blend between a command and a plea as he continued to stare down and the beautiful man.
As John came to terms with the realization that his sociopathic flat mate had infiltrated his bedroom and nicked his handgun, he also came to the startling conclusion that the second set of gunfire had sounded slightly different than the first. This meant that Sherlock had a second firearm unknow to the soldier. The latter fact of that duo spiked his anxiety enough to get the man moving again.
He brushed the offending nothing aside, mentally taking a thick bristly broom to the words scrawled inside his conscious brain, brushing until he felt raw and rid of them.
The flat was dark as he entered. He shed his sopping coat and shoes before he went through to the kitchen and flicked on the glaring lights. He snagged a beer from beside a stack of oddly coloured Petri dishes, eager for the solace of the alcohols soothing flavour filling his mouth. He drank heavily of the dark brew, finishing half the can in one go, before giving a loud sigh of satisfaction.  He paced from the kitchen into the parlour, turning on the lights above the fireplace, as he considered whether his current mood would be bettered or worsened by another row with his unfinished blog entry.
“Fantastical—seriously fan-tastical?  You expect me to believe this?” John yelled, throwing his hands up in the air.  “I have put up with Sherlock on an
Sherlock's grin melted and he casually waved off the comment with a dismissive gesture, as he resettled himself with his head reclined on the arm of the settee. "I don't see how that has anything to do with anything."
The blankets fell away and he realized only then that he was naked.  No pants, no socks, nothing.  The doctor shrugged and made his way to the door he felt most likely was a bathroom.  There was nothing he could do about it now.  His clothes were probably close by.  At least he hoped they were.  He would look straight away, after he relieved himself.  The door did open to an ensuite and the warm lights clicked on as he entered, unveiling the largest bathroom he had ever seen.
It was tiny and bare.  The bed frame was old and rusted, repainted metal that was peeling.  The mattress was simple, set on the creaking springs of the turn of the century frame.  Beside the bed there was a round night stand, just large enough for a ceramic pitcher and wash basin.  There was a towel close at hand, so he assumed that the pitcher must be full.  Further away there was a six drawer dresser, a ratty looking wingback chair covered with an equally worn plaid blanket.  It was rather dusty, adding to the over all musty smell of disuse that pervaded the entire room.
He took the steps up to his flat two at a time, not bounding up them by any means, and behind him he could hear the door being caught and another individual following him inside—John.  Mrs. Hudson’s door opened and the two of them had a short exchange regarding the night’s awful events, yet there were little details to give the panicked elderly woman still startled by the occurrence and feeling somewhat responsible for the mess out front on their doorstep.  He was sure John could pacify her, as only the doctor could, and instead he went straight for his leather chair.  He tossed off his jacket and threw it on to the messy desk between the tall window, before he jumped up into the seat of his chair and squatted on his haunches.  His elbows sat on his raised thighs, as he drew his hands to steeple them under his chin.  Slowly he gathered all of his thoughts, all of his calculations, all of the clues, marshalling them into uniformed lines within his mind’s eye to begin sorting through them.
The door that led outside was to his right, slightly broader and thicker than the bedroom door, and when he opened it a cold gush of air rustled the blanket he had slung around him.  He could smell the ocean, smell the salt, he was certainly still in the UK.  He walked outside, finding no porch or sidewalk, just scrubby brown grass that stretched out in every direction.  The stone croft was situated in a natural dip in the land and now that he was outside Sherlock could see that the horizon was actually a cliff edge.  The ocean roared now that he was outside, pounding against the rocks unseen below.  He could see the actual horizon stretching out in a blue haze before him.
He had come to stop in front of the morbid imposter who still played bishop and the man who had once been James Moriarty. It seemed clear that Moriarty still wanted what he had all along, to beat and break Sherlock. Killing him had been too easy before and the lives of those he cared about had been the leverage that had sent them both to the underworld. The difference was that Sherlock came back a man and Moriarty had come back a demon who had brought a whole world of other monsters with him.
Growling low in his throat John released his grip and shifted again, leaning forward and sprawling Sherlock onto his back. Crawling up the man’s lithe form he placed kisses along his torso, hesitating slightly as his lips found a cloth cover nipple. He bit down gently before continuing up and aligning their bodies. Capturing his lips in another demanding kiss John began rocking once more while unbuttoning the shirt with quick, sure movements.
John didn’t let her utter the name.  He cut her off with a derisive interjection, “I am not going out.”
"And for what exactly?" The blonde’s curiosity was growing, Sherlock wasn't usually so cryptic with his speech unless he was testing John. "Other than the fun I'm going to have tomorrow watching you hung over."
That was the last thing John wanted to hear.  “So, I should just let Mary’s murderer go unpunished?”
The second place on their list turned out to be a dead end as well, the two found nothing out of the ordinary, and after moving on to the third the night was waning, leaving them both irritable with their lack of success.  The cab ride to the next location was slightly more silent than those before it, as Sherlock mulled over everything again and again, trying to find the holes in his research.
He coughed and waved his hand in front of his face when he drew in a breath of the sweetly scented smoke. He’d had enough. John turned to face the man, intent on telling him that he was going back to the house. Another cloud of sweet smoke wafted over him. Unable to stop, he coughed, though they were weak, the bloody corset containing him.
The man’s large eyes, so dark that the brown was swallowed by the blackness of his pupil, widened in interest.  His mouth worked on the gum and he blew out a large pink bubble.  It snapped loudly as everyone watched, before the man address the vampire in return.  “Big words,” he said, pausing for emphasis, “for a vampire that got his arse handed to him only a couple of weeks ago.”  He raised a hand, shaking a disapproving finger back and forth at the blond, as he rebuffed him like a misbehaving child, “I told you once, Lestat, if you can’t play nice with my toy that I’d have to punish you.  I think you’ve earned a time out.”
Louis' immediate thought was one he didn't want to entertain at the moment.  Even with the bleach and the water and the blood he thought he could also smell his maker, disquietingly somewhere in the mix.  Although Lestat had followed him across the ocean to the ancient city the other vampire had been incredibly adept at entertaining himself, which always raised a certain degree of suspicion.  His maker was normally very skilled at cleaning up after himself.  If this mess did indeed belong to the other vampire, concluding an exact reason as to why he would choose this time to be so obvious eluded Louis' thoughts.  There simply did not appear to be a clear answer as to why Lestat would engage in such activity, no matter what angle the other vampire considered.
Almost as if on cue, the water pipes began to groan as taps were turned on.  The sound was familiar enough yet Lestrade questioned the land lady, “Hasn’t your other tenant left for America?”
Still, there was no sign of the other man. John pondered then if perhaps the detective had tried to nod off—it happened so rarely that the doctor was surprised. Although unusual, the sleep was needed, and so John set to his own tasks for the day.
"Sherlock!" John barked his name so loudly that it pierced the consulting detective’s ears and he reflexively cupped his hands over them. "No!" The next word was still loud but the sharpness was dulled, as Sherlock whirled to glare at his fuming companion, his ears ringing painfully. "You can't fight this fight on your own."
Sherlock placed another delicate kiss slightly lower on the other man’s cheek and he could hear John gasp slightly. He could also hear the gnashing of molars. He kissed again, coaxingly. “You need this, John. Take it and let’s get on with things.”
As John lingered behind his desk, in the small medical office where he worked as a locum, killing time between a lull in his patient schedule for that lazy Friday afternoon, he tried to put the memory off and think of something else.  Surfing the web was useless, the man’s face was there too, his own slightly obscured over the consulting detectives shoulder or half cut out of the frame—but always present, in some capacity.  He tried reading the newspaper, but the dark curled head of the bright eyed detective was there too.  He tried grabbing a coffee in the staff room, but the hushed giggles from the female nurses and his peers, who tried not to make eye contact with the friend of the bedazzling new London genius sex-magnet, only fueled his mounting irritation.  There wasn’t much of anywhere anymore that the doctor could go that wasn’t buzzing with the adventures that the two flatmates had shared, all of them enamored by the whimsical dark curls that swept over the dark foreboding brows of man, who was genius, and still so societally inadequate that many would cringe if they ever were graciously gifted with a chance encounter with their hero and he was prompted to open his mouth.
"They just up and disappeared, like, a couple of weeks ago." Her face had become deathly serious and earnest, her tone dropping low.
He stalked out of the pub and caught his bearings.  It was not too far from home that it was out of the question to walk.
John would have shrugged if he remembered what a shrug was. Instead, he let his shoulders bobble. The movement shifted his arm. He lifted a hand, staring at it in amazement. When his fingers twitched, he huffed in surprise, bringing them closer to his face. Cross-hatched lines twisted over his skin.
His guest gave a congenial chuckle, the corner of his mouth stretching into a thin amused smile.  “Indeed.”
"So you want revenge then," the detective said with disdain, folding his arms over his chest, "and you want John to deliver it for you."
Louis took the opportunity to continue, giving a short but sweet anecdote, “I was bored and now I’m not.  Much less so after tonight’s event.”  He allowed his tone to slow as he had said the last word, his tongue clicking out the last ‘T’ with well-planned finality.  Then he stood straight again and opened the door to his flat below, issuing a quick good night to the detective.  Just before ducking away, he put a hand theatrically to his mouth and whispered, “I suggest you take a look at your neck as well.  I see that you are bleeding.”
Here he lay, naked with Sherlock Holmes, mad genius, having just been grinding against one another. He couldn’t pretend that there hadn’t been any attraction, that there wasn’t still an attraction. John hesitated, eyes mapping out the beautiful face inches from his own, those brilliant tri-coloured eyes blazing as they stared down at him and made his decision.
John rolled his eyes and slipped his coat off, hanging it far away from the macabre in the kitchen.  Then, rolling up the sleeves of his blue striped dress shirt, he came around the table to the detective’s side.  There was a layer of poly tarp on the floor under the table that crinkled loudly under his feet—he had foregone the polite removal of his shoes and the soles squeaked on the blood ridden plastic with each step.  He looked up at Sherlock with his hands on his hips and barked, “What is it?”
The accent was definitely North American, but he wasn’t quite sure if it was American anymore.  He was cold and he knew that of the clothes he had recovered from the wash line, he was still missing a shirt, so he dumped the pants and trousers on a counter by the door and did as the woman had requested.  She did not watch him, she did not look at him again until he was seated on the other side of the fire, enjoying the heat it emanated.  He extended his long legs and she watched him wiggle his toes in the basking warmth.
Lestat licked his lips again and after a moment looked at David with a nervous chuckle, his body relaxing as he shrugged. “Sorry, David, didn’t realize you were attached to this one. Last thing she needed to be doing was babbling about was men claiming kidnapping, right?”
"Something like that." John countered, "I'm not really sure on the specifics, but according to Louis he's not someone to be trifled with.  He was short on those kinds of details."
With a speed that defied to detective’s obvious state of fatigue and dishevelment, he had snatched Lestrade’s elbow and had propelled him the short distance out of the door.  It was all he could do to reel back around and wedge a toe in the jamb so the door wouldn’t close.  He could hear the detective give an exasperate grunt of complaint.  The inspector peered back at the man through the gap and repeated his last sentiment through clenched teeth.  “Find John.”
The room was not unadorned.  It was fashioned as anyone might expect a bedroom to be, with the odd touch of the owner's personality here and there throughout.  To his immediate left there was shelf and dresser, carved out of the finest mahogany and capped with a gleaming marble top that spoke of the owner's intense desire for the richness of the world.  On the dresser there was a small wooden box, carved intricately with various flowers and intermingling vines, dotted here and there with emeralds and topaz.  Sherlock opened it and dumped out the contents, raucously spilling chains, bracelets, and rings into a pile on the hard cold marble.  Then he turned back to John.
Under the flat screen he spotted a divan that sported what looked like a change of clothes.  He investigated the bundle of folded garments, finding name brand jeans, a half sleeve button down shirt, and black pants, all in his size.  As he pulled the clothes on he wondered what had happened to his own clothes.  He certainly didn’t wear expensive jeans like these.  It alarmed him just a little that they all fit perfectly.  Below the divan he found a pair of black socks and loafers.
In the periphery of his blurred vision he could see the thoughts he was gathering from the scene, which he now was the very center of, flashing past.  His vision was blurred and swirled slightly about the edges, between heavy droops of his eye lids, which were hard to thwart.  His heart rate was elevated, the shock of the events still controlling many of his physical functions.  The wound was not critical but did pose a significant risk to his life, as did the man he was left alone with.
He could just about hear her grinding her molars as he took the upper hand.  He did have to credit the girl for how quickly she returned the mask, in an attempt to hide her palpable frustration. With the water boiled, she took the time to prepare the tea in her cup.  He continued, adding, "The only real question, is why you do not want John to see you?"
"Don't be ridiculous! Get out of my tub and tell me where John is!" With fists clenched, he began to seriously analyze his probability of success in the small space, when the other gripped the sides of the tub.  The detective found himself frozen in place with a wicked grin.
“It seems I've managed to lure you into my little trap far easier then I thought.” Armand gracefully sunk into his chair by the fireplace, as a whoosh of warmth and heat flooded the room, fire springing to life at the touch of a button on the remote that sat on his side table.
Returning inside the long fingers took care to unfold the delicate square of paper. It had been folded in the style of public school love notes, little hearts penned on its edges here and there as a new tab was unhooked. Once the sheet was spread out it revealed a hastily sketched image of what he could only guess was some sort of oval carved stone. There were various characters around the outside boarder that had hints of various origins that made no sense. Babylonian, Sanskrit, Roman, Futhark and even what appeared to be a few hieroglyphs. It looked like a terrible attempt to sketch a prop for some outrageous fantasy movie script.
“Oh, he won’t listen to you.  He never has.” The vampire replied, in a maliciously dark timbre.  His mouth kissed the doctor’s throat, then again just below the curve of his jaw, before he felt teeth piercing the lobe of his ear.  Sherlock cried out his name again and then something else—he was talking to the vampire, negotiating, but John had trouble following it.  The mouth let go and then he felt the chuckle rumbling from the chest pressed against his back, before the vampire issued him an ultimatum.
Just as he tried to break loose, to spin one desperate theory, his vision was filled with the white hard body of Lestat, who had skidded to the floor boards in a relaxed reclined pose beside him.  His head was propped by an elbow on the floor and his glowing blue gaze sparkled with mirth and enjoyment, as he chuckled, light and mocking.  “Oh, Sherlock,” he said, drawing out the last syllable of his name—like Mrs. Hudson would when she was overwhelmed with compassion for his cold and strange ways.  His tongue licked his lips again, this time slow and sensual, purposed.  “I do love it when you gasp.”
"Last call." the bartender announced as John slid into the empty seat closest the door and quickly ordered two gin and tonics, which earned him a weary and unimpressed glance.
Yet the other’s company was not intolerable.  The other vampire had a far more content manner to the way he accompanied Louis, quietly pleased to simply make conversation, debate, and socialize.  It was what drew them together now and then over the years, the pleasure of one another’s content company.  Armand was right, he was unlike his own maker.  Lestat was never content, even though he could now and then act as though he were.  His mind was always moving, charging, running away with his sensibilities when life even slightly became trivial or mundane.  So there was the crux that betwixt this meeting.
If the consulting-detective was perfectly honest with himself, he would admit that he himself was not perfectly crystal clear on all the idiosyncrasies of this new chapter to their relationship, let alone where John stood.  John was generally an open book, a man that he could read in an instant, and if there interactions tonight were a testament to anything it was to the fact that this had changed between them.  Sherlock couldn’t be sure of the exact reason for this either.  All he knew was that when he had been ripping back the timbre and debris from that bonfire, smoke choking his lungs and fire scorching his hands and face, all he could think about was the man within it—a panic and a shock consuming him when he considered the removal of John from this world and from his life.
“Obviously,” John scoffed under his breath. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes as the other man continued without missing a beat.
The doctor’s blood was comforting within his mouth, on his tongue, and his lips, almost sweet and incredibly alluring.  John’s body had relaxed into his grip, as Louis drank his first little bit, and the vampire had arched over the slump of the mortal now beneath him on the plush cushions of the couch.  It was hard to focus, hard to resist the urge to indulge in the delicious liquid hot on his tongue, especially as the man let out a gasp that was more moan than breath.  Louis felt his body respond in kind to the mortal man’s own reaction to the bite and as he took just that little bit more to weaken John’s apt ability to rebel, he positioned himself fully over top of the man, spreading his legs to kneel on either side of the man’s hips, as his mouth worked the gentle connection they shared.
John’s eyes shot from the mouth to the eyes.  He knew he must look ridiculous, incredulous, in utter disbelieve, and shock.  He felt his heart pounding, could hear its irregular rhythm in his ears, but could bring himself to utter nothing in turn.
Overtop of the sparkling crystal glasses, his caramel orbs found his guest.  Daniel wasn’t here now.  No.  And Louis was far more interesting than the lost mind of his fledgling, which perpetually moved to build his miniature cities without thought for self or other.  The raven head of his company was turned away, his body moving slowly along the length of the extensive shelving that surrounded them on all sides, his eyes no doubt scanning each individual spine and marker in turn, far too intrigued with the shelves inhabitants to care for his trivial bypass of the quite regular start to their interplay when together.
John listened to the regurgitated information as the two men walked down the quiet London street and John worked on dulling the sound of Sherlock’s mind, focusing instead on simply listening to the words. The task was not as easy as it had been with any other mortal minds and as nice as it was to keep a handle on the man it was something he needed to learn to control for as long as he would need to remain with the consulting detective. Once he had dealt with Mary’s killer and then Moriarty, John had no intentions of staying anywhere near his old lover. Not just because of the mental link between them, but because he didn’t trust Sherlock and more importantly, he didn’t yet trust himself.
“Obviously,” the doctor paused to note the quirk that just as quickly vanished at the corners of Sherlock’s lips, “Well, obviously this was a Murder of some sorts.”
There was a small boudoir immediately in front of the doorway, small but enough.  As he approached he could already smell the disinfectant, whose residue still coated the cheap piece of IKEA furniture.  He opened the doors.  John’s shirts and trousers were hung in orderly rows—
The hunger that his own body traitorously gave in response made the immortal turn his head back away, to the darkness outside the windows of the car, as they sped down the motorway.  John thought of Lestrade, of Mrs. Hudson, and even of mousy Molly Hooper.  All of them were still his friends, still people he very much wished to see, wished to be around, wished to converse with again, that he would now have to forever remove from his life.  People who were still, and may always remain, in danger within his presence.
The air was cold, as he had expected it would be, and with the blue scarf tightened around his neck and the collar of his wool jacket hiked, it became increasingly clear that he could no longer ignore the itching that besieged the wound on his neck.  Stopping in the nearest café he used the washroom mirror to investigate the bite mark that he had attempted to disregard the past few days, which now it seemed had been to his own detriment.  The small punctures had closed with bubbled burgundy scabs, dotting his neck like a perfect tattoo of the doctor’s teeth, and the skin around each was red, sore, and warm to the touch—all signs that did not bode well.  The bruising had spread but had not deepened in color, the outside frayed edges of the purplish markings glowing with a faint hint of yellow and green.
“You got all that from…this?” the silver haired man queried, waving his hands about the left over brains and blood on the cement before them.
“Perhaps my elder in mortal years, my sweet David, but please do not parent me.” The blond vampire reminded his companion, as he brought a hand up to clap the sleek dark skinned cheek of the other.  “Many more feel it is their privilege.  I will not accept it from you.”
The word hung between them, unwanted and yet said.  David’s silence was very telling.  The man had been a part of the organization for years, had even held a position of power within its multitude of levels and members, and it was true that if not for this powerful groups influence the two may never have met.  Lestat owed them that much.  Still David had little patience left for the organization that had turned to retaliate against him after Lestat had given him the Dark Gift.  Their authority and power stretched without restraint from traditional governments and was undeniably still a force to be reckoned with, which David resented.
The girl’s scared demeanor shifted to one of skepticism. As she turned away from them to pour John’s blond roast, the vampire caught a snippet of thought. ‘
Lestrade had heard about them as well.  The media was hungry for a story and when Sherlock up and disappeared suddenly it was important that John and Mary were missing as well.  Some had been digging pretty deep to come up with anything to write about and unfortunately Sherlock’s name was still fresh on the minds of readers.  He had seen a paper just this morning that claimed to have seen the detective return last night to the Baker Street flat, displaying a grainy photo of a silhouette in the windows.  He had not stopped to read the story.  It was preposterous at best.
When the back of his knees finally brushed against the edge of the bed he slowly manoeuvred them around. John released his white-knuckled grip on the now damp dress shirt and coiled his arm tightly around the other man’s waist, pulling that delicious body flush against his own once more. All the while he did not break their heated kiss. Their mouths duelled and bit, tongues darting out to tease and taunt the other man as they both fought to take control of the kiss.
John leaned down over him, as the detectives brows came together over his intense eyes that calculatingly scanned the small section of alley-floor.  The doctor searched as well and felt stupid beside his friend, as he leaned back none the wiser.  He couldn't see anything.  It was dark and the cement was just as black and dirty as everything else was in the alley.  "Are you sure that’s where the body was...?" he asked, only to be cut off with brusque wave of a black gloved hand, which called for silence.
Armand brought up a hand to stop Louis before he could retort, "All is well, dear one. Which is why I wanted to spend the next few evenings reminding you how enjoyable time with me can be. Then I'll leave, you'll miss me. Then, when I return, my chances of whisking you away will, hopefully... be considerably better."
“The subject is male, early forties, no visible signs of trauma to the body to indicate how he died,” she was listing for him all the particulars he would normally expect from her upon his arrival.
John tried to cry out her name and only heard himself whimper, faint and distant.  Her eyes were wide, her mouth gasping, choking, and then the man pulled his hand back and John could see the blade, slick with bright red blood, as Mary—his Mary, sweet Mary—slumped to her knees and then the floor, hands dripping the blood she tried to hold back.
During his indulgence, the passivity he had laid on the animals had worn off. Now at the sight and smell of the other dead creature they were beginning to panic. The donkey’s brae was the loudest and John could hear the farmer lifting from his deep slumber in response. He recouped his senses, enough to nip his finger and close the wound on the cow’s neck with his own blood, before stumbling out of the barn and back into the night.
Sherlock jerkily got to his feet and teetered slightly before catching his balance.  The man marched straight over to the mirror mounted above the fireplace on the opposite side of the room, stomping over the piles of paper refuse and knocking clutter out of his way as he went.  The inspector watched him check himself over, his hands moving in quick checks over his hairline, his face, his neck, and chest.  Most of the concern seemed to be centered around his throat.  He watched curiously as the other pawed his throat three or four times, as though he were looking for something that wasn’t there.
Louis smiled at this, partially amused now in the full-lipped pout turned up at him.  Gently he stroked back a curl from his intermittent lover's brow--and softly remarked, "Seeing as you already know everything, Lestat, then I suppose it would not be presumptuous of me to say, 'I'll see you there.'"
This is Sherlock Holmes, he reminded himself. Your bloody git of a flatmate, the genius who pisses people off within a minute of meeting them, often in less time than that. Unfortunately, his body didn’t care. All his body knew was that the person sitting on him had long legs that framed his hips nicely and magic hands.
John let out a resigned sigh, raking a hand back through his glistening blond hair. Sherlock tracked the motion. He still could not quite believe how shiny the hair follicles had become with the man’s change. John cringed and asked the obvious question. “How do we even kill a demon?”
“You will not be harmed, doctor,” the voice answered the threat, as cool and collected as everything else had been delivered to him, “and when you are no longer in danger then I shall release you.”
After hundreds of years, time could still be a fickle thing when it came to its passage, too fast when one wished they could pause ir it would drag along painfully slow with all the burn of salt in a wound. Entertainment helped greatly with the latter problem.
John could feel this shift in position but was barely aware of it cognitively.  Normally he would have resisted any such closeness, any other man’s hands on him in the intimate way that this creature had cradled him, but never had this happened to him before.  The mouth and tongue against his neck had started something that he could never find the words to explain.  It was powerfully addicting and he found himself unable to resist or even find the desire to fight it.  He felt the cool press of the rock hard body over him and did not mind being straddled, if it meant this would not end.  His eyelids felt heavy, they bobbed open and closed, before finally falling.  His breathing was slow and rhythmic but light and breathy.
John groaned at the delicious assault, his body burning with need and desire. Unable to help himself, he increased their rhythm, grinding their bodies together with a greater urgency than before. His hands ran down the man’s sides, sliding over each rib and caressing the sinfully smooth skin beneath his touch.
“That’s not exactly the point I was trying to make,” John said simply, folding his arms across his chest, as he leaned his arse back against the sink. “You scared the piss outta’ me.”
“Ah, David, you have returned.” He said simply, a greeting of sorts to fill the emptiness of the silent dark room.
Sherlock did not stop feeding John’s mind with anything and everything he could, even as the vampire seemed to come out of the paralyzed state he had assumed when Ludvik had launched his attack, some ninety minutes prior. He watched John wake up, relief flooding the man’s face, and the detective had to prompt the vampire into action.
The auburn head tipped down, his nose smelling the delightful scents of the liquor, allowing the silence that had settled to remain—swallowing the subtle fact that so far this stage of the evening was becoming somewhat one sided.  It was still comforting to have the other’s presence, to feel the wonder and enjoyment radiate from his companion, to simply watch the man deep within his own reverie.
Moriarty’s eyes widened, and he nodded his head.  “Yes!” he squealed, excitedly, as he lifted his hands out to the detective and asked, “Wasn’t that just thrilling!?  Did you get my brains out of your coat?  I always loved that coat of yours, with your lapels cocked up to show off those cheek bones of yours.”
"Then both of you will be free to do as you please." the answer was simple enough and delivered in such a fashion that clearly sounded, as if it was a guarantee to the finality of their interactions.
“That is an understatement.” John shot back. It didn’t sting as much as it could have. “I almost strangled you that night. You and that damn mustache you penned on your upper lip. Mary thought you were darling. She giggled for a good week after that and it killed me to hear her think on your trick so fondly.”
“You really are an ass-hat.” She said.  The sound of her voice was low and rather surprisingly bored.  She had bottled the rage that she had been exhibiting moments before and in doing so had taken all the fun out of annoying her.  Her use of language really was deplorable.  She was highly intelligent and still chose not to use it when criticizing him.  “You know, you make it really hard for anyone to have sympathy for you.”
When the fire works began and the fair grounds grew quiet, between the cheers that followed brilliant explosions of colored light, the two men stood amidst throngs of mortals with eyes up cast. Armand stood with his back against Louis’ side, the other vampire’s arm slung around him.
Sherlock’s eyes were shaded under the veil of the dark lashes, as he tipped his head up from the table and cracked a wry smile up at John. The look was far more sexual than the man had any idea of being aware of and the vampire swallowed hard.
All of this had been pulled together through hacked CCTV footage from near-by private and public cameras. None of which gave a clear enough shots to be of any help in identifying individuals, of which there had been three, likely two men and one woman based of the little Sherlock was able use. They had been little more than useless black blurbs in far away and grainy footage. Only one vehicle was identified to be involved and it was, as suspected, a black utility van entirely devoid of license or useful markings.
Lestat smiled and looked across at the detective.  He wrinkled his nose and looked back up at her, commenting, “Certainly not my idea of a good time, but I suppose to each their own.  I commend your perseverance, my sweet—I mean, for dealing with the detective now…not your birds.”
The detective made to take a breath and the dark haired immortal cut him off, slightly perplexed and wary of what the man’s exact intentions were with his uncharacteristically forward friendliness and the freely divulged information.  Unobtrusively he cut in with a quick and quiet question, deftly attempting to side track the detective’s train of thought.  “Dreadful indeed.  Not something I expected here in London but I suppose also not entirely out of the question.  I suppose then, given your reputation as the world’s only consulting detective, that you are involved in the investigation?”
The detectives sleep was fitful, wrought with the feverish sweats and nausea of the withdrawal.  He had vomited at some point and finally he had slept what he felt must have been soundly for a few hours when he awoke the next day, late in the morning.  Despite everything he did feel better.  He was almost through the worst of it.  He was drenched in a slick sweat, his hair was a tangled mess that clung to his wet neck and forehead, and his muscles still ached.  Yet the goose bumps were gone, as were the chills and the nausea.  When he sat up in the bed he soon realized that Marisa had been tending to him.
The inspector gave an eager nod.  Yes, of course, explaining that he had already been doing that, and then John caught something else.  Something in the detective’s mind about a post card and the vampire was immediately wary.  “S-she hasn’t received any kind of…oh, I don’t know…correspondence of late, has she?”
’. That other with whom she had replaced. The hole with which she had sewn shut, coming undone, fraying apart. She never said it with malice and she never said it with a jealous taint. It was a fact. Just as solid as gravity or inertia. A thing which was true, and which was accepted. Work with which she would mend again, as many times as it took.
Lestrade confirmed that Sherlock had discarded it, when he had shown it to him, and so John knew where he would be after this.  There really wasn’t much more he wanted to know then and he certainly wanted to avoid those other questions that he could hear in Lestrade’s mind—how much younger he looked, how good he looked, and why that was—so John gave the convenient excuse of not lingering in case it drew unwanted attention from his attackers to his friend and the two parted ways.  John left not completely unscathed.  Lestrade had pulled him in for a quick strong embrace, again repeating his apologies for what had happened to Mary, and gave John his word that he would watch over his land lady while he and Sherlock sorted out this mess.
Marisa contemptuously spit on the body, cursing in Latin. The amethyst colored stone that had shimmered with its beautifully crafted pentagonal cut was now black as pitch and completely matte.  She slipped the gold length of chain over her head and nestled the demonic gem under the buttons of her white military cut blouse.  She flipped the length of her blazing red hair out of the chain, as she stated very plainly, “Rot for eternity in there, you cock.”
The blond stopped them both, suddenly, in their casual journey down the London side-walk and raising a doe-skinned black-leather hand he gently grazed his fingers along the chiseled slope of Louis cheek, brushing a sweep of the ebony strands that had escaped the conservative tie of his lover hair. He felt the clench of the jaw beneath his gloved fingers and saw the uncertainty that clouded over those dark eyes, but he also knew that Louis would and had to eventually forgive their last bad 'break-up'. There was nothing he could do about what had been done, as always, hindsight was 20/20. Louis was here, had agreed to this simple whim of his and that, in itself, showed he was working his way back into the others good graces.
Her mouth moved from its thin line with a quick rake of her top teeth, before they pursed.  She was smart enough to figure this out.  Finally, after only a moment of deliberation, she answered, “He didn’t tell me that he was dead.”
The man then stood, not making a sound as he moved, an unnatural grace to the lithe action that Sherlock could not attribute to any physical means of possibility.  The stranger moved to leave and did not turn back when Sherlock came to his own feet.  Fearing the loss of the man’s intriguing presence the consulting detective procured an offer to keep his unexpected guest’s company, spilling the suggestion quickly and without much tact.  “Stay.  We could…have a game of chess.”  Desperate.  He didn’t have to see the man’s face to know what he had gauged from the hasty comment.
John visibly tensed at the mention of the his maker. "Hmph. I wouldn't trust anything that snake says."
As Marisa’s words came to a conclusion, a glowing circle formed on the floor around the dismembered body. The circle was some kind of ancient symbol, filled with a pentagram, surrounded by five symbols that Sherlock did not recognize.  This symbol glowed brilliantly, the light shining upwards, as the walls and floor shivered with the rush of power. Like an electrical current, it moved through the room, gathering at the symbol, as though sucked towards it. From the severed opening of the demon’s head there was a sudden rush of blackness.  The cloud of black particulates whipped around them all like sand stirred in a dust-devil.  It screamed like a hellish wind storm, as though lost in the room now that it was free of its vessel.  Lestat stood upright in the black maelstrom and the head in his hands fell to the floor, rolling several times away. The blackness that encircled them spiraled in a dark vortex to the low height of the gold and glass plated ceiling, smashing into it.  Unable to escape, the scream of it grew louder, piercing, before it was violently sucked downwards into the center of the glowing pentagram on the floor.  In a matter of milliseconds, the demonic force was imbibed, and the symbol vanished.
It was hard for the detective to not feel spurned by being left out of this little plan she was trying to hatch.  Marisa seen his indignation and swiftly cut him off.  "Head to Prague and I will help you get in.  Help you to meet with Ludvik as privately as I can arrange it.  He is aware that John is a vampire and he thinks it was all part of Mary's scheme to betray the group.  He wants John dead and if given the chance he will pounce on the opportunity to accomplish the deed himself.”  Marisa paused but a moment to moisten her lips, before continuing to explain, “You need to be the one to get the amulet away from him.  This will decrease his power enough that John will have a chance to kill him.  We all get what we want this way."
“What do you mean? That’s the only key I could find.” The blond suddenly realized he may have acted a little hasty in his punishment of the man stuck to the radiator. “Bollocks.”
“There in lies the risk.” Sherlock confirmed.  “Ludvik ordered Mary’s death. Marisa was true there. Despite Moriarty’s agenda, getting the stone away from Ludvik is imperative. We just need to control the stone after that point.”
There were only a few scattered greetings that preceded the message, exchanges of address and times, but it was more than enough to know that his newest fledgling was back in London. That meant that Louis was possibly in London as well or that the good doctor had been cut loose. Louis was not the type to play nursemaid for long. John, for his interactions and observations of the man, did not cast well to being the victim, at least, not for any great length of time. Given what he did know of the man, it was a rather resilient rebound. The sneer had faded to a somewhat impressed quirk as he thought on his latest fledgling.
Inside was warmer, yet their hardened skin did not register it in the same way. Even with the heavy jacket that he wore it was mostly just for show and not function. Edmonton’s bitter cold did not effect their kind.
The small woman ripped her arm free as though his grip were nothing.  “You don’t get to give me orders.” She whispered menacingly, before she spun and stormed from the croft.  He made to catch her but when he got to the doorway, she was gone, as mysteriously as ever.
"Figured as much.  After I get back, you can explain on the way." the vampire replied, before slipping out of the safe house and disappearing into the night.
Sherlock let out a startled cry that was half moaned, as he felt the sharp pierce of his lover’s fangs. The teeth tore without grace into the deltoid, where his neck met his shoulder.  He could feel the hot well of his own blood being pulled into the mouth of his lover and suddenly his body was overwhelmed.  In a shuttering constriction of muscles, he came, spilling his own hot fluid, as John drank from him.
John’s thick brows crossed and his eyes glowed brilliantly.  His face melted to reveal the pale killer above him instead of his lover.  The detective could feel the blond tendrils of curls, still damp, trail lazily over his cheeks, as the vampire, replied simply, “As you wish.”
“This has nothing to do with John.” Sherlock had all but barked that last statement at the inspector, his brows knit and his eyes alight with obvious agitation.  His full lips pressed into a thin line as he flicked the smoke to the cement and extinguished it underfoot, his eyes following it to the ground.
The girl from Puffin Island was standing over the sink, casually rinsing bubbles off a few dishes as if she was just another flat-mate cleaning up after having a snack.
John cursed, as his immortal senses alight with the sounds and sensations around him. The commotion had caused all in the near vicinity to panic and as their screams filled the air, their hysterical thoughts generated a raucous cacophony in his mind that was nearly debilitating. He could not allow himself to succumb to this distraction. He closed his eyes and blocked out everything else, concentrating on what he knew was Sherlock’s.  His scent was there.  John locked in on it, no need to memorize it, it was already familiar to the vampire.  He dressed quickly, leaving everything else, and then left through the new opening out into the darkness of the cool night. He used everything his immortality gave him to utilize in his search, regardless of the fact that his chances of winning this battle were non-existent.
Their moans mingled into one groaning sound that rumbled between their pressing bodies. Sherlock’s hands ran down the length of his chest before rising to his shoulders, nails biting into the marblesque skin. He rocked his hips against John, a shudder racing through his body as his own hardness encountered John’s full erectness.
“Hardly…necessary.” He managed to grumble out through the mess, as he glared at the vampire already back its master’s side.
Still, it would not end well for humanity.  Would they not be caught as the collateral damage between two vicious battling forces?  How could these two opposing powers wage war while still remaining concealed from the reality of the unsuspecting populous?
He second guessed even his own consciousness then. Perhaps, he was not awake at all. The first blow had been thrown, the first assault launched, and here he was, rendered incapacitated without even the mere knowledge of having lost.
Moriarty stuffed his hands into the pockets of the dark slacks, his head lolling slowly downward and to his other shoulder. Those dark eyes seemed to keep on him through this entire movement, sending chills through John like nails driven into him. It was disconcerting to be here with this monster and not know if it was truly him or some other unknown foe.
John followed his friend to small pub and after purchasing a couple of drinks, they settled into a darker alcove to talk.  John hoped the shadows would hide the some of the changes.  He really didn’t want to answer those questions.
The demon noticed his gaze and reflection. “Ain’t she just sweet?” the demon whispered, flicking his eyes back at the puffin-girl. “My double agent. She got the best of Lestat and you. Too sweet and innocent looking to cause alarm or suspicion. Ludvik, that bumbling toad, walked right into my trap, all because of that perfect pink pout of hers.”
“I mean,” he reiterated, through clenched teeth, “that they expected time of him that took away from the work.  It was a bloody nuisance.”
Sherlock inhaled deeply and then began regurgitation his analysis for the man that seemed fit to make him dance.  “Most certainly a psychopath, extremely narcissistic, with a pension for violence and utter cruelty.  A desperate desire to capture and hold attention from others, with the continual inability to garner it from those whom you feel you deserve it from the most.  Trouble establishing and maintaining relationships, unaided by poor self-control and extreme impulsiveness.  Obviously highly intelligent –“
Sherlock's curls shifted about his brows as he turned his head back to his friend, those variscite eyes engaging, as the smile on the man's lips broke.  "Lestrade was right, there is no crime scene.  The body was obviously dumped, the murder was committed somewhere else, and the body was cleaned.  Extremely well."
John made a low sound in the back of his throat, one hand grabbing the detective’s arse, forcing their bodies into more firm contact. His other hand tightened in the man’s curls. He found Sherlock’s mouth. Desperate hunger filled him, and he sucked harder, wanting to score another line of red into the detective’s skin. With every drop of blood that he swallowed, his need grew.
“Back to London. Back to Baker Street.” The detective answered. He sounded forlorn one minute and then a soft chuckle made his voice fond again. “Mrs. Hudson was upset but she was glad at least I was back, even if I was half mad. Lestrade was angry. Everyone wanted answers, wanted to know where you and Mary were, and I had nothing to give them but excuses.”
Then he left. Walking off into the night, Lestat remained on his knees, back to the city and he did not weep. He did not get sick. He only wished that death would release him from what was to come.
Sherock studied her askance, noting her petite frame, clad in heavy jeans and a thick zippered jumper with a hood.  Her long straight red hair was pulled back into a high tie at the back of her head.  It seemed to glow hot in the light of the fire.  She had a thin oval face, red arched brows over her large eyes, above a thin nose and small mouth.  Her lips pursed and then, without looking up at him, she said, “Ya’ know, you’re kinda being a little douche-y right now.  You can ask a question, instead of trying to stare it outta’ me.”
The scene changed, John was gone and he heard his own pathetic whimper.  It was echoing, as though it did not resonate from within the confines of his own body, but someone else’s.  The lids of his eyes felt heavy, drooping open and closed against his will.  What he could see was half blurred, plagued by bothersome black blotches that flickered in and out of his periphery.  The blond stranger was there, younger, scared but somehow still invincible, covered in blood and surrounded by the bodies of several wolves, with his hot breath pluming into the cold air of the snow-covered forest around them.
Leaving the take away behind Sherlock grabbed his coat and scarf and rushed from the flat, slipping on both as he ran to hail a cab.
“You taste…” the demon whispered against his face, pausing to take another luxurious sampling, “far better than expected.  No wonder John couldn’t help himself.”  The rough tongue lapped across Sherlock’s full lips, even as he pressed them tightly together, and then moved away across his high cheek bones to run the perimeter of his ear, those needle like teeth toying with the small lobe.  “I told you once, Sherlock, that I would burn the heart out of you.  Now…I’m going to make goooood on that promise.”
John knew this. He had practiced avoiding it routinely and was regimented in his resolve to appear as mortal as possible. He fully understood the reasons why and the repercussions of not doing so, and yet now...he could not find that resolve.  He could not resist that scent and the reactions it caused in his new body.  Worst of all was the over powering feeling of possession that slowly claimed his senses, given even greater power by the strong aroma of his own scent overlaid on the man, his
The detective called the vampire's name, loud and clear to the same effect.  He shouted the name, with still no change.  Then he brought his arm back in yank-perfect wind up and threw the box at the body in the bed, as hard as he could.
When the man had finally exited the shower, wrapped in his blue satin housecoat, Lestrade was astounded at his physical appearance.  Sherlock had always been thin, bordering on gaunt, and his lofty height had left him looking lanky.  Now he was almost a skeleton of his former self.  Those high cheek bones seemed even more pronounced and the bags under his eyes were purple from lack of sleep, accentuated by the unsettling ashen pallor of his skin.
Of the Talmasca, he had little new information. The organization was old, possibly pre-anno domini but there was no way to tell. There seemed to be factions all over the world from what he could tell, operating under different names but the concept of the secret society seemed similar enough to connect them together. Especially with the loose information he had with respect to the unproven history of the vampires themselves. He had once more skimmed the various vampire chronicles for information regarding the group, but had little success stomaching the romanticized ‘fiction’ in order to pull facts for verification.
“I haven’t seen that blond fellow that was over not long ago to see you,” the ever nosey Mrs. Hudson said, as she prepared his cup with cream and sugar, not bothering to ask how he liked his tea.  “Has he gone back to America then?”
It was reflex to curse the reaction that he didn’t understand.  For all rights and purposes his brain was still agitated, irritated, focused on the sheer audacity of the impertinent bastard—genius or not he knew how to be a bloody jerk all the same!  And then why was his body reacting—he reflexively swallowed—otherwise?
"Have you figured it all out yet, Sherly? I mean, it really doesn't matter in the end. There's no stopping what is going to happen here…now…but it is kind of fun to watch your little hamster brain at work. Run, run, run, all you like. You’re just spinning your wheel." Moriarty reached out a hand and hooked a finger in the collar of John’s button down. Like running his finger through warm butter, he effortlessly popped the buttons of the plain cotton shirt. Tinkering, the hard plastic buttons shot loose of their thread bonds, some hitting the stone floor and other thunking off the wall of saintly portraits.
David nodded his affirmation.  His golden irises flickered, as they passed under the illuminated street lamps, terribly beautiful and fierce at the same time.  Then the significance of this fact hit Mycroft.  “Which also means that the organization is aware that they had members who have defected to this radical faction.”
The detective had deduced her correctly.  She was attractive, slender and pretty, not well endowed but amply enough, and that shocking dark crimson hair in contrast to her brilliant pale green eyes was hard not to notice, no matter your sex or persuasion.  She never found men.  Men found her.  Sometimes she went along for the ride.  The last one had lasted the longest—he averaged somewhere between eight to ten months at best—but had given out due to the same old reason.  The redhead hated the tedious nature of today’s conversation just about as much as he did—plus her priorities would always remain first and foremost for her work.  Sherlock could respect that much.
The vampire crossed his arms, one hand coming up to stoke the sides of his chin. “I believe now that Moriarty’s power stems from some kind of demonic entity. He’s not possessed. In my experience with the like, I would surmise that he has somehow come into this power, although I haven’t the slightest idea how.”
Refusing to break their kiss or slow his rocking hips he began unbuttoning the offending shirt from the bottom up. John was quick in his motions, wanting it out of the way so that he could touch more of the younger man. When the last button popped free, he parted the silk and drew s slow step away to admire Sherlock’s panting form. It was only then that he noticed the detective’s hands still stretched out above his head, remaining in the same place that John had trapped them in before.
He had no idea how to act around the tittering girls and chuckling men who wandered around pretending that they were from two hundred years ago. It made no sense to him. Why not live in the here and now? If nothing else, the clothes fit much better. He shifted again, spine already beginning to ache. His thoughts were interrupted by a stranger stepping up beside him.
Although the two years they had spent apart had been torturous in every sense of the word, the detective had been prepared for it.  It had been a sacrifice, but one that he had been prepared to take.  John’s grief was needed to solidify his efforts in the eye of Moriarty’s extensive crime ring and had done so very effectively—at John’s expense.  The man had done what many men would do—attempt to move on—and when the lovely and mysterious Mary had so caringly offered to become a part of that healing process, what normal man would resist?
Terrorists? No—there was no way it would benefit him to have this connected to one of the many factions that would have loved to take credit for destroying Mycroft Holmes personal estate.
“I’m in the middle of something, so no, I won’t be buggering off,” Sherlock growled indignantly in return, bending down to retrieve the large yellow foam ear pads from the floor where John had knocked them.
Moriarty’s smile deepened, as he tipped his head in his direction and answered with a pleasant sigh, “But immensely satisfying.”  Glancing back down he lolled his head back and forth as he mumbled, “Now, where was I?  Oh, yes!”  He flicked his fingers in a beckoning motion, “Angel, bring up the deceased.”
“You must go inside.” She stated. It had been pushed out of her, words she dreaded to say. She extended the key, refusing him eye contact, as he nodded and she released it into his hand.
Sherlock nodded. “I can’t say for sure, but the stone has a piece to play in all of this for Moriarty. I just haven’t figured out exactly what that part is yet.  For all intents and purposes, it would make more sense for Moriarty to leave the stone in the hands of the rebel leader, especially if he intends to incite a supernatural war.”
“They are being picked apart.” David explained, “They are unable to thus far ascertain if these members are leaving willingly or not, even though a large focus of their manpower has been shifted to cover this new threat.  This group of individuals is interfering—the opposite of what the Talmasca stands for.”
The genius was timing every inward stroke with his mouth sliding down. The uncomfortable feeling of the finger began to dissipate. Instead, it began to add to the pleasure he was experiencing. It was too much and John didn’t think he could take anymore. He arched when he felt a second finger enter him, the stretch a low burn that he barely noticed over the waves of pleasure crashing over him.
"I am sure." Louis’ reply sounded peevish to his own ears but the other didn't seem to take notice or simply chose to ignore it
He walked until the man stopped him. John blinked, leaning forward to look at his reflection in the shiny paint of the car. “Oh,” he whispered, his fingers trying to capture the shifting picture. No matter how many times he tried, he couldn’t grasp it. John began to snicker and abruptly sat down, uncaring of the man now cursing behind him. He touched the wheel that absorbed all the light, fingers rubbing back and forth over its side.
"Of course, Louis. You know I can hardly deny you anything. Send me the address of your first stop tomorrow night and if I arrive after you have left then I will call you. Is that acceptable, lovely one?" the endearment was exactly what Louis needed to hear at that moment, when he was feeling as if he was slowly slipping off a ledge of guilt for the mortals he was now desperate to protect.
There was a sudden shift, like a light switching off and suddenly Lestat stopped. The older vampire reflexively released his grip, like someone had cut the signal from his brain to hands, the fingers opening and releasing without warning or warrant from the owner. John scrambled back and howled in pain, spitting blood that pool in his mouth from his own cut lips and broken nose. Globs of red droplets were spat into the face of his maker, still frozen as though paralyzed. The fledgling could not think, he merely acted, so consumed with the fight instinct that raged through his body. He pounced onto his opponent, not bothering to wipe the blood from his face or mouth. They toppled to the ground in a heap of limbs. John straddled the blond, who still seemed unable or unwilling to defend himself. Enraged the soldier laid fist after fist into the blond’s face, pummeling a vampire who simply lay there unflinching.
With his stray hand he ran an finger absently down the right armrest of the plush micro-fiber chair, incredibly soft fibers slipping like silk on satin as the pale digit stoked the ‘house warming gift' that had arrived without question or warning. There was no doubt that the other would take exception to anything other than gratitude. Louis folded the newspaper and placed it on the side table, listening as the door from the street opened and the obvious sound of Mrs. Hudson entered. The rustle and heavy foot fall of a woman burdened with grocery bags who was fighting to get the door closed behind her. This was emphasized by the soft curses under her breath, only audible through the walls that separated them because of the vampirical gifts he possessed.
John scoffed and gave him a sneer askance, as he rebutted, "I'm still human, Sherlock, just a different kind."
“What the hell do you want me to do about it?  I don’t know where they are!” John snapped at the two of them, not quite sure he could believe that they were asking of him.  They both certainly knew who Lestat was and what he was capable of.  “I don’t want to have anything to do with either of them!  I’m no match for Lestat.  He will bloody well kick my ass and the both of you know it."
“Want Sherlock.” John closed his eyes as his world slanted, or maybe that was him simply rolling onto his back. “Sherly! Come out, come out, wherever you are!”
Mycroft settled himself into the backseat as his faithful attendant closed the door before taking her own seat. The black privacy glass that divided them allowed him to not be concerned with perception as he brought up his hands to rub at the bridge of his nose and take in a slow deep breath, obvious exhaustion in his huffing exhalation.
John took the two steps across the room to a wooden chair in the corner, where he had folded his own clothing the morning before. As he pulled on the snug jeans and slung the azure short-sleeve button up over her shoulders, Louis was at his side. The other vampire’s delicate hands calmly came to the sides of his torso, as he leaned down and encouraged, “Slow, John.”
He closed the small space that separated them and reached up to tug Sherlock’s face down to meet his. It was chaste, a mere press of the lips, with the taller man refusing to cooperate by opening his mouth to deepen it. After a few seconds, John drew back in frustration, scowling openly at his friend. “Isn’t this what you wanted?” He gestured between the two of them, annoyance colouring his words.
“I was sleeping, Sherlock,” John patronizingly called after the obtuse man, following him around the corner into the kitchen, “like normal people do.”
The brunet rose from the table and began pacing back and forth before the fireplace, behind the blogger. John knew that gate, the exaggeration to his steps, the set of his pace—the man was frustrated. Distracted, John wondered what the cause was, given that the water chamber test seemed particularly simple when the doctor realized it may not be frustration after all. His medical instincts took over, silently assessing the patient, observing what at first glance might seem normal, but was ultimately something much deeper.
Mycroft could no longer wait, his impatience fueled by his long ignored urges and by David’s teasing, having been brought to that point of near ecstasy twice now without fulfillment.  His hands reached down between their bodies, even as David invaded his mouth with his own tongue, and grasped the vampire’s straining organ.  His intent was clear and David brought one hand down to assist.  He positioned himself to press against the other’s oil slicked opening.  Slowly he pressed the head of his own erection inside the hot confines, waiting for Mycroft to let out the breath he was holding, before he thrust inwards the rest of his length.
Sherlock ruffled his hands through his knotted dark curls, scratching his nails gratingly against his scalp, as he muttered angrily, “Agh, who is it?”  He pushed himself up into a sitting position on the couch, his dazed gaze surveying the disaster and chaos that was his flat.  The papers were everywhere, a thick deluge covering the floor.
He had worked up an appitite and was not done with his house guests. There was a vicious part of him that was satisified at his lust for violence as of late. It could be easy to get carried away and subsiquently he tried to learn valuble lessons from his prevous adventures. Lately though, he had scortched more then just Louis shirt, it was not the first time in the the recent past that his temper had caused items to smoke or catch flame. An occurance that was unsettling at the best of times but was also becoming more and more frequent.
It took the detective a moment to rationalize and conjure a response, to fight past the lust of their love making, to form an answer.  “Since…since the day… I jumped.” He panted back.
“You like it.” The vampire whispered, as he kissed the pink raised nipple of the chest beneath him.  He took his time now that he was in, circling each nipple with his tongue, until Mycroft was begging for more.  Then he acquiesced to the others pleas, slowly pulling back and moving forward, rocking into a rhythm that would keep them moaning together for hours in mutual desire.
The other man’s body seemed to tense at that and Sherlock watched him slowly turn back, just a degree.  There was a flicker of his eyes but the detective was unsure if he had moved or not.  Once more his eyes were trained on the wet glass.    His hand was instantly up—the detective had blinked and missed the movement—and his fingers massaged at his temple, discomfort slightly apparent on the hard features.
Sherlock could contain himself no more.  It was now evident who had the doctor, who the fourth arbitrary party during the altercation at Mary Morstan’s had been, and he lunged at the man, hands groping to grasp onto the imp that had stolen John.  His hands met with thin air and then concrete, as his body crashed to the ground with the gnashing of flesh on cement.  When he looked up the man was gone, nowhere to be seen, the echo of his haunting laughter fading in his ear drum.
John had never liked to be analyzed.  It was why he had struggled so terribly with the psychiatric appointments he had been through before meeting with the detective.  But even those he had come to terms with, had realized were helpful even though he loathed them, and was why he had returned after Sherlock's fake death.  Sherlock wished that John would submit to his curiosity.  Allow him to study the new form that he inhabited, to understand it.  But it seemed the vampire never would and the detective was beginning to think he understood why.
"How could you have gotten better at this?" The question left his lips with a hiss at the end as John swallowed and constricted the hot wet cavern that engulfed him.
Lestat's fingers played absently with the braid that started at the base of the other’s neck and hung over his opposite shoulder, a touch and action that Louis both desired and resented in that moment. The blond was using this soft playful acknowledgment as a means of coaxing his creation to play the game he was so adamantly refusing. Yet it wasn't as though the other wished him to stop. His maker's affections were hard to capture and hold, although there was also no escaping them when he willed it.
Sherlock remembered hitting the floor, the feeling of his jelly legs crumpling under him as his face slammed into the floorboards.  He remembered hearing John’s quick approach, the grip of his hands around him and the press of his body close, as he was hauled back up and flopped safely back into bed.  John was not here to help him now.
The detective had felt that alarm go off before but was recounting his previous moments of fear and they relieved nothing. The closest moment of what he considered irrational fear was during his and John’s adventure with the great 'Hound of Baskerville' and the drug induced horror the make-believe demon dog produced.
“Oh, so I see you do know what time it is.” Lestrade fired back, gesturing at the man before him still clad in his dressing gown and bare feet.  “Dare I ask what you’ve been up to these last few days?”
“An experiment.” Sherlock finished, with a curl at the corner of his mouth.  His lips were speckled with droplets of blood too.  Most of the man was.
Silence settled into the room as John focused all of his attention on the wet material in his lap, idly pulling at a loose thread as small rivulets of water escaped and ran down his leg and onto the floor beneath him. Sherlock seemed to be pondering. He had that odd faraway look. From past experiences John knew that expression did not bode well for him at all. Standing abruptly, the taller man moved towards him, holding out a hand to help him to his feet. “Come John.”
Her eyes glanced up just as Sherlock turned to find the blond and before either of them could complete the movement the vampire was behind the detective.  His icy hands were on his shoulders and when Sherlock tried to break the hold, he failed, he was unable to even budge the statue-esque figure behind him.  Lestat gave a deep hearty chuckle, as the detective glanced askance at his keeper.  Marisa’s figure had straightened pertly, arms still folded but knuckles white with tension.  She was made uneasy by the vampire, so he had been correct in deducing that she knew very little about him.
John drew a deep shuddering breath which ended in a moan when he felt Sherlock slowly pull out, leaving him feeling cold and empty inside. He rolled onto his side to face the younger man, his body still shuddering on occasion with small aftershocks.
His searching’s into Moriarty yielded the same results as the other two - a dead end. From reading the vampire’s fiction, he had concluded that it was possible that the man could be demon possessed, or be drawing power from whatever realm such creatures came from – seeing as he now had to believe that they did truly exist. The fiction claimed that vampires themselves stemmed from a demonic power. Given that the gifts that Moriarty had thus far demonstrated, Sherlock could conceivably conclude that the man was one as well. How else could one simply reanimate after eating his own bullet?
“The people involved are but a piece to the puzzle.” David answered quickly, “It is also your reckless means of bait that you’ve chosen to use as enticement and your final intentions for the mortals that has raised hackles.  Each in part is trivial but when you add them together it equals an infringement that the Sisters, among others, are not likely to excuse.”
“I’m sorry if I’ve upset you, Lestat, but you don’t exactly get abducted every day, so of course I have questions.” David’s tone was calming, his gesture defensive as he moved casually away from the woman, his body language directing them both away from the now scrambling woman.
His lover did not resist the movement as much as Lestat had suspected, making the blond purr with satisfaction and arousal.  They had not been this close for many years and the taste of his lover’s immortal skin was strikingly pleasing, as his mouth moved along the length of the graceful neck to the small dip of the man’s jugular notch, where his thin clavicle bones met the strength of his sternum.  Louis shuddered then, the smallest of quivers that would have been imperceptible to any mortal and was almost certainly involuntary.  Lestat’s purring growl changed to a triumphant splash of laughter and then he was silenced, by his lover’s silent and violent retaliation.
The doctor showered, lingering in the hot steaming water that surged against his body from every bloody direction imaginable, allowing it to scald the hide right off of him, before he scrubbed the rest away.  More thoughts of Mary came, some warm, some cold, some wanted, some not, and he cried then.  He couldn’t help it, the tears just came, and he let them roll away with the hot water.
Why else would he have so brusquely forgone a subtle reintroduction into the doctor's life?  He couldn't wait for societal nuances and acclimations to be met.  It would have torn him apart to be in London and not be with John.  Mycroft, the idiot, had not failed to mention Mary Morstan, he had excluded her.  He had known about the woman all along, as part of his agreement to keep tabs on John Watson while Sherlock was in his employment.  His brother had sat there in Russia and watched him being beaten for the same reason why he had allowed Sherlock to be tackled by John in the restaurant, because he did not like to get his hands dirty.  He did not want to get involved.  He had no doubt suspected the outcome of that meeting and had no doubt watched in complete enjoyment as John nearly broke his nose with a well-aimed head bunt.
The detective gave a small shrug of his shoulders and then laid a hand against his chest, gently directing John to lay back on the bed.  The doctor complied—why, he could not say—as Sherlock explained, in his matter of fact way, “It’s alright.  I know what I am doing.  I researched how all day while you cleaned up for the party.”
David’s reply was calculated and forthright.  “One expects that someone who acts like a child also has the incapability to comprehend the repercussions of their poor choices…like a child.”
