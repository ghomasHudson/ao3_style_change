“Just this once. I’m his landlady, not his assistant, but Lord knows he doesn’t have the manners to offer you a cup himself.”
John shrugged and followed him into the vehicle. The trip was less than ten minutes, but when they’d reached it, a seemingly clumsy tourist bumped into John and left him with another paper with another intersection named on it. This one was across the city. When they finally arrived, they were met by a man who strongly suggested they follow him into a nearby back alley and through an unmarked, rusted door. The building seemed to be abandoned, the only furniture being the three chairs in the room the man led them to, one chair already occupied.
“Where is she now? What does she do?” John was curious journalistically. He wanted to track her down and get her side of the story. But it was more than that. He wanted to know everything about Sherlock, whether it had to do with the paranormal or not. He wanted to know what formed him, what made him tick, what influenced his actions.
“Keep me safe?” Disbelief and anger warred for dominance on Sherlock’s face. “Why did I need to be kept safe?”
Sherlock’s eyes were red and surrounded by dark smudges. These days, lack of sleep seemed to be the only thing they had in common.
John laughed. As the oldest himself, he understood Mycroft’s need to look after his younger siblings. Still, the man was excessively nosy, and he didn’t blame Sherlock and Eurus for trying to distance themselves from their big brother.
“This one,” Sherlock pointed to what looked like a circle with numbers. “The numbers with the face inside? It’s demonic. An elemental, called Asog, Aka Manah, Grigori.”
he liked Sherlock. Admitting the best friend part had been hard enough. He wasn’t about to give away his last secret. Not when the object of his affection was a self-proclaimed sociopath who was married to his work. And especially not when John’s own sexuality was something he kept close to the vest. The challenges of being out had driven Harry to drink. He wasn’t going to let the same thing happen to him. Maybe if Sherlock was– But no. He wasn’t outing himself just for the hell of it.
The door squeaked as it opened, though there was no usual accompanying bang of the door being shoved against the wall. Instead, it squeaked closed again, and there was quiet shuffling as Sherlock’s feet crept across the floor. The covers pulled away, the other side of the mattress dipped, and Sherlock sighed as he slid into bed.
“Well, she mentions an exorcism partway through the video, so she thinks she found one. And some odd stuff does happen.”
“Those aren’t just numbers.” Simon taunted. The sound of someone moving quickly down the hall drew his attention to the door. “They’re coming to tell you about Trent.”
John woke abruptly when something dropped on his legs. He squinted at his phone. “Four-forty, really, Sherlock? What the
He sat back down in the chair, trying to decide what to do next. Some small talk with Mrs. Hudson was interrupted by Sherlock’s return. He loomed from the doorway, staring at John, who kept his face placid while waiting to see what the strange man would say.
“So we’ve got the face from Sammy’s room, the numbers from Simon’s room, pentagrams from both, and some new symbols and numbers. They
.” John was amazed to see Sherlock acting so … so human. And a little flattered, to be honest. He’d seen him reciprocate friendly feelings before, but this was big, this was real.
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it again. Looked away, then back. He nodded. “And you’re not just saying this to get me to agree to work with Simon.”
John knew it was a respite, that they’d be spurred into action again soon whether they liked it or not, so he savored those quiet, easy days. He made himself a mind cupboard, where he neatly stacked memories on shelves—Sherlock playing his violin, mocking the television, heavily marking up forensic journals to send back to the editors; the two of them giggling over dumb stories in the paranormal world; Mrs. Hudson smiling softly at them across the table as they took tea with her. One day, he simply stood in the sitting room and closed his eyes so he could take in the sounds and smells of their flat—dust, chemicals, buttery popcorn from a film marathon the evening before, cars wooshing down the street, Mrs. Hudson hoovering downstairs, Sherlock muttering while angrily tapping at his keyboard (probably debunking another myth on a message board).
ride. You deserve for the world to continue as it has been, people being born, and people dying, laughter and love and sex and parties and books and art and everything that’s come to signify humanity.
The video continued with the couple arguing over whether someone had fallen, then the camera zoomed in on an empty field under where the figure had last been seen. “Shit,” he muttered, then, realizing how close he was to his flatmate, he stood upright and removed his hand from Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock shared a look with John. They were both in the hallway and down the corridor before Fred could catch up. Trent was being wheeled out on a stretcher when they arrived, but Sherlock didn’t stop to study him, instead entering the room. Behind his door and above his bed were more of the strange numbers and symbols, but bigger. The pentagram took up most of the space behind his door. Sherlock was snapping pictures as quickly as his phone would allow, muttering while he did so.
John’s ears perked up, remembering his talk with the professor at Bath, and Percival Black’s disappearance after having been seen in the area. “Boulder Field?” he asked, naming the location the professor had given him.
And now they were home again. Eurus hopefully bundled up in chilly Glasgow, and he and Sherlock at 221B, where they belonged. The fire crackled merrily, as if to remind him how good they had it. Not that he needed reminding.
Holmes studied it closely, turning it over in his hands as he spoke. “An expensive mobile. Not yours, going by the engraving on the back, so given to you by someone. Harry
John relaxed at the words. He was beginning to be able to tell when Sherlock was truthful with his words and emotions and when he was playing someone. He seemed genuine this time. And it wasn’t as if John was unable to relate.
“What if Simon is one of them, and us showing up in Sofia slots us neatly into a trap? Hmm? What then?”
Sherlock set up a laptop at his desk, and John took a seat next to him, leaning over so they were both on the screen. He was close enough to get a whiff of spice from Sherlock’s aftershave. It smelled nice. A ringing came from the laptop speakers, and Sherlock accepted the call.
They were at some Chinese restaurant enjoying a post-case meal. It was the best food John had eaten since returning to London. He wasn’t sure if the food was that good—though according to Sherlock it was the best Chinese in Central London (according to the bottom third of the door handle)—or if it was the events leading up to it that made it taste so good. He hadn’t felt this alive since he’d been shot. And, if he was being honest, for several years before that. He’d grown jaded with his old work. It was important, and he’d been happy to do it because the truth needed to get to the public, but his heart hadn’t been in it for a while. But this was new. Different. Fun. Fascinating. Much like the man sitting across from him.
In the end, he only thought on it for a few hours. It wasn’t war correspondence, but it would keep him occupied, fed, and in the only city worth being in if the front lines weren’t an option. He’d called Mike the next morning and was hired on the spot. It was only after he’d gone into the office a few days later that he found out that Mike oversaw the
Sherlock’s argument wasn’t going to stop him from researching further into Scriabin or Percival Black. Looked like a long day of research ahead of him.
He almost walked out a second time when he interviewed his first subject, a woman who had written dozens of books on the paranormal (and some erotica he’d rather have been left in the dark about). She invited him along on a case to investigate a haunting. He didn’t know what the truth was concerning the supposed event, but he knew the answer wasn’t little ghosties. It was a colossal waste of time, and Mike would be getting an earful from him as soon as he made it back to the office.
“Nothing so dramatic,” Simon replied. “I simply got to the point where I was no longer a boon to the Order. I could let myself die—by the Order’s hand or by the world ending—or I could hide and try to stop them. Self preservation.” He shrugged nonchalantly.
“You’re correct,” Simon said. “I could have sent you pictures. This site is not relevant to the Order of the Cenophus’s current goals.”
“He talked to me, Simon did, while he was choking me. He told me he didn’t like it when I prayed and that he had to stop me. It was the same voice that said, ‘I like your drawings.’ Not to mention,” he added with a glare at Sherlock, “all I had to do was describe what my attacker looked like. The staff were the ones who said it was Simon.”
It was as if Simon’s call unlocked something. Their peaceful, homey center of the storm had passed. It started with their dreams. They got worse. It was harder to calm each other in their sleep. They had a harder time returning to sleep too. It was easier to bear, though, with a bedmate. Instead of meeting in the sitting room for tea and violin, they often stayed in bed, holding each other and whispering. Sherlock opened up about his childhood. Not about the tall men, but the years when he'd loved Eurus and Mycroft without a care. Childhood experiments. His dog, Redbeard. John in return talked about the war, and how he got there from being a journalism student.
“The last thing I need is another sibling sticking their nose in my business. I’ve already got Mycroft taking you away on a regular basis.”
“Coffee shop, really John? Little cliché, isn’t it? And why do you need to date anyway? It’s ridiculous.”
John snorted. “I can imagine. Well, let me get you my research and a few of the scarlet files to take back to your hotel. Tea?”
“Hmmm. There’s loads of mythology surrounding it, as you noted. But I researched it for well over a month, and the origins of the urban legend bits seem to have begun with a scientific outpost in Antarctica in 1962. They were recording and cataloging electromagnetic waves, and in the process picked up an odd audio wave pattern. At first, they thought it was a whale stranded under the ice, or the wind, or electromagnetic waves themselves. They were unable to look further into it, though, because they all died.”
“Right. Yes.” They moved back in front of John’s laptop on the sofa. “Let’s continue?” said Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” he said lowly, rolling to his side and putting his hand gently on his friend’s arm. Sherlock did not react. He tried again, a little more firmly. “Sherlock. It’s alright. You’re safe.” Sherlock’s hand came up to grip John tightly. His palm was sweaty. “Sherlock. It’s John. I’ve got you. You’re safe. It’s just a dream.” He kept murmuring until Sherlock let out a sigh, his grip loosened, and his body stilled.
Robert’s face tightened. “She said she saw someone standing over his bed, Sammy's bed. Someone … someone very tall and very thin, his head almost touched the ceiling. She screamed, and then turned on the light to get a better look, and it disappeared.”
It was the expression that allowed John to let the chuckle free from his throat. After a moment, Holmes joined him, his laughter deeper, smoother than John’s almost giggle.
“I just … I want the things that happen around me to have meaning. To not be just random happenstance or a weird coincidence. I need to believe in something.”
“How long did this go on?” John asked, feeling a thrill at the story. This was far more interesting than he’d expected, even after all he knew about, and experienced around, Sherlock.
Just then a tall man strode through the open door, long coat streaming after him. “Ah, Mrs. Hudson. I need the files on the Sagamore case. Donovan keeps hounding me about it, and I want–”
“You’re my mate, my flatmate. You’re …” John looked away, not able to face Sherlock while he admitted some of his own feelings. His voice went quiet. “You’re my best friend. I like living and working with you. I mean, you have your problems, but so do I. This life we lead, as weird as it is, is worth it.
Demands died in his throat when his eyes landed on the walls, two of which were completely covered with paper and string. It was just like every conspiracy wall he’d seen in films and on television.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirked. “One million pounds is a lot of money, and humans are highly susceptible to apophenia.”
At first the paintings looked like a ritual or battle of some sort. There were black stick figures surrounding one figure that was taller than the rest. It took a couple of pictures for John to see it. The main figure’s face was upside down, just like the face symbol on Simon and Trent’s walls, just like the one at the cabin Sammy was found in.
Fred Barnes met them in the lobby and led them to the south wing, where Simon’s room sat. “He’s with his therapist now. I thought you might want to see his room before talking with him,” Barnes explained, pushing open the door.
In which Halloween is avoided, they go to Bath for the final showdown, Eurus makes ick faces when the boys get mushy, and they somehow avert the apocalypse.
“Sammy,” Sherlock cut in, leaning into John’s space. John didn’t shift away. “Where is Tall Paul now?”
When he awoke, it was almost four hours later, according to the clock. The room was dark and quiet, and he wasn’t sure what had woken him until he realized Sherlock was restless next to him. He was on his back now, and his hands and legs twitched, his head tossing back and forth on the pillow. John waited to see if he’d wake, but he didn’t. When he started breathing hard and whimpering, John decided to intervene.
It was Robert’s turn to raise his eyebrows, though he said nothing, instead going straight into his tale.
Sherlock started the video from just before the woman’s exclamation. The top of the tower was out of view, so John couldn’t see the start of it, but just before the camera zoomed in, he caught a dark figure falling from the tower. “That’s Glushka too?”
He was back to being in a good mood by the time the cab rounded the corner to his block of flats. He was getting ready to offer his goodbyes when the smell of smoke and something in his peripheral vision caught his eye.
“Also, why’d you start off mentioning yesterday, and talking about watching me like a hawk for my Unsound death—which didn’t happen, you’ll note. You said the post was only going to be published if you died. You couldn’t watch me like a hawk if you were already dead.”
In which John runs into Stamford, gets a job, despairs over his job, and meets a very intriguing (and handsome) paranormal investigator.
A little spark of warmth always lit in John’s chest to hear the “we” Sherlock used when talking to someone during a case. John did very little on this end of things, but Sherlock always acted like it was a team effort.
In which sleepless nights lead to conversation, Feelings(TM) are announced, and John gains a bedmate.
Sherlock held out his hand, so John tossed his mobile the short distance between their chairs. Things had been fairly calm between them since they’d discussed their friendship a few days before. There was still some tension as Sherlock continued to avoid even mentioning the Order of the Cenophus, the Unsound, or anything even tangentially related to either. John had kept his latest research and the correspondence with Eurus on the DL—not lying, but not mentioning it to him either. They needed some peace right now. He had a feeling it was the calm before the storm. Which might be ending, now that Simon had asked to meet.
Sherlock has several files on his laptop dedicated to Rosie’s physical and mental development—charts with information from check-ups, lists of what she should be doing at a certain age, tests to give her. If John didn’t know better, he’d think Rosie was merely an experiment, a new puzzle that had caught his genius’s interest, but he’s seen the way he behaves around his daughter. There is pride when she learns new things and happiness when she reaches new milestones. Sherlock loves Rosie, and John’s never been happier.
“Some days. Others it’s wading through old newspapers or talking to batshit conspiracy theorists or sneezing your way through fifteen boxes of useless tchotchkes from 1967.”
It felt revealing to say it, but in this liminal space, that didn’t bother him. In fact, it felt more right than anything he’d said since they’d met. Sherlock relaxed further and nodded. He positioned his violin and bow and began to play again. John listened for the rest of the night.
“Mr. Watson. Leave it.” The words were so cold and yet somehow so desperate that they made John pause his exit from Mycroft’s office.
He thinks about asking, to move back to Baker Street that is. Empirically, evidence says Sherlock will acquiesce, even be happy about it. He never seems upset to have them around, rarely becomes impatient with having a child in the house, seems happy so often these days. Still, John worries. This is still a part-time thing for them, this living at Baker Street. What if they move in, and two months later, John is itching for something new? Or worse. What if the move makes John happy, but Sherlock dislikes it? He can’t want a child around all the time, can he? He can’t enjoy being stifled from taking interesting cases because there’s a child back home to worry about.
, John thought, remembering one of the symbols he’d seen repeated at different locations over the past year. They looked dazed, like they were sleepwalking. John glanced at Sherlock’s face, worried he’d be pulled in too, but it was clear and determined. He went back to watching the scene unfold in front of him as Sherlock bent to pull out his instrument from the case.
If you made it to the end, congrats! I hope you enjoyed yourself. Thanks for reading, and happy Halloween month. 🎃👻🦇
When John awakes from his nap a few hours later, it’s to the gentle strains of Sherlock’s violin. The pack ‘n play has been set up in the middle of the sitting room. Rosie is still awake, but no longer crying. Instead she’s gumming what turns out to be a teething ring that John knows he didn’t pack. Her eyes drift shut from time to time, but she’s fighting sleep.
For once, John agreed. They shouldn’t bring in any innocent people. It was dangerous enough as it was.
“John?” The word brought him out of his musings, and he stood. Usually when Sherlock was ready to leave, or annoyed, or both, he barked John’s name, ordering him to ‘come along,’ but his name this time sounded tentative, questioning. John looked at his friend, still standing a few feet away. He looked … vulnerable. Worried. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his fingers played with the cuffs of his coat, his brow creased.
Sherlock slumped back against the sofa and rubbed his face. “Just being in the same room as her for ten minutes is exhausting.” John chortled, and Sherlock opened his eyes to glare at John. “What?”
Simon huffed. “I believe I have found the correct combination to render their geometry useless. Nothing can be done until the moments before they attempt to open the portal. We’ll need someone to act as a distraction while someone else changes the symbols they plan to paint on the field in Bath.”
Apparently, a monk called Herman did something bad enough that the rest of the monks in his monastery wanted to wall him up alive. He, a talented artist, talked them into giving him a year to create the most beautiful bible ever. Because a normal bible took around twenty years to make at that time, he supposedly made a deal with the devil to help him create it in a year. It ended up not being the actual bible, but rather just several books from the Latin bible and some historical texts, and it was called the Codex Gigas. Because of its great beauty, he was allowed to live. When the order was in financial trouble a few years later, the bible was sold, and Herman fell ill and died soon after.
Simon pull a USB drive out of his pocket and proffered it. When Sherlock refused to take it, John sighed and grabbed it himself. “This better not have a virus on it,” he muttered.
“It’s a portal, isn’t it?” John asked Sherlock, who’d come to stand next to him again, and John thought he could feel warmth even through their layers.
John snorted, pointing at the covered wall in front of them. “Looks like you followed his advice real good.”
“I didn’t have a nightmare last night. First time in ages. It’s nice to be rested up for once.” He passed the jam jar to Sherlock and accepted the teapot from Sherlock in turn.
“I meant to … Sorry … Mess … I was going to … Sorry.” He darted into the lounge and began grabbing things.
The whole building was up in flames, and two fire engines blocked the road directly in front of the fire. Luckily it was a quiet area in general, so traffic wasn’t too backed up.
—can prove they’re not real, then there’s nothing you can’t do. You’ll be the top in your field. Everyone will come to you for help.”
John had clambered out of bed during the explanation and began dressing, after which he took out several shirts he never wore that Sherlock had added to his bag, instead dropping in his favorite jumper and a few more comfortable shirts. Sherlock glared but allowed it, stepping back to let John finish packing himself.
“You didn’t like him?” He tried to be casual in asking, but with her sidelong look, he knew he hadn’t succeeded.
He waved his bow about, then positioned it to return to playing. “God knows. The usual things he does. Rule the world, stop and start small wars, keep eldritch horrors from rising from the deep. You know, government stuff.”
“I want to help! My brother is in trouble with some really weird stuff. Mycroft has apparently fucked off on the whole thing, which leaves me. You may not want a third Holmes sibling, but you damn sure are getting one. You need me.”
Both men froze, and Eurus laughed. “You two share a job and a flat. You’ve recently figured out you sleepwalk, Sher, so I’m guessing you share a bed.”
“It didn’t take me long moving in paranormal circles to grow tired of the ersatz drama that surrounds the field,” Sherlock explained, hands curled around his mug, eyes trained on the folder. “Most cases were also far too easy to figure out. There were obvious signs, if you knew where to look. When my grandmother died and left me a sizeable inheritance …”
Far too many hours later, they’d arrived in California, dropped their things at their hotel, and gone to the Los Gatos police station. Sherlock talked with the head detective as well as Sammy’s parents. There wasn’t much more to learn about his actual disappearance, but photos of the boys’ loo, the hallway, the cloakroom he’d been in before he was taken all proved there was no way the boy could have left apart from the hallway where a teacher waited for him.
I’ll be back next week with the first file. A story about two young boys, decades apart, but with the same mysterious, one might even say creepy, background. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
John stopped just inside the door, watching the landlady prepare tea (not the housekeeper indeed) as Sherlock hummed but otherwise continued to ignore them. As the kettle clicked off, his head shot up. “Oh, John!” He twisted in his seat, his eyes widening, and John gave a small nod.
“Everything. Your research, the cases, Sherlock. I got caught up on your blog this week, did some digging of my own. I know things are getting … dicey.”
His hypothesis proved correct. They found Sammy sitting alone in the previously abandoned cabin with no memory of anything that had occurred between his abduction and being found. He was confused and scared, but healthy and whole.
John shrugged. “She’s fun. She’s like … a more upbeat version of you. And she knows all your childhood secrets. Like the time you stripped naked and–”
who refuses to pay out his reward, despite having a number of cases unsolved.” He rubbed his temple.
A half thought slips past John’s lips before he can wrangle it. “Or I could–” He stops it so suddenly his teeth click.
“Yeah.” John sighed. “I didn’t mean … I never meant to do that to him. This all started out as a fluff piece, but it turned out to be far more complex than I expected. Than even he expected, I think.”
John was contemplating leaving the house again when the noise stopped. He sighed in relief and went to make some tea. The tea earlier had done no good to wake him up. Though he was still annoyed, he put out a cup for his irritating flatmate as well.
Simon tilted his head. “Mr. Holmes. Mr. Watson. Thank you for joining me. You want to ask me about the drawings.”
And so he ends up at the newly renovated Baker Street—Rosie clutched in one arm, overnight bag in the other—unsure if he’ll be welcomed, but hopeful none-the-less. Sherlock has always welcomed them before. John hopes he hasn’t imagined that Sherlock is more than welcoming, actually; he hopes Sherlock is happy they are there.
“But if we don’t,” John continued, shooting Sherlock a stern look when he opened his mouth. “If something happens during the ceremony or, I dunno, the train malfunctions and we all die a fiery death before we even get to Bath, I just need you to know something.”
John nodded, though his stomach twisted. He decided to get back to their original topic. “So, you think your mum had something to do with you and Sherlock seeing the tall men, but you don’t know what. What else can you tell me about your … gifts?”
Things went quiet for a few months. John and Sherlock fought over something else and made up, and fought and made up, and fought and made up. They didn’t seem capable of just having a normal friendship. But they
She pretended to consider a moment before walking into his arms. “Good luck,” she whispered in his ear. “And you better fucking live. I was looking forward to having someone my height in the family.”
“I’m difficult to fool. I understand the latest in technology, and I can tell when people lie. He seemed truthful, especially considering he never demanded payment.”
like the latter, but John was probably inserting his own hopes and feelings onto the situation. Sherlock didn’t feel things that way. And that was fine. Really, it was. He shook his head and looked away.
“I don’t even know if there’s anything to do. For all I know, this is an elaborate hoax to get back at
“Indistinguishable from magic, yeah. I’ve read Clarke. But I’m okay with humans having myths when technology hasn’t advanced enough yet, okay? Let me have my stories.”
“And I’m sorry, for being so harsh. I do understand the sentiment after all. God, the times I saw my story subjects as some staged play rather than real people.” He shook his head, looked out the window, and rubbed a finger over his lips. “Some days I think that bullet was a blessing in disguise. I’d forgotten why I went into war correspondence in the first place. More than anything, I wanted to help, but somewhere along the way, I lost that. But now, thanks to you, I feel useful again. I feel like I’m doing good. Well, moments like this afternoon aside.” He turned to face Sherlock again now that the emotional stuff was done. “What do you think happened? That was not a woman committing suicide. I mean, the mess, the, the
“So we won’t be seeing a rash of unexplained deaths over the next year?” And beyond that time, considering people were still downloading it.
, rather than away from. You love lording it over everyone else when you prove something is a fake. If this particular trip is a waste of time, then so is your whole life!” John cringed. That came out wrong. He tried to backpedal. “No. Shit, no, Sherlock. I didn’t mean–”
“To warn you off your investigations, Mr. Watson.” Though he addressed John, he didn’t stop staring at Sherlock.
John leaned so their shoulders touched. Sherlock relaxed a little. “He did this often?” John asked. He lifted his mug only to realize it was already empty. He’d need to start a line to send the tea straight to his veins soon. He was getting more sleep, so he didn’t need the caffeine, but the tea made him feel more human.
“Twentieth-century pianist and composer. Russian. Died young. His music isn’t terrible. He was banned from BBC radio because the director thought his compositions were evil.” Sherlock looked like he hoped to someday be banned from the BBC. Knowing him, it wasn’t a surprise or an impossibility.
Sorry, Mike, readers. Instead of weekly special interest stories, for the foreseeable future you’ll have to read about my deep dive into paranormal investigation and the enigmatic debunker leading the charge to solve them.
“And since when do you, Sherlock Holmes, shy away from trouble? More than that, you’re a puzzle solver
“Yes, well nothing.” John tried to say more, but words failed him. “Fuck, I can’t right now.” He turned his eyes back on his phone screen. “You can call the police now, Wolfgang. I am so sorry for getting you involved in this. Truly.”
It’s not that John had expected Sherlock to divulge every childhood friend just because they were flatmates, but he was annoyed at himself for missing this story, huge as it was in making Sherlock who he was as an adult.
,” she said, mimicking her brother’s affectations, if not his voice. “Which doesn’t seem fair,” she continued. “It’s your
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched. Beyond his outburst earlier that day, it was the first emotion John had seen from him in nearly a week. “If it really was Victor, he had to know that asking me to not look means I will instead turn over every stone trying to find him. If it’s really Victor, that means he actually wants me to find him but can’t say so.”
She winked at him. “You love me.” Then she turned to Sherlock, who froze, affrighted. She softened her gaze. “Please, Sher. Just once. Just in case.” Her voice broke on the final word.
“Your wife believes these shadows are more than what they are. The burden of proof lies with whomever is claiming the existence of something outside the natural world. She's bending reality to her preconceived ideas, she's seeing these shadows around Sammy because she expects to see them.”
They moved down to Sherlock’s room that night. As John sleepily made his way to the bathroom, Sherlock offhandedly announced from the desk—where he was four folders deep into some unknown research—that his ridiculously posh sheets were clean. John, not wanting to ruin the moment by actually acknowledging anything, hummed vaguely, went to brush his teeth, then climbed into Sherlock’s (their?) bed. He slid smoothly over said ridiculously posh sheets and snuggled under the covers with a smile.
Eurus didn’t start having the nightmares, but she picked up their mood the longer she stayed. They were all irritable and short with each other. The sibling bickering turned into yelling fights, with one or both of them storming out of the room. John learned to leave the flat at such times. He’d visit Mrs. Hudson or go for a walk in the park. The autumn air was crisp and bracing after the stifled atmosphere of the flat, and the slowly turning leaves were a welcome sight. And, of course, there were the days when he and Sherlock fought, which also pushed him out of their home, usually with a stomachache or a headache. He’d spend hours walking the park, wearing thin the same paths.
In which the boys go on a bit of a scavenger hunt, meet up with Simon, and learn more about the upcoming apocalypse.
Simon nodded. “For the most part, yes, except this one here. It’s the trickiest. It’ll be the last to be changed, replacing it with these three here.”
John’s eyebrows went up. He’d not seen the man so flustered yet. Bad day? Frustrating case? He watched Sherlock flutter around the room, stacking folders together, shoving tapes in drawers, closing laptops.
John shrugged. “Who knows. Maybe you’d have inspired me to write even as a doctor.” He shook his head and went back to studying the walls. “So. Thoughts?”
“Hmm?” Sherlock was elbow-deep in the advice columns he found so deeply amusing. His toast was clamped between his teeth, forgotten. John smiled.
Eurus laughed, her eyes crinkling endearingly. “You’ve got spunk. Definitely a good trait in anyone who wants to survive around Sherlock. I’ve been up late every night doing research. What’s your excuse?”
The flat was chilly—John had found Sherlock standing in front of an open window, staring blankly out, no memory of getting out of bed nor how long he’d been there—and so they were on the sofa huddled under a blanket for warmth. Before John could extricate himself from both Sherlock’s limbs and the quilt, the sitting room door opened, revealing Eurus, holding two bags.
“It wasn’t me!” Despite the accusation, John squirmed back into position under the blanket next to Sherlock, who put an arm around him (to maximize sharing of body warmth, of course).
Wolfgang turned his phone to face the door, which he pushed open. It was dark inside apart from what light came through a window. The place looked worse than their flat before John had moved in. Furniture was overturned, and paper littered the room.
to be a reason John had been contacted, and he didn’t think it was an obsessive fan out to make trouble. He resolved to keep looking into it as quietly as possible.
“Mother’s funeral.” She rolled her eyes when John widened his in surprise. “Of course he didn’t tell you. Yes, both of our parents are dead. Dad a decade back, Mother three years ago. I reckon you didn’t know that Sherlock took after Mother then, either. She studied the occult, though she did it from a tenured archeology position at a university, rather than as an independent consultant. We didn’t see her much as children.”
“Uh yeah,” Fred began, twisting his hands together. “Well, the staff’s. We thought it would cause more problems if we left it—acting out, episodes, the like.”
Eurus rolled her eyes. “You should have seen him as a teenager. Summers home from school were terrible.”
Sherlock rose and went to his violin, rosining the bow and laying out his sheet music. He began with the new section he was working on, one that was particularly unpleasant to hear.
Their two years living together were normal until a few weeks before the end, when Black started leaving the flat after midnight. Being outside the usual routine, his flatmate finally followed him one night when he happened to come home just as Black was leaving. Black walked through a bit of woods and into a field, where his flatmate had lost him. The next morning, there was a note from Black saying he was leaving and would send people to collect his things later. The flatmate never saw him again.
John sat up, putting his elbows on his raised knees and rubbing his face. He looked at the clock. Five-fucking-thirty.
It took some effort, but I finally convinced him to let me take a look at one of his files. Unfortunately, much to Mike’s chagrin, this story will take far too many words to tell, and I’m limited on space. Somehow. On the internet … Fortunately, Mike’s agreed to let me expand this into next week’s post. And the one after that. We’ll see how long I can keep this up, but given the number of scarlet files and my own journalistic curiosity, I think I can stretch this out pretty far. Thank God.
“Does it actually look like a figure,” Sherlock contested, “or is that what you’re seeing because of the context?”
“There’s something else, something Robert doesn’t know about,” Maria confessed after she and Sherlock had backed off. She picked up her laptop and walked down a hall into a room decorated for a young boy—Sammy’s room. She opened the cupboard door and moved some clothes out of the way, then pointed the laptop camera at it.
He leaned back and let out a breath of relief. Crisis averted. He didn’t realize his hand was still resting on Sherlock’s forearm until he wiggled, trying to get comfortable in the terrible airline seat. John let go in surprise, his palm warm where it had lain against Sherlock’s arm.
,” Sherlock insisted. “Just some madmen being idiots. Not so hard to defeat.” There was a tiny quirk of a smile at the end of the pronouncement.
John tried to remember what Sherlock had said when they’d talked about it. John’s post was from February. He’d said … it was a couple or so months before that? It was possible. “I’m guessing November. Last year.” He and Eurus shared a glance. “Sherlock, who knew when you listened to it?”
It’s getting harder to deal face the space issue, though. Three months in, and John and Rosie spend more time at Baker Street than they do in Chiswick. John’s wardrobe at the flat is full again, toys have ended up in places outside of the sitting room (John once found a stuffed animal in one of the kitchen cabinets and has no idea how it got there), the refrigerator is full of veg instead of body parts.
We’ve moved beyond creepy now. It’s no longer teenagers writing things on their walls and claiming to teleport. It’s not a mysterious order of monks who refuse to talk about their beliefs. Now, the shit is real, and it’s scary. This isn’t the first kidnapping Sherlock has investigated, but it’s the first where we knew the child beforehand, and the first Sherlock couldn’t figure out. Don’t worry, the child is safe, but we still don’t know who took him or why.
“Simple. The Order still wants Mr. Holmes here, despite his intractability and lack of training. Without him, they have a harder time of reaching their goal in time. Add on that he’s a genius and thus will strongly benefit whichever side he chooses, and the answer becomes obvious.”
“These symbols are very specific. Someone's knowledge of ancient Sumerian, and this type of script in particular, is fairly comprehensive. It's clear that whoever drew them has more than surficial knowledge of sacred geometry and ancient occultism.”
With a head shake that almost seemed sad, Sherlock huffed. “If only. It’s more complicated than that, John.”
“She does short stories mostly. Stuff you’d find in literary journals and anthologies. She’s not really into the mass market scene.”
Just as John was falling asleep, he heard Sherlock whisper, “I love you more than life itself, John Watson.” Then he felt a soft pressure on his lips before Sherlock cuddled him closer.
They climbed to the first floor, which looked a bit like the aftermath of a tornado. Books and folders littered every free space. They were stacked haphazardly on shelves and tables, along with VHS tapes, two televisions, three laptops, numerous electronic equipment John couldn’t name, and even some floppy discs. A desk was buried under more paraphernalia, watched over by a cow skull wearing headphones.
“Sherlock, what’s going on?” John led him to the bed and sat beside him, handing him the sandwich he’d made.
Things grew even more tense, and John knew they’d have a hard time getting much more out of their interviewee. After a few more questions about further events and the Torres’ split, they ended the call.
Luckily, I’ve made some new acquaintances since I started writing this blog series, and I moved into a new flat within twenty minutes of seeing the old one burn. This is where the full disclosure comes in. My new flatmate is one Sherlock Holmes. Yes, that Sherlock Holmes, the one I wrote about in my last post (as if there could be anyone else with that name). He happened to be dropping me off when we saw the burning building, and he offered the spare room at his. He’d been looking for a flatmate anyway, and I wasn’t about to turn down cheap rent in Central London, so I agreed to move in. So now you know. On with the actual case.
In which nightmares are discussed, everybody bickers, bedswapping happens, and Sherlock makes a decision about the apocalypse.
Sherlock scoffed over the idea that there was a reason to worry. “He was a troubled young man who wanted the world to suffer with him.”
The message was from a healthcare manager who worked at Nether Edge Hospital who had seen something he thought would be right up Sherlock’s street. John called the man, a Fred Barnes, back, then took the details to Sherlock.
writing an article on the man. The more exciting it was, the better for his image. Perhaps it would even mean an uptick in cases. But was it more than that? There was definitely something crackling between them. A good potential partnership at the least. Understanding. Chemistry. John wasn’t ready to figure out what that meant exactly.
“I don’t think I can ever leave you either,” said Sherlock, referencing John’s own words from a few nights before. “I think I’d die without you.”
Sherlock tossed his head. “Of course I do. It was touted as a children’s science show back when we were young. The new ones have leaned hard into the drama, though. Not nearly so exciting.”
Sherlock ran his hands over his face and closed his eyes. “I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense. She was supposed to be a lone wolf, someone trying to spook a family for some strange reason, but one that was her own. But this? This proves she didn’t work alone. Which means something more sinister is going on. But
Simon raised an eyebrow, and only then did John notice the dark circles under the young man’s eyes. “Possible, then.”
What the hell had just happened? Who the hell was Sherlock Holmes? What the hell had John got himself into with this interview?
Even now, part of me hopes it’s all a grand hoax perpetrated to get back at the berk who goes around ruining everyone’s fun by disproving paranormal events. Because if it is a hoax, then I can be sure that not only will Sherlock live to see 8
“Is it really so difficult to believe? I didn’t tell you who Mycroft was the first time he kidnapped you. He and I wouldn’t even be on speaking terms if he didn’t track my every move. He tracks hers, too, and keeps each of us informed if anything monumental happens to the other, but that’s our only contact these days.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stood up. John stayed seated a moment longer, studying the young man across from him. He was an arsehole, creepy, and probably untrustworthy, but he was also the only one—aside from Victor—who had offered them any sort of explanation. He didn’t want to believe a word the man said, but did he really have a choice? If there was even a chance that children would die if they didn’t find a way to stop the Order …
Sherlock had joined him in the first place? Was it an experiment? Was he just trying to get rid of the dreams, or was it related to their conversation the night before last? He took the coward’s way out and skirted around direct mention.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft as he approached John. “Please. Leave. I need– I can’t–” He shook his head in what looked like defeat.
I know I’ve said it before, but now I know it’s one hundred percent true. It’s more than my sleep deprivation. It’s more than just coincidence. The universe cannot be that fucking lazy. Sherlock. He’s like the others. He’s one of the kids.
John returned home one afternoon from one of his excursions to find Sherlock alone in the sitting room, composing again. Without much else to keep him busy, music occupied much of his time those days. John settled into his chair with his computer in hopes of churning out one last post. Halloween was two days away, making Bath three days out. They were all antsy. He procrastinated by checking Facebook and both Sherlock’s and his email accounts. These days he mostly used his work account, he but kept the personal one for family and former colleagues to keep in touch. Not that anyone ever did, because John was shit about replying, so the concerned emails from work mates had slowly tapered off. Other than junk mail, there was a single new message from an unknown address. He clicked it open.
John wrinkled his brow. Interesting how Eurus was so much more up front about everything. He wished he’d found her earlier. Maybe his investigations would be further along than they were.
“Sherlock,” John cut in. “We can’t stop her. And she’s right, she could be helpful to have with us.”
“Oh. Good.” John wasn’t sure how he felt about this. He was glad there was a least one mystery done with, one less thing to distract and distress Sherlock. But at the same time, there was this little ball of jealousy that formed in his stomach any time Victor was mentioned.
“I don’t have an ability,” Sherlock argued, but he sounded desperate, like he was trying to convince himself. John leaned in so their arms touched. Sherlock pressed in closer.
Sherlock grumbled, then voluntarily went to answer the street door when the bell rang, signaling the arrival of their food.
He worked on his post for a few more minutes before he was distracted by his phone trying to vibrate off the desk. He grabbed it and answered.
John set a cup of tea next to Sherlock’s hip on the desk, then settled into his chair while he watched his partner play. He breathed in the earthy scent of his tea and sighed. Yes, they’d beat the bad guy, and they had all lived to tell the tale. Which they couldn’t actually
“But those people write their request or argument. This email was empty save for the video, and the email address was just a string of numbers. Even the subject line was empty. Doesn’t seem like they want more than to confuse or scare me.”
That’s all for this week. I’ll be back soon with another tale. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
Pushing at Sherlock’s elbow to get him to take a bite of his sandwich, John shoved aside the sleep deprivation to think about it. Everything they’d encountered so far seemed connected, even though Sherlock refused to believe it. Was this him taking his first step to admitting the connections did exist? And what
As one, the three of them turned to the field. The children were being led to form a large circle around the stand of boulders.
portion of the magazine. Sure, John’d written up columns that had ended up on websites, but it was still serious writing, done by actual adults. In his new job, he’d be working with kids half his age, using a language that was beyond him, and talking about subjects far below his old pay grade.
This is the creepiest chapter in the story. If you’re a wimp like me, maybe read this during the day time. ;) If you make it past this chapter, it goes more into conspiracy territory rather than horror. Much safer.
friends. And John was happier than he’d been in ages. Between the scarlet files and new cases that came Sherlock’s way from the Met and their respective blogs, they stayed busy.
“Uh, left a window open. The heater should warm it up soon,” John half admitted. The kettle clicked off, and he went to finish the tea tray.
John smiled. “Ah, of course.” He cleared his throat. “So, Glushka. A mysterious place with mysterious falling figures and a mysterious event that caused the monks to call in an outsider.”
“Fred Barnes just called. They couldn’t find Simon at curfew last night, and he hasn’t turned up yet.”
“You’re an interesting man, Mr. Holmes,” was out of his mouth before he had time to stop it. God. Now he’d look like a groupie.
“‘I’m tired of taking their orders. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, stay vigilant. I’ll be in touch.’”
John snorted, but nixed the grin when Sherlock shot him a look simultaneously confused and quelling.
John threw up his hands. “What else was I supposed to think? I have no need to know about him unless you decide to tell me. So the only reason someone has for sending a mysterious text is if it has to do with the blog.”
“Of course the Codex is a part of it too,” John muttered. He held up his hand before anyone could argued. “I know, I know, Cenophus origins. It just seems like
“If that’s the last of the theatrics, we’ll be on our way,” Sherlock said dully, his face impassive.
The next morning over breakfast, John broke their tacit rule and mentioned their sleepless nights and nightmares. He wanted to tell Sherlock he’d had a nightmare, but didn’t want to put him on the spot, so he brought up his own.
“Me. I say.” Sherlock dropped onto the bed next to John. “I don’t like having my life displayed for the world to gossip about.”
Sherlock turned to John wide-eyed. “You think Victor’s disappearance led to my going into paranormal investigation and then being given these very specific, seemingly disparate cases over the last few years that you’re convinced are actually connected?”
“What’s what?” John doubted his expression was sufficiently innocent for Sherlock, but there was no way he’d tell him what he’d just learned from Simon. Sherlock could never know.
Next week, we dive into another scarlet file and investigate the Unsound. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
I say succeeded, but Holmes would disagree, and he has yet to pay out the reward to anyone. Despite that, he has a few files, you see. In a cabinet full of the usual beige files are a few that stand out. They’re a deep red. You might call them scarlet. I asked him why the different colour. With a frown and a glare through his flat’s lounge-cum-office window onto the busy streets of London below, he paused before replying.
“Why don’t you just take over,” he growled, more harshly than he’d intended. He stood and turned to hand his computer to Sherlock, who looked at him in confusion.
“Research. Sherlock’s not the only Holmes with a mythology degree. And I’m less likely to pass off everything I can’t explain as fake.”
Sherlock frowned as he applied jam to his toast. “You had two nightmare events last night. You were talking about demons and clocks, and then you tried to climb out of bed. It took me three minutes and twelve seconds to calm you the first time and twenty-eight seconds the second time.”
“He knows my record with the police is ninety-five percent solved. He knows I can find Sammy.” And it was true. The man could have easily been a detective, and John wondered yet again how Sherlock had ended up here instead.
“Not exactly. The first was a boy named Bobby. It was taken almost thirty years ago in Pennsylvania. The second was from three years ago in San Francisco. The groom’s name is Robert Torres.”
Knowing when to concede defeat—he’d had months of arguments with Sherlock for practice—John began to tell her the story, from the day he met Sherlock until the meeting with Victor earlier that day. Eurus stayed quiet for the most part, only asking a few questions for clarification. After he finished, she tilted her head contemplatively and stared off into space for a while. Recognizing it from Sherlock’s own stretches of silent thought, John let her be, taking the time to visit the gents’ and order more tea while he waited. When he returned to the table, she was typing furiously on an extra slim, streamlined laptop, frown of concentration firmly on her face.
“Three events with the same symbology. There is no way this is a coincidence.” John frowned back. That earned him a sigh, but no reply. He watched Sherlock continue studying the walls.
John glanced at him. “It might be real, that’s what you’re thinking.” Sherlock glanced sharply at him, but didn’t confirm or deny. “The dreams …”
John made sure he was recording the call. “Robert, can you explain in more depth the events that led you to get in touch with Sherlock? Um, Mr. Holmes?”
“Yes! No. I don’t know.” John sighed. “I know it sounds mad, but it just seems like everything is converging right now.”
They might need to talk about their relationship soon, but John was content to wait a while. He’d stated his own intentions, and Sherlock had shown he was at least amenable to some of John’s wishes. That was enough for the moment.
With a huge sigh, Sherlock pushed himself all the way up. “Fine. It’s extremely dull though. Your readers will hate it.”
that there were demons in our house. She would chant and burn sage. I honestly thought she was gonna have a nervous breakdown.”
John gaped. God, Sherlock was completely oblivious sometimes. “Because she wants to help! Because she’s your
Sherlock spent a few minutes with his magnifier down on his hands and knees, looking at every inch of the room, before sighing dramatically at the lack of evidence and asking to see Trent’s room.
“Still, you have to admit it’s a little too coincidental that we’ve heard about Glushka and a Russian composer who wrote about Faustian bargains within a week of each other.”
Sherlock joined John in his bed around midnight for each of the next five nights. Each night they calmed each other’s nightmares, and each morning they gave only reports on those events, never mentioning Sherlock’s relocation. They learned that John wasn’t the only sleepwalker, and Eurus told them that Sherlock had suffered from somnambulism during childhood as well.
“The place with the cave paintings I showed you pictures of. The ones that looked like a battle or ceremony?” It was nice being the knowledgeable one for once. He tried not to let it go to his head.
Sherlock shuddered a breath out, long and deep. “I … went along with it. Said I’d film her. Make it an investigation. It was fun at the time.” His eyes went hazy and unfocused, as if whatever he was looking at wasn’t in the room. “It’s odd. I believed her. I’d already proven our parents did the Father Christmas thing, and I’d seen no other sign of the paranormal, but she was my sister, my best friend, and she really seemed to believe it herself, so I did too.”
“I thought I’d come back and haunt you.” John swiveled in his chair to face his partner, careful not to jar his injured wrist.
Sherlock’s smile was tremulous. “Perhaps our goal should be to get through tomorrow so we can figure out what this is,” he said, twiddling a finger between them.
. But she mentioned tea, it’s cold, and I want some. If she gets a cup out of it, well, that’s not the end of the world, I reckon.” He paused. “Literally, in this case.”
“Maudlin and overly romantic,” came Sherlock’s voice over John’s shoulder, his breath tickling his ear.
After the kidnapping, the stories about kids and weird happenings multiplied. They received an email from another woman, Phoebe Yi, whose child was the focus of some strange circumstances. Like with Robert and Sammy, seven-year-old Katie Yi’s mother was seeing a mysterious shadow out of the corner of her eye when her daughter was near. Once there was even a thump followed by a broken living room window. Still, John only brought Sherlock on when, after some strange noises coming from Katie’s room, Phoebe found numbers and symbols carved onto her daughter’s bed frame, which had moved several feet across the room even though it was almost too heavy for Phoebe herself to move.
She laughed a little bitterly. “God, no. He hated that he could. He tried to deny it. It was only because I could read him so well that I knew. He might have gone along with the videos and the questions for my sake, but he never admitted in so many words that he could see them too. But I could tell, I saw it in his eyes, the way he’d plead with me to stop. The way his eyes would dart right to the men when they’d appear, then shy away.”
Marie started asking her questions. When she got to “Are you the fallen Brother Ivan?” Sherlock paused the video.
. What John had taken for an electrical buzzing was the sound of hundreds of flies covering the wall. He felt his skin crawl. Then the camera swung around to a dining area. The table had been shoved out of the way, and hanging from the ceiling by what looked like the remains of a ceiling light fixture was a woman. John made an educated guess as to who it was.
“Thought we’d order in. What would you like?” Sherlock peered at him doggedly, as if trying to understand where John had been.
“If this is a trap,” John said, once they’d settled into their seats, trying for the third time to convince Sherlock why this was a good idea, “isn’t it better for us to meet it head on? Better to know exactly who or what we’re up against, rather than letting them skulk the shadows, their motives unexplained?”
It was pretty much what John expected from an in-patient room at a psychiatric facility—neat, with a few books piled tidily on the desk, but not much more in the way of personal effects. A little sterile, but not unexpected.
Sherlock stayed silent, his face set in a scowl, his eyes looking away from John, which meant he didn’t have a good argument and hoped to just out-silence John.
“Oh. You kept it separate because it was special? Like that first pound note every restaurant tacks to their wall by the till?”
John sighed. “I just thought it was fair that my readers had all of the information. There has to be more to his disappearance than you think, if someone felt the need to tell me about it. This way I have people out there thinking things through to come up with an answer.”
“Hmmm.” Her face did the scrunchy thing Sherlock’s did when he wasn’t satisfied with an answer, but she didn’t push. She waited a moment, then continued when John was silent. “So. Update me.”
“I was working late. It was our corporate year end, so I had to get our taxes in order. Except for the night janitor who was working on the floor above me, I was alone in the building. And as I was locking my office door, I heard something coming from the far end of the hallway.”
“It could be someone obsessed with me who—I don’t know—doesn’t like you writing the blog, or just wants to stir up trouble.”
Holmes—Sherlock—settled into his chair and crossed one leg over the other. “Sometimes. Sometimes all I need to do is hear a story or see a recording to deduce the answer. But if necessary, I do visit the site. And yes, usually it doesn’t take long to find the truth.”
One morning, he leaned down to kiss Sherlock’s curly head, and Sherlock caught and held his hand on his shoulder. “Contact Simon. I’m ready to negotiate.”
to see you, Sherlock. Good luck.” He reached across the table, but Sherlock moved his hand out of reach before they could touch.
CW for a gory explanation of an off-scene death and for mention of John’s state of mind before he met Sherlock.
Still, when he’s at the end of his tether, he has no other thought than seeking out his best friend. He’s held off for far too long, not wanting to be weak, not wanting to burden Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t sign up to be a parent, John had. Well. Sort of.
“Life, the universe, and everything,” Simon shot back, extending his arms to encompass the surrounding area.
“Sherlock?” he asked, setting the plate on the bedside table so he could examine the nearest covered wall.
Sorry for the delay in writing, mates. We were busy for a while with cases, travel, and visiting family. I’m back with another tale, though. And I think you’ll really like this one, it’s pretty creepy. We’re going to talk about Ouija boards and something called the ideomotor effect. Now, bear with me. I promise it’s more interesting than the name sounds.
John glanced at Sherlock, who tilted his head but said nothing, before looking back at the screen. “You said you were working alone, so what friend was he talking about?”
Eurus muttered something that might have included the words “flesh” and “end,” but John didn’t let it distract him. Only one Holmes could hold his attention.
Sherlock froze in his seat, but he didn’t back away from the microscope. “I told you why I started my investigations. I wanted to share the truth with people.”
So I’ve become accustomed to the creepiness of some of Sherlock’s cases—both scarlet and otherwise—over the last few months, but for the most part, said creepiness happens before I’m on the scene. My time is usually spent just watching Sherlock cut everyone in the room down. But for once, I got to watch an event unfold before my eyes, or, well, adjacent to them. It was … an experience to the say the least. Maybe it’s just the spookiness invoked by the person we were interviewing, but it feels like it could be real. That maybe the paranormal isn’t as made up as Sherlock would like it to be. I’m man enough to admit that, at the very least, it’s given me a few unsettling dreams.
John put his hand on Sherlock’s arm to stop him. “God. No. Sherlock. Really. That came out all wrong. I
John hummed, looking around the room more closely. With the sofa, fireplace, and attached kitchen, it wasn’t likely an office, or at least not only an office. And Mrs. Hudson said she was a landlady. Apparently, Sherlock’s flat doubled as his workspace. John’s eye was caught by the filing cabinet Sherlock had glanced at when John asked about unsolved cases. He stood and made his way over, glancing to make sure Mrs. Hudson was busy before pulling open the middle drawer.
Today is the last day of Sherlock’s life, if the rumours of the Unsound are to be believed. For my own happiness, I sure hope he lives. I know a part of me will be watching him like a hawk until midnight. It’s funny that a year ago, I would never have believed if someone told me the supernatural existed, and that I would be a part of this world.
“He was about fifteen when it happened. There was a teen who went missing in our village, which, given how small of a community it was, was strange. So he, being the paranormal investigator he’s always been, decided to find him. It took less than an hour for him to find the body. It was by the river, with some weird symbols and ritual-looking objects surrounding the kid.”
He hadn’t told Sherlock where he was going, but he wasn’t surprised he’d figured it out. He was getting used to living with a genius who could figure out what you’d done that day just by the state of your shoelaces. His hackles went up far less these days when he was deduced. He was actually starting to like it. He could be lazy and just let Sherlock deduce everything rather than take the time to explain things.
He decided to leave the annoying man out of the conversation. “You say you can identify whether a case is a purposeful misdirection or just a strange case of unexplained phenomena within ten minutes of the events being presented to you.”
“You’re not the only one they want. You’re the main one, sure, but not the only. Sammy. Katie. Little Kurt.” Simon’s voice held a mocking note, but he seemed to be serious. “Children around the world will be taken from their parents, sacrificed for a cause.”
“He said he could see me working in my office from the second floor, directly across the courtyard from my office. He said he saw two of us in my office, me and ‘the tall man.’”
Yup, you read that right. We. Along with moving into the upstairs room of Sherlock’s flat, I’ve also taken on the role of his old team in helping him investigate paranormal cases. So, this series of blog posts will no longer be me investigating Sherlock Holmes, but instead will be the two of us looking further into the scarlet file cases, along with anything new that comes our way. I don’t know how long this series will last, but I’m grateful that Mike was amenable to the switch in topic. For now, expect weekly updates for the foreseeable future.
“Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea before heading out. I’ll text when I have time for that interview.” The man dashed down the stairs, leaving John’s head in a whirl.
Sherlock hunched in his seat. “Their motive is that they’re mad and think I’m some sort of demon magnet or translator or doorway or whatever. We don’t need to know anything more. Encouraging them will only lead to more trouble.”
“If I don’t get a new case soon, my mind will atrophy. Section me now, John, it’ll save you time later.”
But this board isn’t any old Ouija board you’d find in the store or your nan’s attic. Not even something you’d see from the 1890s, held in a museum somewhere. This board doesn’t let you contact spirits. It contacts demons. We can’t see from the tape what it was that scared the professor so much. But I do know this. The woman I spoke to who was at the séance said that she glimpsed it for just a moment when she took off her blindfold. It was tall and it was dark. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Did they contact a spirit? Was she just seeing black spots because she’d taken off her blindfold and was upset by the professor’s exclamation? Who knows. But you gotta admit, it’s a bit strange how all of Sherlock’s Scarlet Files end up seemingly connected.
“Oh, Sherlock.” Victor looked both pitying and fondly exasperated. “You were the strongest they’d ever seen. Eurus had good potential, but she grew out of it, as some do.” He checked his watch. “I have to go. It’s not safe for us to be seen together. Look, please. Just stop the investigations. Maybe take a holiday, get away from this mess.” He stood up. “Stay here for another five minutes, then head out. It was … it was
John couldn’t see much beyond some smudges, mostly dark, but he remembered what the pictures of the caves at Bath looked like and could imagine. The same army worshipping or listening to a taller figure. The symbols that signified early writing.
Sherlock rubs his fingers over his eyebrows and sighs. “No, that’s not– I just–” He sighs again. His arm drops back down, and he looks at John. “You keep leaving.”
“Who says I'm following him? Sammy, is Tall Paul in your kitchen with you right now?” Sherlock’s eyes were narrowed.
Soon after the Torres’s wedding, strange things began happening to them. They consulted several experts, including Philip Anderson, with no success. That’s when they went to Sherlock. Appliances starting on their own, people asking about his tall friend when he’d clearly been somewhere alone, random noises in the home, feelings of being followed. Torres’s wife, Maria, started getting jumpy. She was the one who called in first priests, then investigators. Something happened when Sherlock was called in, because they stopped looking into it soon after. John was dying to know the details.
John shook his head, his mind scrambling to come up with an alternative answer to his actual thoughts. “Do you think we can do it?”
Sherlock gave him a ghost of a smile, then glanced to his sister. “Whether I do it or not, you won’t be coming with us, Eurus.”
site, garnering the most comments and likes. He even started getting fan mail. Conspiracy theories abounded, and he tried to ignore them, fearing they’d influence how he saw the cases. He was already having trouble seeing things with as much skepticism as he had when he’d started. So many of the cases seemed to have no explanation, and given that they were the scarlet files, even Sherlock couldn’t disprove them.
“Let me see.” The video showed a hand reach out and open the glass door. “There's nothing out there.”
The man nodded. “If you want to. But,” he continued, turning to Sherlock with a glare, “the moment he feels uncomfortable, you stop, got it?”
The night after their talk, John went to bed at his usual time, somehow still harboring hope that he’d finally get a full night’s sleep. He read until his eyes grew heavy and he stopped paying attention to the storyline (the sister-in-law did it, which John had known from page 32 because some
Sherlock cleared his throat. “John goes first. Eurus, wait until the leader is distracted, but start circling to the southern end of the stand of trees now. I’ll begin playing here and remain as long as I am able. Don’t pay attention to me. Concentrate on your j–”
Sherlock was playing his violin when John opened the street door. Based on the musical choice, it sounded like the freak out had moved on to contemplation. That was good. They climbed the stairs and into 221B, Eurus hanging back by the door. John called to Sherlock as he walked up to him but got no reply, so he touched his shoulder.
Perhaps it is nothing. Perhaps it’s apophenia after all. But I’m going to keep researching. I think I’ll find something eventually. Some way to tie things together. No, I’m not smarter than Sherlock Holmes. But I do see things differently than he does. He’s said before that my way of thinking helps him see things he didn’t see before. Perhaps I can do that again. We’ll see.
Sherlock sighed and looked back at Simon. “So, it’s happening at Boulder Field on the first of November. What else do you know? Assuming we choose to believe you, that is. You mentioned the Unsound.”
John had to agree it didn’t seem to be the way Sherlock normally worked. He’d had months to watch his friend do his detecting thing, and while he did a lot of mind work the rest of the world couldn’t comprehend, there wasn’t this instinctive homing thing. Sherlock was just really good at putting together disparate information.
“Right. He was four at the time. After Mr. Holmes left, the things that used to happen to me started happening to him. First time I remember it happening was around eleven at night. Maria and I were watching TV. She went to check on Sammy, and I heard her scream. I ran in, I saw her holding onto Sammy, and he was crying.”
“More symbols,” he explained simply. He scrolled down to the photos attached to the email. The first showed the bloody wall again, but the ones after that were of the wall wiped clean. Well, not clean, but free of the blood. In what must be permanent marker, the wall was marked up with the same numbers and symbols he was getting very tired of seeing. Different configurations than from their previous cases, but lots of numbers and glyphs.
“And there was nothing? No warning signs he wanted to leave his life? No clues showing that someone kidnapped him? Nothing? I don’t understand. You’re …
“And yet Trent is claiming it was Simon who attacked him?” Sherlock prompted. His plate was half empty, proving that he too was not bothered by the not-normal dinner chat.
Sherlock shrugged and looked away. “Oh, the usual things that kids get curious about, most of which had utterly mundane answers, much to my disappointment.”
“A drunkenly composed text from your brother? Was he complaining about his soon-to-be ex-wife or about the job he’s about to lose?”
Sherlock nodded, looking out the window to the blazing building. “There’s a spare room upstairs. You know I’m a workaholic and a bit untidy. My being an arrogant dickhead hasn’t scared you away yet, nor has my brother’s interfering. So … I’m offering.”
It was late. Or early. After the first week of insomnia, John had stopped looking at the time when he woke up. Instead, for the past few nights, he’d get out of bed—no use staying, he never got back to sleep after a nightmare—head downstairs, make a pot of chamomile, and wait for Sherlock to join him. Sometimes Sherlock was already in the lounge, tea prepared and at a perfect temperature. Some nights they’d watch mindless telly, others—the ones where Sherlock’s dreams seemed to be the worst—his flatmate would play the violin; quiet, mournful, helpless songs that made John want to cry.
Sherlock nodded, leaning against the wall to watch John. “Maria’s not happy, but Robert is insisting. The detective on the case is apparently an idiot.”
John slide his hands up to cup Sherlock’s face. “You are the best and wisest man I’ve ever known, and it’s been an honor being your friend and your …” He floundered. “In being with you. I’m glad we found each other.”
Surprisingly, it wasn’t any of those things on Sherlock’s mind, at least not at the moment. He frowned. “My mattress is better.”
John glanced over at him. The euphoric interest that had been on his face was gone. He looked thoroughly chastised now. John hoped it was a true feeling and not an act to sway him.
“Just like that, you’re offering me a place to stay, even though we barely know each other?” John stared at him in disbelief.
“I prefer to text,” was the laconic reply. He narrowed his eyes at the visitor. “Another death. Something’s different.”
John mentally shook his head to clear it. He’d got little sleep the night before, or the night before that and the one before that … He was still having those strange dreams—demons dragging Sherlock away screaming, bloody walls covered in symbols, tall men who jeered at him as he watched everything fall apart, helpless and frustrated.
“Anyone who looked after a Chosen. Me, Maddie Franks, Sammy’s babysitter, Robert’s childhood neighbor, Simon’s father, your mother.”
“This could be a case as simple as a conspiracy theory, but,” she held up her hand to stop John from arguing, “not your theory, or even any of your fans. I’ve been looking into the Order of the Cenophus this week. I don’t know where I personally land on how real the paranormal is—I’ll leave that to my dear brother—but the Order members definitely
“It’s bigger and probably has nicer sheets too. You seem like the type to have ridiculously posh sheets,” John teased, both letting Sherlock know he was okay with it and defusing the situation a little.
“Hmmm.” Sherlock went back to studying the symbols as he absentmindedly ate another bite. “Ancient Sumerian?” he mumbled.
John’s chill bumps were back. If the great Sherlock Holmes hadn’t solved it, it must be real, right? “Don’t you owe the person who sent you the videos one mill?”
John stepped toward his partner, then realize he couldn’t. The last symbol needed to be finished—that was more important to their plan (thought not to John himself). He stumbled toward where Eurus had left the last symbol unfinished. Dare he even try? He’d only looked over the sheet vaguely, and if he got it wrong, it could make things worse. Something flashed, he looked up to see the center stone glowing.
“Of course not. The Unsound isn’t real, John. Why are you so set on believing it is? God, why do I even try with your small minds?” Sherlock pushed long fingers through curly hair, and John looked away.
“Oh, yeah? I thought Mycroft would keep her locked away for a month trying to get the full story out of her.”
“Or you came along, started digging into old cases, and found connections where they don’t exist. And now your blog is bringing more of the crazies out of the woodwork.”
They watched the activity for a time. They couldn’t go in until the ceremony had begun, or the Order would find a way to stop them. Their approach must be precisely timed to even have a chance at succeeding.
John followed him to the desk and stooped behind Sherlock’s seated figure to avoid the screen glare. The video showed an American couple on vacation. As the man was talking about their trip from in front of the camera, the woman filming said, ‘Oh my God!’ and zoomed into the tower. It happened so fast John almost missed it. “Back it up,” he demanded. He leaned in closer, using a hand to steady himself on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“You knew I was coming. I’m sure you looked me up.” He was interrupted from saying more by a beep from his phone. He pulled it from his pocket. Seeing it was a badly misspelled message from Harry, he put it away again. He looked up to see Holmes staring at him, fingers steepled in front of his mouth. Before John could ask, he spoke up.
Then, Keith Dabic disappeared, two months after John had originally spoken with him. There was no reason to think he was dead, despite his insistence he only had a few months left to live after hearing the Unsound, but one day he just was … gone. John heard about it through an email a fan had sent. Sherlock, of course, thought nothing of it, saying it was just another mentally disturbed man who couldn’t take living in reality anymore and had just decided to leave it all behind.
An acolyte of Herman’s, Soběslav, created a new version of the codex while consumed with anger over Herman’s death and the selling of the bible. His new bible was different, however—evil, some said—and the Order was supposedly built on the foundations of that new codex, or
For a moment, John’s spirits lifted, but then fell almost as quickly. “I can’t afford Central London.”
“We can share a cab out,” Sherlock offered as they stood awkwardly on the pavement after. “I’ll pay.”
“To that extent, yeah. But sometimes he would just know things, things that even his genius brain couldn’t figure out. Things I couldn’t figure out, and I’m nearly as smart as he is.” She smirked as she said it.
When they reached his room, a placid young man was sitting quietly on the bed, like he was waiting for something. He looked normal enough—no frantically darting eyes or evil smile. Still, something about him made John feel on edge. He attributed it to the stories Trent had told.
Another minute and Sherlock finally took a deep breath and his face came alive again. “I’m your best friend?”
John saw pale eyes glance at the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet, but before he could ask, Mrs. Hudson entered the room looking both exasperated and fond. “Did you put the doorbell in the freezer again, Sherlock? There’s a package you need to sign for downstairs.”
“It’s just as important in a friend, John. Although, I will say you’re just what I imagine his type is,” she added with a wink.
The man, Sherlock Holmes, if his online bio picture was anything to go by, stopped his speech and stared at John, standing next to Mrs. Hudson. “Who are you?” Pale eyes darted all over John’s frame. He felt stripped, though not in a sexual way. Just like … Holmes could see into his soul or suss out his darkest secrets.
Not sure what he was looking for, he searched for a little bit of everything. Glushka didn’t yield much beyond what Sherlock had already told him, but the Order of the Cenophus gave better results. Sherlock put him in touch with a professor at Cambridge who knew some of the history, most of which, apparently, was apocryphal. Still, it was interesting.
“I …,” Sherlock began, drawing out the sound. “I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.”
Sherlock twisted his body so that he was partially sitting up. He looked like a dog who had just been shown a new chew toy. It was far more endearing than it should have been. “What did you have in mind?”
John’s mate shrugged. “No answers to knocking, but the door is unlocked. I’m about to call the police, but figured I’d let you know before I got caught up in paperwork.”
“Um. Yes. I mean, no.” Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck. “I didn’t need to. Others had already done so. There is plenty of time for people on the ground to remove the dummy before the camera zooms in. Obvious.”
“Well, if he was meant to be your Watcher, he would’ve known about it already, perhaps encourage it, if it was part of–”
“Oh!” John said again, but this time in surprise. He’d taken it for a black stain at first, but just like he’d done when seeing Sammy’s bedroom cupboard months before, it morphed into a stretched face the longer he looked at it.
“You don't find that a bit patronizing? To reduce their experiences, which sound frightening to them, to a bad marriage?”
Eurus’s phone pinged before she could reply, and her face lit up. She put up a finger as she answered the call.
Sherlock whirled around from his spot in front of the wall across the room, also covered with paper and string, clearly having been far enough in his own mind to not hear John enter, but aware enough to acknowledge a voice.
“You, Sherlock Holmes, are too stubborn to die,” John said, leaning up to press a quick kiss to his lips. “Or maybe I never got around to finishing writing it, and it’s a mashup of two different posts …”
He stayed silent for a while, leaning in so their shoulders touched. “What if … I can’t prove it’s all fake?”
. I am using quite a few direct quotes (or nearso) from the show in this chapter, because it’s way creepier than I could ever hope to be, but I won’t do this on every case they investigate. I just wanted to give you a sense of how the investigations would work.
Usually Sherlock’s behavior would not be too abnormal, except for him hiding in his room. What was going on in there? Unable to figure it out, John concentrated on his current research. There was a connection between the paintings and the other cases they’d had recently. He just knew it. Now he had to prove it to Sherlock.
“Why should we?” Sherlock retorted. He put a hand on John’s shoulder to signal their exit and turned to slide himself out of the booth. “If you’re not going to tell us anything, this meeting is no use. I’d say it was good to see you Victor, but–”
CW: mentions of patients at a psychiatric hospital, and Sherlock being a bit rude about said patients.
After that, John decides to make an experiment of it, though he doesn’t tell Sherlock this. He needs to know. Is it specifically domesticity with Sherlock that makes him happy, or just a change in routine? It starts off being once a week. John will show up with a baby, a bag, and a day off, and he lets things just happen. Sometimes Sherlock’s gone for half the day, doing whatever he does to occupy his time, not realizing John and Rosie are at Baker Street until he returns. Sometimes the three spend the whole day together. Sometimes a client appears, and they’re rushed off on an investigation after scrambling for a sitter. Sometimes they do tea or lunch with Mrs. Hudson, sometimes they take walks in the park. Sometimes John appears at the flat exhausted after a night spent awake with Rosie, so he spends the day recovering while Sherlock and Rosie entertain themselves.
“Don’t be boring, John.” Sherlock slid so he was slouched in his chair, head resting against the back, arms dangling off the sides. Definite signs he was about to throw a wobbly.
When John put his hand on top of Sherlock’s on his shoulder, he felt a pressure at the back of his head where Sherlock laid his forehead against it. His breath tickled on John’s neck.
“It was gradual, and it mostly happened when he went away to uni, so I thought it was just normal growing up. I fought it for a while, but when he continued, I accepted it. It was his choice to turn away.”
John took a moment to study his friend’s face, then turned to the screen. An old home video began to play. Like many others he’d seen from the scarlet files, it looked like it had been transferred from VHS or something older. The view was of a young girl, maybe five or six. Her hair was in two bunches, and she wore a dress and cardigan that looked like they were from the seventies or eighties. She looked at the person recording the video, then gazed through a set of doors in a glass porch she stood in, out into the night.
“Because you’re Sherlock Holmes, of course,” John said with a grin and an elbow nudge. Sherlock frowned, so he continued. “Seriously though? If you don’t, you don’t. We go home, add it to the scarlet files, and life continues, with you running after theories and me trailing behind, trying to write it all down.”
She sat the laptop on the kitchen table and went to get Sammy from where he was playing in the backyard. They returned, and the boy sat in front of the laptop, Maria next to him.
“Very good, John. Yes.” Sherlock started ticking things off with his fingers. “Simon is a very disturbed young man who basically grew up in this hospital and possibly killed his parents. Too much time on his hands, a need to bring order to his world, so he studies numerology and sacred geometry. He doesn’t like Trent, so he draws these symbols on the other boy’s wall. Trent becomes ‘infected’ and begins drawing the same things. The seizure is just a random happenstance, nothing to do with anything else.”
“Yes, the apocalyptic event, letting hell’s inhabitants in.” He didn’t sound as sardonic has he had when speaking of it in the past.
Maybe it’s John who is closing the gap. He closes his eyes and forces the words out this time. “Kiss you?”
No, smartarse, it wasn’t ghosts. It was a man: one Mr Sherlock Holmes, paranormal investigator. Or, should I say, paranormal debunker. In every interview, his name popped up. Said scathingly or with annoyed but weary acceptance, the name intrigued me. I asked why he was mentioned in seemingly every conversation I’d had during two weeks of interviews. His attitude has apparently earned him no mates or even colleagues. He is more than rude or cold. He shoots down every notion that the paranormal could be real. He debunks every unexplained happening, every haunting. If there is so much as a mysterious door twitch reported, he’s on it, offering scientific explanations for every occurrence.
to anyone, because Mycroft made them sign nondisclosure agreements. He felt bad leaving his readership high and dry after they’d followed him for months on the journey. He’d have to find a way to sneak it in at some point …
“But that’s what he does,” John argued. “He reads the scene, and he figures out what really happened. Why do you think that’s a paranormal gift? I admit he sees way more than us regular people do, but there’s nothing supernatural about it. He’s a genius. Amazing, but just a genius.”
Sherlock groaned. “There is nothing to prove or disprove with this one. It’s just a silly urban legend.”
John hid a smirk behind his hand. It was a trick when someone else did it, but pure intellect and observation when Sherlock did the same.
In which John and Eurus become friends,  Mycroft makes a very brief appearance, and Sherlock finds Victor.
It was an interesting story, but the Cambridge professor refused to say what was fact and what was myth. No one knew what was true, and today’s version of the order wasn’t talking. They could be worshiping Satan or quietly living their lives and growing herb gardens.
“What about the Unsound?” he asked, wracking his brain for other things she could look into. Best to get her brain focused on things that weren’t him.
John squinted. “A bit of damp?” he guessed, looking over at Sherlock. Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
But more than that, what had appeared to be a sound file of only a few minutes turned out to be a recording of more than three hours. After forty minutes of silence, the monitor had picked up some whispers, unintelligible, but they definitely sounded like human chanting. John heard Kurt cooing from his cot, then more whispers. There was a further half hour of silence, then the whispers returned, louder than before. The words became clear.
Sherlock shook his head. “Something … something I thought was a fake at first—just someone trying to rile me up—but it contained things only Victor and I would understand. References to books and places we only talked about in private. What if … what if he’s still alive, John?” His voice was small, confused, worried.
“Alright?” John tried to make the connection to anything they’d talked about in the last hour. Was he worried about finding occult symbols scratched into John’s admittedly old and scuffed headboard? Maybe there was more danger in sleepwalking in the smaller space, with stairs right outside the bedroom door? Then he realized what Sherlock meant.
He checked his email while he finished his toast. He scrolled through most—requests or fan mail probably; he’d look later—but stopped when he came across a familiar name. “Keith Dabic.”
“It’s not a completely surprising end. The band was known for having altercations with the religious right, who claimed they promoted Satanism and/or occultism. There was a rumor they had sacrificed a cat on stage at a concert.”
Sherlock scowled and took the folder. “As if I’d let him get his grubby hands on it. And I believe he’s dealing with his own problem—more thalassic than chthonic, though …”
Yet another dead end. John seemed to hit a lot of those these days, and he was surprised Sherlock had as few scarlet files as he did. The whole flat should be bursting with them.
John sighed and rubbed his gritty eyes. Eight hours of sleep over the last four days total was taking its toll. He couldn’t think clearly. He didn’t know how Sherlock was managing to continue on normally. The man claimed to need less sleep than most people, but an hour or two a night was unhealthy for anyone. “I don’t know. Does it matter? What matters is stopping bad things from happening, which they will, no matter whether its supernatural in nature or not.”
