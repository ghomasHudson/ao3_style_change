Dean scoffs again and then pauses. “Hmm actually…” Castiel figures he’s doing some quick cost calculations. “How does dinner sound? I mean, if that’s not too much.”
“Still figuring that one out.” Sam’s been furiously typing away during this exchange, but suddenly his hands still and he sits back a bit. “Alright,” Sam reads, “Ayy Oh--- 'archive of our own.' This is, wow, there are… Holy crap, there are a quarter of a million stories here based on Chuck’s books. And yep, tulpas.” Sam continues to click around. “And uh,” Sam huffs, grins up at his brother, “a lot, a
Apparently done with his examination of Dean’s things, Cas just sits quietly until he notices something on the floor between the beds. Picking it up, Cas walks over to hand it to Dean. It’s a small black feather, maybe three or four inches long, one that could be easily mistaken as belonging to a crow. Dean takes the feather and tucks it in his shirt pocket, patting it protectively.
truth, which is still the truth but told in the most outlandish way possible, dripping with sarcasm and clearly a joke, with a giant escape hatch pre-cut into the side at the factory because nobody would ever believe that Dean could possibly mean what he’s saying.
graveyards, but the idea of sleeping in front of this weird appliance graveyard is too much even for them. Congrats Conrad, you’re somehow worse than half the things the Winchesters have salted and burned.
“What?” Dean asks, surprise making him forget he’s supposed to be giving the angel the silent treatment.
The table they’re sitting at is next to the low wall that separates the restaurant from the casino floor. Cas watches as people from all walks of life meander between blackjack and roulette tables. A group of women, probably a bridal party, chatter at a bank of bright neon slot machines in the distance.
Sam waits for Cas to elaborate; when it’s clear he isn’t going to, Sam rolls his eyes. “You’re gonna need to give me a little more to work with here.”
terrify him -- but fuck if it doesn't also thrill him a little, make him feel warm inside, make him feel hopeful. Dean still doesn't have a fucking clue how he’s supposed to save the world, or if he even can, but he's got the only good thing in all of heaven smiling at him from the backseat of his car and damn if that's not something.
Dean raps his knuckles on the little door over the gas inlet and can’t help but sneak a few glances at the way Cas’ pants hug his ass as he climbs down out of the bed of the truck and heads toward the cab. A minute later, after Dean’s poured about half the gas can’s contents into the truck’s fuel tank, he realizes Cas is talking.
costume; and electronic billboards the size of a four-story building. And Jesus, the lights. How are they still this bright even during the day?
sorry. Egg white omelets truly are an abomination,” Castiel said with a solemnity that might have seemed sarcastic coming from someone else, but was entirely genuine. Dean huffed out a laugh but still looked like he could use some distraction from his thoughts.
this was coming but he’d hoped he was wrong, that he could figure out a way to fix it, but of course he didn’t, of course he’d failed.
“So,” Dean says. Cas laughs his quiet laugh, the one Dean hasn’t heard in weeks, the one he’s missed so much but hasn’t let himself admit. “If we…” Dean continues. “Would it be real now? You know that’s why I, what I couldn’t handle.”
Dropping his duffel at the door and approaching Castiel, Dean becomes increasingly aware of the fact that he ...smells. It’s a gradual thing, not sharp, not pungent, not something that makes his eyes water. In fact at first it’s actually kind of okay because it’s the same smell he rolls over into and gratefully inhales after Cas has gotten up in the morning. It’s the scent of skin and oil, of Castiel. It’s just much too much of it, built up until it’s heavy and dense. It’s when Dean gets within a few feet of Cas that yeah, he can tell this is a man who hasn’t bathed in a week.
Sam picks up where Dean’s going with this, years of bluffing their way through witness interviews making for a seamless performance. “We wanted another pair of hands. Lots of weird stuff going on lately, you know.”
There are lots of different ways to need to bathe: sour armpits and salty skin at the end of a long hard day in the sun; motor oil and engine grease and little flecks of rust in every imaginable crevice; the flop sweat and stale piss of an old drunk. Dean’s familiar enough with the first two himself, the third because he encountered enough guys like that on the road with his dad. What he’s not familiar with at all is the smell of a person who has sat still and done almost nothing for a week straight.
Look, Dean understood why Lisa was getting sick of the Waffle House. It’s not like they couldn’t afford to go out on nice dates. And sometimes Dean would let her nag him into taking her to some fancy steakhouse where you paid a hundred bucks for a steak you didn’t have to cover in barbecue sauce. Dean cared about Lisa and he cared about giving her what she wanted.
The next morning, Dean wakes to filtered sunlight and the hushed tones of an infomercial jingle. Castiel is sitting at the foot of Dean’s bed, weight bowing the worn out mattress, face way too close to the boxy TV. In the snowy picture, Ron Popeil makes beef jerky or something while the studio audience oohs and ahhs. Dean turns toward the other bed -- careful not to move too much and disturb Cas’ trance -- and sees that Sam is awake too and watching Cas with the same good humored confusion Dean felt. Glancing at his brother, Sam shrugs and lets out a silent chuckle.
“Huh.” Dean chews on that scenario for a minute before finally shaking his head. “No, doesn’t really work flipped around like that.”
Sam thinks for a moment before hesitantly suggesting a trip out to the Hoover Dam, which Dean loudly laughs at before reminding Sam that they drove over top of it last night as they crossed out of Arizona.
“Singer Salvage and Auto Repair, whaddaya need?” a gruff voice that belongs to someone who is definitely not Dean answers.
Castiel is quiet as the two of them walk the half mile or so to his ailing vehicle. Dean sneaks glances at the guy trudging along next to him, thinks he still seems a little off or maybe just lost in thought. Cas is an unnerving combination of fidgety and still, has been rubbing a palm back and forth across the knuckles of his other hand in a way that, well, if you see someone do it once or twice outside a shitty bar it means they’re about to take a swing. Someone doing it over and over for five solid minutes? Dean’s not sure what to make of that, but he does know he’s walking down a deserted country road with a strange man and woops maybe this is not the smartest thing he’s ever done.
“Heaven’s been falling apart for years now, fewer and fewer angels alive to keep it running, but it just seems to have… repaired itself.”
“Look, Dean, this is supposed to be for the both of us,” she said, her voice sliding into that patient tone that always made Dean feel like such a fuck up of a boyfriend.
“Thank you Dean, I completely agree. As I was saying, short of asking Chuck directly if he’s feeling any less antagonistic towards us, your wound is the best indicator of the level of connection between him and you. I believe it may also serve as an adequate thermometer---”
“Oh, I may have some tools. Um, let me just…” And Cas swings himself up into the bed of the truck and starts moving some white boxes out of the way.
When Sam walks back in he’s careful to look up and around and over, and just anywhere but the bed, but even so all he’d see are wings. Wings and Dean’s head popped up from between them, and now Cas’ too. “Hey uh, got us a case,” Sam says. When Dean and Cas make no effort to get up, Sam shakes his head and offers to go grab some coffee. “Take your time, guys.”
“Conrad,” Cas pulls the old man’s attention toward himself. “You appear to have an extensive collection of research materials.”
“Do you not… Is touch bad?” Before Dean can get too far down the path of figuring out how he’s supposed to be with a guy he can’t even touch, Cas pulls him back.
“If you would like to come in for a few minutes, I need to do something.” Cas steps back and Dean enters. He looks around from his spot in the entryway, recognizing the house from the pictures he’d seen.
“It’s important, Dean,” Cas said, mouth moued in the most adorable of pouts. “It’s our first morning after moving in together.”
“You know what I mean. The other dreams have had something off about them. Different. Coffee shops and whatever.”
“I would like to ‘chill’ now, if that’s okay,” Cas says. He looks… intense. He kind of always looks intense when he stares at Dean, but there’s a hunger Dean hasn’t seen before in Cas’ eyes. Dean grins and makes a show of tossing the remote away and turning his body fully toward Cas, ready and willing, let’s do this. But instead of moving over to Dean, Castiel gives a sour look toward the image of Clint Eastwood that’s looking out at the two of them from the TV, a grizzled cowboy wearing a sarape and a disapproving squint. “I think it would be more comfortable on the um, the bed.”
Dean slows a little as he follows Sam toward an empty booth, the pastry case set into the counter calling to him like a siren. Cheesecakes, Danishes, little piles of cookies dusted in powdered sugar, and oh god the pies. Apple, cherry, key lime so tall he’s not sure how they got it in there, peach, blackberry, and some jiggly chocolate thing that looks terrible but probably tastes delicious. Dean had been so excited for a cheeseburger when he’d walked in, but all thoughts of anything other than pie have evaporated completely.
her, and not like that. Just a friend who’s looking out for me, keeping me busy,” Dean clarifies. “Now can we get back to work?”
“You got it, hon,” Mildred said, her eyes dancing. Dean watched as she deftly scooped his plate back up and sashayed back across the restaurant before dropping it in front of the smart ass cook and cocking her hip out, talking animatedly with big hand gestures.
Dean groans at the implications of this. “Yeah sure, hold on just a sec, I’m gonna grab my jacket and say goodbye to Charlie.”
'?” she asked, drawing air quotes around those last two words just like she had the week before and emphasizing them in a way that Cas had quite frankly found confusing.
“And you’re," Cas squints at Dean, trying to solve this conversation like it's a puzzle, "Not happy about that.”
It’s been long enough that Cas’ hair looks wet, like he just got out of the shower, and somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind it registers that this might actually be a little funny, the irony. But Cas’ hair isn’t dark and clumped with water, but with oil. And from his vantage point standing while Cas is curled up on the couch below, Dean can see flakes of dandruff or wax or whatever all that shit is that a shower would wash away.
Dean scoffed. He leaned back and looked up at the ceiling, unable to face her while she spewed this bullshit.
of Sioux Falls -- gained some appeal. As far as bars went, Rocky’s wasn’t so bad at the right time of day on the right day of the week. It could be a nice quiet place to sit and read and sip a beer after work without being bothered and, more importantly, without bothering anyone. And the lighting levels were good, not dim enough to be sleazy, but not bright enough to be, well,
Also I just want to say that I like Bela a lot on the show and wish she'd stuck around longer, but I also think she would have been absolutely TERRIBLE for Dean's self esteem if the two of them ever dated. So, sorry not sorry, Bela.
Castiel spends Tuesday trying to figure out exactly what time “around” seven o’clock means, resists the urge to text Dean and ask for a more precise time, and ends up deciding to be at the Roadhouse by 6:40. He knows this isn’t a date but just a way to repay Dean for his help (he keeps reminding himself of this fact), but he still wants to make a good impression on the man.
“If it makes you feel any better, three other customers also threw food that week,” (Dean scrunched his brows) “and four the week before.” (...and now looked alarmed) “Oh, not at
“Buddy, you gotta start using doors.” Dean gives a sidelong glance to his friend and has to fight against the smile that plays at his lips when he sees how devastated Cas looks about the whole thing. Stretching one last time, warm inside and out and feeling truly awake now, Dean gestures over at the Impala with a tilt of his head. “We should head back, see if Sam’s up yet. And thanks for the coffee, Cas.”
Cas felt his face flush and realized he was fidgeting with the spatula in his hand. He stilled himself when Dean started to speak.
“I want to see the hole in the ground Cas made!” Dean quickly corrects, a little too loud and a little too shrill.
“Dean?” Cas’ gravelly voice floated across the parking lot. Dean turned to see him leaning out of the restaurant, face painted with concern, free hand rubbing up and down a pant leg. “Are you okay?”
“Vegas, baby! Sin City!” Dean says a little too loudly and with an almost painful grin, drumming his hands over Baby’s steering wheel and trying not to think about how foreign it feels to be happy. Given all the crap he’s been through over the past few lifetimes he shouldn’t really be surprised.
It hasn't been physically comfortable for Dean to sleep in the Impala since he was 12 or 13. How Sam can sleep through the night in the car, laying down in a space that's a whole foot too short for him, Dean will never know. But the gentle snores coming from the back tell him that Sam's got it all figured out.
“Last time, you said you were early because it would’ve been rude if you weren’t, but then when I was late you said it wasn’t. Rude of me, I mean.”
Cas smiles at this. “There are many presents. Before you ask, I don’t know much about them. The magic required to pass from this present to another is highly guarded. Only a small number of angels were entrusted with it, and I was not among them.”
Bobby gives Sam a quick squeeze on the shoulder as he walks past and heads toward the back of the house, leaving Sam alone in the kitchen. From his spot on the couch Dean watches through heavy eyelids as Sam lingers at the table a little longer then hefts himself up and heads over to the sink.
. It’s shorthand and it’s short-lived, an easy thing that only exists when it’s needed and disappears when it’s not.
, to be in a home like this, especially when he doesn’t have the layer of false civility that his FBI suit provides. He’s here as himself, as Dean Winchester, as a hunter and a brother and a person who lives out of his car.
Dean spots the big neon arrow pouring down the side of the even bigger neon milkshake from a few streets over; when he pulls up to the low, cotton candy pink building and finds a parking space right out front where Baby can shine, he knows it’s meant to be. Mearle's Drive In is the kind of place that you're not sure has changed the fry oil since the Eisenhower administration. The kind of place that maybe one time was all poodle skirts and letterman jackets, but is now just a health code nightmare with the best goddamn burger in a 50-mile radius.
“Sure thing, handsome,” Mildred said, giving him a wink. He put his hand over his heart and winked back.
It’s amazing how much better a date can be when both of the people on it know it’s one. In a lot of ways it’s the same as the first -- Dean and Cas sit and talk and eat and drink -- but Cas is more relaxed and the part of Dean that’s always expecting things to go to shit has taken a break. It’s still there but it’s less vigilant, off to the side having a drink at the bar, only half paying attention. Cas still gets kind of flat as the night goes on -- ‘tired’ -- and the fatalist part of Dean tries to wander back over and remind the rest of him that Cas isn’t into it, this isn’t going to work, look how bored he is by you, just like Bela was, but Dean tells it to go to hell. It doesn’t, but it shuts up for the rest of the night and that’s good enough.
This part of the country is covered in a shaky but regular grid of north-south and east-west country backroads. Even the interstates don’t cut much of a diagonal, so the morning’s drive southwest takes them on a stair step path across the state; once they get into Colorado things will smooth out, the drive a lot more south than west. There’s a more direct route that would take them through Kansas, just clipping the northwest corner of the state, but even though it wouldn’t take them anywhere near Lawrence, Dean works out an alternative. It’s not like he refuses to set foot in the state -- they take jobs there all the time -- but Dean doesn’t go into Kansas if he doesn’t absolutely have to. Can’t imagine ever living there again, and all-in-all it’s just easier for him to avoid it if he can.
“Oh oh, I---” Cas loosens his grip, realizing that he’s just summoned the full wrath of an angel of the lord right here in the middle of a crappy corner store and that smiting this convenience store clerk is probably not the best course of action for a few different reasons: 1. It’s generally considered rude to smite strangers; and 2. Cas would have to look for the pie himself and he has
“Cas, honey, let’s not think about that yet. Let’s… You said this might be nice? Let’s focus on that part right now.”
Dean and Cas text back and forth over the next couple of days trying to figure out what to do on their first-slash-second date. They each keep suggesting things that are perfectly acceptable but just don’t seem right for any number of reasons. Dean’s still fighting his way out of the headspace that says dates must be fancy, formal, and expensive; sometimes, like with the Roadhouse, he has no problem remembering what
But this morning, as Dean heads out to the Impala to throw a duffel filled only with clothes and toiletries into the trunk -- no special weapons or books or detailed maps of where to find the latest thing that needs to be dead -- he feels… kinda good actually. It’s not that the end of all their troubles are in sight, and he knows he’ll probably feel like shit about this trip next week, for having fun when he should be saving the world. But right now in this moment, sliding the keys into the ignition, things seem okay. He’s found the one good angel, Sam’s done with the demon blood, and Bobby’s right: they don’t have any leads and this might be their last chance to have fun.
, Castiel does not stop to preread it (there’s no need), and instead just pulls it from the rack and puts in his hand basket next to two tubes of powdered donuts and a package of beef jerky.
The voice huffs into the phone. “Hold on a minute, will ya?” There’s a muffled sound and then Castiel mentally follows along as the man walks the phone from the quiet of the office where he’d answered it into the din of the auto shop. “Dean!
“What---” Dean poked at the sunny side up eggs with his fork and sighed. “You could have done the eyes with runny eggs, ya know, and it would have worked just as well.” His eyes were dull as he stabbed at one of the sausages that formed a smiling mouth beneath the ‘eyes’ and took a bite.
“Dean,” Lisa said impatiently, and he looked up, belatedly realizing that she’d been talking to him.
“Whatever you want is fine,” Dean said, before stuffing his cheeks full of more waffle and hoping she wouldn’t ask him more questions.
Cas’ lips curve in a small smile as he pulls his phone out of a pocket and flicks the screen a couple of times before turning it towards Dean. “This is when I first got her,” Cas explains. A small, round, tortoiseshell tabby looks up at Dean from the phone.
“Yes Sam, I am well aware that Chuck was masquerading as a prophet. In fact, I believe I was the one who foolishly insisted he be protected at all costs.”
“Oh, thank you Dean. I would be honored to experience Star Trek with you,” Cas replies solemnly as he follows Dean out of the kitchen and into the den. Dean flops himself onto the ancient couch, his only plan for the next few hours being to move as little as possible. Cas sits next to him like a cat content to silently follow its human around the house.
Several Tuesday nights came and went, and still no Dean. The Tuesday of the disastrous incident with the omelet, Cas had stopped off at a 24-hour grocery store after his shift and bought two dozen eggs. By the time the next Tuesday had rolled around, Cas had practiced cooking 24 eggs to runny perfection and had zero clean spoons in his house. That morning while he ate his cereal with a fork he thought about what he’d say to Dean, playing through various possible conversations to find the best things to talk about. Maybe he’d tell Dean how much he liked that long black car that had still been in the parking lot when Cas left that night but was gone by the time he came in the next day. But Dean never showed.
Sam closes his laptop and moves from the little kitchen table these rooms all seem to have to his own bed, sensing that it’s time to kick back and relax for the evening.
In reality, depression lingers. In reality, it has an odor. Sometimes a show will mention this, one character saying genially to another “Wow man, you need a shower,” ha ha laugh clap on the back, and that’s it. It’s never actually as bad as it really should be because these are characters you’re supposed to like or want to be or want to be
Instead Dean watched as his hand reached down and picked up the plate with that fucking omelet on it and then somehow he was hurling the stupid omelet towards the back wall, where it didn’t even make a decent splat before falling limply to the floor.
“What?” Dean shakes off the memory of that cold, too stiff Sam-who-wasn’t-Sam and makes himself look over at his younger brother. Sam is folded up in the seat, knees straining at the fabric of his jeans. He’s gangly and kind of goofy and looks so wonderfully like
ending, after all. Wasn’t the point of this trip to squeeze one nice thing into their lives before everything goes to hell on earth?
us -- our, growing up -- but it sort of is. I mean, nobody but Sammy and me would know that but,” the apprehension over being laid bare goes unsaid.
“Are you gonna sit or what? You’re looming over me.” Dean grumps, pushing a chair out with his foot. Cas lowers himself stiffly into the seat, even after a year moving like he’s unused to this particular configuration of limbs and solidity.
Bobby, of course, chooses the exact moment Dean utters the word “dick” to appear in the doorway to the kitchen. His step falters and he really looks like he wants to turn right around and leave, but he also looks like he’s going to drop dead if he doesn’t get some coffee. After a moment balanced in between, the draw of the coffee maker pulls him in and he commits himself to whatever the hell he just walked into.
told you -- that God had plans for you, you rejected with such ferocity the notion of being a man whose very existence was foretold by fate, was bound to a certain destiny. Why is this so different?”
“Yep,” Sam runs his fingers over the dusty ground and lets out an impressed laugh. “Iron, and it goes all the way around.”
“Oh, uh, no I didn’t.” Okay, maybe Cas is a local history buff or something. Dean waits for more, but after a long minute it becomes clear nothing else is coming and Dean falls back on his earlier plan. “So Cas, you have any family around here?”
fuckin’ low. All day out in that damn junkyard Dean was getting whiffs of Detroit, but now all he smells is the simple clean of whatever stolen motel soap he’s lathering up with.
.” Dean pauses, takes a breath. “My dad was just lost. That’s it. There was no grand plan, it was--- he just couldn’t stay still you know? I mean, there was nothing fidgety or nervous about the man, but I look back on it and he was so restless, I see it now. And that, that’s not a good answer. People want more, expect more, but it’s all I got because I was just a fuckin’ kid.”
Castiel squints down at the basket for a moment, working out what he’s looking at. "Oh. It wasn’t intentional, but yes I suppose I did."
After a few minutes of silence that probably should feel awkward but doesn’t, Jo comes by with the check. Cas takes it before Dean can, keeping it out of Dean’s reach even as he opens his mouth to protest. “Hey buddy, I’m the one who asked
“It’s alright Dean, I’m happy to do it.” And now Cas is smiling up at Dean. How did they get like this again so quickly, right back to what Dean had so lamely run away from? Dean has this stupid thought to put his hand on Cas’ arm, to complete the mirror image of before, but before he can Cas is telling him something about money.
“Dude, did you -- take a step back, man.” Castiel takes exactly one step back. “Did you come here just to tell me about your dick?”
After a few more eggs prepared and eaten in companionable silence, Dean said something about a “Cool Hand Luke” (Cas didn’t know what that was and made a mental note to look it up later) and leaned away from the counter looking satisfied, but hesitant.
Before Dean can answer, Sam chimes in. “See Cas, something you need to know about my brother is that every time he complains about me being a huge nerd he’s leaving something out. He also is a huge fucking nerd.”
The brothers are dirty enough that Dean’s pretty sure not even the scuzziest of motel clerks is going to rent them a room, but they need to rent a room in order to clean up. Looks like it’s time for plan B, and it doesn’t take them too long to find signs advertising a new subdivision going up on the outskirts of the city. Dean slowly guides the Impala down a street that’s half-completed construction and empty lots, his head on a swivel until he finally sees what he’s looking for.
I realize it's always dangerous to give kudos on an unfinished work (what if it goes way off the rails in the last chapter, you don't know!) but I give you my solemn promise that this will be sweet and fluffy and a little bit melancholy -- but hopefully not too much! So yes, comments and kudos please, thank you.
He sees movement in the corner of his eye, something black pushing outwards to fill more of his peripheral vision, and hears Sam gasp in reverence. The condor, still on the ground in front of Cas, has opened up its wings, revealing their unexpected white undersides. It’s not flapping them or raising them above its body or doing anything threatening or particularly awesome, but it’s majestic nonetheless simply because the wings are so
Dean digs around in one of the duffles, then another, and a third before he finally comes up with a can of salt. Only then does he look up at Sam and pantomime tossing long, flowing locks over his shoulder.
“Hey there, Mildred,” Dean said, shooting her his patented Dean Winchester smirk, guaranteed to make the ladies want to give him whatever he was asking for. “If it’s not too much trouble, can I ask that these eggs be redone? I’d just love them to be a little bit runnier, sweetheart.”
too thorough shine job on Baby’s front bumper, the chrome unable to get any shinier than it’s probably already been for the last five minutes. He clears his throat. “Hey Dean, uh.”
They have to walk through the gift shop to get back to the parking lot. Normally Dean wouldn't pay much attention to any of the stuff these places sell -- kind of hard to collect souvenirs when you don't have a home to keep them in. Anyway, he just wants to get back to the car and sit down and maybe close his eyes for a minute or two, but as they're meandering past the shelves of cheap plastic dinosaurs and My First Telescopes, something catches Dean's attention. It's a small basket filled with tiny black balls, most of them no bigger than a nickel. They're cratered, like little moons made of glass, the pockmarks revealing shiny obsidian while the smoother parts of the surface are a deep dull grey. A sign next to the basket reads "Tektites, $5" and explains that these little balls of glass were made at the same time as the crater.
Cas smiles at Dean again, serenely this time, and just says “Other than exactly what I’m doing right now, no.”
water. Sam nods his head and Dean puts a fist up, preparing to rock-paper-scissors it for who gets first shower, but instead of raising his own fist Sam just gets this smartass look on his face and says “You know, there are probably two.” This revelation -- really, that’s what it is, it’s like the heavens opened up and he heard angels sing -- has Dean way too excited to bother calling Sam out on his sass.
A phone rings somewhere and while Dean is thanking an absent god, Sam is upright and looking around before Dean can even react. "Got it," Sam announces, grabbing the flip phone and squinting down at the tiny display on the front. "Bobby," he tells Dean, waving the phone in front of him and stepping outside to take the call.
Dean laughs quietly against Cas’ mouth. “Hey, hey, lemme…” and Dean uses his lips to nudge Cas into parting his own. Once he can, Dean licks the tip of his tongue into Cas’ mouth and Cas’ eyes go wide like “Oh wow, there’s
Thank you for reading, I hope you're enjoying it! Comments, suggestions, kudos -- all are welcome and appreciated!
“Ron, it won’t make sense.” Charlie’s looking down at a DnD character sheet that Ronald has protectively splayed a hand across. “Mandroid” is written across the top. “It’s a high fantasy run and besides, no homebrew this time. We’re sticking to the basics, man. Old school.”
Dean ends the call and hands the ancient cordless phone back to Bobby, grateful for the heat in the garage that should be covering up the blush he can feel creeping up his cheeks. “Thanks.”
But anyway, it’s Monday, and Dean’s lounging on the couch finishing up the last of the pot of coffee and trying to find the necessary motivation to scrub out a casserole dish that’s now got rock-fucking-hard bits of last night’s dinner cemented to it. Cas left for work just two hours ago, so the sound of his truck already rumbling back up the long driveway is unexpected.
, the guy’s kind of an ass. Anyway, he lent me a real rare lorebook last time I was down his way and I need to get it back to him.”
"Gotta pick the best one," he explains while plucking one of the tektites up and letting the others roll back into the basket, then winks at Cas and walks over to the register.
“Nope, you did good Cas.” Dean slips the bit of glass into his pants pocket and pats it for good measure.
the bed while Dean was “reading magazines”... (“I’m sorry Dean, I failed to properly account for galactic drift while calculating my landing coordinates. The Virgo Supercluster can be tricky.”)
Dean looks out over the landscape. There are mountains in the distance, the Rockies, he figures, but they don’t carry the promise of snow or pine trees or anything else cool and refreshing. They’ve been looming on the western horizon for the last few hours, jagged and brown and ominous and just a little too large for how far away they must be, and suddenly Dean realizes he doesn’t want to look at them anymore. Sam’s right, this doesn’t have to be a long haul. “Alright fine. Just a couple more hours.”
“Hmm,” Dean looks suddenly interested, bobbing his head around and grabbing at the computer to try and turn it around.
After looking around the visitor’s center and ogling the 1,400 pound meteorite (Cas shakes his head sadly when he touches it) they head back outside to get a better look at the crater. Walking along the trail that follows part of the rim, Dean listens to Castiel talk about geologic timescales in a casual way that makes him uncomfortably aware of his own fleeting and very human existence. When they reach the end of the path, they take a few minutes to stand there and admire the view and that’s when Dean realizes how fucking
“Hey, how ‘bout some music?” Dean offers after a while to the silent car. When he doesn’t gesture for the box of tapes that’s slid down somewhere out of reach, Sam realizes Dean’s letting him choose the music.
“This place closed down 17 days before I got out of the pit. Just my luck, man. Missed it by two goddamn weeks.”
“Hey Castiel,” Charlie cuts Ron off, apparently done with a conversation that seems to have been going on for a while.
“Yeah exactly. So Cas, the first time we met Chuck he was an author. An actual author, not a… god-author I guess. Anyway...”
-- Dean would think this is some kind of power move, but coupled with how Cas' enthusiasm had seemed to fall away over the course of dinner Dean guesses he's being given the signal that things between him and Cas are over before they've even started.
Castiel blips himself out of the bunker and flashes just on the invisible side of the veil past a succession of places that are either convenient or a store until he finds one that is both convenient
Dean nodded, a lump in his throat. He knew where this was going. Everyone in this fucking Waffle House knew where this was going. The old guy in the booth on the other side of the restaurant could fully sense that he was a fuck up and a shitty boyfriend and he was about to get dumped.
“Thank you, Dean. And, though I don’t know Sam well I doubt he’d make light of your experiences. He just may find them easier to confront. No, not confront,
likes, but other times he finds himself stuck circling around the fact that the only time Bela had ever said anything truly complimentary to him was when he’d spent a week’s pay on a tuxedo rental at her insistence.
It takes very little consideration for Sam to decide he ought to tell Dean about his hypothesis ahead of explaining it to Cas. It’s a little unfair because this involves the both of them, but Sam’s pretty sure Dean’s gonna freak (and that the angel’s gonna very much not), and giving him some extra time and space to process what’s likely to be some pretty volatile embarrassment seems like a wise move.
Dean occasionally glances back at Castiel in the backseat, the rearview mirror framing the angel’s face as he gazes out the window. Dean smiles to himself, a small and hidden thing, recognizing the look on Cas’ face from his own childhood spent on endless stretches of rural highways. To the uninitiated it might look like boredom, but Dean knows better. Cas is hypnotized by row after row of alfalfa working like a zoetrope laid flat, creating an ever-shifting fan of overlapping diagonals that blur in and out of focus as the car moves past at highway speeds. As a kid Dean would watch that for hours from his spot in the backseat -- the same place where Cas is sitting now -- while Sam slept sprawled out on the bench next to him.
“Is it what you wanted? I know it's no egg white omelet but…" Castiel deadpanned, head tilted and the hint of a smirk tugging at his lips.
, it looks like things are less intense. Like more milk runs, less, ya know, God’s entire immediate family.”
Castiel was thoroughly lost in thought imagining the egg guy grinning while he attempted to eat a wedge of fried egg like a floppy slice of pizza and didn’t realize he’d been staring off into space for the last several seconds. He also didn’t realize that said space happened to contain a pair of perfect lips that had curled into something that was either a chuckle or a cringe. Castiel should probably get better at discerning the difference.
This is how Dean finds himself on an airplane the next day, white-knuckling it all the way to California.
Sam brings a giant hand to his chest in mock offense. “I worked three days a week at the library in college.”
Sam’s got that faraway look of resigned confusion on his face, like this is just his life now, and lets out a simple “huh” while Dean slows the Impala and eases her onto the wide shoulder.
The last thing Dean hears before he drifts off into a blessedly dreamless nap is Sam muttering a sing-song “Hi Cas. ‘
When they get to the car the brothers strip down as much as they can without breaking any decency laws New Mexico might have on the books. They’re sweaty and gross and dirt is caked in all kinds of unpleasant places, and even though Dean and Sam are well versed in roughing it neither of them wants to try and sleep tonight without taking a shower. All that aside, they’re not about to stay here; they’ve slept in countless
“If you’d just brought me the damn eggs, none of this would’ve happened!” he said, voice hoarse from yelling. “Goddamnit, Cas.”
Between the tektite and the feather, I imagine that Cas keeps giving Dean things and he ends up amassing a collection of small random objects that have no power or meaning beyond simply “Cas” and “love,” which makes them the most powerful talismans Dean has.
Dean knows he has the kind of features and physicality that can go from friendly and open to closed-off and downright menacing with just the tilt of his head or the set of his shoulders. He thinks he’s settled into a pretty good place of “nothing personal but not interested” but that doesn’t stop a few people from trying their luck anyway. He’s flattered and he’s nice about his brush-offs, but he’s just not in the mood. His younger self would be disappointed to know that he’ll have apparently forgotten how to have a good time by the time he hits his early 30s, but it’s just that right now, still figuring things out after Bela, his idea of a good time isn’t
After a pause Castiel replies “Hmm, probably not,” so deadpan that Dean isn’t sure if the guy’s actually joking and slows a little. “I am not going to murder you, Dean. It was a joke.”
“Yeah, not really complaining though. Nice break from the greatest hits of all the worst ways Chuck’s thought about killing us.”
Dean could tell the real truth, that there was something incredibly unappealing about holing himself up in that little room that reeked of his childhood, watching faces that loomed claustrophobically large in the small space. That it had been lonely before but now if he tried it, without Cas by his side, it would be even worse. Or he could deflect, tell the
“It wouldn’t be painful, Dean. Well, not physically.” Sometimes Castiel’s honesty is a real pain in the ass.
“So uh, does it have a name?” Dean feels like an idiot just asking, but what the hell else is he supposed to do with this?
Cas either ignores Sam or doesn’t hear him. Instead he pauses to tune into his angel GPS, or whatever it is he uses to land with pinpoint accuracy three inches behind Dean, then announces “23 and a half miles from here.”
“So,” Dean catches Jo’s eye from across the room and gestures for two more beers, “If you get invited to a party and they tell you it’s going to start at nine, what time would you get there?”
bring him some gas. Either way, it was a plan and plans were good and Castiel could work with that. The problem was, when he pulled his phone out of his pocket and pushed the button to wake it up, nothing happened. He tried it again. Nothing happened. He held the button down this time for the five seconds he knew would restart the phone. Nothing happened. He held the button down for twenty whole seconds even though nothing he’d ever read about his phone had indicated that anything miraculous would happen if only you pressed the button for a desperately long time. Nothing happened.
Castiel takes a moment to think over his answer, and when it’s a simple and unhelpful “Yes” Dean has to work to keep the frustration off his face.
Castiel looks down at the lower half of his body, confusion obvious in the pull of his eyebrows. “No?”
“If it’s what you wanted you’d be excited about it!” Lisa shot back, her patented “my shitty boyfriend is fucking up but I don’t want him to feel bad so I’ll pretend he’s not fucking up” patience starting to slip.
Dean would be the first to remind him that Chuck’s been fucking with them their entire lives, even when he was just a prophet in a bathrobe, but Sam’s having a hard time reconciling that guy with this one. There was
“Holy crap, Cas!” Sam rubs a palm across his unblemished skin and looks over at his brother who, for the first time, looks like he’s actually buying that this whole universal rewrite thing might be legit. There’s real, naked relief on Dean’s face that Sam hasn’t seen since that night he killed Yellow Eyes a lifetime ago.
“Relax babe, I’m gonna make you feel so good,” Dean soothes, gently pulling Cas into a hug. “Tell me what you want.”
“All that I have ever asked you for,” Dean yelled, “is some fucking RUNNY EGGS. Is it so hard to get RUNNY FUCKING EGGS? I can’t even have ONE THING!?”
Cas stands there silently examining the wide array of contraceptives hanging on the wall, then moves on to the cigarettes, and is squinting intently at a package of “Boner Blasterz” when the clerk returns carrying a white box stamped with the name of a local bakery. “These,” Castiel gestures to the pills, “do not actually increase blood flow to the penis, and human flesh is certainly not malleable enough to withstand being stretched as much as would be necessary to fulfill these claims.” Cas’ face is scrunched up in thought as he gives serious consideration to the tensile strength of various human organs and structures. Unfortunately, Cas’ “thinking face” looks to anyone who doesn’t know him like an “I’m contemplating your imminent demise” face, so now the cashier is looking at Castiel with open alarm.
Now that his handbasket is precariously full, Castiel figures he’s purchased nearly everything he needs to replenish the Winchesters’ kitchen: beef jerky; eleven eggs; powdered donuts; pornography; toilet paper; beer; and 10.5 ounces of chili. Also 12 bottles of assorted motor oil. The only thing still missing is the pie.
"He's smart -- the guy knows everything, except for when to laugh at a joke.” Dean gets a far off look in his eyes, a reel of Data’s greatest and most endearing blunders flashing through his mind. “Or how to tell a joke. But he tries."
“Dude?” The cashier, who’s been watching this weird and definitely stoned guy wander around the store for the past twenty minutes, is really not in the mood for this right now.
“Yeah, you seemed more human and I thought it was good at first but… I guess I just like you how you are.” The subtle lift of Cas’ shoulders tells Dean the angel is pleased.
Cas actually manages to emote a little; exhausted or not, frustration is easy. “Dean, I called you offering to pay you for fixing my truck. You suggested an alternative, even asked if it was ‘too much.’” (Dean’s mouth quirks a little at the air quotes) “What exactly about you performing a service and me paying you for said service sounds like a date?”
hesitates. The glow of the Strip is a bright fluorescent dome over the northeastern sky, but here on the outskirts the streetlamps have the golden glow of someplace older, more familiar. It doesn’t even occur to Dean to drive into the heart of Vegas and stay somewhere nicer; even when the whole point is to relax and treat himself, it feels wrong to stay somewhere with soft sheets and too many other guests. So instead, they spend another night hovering on the edges of civilization where they’ll go unnoticed.
The guy furrows his brow, like he’s fighting through the stress of his day to stay present in the conversation, seems distracted but not impatient. After a moment he finally replies. “No, it really isn’t.”
Sam gets out -- slowly -- and starts to crawl into the backseat where he always sleeps when they do this. “Ah crap, sorry Cas, forgot you were there.”
For a minute or two, Dean considers Cas’ offer. He looks around the space trying to mentally recreate the Star Trek Experience, but it doesn’t really work and he suddenly wants to be anywhere but here. And anyway, he’s had more than enough time travel lately, thanks. “Thanks Cas, but nah. So, what do you guys want to do since we’re obviously not doing
“No no, it’s not that it’s…” Dean pulls the book out of the package and holds it up, ‘AUTHOR’S PROOF’ stamped across the cover. “Sam wants me to read it first, give my okay.”
“What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?” Dean’s tone is soaked with pleading for Sam to just leave whatever he was going to say unsaid.
There are growing pains, of course, as there are anytime two people merge their lives into one. Dean doesn’t have a whole lot of his own stuff, both because he never had the chance to start accruing things as a kid and because the expensive apartment Bela had insisted on had come fully furnished. And even if it hadn’t, he can’t imagine he’d have wanted much of what had filled their home; other than the clothes in his closet, a crate of records, and a worn cigar box full of old photos and the precious few small treasures he’d been able to keep with him on the road, there wasn’t anything in that place that had really been Dean’s.
Dean learns what Cas does for a living, something obscure sounding at the US Geological Survey outpost outside of town, though he’s quick to point out that he’s not a geologist (“I don’t want to overstate my accomplishments.”) and Cas learns about Dean’s family. There’s a younger brother named Sam who makes an unlikely living writing about serial killers, and a surrogate father in Bobby, the owner of that gruff voice that had answered the phone when Cas had called the garage and started all of this in motion. A surrogate father implies the existence of a
“This isn’t exactly a big town and the number of people who’re willing to spend a couple Fridays a month pretending to slay dragons is pretty small. And it’s not like we’ve never had mutual friends before. C’mon we both knew Andy.”
Dean throws on some sleep clothes and climbs into bed, guiding Cas down next to him and wiggling them both around until they’re nestled in and comfortable. At least Chuck had good taste in mattresses, Dean thinks bitterly. Nope, shit, stop thinking like that. Man this is going to take some time...
As Cas sets his basket down on the counter he looks over at the cylindrical pastry case at the end, expecting to begin a careful examination of each and every pie therein so that he may be sure he chose the best possible one for Dean. The sign above it says “Pie!” in large cheerful letters but the case is empty.
“Yeah actually, I don’t get those. You know,” Dean pauses, thinks, decides fuck it. “I have a pretty good TV back at Bobby’s.”
Dean looked… confused. “This, this looks great man. I mean,” Dean was practically drooling at the smell wafting up from the plate, “But I’m not sure you’re gettin’ it.”
Dean smirks, a stupid joke on the tip of his tongue that he wants to perfect before he gets over to Cas, but his face falls when he sees the small box on the table with the rest of the day’s mail. “Oh,” he makes plain his lack of enthusiasm. “I know what that is. It’s Sam’s book.”
Dean says one last thing that Cas doesn’t quite catch, but he does hear Charlie’s reply. “He’s a good guy. Talk to him.”
A short squawk of laughter bursts from the other bed before Sam can clamp his mouth shut, and Cas finally pulls himself away from the television.
he’s been writing about us?” Dean’s eyes darken and his shoulders tense and Sam can tell he’s gonna lose his brother to some pretty intense brooding if he doesn’t explain himself soon.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “Yeah that really doesn’t make me feel better. No one should have to deal with that much bullshit at work.”
away. I ran off to California again when we were looking for Dad, for what, one whole day? I left a few weeks ago, so sure I was out that I burned everything after like a few hours. But you’ve been doing this your whole life. You’ve never left.”
“You want to see more pictures of my car?” Dean has learned to keep his enthusiasm for his Baby to himself as much as possible. “You a car guy?”
“Well uh,” Dean wouldn’t normally do this, but the idea of walking back into the bar now that he’s escaped out into the still autumn evening sounds like torture, and something about this guy makes him seem like he might actually walk the few miles back to Sioux Falls because he’s too fried right now to think of a better solution. “I might be able to make it a little better. Or cheaper, anyway, if you were gonna call for a tow. I work at a garage in town and can take a look if you want.”
“Yeah. No! Wait hold on.” Dean drops his boots to the floor and slips his feet inside, not bothering to tie them. “‘Kay.”
. And the woman who owned the place had been happy enough to leave him be once she realized he was not going to be great company. But on a Friday night? Maybe he’d just go home and fall into bed and never return for his truck. Maybe he’d keep walking forever and become a drifter who scrounges up a living doing odd jobs as he travels across the country, mysterious and alone.
For Cas’ part, he keeps suggesting ideas that seem straight out of the second or third episode of The Bachelor. A visit to the butterfly house, a picnic at the falls, a pottery class. Hell he’d probably suggest a day of apple picking if there was anywhere nearby to do that sort of thing. And sure, Dean wouldn’t really be into doing any of this on his own (though to be honest he’d go to a pottery class if it meant he could make endless
when Cas had revealed his wings. Sam is wide-eyed and smiling that huge, nervous, excited smile that makes him look 12 again. “They uh, the angels are... really angels huh?”
“Well, we’re not sleeping for a while anyway and we’ll figure it out when we do.” Dean feels like finely ground shit.
The guy pops back into view up by the roadside and walks over to Dean. “Thank you, I…” he stares up the road leading away from town, “I think my truck ran out of gas. Or something, I’m not sure. And my phone’s dead.” The guy sighs.
A few minutes later, “Chris McVie” has booked a room at the farthest end of the motel. They’re not going to need seclusion tonight for bringing shotguns and machetes out to the car or their battered and bloody selves back in from it, but it’s habit and Dean doesn’t think twice.
“You like doing something that’s so bad you’d sacrifice yourself to prevent someone else from experiencing it?”
Castiel also knows that knowing something isn’t the same as doing something, and that humans don’t seem to pick up on caring unless it’s demonstrated.
Time finally up, Dean rinses off and steps out, drying himself quickly with a clean t-shirt before throwing on some sweats. Fuck if he’s putting jeans back on right now. Sam’s waiting by Cas with a dazed smile on his face, cheeks flushed from the almost-too-hot water Dean knows he prefers. “Dude, I didn’t even have to slouch to get under the showerhead!”
Kinda hard to write a soft lovey ending for this that’s canon-appropriate knowing that Cas will continue to randomly disappear on Dean for the next decade and Dean will continue to struggle with existential despair, but whatever. Dean can have a little Cas who sticks around, as a treat.
Dean hesitantly touches his hand to his mouth like he’s afraid of what he’s about to find there, patting his face with concern that quickly turns to a sort of cocky pride. Right as Dean opens his mouth to explain to Sam that some people really like that sort of thing, he’s interrupted by the unmistakable sound of rustling feathers and the small whoosh of air that comes from a six-foot-tall man suddenly occupying every cubic inch of a guy’s personal space.
Cas starts up the truck and Dean listens to the engine for a few seconds, his trained mechanic’s ear not picking up anything that sounds off. “I think you’re good now.”
Castiel couldn’t tell you how many eggs he’d cooked in the week that had passed since the egg guy had come in. It had to be thousands, all different ways, but the best two orders of the week had been the hard scrambled and egg salad he’d made for the green-eyed guy with lips so perfect he’d noticed them from clear across the room. Cas took pride in his job even though he was “just” a short order cook at “just” the Waffle House, but it wasn’t really what Cas wanted to do with the rest of his life, so any chance to liven up his day was appreciated.
One thing Dean does keep thinking about, though, is the idea of finishing up the carport into something enclosed, like a proper garage with a workspace for him and his tools. He keeps this to himself for the time being, though, because it seems like a big step. There’s moving in and then there’s building a fucking add-on, and while he and Cas have been pretty serious since date number one (“Two,” Dean reminds himself with a smile), even
When Cas turned back to Dean a few minutes later with the most elaborate egg dish he could prepare with the ingredients on hand, the pair were sitting in tense silence, Lisa looking pointedly down at her book.
The Hilton really isn’t far, especially compared to their starting point way back in South Dakota, but the drive takes for
Dean blows the steam from his coffee before taking a tentative sip. Nope, still too hot. “So you’re not…”
. Dude’s an angel, in case you hadn’t noticed. How’s he him if he’s not himself? Shouldn’t he just be Jimmy Novak?”
“Damn, I was really hoping to be seen climbing out of your car,” Charlie laments as they enter the bar. “She’s a real chick magnet. I had a whole plan.” They stop just inside the door, the redhead surveying the crowd and uttering a quiet “Bingo” when she sees a group of women staked out in a corner. “Alright Dean, it’s been nice but the ladies await.”
When Dean sits down in the booth the first thing he notices is how sweaty Cas’ glass of water is and the fact that all the ice appears to have melted. Then he notices the nearly empty beer. “Hey, have you been here long?”
“Uh, yeah, sure, I guess,” he said, pounding on his chest and trying to get the bit of waffle that had lodged somewhere to go down.
“Uh,” Sam says, pulling Dean’s attention away from the fearsome angel he was just cuddling. “Sleeping?”
Sam jerks awake, clammy face sticking for a moment to the surface of the map table. He’s fallen asleep in the middle of research again, that bullet wound he shares with Chuck continuing to sap his strength as it refuses to heal. He doesn’t think it’s killing him, but man is it a pain in the ass. And the dreams, visions, glimpses, whatever they are, yeah Sam’s pretty over those too.
Dean pauses, eyebrows pulled down, chin jutted, his entire demeanor radiating just how sick he is of thinking about how and why Chuck wants to micromanage every waking moment of his life. When he figures it out, though, his “Wait, you’re having
But before he can get out to the garage where Dean’s communing with his Baby and have the most awkward conversation of their lives, Sam gets a text from Cas. Cas who hasn’t been around for several weeks. Cas who walked out on Dean after Dean flipped out and tore the angel a new one instead of dealing with whatever shit he’d piled high onto his own plate.
Dean opens his mouth to reply but what the hell do you say to that? Instead he works his jaw a few times before turning back to Sam with a shrug and a “He’s never eaten a meal,” like of course, how normal.
Before Dean could stop him, Cas turned and was on his way back to the griddle. "Hey!" Dean called out. "
Dean’s starting to notice some things too. Paint splashes here and there that have just enough regularity to them that they could be some form of warding; a wind chime made of bones that--- are those cat and owl? Yeah okay, that’s definitely witchy. Now that he knows what he’s looking at, Dean can’t help but be impressed by how well this guy has managed to disguise the signs of hunting.
They get in the car and Dean gives Cas the deluxe tour, smoothing a hand along the leather seat and pointing out the tape deck with pride, like anything more modern would be an insult to his Baby’s classic status. Castiel keeps to himself the urge to explain that vehicles did not come with tape decks in 1967 and watches with interest as Dean turns wistful and says snippets of things he doesn’t elaborate on, like that he grew up in this car and still thinks of it as home. Then, with a sharp inhale and a shake of the head, Dean grabs a tape, pops it in, and off they go. He’s pretty sure Cas doesn’t notice him glance over to gauge his reaction to the Zepp that’s pumping through the speakers, and when Cas doesn’t say anything or roll his eyes Dean is pleased.
“Right. Actually, I don’t think there was any supernatural at all. Or if there was we didn’t know about it.”
Cas makes his way through the sandwich and silently accepts the glass of water Dean hands over to him.
"Uh huh." Sam has a look on his face usually reserved for when Dean's rambling through an increasingly thin cover story, and Dean shoots it back because what the hell?
Dean takes in both the brown and tan late-80s Ford and the guy who owns it and tries to decide if they make sense together.
“You’re welcome, Dean,” Castiel answers calmly, then turns his attention back down to signing the credit card receipt.
Cas takes the silence as concern though, turning away from the shadows he’s been watching crawl up the mountainside and looking instead at a Dean who determinedly does
It takes a moment for Dean’s awareness to expand into his whole still-half-asleep body, but when he does he realizes he’s back at the motel room, curled up on his bed, with his head and one arm thrown across Castiel’s lap. At first he thinks the sun must not be up yet because it’s so dark, but then he sees the darkness move a little and he recognizes that he’s looking up at Castiel’s wings arched above and around him. Absurdly, the first thing Dean thinks of is a blanket fort.
There’s a squat white building built right on the south rim of the crater, a few picnic tables out front and a parking lot with most of its spaces clearly painted for tour buses. Today things seem pretty slow, but there’s one bus and a couple of those rentable RVs parked in the sparse shade.
It’s wrinkled from being balled up at the bottom of his stuff and it doesn’t smell very fresh, but he knows it’s clean so it’ll have to do. Pulling it on, Dean tugs here and there at the sleeves and waist; it’s not that the shirt doesn’t fit, it’s just that it doesn’t feel right. In addition to the general vulnerability that comes with not being armored in layers -- vulnerability that he is absolutely
The next time Sam has a vision it’s back to the typical doom and gloom of Chuck’s usual work; Sam and Dean die in a fire, not a monster or angel or demon in sight. It’s bleak and it’s unsatisfying and it’s just very, very Chuck. Or at least, very this
The room might be terrible, but by some blessing the shower is actually decent and there’s enough hot water for both brothers to take their time, Sam taking his turn now while Dean putters around and finishes dressing. He’s got his jeans and boots on already, pulls on something with long sleeves and then shrugs into something
“Would, um,” Castiel cleared his throat, “Would you like to order something?” Cas had felt a frisson of excitement when he saw Dean walk into the Waffle House earlier, and again when Dean had sat at the counter, but now that Cas had to actually take the guy’s order the excitement was fading. Cas would happily engage in elaborate egg-based pranks with Dean, but would rather not have to actually talk to him while doing it.
Well, it's physically impossible for me not to turn everything into a character study so WHOOOPS let's talk about Dean's childhood. Next chapter will be fun stuff though, I promise. Also will probably be the last chapter.
Dean runs a hand from Cas’ shoulder down his arm, pressing harder than he normally would. “Like that?”
Dean sniffs sharply, thinks for a moment. “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’d like that actually. I should read it too, I guess. I wasn’t going to, was just going to tell him that whatever’s fine.”
The walk out to the sidewalk is a quiet one. Dean’s car is parked right out front and the two men stop next to it. For a long minute the silence continues until Cas says “I can see why you like this car so much.”
“Yes, I know that now,” Cas said as he finally turned back around and placed a small dish in front of Dean. It had what looked to the casual observer like a peeled hard boiled egg on it.
While Dean lays there justifying this moment of happiness to himself, the springs on the other bed groan a little in protest as a heavy object shifts itself into a sitting position. When Sam says “Hey,” his voice sounds far too loud for the room that had previously only been filled with the sounds of breathing and suddenly Dean is fully awake. He jerks up and way from Cas whose wings snap up out of the way, knocking over a lamp and making a dry, hollow, crumply sound as all the long stiff flight feathers are pushed into the ceiling. At the same time, Dean rolls over so violently he’d have rolled himself all the way off the bed if not for clutching at the cheap bedspread at the very last second. As it is, he still ends up half-kneeling on the floor.
“I’m observing the moths. They’re quite graceful,” Cas says right as the biggest one flies directly into the lightbulb with an audible
Dean thinks about this for a few minutes. “Alright, wait a minute. This is all great, you know, not having to save the entire freakin’ world every five minutes, but I got a few questions.”
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Dean was still looking at Cas, while Cas was looking at Dean trying to figure out why Dean was looking at Cas, resulting in a weird staring match between the two men. Cas got squintier and squintier while Dean’s eyebrows moved higher and higher and when Cas finally deployed a head tilt Dean barked out a laugh that said “what the fuck is going on here” better than any words could have. The spell was broken.
Mearle's Drive In was a real place in my hometown, but sadly closed down after a fire a few years after I moved away for college. It was exactly as
running a scrap yard as a cover for his collection, but it looks like Conrad’s leaned all the way into the “eccentric hoarder” guise.
“Okay well,” Dean senses that if he sticks around much longer he’s setting himself up for A Talk, and instead slaps his palms on his thighs for emphasis as he hefts himself up from the couch. “I’m heading out. Got an early start at the garage tomorrow. And
Dean frowns. “N’yeah I’m not convinced. Who knows what the hell she’s spending her life on but I don’t think it’s us. I don’t know, maybe.”
Castiel’s expression returns to its usual neutrality, seemingly satisfied with Dean’s answer. He starts to lift the lead box -- more like a chest, really -- up out of the trunk, not even needing to ask Dean if he’d rather the heavenly being with super strength carry the big heavy thing for him, but sets it back down when Conrad makes his presence known. Putting two and two together, Dean whimpers ever so slightly and moves to grasp the box himself. He and Sam awkwardly maneuver it out of the trunk, careful not to hit Baby, and follow Conrad as he leads them back into the sea of junk.
at when apart, creating internal apocalypses out of the smallest things, doesn’t take hold as easily when they’re together.
Out of the corner of his eye Cas saw someone slide onto one of the barstools at the counter, which was a bit odd since no one ever sat there unless the place was packed full, and the place was never packed full. This was a Waffle House, not a sushi restaurant where half the fun of the meal was to see your food get prepared before you eat it. No, this was the kind of place where most people made a point
Dean gives himself the briefest of moments to enjoy the confused discomfort Sam is radiating from the other bed, then gets back to feeling like shit even though it’s not like he’s the one who decided humans should lie to each other all the time. “Yeah, sorry.”
“Sam, can you fill her up? I’m going to go check out the snacks.” Dean nods his head at the little store built onto the side of the garage and hefts himself up out of the car. His legs are a bit shaky under him from the drive -- what the hell, they haven’t even been on the road for that long -- and he kicks his feet around to wake everything back up, scuffing his boots against the gravel and making a little dust cloud. Cas silently watches the dust swirl from his place in the backseat; he’s doing his cat thing again, and just like with cats it’s hard to tell sometimes if his aloof stillness is a sign of annoyance or contentment.
to get started. It’s the same with eating. He’ll get hungry and know exactly what to do to fix it, but he spends so long thinking about starting the process that the hunger fades before his inertia does. Well, so much for that, he’ll get hungry later and try again.
A crash and some muttered swearing woke Dean, and he smiled into his pillow as he heard Cas stumbling out of their room and into the kitchen, where pots started banging. Dean covered his face and laughed quietly. He was pretty sure that Cas thought he was being quiet, but if there’s one thing Dean had learned over the past year, it’s that his boyfriend was whatever the opposite of a morning person was. It took him at least two cups of coffee before he stopped glaring at people, usually wrapped up in blankets looking like a fluffy little owl as he inhaled enough caffeine for coherency.
Yesterday things had been brown, but today they’re red: the dirt, the rocks, the low barely-there hills that only register because everything else is so flat. Even the layer of haze that hangs in the air is red, little pieces of the desert itself kicked up by wind and twisted into columns by some of the biggest dust devils Dean has ever seen. Without the haze it would have been striking, that sharp contrast between red and bright cloudless blue, but instead it makes the sky seem like an extension of the land. It reminds Dean of the smoky glow he’d seen in the apocalypse of that future Detroit, a sort of vision within a vision of Lucifer wearing Sam’s face and reveling in the destruction he’d wrought.
Dean follows as Castiel heads through the kitchen to the door. “Hey Cas can, shit, can we talk? Fuck I hate this.” The last part is barely audible, said much more to himself than to Cas.
“Hey, did you forget something?” Dean asks the air above his head when he hears Cas come in behind him.
Dean stands, thinking about Cas, thumbs hovering over the keyboard, and realizes he has no idea at all how to answer.
When they get back to the room, Dean ushers Cas ahead of him through the door and points to one of the beds. Cas sits down happily and wiggles down into the mattress a bit to get comfortable, which is absolutely fucking adorable, and Dean sits down next to him, beer in one hand and TV remote in the other.
Dean had emphasized that last part but Castiel doesn’t seem to notice or care. He just takes the card, repeats his sincere thanks, and drives away.
“Okay. Sure.” This is not Dean accepting a gesture of gratitude, this is Dean wondering what the hell is going on. He’s been on dates with people who insist on splitting checks, sometimes because they’re just not feeling it and sometimes because they feel like it’s only fair, but he’s never had someone pull whatever the fuck kind of move this is. Actually no, he
Okay, Sam can’t keep this from Dean anymore. Whatever the hell is going on in Chuck’s drafts folder, this third time makes it a theme. Dean’s gonna flip, and honestly Sam gets it, the problems he’s having with the subversion of his free will and all that. But at the same time Chuck has clearly started seeing the same things between Dean and Cas that Sam has for the last ten or so years...
Just as Dean is about to break the awkward silence with an Icebreaker 101 question about Cas’ family, Castiel speaks first: “Did you know this is one of the oldest buildings in Sioux Falls?” He asks this with a careful friendliness, a practiced pleasant expression on his face.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas says to a bewildered Dean Winchester, who only has time to open his mouth before Cas blips back out of existence, the sound of flapping wings the only indicator that he was ever there. “What the fuck,” Dean probably says.
“I uh,” (part of Dean’s brain asks the other part what the hell it’s doing) “I can bring it here, you know, if you want.”
“Ask me that a year ago and I’d have said ‘Man I hope not,’ but now? I mean, ending up a grumpy old hoarder would mean we didn’t end up as a pair of burned out meatsuits, right?
-- asks for it. Cas is in the back, perched right in the middle of the bench seat for some reason, clearly basking in the small joy of being included on this journey, of having friends and getting to be a friend. Which, goddamn that’s sad as hell and if the clench in his chest is any indication, Dean probably shouldn’t think too much more about it or he’ll spoil the fragile good mood he’s cultivated for himself.
“Your eggs and sausage.” Cas was clearly pleased with himself. It wasn’t fried-ostrich-egg-pizza levels of genius, but it was enough to make up for the disastrous wink and it would definitely make Dean laugh.
-- I don't recall if the aquarium at Mandalay Bay was around in 2009, but it's really hard to think of things in Vegas that Cas might be into so...
“Hey hey hey hold up there Sammy, I see a little somethin’ else with my name on it,” Dean slips his hand in the basket and pulls it back out with a grin, balancing pie in one hand and brandishing porn in the other and looking extremely pleased about both.
. And Gabriel never missed an opportunity to laugh at me about it. You’d think after 50,000 years he could have thought of another joke.”
The cook turned to start cooking, and Dean forced his eyes away from the way Cas’ uniform hugged his thighs and tried to focus on Lisa, who was radiating discomfort.
“Cas, I’ve seen you do…” Dean gestures at Cas’ hands, which are now by his side but are still moving rhythmically. “I don’t know what that is, but I’ve seen you do it before. Kind of a lot, actually. It’s fine, it’s just a Cas thing.”
Castiel finally finds it within himself to express something other than awkward remorse and shoots some weapons-grade stink eye over at Dean. Instead of finishing up whatever Dean had cut short, he mulls it over silently and looks satisfied with his conclusion when he speaks up again. “Sam, I would like to try healing your bullet wound once more. May I?”
Cas reads the book over the next couple of days, and when he’s done he asks Dean to tell Sam he’s an excellent writer. “Also tell him thank you,” Cas adds a moment later.
“No.” Cas’ voice is flat as he walks directly into the bedroom, completely bypassing Dean. Cas had stopped with his disappearing act pretty shortly after Dean had caught him at it, but it looks like maybe he’s about to start up again.
Cas and Dean learn that both of them are from somewhere else, but that they’ve both been in Sioux Falls long enough that it feels like home. “You said your car does too,” Cas reminds Dean, which leads him to tell Cas the Cliff’s Notes version of his childhood on the road. The way Dean tells it, the car almost seems to have driven itself, the driver and his motivations (presumably “his,” presumably this is Dean’s father) remaining offscreen. Whatever the reasons, it seems Dean and his brother spent their childhood criss-crossing the middle of the country in the big black car he’d been so excited to share with Cas. It’s not a sad story, focused as it is on Sam and Dean’s adventures going from world’s largest this to world’s largest that, but it’s an incomplete one and it becomes clear to Castiel that there were only three people doing all this wandering, not four. He doesn’t ask.
“I dunno Dean, he said something way back when we first met him. Like the very first time we met him."
smiling down at Cas, and yeah they’re staring at each other and Cas still hasn’t moved his hand and damn, Dean thinks, this is awkward. He wishes that it would stop being awkward, but he’s not sure if he means that he wishes Cas would move his hand and Dean would look away or that they could stay here like this while the awkwardness blows on by and leaves them alone in the desert together.
“Don’t choke now, honey,” she said, before grabbing some of their empty plates and whisking them away.
Dean swallows, then continues on. “The other reason is that my dad… Everyone always wants to know about how. How we lived like this, how we got there, how he could do that to us. Or why. And god, it would be so much easier to answer that if the answer wasn’t so goddamn
do: get up, pace around, make a pot of shitty motel coffee, clean a gun… Whatever he’s going to do, he should do it soon because his knees are starting to yell at him from where they’ve been ground into the ratty carpet. Instead of any of those other things, he crawls back onto the bed and snuggles up to Cas again. Cas settles his wings back around Dean, shrouding him from the world.
“‘Bout equal,” Sam says with a snort. “And remember all that writhing around in debilitating pain and witnessing peoples’ horrible violent deaths I had going on? That was definitely better.”
Victor hadn’t been working the day Bela had shown up at the garage and made what can graciously be called a scene, but Dean knows he’s heard the stories. The “scene” had been an actual, literal crime -- probably a felony given how much she’d stolen -- and while it’s certainly embarrassing to be known as “the guy who was dating a con artist,” the reality is much less interesting and that only makes it worse. Bela Talbot wasn’t a mastermind, she was just someone who saw opportunities everywhere and had no qualms about taking them. Whether that meant swiping some easy cash laying unguarded on Bobby’s desk or getting involved with a man uniquely suited to letting himself get ground down under her particular brand of superior bullshit, it made no difference to her.
Once again, Mildred saved his ass, showing up and setting down a plate that had a piece of toast, perfectly toasted and… was that fucking egg salad? It even had that little dusting of paprika that most people forgot.
-- deserves. “So uh, am I gonna be turning into an angel or a mechanic or an… angel mechanic? How’s this gonna work with us? Don’t get me wrong, I am thankful to live in a world that wants to kill me just a little bit less, but I have had it up to here with being a character that someone else writes.”
This happened with Hell too. The images, the sounds, the physical sensations of that place confined themselves to Dean’s dreams, but the smells followed him into his waking life. It took months for Dean to stop getting whiffs of Hell every time he walked into a diner, the meat sizzling on the big open griddle smelling both delicious and disgusting. He knows it’s going to be the same with Detroit.
Sam finally glances up from his book, looking tired and unwell and probably a little apprehensive too because Cas can’t seem to talk to Dean anymore without irritating him. “What is that?” Sam gestures at the bundle in Cas’ arms.
Castiel looked at the stupid tin of cheap caviar he’d brought with him to work weeks ago, intending to serve it as the “second course” after the omelet. He really should just throw it away; Dean wasn’t coming back, and even if he did it was obvious that whatever game he and Dean had been playing was over. Worse, Cas wasn’t so sure now that it had ever actually existed in the first place. Grabbing the tin and getting ready to beat himself up again for the tenth time in as many days, Cas turned toward the garbage can beneath the counter and felt a familiar gaze on him. Looking up, he saw a very tired looking Dean sitting before him.
Hours pass, the sun sets, and Sam and Dean have finally chiseled a deep enough crack in the earth to haul this damn chest in and never think about it again. Dean wants to roll it in -- who gives a shit if it lands upright? -- but as the responsible one Sam insists they do it right and actually pick the thing up and place it down. As they’re shovelling chips of dirt back into the hole, Dean sees Cas slowly, silently making his way through the moonlit rubble and shoos him over.
“I don’t think it’s changing us, just everything around us, like our universe is becoming an averaged out version of everything these people have written. I mean, I don’t feel any different, do you? Think about it, Dean. What’s the one thing all these people -- people who seem to want us to be happy, or at least to have the potential to be happy -- could give you to make that happen?”
“Oh no, you’ve been so helpful about my truck and um, allowing me to say thank you.” Cas doesn’t look at Dean while he says this.
A bell jingles as Dean pushes the door open, and a leathery old mechanic comes shambling in from the adjoining garage where he must have been working. “Can I help you boys with anything?” he asks, wiping the engine grease from his hands and making his way behind the counter.
Dean spends more and more of his off hours at the little grey house, eating dinner with Cas before game nights at Charlie’s, changing the oil in Cas’ truck, surprising himself by becoming best friends with Meatball, making plans to learn at least a little about the bees come spring.
Cas puts a hand on a corner of the dryer and calmly tips it into place, dust puffing into the air to deposit one final layer of grime onto the Winchesters. Sam and Dean hold their breath for a moment waiting for the air to clear, then Dean turns wordlessly and starts back to the Impala.
. But it wasn’t ever about the eggs, and I’m sorry. It was unacceptable for me to yell at you and throw things at you. Even if egg white omelets are, frankly, a crime against nature.”
There was only one way Cas could make up for the wink from hell, and that was by getting Dean’s order just right. He turned his back to the couple, made sure he positioned himself between them and the griddle, and got to work.
“Yes. It’s important to you so I want to know about it.” Cas smiles, small but earnest, and Dean decides there isn’t anything hidden in this guy’s interest, that he isn’t going to laugh at Dean or judge him or think he’s dumb. This is not someone wanting to learn what Dean cares about so they can turn it around and use it against him. What this
“Guessing you don’t get invited to a lot of parties.” The second this leaves Dean’s mouth he feels like a dick for saying it, and regrets it even more when he sees how Cas’ face falls a little. It’s been a while since he’s been on a date with someone that he didn’t need to be constantly on guard around, and apparently it’s going to take a few tries for him to remember how to flirt with charm instead of snark. But before Dean has a chance to say anything else Jo arrives with their drinks. In the minute or two it takes for her to take their orders, the tension or embarrassment or whatever this is has diffused and when Jo leaves it seems like apologizing would only make things worse by bringing it up again.
Castiel does not relax and also doesn’t really answer, not in words. Instead he shifts in Dean’s arms, clumsily climbing up on top of the other man as Dean lays down and suddenly something unbelievable occurs to him. “...Is this your first time?”
Dean hesitates, bottle hovering for a moment before he takes a swallow. "What do you mean 'whoever?'"
those times that he popped into Dean’s dreams before he knew that wasn’t a socially acceptable thing to do. Dean only remembered the dream at the lake, but there were others. There were also the times Cas materialized in the bathroom with Dean, in the bedroom with Dean, a second time in the bedroom with Dean, right next to the bed while Dean was “reading magazines”,
-- The urban legend that there are bodies in the concrete of the Hoover Dam is actually untrue (over 110 people did die during its construction, however), but I figure Sam knows something the rest of us do not.
. Maybe it’s because he gets ten whole minutes under the hot water instead of the five it would be if he had to split time with Sam (best to be in and out as quickly as possible when you’re trespassing), or because the water pressure is doing some amazing things to his sore shoulders. Or maybe the bar is just
Dean’s worked himself up a bit, looks around a little embarrassed at how loud his voice got, but other than Cas not a single person here is paying any attention to him. They’re all engrossed in whatever they’re doing: throwing craps, laughing with the people around them, smiling, enjoying themselves.
They’re halfway to the Roadhouse, just enjoying the ride, when something occurs to Dean. “Is this---” He turns the music down. “Is this like the getting there early thing?”
to go up yet, or have to sit alone at a table for 30 minutes or parse what time is on time when it’s not the stated time, but this is just how it is. Castiel has been early and has been late, but he has never been on time for anything in his life. When his phone finally displays five minutes after the prescribed time, he leaves behind the spot where he’s been standing and trying desperately to be inconspicuous and heads up.
The tie issue settled, a part of Dean’s brain thinks he should be concerned that he’s laying in bed snuggling with his best friend. But it’s only a small part, and the rest of his brain tells it to chill out for a sec, like maybe there are other, bigger things to freak out about, and in the scheme of things this one is pretty minor. The world
” A loud, industrial noise stops. “Phone’s for you! Some guy says you gave him a card… No I don’t know who, didn’t ask… Uh yeah, I suppose he’s got a deep voice. Dean, why is that---”
The lone completed house at the end of the street is draped in those little triangle flags that Dean’s always associated with the grand openings of pizza joints. They’re probably colorful in the light of day, but tonight it’s way too dark for them to be anything but dreary. A big sign staked into the brand new sod of the front yard cheerfully asks folks to “Take a look inside!”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says simply, holding Dean’s gaze while he folds his wings back behind him, feathers brushing against Dean’s hand and arm. Without saying another word, he turns and walks back to the car, wings losing their luster and solidity and fading out of sight. By the time he’s back at the Impala they’re completely gone.
Dean’s eyes flick to Cas for the briefest of moments before he answers “Free will. So what, this tulpa comes with an escape clause?”
from between the pages of the other magazine. “That’s for me. I uh, I wanted to learn more about human sexuality.” Cas has never been a particularly skilled liar but this time he might have managed to pull it off because Dean looks… Is that disappointment? “You said men don’t talk about pornography together and so I thought the magazine could...” Cas trails off. He’s
“It’s an interesting question,” Cas comments. “Is he an individual, a being with personhood upon whom free will would presumably be bestowed, or is he an embodiment of the universe which is being changed and thus will he himself be changed, and how? The metaphysical nature of g---”
They’ve got another couple of hours on the road, but Dean’s already forgotten that he was ever tired.
Cas has a less than complete grasp on the fundamentals of financial transactions, but he’s seen Dean leave money on diner tables enough times to know that the process involves neither waiting to be told a number nor waiting to find out if you’ve guessed the correct number. This doesn’t make a lot of sense to Cas, but he trusts that Dean knows what he’s doing so he grabs all the individually wadded up bills in his coat pocket, dumps them in a tidy pile on the counter, picks up the handbasket and the pie, and walks out of the store.
Conrad is a guy who hasn’t tried to pass as a civilian in years, who has the kind of sour gruffness that Bobby pretends to have but really doesn’t. Bobby may be a crusty old hunter, but he has the benefit of being one who’s built a surrogate family around himself. Conrad went the other direction and withdrew, and it shows.
By the time Dean strolls through the door at 7:10, Castiel has had to twice reassure the attentive blonde waitress that yes he
Meanwhile, Lisa had taken a few bites of the toast (“No,” Cas thought, “I made that for Dean!”) and slipped her book back in her purse. Cas followed her movement as she placed a hand on Dean’s forearm, rubbing the rolled up cuff of his very soft looking flannel shirt and wordlessly indicating that they’d spent enough of their day at a Waffle House.
out of pure gratitude. That was until she set it next to his elbow and he saw that instead of runny eggs he now had what looked like hard scrambled eggs.
Most bigtime hunters have them. Like other wandering hunters, John’s was a storage unit, but this guy’s taken the same approach as Bobby. See, sometimes on a hunt you find shit you can’t destroy for one reason or another and instead just need to keep away from people, safe and locked up and in the case of Conrad and Bobby, buried in your yard under two tons of rusting steel. Bobby has the benefit of
“Hey uh, what are you doing in there?” Dean looks at Cas from the doorway of their bedroom, arms loose, face smooth, as disarming a posture as he can create.
He went back to his waffles, making sure the syrup was drizzled perfectly in each of the pockets, so when he cut into them he’d get that burst of sweetness on every bite.
Sam nods, squints and twitches as he tries to figure out what he’s seen, how to put it into words for Dean. “This one seemed… different I guess. It was definitely another version of, ya know,” Sam waves his hands around. “But it was, I don’t know.”
“I’m sorry, you seem to have the wrong impression. I am not trying to proposition you with honey. Also if I were, I would give you a piece of whole comb. I--- ” Cas interrupts himself. “How exactly is the honey supposed to be in my pocket? That would be very messy."
Dean knows Sam’s right, that he’ll be hungry long before they stop again for another meal, but he just can’t bring himself to care all that much as he works back and forth between the two slices of pie. He’s also aware that some small part of him is treating this like a last meal, not that he’s expecting anything to happen between now and dinner, exactly. It’s just the tinge of desperation that seems to have pervaded Dean’s waking hours since he found out why exactly he wasn’t in the ground anymore. The end is nigh, isn’t it? So why not eat dessert for lunch and drive halfway across the country to spend a few days letting yourself have fun. One last hurrah before you buckle down and save the world. Do your best to ignore that nagging voice in your head that tells you you’re being selfish, that the devil -- the actual, literal devil -- is out there somewhere and you should be trying to stop him. He’s going to take your brother, and you should stop him. But what if you can’t? What if this is one last hurrah before you fail and everything goes to shit.
Castiel knows Dean means in a general life sense, that he’s asking “where do we go from here?” about Cas’ job and prospects and state of being, but even so he can’t dismiss the first thing that popped into his head when he heard Dean’s question. “I want to go see the world’s largest fork. It’s in Missouri.”
Dean stirs, taking in a deep lungfull of the car’s stuffy air and stretching his limbs as best he can under the circumstances. Laying down, he can't see anything but sky when he looks outside, recognizing the fresh blue of early morning. It's pretty, sure, but he wouldn't have minded another hour or two. That's the other problem about sleeping in a car: the fucking sun'll get ya every time.
Bobby moves around the kitchen, tidying up to pass the time and wiping down counters that don’t really need wiping. The nervous levity that filled the kitchen just a minute ago is gone. Sam’s looking down at his coffee, unseeing; Dean’s leaned back in his chair, bouncing a leg and resting his eyes; and Cas is Cas so even with his eyes closed Dean is sure he’s being stared at.
“I could…” Cas gestures at the hole that, even after 30 minutes of work, is just a shallow depression.
There’s a reason most hunters die young. Dean used to think it was because their lives were filled with danger and homebrew healthcare, but now he’s wondering if maybe it’s some natural defense mechanism against becoming like
“Hey, I asked if we could get some coffee?” Egg Guy hesitantly waved a hand at Cas, trying to get his attention.
It doesn’t look like much as they drive up to it, so it comes as a surprise when Dean realizes that they’re at the rim of a mile-wide 600-foot-deep crater smack in the middle of nowhere. It’s like someone scooped a huge spoonful out of the desert. Not someone,
won this little battle so he picked an entire piece of toast covered in egg salad and shoved the whole thing in his mouth, chewing ostentatiously and making obscene “yum” noises. And damn, he had to give it to the weird cook guy, it might’ve been the best egg salad he’d ever eaten.
might be a good choice, but when he “reads” it (actually just touching the cover and absorbing the content in a single burst of information) he’s disappointed to find there isn’t a single article about salt rounds or witch-killing bullets or top ten reasons to bring a grenade launcher to a demon summoning. Cas doesn’t understand why anyone would want to read such an unhelpful magazine.
“You don’t understand,” Castiel growls, abruptly leaning forward and grabbing the cashier by the front of his cheap blue vest, voice and eyes full of celestial intent. “I
It’s the next night and Dean is over at Charlie’s to watch the season finale of a frankly terrible show that they both love anyway. The plots have gotten increasingly ridiculous over the years but goddamn if it doesn’t have some amazing characters, and at this point they’re far too invested to quit. Someone on screen stares menacingly into the distance as dramatic music swells and the scene cuts to black before the carefully set mood is completely undone by a loud, colorful commercial for a local amusement park. Charlie sees her chance and pounces.
that last relationship ended) -- a house that’s been open to him since he was a kid. Bobby finds Castiel peculiar, but Bobby’s been making family out of strays his whole adult life and the guy clearly makes Dean happy, so that’s more than enough for him to welcome him into the fold.
Sam’s tall enough -- or the neglected overhang is sagging low enough -- that he has to duck his head a bit as he leads the three of them toward the front door. Inside, the cramped interior is just as rundown as the outside would have you expect. It’s not that Mearle’s is a dump, but there’s only so much you can do to keep linoleum from 1961 from, well, looking like linoleum from 1961. It’s like this place had enough spark left to keep exactly one thing beautiful, and it’s poured all of that effort into the chrome U-shaped counter that dominates the space. Inside the U is where the magic happens: a big flat top griddle wafting curlicues of smoke sits between an ancient milkshake machine and a bank of fryers. Outside the U, the wall of the diner follows its curve, making every booth a window seat.
Cas leans back a little and ponders the question for a moment, suddenly seeming much less dangerous than he did a moment ago. “Cherry.”
“Hey, Stevie!” Dean’s hanging halfway out the office door, calling out to Sam. Sam pops his head up from the open trunk and easily catches the room key that’s tossed to him before Dean retreats back into the office.
Dean pushes himself up off Cas’ lap. It’s awkward and the position hurts Dean’s bad shoulder, but it doesn’t matter because suddenly Dean’s got his lips on Cas’ and even though Dean hasn't kissed anyone this chastely since the 10th grade it's actually kind of perfect.
Dean chooses to ignore the fact that Sam is now giggling slightly. “So, what does that actually mean, for us? Me and Cas us, you and me us, the whole world us.”
?) is slimy without being sleazy, smooth English accent and v-neck down to here working with all they’ve got to try and charm Dean into being a third for him and whoever he’s got at home.
There is no rebuttal for this and Dean knows it. In different circumstances he might be able to scrounge something up, but they’re on their way to go spend the day pretending a bunch of guys in rubber masks are aliens and it’s all Dean’s idea. “Alright fine, yes. I am.”
Castiel wakes up his phone and makes a sound of disappointment when he sees the time. He’s 17 minutes early and, despite what that Dean guy had implied, Cas is smart enough to know he can’t go up yet. He doesn’t
“Yeah I can see that, I mean what show?” As Dean asks, the channel number flashes in the corner, and he realizes it’s the same one Cas was watching when Dean crawled into bed the night before. In fact, Cas doesn’t look like he’s moved at all. “Hey, did you watch TV all night?”
The High Chaparral Inn is a squat two-storey affair that hasn't seen a fresh coat of paint in decades and with stucco so old the once rough peaks have been rubbed down to soft hills, grey poking up through dirty beige. Sam heads to the office to get them a room while Dean swings a couple of duffels onto his shoulder and Castiel stares up unblinkingly at the single extremely bright floodlight illuminating the crumbling parking lot. When Dean slams the Impala's trunk closed, the sudden noise breaks Cas from his reverie and he turns to stare just as unblinkingly at Dean, like he can actually see him in the dark, like his retinas weren't just burned to a crisp. Because they weren't. Dean never really forgets just how alien his friend is, but sometimes he doesn't quite remember it either. How can someone so foreign feel so familiar? It’s like---
“Sleeps?” Sam smooths his hair back behind his ear in a nervous gesture. “Bobby told us it was a book.”
“Are these really the only options though? The fuckin’ apocalypse or living like the world’s worst doomsday prepper?”
When Dean gets to the register he smells it again. The sharp odor of burnt cars, of charred plastic dashboards and melted seat foam and the sickly sweet of transmission fluid boiling off; the rot of old garbage piled up, never to be collected; of death and decay; of Detroit.
There’s an expectant pause from everyone at the table, and when Dean doesn’t order anything else Sam finally speaks up. “You can’t eat a slice of pie for lunch, Dean. You’ll be hungry again in an hour and I have to be in the car with you.”
The first time Dean had called it “Cas’ hole” had been a genuine slip -- one that had mortified him -- but now he’s playing it up because he’s nervous and overwhelmed, and when he gets nervous and overwhelmed he gets obnoxious. The fact that Cas doesn’t seem to get the jokes
The camper itself is like the whole yard, but in miniature. Junk is arranged all around it, but instead of big things like bathtubs and dishwashers, it’s smaller things: sun bleached milk crates filled with old cans of turpentine; a pile of bicycle frames held together by some spiny desert weed that’s grown up through them; and a huge, flat coil of metal cable that’s come unspooled under its own size and weight. Sam follows the curve of the cable with his eyes as it loops around the back of the Airstream, then crouches down to check something on the other side of the mass of coiled metal.
They’ve been driving a black car through the desert, and for the second time ever Dean is wishing he could change something about his Baby (the first time was when he realized it’d be so much easier to peel out in the parking lot to impress Rhonda Hurley if the Impala had a manual transmission). It’s not like they’ve never driven though hot weather before or had to crank the air conditioning, but this is something else. Hot air is rippling above the blinding asphalt, creating shimmery waves of heat that always manage to stay ahead of them no matter how far or fast they drive. Flat, monotonous landscapes are nothing new -- Dean’s criss-crossed this country more times than he could ever hope to count -- but something about the high desert of the Southwest is ominous and grand. It’s awesome, Dean realizes, but not in the way he usually means it.
“Hmm, true.” (Andy grins at this) “Now, are you going to mope in here all night or go out there and act like a grown up?”
“Woah, I’m sorry!” Dean yelps while Cas continues to squirm even after Dean has completely stopped touching him.
It’s Monday, one of the days that Dean and Cas’ schedules don’t overlap. Dean’s workweek is Tuesday through Saturday, at the garage at the asscrack of dawn because apparently there are people out there who need to get their tires rotated at 7am, which sucks, but at least it means he’s back home by mid-afternoon. It’s not bad, except for the fact that Dean’s out of bed so
Dean tore his eyes from the cook and his wild sex hair to his very clearly wrong eggs. Was this dude just fucking with him? He tried to smile, but it just felt weird on his face. He didn’t know why the eggs were bothering him, but they were.
“Oh, okay.” Dean nods. “Hey actually, why don’t we just get some gas in and see if that’s all she needs before digging around for tools.”
Cas looks at Dean a little longer, then turns his gaze out over the desert landscape before bringing it back to Dean. “I’ll take this road with you for as long as I can,” he answers with a smile.
Dean stares, eyes darting all over Cas’ face trying to figure out if this guy really does just constantly flirt without meaning to. Dean flirts all the time, light and breezy but always deliberate, whether he means anything by it or not; it’s a way for him to put himself and the people around him at ease. Cas, on the other hand, seems to flirt accidentally and reluctantly. It’s solemn, like he’s baring a truth he didn’t mean for anyone to see but that he can’t contain.
“Thank you.” Cas keeps doing whatever he’s doing with his hands but doesn’t zone back out so that’s a win.
Dean laughs at this but it’s a warm thing, amusement without mockery. “Alright, meet you there around seven?”
Cas drops it, wouldn’t have been able to hold it for long anyway, and starts to zone out again. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he says quietly.
“Yeah I was. Or, maybe I wasn’t, I don’t know.” Dean huffs out a breath, a quick laugh even though what he’s about to say isn’t funny at all. “I was hard. I thought it was kind of badass at first, to be honest. I was how I try to be sometimes now, you know. But after a while I saw that the hardness was all there was. How I was to the people around me... I didn’t treat ‘em well. I,” Dean has stopped walking now, and turns to face Cas. “I led them to their deaths. I led you to your death. On purpose, because I needed bodies and I knew you’d follow. I didn’t even give you a choice, man. I just fucking lied to you while you smiled.”
“You do realize a ziploc bag is a terrible way to store honey.” It’s technically a question, but Castiel is stating a plainly obvious fact.
“Aw look Sammy, we’re being invited in,” Dean jokes with a smile while continuing a few hundred yards past the spec home before pulling over to park. Getting out, Sam and Dean each grab a duffle of clothes and start to quickly decide who’s going to pick the lock, which door, and all the other details you need to work out while breaking and entering. Just as they’re about to start walking toward the house -- walk, don’t run, keep your head down and face away from where security cameras are likely to be -- Cas stops Dean and then Sam with a hand on each of their shoulders. Before they can say anything, the brothers find themselves standing in a dark living room, their boots pushing deep dusty imprints into the previously pristine carpet.
As they walk around, Dean is clearly having a hard time deciding which he wants his face to express: annoyance at Sam’s incredible nerdiness, or awe at Castiel’s creation. He wavers back and forth but settles on awe when he realizes he can get answers to all the questions he desperately wants to ask but won’t by just letting Sam do his “Get this!” Sam thing. Under different circumstances Dean would roll his eyes and pretend (or not) that he didn’t care at all about whatever Sam is yapping about. This time, though, things are different. He wouldn’t just be rolling his eyes at Sam, he’d be rolling them at Cas too, and he simply can’t bring himself to do that.
Dean sits back and watches as Cas methodically works to figure out what’s gone wrong; the guy’s process can be fascinating sometimes. Cas silently glares at each new thing he tries as he makes his way first through the remote, then the buttons on the TV itself, and finally the outlet. It’s when Cas is plugging the toaster into the TV’s outlet after having already tested it with a waffle iron that Dean decides to step in.
“Oh yeah, that.” Dean scowls a little, then flips the end of Cas’ tie around so it lays correctly. The tie immediately flips itself back. “Why is your tie always on backwards?”
“Yeah yeah, just get back to work. I’m not running a dating service here.” Bobby is clearly trying to look grumpy, but there’s a sparkle in his eyes as he shoos Dean away and it undoes all his hard work.
When Dean walks back out of the kitchen all the fight he’d been carrying across his shoulders is gone. He looks tired and maybe a little embarrassed, and if he notices that Cas can’t stop kneading his hands together he doesn’t say anything about it.
“You missed me, Cas?” Dean said, eyes brightening. When he smiled big like that, the corners of his eyes crinkled. He was beautiful.
“Okay then.” So Dean happily rambles and Cas asks questions and at the end of the night neither of them know anything more about the other than they had when the evening started except that Castiel loves his cat and Dean loves his car. And even though as dinner went on and the Roadhouse got busier and louder and Cas had started to seem distracted, maybe tired, Dean is confident that the guy has had a good time.
small -- grey bungalow situated far enough off the street that it’s sort of like Cas lives in the middle of a field. The house looks like it dates from the ‘30s or ‘40s, shows its age but mainly because unlike the others in the neighborhood it hasn’t been updated, not because it’s in bad shape. Also unlike his neighbors, Cas hasn’t taken much advantage of the acre his house sits on. His truck is parked under a covered car port that looks old (but not as old as the house), but other than that its just lumpy grass and a few small trees gathered close around the home. Oh, and a stack of boxes out back. Those must be the bees.
Another fifty after that, and Dean’s hungry again. Shit, he knew this was going to happen. Thankfully, Baby’s less than stellar gas mileage means Dean has an excuse to stop at a minimart and grab some snacks without having to come out and admit that Sam was right. The look on Sam’s face as Dean pulls into the no-name, one-pump station tells him it doesn’t matter and Sam knows it’s bullshit, but whatever.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean said, grabbing one last piece of bacon for the road and getting out of the booth.
Instead of answering, Dean sits on the unmade bed, busies himself with moving the blankets around to make some space. Cas sits next to him and for a moment they just stare at each other some more until it becomes clear to Dean that Cas doesn’t really know what to do with himself.
Sam picks up on something and decides it’s a good time to make a graceful exit, so he takes the handbasket from Cas (“Cas, you’re not supposed to take these with you, ya know.”) and heads off to the kitchen. Before he gets too far, Dean catches a glimpse of Miss November leering at him from inside the basket and calls Sam back.
“I’m thinking you boys rest up here for another day -- no offense but you look like crap -- and head out first thing tomorrow.”
“Oh.” Cas looks like someone gently punched him in the stomach, like he’s not hurt, just disappointed. “This is more of the lying, like with the prostitute.”
While Dean has a silent breakdown over what is essentially a closed amusement park attraction, Sam reminds the entire world why he’s the smart, reasonable one and walks over to a woman who’s clearing glasses off an empty table. “Excuse me, uh, do you know when this--- when the Star Trek Experience closed?”
The Roadhouse is the kind of place that attracts a crowd on Friday and Saturday nights, but because it’s early evening on a Wednesday the place isn’t too busy. A few families in booths here and there, an older guy quietly shooting pool against himself, a card game at a table in the corner -- not grizzled men playing poker but a couple of college-aged women playing some version of gin -- and Castiel sitting alone in his booth, drinking his beer and pretending to feel completely at ease.
Sam jerks his thumb back at Dean. “My brother wanted to see it, yeah. I know it’s closed, but do you know if there’s anything left over we can take a look at? Maybe pictures or something?” Dean watches as his brother treats the Star Trek Experience like a monster -- well, ghost really -- that they’re trying to track down. Whatever the vacation equivalent is of asking someone if they’d smelled sulfur, Sam’s doing it.
Dean’s about tell the man to find someone else when he’s interrupted by the blast of cold air that comes in through the front door along with the guy who’d opened it. At first he assumes the guy must be a straggler to singles night, but then he sees the weird look on his face, kind of a cross between angry and terrified and maybe also a little bit nauseous. And he’s looking a bit rumpled for someone hoping to score, like he read somewhere to wear a dress shirt on a date but just threw it on on top of the faded green t-shirt and tan cargo pants he was already wearing. On anyone else the combo might look like they’re trying too hard to be casual and cool, but on this guy it just looks sad. And maybe kind of endearing. And damn do those pants fit in all the right places, and anyway it's not as if Dean himself hasn’t shown up to Rocky’s dressed like a lumberjack.
“You got a twin brother I don’t know about or something? Because yeah. We did. Charlie?” Dean jerks his chin toward the kitchen and walks off, Charlie trailing.
Cas full on beamed at him, and goddamn he was pretty. Dean knew that men were supposed to be handsome, and Castiel was, what with the jawline and the stubble and the voice made of gravel but sometimes, sometimes he was just really fucking pretty.
“So, you boys lookin’ for a case?” Bobby looks at the three men. None of them answer and all of them look like they could use a whole lot of sleep, even the one who doesn’t sleep. “Or maybe you want to stay around here for a couple days? Recuperate, help me look for demon signs.” Nothing. “Well don’t all answer at once.”
welcome also probably has something to do with it. All told, Rocky’s is a good time. Or, usually it’s a good time. Any other time but tonight, it would be a good time. It’s just, Dean’s tired and grumpy and not in the mood for what he’s been roped into, and he isn’t above whining about it a little.
“He was nice the whole time, but it was like he got bored or just sort of checked out. And then he insisted on paying. Not even splitting the bill, but pulling some kind of bullshit charity move.
“Oh?” Dean’s been trying for about a minute to grab a napkin out of a dispenser that’s been filled way too full and has only succeeded in shredding the top few layers of tissue-thin paper. “Hmm, why’s that, Cas?”
