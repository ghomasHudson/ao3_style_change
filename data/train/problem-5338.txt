It was always so complicated with him, Castiel thought. He was used to the easy certainty of following orders – knowing exactly what was right, what was wrong, where to go and how to get there. But somehow Dean threw everything off. Castiel felt unbalanced around him – like he didn’t know what was right and what was wrong anymore. He only knew what he was
– and then the shifter had the front of his shirt and was lifting him until the toes of his boots were dragging weightlessly across the floor.
Dean felt like he was speaking through a mouthful of cotton. “Please don’t leave.” The silver sparks began to threaten at the edges of his vision.
They walked. Time sped up again, making it feel like only minutes had passed before the vampire stopped and pointed to a thick clump of trees and bushes ahead. Dean guessed by the light that shone through the leaves that the foliage led to a clearing.
, he had thought to himself suddenly, irrationally,
“The pick-up?”
The sky above them was a muddy grey-blue, dotted with wisps of clouds like torn up cotton balls. Dean watched the cars on the other side of the divider streak past, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel.
. Because- because -"
That must be why Cas had blood on his coat, Dean realized. He’d killed him. For a moment he wondered at the toll it must have taken on the angel, killing his brother. Then he realized the implication of Castiel’s admission. Uriel was working against them. That must be what had happened to the devil’s trap; he had been trying to kill Dean. Maybe there had never been any order to torture Alastair in the first place. If the order had been false, maybe the demon’s information had been false as well.
On one hand, he was glad, because his mind kept straying to the press of Cas’s fingers on his cheek, the curve of his lips in the morning light. But on the other hand, he thought, that meant that everything he’d said to Cas had been true.
“Fine,” Dean said again, this time with all the indifference he could muster. The expression disappeared. For some reason Dean hated himself a little for it.
“…out there, wouldn’t it already be widespread?” Sam was saying. He looked pale, the circles under his eyes standing out in a bruised purple against his skin. He looked up at Dean’s approach, frowning.
Sam is silent for a long second while Dean’s brain catches up to the situation.
Dean didn't respond, busying himself with covering his now too-cold exposed skin with the blankets.
“Well,” Dean stalled, “we’re in Pennsylvania now, but we lost some time in traffic today, so we’re gonna head out tomorrow to the granddaughter’s house.”
“Uh. Grohl and Cobain.”
The next thing he knew, he was being shaken awake. “Come on, Dean. You have to take it again.” Cas’s hand hovered over Dean’s face with the stupid eyedropper, the other on his jaw. Dean was beginning to feel like a baby bird. He knocked the hand away and took the eyedropper himself, squeezed the antidote into his mouth, shuddering.
So one day after sex, he sat up and said, in as casual a voice as he could muster, "So."
“My head hurts.”
“Jerk,” Sam replied automatically. He sighed. “Dean…” He seemed to struggle with the next few words. “Are you sure you’re okay? What really happened in the crypt?”
Dean choked on his coffee. “Sorry?”
“And you’re just okay with the demotion?” Dean asked sharply.
The shifter scraped at their face with their hands, gobs of gelatinous flesh squelching between their fingers and falling, quivering, to the floor, where Dean sprawled feet away, picture frame forgotten. He felt his gorge rise.
Cas something – something important – but he couldn’t quite remember what. He squeezed his eyes shut through the ache in his head, listening to Cas’s hurried footsteps throughout the bunker as he gathered the ingredients for the cure. A loud
“Man, you’re really fucked up over him, aren’t you?”
Her eyes were narrowed to slits. “I think you’ve asked enough.”
“Yes,” the shapeshifter said with Cas’ mouth. “I saw the way you looked at your handsome friend here. It’s pathetically obvious, you know. I do wonder if he knows how you feel about him?” Their eyes – Cas’ eyes, the same blue Dean had been dreaming about for days now – slid to the side yet again, thinking. Accessing.
They sat in silence for a bit, Dean intensely aware of Cas' every movement and change in breathing although he kept his eyes trained carefully on his hands. He thought that it should probably be tense, but it was like all of the tension of the last few hours had improbably drained away, leaving just the cool evening air between them.
This seemed to be enough for Cas, who nodded and turned to look out the window. He started to rattle off rapid-fire guesses, one after another. “The sky is blue. That sign is blue. That vehicle with the broken mirror is blue. There’s a nest of starlings in that tree.” He pointed, glancing back over his shoulder to make sure Dean was looking. “One of them is blue.”
. But Cas didn’t seem to be about to say anything; he was simply watching Dean with an odd expression, his head slightly tilted.
There was a barely perceptible pause that caused Dean to look up, before Cas cleared his throat faintly and agreed, “Yes.”
Dean was thinking that it felt very nice to touch Cas; he was wondering why he so rarely did so before. He felt vaguely like there was some reason he wasn’t supposed to touch Cas. He had been afraid that something would happen, perhaps. Trying to remember what he’d been afraid of was like trying to hold water in his hands, though; Dean soon gave up and just marveled at the feeling of Cas’s arm around his shoulders as he helped him to the bedroom. He laid Dean on the bed and Dean closed his eyes, wincing at a new pain in his stomach now to add to the pain in his head. He felt something at his feet and opened his eyes just a crack to see Castiel tugging his boots off at the end of the bed. Dean felt a peculiar sensation of warmth bloom in his chest. “Thank you,” he told him.
“Um, T equals… k… times T?” That didn’t sound right. “Minus y or something?” Dean looked hopefully at Cas, who was wincing.
Cas held up yet another index card from a pile he held in his other hand, studying the back. “What’s Newton’s Law of Cooling?”
“Okay,” Sam repeated. “Just… try to fix things with him, whatever the problem is, alright?”
It was always the sounds that hurt the most, instead of the wounds. The sharp crack of snapping bone. The scream that reverberated through the tiny space. He felt his own throat vibrating with it. He heard his own voice, too; rough, desperate. “Cas, please,” he was saying.
Dean watched him curiously. “You said they thought you were getting too close to me. And Sam. What did you mean?”
He’d needed to make sure.
"The road to hell," Dean mumbled.
Castiel had not expected this response. “Good things do happen, Dean.”
“No booze at the motel. Or here.” Dean turned his back to the angel as he pulled the hospital gown off and yanked on his shirt. He was thankful the nurse had left his jeans on.
On autopilot, he prodded his side gingerly, taking stock of the damage. He didn’t think any ribs were broken, but there was definitely going to be one hell of a bruise the next day, if it wasn’t already forming now. His leg seemed the same – difficult to walk on, but intact.
“There is a God.”
you know this, Dean, that wasn't actually me."
Adelaide was gripping the arms of the chair tightly, her fingers gone pale with the strain. She whispered, “Who are you?” at the same time that Dean persisted, getting louder, reckless now, “Was she a demon, Mrs. Moriarty?”
on Charlie’s end.
And Dean kissed him.
Dean lowered his face to the tabletop and began to gently bang his forehead on it, punctuating each impact with a word. “Fuck. My. Life.”
Dean stared at him, his heart beating like it was trying to throw itself across the table.
But Cas was smiling, mindless of Dean’s stumbling. He flipped his hand over to catch Dean’s, lacing Dean’s cold fingers with his warm ones. “Of course I’ll have you.”
“How are you feeling?”
Benny just taps his temple, then indicates Dean. “I can always tell.”
Dean released a shaky breath, feeling both better and much worse. “Okay.” Thinking,
"I'm awake," he said finally, struggling to think of something else to say. His eyes stung, whether from the smoke from his dream or something else, he wasn't sure. He felt like he should feel shame, somehow, but all he was aware of was Cas’ worried gaze on him, the oddly comforting weight of it.
Like, sometimes when Dean cooked dinner for them while Cas researched whatever case they were currently on, and they were arguing about something stupid like putting pineapple on pizza (Cas
Cas had shaken him awake, his hands cool against his sweaty skin, saying his name, "Dean," and then louder, when he was struggling to wake up, "Dean!"
“Oh. Okay.” Dean blinked. He picked up his bag and clapped a hand on Sam’s shoulder, trying gamely for jovial. “Alright, Sammy, don’t burn the place down. I’ll call you in Pennsylvania.”
But as they settled back down to sleep, Cas’ arm tucked securely over his chest, he couldn't bring himself to care.
Cas, God. The fact that Castiel had stayed up all night with him, taking care of his pathetic ass like he was a baby. He’d practically made Cas get in bed with him, for God’s sake. Oh, it was humiliating. He almost wished for some new apocalypse, just to put him out of his misery.
– my dad asked me to do, and I couldn’t even do that.” The words surged from him like a river overflowing its banks and Dean realized he was drunker than he’d thought. Drinking on an empty stomach, he thought. Not a good idea.
Cas felt uncomfortable. “I, uh…” He trailed off. “My superiors have begun to question my sympathies.”
“Just one more question, ma’am, and then we can release the full sum of money.”
He left to get them coffee while Cas was still asleep, but by the time he got back, Cas was awake. Dean greeted him with a cup of black coffee and a kiss that lasted longer than it probably needed to.
The air was blessedly cold on his face when he opened his eyes, dragging himself into a sitting position. He sucked in air in great lungfuls, trying to clear nonexistent smoke out of his airways.
Immediately, there’s a crash and a stab of pain in his foot. “Ow, fuck.”
"I love you," he told Dean, his voice a steady, low rasp.
“What?” he said stupidly. Then he realized what had happened: the power had gone out.
The vampire, a fair haired man who looked vaguely Victorian, spat out a venomous, “Fuck you.”
It had gone on for months. And the stupid thing was, Dean was actually happy. And it seemed almost like Cas was happy, too. But Cas was a nice guy. Like, genuinely nice – not just nice, but kind. Everyone knew it, the guy had tons of friends. So Dean couldn’t be sure if he was just being nice or … something else.
The cheap vanilla ice cream was heavenly on Dean's tongue, sweet and cold. They ate in silence for a few seconds, both of them absorbed in the temporary pleasure, before Dean spoke again. "So, you have any plans for after finals?"
The rain was falling hard now, droplets dashing themselves against the windshield with a chaos that matched the chaos in Dean’s head. They passed a billboard that proclaimed, in letters larger than life,
“There’s something about this whole, you know…saying how you feel…thing,” Dean admitted, feeling a little foolish. “It makes me feel…happy.”
“You look like shit,” Dean replied. He kept his eyes carefully trained on the coffee pot and not on Cas, who was watching Dean with his usual lack of self-consciousness. “You mind?” He gestured irritably to the pot, talking to Sam despite the fact that it was closer to Cas.
“Ding ding ding, we have a winner.” Dean grinned. “Okay, now you go,” he instructed.
He jerks upright in bed without even really intending to, thinking vaguely,
Even as he said it, he didn’t believe it. He didn’t understand why Dean was necessary for the interrogation of the demon. There was nothing Dean could do that he and Uriel could not. Cas wasn’t even sure there was anything they could do to get the information from the demon regardless. The whole thing seemed like it was nothing but an exercise in cruelty.
Cas' eyes blazed bright blue and for a second Dean thought he might hit him. He thought that he might welcome it if he did.
“Yeah.” She shrugs, apparently giving up on him to go look for something in her room. “Just go to the dining hall.”
And yet he couldn’t stop thinking about it. It was starting to drive him insane.
The room was very quiet when he finished speaking, and he realized that Cas was staring at him, open-mouthed, the expression at odds with the way he was standing as if he was ready for a fight.
"Bull crap!" Dean shouted. "Of course we need you Cas! You're family. You're our best friend. You're my best friend. I know things have been rocky in the past but that doesn't mean you're not needed!"
"You love it!"
"I love you Castiel."
"A few minutes, tops." She answered. "We can have it finished with time to spare if I have absolute silence."
"Crowley...."
The best part, though, was getting to catch up with all the girls. They learned that Maggie had moved to Rome to study theology. Both Maeve and Marie had gone into Mass communication/media studies over at MSU. Siobhan had gone into psychology while Kristen was busy running the local dinner theater with her parents. They all kept in contact with with each other, even though they had all moved on with their lives. Marie told the men that after the play they had all agreed to stay close friends and keep a look out for each other. An event like that tends to bond people.
"Not exactly..." Sam grimaced. "Look, Dean, I really think we should..."
"No!" Dean couldn't believe what he was hearing.
"What kind of deal?" Dean growled.
Cas squinted his eyes at her, tilting his head to the side, obviously confused by her question. “Very much so, yes.”
Suddenly, Aziraphale felt himself pulled backwards and slammed up against a wall. Crowley kissed him hard enough to take his breathe away, his hands sliding up the Angels arms before coming to rest on the sides of his neck. The demon took a deep breath, drowning himself in Aziraphale's scent before pulling the angel's head to his chest and leaning into his ear. "You know that I love you, too."
Thank you all for not turning me in to the proper authorities.
Marie let out a sigh and rolled her eyes in return. "No, Dean. He sticks to mostly plot points and storylines. Your precious shower thoughts are safe." after she strode into the kitchen, Dean let out a sigh of relief and followed behind.
"Good." Dean slammed the cabinet shut. " Call him and tell him to take his
Adam chewed for a bit, seeming think that over, then swallowed. “They're aliens too, then.” It was more of a statement than a question.
It was quiet for a moment, while Sam thought the question over. “I guess it is kind of hard to keep your chin up when you choose to live this life.” He resigned. “But that doesn't mean I can't try. I let myself get pulled back into this life. I was happy, I was free. I had someone I loved, and because of her, I let myself get dragged back into the life I spent so much time trying to get away from. After Jessica was killed, I... I let myself turn into my father. I was so focused on revenge that I denied myself the opportunity to ever be happy again. Who knows what I passed up because I couldn't stop blaming myself for what happened to her? Love makes you do crazy things, I guess. I didn't even realize how bad it was, how crazy it all seemed until...” until I saw what Dean went through after purgatory, he thought to himself as he looked up at Cas. “You can't hold your mistakes against yourself forever dude. You gotta learn to forgive yourself sometimes, now more than ever.” He watched as the angel fidgeted with his hands, trying his best to look everywhere but Sam. “Are you seriously telling me there's nothing? Not one thing you want, one thing you're willing to let yourself have, even at the end of the world, that would make you even remotely happy?”
Aziraphale sighed and rolled his eyes. "Yes, I know that but, well, this one has a sword with him, from heaven it would seem..."
Crowley smiled back, shaking his head. " No, I don't."
“We understand why you have your reservations about us.” Aziraphale added. “Dean has told us some about your world, of the events that have transpired in the recent years. Let me assure you, our intentions are not to bring you harm.”
"Ha, yeah I forgot about that." Dean chuckled. They found themselves clapping as Marie drove a stake into the beast and watched it explode. If only that was the weirdest part of the whole thing. Shortly after, they watched the robots take the stage, which had now been set up to look like space.
Cas smiled patiently and shook his head. “Believe me, I would have if it were possible. My powers are limited at times and some things take more power than others. If I use too much of it, it drains me.”
"It's the truth." Dean shrugged. "I do dig chicks. Doesn't mean I don't dig dicks, too. It's called being bisexual, but I guess we'll have to discuss that later."
"Oh, fuck you!" Dean said catching up.
"What are you even doing here Chuck?" Sam demanded.
“You could at least pretend to look like you're not giving up completely, Samuel.” Rowena chided, she flipped another page in the Book of the Damned, reading through it like she didn't already know every word forward and back.
“Great.” Dean groaned. He scratched the back of his head and let his eyes fall to the table. So much for saving the world. “You at least gotta help me get back home. Please... I gotta get back... I can't just leave ' em there...” He felt tears beginning to well up behind his eyes.”
Ouroboros was such an amazing episode! My mind is blown.
Sam flinched as he listened to various items fall on the other side of the wall that Dean punched, but he kept moving. Dean was on a warpath through the bunker and he had to catch up to him before he did (or said) something really stupid. "Dean!" He called after him again, not that it did any good. Dean just shook out his hand, letting the blood from his knuckles splatter across the floor, and kept walking. It's not like Sam didn't expect this kind of reaction. Dean does anger better than anyone he knows, and when he isn't ready to process any other emotion that may be plaguing him, that anger only intensifies. He hadn't even let Sam get passed "traded his life for Jack's" before he was out the door, face fire truck red, as he screamed obscenities through the halls. Sam narrowly dodged the chair Dean threw behind him as he turned another corner, trying to keep up with his brother’s pace.
*******
"Why?" Crowley asked, still trying to wiggle away. " What did I ever do to you?"
"That's not what I'm saying Dean!" Sam huffed. "I just think this whole thing should be monitored carefully. We might need something like this again in case…"
“Dear Satan!” Crowley shuttered. “I’m a demon and even I think that's evil!”
Dean thought for a second, racking his brain before it clicked. “What? I love you? I was pretty sure that was implied.”
“Kid!” Dean jogged up to them from the other room placing his hands on Adam's shoulders. “What are you doing here, man?” He shot a disapproving look to Anathema.
“Dean?!”
"No…ahh...oh.. " she moaned still trying to pull Dean away. "Ooh…fuck…Dean...yo…your brother…!"
"But we're all good right?" Dean asked. "Chuck’s locked up? He can't get out?"
"Whatever." Claire mumbled as she and the other girls gathered up the dishes. They walked around the island and the three began whispering to each other, giggling as they worked.
Dean flung his arm around the Angel before he could escape and squeezed him as tight as he could. "Don't you dare." Dean said. "Don't you dare leave me again. I asked you not to leave me the last time I saw you. I asked you to stay and you left me anyway. Don't you dare ever leave me again."
*Also, also: I have a Tumblr now ( for the time being)
Cas's head shot up, eyes glowing bright, stopping Dean in his tracks. "I am not a child Dean! I do not need your protection, nor do I require your consent!"
******
“Heya, kid.” Dean said crouching down in front of him.
“I surely hope so.” She said. “For all of our sakes. Heaven knows what good we'll be against God without the help of an angel on our side. If the spell doesn't kill him, knowing your brother is lost forever certainly might.”
He was lost to them forever.
"Well that's stupid." Crowley chuckled. "We have done more for this world, good and bad, than any other angel or demon could ever dream of. Sure, we may have reversed the roles on who did what a few times, but it was still us that did it. We helped stop the bloody apocalypse, for Hell's sake. Twice. None of those other useless dingbats can come close to what we've done."
Crawl in your head through your ear.
"What are you doing?" Crowley asked, backing away from the angel. "No. No! Don't you dare. I don't do hugs. Get back." He stopped when the back of his legs hit the bed and was scooped into Aziraphale's arms.
Castiel huffed out a sigh, eyes not leaving the bar. "I find her freckles nice to look at, I suppose. Her eyes are nice, familiar. I like green."
"My name is Jack." Jack said carefully as Meg continued to inspect him
it's a fucking lot.
“Yes.” Aziraphale replied. “With each other. Castiel did it on his own, before he even knew the heavenly father didn't care."
“My family's back there.” Dean choked out. “ My brother, Cas, all of them. I can't just let them go. They're all I have. I... I can't...”
"What?" Dean scoffed. "No. No way! Look Cas, I'm glad you got your wings in full working order again or whatever, they really saved our asses back in that grave yard, but zappin from place to place still isn't exactly my favorite mode of travel. No offense."
"That won't be necessary, Dean." Aziraphale insisted, although sound relived at the change of subject. "Crowley and I don't require any sleep. We wouldn't want you to have to go to any, unnecessary trouble on our account."
“Claire was my vessel's child.” Cas answered “After I stole her father away and got him killed, along with her mother's passing, I figured it was my responsibility to step in as a sort of parental figure. She does not answer to authority well.” Cas chuckled. “ And yes she is very pretty. She does better with Jody now, though it is my understanding that she has been having a rough time since Kaia's passing.”
“Perhaps,” Cas allowed.
“Everybody’s dying these days,” Dean spat. “And hey, I get it, you’re all-powerful! You can make me do whatever you want, right? But
Dean blinked at him. “Okay.”
The next thing he knows, there’s a burst of light invading his pleasant dream, forcing him into consciousness.
He grumbles a little.
The thing was, he always forgave him. Every time. It was like he had no choice but to forgive him. He didn’t understand, frankly, how it happened that every time he thought it was the last time, that Cas was gone for good in one way or another, he found himself right back here. He didn’t
Castiel looked surprised, like this hadn’t occurred to him. “You could never lose me.”
“Oh. Sorry. That must have been a pretty boring night.”
"Did you say anything else?"
"You know what, Dean."
“Hey, bitch.”
Cas looked around, searching the contents of the Impala. His face lit up. “Is it this?” he asked, holding up his tie.
Dean was already drifting back into what passed for sleep now – it was more like a frothy, red-tinged wave that carried him into a semi-consciousness state. Barely aware he was saying it, he responded, “You can’t love me.”
Just before the burn of cold metal, he was being shaken awake by hands on his shoulders, rough and slightly frantic but much more real than the dream.
Sam picked up on the second ring. “Hello?”
Dean went.
When he walked out to the car, Cas was waiting in the passenger seat, his hands in his lap. He was watching the sunrise through the windshield, the glass turned orange in the light.
Dean nodded and left.
On one hand, that meant another failed lead and another dead-end for the demon cure. On the other hand, that meant that the trip would finally be over. And that was a good thing, right?
Dean had meant to kiss him gently, lovingly again, saying all the things he wanted to say, but as Cas kissed him back, his hands pulling at Dean until they were pressed together intoxicatingly close, Dean forgot he had anything to say at all, focused only on the noises Cas was making now and the movement of his mouth against Dean’s, and the kisses began to get frantic, out of control, almost sloppy. The warmth in Dean’s chest had turned into outright heat, spreading throughout his body irresistibly like liquor. His mouth seemed to open of its own accord, his tongue touching Cas’s lips, which parted for him hungrily.
Dean Winchester. He was gonna lose Cas now because of it. He was watching it happen. And he couldn't even blame him.
Cas started towards him, seemingly ignored by the shifter, but Dean caught his eye and mouthed the words, “Silver. Car. Go,” with as much emphasis on the last word as possible. There were guns and silver bullets in the trunk, and he could only hope Cas could both identify them and use them, and preferably do so before Dean got himself killed.
or even an
fix it was to do so alone.”
“What?” Dean demanded.
He opened the door to leave, and without intending to, Dean blurted out, "No, Cas, stay." Then, heat rushing to his face, he snapped his mouth shut. "Sorry," he apologized. "You can go if you want."
The next morning, Dean had decided how it was going to go. They could work together, sure. He didn’t care, wasn’t bothered by it. Cas had been under the angels’ control, and now he wasn’t, so it wasn’t like he was going to try to kill Dean again. And if he did, well, Dean could defend himself, because he wouldn’t be taken off guard this time.
Cas sighed, looking strained. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to him if we don’t find this demon cure.”
He came to thirty seconds later with his face stinging. “Dean? Are you okay?” God, was Cas slapping him? Dean opened his eyes to see Cas with his hand inches away from Dean’s face. Wow.
“No.” He yanked the vial out of Dean’s reach. “Only a couple drops at a time. Open your mouth.”
In the shower, he remembers that he was going to call Sam. He had his last final exam a few days ago, and he hasn’t talked to Sam in a while. He’d do it after getting coffee, he decided. He couldn’t manage it without caffeine.
“For what?”
She didn’t look convinced. “And what does England have to do with whether or not I knew her?”
There was nothing else for it. "So, we're just friends, right?"
Dean stood up abruptly. He was suddenly starving. He set out for the kitchen with an unsteady gait, lurching like a man who had been lost at sea. Behind him, Cas called out in exasperation, “Where are you going?”
“Kitchen,” Dean informed him. He made it a couple more steps before his rubbery legs gave out and he found himself unceremoniously on the floor. Cas crouched next to him. “Here, open your mouth.”
“You have any plans? Not visiting family?”
Sam’s face fell, and Cas grimaced.
At the same time, her eyes were illuminated in the sunlight streaming in from the window and with a shock, Dean watched them gleam with an inhuman flare, there and then gone in a second.
He hesitated. He knew Cas would probably just sit at the table and read anyways, and they were perpetually running low on cash these days, so wasting money on another room wouldn’t exactly be a
Dean felt like he’d been punched in the gut. “Lucifer?” he croaked. “The apocalypse? What does that mean?” He felt bewildered, a cornered animal. He fixed upon Castiel like a man drowning and clung to the weak bolt of rage that shot through him. “Hey!” Dean barely registered the pain in his throat. “Don’t go disappearing on me, you son of a bitch. What does that
After the second hour was up, Dean was feeling quite sure he would be in the fraction of people who don’t survive the cure. He was shivering, sweaty, and his stomach hurt like he had been stabbed. His head was still aching, but at least it didn’t seem to have gotten worse.
Dean turned back to Castiel. “What’s going on, Cas? Since when does Uriel put a leash on you?”
Cas was quiet. He seemed to understand even before Dean himself that Dean wasn’t talking about the apocalypse – not really. And Dean continued, unable to stop himself, “I couldn’t save Sam. He died, and I didn’t get there in time. I couldn’t protect him. And now I can’t protect him from Ruby. Every time I try, it just pushes him further away from me. The one thing –
“Read the Bible,” Castiel intoned, moving closer. “Angels are warriors of God. I’m a
Cas made a questioning sound, still focused on his self-assigned task of making Dean's brain melt into a puddle of actual goo. He paused to tug at the collar of Dean's shirt in order to expose more skin, and Dean remembered himself long enough to groan, "We should go inside."
“We’ll find it,” Dean said firmly. “If I need to beat the demon out of Crowley himself.”
Castiel sighed, which was amusing in some far away part of Dean’s brain. “The witnesses, Dean.”
Sam sounded taken aback. “Sure, Dean, yeah. You’re right.” He paused. “You seem different. Aside from just making up with Cas, I mean. Like… something about you feels different.”
The things he’d
They inched forward another two feet. Dean turned to face Cas. “You’re supposed to pick a color that’ll make it hard for me.”
Cas jolted uncharacteristically, the expression sliding off his face as if it had never been there. He shifted his gaze back to the horizon through the window.
“Yes.”
He’d had one final left, so at least he had some excuse for seeming like he’d vanished off the face of the earth. It had gone fine, despite Dean’s emotional state being generally awful. Cas had helped him study for it throughout the semester, and it turned out the material stuck.
"I mean, you know, because we've been spending a lot of time together and you've met my friends and I met your brother that one time, so I was just wondering if - you know -" Dean cut himself off with some difficulty, closing his eyes briefly with actual physical pain at his inability to just keep his mouth shut.
“Dude, wake up.”
Castiel knew he’d said too much, and yet somehow, he felt like he hadn’t said enough. The space between himself and Dean felt unbelievably vast, but he felt certain that – if he reached out – he could almost touch him.
“You didn’t know that, Cas.” Dean looked at him oddly. Was he trying to apologize? Dean’s head was beginning to ache.
Dean gaped. “
Dean lifts a hand in greeting, trying to look like he hadn’t just gotten out of bed five minutes ago. Evidently, he fails, because Charlie tilts her head and says, “How are you doing, Dean?”
“I feel strange, Cas,” Dean slurred. “What did the spell do?”
“It’s a game,” Dean said, starting to feel foolish.
Oh, it was so weird.
“How much?” Dean asked loudly, and her eyes snapped back to his. She told him and he paid, then went to retrieve Cas. He neglected to mention the conversation to him.
or an
Cas nodded, and Dean dialed.
cat back in the bag. I’m pretty sure there isn’t even a bag anymore.”
The air outside is crisp and cold, drops of rain splashing down on his head. He walks faster and faster, feeling lighter and lighter, as if there’s some invisible rubber band stretched tight between himself and Cas, and it’s getting looser with every step. He’s soaked from the rain in a matter of minutes, but he barely feels it.
Castiel leaned in to kiss him again – deliberate now, almost languid – and Dean met his lips eagerly.
Benny's eyebrows go up. "He doesn’t want to be with
Cas saw it and he stepped forward automatically, his eyes on Dean's hand. "Let me heal you," he said brusquely.
Dean breathed a small sigh of relief. “Okay, well, we’re heading home today,” he said. “Went to the old lady’s yesterday – it was a bust. Long story short, it turns out she was killed and replaced by a shapeshifter? Apparently that happens.”
“Nuh uh,” Dean disagreed, vaguely aware of how they sounded right now. “I know where we are.”
He clasped their hands together and soon they began to glow with a pale golden light. Dean closed his eyes, feeling the familiar intimate warmth of healing - of Cas - flooding through his body, repairing each damaged cell individually. When he opened his eyes, his ribs and his leg no longer hurt; in fact, there was a distinct lack of pain all over his body, a rare sensation for him.
“My – that’s not something I can see!”
When they got to the car, Cas let go of Dean for a moment to open the door and Dean slid to his knees in the damp grass in front of him, grabbing at Castiel’s coat. “Cas,” he said urgently, trying to broadcast directly into Cas’s mind.
“Cas is fine.”
Cas leaned back in his seat, his eyes searching the road ahead of them. “I Spy… something… ”
Dean wanted to protest, but out of reflex he was already scanning the surroundings, looking for silver objects. The car ahead of him began to roll forward, but before he directed his concentration back to driving, his eye caught on a silver sedan one lane over. It moved forward as he watched, the sunlight glinting off the shiny paint.
Cas shrugged, but his tension was betrayed by the stiffness of his shoulders. “No, well, I just wasn’t sure if there – if we were – ”
“The demon cure, you mean.”
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Dean took his hands off the steering wheel to twist them in his lap. "It's a saying." He risked a glance at Cas, who was nodding, seeming pleased by this knowledge.
Cas looked unimpressed, but he reached out to touch Dean on the forehead once more. One second, wind was rushing violently past Dean’s ears, the world transformed into a blur, and the next, they were sitting on comfortable stools at a nearly empty bar. A man nearby fell off his chair in shock, but otherwise they seemed to have gone unnoticed.
He put his head on the steering wheel and just breathed – in and then out.
He frowned. “What’s wrong with it?”
“Concerns? There are people getting torn to shreds down here!” He was getting tired of this dance; he was ready for some straight answers. “Where the hell is your boss, huh, if there really is a God?” He wasn’t sure where the question came from; only that he hadn’t intended to ask it.
“No, you won’t,” Dean and Cas both said simultaneously. Dean ignored this and plunged ahead alone. “You’re way too sick. You’re not going anywhere.”
Castiel hesitated. “Think of the seals as locks on a door.”
And Cas had gotten up and started pulling on his clothes.
Dean faces no such obstacles, since he’s of age and the bartender knows him well enough by now to know this, so he doesn’t bother to ID him when he orders a drink.
the trip or anything – he just wasn’t in as much of a hurry to get back as he might have been. And yeah, the two of them were talking again and maybe even playing games, but it didn’t mean things were back to normal or that anything had changed.
“Oh.” He concentrated on preventing his guts from making a break for it. “Cas?” He just couldn’t stop himself.
“Why do you even drink coffee, man? Do you even taste it?” he asked, unable to help himself.
Ten minutes later, he was padding into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes, the fading dream still prickling at the edges of his consciousness. Yawning, he dropped his hands and froze – at the sight of Cas himself sitting at the table with Sam, apparently deep in conversation. A large pot of coffee sat between them.
Cas didn’t respond immediately and Dean suddenly felt a terrible sense of urgency. He heaved himself onto his side with a great deal of effort in order to blearily meet Cas’s eyes. “Cas,” he said. “I’m sorry.” The words seemed to spill out, getting faster with each one. “I treat you like shit sometimes – all the time – and it’s not fair to you and if you ever decided to leave, I wouldn’t blame you. But - ” He stopped to ride out a wave of pain in his head, and then continued uncertainly, “ I think I’m not supposed to say this and I can’t fucking remember why, but I just want you to know – “ he broke off again, his sudden burst of energy draining away. “I don’t want you to go, Cas.” He realized he had tears in his eyes. “You’re my best friend.”
Dean has to admire the guy’s boldness. “Maybe,” he allows.
“You look…you look like an angel, Cas.” Dean grabbed the front of his coat.
Slowly he became aware of a presence. He walked to the kitchen, where Castiel stood watching him. He squinted at him. “How long have you been there?”
need to know all of that. Sam told him about the research he’d had been doing, with Cas chiming in with new information from the books he’d read.
They usually studied together in the library, but that day they were in Dean's dorm for the first time, sitting at the small table in the kitchen, papers spread out haphazardly over the surface.
He dragged his fingers lightly back up Cas’ hand, marveling absently at how easy it was to touch Cas like this, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Without thinking, he reached out, closing the gap between them, and recklessly touched Cas’s face, smoothing out the crease between his brows with his thumb. Dean let his hand rest on Castiel’s cheek, feeling mildly out of control. “I want to tell you,” he repeated, his voice suddenly husky.
Once they were halfway to the room, Cas had apparently decided they’d gotten far enough and turned to kiss Dean roughly, pushing him up against the nearest wall. Dean kissed him back, hard and deep, and was unable to prevent a strangled groan from escaping his lips when he felt Cas’ thigh slide between his legs. He clawed at Cas’ coat, gripping a handful of the material and holding on for dear life, distantly hoping the motel was really as deserted as it had seemed when they’d checked in.
They stopped at a diner on the way to the motel they were staying at in Illinois. It was there that Cas tried to bring it up for the second time.
Castiel was now quite close. “I’m not here to perch on your shoulder. We had larger concerns.”
Dean had been prepared for this. “Yes, uh, the money has been tied up with the state due to a clerical error in the filing of the will.”
So Dean found an interesting case that seemed like it might take his mind off things. A rash of killings in a town nearby, all under mysterious circumstances. A dead body covered in burns from no apparent source, reports of a woman drowning in a sink, a cop who had been eaten alive by beetles, pretty standard stuff. So Dean and Castiel had gone to investigate it. And that’s how they’d ended up here, in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, trying to chase down an amateur witch about to make a very stupid decision.
There was a silence, both of them thinking. Then Dean tried to slump back in his seat, his body coming down from the adrenaline of the last couple of hours, and his ribs scolded him for it with a stab of pain. He inhaled sharply, putting a hand to his side.
Dean thought of cradling Sam’s body in his arms as he died, his blood slippery on Dean hands. He thought of his father on the floor of a hospital room just like this one, and the half-remembered heat of the fire that had burned his mother alive as he carried his baby brother into the cool night air. He thought about what Alastair had said as Dean had tried to torture him. He hadn’t been able to save anyone; it was true. “I can’t do it, Cas. It’s too big.” He turned his face away from the angel so he couldn’t see the tears overflow. “Alastair was right. I’m not…I’m not all here. I’m not strong enough.” He struggled to take a deep breath, his throat feeling like it was closing up. “I guess I’m not the man either of our dads wanted me to be. Find someone else. It’s not me.” He turned away.
"I'll give you two a moment while I go fetch Aziraphale to finish patching you up." Rowena smiled, leaving the two of them alone.
"You haven't slept in days." She said. " Or eaten. While these are things that may not be necessary for someone like myself, it is my understanding that they are thing that humans require."
2: Cas's deal with the Empty pisses me off. I just want the damn guy to be happy FFS! Now I have to hope that he stays miserable forever. Thanks a lot SPN writers.
"Just a suggestion." She shrugged. "It might open your eyes to a few things you don't understand. I get not wanting to relive those times but…if you ever decide that's something you might wanna do, hit me up. I can tell you what chapters to skip, or whatever. And, if your really curious about Dean's relationship to Castiel, 'On the Head of a Pin' is a good place to start. The torture chapters are pretty rough, and I know you'll want to skip over your parts…but the other stuff.…" she shrugged.
“Then what do you call this?” Sam snapped, gesturing towards his inebriated friend.
Truly I am sorry for that, but sometimes pain is necessary. And, like I always say, you can't spell "Supernatural" without "crippling depression"
Dean had had enough of their games. It was time to get some answers. “I was gonna ask you the same thing.”
"No." Dean shook his head. "There's a difference." He fiddled with the buckle on Cas's pants.
"As I'll ever be." The angel said. He looked up and nodded in Aziraphale and Crowley's direction, purposefully avoiding eye contact before turning his gaze on Sam. "Sam." He nodded, giving him another pleading gaze.
Aziraphale turned to see Crowley sitting on the edge of the bed with his face down. " And it's safer here, how?" He asked.
"You were right. She was our best shot." Dean assured trying his best to keep him still, so he didn't hurt himself. "What happened wasn't your fault. None of it was your fault."
"Thank you, Dean."
"And good riddance." Added another.
"Dean." Cas croaked out, wincing in pain. "Dean I'm so sorry. I should've got you out of there sooner, I... I'm sorry."
"What are you talking about, Charlie?"
"Crowley, I don't see what this has to..."
Cas jus narrowed his eyes and set his jaw in response. Dean let out a laugh and shut the door behind him. Screw gay chicken, he thought. This could work out just fine.
He reached down and squeezed the angel's hand, prompting Cas to look over at him. Dean leaned into his ear and repeated the officiant's words along with Siobhan, in a whisper. “ I, Dean, pledge to be your loving friend and partner, Castiel. To talk and to listen. To trust and appreciate you; to respect and cherish your uniqueness. To support and comfort you through all of life's joys and sorrows. I promise to share hopes, thoughts and dreams as we build our lives with each other. May our lives be ever intertwined, and our love keep us together. I join my life with yours. Where ever you go, I will go: whatever you face, I will face. For good or ill, in happiness or sadness, I take you as mine and will give myself to no other. Should we be separated by death, where ever I am, I promise to wait for you.”
"Huh?" Dean replied, utterly dazed.
" What do you want to talk about, huh?!" he sat up and placed himself on the end of his bed, refusing to look at his mother. "How God wrote frickin books about my life? How people have actually read those books and know intimate details about me I don't even talk to my brother about? How the people who read those books seem to think I'm banging my best friend and write stories about us?! How he and my brother, the two people in this world I trust more than anybody, are having a grand ol' time making fun of me about it?! Or! OR, do you wanna talk about the fact that my own FUCKING MOTHER thought we were in some weird gay relationship!?"
Cas stopped dead, rolling his shoulder and cracking his neck. "You want to know my 'deal', Dean?" He bit out, air quotes and all, without turning around.
Cas didn't hear him at first. He wasn't paying attention. His focus was fixed on the odd display of affection the other angel was showing for the demon. It wasn't too odd he supposed, Dean often showed similar concern for Castiel when he was injured (Castiel worried over Dean as well, but for entirely different reasons) so maybe it was just concern for his friend’s wellbeing. Still, it made him uncomfortable to watch anyone get to close to something that belonged to Dean.
Dean was starting to get self-conscious. “...yes...” He looked back at the other two, who just shook their heads back.
"Hey, now!" Dean chuckled. " Actually, you know what? You're probably right. Coulda saved us all a lot of grief." The two of them sat and laughed for a while on their respective sides of the door. "I'm sorry you had to go through that,
"No, Cas! I can't lose you again!"
“Hey, things happen. Thank you though. Can I ask you a question, Adam?”
The team splits up to put part 1 of the plan into action.
“Do you believe in aliens?” Dean smirked.
"I mean I'd expect this kind of shit from Crowley, but my own fucking brother?"
"I was there!" Jack said, taking a few steps closer. "It said it wouldn't take you until you allowed yourself to be happy! You said…"
*Edit*
Chuck moved towards her, only for Cas to whisk her to the other side of the room when two burst of bright light shot just past Sam and Dean and hit God across the back, causing him to stumble Amara stood behind the shakily, holding both her hands in front of her. "It's over, brother! Enough!"
A new pain washed over him when he remembered the loss of, what was, for all intents and purposes, his son. His last hope in making his life on Earth bearable. He and Dean had been at odds for longer than they were okay, but Jack had brought him new light. Every time Dean had pushed him away, he could take solace in the fact that Jack would make things better. He had something, someone that was born of evil to look after and mold into something good. Someone to teach and care for, like Dean had done for him. There was a small part of him that thought if Dean could see him turn the Devil's son into the world's savior, maybe he would finally see Cas's worth. That maybe they could become a family, and Cas would finally have a place where he belonged.
The alarms began blaring the second all the lights shut off. The sound of screams and stomping feet began echoing over the noise and Sam and Dean took off running. Neither of them knew why they headed to the war room first, but they did, and the alarms stopped the second they reached it.
"I mean like, being friends with a freaking vamp." Sam answered, coldly. "Yeah, Benny wasn't like the others, and I get the whole 'brother's in arms' aspect, but it still doesn't make sense." He waved his hand, gesturing back at the book before letting it drop. "That Dean? That Dean would have never put his trust in a monster. That Dean wouldn't let people back into his life that had screwed him over, and now…I don't know, now it's like he just doesn't care about letting people in that who could hurt him, or…people who already have."
“Are you sure you locked the door?” The second voice came again.
"Oh, like you did all that much to help!" Dean smirked.
I never thought it would ever go
"Crowley!" Aziraphale yelped, trying to pull his sleeve from the demon's grasp. "Crowley, where are we going?"
“But you have healing powers, too.” Adam insisted. “Couldn't you have healed them sooner? That's what I would've done. It seems like your wings would've been more useful sooner.”
"You're completely gone on that angel, boy." Crowley smirked. "I may be a demon, but I would hate to contribute to the destruction of true love."
“Just a question.” Crowley said holding up his hands in surrender. “No need to get up in arms.”
"We need you! The world needs you! Your mother..."
"Oh, are you?" Crowley replied with a smirk.
“I thought you said that I was only allowed last night.” He teased.
“If you two are quite done playing kissy face,” Crowley called from the car, “I’d like to get on the road before rush hour! The M25 is a nightmare.”
"Dean..."
Cas quickly schooled his features, donning his usual stoic glare. "I said 'you win', Dean." He huffed. "I'm sorry. I'll drop it." With that, he turned and left the kitchen.
"Oh, Crowley, really." Aziraphale scolded, pulling the demon away before sticking his head own head through. "Mr. Pulsifer! Good morning, no need to be frightened, it's just that this is a tight squeeze and…oh, there she is! Alright." Aziraphale straightened up and back away. Moments later the rest of the rift appeared. "Very well then." He said grabbing the demon’s hand. "Until the next time, dear fellows." He smiled. The two of them stepped through the rift and Sam stepped behind them. He recited the spell, just as Rowena had taught him and captured half of the rift in switches orb as the other half began to disappear. The three of them stood in silence for a while staring at the orb, wondering about the next time they would use it, if ever.
Two days.
"Why?" Cas asked bitterly, placing himself back in Dean's space. "Because you love me?" Venom dripped off each word, causing pain to shoot through Dean's chest.
"Another chapter? Whaaaaat?"
"You see, I would, but this story has gone on long enough." Chuck said. "Ever since Castiel went and killed all my monsters, it could take years now. I'm done. And so are you."
“It makes one wonder why the Almighty chose to make our worlds so different.” Aziraphale went on, seemingly oblivious to Sam's increasing frustration. “We don't have anything like these things on our world. Oh, sure there're witches and all that, but nothing quite so savage as what I've read about so far.” Sam groaned again slamming his phone down and crossing out Krissy's name as well. “Things like this reside in story books where we're fro....”
"COOL IT, SAM!" The both of them snapped.
"Yes I do!" Dean yelled. "You've given up everything to fight for us! Why won't you let me do the same?!"  Castiel stood silent, and swallowed hard, the sound of footsteps running down the halls lending an eerie ambiance the feeling of hopelessness falling upon the room. "You're bleeding." Dean said nodding toward Castiel's hand. "Aren't you going to patch that up." He could feel the wet streaks streaming down his face.
"What's to stop him from letting history repeats itself?" Aziraphale finished quietly.
Dean's eyes went wide in panic as he tried to think of some way to change the subject. "Yeah, man! Of course, you can help me out!" He said, a little too loudly. "I'll show you how to make...that thing...so you and Aziraphale can have it when you get home."
"You'll have to explain all of that over dinner." Jody nodded. She walked over to the door and pulled out a knife before flipping up to corner of the rug and scratching away at some paint from the devil's trap. She flipped her knife closed and tucked it away, walking towards the kitchen as she spoke. "C'mon, let's go eat before you get washed up. Hope everyone likes lasagna."
"Well, we were a little preoccupied with other things at the time!" Aziraphale shouted back, grabbing the table behind him for support as the ground shook beneath him.
“Yeah.” Dean nodded, trying as hard as he could to push the images of his time with the Mark from his mind. “Wasn’t even running on full cylinders at the time. To top it off he was also hunting down other angels at trying to get 'em all back upstairs. Still managed to show up just in time to stop me from killing me brother.”
Sam nodded his understanding biting his lip. It was sad how obvious it was to everyone except Dean. "I think he always has been. I'm pretty sure he's not concerned about you taking him ...as a lover...or whatever. They don't have that kind of relationship. Cas has always just been content being near him. It's actually kinda depressing. Especially now, with his deal and all."
"What you wanna yell at me too?" She growled. "Gonna call me stupid? Wanna take a swing at me? You already insulted my family, so you're halfway there! Come on! Come at me like you did him! I can promise you I'll do a lot more than tell you to fuck off!"
"Cas?" Sam said, coming up behind Aziraphale. "Hey, man you okay?"
"So much for just being characters..." Dean grumbled under his breath.
"Alright then." He nodded. "Rest well. And don't worry about me. I'm sure Sam will be able to assist."
“Meaning...?”
"Probably not!" Dean huffed, feeling less and less inclined to fall for her charms. "But you damn well better believe that I'll try. You, of all people, should know better than to underestimate a Winchester. Especially when it comes to the things we love. And, if I succeed, and you're right I probably won't, but of I do.... that'll be on your head!" He felt the fury and power in the room building around him, but he didn't care. " I gave you the chance to stand by my side, Amara! And you refused. So, when you're brother dies, you'll know that you only have yourself to blame!"
“ Thank you, Dean.” she said before kissing him on the cheek and taking her plate to the table.
"I didn't get it." Dean said, his voice distant. " I didn't…I didn't understand. One minute he tells me that he made this deal, that he sacrificed himself, for us, next thing I know he just starts…he starts telling me all these things…"
"Right." Aziraphale half chuckled to himself. "Well, it seems I have bit of a situation here I could use your assistance with."
"Why, now?"
"And on that super depressing note," Gabe said "I think it's time me and Hot Pants head out. We can settle the rest later, this place is kinda killing my high. So, I'll just take the kid and...."
"He's dangerous." Gabriel boomed. "But he might be useful, too."
fair warning: a good majority of this chapter is Dean's POV. our five main all have a section, but a big hunk is dean...for reasons. i hope yall dont hate it too much. there is a suprise at the end!
“Sure thing, Castiel." She smiled. “ You take care of my son, you hear me?”
Cas squinted at her, confused by her sudden casual attitude, given the situation. “A band. Led Zeppelin. The tape was a gift fro...from Dean.” His voice cracked on the hunter's name.
Dean's response was cut off when all the phones in the bunker started to ring. He looked around as everyone shook their heads and took off to answer them, giving him hateful looks over their shoulders. Aziraphale and Crowley were the only two to stay behind. "Why do I make Cas so unhappy?" He sniffed, looking at the two of them with pleading eyes.
"Why?" She snarled.
"Shut up, man" Sam said. He laughed and nugded the angel's shoulder. "You and Meg though, that's pretty funny." Both men seemed to be in good humor about their outrageous pairings.
"And what do you know Gabriel? You abandoned Heaven as well! You have been gone far too long to know the horrors that Castiel brought upon us."
“Not an option.” Dean shook his head.
I promise this is going somewhere soon. I just have to get this intro chapters out. Thank you so much for sticking with me!
"Step aside, Angel." Crowley said taking off his sunglasses. "This is the devil's work.
“She...” Aziraphale leaned back his face a mixture of excitement and confusion, “...what?!”
"You got it, lady." Dean smirked.
Castiel dramatically rolled his eyes letting  out a strained sigh, gripping his half empty beer bottle and placing it to his lips. "I believe I just did, Dean." He mumbled before taking a long pull of the amber liquid.
“Discorporated.” Crowley corrected. “You know as well as I do, that plain bullets can't do us any real harm. Though, I suppose, given the circumstances, we might not be returned to our Heaven or Hell if that were to happen. Where do you suppose we'd go?”
" So?!"
"Is that...?" Sam began
"You keep your mouth shut, Hell whore!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"C'mon Sammy, we've lived a long life, For hunters, at least. It's inevitable anyway. Why fight it. Kill him, Chuck." Dean said.
"I'm sure those crocodile tears didn't hurt either." Crowley said as he sauntered behind Dean back towards the library.
Because Dean always swore it was their fault. That everything was. They both did. It was the Winchester way.
He was conscious for all of six seconds, before a burst of power followed by a blinding light sent them flying back and the bunker crumbled in on itself.
"They have suffered enough by your hand." Cas continued, without sparing a glance at the two of them so as not to draw attention as the tried to make their escape. "I will not let you harm my family again. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way, Father, but you will leave them out of it."
"Oh, I know all about you Castiel." Jody smiled, side eyeing Dean. "It's nice to finally meet you in person.
Hi my name is Dingo, and I'm a mess.
“We’ve been over this.” Dean grunted. “Cas ain't 'my angel.' And that's not why I did it. I was saving people.”
“I suppose that's a way of putting it.” Aziraphale smirked. “You know it's alright to be afraid of some things, right Dean?”
"It's not enough."
"Yeah, well I don't like it."  Dean huffed. "Sam....why are some of these marked as 'read'?"
"Whoa now!" Garth chuckled " you telling me Dean willingly went off with a demon? This really is the end of the world."
"Dad…"
"Then you look terrible. Worst I've ever seen you. Seriously, I'd be embarrassed to be seen with you in public." Dean shoved past his friend to the door and opened it. "I'm going to get some coffee from the lobby, and a snack. I didn't get to finish my lunch." He plastered on one of his snarkiest smiles. "Can I get you anything? You must be starving?"
Crowley stopped reading for a second to glance up at Dean. “I didn't 'choose' anything.” The demon replied before looking back at the paper, though Dean could tell he wasn't really reading it anymore. “I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. The group of people I was with decided to act out and God happened to be in a bad mood that day. I never asked to be a demon. It just sort of... happened.”
Um ba ba be
They had next to nothing. Hardly any knowledge about how to open rifts. They knew even less about finding the right world without previous knowledge about where Dean may have landed. They had no archangel grace. No son of Lucifer. They had nothing more than a Dream Walker, a witch, and a weakened seraph. It was hopeless, dangerous, and completely impossible. And they we're gonna pull it off. They had to.
"Why?" Crowley scoffed. "There's nothing there for me anymore. Why do you insist on saving the world when all it has done, is spit in your face for trying?"
“No.” Crowley replied. “That was Led Zeppelin. But I told you, it has been in the car for more than a fortnight. So, it's Queen now.” He stated, matter of factly, like it made perfect sense and Dean was just being an idiot for not understanding.
"Because, it's literally the only thing we have left."
"That's why I came to you." Cas said firmly. "You were good once Crowley. You helped us trap Lucifer."
"You can keep your bloody shop!" Crowley groaned. "I know how much those silly books mean to you…"
"Thank you, sir." Dean said, choking up.
"She's not like them." Cas insisted. "Not anymore. She's good. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have made it this long. She saved me. She's..."
"Yeah." Sam scoffed, eyes still fixed on the hall.
Sam gazed at the angel in awe, earning him a soft smile in return. "It is true that your brother may have embellished stories about you." Aziraphale nodded. "Meeting you in person, I can see where he exaggerated about you. I do not see before me, the man that was described. What I do see, however, is not a monster, but a man who is very scared, and with every right to be so. I can not begin to imagine the horrors you boys have seen in your lifetime. It must all be very frightening, but I also believe it has made you strong. What I see before me, is a man who has the opportunity to take that strength, that knowledge based on years of sheer horror, to go out there and share that wisdom with people who need it to fight off the actual monsters that are plaguing their existence." The angel pulled on the bottom of his coat and straighten up, making his way to the door before pausing with his hand on the knob. "If you don't feel that you can lead them that's fine. You don't have to, but if you want to avoid becoming the monster you fear that you are, the least you can do is help them lead themselves, rather than damning them to die on their own."
"Wow, those are loud!" Came a familiar voice that had Dean's blood freeze and his heart stop. "So, much for a surprise entrance." With a single snap, the lights were back on and Dean lost every last shred of hope he had been holding onto as soon as they illuminated the scene before them. "Hey guys! What's new?"
Dean took a few more deep breaths before replying to his confused friend. "Dude, no. I mean say that to her. That was beautiful. Anyone would fall for that."
“How could you do that to us ?!” He raked his hands through his hair while he walked, unable to look his friend in the face. They could lose him. At any point in time, Cas could just be gone. For good. Especially now. Jack was gone, and there was no way God was gonna bring him back again. He'd be “dead” dead. It was hard enough the last few times, when they at least knew the reasons why and after the last time, he was pretty sure Dean wouldn't make it.... but Dean was gone. Jack was gone. The world was over. And Sam might have to face it alone. He stopped, his back to the table, his head sunk to his chest. “How could you just leave us like that?” He choked out.
"Awe!" Sam said mockingly  "how sweet. You got him a stuffed animal!"
“What?” Crowley replied innocently.
He failed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Marie stopped what she was doing and pulled down her collar a bit to reveal the one below her clavicle before picking up the trays. "We all got one our senior year." She stated walking with the trays and giving two each to Maeve and Dean before picking up two of her own and shuffling the back into the foyer. "It was kind of a 'better safe than sorry' situation after we met you. Don't worry. None of us went off to become hunters or anything. It's just kinda hard to ignore what's out there once you know. We all take precautions."
Aziraphale leaned back to stare at Crowley's face, once again seeing nothing but utter sincerity in his words. "You would really be willing to die fighting the Almighty, himself, just to save me?" Though Crowley had already said as much, several times, it never seemed to amaze Aziraphale. In all of their centuries together, he had never known just how much Crowley did, indeed, care for him. He knew it was something more than he should, they were hereditary enemies, after all, but he never imagined it was quite as much as this. He couldn't get enough of it.
"Are you sure?" Sam asked her. " Are you absolutely sure that it will be enough?"
“He'll eat what I bring him.” Crowley said as he walked out the door. Seconds later, they heard the Bentley roar down the street.
"Unsavory things?" Aziraphale asked from behind him.
Dean swallowed as he looked between us brother and best friend. They looked exhausted. He was sure Sam probably hadn't eaten or slept well since he left and Cas had used enough of his power to shatter every light on that whole floor of the bunker, so there was no doubt in Dean's mind he could use a bit of R&R as well. "Look, I appreciate you guys staying behind to help and everything and I'm sure you want to get this done and over with, but I mean I just got home. It's getting late and some of us kinda require food and sleep to operate at our best, ya know? You think it would be okay if we started tomorrow? We ain't gonna be any good if half our team's running on fumes."
"Sorry." Dean laughed turning his gaze to the angel. Cas was not amused.
"Oh." Crowley sighed. "Aziraphale will be terribly disappointed then. He loves monster novels. Though, I suppose it shouldn't matter. We don't have such creatures on our world." He glanced over at Cas and received a cocky sneer in return. "Gloat all you want, Castiel, I still know more about humans than you."
It was all his fault, as usual. He should've thought before he acted. He should've at least tried to talk to Cas before things got out of hand. They probably wouldn't have been in this mess if he had just tried to hear his friend out before letting his emotions get the best of him. Some friend he was. Cas had made some serious mistakes over the years, sure, but no more than Dean or Sam had. Cas's mistakes just seemed bigger because they were on a more cosmic scale, but he was a cosmic being so that wasn't really his fault. It usually boiled down to him trying to protect humanity, or not feeling appreciated. He should've let Cas know how much he meant to them more, how much he meant to Dean. Maybe if he had made more of an effort to let Cas know he was important, to let him know he was more than another tool in their arsenal...maybe if he just told Cas...
Cas obtains a copy of "Supernatural: The Musical" and guilt trips Sam and Dean into watching it with him.

Dean confesses his love for Castiel and Cas tells Dean about his deal....
"…how…" Dean gasped, setting his beer down and slowly rising to his feet. "Cas, I…I watched you…how are you…"
“Why?” Dean asked.
"Well, okay," Dean said hesitantly as he looked at Jack "but don't expect to be going around here calling me 'dad' or whatever."
Cas bowed his head and held out his hand "Pleased to meet you."
"Thank you, but really the pleasure is all mine." Cas laughed. Then he turned to Dean with a wicked smile and wide eyes. "How come we don't have cute pet names for each other, Dean?"
"I doubt that." Crowley laughed. " I think he was more concerned about how my death would affect Dean. I doubt he would've stepped in had you not told him about the effects of holy water on the demons from our world. I feel like he may have enjoyed watching me writhe in pain, if it weren't for the sake of Dean's concern."
"Yeah," Sam said, still completely bemused, "I guess…Dean hasn't really talked a lot about what happened while he was there. He told me some things, but he never really went into detail."
"Crowley..." The angel began, but Sam cut him off
"Aye. I've only been doing this for a little over three centuries, but I believe I may have picked up a thing or two about concussions in that time."
And that would've been encouraging. It would've been the point where he smiled and pulled her into a hug and thanked her again before he went off to wait for the other hunters to arrive so he could reorganize them before he found Aziraphale to get some work done on their plan. It would have been...if he didn't hear Cas's voice echoing through the halls.
“You know, I've always kinda wondered...” Dean said from the back seat. “Who are Moey and Chandon anyway?”
"You can say that." Cas deadpanned with a slight head bop.
Those nightmares I've been having? They haven't been about Michael. They.... they're about you Cas."
Cas let his head fall back and let out a humorless laugh.” To put it mildly..... we're fucked.”
"That's all I'm asking." Sam said, patting Garth on the back as he moved on to give the rest of the hunters their assignments.
Cas's eyes lit up as he flipped around. He was across the library, in front of the witch, in the blink of an eye, staring her down with all of his holy wrath. “I said,” He ground out between his teeth, “Bring. Him. Back!”
The cheers produced the thunder of hope Sam had been missing since he watched Jack die. Most of them weren't making it out of this alive, if any, but none of them were going down without a fight. "Find a room, get some rest. Tomorrow, we fight back!" Sam jumped down from the table, feeling better than he had in years as he walked through the crowd, receiving a few back slaps and high fives. He stopped in front of Aziraphale, who had remained, unmoved, in his spot with an odd smile on his face. "What?" Sam asked.
“Aye.” Rowena replied. “And perhaps try to be a little more sensitive to his feelings this time.'
The scene inside of the large casino wasn't much better to be honest. There were bodies slumped over slot machines, strewn across poker tables in pieces, even a head, rotating through a perpetual game of roulette. As they made their way through the carnage, towards the large neon sign blinking "Keno Lounge" Dean noticed that a few of the bodies had black, bulging veins, peaking out under their collars. They were definitely in the right place. He tightened his grip on the angel's sleeve, as Cas pushed the door to the lounge open, placing himself protectively in front of Dean. His other hand slipped up to the strap of his back pack on his shoulder (feeling a little like a small child, nervous for their first day of school) as he desperately tried to ground himself. It did nothing to quell the wave of emotions that crashed over him the moment he spotted her.
That's what he got for trusting the Apocashit World hunters to look for cases. Sure, they seemed to be coming into their own as hunters, but they didn't seem to be able to tell the difference between a demon and a demigod when it came to case searching. They made it seem like the whole state of Michigan was in danger, not just one tiny suburb in, yet another, cookie-cutter town. He had taken Sam and Cas for back up, but they all agreed it was best for Jack to stay with Mary if the case proved to much for him to handle. None of them were willing to put their psuedoson in harm's way in his weakened state. But a salt and burn....Jack could handle that in his sleep.
Great. Guilt. He wasn't wrong. Dean knew Metatron had downloaded just about every book, movie and TV show that was worth it's spit into Cas's brain a few years ago, but that didn't stop him from jamming every piece of pop culture knowledge he had at his disposal down the angel's throat. He wanted Cas to have the experience, not just the knowledge. And he always took it in stride. Now, here he was, asking Dean to do the same, just once...." UGH! Fine, Cas! We'll watch the stupid play!"

"Yeah, well it did!" Sam sighed, running his hands through his hair. " Look, I don't know what you said to him, but whatever it was.... Cas has another deal. With the Empty."
*original title chapter*
"You don't know that, Dean." Crowley said. " Haven't you ever considered..."
They talked about everything they had hidden from each other over the years, every secret, every lie. They talked as they watched the galaxies swirl above them, getting out everything they had held back. Eventually they got back inside the car and made their way back to the Roadhouse, to be greeted by everyone the had lost along the way. Pam and Ellen were serving up shots, while Jo brought them burgers as they sat down at the bar. Charlie and Kevin were scrunched up with Ash in front of his laptop as he explained how he managed to hack into angel radio. Rufus and Bobby were bickering in the corner while Missouri sat and laughed at them from the booth she was sharing with Adam. Everyone was there, everyone was happy.
"Watch it, asshole!" She screeched, wiping her hands on her jeans before trying to stand back up. "What, treating your friends like dog shit not enough for you? Decided to move on the beating up girls half your size?"
"He was a demon. A 'monster' at its core definition. His job was to create chaos, make trouble. He was to corrupt human souls and bind them forever, in Hell's name. And that's what he did. He tempted Eve to eat the fruit, forever damming every human who disobeyed the word of the Almighty to suffer forever in Hell." Aziraphale paused, a small smile graced his features as he pulled from the memories from centuries ago. "Our very first conversation was on the walls of Eden, as we watched Adam and Eve venture off into the wilderness. It was raining. The first rain actually. I remember him saying to me how he felt like it was an overreaction, tossing them out for one simple sin. I ignored it, of course. God said they must be punished for their sins, so it must have been justified. He laughed at the fact that I had given them my sword for protection. It was a minor thing, I thought. That was my job after all. He said how he thought it would be funny to find out that he did the right thing, by teaching them about good and Evil and I did the wrong thing by giving them my sword. That had to be impossible, I thought. He was a demon, and I was an angel. Our natures would prevent us from doing the opposite of our purposes. Let me tell you, it wasn't funny at all when we discovered how right that statement really was." His smile faded slightly before he continued. "Still, he amused me, so we kept in contact. Showing up to various major events here and there, exchanging our opinions based on our different sides of the coin. He stayed on Earth as well, preferring the company of humans over demons, not that I could blame him. He'd cause a battle here, a plague there, but over time his efforts became less and less nefarious. He'd stand out of the way, more often than not, and I found myself letting him cause his minor bits of chaos, which dissolved into little more than pranks really, without interfering."
“Satan help me.” Crowley sighed. “No! For the love of... it's two weeks’ time!” He swerved past a milk truck, narrowly missing an old woman crossing the street.
"You gave us a choice." Came another voice. "You promised is free will and all it did was destroy us!"
"He simply asked the wrong questions I suppose, at least ones that the Almighty wasn't to keen on answering. Knowing what we do now, I can understand why. He mostly just wanted to know why. Why the pain, why the suffering, why the secrets about good and evil? I personally never saw the problem with his curiosity, they seemed like legitimate questions, as far as I was concerned, but I figured that if the Almighty deemed it necessary to have those things, then that was just...how it was. I never questioned it. It's the only reason there's any difference between our species." He paused, looking Cas up and down before speaking again in a cautious tone. " You two have quite a bit in common in that sense, from what I've heard."
But you don't know what to do
After a while, he found himself longing for times he would never have. Times when he could ride along with someone who would listen to his hair-brained theories and indulge his whimsies. Someone who would go along with every crazy scheme that popped into his head without question or complaint, no matter the risks.
“That can still happen...”
"You realize theses are stories about your brother and your best friend... together?" He spat
