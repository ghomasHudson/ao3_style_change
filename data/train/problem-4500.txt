Sam sat on the edge of the couch, curious about what creature brought his his brother back, but he was also ready to figure out how to kill it.
Dean spared a quick glance at the newspaper stand, checking the date, wondering how long he’s been gone. September 18. Dean had been in Hell for 4 months. Two weeks under 5. Dean swallowed, Sam had been alone for almost 5 months. Hopefully, he hadn’t done anything stupid.
Ruby smirked in response to Dean's mutter, looking self-satisfied at the half confession of a job well done. Dean couldn't help but roll his eyes in response to Ruby's smirk.
A part of Dean felt sad for missing so much and causing them so much pain, another just felt happy that he was back and that he could spend time with them again.
A hand fell on Dean’s shoulder and he grabbed the wrist before he whipped around to face the assailant, raising his fist in preparation to strike his attacker but relaxed when he saw the head of shaggy brown hair belonging to his brother.
No one flinched or jumped when Castiel appeared in the living room with them.
Dean quickly shrugged. “Dunno. Might've to ask Cas if he knows anything.” Dean commented, but mulled it over in his own head. Lilith
Sam took a small step forward. “No, Dean’s right.” He declared. Both Castiel and Dean looked at him. “If we find out what the seal is before all others are broken, then we can protect it while we find a way to reverse the seals. If we protect the last seal or make it unusable, then we have a chance of stopping it.” Sam started to smile, the type of smile he got when he was excited about a case or he realized something smart.
Dean rounded the corner and immediately saw the motel Sam was living in. It was a little fancier than their normal rooms, but still nowhere near 5 stars. The second thing Dean saw, was the Impala. He felt giddy at the sight of the chrome and black paint. 40 years had passed since he saw the car, along with a couple of billions years worth of memories.
Castiel gave him a look that said he was stupid. “We have you. You’re an archangel.”
Dean quickly huffed as he realized it was a dream. "I'm dreaming, aren't I?" He asked, acting like the clueless human Dean Winchester.
“I find that very reassuring.” Dean sarcastically commented in a gruff voice, crossing his arms over his chest.
“To be honest,” Sam’s voice broke through her thoughts. “I don’t think Dean really likes him. That it’s some kind of… Stockholm Syndrome or hero worship. It’s not love that’s keeping them together.”
“Okay.” Anna whispered and looked up at Dean with wide eyes at their closeness and took a deep breath of Dean's gunpowder and cherry smell. “What about you?” She asked, looking at his split lip and bruised and bloodied cheekbone.
call her that? When it’s the truth?” Dean huffed an angry breath. “Sam, she’s not working
“So you’re gonna smite the whole friggin’ town?” Sam asked once he saw that Dean wasn’t going to answer.
Bobby gasped when the angel disappeared, staring at the unvacated place the angel had stood in. His eyes quickly shifted to Dean’s and clearly spelled out ‘
Lilith, she’s working
“Dean? Are you okay?” Sam asked and stepped out of the bedroom. Dean didn’t answer, but blinked drowsily. “Dean?” He questioned and laid his hand on the older Winchester’s shoulder.
Later, as the night spread darkness over the sky, Sam, Ruby and Anna had set up camp in a barn not very far from the field.
“But now they want to kill you?” Sam questioned with furrowed brows, looking back at his brother in question, hoping Dean could provide some answers on why his boyfriend wanted to kill Anna.
Sam’s eyes widened at the revelation. “That’s it?” He questioned. “How can you have faith in him of you haven’t seen him?”
“I was trying to warn them.” Anna explained, her voice humb, almost dead.
Sam frowned and laid his hand on her shoulder as he said, “Don’t talk like that.”
Castiel hummed in agreement before he nuzzled his nose into Dean’s light brown hair. “Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul? Or grace?” He asked and waited until Dean nodded. “I’m not as good of a soldier as I once was. I have questions, I have doubts. I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore, whether I’ve passed or failed here.” Castiel admitted.
Uriel looked at him with a raised eyebrow. “Says who?” He questioned.
"Ruby's in trouble and Uriel has Anna's grace." Dean answered as he got out of the bed and pulled on his clothes while still holding the phone to his ear.
“No. You can’t do this, you’re angels, I mean aren’t you supposed to -- aren’t you supposed to show mercy?” He questioned. This wasn’t how he imagined angels like, they were supposed to be kind, gentle, not believing in the needs of the many outweighs the need of a few.
“Here for her like…
“Why?” Sam asked. “Who is she?”
Castiel wrapped his arms around the green-eyed man and rolled them over so Dean was straddling his hips and Castiel was laying back on the mattress with his head cushioned on the fluffy pillows.
“For what?” Dean questioned with a huff. “For making assumptions? For lying to me and still drinking demon blood? For telling me that you liked having me be tortured over and over without any pause and you would like me to continue being tortured?” He listed, voice natural with only the barest hint of emotion; hurt and betrayal. “Which one, Sam?”
Dean frowned and looked into the man’s eyes which flashed blue for a second and Dean’s brain came to the realization. “Balthy?!” Dean squeaked.
? How about this? Why don't you start with why you’re hanging out with a demon, with
Anna slowly nodded as she thought of the information. “My grace. Where it hit, it could have done something like that. Easy.” She explained.
“Zachariah has been a pain in the ass.” Ariel commented with a huff, causing Dean to chuckle.
“Yes. Hell is where you live through your worst nightmares becoming reality and pain worse than what anyone could imagine, each and every day until you pick up the knife yourself and your time is split between more torture on the rack and torturing souls yourself, putting them through the pain you just experienced yourself.” He spoke in a quiet and dark voice, almost emotionless, before he walked the last bit of the hall that separates him from Sam.
Dean snorted in anger before he responded. “Well, believe it or not, I do have a life outside of you! Despite what you might think, my entire world doesn't revolve around you!” Dean responded loudly, knowing that they would have noise complaints later. The emotions were building up within his chest, feeling like it was going to burst, but Dean kept the emotions on a firm leach.
“It means she's worse than this abomination you've been screwing.” Uriel hissed and gestured to Ruby, who glared at him in response. “Now give us the girl.” He growled.
Anna followed the brothers and stood shyly behind them, watching their interactions with wide eyes.
“Hiya!” She greeted cheerfully. “What can I get ya, honey?” She asked in a Minnesotan accent. Dean immediately noticed how she eyed him like a piece of sweets.
“Right.” Sam huffed. He looked down at the notepad he usually carried before looking back up at the psychiatrist. “Uh, you mentioned Anna's illness was recent.”
Dean, however, ignored the soft tone and crossed his arms over his chest. “Well, that's pretty convenient. Showing up right when we find the girl with some bigwig on your tail?” He said with a raised eyebrow. Anna watched the interactions from where she was standing next to Sam’s much taller body.
Anna sighed and ignored the brothers’ disbelief. “So… Castiel, Uriel -- they’re the ones that came for me?” She asked, looking between Sam and Dean in question.
Dean commented.
Sam nodded, almost eagerly. “Of course I'm okay with it, why wouldn't I? I don't care if you're gay, bi, pan, demi, a, or gray, you're still my brother.” Sam happily said.
“So you lost the magic knife, huh?” Dean questioned and stood up, albeit on shaky legs.
"Leave." Castiel simply commanded. When Uriel hesitated, Castiel glared at him in a way Dean had dubbed
Marilyn= Marilyn Monroe, an American actress and sex symbol in the 1950s
The psychiatrist sighed sadly. “Well, that's the tragedy of schizophrenia. Within weeks, Anna was overtaken by delusions.”
“Dean…” Sam breathed with a small waver of fear. “What the Hell was that?”
Dean smiled weakly and clapped Sam on the shoulder. “Thank you.” He said with a smile before looking to Castiel. “And thanks to you too, you idiot.” Dean slapped his hands down on his thighs and stood, smiling between Sam and Castiel, though it was strained, forced. “Now, how about we hunt down some evil sons of bitches?”
watching her.” She replied and turned her eyes back to Anna.
Dean studied the psychic and red-haired woman, his eyes flicking back and forth between them. Maybe he and Sam could do the same hypnosis sometime, find out each other’s secrets? Though that would mean Dean probably would reveal that he was an angel. Som maybe not such a good idea after all.
Also, I'm planning a spin-off of this, but with Dean's life as Jensen, like pre-series, about his life with the other archangels, Amara and Chuck, Castiel, Balthazar and Ariel. I have
“‘Did to others’?” Sam questioned.
Dean glared at the closed door before his eyes widened as he remembered the state of the room. “Not now!” He called back, trying to keep the panic out of his voice.
Sam looked up when he heard Anna’s soft footsteps coming towards him. “Hey. Holding up okay?” He asked the angel in greeting.
Alastair became aware of blades clashing from somewhere up in the green thundering skies. Bright lights swirled around along with black smoke of demons. Alastair squinted, trying to see what the bright lights were and caught sight of feathery wings. Angels. They were invading Hell, searching for Dean, to try and get him out of there.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Goodnight, son.” Bobby whispered into the air, hoping it somehow reached Dean in whatever consciousness he was in.
Anna quickly nodded. “The older I got, the longer I was human, yeah.”
Dean thought. “But, I know it's not just because of the angel radio thing. And the blood spell, man, that's some serious crap.” Dean tiredly said. He was so tired of lying, but knew it was safer if less people knew of his true identity.
“Here.” Sam finally said just after the clock had struck midnight. Ruby rose from her seat and looked at the magazine Sam held up. “In March ‘85, a meteorite vanished in the night sky over northwestern Ohio. It was sighted 9 months before Anna was born and she was from that part of Ohio.”
“I don’t know!” Sam screamed, fear and worry for his brother seizing his heart. “I don’t know, but we gotta think of something!”
When Sam was about to open the door to the warehouse with the formerly possessed man leaning against him, when Dean yanked it open. He glared at Sam, a furious glimt in his eyes. “Anything you wanna tell me, Sam?” Dean asked in a growling voice.
Also, I'm in a bad case of depression right now, so updates might be slow. Just giving you a heads-up.
“Well, hate to burst your bubble, but I already ate. Did it before I came here. So why don’t you go ahead? I’ll stay here and catch up on some sleep.” Dean suggested with a small smirk.
Dean angrily glared at the angel. "Why don't you give her the juice back? She could use it to protect herself from demons!" Dean spoke, feeling a strong distaste of protecting his friends' murderer.
Alright, I really hate the ending. But I needed it for the coming chapters and I wanted to explain why Anna's bad in my story.
“There’s a gas station down the road. The humans abandoned it earlier when we evacuated them.” Castiel explained. “We wanted to be sure no humans were harmed when we got you out of Hell.”
Uriel scowled, "Then you know why she's not getting her grace back."
“Cas does what Heaven asks of him, because if an angel disobeys an order, then they're reprogrammed with brutal torture and some truly horrible methods until they're good and pliant. Though Cas has drawn the line where he hurts innocent humans.” Dean explained as he thought of the horrible things Naomi had done to several angels.
Anna offered a small shrug as she answered, “Trying.”
Straightening up, Dean felt his senses sharpen. Far sharper than normal, he could feel the wing beats of a bird closeby vibrate through the air. “Woah.” Dean whispered. He turned to look at Castiel with a raised eyebrow.
Anna looked to Sam who was staring out of the window to see if they were followed. “Hey, Sam.” She called, causing the tall hunter to look up at her. “Do you think it's safe to make a quick call, just to tell my parents I'm okay? They must be completely freaked.” She said worriedly and fidgeted with her hands.
with your mind? Or were you planning on keeping me in the dark, going behind my back and replacing me with that black-eyed, hellhound bitch?” Dean asked and gestured to Ruby.
Sam placed Dean onto the bed and stepped back when Dean sank into the mattress. His hands were shaking with fear, but he ignored it and got a towel from the bathroom, purposely not looking at the shards of mirror glass, and used it to wipe the blood from Dean's nose.
Dean laid a sympathetic hand on Sam's shoulder. “You couldn't have known, Sammy.”
“Did you find something?” Anna asked, steering the conversation away from her past to instead focus on her future, on what came next.
“Fuck!” Sam cursed, Dean words and accusations hitting him like knives to his heart. “All of them!” He yelled, feeling tears trickle down his cheeks. “I'm sorry for everything! For doubting you, lying and… for what I said. I was angry and I didn't think and- and-” Sam stuttered, looking for words he couldn't find, emotions getting the upper hand again, this time guilt and shame.
“Hi, what can I get ya?” The young bartender asked, eyes sizing him up. In case of a bar fight most people didn’t want to mess with the uncontrolled force that is Dean Winchester.
Queen's Tavern is a fictional bar I made up. It's named after 2 things: Oliver Queen and the band Queen (which I've become obsessed with since I watched Bohemian Rhapsody for the first the time)
All the angels, the reaper and Dean were spread out in the living room on various pieces of furniture; Samandriel was in a bean bag, Ariel was sitting on the armrest of the armchair Balthazar was in, Tessa in another armchair and Dean was alone on the couch, curled up with his legs tucked underneath him.
“For what?” Sam questioned and raised an eyebrow.
Castiel -- noticing that Dean was having a panic attack and having dealt with several attacks before during their time together -- immediately took charge of the situation. “Jay, love, remember when we first met? It was in 1483, 900 years after Gabriel died. You weren’t working as you were depressed and spent most of your time in Heaven’s gardens, taking care of the plants and planting new ones.
Sam shrugged. “It could be a coincidence.”
Castiel sent Dean’s way.
Castiel smiled at Sam after Dean’s introduction of them both. Seeing the smile that was so very familiar to Balthazar, Dean mentally sighed.
Alastair stopped moving and stood in front of her with his hands in his jeans pockets. He smirked and tilted his head to the side as he studied her tense form. "I have to say I'm surprised to find you out in the open like this, Especially considering the orders you've been given." He spoke in a dark voice, glaring at her.
The african american angel raised his eyebrow at Dean’s growl. “You think you can stop us?” He questioned, something aking smugness in his voice.
“You scared me.” Sam's voice broke the silence and Dean's concentration. Dean opened his eyes and turned around to look at the younger. He felt his heart ache when he saw Sam's red rimmed eyes and puffy cheeks. “I thought it was a dream, that you came back.”
“Sam didn't want to give you a hunter's funeral.” Castiel interrupted Dean's thoughts. “He wanted you to have a body once you got back. So, he convinced Bobby Singer to simply bury you and then he set out to search for a way to bring you back.”
The hunter and the ex-angel entered Bobby’s house again where Ruby was reading through and double-checking the facts that Sam found.
Uriel's gaze on Dean sharpened before he looked at his superior. "Why are you here?" He harshly asked the blue-eyed angel.
Castiel rolled his eyes; even after 30 years of humanity, he still made lame jokes. He sighed and looked at the green-eyed man. He looked past the body and instead at the soul inside. It was bright, brighter than most humans’, bright like the righteous man. Though, Castiel saw how the soul lazily formed itself into a twisted version of the archangel’s true form before resetting itself into its normal shape.
Dean glared at her, considering their chances with the equation of Ruby working with Lilith; how probably was it for an ambush and/or was it a trap.
Dean quickly realized that Samandriel mistook his shock as threatening and smiled at the young angel. “It’s fine. Sam, I understand what you meant, you just caught me off guard.” The ex-archangel swung his legs onto the floor and sat properly on the couch. “I... don’t know what to do with my grace. It’d give an advantage in the fight, but it’d be a disadvantage as the Host
Castiel stepped in before either Sam or Uriel started swinging. “We have no choice.” He apologized.
“It’s pure creation.” Anna finished for him, with a slight awe in her voice.
Ruby pouted playfully and held up a flask. “So you don’t want this then?”
“What are we even looking for?” Ruby questioned in a harsh voice as she glared at the red-head.
Uriel glared at him with a dark look. “Tell me something, Dean, when your father gave you an order, did you obey?” Uriel asked, a smile tugging at his lips.
Dean glared at the younger Winchester with burning eyes. “Yeah, don't be so sure.” He growled.
“Enough!” Castiel growled like the commander he was and Uriel obeyed. He looked at the two hunters with a stern look. “I suggest you move quickly.” He ordered.
Dean felt the breath leave him as he realized why they were there. He knew exactly what Uriel specialized in.
"Samandriel. A young, and trustful, angel in Cas' garrison." Dean explained as he brushed past the younger hunter. Anna came to the doorway of the barn and stood there as she stared at Dean. Dean looked at Anna with a raised eyebrow, wordlessly calling for a truce.
“Cas, stop… please.” Sam begged, using the angel's nickname for the first time as his brother's boyfriend/partner threateningly made his way over to Sam.
“What's that supposed to mean?” Sam asked with a raised eyebrow.
“It’s okay. She’s here to help.” Sam reassured the red-head.
Alastair leaned forward to kiss him, but never had the chance when one of the angels descended and landed just a few feet away from the demon and his student. The angel was a huge ball of light, but shrunk down to Alastair and Dean’s height to accommodate the demon and it’s apprentice. Alastair growled at the angel, forcefully taking the knife Dean still held in his hand.
Sam ignored the volume of his voice as he protested, “Then you’re a revenant!”
6 hours later, Sam, Dean and Anna arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, without Ruby who had stayed behind to throw the demons off of their trail. Dean smiled at the woman standing on the steps leading to her house as he got out of the Impala.
“How's she gonna do that?” Dean asked with a wrinkled nose before pausing. “Different question; why do you trust her so much? I mean, even if you didn't know of her deceit, she's a demon.”
Sam groaned and pressed his hands into his eyes, rubbing them harshly. “Now that’s seared into my brain.” He complained and Dean nodded in agreement.
’. Dean followed Sam as the two made their ways out of the hospital and to the Impala where they set course towards the Milton residence.
The angel raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Castiel? Oh, he, uh... he's not here." He said and traced his fingers over a dusty table, frowning at the dust gathered on his fingers. "See, he had this weakness. He likes you."
Missouri tore her eyes away from Anna and instead looked at the young Winchester. “Sam, don’t.” She ordered with a glare.
Sam smiled sadly. “I thought it was my car. Besides, you once said you’d come back to haunt me if I did anything to the Impala.”
Castiel slowly nodded. “It was broadcasted for everyone, but was meant for Anna, who’d rely it to Sam.” He explained before he closed his eyes and spoke, Sam Winchester, give us Anna by midnight, or… or we hurl Dean back to damnation.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, hey?” Dean said as he entered.
I wrote a lot of this chapter while severely sleep deprived and therefore some parts might be weird.
“Dick.” Castiel smirked widely.
Anna nodded in agreement and smiled tentatively. Her realization of Dean's true identity made her nervous, wary of the archangel who was in the same boat as her.
Dean sighed and shivered as he continued to trace the brand.
Both Winchesters straightened their suits once they got out of the car and walked up to the front door in unison. Dean knocked on the door before he stepped back and waited. When nobody came after a minute, Dean frowned and looked at Sam. “Maybe they’re not home?” Dean suggested, but Sam quickly shook his head.
“What do you think, Anna?” Ruby asked the red-head, who looked to be deep in thought.
Dean froze and quickly folded his arms over his chest. “Yeah.” Dean muttered in answer. “He was the master torturer in Hell. Probably why Ruby also knew him.” Dean added, voice shaky with fear. He quickly sobered, though, and stood straighter. “We got to find Anna.”
41 years had passed since Dean first went to Hell. 12 had passed since Dean got off the rack and started torturing himself. In the beginning, Dean had felt guilty, but after all that time, he didn't feel anything.
“It’s too late. He’s here.” Ruby stated, a edge of fear in her voice that was so unusual that it made Dean look at her with something else than just hatred in his eyes.
In the end, Dean decided to take the inebriated angel to the closest hotel, a lot more upscale than Sam and Dean’s usual places. With Castiel’s arm around his neck and the angel pressed up tightly next to him, he booked a room with a king sized bed for 2 nights, as Castiel would probably have an epic hangover the next day. Paying would have been tricky if it wasn’t for the fact that Dean had swiped a credit card from some rich college kid, who probably wouldn't tell his parents he lost his credit card.
Castiel shrugged. “Then we find it.” Castiel sounded so sure, like he had back-up plans on top of the back-up plans. But of course he did, he was a soldier of Heaven. And like a boyscout, he was always ready.
“You know, you’re a shitty angel of family.” Castiel’s voice sounded from the doorway, making Dean jump in surprise, causing Dean to spill his drink. The angel chuckled at the reaction. “And one would think you’d notice I was here. After all, we have a ‘connection’.” He teased, doing exaggerated air quotes.
Dean smiled softly in response. “Call me Dean. Sam doesn’t know yet.” He answered in a whisper. Of course Missouri would know, she could read his mind and his aura -- both of which had changed when he got his memories back.
Bobby scoffed. “You sent me a text about there being a hunt you needed my help on.” Bobby paused and frowned. “Please don’t tell me I’ve been on the road for 8 hours, just to find out you didn’t really need any help.”
Dean smiled; at least this was familiar. Shaking off the nostalgia, Dean went down the hallways, searching for room 207. 205, 206 and at the end of the third hallway, room 207.
” Dean yelled at Ruby.
“Why?” Sam asked, blissfully unaware of the situation at hand.
Dean felt Sam look at him with a worried glance, but Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from the two angels.
A blush quickly spread over Dean’s cheeks as the other angels and the reaper burst into laughter. “Cas!” Dean whined as his cheeks grew a bright red. He buried his face in Castiel’s neck to escape his embarrassment.
As Dean moved to stand, he was pulled down onto the bed with a yelp as Castiel dragged him down. The angel wrapped his arms around him and pressed kisses into his neck.
Sam looked at his brother with wide eyes and his mouth open in shock. “What?!” He furiously questioned. “How can you say that? They’ll kill her!”
Anna released a soft huff. “Orders are orders. If the Host of Heaven orders something you follow them. I’m sure I have a death sentence on my head.” Anna replied, following Sam’s gaze to the tired looking green-eyed Winchester.
Dean jerked the Impala off of the road and onto the shoulder beside the road, throwing the door open and stumbling outside until he collapsed on his knees on the grass beside the road. He drew in a big shuddering breath before his stomach lurched and did it’s best to dispel the burger and pie he had eaten earlier. It didn’t taste as good that time than it did when he first ate it. His body heaved until only bile burned as it crawled up his throat and he spat at the acidic taste.
“Our orders were not to stop the summoning of Samhain, they were to do whatever you told us to do.” Castiel explained as he brushed his fingers through Dean’s hair as they laid in a hotel bed back in Sioux Falls once the hunt was over.
Dean's stomach clenched when he thought about how Sam, having seen his brother be ripped apart in front of him, also had to clean his brother up and dress him in new clothes.
“All of you?” Sam questioned with furrowed eyebrows. Surely they had all seen their father’s face.
Dean raised his head and looked into Castiel’s blue eyes. “How long have you felt like this?” He asked, his normally playful tone serious and concerned.
"Orders are orders. I know. Just make it quick." She spoke and held her arms out for them to attack her.
Dean smiled and clapped Sam on the shoulder before looking back to Castiel. The angel looked between them with an emotionless face before he sighed heavily. “It’s a stupid plan. With too many risks. But I’ll accept it. I’ll inform the others.”
And Dean’s brain was jumbled, new and old memories mixed together, causing his head to hurt as he read the words in English, the older memories being used to Enochian.
In the next chapter we'll meet Ariel and Balthazar!
Sobering up from his shock, he teased. “Hi again, Cas.” Dean smiled. “Good to see that you're not walking around naked anymore.”
The young angel quickly went rigid in his bean bag. “I-I didn’t mean it like... of course you’re as good as a human, I just meant-” He stuttered.
Sam avoided looking into Dean’s eyes as he put the flask away again. The demon entered the attic and Sam immediately put his arm up and tried to exorcise him, but it didn’t work, the demon didn't even move.
“Something
Dean smiled kindly at her, a normal smile as he didn't have the relationship status nor was he in the mood to flirt. “Hi,” He greeted. “I’ll have a bacon cheeseburger and a coffee, please.” Dean requested.
Samandriel read the address and quickly flew there, appearing in front of Sam, who jumped at their sudden appearance. "Thanks Sam." Dean told the young angel before he left.
Anna nodded in confirmation while Sam looked confused. “Wait a minute, there’s something I don’t understand… angels can just become humans?” He questioned.
The end is messy and I blame sleep depriviton and 8 anxiety attacks. I will go back later and edit and fix it up. In the meantime, constructive criticism is appreaciated.
Sam’s eyes traveled back up to his brother’s face when he remembered the hand-shaped brand on his left arm. “Hey, Dean.” Sam called as he sat down on the couch and Dean took a seat on the bed.
“I don’t know. I just did.” Anna answered in a dead voice.
Sam sighed. “I can’t do this right now. Something else came up.” Sam apologized, trying to keep the information as vague as possible. Ruby was still a demon, connected to Hell.
By ‘informing the others’, Castiel had meant informing Balthazar, Ariel, Tessa and Samandriel. Castiel didn’t fully trust his garrison, especially after Hell. It was supposed to be a surprise attack, but someone must have told the demons they were coming.
“Housekeeping!” A female voice called from the other side of the front door.
“And I’ve cut all contact with Ruby. I just use her as an informant and sometimes she gives me cases.”
"It's the only way the two of us could chat..." Uriel huffed angrily. "Since you're hiding like cowards."
"You did the best you could. I forgive you." Anna softly told Sam before she turned to the two angels. "Okay. No more tricks. No more running. I'm ready." She told them and started to make her way towards them.
“Must be nice to be an angel.” Sam mused.
“What?” Dean asked, voice tired and rough. His elbow was resting on his knee, his hand holding his head up. His eyes had slipped shut as he sat down but he was still conscious.
Castiel looked at Dean with a hint of betrayal in his eyes. The archangel-turned-human offered the younger a quick smile.
Castiel exited the house and fluttering wings could be heard seconds later from the dark street outside.
Castiel nodded. “For the 30 years Dean has been alive, he’s had no memories of his previous life as an archangel, nor did he know his own name. It wasn’t until I touched his soul in Hell that he remembered.”
The next morning, Dean awoke slowly and opened his eyes to see Castiel’s blue ones looking at him with a fond look.
I got a request to add fanart to the book (Dean's wings, Castiel in Hell, the engagement ring and a couple of more) and I'd be very glad to do add art except I can't do art to save my own life. So for now, there won't be any art
“Well, except the first and last. The first seal shall be broken ‘when a righteous man sheds blood in Hell’. The last one is still unknown except for a few of the highest ranking demons. I heard some chatter about it while in Hell, but not enough to know what it is. But most seals depend on the breaking of the natural order, so I assume it’s something along those lines.” Dean told them, but avoided to mention that the first seal was already broken.
Panic swelled in Dean's chest, but his face remained relaxed and natural, only a little pinched from the pain of aching muscles. In reality, he didn't have a reason to lie, even when he was just Dean he was smart. “I've always been smart, Sam. Just haven't been showing off like you. So while you were charading around about how smart you were, you missed the fact that I was right there beside you, doing my homework and getting high grades as well, but unlike you I didn't talk about it much.” Dean mumbled, letting a hint of hurt seep into his voice.
Alan= Alan Rickman, a British actor, best known for playing professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter franchise
The door swung open and Dean turned to see a freshly showered and shirtless Sam standing in the doorway, jeans hung low on his hips. His hair was still dripping water.
Sam threw himself to the floor to protect himself from the glass and items flying in the room, but his cheek was caught by a piece of the mirror flying across the room before he could dive out of the way.
“Her face!” Anna screamed in horror, and Dean could only sympathise with her. Ruby really did have a ugly mug in her true form. Burnt, decomposed and rotten flesh, the muscle exposed and a greyish green, black smoke filling the holes in the flesh.
Castiel chuckled lightly. “Well, for starters, you’re complaining about our brothers non-stop, as well as our father. And you’ve expressed several times that you want to kill them. Along with the fact that you never pay them any attention.” Castiel pointed out.
But of course, before he could answer with some bullshit lie, fluttering wings echoed in the room as Castiel appeared. He must have felt the tension between the two brothers because he paused the second he entered.
Dean slowly nodded. “Yeah, I can’t believe it either.”
Dean smiled slightly and looked to Sam with reassuring eyes. “Yeah, I’m fine. Hell and Heaven just overwhelmed me.” Dean said as he looked back to the angel.
“So… you know?” Dean questioned, heating his cheeks heating with a blush.
They landed outside the deserted gas station, looking like so many other Dean had seen on the road. A phone booth stood a couple of feet away, sparking the idea to call his brother and Bobby to let them know he’s alive. A beat-up white pick up stood parked outside and if Dean hadn’t had Castiel there, he would’ve probably hotwired the car and used it to get to Bobby’s.
And trigger warning for graphic(ish) descriptions of violence in the 'Then, now' part.
“We've driven further for less, Dean.” Sam said with a shrug. Dean only shook his head in response. “You got something to say, say it.” The younger demanded.
“Are you gonna help her?” Sam asked, only to receive another glare from Uriel, but only got soft blue eyes from Castiel, though they were sharp like a soldier's, focused and alert.
“Can you hear me?” Missouri asked the quiet and relaxed woman on the bed.
Ruby groaned and glared into Dean’s green eyes. “Because a demon's coming, big-timer. We can fight later, Dean.” Ruby said and for once, her voice seemed almost… soft.
“What case?” Ruby asked with a raised eyebrow.
Castiel nodded. “You might not have faith in our father, but I know you have faith in humanity. And everything that would have been destroyed in that city, they were all our father’s creations. Works of art. And yet, even though Sam stopped Samhain, the seal was broken and we are one step closer to Hell on Earth, for all of creation. And you know just as well as me that it’s no expression, it’s literal.” He reported.
Dean nodded and whispered, "Nanaeel nonci hoath."
Sam’s eyebrows shot up towards his hairline. “So grace ground zero… it’s not destruction, It’s …” He spoke, but trailed off, unsure of how to word it in a good way.
Sam felt himself soften at his brother’s tone. Dean probably wasn’t aware of it, but he sounded like a kid when he was worrying over Sam. “Dean, I promise, I’m not drinking demon blood.”
Also, I haven't written like this in half a year, so... yeah...
The angel stepped forward and was about to touch Dean when Alastair snarled. “You’re not taking Dean. He’s mine!” Alastair snarled and attacked the angel, blade clashing against the angel’s silver one. The angel grabbed Dean’s shoulder and shoved him to the ground to get him away from the demon and angel’s fight.
Dean scoffed with a smile. “If I can last 4 years on the road by myself while you went to nerd school, then I can last until you come back from a diner down the road.”
Sam noticed that she seemed tense and her hands were shaking. “Are you ready to do this?” He asked.
. And I’m not one of them.” She spoke, her voice choked up as if she was about to cry, though her eyes were dry with no trace of tears.
“What’s happening?” Dean asked his brother in a whisper. He looked at the psychic standing by Anna’s side and was preparing what Dean guessed was a seance.
The demon rolled her eyes at Dean’s comment and held out her hand in offering. “Here.” She said and offered the green-eyed man the objects in her hand.
The blue-eyed angel's face was pinched with worry, which quickly smoothed over into relief when his eyes landed on Dean. Dean guessed it was because of the loss of the borrowed grace, causing their bond to be destroyed thus making Castiel unable to know if Dean was alright or not.
Anna, Ruby and Dean froze up when the front door upstairs opened. “Hey, Dean!” Sam’s voice called down to the others and made them relax at knowing it wasn’t a demon or angel.
Dean met Sam's eyes and nodded his head to the deeper parts of the cabin. “Back room.” He commanded the younger.
Alastair smiled and his eyes flashed with anger at the sight of Castiel's protective wings. "Sure. Just give us the girl. We'll make sure she's punished for her crimes, good and proper."
Castiel rolled his eyes. “It was Danielle Imagé, Ariel’s true vessel.” He explained in a light voice.
Anna gave the brother a small nod in response. “Yeah, they talk, and sometimes I just... hear them in my head.”
Later, when Sam and Dean sat in the Impala, Sam was on the phone with the police. “Can I get a copy of the missing persons report? Great. Okay. Thanks.” Sam thanked the person before hanging up and turning his head to look at his brother. “Well, Anna Milton's definitely real.”
“What kind of delusions?” Sam asked, tilting his head in question.
"She committed a serious crime." Uriel replied, rough voice growing louder as his anger and frustrations grew. He tucked the necklace back under his shirt and clenched his fist at his side.
Dean glanced after him. “That was easy.” Dean commented to no one in particular. Looking back to Bobby, he grinned and picked up his jacket from the back of the chair and went over to the front door. “Don’t wait up!” He called over his shoulder as he left.
Dean rolled his eyes with a huff, knowing that Anna
Sam yawned loudly, momentarily startling Dean. “Go back to sleep, Sammy.” Dean whispered to his tired younger brother.
Anna glanced between the brothers and the demon, getting worried when the brothers looked guilty and Ruby wouldn't meet her eyes. “What?” She asked worriedly.
.” She replied with a spark in her voice.
The red-head couldn’t help but glare at him at the hunter for interrupting her. “What’s so funny?” She harshly asked, “What?”
Castiel quickly looked up into the green eyes of Dean Winchester. “Jensen?!” The angel asked, shocked. Looking closer at the soul in front of him, he realized it was strikingly similar to the true form belonging to the fifth and youngest archangel. How did he not notice it before?
Sam cut himself off and seems to consider something. “Ruby told me that Lilith was cooking up something big of the Apocalypse sort. Think it's got to do anything with the seals?” He asked Dean.
Sam glanced at his brother as he answered tentatively. “Uh, yeah.”
Sam looked to Castiel and Uriel when a beat had passed and rose from where he was holding an injured Ruby. "Well, what are you waiting for? Go get Anna. Unless, of course, you're scared." He smirked, waiting for the angels to disappear to find the angel with newly regained grace.
Castiel’s smirk turned gleeful as he replied to his fiancé, “You are what you eat.”
Dean sat up on the bed and leaned back on his elbows, and glared at Sam. “
“Ass.” Dean grinned in response.
was their commander until she ended up in Heaven’s jail.
“Okay, Anna, wake up in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.” Missouri counted down before pausing. “Anna… Anna? You all right?” She softly asked.
Dean shook his head. “I know enough.” For a second Dean contemplated if he should tell them or not, but decided in the end that it was best if he did. He had been honest this far, why not continue. “Lucifer is going to rise from Hell, from the cage he’s trapped in. There are thousands of seals which works like locks, but only 66 has to be broken. It doesn’t matter which are broken, nor in which order.” Dean paused for a second.
Both Sam and Dean thought back to the case a few years ago, the one with the ghost of a priest people believed was an angel, the case where Sam admitted to praying and believing in angels.
It took 15 minutes to get from the hotel and back to Bobby’s house, during the time which Dean had at least woken up some and was trying to figure out an excuse as to where he had been for the last 24 hours. The best he could come up with was an one night stand and a breakfast somewhere in town.
Uriel glared at Dean as he stood in front of the ex-archangel in a soldier's stance. "Time's up, boy. We want the girl."
Silver glinted in the flames of hellfire as Dean slowly dragged the blade along the soul strapped down on the rack in front of him. The soul sobbed, begged for him to stop, but Dean ruthlessly continued. Layer by layer of skin, he removed it until red muscle was the only thing visible.
Dean lost control of the emotion and pressure and power that had built up within him. He closed his eyes when tears streamed down his face, as the mirror in the bathroom exploded. The beer bottles in the fridge shattered, cracks appeared in the ceiling and walls, all electronics each blew out and the lightbulbs caught on fire and exploded. Objects flew around the room, hitting the walls and any other surface in their way.
Anna nodded as she thought of Heaven’s vast weaponry, the phantom weight of an angel blade falling into her hand. “Nothing we could get to… not right now.” She answered Sam’s question.
There weren’t many people in the diner, at 7 in the evening most people had already eaten. A few people sat spread out in the booths and a few waitresses walked around, some taking plates of food to the customers, some taking the dishes.
Alastair smirked and dragged the razor down Ruby's arm. Blood immediately beaded from the cut. "Wrong answer." He hissed and dug the razor down into the muscles of Ruby's arm.
Sam took a deep breath through his nose and started gathering his stuff in his duffle, ready to get out of the destroyed motel room before the owner could complain. “I trust her because… she saved my life.” He confessed and looked up at Dean.
Sam nodded and continued his story. Ruby taught him stuff, like how bad of a student he was, and of how the first few days with the demon blood-powered abilities were like. Then he began to talk about how Ruby kissed him and how Ruby knew the meat suit was freaking him out and how they fell into bed together and--
Dean chuckled and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s lips. “Sorry, little angel.” He murmured against the blue-eyed man’s lips.
Bobby’s eyes snapped to Castiel, who was watching Dean with fascinated eyes. “And you,” He questioned, causing Castiel to look at him. “You’re okay with Dean being male? Even though you’re an angel?”
“Still don’t like her.” Dean muttered. “How did you and Ruby even wind up together?” Dean asked angrily.
Sam had stabbed the demon with the knife, but nothing had happened. He thought for a second, of the white-eyed demon and why both Dean and Ruby had seemed so scared of him. Sam felt his smile drop at the realization.
’ Dean thought as he smiled fondly.
“Alright.” Bobby replied softly. “We’ll talk tomorrow morning.”
Sam and Bobby hadn’t buried Dean’s body very deep, four feet instead of six. The handmade coffin that was supposed to be Dean’s final resting place looked like it was done in a rush, the boards the coffin was made out of were cut in rough edges, too many nails were put in the material and splinters stuck out. A box of tetanus, Dean concluded to himself.
“Rich Milton.” Anna answered with the smallest twitch of the muscles in her eyebrows. Missouri immediately knew she was suppressing or avoiding the true answer.
Uriel quickly flicked his hand to the side, making Ruby crash into the wall. Dean charged at the dark-skinned angel. But without the advantage of angel strength, Uriel had the upper hand and grabbed Dean's shirt in his grip. Hr raised his fist and placed a hit to Dean's cheek, splitting the skin.
Castiel frowned as he looked at him. “If you’re Dean Winchester, then that means you have to stop the Apocalypse.” Castiel pointed out.
“What’s your dad’s name? Your real dad. Why is he angry at you?” Missouri pressed on, forcing the red-head to answer.
And I felt disappointed in the 'torture' Dean used on Alastair in S4E16:EOn the Head of a Pin. If he was a student under Alastair, then he surely should have done more gruesome things.
“Now, the orderly has no recollection of Anna's escape?” Sam questioned.
“I didn’t bring him here. You did.” She hissed and glared at Dean.
“First words I heard, clear as a bell,
“So what?” Dean responded. “She forgot to mention a few things, and twisted the truth.” He said and looked at Anna who looked shocked and hurt, and was avoiding Dean’s eyes. “Castiel told me he had a suspicion of who you were and asked me to keep an eye on you. Told me a few things that make you seem far from innocent.” Dean explained to the red-head.
The red-haired young woman had blood covering her arms and hands; her own blood, judging by the cuts on her palm.
Castiel nervously looked between them, eyebrows furrowed. “The effects demon blood can have on a person will alter every part of their being. The body, soul,
After they got their food, they climbed into their respective cars to get back to the motel, Sam stopped by the small store to pick up some of Dean’s favorite brand of beer before he was back on the road to the motel.
Sam took a deep breath through his nose and felt a strong smell of sweat and dirt -- as well as the faintest smell of rotting flesh that Sam didn’t want to think about -- coming from Dean’s body and clothes. “Dude, you reek.” Sam exclaimed, his nose wrinkled in disgust.
Sam and Dean finish the problem with Anna (finally). Dean spends some time with his angel family and is hiding something from them.
She nodded and added it to his order.“Anything else I can get ya?” She asked and looked up at him with big brown eyes.
Just as Sam straightened, he saw Ruby across the bar. “Keep the money.” He told the man they were playing against, Brian, and walked towards Ruby.
Niki= Niki Lauda, a legendary Austrian Formula 1 driver (I'm a huge fan of the sport)
Bobby frowned and sat down next to Dean with Sam doing the same. “What kind of ‘work’?” Bobby questioned.
Dean let out a low growl and looked to his brother who was looking between both of the fallen angels with confused eyes, like he wasn’t sure who to trust. The green-eyed man huffed in anger and looked back at Anna.
Castiel sighed but nodded his head in understanding. Dean grinned and leaned against the checkout counter, water bottle held loosely in his hand.
Dean picked at a napkin, tearing off small pieces and rolling them into small balls as he waited. Danielle came back to his table 20 minutes later with a plate with his burger and his mug of coffee.
Dean shrugged. “Dunno. He didn’t tell me. Just said it had something to do with Lilith and the Apocalypse.” Dean explained and took another drink of his beer. He looked at Sam and Bobby’s blank faces and smiled. “Apparently I’m the only one that can stop the Apocalypse from happening.”
Anna shook her head, making some of her red hair fall to har face from where she had tucked it behind her ears. “Not right this second, but a lot. And I can't shut them out, there are so many of them.”
“Sam lost it when he stabbed Alastair.” Dean answered and laughed internally at the bitch-face he received from Sam.
Sam stepped back from the doorway, allowing Dean to step inside. Dean saw the glint of silver as Sam lunged at him and slashed him, catching him on the cheek and leaving a thin red cut. He managed to duck Sam’s next swing before he caught Sam’s arm and and twisted it behind his back, making him drop the blade.
“It's a, uh, it's a little-known translation.” Dean easily lied and continued to flip through the pages of the sketchbook, finding more seals illustrated on the pages.
“But Anna's innocent! Cas shouldn't kill her then!” Sam exclaimed angrily.
The angel bent down and put a hand on his shoulder, grace burning the skin into the shape of the angel's hand-print. It grabbed his upper arm and pulled Dean back onto his feet and when Dean looked up at the giant angel, it came into more focus, not just a bright light anymore. Instead, Dean saw three faces; one zebra, one bull and one that vaguely looked human. It had a grey-blue thin and skinny body, with patches of glowing blue covering it's chest and arms.
Uriel's face grew red from his anger and he was about to strike Dean -- who didn't even flinch when he stepped forward with his fist raised -- when Castiel appeared next to him and caught his arm.
Dean stood outside for another moment before nodding to himself and entering Missouri’s house. He looked through the rooms in search for Anna, Missouri and his brother and found them down in the basement, in a room similar to Bobby’s panic room.
Dean silently nodded. “It is.” Dean smiled and chuckled. “But it’s weird. Underneath the contrasting feelings, it constantly feels like pins and needles, like electricity.” At least, it did as a human. As an angel it felt like you were drunk or high on the power of God. Like an acid trip.
Castiel nodded sadly. “Yes. After a month of staying at Bobby's house, he left to search for answers.” The angel straightened and looked into Dean's eyes. “You do know that most Angels will be against Sam?”
Dean shot up in the bed, still hearing the fluttering of Castiel's wings as  he woke up. He took a second to simply breath and thinking of what both Uriel and Castiel had informed him. He reached for his phone on the bedside table and pulled up Sam's contacts.
At 4 a.m., Dean went to sleep in the guest room of Balthazar and Ariel's house. He was almost scared to go to sleep, afraid of the nightmares of Hell he would probably have. The moment his head touched the pillow, he was out, already being pulled into a heavy sleep.
The idea behind Dean's engagement ring is the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, except it's silver and instead of Elvish writing, it's Enochian.
Sam bolted upright in the bed, his eyes falling on the couch in the darkness as his hand blindly searched for the light switch on the bedside lamp. With a click, the room was flooded with warm yellow light and Sam saw the couch was empty and had probably been for several hours.
Dean nodded, silently saying he understood. He gave Sam a small smile before he turned around and went into the bathroom.
“Glad you could make it.” Ruby greeted them as they came through the door.
I'm sorry for the horrible sex scene but I'm not entirely comfortable writing those kind of scenes. My sister, however, might want to help me (though I doubt it).
(267 words)
Ruby tried to zone out, to ignore the demon, just like she did when she was on the rack. It was hard; Alastair had an aura which haunted her, and his nasally voice was annoyingly hard to ignore.
The click of the lights, however, made him open his eyes again. He turned his head to look at the doorway and saw Bobby standing there, frozen, with his hand on the light switch, wide eyes staring at Dean and Castiel who were still standing in the middle of the living room.
Dean smiled up at the angel through the haze of his orgasm, combing his fingers through the sweaty black hair. “I love you.” He whispered and watched as Castiel’s eyes opened. The blue color was truly magical. Like the sky was trapped in his eyes.
The call to Bobby went pretty much like Dean had expected. Dean himself knew he would've reacted the same way if someone he thought was dead had called him. Disbelief and anger, believing it was a cruel prank. Hopefully, Bobby would be happy to see him and not try to send him back downstairs.
With lots of love, Jupiter Mountainstone
Ever since Sam found out the Apocalypse was on the line, he had laid all his time into trying to find the seals. Dean and Bobby had to force him to take short breaks to use the bathroom, nap, eat and drink.
Anna shook her head as if to clear it and blinked rapidly. “It’s weird… Like a recording… a loop.” She frowned heavily. “It says, ‘Sam Winchester, give us Anna by midnight, or…’”
time. Since I was ten and as I told my therapist, I don't know who I was before my mom got sick and I can't remember what not worrying 24/7 felt like. But all of those worries are over now... I guess...
"Of course it has something to do with the seals." Dean replied before moving out of the angel's embrace. "I gotta warn Sam. Without Anna's grace, Ruby was his best protection... and I'm guessing you have orders to attack?"
ours to take, he belongs either on Earth or in Heaven, not in Hell. For he is the righteous man.” The angel said in a strong voice, the ground beneath Alastair and Dean shook with the power of it.
“Oh, great, demon whisperers -- that's reliable.” He sarcastically remarked.
“Moron.” Dean replied. Ariel, Balthazar, Samandriel and Tessa looked on at the playful bickering with bright smiles on their faces. This was normal, usual, with the archangel and the angel teasing and bickering with each other without any real heat behind it.
“Sex.” Anna finished the argument.
When the sound of Castiel’s fluttering wings faded, Balthazar and Ariel looked at each other, a light behind their eyes, hope and happiness, as they hugged each other tight.
“Your eyes are dilated as if you’re high, your breath stinks of sulphur and copper, the powers Azazel gave you are back with the improvement of exorcising, and you’re hanging with the manipulative bitch Ruby.” Dean said emotionlessly.
(4827 words)
Michael would know I’m alive and it’d put you all in danger.” He explained.
"Uriel," Castiel spoke in a scolding tone. "If you hurt him, you'll be punished."
Castiel shook his head. "No. Not yet. But I suspect the orders will be given soon." He spoke and pressed a kiss to Dean's forehead. "Go. Protect Sam." He breathed against Dean's skin.
Sam felt his stomach drop; the itch of withdrawal was still there, still burning hot, but he’d been able to avoid another his with Dean’s help. But Dean wasn’t there, he was in Texas last Sam had heard of him. “Ruby…” Sam started to protest.
The blue-eyed angel stopped his motion of brushing his fingers through his hair, in favor of using his arm to pull Dean’s body tighter against his own. “I was hoping you and Sam were going to save the town. I was praying for it, actually.” Castiel admitted and kissed the top of Dean’s head as the change in positions had placed Dean’s head straight under his chin.
“What the Hell was that Dean?!” Sam asked angrily once they had gotten back to the motel room and Dean had laid down on his bed. “What were you trying to get her to do? Kill you?”
“He’s gonna kill me!” Anna cried out in fear. She was whimpering and trashing on the bed, with tears streaming down her face.
’. “These are Revelations.”
Sam sighed when Ruby disappeared and walked over to his brother and swung his arm over Dean's neck. "So, I guess Anna's some big-time angel now, huh? She must be happy... wherever she is." He said, almost dreamily.
“That just popped into my head! I don't know how I did it, but I did.” Anna continued, sounding like she was on the verge of a panic attack or an existential crisis.
Dean angrily shook his head. “Why do you still trust her? I've told you several times that she can't be trusted!”
For a second, Balthazar didn’t say anything. But with a snivel, the dam broke. Tears, a mix of happiness, exhaustion and relief, seeped from Balthazar’s grey-blue eyes. “How did we not realize- we could have realized. There shouldn't have been any coincidences while we searched. But now, after so long, he’s back.” Balthazar wrapped Castiel in a tight hug. “I can’t imagine how happy you must be, to have the love of your life back.”
Dean shook his head and the drive continued in silence. And while Dean would like to say that he didn’t think of anything as he hummed along to the music, his brain going haywire as it mixed his memories of Hell and Lucifer into one terrifying mess.
Missouri nodded and shifted her gaze to the younger but taller Winchester that was making his way towards his brother and the psychic. “Hey.” Sam greeted the woman.
“I have part of a plan.” Dean said slowly. It was an idiotic plan, but it would work. “We let the seals break.”
Anna gasped and stepped towards Dean. “It's really you. Oh, my god. The angels talk about you. You were in Hell, but Castiel pulled you out, and some of them think you can help save us. And some of them don't like you at all.” She explained with awe in her voice. She looked up to Sam. “They talk about you all the time lately. I feel like I know you.”
Sam quickly thought it over before he nodded. “Sure.” He agreed and stood. “You gonna be alright?” He asked softly.
Anna quickly nodded, Dean having found the perfect word to describe what she was experiencing. “Yes. Thank you.”
“Oh, really?” Dean smiled and took a drink from his beer. He swallowed his drink and looked around the room, smiling softly at the sight of his family and friends and friends gathered together.
Bobby and Sam looked up at him, tired but hopeful eyes questioning him.
Dean looked at Sam with a raised eyebrow as Sam’s stomach growled again. “When was the last time you ate?” He asked, big brother instincts blaring back into life.
“Dean, hold on okay? Just let me-” Sam started, almost frantically, but Dean cut him off.
Sam quickly turned around, one hand on the gun in the back of his jeans. Behind him stood Bobby, who had a small smirk on his eyes as his eyes were fond. Sam relaxed and dropped his hand from the gun.
Anna shrugged, but her eyes had fear and reluctance as she answered, “No, not really.” She stepped towards the huge tree and Sam and Ruby followed closely behind her.
She carefully put the plate and mug down in front of him, and Dean smiled gratefully at her. She dug out her phone from her pocket and handed it to him. “I hope it's okay. The food, I mean, but I guess the phone applies too.” Danielle blushed. “I'll be back later for the phone.”
“I’m sorry.” Anna apologized. “The angels aren’t talking about it. And it was after I fell.” She lied. She knew very well why they saved Dean; as a high-ranking angel, she knew that Dean was Michael’s true vessel as well as the Righteous Man.
Castiel leant down and pried his long fingers into the space between the lid and box and pried open the box, lifting the lid out of the way and putting it down on the ground with a loud thud.
Dean turned around on the couch and glared at Castiel who was leaning against the doorway. “Damn it, Cas.” Dean growled and stood up to avoid wetting himself more with his drink. “Next time, warn a guy.”
“Oh really? Didn’t you say a few weeks ago that you had gotten powers thanks to your ‘relationship’ with Castiel? Wouldn’t you call that corruption?” Sam yelled in question.
The angel just smiled despite the threat. For 525 years he had known Dean, for 522 of those years he’s loved Dean. He couldn’t even imagine a scenario where he’d hurt Dean, nevertheless break the archangel’s heart. “I promise I won’t hurt him. He’s been through too much for me to hurt him.” Castiel said sincerely.
Dean offered a weak smile in response. “Just because we’re family doesn’t mean we don’t fight. Wanting to kill them comes along with the job of being a big brother. And lastly, we have
of siblings, I can’t pay attention to them all.” He explained with a raised eyebrow, daring Castiel to disagree.
The ex-archangel sniffled and looked back to his friends and family. “Sorry about the breakdown. It just… became too much.” Dean apologized with a small smile.
The old hunter’s eyes shifted back and forth between Dean and the angel, taking in how close they were standing and Dean’s relaxed posture. And in that moment, it occurred to Dean that Bobby hadn’t met the angel yet.
“Can’t you use your mojo and clean me up?” Dean asked as he put on his underwear and jeans. He put on his boots and laced them up efficiently and quickly, and stood to look at Castiel.
Bobby raised an eyebrow at the answer, but didn’t say anything. Instead, Castiel took the word. “My apologies,” He spoke. “But my presence is needed in Heaven.” The angel looked to Dean, pressing a quick peck to the hunter’s lips, before whispering so Bobby didn’t hear: “Nanaeel nonci hoath.”
Sam smiled, completely unaware of Anna’s shock and mistook it as fear or worry and responded, “Well, I’m not that smart.” A hint of pride swelled in his chest as Anna chuckled. Then he grew serious. “Can I ask you something?” He asked.
“Hey.” Sam greeted when Dean reached the living room, smiling at the older Winchester.
"Dean Winchester is saved!" Castiel yelled out, letting all angels in Heaven, Earth and Hell hear him. Wherever they were, they heard.
Sam raised an eyebrow in question of Anna’s last words. “Meaning?” He asked.
The dark haired angel paused and seemed to realise how quickly his sentences followed each other and quietly apologized.
Balthazar looked at Castiel in question and received a nod in return. Balthazar smiled and looked at his wife. “Jay’s back. He’s alive.” He smiled and released a laugh of disbelief.
Uriel ignored Sam's question and took a step forward. “Out of the way.” Hr growled when Sam, Dean and Ruby blocked his way.
It had turned out there was two witches, Tracy Davis and Don Harding, but Sam and Dean had failed to stop Samhain from rising, thus breaking the seal. But Sam had stopped the demon from causing more harm. Unfortunately, he had used the powers from the demon blood. Fortunately, however, it was the last powers he got from his latest dose. At least that’s what Sam told him.
“I gotta go out. Get some food, go to a bar, pick up someone. Anything! As long as I can get out and escape reading!” Dean exclaimed, eyes probably a little crazy by that point.
Dean opened his mouth to make some sarcastic comment, but noticed the fact that Castiel, Uriel's superior, wasn't there. Aware of his fiancé's absence, Dean spoke, "Don't really see you off your leach. Where's your boss?" He asked, feeling a hint of worry curl in his stomach.
Dean looked at Bobby, and he smiled brightly. “Thanks.” He answered, a faint blush coloring his cheeks. “That… means a lot.”
Dean shook his head shamefully. “No.” He answered. “I don’t really know how to tell him. About the fact that I’m dating an angel and I haven’t even told him I’m bi yet, so I don’t even know if he’ll accept that.”
“How can you know that?  Better yet, how can you have seen that? I sure as Hell haven't!” Sam yelled and threw his hands into the air in exasperation.
Light flickered in front of him, and he had to squint at the brightness. His eyes quickly adjusted and he opened them fully to see Castiel sitting on his heels, head tilted to the side like he was studying an interesting painting or text.
Sam smiled and thought of something to say when Anna pressed her lips against his in a kiss. When she pulled back, Sam stood there for a second before he managed to ask, “What was that for?”
“Angel banishing sigils, once activated, feels like you’re caught in a whirlwind while you’re slung away, then you feel like a meteor as you fall back to Earth, miles away from where you once stood. Afterwards, you feel drained, disoriented, fatigued or dizzy.” Ariel explained to the youngest angel in the room.
The torturer smirked as he traced Dean’s plump lips with the tips of his finger. “They’re very real. A real pain in the ass. And they want to take you away because they think you can save them, that you’re the special.” Alastair paused, thinking of Dean’s need of praise and his low self-esteem. “And you are special,” He continued, “Just not in the way those feathers believe.”
At Dean's questioning look, Sam explained. Of how Ruby killed a demon trying to kill Sam and of the car ride where he and Ruby had talked. Sam paused in his retelling and his eyes widened. “Son of a- she told me she had to convince Lilith she was trusted! And the whole time Ruby was already working for her!”
Dean smiled thankfully at her and imagined the research he had to do to find his grace.
I wouldn't be haunted by memories of what happened to me in Hell.” Dean confessed before he paused. “The feeling of an angel’s powers are hard to explain. It's constantly contrasting on itself. Warm yet cold, wet yet dry, benevolent yet evil. Young, but old. Ethereal but also human.”
Dean waved Sam's hand away and sat up, groaning at the ache the movement caused his muscles. He placed one of his hands against Sam's cheek next to where the mirror piece had cut him and tried to let his borrowed grace heal the small cut, but no grace would come. He really had used up his grace in a raged-fueled breakdown. Dean let his arm drop back down onto the bed at the realization and huffed loudly instead.
With just that simple touch, the dark demon essence in Dean’s soul burned away and it was as if Dean’s head exploded. Memories of a life before he was Dean Winchester, a life as God’s fifth creation and as a powerful angel, billions of years worth of memories flooded Dean’s brain.
“Over and over. If you were religious, scared, and had demons on your ass, where would you go to feel safe?” Dean questioned and looked into Sam’s hazel eyes and saw the same thought being reflected in his own eyes.
Contructive criticism is appreciated!
“Yeah, well, it sure ain't goose-chasing after some chick who, for all we know, doesn't even exist, just because you say she's important.” Dean responded, feeling something aking smugness at the angry frown on the demon’s face.
"Let me just remove that for you." Alastair spoke and harshly pulled the gag out of Ruby's mouth. The younger demon grunted at the harsh treatment and Alastair grinned in response. "Now, little demon, tell me; where's the angel?"
“And you’re willing to kill them all?” Dean asked quietly, glaring at Uriel who stared back at him with a mix of boredom and hate.
“Well, yeah.” Anna responded. “But it kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife.” She added with a grim face. “That hurts. I ripped out my grace with my bare hands.”
“Do you remember what you did?” Julia asked and Anna nodded numbly. “You were hysterical. It took four people to restrain you.”
"How'd you find us?" Sam asked. Nobody answered and Sam came to a realization and looked to his brother. "Dean?"
"Where's Ruby?" Sam quietly questioned, worrying about her. He knew she was in Alastair's possession, but he'd like to know the exact location of where she was.
“Alright, what did you find out about Anna?” Dean asked, gladly changing the subject.
FYI, Danielle/Ariel is based of the actress Lesley-Ann Brandt who plays Mazikeen on the Fox/Netflix show Lucifer.
“She-she wouldn't… she’s been helping me all this time…” Sam stuttered, the anger fading as he recounted all the times Ruby helped them. Or did she really help them?
Dean cautiously accepted the items, small bags of cloth, and looked them over in his hands. “Hex bags?” He questioned the demon with a raised eyebrow.
The gravel road turned into asphalt and buildings grew tighter and tighter until he was in the center of whatever Illinois town he was in.
The angel rolled his eyes and waved his hand, cleaning Dean’s body with a swipe of grace. “The hickeys, however, are staying.” He smirked and leaned back on his elbows in the bed.
“I had the day off work and decided to go to the garden to relax. I never expected to meet you there. Immediately, I apologized and tried to leave, but you told me to stay. So I sat down and watched as you puttered around. When you were finished, you sat next to me and asked for my name. You asked me if I was a soldier and I said yes, then you introduced yourself, even though there’s not a single angel who doesn’t know who you are. You were so embarrassed, it was adorable.
Sam returned to the motel room an hour and a half later, ready to apologize for how long he had been gone after having lost his track of time. When he returned to the room, however, there was no angry older brother glaring at him, instead the shower was still on. He placed Dean’s duffel on the bed before he went to the bathroom door.
Dean looked down at the floor with a nod. “Yeah.” He whispered.
Sam quietly piped up. “Anna, when did the voices start? Do you remember?” He asked softly.
Sam shrugged with a smile. “I only said burger to get you interested.”
Dean smiled slightly. “Cas, I gotta eat. There’s no food here so I gotta get money to buy something from a diner or whatever else we may come across. Protein bars, beef jerky and candy bars might be good to get energy, but they’re not very good if you’re hungry.” Dean explained. He shrugged slightly, “Besides, it’s not like they can’t get the money back.”
Anna shook her head. "No. You're not. Not really. You don't know the feeling." She spoke, even though she knew he had gotten free will from the time he had spent with Jensen, but knew better than to mention it in front of Uriel.
Dean smiled gratefully and took the bottle and opened the beer bottle with the silver ring he wore on his right hand, Mary’s old one, which was almost a mirror of his left. As he worked the ring back onto his finger, Dean felt Bobby’s gaze on him, taking in every small moment. He made conscious effort to move like the hunter Dean Winchester and not the archangel Jensen. Less gracious, more harsh, and careful.
Sam scoffed disbelievingly. “How’s that possible?” He questioned. “You guys are powerful and perfect. You don’t doubt yourselves or God or anything.”
“So, where’s this grace of yours?” Sam asked the former angel when they were back at Bobby’s place a few hours later.
I really like Jimmy and I felt like it was appropriate, in some way, to have a human on an angel's shoulder, giving helping tips, instead of an angel on a human's shoulder.
“I mean it.” Anna brightly smiled. “Every emotion, Sam, even the bad ones… It’s why I fell. It’s why… why I’d give anything to not go back. Anything.”
Uriel turned to look at the blue-eyed angel with exasperation. “Castiel! I will not let these peop-” He complained, but Castiel silenced him by holding up a hand.
Castiel smiled weakly at the ex-archangel’s reply. “Thought I’d scare you off.” He lightly joked and looked over to Balthazar who nodded at him encouragingly.
He thought, but simply replied, “That’s not troubling at all.”
With an angry and slightly scared expression, she responded, “Well, then you better pray that Anna gets her groove back, or else we’re all dead.”
"When will you be here?" Sam asked, trying to calculate in his head the time it took to drive from Texas to Kentucky, adding the fact that Dean usually broke the speed limits.
Dean shook his head and took another step towards the angels. “No, but if you’re gonna smite this whole town, then you’re gonna have to smite us with it, because we’re not leaving. See, you went to the trouble of busting me out of Hell. I figure I’m worth something to the man upstairs. So you wanna waste me, go ahead, see how he digs that.”
Castiel nodded his head in a so-so way. “He’s happy that he has his memories back, but Hell is still Hell. And it must be very strange for him; living as a human for a few decades and then find out you weren’t who you thought you were and not a human either. So I wouldn’t say he’s good, but I wouldn’t say he’s bad either.”
"Haven't been here since Poland '43. Truth is, I loathe it. It's chilly. No stink of blood or sizzle of flesh or the wet flap of flayed skin. I don't know how you can stand it. So, the sooner you grow some balls and go back to your mission, the sooner I can finish with this ghastly angel business and return home to my studies. But no rush. Let's take our time... relish the moment." Alastair monologued.
“That tickles.” The demon said smugly as his eyes flicked to white. “You don't have the juice to take me on, Sam.” The demon continued before it threw Sam away from him with an invisible force.
Alastair smirked as he saw more and more of Dean’s bright soul become darker and demonic. The master of torture had known Dean was the righteous man the moment he appeared in Hell, that Dean was the key to breaking the first seal. And it had been broken. Alastair was proud of himself and Hell when Dean Winchester broke after only 30 years. John Winchester hadn't even been close to breaking at 30 years.
Bobby then glared at Castiel and stabbed a finger towards the angel. “And you,” Bobby growled quietly. “If you ever hurt him, if you so much as touch the wrong hair on his head, I’m coming for ya. And I’ll do anything in my power to rip you apart.” He threatened.
Castiel was a little taken aback by Dean’s begging, but nodded nonetheless. He pressed a kiss to the ex-archangel’s forehead and whispered, “I will do my best to stop her.” He untangled his limbs from Dean’s and placed the green-eyed man back down on the couch. “Thank you for a wonderful time.” He told the others before moving towards the front door.
Around 10 in the night, when the angels and the reapers started showing signs of  being drunk themselves, angel radio sparked to life. The angels froze and their eyes glazed over, leaving Tessa and Dean to look at each other with raised eyebrows.
“How’s the car?” Dean asked instead of returning the greeting.
“Well, write to your congressman.” Dean commented carelessly as Anna watched him and the demon interact with wide eyes.
Dean thought. He hummed in understanding and rubbed his chin as he replied. “Kind of heavy for a 2 year old.”
Sam smiled as he ordered a caesar salad and Bobby ordered a cheeseburger. The two decided to bring their food to the motel room, Sam thinking it was better that Bobby found out sooner rather than later about Dean being back from the dead.
Dean was the first of the brothers up on his feet, scrambling on the ground until he had his feet under him with glass crunching under his boots, feeling his dislocated shoulder pop back into its socket with the help of some grace. He looked up at the window he and Sam had just burst through and saw Alastair staring down at them. The demon held up the knife and looked at the blood-stained blade before looking into Dean’s green eyes with a smirk on his face.
Castiel thought and chuckled lightly.
Dean was about to answer, but Castiel cut him off. “I came here to comfort my partner who had been awoken by a nightmare.” He confessed. Dean casted a quick glare at him before he looked back to his surrogate father with nervousness fluttering in his heart.
I appreciate all the nice reviews I've gotten and don't worry, I will continue writing this book until it's finished.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bobby didn’t seem to accept that as an answer and was about to ask again -- full sentence this time -- but Sam cut him off with an answer. “Dean was saved by an angel.”
Castiel smiled softly. "Nanaeel nonci t'hoath." He replied easily.
The red-haired woman slowly nodded. “Yeah, I think so.” She started and glanced at Ruby. “Ruby's not like other demons. She saved my life.”
Sorry it took me over half a year to post this, but so much has happened this year (both to me personally but also globally), but I'm going to try and continue writing.
Dean smiled; he had found himself smiling more since he got his memories back, despite the threat of the Apocalypse hanging over his head. Most likely because of Castiel. “Thought I was your light?” Dean questioned in a teasing voice as he moved back from the angel.
“He followed you from the girl's house. We got to go now.” Ruby commanded in a rough voice.
Ruby calmed down with a deep breath, but she still sounded agitated when she spoke, “Anna’s grace is gone. You understand? She can’t angel up. She can’t protect us. We can’t fight Heaven
Ariel rose from her seat on the armchair armrest and sat down next to the ex-archangel and slung her arm around his neck. “We understand, Jay. But we’ll help you find it, then you can choose if you want it or not.” She told him and pressed a kiss to his cheek.
Anna turned around in the bed and her eyes widened in horror when she saw the attendant’s face.
?” Sam questioned, hoping they meant it in a sympathetic way.
so the strong can live.” She growled in Dean’s face.
The brothers entered the living room and saw Mr. and Mrs. Milton on the floor, both with their throats slit. Sam rushed over and kneeled down next to the bodies and ran his fingers through some powder next to their bodies. “Sulfur. The demons beat us here. Whatever the deal is with this Anna girl-”
Sam rolled his eyes with a smile before he told Anna about the information he had found. “Union, Kentucky. Found some accounts of a local miracle.” He spoke, relying the piece of research to the ex-angel.
Dean smiled gratefully before addressing Sam. "Send the address and I'll be there as soon as I can." He said before hanging up. 30 seconds later, Sam sent the address and Dean said his goodbyes to the two married angels. "Bye. I'll see you soon. Hopefully." He spoke.
“Yes. His plan is to let all the seals break except the last. We put our time into finding the last seal and then we protect it from any creature who wants to break it.” Castiel recounted the plan.
"Sorry, I'm late with the demon delivery. I got caught up being tortured." Ruby spat and glared at the green-eyed hunter. She huffed and disappeared, leaving Sam's arms empty.
“I’m sorry, Cas. If I had remembered I would’ve told you immediately. I wish things would’ve been different.” Dean apologized.
Dean commented in his head.
“Bullshit!” Sam called, and threw a punch. It grazed Dean’s cheek, but never hit him as he ducked to the side.
“Uh, not much.” Sam answered and sat on the couch with Anna’s report in his hands. “Her parents were, uh, Rich and Amy Milton -- a church deacon and a housewife.”
Okay, I don't know how clear it comes across, but I'm trying to make Jensen (not Dean) become more nerdy and kind and soft (a little like the real Jensen) but I'm also trying to add Dean to the mix.
“Yeah.” Sam quietly agreed and felt sympathy for his older brother. Dean's boyfriend wouldn't hesitate to hurt him if Heaven told him to do so.
“She is far from innocent.” Castiel retaliated and Dean had to bite his cheek to keep from agreeing.
Dean leaned back against the wall, mirroring his brother, and Sam grew silent as Missouri straightened her back as she stood over the red-haired woman.
When Dean opened his eyes again, he was no longer in the home of his two siblings, instead, he found himself in an old, worn barn. He turned around to look at his surroundings but found himself looking at Uriel's face instead.
Anna stood in the hallway for a second, in shock, before she joined the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anna was laying on a bed -- more comfortable than the one in Bobby’s panic room -- with Missouri standing by a chair next to her. Sam was leaning against the door opening with his arms crossed over his chest.
“How are you- What- I thought you were dead!” Castiel stuttered out, shock emanating from each word.
“It’s fine.” Sam quickly answered and sat up straighter in the bed. “It’s nothing we can’t talk about later.”
Sam released the breath he was holding, bringing his hands up to run through his hair. “Why?” Sam whispered as he looked at his older brother with sad eyes.
“My grace.” Anna replied. “It’s… energy. Ripped it out and fell. My mother, Amy, couldn’t get pregnant. Always called me her little miracle. She had no idea how right she was.” She sadly responded.
“Cas, stop talking.” Dean commanded with a weak glare. “You’re rambling.”
Dean pulled his arms tighter around himself, trying to make himself smaller. “I… broke in Hell, Sam.” He took a deep breath. “At the end of every day, Alastair, my torturer, he would offer me the chance to get off of the rack if I picked up the blade myself.” Dean swallowed thickly and closed his eyes against the burning tears. “I tried to hold on, but after 30 years I couldn’t take it anymore.”
Ruby, who stood outside the open door to the panic room with crossed arms, sneered at them. “Which I find racist, by the way.” She commented.
Castiel nodded and pulled him close to his chest, Dean clutching at his shoulders. With a strong beat of his wings, Castiel took flight and soared up. He swung his blade at every demon that came close while Dean clutched onto Castiel’s chest, silently begging the angel to not drop him.
“How was the meal? Can I get you anything else- hello.” Danielle interrupted her flustered questions when she saw Castiel. Her eyes roamed over his with interest, making Dean uncomfortable and slightly jealous.
“Perfect… like a marble statue. Cold… no choice… only obedience. If we were to get free will, we would be punished, especially us soldiers, we would be re-educated by Heaven’s best.” She sighed heavily. Anna looked at Sam and offered him a weak smile. “Sam, do you know how many angels have actually seen God? His face?”
The angel turned it’s human like face to look at Dean, making sure Dean was okay and Dean sucked in a sharp breath. He knew this angel. Intimately.
(5840 words)
“I don’t care what happens to you. I don’t care if it’s Heaven or Hell who captures you. Either way, it won’t end happily for you.” Dean spoke and turned around to go up the stairs and get out of the room Anna was in. Though, Dean stopped with his foot on the first step of the stairs and looked back at his brother. “I won’t judge you if you help her. But know that she is not innocent… if you need me, you have my number.” Dean told Sam and walked up the stairs.
Dean smirked as he opened the front door and looked over his shoulder to his brother-by-body, sister-turner-human and the demon. “We’re gonna take a trip to Lawrence, Kansas.”
Dean smiled at the affectionate tease and replied with, “Idiot.”
The psychic slowly nodded even though Anna couldn’t see her. “Alright. But I want you to look further back… when you were very young… just a couple of years old.” She countered and watched as Anna’s eyes clenched shut.
. And as for the angels, they were
“As Dean Winchester.” Balthazar supplied.
Also, heads up for a non-graphic sex scene.
Castiel took the glass from Balthazar’s hand, “Thank you,” and sipped the amber liquid. Lowering the glass, Castiel watched his brother and fellow soldier take a sip from his own glass. “I found Jensen.” The younger angel said softly.
Dean chuckled and sarcastically replied, “Sorry. Get yourself another one. Try JDate!” He smiled.
Anna smiled as she replied, “You know, our last night on Earth and all that.”
Dean didn’t realise he was crying until Sam pulled him into a hug and his tears soaked Sam’s t-shirt. “Anyone in your position would have done the same thing. Anything to stop the pain.” Sam whispered, still in a bit of shock from Dean’s revelation.
Dean prayed to his fiancé, and received no answer. He could only hope that Castiel understood what he meant and that no angel heard the prayer.
Sam and Anna followed the psychic inside -- the Winchester looking at his older brother with a questioning look -- while Dean leaned his back against the Impala and closed his eyes as he prayed to Castiel.
When Dean saw Anna getting her grace back from where he was still pressed to the wall, he screamed to Sam and Ruby, "Shut your eyes! Shut your eyes!"
In contrast to Uriel who was hitting Dean,
Anna threw out a hand and an invisible force threw Sam away and then slammed him into the wall.
Sam and Dean’s eyes met across the pool table as Sam was about to take his shot and Sam raised his eyebrow, all traces of fake drunkenness gone. Dean responded by raising his eyebrow back and Sam broke and made his shot, sinking several balls.
Dean seemed to get to a conclusion as he answered, “Actually, we're working a case, but thanks.”
“What do you think?” Sam asked while he was checking the cut on Dean's cheek and lip.
(4636 words)
“Couldn’t you just leave 'em at the door?” Dean glared and gestured to the towels.
Anna shook her head in answer to Missouri’s question. “Try the other way around. I was their commander until I fell.” She added in explanation.
Dean prayed and saw Castiel sigh, but accept it.
It really did, barely anyone had accepted Dean and Castiel’s relationship in Heaven. Not the ones like Michael, Uriel, Naomi and Zachariah who were adamant on following orders. Because,
Dean shoved his brother away from him with a grunt before walking on wobbling legs back to the Impala, tossing the keys to Sam over the roof of the car, hitting the younger Winchester in the chest, before getting in the passenger seat.
Anna released a humorous snort at the question. “You don’t really mean that!”
I posted one version of this chapter earlier, but deleted it and rewrote the ending as I realized it wouldn't work.
Dean smiled and pulled back from the embrace to look Castiel in the eyes. He sobered and put on a serious face. “You gotta stop Sam from finding Anna’s grace, if he does he’ll be in even more danger than before and… Heaven might take her back as she’s an excellent soldier and the Host is probably desperate for any type of help. You
“Why?” Dean questioned, challenging Ruby to tell them more.
Dean chuckled lightly and looked down at the floor. “That… is a long-ass story.”
Sam sighed heavily after a beat of silence. "I never liked Uriel." He commented, only just realizing the absence of the demon, but hiding his worry from his brother.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “So, what happened, she just... flipped?” He questioned, trying to keep the edge of disbelief out of his voice.
“What were you doing?” Julia asked softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled weakly and stroked the dark hair, as Samandriel asked, “I’ve never had an angel banishing sigil used on me. What does it feel like?”
Dean hummed and pulled his t-shirt over his head. “I’m okay with that.” Grabbing his jacket from where it was at the edge of the bed, Dean turned to look at the angel. “I’ll talk to you later. But right now, I’ve gotta find a way to stop the Apocalypse. And don’t forget to check out of the room before you leave.”
Castiel grasped Dean’s soul firmly, making it go from it’s human appearance to the blue ball of light humans see, and lowered it into the handmade coffin. Dean’s body glowed bright blue as Castiel’s hand entered his chest and released the soul inside. A pulse wave of power was released, angelic grace and soul essence strong enough to knock down the surrounding trees and would have burnt any human close by to ash with the power.
Back at the motel room, Dean sat on his motel bed while Sam stood in the bathroom and sew up a cut on his arm. Dean blankly stared at the wall, in shock, and was unaware of Sam calling him from the bathroom. “You alright? Got any injuries?” Sam called, but received no response. He poked his head out of the bathroom as he placed the last stitch on his arm and saw his older brother sitting on the edge of the motel bed.
“Yeah?” Anna spoke and crossed her arms as she leaned back against the wall.
” She continued, offering a weak smile to the brothers.
And while I'm busy dealing with everything my mom left behind and those type of stuff, fucking Corona is ruining everything. I am writing this while I'm listening to my teachers on my online classes. My mom's funeral was ruined because so few people were brave enough to show up. Sweden (where I live) is in a partial quarantine, meaning you can go out and go to stores, but we can't be over 50 people in the same place and all classes above 9th grade are cancelled (younger kids are still in school due to them not being able to be home alone while their parents work and the parents can't be home with their kids 'cause they're possibly a nurse or doctor or something important that can't be at home for a longer period of time).
For a couple of seconds, the hunter and the ex-angel sat in silence and enjoyed the quiet the night offered.
Dean and Castiel stayed at the hotel room the entire night and Dean got his first night of sleep without any nightmares since before he got out of Hell. The entire night, Dean laid in the angel’s arms and used his chest as a pillow, while Castiel slept for the third time in his existence.
Dean stood in the shower, leaning against the tiled wall as the warm water cascaded down his body. He didn’t do anything to wash himself with the toiletries and instead he thought of the memories he had regained only a few hours earlier.
Before either Winchester could answer, Ruby ran into the attic. “You got the girl. Good, let's go.” She rushed out and urged them to run back out with her, but Dean stayed just like Anna did.
What was worse than the fact he was destroying his soul with the demon blood, was the fact that he was lying to Dean. Dean, selfless, kind and brave Dean, who had just gone through 40 years of Hell. Lying and hiding from Dean was almost as bad as finding out he had demon blood coursing through his veins. But he tried not to think about it, and instead focused on hunts, on saving as many people as he could.
Dean looked up from where he was staring at his engagement ring. He wished things would have been different and he and Castiel could go and live a quiet life without Heaven interfering. He shook his head and looked up at Anna. “Nah.” He answered Anna’s question.
Dean smirked, but it never quite reached his eyes. “One of the benefits of being best friends with an angel who pulled you out of Hell; is that the angel can borrow out some powers to you and the angelic vision allowing them to see the true forms of demons and angels.” Dean shrugged nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t almost revealed the very fact he was trying to hide. Anger can be a vicious motivator, possible even reveal a hidden relationship.
Dean’s body tensed as thoughts of confession whirled around in his head. He opened his mouth and shut it a few times before he sighed. He couldn’t explain it in a good way without giving away the truth of his biology.
Sam quickly answered while Dean decided to keep silent and protect his fiancé. “You know them?” Sam asked.
I just got out of a 10 year long relationship with a manipulative partner (friend, not romantic) and realized
as she pulled back people Sam, Dean and Bobby couldn’t save. Meg Masters, Ronald Reznick, Victor Henriksen, the twin sisters. The guilt of not being able to save them came back, almost worse than before as they were used as pawns in the chess game that was the Apocalypse.
Sam chuckled loudly at the irony between their two similar ‘childhoods’.
As Anna passed Dean, he casually leaned closer to her and whispered to her, "Uriel's necklace." He hated her with his whole being, but he also loved her, she was his sister. And he hated Uriel even more and was scared of what he could do with the grace, which is why he went with the impulse to tell her where her grace was.
Dean smiled sadly. “Yeah.” Dean huffed. “Sam Winchester, the boy with the demon blood. Azazel’s favorite child and destined boy king of Hell. Heaven has many reasons to be against him.”
Dean slowly nodded.
Ruby gave back on holding back her screams and released the sounds of pain, born from Alastair approaching her pussy with the blade. "No." She said when Alastair stopped cutting her.
“What do they want Dean for? Why did they save him? Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t see why Heaven would have saved him.” Sam explained and looked at the ex-angel with an expectant expression.
Dean huffed in frustration and rolled his eyes. “I’ll bite. Who are you?” He asked in a frustrated and tired voice.
Before Sam could reply, Anna timidly spoke up. “Uh, guys? The angels are talking again.”
Dean gave her a breathy laugh. “Yeah.” He chuckled humorlessly. “Sorry ‘bout that.” He murmured.
The young woman grabbed her red hair in her fists and took a shuddering breath. “Why is all of this happening to me?” She asked in a thick voice, sounding almost like she was on the verge of tears.
The drop of the mood in the room was nearly visible as it went from light-hearted to nervous and strained.
He turned around, a protein bar in his mouth, and saw Castiel looking at him disapprovingly. “What?” Dean asked around the bar in his mouth.
Castiel was more than content to stay in the bed the whole night, watching his fiancé sleep and protecting him from whatever dangers could appear. Even if the worst danger is mostly nightmares; not real.
“Sshh!” Ruby quickly hissed at the younger brother. “Okay, yes, so I'm possessing this maid for a hot minute. Sue me.” She growled in a low voice.
Also, I started senior high school. It sucks, but at least the name's cool. 'Jensen'. It started as a joke with Ackles and all that, but I actually ended up getting interested in their law programme. So now I go there and I'm already thinking of dropping out as it's terrible and not like we were promised.
Castiel glared at him before looked to the two hunters. “Look, we have our orders-” Castiel started, but Sam cut him off.
I apologize for the lazy writing, but I just wanted to finish this. I really wanted the scene where Dean talks about Gabriel 'cause he was such a big part about Dean's past and I wanted to introduce the Debriel (?) relationship before the chapter with Changing Channels.
(4189 words)
“I’ve had worse.” He responded and turned to get to his brother and Ruby. He had almost forgotten he was injured, so used to worse injuries that a split lip and bruised cheekbone felt like a small bruise.
Warning, this chapter is horrible and poorly written 'cause I just wanted a finished chapter.
Sam looked at Dean with concerned eyes as he withdrew his hand. “Jesus, Dean.” Sam muttered, heart swelling with worry at the sight of his brother’s pale and clammy face.
The maid rolled her eyes and slipped a piece of paper into Sam's hand. “I'm at this address.” She said in a low voice and pressed the paper into Sam's palm.
, Dean had called the demon. Why was that name familiar? A memory of the night when Dean returned resurfaced in his head.
“What can I get you?” She asked in a soft and slightly tired voice. It was a woman with silky black hair tied into a ponytail, and kind brown eyes. She looked like the type of woman Dean would hit on.
“Who was?” The older curiously asked. “The plumber, hmm? A little snaking in the pipes?” He joked and watched as Sam’s expectant face turned into an unimpressed bitchface.
Dean paused with his beer bottle against his lips, having been cut off guard by Samandriel’s question. He lowered his bottle and placed it with the other empty beer bottles on the table. Dean had only had one bottle of beer -- two if you counted the bottle he was drinking when Samandriel asked him about his grace.
Before Dean could respond with another remark, Sam cut him off. “Dean.” He spoke and pointed to a statue with blood leaking from it’s eyes.
-- and gave him a pleading look. “We have to get out of here.” He insisted.
“Ruby's got her. I'm sure she's okay.” Sam responded and immediately received a cold and hard glare from his brother.
Dean brushed his fingers over the dark wood of the table and found Sam’s duffel on one of the chairs. “Why are you in the honeymoon suite?” Dean asked softly, ignoring the question Sam had asked.
I've come to the realization that Anna was never imprisoned before her fall, but bear with me and pretend that she was.
“We have to have been created somehow, right?” She joked lightly, though the humor didn’t feel genuine. “And we have to have faith, otherwise that’s another re-education on the rap sheet.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “I solemnly swear to not hunt like a bumbass and get myself killed.” He replied, though his reference was lost on Castiel.
Thank you so much for all of the support and nice comments I got from my last update.
Ruby sat silently behind Sam as he read through the magazines, waiting for him to find some valuable and useful information.
Sam looked to her as he softly asked, “What are they saying?” Deep down, his stomach curled with trepidation.
(4074 words)
Sam nodded quickly. “I know. Dean told me about him.” He replied, before adding, “And?”
in the room?” He asked and looked at Ruby, whose eyes had flicked to black when the angels had entered.
Dean sat down one of the chairs by the table where the food laid and took a deep swig of beer, before placing it on his knee, contemplating on how to explain everything. “Angels are real.” Dean decided was the most obvious start. “And they rescued me from Hell as they have ‘work’ for me.” Dean explained with air quotes.
“I see.” Julia hummed and leaned back on her chair and made another note.
Dean’s breathing hitched in fear, coldness seeping into his body as he knew Alastair saw the small amounts of grace. Alastair turned around when he heard footsteps behind him, only to have Sam shove the demon knife into his shoulder. But, again, nothing happened. Alastair didn't die.
“Dean Winchester.” The woman drawled in response before they pulled out of the hug. She lowered her voice as she looked at him with warm eyes. “Or should I call you Jensen?” She asked with a raised eyebrow.
Sam took Anna by the arm and pushed her into a supply closet. “Okay. Stay in there. Don’t move.” Sam commanded in a quiet voice.
Dean nodded and went up next to his brother who took the sketches from Dean’s offered hand. “Check this out.” Sam said and compared one of the sketches to the photograph. “She was drawing the window of the church.”
Dean sat curled up in the shower, water still pouring down his body as he stared blankly at the tiled wall. Sam rushed over and shut off the freezing water.
So, in canon, I feel like Ruby never had feelings for Sam. But for me, I feel like she should've had. Mostly because I love Genevieve.
Sam shook his head in response to Dean’s begging. “No, why would I do that?” Sam lied. It was a lie that tasted like acid when it slipped off his tongue. When Dean looked at him, he tried to look innocent, which he seemed to manage, judging by the fact that Dean let his head drop and his tense shoulders relaxed.
At the sound of the panic, Dean stopped and turned around to face her. He took Anna’s hand into his and examined the deep gash in her hand that hadn't stopped bleeding, before grabbing a piece of cloth he had in his back pocket -- in case a bandage was needed and there was no first aid kit around -- and pressed it into Anna's palm, making the young woman hiss at the sting it caused. He took hold of her other hand and pressed it down on the cloth, adding pressure. “Keep your hand there and keep applying pressure on the cut.” He ordered.
“If Ariel’s in, then so am I.” Balthazar beamed.
Dean smiled sadly. “It was actually 40 years. One month up here equals ten years in Hell. I spent my last ten years downstairs torturing other souls.” Dean sighed shakely and squeezed his eyes tightly shut. “I just wanted the pain to stop. I couldn’t bear it. So I accepted the knife and got off the rack. And after so long of having the pain targeted on myself, it was almost euphoric to have someone else be the victim. But now, coming back to myself, all I feel is guilt.”
Sam, back on his feet, looked at Anna with furrowed eyebrows. “Remember what?” He questioned quietly.
Dean sighed and laid back on the bed. “That was the powers Castiel gave me being unleashed after I lost control over them.” He answered mechanically. “Cas gave me a little of his own powers in case I needed to heal any injuries on myself or others, and to help me identify demons and angels’ true forms.” Dean groggily turned his head and looked at Sam. “Cas’ powers won't corrupt me, they're essentially just a booster for the soul.”
Dean frowned down at his body once it came out into the light. It was beginning to decay, but he could still see that it had been cleaned, the cuts on his face wiped clean and the dirt he had on his face was wiped away as well. He could clearly remember that his shirt had been ripped open, but now he had on a whole black t-shirt.
“I'm sorry, what?” Sam questioned the maid in front of him as she stepped back and gave him space.
The demon snorted humorlessly. “Oh, you call that thinking?” Sam looked at her with shocked eyes; he didn’t know what he had done to make the demon angry at him, but he guessed he had done something for Ruby to act like she was.
“Now's not the time to bellyache about Sam going darkside. He does his thing, he exorcises that demon, or we die.” Ruby interrupted Dean with a small smirk.
going on with her.” Dean stated and stood from the hard chair he had been sitting on. “See what you can find out.” He continued and made his way over to where Anna was sitting and examining the fresh bandage Sam had wrapped around her hand once he got his hands on a First Aid kit.
Castiel and Uriel disappeared with fluttering wings and Sam, Dean and Ruby all sighed in relief, even though Dean already felt longing for his fiancé.
Castiel is suspicious of Uriel and finds out the truth about his fellow soldier.
Anna quickly shook her head. “No. No. There are about 600 possible seals, and Lilith only has to break 66 of them, and no one knows which 66 she's gonna break.” She answered.
“What are you gonna do?” Sam asked and got up with his brother, picking up the First Aid kit.
Sam’s eyes widened and Ruby looked slightly scared. It was almost humorous seeing Sam’s face so shocked, but all Dean could feel was betrayal. “Angel whore…” Ruby said under her breath, but Dean still heard it. He glared at her before looking back to Sam.
Dean was sitting on Bobby’s old couch in the living room and nursed a bottle of beer, staring at the piles of books on the tables, floors and chairs through the darkness. On any available surfaces, there was books. Books about angels, demons, Hell, Heaven, archangels, the Apocalypse, anything useful that might give them ideas on seals. Even Dean’s own books were there.
Dean looked at the bloody demon, knowing the marks of Alastair's torture as soon as he saw it. "What took you so long?" He asked, feeling the strong urge to taunt and mock her.
Dean thought,
Looking around, Dean made sure nobody saw Castiel's disappearance before he continued his walk to Sam's motel.
Dean pushed Sam away from him and slowly made his way back onto his feet, only for his legs to wobble under his weight when he stood up. Sam was immediately by his side again and slipped an arm around the older Winchester's waist to hold him up. With agonizingly slow steps, Sam and Dean made their way back to the beds.
Dean smiled weakly. “Side effects of losing all grace -- that's what the angels’ powers are called, by the way. And believe me, if I were an angel, the side effects would be much more chaotic.” Dean responded, feeling that the loss of grace didn't cause too massive damages, thankfully. Possibly because angel grace and archangel grace reacted differently; an archangel using angel grace would be fine, but a low-tier angel using grace from higher-tier would have bad consequences.
Ruby looked exasperated and annoyed at his refusal. “Sam…” She growled in a low voice.
episodes. And as I'm writing while I'm in school, I can't watch the episodes so instead I use the transcripts, but sometimes they don't give the same imformation an episode can give. So, either I wait until later to watch the episodes or I imagine how I would act in the situation.
Castiel placed his forehead on Dean’s, rubbing their noses together in an eskimo kiss. “I love you too, my light.” Castiel murmured sleepily.
Dean chuckled against the bare flesh of the angel’s chest. “Your orders were to follow my orders?” He asked with a smile.
Sam sighed. “Dean…” There was a tone in Sam’s voice that sounded… disappointed, as if he had hoped Dean’s time in Hell had changed him.
Sam, Dean and Bobby had been back from Illinois for 2 days and all they had been doing was reading. With short breaks to the bathroom, to eat and to fill up on coffee and/or booze. Or take a nap. A sweet, relaxing and precious nap.
Dean smiled. “Yeah, it’s me.” He opened his arms. “I’m back…” He stopped speaking when a splash of holy water covered his face. Spitting out the water in his mouth, he prepared to berate Sam, but was stopped when Sam threw himself into Dean’s arms. Sam clutched the back of Dean’s t-shirt tightly in his hands, a wave of relief coursing through Sam’s tall body.
Dean chuckled quietly to himself at the thought and couldn’t help it when he added;
“Why?” Sam pressed on.
Missouri placed a soft hand on Anna’s arm and said in a reassuring voice, “It’ll be okay, Anna, just one look -- that’s all we need.”
Dean sighed heavily and sat up. “I know, Sammy. Anger… it makes people say and do things they don't really mean. But you really gotta stop with the demon blood. I don't want to lose you, not again.” Dean said and looked at Sam with eyes that seemed to hold a soul far older than the body. Sam found himself nodding in response to the look. “But, I forgive you and I don't blame ya for what you said.” Dean softly spoke and slapped his hand down on Sam's shoulder.
Dean startled at the touch and came back to reality. He blinked up at Sam with dazed green eyes, but they quickly cleared as he looked at his younger brother. “You promised me, Sam.” Dean spoke hoarsely as Sam sat down on the bed in front of Dean. “You promised me you wouldn’t drink her blood. Or any demon blood, really.”
By the way, I get all of the transcripts for dialouge from the site supernaturalwiki.com. The page has transcripts for
“Ariel.” Dean smiled and looked her up and down. She dressed simply, in a grey long-sleeved shirt and a pair of tight black jeans, and her shoulder brown hair laid wavy and touched just her shoulders with the tips of it. Her golden brown skin seemed to glow in the tavern’s weak lightning.
After walking for half an hour, Dean arrived at the bar and entered. At 3 in the afternoon, not many people were at the bar, but Dean wasn’t completely alone either. Dean smiled at the familiarity and sat down by the bar. The bartender, a young boy that probably just got old enough to drink, looked up from the magazine he was reading.
“What?” Dean asked tiredly.
backstory for Jensen (and Castiel and the other angels)
Next chapter is THE chapter! Sam finds out who Dean really is and the brothers figure out how to proceed. (It will probably be posted soon as I have most of it written already)
Slender arms wrapped around both Dean and Balthazar, causing Dean to flinch at the unexpected contact. Looking up from the embrace, he saw the waitress, Danielle, from the diner in Illinois, but Dean had a very strong suspicion that it wasn’t just her anymore.
Dean felt tears burn in his eyes, Sam’s gentle touch a huge contrast to what he went through in Hell. Dean wrapped his own arms around Sam, but recoiled when he touched Sam’s bare upper body.
Sam sat down on the couch and took a couple of books with him while Bobby opened his book and started reading. Three of the best hunters in the world, stuck reading lore books for hours on end.
“A rum and coke, please.” Dean requested with a smile. The young man quickly threw together the cola, rum and ice with a lime and handed the drink to Dean.
Constructive criticism is appreciated!
Sam frowned and knocked softly on the door. “Dean? Are you okay?” He softly asked. There was no answer on the other side. “Dean?!” Sam asked. No answer.
After just over a minute, everything stopped and silence spread in the aftermath of the attack. Sam looked up at his brother with fear in his eyes and saw Dean standing camly, unscathed -- except for the blood seeping from his nose -- with his hands clenched at his sides. When Dean opened his eyes, Sam gasped; the normal green eyes were glowing in a soft blue light, something unnatural about them. The light faded like dust flying away in the wind and, like a puppet with its strings cut, Dean collapsed onto the floor.
“You overhear them?” Sam asked.
Anna bit her lip and turned so she was facing Sam. “I gotta tell you something. You’re not gonna like it.” She told the hunter and got a raised eyebrow as a sign to continue. “About a week ago, I heard the angels talking… About Dean… What he did in Hell. He tortured souls-"
Sam felt a flash of anger in his chest. “Don’t call her that.” He warned. The anger should have terrified him, just as the fact he was protecting a demon. But for some reason he didn’t feel anything but anger.
Castiel looked back up at him and put a hand on his shoulder. “It’s not your fault. We aren’t blaming you. Besides, we never gave up hope nor did we stop searching. Me, Balthazar and Ariel never gave up on you, we always kept the hope that we would’ve found you.” He admitted, his eyes shining with happiness. “And I did. I found you.”
The blue-eyed angel chuckled and rubbed his hand down Dean’s back in an apology and grinned at his friends.
Sam took a shaky breath. “Angels are real?”
So, as stated in the previous 'Not A Chapter', my mom had been sick for a
Sam roughly pushed Ruby onto the bed as he quickly undressed. Once the last piece of Sam’s clothing was off and on the floor, he leaped onto the bed where a naked Ruby laid.
, Dean was out of the door. With quick steps, Dean made his way through the streets of Sioux Falls, wishing he had taken Baby the day before so he didn’t have to walk while hungover and freshly awakened.
Taking the protective hex bag out of her pocket, she set it on fire with the help of a lighter. Barely a second passed before Alastair appeared, looking casual while giving off a dangerous and threatening vibe.
The red-haired girl shrugged. “You tell me. You tell me why my life has been leveled… why my parents are dead.” She ranted angrily. “I don’t know! I swear! I would give anything to know.”
“We're from the sheriff's department. We just wanted to ask you a couple of questions.” Sam easily picked up where the older Winchester left off.
Anna paused for a second, contemplating what to say next, before settling for, “I was stationed on Earth for 2,000 years. Just… watching… silent… invisible… sick for home… waiting for orders from an unknown father I can’t even begin to understand. Watching and waiting until I fell in love with humanity. So don’t tell me that-” She ranted, but was cut off by Sam.
Bobby looked between the two, amused, as he saw the glint in Dean’s eyes. The green seemed to shine brighter as Dean looked at Castiel, like happiness and love mixed together. “Well, I’m happy for ya, idjit.” The gruff hunter smirked.
"Alastair." Ruby replied and watched as the older demon moved around her like a predator looking at its prey.
Dean's chest felt tight, like his ribs were squeezing his lungs and heart. Happiness and relief taking up the entire space behind his sternum. “Alright, Sammy. No need to start a Pride parade just because I've come out as bi.”
Sam did a double take at the answer. “Wait, you mean falling, like, literally?” He questioned with furrowed eyebrows.
As if breaking out of a transe, Dean glanced at Sam and slipped on his business face and crossed his arms over his chest. “What’s the status on the seals?” Dean asked in a rumbling voice.
With a sigh, Ruby said, “You should pull him and out and throw him back in the pit… if you weren’t so out of shape.”
Sam froze immediately when the door opened. His dead brother stood there, not a single sign of the Hellhounds’ mouling, not a sign of his scars from former injuries either.
Sam mimicked his brother and leaned back against the wall. “Neither do I.” Sam replied, agreeing with his brother.
But Dean was still only a human and had to pull back to catch his breath. Instead, Dean let his forehead rest against Castiel’s and their noses rub together. “I love you.” Dean whispered and paused. “Idiot.” He added affectionately, earning a chuckle from Castiel.
Dean shook his head and turned to smile at him tiredly. “Can’t sleep. My brain won’t shut up and Hell keeps haunting me.”
Castiel rubbed his eyes as he answered, “Angel banishing sigils are not fun.” He explained and dropped his hand to lay his arm around Dean’s shoulders.
Cold claws of horror and fear clutched Dean's flesh in a tight grip as he heard the nonchalant tone in Sam's voice and the suggestion. All he could do was nod, agreeing on using Ruby until she became rotten.
Anna came forward the two men and she stared at Dean with wide hazel eyes. “And you're Dean. The Dean?” She asked quietly.
“Yeah.” Sam answered softly before his voice grew hard. “What you and Cas have is no different than what Ruby and I had. You’re also having sex with a non-human being!”
"Little early for that, isn't it?" Anna commented on Dean's flask.
Anna took a shuddering breath. “The end… is coming. The Apocalypse.” She answered, reluctantly.
“Without it’s grace.” Dean pointed out.
“Later, idiot.” Dean answered and watched as Castiel disappeared with the flutter of his big wings.
Out on the balcony, Dean stood, leaning against the railing. The city view wasn't much to look at, instead Dean just enjoyed the sound of the wind, cars and people; the sounds of being alive on Earth. He had his eyes closed and took deep breaths, meditating, as he mindlessly twirled the ring around his left ring finger.
Dean continued examining the hex bags in his hands before muttering a quiet, “Thanks.” He was a little bummed that he didn’t have his grace so he could make sure the bags were safe. He turned to look at Anna and handed her one of the hex bags. “Don’t lose this.” He commanded before taking on a softer voice. “So, what’s playing on the angel radio? Anything useful?” He asked.
“‘Or we hurl Dean back to damnation’.” Anna finished and watched as Sam’s expression morphed into one of horror.
Normally, Castiel would have ignored the politeness of knocking and teleported into the house, but from experience Castiel knew he should knock when it came to Balthazar and Ariel. He had walked in on them in… compromising positions more than a few times.
So Dean wasn’t surprised when he quickly stood up from his chair, letting it fall to the floor with a thud as he slammed the book closed.
Season 14's finale was unnexpected. Though, it's great material for this story.
Dean nodded and handed Bobby back the full glass of whiskey trudged his way over to the stairs. “Night, Bobby.” The Winchester called over his shoulder, voice still quiet so Sam didn’t hear and didn’t wake up. Dean made his way up the stairs and into the bedroom he had claimed as his own during the times he had been there while Sam was at Stanford.
“Anna?” Sam questioned and walked towards Missouri and Anna by the bed on cautious feet.
Sam chuckled at his brother’s overprotectiveness of the Impala. “I got her. She’s fine.” He answered, using female pronouns as his brother always insisted the Impala was a
“So, you talk to angels?” Dean asked with raised eyebrows. His heart started thudding in his chest. Could this be Anna, his own sister?
3 minutes later, Bobby sent him a reply.
Castiel informed.
“Because it comes from Heaven, that makes it just.” Uriel replied, voice growing more annoyed for each minute.
“Easy there, asshat.” Dean said and held out his hand to stop the angel. “Okay, I know she's wiretapping your angel chats or whatever, but it's no reason to thank her.”
Meanwhile, Castiel stepped closer to the younger Winchester. He didn't want to hurt his future brother-in-law (kind of), but he knew what Heaven expected of him and knew he had to protect Dean's true identity.
“I don’t?” Sam replied, raising his eyebrow slightly. “Us humans, we’re a bunch of… miserable bastards… Eating, crapping, confused, afraid.”
Sam sighed heavily, mirroring Anna’s actions. “Dean doesn’t ‘like’ the angels. In fact he’s voiced his anger, distrust and frustrations several times. But…” He explained, but paused for a second. “Cas pulled him out of Hell, saved him, so Dean automatically trusts and likes him. They’re currently dating.” Sam added as an afterthought.
Castiel shook his head. “It’s too dangerous. You said it yourself, the highest ranking demons know what the seal is. That means they can break it the moment the rest are broken.”
Anna released a loud and shrill scream of fright. “He’s gonna kill me!” She screamed.
Dean shivered and tensed at what Castiel vaguely had referenced. Ariel and Balthazar was known amongst the angels for their wild sex life. Several orgies, weird kinks and fetishes, exotic positions; just the wildest sex in general. To think that Castiel had picked up on some of that made a thrill shoot through Dean’s body as well as a hint of dread. He loved the innocent Castiel, the one who was so shy during sex, always afraid to hurt.
Uriel scoffed when his eyes fell on the archangel-turned-hunter, the corner of his lips tugging up in a half-smile. "Look at that." The angel spoke in fake awe. "It's so cute when monkeys wear clothes."
But the good mood didn't remain for long, Samandriel timidly spoke up and asked, “Jensen, are you, uh, ever gonna get your grace back?”
(9226 words)
Dean had asked about what Sam had been up to since he went to Hell, but Sam skillfully deflected the question by talking about a memory from before he left for Stanford.
Sam groaned. “Fine.” He agreed and got up from his chair and went up the stairs to his bedroom.
"I know." Dean replied, shocking the angel. "She's responsible for the death of many human lives, as well as a handful of angels. I know she ripped out her own grace to escape prison."
Dean snapped out of his anger at Anna’s explanation of removing her grace and looked at her with furrowed eyebrows. It had hurt when Michael cut his grace out, but nothing like what Anna described -- which Dean had experienced while he was in Hell, having his inner organs cut out with a blunt knife. Though ripping one’s own grace out with their bare hands probably would be more painful than a clean cut through the throat.
“Well, thanks.” Dean smiled slightly. At least no one got hurt. “Can you take me there?” Dean asked. He wasn’t sure he could make it to the gas station without passing out from dehydration.
Dean took a sip and smiled at the sweet taste mixed in with the bitterness of the rum. He nursed the drink for a minute in silence before he heard someone come up behind him.
. Dean looked between Alastair and the angel. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to stay down in Hell with Alastair or leave Hell to get back to Earth and be the Righteous Man. It sounded like a lot of work, but also like a huge honor.
Dean looked at the red-haired woman he was sure was his sister. “Are you okay?” He asked her carefully.
Niki, Paul, Freddie, Stan, Alan, Kim and Marilyn had all been friends of Dean when he was in Heaven, in one way or another. And Dean, who was an introvert and very shy and antisocial before he fell, he had a hard time getting friends. So the few that he had, like Tessa, Samandriel, Ariel and Balthazar, and, of course, Castiel, he held close. So the loss of 7 friends had been pretty hard on him.
Sam bitterly thought.
Sam scoffed and looked at the angels in disbelief, especially Castiel. “You are some heartless bastards, you know that?” He growled lowly.
Sam rubbed his eyes and frowned up at him. “We have an apocalypse to stop, dude. You don’t have time to go out.” Sam objected.
Castiel gave a them both a second to let the information sink in before he added, “One good thing is that he actually has a plan on how to stop the Apocalypse. A classic, dumbass, Jensen plan.”
Castiel looked over to Dean and moved closer, meant for both comfort to his fiancé and also protect him.
“The day I got out of Hell.” Dean spoke and gave Sam a glare. So much for coincidences.
It looked like Bobby wanted to ask more questions, but Dean cut him off before he could. “Bobby, I’d love to answer all your questions, but I’m exhausted and would very much like to go back to sleep.” Dean confessed, stifling a yawn. After his nightmare, he had been too on edge to go to sleep, but Castiel’s visit had managed to put him at ease enough for him to be tired again.
Dean looked at him with an apologetic look. "I'm sorry. I can't let her go unpunished."
An idea sparked in Sam’s head as he thought about it. “Falling, like the way a human eye could see? Like a comet, maybe, or a meteor?” He questioned.
Sam turned back to Ruby and kneeled down next to her. "You okay?" He asked.
“Just stay here, okay?” Dean ordered the red-haired woman before turning to the demon in the room. “Keep an eye on her.” He harshly growled, before leaving the basement and quickly climbed up the stairs to reach Sam in the living room.
Sam felt himself paling in realization. “That demon, Alastair, he was your torturer?” Sam asked, though it wasn't really a question.
“What? It’s true. I gripped your soul and dragged your ass out of Hell.” Castiel said innocently, though a mischievous glint in his eyes told Dean he was doing it on purpose.
"So," Dean spoke. "What do ya got?"
Once again, Anna’s words caught Dean’s attention. When he was reborn, he didn’t remember a single thing about his past life. So why did Anna? Dean also couldn’t hear the angel radio, nor could he use telekinesis, or see demons’ true faces -- apart from when he was piercing the veil as he was about to be pulled into Hell by the hellhounds. Why was Anna different? Shouldn’t it have been the other way around? Dean had the stronger grace after all.
Dean licked his lips, to no avail. His tongue was as dry as sandpaper, his mouth completely parched. Come to think of it, his body felt weak from dehydration and starvation. “You don’t have any water and food with ya, by any chance?” Dean asked the angel.
Sam quickly continued before Dean could respond. “And if you ever announce you were born as a girl and you're a transsexual man, I'd accept you. Even though it would've impossible for you to hide it from me while we were growing up. And the same goes if you ever announce you want to change genders! I mean, it would take some time getting used to it, but I'd be happy either way. As long as you're happy.”
I'm sorry if you like Pamela, but since I hadn't introduced her earlier I instead had Missouri. Plus, I love Missouri and was so happy when she returned in season 13.
Dean hummed in response as he straightened the blue tie around Castiel's neck. “Wish I had studied the seals more.” Dean mumbled in response. He looked up to Castiel’s eyes through the darkness and frowned slightly. “I was never meant to have a part in the Apocalypse. Only Michael, Lucifer and Gabriel were supposed to. Me and Raphael was just supposed to watch from the sidelines and we had orders to not interfere, and it’s the only order I ever followed. So I never studied about the Apocalypse as I found it unnecessary and no one ever told me anything.” Dean stated quietly in a sad voice.
“Sam… I’m sorry.” She apologized with a sad look in her eyes.
“So it’s like sex?” Dean responded with a raised eyebrow and unimpressed face. Sam shrugged, but the look in Sam’s eyes had Dean cringing. “Really? You and Ruby? She’s a demon, Sam!”
In Texas, Dean was staying at Ariel and Balthazar’s house, spending time with his siblings. Tessa and Samandriel had joined them when they found out that Dean was staying there.
“Regrettable?” Dean questioned his fiancé with a raised eyebrow
Dean smiled almost sadly. "I doubt it." He spoke, thinking of how much he didn't want to be an angel himself.
Sam sighed and looked down at the floor. “I tried, Dean, I really did. But… I couldn’t stop.” Sam explained, watching how Dean raised his head to study the younger Winchester with firm eyes. “It’s like an addiction, like an itch I have to scratch or else I go crazy with need.”
Missouri softened her voice as much as he could. “Calm down…” She whispered and glanced at the brothers in case she needed help, to make sure they were prepared to rush over to help.
Dean whipped his head to look at his brother and the demon next to him. “What?” He growled. “Sam, you promised-”
“Oh, no. No, no way. Um, they probably don't even know I exist. I just kind of... overhear them.” She explained with a small shrug.
Then, Dean took a trip to 1973 and after seeing Mary make the deal with Azazel, Dean hadn’t been in the mood for any research on the Apocalypse, even though Castiel had given them Dean’s old Enochian books. Instead, Dean pulled Sam along on hunts.
Sam, on the other hand, became more curious. “What kind of specialist? What are you gonna do?” He asked, verging on worried and panicked.
Alastair sauntered over to his student, tilting the younger’s chin up so he could see the young man in the eyes. The former green eyes were clouded with black, dark but not complete. The white eyed demon leaned down to brush his lips against the younger man’s. “Listen now, little one,” Alastair breathed against Dean’s lips. “Angels are coming. And they’re gonna try and take you away from me.”
Castiel flinched slightly, reminded that he had found his free will and could feel all the emotions humans could feel -- but more muted than humans' emotions. "Still, we have history. It's just--" He tried to speak, but Anna cut him off.
Dean tried to control his feelings of shock and happiness as he was in public, but knew he wasn't doing a very good job.
It had been one of the reasons Michael tried to kill Dean.
Inside the gas station it was messy, things dropped on the floor as the people there probably just had dropped all their things. Dean stepped over a few bottles of soda and made his way to the fridge the drinks were stored in and pulled out a bottle. He gulped it down quickly, almost choking on it.
“Gonna get Anna to Bobby's and get her safe in the panic room.” Dean said and whirled around to glare at his brother. “I trust you to get Baby there
“Ruby came back for me… I guess that's why I trusted her. And the fact that she managed to get through to me, just like to.” Sam explained and offered Dean a tired smile.
I wrote the last part while half asleep, so I apologize if it sounds weird.
both Dean and Sam swear a lot in this chapter
Bobby stared at the angel, calculating, before he nodded in acceptance. “Your brother knows?” Bobby asked Dean with a raised eyebrow.
Castiel glared at him, as if he didn’t need the reminder. Then he sighed. “We don’t know what the last seal is yet. Maybe we can stop Lucifer from rising and the curse of the Winchesters won’t take hold.” Castiel thought out loud. “And since you have your memories and knowledge from before you fell, then you know where the archangel blade is. If Lucifer rises, then we can kill him instead.”
Dean was quiet for a second before he nodded. “Yeah. But not all of it, enough to allow me angelic vision so I can see angels and demons and their true form.” A small smile tugged at Dean’s face. “It’s weird, feeling and being aware of how the nature acts. I can feel an oak tree in Europe losing it’s leaves, a snowstorm winding up in Antarktis. It feels like some weird drug trip.”
Dean chuckled manically. “Michael is just as bad as Lucifer! In fact, he’s worse! If Michael wins, he’s going to kill half of humanity and use the rest as his slaves and pets. Lucifer is merciful and will at least kill everyone and spare them from torment.” Dean sighed heavily, the anger at his two oldest brothers fading.
Anna looked up from the floor and into Dean’s eyes, her own still filled with shame, but also burning with defiance. “I didn’t kill that man because he was human. And God told us to love humanity as much as we loved him, and I
Castiel looked to the red-haired woman. "Hello, Anna. It's good to see you." He said in a voice that sounded fake and sarcastic.
Dean sighed.  Castiel was impossible. Turning away from his fiancé of 120 years, Dean looked to Sam. “This is the angel who got me out of Hell and told me about Heaven’s plans for me.”
“But... wouldn’t you want your grace back?” Balthazar asked with a devastated look on his face. He wanted his big brother back, grace, wings and all powers, the whole package.
Dean shrugged in response. “Well, yeah. The Dean, I guess.” He answered with a weak and nervous chuckle.
A wide and wicked grin covered the attendant’s face. “I know.” He answered before his eyes flicked to black. “I’m downright kissable. Shh now.” He hissed as he stepped forward the panicking girl and the frozen doctor.
Pulling himself together, Dean entered the motel. It seemed fairly clean and cozy. But Dean knew looks could betray. A teenage girl stood behind the check-in counter, heavily tattooed and pierced, looking like she'd rather be anywhere but there.
“Until now.” Dean continued and crossed his arms. “So, what’s she hiding?” He asked, looking at the younger with a raised eyebrow.
With a tired look, Anna answered him. “His destiny said he was gonna kill a lot of people, never specified how many. And destinies can be changed.” She explained. “You destiny was changed; you were destined to become the Boy King of Hell. But you didn’t, because Dean helped you change your destiny.”
Before Sam could comment on his brother's fear and nervousness, the barn door opened with a blast and Castiel and Uriel entered. Dean smiled at the sight of his fiancé, feeling slightly comforted just by the sight of him. Castiel responded with a weak smile himself that only Dean managed to notice.
Panic crept up on Sam. “Dean!” Sam yelled. Using his shoulder, he started to break the door down. The door swung open and Sam stumbled inside.
Castiel -- having picked up on Dean's love and sympathy for family-- apologized when the red-haired woman came up to him, "I'm sorry."
Danielle, the waitress, smiled and wrote down his order in her notepad. “How would you like your coffee?” She asked, pink lips curled in a smile.
Dean scowled. “You just cut me with a silver blade! If I were either, you would’ve known!”
"You're stealing my best line." He smirked.
“It’s alright, Anna.” Missouri continued to reassure the young red-haired woman.
Sam shrugged. “It's above my pay grade, man.” Sam answered in a low voice.
Sam smiled despite the unease he felt for the demon and answered, “Yeah, well, we’ll muddle through. We always do.”
The room was modern, lots of glass and sharp edges, black and white and grey and silver colors. It was comfortable, and the sheets of the bed were soft and Castiel groaned as he was lowered onto the mattress.
Dean frowned as he looked at the door, the honeymoon suite. 207 stood inside a red heart. Pulling himself together, he firmly knocked on the door. He heard Sam moving around inside as Dean waited, looking around the decorated hallway.
Anna immediately shook her head. “Look,” She said, “I get it. You think I’m nuts. If I were you, I’d think I was nuts. But it’s all
“Dean.” Sam whispered and pointed his gun at the figure he saw hiding behind one of the bigger decorations. “Anna?” He questioned softly, and a head of red hair peeked out from behind the big decoration. She nodded silently, showing that the name belonged to her. Both Sam and Dean lowered their guns when they had the young woman’s identity confirmed. “We’re not gonna hurt you. We’re here to help you. My name is Sam. This is my brother, Dean.”
When Ruby disappeared after one final glare at Dean, Sam looked at Dean with wide and worried eyes. Dean looked back up at him and Sam watched as the madness in them faded into exhaustion and sorrow. “At least tell me you aren’t drinking demon blood.” Dean begged and Sam was caught off guard by the cheer look of being done in Dean’s eyes, almost begging for being done with everything, life as well.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. My father would be indifferent if Dean was a male or female. Mistranslations caused the bible to be like it is, several things are wrong, including the fact that God is against same-sex relationships.” The angel responded. “And as I don’t really have a gender because I’m an angel, technically this isn’t a same-sex relationship. Though I have a male vessel and I identify as a ma-”
“You are my light,” Castiel clarified. “But you’re also a nerd. I mean, I don’t know of anyone between Heaven, Hell and Earth that has the knowledge of angels, demons, spells and sigils quite like you.”
Dean looked at Sam with panicked eyes and the younger Winchester caught his drift. As Dean opened the motel door, Sam stood so that most of the room wasn't visible through the small opening.
The maid just responded calmly. “Sir, I've got clean towels.”
, the nickname Dean had given Castiel shortly after they met in 1483, coming from the fact that Castiel was younger, shorter and had smaller wings than Dean. If Dean still had his wings, that is. He had them cut off by Lucifer a few years before the older archangel was banished to the cage.
“Ah, Cassie! Haven’t heard from you since we pulled Winchester out of Hell. What’s up?” The angel asked. He opened the door and Castiel was grateful to see he was wearing a pair of sweatpants.
Dean nodded and loosened his tight grip on Castiel’s body so the angel could move. The angel leant down and touched the freshly turned dirt of the ground. The ground shook and pieces of dirt floated into the air, lifting away from the hole to Dean’s earthly grave.
Which brought Sam and Dean to Halloween. A man choked to death on razor blades, turned out to be two witches trying to make the demon Samhain rise for the first time in 600 years. 3 sacrifices over 3 nights, the fourth being the rising itself. Then Castiel and Uriel appeared in Sam and Dean’s motel room, telling them the rising of Samhain is one of the 66 seals.
Ruby took a deep breath before she continued, ignoring Dean. “Girl named Anna Milton escaped from a locked ward yesterday. The demons seem pretty keen on finding her. Apparently, some real heavy hitters turned out for the Easter-egg hunt.” She spoke.
Oh, and BTW; in this chapter we find Sam.
Anna looked uncomfortable and suspicious in Ruby’s presence. Her hazel eyes stared at the demon, squinting angrily, but looked up when Sam and Dean entered the cabin.
Sam shook his head in anger and continued. “Anyways, I ask her if she can save you and she says no. So I kick her out of the car and the fact that her meat suit was still alive also spiked some anger. So the next day, she comes back and is possessing a comatose girl whose spirit is gone. And she tells that while she can't bring you back, she can get me Lilith. I figured it was the next best thing. So I was ready to do it. She-”
Dean cleared his throat and took a step away from the blue-eyed man and felt his body tense in nervousness. “Bobby, this is Castiel. The angel who got me out of Hell.” Dean introduced his fiancé to his surrogate father.
So my older sister joined AO3. So if you're reading this, whaddup Laurel (*cough* Asshole *cough*)!
Instead of Anna answering, Missouri did, reading off of both Anna and Dean’s experiences. “She fell from Heaven, to Earth. Became human.”
Taking Castiel, drunk as a skunk, to Bobby’s would probably not have been the best thing. There was a chance Castiel would blurt out the fact of their relationship and of Dean’s true biology. And Dean wasn’t ready to tell them about either. Not because he was ashamed of having a male fiancé, but because he would have to tell them he was an angel and not really their family, which would probably hurt them as much as the betrayal would.
Sam jumped in surprise at Dean’s silent appearance. “Uh, Missouri’s preparing a hypnosis. She believes she can reach deep into Anna’s subconsciousness and make her tell us whatever she’s ‘guilty’ of.” Sam answered.
(Now back to your regular scheduled program)
At the mention of his destiny as the Boy King, Sam felt shame ignite in his body, ashamed of the demon blood that had been coursing through his veins since he was six months old.
But before he could, he watched Sam use his psychic powers to exorcise a demon, having been lead to the warehouse by Castiel who had been keeping an eye on where Sam goes everytime he leaves. Dean’s blood had frozen and his breath had gotten stuck in his throat.
Once he caught his breath and stopped coughing, Dean looked around. There was no sign of Castiel. “Cas?” Dean called out in a hoarse and weak voice.
Castiel smiled down at the ground with a fond smile. The floating pieces of dirt were thrown to the side, out of the way for Castiel’s digging. It looked less glamorous being thrown to the side than it was when the grace was wrapped around it.
Dean smirked, but it felt fake and strained. "Yeah, of course." He responded, but it felt fake and strained.
None of them would fight in Heaven’s army and therefore they were weak. And the weak
"Who was that?" Sam asked, having expected Castiel to be the angel who took him there.
Ruby watched them from the window of the barn, jealousy coiled in her stomach. She huffed angrily before she left the barn for the crossroads, using the darkness of the night as her cover.
"Why?" Sam asked with a devastated look.
“The angels said you were guilty of something. Why would they say that?” Sam asked in a gentle voice.
“You shouldn’t steal the money.” Castiel said with a frown. “You can take the food and drinks, that can be replaced, but the clerk worked hard for the money.”
Sam looked at his older brother and saw the calculating green eyes. “Look, maybe we should check it out.” He suggested.
Anna didn’t know how to reply; the fact that the youngest archangel not only knew she was free from Heaven’s jail, but also knew what she looked like. “Dean was smart to leave. I don’t blame him. In fact, you should do the same thing.” She said in a shocked voice.
The hunter chuckled as his mind flashed to Dean before shaking off the thought and focused on the red-head in front of him.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I don’t have powers! All I can do is see angels and demons’ true faces! And I’m not going to become corrupted because of it!” Dean yelled, frustrated with the whole situation.
Sam sighed heavily and tiredly leaned back against the wall. “We are so screwed. All of Heaven and Hell wants you and it’s the three of us, plus Ruby, against several demons and angels, all of them more powerful than us.” He complained.
Ruby nodded with a over-dramatic shrug. “Alright. That just narrows it down to the entire state.” She sarcastically remarked.
“Sam?” Anna’s quiet voice questioned. “Not Sam Winchester?”
“Were you even going to tell me about your powers? About how you can exorcise
“Come again?” Sam questioned, bringing Dean back from his thoughts.
Sam huffed. “I noticed you disappearing some nights and came back the next morning, but you weren’t smelling like alcohol like you used to do when you spent the night getting drunk and laid. So, one night I decided to follow you, to see what you were up to. I saw you meeting Castiel at a bar and then taking him to a motel room and the noises coming out of the room a couple minutes later explained pretty well what was going on.” Sam admitted in a quiet voice.
“I had forgotten how beautiful it is.” Dean commented, eyes still glued to the levitating dirt. “To be fair, I had forgotten everything about my life as an angel.” Dean added with a shrug.
And then to another problem: I have my summer holiday in about a month and a half, and I don't  have any internet at home, meaning I can't publish chapters unless I go somewhere. So I can write my chapter in docs but I can't publish them. And it will probaly become a mass publishing when it comes to publishing chapters, like 5 each time.
Dean ignored the demon and made sure Sam was okay before he rushed to the back room to get Anna.
Ruby straightened her back, but still remained over a head shorter than Sam. “I'm just delivering the news. You can do whatever you want with it. Far as I'm concerned, I told you, I'm done.” She declared before she turned on her heel and set route for the exit.
Dean winced at the thought of hellfire and torture. “I’d rather let Hell stay right where it belongs; in Hell.” Dean answered, tiredly.
Anna's hands shot to her sides as her eyes grew wide in alarm. “They're coming.” She rushed out in a whisper.
Sam's brows furrowed together in question at Dean's answer. “You know, ever since you got back from Hell, you've seemed… smarter. I mean, you know hell of a lot more about angels than what I do.” Sam commented.
Anna answered with a small nod. “Yes.”
“I don’t know.” Anna smirked. “There’s loyalty… forgiveness… love.” She retold the things that made her want to become a human.
Castiel held out his hand for Sam to shake. Sam looked at him before glancing up at Dean who nodded. Sam and Castiel shook hands. “Who are you?” Sam asked as he let go of Castiel’s  hand.
Behind Dean, Alastair stood and watched his best apprentice. He was a quick learner, Alastair had only needed to show him once before he could do it himself.
Castiel said and gestured to Dean’s body which was covered in sweat and saliva, and his own release from the night before.
But the psychiatrist wasn’t letting it go. “What were you trying to warn them about?” Julia asked softly, urging Anna to answer.
Balthazar pulled Castiel back and held him at arm's length. “Cas, things are obviously going to be different, but if you try hard enough and spend enough time on it, you will grow back together. You still love him, dontcha?” With Castiel’s small but firm nod, he continued. “And Jay is obviously going to be different. He’s spent 30 years as a human, as Dean Winchester. And Dean Winchester is very different from the Jensen we both know and love. But with his memories back, maybe he will become more like Jensen again. A mix of the Righteous Man and the angel of family.”
Bobby and Sam stood in the doorway, Bobby aiming a handgun right at Dean’s head and Sam trying to make him put the gun down with bags of food and beer in his hands. “Bobby! It’s him! It’s Dean!” Sam stopped Bobby by grabbing the gun from the old hunter’s hold. “I’ve already done the tests, it’s really him.” Sam continued in a softer voice, though panic was clear in his eyes.
When Uriel left, Castiel turned to Dean with a small smile. "Long time, no see." He said.
Dean remained silent, but threw a glance at Sam, looking away as he saw the horrified look on his face. “Can you promise me you’ll stop? If not for yourself, then for me?” Dean asked softly as he looked down at his hands as he wrung them together.
Sam looked around the living room and realized he couldn’t see nor hear the old hunter anywhere in the house. “Where’s Bobby?” He asked.
Sam ended up breaking the silence when he asked, “Dean said something about you refusing to kill a man which resulted in the death of thousands, millions even. Why didn’t you kill him if you knew he was gonna kill people?"
Sam looked up and raised an eyebrow. “For what?” He questioned, confused as to why Anna would thank him when he didn’t find her grace.
