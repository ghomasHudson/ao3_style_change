"Okay?" Sherlock says slowly as he fights the urge to close his eyes under the soothing touch.
Quite unexpectedly, he wasn't the one to give in to his urges. John was the one to move closer and put his arms around him. Sherlock sighed as he buried his nose in John's soft hair. John's smell, voice, and body all filling his senses and comforting him in the most intimate way imaginable.
"You know, I was wrong to tell my boys to get me a toe. I should have asked for that sharp tongue of yours to be cut off, pretty boy"
"Hello" Sherlock said
Cycling to work every day was not the safest, and definitely not the most practical, idea in a city like London, yet John did it every day. He needed this small rush of adrenaline every morning.  He needed to feel his muscles working and the cold air hitting his face before he could dive into endless chaos of his regular work day. This morning was exceptionally satisfying. John felt the heat as his muscles worked at maximum capacity, avoiding cars and maneuvering through traffic.
John smiled and kissed him again deeply.
But Sherlock's face was passive, and he stared back at John with the same sorrowful expression… now almost apologetic, and John suddenly felt cold all over.
He chained the bike outside Bart's and walked in. After changing quickly into his scrubs. He headed to the OR and was quickly handed a file and steered to look at an x-ray.
"Yes"
"Okay I'd like to run some tests next time you're in. The last thing I want is to be administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it."
Sherlock bent down to inspect the two bodies, and John stood mesmerized for a moment before he remembered he was supposed to be having a conversation with the man.
"He doesn't… I mean… I don't care. I just needed to make sure they don't get lost in this damn maze." He ran a gloved hand through his hair nervously.
John looked at Greg's face searchingly "Do you know about…"
"And don't forget you are not allowed to whine while we're here. We came to have a fun Halloween." John added as he took a turn between the dense trees.
"John, while I'm flattered, I think you should know…"
"Evidently. Off a train?"
Thanks to whoever's reading, enjoy your day. Love.
"But you can feel me… You felt me" Sherlock felt like he was drowning, desperately reaching for something to grasp in the cold water.
"Dr. Watson is not in today. You'll have to call his office. Someone there can help you."
I'll wander mazily over all the earth, asking,
A quick shower and a cab ride later, he is standing over two bodies in the back of a dingy old pub somewhere in Peckham.
"Harder" He commanded, and John complied. He started pounding so hard into Sherlock, the thin pale body was being pushed slightly up the bed with every thrust. He was obscenely loud, moaning, and calling John’s name in unabashed pleasure
"Go ahead" Sherlock smiled as he knew the best part of the case was about to be revealed. "Tell us why you can't possibly be him. You have proof, don't you? Go ahead, say it."
Everyone sighed in clear relief except Rupert himself.
"I found you, John. I found you"
"You don't want to believe me"
Again, Sherlock slaps himself mentally and prepares to deliver the usual speech.
"Fine. So, you're working again, then?"
"All right." John said "Can we just… Let's see if we can just stand still together for 5 minutes"
"Are you admitting that you murdered your wife?" John asked.
"Tell me how it feels. Describe it"
For a moment, Sherlock is tempted to go back there, but then he remembers the fresh fingers waiting for him in his fridge.
"But is it worth it? I mean prisoners don't have much money after all"
"So, this is the great Sherlock Holmes we've been reading about in your blog, huh?" Bill said as he shook Sherlock's hand enthusiastically.
True, they were only flat mates, best friends as John put it, nothing more, but Sherlock had grown used to having John close all the time. He just couldn't risk spending three potentially tedious days at home without him. Also, he actually quite liked complaining to John and driving him insane. Bickering was one of their favorite activities together.
"I just hope you won't be too famous to talk to us soon!" Bill joked and the group laughed and teased Lidiya some more.
Then, when he opened his eyes again, Sherlock was there.
"Simple. The room next to ours was Lidiya's, and it was vacant. He used it to get out on the balcony and get to our room's window. He then simply went out the window and back to Lidiya's room and rejoined everyone with deep concern on his face. No one noticed he was late as I was unconscious and everyone was sleepy and confused."
"The window." Bill said, pointing at the bottom of the glass, where a clean circle had been cut just near the lock switch. The window was wide open and was letting in cold wind and sporadic drops of rain.
Mycroft didn't look back as he answered, but kept staring at the birds flying in circles around the gothic building.
*****
Greg paused but John didn't say anything, he was busy inspecting the couple's wedding photographs on the wall and a small collection of DvD's stored in a box on the shelf.
"Oh god!" Rupert screamed, "The bandaged man must have cut the line! We need to leave now! I'm not staying here waiting to be butchered by that freak!" He wailed and just like that, turned around and ran away.
"Absolutely. Put him through." John answered quietly and with a practiced motion took out his phone's battery and shoved it in his the pocket of his jacket.
"Must be the needles. Never really got used to them."
Suddenly, a loud, blood-chilling scream came from ahead. Sherlock's legs moved before his brain even began to analyze what was happening. It was undoubtedly Susan's voice, and something was wrong. He shivered as fat drops of rain started falling lazily on his face, his whole body working to get to John.
"Smile, Archie!" Molly said as she took a photo with one of those vintage Polaroid instant cameras. She was snapping pictures left and right and showing them to everyone, announcing that "No one takes real photos anymore!"
"Shit, Sherlock, he's seen us."
Sherlock manages to always look gorgeous, but right now he simply looks radiant in a fitted suit and a purple shirt tailored within an inch of its life. John sighs as he takes in the startling amount of beauty.
"Oooh this is good"
"I don't understand"
They both smiled at Sherlock, eliciting a massive eye roll on his part. "What else would I have done?" He caught a glimpse of what Bill had in his pocket and paused halfway through the sentence. "What do you have there, Bill?" he asked.
"Mike. I will."
The smirk turned into a snicker as the man answered
"No, sir, I do not know where he is."
Mike turned at the sound and looked at Sherlock in confusion
"This is incredible" he whispered
"It didn't end well."
"Patrick and Jennifer Wilson. They were the second couple. Married a little over a year too" he said in a strained voice.
"Oh, no. not you too, Watson, is the freak hypnotizing every officer I know?" Donovan rolled her eyes at him.
"Are you sure the killer is not just making you think he's an outsider? Just use your brains a little. You thought he went inside our room after he climbed a tree, used a glass cutter, and sneaked in through the window. And yet the floor was spotless afterwards. He did not drag a speck inside, did he?"
For a moment, Sherlock just stare at him. Then, he realizes he is talking about Sholto.
They fall silent for a bit, sipping on their drinks. Soft music fills the big hall, and some people head to the dance floor.
He then felt John slide sown his mouth Sherlock’s body, getting dangerously close. Greg almost lost his concentration when John’s head was right above his, his mouth inches from Greg’s, as he started sucking Sherlock’s cock. Greg's hand went back into his pants and resumed jerking his cock.
"What is this?"
Mike took a piece of gauze and started dabbing at Sherlock's brow. White, hot pain pierced through Sherlock, and he winced and instinctively recoiled
"Okay." Sherlock stood up, ready to leave.
"Dying"
John frowned "Tell me what?"
Still, he can't find his pants anywhere. He squints in the faint dawn light and takes another look at the bed, and bloody hell. He can see part of his black pair of pants peeking from under the muscled naked torso of his neighbor, trapped and impossible to retrieve without waking the person trapping it.
"So stand behind me, I am not leaving you in this place." John glared at him until he seemed to relent.
"You're right. How could that be?" Susan said.
Sherlock secretly thought he was unlike the 'others.' They never seemed to be as fascinated as he was by humans and their lives. None of the others spent what felt like eternity observing minute details, gestures, and expressions, let alone trying to guess what people did, thought, or wanted. Sure, if he wanted to, he could steal glimpses into people's minds, hear some of their strongest thoughts and emotions, but he rather liked to draw up the conclusion himself and enjoy little victories whenever he was right, which was almost always.
"I don't have to." he smiled placidly.
He sipped his tea as he skimmed through the medical files of the new arrivals. Nothing unusual. They were all healthy enough to fight and maim each other however they wish inside these walls, except… John stopped at one file. It was the mugshot that drew his attention: A pale face with eyes that could only be described as intelligent. He did not look like the other addicts, thieves, and rapists, if anything he looked posh with those shiny curls. John's eyes slid on the information listed below the picture. The inmate had diabetes type 1, which meant he needed insulin shots on a daily basis.
Sherlock could not will himself to leave John's side all day. Seeing him cheerful was even more brilliant, rendered Sherlock even more entranced.
Sherlock's face went passive and he stared at a point on the wall behind John.
with bitten souls, and mouths bruised with love.
"Yes, you're right of course." Sherlock says, making sure his voice is as even and as neutral as can be "Let's end this now. The sooner the better, so you can get back with your previous… ex-lover."
"What?" Sherlock whispered.
The matter-of-fact tone with which he delivered the sentence combined with his face expression was so endearing it made John burst out laughing. Then he shook his head as he turned to get the insulin shot and the blood glucose meter.
"Lestrade!" John points at him unnecessarily, "Isn't he the coppa that gives you your cases? I've seen you around. You've never told me he's your brother in law, Sherlock!"
He started revising the data at hand. First, he could rule out Susan and Bill, who was with him the moment John was attacked in the forest. Therefore it was one of the three men: Rupert, Max, or Jake. They all knew Lidiya for years and she could have easily given any of them a motive to kill her, but why John? He only met them when he arrived here…
You have a surgery tomorrow; Mr. Lestrade. It's not major, but you're anxious. You have been carrying his file around all day." He pointed at the folder under John's left arm which said Lestrade on the front, and continued "It's got coffee stains on the edge there. You've been reading it and going over the procedure in your head since morning. You're questioning yourself. Something happened earlier at work that made you second guess everything"
"It's going to be fine," John muttered to himself "Just a simple pre-op visit."
Back at the hospital, John took Sherlock to the laboratory. It was a spacious, spotless room with bright white lights. Cupboards covered most of the walls, and a variety of equipment sat on the white tabletops.
“No. I'm one of the doctors here.”
"Aren't you hungry, Sherlock?" she asked
Ache, exhaustion, confusion, excitement, joy, love! John, John, John!
John sat next to Sherlock, as if this was a normal thing to do and did not just fill Sherlock with waves of jubilation.
This seemed to turn into some sort of challenge for Sherlock though. Over the next few days, and every time he came for his shot, he had a new bunch of name choices to badger John about.
"He didn't see you, Sherlock. He can't see you. No one can see you unless you want them to."
"And it's destroying his career. He's ignoring all his other work.
When their lips parted, John realized he wasn't breathing, and he let out a shuddering breath, eyes still closed, and hand still cupped around pale perfection.
He changed into his pajamas too and slipped under the covers. John made a sound between a sigh and a scoff.
"It's the same guy isn't it?" He said, his voice slightly uneven "Tell me I'm not insane. Tell me it's related."
-------
That was all he could say, and he thought of how meaningless that phrase was. "Passed away" as if to make it better and less horrific, as if to indicate he had gone somewhere else rather than ceasing to exist. What was the point? Why couldn't he just say "died?"
"Yeah, yeah. I'll wait for the full version of the tantrum when Lestrade shows up. Now lead the way."
That was too much. He knew too much, and this puzzle was getting less amusing and more suspicious
"Stop it" Sherlock suddenly said, startling Greg out of his thoughts.
John didn't live far, and soon they were standing in front of 221B Baker Street.
Sarah's eyebrows went up
"Anyway, what are you doing here, Mycroft? Don't you have a war somewhere to run?"
"The way I do? What does that mean? You mean the way a doctor does? What?"
"You didn't say the magic word."
"That doctor in the operating room. He looked right at me."
I quoted Lang Leav again in the chapter, just wanted to acknowledge the additional plagiarism.
Eventually, John gave up and told him he could come along as long as he stayed behind him. Fortunately, His Highness conceded.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock felt a delicious tremor run through him as they moved faster, the water around them splashing gently, adding to the composition they were playing with their bodies.
Every thought left Sherlock's mind except for John… John… John. Could he really be with him? Would John be with him if Sherlock sacrifices everything? Descend to Earth, become an immortal, give up all the beauty ha was privy to…
"No" Sherlock said again, seemingly unperturbed at the remark "One of the officers intentionally left his keys behind for the inmates to find. He wanted the riot to intensify so that everyone would assume inmates got to this office and killed this man. Very convenient isn't it? You want to blame your crime on someone else and you have a whole bunch of criminals at your disposal."
"Watson"
"I'm fine. I need to know how he got in." he muttered as he stood up on shaky legs.
"Show me the file of your brother and his wife." Sherlock said, handing the file he already read back to John "They were the first couple weren't they?"
Sherlock has no time to roll his eyes at the weak sexual innuendo, because suddenly, John is there again, his eyes and mouth and neck and arms, all there. Sherlock wonders how he is always so warm, he practically emanates heat, and Sherlock is drawn to it like a kitten seeking the sunlight.
"I am." John struggles to take in the new information. Of all places, and after everything that happened, James has come to work at Bart's!
"The superintendent just called me, he's pretty pissed" Greg said again.
“As a matter of fact, it is. SH”
"Maybe he has a concussion!" a softer voice replied
Through the infirmary's glass door, Jon could see a guard escorting Sherlock into the room. He was now in his prison uniform; a blue shirt and navy blue trousers that were hanging loosely on the narrow hips. He stood by the door staring at John uncertainly, one soft curl partially covering his right eye.
Thanks to everyone who left comments and kudos, and if anyone has a comment, feedback, or just wants to say hi, please go ahead, I love hearing from you guys :)
"That's great Sarah. I'm happy for you" he took her hand in his encouragingly.
"And don't get me started on those jumpers and cardigans too. You do realize you have the taste of a 90 year old, right?"
“He is living. Just not the way you think”
"Yes" Sherlock nodded "He sent me someone to help" he stopped for a moment and closed his eyes again "It hurts, John"
"Detective Inspector Watson, but you can call me John."
Mycroft opened his eyes and turned to Sherlock
"What?"
"Nothing." John sat straight shaking the sleep out of his head "So, are you going to tell me what happened?"
"Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock repeated.
"What have we got?"
“What do you want, baby?” he asked the man beneath him between kisses.
"Very mature." Umbrella man turns to survey John and something glints in his eyes "Though, I must say I am happy you are engaging in less dangerous… recreational activities."
"Hmm?"
"Sherlock, just come to bed, I won't be able to sleep if I'm not sure you're there." John blurted out, his face turning pink. He was worried, and it was finally showing on his face. But amazingly, he seemed to be worried about Sherlock, rather than himself. He wanted to keep an eye on him and Sherlock simply found himself nodding.
Sherlock's face was pale, but it wasn't the gorgeous paleness that always made him glow. He looked ill and malnourished, with small cuts and bruises on his cheek, mouth, and brow.
He tried to clear his head, but all he could do was think of when he would get to see Sherlock again.
He waited as the nurse tied the apron behind his back, feeling Sarah's eyes on him. She had been giving him this assessing look for days now, constantly asking him what was wrong. It set him on edge for some reason.
Sherlock hummed in response, then, remembering something, he scooted closer to John.
John's heart skipped a beat. It was silly, the man was just confused and didn’t mean anything by it.
You are like night, calmed, constellated.
"This isn't how I imagined the reunion would be." Bill said sadly as he handed coffee to everyone.
"So?" his tone came more defensively than he had intended
Then John did something amazing again. He lined up their erections and started moving, still devouring Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's grip became tighter and tighter around John's back as he felt his whole body throbbing with pleasure and need for more.
Let me be calmed, then, calmed by your silence.
"Run" John shouted and Smith bolted through the door leading to the hallway just as the inmates surrounded John, standing between him and the way out. In his head, he pictured the possible scenarios. The only way was the door leading to the office behind him, and inside there was another door, but it was a dead end for all he knew, and they would soon catch up with him. Still, it was his only chance, and his quick reflexes had always got him out of tight corners, even if barely.
"It's okay. It's alright. You're here now" he whispered.
He wanted to explain more, but he found he had to draw in deeper and quicker breathes for a moment
His trail of thoughts was cut when John started waving. Sherlock looked at where John was staring and saw someone standing by the house. They were still too far to make out who it was, but Sherlock could see that the stranger was in a long black cloak and their face was… could it be? Sherlock took quicker steps, squinting his eyes to take a better look. Indeed, the stranger's face was completely covered in bandages, leaving only their eyes. It was silly, Sherlock knew it was just a person who'd possibly had an injury, but there was something wrong… something hostile and blood chilling about the way he lurked there. John seemed to get the same feeling, because he stopped waving and his hand went down slowly as his brow furrowed in confusion.
John huffs out a broken, heartless laugh "I suppose it's my fault that I hoped… well, I hoped…" John shrugs and doesn't finish this sentence either. He keeps leaving his words hanging in the air, unfinished, open and lost on his lips. He looks sad and like a light was blown out in his eyes. Sherlock doesn't know what to do or say.
They walked slowly in the dark hallway leading to the basement where the back-up generator was stored. Sherlock's eyes were fixed on the back of John's head. He had a bad feeling about this, and apparently so did John, because he suddenly stopped and looked at Sherlock, pressing a finger to his lips.
"John, you're not okay. You need a break."
John doesn't get to kiss, or hug, or spoil him like he wishes he could. What he gets is heated nights of mind-blowing sex, moments where his brain cancels everything expect the divine body he is worshipping, and on very rare occasions, milliseconds where Sherlock's beautiful face is so open and fragile after a particularly good kiss, that it melts John's heart.
"If it's not the Yard's least favorite detective inspector for two years in a row" Greg said with a grin both exasperated and amused.
"We need to stay together guys. No more splitting up." Jake said, and they all nodded in agreement and headed downstairs.
"Sherlock"
He slowly lifted his head, eyes gradually adjusting to the faint light slipping through the window. Jefferson Hope was standing by the bed, one gun in his right hand, pointed at John, and another sitting idly in his left hand.
They walked in comfortable silence, their hands occasionally nudging, and Sherlock found himself hopeful again. Maybe John could forgive him after all.
"I bet I can make you."
"Is that your medical opinion?" John gave him his own not-too-pleasant smile.
"Have you guys seen Lidiya? I turned away for a minute and she was gone. I'm really worried she might be lost."
"I didn't know. I saw" Sherlock's face lit up "Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. You favor your right side even though you are clearly left-handed. So, wounded in action, invalided and sent home. Afghanistan or Iraq."
Mike's hand stopped dabbing at the wounds abruptly, and he looked into Sherlock's eyes
"So, what do you think happened?" Sherlock said, standing up straight and looking at John with those piercing eyes.
He felt an invisible force drawing him into the sad eyes. He wanted to stroke the soft hair and hold the trembling hands. Sherlock got closer and listened to the murmur of thought:
How strange. The thought of John taking care of him if he gets sick is comforting and warm. Maybe if he gets sick John would stop staring at his gorgeous ex, who looks like he wants to devour him, and pay attention to Sherlock again. He pauses and wonders when he got so pathetic. It makes him furious at John for some reason.
He opened his eyes and realized the head Sherlock's cock was poking out of his underwear, already wet and slippery, and without thinking he started kissing it slowly.
"Neighbors heard the gunshot."
Mike sighed in resignation and smiled.
"You're not fine. You can't operate like this. It was rescheduled for Monday"
John thought if anyone was allowed whatever experiments they desired to make, it would be his Sherlock. He was intelligent beyond belief, incredibly observant of every little detail. The beautiful brain was somehow unique in every way and absolutely magnificent, and John wondered if it had anything to do with what he once was.
Sherlock felt a persistent need to watch over John, even if he couldn't do more.
Oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach;
"No" he said, his voice coming out hoarse.
"Odd don't you think? And he was hit from behind, do you really think he would have turned his back to a con?" Sherlock asked.
"Come one. Let's get back. It's better if we all stay together until we figure this out." John led the way and they all followed.
She sat on a stool next to him "Remember that position I applied for in Germany? Well, I got an offer" she paused smiling "a really good offer"
"Yeah" Greg sighed and John cringed at the look of sympathy verging on pity that he gave him. "But why are you the only one who sees it?"
"I wasn't born in Scotland"
"I don't know, we were just about to head back to the house because of the rain when he showed up. I thought it was a prank or something."
"What happened to you?
"I could feel her blood, it was so warm and she fell in my arms. I killed her!" Henry said, tears now falling from his dead eyes.
As soon as the haze of lust clears off, the waves of misery close in worse than before. He wraps his arms around himself and racks his brain for an explanation, but before he knows it, the comfort of John's bed lulls him into deep sleep.
"My gun?"
John blinked as he watched Sherlock smile fondly at him "I underestimated you," he said, still smiling "I shouldn’t have thought you wouldn't suspect anything. No, you're too smart"
John turned to Greg again, a strange feeling that something was very wrong growing in his mind.
"Not very long" Greg said, sounding a bit flustered, which was curious. "But I feel like I've known him forever" he added, as if to make up for his clumsy answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are just back from the war, and between an abysmal military pension and this job you must only be able to afford a small flat where you keep a gun around that you constantly handle and even consider using. There is no way someone is visiting you often or else they would notice and do something about it. That said, with your PTSD and trust issue, there is very little chance you'd have met someone and started a relationship with them so soon after getting back."
"- It's so dark right now, I can't see any light around me.
My fair lady…
He leaned across John's lap to retrieve the remote control, only to find himself on the receiving end of a scorching kiss. He wordlessly melted into it, nibbling softly at John's lips before he opened his mouth. He had no idea how much he had wanted this until it started. Moments later, they were both panting as their lips and tongues swirled together in a heated kiss.
"You were dreaming" Sherlock's voice was dulled by the painkillers, though his eyes were sharp as ever
I carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)
"What?"
He claimed John's mouth again and plunged his tongue into it. His orgasm crashed through him like thunder, as he was completely and utterly engulfed by everything John… John… John.
"We can see you" one of the men said, smirking at him now
He wanted him in his bed, under him or above him, to worship and devour his body, not necessarily in that order. The only thing standing between him and that was bloody Sherlock Holmes, who happened to be obsessively in love with the man, who, of course, reciprocated.
John laughed and squeezed Sherlock's hand in his for a moment before they left for NSY.
Heat, so much heat… John Watson is a small ball of fire, sending pleasant warmth into Sherlock's skin. They're a heap of naked bodies on the bed, kissing messily, moaning, and grinding against each other.
"He gave me a choice, and I chose." The trembling voice answered.
"Yes, come on in, love. He's upstairs playing that godforsaken violin of his. Just keep it down boys, I have to be up early tomorrow and I know that old bed upstairs creaks so much."
For some reason, or perhaps for reasons known by all but spoken by none, guards perceived the fresh wave with a predatory look equal to that of old inmates. This was John's first time witnessing the arrival of new men at the prison, as he had only been working there for two months.
"Don't" he said to Hope as he put his left hand on Sherlock's face.
"Morning" Sherlock smiled and snuggled even closer. They lied in each other's arm, taking in each other's warmth for some time.
"And yet you've been spending all your time with him and now you’re solving crimes together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?"
He summoned all the strength in him to lift his hand
He groaned with frustration as he flipped and tossed everything in his office and the infirmary looking for them. His chain had several critical keys, one of which was the key to the infirmary.
"Where were you today?"
The next day, John found himself waiting anxiously for Sherlock's visit. He tried to dismiss it as the natural excitement to meet a smart interesting person in a very unlikely place, but when he saw the curly head peering through the door again, his stomach flipped and twisted. He couldn't remember the last time he felt like this, like a teenager with a crush.
Greg put out his cigarette, and stood up facing the wind. He spread his arms, eyes tightly shut and feet right on the edge "oh, but it's worth it. Feeling this. It's worth it."
"What color were the drugs you took?"
"Sticky" he whispered
(See the end of the chapter for
"Actually, Mike is a great guy. Maybe if you're decent to him…"
"Hey, here they are"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You want proof? You can speak every language, you travel with the speed of thought, you gather at every sunrise and sunset" He stopped and looked Sherlock in the eye.
"Just being here"
He turns around to look at John, who is lying on his back, slightly propped up on his elbows. The sheets have slipped off his body and formed a puddle between his thighs. They only cover his groin, but the delicious V lines leading downwards are visible, maddeningly so.
"But she knew I was there."
"Because I'm in love with you"
"I've known you even longer than I've known Myc, and I've never seen you talk and laugh with someone like you were with that guy."
If you have comments, feedback, or anything to say, please go ahead. I probably should have said this in the beginning but English is NOT my first language, so if it feels like something is wrong then I'm probably thinking in another language. Sorry!
Greg lost all control and in a second, was on his knees. He grabbed Sherlock’s thighs and dragged him down to the edge of the bed until he had the exposed groin close and at the same level as his mouth. Then he wasted no time, and buried his face in the warm dusky skin between his arse cheeks.
"Well, do all your shirts absolutely need to be plaid?"
"Well, it is not about people as much as what makes them the way they are. Every cell, bone, muscle, blood vessel. Every single person is unique and different when it comes to their composition, and therefore every single person heals differently. It is my job to study the details and learn how to help them heal"
Also.. I intentionally made Sherlock younger cause this case would be like a 5 for him.. but maybe a younger Sherlock with less experience would find it harder I guess..
"No" Sherlock shook his head "the doors are electronic and reinforced and the only way to get out is to use one of the officers' keys"
"Arm to stick a needle in."
"I'm not after the drugs. Trust me." Sherlock's expression was solemn for a moment.
"I thought he was a messenger"
Greg tried not to feel thrilled about the prospect of 'next time' but failed. He turned around and left the flat, heart still pounding.
Sherlock was sitting at a table by the edge of the garden. A curly-haired boy that John recognized from the picture Greg had shown him sat next to him and they were both whispering conspiratorially.
So it wasn't a game to John. Maybe, just maybe, the great Sherlock Homes has misread this entire situation.
Again, this is short, but I promise I have interesting plans for next chapter. Hugs to anyone reading <3
It was right before dawn, and London had yet to wake from its slumber
"No. I just need to find him, please."
"Try" John urged.
Oh, this must be what pain feels like. Sherlock's eyes remained closed as he analyzed the different sensations. Sharp nails dug into his right arm and side. He suspected it was because he had been lying on them. There was more. His head felt like it was too full and too hollow at the same time, a dull thud of ache played an agonizing rhythm through his skull,
"It's alright, John." Bill said and looked at the group. They all stared anywhere but each other. Bill continued. "She was part of our group at film school. She was a brilliant writer. She was cheerful and kind, but one day… we found her dead in her dorm room. She had taken her own life, and we never found out why. I keep thinking if we did… we could have helped her somehow."
"Hello"
John rode his bike slowly under the blooming trees, breathing in the morning air, and listening to the rustle of leaves above. He cast subtle looks around, but there was no one in the park at that hour.
(See the end of the chapter for
So, it belonged to someone close, Not your father, this is a young man’s item, brother, then. The encryption says from Clara to Harry… definitely a married couple, but why are YOU wearing it? Since the bracelet was originally owned by Harry then he must be deceased, and considering your obsession with this string of deaths for the past two years, I can deduce Harry and Clara were the first victims… two years ago."
"Turn around, face the other way" John instructed, and Sherlock did, suddenly understanding what John wanted, and feeling his heart beat even faster, and his veins aflame with desire.
A knock on the door was followed by Sarah's delicate face peering into the room, now without her cap and mask. She looked worried but she knew better than to ask what was wrong by now.
When they turned back, the stranger had vanished.
"I guess so," John could not help smiling.
"Yes. Everything he said is true. I killed Lidiya, and yes, it has to do with Amy. That script that Lidiya won the national award for? She stole it from Amy. She stole everything from her and refused to give her any credit, this is why she committed suicide."
"Show me"
(Here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
"I just got a call a prisoner is suffering from heat exhaustion."
Suddenly, he was flat on his back looking at an unfamiliar ceiling. He felt someone drag him inside, and tried to resist and aim a kick at whoever it was until he recognized the pale eyes staring at him. It was Sherlock.
"John!" Sherlock took John's arm and dragged him to the far end of the room, out of everyone's earshot. "When we got here, you walked in on some of the guests in their bedrooms."
"Fine. Work's fine" He remembered he was supposed to answer the question.
"I'm fine"
On the fifth day, Sherlock did not mention any weird and outdated names. He just kept looking at John, eyes repeatedly falling to his mouth. John suppressed a shudder and busied himself with changing the gauze and checking on the wound.
Sherlock discovered the meaning of warmth the moment he felt John's lips on his. Pleasant heat rose in his chest and face as their mouths moved gently. John's fingers were tangled in his hair, and he trapped Sherlock's lower lip with his warm mouth and suckled softly. A small tornado erupted in Sherlock's stomach and he heard himself moan. John let go for a moment and whispered "Sherlock, look at me."
"Wait, Sherlock!" Greg calls.
So, it's PROBABLY gonna be 6 chapters.. so, not too long to go.
"Pleasure." James extends a hand, and Sherlock takes it reluctantly.
"Pick the strawberries out"
Yet something didn't quite make sense to Sherlock. Why would the murderer pass by the window and go around the house into the forest to dump Lidiya's body there? It was as if he'd wanted them to see him for some reason.
"You seem nervous."
"I agree"
Any thoughts anyone? I'm feeling very self-conscious about this one :(
"How did you get here?"
John fought a valiant battle against the temptation to recapture the soft plush lips in his mouth again. He collected himself the best he could and said it again "No"
"What about yours?"
"No. Why do you do that?"
He got up, stood next to Sherlock's chair and leaned down to look at the photos in the file before him.
Sherlock sighs in relief, but John does not stop talking.
"Err…No, Miss…"
At that moment another figure appeared next to Costello
Also.. sorry to any Brit reading this, i'm sure this is super cringe-worthy to you guys, forgive this ignorant non-European who has no idea what she's talking about.
"I don't know." John shook his head "Not that" he shrugged.
"Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand. A what?"
She was still smiling. She had a kind face and two delicate lines around her mouth, as if she had smiled so much it was itched there forever. John's heart was beating erratically, not deciding whether to race in horror, or thud slowly in agony. He had to get the words out, the smiling woman was still staring at him.
"How do you know this?" John managed to utter the words though his heart and mind were racing.
a visit from Mycroft, and then a visit from someone else.
"As I said, you don't really fit my criteria, you're not even married. But I was watching you. I saw you at my flat and I couldn't resist. You looked like you could be worshipping at his feet." He gestured at Sherlock again "It was an absolutely fascinating display. I had to include you in my experiment."
"My patient's wife. She wants me to reassure her. Tell here everything is going to be just fine, and that I have every confidence... and I don't. After all this time, and after all this work, I suddenly have this feeling that none of this is in my hands. Nothing. And if it isn't, what do I do with that?"
"I need to see John Watson, where is he?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes and took John by the arm. They got in a luxurious black car that Mycroft had apparently arranged for them. John planned to ask Sherlock who exactly his brother was and what he did later on. Not now though, all he wanted this moment was to shower and rest with Sherlock by his side and as far from Pentonville as possible.
"No, Sarah, wait. I mean it. Nothing but us"
"Nope. Send him in." John said without breaking eye contact. He relished a trace of trepidation passing through Sherlock's face, but disappearing just as quickly. Huh, it's on then, he thought to himself.
"What's that?" Greg calls from behind.
He paused for a moment and his expression was serious again.
"Oh, no. Every woman you meet is either married or too busy growing tiny humans."
"How is the diet, Mycroft?" It was a feeble blow, but it was all Sherlock had. He refused to blush or fidget nervously in front of Mycroft. Because yes, John has been spending a delightfully unreasonable amount of time at Baker Street with Sherlock over the past ten days, and Sherlock could not have been happier about it.
"The head must have already been severed. After all, the only part of Lidiya we saw when she was being carried was her head. The rest of her body was covered in the cloak… or so we thought, but it wasn't really there. It was already in the woods, so you just had to move the head."
As John was considering how they could break in, Sherlock pushed him aside impatiently, holding what looked like a narrow pin in his hand. He casually picked the lock until it clicked open.
"What?" Sherlock's tone was sharper than intended. The others, who were still engaged in conversation about the murderer turned to him.
"It is hard to remove the smell of gun powder entirely from one's hands, especially if they're constantly '
"What choice? Who gave you a choice Henry?"
"We've got a bunch of overheated cons loud in A-wing."
He laughs and Sherlock's breath catches, because he can't take it anymore. How is he supposed to resist this? He cannot avoid John Watson any more than he can avoid a locked-room triple homicide.
"You shouldn't be too sure of yourself, Watson" Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but he took off his t-shirt and pushed down his pants all the same. John was just in a pair of boxer shorts, and Sherlock wasted no time in pushing them down too.
Sherlock noticed that the window's lock switch was off. Why would the intruder open it if he smashed the glass to get in, unless of course he opened it, got outside, and then smashed the glass towards the inside of the room to make it look like he came from outside. It was only further confirmation of his theory, but he needed more. He peered outside to take a look at the wooden railing, and he found two deep grooves in the wood.
"Do what?"
Sherlock knows John loves to tease him, but he just can't admit how much it turns him on, because it also makes him furious.
Sherlock goes cold all over. He leans back, causing John's hand to slip from his face and hang in the air, frozen and unsure. He stares at John, unable to believe how much the words hurt. Apparently, he miscalculated, overlooked the danger, but he should have known. He swallows against the lump in his throat.
They ascended the stairs to the second floor, hauling their bags with them. Several doors were lined up along the aisle. John distractedly opened the first one and peered inside, only to back off immediately, ears pink and shooting apologies at whoever was in there. Sherlock watched in amusement as John turned to the second door and opened it as well. Again, he backed off, apologizing, but he was less embarrassed this time.
John's eyes were soft as his hand brushed Sherlock's palm gently. They locked eyes and for a moment, they were the only ones there, drawn into one another and connected. Each of them peering into the other's thoughts like his own. They didn't have to say anything. It was well understood by now that neither could live without the other, and watching someone attempting to take John's life was as if they were attempting to rip out Sherlock's own heart.
Forgot to say I've stolen a line from You've Got Mail cause I'm a sucker for old romantic Meg Rayan movies!
"Come on, you're leaving with me"
John stared at him in disbelief. The man wasn't smart after all, he was a genius.
"She's my landlady."
He didn't know how long it was before he came to, but he opened his eyes to the hottest thing he'd ever seen. John stroking himself desperately while just looking at him… just staring at Sherlock, taking him in, and drawing pleasure from the mere thought that he existed. John shuddered in his arms as he came, and they both collapsed into each other, breathing the same air.
"Free will, brother. Free will"
"Ja… umm, Dr. Sholto" John finally manages to say, "I thought you moved outside London."
Well, it's difficult to write a kiss scene isn't it?
"And if I want him to?"
"Come in" John said as he turned his key in the lock and went inside. Sherlock followed. He had seen John's flat before, but never truly observed it, as he was too occupied with staring at the delightful creature that was John Watson.
"Let's stay calm, everyone." John said. He seemed the only one to have maintained his composure. The others were all breathing hard and Rupert was sniffing repeatedly.
Have a lovely day wherever you are. Love.
As John watched Greg leave to greet other guests, his eyes fell on the Polaroid photo Molly had snapped moments earlier. He looked at it with a grimace. There was Archie, smiling to the camera, but next to him, right where Sherlock was supposed to be, was a blur of white light.
"Can you tell me what happened to your wife?"
In just a moment, he disappeared, swallowed by a gaping chasm of misery and loss.
"Yes?"
They both collapsed to the floor. Sherlock was vaguely aware of John screaming his name from somewhere behind him before his head hit the floor and reality dissolved into darkness.
"Look, I don't know what it is exactly you do with Greg, I don't know what your specialty is, forensics? Linguistics? Criminology? Maybe you were with the SIS for all I know. Me? I'm just a cop, not a specialist. I can tell you that I could look at a suspect from 30 feet away and tell you if he's going to pull out a gun on me in the next 10 seconds, and I'd be always right. Instinct. It got me this far, so I listen to it."
"So in what city in Scotland were you born?
"Yes"
"No. I've been solving the crimes myself. Lestrade is an idiot."
"Very pale hands" John repeated.
He glances at the thin figure as he gets plates and forks from his small kitchen. Sherlock is lying on the small sofa, somehow fitting his gangly limbs in the tiny space. He looks like a big cuddly cat. The shiny raven curls and the piercing eyes both add to the effect. He grimaces as he reads something that must be intriguing, his eyes go a bit crossed, and John decides it's the most adorable thing he has ever seen.
-----
"Not a possibility"
Done, phew! for some reason this last chapter was like "fuck you, you can't write me" and made me so frustrated, but here it is at last!
"Are you a visitor?" he said hoping his voice did not reveal the bewilderment that had yet to dissipate from his mind.
He fell silent. He didn't want to reveal his suspicion that the murderer was in the room just yet. He didn't want to prompt whoever it was to do something before he could be sure about his identity.
"Your blood glucose is at 15 milligrams per deciliter."
Interesting as it might have been, Sherlock didn't have time for this conversation. John and Susan were leaving his sight, turning between trees and bushes.
Hope blooms in his chest as he remembers John's words.
"What do I do?"
Sherlock smiled again and nodded. John turned around to leave and took a few steps, but he couldn't leave it at that, he wanted to take at least one more look at the impossible eyes, but when he turned back around, Sherlock had disappeared.
********
"But he was aiming the axe at you, not Susan. Why?"
John moved before anyone got the chance to even react. He aimed a high kick at the attacker's hand, knocking axe to the floor with a loud clatter. He moved back to a defensive stance, clearly this time ready to put his military combat skills to use. However, the mysterious bandaged man seemed to feel helpless without his axe and disappeared into the darkness again. Bill moved to follow, but Sherlock and John stopped him.
"London Bridge is falling down
He reaches a hand into the pocket of his coat to feel the key that John gave him, and his heart jumps to declare war and take over all rational thought, once again reducing him to a shy teenager.
"I love you too, mad man" he told him and gathered him again in his arms.
But John kept on running. Soon, they could hear Jake, Max, and Rupert moving around them in the dark, but it was difficult to tell where each of them was standing.
"I want to say goodbye" John's voice broke a little but he continued "I don't want to see you again" he said, and left.
"Well, let me see" Sherlock huffs in annoyance as he remembers "Your stupid hospital just replaced the morgue registrar who used to give me access to my specimens." He complains as if it's all John's fault.
"Sorry, we kind of started without you" Sherlock smiled cunningly and gestured at a chair opposite the bed.
"This is so unfair, you know. You just throw on one of your suits and look like a bloody super model, meanwhile I look like my uncle Horace in his church suit."
John lifted his head and looked at her beautiful green eyes. He needed to ask a question, to talk about a feeling that had been tormenting him
Sherlock Holmes knows jealousy. It's fairly simple. He understands it the way he understands a chemical reaction, though certain variables may not be as predictable as chemistry when it comes to human emotion, but it's fairly simple in the end. What people usually miss, as they often see but do not observe, is that jealousy is a mere equation. Love minus satisfaction, love plus hate, love multiplied by anger. It is a main trigger to murder, and this is why it is both interesting and important.
"I'm certainly not." Sherlock felt his cheeks burning for some reason.
"Oi, wanker," John answered with a wry smile.
They sat in awkward silence for moments, but Molly was not having any of that. She was jumping about, trying to entertain everyone.
. It was a huge success."
"Amazing" John laughed and leaned for a kiss "Go on then, how did you know?"
Soon, Sherlock’s trousers were hanging open on his narrow hips. John pushed them open and tugged a bit at the black designer pants so that Sherlock's flushed cock sprang free.
"You know if you keep doing this you're going to get sacked" Anderson spat in a low voice as he handed him gloves. By now, he knew better than to try to stop him.
"Johnnn" he drawls grumpily. John lifts his face, lips swollen from kissing and damp from sucking on Sherlock's peaking nipples.
It was the same man, the same huge black cape and bandaged face, but this time, he had an axe in his hand and was preparing to attack.
All he could do was lean against the door and wait for the inevitable. He wondered where Smith had gotten and how long it would take him to send help.
"Might be interesting" Sherlock eyed the phone screen suspiciously. There was no such thing as an interesting favor, but at this point he was desperate for any distraction. His brain was going to rot and he was willing to leave the flat even for a five. Before he could type in a reply a new text came.
He was angry that his distress was so obvious, frustrated with how distracted he had been, and most of all just simply miserable.
"What else did you do?"
"Dunno… Let's get some sleep and we can think properly in the morning."
John slumps his body next to Sherlock, panting. He starts to giggle as he turns his head to look at Sherlock.
"Don't wanna cause any trouble… you know, with your girlfriend." John said between bites of dumpling.
"Sherlock"
"Strawberries" Sherlock said without lifting his head.
Sherlock blinks his dark lashes multiple times quickly, staring at John like he's never seen him before. This goes on for longer than expected. Seconds pass and Sherlock still stares.
"Today we're going to be conducting a social experiment." Jefferson suddenly said in a terrifyingly mechanical tone, reminiscent of a documentary's voice-over. John and Sherlock exchanged a look.
Aware of how idiotic this plan was, he was still determined to run into Sherlock again, and so he decided to go to the place where he met him last time.
"Oh, are you a client?" she asked warily.
"Yeah, are you?" he asked, trying to turn around and look at him.
"So what are you hiding from?" Mike asked again
Sherlock sat on the table and John could see a streak of blood on the side of his lip. He started cleaning the small cut with a swab.
Mycroft turned back towards the sun and didn't say anything.
"I see you're missing your keys, officer" he said again to Dimmock.
"Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other, then." Sherlock's lips curved upward again.
"Some things are true whether you believe them or not"
He opened his eyes slowly, heart fluttering "Did you feel that?"
"Hours. Doesn't it help the patient to be visited?"
John immediately recognized the gaunt face and the greasy long hair. Angelo Costello was one of the most notorious mob bosses in London. He had only been sent to prison after one of his own employees had testified against him in court.
"Sherlock" John whispered again "Are you here?"
"I think she might have dropped it when she left to go on her walk. You know, before…" Bill fell silent, staring sadly at the choker in his hand.
"If you mean I'm quite lucky then I agree. I didn't expect this dull trip to turn into an exciting case. This is at least an 8." Sherlock said seriously, but John burst out laughing.
The door to the flat upstairs was wide open, and John let himself in, surveying the room as he put everything on the coffee table. Sherlock was standing by the window, still dressed in his impeccable suit and holding a violin in his hand. He looked like a mythical creature in the weak light. His pale eyes seemed to be capable of reflecting every color to ever exist.
It was clear Costello had no clue and Dimmock was standing behind him, unable to see the mark either. Suddenly, Sherlock was grabbing John by the shoulders and screaming at him to get down.
"Weird is good"
"Oh god! We're all going to die!" Rupert whimpered.
Sherlock ignores him and rests his forehead on his right shoulder. He pushes his hand lower still until he is palming the bulge between John's legs.
"What's that on your mouth?"
His heart was beating wildly as if it was trying to escape the cage of his ribs, and his brain was shutting everything down except for the delicious kiss. But he wanted more, he needed more of the taste of John, the smell of John, the feel of John. Unconsciously, he lifted a hand and grabbed John's collar, tugging him towards his body. John was still sitting on the floor next to the tub, and huffed a small laugh as he was being pulled inside.
Falling down, falling down
"Exactly. They were supposed to be selling out here. All their clothes are wet from the rain except for their backs, where they had packs to carry the drugs. Someone tracked them down and took the bags."
"Ay, the pain it costs me
Sherlock felt the adrenaline already flooding his veins, his heart jumping with euphoria, and his brain racing with the excitement.
Sherlock knows no fear, no pain, no hunger. But he'd give it all up. He loves you that much"
"It's alright John, I saw the way you and Sholto were looking at each other. This isn't serious anyway. It was just a bit of fun… a little game." He says even as he feels his heart breaking with every word. He fights to keep his expression cold and unaffected.
Short chapter, but the next one will have a kiss :)
His movement is sloppy and uncoordinated, but he pushes John against the wall, making him gasp as he finds himself trapped against Sherlock's longer frame. He looks up in confusion, his lips move to form a question, but Sherlock kisses him desperately and the words are lost between their mouths.
"They're both in sitting positions, so they were both awake when they were killed. Assuming the husband did this, he would have had to stand by the bed to shoot the wife, why would he shoot her while sitting so close to her like that, twisting his arm to get the right angle. Makes no sense. More importantly, the blood pattern on the headboard and wall clearly suggests that the bullet came from a higher angle, not one that was at the same level as her head."
Suddenly, John's eyes are sad and fearful. He's looking at him differently, like they haven't known each other for months, like he is bracing himself for something hurtful and difficult. Sherlock tenses with apprehension.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And?" Sherlock's patience was running thin.
Sherlock was too befuddled to say anything, and suddenly, Greg's eyes lit up with a mixture of amusement and recognition.
"Well, they do say the first year's the hardest."
There wasn't any doubt about it, there was a bloody severed leg there, and Sherlock couldn't help taking a step back in horror.
This time, Sherlock was the one who came closer. He took John's trembling hand in his. He rested his forehead against John's and whispered desperately.
“People die”
Bill stopped too, and he and Sherlock stood on either side of John, who kept staring at something down the hall. It quickly became clear what it was, because something glinted in the dark and Sherlock stopped breathing when he recognized the axe.
Sherlock stares. What did he miss?
For a moment, the woman kept smiling and looking at him as if not comprehending. Then, her face transformed horrifically.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, John could not be more obvious, or more stubborn for that matter. They should have been there by now and they were clearly lost. All trees looked alike, yet John insisted they were on the right track. On top of everything else, there was no mobile phone signal in the whole area.
A nurse peered in "We're ready for you Dr. Sawyer."
"Why?" Sherlock noticed then that John had something his hand, but he was distracted as the handsome face came nearer.
Damn it! He should have tied him up or something. Anything to keep him from disappearing like a bloody ghost again!
Greg's face turned and he grinned the moment he saw Sherlock. He did not even flinch at the fact that someone had materialized out of nowhere in his hospital room.
best interests."
"So the shooter was indeed standing, but let's picture this situation. If the wife had been awake with her husband standing in front of her with a gun, wouldn’t she have tried to run or at least struggle before getting shot? But she clearly didn't, or else the bullet wound would be in the back of her head. Now, why would she just calmly receive a bullet, unless someone else was there, someone who had been threatening both of them before killing them."
The speakers outside on the premises were repeatedly sounding a warning now: "New prisoners arrive in five minutes. All prisoners must remain at least 40 feet away from the gate." John watched the scene through the window. Soon, the long grey bus was making its way through the gate, past the checkpoints, until it stopped with a squeak inside the yard. The prisoners started filing out in a neat line, hands cuffed together in front of them. Even from that distance, John could sense their fear and trepidation. Those feelings were unfortunately quite justified for numerous reasons.
John let go of the soft pink nipple with a 'pop' sound and move to the other one, which he sucked on with the same look of concentration, as if he was doing the most important thing in his life.
John had been staying with him since he had been discharged from the hospital. It had taken a lot of sulking to convince him to stay at Baker Street at least until he got better, but Sherlock was eventually victorious.
"Mr. Lestrade, this operation is a big deal. If you continue to eat like this and smoke, then you might as well skip it."
"You see," Jefferson went on "You're not really the intended target group of my research, but well, one flawed specimen can't hurt anybody." He chuckled.
"Because I never sleep when you stay over"
John's anger flares at once, he knows what this Mycroft is alluding to, but he also knows Sherlock has been clean for a long time and does not need reminding of his past drug abuse right now.
And yet, every evening after work, John would show up at 221B with a bag of takeaway and stay there until midnight. Sometimes they went out to have dinner at Angelo's, and sometimes John accompanied him on his clients' cases. It proved very useful to have John tag along, not just because he was a police officer with a gun always at the ready, but also because the way they worked and talked together made Sherlock think more clearly and get to the bottom of mysteries quicker for some reason.
"What do they taste like? Describe it"
But John was still staring incredulously down "Let me see your hand"
“You cannot and will not do anything unless I tell you. You’re allowed to watch until I tell you otherwise, and then I’ll decide what you’ll have of him. SH”
"Nothing" Sherlock echoed.
"Sherlock Holmes" John said, grinning "Are you asking me to live with you?"
' their gun." He put an unpleasant emphasis on the word 'cleaning'.
"I know"
"You found him John, you did it. It's over."
Fair warning as the next chapter will include explicit content.
"I'm not sure you do. You put up a good fight. You did everything you could"
"I know" he said while sitting up in bed "Christ, you look good. I forgot how good everybody looked" then he started laughing, which was even more puzzling.
As Sherlock stand to leave, John turns and gets the chain holding his keys from the hook on the wall.
"I figured. Who are you?"
With one glance at the man, he was able to read Mike's obsession with playing by the rules, so he didn't even bother to ask for anything, and now he is bored.
"No." John smiled and kissed his hand gently "I'm not in love with her. I'm in love with you."
"But she was blind."
Sherlock shuts his eyes, bracing himself for one of John's admittedly brilliant fellatios, but John neglects his arrow-stiff cock and goes down to nuzzle the cleft of his behind.
Plagiarism alert: line stolen from The Hobbit as you may have noticed
"Yup"
Thanks for reading :)
Henry's eyes shifted slowly to him, but there was no answer.
"Don't you dare die, you idiot!" Sherlock said, and John wanted to laugh but he couldn't. The harder he tried to cling, the quicker reality slipped away into hazy dreams of nights spent in a cold house, glass shattering around him, and Harry blinking blood out of her eyes and smiling.
John grabbed his waist and pulled him down a bit. He started kissing and licking at his balls and perineum before he moved gently to the tight ring of muscle. Sherlock moaned embarrassingly loudly at the feel of John's tongue caressing his hole softly but hungrily. He could not help moving and swirling his hips on John's mouth, relishing the soft groans John was making. John stopped for a moment, hands going up and down Sherlock's flanks.
"So, you've been coming to the infirmary for your investigation. And I was what? A tool for you to use in the process?"
"No, come here, up here" he said grabbing Sherlock's biceps and gently guiding him up the bed so that he was kneeling directly above John's face.
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow. "I can't think of anything you'd want that you haven't just received."
They got out of the office and barely managed to cross the hallway and hide behind an alcove before someone appeared on the other end. They couldn't get a good look at whoever it was from where they were hiding.
“I was holding his heart in my hand when he died”
"Really. Why is that?"
"Well?" Sherlock prompts.
"Home"
John steals a glance in the direction of the man again, and panics when he finds him staring right back.
"Did you feel that?"
"John! Where are you?" he called.
"Ever since I was a kid."
They found Bill waiting by the door looking grim and barely holding himself together.
"I didn't pick up a fight" Sherlock said indignantly "The other prisoner was being deliberately obtuse in answering my questions, so I started to deduce him. He didn't like it" he shrugged.
"I understand" John said, trying to control his broken voice "I'll see you."
"Hold this. Put pressure on it" John said and turned to remove his latex gloves and get rid of the used needle. He decided against answering after all. It was never a good idea to discuss personal matters with inmates, even if they were smart gorgeous inmates who had the eyes of a black panther and the lips of a Greek God.
Sherlock started moaning again and stroked himself a bit harder. Greg felt John move on the bed near them, and he heard the unmistakable slurping sounds of kissing.
And so it was. At 8 pm sharp, Greg Lestrade was standing outside 221B exactly. He had no idea what had been waiting for him, but he was shivering with excitement at the possibilities.
Sherlock remained silent, waiting for the melodramatic opening speech to be over so that Greg would cut to the chase.
"No" he says with as much dignity as he can muster, but his quick breathing betrays him and John simply laughs and resumes his ministrations.
"Don't worry. Johnny doesn't like her. Obviously." He looked smug as he said that, but the pain in Sherlock's heart became just a bit less excruciating at his words.
London Bridge is falling down
They sat in silence for a couple of minutes before John spoke again.
Despite everything Mycroft had said to discourage Sherlock, he had followed John around nearly all the time since the day he saw him. He had never experienced a state of serenity like the one he did when walking with John. Well, he wasn't technically walking with him, just on his side, but it was amazing nonetheless. Never a dull moment with this fascinating man. His thoughts seemed to amaze Sherlock every second.
"Yeah, let's go." Jake's voice shook a bit but he started moving all the same.
John was quick to flee the scene.
"How do you know when I'm here?"
Sherlock was only gone for 15 minutes when John heard the commotion. He abandoned the files on his desk to find Dimmock and another officer supporting Sherlock. John surveyed him quickly, his body was curled around itself in agony, sweat streaming along his face, and blood running freely from his left foot.
The familiarity of the quite smile and the intense gaze send shivers down John's spine, but they also poke at old wounds he thought were healed. He schools his expression into neutrality nonetheless, and tries to act natural.
-----
"Oh, use your imagination." Sherlock complained.
John didn't say anything, he just smiled and started working on Sherlock's button and zipper with one hand, and with the other he took Sherlock’s own hand and started mouthing at his long fingers.
Then, John felt rather than saw Sherlock move closer. He realized what was going to happen one moment before their lips collided.
If you have comments, feedback, suggestions, or would just like to say hi, please go for it!
John took a step forward, his whole being pulled into the orbit of the other body. He took a deep breath and spoke again.
“You can have this” Sherlock said with a smirk.
"No. Because something happened in my O.R. and I got this jolt. I got this feeling that there's something bigger out there. Something bigger than me, bigger than you, and…" He stopped suddenly and looked at Sherlock in defiance, as if he was expecting him to laugh "Does that sound crazy?"
At that, the attacker seemed to grow reluctant. He clearly hadn't expected an audience. And with one quick move and a sweep of his dreadful cape, he turned and disappeared in the bushes to his right.
"Did I say anything?" John shifted in his seat slowly.
"No. he's been dead since morning. Before anything even started"
He paused, and looked around the place before continuing
When they reached the basement, Bill quickly restarted the generator and the lights were back on, but on their way back, they heard loud noises from the dining room. They found the group gathered around the huge window. The same one the killer had passed by when he took Lidiya away. But this time, it was completely shattered and pieces of glass littered the floor.
"Are you sniffing my hair, you mad man?" John opened his eyes to look up at Sherlock, who had his nose buried in the short blonde strands.
"Up here," John called back "Put some gloves on, they're by the door."
"Hey" John opened his eyes halfway, his words lazy and sleep-addled. "Can't sleep?" he asked, and without waiting for an answer, he lifted the hand lying on the bed between them to stroke Sherlock's face tenderly. Sherlock sighed, leaning into the touch, and found himself moving closer until he was engulfed in John's arms and warmth.
"You liar! Who... What are you?" John shouted at him.
Sherlock's world took a deep, sharp tumble into void. The loss of John was like a weight pulling him deeper every day.
"Oh, you're up. Excellent, we can start right away." The man pointing a gun to his head said.
Umm, so... sorry?
Bill grabbed a candlestick from the chest of drawers and lit it. It spilled a faint puddle of light, but at least Bill could see where he was going and John and Sherlock followed.
"Yeah, that’s getting a bit scary now." John says in concern.
"Please help me find him" he put all the pain and confusion he felt into the words, hoping Mike would believe him.
"I… I'll tell the nurse to finish changing your bandage."
"I warned you Sherlock, don't get involved" Mycroft said. Sherlock didn't answer, but kept staring at the canvas of twinkling buildings and streets spread underneath them.
John averted his eyes and looked at the small hand on his arm instead
, John, and believe me, if he had, he would not have got out of the room alive."
He surveyed the place, stopping at a small bookcase filled with mystery novels, many of them by an author called Agatha Christie.
John quirked an eyebrow at him "A friend? How do you know it isn't a date?"
-----
"Their families do. It's very lucrative if you think about it. Inmates would do just about anything to get their hands on some drugs here, and so more and more of them had been spending what little savings they had on the outside, or asking their families for money, or simply doing the mafia's bidding, no questions asked."
John's left hand combed through the dark curls reverently, while his right hand cradled his nape gently. Sherlock's breathing was going quicker as John sucked on the skin right above his collarbone, and he started tugging his shirt buttons loose impatiently.
"Why?"
"Cool!" Archie giggled.
-----
"I was looking for someone to get me to you." He answered weakly "and some men beat me up. They thought I had money, but I didn't"
Greg's face lit up as he took out his wallet, where he had a photo of the woman who had nagged John for days about her husband. Molly had beautiful brown eyes that glittered with a strange mixture of innocence and mischief. Greg stared at the photo with so much affection and pride, Sherlock suddenly understood how he had known about John.
"So, I see you've gained that weight back, huh Rupert?" Bill teased as they all started eating.
John blinks, trying to digest the new data.
"Sarah… I"
"Do you want this? Are you sure?"
"I started to try once or twice, then I thought 'Why do that to her?'"
Greg nodded silently, and John had to stop for a moment and marvel at what he was actually saying. He had made peace with it by now, but it was still strange, and more importantly infuriating.
He sighs and his hand slides slowly downwards to palm the swell beneath in his pants. He inhales air from John's pillow as he strokes himself slowly, recalling how John pins him down and kisses every inch of his body. His breathing quickens and he bites his lips, imagining the taste of John's mouth on his tongue. His moan is muffled in soft cotton as he comes, John's name whispered between heated sighs.
"I don't eat while working" Sherlock said as he carefully sit his violin in its case, "Slows me down. You can have your dinner nonetheless. I don't mind."
"So was either of you able to get a look at that psycho when he attacked you?" Max asked, interrupting their hushed conversation.
"Huh. Bad news, I'm afraid." He turned the screen to him again "180 milligrams per deciliter, you're definitely diabetic."
He turns to look at whoever interrupted and his heart skips a beat. Platinum blonde hair, angular nose, square jaw, clear blue eyes. A rush of memories floods his brain and he forgets how to speak for a moment. The newcomer keeps smiling pleasantly and looking between him and Sherlock.
A scream came from somewhere close. John and Sherlock were on the move again. Moments later, they found the other three men gathered around something. Jake had a torch and was pointing it at Lidiya's also severed head and torso.
Everyone seemed speechless and affected, but Sherlock was having none of that.
"Yes. People are fascinating. Sometimes boring, but I like to watch them anyway"
Quickly and smoothly, John slipped into focus and precision as he worked on the patient. He breathed evenly as he made the first incision. This was the thing he did best, and he was simply in his element, his delicate yet competent hands worked the different scalpels, retractors, and clamps. Everything was going well. John sighed in relief behind his mask as he backed up, leaving the assistant surgeon to stitch the patient up.
"Sometimes, I wonder about my life. I lead a small life.  Well, not small, but circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder, do I do it because I like it, or because I haven't been brave? I feel like there should have been more to it than this. Maybe I should have joined the military like I've always imagined I would after all, but the truth is, right now it feels like… nothing ever happens to me"
"I'll never go on a trip with you ever again, especially not on bloody Halloween." Sherlock said.
"Fine." He answered, trying to ignore the sirens going off in his head. John smiled, and Sherlock's breath hitched and his pulse soared to unreasonable levels. He pulled himself out of John's arms slowly, feeling inexplicably dazed.
"You don't know that"
By the time John had talked to the crime scene personnel, signed off work, and collected the old case files from his flat, the clock had ticked past midnight. But he felt more alive than he had in years. His heart was racing as he approached Baker Street in his car, box of files and dinner next to him on the passenger seat.
"I… I'm sorry." was all he could say while watching a person's world collapse right before him. The mother and daughter clung to each other sobbing, and John fled the room.
He gradually took in the blinding lights and colors around him. The world was bathed in a dull grey glow. Sherlock found the courage to open his eyes properly now, and for a moment he tried to make sense of everything he was feeling
"Okay" John looked bashful for a moment. Perhaps he thought Sherlock was offended by the question, but he got up all the same and they started walking.
"No" Sherlock's answer was short and distracted as he went back to the file in his hands.
Will you come back? Will you leave me here, dying?
Data: John met his ex when he was supposed to be spending time with Sherlock. Observation: Ex is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Obvious. A very skilled one too, probably renowned in his field. He is good-looking and fit. Played a sort of competitive sport at some point of his life, possibly football judging by his muscly strong-looking legs.  He taught John at university. Age gap and a somewhat frowned upon affair made them discreet about it. Problem: Sherlock feels miserable and angry and cannot stop imagining John with James Sholto. It makes him feel alone.
But right now, Sherlock wants to be the one in control, to take John apart and put him back together again. He deepens the kiss, and John makes a delicious sound that dissolves into the hot twists and turns of their mouths. Sherlock is surprised to find himself biting on the delicious pink lower lip, but John doesn’t seem to mind in the least, moaning softly and breathing harshly against him.
"Well, if it isn't John Watson!" a voice startles both of them and John sighs in frustration because he simply cannot catch a break with the man he is crazy about.
"It's alright." Max smiled, revealing a set of perfect white teeth. "That happens more than you think in our industry, what with changing rooms and all."
His thought process paused at that. That's it! When he arrived here!
Sherlock had grown bored of food too quickly for John's liking. He had been struggling more and more to get food into him recently, but he found some ways to convince him.
Sherlock, though, kept his eyes on the way Susan was leaning forward while she talked to John, repeatedly touching his arm and laughing at his jokes. The urge to grab John's arm and drag him away from the room was overwhelming, but Sherlock managed to keep calm.
"Fine. You?" John looked steadily into his eyes as he put on his latex gloves.
John felt heat rise in his face as he finally understood what she had been insinuating. For some reason, words betrayed him and all he could do was stammer as he crossed the threshold.
"Partly, yes. The first time I looked in a microscope I knew I will always be astonished by it"
They went into the bedroom, where the young woman was lying in bed, the sheets around her were smudged in crimson.
"Doc.! Thought you'd never show up. Come in!" he beamed as he guided him inside.
"You're oggling him again" Sherlock complained.
"It's too much for them. People don't believe in us anymore" He seemed to be lost in thought for a bit, then came back to himself, flipping the photo to reveal another one behind it. This one showed a curly-haired boy laughing madly.
Things are about to get messy!
John glanced along the path ahead, and there he was… there was Sherlock again. Whatever deity is out there, John secretly thanked it as he spotted the long graceful silhouette standing, as if waiting.
"True, but she was already dead. He attached her to a dummy wearing the same bandages and black cape. Then, using two guide wires that he tied to the balcony railings and the roof above, he made the dummy rush by the window. Then, when we were all in shock, he cut the wires quickly. It was very effective. He made us think the killer had run off into the woods and we went after him. You see, it was an easy task to accomplish. At least it was for someone who's used to doing this on the set. You were the only one who had a chance to get on the roof and prepare all this, Rupert."
-------
John's heart sinks "What? Why?"
"John H. Watson?" Sherlock asked putting stress on the H as he read John's name tag.
At the hospital, Sherlock watched John prepping for the surgery. He looked better. His eyes were clear and hands were steady. Sherlock stood by him through the operation. He did not even fight the temptation to listen in to John's thoughts.
John and Molly looked down in unison to see a small empty tub of chocolate ice-cream.
*****
"Do not shoot at Sherlock Holmes."
"I'd put myself between them." John answered simply, meeting Sherlock's gaze.
Then, Sherlock likes to put his head where John's head was, lie exactly within the boundaries of the slight dip in the mattress, and wrap himself completely in John's sheets. It feels warm and safe and smells like fabric softener and John's shampoo.
John glanced from where the needle was still planted in the pale arm to see a look of amusement on Sherlock's face.
Sherlock slowly raises his head to look at his brother in law. He is startled at the deep affection in his eyes. Greg lets go of his arm slowly and smiles to him.
John opened his eyes slowly, adjusting them to the morning light spilling through the window. For a moment he had no idea where he was, but then he felt the warm body lying in his arms. He buried his nose in the soft curls, inhaling the heady scent. It occurred to him that he did not have one bad dream that night, he had slept like a baby. He wondered if it was because of the thrill they had they day before, or because of being with Sherlock, though he doubted the two could be separated.
"Because Johnson knew something he shouldn't have. The same thing I've been investigating at the infirmary"
When he opens his eyes, John is straddling him. He looks predatory as his eyes survey Sherlock's body sprawled on the bed. His hand, now coated with Sherlock's semen, strokes his own cock desperately. Sherlock wants to help, touch, anything, but John is already groaning on top of him, his semen shoots long creamy stripes on Sherlock's heaving chest.
John grunted as he opened his eyes and tried to make sense of what was going on. In that time, their assailant had managed to pull back his axe and was turning to John.
"Which gift?"
Snippets of two different worlds flashed before his eyes, he didn't know which one was real. They were both equally terrifying.
"Fine"
John walked toward the waiting room, trying his best to stop his hands from twitching. He ran a shaky hand through his hair.
"Sherlock, what… where are we going?"
"I do?" his lips lifted in a tight smile.
"Okay." John nods and stares at the floor for a moment before he locks eyes with Sherlock again "Just so you know, I didn't want to break it off, I wanted…" he pauses and shakes his head again like he's trying to stop himself from saying something "But never mind. It's good to know this was just a game to you."
"Oh, I'm glad you asked Mr. Holmes. You see, I have very meticulous standards. First, I photograph the couple's wedding, watch them exchanges vows and promise eternal love. I then watch them closely to see if they fit the profile. I wait one year, and pay them a visit." He paused and looked at John with a small smile.
John's clever mouth moved to his neck, kissing and licking as Sherlock found himself joining in the rhythm and moving up and down with a string of deep moans issuing from his mouth without him ever intending to make them.
John turned around in confusion "What about them?"
"Go on, then."
John thought of calling for back-up, but he was too desperate to catch the psycho with his own hands, he could not tolerate the idea of not confronting him after all this time. Sherlock didn't even seem to consider the idea of calling for back-up.
"See that twat there?" John tries not to snort, Sherlock never swears, and it just doesn't suit him. His voice drips with contempt as he stares at an extremely posh looking man engrossed in a conversation with the chief physician at Bart's. He is holding an umbrella and wearing a three-piece suit that must be worth John's rent for five months.
His features had to be carved in marble, like statues of Greek gods John had seen at museums. The celestial face was all graceful curves and neat angles, framed by thick, warm dark chocolate curls. The man was wrapped in a long black coat, but underneath, there must have been nothing but liquid light.
He turns to ascend the stairs, but then the temptation to turn the other way… just to the left, suddenly grows wildly. He knows John is home, can deduce it from the smell of tea, the position of the door mat, and the fact that John was on call yesterday and must be off today.
"No."
"Sorry!" Mike said with a sympathetic grimace, and Sherlock relaxed again
John opened the door to his flat to find Sarah already there and waiting for him.
Hello! So, I'm still not sure how to use archive warnings... I mean, this fic has some violence in it, but not half of what you could see in any movie on TV any time of the day, so I don't know, I didn't use any warnings, but right now I feel like I should warn you, this chapter has some angst, some violence, and some poorly written porn. Be prepared!
And this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
"My landlady."
"What happened?" he asks and finally meets his eyes. His face is filled with curiosity, but also with something else… some savage emotion that John cannot name.
He packed his things and got out of the break room. Striding to the exit, he noticed a tall dark figure at the end of the hallway, right by Greg Lestrade's room. No patient could possibly be out roaming the hallways at this hour, and it certainly did not look like a staff member either. John came closer to take a better look at the man who had his back turned to him.
"Yeah well, tell him to shove off. You know why I'm here." John's tone turned serious "It's a crime scene."
"I…" he stutters, quite uncharacteristically.
It was minutes… or maybe hours later, when Sherlock opened his eyes with a jolt. He was lying almost on top of John, with his head on his doctor's warm chest. He knew he woke up for a reason, so he lifted his head to survey the room.
"He must have smashed the glass and entered through the window." Susan said.
I don't know. I struggled with this chapter and now it feels too sad and miserable
"Search for the bags. They must have gotten rid of them as soon as they got the drugs. The location should give us a clue."
"It's weird to see you again"
"I don't want to hurt you" Sherlock said, and his beautiful face was filled with sorrow. It made John want to touch him so badly it hurt.
He found him sitting on the kitchen table, peering through the lenses of the microscope John had given him as a gift just recently.
"You choose"
"Sure, the doctor" Greg repeated with a knowing smile.
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it. He seemed to be trying to decide on something.
"Call the police. Now!" he instructed. He turned back just in time to see John running towards the thick wall of trees ahead.
"So, what does he do exactly?"
"Sorry?" he said as he retracted the needle and pressed a piece of gauze in its place
Thanks so much to anyone reading and I really hope you liked it, hugs <3
The man turned around and earth halted. John froze as if suspended in a bubble as he gazed at the sight before him. He wondered if his sleep-deprived brain was hallucinating the man standing there.
“John, oh, John!” Sherlock babbled incoherently lifting his hips, partly to get more of his cock into John’s mouth and partly to allow his trousers to slide down and away. John was clearly desperate for any friction, so he moved back a bit and started pulling up his jumper.
"Doctor… Doctor Watson!"
He lined his cock up with the slippery soft ring, and started a maddeningly slow penetration, cursing under his breath as he slid his glorious cock inside Sherlock’s body.
The moon-pale face only made an appearance in the haze of dreams that invaded what minimal shuteye John was able to get between intervals of tormenting insomnia. He had never felt more tired, and everything he did was mechanic and devoid of feelings.
The heavenly smell of sex wafted and filled the room and Greg's nostrils. Unable to take it any longer, he undid his trousers and pushed his hand down his pants to stroke his hard-rock cock, but he did it slowly, teasing himself with an erratic pace to relish every moment of it.
He finally locates his trousers under the bed and his shirt not far from it.
There is finality in his tone and John doesn't ask. For all he knows, anyone with intelligence equal to Sherlock's can run the world, let alone a country.
"What?"
"This my Molly" He said, uttering the name with reverence "When I took the plunge, I couldn't get a job… No past, no training, No I.D. But she didn't care, she stayed with me, supported me, helped me catch up on education and whatnot. And now I'm a bloody police inspector, do you believe it?"
"What is it?" John asked. As always, he immediately sensed something was on Sherlock's mind.
His phone chimed and he almost jumped up and down when he saw it was from Greg. Yes, case, finally!
"No. I knew you'd save me." John said, still smiling.
A million roses bloomed in John's heart. He covered Sherlock's full lips with his, feeling a surging tide of warmth that left him limp. His hand found Sherlock's face, and he cupped the graceful curve of his cheek. Everything was blurred and drowned to nothingness. The soft caress of tender lips flooded John's senses as the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world.
"And that's my little monster, Archie" he said fondly.
“Watch what? Is this another one of your bloody experiments?”
It was faint and sad, like the rustle of a butterfly's wings. He heard his name being called, a murmured supplication from the lips he so longed to feel.
"Yeah, yeah" John huffs as he slumps back on the bed "You're happily married to your work. I highly doubt your work makes you orgasm three times in one night though." He lifts his arms to support the back of his head, and the sheets give up and slip completely off onto the floor.
"I think you've had too much wine, Billy." Max smiled nervously.
"It wasn't our fault, Bill." Jake said.
Right then, John spotted her and quickly slipped into the lift on his right, Sherlock on his heel. When they got off, John walked straight into a room where a bespectacled chubby doctor stood in the center. The room had a huge glass partition separating it from the hallway outside, and was filled with cradles within which babies slept or stared at the sealing with their twinkling beady eyes, holding their chubby fists in the air.
"Why do you think he tried to attack you in the forest?"
"What?" Sherlock unintentionally snapped. His heart was thrumming madly and he felt his lips twitching involuntarily into a pout.
"I'm sure you know this but average glucose for a non-diabetic is about a hundred milligrams per deciliter, so if we see a number like that here, we know you've been misdiagnosed" John watched as Sherlock shifted in his seat.
"Yes"
Also, warning, angst ahead!
All those years, John had tried to protect his baby sister. Every time their father had come home drunk and started breaking things, John had stood between him and the shaking terrified heap that was Harry. All he ever wanted was for her to be happy and safe, and someone had come and taken all that away in a moment, leaving a gun in her hand. As if John would for a second believe she had done this to the woman she loved, the woman she quit drinking for.
"We'll talk at Brighton"
Sherlock has to take a deep breath and sigh before he answers. It draws a satisfied smirk on John's face, which Sherlock simultaneously wants to kiss and punch.
"Oh you're still here," Sherlock sighed. "It's just work, Mycroft. Shut up about it already."
"I think he’s brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They’re always so desperate to get caught."
"Me too." Sherlock moved with him and John nodded.
"Yes. It's fine. Go to sleep."
Sherlock did not think it could get any better, but smart, beautiful John could make everything better. He reached a hand and wrapped it around both of them.
John casts nervous glances in his date's direction. He often finds himself taking the opportunity of Sherlock's distraction to stare at him like an idiot.
"Alright. You're not experiencing any tingling sensation, cold sweats, anything?"
"Honey, stop pestering the nice man and come help me with the biscuits" Molly called to her son.
To his amazement, John giggled.
John felt his jaw clenching, adrenaline pumping in his system. He looked at Sherlock, frantically trying to communicate, trying to come up with a plan.
Bill turned distracted eyes at him. He took his hand out of his pocket as if he just realized what he was doing. "Oh, this. It's Lidiya's choker. I found it by the front door."
Sherlock looked around him in desperation, his eyes fell on the computer sitting on the desk in front of the receptionist, and reached for the colorful wires,
"You understand that by law, I'm obligated to file a report if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct."
John suppressed a laugh as he bent to remove the ice-cream from the floor.
"Haven't you wondered how inmates managed to breach cell block?" Sherlock asked.
Susan started screaming in horror. John got up and was out of the door in the time it took everyone to comprehend what was happening. Sherlock followed immediately. Once they were outside, they went around the house to the dining room window, but there was no one there.
He had turned around to leave at least five times before finally deciding to ring the bell. He told himself he had come this far anyway, might as well enjoy himself.
"She will someday"
His limbs felt like fluid as he shifted to face John again. John smiled adoringly at him as he took him in his arms, and they both fell asleep like that.
"Alright then." Jake crossed his arms defensively "If he is one of us, then how were we all able to see him pass by the window with Lidiya?"
God! How was he so smitten like a teenager after meeting this guy twice? He didn't even know his surname. Maybe John should just ask Greg Lestrade once he gets better.
"What's your last name?" there was anger and fear in his voice now.
"It's alright" John said, smiling at this completely different Molly, who took a hold of his arm and led him to the back garden. The sun was shining and the weather was perfect.
"They both would have died for each other. Nothing complicated about it. They didn't do it to each other. Someone did it to them. Same thing in every case." He gestured at the box.
John was quiet for a moment, but he couldn’t resist the urge to ask the question that was bothering him the most.
I'm sorry for the late update. The magical fairies of inspiration seemed to have abandoned me lately, hope you enjoy this though!
John woke up with a start, his shoulder sending signals of dull ache to his brain. He looked around as he slowly regained awareness of his surroundings, and he was immediately and vividly reminded of the dream when his eyes fell on two irises glowing in the dark like a cat, staring at him.
"John…" he whispered between moans and sighs, "John, I'm going to…" but before he finished his sentence, his whole body was shivering as pure ecstasy took over it. He threw back his head as his cock twitching untouched and sending creamy ribbons of semen across John's chest and stomach.
Also, I realize I keep shoving Mycroft in every story I write, but I really love him and love his relationship with Sherlock, and then I was like, why not some Mystrade too!
Lidiya, however, was nowhere to be found. Max came downstairs with wet hair and said he had been in the shower and couldn't hear anyone coming in.
"Who says I'll overexert myself? Maybe I'll let you do all the work." He smiled smugly.
He took out one strawberry "Are you sure you don't want any?" He put it between his teeth and crashed their mouths together, and they both bit into the sweetness as they kissed, slowly, gently, lovingly.
"You like to observe?" John asked as he took another bite
"Please"
Sigh. I love Lorca so much!
"I didn't find him, you did, you brilliant prat."
"There is so much beauty up here" Sherlock said, wondering how he could ever lose this.
They were coming from Sherlock's bedroom. Greg's legs did not request permission to start walking, and with a few strides, he was standing by the door and turning the knob, feeling like he was in for a treat.
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Sherlock came closer, still hidden from sight. He knew John felt it, though he couldn't see him. He sighed as Sherlock lied behind to him and wrapped his arms around his lean frame, a cherished treasure under his watchful gaze.
"Oh, please, John, please!" he shouts, appalled at what he's saying, but unable to stop.
"Dr. Sholto, how was Glasgow?" Sherlock asks simply.
"Need a favor." The text said. So much for the 'game is on.'
"But something unexpected happened and almost ruined your entire plan." Sherlock tried to keep his tone calm.
"Listen… this is insane. I wait all day… just hoping for one more minute with you...and I don't even know you" he stammered, feeling heat rising in his face.
Done! that was fun to write!
"There ain't no flying under my radar" Dimmock sounded annoyed and agitated.
Sherlock was lying limp on the bed, eyes squeezed shut, mouth open and gulping air, face and neck flushed, and chest heaving. The beautiful terrain of his chest and abdomen smoothed gradually into the dip just below his hip bones, where his flushed cock lied delicately.
"Alright. Why don't you come with me so we can look at these cuts and then we'll see about Dr. Watson, hmm?"
"You don't want to do this Costello," he said, while his brain frantically raced to come up with a plan "do you really want to answer for this on top of the trouble you're already in?"
"As a matter of fact I did." Sherlock said sounding too calm, given the situation they were in. John turned his face to glare at him, why couldn't he shut up for just one minute!
"What? What is it now? Am I thinking too loudly for your highness?" Greg answered, unable to hide what had slowly grown into resentment against the handsome, genius, bloody perfect Mr. Sherlock Holmes, with his shiny curls and his gorgeous alien eyes. God! Greg had to get a grip and stop acting like a bloody teenager
"No. stop right there. Tell me what is going on and where we're going. How did you find me?"
"Oh come on! Everyone saw me in the woods! If I had a body with me, then you would have seen it!"
He feels the familiar twist in the depth of his belly that John is always responsible for, his heart working at maximum capacity, and his hands scrambling to touch him everywhere… anywhere.
"He said I was the first to ever do it, the only one!"
At this point John was hovering over his long body, but when their bodies brushed he felt Sherlock's very hard erection against his hip.
"What?"
John looks in the mirror nervously. He never dresses up and it just feels odd to wear a suit and tie. He runs a hand through his hair to tamp down the stray strands, but they won't budge and they just stick up again.
Well, it will be a bit itchy, but it's only a couple of flights of stairs, he can do without the pants until he gets to 221B. 221C, the basement flat where his relatively new neighbor lives, is much smaller and darker, but John keeps it spotless clean and meticulously neat that it feels spacious due to the lack of clutter. John is still an intern and cannot afford even this tiny flat, but he somehow charmed Mrs. Hudson to give it to him for a more affordable price. Sherlock tries hard to pretend he is not jealous that he isn't her only spoiled, adored tenant anymore.
But John just giggled. "I think I love you too." He said and kissed him again.
John had barely taken a couple of steps outside of the operation room before the nurse called him back. The patient had flat lined! He couldn't let the shock freeze him just yet, he had to keep his mind clear. He put on a new apron and pair of gloves and started at the patient again, heart thudding and brain working frantically.
And then one day it started. It was a hot day, too hot even for July, and it seemed to do the trick and trigger things into action. John had been called into sickbay in B wing to check on several patients there when he overheard a message on Officer Dimmock's radio.
"I'm sorry. Tom passed away"
Let me commune, then, commune with your silence,
"Okay."
John sobered as he watch Sherlock leave, then took notice of Anderson staring at him suspiciously. He turned his head quickly and started getting rid of the used supplies.
"Did you know?" he asked Mycroft, somehow knowing the answer.
He falls back on the bed, trying to catch his breath as he shamelessly divests himself of the pants. John takes his clothes off quickly and soon joins him on the bed.
"I asked Mycroft for help"
"Okay, so what do we do now?"
Greg felt his body burning with need as he watched John's clever lips worship and tantalize Sherlock's body. His hand moved slowly to palm his raging erection and he tried not to moan at the contact.
Hopefully next chapter would be the last one,
John kept staring up at him, torn between amazement and disbelief, but everything Sherlock said made sense so far. Maybe he was telling the truth after all. John did feel like this man did not belong here the moment he laid eyes on him.
"Okay, let me have your hand" John said
When John lifted his head from the mountain of paperwork on the desk, he realized by the ache in his neck that he had been sitting there for hours. The place around him was in semi-darkness and silence.
Everyone retired to their bedroom for some rest after double checking that the house was secure. John and Sherlock headed to their room as well.
I've posted half of this couple of days ago and deleted it, and now I'm posting it again with some changes and added parts. I'm sorry, I know this is annoying, but I was very hesitant about the plot.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Sherlock glared, knowing exactly what Mycroft was on about.
"Sarah. Will you go with her? Will you leave?"
"Well, I totally misjudged you. Picking up a fight on your second day, that's got to be a record"
"Doesn't mean she should get an eyeful!"
Dazed, he leans and tries to catch John's lips with his mouth, but John moves back abruptly. The bastard.
Thanks very much for reading.
"Sherlock, wait just one moment." Greg grabs his arm to stop him. Sherlock doesn't meet his eye and just stares at the cab door handle.
He was vaguely aware of the sounds and pleas he was making. It must have been embarrassing, but he couldn't care with John's warm hand working his erection, his thumb stroking the slit and drawing small circles on the head. He wasn't going to last long, but John seemed out of it too, so he let go.
"He's wasted" another voice, this one huskier, said from above
"Sir, are you alright? Have you been taking anything?"
"You must have planned everything when Bill sent the invitations last month." John said. "Does it have to do with Amy? Your friend who committed suicide?"
The boy grabbed Sherlock's hand as he got up "Come on!"
"I'll be right there" John said and went to scrub in, but the nurse stopped him "The patient wants to meet you" John froze. He was never good at this, at soothing and reassuring, it was one of the reasons he became a surgeon rather than a GP, but this was part of any doctor's job nonetheless, and he had to do it. He didn't hate it, but he never knew what to say. He loathed false assurances, but this procedure was standard enough, the patient was going to be fine, no need to fret about it. When he entered the room and saw the patient, his heart skipped a beat. The patient was not fully conscious, already a bit groggy, but his eyes were open and looking directly into John's eyes.  "You're going to be fine" John said confidently, but something in the man's eyes made his throat tight and his hands shaky. He turned and left the room.
"Please call me John" he said as he attempted to pat her back awkwardly.
At that, Mycroft did turn to him. He looked like he was searching Sherlock's face for something.
"Oh I won't, even Mr. Genius here didn't know it was me"
He started peeling off his clothes. The heavy coat fell to the floor, followed by shirt and trousers, revealing flawless ivory in their wake. John sighed in relief as he did not see any serious injuries. He took a deep breath as he led the pliable body to the bathroom. He made Sherlock sit on the edge of the tub as he ran warm water and got his first aid kit.
Greg removed his cover and reached for his clothes, grunting in discomfort.
"Ugh, John, I may have to get back on my word and leave right this instant."
As he watched rain drops slipping lazily on the glass, Sherlock wondered what water tasted like. He had always wondered about taste, always marveled at people's fascinations with foods and drinks and... well, kisses. He stopped his mind immediately, he had a job to do and it was no time to let his strange fantasies take him to unfamiliar territories of his equally strange brain.
I hope this is posted in the right time, I feel like it's too late or something, but I couldn't post it earlier
"John Hamish Watson" He said, and they kissed again.
"Wait." John gasps and his hand flies to clutch Sherlock's wrist. Sherlock lifts his head, startled and worried, and feels his mouth form a tense line, but John reaches to stroke his trembling lower lip with his thumb and kisses his cheek tenderly.
"Fine. Come on." He said as he stepped outside, hearing Bill reaching quickly for his coat and following.
There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.
"Hey now, these things will kill you" Greg said, batting Sherlock's hand away.
He blinked, and Harry was there, smiling at him, clinging to his arm like she always had done, like he was the only family and protection she had. She was laughing as she dragged him to meet Clara.
John fell silent for a moment, looking for the right words,
The sounds around him were a mixture of traffic, people talking, and the deafening mechanic wailing of an ambulance
Sherlock looked everywhere except for the corner where John sat. He took the first opportunity to follow Molly into the kitchen. It seemed that no matter where he turned, he couldn't escape the wounded gaze. He wanted to talk to John, apologize, soothe, but he didn't know how.
The next thing John did was simply stupid, but he was not planning on being taken hostage for the inmates to dangle to the guards any time soon. So, he pulled out the needle from his pocket and shoved it in the hand of the inmate who was grabbing him. Luckily, it seemed that the act was so reckless his assailant did not expect it, so instead of responding, he just recoiled with a yelp of pain.
"Surely you can handle it" John said as he put on his white coat.
"God, this is the solar system thing all over again isn’t it? Just enjoy the view. Look, isn't it amazing?" he gestured at their surroundings.
He was thrown back on the bed by the force of it, and he could feel the sheets being drenched in blood around him. The last thing he saw was the terror on Sherlock's beautiful face before he closed his eyes and gave in to the oblivion.
"Inhale. Exhale" John repeated as he listened to Greg's heartbeat.
But what Sherlock Holmes does not understand, is why he feels jealous right now. At first he doesn't see it, can't put a name to it. He feels hot liquid rage trickling inside him the moment he meets Dr. Sholto. He wonders why he feels like he wants to hold John's hand and lead him away from here. It's ridiculous.
Greg could not stop thinking about what Sherlock said all day. What the hell did he mean? Was this just a ploy to get him to back off and stay away from John? His heart leapt as his phone chime with a text.
He and Anderson searched the infirmary several times, but the little devils were nowhere to be found. He eventually gave up and had to ask Anderson to lock up, hoping he would find them the next day.
Also, sorry if this was case-heavy, but I'm kinda obsessed with mysteries, I spent my entire childhood gobbling every word Agatha Christie ever write.
"Okay." He cleared his throat "Looks good" he said finishing up with the bandage and turning around to get the shot.
"You're just like daddy" Archie whispered to Sherlock, pulling his curls. Sherlock smiled at him.
"Your arm please" he said with complete clinical detachment.
"Will you be going?" John echoed with a smile.
So, it was only natural that he seized the opportunity to take this job. A prison doctor may not be the best pay or the easiest circumstances for a retired soldier, but it provided just what he needed. The full use of his skills as a doctor and a soldier, though the latter was not officially in the job description. Since he had started this job, his nightmares have been less severe, though not completely at bay, and he hadn't been feeling like he was going insane.
“Not on my table”
Greg swallowed audibly at the sight that confirmed all his suspicions and fantasies, John’s cock was mouth-wateringly huge, hanging heavily between his thick but fit thighs. He was uncircumcised, foreskin pulled back a bit revealing the flushed tip which was glistening with precum. Greg’s hand moved faster, now fisting at his cock and feeling drops of precum wetting his pants.
"If I could make you understand..." Sherlock began.
"Well, there was someone else, there must have been, that's what I've been saying for two years."
"Visiting hours have been over since 8"
"You can't do it" She started laughing too and leaned in for a kiss.
"Is this how you've been helping Lestrade, then? You've been helping him solve crimes?"
"John, um ... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for any ..."
John stood in the park in the spot where they kissed for the first time. He lifted his hands to rub at his eyes "God, help me through this" he muttered.
His eyes open fully two hours later, judging by the direction of sunbeams on the wall. He realizes his phone has been buzzing in his pocket. He pulls it out and stares at a text from Lestrade on his screen. Case, double murder. Excellent, just what he needed.
The receptionist was startled at the movement and looked like she was about to kick him out, but as he glanced behind her he saw a familiar face
"Told you to stay away doc., but did you listen?"
And then Jon was kissing him again, stronger and more passionate this time. He ran a hot tongue on Sherlock's closed lips, making him shiver and open his mouth instinctively. Then, something strange happened. Sherlock felt a dire urge to taste the wet soft tongue, and he couldn't stop himself from chasing it into John's mouth. He sucked on it for a moment before opening his eyes and looking at John, searching his face for disapproval, but John looked as wrecked as he felt, and he plunged his tongue into Sherlock's mouth, tasting, licking, and biting urgently.
"What? Are you alright?"
Sherlock’s hips pushed up one last time, and he came in John’s mouth with a scream. Greg didn’t let go, and neither did John, they persisted, until Sherlock's body started twitching in discomfort, cock completely milked by John's warm mouth.
“How did you know my name?”
"Oh, he's a genius." John shrugs as if this is the most normal thing to say, but he is used to explaining this quite often to people. This and apologize repeatedly to them on his neighbor's behalf.
"Can Mummy go too?"
"The doctor said you shouldn't overexert yourself."
"No round three then?" John says with his sexy morning voice, and Sherlock curses again as he remembers. They did it TWICE! Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night and decided he wanted to suck John off while he was asleep, but John did wake up and flipped him over on his back. As he remembers the obscene noises that ensued, Sherlock feels thankful that Mrs. Hudson is away in Bristol with her sister.
"Piss off Mycroft. John and I are going home"
"You going out for a walk too? I'll come along, need some fresh air." Bill's voice came from behind and Sherlock turned. His cheeks were flushed from the wine he had, and he had a knowing smile on his face. Sherlock's heart jumped at the thought that Bill might have guessed what was going on, but there was no time, he had to follow John and keep him as far as possible from that unsavory woman.
They kiss, and Sherlock's hand magically manages to place his tea on the counter as he melts into John's lips. He moans softly, he loves it when John tilts his head a bit. It makes the kiss is deeper and even sweeter.
Here we go, John thought, one more person who won't believe it, won't see it. He sighed and pinched between his eyes as he felt the beginning of a headache approaching.
Sherlock hopes his face doesn't betray the stab of pain he feels at the sound of John's name. He blinks, trying to collect himself.
"So, where are you from?" Molly asked while handing everyone drinks, and John waited eagerly to hear the answer.
The trip to the hospital was a 10-minute battle to keep medics from poking at his face and forcing him to stay still. He refused to lie in a stretcher or sit in a chair, and once they arrived, he fled their gloved hands and entered the hospital's reception area running
"Because I knew you'd do it for him"
"Maybe he was afraid it would look like he's leading us to it." Sherlock said. "Or maybe he's worried I'd ask him if he
"Stop provoking inmates and officers, or you're going to get killed in here, you know" John did not know why he said this, but it felt necessary to say it anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, not now” he said through heavy breaths and gasps “come inside me, I want to feel you.”
"He didn't tell you" Greg said, eyes a bit wide.
"Why don't you ever touch me?"
A theory was taking shape in his mind. Everything clicked into place except for one part… John. What did John see?
"Mrs. Hudson, will you please stop badgering my guest!" Sherlock's voice came from upstairs just as the music came to a halt.
"John! We'll never find them, it's pitch black out here!"
Thanks to whoever's reading, have a wonderful day :)
"Did you tell her the truth?"
John smiled at him amusedly and continued.
It's painful though, this odd burning sensation that won't relent, like a hot ember slowly burning its way into his insides. Maybe he's about to go down with the flu, because he feels feverish and nauseous. He must remember to ask John to get him an antibiotic.
Greg walked quietly, sat in the chair and watched transfixed as John kissed and bit at Sherlock's exposed neck, his mouth moving in sensual sweeps across the pale skin.
John chuckled softly and pointed to the seat "May I?"
"That was boring" he said, glaring at the officer's motionless body.
The translucent eyes bore into John, making him feel exposed, but he could not help trusting the stranger. He couldn’t explain why it felt like the man had been waiting for him there, as if this was meant to happen, and the words came out of their own accord.
John was sitting in front of the fire when he heard something at the door.
Sherlock was looking intently at him, but when John met his gaze he noticed he hadn't been looking at his face, but rather at the silver bracelet around his wrist. John withdrew slowly and slipped his hands in the pockets of his jeans.
Everything happened in what felt like seconds, John had turned his back on the room to get a syringe when he heard a thump and a muffled groan. All he could do in the precious moment he had was shove the needle in his pocket to hide it, he turned and as expected, saw smith on the floor grabbing his head and groaning. He felt is vision blur as someone hit him from behind and something sharp was pressed to his neck. The largest of the inmates was holding him in a death grip, and another one reached and took the handcuffs from Smith's belt and handed them to John.
“I might have an idea” Sherlock whispered to Greg with a strange smile before he followed John out of the crime scene.
"I… I met this guy… I bumped into him and we got something to eat."
"Alright then." Rupert said calmly. "If I had Lidiya's body, then how the hell did we find it in the woods? I was right behind you, I could not have had the time to put the body there, go back and then follow you. And if I had carried her body, you would have seen it of course"
“I lost a patient”
Amazing. How was this man real? John felt like he was in the presence of an otherworldly being. Sherlock moved with the grace of a ballet dancer, but there was something else about him, as if he was surrounded by a halo separating him from the world. He seemed far and forbidden, but it did not stop John's heart from hammering every time he was on the receiving end of the piercing gaze.
"John, to what do I owe the pleasure?"
It was a creature of pure light, with a face emanating waves of white glow in the darkness. Ethereal eyes gazed back at John with a mixture of serenity and child-like curiosity. They were a delightful swirl of colors; blue, green, and flecks of silver.
"He was a brilliant surgeon though at the start of his career, he was the best. But one day he lost a patient on his table. It was a routine surgery… text book. No one knew what happened. They started an investigation, but nothing was certain."
"And…?" John stared at him.
“It's my job to keep their bodies from giving out. Or what am I doing here?”
John entered the examination room to find Sherlock waiting for him, sleeve rolled up.
John opened his mouth to ask what he meant, but Sherlock lifted a finger to his lips, eyes going wide.
As soon as the door opened, John found himself on the receiving end of a crushing hug. Greg had recovered quite nicely judging by the pats bordering on painful he was administering to John's back.
"Well yes… with the riot and all. They breached cell block, I heard it on the radio." John said, though he felt unsure under Sherlock's skeptical gaze.
"Shit." John's face drained of color "You think it's someone… here."
to love you as I love you!"
It was dark, and the immediate sensory input was of a warm body in his arms and another looming over his head. He felt his arms unconsciously wrap themselves tighter around Sherlock as he blinked repeatedly in the dark, feeling cold metal against his temple.
"Yeah, good. The surgery went really well."
E. E. CUMMINGS
The moment the door is shut behind them, Sherlock feels a million different emotions at once. Too many to identify and file, but all he wants is to be with John, kiss him, and hold him even for just a bit. It might be the last time he could.
“Are you in despair?”
"… How?"
Sherlock opened his eyes in alarm, looked at him, and then looked at the other man. John could see the moment he realized what was happening, but there was no time to talk.
What had he hoped? What did he want to say? Why is he suddenly staring behind Sherlock at the door to his flat like he wants to run away?
"Do you know where he is?"
"How long does this take?" He asked as John swiped a drop of blood from his finger on a strip.
Sholto looks at Sherlock with an inquiring smile and John clears his throat quickly.
"I'm okay. Here, give me that, what did I trip on?" John grabbed the phone from Sherlock's hand and the puddle of light spilled on the ground.
break out the reeds, and the delicate streams,
"Come on Myc, let's get drinks." Lestrade says as he wraps an arm around Mycroft. "This was supposed to be a fun night for the two of us, remember?" John hears Lestrade's trailing voice as they walk away.
"Of course it was. It was quite extraordinary." John grinned.
"I'm going with you" John said.
John and Sherlock try to leave, but it's not as easy as they think.
"Sherlock" Greg called to him before he was all the way out, and Sherlock turned back and waited.
“You're not ill?”
"More of a compulsory acquaintance, I'm afraid. So, what do we have here?"
"No." John shook his head.
'New fish'
"Wrong." Sherlock said "His face was still bandaged, but I grabbed a hold of him, so I can tell you he is of a medium build. We also know he's a man. A woman would not have been physically able to carry Lidiya's body and lift an axe that size above her head so easily unless she was athletic, which I know isn't true because I felt his body."
------
Greg was the first to regain his wits and tucked himself in hastily. He wanted to leave before it began to feel awkward and they had to 'talk about it' or something. But right as he crossed the bedroom door, he heard Sherlock's voice calling him. He turned around. John was lying in Sherlock's arms, his breath slow and deep and his eyes shut, clearly dozing.
I know this lacks romance but I promise lots of fluff is on the way. Thanks to whoever is reading, you're awesome and I hope you have an amazing weekend :)
"I do not pout! And I am certainly not adorable!" Sherlock objects indignantly, "Besides, you can't deduce my face expressions based on the sounds of doors opening and closing."
Sherlock just stood there, tilting his head as he maintained intense eye contact with him.
But hope vanished as quickly as it had come. John had a girlfriend. John had a life. Maybe he wouldn't want Sherlock after all.
"Um... I can't remember, some of them were changing and I looked away and shut the doors quickly." He fell silent, but he furrowed his brows as if he was remembering something.
It occurs to him that Sherlock must have deduced his past with James by now. He looks at him, but Sherlock's face is closed and expressionless.
"Who are you visiting? Mr. Lestrade?"
"Oh please, enough of this nonsense." Everyone turned to him in shock, but he went on "I don't feel sorry for you… You killed Lidiya to avenge Amy's death, but then you tried to kill John just to cover up your tracks. That's not justice, you're not a hero. You're just an axe murderer."
"I'm one of the bad guys, remember?" Sherlock answered with a smile as they left the room and headed for the visitation section. The electricity was out, which could only mean that the police was surrounding the facility and attempting to strip the prisoners of their defenses.
Sherlock moved his neck, feeling every muscle protesting. He stared at the faces looking from above
"I keep forgetting how much you still haven't tried" John said while opening the bag and taking out the fruit "and I wanted you to try it"
"The patient is ready for you"
Lorca
John had been quite excited about this bizarre trip to some forest in the middle of nowhere in Wales. He had been invited by an old friend by the name of Bill Murray to stay at his family's estate there along with a group of other friends for Halloween, and Sherlock was practically dragged into the affair.
They all sat in the dining room after deciding to wait for Lidiya for a bit before freaking out.
His mind was still not recovered from the storm of confusion and hurt, yet he was haunted by Sherlock's face everywhere he went. His imagination creating an illusion of the long slender figure in random places, but Sherlock had vanished as suddenly as he had appeared in John's life.
He looked confused but answered anyway "What? Gandhi? I think so."
"Anyway, I
"You know, for someone who's married to their work, you sure spend an awful lot of time in my flat" John cannot conceal the bitterness from his voice, but Sherlock doesn't seem to notice anything.
"Learn that at boarding school, posh boy?"
Soon, they were completely gone. Sherlock huffed in annoyance. He looked at Bill, only to find him sporting the most annoying smile, accompanied with a quirk of the eyebrow.
He was there in a blink of an eye, but he could not bear to let John see him now, not yet.
The man didn't seem to hear anything.
Little did John know then that he had created a monster. Sherlock spent hours staring into his new microscope, marveling at everything he saw. He made it a mission to cram everything he could on the tiny slot and stare at it for hours on end.
"No." Attend a party? With people? Nope, Sherlock's had quite enough of that when he used to live with his rich parents, hated it then and hates it now. The only case he'd go is if there is a serial killer lurking among the attendees.
"What?"
John made his morning round, discharging patients who were in no need of staying over much longer at the infirmary. By now he was getting rather good at identifying those who were feigning just to avoid the yard for a bit longer. Unfortunately, he could not accommodate them as the infirmary was already overburdened and understaffed as it is.
"If this is all you are...these cells, then when they die, that's the end"
"I came to take Mr. Wilson... and I saw you" Sherlock said miserably, feeling hurt and despair closing in. "I couldn't take my eyes off you. How you fought for him… And you looked right at me... like I was a man!"
"Are you alright? Who the hell was that?" Bill yelled, making Sherlock snap out of his shock. He quickly released John, who looked flustered and confused.
"It's a forest. Jungles are in tropical areas."
Sherlock rolled his sleeve and John swabbed the side of his arm with alcohol and administered the injection, feeling the piercing gaze on him.
"Someone is coming" he whispered "come on."
She was right of course. They needed time together, to remember and put a shape to whatever they had. He and Sarah were always on good terms because they understood that the job came first, and that each one of them leads an independent life from the other. They've always given each other space and time, and this was how it worked. Sarah was kind and beautiful and had known him for a long time, but John felt like something was missing. He thought of how easy it was to talk to Sherlock. It was depressing to think that in two conversations he had shared with him more than he ever did with Sarah.
"I suppose I've always known this was never going to be enough for you. You were always too thirsty to see more"
Of course, they pretended it was for the case, but in reality no progress was actually happening. Jefferson Hope was nowhere to be found. Fortunately, a list of all his clients was found in his flat. Excluding those who have yet to complete a year of marriage, and those who were no longer together, all couples were made aware of the threat and were assigned protection in hope of catching the psychopath red-handed. However, Hope had yet to attack any more couples, and so, all they could do for now was wait.
"John, I realize your observation skills are quite primitive, so I would like to call your attention to the fact that there is only one bed in here." Sherlock said as he dumped his bag on the floor
"You know, I've never really shared with anyone who you are or what you do. I mean, Anderson and Donovan obviously know by now, but I never told any other… colleagues"
"It all started with another case I was working on before I came here. We knew the Italian mob had been striking more drug deals lately, bigger even, but no one knew with whom. I traced their transactions to here. Just as I suspected, they've been smuggling the drugs into the prison."
"You ought to have more faith in me, little brother. I do care about your personal life as you very well know." Mycroft feigned a hurt expression, but took out a file from the inside pocket of his jacket all the same. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Who called the police?" he asked John from the far end of the room.
Pablo Neruda
Later, John lied awake in bed, listening to the faint sounds of the street outside. Sarah had fallen asleep hours ago. He looked at her with resentment, because really, how can she sleep so quickly! How can people do that?
"What if I do?"
So, when his ear caught the soft click of a gun's safety catch being turned off, he opened his eyes, immediately trying to register his surroundings.
They stood there, chest to chest, connected in every way, and it felt like heaven. Tenderness quickly turned into passionate heat as John licked into his mouth. Sherlock simply followed his lead, ready to receive whatever John gave him.
"Looks like your heart is recovering nicely"
after John. Why? Sherlock didn't have time to think, he got up and launched himself at the attacker, grabbing him around the waist before he could reach John.
"Now. Shoot Mr. Holmes, or I'll shoot you both." He said calmly.
After some waiting, the coast seemed clear, Sherlock had peered through the door to see if anyone was outside before he told John he would get him out through the visitation room.
What's more, some of them were outrageously horrid, even more so than John's real middle name. Sherlock must have deduced it was a stupid name, based on his absolute refusal to share it.
is overweight." He quite enjoyed the look of utter shock on everyone's faces.
"Yes. That's your blood alright, mate"
"You got backbone, showing yourself like that, mate. I appreciate that. It'll make it easier." Greg said casually. "I got to tell you though, I feel fine. You might want to check your orders because I sure don't feel like I'm dying."
"So, what about those deaths?"
"What about you?"
They joined the others at the table, Sherlock sat next to John. He had no intention of letting him out of his sight as long as they were in that damn place. He surveyed the group. Everyone looked tense, exhausted, and terrified. There was no way to tell for sure if any of them was the culprit, but all the clues led to that conclusion.
The man's face broke into the most beautiful smile John had ever seen. It was like a flood of light, blindingly gorgeous, and John smiled back.
"Oh, go on dear, don't let me keep you. You boys have fun."
Mycroft contemplated this quietly, then he wrapped an arm around him "I'm sorry." was all he said.
Sherlock felt an odd twinge at the faith this man was obviously putting in him. Why did he care what this stranger thought of him anyway? He quickly wore his usual cold expression and slipped into his element.
"Doing what?"
"I’ll let you in on something, John." Sherlock says as he stares at the dance floor.
"Stay down. Let me see your eyes, I need to check if you have a concussion."
"Are you alright?" Sherlock said, watching him with concern. John's hand moved without permission, and covered Sherlock's elegant, pale fingers still resting on his shoulder.
And the words went through Sherlock like cold wind. He felt himself shrink. The world had never been smaller, and he had never been more alone.
"Mind telling me what you're doing here. This isn't your jurisdiction as I trust everyone has been informing you repeatedly." He cast a look in Anderson's direction, who lifted his hand in surrender and left the room.
Suddenly the woman gave him a strangely cunning smile and a wink that did not look the least appropriate on her kind, delicate face. John frowned.
"No… not that I know of. The surrounding land is property of my family, so anyone here is trespassing. I have no idea who that might have been."
"No parents"
On one hand he couldn't risk revealing that snogging a prisoner had resulted in said prisoner nicking his keys, on the other, he didn't want Sherlock to be thrown in solitary confinement. He was in enough trouble as it was.
"But you didn't?"
"Now where and why would a suburban husband get a gun like that?" He whispered more to himself than to anyone around. He was so deep in thought that he flinched slightly when his phone started ringing "Here we go" he said wearily and stood up straight to answer.
Just before he got in his car he quickly typed a text, hesitating before hitting send, but then thought Sherlock wasn't the kind to want to miss this.
John nods, trying to calm his racing heart. He watches Sherlock watching James leave, not knowing what to say.
Don't know if I'd done that properly, so if you have any feedback please go ahead!
The next day, John waited patiently for Sherlock's appointment. He had searched the place one more time and made sure the keys were not actually there.
"Mike! Where's John?"
"Obvious. You don't seem like a man who wears jewelry, and yet you have a silver bracelet. Looks expensive too, you wouldn't waste money on such an item. It's a keepsake, but it wasn't given to you. The expense of it says wife, not girlfriend, but you already said you have never been married when I mentioned it earlier at the crime scene.
"No… not that I know of." John gave him a confused look.
"Ugh. Don't go all soft on me now Lestrade. Just keep bloody Anderson out of my face and we'll call it even."
A cloud of dust and death engulfed everything around him. His heart was racing, but his hands were still steady, as he took deep breaths, inhaling the scent of blood and decay around him. For a moment, everything was in slow motion as he crouched with his medical supplies hugged to his chest, and then a yelp came from somewhere and his entire body was on alert and moving. He stared ahead but he could only see silhouettes running amidst the screen of sand that covered everything, then he heard a whisper to his left. He crawled to where the sound came from. It was so dark that he was startled when he felt a body right in front of him.
"To fall to Earth. You take the plunge, the tumble, the dive… You jump off a bridge, leap out a window. You just make up your mind to do it and you do it"
"That's good"
"So is he here?"
"To take Mr. Wilson?" John repeated.
The smells though were the most fascinating element thus far. The salty, hot odor of sweat and blood, intertwined with the cold sweet scent of the rain. So much input. So much data to file and categorize
They were silent again for a couple of minutes. Sherlock seemed to be deep in thought until he spoke again.
He reached clumsily for his bicycle, turned around stiffly, and walked away.
"First I needed to be there, but then I wanted to be there… with you"
"John," Sherlock leaned back to look at him properly "I… I care. I care so much. I don't know what I would have done…" He struggled to find the right words. He didn't know how to say this. The feeling was so immense that it couldn't possibly be put into a proper sentence
"Just stay." John whispered again, closing his eyes "Just stay until I fall asleep."
But quick! So that joined together, and one,
When love beckons to you, follow him,
"This is Susan. She's our talented actress" Bill pointed at the prettier of the two women, she was blonde and had piercing green eyes. Wedding band mark on her finger, recent, Sherlock noted.
This is all stolen from an episode of Case Closed. Though when I watched it in my language it was simply called Detective Conan, and yes that's a reference to ACD, as this brilliant anime is inspired by him.
Everyone gasped in horror, and John visibly shuddered.
"And by YOUR specimens, I suppose you mean cadavers people have generously donated for the sake of scientific research, not the entertainment of a bored detective without cases."
John hesitated, still smiling.
"Yeah. So?"
"I fell"
"Oh, not to worry doc., you and your boyfriend here will be just another two victims of this chaos. We even have the law on our side," he let out an ugly laugh, revealing yellow broken teeth.
John's eyes grew a bit wide the moment he spotted Sherlock on the bench, and he stopped and smiled
"What?"
John shook his head repeatedly and closed his eyes as if he couldn't stand to look at Sherlock anymore.
"Dr. Stamford, this man is asking for Dr. Watson and I'm afraid he isn't around" the receptionist said, looking at Mike, apparently hoping he would ask Sherlock to leave
"I got news for you, Sherlock, 'trust me' means absolutely zero inside these walls. The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it."
Sherlock melted into John's arms, his mind involuntarily still analyzing and filing away emotions: pleasure, fulfillment, happiness, contentedness, love.
Greg started slowing down, taking down his pace to lick and kiss rather than fuck and suck. Just as he licked at Sherlock’s perineum, he felt John’s tongue brushing his mouth. Unable to restrain himself, he pushed forward and sucked on the warm pink tongue for a moment, at which he felt himself shake with pleasure and come violently in his pants. It felt so good it almost hurt.
"Yeah. Thanks"
"I'm a detective John, not a psychic. Are those medications making you hallucinate?"
"Early enough. I got the chance to hear your conversation with Mr. Knight. There's no point trying to interrogate him at the moment, he is clearly in shock. We need to go to the crime scene, John"
"We'll release your friend Lestrade tomorrow"
She chuckled and her face relaxed "You're just tired." She moved closer, invading his space. He could just catch the flowery smell of her hair as her hand went up, gently stroking his bicep
"I'll ask Bill, and we'll see if we can swap rooms with anyone." He said as he opened the window to look outside "looks like the storm they talked about is going to be worse than expected."
"You're 10 minutes late. You've stopped by somewhere, but it wasn't far. You hold whatever you brought delicately so it must be tender or breakable. Obviously you wouldn't buy eggs now, and we still have some anyway. Fruit then, since it's in a paper bag, red, judging by the smudge on the tips of your fingers. Strawberries, because you like them most."
"Yeah? So?"
"Where is he, then?" John heard Sherlock ask behind him.
John ignored her, "call me when he's ready to talk" he said and beckoned Sherlock outside.
"Says the man who invaded Afghanistan" Sherlock smirked.
"Stop that"
Yes. It would be most inconvenient to disturb this arrangement. Yes. That's probably it. Sherlock sighs in relief. Theory accepted.
"My plans?" John grinned.
"Stop bossing me around. I never wanted to come in the first place." Sherlock said. He really hadn't wanted to come, but for one thing he couldn't say no to John and his stupid handsome face, and he also didn't want to be away from him for an entirety of three days.
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
"Uh… Yeah, he… does that… on the side"
"I'm coming by." The last text from Greg read.
Take joy from the fresh landscape of my wound,
"Oh. She seemed to think we're… I'm… your boyfriend or something." He let out a nervous laugh. Sherlock remained silent and extracted one of the files from the box. He sat in a black chair by the fireplace and started skimming through the pages.
"Please. You're not dating anyone"
"But you are in distress."
"I don't think it was a prank." Sherlock's voice was still shaken. He cleared his throat before speaking again. "Does anyone else have a property in the area?" he asked Bill.
He didn't know how long it was before he felt himself being gently held. Familiar warmth and scent kept him from panicking again as he opened his eyes. He was still on the floor, with John staring down at him, and everyone else standing around them. Sherlock grunted in paint as he tried to get up. John's arm circled his shoulder protectively.
"Is there anything else?" Sherlock quirked an eyebrow, strangely looking amused.
"His family's having a welcome-home party"
and so, this is done, thanks to anyone who's reading. If you think this isn't too bad and I should write more fics please leave a comment or kudos or whatever, I do have ideas for more!
John had what felt like the first of many arguments with Sherlock about him staying behind, leaving John to enter the photographer's flat. His brilliant conclusion was indeed correct, all couples had had the same wedding photographer: Jefferson Hope.
"Tell me." John almost whispered, his voice uneven
Then, Sherlock apparently snaps out of it, as he gives him a warm smile, snatches the key, and leaves without a word.
"The floor in our room is dry."
"Stop acting like children!" Sherlock snapped at them. He couldn't hear himself thinking with them moaning around him.
He dives to cross underneath the police tape and lifts his arm to hail a cab.
John makes some important discoveries.
"Very well. I will inform D.I. Lestrade that you shall give your statements later. Go home and take a shower, you smell like prison."
"Yes?" she said over the sound of gentle music coming from somewhere inside.
"What about your girlfriend? Do you love her?"
"Refreshing, juicy, rich with sweetness, but with a tone of sourness. Tender on your tongue like velvet, but sharp as they dissolve, leaving an aromatic flavor in your mouth" He paused "How is that?"
"You know you could have solved this case from your flat, but you were too bored weren't you Sherlock" Mycroft said, sighing in exasperation "I hope you had fun being tortured by the Italian mob and getting stuck in a bloody prison riot."
"But surely you've deduced. I'm one of the donors."
"John…"
"Why would anyone want to do that though?"
"Bloody hell, Sherlock. If you're trying to kill me just feed me something out of your fridge, that'd be quicker than trying to give me a heart attack, you git." He says as he flicks the light on.
At this point, Sherlock is almost shouting, his wrists still caged under John's hands, and suddenly, words tumble out of his mouth without thought or permission.
his broad shoulders twitched a couple of times with the aftershocks, then he regained himself slowly, and started kissing Sherlock’s eyes and cheeks and neck softly just as he slipped free out of him
"Sleeping slows me down, and I need to think."
"No, I just believe in you." He answered simply, no hint of hesitation in his weakened voice, and took Sherlock's hand to his lips to plant a soft kiss there.
"I daresay my little brother does indeed count as my business."
He leaned over the table, extracted a nicotine patch and stuck it next to the one that was already on his arm. He tried to focus his attention on the experiment in his hands, though every cell in his body was urging him to think of one thing: Cocaine.
"Alright. Get in the water. It'll warm you up"
(See the end of the chapter for
He was. Greg stood frozen, staring at John and Sherlock locked in an embrace on the bed. John was on top of Sherlock's body, moving minutely as he kissed him. They were kissing so warmly, so lovingly, and yet it was the sexiest thing he'd ever seen.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?"
Sherlock twisted in the bed to lie on his side facing John.
"I want to see you. Please. Let me see you."
"I know. I'm sorry. Does anything else hurt? Did you hit your head?"
That's what the CO's and con's called the new batch of inmates arriving at Pentonville. New fish being dumped into the tiny, already overcrowded bowl.
He rang the bell to 221B, but when the door opened, it wasn't a grumpy pale face with eyes like supernovas, but rather an old woman in a purple night gown looking suspiciously at him.
Sherlock ignores him and goes to get in the cab, the sooner this conversation ends, the better.
"Yeah, we uh… played rugby together at uni." John says, though he looks suspicious, he must know what's coming.
"You're sweating."
"Yes well, Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake. That's why they're fun."
Sherlock smiled weakly at this. After all this time, Mycroft was still trying to protect him. To spare him the pain that came with associating with the unpredictable and messy creatures that were humans. Sherlock had had Mycroft on his side for as long as he could remember. He never tried to question or explain it, but he believed he would always count on that unconditional affection and guidance. It was surprising, really, that Mycroft didn't understand Sherlock's love for John, when he himself had given Sherlock nothing but love and protection.
Sherlock knew Mycroft could not take it. His love for John was an eternal imprint that would never be wiped away, so he wandered the streets, watching the aimless succession of night and day across the heavens, until one night, he heard it.
"Oh, about 10 seconds. Slide this drip into the meter and we're ready to go." John answered, holding out the device so that Sherlock could see. The screen said "Processing."
"Street gang" Sherlock says. "Dispute over drug transactions."
Rupert started to visibly sweat, but he didn't utter a word. Sherlock went on.
So, things were worse than usual. The prisoners whooped and cheered around him. John exchanged a quick look with Smith, who continued talking over the radio
"What do you mean?" the daughter said
Sherlock reached a hand and threaded his fingers through John's hair, just as he bit delicately on his lower lip, but at that moment John suddenly became conscious of what he was doing and he pulled back abruptly.
"Because of your gun"
"It's not my hospital, Sherlock, I just work there." John says as he moves behind the counter separating the kitchen from the living room and starts making tea.
"What are your parents' names?"
Have a great day/ night everyone. Love xoxoxoxo
"Mrs. Wilson?" He said to the red-headed woman sitting on the chair. Next to her sat a younger woman who had to be the daughter. Mrs. Wilson looked cheerful and unperturbed, oh god, she wasn't worried at all!
Sherlock turned around and met his eyes "I saw you on the monitor in the officers' surveillance room after the prisoners broke into it" he shrugged.
A rickety old thing that had no affair being called a bridge stood ahead of them just as they emerged from under the canopy of trees. It was hanging over a rushing stream flowing deep below within the confines of its bed. The erosion patterns on either sides of the riverbed clearly indicated it often flooded to higher levels, Sherlock noted as he started crossing right behind John.
"No. I'm just cold"
"Eating is boring" Sherlock said with a pout, reaching again for John and wrapping his arms around him.
He got in the passenger seat next to John, who turned to look at him before starting the car.
"What is it?" Sherlock asked him, though he thought he knew what was wrong.
"I'd go sleep in Lidiya's room, but I'd rather we stay together." John said, his hand left scratching at his nape.
An embarrassing noise escapes Sherlock's mouth as he feels John's tongue flicking on his hole, his whole body wriggles helplessly while John continues to lick between his cheeks. His hand automatically flies to stroke his cock but John somehow catches it and grabs the other one too. He presses Sherlock's hands on the bed on either side of him and settles again between his thighs. Sherlock whimpers, feeling fat drops of precum creating wet patches on his stomach, and John never relents.
"There is nothing here that you can't get on a screensaver on any standard PC."
"I'll just take a moment to catch my breath" he said panting "Breath!" he giggled, and the woman's eyes went wider
John and Sherlock get to talk some more. Sherlock is acting suspicious for some reason.
He felt good about today, he had been working at Bart's for two years now, gaining a fairly good reputation as a cardiothoracic surgeon. He rarely lost any patients, and he liked to keep it that way. 'Focus. Follow procedure. Be prepared. Don't let them die on your table.
"We've got a serial killer on our hands, detective."
"Here what are?"
"I… I just wanted to talk to you about something."
John was torn between the impulse to utter a variant of the word 'amazing' and punch him, but all that came out was a short laughter.
"John, something is wrong." Sherlock whispered to John as they walked behind the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg looked reluctant and lost for words for a bit, but he seemed to make up his mind as he began talking again.
"He'll tell you all about it." He turned to face Sherlock "He's waiting for you at the crime scene inside. I've asked them to leave the bodies and everything else they found exactly the way they found it. I was pretty vague with him. I told him that you were someone who worked for me, someone I trust. Take a look and tell me what you think."
"Mrs. Lestrade… Molly Lestrade"
"Oh, are you superstitious now?" John asked, laughing.
"Can I help you?" Sherlock asked Molly, smiling at the boy.
"Did you see anything strange? Bandages or a cape or anything out of the ordinary?"
The device beeped and John and Sherlock turned to it in unison, though Sherlock could not see the result from his angle.
John had returned from Afghanistan with a shattered shoulder and a starved addiction to adrenaline. His struggle reached the verge of breakdown before he decided to do something about it. He tried to consider what adrenaline junkies usually did to satisfy their peculiar urges. Some of them played rough sports, but John's rugby days were over the moment a bullet pierced a hole right above his pectoral muscle. Others found jobs that provided a sense of danger similar to that of the war, like security guards, firefighters, and body guards. But one of the reasons that had made John feel balanced and functional in the military was the utilization of his medical skills as well as his combat skills.
Not good, very not good. John started replacing the gauze quickly and efficiently, trying to clear his head.
"J.H. We need to find the photographer, now!"
The moment he reached the door, he could hear the inmates successfully breaking in the room he just left, but as expected, the old door did not budge no matter how much he tried to open it.
"I have been watching you, detective inspector. I know you have been after me, but you can't stop this. You see, I'm at the verge of acquiring groundbreaking findings."
Lidiya was taller and lankier than Susan. She was wearing a black velvet choker that made her neck look even longer than it was. Her delicate thin fingers twitched unnoticeably (not to Sherlock though) as she smiled to them.
"Sarah asked me to go away with her" John said with clipped tones, as if every word cost him so much.
"It didn't give way." Sherlock said, pointing at the two pillars on either side. "Look at the marks. Someone cut the ropes off with something sharp… like an axe."
Everyone but John and Sherlock stared at him in shock. And Lidiya's fork fell on the floor with a loud clatter.
-------
John clasps his left hand around Sherlock's cock and buries his face again under his balls. It only takes a couple of strokes for Sherlock to start feeling the delicious tremors of a fantastic orgasm. His body is a ball of flame, seizing with the pleasure, and everything disappears for a moment... or many moments, who knows?
“God, Sherlock!” John panted as he thrusted harder still “You’re so beautiful!”
"Yes. You're right, this is isn't suicide-murder."
Hugs and kisses to whoever's reading! I hope your coffee is delicious and your pillow is fluffy and your hair is on point, happy weekend <3
"Up" Sherlock answered, shrugging.
John was crouching on the bedroom floor, taking photos of the room and bodies from various angles when he heard the front door down stairs. Lestrade's mysterious friend has arrived, it seemed.
"Holmes. I read your file" John said without looking at him.
"Hey, this is Mack in cell block. We've got some cons popping off"
"Sherlock, please. Please be here"
"Are there others… like you?"
John started giggling uncontrollably, possibly due to the rush of adrenaline, and soon Sherlock joined him.
"Choose?"
John’s cum tasted like heaven, and Greg heard himself moan loudly as he licked wider strips of skin, lapping greedily to get every drop.
"I cannot conceive of it!" he yelled again.
Sherlock closed his eyes, and waited for John.
"Come on, don't do this! Damn it, come on! Tom! Come on!"  Suddenly, the doctor lifted his face, desperation painted in his eyes… eyes that for some unfathomable reason connected with Sherlock's. Sherlock stared back… what? What was going on? He couldn’t be looking AT him! Yet the doctor's desperate eyes remained on Sherlock, as if pleading. Sherlock averted his eyes and looked at the man who was now standing on his side and staring down at his lifeless body as if it were strange to him. "Time of death 11:06 am"
“What sort of idea?” Greg heard himself calling after him.
“What terms?”
Pablo Neruda
"You're not dying"
"That's the secret to my sex appeal." John replies and slaps his own bottom.
"Don't fuck it up with him. You deserve to be happy."
"Right. Then how come you're hanging around my room all the time? I'm the only one with his arse hanging out of a dress" he said petulantly.
John stepped in front of Sherlock without thinking, he felt anger rise in his chest as he remembered the agony Sherlock was in when he came to the infirmary with a bloody foot.
The world is a mystery that will never be unraveled. The smell of dry tree leaves, the taste of a hot cup of coffee, the feeling of freshly washed linen. Puzzles everywhere, secrets in fluttering wings and slow kisses and the sound of wind.
"Well, you sure know how to make a guy feel special" and he got up and fled the room.
The stranger smiled and pointed at the badge clipped on John's shirt. John unconsciously lifted a hand to touch it and nodded.
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
"Shut up" Sherlock snapped. He could practically hear the detective's brain working behind him.
Though his voice may shatter your dreams
"Watson. Cloudy today, innit?" Jefferson tried to laugh but it came out as a wet cough.
After what felt like an eternity, he opened his eyes to find John still stroking himself desperately. Without thinking, he descended, placing his forearms on either side of his torso and leaning on them to take John in his mouth. It wasn't long before he felt him shiver underneath him, bitter creamy shots of fluid filling Sherlock's mouth as he felt John still licking lazily at his hole. He swallowed with relish and closed his eyes in utter bliss.
"Will you move in with me?"
"Never better" Lestrade answered, his cough turning into a gruff laugh. John laughed too, said something to the nurse and they both left the room
When they reached the visitation hall, they were in for a surprise as a huge figure appeared, blocking their way.
"That's hypoglycemic. Your body's reacting to the insulin like you're not a diabetic. Are you sure it's Type 1 Diabetes you've got?"
"Hello, John. I did, and I came back" Sholto nods. "It's good to see you. How are you?"
John smiled again “Well, you'd better get out of here, Sherlock, or security's going to think you're a psych patient”
The cab stops outside the hotel and they get off. John hesitates, but then makes up his mind and reaches to hold Sherlock's hand in his without a word. Sherlock stiffens for a moment, but John strokes the back of the soft hand with his thumb until he feels it relaxing under his touch. He turns and smiles at Sherlock, who's staring at their joint hands in what looks like fascination.
clear as a light, and pure as a ring.
"Ready to beg already?" he smiles, his hand stroking Sherlock's stomach, right below his navel and above the beginning of his pubic hair. His whole body feels like it's combusting, but he cannot… will not succumb to John's evil scheme.
"Thanks everyone," John said and stepped out while taking off his apron and latex gloves.
But how could it be? Sherlock's mind raced frantically, they just saw Lidiya being carried by that man across the window! How did he manage to cut her up like this?
"Sister!" Sherlock berated himself "There’s always something."
"This is Smith. A-wing need back up? Over."
Sherlock stirred then, and lifted his head to look at John.
"But why won't you come with me?" John protested
Sherlock slid is face back to John's neck to inhale his musky scent again, now mixed with sex.
"You know, it was an insane time of my life." John says.
"I'm sure, John. If she had her choker on when she died then it should have fallen outside, not here where Bill found it. This only more proof the killer is someone here in this house."
Greg had been talking to Sherlock as if he were one of the many visitors who went in and out of the room all day. Never in front of anyone else though. Sherlock was dumbfounded, but rather intrigued. He had been watching Greg for some time, and the man was most certainly not insane. He was actually speaking to him, and Sherlock was ready to figure what on earth was going on right this moment.
He raised his eyes tentatively, only to find John beaming, eyes twinkling, giving Sherlock that look that always made his stomach flip and his blood dance, a look of pure reverence, and suddenly he was not afraid anymore.
"But you never attend these tedious things." Sherlock gives him a dissecting look, and then smiles maliciously and looks around searchingly. "Oh I see. Where is my dear brother in law, then?"
"Mm?"
"Kiss me" Sherlock managed, and their mouths collided again, ravenously drinking and breathing each other.
It turned out they didn't have to worry, because as soon as they got out to the yard outside, a posh voice was sounding a warning from the chopper.
"What are you talking about?" John was running shaky fingers through his hair and rubbing his face.
"When did you get here?" John stared at him with bloodshot eyes, silver blonde hair sticking out in a way that made Sherlock want to smile for some reason.
"He is right here, ready to play peacemaker between you two prats as usual." a gruff voice comes from behind them and they all turn to face a silver-haired man who looks weary and bored. John has the feeling the man has seen too much of the Holmes' drama in his lifetime. He also looks extremely familiar, but John just can't quite place him.
"You can't possibly know that by looking at him"
"Thank you officer, I'll take it from here" He said to Dimmock. John never liked the man. He was foul and cruel, and rumors of him assaulting prisoners always seemed to have real basis to them.
“Some things are true whether you believe in them or not”
"I don't believe you"
The music was deafening in his ears as he closed his eyes, a blurred swirl of images rushed through his head. For the last time ever, he could hear the murmur of the unseen world. Voices around the earth, begging, crying, laughing, moaning, whispering…
"Are you okay?" Sherlock asked him, his voice cracking as they inhaled the dust now enveloping the room.
"Oh, God forbid." John is still grinning. He stares at his tea for a moment, evidently thinking up a plan to exploit the situation, before he speaks again.
"Morning" John said, trying his best not to sound too soppy as he stared at the perfect face.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know" John's face went pink. "I just froze for some reason. Thankfully Sherlock was there to save my life."
"I'm so glad you made it. I was telling Greg how bad I'd been feeling about being so dreadful to you at the hospital, but well, you know. Greg made me so worried"
“Fuck me hard” Sherlock rasped, and John grabbed a bottle of lube from the bedside table. He started preparing Sherlock slowly and gently, first rubbing at his hole as he kissed his neck and chest, then slipping one finger after the other inside, stretching and loosening the muscles, and angling his hand in a way that made Sherlock gasp and thrust up into the air.
"Look at them. It's obvious," he turned to gesture at the bodies.
"How are you feeling" John asked
"You know you could just walk next to me if you like" Sherlock could hear a smile in his voice, and it was all the invitation he needed.
Halloween! As if the world was not already brimming with useless banalities, Sherlock thought, once again wishing he was back at Baker Street conducting an experiment or waiting for a good case. But John loved Halloween, Sherlock had noticed that. Last October he had brought a bunch of DvD's, all with ludicrous titles involving zombies and vampires. Sherlock had been forced to join in the marathon that time as well, at which he proceeded to fall asleep on the couch and wake up to a very awkward situation, his head resting on John's shoulder and his face almost buried in his neck.
Sherlock stared back with narrowed eyes, inspecting John's face.
John closed the door to their flat, mindful of the bag in his hand.
you are a moaning, a butterfly’s cooing.
John took yet another step and closed the space between them "You won't hurt me" He whispered.
There was a knock on the door minutes later, and Sarah entered
"You don't know what a strawberry tastes like?"
He decided not to wait for John to hand him the file and shuffled through the box on the table to retrieve it.
"Sherlock! Not good!" John whispered, but Sherlock ignored him.
"Sherlock, this is Dr. James Sholto, he taught me at uni. Dr. Sholto, this is Sherlock, my… um… neighbor." John winces at his own stuttering.
John starts to peel off his clothes without breaking the kiss. His hands work swiftly to unfasten and slide off items of clothing. They move slowly towards the small bedroom, and by the time they're there, Sherlock is only in his pants. A trail of clothes lies on the floor from the kitchen to the bed where he stands, shivering as John kisses and sucks at his neck and chest.
But John stepped back as if he was burned by the words, extricating himself from Sherlock's hand
"Do you ever feel like there is something else in there with us… in the operation room I mean. A… force that doesn't care if we put up a fight or not."
"Hello?" He heard the deep voice calling from below.
"Bill, stop. You're making me blush!" She bumped his arm.
"We'll take a look at your blood"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on," he grasps Sherlock's right hand in what he hopes is a reassuring gesture. "Let's go home and I'll tell you all about it."
"What… no, I'm a… friend… colleague" he hastily corrected, though he wasn't sure either word was accurate.
"Take a seat," John said pointing at the examination table. Sherlock walked slowly and sat, still staring at John.
"You're so beautiful" John said and quickly followed him, their pleasure mingling sweetly in the hot water.
"He works with the Yard sometime… Consultation." Greg said, scratching his face. He was evidently a bad liar.
John stopped for a moment, and looked at Sherlock with hooded eyes, gently swiping his thumb over his lower lip.
"Hm?"
Sherlock kissed him again deeply, and pulled him up on his feet. Soon, they were both divested of all clothes and writhing on Sherlock's bed.
"Yes." His voice was deep and strange to his ears.
Sherlock nodded silently
"I think Sherlock's been keeping a lot of secrets lately." Mycroft says as he gives John a knowing look, making heat rise in his face. Sherlock rolls his eyes, turns, and walks away without a word.
"Brilliant" John could not help saying each time Sherlock made another of his deductions, and Sherlock immediately blushed and returned the compliment with a look of absolute adoration.
"Thanks" He gave her a smile, feeling guilty for having been so edgy with her on top of everything else. Sarah did not deserve this.
no flying under my radar"
Sherlock looked around in panic, and John took the opportunity to grab his hand, which was still pale and perfectly unharmed. John stared.
"I… oh" he tipped his head back onto the edge of the tub as John continued licking and biting at his neck and chest "I can't"
Molly, the girl who works at Bart's morgue has just been replaced by a very strict by-the-book pathologist by the name of Mike Stamford, and this just won't do.
(See the end of the chapter for
A couple of hours later Sherlock and john went down to meet everyone and have dinner. Three men and two women, excluding Bill, sat at the huge dining table, which was already set.
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
John glared at him. Something was definitely not right. And he was going to get to the bottom of it tonight.
"What I do know is, in the 90-some years prior to that, in fact for as long as they kept records, there wasn't one other case thought to be murder-suicide among couples married more than one year but less than two. Not one." John finished.
"John" Sherlock moaned loudly as he pushed John's head off his chest and tried to lead him downwards, where the outline of his cock was painted in the expensive fabric of his trousers.
He gave her a small smile before answering "Sherlock."
"And you are?"
