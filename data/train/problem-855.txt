Molly moved around the worktable and stopped in front of him, leading him to lower his gaze to meet the woman's.
Whenever his looks had been intercepted by Sherlock, the man had merely smiled at him, reading on his face everything that was going through his mind, while checking that his behaviour with Emma was socially acceptable.
"Sir there is something that requires your attention" she said, and then entered the office, the door closing behind her in an automatic, silent gesture.
"What are we going to tell people? “asked the doctor, before starting to leave small kisses on Sherlock's jaw and neck.
An incredulous expression was painted on Sherlock's face: could It be that Mycroft was insinuating what he thought he understood?
The last thing I want is for her to be a spoiled child, as I was before she arrived...- Baby Girl commented with the hint of a smile on her lips that also infected the doctor. - I want her to be kind to everyone and polite and that she always knows, at all times, that she is surrounded by people who love her and who will always be by her side-
Greg shook his head: although he had always had a decent luck with men and women, there had been a few occasions in his youth when he had to resort to the help of professionals, especially during the confused period of adolescence, when he could not tell if he was more attracted by his rugby teammates or cheerleaders.
Still, that ghost moved confidently, amid disbelieving and petrified agents, clearly headed for his office; for an instant Greg thought about the gun he stored in his desk drawer, but he was not fast enough.
It must be something serious, otherwise you wouldn't have left your apartment-asked Harry, looking at him cautiously.
John thinned his lips, fully understanding the meaning of those words, and gave a brief nod to his friend.
Beneath that warm, soothing jet, John let his mind wander, reliving a few moments of what had happened the night before, but inevitably Sherlock's words rang out in his mind.
-One morning we were called out: there were at least three wounded about ten miles from our hospital.
The thing that struck him the most was the expression on John's face: he had seen him not even twenty-four hours ago and John was smiling and affable as only the good doctor, thanks to the influence of his brother, could be.
From the way the boy was favoring his left side while standing, John considered that Daniel must have at least one broken rib,  moving gently his fingers closer to his right eye and softly touching his eye socket to check that it was not broken.
Sherlock's nimble fingers stopped on his chest, quickly opening one button after another, showing off more of John's still slightly tanned chest.
Fifteen minutes later, the noise of the front door informed him that his unwanted guest had left the apartment, leaving his life and Gregory's once and for all.
Unconsciously or perhaps to protect his companion from the cold wind, Sherlock stepped forward, taking John in front of him, almost no distance between them, leading John to slightly raise his face to lower the difference and meet his look.
Even if you preferred not to say anything, I'm sure Sherlock told you -said the woman, an amused smile on her lips.
The woman stood motionless, one hand still on the door, her gaze fixed on him, a smile that disappeared instantly replaced by an incredulous expression that turned in into an indignant sneer.
Since the detective had slammed the door behind himself, John had  sat on the couch, thinking endlessly back to the long conversation that had taken place in that room, breaking it down into short sentences, retracing in his memory every word, every inflection to find even the most hidden meaning.
-You took care of her during her pregnancy and formed a bond with the baby, perhaps unconsciously- continued Sherlock, the cup of tea squeezed in the fingers of one hand.
-I know, and I'm not asking you to end your friendship with him, but to make room in your life for two more people... Actually three, considering that Sherlock and I have a nine-month-old baby- John confided them.
Even without turning around, Sherlock knew that the woman had taken John's hand between her own: they were dealing with delicate topics, "
A hand that, despite the confusion of those distant days, had tightened around his and allowed Sherlock to guided him, certain that Sherlock would protect John and bring both of them to safety.
Mycroft remained silent, turning his gaze to the wicker basket, where unaware of what was going on around him, baby Holmes continued to sleep blissful.
-And of course, you decided to take on this task because you were the most suitable person...-said John caustic, letting all his frustration shine through more and more.
"You didn't, but next time could you avoid being as quiet as a damn cat?" he asked in a calm tone, trying to put Sherlock at ease.
Sherlock swallowed several times, trying to find something intelligent or even just coherent to say.
He had not gone far; he had made only a few steps, moving in an almost hunted way trying to put order in his confused thoughts, clutching between his trembling fingers one of the cigarettes he had made a habit of keeping in the inner pocket of his Belstaff in the past few years.
If Greg needed further proof that his suspicions were grounded, all in Mycroft from his gaze to his posture, would confirm his fears.
"Do you really think it's a good idea to take the kids to the Parade?” Sherlock asked for the umpteenth time turning towards John.
For a few moments Sherlock remained silent, staring at the camera but did not really see it and John was sure that that moment was dedicated to him, as if the detective was looking for his gaze among the many viewers who were listening at the time, silently asking him how to answer.
-I was a skinny long-limbed kid and I hadn't taken street fight lessons from the homeless, I wouldn't have lasted two minutes in a fight.
John frowned, clearly surprised, and even Sherlock wanted to let go of an expression of astonishment, but he kept the mask of indifference that ruled his own face.
Jack approached him like he would a wounded animal and sat next to him, putting his arm around his shoulders and pulling him closed to himself.
Heedless of the pain that spread almost instantly in his hand, he struck him again, this time in the stomach, without giving Sherlock time to recover, managing to throw him to the ground.
Silence descended between them for a few moments, both engaged with their teacups, until Jack spoke again.
Within twenty-four hours since they first met, John had carved out a place in his life, perfectly adapting to his work, his needs, his quirks and later even the severed parts in the fridge (
John stroked his chin and let his fingers slide over the beard that covered it, immersed in his thoughts.
-Lost... Completely lost- he said before taking a long breath to try to calm down- When Sherlock disappeared, my feelings were confused, so I couldn't explain why losing my best friend was so painful.
In that brief silence, and only with a quick glance, Sherlock found confirmation of the first ideas he had about the woman sitting on the couch next to John: she was probably thirty-four or thirty-five years, with a blond hair bob to match a formal work environment and almost certainly male-dominated, accustomed to formal clothes given the almost obsessive way with which she continued to torment the hem of the casual blouse she wore at the time, and above all a curious look, but almost bold with which she continued to scrutinize him, almost certainly to inform him that she was not afraid of him, despite that being the first time they met.
-Put Hamish against your shoulder and the pat him on his back with your open palm to make him burp - instructed Molly, watching him carefully as Sherlock carried out her orders.
The two men stared for a long time in silence, unable to find the right words to overcome what was perhaps the most difficult situation ever occurred in their friendship since the Baskerville case.
Clearly hungry, Hamish ravenously sucked from his bottle without ever turning his gaze away from John's face as if he were afraid to see him suddenly disappear if only he had turned his attention elsewhere for a few moments.
I'm a doctor, I was once a surgeon specializing in emergency medicine, and as you brilliantly inferred, I was a soldier.
Sherlock nodded slowly, lost in his thoughts allowing Greg to cast a glance at his partner, still completely focused on Hamish.
A smoldering expression appeared on the doctor's face, leading him to clenched both hands, abandoned against his hips, carefully avoiding meeting Sherlock's gaze that he felt burning more than the others on himself.
"Of course I'm back!" John promptly retorted before taking a deep breath. "Sherlock, do you remember what I told you that morning before everything went to hell?" he asked.
Sherlock felt a slight tremor in the fingers of his left hand, and remained silent, trying to block from his mind the images that John's appearance suggested, but to no avail.
"We weren't friends, if that's what you’re asking, but for a while we worked the same streets" he said.
Sherlock let himself go against the back of his chair, his right hand still busy stroking Hamish's back.
He stood by the kitchen threshold and the smile grew bigger when he saw the figure on his shoulders next to the kitchen counter, busy filling a plate of food, launching every two seconds a glance at the display of his iPhone.
He sent a quick text asking for more information, quickly getting up and preparing for a visit to Baker Street, worried about what he would find waiting for him, when he heard the vibration announcing the response to his questions.
He had always hated handshakes, too formal and impersonal, and saw no reason to offer one to a woman who had begun to radiate hostility since she had heard his name, and a little girl who would find her gesture stupid.
I knew you'd been with other men while I was away, but until yesterday I had never really confronted myself with the reality of it- Sherlock admitted slightly tightening the embrace.
-Mycroft would pay my bail and then give me some medal... The only reason I'm holding back is because I want John to do it- he answered honestly.
Trying to focus on his work, and avoid the hostile and empty apartment, Sherlock finds himself in Barts' lab, sitting in front of a microscope to examine some skin tissues for a case.
-If Clara had a baby during your separation, then come back to you and ask you to forgive her... Would you had done it? -asked John turning around and meeting his sister’s eyes.
An ironic laugh rang out in the room, before John turned slightly to meet the black-haired man’s face once again.
"Were you even listen to what I was telling you?” Sherlock asked him trying to tame the annoyed tone of his voice.
John turned his back on Sherlock, but the black-haired man read from the relaxed posture of his shoulder and back muscles that the music was to his liking, despite having no idea who the composer was or the name of the symphony.
What the hell was going through John’s head? How  could he let himself go like that only because of his death?
Settling Hamish against his shoulder, John stretched out his arm and grabbed the detective's hand, tangling their fingers.
In one corner of the ambulance parking lot, John saw the SUV he would recognize everywhere, ready to save him if only he had moved a step in his direction, but John walked down the street.
It was only after a long moment of luxurious silence that John notice an insistent noise that was trying to attract his attention and only then his brain set aside for a moment the wonderful sensations he felt every time he was in Sherlock’s arms and remembered where they were and why they were there.
And it was one morning, after a sleepless night, sitting in his armchair, his gaze fixed on the now perpetually empty armchair in front of him, that John had felt his father big and reassuring hand fall on his left shoulder.
Sherlock laid down on their bed, his head on the pillow and his legs open to give John enough space to move closer.
I am not saying this out of sudden benevolence or kindness of heart, I’m saying this just for Hamish's sake.
Leaning on the doorstep of the room, one hand against the door handle to support some of his weight, Mycroft shrugged.
It was bad for obvious reasons, no one should ever learn so closely about human cruelty and greed, but... There were flashes of humanity...
John sighed and stood up, briefly turning his back on the detective until his trousers were back in place.
You told me you were born in a small town, you talked about your sister... And I can tell from your posture that you've had some kind of military training-replied Sherlock, a dry smile on his face.
The first time I saw him, he was with Greg, I offered him a drink and we danced together for a while.
Despite the immobility to which his young age forced him, Hamish bent his back moving his head left and right, almost mimicking an old tortoise who struggles in its movements but who is still curious about the world around her, studying the new room.
He freed his arm from the hold of the other man and responded to Sherlock's furious look, with equal fury.
And for the first time in so many years, Sherlock felt alone again, as so many times before he met John.
It was not Mrs. Hudson who took advantage of the silence to leave some cookies or the morning papers.
It had been a long day, preceded by an almost sleepless night and his body began to feel it, after all he was forty years old... he should have taken more care of himself.
That avalanche of emotions he couldn't identify was about to suffocate him, but Sherlock was aware that letting John go without making him at least partly aware of those "feelings" would be the biggest mistake of his life.
John turned to his left where with a changed attitude, not at all dented by the wet and smelly pants stood Sherlock Holmes, his gaze fixed on Tommy, clearly busy to read every little secret from the boy’s posture and hair.
-See if you can bring even the beautiful doctor... It's always a pleasure to see you Doc, but you know… Looks count-commented Boss.
From the expression on the little girl's face, however, he realized that she had not done a great job until then.
-I know, I know, it can seem absurd, especially given everything we've been through to get here and how intertwined our lives are.
-To be honest Doc, I didn't want to hear your lecture if I hadn't followed your recommendations...- jokingly retorted the other man, making John laugh.
", but he had the distinct feeling that, in this case, no one would notice his disappearance, so much would be accurate the work by the Ministry to erase all traces of its existence.
The moment the elevator doors opened on the Investigative Section of New Scotland Yard; Sherlock was greeted by an all-too-familiar voice.
"I'm not going to change my plans because you got into a fight with your boyfriend" his father said.
Gently handling the case, Sherlock pulled out the instrument, perhaps the only object in the world that had his unconditional attention for years, and let his fingers touch the crate with cherished and ill-concealed love, before picking up the case top and control inside.
I want to run through the alleys of London to hunt down criminals with you and the next day I want to complain about the fictionalized style of your blog; I want to help you with the homeless, if you will let me, and when we are too old for the dangerous criminal life in London, I want to move to Surrey with you-concluded.
Thanks to his photographic knowledge of the streets of London, Sherlock was able to understand almost immediately where they were headed, and he had confirmation of it when John turned into Thornton Street and moments later in Salisbury Place.
Even later, after analyzing the situation calmly and rationally, Gregory Lestrade would have been unable to understand if what had surprised him the most was the child peacefully asleep in his boyfriend’s arms or Mycroft, perfectly comfortable with a little baby in his arms.
Perhaps for the first time, I would have been able to put someone else's interest first- confessed honestly Sherlock.
John was truly grateful for Greg, Sarah, Jack and Mrs. Hudson who had supported his project during those years and had never done anything to discourage him, indeed trying in every way possible to help him when he was losing hopes, or the difficulties seemed insurmountable.
Greg passed his hand through his short hair and watched him under his hand for a few seconds, considering the proposal: what trouble could it be if Sherlock dealt with years-old cases?
At last, Sherlock opened his eyes and met John's gaze, trying to ignore the increase of his heartbeats at the sight of the man: in those clothes John was spectacular, even more handsome than in his own mental projection.
In addition, you have seen our apartment: it is definitely smaller than this house and I assume your Estate.
She didn't choose to come into the world, but now she has the right to have the best of what you can give her even if this will involve separating you from her-concluded the detective in a calm and serious voice at the same time.
It was absurd to think that he was about to enter that sacred place in a Scotland Yard patrol car while far more powerful and elegant cars had passed though that gate... A childhood dream shattered!
The woman shook her head, and the next moment she held out a note that she had pulled out of her blouse pocket.
-You know me, I'm faithful when I'm in a relationship... If my boy...-said stopping himself to the grimace of the other man-partner is Sherlock Holmes I have no reason to look around.
Who knew that one day he would be sitting on the couch a short distance from Sherlock watching that same episode?
He had to gather as much information as possible, he had to shed light once again on the mystery that John Watson was.
Did Micheals wanted to make him realize that John had move on? To make him understand the attraction and complicity that the two men had?
Sherlock smiled mischievously and lowered his head, kissing gently the skin of John’s shoulder, sensitive of the wound that had interrupted John's military career; the wound that had led John in his path.
He wanted to scream, throw the intruder out of the house, repeating once again that he didn't want anything to do with him anymore, but he knew it would be useless.
It was obvious that she wanted to ask him something, but that she did not know how to do it, and Sherlock decided to help her.
Gently, he clasped his arms around Hamish's body, mimicking the position seen just moment before from his father and glanced at the child, hinting a smile.
"What the hell did you do this time?" asked again Greg, looking at the child who had begun to move under the blanket that was enveloping him.
Sherlock’s long legs wraps around John’s hips and a moment later, his arms are around John’s shoulders pulling him closer; John felt his breath getting stuck in his throat, his body still to allow them both to adapt to the change, Sherlock's breath wheezing in his ear; moments or hours later Sherlock’s hips jerked upward letting John know that he could finally,
Once on the pavement, Sherlock closed the cab door behind him and walked slowly toward John, following him into the vestibule and then leading him up the stairs, feeling him distractedly locking the front door.
Those words had been ringing in his mind for days: he had analyzed them, dissected them, trying to understand their hidden meaning.
I also want to give you and heads up: the story is almost over, but I still need to translate the last 3 chapters, and I'm not sure when I'll be able  to do it with the holidays and the exams in January...
Everything was going so well yesterday; they were having fun and for once he could relax without worrying about a sudden phone call that would end up ruining his plans.
Sherlock opened it and the first thing he saw was a photograph of John; not the John Watson he remembered, but what had survived his death by reinventing himself in something completely different at least in his  eyes.
-We don't pretend. John is my best friend-beat back Sherlock at the insinuation., staring at him with flaming eyes.
-We could do it after closing time: it’d be just Sarah and me and you wouldn't have anything to worry about" John said.
"Do you always ask the same questions?" Greg asked. -It's late, it's freezing, and I have a feeling that you have a long night ahead of you.
Something was wrong... And if he didn't want Gregory to slowly and inexorably walk away from him, he had to find out what it was.
Despite his hatred for the woman, Irene seemed to have an unexpected confidence, if what she had said was the truth and not yet another attempt to get what she wanted.
-Someone who will wait for us even when it is obvious that we will not return- added Sherlock almost whispering.
Sherlock stared intently at the doctor, blissfully enjoying for those brief moments the sound of his laugh, terribly jealous that it had been a stranger and not him to provoke that wonderful sound.
-Nothing. Look, maybe I can explain to you how the poison went into circulation, but not now- John replied.
"Hey Misha" said Greg, stroking the baby's back, prompting a smoldering look from Sherlock for the nickname.
I just wanted to say  THANK YOU! to all the people who read my FF, left kudos, bookmarked it and wrote a comment.
"Hello" John said, greeting the boy, then observing his old, poorly kept clothes, the thinness of the young man who denoted his malnutrition and especially his bruised face that made him understand the reason behind the late-night phone call.
Their landlady had been too kind that night, even though she was no longer very young, and although John would gladly continue that date, perhaps it was better not to take too much advantage of the woman's kindness.
-The point of this date is to get to know each other and if I lied, you wouldn't be able to decide if it's worth going out a second time with me...-explained Sherlock.
Three hours later, John and Sally sat relaxed at a table in an Indian restaurant, one of the best in the area according to Sherlock, waiting to be served.
Why did everyone expect anything from him? Why didn't they just leave him alone for once and give him time to reflect on what he wanted to do with his life?
-You've gained a few pounds since the last time we saw each other and you're usually not the kind of person who tends to gain weight easily, your eyes twinkle every time you look at Hamish, probably imagining your baby, and to conclude I can see from your open bag a recipe for vitamins that are prescribed only during pregnancy- Sherlock explained all in one breath, as usual.
Sherlock, in response, merely shrugged his shoulders and moved towards the sofa, letting himself fall gracefully on it.
But that didn't stop his hyperactive brain from asking a thousand loathsome questions: who was he with?
Now, however, most of their outings were accompanied by Hamish's old monogramed blue bag crammed with snacks, water or milk bottles, wet wipes, and diapers (although Hope finally had got rid of that annoying and smelly accessory for almost six months now) and a change of clothes in case one of the children or both had an accident.
-I know that my knowledge of romantic matters is rather poor if not completely non-existent, but I am aware that it is a fundamental point of courtship as it allows two people to get to know each other better... -
The other three guests were already sitting around the table on bar stools, food neatly placed in the center of the table so that it was easily accessible for everyone, and Greg occupied his seat next to Sally.
John’s thick fingers glided along the smooth skin of Sherlock's erection, brushing it distractedly and discovering it damp with precome, then overtaking the brown bush to caress the delicate skin that protected Sherlock's entrance, applying a slight pressure that led Sherlock to bite his lower lip and huff a groan.
A record, since the last time they found themselves face to face, he had just discovered John's drug-addicted past and had an uncontrollable desire to punch that authoritarian mask.
Someone hummed softly with the music, and for a moment Sherlock was tempted by the image of John Watson preparing breakfast in the kitchen in boxer and dressing gown, smiling happily.
Disturbed by his own thoughts, Sherlock rested his forehead on John's shoulder, hiding his face from John, closing his eyes for a few moments.
"No way" Sherlock said, as he approached John and sat behind him on the floor, his chest against John’s back.
And instead he had stood there, staring at that ledge to watch him die, almost as guilty as Moriarty.
He was certain that the relationship between the two men had not reached a physical level, given  the lack of signs or the smell of sex that John always carried with him after each sexual encounter, but that awareness did not seem to help him every time his look rested on the crumpled clothes and disheveled hair of the doctor, the result of some amorous meeting between the two men, causing him an incomprehensible anger in his stomach.
John stared at him for a few moments, before putting his face closer to Sherlock and kissing those perfect lips.
At that sight the detective could not hold back the hint of a smile in return, before pulling the child against his chest, placing him better in his arms.
It's the experience you remember for the rest of your life... Especially since he never goes with the same person twice-
-No! Only Time Lords know how to build it and how to drive it- he explained patiently, like she was talking to a child of her own age.
Sherlock thinned his lips, trying to control the answer he had on the tip of his tongue before answering.
I didn't know him; I didn't even know his name! I knew he was good in bed and he was kind of untouchable, but only because of the gossips in the club.
-Okay, let me see what happened. I’ll try to be quick; I promise!- John said to him, standing up and walking fast to the kitchen table where he had left his cell phone.
Shaking his head slightly to clear his mind of those flashbacks, Sherlock got up and went to sit next to John, decreasing the distance between them.
He decided on the second option, mainly to avoid scaring Mrs. Hudson, but also because he was unaware of the possible alarm systems installed in the meantime.
She would listen to me and Boss and the three of us would have found a solution... But once again, you had to ruin everything.
The detective merely nodded, still clearly surprised, but his tapered fingers relaxed around John's small ones without making any mention of breaking that brief connecting point.
Usually the detective would take control of the situation, but he was aware that right now John was in charge and he could only follow him step by step.
Sherlock knew that the man had spoken to John, that something had happened during their meeting, he clearly read it on Mycroft's face, but he had not wanted to give in to the temptation to ask his brother what had troubled him.
-I heard he got married and took his father's place in the family business, so we probably weren't meant to last... I could never have been a trophy husband or worse his lover- Sherlock ended without acrimony.
-I'm 16! If I decide to fuck strangers for money, it's my choice" he said once again with that cold, detached voice.
-You invited him to dinner. Do you mean a real date and not a simple dinner? – he asked him to be sure he understood well.
John shook his head quickly, searching in his memory for the boy's name, when a light finally lit, and a name prevailed over everyone else.
After all, it will be a win-win situation for you: I'd handle the unsolved cases, and John would continue to work with you on the new cases-
Letting a subdued groan go, John continued to move his hips on the wave of his pleasure, gradually losing momentum, until he fell completely spent in the arms of the man beneath him, a cheek pressed against Sherlock's collarbone.
An evolved version, complicated and incomprehensible to the poor mere mortals, which perfectly suited our needs.
With that conviction clear in mind, Mycroft turned the handle and opened the door of the bedroom, finding it slightly wrapped in the dim light.
-You can do it, but I'm not ready to talk about it now that I've decided to turn the page... Maybe in a few months-
There's a slight arrhythmia... Baby Girl did you have short breath or felt tired? -he asked and went back to look at the girl.
-A centurion who waited millennia to meet Amy, aware that she was the love of his life-added John before taking a handful of popcorn.
Sherlock turned and saw her carrying a hand to her mouth, holding back a sob; he then approached the woman and crouched beside her, placing a hand on her knee.
He had settled behind the desk, with a cup of coffee next to his phone, his white coat on and took a deep breath.
Sherlock responded with a grunt and took his own cup from the sink to pour himself a generous quantity of tea.
"I can't think right now. And it's not Daniel's fault, at least not completely, but because I can't think that it was so easy for you to doubt me and believe that it was so easy for me to cheat on you with the first cute guy walking down the streets.
Was there anyone forcing him into prostitution? Or was the red-haired man his pimp taking part in his salary?
Emma was once again wearing comfortable clothes: a pair of jeans and a pink sweater, with white sneakers (
His mind re-enacted the image of his "rival" making him notice once again his youth, his skinny physique, the delicate face as if he were a porcelain doll.
Sherlock could not hold back the smile that had formed at the corners of his mouth: something of their shared life must have rubbed off on John.
-I’m good dear, despite my hip... With this weather it always seems to get worse; If it continues like this, I'll be forced to use a walking stick-
He could have done research, asked for the club’s cameras tapes to Mycroft to observe John's behaviour during his "alternative Mondays", but he knew from the outset that it would not be enough.
"I don't think so, she probably already has a complete dossier on all of our actions from the moment we met to date" Sherlock said.
The doctor's blue ocean eyes met the detective's icy-blue eyes, obscured by passion and desire, and John smiled with satisfaction before taking Sherlock's hand in his and exiting the kitchen headed for the stairs leading to his bedroom.
-Everything I've done, I've done so that you could be here today and look at me with that uncertain look on my face, undecided whether to believe me or not- concluded Sherlock again.
From the very first moment their eyes met, John had been sucked into a vortex that had constantly endangered him, but had brought him back to life, giving him a purpose again since his time in the Army.
An exasperated sigh ran from his unhinged lips and once again passed a hand over his face, this time trying to convince himself that the whole situation was just a hallucination, that soon the detective would disappear as so many times had happened in the past.
"Well,  if I remember your words from yesterday morning, it was over between us, so I assumed that..." the detective explained.
When he had locked the front door, he heard noises coming from Mrs. Hudson's apartment, a sign that the woman was still awake, waiting for Sherlock to pick up Hamish.
I paid the rent of this flat for as long as I was gone, all my belongings and my forensic equipment is here and let's not forget the proximity to the Barts.
Since returning to London, Sherlock had never seen the doctor in the company of his conquests, but he had always believed that John had avoided having him meet them to prevent embarrassment.
Once his speech was over, however, both the girl and Boss stared at him in disbelief, without saying a word, as if they expected him to continue his speech.
During his speech Mycroft had never looked away from John’s face, the cup of tea to cover part of his face and it was only when John had finished his outburst that Mycroft decided to put the cup on the table and show him the impassive expression painted on his face.
He had not earned the nickname "Three Watson Continents" by establishing a serious relationship with every partner he had slept with, but in his case it was different: each time his partners knew what they could expect from him, how far they could go and above all they knew that they could not make many claims.
Sherlock glanced at the still-sleeping form next to him and freed himself from their embrace, sitting back and grabbing his dressing gown before leaving the bedroom, the sound of that crying still in his ears.
But something caught John's attention, leading him to lift the man's left hand: his knuckles were slightly scratched.
"But I have to confess that when I first heard about you, when they told me you were going to move to Baker Street with my son, I immediately became apprehensive-confessed Lady Holmes.
His mind, still partially asleep, wondered if that night the detective had allowed himself a few hours of sleep as opposed to the previous days, quickly driving away that thought.
And in a way the pills were useful...-he said in such a low voice that it was heard only thanks to the microphone.
A warmth feeling enveloped Sherlock just to observe the picture of the man: he was different from how he remembered him, he knew he could say  the same  about himself, but it was always John.
John let out an incredulous sigh that he had unknowingly restrained and took two steps in the hallway toward his father.
Of course, Greg was aware that he had to inform Mycroft as soon as possible, in view of his impending return, but every time they spoke on the phone, his courage had failed, leading him to talk about trivial and stupid matters.
-What about the old unsolved cases? I could take care of those, and I'm willing to bet there's plenty of them, if we look at the state of your office-he proposed.
-As you can imagine I've never had a date before, and I don't think I'm wrong when I say you've had dates with women and men- the detective said.
I thought my love for you was obvious, that you knew how much I love you and how much I respect you... That I would never do to you what my wife did to me...
The first thought that crossed the detective's mind was how soft were John's lips, the perfect combination of his own lower lip and John's upper lip; the second was John's fingers, still clenched around the lapel of his coat that pulled him against his body, instead of pushing him away.
It was a crazy idea, something that he never allowed anyone, and that could turn quickly into a disaster, but if there was one person worth a try for, that was John.
Fully awake, John frowned, moving his head on the pillow to observe Sherlock's face, for once serene and fast asleep; he studied the shape of his face, the disheveled curls that fell on his forehead and on the pillowcase and his lips perfectly  drawn, those lips that the night before had promised him a future together, before signing the agreement with a kiss.
-He continued to live in Baker Street despite all his friends recommending him to move elsewhere and maintained a good friendship with Mike Stanford, Molly Dimmock and Detective Lestrade.
Just then the sound of footsteps on the stairs led the two men to look towards the door left open by Mycroft where, the next moment the figure of Greg Lestrade materialized.
Frustrated he sunk his fingers through his hair, upsetting the curls and giving them a rebellious look, before standing up and heading to the bathroom in search of the nicotine patches… a problem like that required at least two patches.
-I know I should have waited for one of the other guys to come and help me out, but in that moment my only thought was that I had to get that kid out of there as soon as possible, so I tried to drag him to the Rover... And that's when I got hit.
-You're not just a guy I met one night at a club, with whom I danced for a couple of hours and decided to spend the night with knowing that I will never see him again.
He recalled the comment that Mycroft had let himself get away the day before and looked around in the bathroom, finding what he was looking for in a cabinet above the toilet.
Sherlock remained silent, fiddling with the plastic cup in front of him, reliving in his memory every single moment of the eighteen months spent with John, looking for that detail that had clearly eluded him, that half-word, that missed gesture that would change the course of their friendship.
Sally remained silent for a few moments, still undecided on whether to confess or not, before exhaling acquiescent.
John pressed his lips against each other, unused to a subdued Sherlock, probably wondering how long the chemical or verbal explosions from the man would begin.
"I'm sorry I haven't come to see you lately, but I've been busy" John said, clearly seeing his mother's expression in response to those words.
"Who would have thought Holmes Jr. would be a chatterbox" said John, a corner of his mouth bent upwards in a smile.
Mycroft turned slightly, looking at the pathetic figure trying to tuck his jeans without putting pressure on his right side.
Still wearing his pajamas and blue robe, Sherlock moved around the living room in a series of frantic movements as he approached the window, taking hold of the violin and then the next moment putting it back in its case and returning to sit on the couch, sending one message after another, undecided whether to send the most important text.
The clashes with Mr. O'Neill were still in his memory as if they had happened the day before and not thirty years earlier; every  time he knocked on their door, his father-in-law did not fail to point out his disapproval with  his hair, his tight pants or the chains he used instead of the belt.
However, he could not deny that there was a substantial part of John's life that he completely ignored.
Of course, he wouldn't have been happy, but at least he could have forgotten what had happened faster and moved on with his life.
With his free hand, Sherlock took a long sip from his glass, wearing his armor again, before looking back at John.
A shadow in front of him led John to look up again and come face to face with Sherlock, two cups of coffee in his hands and, after the first moment of surprise, John smiled at him.
Mycroft opened the folder ready to quickly examining the contents before he got home, ready for his brother's umpteenth nonsense, but as he set his eyes on the first photo he stiffen up: in front of his eyes Greg, his Gregory was standing on the corner of a street busy talking to a teenage boy, clearly an hustler.
"That there are those who have reinvented themselves in order not to forget me...- he murmured more to himself than to his mother.
John moved closer to the man's face and kissed him, putting all the feelings he had not voiced, and which sometimes cut his breath for their intensity, in that kiss.
"I guess you've illustrated the beauties of our city in great detail" said John, a wry smile printed on his face.
Sherlock heard the usual noises coming from the kitchen and calmed down: his mother was in Baker Street, an unpleasant novelty, but she was not there to force him to move or leave John and his work behind.
There was also a shadowy area, composed of various corridors where surely, with the passage of hours would move much of the action, but for the moment it was still empty and "immaculate".
For a moment they remained still in the vestibule; John gave the man time to look around and catalogue as much information as possible about the house where he spent his childhood, and it was only when Mycroft turned to him again that John smiled at him.
John turned to the Inspector and stared at him for a few moments, reading in his eyes all he needed to know and shook his head.
With the corner of his eye Sherlock noticed the looks of perfect strangers fixed on them and, as was the case in the past, intent on staring at him but this time not with ill-concealed desire, but with obvious envy.
-You need to talk to Mycroft: he can find the right candidates, do his routine checks, so that in these thirteen weeks Baby Girl will meet the aspirants parents and choose the couple that seems most suited to her needs.
Sherlock shrugged, all too aware that feelings were not his forte and settled more comfortably on the cold floor.
I think it is a defense mechanism: both Mycroft and Sherlock were very close to their father; my husband's acquaintances helped Mycroft climb early in his career, and Sherlock had found in his father a worthy intellectual opponent.
John nodded slowly, at first confused, then pleasantly surprised that Sherlock had wanted to recognize Hamish's presence in his life with such confidence and, unexpectedly, found himself hinting at a smile.
“Oh, by the way... How did you find us among this crowd?” the doctor asked turning slightly towards Sherlock.
Sherlock hinted at a smile in turn and brought the cup to his lips, but waited until he laid down the cup again to speak again.
Hamish made another guttural sound that John clearly interpreted as a sign of assent and laughing he kissed Hamish’s black hair.
That thought had crossed his mind many times in recent years, both before and after their forced separation and, while in the past  it was only a fleeting thought, an idea with which he would occasionally entertained himself, after The Fall had assumed the tones of nostalgia and regret, wondering each time what it would be like to hold the detective closer, to feel him tremble under John’s caresses and attentions.
"Don't let the Queen hear you" Mycroft retorted,  standing up as well. "Don't wait up for me" he added.
John focused on the monitor for a few moments, moving the wand only a few millimeters and pressed another button on the console.
-I could never let that happen! I volunteer to drive you wherever you need to go" Jack said with a good-natured smile.
The detective looked around and, after taking the milk out from the fridge and one of the best glasses they had in the house, brought the half-full glass to Emma, then returned to take care of his own tea, adding two teaspoons of sugar and milk, pouring clearly too much compromising its taste.
An unexpected anger materialized in Sherlock's stomach, at the mere thought of the two men together.
The little girl seemed to reflect a few seconds on his answer before nodding, deciding that she could trust him.
He then walked away again, continuing to prepare the tea, although both he and Sherlock knew it would be left on the kitchen counter if the situation worsened.
Sherlock relaxed briefly against John, hiding his face in the other's neck, before breathing deeply.
-Mycroft is here? -asked Sherlock feeling the anger mount towards the man; those words were confirmation that Mycroft and of course Lestrade had hidden something from him.
Only then had he turned his gaze to Sherlock, still sitting on the sofa with his gaze fixed on the off-turned off television and had let out a long sigh.
Completely amazed by the vision in front of him, John stood still for a few moments, helping Sherlock to fully enjoy that moment, before moving his hand away from the man's spent cock and focusing on his own orgasm, which made his ears buzzing and led him to move his hips again, almost drilling into Sherlock.
Irene had abandoned him in Baker Street, but who gave them the certainty that in the not too distant future she would not return to take him back?
-As far as I know, none of the guys he's been with in these years have ever been to Baker Street... And it doesn't surprise me in the slightest" said Jack, again taking a drink from his cup.
His brother had stopped by the apartment just long enough to leave him everything he had left behind at the Watson's house and put Hamish in his crib.
Despite the signs that years of alcohol abuse had left on her face and, surely, on her body, Harriet Watson hadn't touched a drop of alcohol in almost two years.
And that silence was what scared Greg the most... More than tears, tremors, sudden bursts of anger or those few episodes of pain masquerading as madness.
Greg reflected a few moments on his words and then glanced at the book he still hold in his hands and nodded.
"It's really a shame that that knucklehead decided not to come" Greg said when a couple of hours later they stopped by a bench to allow the kids to have a snack.
It was strange to think that this small tombstone could contain the ever-active cyclone that had been Elisabeth Watson, a woman genetically unable to stay in the same place for more than two minutes in a row.
Ready to solve international crises within a few hours or jump into the trajectory of a gun, but when it came to their private lives, they were totally incompetent.
-Then why didn't the same thing happen with the dinosaurs? - she asked again, beginning to descend the stairs alongside Sherlock.
Given the unexpected reactions he's been having in the last few days every time he thought of John, the response was positive.
It took just a few hours to tear down that complex armor he had built in those three years, leaving only one confused and wounded former soldier.
Moving those thoughts aside from his mind, he had focused on his work again until, after looking up to welcome yet another patient, he had met Jack’s familiar face.
It was when he was busy repainting the bottom corners of the door that he realized that someone was staring at him.
An answer that once again demonstrated how ignorant his brother could be in the matters of the heart.
But there was a feeling that Greg couldn't shake off himself: the  certainty that there was something different.
The second thing he realized after a few moments was the figure sitting on his bed in the dim light that he would easily have mistaken for Sherlock had it not been for the Fifth Doctor's face staring at him from the wall.
I would do anything to protect my son, and for that reason I would never dream of separating you from your little girl; you will need each other from the first moment they put her in your arms for the first time.
He entered the living room and closed the door behind him, and it was then that he saw the wicker basket on the sofa: it was creamy white, with one handle sticking out on both sides and a light wool blanket covering the small shape inside.
"Here he is! He is the Doctor," Emma told Sherlock, pointing to the skinny boy with the bowtie on the screen.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at that question, rising to his feet and moving towards the kitchen; if Lestrade had brought food it would have been dinner time for Hamish too.
The physical transformation, as if he wanted to erase every trace of the John Watson with whom Sherlock had lived for eighteen months, but  above all the emotional one, which had made him more blunt, mysterious... As if he'd spent the last three years looking over his shoulder for bounty hunters.
Sherlock had always known that he was an intelligent man with a higher-than-average IQ, so he had considered that possibility from the very first moment he decided to stage his own death.
There was nothing John wanted more than to believe Sherlock's words and he almost had to stop himself so he will not run to the detective hiding in his arms, his face in the hollow space between his neck and shoulder, where Sherlock’s scent was stronger and forget those days of coldness.
"Have you become my guardian angel?" asked the other man with that usual swaggering air with which he had tempted him.
It's the men who approach him... He just chooses according to his fancy and most of the time, his choice falls on a pale lanky man with curly black hair-said Jack, staring carefully at the consultant to make him understand the true meaning of his words.
Jack hugged his friend as well and locked the office door behind him, then showed the lunch bag he was clutching in his right hand.
"I know this area" said the doctor once he got out of the cab, "I once went with Harry to Vivienne Westwood's shop" he added, looking around for the aforementioned store.
What had happened between them had been a mistake, a huge mistake that Sherlock had not been able to erase from his mind and which he had ended up cataloguing as an "experiment not to be repeated".
"What about you?"asked Sherlock, observing for a moment John’s hand now on the third button of his purple shirt before meeting John's eyes again- How many hearts have you broken in your life? -
-A man who has not had a partner, be it a man or a woman, for more than ten years, and now that everyone is aware of our relationship, you decide to go on a date with another woman?- he asked, raising his voice on the last words.
No, don't get me wrong, I'm glad that at least once in his life he's taken his responsibilities, but is it really so wrong to try to make him understand that a child changes your life? -John said staring at the tombstone almost waiting for an answer.
The man took the few steps that separated him from the two chairs in front of the desk and dropped on one, crossing his long legs and crossing his arms to his chest.
Sherlock pulled his face away from John's and looked around, identifying the cause of annoyance in John's cell phone.
John remained silent, not knowing how to respond, letting his mind wander for a few moments in that dark side of his mind where his feelings for Sherlock were bound...
Forcing himself not to think about the clear meaning of the song and determined to take all the time he needed to make the right decision, John reached out his arm to the lamp next to the bed and turned it off, causing the room to fall into the dark.
-I've never done that! He gave me his number and it was Greg that came looking for me... But for what it's worth, I'll give you my word-Daniel concluded turning his back again to retrieve his clothes placed on a chair next to the bed.
Molly handed him the bottle and he approached the baby's face, until the latex teat was between Hamish's lips.
Many times over the years he had seen the genius man get angry for a nonsense or because of the prolonged absence of a serial killer "worthy of that name", so he had devised tactics to relax Sherlock and bring a smile back on the detective’s lips: tea was always a good choice, other times it was enough just a phone call to Molly asking the woman to find a poor corpse donated to science ready to be sacrificed to Sherlock’s enormous curiosity and intellect.
John met the other's gaze and Sherlock clearly saw the fight between confusion and anger, before the latter prevailed.
In response came the melodious sound of the violin that, as so many times in the past, would have been his lullaby.
-So, I wonder- Jack's voice brought him back to reality - Why look for replacements when he can have the original? -
In the kitchen for a few minutes only the sound of forks against the plate was heard, dampened by the music still coming out of the stereo speakers.
It was clearly the oldest, as demonstrated by the texts in various languages all perfectly aligned on the bookshelves and the various portraits that adorned the walls.
A tiny part of Greg’s brain, which is still rational, made him realize how painful those words were and how much in Mycroft's attitude, until then catalogued as furious and authoritarian, was actually hurt by something that had been tearing the man apart for several days.
Jack remained silent, considering how to start the talk and what words to use: it was clear that the detective wanted as much information as possible, but at the same time Jack felt a duty to protect John's privacy.
For a few minutes Greg worked with the kettle and the cups, fixing everything neatly, and then turning back to John.
-Then how do you explain the fact that they both took the poison at the same time but the girl manage to survive?- Sally asked, trying to avoid a fight between the two men.
"Unfortunately my dear, your guest decided to go his own way" Mycroft informed him, bringing the detective's attention back to him.
It was then that, sitting behind his desk, he had taken his phone in his hands and, instead of sending a message to Sherlock, sent one to Jack, asking for help, receiving a positive response a few minutes later.
If things would gone wrong, John would not lose just a warm body, he would lose his roommate, his consultant detective, his legalized adrenaline... he would lose everything.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders, as if all this was not about him, but did not hint at moving, or loosening the embrace that bound him to John.
-During an investigation my full attention will be dedicated to the work, everything else will be white noise for me...-he continued.
He took a deep breath and passed his hand through his disheveled hair, never turning his gaze away from his partner’s eyes.
"You are right" said the detective, clearly reading that thought on the doctor's face. "We already know that we want to spend the rest of our life together, so let me woo you, let me convince you that there is nothing else in the world that I desire more than you, and that will never come the day when I will ask you to leave Baker Street" Sherlock said in a calm, deep voice.
This was the first thought that crossed Sherlock's mind when the first sound his ears heard on a damp April morning was a song blaring in the apartment.
"Thus with a kiss I die...-he said to himself, attracting the attention of those present in the room and interrupting the conversation.
-They took the poison, they both wanted to end it convinced that they could continue this romantic and wonderful love story in the afterlife.
When he opened his eyes again, the first thing he noticed was the change of light in the room, now considerably diminished leaving the room wrapped in a semi-darkness.
Sherlock was sitting on the floor, on his knees, a dozen bath toys placed a short distance away on the floor, both arms in the tub, one committed to supporting Hamish's back and the other to rinse the soap that covered Hamish’s belly.
He pulled it out of the closet cautiously and observed it: it had been three years since he had last worn it, and all that time he had felt naked, as if another part of himself had passed away.
Sherlock's eyes followed John's limping figure until it disappeared on the stairs leading to his room.
Ever since he had seen John with Sarah, he had always tried to split John Watson his friend and blogger from John "Three Continents" Watson, a charming man who needed just a few jokes and a smile to bring his conquest to bed.
"You're back" said Mycroft, reading on the man's body the hours he spent searching for the boy and the hours of frustrating waiting spent on a hard-plastic chair in a waiting room in a hospital.
He was surprised that John was aware of his relationship with Mycroft and wanted to ask him so many questions, but it was clear that this was not the right time.
You know I can imagine you clearly scolding him for his behavior? I don't know what I would give to hear your colorful reproaches and see his face- John commented, sinking his hands into the pockets of his coat to fight the cold and smiling slightly.
- I would never compare myself with such ordinary and mundane people... You know how boring normal people can be- Sherlock commented.
-Okay. I'm not going to pay for your information, but it would mean a lot to me if you told me everything you know... Especially if you're aware of  something that can help me solve this case - Greg said, his eyes again on the boy’s face - Aren't you afraid that this guy might hurt any of you guys? -he added then.
Until he could get rid of that image and the anger that raided him every time, he couldn't think of a possible future with Sherlock.
Wrapped in his Belstaff and the ever-present blue cashmere scarf, the detective followed John and Emma down the stairs leading to the front door, always accompanied by the cheerful chatter of the little girl, who seemed intent on telling John everything that had happened to her in the weeks when they had not seen each other.
John looked at Greg, clearly amused by the brief exchange, looking for a topic of conversation to solve the embarrassment, but Emma beat him on time once more, this time watching Sherlock.
For a few moments in the living room silence returned, while Greg thought back in his mind about what they had said and how to solve that problem, and Sherlock moved his gaze alternately between Greg and his mobile phone, needing to know where John was and how he was.
-The first time I took some sedatives was after I got back from the hospital... According to the doctors, I needed to sleep, and the pills would "help" me recover from what had happened to me.
I don't want Hamish to have nightmares tonight... Why don't you update me on the latest cases you've had instead?
Sherlock rubbed the tip of his nose against the hot spot behind his ear, a hand on his chest on John’s heart, as if he wanted to control John's pulse.
Sherlock smiled in return, moving closer to John’s face, skimming the tip of John’s nose with his own and bringing their lips together.
-That’s why he doesn't want to have kids! He thinks we’re too old and he's scared of the idea that if we had a baby, he could die when it’s still a kid- Greg said staring at Sherlock.
Back in the living room, John found Jack busy making the last recommendations to his daughter, while Mrs. Holmes was busy texting on her phone.
A satisfied smile appeared on John's face, before regaining control of himself and looking up again at Mycroft.
Lestrade's work problems were of little interest to him either: he certainly considered him one of the few friends in the world, but Lestrade knew what he was up against from the moment he asked him to cooperate in his first case.
Sherlock stood a few moments in silence, surprised at how Molly had been able to interpret his silences and his true intentions.
The woman nodded, and started to say something else, but changed her mind and embraced him, lacing her arms around the man's square shoulders.
Sherlock stood up and walked a few steps away from her, his hands behind his back, missing for a moment his black coat.
He had just passed the sliding doors of the clinic when three journalists moved almost in unison towards him, with smartphones pointed at him for a statement on the return of the "great" Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock read the sense of helplessness and the suicidal thoughts that had overwhelmed John on his return to London in the tension of his face and shoulders, but merely nodded.
Although John couldn't wait to live that experience, he had put aside his lusty desires in the last few days (despite Sherlock having gone out of his way to tease him), because a part of him did not feel comfortable about having sex with Hamish in the room.
During the hours when he found himself alone with his thoughts, without Hamish to take care of or without John to observe, Sherlock thought carefully about his current situation with John.
I would have done the same thing, you know that, but you know as well as I do that we are the boring part of the couple- John pointed out. -Our partners are two of the most insecure and low-self-esteemed men I've ever known... You saw what happened last week between Sherlock and that witness - John reminded him trying to prove his thesis.
-And I don't know what to do because... Yes, you are right: I'm totally in love with Sherlock... You know? You and he would have got along very well once your lecture was over.
A warmth invaded Sherlock's face, leading him to untie the first button of his coat and giving rise to an amused smile on Jack's face.
-Obviously not if we're here to put your pieces back together!- exclaim the inspector, venting his frustration.
- Dr. Watson discovered a side of himself that he wasn't fully aware of when you two lived together...
Raising his eyes to the detective's face, John knew that this idea was not really as absurd as it first seemed: they had to start somewhere to rebuild their relationship.
The next moment he began to sing in a low, sensual voice trying to imitate the singer, his lips a short distance from the detective's left ear.
For once, Sherlock had let John approach him and overtake him, walking unhurriedly and enjoying the cold evening air.
Following his example, Sherlock kissed him, gently stroking his lips several times, before moving away and latching loosely his arms around John's waist again.
The two men followed Mr. Watson into the house to the living room where the elderly man stood at the doorstep of the room, glanced briefly at John who had dropped on the couch almost like dead weight,  heedless of his hands dirty of red paint and then went back staring at Sherlock, a short distance from himself.
John focused on the book he had in his hands and the music that had always helped him overcome the silence of the empty apartment and slowly forgot the presence of the intruder, until his cup of tea was empty.
John was not ashamed to admit that probably without his sister, and the close circle of friends, he would not have come out of the black hole that had threatened several times to swallow him.
She was there to see him, to reassure herself, to be sure that he was fine and that three years spent killing and catching international criminals had not had any traumatic consequences on him.
Hands clasped next to his mouth, Sherlock thought carefully, feeling the nicotine circulating and tidying up his confused thoughts.
-John goes to clubs every Monday! Doesn't he get enough help on those occasions? - blurted the detective.
-Thank you... I can handle a meeting with heads of state ready to slit my throat without even a palpitation, but that little girl scares me a little- he admitted lowering his voice slightly so as not to be heard by Emma.
In the last few days the doctor had noticed the looks Sherlock had sent him when he thought he was distracted, he had felt the warmth that that enormous intelligence unleashed when it was on him, but he had controlled himself and tried to be unperturbed.
-Mh... You write that you can recognize a airplane pilot by his thumb...-started John between morsels.
But, of course, no one was happy to see their secrets revealed in front of strangers, especially from a six-year-old.
-Jack's a military man, he's in high-risk missions: bomb alarms terrorism, stuff like that, but spent a few years in Iraq in special forces.
Without speaking, Mycroft walked to the couch and look at the child for a few moments, before raising his eyes and meeting Sherlock's.
Interpreting the meaning hidden behind his question Mycroft allowed himself a slight smile clearly amused.
-Yes,  master...-replied Greg with a lower and clearly mischievous voice. -And don't you fall asleep in your armchair as usual, you know it's terrible for your back-
The next moment his eyes met those of the detective and the two men stared in silence, while John eagerly looked at the other's face, as if he wanted to imprint him in the memory: his eyes quickly caressed the cheekbones pronounced that had always fascinated him, his nose as straight as a sword and that mouth so perfect that it seemed drawn.
On a normal day, Mycroft Holmes' cellphone receives an average of fifty texts and twenty-nine phone calls.
In the empty apartment, Sherlock looked up from the microscope and, after taking a deep breath as if he needed to regroup the pieces of himself that had run down the stairs with John, stood up and walked in measured steps towards his bedroom to get the ultrasound machine.
The British official was clearly uncomfortable, not because of yet another intemperance of Sherlock, but because of what had happened in front of him a few seconds earlier.
There were a myriad of things waiting for him outside of that plane, all his work of the previous three years would have been scrutinized, to check that everything had been done in the utmost legality, but that was the least of his problems.
Mycroft had remained silent, unable to find the right answer, and that was when Greg intervened to help his partner out of that impasse.
At the time he had misclassified them as signs of disapproval, of reproach, without ever seeing them for what they really were: the desire for something you know will never be yours.
John had expected everything that morning except to address again that conversation; the last time he and Sherlock had spoken about the birth of that little girl,  hard-to-digest truths had come to light,at least for John,  and although the doctor had continued in those weeks to look after the girl and the baby’s health, John and Sherlock had not talked about it again.
I will produce the best honey of the last twenty years and you can finally write that book that you have been postponing for a long time...-said Sherlock without false modesty or doubts, as if he could see clearly in their future.
Despite the mask of indifference that Sherlock habitually wore, John could clearly see the various emotions that animated the detective: the joy of being the three of them together, the uncertainty of not knowing, for the first time, how to behave in John’s presence, the fear that this was only a special occasion due to Hamish's presence.
As soon as he had read the message the first instinct had been to take a taxi and get away as quickly as possible from there, perhaps wandering the streets of London until his frozen brain had provided him with a possible destination and a place to think peacefully for a few hours.
-At the time I didn't give much weight to it, but in the last few years I started to notice some unexpected things.
I would say that he underwent a cycle of chemotherapy, he had early positive results, which would explain why hair loss is limited only to the base of the skull, but he needed a second cycle and when it became clear that there no hopes he would make it, they made the suicide pact- concluded in a professional tone, but with a slight smile.
Trying to get a hold of himself, not to let the incredulous expression that had surely appeared on his face shine through, the detective shrugged his shoulders.
"No, I didn't want to be contaminated by Mycroft's germs" he said, his arm still outstretched toward her while waiting for Molly to take the bottle.
That clarification struck him: no one had ever been as proud of his qualifications as Sherlock, not even his parents.
All I can do is check her and her baby's blood pressure, as I did today, but with a closer examination I would be able to act on time in case there's some problem-concluded John.
Sherlock turned to the woman and, after raising his eyes again to the sky, dedicated his attention to her.
"You know that I’ll take every chance to put my hands on you... - Jack joked with a smile in his voice.
"), one hand caressing John's warm skin, mumbling when John's stocky, callous fingers moved from his shoulders to his chest, stopping on Sherlock’s right side before swiftly slipping under the fabric of his t-shirt on his abdomen, tracing with his fingertips the scars that covered his white skin, caressing them with infinite tenderness and inherent sadness for not being able to protect his lover from danger.
The little girl had shaken her head, losing interest in her conversation with Mycroft and returning to her book.
- He will tell you that he did it out of boredom, to help his own cognitive processes, but the truth is that the death of Alastair has completely destroyed his spirit... And I couldn't protect him.
-How many times did Greg show up on time? Every time we are forced to reheat the food because of the dear Inspector- replied Jack.
Sherlock played for a few seconds with the glass of whiskey he had in his hand and wondered for the umpteenth time how much longer he would have to wait and what the hell was he thinking when he had let himself be persuaded to be there that evening.
The bed was still set against a wall, to the right of the three-drawer dresser that had always contained his clothes and in front of the desk with the expected lamp, his companion of many nights spent studying.
-The scar on the right eyebrow, the left wrist clearly weaker than the right one, sign of an old fracture never perfectly healed, the tooth slightly broken and the tendency to show special attention whenever mistreated or abused minors are involved, an empathy superior to the professionalism required- listed Sherlock promptly, making the blonde smile.
John shook his head and turned that small smile at the detective, sure that it would be enough to reassure him.
He looked away from the door and there, standing on the sidewalk in front of his parents' house, he found Sherlock Holmes in all its glory: a pair of black trousers, a grey shirt covered almost certainly by a hidden black jacket from the expected coat.
Also, Angelo's would not be the right place as everyone already thinks we are a couple-added the black-haired man.
John leaned more on his body and checked that there were no marks around his neck and  when he lifted slightly the collar of the trench coat and shirt John saw a purple bruise no bigger than a penny: a hickey, and judging by the discoloration it must have been done no more than twenty-four hours before.
With the same question in their minds the two men stared, motionless on the dance floor, but still in each other's arms.
That morning, when he had phoned Mrs. Hudson to ask her what time he had to pick her up to accompany her to the cemetery, the woman had kindly thanked him, but had informed him that that year she would do without that visit.
A flat screen tv was placed on the wall at the bottom of the room, perfectly in front of the sofa; a desk was on the right side of the room with a laptop and everything needed to work arranged neatly on the coffee table.
She was a Dominatrix and was the only human being to get Sherlock Holmes' attention beyond James Moriarty.
It was then that John promised himself that he would not permit it: he would not allow Sherlock to reduce him like that.
Although unconvinced by the accuracy of the address, Sherlock paid for the ride and got out of the cab that left immediately.
"Is there anything in particular that I shouldn't talk about with your mother? “John asked, looking at the detective.
-Because you wouldn't like it... I mean, you'd like it, but I don't think we should do it here in front of everyone- John explained.
-I'M A SOLDIER SHERLOCK! I fought against the enemies of the Country, I killed for you, I was taken hostage and they stuffed me with plastic, I let you drug me for your experiments and lie to me shamelessly because of The Woman.
Sherlock had always tried to hide his drug-addicted past from the other man; it was part of his life, but from day one of  his main goal had been to hide from John the extent to which he had lowered himself in order to have a fix, the nights spent on the street, or that time when the overdose had been almost wanted, trying instead to fascinate John with his intelligence, his deductions and his work.
Emma stopped to greet Mrs. Hudson who, as every time when the child was their guest, had made chocolate and blueberry muffins just for her; for nearly an hour Emma and Mrs. Hudson sat in the woman's kitchen, and the little girl recounted what had happened to her since the last time they had seen each other.
The guilt that he carried inside for not being with her in the last moments of her life still burned even though years had passed and John was convinced that that pain would never fade completely.
For his part, John just wanted to get back out on the porch and continue his work before the paint cooled down, without having to deal with a complicated talk that would bring with it shouts and accusations.
It took me a couple of hours, how long will it take him? -he asked, trying to apply logic as always to the tangle of feelings that he felt and that destabilized him.
John Watson, the clothes put on in a hurry, the military bag on one shoulder, in front of the door of 221 Baker Street; the next photo depicted him moving quickly towards the subway stop not far away, his shoulders straight in the typical military pose that the British official had so often seen him during Sherlock's absence.
Trying to help him, Mycroft pulled a manila-colored folder out of his door glove compartment and handed it to him.
Finally, before he showed up at Baker Street, he had checked John's movements, making sure that the man was safe and sound, and that there was someone with him to help him get through that situation.
Sherlock stared at her a few moments before nodding, only to take the position that had always helped him reflect.
Tell me what really happened- Mycroft said, letting the anxiety about the outcome of that confrontation shine through for the first time in his voice.
After a few more moments of silence, Mycroft decided it was time to address the main topic, the one that mattered the most to his brother.
Moments later, the doctor shook his head and called himself an idiot: Sherlock would have simply asked him what he needed without too many pleasantries and with the certainty of seeing his wishes granted.
The detective snorted, a sour response on the tip of his tongue, but froze and opened the door even more to enter the bathroom, going to sit on the ground right in front of Emma.
Words had never been his forte and he was convinced that in a situation like theirs they would not help his case... He needed something to catch John off guard, something that would make him gasp.
The woman took a sip from her beer and reflected for a few moments, the three men's attention on her, before shrugging her shoulders.
Sherlock shrugged off at those words, while accepting a toy that Hamish was giving him to attract his attention and smiling at the child.
John walked in the kitchen, trying to fill the silence that had descended into the room: he filled and put on the kettle, took three clean cups and arranged in each a tea bag, opened the pantry in search of some chocolate biscuit aware that chocolate biscuits always put Sherlock in a good mood and put the sugar bowl close to the detective's cup.
The developments made in recent weeks were undone by the constant presence of journalists, camped outside the door, and by John's total closure towards Sherlock: there were no more cups of tea strategically placed next to the sofa, the reassuring presence of the doctor in the drawing-room gone.
In a few hours John would be home and finally he could explain to the man the reasons that had prompted him to stage his death.
The elegant clothes that a few hours ago in Sherlock's eyes had been the preparations for a romantic date, now took on a totally different meaning: they demonstrated the strength and courage of that enormous enigma that in his eyes was John Watson.
Strangely, John could not give an answer: in the past he would steal the microphone from the detective to proclaim for the umpteenth time his heterosexuality and specify that the relationship between them was pure and simple friendship.
In the brief silence that followed, Sherlock glanced at his mother, aware that the woman was watching everything carefully, looking for the possible connections between Sherlock and the two newcomers: should he do the introductions?
Perhaps even in this case, as with most aspects of their shared life, John should let Sherlock decide: he would follow Sherlock’s step, adapting to his decisions.
Perhaps being a father was not so difficult, Sherlock thought again holding Hamish against his chest, his gaze once again lost out of the window where, in the brief interlude, a car that he had seen too many times had appeared.
If the living room of Baker Street was an explosion of chaos, with its skull, moose head and the various volumes that Sherlock left everywhere, this room was the complete opposite: everything was arranged in a functional way and at the limit of obsession.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile, that special smile he reserved only for the man in front of him, watching him take a sip from his cup and grimace at the lukewarm tea.
To those words, a warm applause rose from the group of people sitting in the front rows representing John's family, leading the doctor to smile again, despite the nervousness that radiated from his posture.
He undressed and got into the shower under the hot water jet, taking care of his own hair until they were back to the original color, then focusing on sore muscles, and coming out of the shower only when the water began to cool slightly.
Those words would have offended him in the past, but now they seemed to be the most suitable: it was clear that Sherlock was trying to draw attention to himself, to avoid the most inconvenient questions.
John stretched himself, tearing a groan from his lips for the atrophied muscles of his shoulder, before sitting down, giving his sister a glimpse.
- For once your omniscience came in handy- he added, leaning close to his partner to kiss him on the cheek.
-Ok Sherlock, but on one condition... As you said, we are about to become a family, but I realized that in the last few days I have deliberately stepped aside so as not to interfere in your father-son relationship...-he confessed.
"I would usually have had Detective Lestrade accompany me to the cemetery to bring flowers to your grave, but given your presence here, I think I'm going to skip the appointment this year" said the woman, making the detective smile.
He quickly filled it with food he knew would meet the detective's favor, continuing to call himself an idiot the whole time, then left it on the table to pick up the chopsticks from one of the drawers.
The tension in Sherlock's muscles increased, causing him to regret the last comment, but a slight annoyance caused by his previous thoughts did not leave him, almost feeling justified for those words that had clearly hurt the detective.
-And did they keep their promise? Did they show you the world? -Sherlock asked him, a veil of irony in his eyes.
I think they first bonded for their common past in the Army, then they... they liked each other and became...-
Hamish needs you almost as much as you need him" said Molly, fascinated by the scene in front of her.
John looked back at Jack, who, unaware of what had happened between the two men, had continued to talk to him about his new flame.
Just as that thought formed in John’s mind, Sherlock moved his lips, beginning to cover his face with small kisses, then moving down, on his chin, neck, his chest despite still being covered by clothes, while hands with long and nimble fingers took care of his belt, quickly unlacing it, then switching to the button of the jeans and the zipper.
-Sherlock, I don't really want to waste time with your riddles. It took me half an hour to calm Baby Girl!
Baby Girl lifted the sweater that covered her belly and John applied the contrast gel before taking the wand and moving it over her belly.
Determined to enjoy the Pride, John had put Hope on his shoulders and with her improvised a few dance moves to the rhythm of the music that was coming out loud from the speakers, while Greg was walking by his side holding Misha’s hand.
A different humanity comes out as soon as it gets dark, and you feel like you're in a completely different city without even coming out of the neighborhood - John commented, turning his head slightly towards Sherlock, aware that he was also giving voice to his thoughts.
Sherlock stared at him for a few moments, unsure whether to grant him that satisfaction or not, before making a brief nod.
"But as I said, there is a solution to our problem" Sherlock said, bringing the focus of both men to the main topic.
After all, only those who did not know the inebriation of London life, or those who were running away like him, decided to confine themselves to that small town, so quiet and boring.
The next moment, a figure walked to their table; John barely had time to look up at Angelo, followed a short distance by the efficient waiter, before the man froze in the center of the restaurant, between the tables, an incredulous expression on his face.
Moving almost as fast, Sherlock passed the couch and climbed on to the table in front of it to regain the lost meters and arrive at the door at the same time as John.
"It's time for you to hold your son" the woman explained, before walking in the living room followed a few seconds later by the detective.
The two questions fired at the same time by two different journalists infuriated him even more: what right had those people to torment him?
Aware of his own failure, John let his head fall against the back of the sofa, his eyes closed so as not to see the disappointed expression in Sherlock's eyes and licked his lips before speaking.
He stood motionless, lying on his back on his bed for a few moments and listened to the conversation coming to him through the closed door.
- After your death, he came here with Greg and asked if he could see your body, but I forbade him as you told me.
For a long moment he stood still, inhaling the old smell of lavender that he had always connected with his parents' sheets.
“It seems that I’m interrupting a picnic... And here I thought you all came to march for the rights of the community" said a rumbling voice that John will recognize everywhere.
-Which translated into English means you could eat a whole cow- teased John with a smile, moving in his embrace to take the carton of eggs and milk out of the fridge and close the fridge door.
A man like John, so attached to all those social platitudes that Sherlock had never paid attention to, had shown his allegiance to Sherlock in life and even death, until the detective returned from the "world of the dead."
Greg frowned, surprised by those words; everything could be said of his partner, but not that he let himself go to such a "human" feeling as fear.
"I know you already have plans for tonight but are you sure you don't want some company?" he asked when he met the doctor's eyes.
Without any consideration for the body hidden by the duvet, he pressed the switch next to the door and flooded the room with light getting a groan in reaction from his "guest" moments later.
Without all those problems their newborn relationship would have been idyllic: at the beginning of a relationship two people can’t seem to take their hands off each other longer than the time it takes to eat or take a shower (when it is not done together) or sleep.
"You were dead, you bloody idiot!" he replied, venting the anger that animated him from the moment he saw Sherlock in the back of the room.
-So, how does it work? Are you going to let me give you a blow job and then show me your badge or do you want to show it now to get free treatment? -he asked Greg with a cold voice.
Sherlock hold the man's gaze for a few moments, noting the surprise that had appeared in his eyes to find him in that "intimate" position with Hamish, before he took the few steps that separated him from the living room.
Ah, and you're not allowed to leave slamming the door like you always do- she added an instant later.
He let go another sigh and threw his head backwards, looking for a few seconds at the sky above himself before returning to lay his gaze over the tombstone.
-So... Sherlock Holmes - said John's voice as warm and soft as the chocolate that covered the cheesecake.
John flashed him a smile and recognized Greg among the various cops who were busy at the crime scene.
Given his experience with drugs, he would never forgive me, probably he would have criticized me for the pathetic and boring substance that had caused my addiction.
Did you want to tell me that you didn't need me anymore, or that there's no place in your life for me anymore?
John cleared his throat, taking that thought away from his mind and took off his coat, turning his back on Sherlock.
The ten days that had just passed had been the strangest of his life: Sherlock had returned, but the atmosphere inside the 221B was the same as the previous three years.
When I started to recover ten days later, they told me that the damage to my shoulder was almost certainly irreparable and that I could no longer operate.
Feeling slightly more humane, Greg closed the water and exited the shower, tied a white towel around his hips and grab another to dry the rest of his body.
-As soon as I turned Moran into the FBI's hands, I took a flight to London... and here I am-concluded Sherlock by placing his joint hands under the chin.
"Detective Dimmock" greeted Sherlock by walking away from the door- It's a pleasure to see you again- he added then out of sheer formality.
Irene shrugged her shoulders, finally taking off her sunglasses and laying them next to her glass on the table.
When John finally managed to return to his office, he was decidedly more confused and slightly worried that, considering Sarah's opinion on his clothes, he would have more luck impressing Sherlock if he showed up naked.
-Would you like something to drink Mr. Holmes? - Jack asked when he entered the kitchen and took a bottle opener from a drawer.
-I have other plans. That include neither visiting Mummy nor reviewing the last three years of my life with your MI6 lackeys- he said making his priorities clear.
In the seven years of their friendship, Sherlock Holmes had repeatedly accused him of being an idiot, yet it took him a moment to put the pieces together.
After all, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade had listened to him, and they were as involved as John, so he was certain that finally John would listen to him.
-No, not that I remember, no. Luckily there’s Uncle Greg taking care of these details, isn't it, Hamish? -
Reluctantly, he sat up, taking the red robe that Sherlock rarely used and trying to make as little noise as possible, he walked out of the room and closed the door behind him.
Before long, John managed to get three fingers inside Sherlock, moving slowly and carefully, until he knew that the man was ready.
He read it in the strained muscles of his back, in the sluggishness of his movements and above all he understood it by the stubborn way in which John refused to meet his gaze, or even just to acknowledge his presence.
-Just because I let him... We are committed to testing the theory of Archimedes-replied the detective, removing a damp curl from his forehead.
"What will he say if you and I "get back together"?" asked Jack, folding his fingers in the air to form quotation marks.
-If I am not a complete failure with this procedure, in thirteen weeks you will have a little girl-John said to her in a reassuring tone, aware of all the difficulties that Baby Girl would have to face immediately after giving birth.
What did he want to hear? Did he want a passionate declaration of love in public in front of journalists, or to hear Sherlock demean his and John feelings, as usual?
Defeated and determined not to cause trouble in the restaurant, John slightly removed the chair from the table and sat down, his eyes still focused on his opponent.
You have no idea how much diapers and clothes they need, not counting bottles, but in this you are advantaged since you can breastfeed her.
Baker Street 221 was shrouded in silence and the darkness of the night and for a brief moment the two men stood in front of each other not knowing how to end that long and strange day, until John unexpectedly made his way to Sherlock's room to return a few moments later, the fingers of the left hand tightened around the handle of the leather case of the violin.
How could they be so stupid? Sherlock wondered once more, as he sat up and repeatedly passed his fingers between his black curls in a raged gesture.
Aware that he would not be able to regain his sleep, John let go of a frustrated groan and got out of bed, headed like every morning to the bathroom for the morning shower that would help him to clear his mind.
Not now, of course, not with all the problems we have at the moment, but definitely in a couple of years I would try to put a ring on his finger.
You both suffered because of the feelings you had for me and the same happened to Irene: she tried to use me to achieve her purpose, to gain some advantage against my brother, but her feeling towards me was her undoing-
-John is the proudest man I've ever known, he never talked about how he felt during your absence, and I'm sure you'd do the same in his place-she added, her voice slightly lower.
"Obviously Sherlock’s good manners are already rubbing off on you…" said Jack, an amused smile on his lips.
Jack was aware that they had to protect their friend from that cumbersome ghost that had materialized again in their lives.... No matter what.
He took off his coat as well, hanging it neatly by the door, and went to meet him, staying a short distance from the black-haired man.
Hinting a small smile, Sherlock raised the empty glass in his friend's direction in the mock toast and watched him for a few more second, until John let his gaze down, turning his back on him towards the bar.
The silence fell again upon them as the doctor rethought the conversation he had that morning with his partner and the valid motivations Sherlock had found to convince him that it was not a utopian dream.
"If I'm not mistaken, we were talking about your relationship with John" Greg said, trying to divert the conversation that, surely, would not be pleasant.
-Why would I? Because we have this wonderful relationship without secrets? Or because you become an expert on the joys of fatherhood thanks to Hamish? -John asked him biting.
You don't spend two years of your life with Sherlock Holmes without learning the tricks... or at least some of them.
He came from a rich family like me; his father had founded a publishing house... We became lovers three months after we met and he was with me when I learned of my father's death-
-Of course, it was time for Baby Girl to open her eyes on her situation instead of basking in stupid illusions that would not help her at all- he replied perfectly at ease, despite the seethed glare that did not seem intent on abandoning him.
After shaking it a couple of times, John moved the bottle close to Hamish’s face who, hungry, quickly brought it to his mouth, starting to suck with voracity.
With a frowned forehead, too many questions that crowded his mind, aware that the doctor was making small talk to calm the atmosphere and, at the same time, aware that after the mere exchange of jokes Boss had begun to ignore him, Sherlock continued to observe the interaction between the two  men and wonder how long they had known each other, how long  John had started to provide medical care to his network of informants and why he had never known anything about it.
It's not my medical field, but so far, I've managed to get away with it thanks to my memories and notes from University and the internship...
I was a very good cicerone! I also managed to get the London Eye open after closing time just for us.
Only thanks to Clara, the two brothers had reconnected and then lost again due the divorce and Harry’s alcoholism, but especially Sherlock that Harry saw as a leech who took advantage of John's goodness of soul.
The detective did not even give him time to finish the sentence, but he latched his arm around his shoulders and drew him closer to himself laying his lips against Mycroft’s, caressing them several times with infinite sweetness.
On a day considered moderately stressful for the average English man, Mycroft Holmes' cellphone receives a minimum of seventy texts and fifty phone calls, wherever in the world he is.
-This is where you're wrong! It is not a date because: 1) Sally knows very well that I’m with someone; 2) You were invited to come with us, but you decided not to come because you think the movie is boring- John pointed out patiently.
In the eighteen months they had lived together, the times Sherlock had mentioned his mother could be counted on the tips of one hand: John knew that both Holmes men were very close to the woman, despite during their childhood  she had  not been present because of her work, leaving much of their education to nannies and their father.
His father had entered the kitchen while John was busy buttering a slice of toast, the tea already infused on the table in the mug he had always used as a child.
The detective stared at his children for a few moments, observing their simple interactions with the same serenity that flood him every time he was with them.
Sitting at the kitchen table, a half-empty cup of tea in front of himself, John stared at his phone for a few minutes, looking for the right words to start the conversation; their relationship, thanks to Sherlock's songs was not as cold as at first, but they had not yet returned to being "John & Sherlock", so how would he deal with the issue?
Greg stiffened, suddenly on alert; the charm and the ironic smile had disappeared from the boy's face suddenly, giving way to a serious and cold mask.
-I promise this is the only time I'm going to use you for an experiment, but it was necessary to get John home.
-Are you going to tell me what happened? Or would you rather I take you to the station?- Greg asked him, meddling in the conversation.
It's been a bit of a lackluster evening. Greg got more offers than me, but obviously he turned them all down.
In addition, he also recognized that glitter that shone in the girl's laughing eyes and made him realize that, although they were still children, Alison was really convinced that she had found the love of her life.
Just for once Sherlock could have left him alone, giving him time to reflect on what had happened; he needed peace of mind, isolation to have the necessary mental lucidity to decide about his own future.
John felt a shiver running down his back the moment before Sherlock moved away and went back to look at the restaurant's blue door.
Sherlock went to meet his lips, touching them softly, sinking his fingers into the man's hair, biting John’s lower lip and then opening his lips to meet the other's tongue.
-If I went to "Pride" tomorrow night, everyone would know my face, and not because I'm a regular visitor, but because of my "lost love"...
Sherlock had repeatedly expressed his contrary opinion on the matter, commenting that the readers of the blog would find it terribly boring, but John, always an hopeless romantic, was instead firmly convinced that even a small case like that (two teenagers in love who decide to be together until the extreme consequence), would have stirred a fair amount of interest.
-Everyone knew him: he called himself "Prince Henry" cause he was convinced he looked like the real prince- said Tommy with irony.
The detective approached him and for a few minutes they walked in silence, until they arrived in a narrow and smelly alley; the boy held his back against a wall and stared at him.
Mycroft had spent those hours in his studio, trying to occupy his mind with the many files he had carried with him in his briefcase, but he surrendered when he realized that his concentration was focused elsewhere.
The next moment he had removed the bow from the strings, carefully placed the instrument in the case and headed to his room, leaving fifteen minutes later wearing black shoes, black trousers that highlighted his narrow hips and the purple shirt that had always been one of John's favorites.
Actually, I'm sure he'd say the same thing if I asked him the same question... But you see, I know the truth- Mycroft confided almost in a confidential tone.
So, it was a surprise when he moved his eyes to his left, and he noticed that he had arrived in Vauxhall and, standing at a traffic light, saw the imposing building on the other side of the bridge, completely immersed in darkness to the point of seeming abandoned.
-He told me that the first time it was in Berlin, and that you came on to him- retold John, receiving a nod from Irene. -He also told me that it happened five more times after your first time- concluded the doctor.
"What are you and Hamish doing here?" he asked, straightening his back, his gaze fixed on the detective.
John sighed and decided to open his own sandwich, despite not having much appetite, but he was aware that he had to eat something; that night his stomach would stop him from eating even a pin and the last thing he wanted was to ruin that date because of him fainting.
"Then could you tell me what you're dying to say and stop being so mysterious?" blurted out Sherlock, barely controlling his frustration.
Greg allowed himself a little smile, sincerely proud of the progress made by his friend, and reminded himself to call John after dinner to get the last details.
Those men never meant anything, they never had a fucking chance with me, none of them, no matter how hard they try to impress me.
-Not just intellectual- said John, before rubbing his face with both hands- I don't want to talk about this... Not with you-added, the voice slightly distorted by the covered face.
The detective had left the choice to him, it was clear from his words that he would wait years if John would ask him.
It was then that his father's voice had reached him from the corridor leading to the kitchen, removing him from his thoughts and ripping it from the labyrinth that had become his mind.
-Your mother? What are you doing here? But why don't you want to let her in? -asked John, ending their embrace.
-Isn't that obvious? Even Mycroft has to explain to you every little thing? -he asked, the first hints of impatience in the voice.
"You have found your lost boy” said the British official, unable to bear the tense silence between them.
Without paying attention to any notification, John selected the list of the last calls and pressed Greg's number, starting the call.
-Right... Ok I’m gonna ask: what's our  problem? -asked John, sitting in his own armchair and leaning forward to retrieve his own teacup.
-Okay. But don't say I didn't warn you-John said starting to search inside the pockets of his coat- Let's see... Does anyone have a candy?- he then asked not having find what he needed.
His mobile phone had been off since the previous day, ever since he had interrupted his phone call with Greg, aware that otherwise Sherlock would engulfed it with texts to convince him to come back, and not even two seconds after turning it back on, an avalanche of texts and multiple voice messages started to show up on his phone.
Perhaps he would have believed him if he had never seen him with Hamish, if he had not just seen the happy and proud smile that had been painted on his face to the little gesture of the child.
But Greg couldn't heed those  considerations, not when the implication contained in Mycroft's words hit him with the force of a punch to the stomach.
There was something about John's past that eluded him, something important, that had helped turn him into the inaccessible stranger.
I imagined that he was one of the youngest analysts,(born in 1920) around 20-ish; so this means that he was 15 years older than Mrs.Holmes(born 1935). They met around 1953 while Mrs. Holmes was a student and got married in 1960. Mycroft was born in 1969 and Sherlock in 1976 when Mr. Holmes was 49 and 56. Mr.Holmes died when Mycroft was 25 and Sherlock was 18 at the age of 74.
Irene too, like Sherlock, had lost weight since the last time he met her; her black hair had been sacrificed for a platinum blonde nuance that reminded him of Marilyn Monroe and had been cut into a bob that reached her ears; her eyes were hidden by a pair of black sunglasses that Irene didn't seem intent on abandoning at the moment and her lips were painted with the same lipstick John had seen so many years before.
As soon as John had left the stage, headed for the small group of friends and family, Sherlock had left the shed, unable to breathe and to stay an extra minute in the shack.
Is that something we need to keep hidden? I'm sure everyone in this neighborhood knows you and is aware of your prowess-Sherlock said in a sharp tone before bringing back his look on Tommy who had observed the exchange in disbelief.
You were close to her during pregnancy, you took care of her and Baby Girl making sure there were no unnecessary problems or risks for mom and daughter...-
-Sherlock with your immense intelligence you decided that jumping off a roof was the only possible solution to save our lives...-
Don't forget that my bedroom is right above yours, I would have known if something had happened- she reminded him.
His sweaters were a perfect disguise, an urban camouflage to confuse the idiots who met him on the street and did not recognize his strength, his military background under the layers of wool and vicuna.
She  was the only one who understood, to  know for some strange reason that I needed to talk about you, but not about the wonderful, crazy man I had lived with  for eighteen months and continued to be a fixed presence in my mind, but that part of you that you had always kept me in the dark about and which had now become inaccessible-concluded.
-Inspector Lestrade! What an honor to have you here... We were so worried about your delay that we were going to call Scotland Yard and arrange a search party-teased him.
Sherlock's thumb, still clenched in his hand, moved slightly starting to caress his knuckles, in an intimate and reassuring gesture, as if he wanted to bring him back to reality, reminding him that at that moment John was there with him, in a restaurant of London and that all was well.
