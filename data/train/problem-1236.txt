Sherlock rolled over and checked his phone, getting up and getting ready to head out. He didn’t change his clothes -- he didn’t care. He wasn’t there to see the band or meet friends. He would just be watching for the dealer. He set out to walk to the bar which wasn’t too far from the flat. The night air was cool, and he enjoyed a cigarette on his walk.
“I didn’t say I didn’t want to -- I just wanted to know why you suggested it and now you’ve told me,” Sherlock said. “Do you want to? Or are you offering just so I can try it?”
"Good," Sherlock said. "Right . . . and how's your day going? Are you doing something with Mrs Hudson?"
“You’ll make new friends at school,” his mum said. “And even though your friendship with John will change, it doesn’t have to end.” She gave his hand a little squeeze. “If you don’t believe us, believe John. I know he understands.”
"You're not in trouble," John said. "I just . . . something happened at work and I don't want you to freak out."
“I’m all right,” she said and took a sip of tea. “Have you been thinking about going back to work, though?” she asked softly.
John nodded, putting his hands into his pockets as they walked through the woods. "I suppose that's everything, then? It seems odd. I feel like I had a lot more in my letters."
“Right,” Sherlock said, reaching for the bag. “No better way to convince me you don’t treat me like a child than to throw away my things. . .” he added as he began to look through the bag.
John's brows furrowed. "Fine. Don't wait up for me. Maybe I'll make plans for tomorrow too since you want to be an arse about it." He walked out of the flat and slammed the door behind him, so upset that he didn't bother with a cab as he stormed off.
Sherlock leaned against the door, listening to the sound of the man’s footsteps down the stairs and then the opening and closing of the front door.
“Because I’m difficult and you’re sensible,” Sherlock said.  He shifted a little lower, moving his mouth down to one of John’s hip bones. He traced his tongue over the contours as his hand began stroking John’s cock again. Eventually he began sucking the head as he began to massage his balls. He took his time -- there was no rush because it was just them and it could be just them in this flat for as long as they wanted.
John ran his hand through his hair, ruffling it even more as he tried to fix it. "You look beautiful and smart too," John said. "You know that shirt is...well, it fits you really well."
“Well, first off, you don’t know that, do you? Maybe it’s exactly the same except another person just happens to be there –- you don’t know for sure since you don’t know what sex is like,” Sherlock said. “Secondly, just shut up about it. I mean, you know I’m not one who is ‘into’ feelings and everything, but I have a feeling this whole conversation is quite insulting to me.”
“I know how to take my own temperature, John,” Sherlock said. Since he was already up, he moved into the kitchen to put the kettle on. “Besides you’re the one who was been exposed – are you feeling all right? You should be honest.”
Sherlock put space between them and reached down, sliding his hand into John’s boxers. He wrapped his fingers around John’s hardening cock. He looked up and kissed his mouth roughly.
“Rest is what you need -- the doctor said it, even Doctor Watson said it. A few days without work and he is part of your work so please, just take a break. Do you want Mother to come stay with you?”
This thought led him to the last time, the man at Molly’s wedding. It was nothing, just a bit of fun really. And it was fun. It felt good. Actually, he remembered, he didn’t even need someone else for that feeling. He stood up to lock the flat door and then lay back down, slipping his hand into his pajama bottoms. He’d just do it to clear his mind, to relax. When it was over, the tension would be gone and he could get up, go to his desk, and figure out how to get his own cases.
After checking his vitals, she said, “Your brother wanted me to ring him when you woke up -- shall I do that now or would you like a little more peace before he arrives?”
Sherlock let John kiss his mouth. He slid his hands around John's waist, pulling him tighter. The sense of relief -- of being home -- felt so good. He tipped his head to deepen the kiss. "I don't like being away from you," he said softly, pulling John even closer. "I need . . . to have you by me."
“That would be fine,” Sherlock said. “Wait, actually -- would it be possible to stop by late afternoon . . . perhaps at the end of your shift?”
It was all annoying him too much so he turned on the television just to have some sound to try to distract him.
Sherlock looked his things all over the floor and then looked up at John’s bedroom door. He stood there for a moment and then stormed off to his bedroom, also slamming the door. Due to his earlier nap and the anger pumping through his body, he knew his only option was his Mind Palace. He lay down and as soon as John made an appearance, Sherlock slammed the door in his mind shut as well.
Sherlock relaxed into this kiss. When it ended, he snuggled in against John and sighed as sleep started to call him. “What are the chances we can just stay in here like this until this whole thing is over?” he asked.
“I never ‘freak out’ and I’m actually offended by that comment,” Sherlock said. “Will this entire conversation be about attacking me?”
Sherlock set the laptop down on the bed. He hadn’t thought this out. He got up and moved to the window for another cigarette. This was probably a stupid idea. Clearly, Sherlock had experience lying, even lying to John, but somehow this felt different and he wondered if he could pull it off. He also knew Mycroft would be furious. Yet, how could he pass up this chance to communicate -- to know for sure that John was all right? He had to think of something. He needed to focus on coming up with a case. He closed his eyes and tried to think, but all he could see was John’s face. He opened them again and thought some more.
It’d been a few days since he’d interacted with the client, so he sent a quick message to say he was still working.
“I don’t have condoms,” Sherlock mumbled, though as soon as he did he realised his timing was not ideal.
"And do you like this as well?" Sherlock asked, turning on his side and snuggling in against John's body.
John looked over at him again and smiled softly. He rubbed Sherlock's hand before pulling his own away. The taxi was stopped in front of the hospital. John paid the driver as they got out and headed inside. "Molly is going to be surprised, I think."
When Sherlock heard noises in the flat, he stayed still, trying to determine whether or not he should get involved. Eventually, he realised he needed the toilet, but he still wasn't sure about getting up. However, when he heard the shower, he thought it'd be safe. He nipped to the bathroom and then went out to get tea and make sure that John was okay. But it wasn't John he saw on the sofa. It was Harry. He turned quickly toward the kettle.
John nodded. "I know, but don't worry about that. We should focus on the case. What did you learn from the bodies?"
"Well, whatever is going on here, I'm glad," she said. "Someone in this family should finally be happy."
“I don’t know. I know I saw someone . . . I thought maybe she had something to do with the case or . . . I don’t know why, maybe she knew you or something. It doesn’t make sense now . . . it was stupid of me. I should’ve just left.”
Sherlock’s body shivered with anticipation as he concentrated on John’s every move. John moved over his hips and followed the dip to the middle. He licked along the shaft before taking him into his mouth. Sherlock exhaled loudly and lifted his head off the bed to watch John. It felt incredible. John glanced up and met his gaze, bobbing his head steadily.
Mycroft grumbled, but he was not unaware of how important John Watson had become to his brother. And how John's presence had been good for Sherlock. Finally, he said, "I'll make some calls."
“He’s been doing a lot of little favours for some reason,” she said, sitting down. “So . . . how have you been?”
But a few hours later he was still lying there staring up at the ceiling. Was he having issues with sleep again? He hadn’t thought he was. It hadn’t seemed as bad since John got here -- obviously with cases he was awake all hours of the night, but on the few breaks they had between work, things had seemed to normalise a little. He still didn’t do well with boredom, but he actually liked just being around John who was willing to at least tolerate Sherlock, whether he was busy or not. He did like being around John -- this living together and working together arrangement was working well for Sherlock Holmes.
John shook his head. "I didn't say you had to leave," he countered. "I wanted you to stay the night."
"I'm in med school, last year," John said. He tried not to smile. He knew that's not what Sherlock was talking about.
Sherlock reached around John’s body with one hand and began to stroke John’s hard cock. He kept rocking John against him, pressing his own cock through his rough trousers against John’s bare skin. His mouth dropped to the top of John’s shoulder, biting it softly.
“Don’t spoil the afternoon with unfounded accusations,” Sherlock said. He sat down in his chair. “Well, that was fun.”
“Wrong,” Sherlock said. “You had an early morning. It was late.” He looked up. “I never said I didn’t want to see you again.”
Sherlock turned a little to see the film, which also gave him an excuse to curl around John. He slid his hand over John's waist and held him. He looked over the film, which was one of his favourites. "Hope you like the film," he said.
"Because you've disrupted my flat and now my work, that's why," Sherlock answered. "And you've upset John."
“I don’t know -- one of those tricks of yours,” Sherlock said. “You occasionally have forced me to reveal things I’ve been hiding -- do one of those things.”
He got up and moved to open the window before lighting a cigarette. What was going on in his head? Why was he still thinking about some random man with bad taste in music? Then he remembered, the man had said he was working. He hadn’t come as a fan, he’d come for a job.
Greg stood up for his desk. “Everyone relax,” he said. “Sherlock, it's more of a personal angle that I need John for. There’s a woman involved. Everyone’s life would be so much easier if she’d talk . . . and John’s better at that kind of thing.”
“Is this a children’s story?” Sherlock asked. “I’m not complaining . . . just curious.” He pulled his legs up under him on the sofa.
"Well, we're here, it's cold, you already have your shirt off, and now I know you like them," Sherlock said. "But it was just an idea . . ."
Sherlock closed his eyes and concentrated on the feeling of John’s lips on his. Yes, this is what he’d wanted. They’d never done it before yet it felt familiar and comforting and good. He pulled his head back and said, “I liked that. Did you?”
John looked over at him, slightly surprised. "Do you feel a little better? Can I see your bruising?"
"Fine," Sherlock said sharply. "I wasn't listening to her -- I spent all afternoon trying to tune her out." He sat down on his chair. "Isn't Clara the ex?"
“I thought everyone was isolating? That’s what you told me – that’s why I couldn’t go out,” Sherlock said.
“A suicide,” Sherlock said. “That wasn’t a suicide.” He stopped abruptly when the server brought over the wine and took their order. After he left, Sherlock took a sip of wine and continued, “I’m sure it’s murder, but the ruling is suicide. I’m trying to get the police to trust me so they re-open the case. And when they do, I plan to have it solved.”
When John brought the sausages over, Sherlock put one on his plate, pressing his knife in to double check that it was cooked. He took a bite. "It's edible," he said with a smile.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock said, taking a long drag on his cigarette. “Not quite cooking, but it’ll be edible.”
“The biscuit’s absorbing the alcohol,” Sherlock said. He stood up and turned on the kettle. “Don’t mock me anyway, I’m convalescing.”
Sherlock pulled his arm. “Let go of me,” he said, looking straight at Jim. “I don’t need your help.”
Sherlock’s attempt to think of nothing led to hours of his revisiting memories, most of which seemed utterly irrelevant at the moment -- riding a horse when he was five, needing stitches when he was ten, his first class at uni, a trip to the dentist. He ended up lost in thoughts, which was precisely the opposite of his plan. Eventually, though, it did exhaust him and he fell into a deep sleep.
John looked around again. "I'm sorry. I feel like I've intruded. I was told a flat was available and that the owner was expecting me -- I didn't mean to barge in like this," he said.
"I'll tell you what," Sherlock said, opening the door for John. "I'll keep the coat -- you can have the hat."
She looked at him for a moment before waving him forward. She followed him out and up the stairs. "It’s in his room? He told you to go in there?"
John undressed and climbed right into bed as soon as he got home. When he was comfortable and starting to doze off, he remembered his research. He sighed and didn't move -- he was too comfortable now. He would deal with it in the morning. He fell asleep and had weird dreams -- he didn't remember them in the morning but when he woke up he was all twisted up in his bed sheets. He untangled himself and stretched before getting up to start his day.
"Don't get yourself worked up -- I said I'll give it to them," Sherlock said. He lay there quietly for a few minutes. "You're not even slightly interested in what I found?" he asked quietly.
Sherlock really hadn’t thought all that much about this silly game after being distracted by Lestrade’s request, but it now kind of seemed important to him. He knew John would need lunch soon and Sherlock didn’t want that to disrupt this non-plan of his, so he made them two sandwiches and set them on plates on the table. He put the kettle on and while he waited for it, he dug out some candlesticks and put those on the table as well.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. “Well, you’re right. Hold on.” He got up and went to his parents’ bedroom door. They were in there, but they were talking. He tapped lightly.
Sherlock was still standing on the other side of his bedroom door, listening. When he could tell John was in the kitchen, he pulled out his phone.
"No one does," John said. "But the situation is serious, so we have to do it. Stay in, wash your hands, don't touch your face, and we'll be fine. We’ve actually been safe staying in, and let’s face it, you’re an expert at social distancing."
“All right, Sherlock told John. We can share this cave. They waited until the morning light, though, to move John in. By then whatever had made the noise outside was gone.”
John smiled and finished his drink, moving a bit closer to Sherlock in the process. "Slow dance or fast dance?" he asked.
"Where are we going?" he asked, giving his head a little shake as if that would help him understand what was happening.
“Don’t worry -- I’ve already sorted all that for you,” Sherlock said. “Your jumpers will donated for medical research.” He laughed at himself a little.
"Is it a scary story?" John asked, taking a sip of whiskey as well and then setting it on the nightstand.
"Good night," he said. For one second he took a step towards Sherlock's room before remembering he couldn't sleep there anymore. He turned for the stairs and hurried up to his own room.
Sherlock read through his Inbox which had nothing of interest. He kept watching for John to come back down, but he didn’t. He slid his phone from his pocket.
“Don’t pout, it’s unattractive,” Sherlock said, repeating something his mother had said to him often. “You can read it when we’re old and open the box.”
Sherlock was quiet for a few moments. “Thank you for telling me,” he said. “That sounds . . . difficult.”
John laced his fingers into Sherlock's hair, trembling at the feel of Sherlock’s mouth. Then Sherlock grabbed one of John’s hands and led it to the waistband of his pants. Together, they pushed the material over his hips until his pants dropped to the floor. They stood together naked. Then Sherlock moved their hands to the front of his body, palming his hardening cock.
Sherlock looked at the plate but didn’t pick up a fork. “Perhaps I’m ill,” he said. “I never get ill. Do I seem ill? I thought you were a doctor, why didn’t you prevent this?”
“Oh, right,” Sherlock said. He rolled over to face the wall. “I’m not saying you have to get another one. I’m just saying it’s okay if you do.”
“Let’s try that,” Sherlock said. He got up and moved over to the sofa next to John. He lay his phone on the cushion between him. “You dial and then put it on speaker.”
Mycroft could see his brother really did not remember anything about the day of the accident. “You were working when it happened,” Mycroft said. “I should hope your brain was at its best. No, Sherlock, you are not going to rehab -- well, not that kind of rehab. You’ve been prescribed rest, relaxation, respite. Well, respite for me at least. No work until you’re well.”
"How could you . . . all this time," John said, moving closer to him. "Do you know what it's been like? What I've been through?"
“I’m not pressuring you – I’m saying you stink,” Sherlock said before disappearing into the bathroom.
They went downstairs to get a taxi. "You can even have wine if you like," Harry said, as she climbed in.  "I'll be fine."
“Perhaps you should see the bedroom,” Sherlock said. “Of course this is all hypothetical, but it is right there, seems silly not to go look at it.” He motioned to the stairs.
John made his way to the bookshop where the notes said the woman works, but by a stroke of luck he spotted her going into a cafe a few streets away. He went inside without a real plan. He got in line a couple people behind her. He noticed when she walked up to the counter they had her order ready -- she must come here a lot. He should add that to the notes. He ordered a tea for himself and followed her out, walking a short distance behind her. He didn't know what he was hoping for in the middle of the day. She went straight to the bookshop, waved at the girl in the front and disappeared into the back. John went inside and browsed the shelves, making his way around slowly, but she never came back out again. Next time he would intercept her at the cafe, since that seemed to be her usual routine. He made a mental note of the time, back tracking to when she was at the coffee shop so he knew what time to get started tomorrow.
Sherlock glanced over. "No," he said. "I'll stay here with you." His face softened a little as he sat back down. "Fine . . . now what?"
Sherlock lifted his hands to the back of John’s head and pulled it toward him. He kissed his mouth softly, letting the kiss linger. “I need you in a way I didn’t think I would,” he said quietly.
“No -- I want to do what we did last night on the sofa,” Sherlock said, with a soft smile. “Please . . .”
Sherlock was surprised for a moment, but an urge took over -- an urge to be closer to John, an urge to explore this difference. He dropped his hand to John's waistband, sliding his fingers inside. John moaned a bit louder, pressing flush against Sherlock.
“That’s why you shouldn’t make assumptions, John,” Sherlock said. “They’re not going to see a person at all. They’re going to see a tiger that Sherlock met one day while he was out by himself in the woods. The tiger gave them some fresh meat and they went back to the cave and John cooked it over a fire and ate almost all of it except for a small bit that he let Sherlock have. I told you there was going to be a tiger in this story.”
Sherlock made his tea. He wasn't sure what to do -- could he just stand there frozen until John came out? He didn't turn around but did ask, "Want tea?"
John turned to look at him. "You left me," he said again. "Why did you even bring me if you weren’t going to let me help?" he asked.
John took Sherlock into his mouth, bobbing slowly up and down around his cock. His hand kept playing at the base as he moaned softly.
“Fuck off,” Sherlock said and turned to head back to his room. He could hear the two of them laughing as he walked away.
"Okay," John said. He followed Sherlock and sat with him on the sofa. "Were there cells in this cup?" he asked.
Sherlock swallowed a sip of tea. "You're wrong about him -- he'll know, you'll show him somehow, he'll see. But you're right -- he does always believe the best in people." He looked over. "Don't let him down."
“Not yet,” Sherlock said. “Soon but not yet.” It was torture for both of them, but he knew that it was the good kind of torture. He pulsed his finger inside John and then slid in another one. “Does this feel good?”
“No, I cannot,” Mycroft said. “However, I know that you appreciate cleverness -- I know you see the value in logic. Until yours recovers, I know you’ll follow my guidance.”
Sherlock leaned into John, pressing their bodies together. “Are you keeping your clothes on as well?” he asked before nuzzling against John’s neck.
They were eating lunch -- well, John was eating lunch while Sherlock was fiddling with his empty mug -- when John's phone vibrated. Sherlock saw John's face change the minute he read the text. "What's wrong?" he asked. "Is it a case?"
It wasn't too long after John noticed the handsome man that things started wrapping up. The announcement was made, and Molly grinned out at the crowd. John couldn't help smiling as well. She looked truly happy. He watched them leave, and then the guests started to file out. John waited until he saw that man passing, squeezing out to walk behind him. He was very tall. John hoped he would be going to the reception. Maybe he could find a reason to talk to him there.
Sherlock climbed into the bed and lay awkwardly flat on his back. "Is this all right -- do you mind that I'm here?"
John carded his fingers into Sherlock's curls, his own head falling back a bit. "Sherlock . . . fuck," he moaned.
"Fuck," John moaned, his knees more giving out than controlling his movement to the ground. He looked up at Sherlock. "You look really good."
He didn’t pick up his phone until he was already under the covers with the lights out. He was relieved to see John’s apology, but the feeling of unease didn’t quite leave him. He wished he was still at home and everything was as it had been. Or maybe he wished John was here, even though that didn’t really make sense to him just yet.
John browsed on his computer while Sherlock worked at the desk. His mind wandered to Harry and what she was out doing. Hopefully it all went well and they didn't fight. Everything had been so messy before. He was worried, but was trying to be hopeful.
John gave a heated look at Sherlock, the annoyance from earlier building. "You don't have the skills necessary," he said.
John's mouth snapped closed, fell open, and then he closed it again. "Oh." He shifted to sit up a bit. "Well, I like the film, don't get me wrong . . ." He paused it again. "But I wouldn't complain about an interruption."
“No,” Sherlock said. “I’m feeling better today.” He leaned over and turned off the lamp. “This all feels quite nice, actually,” he said.
John's breath shuddered a bit as he tried to compose himself -- feeling Sherlock's hand exploring his body like that was driving him crazy already.
“How was the interview?” Sherlock called, but John was out the door. He climbed the rest of the stairs and went into the flat.
"Oh," John breathed, wrapping his fingers around Sherlock's cock. He stroked slowly, tipping his head a bit to look down at it.
When Sherlock came back in, he went upstairs to his room. He checked his phone and saw a message from John.
Sherlock came in and sat on the sofa. “What’s the weather like? Perhaps we could take a walk later. I feel like I have more energy than I’ve had in a while.”
John flushed lightly. "Not really,” he said. “But I do love food, which probably shows," he added, patting his belly.
For John, the whole thing had been a whirlwind. He’d watched Sherlock bent over the body, barely touching it, and then he watched Sherlock list an amazing amount of details about her before shouting and running off.
“Come on then,” Sherlock said. He kept his coat and opened the door, waving his arm to encourage John to hurry.
"Oh, your neighbour called, saying something was wrong with his water, but looks like it was a false alarm. All is well."
“You’ve always been interesting to me,” Sherlock said. He leaned back and closed his eyes. “Can’t you do something to make me forget what’s going on? I don’t like this, John, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to think about anything else,” he said softly, like a confession.
“The handyman you just met a few hours ago,” she said. “Pay attention, please, he’s the one we’ve been talking about.”
For a second, Sherlock questioned himself, but then he hit Send. There was no turning back now. A few minutes passed before she responded.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He stayed on the bench, wishing he could call John and tell him about what happened. They hadn’t talked in so long, but Sherlock knew John would know the right thing to say.
"Do you have a job?" Sherlock asked. He glanced at John. "She said she wanted to talk about something else," he said as an explanation.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I’ll be fine.” He grabbed a few things from his desk and then moved to the door. “Well, goodbye, then,” he said, glancing around. “Don’t destroy anything while I’m away.”
His mother smiled softly and glanced at John. “You won’t be -- you’ll make friends there and you’ll see John on break.”
"The grocery stores are considered essential and will not be closing. We can go out shopping only when it’s necessary," he said.
They lay quietly for a few minutes, and then Sherlock heard his phone ring. He reached down and grabbed it from his trouser pocket. “It’s Lestrade,” he said. “What should I do?”
"I've already seen Mum and I'm here now," Harry told John. "There aren't many people I care about but you know, I'm trying."
“You’re not here as my doctor,” Sherlock said. “Besides I’m the boss here since you’re the boss at the flat.”
Sherlock stood up and moved into the kitchen. After a few loud noises, one spill and multiple curses, he was ready. Or at least as ready as he was going to be. He moved over to his desk and opened his laptop, knowing he needed something to distract him for these last few minutes or his head would probably explode.
John nodded. "I thought it was because of the case, the way you were acting . . . but I see now," he said.
Sherlock peered around her and then took a step inside. He wanted to see this so-called man to make sure it was all on the up and up. “So, it’s sorted?” he asked as he walked into the kitchen.
John dragged his fingers over Sherlock's nipples, grinning at the sigh and soft moan. "You also stood close enough to press your arm against me while you explained your train of thought."
"I know we're best friends, but sex isn’t a part of friendship. Do you want dating to be part of our friendship?" John asked.
"I've never been before, but I would love it." John looked over at him and smiled. "When everything opens up again, we'll plan it."
"You can, the woman that owns it . . . well, you'll see. I'll text you the address later." They went back to their lunches and more honeymoon talk.
Sherlock looked at John properly. “You’ve been trying to have sex with everyone you know,” he said. “Now you’re going to stop?”
“Let’s get you home,” he said, reaching for her arm. “I think you’re overly tired.” He gave her a smile, and they headed out, finding a taxi to take them home to Baker Street.
Sherlock handed John a mug. “Fine, sorry,” he mumbled. “But we’re supposed to be working on this case together, you know, so I do need to know what you’ve found out.”
John looked over at him. “It was a very good dinner party, Sherlock,” he said. “Small but intimate.”
“John,” Sherlock said. “I think our stories are more interesting than these people’s actual lives.” They turned their attention back to the screen, focusing more on finding the missing man.
"Why?" he asked, genuinely curious. "Why have you become John Watson's biggest fan all of a sudden?"
Sherlock checked his watch and then put the kettle on. He hadn’t heard anything from anyone so assumed things were going to plan.
John looked over at him. "Look, you're not a constant ray of sunshine either, so we'll see how this all goes."
Sherlock moved quickly back to the computer, opening the webpage for the club. He couldn’t find the man on the staff page for the bar. He found the calendar and located a link to the webpage of the band that was playing that night. No clues there. If he wasn’t working for the band or the bar, what could that guy have been doing there?
John gasped softly and then groaned Sherlock's name as he came, bucking into his hand. His free hand gripped Sherlock's hair and kissed him hard.
John took a drink and shrugged. "I'm just trying to make it interesting. Let's play something else if you want."
John was sitting at his desk, looking through his essay and marking where he'd be editing and making changes when his phone finally buzzed. It was his friend with a new job. John was eager for a break. He accepted and quickly got ready.
Harry shrugged. "All I'm saying is you're the only one dragging your feet. Acceptance is the first step, after all."
“And you look lovely -- very handsome out in the sun. You should spend less time inside, the sun suits you.”
Mrs Hudson pretended to think for a minute. “Let’s go get something nice for dinner,” she said. “With a bottle of wine.”
John hummed softly as they kissed again. He moved Sherlock's hands to the zip of his jeans while his own started unbuttoning Sherlock's shirt.
Sherlock nuzzled John's lobe and then stepped back. "I'll get us another drink," he said and headed to the bar. When he returned, he handed a glass to John. "The band's not good . . . if you want my opinion for your friend," he said with a smile.
"It doesn't," John said again, his voice harder. "It's just . . . it's not true. If someone said untrue things about you wouldn't you correct them? If it was true, it wouldn't matter."
Sherlock pulled away a little and tried to get comfortable. “Are you going to go to sleep now?” he asked.
It wasn't Sherlock. It wasn't even coded or disguised. John even recognised the name. His first urge was to just delete the message. How could he reopen the business without Sherlock? Without Sherlock, there was no business. There was nothing. Maybe he should tell Williams that; in fact, how dare he assume John could just pick it up? He clicked the reply button, his fingers hovering over the keys. But he couldn’t do it.
John sent Sherlock the message and leaned back in the seat of the taxi. He was a bit tired but eager to get home again. Hopefully, they would have a case when he got home. It had been a little while, and he knew Sherlock was at his best with a clear focus.
Sherlock's initial thought was relief that John's issue had nothing to do with him before realising it had everything to do with him. "I don't think that's a good idea, John," he said, glancing up at the window. He was a bit curious but not enough to open the flat to someone else.
“I bet you were good at it,” Sherlock said. “I never did public speaking -- even when we went to science competitions, I didn’t do the talking.”
John sent the letter and tried to enjoy his time while waiting for a reply. He was worried -- if Sherlock took a long time to respond, how were they going to make a plan for the visit? Did Sherlock want to see him? Would he want to explain his experiments to John who could barely follow along now that he probably had real scientist friends who could actually contribute? He didn't like thinking about that. He understood now how Sherlock must have felt when John’s letters included stuff about his new friends.
“God,” Sherlock called loudly, his upper body lifting slightly off the bed. “Fuck . . . that’s good.” He glanced down but then closed his eyes, letting the pleasure take him.
"I didn't know what he wanted -- he wouldn't tell me. But I don't see what the big deal is, it’s Christmas, you know, family time," he said.
"Good," Sherlock said. "I'm done with mine." He set his plate on the table. "I'll top up our wine while you finish." He went into the kitchen. He realised there was no space in the sink to leave the new plates, so he quickly did the washing up. Then he returned with the bottle.
“I wasn’t even invited!” Sherlock pouted. “Fine,” he said. “You enjoy yourselves on luck money. I prefer income I worked for.” He got up and headed to his desk before realising that was useless. “I need tea,” he stated and went to the kitchen.
Sherlock smiled to himself and then reached over and petted John’s head. “There, there,” he said. “Don’t feel bad – maybe they’ll have a question on ugly jumpers. I bet you’ll get that one straight away.”
"Well, what have we been doing?? I don't know -- read or work or . . . fuck, John, what have we been doing all this time? I honestly can’t remember."
"If they get sore, I could do this for you," Sherlock said. "I don't mind." He rubbed from John's shoulders to his lower back. "I kind of like it actually. I like helping you, John."
"Okay, but I don't think it'll be gross. I'm going to get ready while you do that," he said. He went into the house with the dishes and put them in the sink before changing into his swimming trunks.
Sherlock looked down at him lovingly. “You could’ve just asked me, you know,” he said softly and then his voice turned a little sharper. “You’ve got a job to do, soldier,” he said as he undid his trousers and opened them.
“Whatever,” Sherlock said. “I have nothing to hide from you, and I’ll take my chances in the dark.” He pulled his cigarettes out of his bag. “I’m going to go outside and have one of these.”
“Nothing,” John said. “She knows nothing about me. She has a boyfriend . . . if she’s interested, it’s not going to be for my interesting backstory.”
Sherlock looked over. “No, you have never lied to me,” he stated. John had never lied -- not once. Sherlock had never doubted him. However, he knew John didn’t know things would be okay, no one could know that. John’s statement was more about belief. John believed things that Sherlock couldn’t, and sometimes Sherlock was jealous of that. He dropped John’s hand and said, “Sorry -- let’s stop talking about it. Don’t bring it up in front of her, okay?”
"Hmm, the first. But like I said at the bar, I haven't found that person yet. Could be anywhere," he smiled.
“There’s got to be something,” Sherlock said, dramatically throwing down his arms. “Oh my god, John,” he said, suddenly leaning forward in his chair. “Are we . . . boring?”
John opened a cupboard and looked inside, then closed it and got on the floor to look under the bed. "Hmm." He got up and was about to leave the room when he noticed the door being wide open. He pulled it and grinned. "Found you!"
Sherlock closed his eyes when the music began. “Fine choice,” he said, opening his eyes again. “So does this music hold any memories for you? Tell me about your life when you first heard this song.”
“It was fun,” Sherlock said. “Remember the other day when we were trying to prove we were interesting? We should have done that instead of the prank phone calls.”
John walked into the flat and didn't know what to look at first. The place was kind of a mess -- books, newspapers, beakers and solutions, just general clutter everywhere.
“I suppose so,” Sherlock said. He set his mug down. “Let’s go.” As they walked down, he asked, “Will you have a lot to move?”
Yet he hated leaving puzzles unsolved, and he was certain this was a puzzle. He sat down on his chair and stared out into the flat which suddenly seemed entirely too quiet. He used to love that quiet, but now it seemed wrong somehow. And that, of course, was because of John.
"Not right this second," he said. "I finally snuck out -- I guess that’s something that has changed.”
“It’s very interesting,” Sherlock said, giving John a serious but sly look. “Perhaps I could tell you about it the next time our pipes break.”
“I appreciate your coming to the wedding,” she said softly. “I hope it wasn’t too horrible for you -- I know you don’t like that kind of thing.”
"The gun's gone," Sherlock said. "Chemicals are in those beakers, but none of them is alcohol," he added. He stood up but wasn't sure why. He decided he needed more tea. "Maybe you should go up to John's room," he said as he moved to the kitchen.
John picked up his phone and furrowed his brows at the message. He walked normally to the door but through the window he saw the deer and froze, taking careful steps and being very quiet as he moved next to Sherlock. He watched the deer.
Sherlock pushed a pillow toward John. "Don't, though," he added. He took a sip of tea and lifted his legs onto the table, sliding down a bit. "Do you like her?" he asked. "I mean, if she wasn't your sister, would you be friends with her?"
John took the clipboard and smiled. "Thanks--oh, is that the time?” he asked, noticing the clock. “I have to go, I'm sorry. I have a full afternoon."
John raised his brows slightly, but he didn't say anything. "Well, I will leave you my own card as well so if anything actually . . . I mean, if something happens again, you can call me directly."
“Why don’t you move in and send this grump to your house?” she said. “Sherlock, did you tell John all about your school?”
John headed out early, wanting to stop into speak to Lestrade a bit about his progress. Sherlock’s reactions to all this had been awkward and John wasn’t sure why.
John brought some toast from the kitchen and sat back down on the sofa, turning on the news. The sound changed the room, and he glanced over at Sherlock who had obviously gone away into his mind. John turned off the telly. "Fine, we are there in that world."
“Could we talk for a few more minutes?” Sherlock said, stepping in and standing at the door awkwardly.
Sherlock opened the door wider and stepped forward a little. “Is this something kind of insult about my own health? I can assure you I’m well,” he said.
When they got back to school, she dropped his hand as they got off the bus. “Let’s take a walk,” she said.
“It’s just -- that’s not what I want. I just want you to be here. That’s all I’m trying to say. But now you’ll be at work and out doing other things,” Sherlock said. He didn’t feel like he was making himself clear, but he couldn’t think how else to say it. “It doesn’t matter, I suppose. I think I’ll do a little more work now,” he said as he made a move to get up from the bed.
John actually had been looking and had found an article about a robbery at an art gallery. He read it out to Sherlock and asked, "What do you think?"
“Then we’ll be fine,” Sherlock said. He finished his food and set his plate on the table. “Though . . . I’m worried that if you get ill, I won’t know what to do.”
There was nothing more infuriating than his brother being right, but Sherlock knew he was. “What . . . can I do?” he asked.
"I don’t want to," he said. “There’s a risk, but the benefits are worth it.” He slouched a bit lower and sighed softly.
“Well, you’re being rude to me right now,” Sherlock said. “I thought you care about the cases. I thought you like working together.”
Sherlock glanced over at his bookshelves. “My books don’t make very good stories,” he said. “Can you make one up?”
Sherlock stood up and walked over to the window. The street was empty. It was too unusual so he pulled the curtains shut and tipped the rest of the tea into his mouth. He glanced at the kitchen where John was busying himself, so Sherlock flopped on the sofa and flipped through the channels.
"You should get an early night tonight or maybe a nap," Sherlock said. "I mean, you've probably not slept very well on the sofa and all."
John kissed back, unable to answer back, unwilling to stop the kiss long enough to answer back. He shifted towards Sherlock, moaning softly.
“Yes, the overly eager employee who contacted the police before contacting Mr Altamont will eventually be relieved of her position, but yes, that’s it. You’ve solved the case. I’ll be in touch when you are required.”
“You’re not trapped here,” Mycroft said. “You’re an adult, you can make your own choices. I’m sure that -- as an adult -- you realise that a short rest away from work is exactly what you need and thus will choose to stay.”
“I don’t want to stop,” Sherlock said. “I just wanted to say it was unusual. But unusual is good, right?” He twisted himself around to face John. He lifted his hands to the sides of John’s head and gave him a soft kiss.
“Not really. Are you? Hold on, wait,” Sherlock said, moving over to the bag he’d put in the kitchen. “I brought something for you,” he said, handing John a bag. “It’s popcorn -- like we used to have when we watched movies sometimes.”
"If we're going to start making up stories to pass the time, I'd like a little warning to get mine together," John said, not looking up from the computer.
Mrs Hudson returned to the table. “What happened to John?” she asked. “Did you do something to him?”
"Okay. Well, he's mostly bruised up. His body needs to rest and heal. Also his blood pressure is elevated, most likely because of the pain he's in. We'll keep him overnight with the stronger medication, but then he should be able to go home with oral pain medicine. He needs to rest, though."
John rubbed his neck awkwardly. "I know. I wanted to but got busy. And I wasn’t sure you wanted to see me again. You left so quickly.”
“Right,” Sherlock said. “I fill one role, but now you’re looking for someone else who is clever and funny and shares similar interests and is easy to talk to. All things that don’t describe me, it appears. Right, I get it.”
John finished up his last few patients, heading out to hail a cab. He could do his paperwork the next time he came in.
“Is it our guy?” Sherlock said, excitedly before looking closely. “No . . . oh well, good on the kid for making a little extra money,” he added with a laugh. “Wait – didn’t we just see that woman kissing a dark-haired man and now she’s holding hands with that elderly guy. Think she’s running some kind of scam?”
"Intriguing," Sherlock said with a sly grin. He took another sip of tea. "Maybe we could try…see what it's like. Do what we both want to do . . . don't do what we don't want to do. That is one way to find out if it's what we both actually want."
John winced a bit as the light came in. He nodded, rubbing the five o'clock shadow on his face self consciously. "Okay."
John shrugged. "It’ll give me good experience -- I’m going to be a surgeon. And it’ll be pretty exciting," he said.
Sherlock sat down. "You can deal," he said. "But be sure to shuffle in front of me -- I don't want any tricks."
“Yes,” Sherlock said quickly then realised that lying was not good or necessary. “I am now -- I got checked when I got back. I’m all right, just . . . sore.”
John looked over his schedule plan for Monday. "I might be able to stop by Monday afternoon," he said.
News about the virus was all over every page he clicked. How had he missed this? He grabbed his phone and sent a text to his brother.
“I loved you too,’ Sherlock said. He moved over toward the sofa and paused before he sat down. “I didn’t know it . . . I wasn’t expecting it. . . but being away from you made me understand.” He looked over but couldn’t quite meet John’s eyes. “Like I said in the messages . . . you made me happier than I’ve ever been."
Sherlock pulled it out and brushed it off. He looked over at John who was now bent down as well. He looked closely at his face, and he thought he could see his friend there. “Do you remember the combination?” he asked, pushing the box toward John.
“What happened?” Solomon asked uneasily. Winifred had met him on the ground floor, where they went into the library together.
Both our client and his maid had seemed genuinely surprised for not having realised that the latch was not operating properly, so it was unlikely to have been in that condition for long.
We were once neighbours. You and your wife visited us several times for supper and some light musical entertainment. I recall her distinctly noting that you enjoyed those sorts of evenings, but little else in the way of normal pursuits.
“We don’t want to give him anything to calm him or treat his pain until we know how extensive the head injury is; his overall condition,” the neurologist explained. “It would probably help if you talked to him.”
He had timed his “walk about” carefully. He knew that Malcolm was going out to see a film that evening. His brother was God-knows-where, his driver with him. When Mrs Parker had brought the tray up to his room, she seemed weary. He was genuinely a bit concerned and gently reached out and touched one work-worn hand.
I am not, in retrospect, surprised that he knew that I was accompanied by someone other than his brother. My use of his surname, and his response using mine, indicated that with his usual lightning-quick reasoning, he had deduced the situation.
“Come over here,” Winifred invited, placing her bag on the table in a different bedroom than he had been inhabiting. She had found her patient there, sitting on the floor and impatiently flipping through the pages of a book. Etta had filled her in on their patient’s somewhat rough start to the day—a tetchy stomach, outburst in the kitchen. Thankfully, things had smoothed out after that. He had seemed to genuinely enjoy his brother reading to him, and after that, he had gone wandering through the immense house, eventually involving himself in a creative (and harmless) activity.
“God, Sherlock, I am so sorry. I just meant… I meant to cleanse you… to bathe you. I know that you feel horrid from your exertions and the heat of this wretched day.”
His own reaction has been disturbing. He now seems completely unaware of his injury even as it obviously impedes his movements. He was impatient with my examination, of course, and then began to act as if the incident had never occurred.
He huffed impatiently as I tested the water and adjusted the taps, then continued stripping, carelessly dropping his shirt onto the pile on the floor. I looked pointedly at his combinations.
Whilst we were discussing this, Sherlock had entertained himself by apparently selecting a few books for his journey (he had muttered something about how dull the shipboard journey was unless there was a disappearance or murder or even a good theft to entertain him). However, his method of selecting the tomes was to remove each book from our crowded shelves, glance at it, then discard it as he had been discarding everything else. The pile around him was growing and he was clearly ignorant of any pain he had caused to his own (bare) feet whilst engaged in this activity. The regular thuds of the books as they fell and his still-constant speech was beginning to give me a headache.
The woman—who reminded him of someone, but he couldn’t put his finger on who just then—returned with a glass of water in one hand and a neatly-folded flannel in the other. “Come sit back down,” she said firmly.
“I am relieved that she will be staying. She is nearly as good a cook as you are, Mrs Hudson,” I told her honestly.
The second tin—a smaller one shaped like a stack of chocolate digestives—held an encouraging amount of cash. He took it all and replaced that tin.
He was Catholic and the eighth of nine children. Not that he had told them that, of course, but Mycroft couldn’t help noting the facts. He wondered if Sherlock still automatically observed and catalogued facts like that about people. Not knowing what was going on in his brother’s head was becoming increasingly frustrating.
There had been a woman—dark hair and beautiful clothing and a wit as sharp as a tack. He had liked her, and she seemed to like him, but no—she didn’t seem the type to interfere with things like that.
He had absolutely no qualms about drugging the nurse. As soon as she was out (it was fairly obvious because she snored), he set his plan into action. There was no time to lose. Malcolm would be back from the cinema soon, and when he opened the gate to drive in, he would have his opportunity.
“Will you leave?” he suddenly burst out, spinning on his cushions to look into my eyes. “Will you move away?”
Quite unexpectedly, the thin man thrust it at his brother, then glared at him. Clearly, he expected him to do something with it. The government man glanced at the topmost sheet. Ah. It was a list of the foods that Sherlock preferred and those he avoided, in Mycroft’s own writing.
this? How can you conclude that it is a man from so little information?” I was spluttering, the questions crowding upon one another.
“What do we have here?” she asked Christopher, who was making some final notes regarding his shift on the clipboard.
He was absolutely correct. I removed and hung up my coat and turned. Sure enough, there was my dressing gown—a gift from him on my last birthday—draped neatly over the back of my chair. I slipped into it and discovered a note in one of the pockets.
Sherlock was true to his word and behaved himself fairly well. I had lifted my ban, and he was now allowed to resume his experiments—within reason, and he was to warn us if something was likely to create any alarming noises or odours. He was being quite good about keeping to regular hours and decently garbing himself. I pointed out that, because Belinda left after the supper washing up, he would not be able to ring for food or even tea on a whim, so he had better eat when meals were offered. Surprisingly, he complied with this rule as well.
Long before their trip to Harrods, John had agonized about what he could possibly get for him. He had immediately dismissed any sort of clothing—he wouldn’t be able to select a single pair of socks that were acceptable, let alone a shirt or something. He had considered a selection of different honeys, tins of biscuits, and even a selection of gourmet-flavoured popcorn—but seeing Mycroft’s overflowing basket, he was grateful for not having pursued this option, as anything he could have procured would have seemed piddling in comparison. Finally, it had dawned on him. Here he was, considering the most mundane sorts of gifts possible, when the man for whom he was buying was anything but. Sherlock Holmes was a unique man. Only a unique gift—one that truly reflected his personality—would do.
“I see,” I mused. “I will make it clear that I am just popping out to retrieve some things that we need in the short term. I do not wish for him to believe anything except that these circumstances are temporary—that we only wish for him to get well—and then we can return to our lives.” And then that thought had caused me a flood of apprehension. “We
“No,” Mycroft decided firmly but quietly. He sounded exhausted. “We can’t risk that—too difficult to maintain security. He’s safer here.” He and Anthea had already made it crystal-clear that every person in that room was to not just keep quiet about but if challenged to actively deny who they had been treating. “Besides,” he added even more quietly, “you’ve seen how he’s reacting now, in a familiar setting; what would it do to him to be in a hospital?”
I did have a vague notion of your activities, as my own dear husband occasionally indulges in reading some rather fantastic stories—although I do attempt to dissuade him, and to entice him with much more wholesome fare—and he sometimes shares with me some details from your pieces in The Strand. Since my return, I have taken it upon myself to seek out and read some of these lurid tales myself.
There was someone else… damn. She cleaned and she made biscuits and she complained about his experiments. No. She liked it when he was “dashing about” and there was something about…
To see him curled up with the doctor on their sofa, gazing at a children’s programme or listening to him read aloud; to watch as he became completely engaged and calm whilst building with blocks or colouring…
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. He pulled the straight-backed chair up and sat in front of him, still clasping the book. His brother’s eyes wandered in his direction slowly; he didn’t seem to be focusing on anything in particular. “I have thousands of books. How did you manage to find this one?” He looked down at it, running his fingers across the title. “Why did I even keep it?” he mused.
“Not do?” I pictured our dear landlady bustling about, going up and down the stairs. Ah. “We do not cook.”
He looked at us blankly and I interjected: “He means, Sherlock, did you intend to just walk away from your half of the responsibility for the rent? For our other household expenses? Did you think that I could afford to manage on my own—or to take another lodger in your place?”
He looked at his own hands for a while, observing the yellow nicotine stains, the healing wounds on the knuckles, the scars. The callouses caught his eye. Recognisable callouses, even if they were a bit softened now; at some point, he had played the violin.
The room was terribly cold. He was dressed, if not neatly, at least as completely as he was able (he had no boots or collar, but otherwise was garbed against the chill, including stockings). As he had no coat, he had wrapped himself in a blanket from the bed.
His brother was completely bare, water dripping off his fingers. He shook his head in mild distain (and just a touch of amusement) over the familiar image.
“You did half the work,” the doctor reminded him, smiling at the empty plate in front of him. “And now, if you do half the washing up, I will consider it a Christmas miracle.”
“But otherwise, I have no desire to dress or to act any differently than as I do. I have not wished to present myself as a woman just to do the thing. I have never wished to be a woman. I have never once wished to be… a wife to you.”
“What about them?” So, he did have family. He had thought so. The clothing; the public school accent. Had probably been to university.
“Yeah. Come on. Up.” He was so slight Greg could probably have picked him up, but instead he carefully got him sitting up and slowly moved him back into the passenger seat of his car.
The government man had rather numbly indicated the samples that he had collected so they could add them to everything that would be tested. “Breathe, Sherlock,” he had murmured to him. “It will all be over soon. You’re safe now.”
“I’ll be waking him periodically to check on him and give him more medication,” Winifred explained as she nodded her thanks; Mycroft had just handed her a bin that she placed quietly on the floor near Sherlock’s head—she had been warned about his notoriously weak stomach. “You should probably sleep in the other room.”
Solomon was delighted. His patient had, after being dried off and redressed, allowed himself to be manoeuvred down into the kitchen (he seemed more relaxed when in that room than anywhere else in the house) and he had eaten several slices of apple (peeled and doused with lemon and cinnamon sugar, as Mr Holmes had instructed) and two chocolate biscuits.
“I should have been more diligent in my questioning,” she admitted, “but it is growing more and more uncommon—or so I thought. It simply did not occur to me. I feel quite horrid about the way I found out—me thrusting that wretched book under her nose. I do wish she had told me.”
He, of course, had warned me at our very first meeting of these periods of melancholia, but as he did not experience such a low time immediately, I somewhat put his words about sometimes getting “in the dumps” behind myself. Besides, I wondered, what would a few days of sulking mean to me, anyway? I certainly found myself in a foul mood for a few days at a time more than once—is that all he meant? If so, I would simply do as he requested and leave him alone until it passed.
Someone had done that for him, too—a long time ago. Who had that been? He drifted off trying to remember.
There were times when observing him performing such an action was the most enticing, beautiful, stimulating thing ever—both for me and for him. But not now. His head was down; his face the very picture of thoughtful despair. He sighed as he passed the sponge across his flaccid organ.
The DI wandered into the kitchen with the crumbled wrapping paper in his hands. He tossed it in the bin and then leaned against the counter, watching the doctor as he retrieved mugs.
“I should have thought to remove them first,” he admitted, accepting the bar of Pears’ soap that I offered.
Sherlock glanced at it—he had been poking his finger into his hot, milky tea, pulling it out, and watching the droplets fall back into the cup. The nurse smiled at him. “Drink your tea while it’s hot,” she encouraged. “I’m Winifred, by the way.” Instead of responding, he reached a shaking hand out for the dish of orange segments.
Unusual? More unusual than what? Than finding himself in a jaw-droppingly posh house as a private nurse to a patient apparently so important he had had to sign a confidentiality agreement?
“I t’ink a lovely hot bath would be a good idea,” she commented. He looked down at himself and nodded sombrely, thoughtfully licking a few fingers. “Come on, then. Mr Holmes, you all right?” The government man had been completely silent since the younger man had (not terribly gently) pushed his plate back in front of him. He had eaten, mechanically, somehow clearing the plate without taking his eyes off his brother for even a second.
It had been a Godsend when, spurred by his interest in solving mysteries, he had somehow gotten the attention of Lestrade, and there had been a few years of a somewhat uneasy peace. With the carrot of cases dangling in front of him, he, for the first time, actively attempted to get clean. He took a ratty little flat on Montague Street. He was stumbling along, spending what little money he made from cases on books, scientific equipment, and clothing… mostly.
Sherlock nodded. He began to meticulously return each crayon to the box. While he focused on this, Mycroft gathered up the remainder of the papers from the floor, and Solomon handed him the drawings from the other room. He tapped them into a tidy stack. “These are very interesting, Sherlock,” he told him, sincerely. “Shall I keep them safe for you?”
“John, thank God you have returned! Your professional services are required immediately.” Sherlock’s voice rolled up the stairs and into the hall, where I had just dropped my walking stick into the stand.
Still, he was intelligent and thoughtful and was studying to become a doctor. He had a special interest in diseases of the eyes and in surgery, having grown up with a grandmother blinded by cataracts and so terrified of the idea of an operation that they never could convince her to have it done. He had felt so helpless back then. But now, when his studies were complete, he could help others in her situation. That was his plan.
She couldn’t figure out what he wanted, and he began to get frustrated. “B…” was all he could manage.
The nurse who had just been dismissed went into the staff room and emerged moments later with her coat. Not even pausing to put it on, she put her head down and dashed out the door, nearly hitting someone coming in.
“Thankfully, nothing too bad—the patient realised it was the wrong tablets before he took any—but obviously it could have been much worse.”
What had occurred to me as I struck out from the hotel into the bright, fresh day was this: everyone who saw me, decently attired and walking with calm purpose, would have assumed that I was off to attend to some mundane matter—stopping at my tailor’s, or at the bank. If I had my medical bag with me, everyone would assume that I was on my way to attend to a patient.
We sat for a long time after that; my legs cramped a bit and I finally shifted from my position crouched in front of him. I rose stiffly and sat next to him on the bed. All three of us remained in silence for a few moments.
“Several times, yes. This is the fourth that I know of definitively and I suspect there were a few incidents at a time when I was abroad.”
“I have discovered something about her that took me somewhat by surprise, and I am afraid that my reaction was… well, I could have responded a bit more calmly.”
“Can you come sit down?” his brother suggested in a somewhat kinder tone. “Can you sit and talk to us for a while?”
“I am certain he does not mean any of it,” she pointed out. “He has nothing but respect and affection for you. He is out of his head, as you have said. He would never say anything so hurtful otherwise.”
Equally, I should have had the wits to explain that snakes are, for the most part, not trainable. Likewise, they would be highly unlikely to crawl through a metal ventilator and down a bell-rope—unlike a bedpost, the fabric would not support their method of movement. As for hoping that an untrainable reptile would do so, bite the occupant of the bed, then return when whistled for is simply untenable.
Sherlock did not slow in his pacing as he spat vitriol at his brother; at me. He accused us of terrible things—we had kept him confined against his will. We had deprived him of contact with others; with knowledge of current events. We had finally stripped him of even the most basic of human comforts—fire for warmth; fire for light.
What he revealed horrified me so much that I—I admit this in retrospect and I am truly disgusted at my own behaviour—I walked out on him. I simply put on my coat and hat and walked down the stairs and out the street door and I did not return for hours. What I did—how I responded—I am ashamed.
I took a good, deep drink of the cool drink I held. “No, it is fine,” I finally managed, “but I believe that I was under a misapprehension regarding the passing of your husband and child.”
His uncertainty irritated him, as had Mycroft’s request that he tell them what had happened to him. He couldn’t. He simply couldn’t.
“… three or four times before having them killed; doesn’t do it himself. Keeps his hands clean. Probably has
The tall, pale man had concentrated quite hard on the shorter man’s words, frowning and sometimes shaking his head doubtfully, but the calm, steady voice did its job and he was able to accomplish his task, working carefully around the horrific head wound and the bruises on the almost emaciated face.
She was not amused, however, and frowned at me. “Well, over time, I have marked several recipes that I wished to try, and it occurred to me that this would be an opportune time. Belinda is quite handy in the kitchen, as you have noticed, and I did not think that any of them were beyond her capabilities.”
Oh, he could be amusing! Because, of course, he was exactly right. Puffing to keep my pipe going, I retrieved my book and made myself comfortable in my chair—the cushion crinkled.
“I also believe that you will be perfectly capable of bringing up the coal and laying the fires—for us
It was, in fact, that very duty which led me to my realisation. I had reached out to the director of the London Zoo for advice and to possibly arrange for the transportation of the animals to that establishment, and in doing so, I had to, of course, make a list of the wildlife.
She shook her head vigorously. “It is no use, Doctor Watson. I know what I saw with my own eyes, and that vile sight will undoubtedly haunt my dreams for ages. I will take my leave of you now.” And she swept past me and hurried around the corner that I had just come from. I sighed and took the few steps I needed to reach our door.
Sherlock was not supposed to stop all communication. He was not supposed to fall off the radar. He was not supposed to be damaged to the point of insanity and tortured to the point of death. He was not supposed to finally resurface on a dark street, filthy and strung out and injured, and eventually end up in his big brother’s house, so broken that he was unable to speak.
“Very well. I met Mr. Bramsen at a secluded bench in Hyde Park, as he had instructed, and he shared his problem with me.”
Sherlock smiled a bit wickedly as he leaned against the wall and counted the cash from the wallet that he had just liberated from its owner. More than enough—more than enough to take care of the swirling horribly jumbled unfocused confusing overwhelming thoughts. He needed to focus, and he knew exactly how he was going to do that.
“Don’t be absurd, John. It’s merely a matter of selecting high-quality paper and attending to the folds.” He looked disdainfully at the colourful bags in which many of their gifts had arrived (and which John had insisted they save for re-use).
If all the homes that had been burgled had already been listed for sale, it would probably have been far too obvious. But a valuation? Some of the homeowners, flustered and distraught by the break-ins, probably had not even thought to mention that they had recently had one done when asked about any strangers in their homes.
She continued relating our maid’s history as I re-wrapped her foot. “First she was in the scullery of a country house…”
I embraced him more tightly. “I always read your letters; you know that,” I chided. “That is not the reason you did not send it. Will you come sit with me and tell me what happened to change your mind about it?”
I am, every moment, grateful to our host. When we arrived, the rooms had been, as promised, stripped to the bare minimum—all breakables removed. However, there are books (those are deemed harmless for the most part unless he throws them) and pencils and writing paper (Mycroft explained that they have learned not to provide him with pens or ink). Everything is kept fresh and airy—the bedding is rather exquisite. Meals arrive punctually, delivered by one of the very serious young footmen; letters likewise (all from Mrs Hudson—one each day, in which she faithfully records any visitors and more mundane issues regarding the drains and whatnot—all of which Sherlock takes very seriously, sometimes re-reading a letter several times and then writing a very earnest if rambling response). There are always clean towels and shirts and stockings.
“Correct. In the flood of information my questions drew from the neighbours, there was not a single reference to a child, or children, so I finally inquired directly, and my observation was confirmed.”
Mycroft gingerly placed the filthy garments in a bag so they could be examined. After his initial shocked outburst, he found himself swallowing hard, his mouth clamped shut, as he fully revealed his brother’s emaciated, mutilated body. The worst—God. Oh God. Really? Worse than he could
“Let me examine you,” I responded instantly. She nodded, and I gingerly pressed on her foot, over the bandages. “The swelling has increased,” I reported grimly. “Has the pain, as well?”
So now as he entered, I could instantly observe that he was, if not suffering terribly from it, at least uncomfortable from the heat. He removed his coat and hat, then looked down on himself in some surprise. I rose and went to assist him.
Mycroft was impressed as his brother, pushing the helpful hand aside, shakily managed to get himself to the table.
Sherlock tried to make eye contact with him, but he had already turned away and was opening the door to his tiny student hall room. Two other students walked in. One—his name was Paul, Sherlock vaguely recalled—was carrying a large amount of bottled beer. The other, a rather delicate brunette named Simon, had some packets of crisps and other staples of student diets. The beer was deposited on the small table next to the bed.
“And that is precisely what I do not understand!” he protested quite vehemently. I felt his back stiffen.
“There is a distinct seven-minute interval between periods of intense activity,” he reported succinctly.
“’She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John’s invitation.’”
[This piece, like only a few others in Doctor John Watson’s infamous dispatch box of unpublished writing, is crisp and clean. It has been folded once and does not appear to have been opened and re-read often—if at all.]
Now that we are to one another—what we are—I look back at this period with some astonishment. It was so very early in our friendship—we were really barely acquainted in some ways—but tending to Sherlock when these horrible moods struck him was something that I never once considered a burden or an imposition. As with his headaches, I understood that he was not able to control them, and although I could not truly treat them as I did his poor head, I do believe that I was a comfort.
He remained silent for a few moments, his head down and his countenance obscured from me. “Do you mean that?” he finally asked, mumbling against his knees.
—that I had never experienced with anyone else. His interest in me, his inclusion of me in his cases—insistence, really—his complete ease (to the point of immodesty) around me—how could I have not construed it?
Persuading him to take in any sort of nourishment has been equally ineffective. At this point I do not care in the slightest what he eats—if he would only eat something. Sometimes he can be convinced to take some cake or a jelly—he does love his sweets. But anything proper and strengthening—a lovely roast pheasant such as what was brought up last night—he eschews.
She entered the bedroom quietly. “Good evening,” she said politely to the older brother, who was sitting at the small desk, fidgeting with his mobile. He looked dreadful. “Are you all right?” she inquired.
The fussing had woken Mycroft after a far-too-short kip; he was now observing her as she directed him back into the bedroom by a firm grip on his elbow. He was balking at this, which didn’t surprise Mycroft in the slightest.
I made quick work with my sponge—and every stroke of it drew from him a whispered sigh of satisfaction; of contentedness; of desire. He was, without a doubt, in desperate need of a bath, and I was vigorous in my ablutions. And then I was done and he was fresh and clean and both of us were so very rigid and without preamble I engulfed him with my eager mouth and at the same time stirred his balls until he became quite speechless and rather unsure of his legs and it was a simple thing to tip him onto the bed and to rip off my own trousers and as I rather violently attacked his lips with my own my prick encountered his and I moaned and I thrust and I grasped at him and he at me and I knew that all my hard work with the sponge was going to waste as we both grew hot and soon soaked with perspiration as I continued to almost angrily thrust against his lovely cock and then I wanted to take it in my mouth again but—
“Do you want to write something?” The doctor offered his clipboard and pen. Sherlock’s writing sprawled across the paper. He wrote rather slowly, they all noted, and seemed to be concentrating quite hard, but then he handed the clipboard back to the doctor. “Germanium-nickel-uranium-sulphur?” he read aloud, struggling a bit to decipher both the handwriting and the spelling. He had transposed several sets of letters.
I am sure that all of this had passed through Sherlock’s mind in the time it took him to jump down from the windowsill.
And I certainly had a rich source of material—currently sitting on a high stool at his table of chemicals, using a pipette to add a blue liquid to a beaker of something an unappetizing shade of green (did it just move on its own? He is not leaving that vile stuff sitting there when he is done). My ridiculous man.
Mycroft knew he was experiencing an uneasy combination of stress (loathe as he was to admit it) and fatigue, but it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It left him with a vague sense of unreality that gave everything a somewhat soft edge. It wasn’t that he was not thinking clearly—that would never happen—but it smoothed and cushioned the hard edges of what he was feeling—both physical sensations and his emotions. He had been eating whatever was placed in front of him automatically, but he was not aware of feeling either hungry or satiated. He had showered when it was convenient. He had slept as much as he could when he could.
The man in front of him, dressed in a dark shirt, black jeans, and, surprisingly, a suit jacket, was clearly high as a kite. He was talking a mile a minute even before Lestrade could move directly in front of him, gesticulating wildly. His pupils were wide and dark, and he moved in little jerks.
“Yes.” He sounded distinctly sulky. “But only when I have pushed you far more than any more ordinary man.”
“I should like to point out that, firstly, the statement in Leviticus is not part of the ‘ten commandments’ that are supposed to represent the most moral of acts—or the least moral, I suppose. Secondly, Leviticus is in the ‘Old Testament,’ and in theory, people who term themselves ‘Christian’ adhere more closely to the strictures set out in the ‘New Testament’. Our... particular behaviours
“Doctor Watson,” she repeated somewhat sharply, “I am not as delicate as you may think. Tell me honestly how you are doing.”
“And about the ill will which existed between my father and my mother due to... those circumstances.”
And now we are here. I’ve been back for a few hours, and he is being so very sweet at the moment, allowing me time to write. He greeted me so eagerly upon my return that it quite touched me, and I admit that I greeted him likewise. Even those several hours apart, after being with him every moment for so many days, were rather harder than I had realised they would be.
I had already discarded the concept of supper. I knew that he would not eat nor drink, and I admit that I had no heart to do so either. I could have a drink once we reached Baker Street.
Mrs Hudson’s relating of the beginnings of the life of our new friend had piqued my interest, and now I encouraged her to share her experiences with me as she swept and wiped and beat cushions.
“Belinda, I am so sorry, but Mr Holmes has had a small argument with the fireplace.” I indicated the mess he had left. That the mess was more from his efforts to clean up than from the original situation was the only thing keeping me from shouting at him. I had banished him to his bedroom, however.
“What on earth is going on, Doctor?” Mrs. Hudson demanded. She was standing before me in the hall, her arms crossed and her face severe. She was wearing her nightdress. She glared down at my case. “Did you two have an argument?”
That was when I put two and two together. Mr. Harper was an eligible bachelor. Perhaps a young woman had set her heart on him but—but what? Was there some issue which prevented her from becoming his wife? Why would she enact such a bizarre trick?
She explained that upon mutual agreement you had completely broken off contact and indeed did not know precisely where in America she was living, nor her assumed name. To her new acquaintances in New York, she described herself as a widow of an officer in Her Majesty’s army. If pressed for more details, she would feign grief, thus embarrassing the questioning individual into a withdrawal of their inquiry.
Matilda’s patient, sprawled out across the mattress, groaned unconvincingly. “Oh, poor you,” she responded lightly. “You’re going to have breakfast with your brother, and you’ve got a nice new suit to wear.”
“Not yet. Why?” Honestly, I was not sure if I had done the forks yet, so distracted was I by the image of that lithe body in front of me.
“Oh, please. I do know that on top of everything else you’ve been going through nicotine withdrawals. You were probably smoking like a chimney the entire time you were gone. Did it at least take the edge off?”
He nearly dropped the pot. He looked up slowly. Benjamin stood in the doorway; he had been summoned to receive his instructions for the proposed excursion.
This hit me so very hard I sat back in my chair, stunned. 1878? Sherlock and I had moved into our rooms in 1881. It had happened—it had all happened—so much more recently than I had realised.
The quiet man bent his head down as he began to examine each page of the oversized tome. He was quite focused and methodical. He carefully opened the book and smoothed his hands across the pages, and then, using his fingers as a guide, scanned each map.
In fact, it is those changes that have spurred me to complete this bit of our history. We have just returned from a stay there, and despite my darling’s complaints of boredom, it was a generally successful and peaceful holiday. I feel quite refreshed and able to face my notes of that dark time which is—thankfully—now in our past.
“We can take turns,” he exclaimed after examining them. “Doing the same… puzzle, and count… time us.”
He regretted finishing his egg; it would have made a much more satisfying mess on Mycroft’s elegant, understated wallpaper than the empty cup did.
“What is it?” I encouraged. “You were about to tell me something—and please know that this is all in the deepest confidence and I will
He made a sort of whimpering sound and allowed his head to tip forward, pressing against my stomach as I stood in front of him.
Shouldn’t it be someone else doing that? Someone shorter, with dark eyes and sort of blond, sort of grey hair?
“Then we will get to the heart of things. Shall I summarise?” I continued without waiting for a response. “I admitted to becoming stimulated at an investigation. It was inappropriate of me, but sometimes one cannot control these matters. I excused myself and our client and his maid were none the wiser.
We ascended to our rooms shortly before ten o’clock, and although he is well on the road to recovery, I did insist that he have his milk and then encouraged him to change his clothes and ready himself for sleep. He asked me something at that point that even now I hesitate to record, but as it is only my eyes that will ever see these sheets, I will put this down.
“They did not actually say much more than what I have already expressed. I simply described—again—how I had been feeling that morning and how your actions were—are—very stimulating.”
“Once again, surely the doctor here is not the only medical man who has discovered a better application of his skills and knowledge than attending to sick headaches and ‘bad chests’.” Sherlock fiddled with his cigarette, examining its smoking end intently.
“Oh, my love! Of course we can.” I would not have wanted to move right at that moment even if he had risen from my lap. I needed time to collect myself; his sorrow was so heartfelt that he had nearly brought me to tears.
I paused, absorbing this information and turning it over in my head. “You’ve done this before,” I finally remarked.
“Possibly...” He mulled over this for a moment. “But you cannot possibly believe that I would allow you to go on your own.”
He was on the floor at the foot of my bed, curled up and leaning against the bedpost. I fell to my knees in front of him. “I am so sorry,” I whispered. I reached out and realised that my hands were shaking. “I will never leave you like that again—not when you are so low.” I reached out and put a finger under his chin, and raised his head with difficulty. I was mortified to see that his face was drenched with tears.
They had headed back up to his room. Yes, he was tired—he was clumsy ascending the stairs. As soon as they were in his room, he climbed back on the bed, looking hopefully at the book they had laid down there.
“You will tend to your own bedroom—no leaving soiled clothing in odd corners or a mess when you shave.”
She nodded and answered the call. “Yes?” She spoke briskly; professionally. She listened for a few seconds. “So, he’s back?” A pause. Listening. “No,” she replied calmly. “I haven’t seen him. I’ll let you know if I do. Bye.” She ended the call. “Get going,” she breathed, tipping her head towards the door.
But there was no response. He seemed to sink back into himself. He began to study the bath water—raising his hand and watching with interest as the water droplets coming off his fingers made ripples.
But who would do such a thing? Burglary was clearly not the purpose—as far as I knew. At least the client had not revealed that anything had gone missing from the house whilst I was in his presence.
“You know that I enjoy new clothes. In fact, you have remarked more than once that my taste in clothing is faddish.”
Sherlock turned off the lamp and lay back in his bed, staring at the ceiling through the darkness. He knew he was feeling something or many things, he wasn’t sure yet, but he was feeling rather than thinking. He didn’t like it, he never had. He closed his eyes and just felt for a few minutes. Then he sat back up and decided to think instead.
“I mean I can’t really walk around pressed against you while you’re seeing patients,” Sherlock said. “Are you planning to quit?”
"I don't understand what's wrong," Sherlock said. He threw down his cigarette butt and started walking.
"I . . . no, I came for the invoice . . ." John said, looking at the mugs sitting out and wondering if Sherlock had prepared this for him.
“Right,” Sherlock said. He’d been talking about the flat, but John was talking about the woman.  He poured his tea and came back to the table. “Let’s not talk about the case,” he said, hoping to change the subject but then realising how unusual a thing it was for him to want. “I just mean I don’t want to make you anxious, now that you’re going to back to being a doctor for a day.”
John nodded again as he sat down in his chair with a heavy sigh. "You were right -- this was a bad idea."
For a millisecond, Sherlock considered calling John – John was the one who helped people. But if the man was sick or injured, why would he have come here and not a hospital?
John tapped his fingers against his thigh as they made their way home. He didn't know what to expect. He was nervous for the first time in a long time, but in a good, excited way.
Suddenly the pleasure was too much for Sherlock. “Yes, John, yes,” he began mumbling as he felt his cock jerk and spill. His hand moved desperately, wanting John to feel this good as well.
“John!” Sherlock called but he’d hung up. He set his phone down. He actually felt more agitated than when he’d called. He moved to the kitchen for a cup of tea. His favourite? What was that comment about? John knew it’d just annoy Sherlock. Why was he trying to further upset him?
Sherlock took the book from him and handed John the wine glass instead. Curling his legs onto the sofa, he turned to face John as his hand slid over the back of the sofa and lightly fingered the hair on the back of John’s head. “I’m sure you found out a lot -- you’re very good at finding things out,” he purred. “You know what else you do well?”
“I see,” Sherlock said, looking down. He took a sip of his tea even though it was now cold. “What’s that all about, then? PTSD?” he asked softly.
John finished eating, put away the leftovers, and then sat with his computer to start taking notes. He started with what Sherlock told him before he forgot it all, and then devised his own plan about trying to find the girlfriend tomorrow.
Sherlock lifted the top and looked at the items in the box. He pulled out a few army men and handed them to John. “These are yours,” he said.
Lestrade stepped into the flat and noticed Sherlock was not alone. “I’m sorry . . . am I interrupting something?” he asked.
“I’m glad you think so,” Sherlock said. “Mrs Hudson agrees as well. But we needn’t tell her about all this,” he added moving his hand between their bodies.
"I don't have anything specific. But I have stories about John from when we were little he probably doesn't want you to know. I know his middle name. I know some other things . . ." she smiled and shrugged. "He worries about silly things. Plus he'd never want to be embarrassed in front of you."
“You should. You’re good at it,” Sherlock said, taking a sip of tea. “I liked the tiger one. Just don’t fall asleep yourself before you’ve finished telling tonight’s,” Sherlock said.
"I'll get it," John said, stretching before walking out of the room without even putting his clothes on. He didn't even think about it until he was coming back into the room again.
She sighed and nodded. "True. I hope his mother isn't too fond of her walls . . ." She looked at the bullet hole smiley face on the wall. "Hmm. Well, I just came up to tell you if you need anything just let me know."
John arrived a bit early, got his drink, and picked his spot, just like always. He sat in the tall stool chair and looked around. The place wasn't very crowded, so they weren't off to a good start. John saw his friend moving around the stage, holding an earpiece and murmuring instructions. He looked stressed but completely in his element. John took out his phone to pass the time a bit -- it wasn't long before the band came out. John put his phone away and looked around at the crowd. At first people looked interested, dancing along to the music. But as the second and third songs started, people were losing interest. They started talking amongst themselves, leaving to get drinks with no worry about getting back quickly. Between songs the band tried talking to the crowd and riling them up, but the lead was a bit awkward and his jokes and comments weren't landing -- the laughter leaned toward mockery. John was typing this all up as he was seeing it. He used to feel bad, but he didn't anymore, not now that he knew his friend wasn't affected. He would help the band get some tips and tricks, try them again in a different setting, and eventually he'd find the right fit for them. He was good at his job.
John sat at his desk and worked on the computer for a long time, taking notes for the paper he had to write. Forty pages on an advanced medical procedure and the effect of it on society. He hated writing papers, but he was so close to the end of school and to the start of a residency that he tried to ignore his annoyance about it. Four hours later he had to break for more food. His friend had texted for another job, and John accepted eagerly. After staring at the computer for the last few hours, he was ready to get out into the real world for something fun. He didn't know the band playing, but he didn't mind. That made it easier to do the job his friend needed him to do since he didn't go in with his own biases. As he was getting ready he wondered if that rude man was going to be there again. He didn't know why he thought of him all of a sudden. He imagined that the night would be more interesting if he showed up again.
“He’s not coming,” she said. “Please don’t smile or complain. I don’t precisely know why he’s not coming -- you know how he talks in circles, and I wasn’t in the mood to fight him. It’s all right.”
John shook his head. "I know she won't know the difference, but I want to trust her. She's stuck with it and worked hard . . . let's just see and hope for the best. She won't be here for another couple hours."
John got ready for bed and set his alarm, wondering about Sherlock. This drugs case seemed to have thrown him off a bit so it would be good if a simple case turned up to keep him busy.
Harry patted his shoulder and gave him a small, genuine smile before heading up to the bedroom. John paced back and forth as his mind raced with what he was going to do about this and how exactly he was going to keep it all a secret from Sherlock.
Sherlock thought for a moment. He really hadn't had many flatmates -- he had his own room when he was a child but he did share with a few people in college. John was his flatmate, of course, but he also felt like more than that. He thought for a few more minutes and then took a drink. "My turn," he said. "I have never lied to you -- except for the few times, which you know about and which I've apologized for so we don't need to go into all that again."
He lazed around for a bit and then forced himself to start tidying. The flat wasn't even messy, but he felt he wanted to make an effort for John. He wanted to do something different because things were different, even now that it would just be the two of them alone. He stripped John's bed and replaced the sheets and then did the same to his own. He put away the clean dishes and a few of the small messes he'd made across the flat. Once he'd finished, he fancied a bath so took one and then took a cup of tea and a book to his room to wait for John's return.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a minute. His skin didn’t really hurt that much -- John’s touch and the cool aloe felt quite nice actually. When John had finished, he said, “Thanks for always thinking of things I don’t. Should I put my shirt back on or leave it off?”
Sherlock steepled his fingers. "You're doing the Twelve Steps but not attending meetings?" he asked.
Sherlock moved swiftly up and down John's cock. He could feel his own straining against his trousers. With one of his hands, he gripped John's thigh. John carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair as he looked down again. That mouth looked perfect -- the sight had John leaking.
John studied Sherlock's face, remembering the question coming up in the middle of sex. "If you'd like me to," he said.
Sherlock slowly pushed a finger inside John. It was so intimate, being inside him like this. Since John had moved in, they’d shared so much, but this -- and what was going to happen -- was the most intimate thing they could share and the thought was almost too much.
“You know what it means,” she said. “I’m teasing you,” she added before turning to John and saying,” He’s lovely actually, don’t worry.”
As they were hanging up their coats, John took a deep breath and turned to Sherlock. He held his gaze for a minute, stepped closer and kissed him hard.
Sherlock lay down next to John, quickly reaching over to touch him as he kissed his mouth again. “It’s been a long time . . .” he said softly. “But I remember how to do all this. . .”
“On occasion, I may need a mind like yours,” Mycroft said. “Not this time, obviously, but in the future.”
"It's drugs, import or manufacture, they don’t know yet, but they're trying to get the boss. We should go over to get all the details.”
“Just read, worked, that sort of business,” Sherlock said, keeping it vague. “We might have a couple clients I’ll check out tomorrow while you’re at work.”
"Don't you try and get me into even more trouble," John said. "Let's talk about what you made for dinner."
Sherlock got to work -- it was so much easier when things were just normal in the flat. He occasionally glanced over at John, glad he was home. He made great progress in just a few hours.
“What have I done? I’ve stayed inside all day -- I’m not even lying,” Sherlock said. “You told me to stay inside while you were at work and I did, so why am I in trouble?”
Sherlock pulled her wine glass toward him. “All right you’re cut off,” he said. “Complaining about things being boring is very childish -- you must be drunk.”
"I am," Sherlock said, moving a little closer. "I suppose I always knew the potential was there, but now . . . was this your ultimate goal?"
Later that night, while he was having dinner with Mrs. Hudson, he got a text from Williams. He had paid for a more extensive background check than the company's usual pre-employment one and found a whole secret life to his assistant. She was arrested, along with his partner, and the money was going to be distributed back where it was supposed to be from the beginning. He enjoyed his meal with a little more gusto after that, ignoring Mrs. Hudson's curious looks. She didn't ask, but she looked happy as well. After she went home for the night, John found himself at the computer, staring at the blog again. He was supposed to write about what happened to him, to get over his trauma. It couldn't hurt to write this up like old times -- it was only one story about helping a friend. That was all. He licked his lips and started typing slowly.
Sherlock slipped his phone into his pocket and handed the driver some money. He got out, unlocked the door to Baker Street and moved quickly up the stairs. He took a deep breath and stepped inside the flat.
Sherlock was alone on a train. He had “cleaned up” a section of Moriarty’s network and was moving on to another. As Mycroft had instructed. He’d spent the last six month doing as Mycroft had instructed. Of course he enjoyed the challenge, but he was also tired. His body was thinner and weaker. His mind was still as strong, but his heart ached. It’d taken him a little while to realise what was happening, but eventually he knew what was happening: he was missing London, he was missing the flat, he was missing John. He told his brother he was ready to go home.
As soon as John’s trousers were opened, Sherlock slipped a hand inside his pants and began stroking him. His cock was hot and hard. Despite it being a while since Sherlock had felt like this, he was filled with want. He got down on his knees, pulling John’s trousers and pants with him and sucked his cock into his mouth.
He is pacing and muttering to himself, but does not seem inclined towards the violence we experienced yesterday. I will stretch out on the bed in here and perhaps escape to my own dreams for a while.
It was then that he begged to turn our minds to something more cheerful for a few hours, and it was then that I came up with something which seemed to fit the bill.
“I should certainly hope so,” he snapped back, but it seemed to be without his usual vehemence. “I have to admit that I am impressed.”
“Doctor Watson and I share diggings. We have done so for some years now. In fact, that is how we met—we were both seeking someone with whom to share lodgings. Hardly an unusual arrangement, particularly considering the costs of rent in London.”
“Yes, John,” he agreed sweetly, “but for the moment, the door to the corridor is locked, the curtains are drawn, it is quite late at night, and if you would turn down the gas again, I should like to add to my collection of observations regarding arousal.”
“It is as you say, John,” he admitted as a shudder of delight ran all the way down his slender body.
“No,” he admitted. I could actually see his brain working; reviewing his wardrobe—for despite his decidedly Bohemian approach when in the privacy of our home, every single garment that he wore outside of our rooms was respectable, sedate, correct. Even when travelling in the country, his tweeds and boots somehow looked more—dignified, I suppose—than mine. Finally, he responded. “I have remarked more than once on your taste in clothing—and music—and novels—and all sorts of things, John, but it was just to remark on them. I never once meant to be insulting. I
“John… are you quite well?” He glanced briefly at the bell pull, obviously wishing to summon assistance—or interference.
“Good Lord, Sherlock. You smell like you’ve been rolling around in manure. What have you been doing?”
“Now, before you have your pudding, you will change into your pyjamas, and after you’re done, it’s lights out. I am not tolerating this topsy-turvy schedule. A man in your condition needs regular meals and a full night’s sleep.”
“That is my intention,” I retorted, kissing his cheek in amusement. We lay quietly for a moment, and then something struck me.  “Sherlock, at some point I would like to hear about your resolution of the case,” I remarked.
are not, but urges in general are. They are as natural as feeling hungry or sleepy. All right, perhaps that was not a good example for you… or perhaps it was. It is not that you do not feel hungry or tired. Your body does feel those things. Your body requires nourishment and rest. You just choose to ignore those feelings—or more precisely to suppress them for a time. It is the same for your more… base needs. You have just admitted that you felt those things, before we ever even knew each other—but you seemed to have ignored them or pushed them away somehow exactly as you do with feelings of hunger or exhaustion.”
But he smiled sadly as he accepted the book thrust at him with one shaking hand and sank down onto the sofa next to his baby brother.
He groaned and I heard the bed creak as he extracted himself from the bedclothes and rose. “Very well, Mrs. Hudson,” he replied, his voice hoarse with sleep. “Please allow us a few minutes to dress before you bring him up—and coffee. I require a great deal of coffee.”
“You have a great need, brother mine,” Mycroft supplied sadly. “I am afraid that our mother’s affliction has cursed you far more than we realised. I did not have any other recourse but to send her to that asylum, and if you persist in your current activity I will have no choice but to have you placed in one as well.”
He had not gone to work the day I treated little Lucy, who had wispy thin curls of a sandy colour like his, and it was clear from his demeanour that he was dedicated to his small family and distraught at the idea that he might lose his daughter. They had lost a son, several years prior, before his first birthday, but the pain was still fresh.
I considered her for a few moments. I know that other doctors, presented with a similar case, would probably offer laudanum or something similar. I knew that those cases, more often than not, ended not in the relief of the sufferer, but instead in the deepest of sorrow for the patient’s family. I considered a stimulant, but was not certain of the effects. What if it simply exacerbated her feelings?
No, that was not correct. I did have one more piece of information—and it was one that I had inadvertently taken away with me. I reached into my coat pocket. Yes, the sheet on which I had been inventorying those mysterious items was there. I recalled now that I had thrust it in as I had hurried out of the house. It was rather crumpled. I smoothed it out and examined it.
Perhaps predictably, Mrs. Bloom recovered herself first, and she was livid. “How dare you?” she hissed. “How
. We kept separate bedrooms. I even, at times, lived elsewhere—ostensibly due to the detective’s maddening habits involving his chemical experiments—which proved nothing regarding our relationship or our natures beyond Holmes’ brilliant if rather eccentric one. That I often tended to him in an intimate manner—well, the man was notorious for getting himself shot at, stabbed, or nearly drowned in the course of his investigations, and his recurring illnesses necessitated my medical attentions as well. Every eccentricity of my love could, in fact, explain any possible scenarios of supposed inversion.
“Only if I can see the body,” was the obnoxious and somehow eager response. “I’ll be positive, then.”
“What will happen to… Belinda?” Sherlock’s query, delivered with no warning, brought me to an abrupt halt. I had been neglecting him of late, I had realised, and that evening I was attempting to rectify the situation. He was, when he asked his surprising question, quite bare, and I was rather enjoying the feel of his smooth skin under my fingers as I rubbed lavender oil into it.
“Precisely. Up.” I rose, sliding him off my lap and to his feet. He obediently began to head towards his bedroom. I grabbed his hand and spun him so that he was facing me. “You realise that we will not have a new maid for a few days?” I whispered, placing my face close to his.
“And how they are to be prepared… I’m sorry, Mrs Parker,” he interrupted himself, sounding uncharacteristically contrite.  “You’ve always done an exemplary job catering to his predilections.”
For the second and possibly more alarming factor was that he dashed our door open with no warning whatsoever—eliciting Sherlock’s ejaculation, complete with the pejorative word “devil,” which was so rare for him. We were fortunate that we were both, having had received our early-morning visitor, completely and properly dressed, and engaged in our conversation with Sherlock in his own chair and I in mine. What if we had not been so keen on the case? What if we had been engaged in a rather more personal conversation—or even more intimate activities?
I took another drink, then a deep breath. “I do not mean to bring up unpleasant memories, my dear lady, but I thought that it was cholera that took them.”
His brother allowed himself to be slowly guided out of the bathroom. His chin was to his chest and his steps were unsteady. The new nurse (Mycroft had stopped even wondering about their names) was calm; steady. Almost clinical. That was fine. He got his brother seated on the bed and bent to retrieve the shirt he had dropped. It was not a proper pyjama shirt, he noted, but one of his oldest buttoned shirts. He frowned at its appearance. Apparently, Mrs Parker had held onto it to be made useful in circumstances exactly like this.
Perhaps it is simply because it is springtime in London, and I long for the opportunity to throw open the windows, to air out our rooms from some dreadful, noxious experiment, and to hear once more him play his violin.
I took my cue and, as gently as I was able, took hold of my darling’s hands. “Sherlock,” I said calmly, “leave the packing for a bit and come tell us your plans.” I drew him to myself before turning him and, with my hands on his shoulders, directed him into the sitting room. He struggled a bit, looking longingly at his case over his shoulder, but his brother, following us directly, rather emphatically shut the bedroom door behind us.
In the privacy of our rooms, I am anguish and sorrow. I am devastation and horror. I am empty. I am racked by guilt. Why could I not save him?
“I...” Mrs. Bloom paused, gathering her thoughts. It was time to unsheathe her last weapon. She took a deep breath, glanced around us (the dining room had thinned out considerably), and nodded firmly. She had decided to play her ace. “Mrs. Watson shared with me your lack of attention to the marriage bed, and your inability to satisfy your ultimate responsibilities as a husband.”
“It is understandable,” he remarked. “You wished to detach yourself from an untenable situation. No one bears you a grudge, including myself.”
Anthea sighed and wished that she had brought something for lunch. She was getting hungry and it would be a long afternoon.
“Thank you,” I murmured. “He really cannot bear to see anyone for whom he cares to suffer in any way.”
We had both slept for a few hours—I did not realise until he had drifted off how very tired I was, as well, so I was surprised when his sweet, deep voice roused me. “I still do not understand why you purchased those garments.”
I was somewhat astounded at the usually stalwart man’s reaction to this light teasing. He hesitated—I have never known Mycroft Holmes to hesitate. But we both kept quiet and he almost instantly recovered his usual haughty attitude and expression.
“Well, then. I suppose we will have to keep this to ourselves until it hits the news?” Mummy’s inquiry was dry and bitter.
He had stiffened when Mycroft first embraced him, but as his brother repeated his name, softly, he began to relax the slightest bit. “Come along, Sherlock,” he instructed softly. “Let’s get into the car.”
The blasted bell had rung just then, and as I leapt from the bed in anticipation of our landlady knocking one of us up, I was instantly aware that my prick was positively engorged.
“Well, yes, of course. That is why sometimes simply holding a crying baby close—against your chest—comforts and quiets them.”
“I have come to realise—through her most excellent service—that although I did miss terribly cooking for you and Himself, I found it quite a relief not to have to do the really heavy cleaning. I am not getting any younger—no, let me finish (for I nearly interrupted her with an objection to this statement), and my back and my knees could do without the worst of it. So, Belinda will come in three days a week and tend to those tasks here, and three days at Mrs Turner’s, and that will allow her to manage well enough.”
Dr. Grimesby Roylott was as awful as his stepdaughter described. His sudden appearance at our door was even more alarming than I related in my retelling of the incident, for I did not dwell on two matters of great concern to us. The first was that he had actually forced his way into the house. During our intense discussion of the possibilities of the case, we had not noticed the bell, and the bellicose villain had quite literally pushed our dear Mrs. Hudson aside in his impatience to gain entry. She was so taken aback that it was a moment before she could recover herself, and by then he was already at the head of the stairs. I did not bring this up with Sherlock; he would have been so distressed. Further distressed.
Oh, Sherlock. Wasn’t that what I had been trying to explain? “Because you are my closest friend,” I told him plainly. “I do not wish to see you move away to live in New York or anywhere else.”
“So, when you said that your weakness was caused by the heat, I knew that to be somewhat of an untruth.”
I did as I had said, seating myself on a decorative little bench that was tucked under a lattice covered all over in ivy. The greenery threw a pleasant, cool shade onto the seat and I shut my eyes.
He explained to me that he had wanted to know more about Mrs. Bloom, in order to ascertain whether she was truly a threat. Had she done anything like this before? Did she follow through when she asserted that she was going to do anything? How did she act towards the shopkeepers? Towards her neighbours?
Oddly, I did not nor do I now blame Mary. I had put her in an untenable situation, and she had risen from the wreck of our marriage with calm and bravery. Would I have been able to relocate to another country, as she had? Even with my experience as ‘three continents Watson’, I have to admit to myself, as I did then, that no, I would not have been able to move from my beloved England, which I had missed so greatly during my service.
“Lie down, love,” she suggested. She smoothed the blankets over him and he was asleep almost immediately.
He adored hugs and cuddles and kisses and a firm but gentle hand rubbing his back. He was a bit quirky about food in a way that Mycroft had never been, and of course he was so very easily overstimulated, but he seemed to crave affection.
I ignored his jab. “Yes. Your brother is correct. I do not know if I can always keep you safe. I try to contain you when I must, but you are too clever for me by far and highly adept at escaping my restraints, such as they are. I do not wish to employ anything more extreme, such as we are now, but, Sherlock, if it is to keep you safe, I will do it.”
“And did not inform me.” I admit that I sounded a bit angry—even those few months together had made me protective of the man and of my relationship with him. I was jealous.
“No; a client.” She proceeded to explain that a young lady was waiting for us in our sitting-room, and that she had something very pressing to communicate.
he demanded. Well, he tried to demand. He was baffled; the words simply wouldn’t come. He took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and tried again. Nothing. This was madness! Sherlock Holmes, unable to ask the simplest question?
Finally, Sherlock had hit a wall. He had consumed a surprising amount—one and a half pieces of toast, three-quarters of the orange, and most of his tea—but now his uninjured eye was closing of its own accord and his chin dropped to his chest a few times.
Wife Number 2, as he thought of her, had recently requested that he remove himself from their flat. Apparently his erratic and infrequent appearances were getting the kids upset.
I must turn my attention away from him and focus on something else or he will drive me mad, and then won’t Mycroft have a handful?
, he muttered to himself. Probably tracking down the source of some bauble or other all the crime scenes had in common. That was the only reason he could think of that would get the younger man anywhere near the immense and wildly popular store at this time of year.
“Are you admitting,” he responded in a low tone, “that my activities at a crime scene encourage—” His brows drew down.
I absorbed this information quietly, while rather absent-mindedly rubbing his back. Finally, I was able to speak. “You are certain?” He nodded against my shoulder. “Then you are probably correct, my love,” I admitted slowly.
I moved toward the stove. There was, indeed, a pot of some sort of white soup on it. I peered closely at it and frowned. “What are those dark bits?” I asked.
“John,” he reproached, “you were a solider in Afghanistan, which has a much more inhospitable climate than England. You have shared with me the horrors of the conditions of your service and of the misery of your illness, and even in the throes of the worst of your fevers, you have never actually remarked that it was too hot for you.
“Come, now, Mrs. H.,” I cajoled. The more time that passed since my disastrous morning, the lighter I felt. By bedtime, perhaps I would discover that it was just a dream. That Sherlock had not yet returned helped this self-delusion immensely.
“It was a long time ago,” he began, and I tightened my embrace. “And even Mycroft does not know all—he was away at school for a great deal of it—although he deduced what had been occurring when he came home for the holidays.” I waited as he paused, gathering his resolve. “My father was an intelligent man, and he had enough self-control to not create any new marks when he knew my brother would soon be home.”
"Just try not to focus on it -- whatever she said tonight, try to forget it," Sherlock said. "Look, why don't you sleep in my room tonight?"
“It’s probably wise,” Sherlock said, shifting John off him. He took another sip of whiskey then picked up his phone. “John, it’s just gone seven,” he looked over at John. “It’s only seven o’clock.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. He hadn’t really felt much about it at the time. It’s not like he’d hated it, but it definitely wasn’t very sexy or anything, because there was also something about it that felt like a trick. He thought about seeing Ellen with Jim at the end of term. “It was the person,” he said. “I didn’t like her.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and held himself with one hand and rested the other on John's thigh as he lowered himself down onto him. The feeling was incredible. He looked up at John's face and said, "You okay?"
"I'll find out what's going on," John said. He went back out into the hall and found the nurse. "Can you tell me what is happening with my friend, Sherlock Holmes?"
“No, it’s clear you’re smart enough,” Sherlock said. “I suppose I just assumed you were more interested in going out and trying to make red-headed men fall in love you.”
Sherlock groaned at John’s movement, but lifted his hands quickly to hold John’s head, keeping the kiss going. Then he slid his hand between their bodies to stroke himself again. Every nerve was on fire, and his body felt tight and hot.
Sherlock got up and put on the kettle, stretching a bit as he waited for it to boil. “Tea?” he asked.
"They were fun," Sherlock said. "They definitely helped with feeling trapped inside." He wrapped his arms around himself. "So, your answer?"
John leaned up and reached into the drawer, taking out the lube. He reached in again for the condoms. Sherlock grabbed the bottle and spilled some into his hand. He started stroked John. Then he slipped his hand between John's legs, slicking everywhere as he teased his tight hole with his fingertips.
"I guess this one," Sherlock said, pointing. "I think I move when I sleep." He sat down on the bed. "Did you have a particular film in mind?"
“I don’t know -- when I realised it wasn’t you . . . I didn’t recognise her face. She turned and went into one of the offices so I followed her.”
“So I’m still the hero?” Sherlock asked, realising his question was quite childish. But that’s how bedtime stories were supposed to work. “I look forward to tonight’s adventure,” he added finishing up his tea.
By the time the bath water had cooled, Sherlock felt clear on everything that had been confusing him about John -- from the moment they’d met until tonight’s little explosion. He got himself dried and dressed and went out to the kitchen. He poured himself a small glass of wine, sat down on the sofa and took a deep breath.
John looked up from the kettle when Sherlock called out. "Very funny," he said. Then he realised Sherlock was actually heading for the door with his coat. He hurried over and blocked Sherlock's path to the door. "You're not leaving this flat, Sherlock. You can't."
Sherlock kept his eye on the clock -- it seemed like she'd been gone a long time. Was that a good or a bad sign? Maybe she and Clara had reconciled and they'd start a new life together, and Harry would never come back to the flat. That seemed unlikely. He pushed back his chair and got up. "Tea?" he asked.
“A rat? I thought they wanted a dog?” Sherlock said, then he glanced over and pretended to zip his lips. But then he unzipped them and asked, “Do you care if I lie down? Maybe your story will help me fall asleep.” He zipped his lips again and turned and stretched out on the sofa, making sure his feet stayed away from John. He nodded at John to continue.
“In other words, fine -- I’m fine,” Sherlock said. “I’m better than yesterday and thus I’m more confident this idea of going away is even more ridiculous than I was then. I think I should just come home. I can ‘relax’ there.”
"So he really left? I really didn't think he would, but then when his mother is involved . . . well, he doesn't like to upset her."
"I wish you didn't have to go either," John said. "But you're going to love it. The science program -- you can do so many cools things. Better than our school."
Sherlock was pleased with John's answer. He had him sit down and then he opened a file on his computer and showed him the notes he'd been taking, as he explained everything he'd been working on. He knew no one found this stuff very interesting -- including John probably -- but he really appreciated John's letting him explain it. "What do you think?" he asked.
Sherlock still didn’t know what to do. He didn’t like her compliments, and the kissing really didn’t make him feel anything.
When he finished, he put his plate on the table. “When I get bored in a bit, I’ll do the washing up and bring in tea,” he said, sneakily moving closer to John. After a few minutes, he moved even closer until eventually his legs were half over John’s lap and he was leaning against him. “This okay?” he asked.
Sherlock pulled out two plates from the cupboard. “Well, have you cracked the case -- used your brilliant charm to seduce a confession?” he asked.
“He died,” Sherlock said. He glanced over with a smile. “I think he was murdered, but I don’t know how yet.”
"Okay, but I don't know any funny jokes except the ones from my childhood." He picked up the phone and dialed a random number, listening to it ring on the speaker. John cleared his throat just as the man answered.
Sherlock undid John's zip. Then he stepped back and lowered himself to the ground. He pulled down John's trousers and then pants, freeing his hardening cock. He gripped it, stroking a few times, before slipping the tip between his lips and beginning to suck and swirl his tongue over him.
“All right,” Sherlock said. He got out a mug for himself. “I’ve got nothing pressing tomorrow, so I suppose it doesn’t matter if I don’t sleep.”
“Yes . . . If you want me to. So far it’s gone well, right?” Sherlock said.  “I’d only do it with you.”
"How so?" John asked, looking over at Sherlock. He really was very handsome with those features and dark hair. John wanted to put his hands in that hair, and suddenly he wondered what those sharp features would look like softened in pleasure. John felt his cheeks heat, and he looked away while waiting for Sherlock's answer.
This was pointless and Sherlock knew it. He crushed the cigarette out and slammed his body against the bed. He hated his brother and Moriarty. They had caused all this. They had caused him to lie to John. But John didn’t know that. John thought he was dead.
"Nothing is wrong. No," he said. "I . . . I really like your gift," he repeated. "Mrs Hudson was saying a lot about it."
John walked into the flat and looked around. It was tidier than he'd even seen it actually. There were flowers all over, and he smelled food -- not take out but food actually cooking and filling the air. "Sherlock . . ."
Mrs Hudson made the tea and brought his cup over. “Yes, you should eat,” she said, wanting to comment on his weight loss but deciding not to. “Then a good night’s rest in your own bed, okay?” She stood for a second then said, “He’ll be back so I’ll go, but you know where I am if you need me.”
“You’re not always sweet either,” Sherlock said. He moved to leave. “You’ll both be hearing from me if I’ve not got water!” he called on his way out.
“Fuck, that’s good, John,” Sherlock said, dropping a hand to rest softly on John’s head. He stroked his hair lightly. “You’re so good . . .”
"You seem confident, that's a good quality," she said. "How about whoever gets the job buys dinner?"
Sherlock arrived at Scotland Yard and was locked into a small room with the evidence. It took him all day, but he found what Lestrade needed. He left feeling proud -- not because of Lestrade’s praise, but because he’d enjoyed the challenge and had met it. He spent the next day lazily -- first by sleeping much later than he’d intended to and next by helping Mrs Hudson shift the furniture around her flat. It was quite boring, but he did his best to tolerate her indecision and nitpicking.
John’s noises built Sherlock’s confidence, and he moved on John’s cock more freely, licking and sucking and using his tongue. Although it was all quite interesting, his mind was clouded by his physical urges and he found his hips rolling against the bed as he got even more turned on by what he was doing and how John was reacting. John watched Sherlock's body moving on the bed, watched his mouth and lips wrapped around his own cock, and he could hardly believe it was happening. He moaned Sherlock's name and gripped his hair. Sherlock loved John’s hand in his hair –- it felt as intimate as what he was doing to John. It all felt so good, but after a few more minutes, he lifted his head and said, “Should I keep going or should we try something else?”
