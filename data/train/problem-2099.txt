John had not grasped sarcasm yet, or maybe he had in his own way and chose to ignore Sherlock’s quips. He shook his head and pressed a finger to Sherlock’s forehead, missing the way Sherlock shivered at the contact.
John picked his plate up and carried it to the kitchen, leaving Sherlock alone at the table. It was while John was cleaning his dish that Sherlock realized John was only clad in the robe that was given to him his first night in the flat. Sherlock groaned, he had completely neglected to bestow John with proper clothing. It was not as if John was going to be outside anytime soon, he needed to learn a bit more before he was ready for the outside world.
Sherlock would have liked to. He saw the way John’s toned softened, sounding quite sad for a moment. If Sherlock had to guess, John wanted that bond of kinship between himself and their man downstairs. It disheartened Sherlock to see John’s look of want and longing, perhaps he had felt just as Sherlock has for all those years. Maybe, on some level, John was lonely.
It was his voice. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief. He was correct and John was still alive. Moriarty would have had hell to pay if John’s life had been taken. He tried to move around but his legs were also tied to the chair. Surely John was in the same predicament as well.
“The name is Thomas, Thomas Banville. I met your brother two years ago and I am fortunate to say that he was a friend to me. My heart weeps for his loss.”
It was the address to a bathhouse. He did not waste a moment and tucked the card inside of his coat and set off.
Sherlock pondered in his mind as he watched the blond sleep, mouth hung open slightly and the soft, almost quiet snores leaving his lips. His hand moved from John’s arm and rested on his face. He had done a good job, quite a good job.
“I have wanted you like this for so long now, Sherlock,” John whispered, burying his fingers in the man’s curls to bring him in for another kiss.
Thomas cocked his head. “And do you not think that Sebastian would have come into your lives had we not ‘intruded’ as you call it? I find it unlikely. Tell me, had the thought ever crossed your mind to create him? To have another like you in the world? Another abomination?”
“Now John, tell me, did you really grab the small of Sherlock’s back? This is what Banville has relayed to me.”
He blinked away the tears that were begging to be shed and resumed his mission. He found a suitable match, the dirt of the grave still fresh. The man’s name was Thomas, he died of syphilis, at only thirty years of age. Sherlock spared a few moments of silence before he began digging. While he was busy at work, a couple began walking down the street when they spotted Sherlock shoveling away the dirt. The woman stopped the man who was busy chugging his whiskey.
John only rubbed his hand with the pad of his thumb. Sherlock could admit John was good at distracting him, even when their very lives depended on the completion of Moriarty’s man. Sherlock stood up and said, “John, you understand the importance of this, we must get this done.”
“Do you know that he asked me if she would...harm him...as Moriarty did. He was terrified and I had to calm him.”
There was no reaction or response. Sherlock decided that he would not like to be called such a name. He flipped to the Shakespeare book.
“Be it as it were, what is done is done. I have forgotten about you. It is you who has chosen to spend his life obsessing over it.”
“We were attacked by another, short bugger he was, strong too. Threw us all off the man and broke my mate’s arm in the process.”
Sherlock placed his hand on the wet chest and felt the soft thumping of the heart. Sherlock closed his eyes. He could already feel the smile forming on his face. He wasn’t alone anymore, the heartbeats alone created a sense of security and comfort. Cold as his skin was, warmth radiated from him.
He rose from the bed and fetched John’s pajamas. He was careful when he slid the rest of John’s shirt off, letting it fall to the floor. He then unfolded John’s button up shirt and put it on him slowly and gently. John watched, completely smitten, as Sherlock wore a soft but straight face and changed him with the utmost care and efficiency. When he was finished, he gave John a smile. It was a small one, but in that smile held all the love and admiration that could not fit in his piercing eyes. John held his breath and found himself reduced to an ogling mess that could not help but touch Sherlock’s cheeks and marvel at the wonderful man that sat beside him.
Moriarty’s henchmen cut John and Sherlock from their bindings and moved so that the two hostages would be able to nurse their tender skin. Moriarty holstered the gun and clapped a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and said, “I shall give you two and a half months to create my man. I will personally stop off at your flat to ensure that progress is being made and at the end, that he is finished.”
deserve no place on this earth? You are made of bits and pieces of men already dead. The two of you, so proud and self-righteous that you should tell me I am the abomination?”
He unlocked the door to the building and walked up the stairs, hoping that John was in a better mood than when he left him. He felt his palms sweating as he neared his flat. He moved to knock on the door when he saw that it was already left ajar. His brows furrowed together as he stepped into the eerily silent flat. It was odd that the door was left open, but he was not in the best of moods when he stormed out of the flat, he was distraught and distracted, and John would be too upset to notice such a small thing. If John was still in a black mood, then he would probably be holed up in his room, ignoring Sherlock. Sherlock was still wary, but he cleared his throat and started to spew words of apology.
John’s smile nearly betrayed just how elated he felt. He was tempted to stretch his smile to its very limit, but decided against it. He pulled Sebastian into a hug and was worried that if he let go, Sebastian would merely fade away and leave him even more melancholic than before. He did not miss the way the man nuzzled into his neck. The only other person to do this was Sherlock, but for a reason other than Sebastian’s. When they pulled away, Sebastian looked inside of the shop and then around the area and stared at John with a frown.
Sherlock immediately regretted speaking of Sebastian. It was not so long ago that the mention or implication of him could be easily addressed. John missed him terribly, and Sherlock found himself at odds regarding his absence. He could admit that there was a wholeness to their home with Sebastian, and it was not that he was not whole with John, there was not a word to describe the level of love and friendship that Sherlock had with John. With Sebastian, however, perhaps it was at how happy John was when he was with the two of them. The very thought of seeing John happy was enough for Sherlock. He had the most dazzling of smiles. No such expression was worn on the man’s face in this instance. John sank into the chair and his eyes looked heavy and darker than normal.
John shot up and grinned. He walked over to the door and opened it to reveal Sebastian standing there with the happiest expression a face could muster. He moved to hug Sherlock, leaving said man with a shocked look, at least, that was what John believed it was. Sebastian removed himself from Sherlock’s body and said, “Sherlock, how happy it makes me to see you!”
He didn’t respond. The house would not be empty, the maids would still remain, but he knew what she meant. The best decision was not always the easiest, he wanted to tell her but he could not will himself to say another word. Consolation was never his area.
“I did not. I would not disrespect him that way. I allowed his rest to continue. However, that did not solve my issue of finding the correct...materials.”
At John’s inquiry Sebastian nodded and fiddled with his fingers again. He was still very much like a child, John thought to himself.
She stared at him for a moment, trying to get a sense of what it was like in that funny little head of his no doubt. She sniffed and held her shawl tighter to her body. With a pat on Anderson’s chest she motioned for them to leave. She helped the man walk seeing as how he was just coming off of his intoxication, and needed proper rest. Several times Anderson looked back and each time Sally directed his face forward and they bickered some more. An odd relationship, Sherlock thought, but they seemed to care for each other. He himself started his walk back to Baker Street. John would be up by now and was probably wondering where Sherlock had gone.
“Worry not, I will place you as caretaker of the house. Until I return, this house will be under your care and management. Does that suffice?”
“I have not been ‘skipping meals’ as you put it. While I have been busy at Baker Street, I have taken the precaution of feeding myself as well, I’ll have you know.”
“Freak.” Sherlock turned to see none other than Sally Donovan staring at him with the meanest scowl she could muster. She was without her...suitor? Husband? Lover?
Immediately, John dashed over to the window and threw it open. The air and rain beat harshly upon his features as soon as the window was let open. He was drenched without even stepping outside. Sherlock flew over to the body and set the rods in place.
Sherlock did not miss the way Sebastian tugged at his sleeve. He was hiding marks, it was the same thing Sherlock used to do when he was a child. Surely Moriarty would not be so barbarous as to lay hands on Sebastian.
John’s lips pulled into a small smile. No mockery, nor playfulness, in his bearing - only love. He rubbed Sherlock’s arms and then encouraged him to turn over, which Sherlock obliged. Again anxiety surged through his sore body at the thought of what was to happen. To his surprise, John only began to rinse the soap from his curls.
“John, you must understand, I’ve gone through the same process whilst creating you. Were there stages in the creation process that I have found in poor taste? Absolutely, but I do not regret it for a moment, because now, and it brings me much pleasure to say, I love your company.”
The next day, Sherlock was sitting in the living area awaiting John’s emergence from the room. They were to take a walk today, at John’s behest. Sherlock took care to wear his top hat during their outing so that no one would be able to see the marks on his face as easily. Sherlock opened his watch.
Sherlock held the wicked hand to his chest and shielded it like it had nearly been chopped off. Sherlock felt the tears welling in his eyes. He had been doing well too, had gone without tears for nearly a month. It hurt, the memory, the words - they hurt and Sherlock could not stop the tears. He slowly backed away from John.
“We were introduced to one another at Lord Henry’s grand ball some years ago. Intelligent man, he was. Spent the whole night in his company.”
Sherlock looked away and closed his eyes. It was all a dream, it had to be. He would awaken in the flat with John holding him and snoring so lightly that Sherlock had to strain to hear.  There would be no Moriarty, no danger, just a nightmare.
He hurried to the coach while trying his hardest not to run. He knew that returning would be a mistake, he knew that something would go awry. He had known that the visit would end on a sour note because he always missed something. He always got one thing wrong. He did not even look back once the carriage set off. He did notice, in his peripheral, that Mrs. Hudson did not even so much as wave as they left.
It was almost as if John felt Sherlock’s eyes on him, he turned to face him with the same smile on his face.
The ride to the location seemed longer than it actually was. All he could think of was John. Was he alright? What if they had killed him? How would he react to the sight of John’s corpse sprawled against the wet tiles of the bathhouse? Sherlock wished he had never imagined such grisly things. The carriage stopped, signalling their arrival. He rushed out of the coach and into the bathhouse. It was the one that Mycroft used to frequent when he needed to relax. He wanted Sherlock to join him on one occasion, but Sherlock turned him down and said that he did not find the thought of being trapped in a room with sweaty men his idea of a good time. Mycroft scoffed and muttered, “How would you know?” underneath his breath before he left.
Sherlock’s mother died first. She caught pneumonia, weakness growing until she became bed-ridden. The weather was harsh during her last days, whatever chance she had for recovery ruined thanks to the winter’s cold air. Sherlock didn’t remember crying when she died. He simply stared and admired how peaceful she looked. Morbid tendencies developing before he’d even realized.
“I am sorry to have brought up a rather somber thought but I only inquired to discover what you would do to occupy your time during those unfortunate months.”
John had been watching Sherlock through the window, he had to have been. How else would he have known? He might have been there since Sherlock left, awaiting his return. Sherlock did not leave the flat very often, if only to acquire a meal for the both of them. This was the longest he had been out and he expected John to become worried. He wondered how John felt now, having to carry him up the stairs, nearly getting arrested, having to fight another person - all the things he had just done for Sherlock.
You are mad, but I love every moment of it. To live with someone as extraordinary as you...it is amazing. Sherlock, you are fantastic, you are wonderful...you are brilliant. And there is nothing that would make me happier than to be with you and to bask in your brilliance. I do not know much about the world, but I do know that I love you.”
He rose from his spot on the floor and scrutinized every clue carefully. There was the open door, the broken dishes, the chair that was knocked over, the journal, and a new one - There was blood on the floor. It was not a great amount of blood, but enough to know that John, and quite possibly the assailant were injured. From what he witnessed during the skirmish, John possessed a considerable amount of strength. It was very possible that he was able to inflict bodily harm before finally being stopped. John was kidnapped and it was without a doubt Sherlock’s fault. Who was it? Was it one of his abusers come to finish the job? Maybe it was one of the children he upset from years past come to seek revenge? Why did the captor take John and not him? Why was he not taken while he walked about London? He was not aware of his surroundings, he would not even know what was coming for him. Had he not left, John would have been spared. London was crawling with vicious criminals and murderers, he prayed that John was not the next victim.
“Whatever you see fit, Sebastian.” John replied. Mrs. Hudson sighed and nodded. “The boy is free to stay, so long as I get to see you lot more often.”
Sherlock’s lips parted to take in a wet and ragged breath. The tears had spilled unbidden, every facet of Sherlock’s great mind focusing on John’s words. He knew they were truthful and even if the same doubts were to plague him again tomorrow, in this moment, Sherlock knew John really loved him. As John brushed the tears away, Sherlock could only think of one thing to do. He leaned in.
Without a word, Sherlock walked over to the right side of the bed, pulled back the covers and slid in. John looked discouraged when he saw Sherlock settle in and turned to exit the room when he heard, “Why are you leaving?”
Thomas nodded. “As you might have guessed, he is Mycroft’s younger brother. His only brother, I might add.”
“Alas, I will not violate you in such a way, brother dear. You have struggled and you now have your chance to rest, be at peace. To dig your corpse up for my selfish reasons would be a grave sin. I am sorry, Mycroft.”
John did not respond, only watched with a solemn face as Sherlock dressed himself again and left the flat.
He wanted nothing more than to shut his mind off. Always racing, always ridiculing him - tearing him apart as he lay prone under the constant barrage. He wiped at his eyes furiously although the movements tugged at his injuries and made him hiss. He had cried in front of John, why would he do such an idiotic thing?
Mycroft said that one night after Sherlock came home a bruised and bloodied mess. He had cried when Mycroft inquired about his state, and to his surprise, he was given a hug and those words were whispered into his ear as if it were a secret between the two. He took Sherlock to the kitchen and prepared him hot chocolate, and even let Sherlock sleep in the bed with him. He tried to make him feel better, but he was ill-equipped when it came to emotion. Sherlock learned later on that it was the subtle things that Mycroft did for him showed that he cared. What would he say now? That man, Anderson, attacked Sherlock because they thought he became aroused by the sight of putrid, rotting bodies. They called him a freak, someone who did not deserve respect, a person to be ostracized by everyone else simply because they were not normal. He hated the very word. It was so cruel, so vile, and to be labeled such a thing incensed Sherlock. Though anger gave way to sadness very shortly, and so there Sherlock sat, struggling to hold back the bitter tears upon realizing that nobody would think of Sherlock as anything but a freak. As a child, he learned to ignore the taunt because children are vicious to people who are different. The whole world seemed to be. Then, as the years passed, the word went from shouts to whispers. It was the thing that everyone murmured whenever Sherlock was around. The way the men bent their heads and chuckled whenever he walked into the room, or the hushed voices of the women who stared at him during social events. It did not take him long to figure out what they gossiped about. It was him; The Freak, Mycroft’s Queer Younger Brother, The Strange One, or one of the mild ones he’d been given, Him. Mycroft had tried to distract him from it by dragging him around to meet some of the more esteemed guests of the party but Sherlock only looked like the peculiar sibling that followed his brother everywhere.
By the time they finished the bath, it was already night. The fog was being a particular pain that night and so, much to Sherlock’s dismay, he was unable to view the moon while they laid together. Every so often he would let out a cough and John brought him a cup of tea while he was in bed. Sherlock thought that John enjoyed caring for Sherlock, that mother henning was something he loved to do. Even Mrs. Hudson would have felt some jealousy towards John over his caretaking skills. He hoped that she was alright. Living in that manor was lonely in itself, he could only imagine how she felt living there on her own. Sherlock shook his head, she probably did not even think about him anymore. When he left, whatever she had left of him in her heart did too.
John paced around the room stopping every few moments to glance at his watch, before resuming his pacing. Sebastian, who was now sporting a bandage around his arm, watched anxiously.
“So, then you are not in need of air. Is it your wrist? Is it bothering you? Come let me have a look. I fear I was a bit overzealous, but, what is done is done.”
“When we heard word of Powers’ death, I was certain that it was more than a mere death. I informed Mycroft of my conclusion, and though it took time for him to see reason, we traveled to Scotland Yard and swayed their minds.”
With that, he rose from his chair and moved through the flat and up the stairs faster than John could keep up. John set the dish down and rushed up the stairs behind Sherlock, who was already busy at work, sketching the body of the creature they would be creating and muttering to himself. For a moment, John only watched, he was sure that Sherlock was not even aware of his presence, he hardly ever was when he was in this state. John waited in the doorway to see if Sherlock would even turn his head in his direction, to see if maybe he would order him to fetch his tea downstairs, or even to come and review the notes they both spent sleepless nights on. No recognition came, Sherlock sat hunched over, scribbling away on the paper resting on the cot that would house the next man, the new John.
“I do not care how young he was, his intent was to kill another in cold blood and that is not right. He is very fortunate that he was not placed before a court either! Can you not see? He has you too! He cares little for you, all you are is a pawn for his utilization and nothing more. If you died today or tomorrow, he would not even shed a tear. Admit it, you know that you have wasted your life on a man who would have never thought to do the same for you. Is it truly so far-fetched that you are envious of Sherlock? He had family, has family. At the end of the day he will come back to us, and where will you go? Back to Moriarty.”
“I understand that you are hurting, but that does not give you ample reason to lash out at your caretaker. I have only known her a short while, but in that period I have witnessed the way you allow yourself to be at peace when you are near her, your eyes, they brighten to rival that of the sun whenever she presents you with a cup of tea. You are unguarded in her presence, Sherlock, and you are only ever that way when you are with me.”
Sherlock finished his treat and shoved the bag aside. He climbed onto John’s lap and began to pepper John’s neck in kisses. John stifled a moan. “You are quite active in the morning, Sherlock. However, I’m afraid that my surprise cannot wait any longer.”
“You are not a creature, John. Do not ever refer to yourself as such. You are my John, you are my saving grace, my best and only friend. You are the most kind and wise man to have ever graced my presence and I do not want you out of my life. Not now. Not ever.”
“I wonder what he would have concluded such a note with. No doubt it caused him great pain to record his thoughts down on paper, I imagine that he was quite...fragile at the time of writing this letter.”
The other children did not help him, they only laughed as he was kicked, and hit, and broken. The boys only stopped because their parents returned from their outings and there was nothing worse than being late for supper. Not a one checked to see if he was even alright. He limped home and sobbed as he told Mycroft all about it. Mycroft was still young in comparison to the middle-aged couples that littered their neighborhood, not to mention that their parents died just a few years prior. The parents of the bullies looked mortified that their child would even do something as monstrous as attack Sherlock, they told Mycroft that they would punish them immediately. Sherlock was not able to wander the streets as freely anymore.
Moriarty cocked his head as he squeezed John’s shoulders, ignoring the way he flinched each time. Sherlock traced his fingers along the back of the chair, searching for a chip in the wood. He was only granted splinters as reward.
“It doesn’t bother you?” He cursed himself for saying those words before thinking. Sherlock placed the pencil down and looked over at John.
John had only a moment to settle in when Sherlock moved back into his arms. Sherlock let out a sigh when he felt John’s strong arms wrap around his waist. His sides were sore from all of the coughing and he hoped that John did not feel the way he winced when John squeezed a bit too hard.
He made his way upstairs and found the body lying on the cold metal table and reassured the body that he would not remain that way for long.
“I have been in this condition before, John. It was prior to…. you and I meeting...the months shortly before, I was just as ill if not worse and I had no one to care for me, and yet I survived.”
“Right. I know this bloke,” He kicked the man’s limp leg, “And I know her. Troublemakers they are, I let him off with a warning last time, this time I’ll not be so kind.”
He looked like he wanted to speak, but Sherlock knew that he would not be able to. He had no grasp of language so Sherlock would not be surprised if he wasn’t understood. Sherlock set the vase down on the nightstand and inched his way over to the frightened male.
“This makes you happy, does it? The surge of excitement as each ember flickers towards you, threatening to sear your flesh.”
Sebastian stared at his feet as he shook his head. “You know that I do not like to drink. It made me...it was not a pleasant feeling, sir.”
“The only likely reason for my reaching this point would be the lightning bolt that struck dangerously near the flat as you’ve described.”
John’s smile softened, and the tension he felt was enough so that he too Sebastian’s quivering hand. “Come now, Sebastian…”
Then came the thought of how they would bring him to life. Would it be as sudden and magnificent as John’s awakening was? Would it be painful and loud? How would this man, who lay upstairs unconscious, dead,  turn out to be? The prospects frightened and excited John. He loved the adrenaline, but he could not help but dread it. This man, Moriarty, could destroy their very lives - would the provision of a companion really eradicate such threats?
Sherlock blinked twice and stared at John with a hint of confusion on his face. How long had John been talking, how long had he not been listening? Immediately, Sherlock nodded and watched as John disposed of the bits of ham and toast that Sherlock did not touch. Sherlock heard John talking once more about how little Sherlock ate, and what the normal amount of food was for him to be eating in a day. It all sounded like a jumbled mess to the distracted man who absentmindedly sipped away at his tea.
“We have not been gone from it long, yet you declare that statement as if we have not been back in years.”
Sherlock did not forget the conversation they had prior to naming Sebastian, and the revelations that had come to him. John had felt lonely, no doubt because he was the only one of his kind. That was Sherlock’s fault, he had not considered this when he was creating him. He knew what it felt like to be alone but to force John to overcome such an emotion too was a true error. He kissed John on the shoulder and felt one being returned upon his head. Just as he closed his eyes, they heard the door being opened to reveal none other than Sebastian. They both sat up and watched as the man spread his blanket on the floor, placed his pillow on top, and lay down. He stared at the both of them with those alarming blue eyes and, without uttering a word, closed his eyes and went to sleep. John and Sherlock flashed puzzled looks at one another and slowly sank back into the bed. They assumed their positions again and Sherlock whispered, “I do hope this does not become a habit.”
Sherlock laughed at John’s response. He truly cared about Sherlock. John, however, did not seem amused. Sherlock cleared his throat.
Sherlock merely shook his head and begun to fiddle with his hands. He could not tell John that he was hated by society at large. He would be angry to discover that he risked his freedom for a man that no one liked. He pushed John away softly and reached for his coat. John grabbed his hand, forcing him to release the coat, and guided it back over to his lap.
Sherlock’s eyes nearly popped from his socket. Thomas Banville was here? What business could he possibly have at the yard? He was in cahoots with Moriarty, his presence on the day of Sebastian’s departure made that evident. Was this planned all along? Banville would report Sherlock to the police, and Moriarty would get the two of them to create Sebastian knowing that their doing so would do nothing to stop their punishment? What evil, evil men! He faked a report of theft to tell the Yard of why he was really there.
A brief flash of light illuminated the room and broke through his anguish, eyes finally focusing on the dark skies of the night to identify the source of the light. He saw nothing. And then there was the loud crack of thunder whose harsh boom made Sherlock cringe. He trembled where he stood, bereft now that the madness was brought to a halt. He felt vulnerable, afraid, and, most of all, angry.
John looked down. He got his answer. Sherlock cared deeply about the new man they were creating but he choose to not dwell upon it and to forced himself to believe that he did not care. He was not cold, and as John spent more time with him he realized that Sherlock was a man who loved too much. He loved with a heart that John was sure belonged to no other in the world, even though he knew no more than three people outside of Baker Street, he was sure that Sherlock Holmes was a rare sort and it made him proud to love him, to have him wholly to himself. In no time, he was over at Sherlock’s side and rubbing gentle circles on his back. He winced each time Sherlock sniffled or let out a choked sob.
With that, Sherlock felt John’s hand detach from his own. No, no, not John too. He could not lose him too.
Sherlock grinned. Words could not express how he felt at the moment. John had drawn breath, he was alive, he was speaking! He was far from perfect, but Sherlock already forgot his feelings of anger and betrayal and the void filled with happiness and affection. For he had him now. He had his John.
“Perish the thought. I have only stepped out for a moment. It appears that I neglected to bring my novels with me and you were still asleep. A walk is an excellent cure for boredom, I should think.”
He threw his clothes on and gave John one last glance before walking out of the flat. It felt odd to be alone, especially outdoors. He had become so used to John’s presence, that he had forgotten what is was like to be by himself. He smiled at the thought, to finally be able to forget the isolation and the loneliness, it felt like heaven. How long would the feeling last? This might be the last time he could ever see John asleep in their bed, so peaceful, so soft. Then again, Sherlock did not have to do this, he did not have to leave the embrace of his love. He could have laid there with him until the coppers came storming in and arrested the both of them. No, what was he thinking? He had to do this, it would be better to keep this as discreet as they possibly could before all of England knew about it. He owed John that much.
John reached around and found the tin, opening it quickly to drag his fingers through the greasy substance inside. “I will give you more then, my love. Just be patient with me.”
“Sherlock...I’ve...well I’m not quite sure what it is, but I cannot tire of you. It is impossible for me to ever grow weary of seeing your face when in fact that is all I look forward to in the mornings.”
“Nothing, John. My mind would not allow me a moment’s rest. I chose to take a walk, seeing as how I did not want to disturb your peaceful sleep. I am sorry if I caused you any unease, John. That was not my intention.”
“How have you come to meet Sir Mycroft, Albert?” The woman who was crying at the funeral asked this.
They pressed foreheads, and later they found themselves resting their heads on the other’s shoulder, arms wrapped around the other’s waist. They were tired, but they were together and that was enough, was it not? Sherlock’s eyes watered at the thought. John’s utter devotion to him was heartwarming and motivating, but he would not take him to encounter Moriarty, he simply could not do so.
John swallowed, as Sherlock did, and gave him the biggest smile that he was capable of. Sherlock sat back in his chair and laughed.
John quirked a brow in response, “I do not believe I am capable of stopping. You are a fascinating man, Sherlock. I may not have powers of observation such as you do but that does not mean I do not find wonder in observing you.”
“John, hush. You are not the cause of my exhaustion, I adopted this nasty habit years ago, before our meeting.”
“You will remain here while I tend to Sherlock.” John spoke as if he were a teacher instructing a student. John doubted their spoken words were being understood. If he had to venture a guess as to why things were going fairly well now, he would say the demeanour of him and Sherlock were facilitating enough calmness for the man to feel the same or at the very least, safe.
“We therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched and he set the food down once again. His hands steepled under his chin, a frequent pose.
“I’m afraid the food has gone cold. When I woke you had already gone and I had no knowledge as to where you went.”
He slid on his slippers, tied his robe tightly about his thin waist, and descended the stairs. Upon his arrival, one of the maids nearly dropped the newly-folded laundry at the sight of him, her mouth hung open as she stayed rooted to the spot. Sherlock met her gaze, his sullen countenance from watching his brother’s coffin lower into the ground unmoved by her shock. He shoved his hands into his pockets and walked towards the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson came out of the room, wiping her hands on her apron. She had been cooking a meal for him already. Sherlock felt a twinge of his heart, she was going to force him to eat with a mother’s stubbornness no doubt. She returned from her sister’s home the previous day, the maids informing her of their master’s situation. There was a reason Mycroft kept her around after so many years.
“I should think that it will not be completed in less than a fortnight, as well. We will sleep and continue our work in the morning.”
John’s eyes flickered over to Sherlock’s. He wanted Sherlock’s approval, he wanted to be able to agree with the statement, or was he to pleading? Did he want for Sherlock to divert Moriarty’s attention? The lack of silence confirmed the man’s suspicions.
“See? That’s me,” Sherlock pointed to himself, “And that’s you.” He pointed to him. He looked confused, and mimicked Sherlock’s pointing. Sherlock nodded and did it again. Sherlock stopped the tap and helped his creature inside. He seemed reluctant at first and reached for Sherlock’s hand, but with encouragement, and Sherlock’s soft voice, he sat down in the water and waded his hand through it, even raising some to his lips and drinking. Sherlock was gentle as he cleaned him. He scrubbed the soap along his back, and attempted to clean the stitches, as well as the rest of his body. He stopped when it came to the front of his creation’s body. He taught him how to scrub, and when Sherlock felt that he had the gist of it, he let him finish cleaning himself. When he was done and came out, Sherlock cleaned his cut as well.
“You’re not getting it! The man’s a freak, gets off on the sight of corpses! He’s a sick bloke who deserved the thrashing me and my mates gave him. If you ask me I think the Inspector should commend us for ridding the world of one more freak.”
Sherlock felt disappointment at the reply. Why would he be disappointed? He wanted John to say that, as much as he wished that John would desire something else.
“You must close your eyes,” John shut his eyes and Sherlock saw that Sebastian mimicked him. Incredible. “And after you must wait for your body to become heavy and drown out all other noise,” He instructed, settling his arms at his sides and relaxing his body as best he could.
He truly was the only one that would care if Sherlock died. He would never be able to move on with the pain. He could try to find a solution to his grief but he would always find his way back to that cold, dark, lonely living area played with thoughts about what once was. He could never put John through such turmoil, his love for him surpassing any desire to cause him pain. He wanted John to live a life of pure bliss and eternal happiness but he knew better. He knew that even the most content of people had to struggle. Sherlock could hardly stand to think of John’s reaction to hearing the news of Sherlock’s death. Maybe he would be caught in an unfortunate incident of a carriage that lost control, a freak accident, a fire, or the way he had planned during his adolescent years, suicide. It hurt to picture that, the way John’s knees would buckle, his eyes would water, obstructing his view of the letter stating the cause of death. He would try to be strong in the eyes of the postman, but behind closed doors he would cry and cry and spend every waking moment wishing that it was all an endless nightmare, and that he would awake to find his arms wrapped around the very person he ached for.
“John! If you are choosing to ignore me, then I have no right to stop you, but know that I am terribly sorry for my poor reaction to our...whatever you deem it.”
“Your waking was unexpected, as I have told you previously. I’ve no idea as to how we would rouse him from his dormant state.”
John moved out of the way and let him walk in. “You may take your seat on Sherlock’s bed.” Sebastian slumped down onto the bed and fiddled with his thumbs. John was no idiot like him, he knew when something was wrong.
Moriarty paused and looked down at John’s shoulder. His dark brows furrowed and he squeezed the shoulder once more. Sherlock winced at the sight of John trying to hold in the pain caused by Moriarty’s agitation of the wound.
“Do you think you are able to recite it for us?” John asked, tapping the man’s chest again and repeating the name, “You are Sebastian.” He looked at the creature expectantly.
He refused to acknowledge the small smile on the Detective Inspector’s face as he walked away. Sherlock opened the door and stepped inside the building, shutting the door behind him. John had not not waited for him as he usually did, instead having gone inside the flat already. When Sherlock finally made his way up the stairs, he found John sitting in the armchair, his head was propped upon his arm and his body slumped as if it were too heavy for him to support. He looked annoyed, angry, crestfallen. Sherlock went to take his coat off and hung it up. John did not even utter a word. He sat down in the chair opposite John’s and stared at him. He did not know how much time had passed until he heard his companion’s voice.
That hurt him. Sherlock saw the way he shrank in the reflection. Why must he be so cruel to everyone he loves?
The few days that passed after their return home were mostly spent sleeping and resting in quiet. What happened in Switzerland, though the outcome had been a miracle, left them tired and utterly thankful that they both were alive and together. Perhaps Moriarty deserved death for all that he had done, but to witness it, to play a role in causing it, inevitably had an effect on one’s person. In comparison then, the valiant death of Sir Banville was even harder to process.
John walked over to the empty side of the bed and gently nudged Sherlock so that he would have sufficient room to fit. It was only noon, but John had little else to do and if Sherlock’s whining showed him anything, it was that the man was lonely.  Up in the room all day while stewing in your own filth with not a soul to talk to would evoke such an emotion. John did not want Sherlock to feel that way, not anymore, not while he was still around. As expected, Sherlock nestled himself into John’s chest. He could feel the heat exude from his sick lover and wrapped his arms tighter around him. He was shivering. John hoped that it would get worse before it got better, he could not bear it if Sherlock perished from an illness that was avoidable. He was not sure if Sherlock was actually sleeping, or merely resting his eyes.
“An idea that had only just come to me, in fact. I’ve always fancied traveling to Switzerland. The sun shines twice as brightly there than here in gloomy England and the grass is green and lovely. You would have the most splendid of times John. We can be away from this place for a short time. Just imagine how happy that would make us.”
Sherlock was crying now, and with each tear that fell, he despised himself even more. He resolved to light a candle, he would rather not cry alone in the dark. With a sniffle, he lit the candle, only to find a man staring directly at him. Sherlock let out a shout and fell off his bed. He heard the man’s footsteps approaching. Oh what a way to die! He would be murdered by a common thug in his bedroom. What would the thief say to his cohorts, “I killed a man while he sobbed in his bed!”
“It is fine, Sherlock. I was lulled by the warmth of the fire and the splendid quiet of the flat. You have roused me from my impending slumber.”
Sherlock paused to hide his grin at John calling Sherlock that term of endearment. It was not the first time he had used it, but it was just a feeling Sherlock could not get used to.
“Boys, please escort Mr. Watson to the carriage. By force or without, it matters little to me, only take care to not kill him.”
Sherlock scoured his room to find another object to throw until he got a good look at the person he was attacking. The man was short, Sherlock noticed even in the poor light. He also saw that the culprit had no clothes on, as well as scars that closely resembled the ones that he’d sewn on his…
John stared at Sherlock. He knew that John hadn’t a clue what he was saying, but he had to get the point across. He couldn’t bear it if John got hurt due to his negligence. Sherlock sighed and held out his hand to John. John seemed hesitant at first, but he placed his hand in Sherlock’s. Sherlock wrapped his long fingers around it and guided towards the blaze. Sherlock watched as John’s eyes widened, he felt the heat no doubt. Immediately, John attempted to free himself of Sherlock’s grasp, he did not like the fire, he learned his lesson. Sherlock released him, and noted the way John held his own hand as if it were severed from his body. Sherlock took both John’s hands and said, “Fire burns.” In as soft a tone as he could muster.
The funeral ended shortly after the coffin was buried, and all the guests made their way to the church where the wake was previously held. Sherlock took his seat on the second pew from the front. He stared at nothing while the other guests stood three rows behind him and chattered away as if they were at a banquet and not a funeral. Sherlock shivered from the rain that had him completely drenched. He made no move to stand in leave.
“You misunderstand! What if the charge has been safely conducted into the body but we have yet to complete our task of reviving him?”
John saved him. He rushed to his aid, clad in nothing more than a robe, and saved Sherlock from his attackers. What did he do to deserve such a wonderful person like John? He created him, yes, but he did not think that his creation would turn into such an honourable man. Sherlock sighed and grasped the box tighter to his side. It was bent at the edges, and covered in the mud that it was dropped in. He let out a sigh, he was eternally grateful that they had not gotten to the box. They would have opened it, and they would have destroyed it. John would have been crushed.
Sherlock looked away from those kind eyes. There was no way he could possibly explain, why wouldn’t John leave him be?
He had no experience with this whatsoever but John was a smart man. He shifted to situate himself between Sherlock’s legs to allow the man to spread his legs wide apart. John reached down in between them, fingers brushing past his erection and scrotum, down the line of his perineum, to rest at the pucker of his arse. His heart was racing and his body was tense with anticipation. He was not even sure how such a small space could accommodate John’s fairly large size but Sherlock was making no objections. In fact-
If she had anything else to say, she decided to keep it to herself. She detached his hand and left the room.
It was safe to say that Sherlock and John were not ready for the severity of the storm. It began slow at first, to the point where it nearly rendered Sherlock hopeless. He thought he had misjudged the weather, that it was nothing more than the normal bout of London rain. Then John noticed, nearly an hour later, that the rain became louder as it fell, and the droplets were larger. Sherlock knew that rain from before, the same rain that fell the night John came to life, and not more than thirty minutes later they heard the boom of thunder that signaled how far the storm was. Sherlock had been counting the seconds in his head each time the thunder clapped, waiting for the lightning
The hours that came after the kiss seemed like an eternity to Sherlock. He tried to busy himself by conducting countless experiments, all of which took a little over two hours, he paced around the house, he did not wish to venture outside for the remainder of the day. He cooked for the both of them with meat he had acquired some days ago. It was a simple roast. A recipe that Mrs. Hudson had taught him years prior. Every so often he would halt his whirlwind around the flat to stare at John, who sat in front of the fire, so calm he looked, so content. He would not bother Sherlock or attempt to ask him what was the matter, just wearing a small smile on his face. Sherlock longed to join him - sit in the empty spot next to John. What would he say? What would they talk about? The assault or the kiss? Sherlock would prefer to speak of the kiss that he had loved and he wanted nothing more than for John to shower him in thousands more, but then again the thought of those kisses terrified him.
“It has everything to do with you. Had you not gone off and told Moriarty about us, we would have been able to live as we see fit, and Moriarty would have never intruded upon our lives.”
Moriarty ripped the sleeve further in order to examine John’s arm. There it was as clear as day. John’s sutures, his ghastly, messy, black sutures that held his mismatched limbs together. Ones that Sherlock couldn’t remove and would likely be adorned by John for years. Moriarty’s eyes widened and a wicked smile spread across his face. The sadist, the monster.
At the mention of John’s name, Sherlock began to feel rather lonely at the thought of sitting at this grand table alone for breakfast.
Sherlock crawled under the bed and stood up on the side. He picked up a glass that was resting on the nightstand next to his bed and threw it at the stranger.
John’s confidence grew in bathing Sherlock with his attentions. He would lean in for small kisses during the day, outstretch his foot to press along Sherlock’s as they read in comfortable silence, brush his curls back when an errant one fell across the man’s forehead. Without the worry and the fear, there was nothing holding back John’s arousal, and for the first time it seemed that Sherlock was not working to withhold his any longer either.
John smirked. He truly believed that. If he did, then that meant that Sherlock would have to as well.
As if surprised, Sherlock could only stare at John as the man spoke so openly of things Sherlock had never heard before said about him. If Sherlock had heard this between any other couple, he would have waved his hand in annoyance and disgust at such sentimental poetry, but now he was frozen in awe. He could feel his cheeks warming further, heart beating faster in his chest.
They were born into nobility. The Holmes name was respected by the other members of England’s high society. Sherlock remembered how frustrated he became when their mother would stop and chat with a duke’s wife, or a lord’s fiance. So loved was she, that her funeral was attended by half of London’s upper-class. Their father was a kind man, if not distant at times. His parents loved each other, from what could be gathered through Mycroft’s accounts of their relationship. Few marriages between nobles were ever borne out of love.
Sherlock braced himself for the words he knew that were coming. He did not want John to go, but he did not want him to suffer as he did. John was everything they expected a man to be out there. The world would love him.
Moriarty was going to Switzerland? Why there of all places? Did he need a quiet spot to groom Sebastian to be the killer that he wanted him to be?
John smiled and kissed him hard first, but then they became progressively lighter until they stopped altogether. “There is no Watson without Holmes.”
“John!” Sherlock shouted suddenly. The sound of a whistle was heard and another stranger, a policeman this time, came and broke up the fight between John and the aggressors. John had a face like thunder, and tried to free himself from the policeman’s grasp.
“You are correct in this, Mr. Watson and I hate you for it. I am pathetic, and I deserve no better than Moriarty. I would very much like to kill you, to kill Moriarty, but I am nothing more than a coward who does his beck and call. I cannot stand the sight of...of this...creature!” He points to Sebastian who retreats behind John. “I cannot bear to look into your eyes. So blue and so melancholic. I know that not a day goes by where you do not think about these two and it makes me furious. Why should someone so unnatural, so...freakish, be bestowed with those who care for him? Why am I doomed to be little more than a henchman? Is it fair? I should think not.”
“You did not use your brother as the subject?” John seemed to relax a fraction while listening to Sherlock’s tragic tale. Would he forgive him after? That was all Sherlock wanted from John - forgiveness and love. If John desired to make love to him, then Sherlock would not shy away from him this time.
“J-John. Please. I need- I need more,” Sherlock looked down at his lover through hooded eyes, lips parted, cheeks red, and head of curls in disarray-  already looking debauched.
“When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase, every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms….”
Sherlock almost didn’t want to tell him of his sore body for he did not want to risk John’s arms to leaving him.
John knelt down in front of the chair and brought careful fingers up to Sherlock’s face to access the wounds. Sherlock found this peculiar, did John think to tend to Sherlock on his own?
. Mycroft gifted him with the sheet when Sherlock first began to play the violin. As he expected, he mastered the instrument just under a year. It was on his twelfth birthday that Mycroft bought it for him.
“Sebastian?” John was the one to ask, carefully putting his hand to the creature’s chest. Sherlock was not sure if it was John’s utterance of the name or if he truly did like the sound of it, but the creature’s mouth formed something akin to a smile, and then he nodded. This caused John to form a smile of his own and look to Sherlock, hoping that he was somehow enjoying this. Sherlock closed the book and looked at their creation with a smirk on his face.
They arrived in Switzerland towards the afternoon and went straight to their room. Thankfully Sherlock was able to get them a room with two single beds on either side of the room. They spent the remainder of the day getting settled in and by the time they were finished, the two were exhausted from the length of journey and from unpacking. John sank into the bed with his shirt half undone. He wanted to fall asleep entirely but Sherlock had not yet returned with dinner and he did not want to sleep on an empty stomach. Just as he moved to take his shirt off completely, Sherlock opened the door and closed it swiftly as he saw John’s bare chest.
When Sherlock returned to the moment, he ignored John’s inquiry of his well being and darted to the window, bringing it closed with a bang.
“I’ve not a clue as to how we should proceed in the manor, therefore I think it best that we carry out your idea.”
Sherlock scoured his mind to search for a rebuttal, any rebuttal at all would suffice. Upon realizing that he would not be able to find anything, he simply shut his eyes and permitted the tears to flow once more. He did not need vision to see John’s frown. He could feel it, and he was not sure if it was brought on by disgust for Sherlock’s lack of self-control, or pity for the grieving little brother. Sherlock hoped that it was the latter. While he did not approve of anyone pitying him, the thought of John finding his tears, his emotion, his pain disgusting would be too much to bear at the moment. He was granted his answer when he felt John’s pull and then the familiar warmth of his embrace.
The innkeeper smiled at John as he walked out. The first thing that took John by surprise was the sunshine beaming down on him. London did not have this much sunlight, when the sun shone at all. There were greens and yellows so vibrant, John could hardly believe it. Perhaps Sherlock was right - they had needed this holiday, if it was truly a holiday and nothing more. John put his hand in his pockets. What underlying motive could Sherlock have for bringing them here? What business did Sherlock have in Switzerland of all places? If only they would have taken holiday in France, where they could at least be public with their love with no incident.
John gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze and they lay together in the bed saying nothing. John focused his attention on Sebastian, whereas Sherlock kissed every inch of John’s upper-body as a reminder that they had made it.
“You’ll forgive me then for being concerned about your coughing fit, and there is also the fact that your sick was bile and nothing more.”
Said person jumped at the mention of his name. His eyes met Thomas’ with bewilderment. Thomas plastered a polite smile on his face and took his seat in the vacant chair in front of the desk. Lestrade seemed wary of Thomas, but decided to question him professionally and accordingly. Setting the papers aside, the Inspector folded his hands and patiently waited for Thomas to state his business.
“We saw this bloke few months ago who looked a bit suspicious if you ask me. Messing about in the graveyard, looked like he had something with him. I told Anderson, but we didn’t bother much with him. Come yesterday we see him strolling about as brazen as he pleases, so Anderson and the lads gather ‘round him and knock his head in. We were thrown in here for the night.”
The ride to the falls was silent. John sat next to Sebastian and wrung his hands together as he thought about Sherlock being alone with Moriarty. He was angry, scared, and worried out of his mind when he thought about the love of his life. How could he fool John so? He used the only other person to have John’s heart to distract him. John turned to look at Sebastian who looked near tears. His hands clutched at the velvet of the seat, white and shaking. John frowned, Sebastian looked terrified. He waited a moment before the man spoke.
He looked down at his arm and grimaced at the burn he felt. Moriarty extinguished his cigarette on his arm as punishment for not releasing information regarding his whereabouts. He thought they would not be back until tonight, at the very least he would be able to see John and Sherlock once more without fear of being caught. He remembered the day after he was taken, Thomas and Moriarty seated in the carriage discussing Switzerland. He was finished with his business in London, Sherlock no doubt being such business, and he was ready to begin anew until something else caught his attention. Thomas sat there and listened with a solemn face and nodded once an inquiry was thrown his way. Thomas had not been the same since they left Baker Street with Sebastian. After his encounter with Sherlock, it changed him, made him more quiet. Sebastian did not care for Thomas.
At that moment, Moriarty himself walked into the room, eyes black and piercing, mouth curved into a smirk that made Sherlock cringe. What was he going to do to them? Why did he do this to them in the first place?
