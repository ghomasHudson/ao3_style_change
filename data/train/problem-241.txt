"Pettiness never dies, John," Janine said. She looked at Sherlock, gave him an oddly rueful little smile. "But Sherl here helped me get a bit of revenge. So it was worth it."
Sherlock cleared his throat, craned his neck to peer down the aisle. The crowd murmured and rustled as the guests got to their feet.
"And for that, he had to die," John said. He thought of the messages he'd exchanged with Olivia St Clair, the bleak despair in her correspondence. He wondered if the news of Pete's arrest would bring her peace or further anguish.
There was nothing more that could be done. Sherlock's fate would be decided when he reached the supposed safe house (or succumbed to his injuries, or was captured or otherwise intercepted along the way, or or or—) and no action that John took from this point out would make a difference.
Was that how it was going to be, from now on? Him, jumping at shadows, hoping against hope that Sherlock would simply blunder into his path one day? Was he really that much of a coward?
He knew very well what it meant in that context. He thought of the dirt and dried blood on the man's face the first time they'd spoken. Thought of the stiff movements and the pained voice.
One evening, while standing over a corpse that had been discovered in a skip (technically, while standing over Sherlock who was crouched examining said corpse), John had glanced down at his phone and positively howled with laughter.
Well. He wasn't terribly keen on socialising outside of dance class, that was all. And Pete's sad, sympathetic gaze still weighed heavily on his mind.
"You should return to Baker Street," he said, finally. "There is a security team in place there. It would be foolish for anyone to make further attempts on your life. James Moriarty is many things, but foolish is not one of them." He shifted in his seat, looked away from John, his expression pinched. "And it will be easier for me to reach you there. With updates."
"I mean—no. That's not what I meant. I've done loads of weddings. Every day. Sometimes three or four. Yesterday I did ten."
"I made a vow," Sherlock hissed, abandoning his efforts at the door and whirling around to face his brother. He was surprised at his own vehemence, at the depth of the anger that came bubbling up.
"What are you all doing here?" He looks to Mrs Hudson first, but she ducks her head and avoids his eye.
He shifted slightly so he could look past Sherlock into the sitting room, at the morning sunlight filtering in through the windows and slanting across the scuffed floorboards. Thought of Rosie there, comfortable and happy in the best home he'd ever known.
His fault. All his fault. He'd taken her away, he'd isolated her. First he'd abandoned her, then he'd whisked her away from everything she'd ever known.
He went back to the window, looked out at the rain. The sky lightened. Traffic grew heavier. Pedestrians bustled by down below, hunched under umbrellas, leaning against the wind.
John stood on the little stone step, his hands fisted at his sides, his grey hair windblown and disheveled. It was a cold, damp day, and the rain lashed against the treetops.
His fingers traced gentle, absent circles on the skin of John's neck, carefully skimming over the bruise left by Arthur Bell's needle. John shivered.
She was wearing a ghastly green jumper with a red reindeer on it. The reindeer had tiny bells on its stitched antlers that jingled when she walked. It had been making patients smile all day.
John smiled politely, leaned against the counter in her cramped little kitchen. Watched as she added another healthy splash of liquor, almost certainly more than the recipe called for.
He'd misjudged. Badly. He'd wasted time, angling for the perfect moment to approach John. He should have followed him immediately, confrontation be damned. He'd wasted time, and now John was—
"He was then dragged a short distance over rough terrain. The murderer was strong enough to lift the body over the lip of the well and push it over. Coroner's report showed contusions and fractures consistent with a fall from that height. Believed to be sustained post-mortem." He studied John's expression for a moment, rolled his eyes. "Hacked into the police department website last night."
He nodded, looked down at his mug, watched the ripples in the surface of his tea. He did not trust himself to speak.
It is a doomed endeavour. Sherlock can see it at once. Both John and his daughter have slept poorly, have
Sherlock blinked at him. Rainwater dripped down his nose. He slowly slipped his phone back into his coat pocket.
The wall had been—the wall had been unblemished. Smooth, unbroken wallpaper. Bold print. No smiley face, no bullet holes. No stains, no damage. A long stretch of paper over the comfortable drab sofa. The way it had looked when he'd first moved in. Before—
He thinks of Sherlock in his coffin, too pale and too still, almost unrecognisable in his stillness. Sherlock, sprawled on the ground outside of Barts Hospital, the place where they'd first met. Sherlock's blood on the ground.
He wanted to be the sort of man who could flirt, who could exchange witty banter with a lovely woman. He'd been that man once. Mary seemed to bring it out in him. With a little effort, he thought, he could be that man again.
"Mr Holmes," the florist said. She sounded like she'd meant to scold, but had pulled back at the last moment. The result was a bit strangled.
"He wrote home," Bell said. "Only a few letters, but it was enough. It meant something to our parents. To hear from him."
"All right," Lestrade said. He held up a placating hand. "All right, you're probably right. But I've got to consider all angles. It's my job. You know that. You
"Last time someone told me to take off all my clothes in the backseat of a car, I had a lot more fun," he said, hoping to lighten the mood.
He forced himself away from the wall, went through the door into the flat. The air was quiet, heavy. No music, no laughter, no droning telly. The sitting room was empty.
Sherlock barked out a sceptical, scoffing laugh at that, just as Rosie made a similar sound. He looked at her. She looked back. There was a surprised sort of smile playing at the corner of her mouth.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment, swaying unsteadily on his feet. There was an expression on his face that John could not quite decipher.
He felt badly. Mrs Hudson had had a good deal to be concerned about, in her lifetime. Too much, really. And she always took it in stride.
He listens to it, a jaunty tone punctuated by the harsh rasp of his breaths. Molly retreats from his side, crosses the room. She picks up the phone.
She bit her lip, looked down at the ground for a moment before meeting his gaze. "Did I—have I upset you?"
Accidents. The deaths had all looked like accidents. The wrong flowers, the wrong cake, a drunken tumble down the church stairs. And one nervous man on horseback.
She took a step forward, jabbing the gun in his direction. Behind her, John's office door splintered inward with a clattering crash as if kicked. Smallwood's hand jerked in surprise and she fired, a round burying itself in the wall.
"—and I'm sure he'd love to have you go back to his hotel and. Um. Not look at samples of animal excrement."
"She actually texted him, yes. Could be either an Innocent misunderstanding or relationship-ending gaffe, the ball was entirely in her court."
"You know, I felt sorry for you," Pete said, looking at John. "I understand heartbreak. I understand loss. I know that it can be—unimaginable. To stand silently by while the love of your life prepares to marry another."
Mrs Hudson's Aston Martin, with its gleaming paint and butter-soft leather seats, had only added to the surreal quality of his evening.
There was a tingling heaviness in John's limbs. He didn't want another drink either, he decided. He wanted to stay right where he was, suspended, uninterrupted, forever.
"Oh," he said, or perhaps only thought. It was difficult to tell, what with John mouthing along his jawline.
John was on the sofa, newspaper open in front of him. He was not reading it. His attention had been caught by Rosie, who was sprawled on the floor in front of the coffee table, assembling an impressive pileup of toy cars.
Sherlock grimaced, turned away. He was missing something. Something important. Something that could explain all of this, if he could only concentrate—
"She changed her mind so quickly," John says. He cannot seem to move past this. "One glimpse of a face from the past and just—just like that. She gave everything up."
Sherlock was crouched over him, warm palm cupping his cheek, the tips of his long fingers just barely brushing against the hair at his temple. His other hand was up against John's neck, a light pressure, measuring his pulse.
Sherlock looks down at the table. It is new. The old table was blown to bits by his sister's grenade. This surface is clean, unscuffed. There are no bloodstains, no chemical burns. John wipes it down in the mornings and evenings, after they eat.
And he'd gone off into the night, had gone home to Baker Street. John had been there, John with his questions and his concern and if John knew
out loud, believing his tone would be sufficient to get the message across. "We are here, together. Your—our—daughter has embarked on a path of her own choosing in a field in which she will surely excel. You and I have weathered tragedy, loss, and innumerable hardships, and yet
She'd meant no ill will by the comment, but it had irritated him regardless, and he'd found himself suddenly quite eager to leave, relieved that he would only have to pass one more night until his scheduled departure.
He looked up at the ceiling, studied the light fixtures. Nothing seemed out of place. Being crushed by chandelier would be overly theatrical, he decided. And worryingly imprecise. There'd been very little risk of collateral damage in the other cases, with the exception of the very first.
"I've got plans," John said, with what he hoped was an appropriate tone of regret. No one pushed him for details, so he assumed he'd either been convincing enough or they were secretly relieved not to have him along.
"You were talking," Wiggins said, watching him warily from the doorway. "Thought you were talking to me."
She made it to seven (well, six and a half) before she fumbled her phone out of her pocket and dialed his number.
Sherlock wanted to smooth those strands back, wanted to take John's face in his hands and whisper nonsense until he smiled again. He also quite wanted to throw something, wanted to hear the satisfying crash of ceramic against the wall. He wanted to shout, he wanted to fling himself onto the sofa and stare at the worn leather cushions until John went away. He wanted to think of the cruelest, most cutting thing he could possibly say in order to ensure that John
"I can't imagine he came to that conclusion on his own." Mycroft fixed him with a probing, questioning stare.
"Shh," he said. He turned the knob and nudged the door open with his hip, bringing one hand up to cup Rosie's face and shield her line of sight from anything untoward.
He looks to his left. There is a bottle of scotch, unopened, liquid gleaming unassumingly in the weak light from the monitor.
"Look," John said, quiet. He set a hesitant hand on top of Sherlock's, surprised by the warm flush of his skin. He'd been expecting his hand to be cold. "I don't know why we—why this is—" he stopped, looked up.
The déjà vu was dizzying. Sherlock had blinked, swallowed, gripped the doorframe. Reminded himself that it was real, that it had happened, that he had not simply lost himself in his head while John tended to Rosie.
He scrolled hastily through her posts. His heartbeat thudded in his ears. His suit felt too hot, his collar too tight. Sweat trickled down his back, between his shoulder blades.
"It's not that I don't think about Mary," he says, finally. "And what happened there. It's just—I wasn't there, Sherlock. When she—" he smiles again, a hard thing, lips drawing tight against teeth. "That whole night. Everything. It was all a blur. There was a gunshot, and then I was running, and then she was—she was—what I'm trying to say is that it could have been
John got to his feet, joined him where he'd stopped by the window, looking out over Baker Street. Put one hand on his arm.
"You weren't using it," Sherlock said, and stepped on the gas. The car leapt forward, then floundered, wheels spinning uselessly, failing to gain traction on the snow-slick path. The engine whined.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Look at it. It's a chef's knife. An expensive one, at that. No one would carry that around for a bit of housebreaking."
"You did it for me, Sherlock," John said, his face hot, his eyes prickling. He took a deep breath. "All of this. You did it for me, and it was real. I think I can manage to pull myself together long enough to do the same for you, yeah?"
He spends time choosing his words. He is careful about it. He uses his own laptop, of course, not the strange half-finished monstrosity that Sherlock left for him.
Photos of Sherlock, mostly. Shot from far enough away that he doubted the man had been aware they were being taken at all. He was draped in a white bedsheet and seemingly nothing else, standing tall and bored and unamused on the pavement outside, pedestrians streaming all around.
He showered, dressed, went out into the sitting room. Considered his violin, dismissed the idea. Sat in his chair instead, closed his eyes, thought about the cottage.
He turned. Sherlock stood just in the doorway, watching him with pensive eyes. The expression on his face was closed-off, unreadable.
"Ah. So this case is going to have you acting like an arsehole to a bunch of strangers." He smiled tightly, looked back at the wall. "Business as usual, then, yeah?"
And still walking towards Sherlock as though utterly unconcerned by the fact that his pregnant wife has somehow flown away without him.
"Thank you," John said, shifting slightly to face him. His voice had gone serious again, rather unexpectedly. He met Sherlock's gaze, held it, nodded once.
John swallowed, looked around the room. At some point in the wee hours of the morning, Sherlock had tidied, had straightened the piles of papers, had swept away the cigarette butts by the window.
Sherlock talks right over him. He is on a roll now, and is not able to bear the thought of being derailed. "You've even said it yourself, just now. You believe that I'm simply accommodating you. You intervene when your daughter approaches me, not because you wish to keep her away but because you fear that I'll view her as an inconvenience and that each infraction brings us closer to the point of no return, that moment when I speak out loud what you've been thinking all along, that it's
Sherlock brushed past him in the narrow aisle, heading towards a table groaning under the weight of several crates of records.
"I—" Mycroft sounded flabbergasted, stunned, at a loss for words. "His brain was badly damaged, of course. From the gunshot."
Sherlock made a noise in the back of his throat, a desperate choked sound, and sagged forward as if conceding defeat. One of his hands came up against John's face, fingers splaying across his cheek. His other hand scrabbled at the back of John's coat, tangling in the fabric.
"Sorry," the attendant said, as Molly carefully ended her call and slipped her own phone back into her lab coat. "That shouldn't—"
"Something wrong?" Sherlock asks, his voice all innocence. It is vicious, John thinks. He hadn't expected—but he
"I think—" Sherlock's voice was sharp. He cut himself off, pressed his lips together in a thin line. When he spoke again, he was quieter. "I think that if you have any favours remaining, anyone you might call to keep her for the next few nights, you should do so. It may be best not to have her close. In case."
John rocked where he sat, building momentum, the heavy chair wobbling on wooden legs. The floor creaked and swayed beneath him.
"No," John said. He laughed, once, a miserable sharp little sound. "You definitely should not be thanking me."
Sherlock is in front of him, crouched down, a hesitant hand hovering at his shoulder. John startles a bit. He did not hear him stand up.
He thought of Sherlock as he'd been when they first met. Brilliant and aloof and strange. Almost otherworldly. He'd been captivating and charming and John had liked him immediately, but he certainly hadn't seemed the sort of man to say things like
Sherlock groaned. Gravity had lost all meaning. He stumbled forward, knocking into John, chasing the taste of his mouth, the solid press of his hands, the rapid drumbeat of his heart. His hands slipped around John's waist of their own volition, clutched at his wrinkled shirt, dragged it up and out of the back of his trousers. John shivered at the brush of Sherlock's fingertips against the bare skin at his lower back.
Mary's persistent questions. He hadn't answered her. He'd ignored the issue and he'd ignored her until they'd both gone away.
"What? Oh, yeah," John says. He follows Sherlock's gaze to where he has parked his Ram. It is a very nice truck. He'd purchased it right off the lot with his first paycheck. There will be no more frantic maintenance, no more losing battles against creeping rust. He keeps it garaged at the condo he shares with Mary. Its paint is pristine, sparkling. It has never met hail.
"Precisely. She'd booked a class at Pete's studio. Apparently her fiancé found the idea disagreeable and insisted she cancel, so she did."
"Not the vow," Sherlock said evenly. He took a breath, thought about the air cycling through his lungs. John was still very close, his own breathing still unsteady. "Love."
Sherlock looked down at the bow clutched in his right hand, the neck of the instrument still gripped tightly in his left. The strings had bit into his palm. He leaned over, set them both carefully on the desk. Turned back.
"I'm given to understand that there are certain—conventions—when it comes to making those kinds of statements."
He laughed, little more than a gust of breath pushed out through his teeth. Clenched his hand, released it, let his fingers worry at a loose thread in his shirt cuff. Something fluttered in his chest, something that felt uncomfortably like relief.
The wool was brighter than he remembered, untouched by years of London grime and rain and blood. It smelled new, unfamiliar. It would need to be broken in, a bit, so that it fell just so.
This might not have been so terrible, had she not also set her profile photo to a picture of Sherlock, circa age twelve, frowning thunderously at the camera. A large swath of his hair was missing, just over his right eye.
John shrugged. He was warm, and comfortable, and pleasantly tired. He looked at the fire. There was a strange melancholy twisting in his chest.
Sherlock had been flustered and rumpled, furious as a wet cat, and his gaze had caught John's from across the room. He'd frowned thunderously, as if expecting John to chastise him.
The first thing he spies is the barn, large and grey and weathered. It is closer than he expects. He had failed to notice it in the darkness the night before. There is a large, shaggy dog standing a few paces away, staring him down. He takes a step forward and it begins to bark.
And if he is able to find such a woman, he will let John go. He will not fight it. He will let John go, and hope only to lay claim to the scraps that remain. He vows it, to himself, there at the kitchen table with the burnt toast scent hanging in the air and his unfinished mug of tea (lukewarm now) cradled against his palms. He will let John go, because that is what John needs.
He went up the steps, picked the lock and let himself in, leaned his back against the door and breathed in the stale, musty hallway air.
His face burned with shame. He leaned on his cane, breathed hard. After a moment he straightened up, scanned the oncoming traffic for taxis, eager to put as much distance between himself and his foolishness as possible.
"Mm," Sherlock tipped his head to the side, leaning more fully into John's hand. "No need. I estimate she'll figure out within the hour that Janine was in on the whole scheme and then she'll be back up to shout at me."
"An unappealing way to pass the time, I'll grant you," Sherlock had said. "If you recall, I elected to decline that invitation."
John set the card back on the table, sat down on the bed. He brought his right hand up to his left shoulder, squeezed. Thought again of Sherlock, who so liked to let those around him believe him heartless, who in actuality was anything but.
It means something, his choice of words. Perhaps there had been something wrong with her face after all.
"That is what you're here as, yes?" Sherlock peered at him, eyes pale and focused, no warmth anywhere. "A client?"
"Oh," Sherlock said, after much too much time had passed. His voice sounded faint to his own ears. "Well. That sounds boring. No need for all that."
His chest felt as if it had been ripped open and haphazardly patched back together. Which, he supposed, wasn't far off from the truth.
"I don't think he has," Moriarty says. There is a smirk in his voice, a flat amusement that John remembers all too well. "He's out of the game. They don't send TV weathermen out into the field."
Horses lift curious heads to greet him as he passes. The air is heavy with the odour of hay and sweat.
"Oh?" Sherlock asked, leaning in, his lip curling up into a smile that looked alien and unwelcome on his face. Even his voice did not sound like his own. "Is that so?"
"Oh," Mrs Hudson said, tipping a bottle of bourbon into a bowl of egg nog. "Another year, almost gone. Can you believe it?"
He used Sherlock's shower, grimaced as he redressed in his own soiled clothes. The bloodstains on his shirt had dried in stiff brown patches.
He was magnetic, like that. His eyes vivid and alive with curiosity, narrowed with single-minded focus.
"The rain's let up," he says. Through the window, the sky has begun to lighten. "I'm taking this horse back to King's Pyland."
it to be fine. And I just—all that time, saying I'd forgiven her, and I was just looking for another way to hurt her. To make it even. Who does that? What kind of person just—?"
"Suspension of disbelief," Sherlock said. He spoke in a low, quiet voice, dipping his head down. John's face was very close, in the dark.
Sherlock shrugged. There was a smile threatening at the corners of his mouth. "It's a new year. Time for new beginnings. Fresh starts."
Baker Street was very quiet. He found it all rather distracting, that silence. It got in his way, made him think about things he shouldn't. And there were only so many times he could poke through the contents of Mrs Hudson's fridge before she grew suspicious.
"Was it?" Sherlock did not seem to know what to do with his hands. He set them on top of the table, then lifted them again, his lip curling in dismay. His drink was untouched, sweating in its glass to his left.
Molly had let out a nervous bark of laughter, had cast frantically about for some new topic of conversation. She did not like to think about how good she was at keeping secrets. She had kept Sherlock's secret for two long years, and it had nearly killed him. It had nearly killed John.
"What made you decide you wanted to learn how to dance?" Pete asked him, once the couples around them had begun to move with a bit more confidence.
"I'm not going to make you say anything you don't want to say," John said, feeling suddenly like crying. There was a sick, twisting feeling in his chest, a throbbing behind his eyes. It seemed as though it had been there forever, that feeling.
John stared after them for a moment, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He'd flirted with her automatically, the way he used to, years ago. That was—that was something.
"Good morning," she said. There was a smile curving at the corner of her mouth. "Sherl didn't mention you'd be stopping by."
"I think I'm going to sit up and wait for Father Christmas." John cleared his throat, looked down for a moment before lifting his head again. There was a tense half-smile on his face. "Wait with me?"
John made a pained noise, went to the window, leaned his head against the fogged glass and looked out at the rain. His hands itched to maim, to heal, to
This. This was what he got for trying. He was still going to die, but now he was going to die soaking wet and shivering in the dark. Fantastic. Fan-fucking-tastic.
Sherlock shook his head, his brow furrowing up. He stared hard at John, as if he could not quite comprehend what he was looking at. It was strangely endearing.
"You're right," he said instead. "Won't change anything. He's insufferable at the best of times, and old age has only made him worse."
It felt like the battlefield, and though he was several years removed from action, his mind and body were ready. He stood up, slowly, from behind the desk, still holding his gun. Took another breath, carefully shifted his aim from Mary to Norbury.
He thought, perhaps, it might be the one that haunted him from time to time. The one where John looked on the verge of saying something momentous.
He used to think about kissing Sherlock. Years ago. He used to think about it a lot. He'd inevitably follow those thoughts with all of the reasons it was a bad idea. And then Sherlock had been dead, and John had wished that he'd taken a chance on that bad idea, just once.
assholes ever since their van ran one of our field reporters off the road in a rainstorm. I'd love to see them embarrassed a bit."
He is seized by a sudden panic and wants to call out, wants to halt their slow progression. His voice gums up in his throat and he makes a garbled noise that is swallowed by the wind. That's all right. He has no idea what he wants to say anyway.
"In here!" Lestrade shouted, pulling open a door. He and Anderson disappeared inside, into warm golden light and murmuring conversation. The door swung shut behind them.
He did not close his eyes. The expression on his face was unlike anything John had ever seen before—haunted and longing and verging on terrified.
He threw a cautious glance at Sherlock, wondering what horrifying new personality he was about to unleash.
He closed the fridge without removing the box, stood for a moment with his head bowed, disappointment and a strange regret twisting deep in his chest.
"But. That doesn't make sense," John said. He shook his head, shifted forward in his seat. "No. Moriarty—the man who abducted me. He was surprised to hear that Sherlock was alive. Angry. If Lady Smallwood knew it all along, why only tell him now?"
There had been a frightful row, a smashed mug and thundering stamping footsteps up to her room at the top of the stairs.
Sherlock swallowed. Stared out the window without really seeing anything. He could not focus enough to deduce even the smallest details of the people passing by below.
He blinks, blinks, blinks. Looks down at her seemingly without seeing her at all. Looks back into the flat.
John groaned, rolled his forehead against Sherlock's. He was breathing hard. He pulled back slightly, his eyes fluttering open.
mobile, face-down on the floor against the wall. He reached for it, picked it up. The screen was dark, spider-webbed with deep cracks.
John glanced down at his daughter, at her wide unfettered grin, and wondered when, if ever, he'd smiled like that in his life.
The relationship was fake, of course. A matter of convenience. But Sherlock and Janine had been sharing 221B for months, now. They certainly seemed to get on. They were, as Sherlock had once mentioned,
He thought about the man he'd glimpsed through the store window the other night, the one he'd been so briefly convinced was Sherlock. The way his heart had sped up, the way he'd walked through that door so ready to—
John turned towards the counter, the moment lost. "It's all right, Harry. I'm just—helping out. Be right there."
"I meant what I said," John said, finally. His voice was surprisingly steady. He kept his eyes on the ceiling, watched the shifting shadows. "About being in love with you, too. Just in case you—well. In case you were wondering."
There had been dates. Loads of dates. His problem had never been attracting women. It was keeping them interested that was proving to be a challenge. He supposed his most interesting days were long behind him. That did not bode well for his romantic future.
He shrugged again, suddenly defensive. Turned to look at the painting once more. Something about it troubled him.
Buccaneer is sitting up on the sofa, watching them on high alert, one ear cocked. His tail thumps cautiously against the leather.
John stepped back slightly. He slipped one hand behind Sherlock's head, guided him so their foreheads met. Sherlock's eyes were very wide.
John smiles at him, a sad smile, strangely knowing. The sight makes something inside of Sherlock twist and snarl. He feels as if he could crack open, could spill out all of his miserable unwanted secrets right here on the patterned floor.
"Well," Mary said, and she looked down at the ground for a moment before lifting her gaze back to meet his. "I'm looking forward to working with you. Which I said already. But I suppose that's the sort of thing worth saying again."
John seemed to falter at his expression. He clenched and unclenched his fist where he had pressed it against his thigh. Frowned. "Besides. It's quiet here."
"Sherlock," John manages to gasp out, and he thinks he may humiliate himself by dropping to his knees on the floor. He takes a shaky step, and then another, and then he is gripping the back of his chair, holding himself upright. He is trembling.
"Christ," John says. He tips his head back against the wall, breathes out through clenched teeth. "I'm trying to tell you that it's all right. Being here. It's—it's fine. All right?"
He put a gloved hand against the glass. His heart pounded against his ribs. He thought about opening the door, about stepping inside. Thought about saying
"There are more ways than one to lose someone," she said. "And I thought. Every time we opened his door to check on him, I thought he'd be gone." She paused, shook her head as if banishing some unpleasant thought. "I don't like hurting him. He seems—I know the way he is, sometimes. How he seems like he can't be hurt. But. He can."
"Try to stay out of trouble," he added. "And—I suggest you hang up that phone. My brother rarely lets an opportunity to show off pass him by, and I fear you've rather overindulged him in that regard. There will be no living with him, now."
That thought brought with it a sick swooping sensation in his chest. John ignored it. Opened his laptop, logged into the Facebook account of Alice with the wine memes. Spent a moment scrolling through the photos and posts that Sherlock had already established over the years, refreshing his memory on the type of person Alice was supposed to be.
"No," Sherlock said. He shifted, winced as the water began to run hot. Took his hands away. "I wouldn't investigate your murder, John."
Sherlock parked their hired car next to a gleaming sports car. Watched John swivel his head to admire it.
"People don't take kindly to being blackmailed," Sherlock said. The sun was slipping below the horizon, the shadows gathering close and dark. "Sometimes they fight back."
"As he's left—" Sherlock said, and he offered an exaggerated glance around the empty little room, "I can only assume that you don't return his affections. That whatever there was between you has—um—cooled. Naturally what should follow is a reaffirmation of the affections you
as if spending time at Baker Street had become simply another tedious shift at a job he did not want.
John looks even more confused now, and he offers up a tentative smile along with a head shake. "Yeah, Sherlock, of—of course I'm still here."
There was no reason for John to keep his fingers against the warm thin skin of Sherlock's wrist. His pulse was steady. He was high, yes, he'd made a mess of himself for certain, but he was not overdosing. There was no immediate danger.
John thought of the phone that had vibrated, unanswered, in his pocket. He looked again at Mary, at Mycroft, at Norbury who was inching towards the door. He breathed out through his nose, his heart thudding against his ribs. The smell of gunpowder hung in the air from the shot Norbury had fired into the wall.
He went up to the room, unlocked the door. Flopped onto the little bed against the wall without bothering to remove his coat or shoes.
He shied away, thought instead about the house he'd left behind in London. Thought about his new flat (too small, too dark, too bland). It was less expensive, living in Chelmsford. His army pension covered the rent. The sale of the house left him with a comfortable balance in his bank account.
"One of her clients had stolen a bracelet, John. Something of personal value. She enlisted my help in getting it back."
His lips were cold, chapped. His nose, chilled and damp, brushed along Sherlock's cheek. His fingers curled tight where they had settled against Sherlock's elbows.
It hurt, looking at Sherlock. It made John feel like his own skin had been stretched too tightly over his frame, tugged over his bones and stapled crudely in place. Like whatever was roaring in his chest was too big to contain, like one twist in the wrong direction might split him open, spilling his wretched core out onto the ground for all to see.
They finally pulled up along the kerb, and John fumbled to pay. He zipped up Rosie's coat, left his own hanging open as he struggled out of the cab into the damp icy air.
Sherlock took another step forward, hand out. Through the snow, he could just make out the edges of the Eye, and behind that, the Aquarium—
Sherlock was not in his chair, nor sprawled on the sofa. Gone out, then. Embarrassed, maybe. Or distracted or busy or just looking for another fix. Who knew? Who ever knew, really, when it came to Sherlock Holmes?
Instead, he takes himself upstairs, to the room that used to be his. It is bare of his things, but the bed is freshly turned down with clean sheets,
The night air was crisp and cold. There was a smattering of stars overhead, and John found himself noticing them in a way he never had before.
Even when he'd run, even when he'd left Sherlock behind, even when he'd told himself and anyone who would listen that he was done, he'd—he'd thought—
"That's when the fun begins," Sherlock said. He succeeded in liberating his trouser leg from Rosie's iron grip, hoisted her up to sit on his knee. She seemed to feel that was an acceptable compromise and settled down.
"Oh, that," Sherlock said, the furrow in his brow smoothing out. "Handy thing to have held onto, don't you think?"
John supposes it might not be a terrible thing to keep him, if it doesn't work out with Sherlock. He's not home much, which isn't ideal for a pet. But Rosie would like—
"Funny in that you've cleared out the entire fridge to make room for your—parts. And that includes the leftovers intended for tonight."
He'd expected the world to have paused in his absence, and instead it had kept on turning. There had been no room for him, not anymore, but Mary had
Fear knifed through John's chest even as the shape edged closer, unfamiliar lines coalescing into something recognisable: a tall figure in a long coat.
"It's not too late, you know," she said. "If you have something to say, you should say it." She frowned at him for a moment, then patted him on the shoulder and disappeared back through the door to her flat with Rosie. She left the rubbish bag behind, slumped against the wall.
"She asked me to promise, and I did. Promise. I promised that I would always look out for you, that I would protect you, that I would shield you from harm. And, to be entirely honest, I did not find it nearly as distasteful as I thought I would. I—well. I rather embraced my task, if you must know."
Sherlock looked up at him again. There was no smile on his face. He looked tired, worn out, unhappy.
When he came to a second time, Molly was sat in a plastic chair near his bedside. Her hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail (done hastily, absently, she'd been surprised in the middle of some task), her right arm was held at an awkward angle (older injury or strain, residual soreness) and she'd chewed at her lower lip. It was chapped and raw (stress, worry, concern—)
Mrs Hudson opened the next paper, tutted to herself. Put her hand over her mouth. Gave Sherlock another disapproving look, which he ignored entirely.
"No," John said, sagging slightly. He reached into his pocket, drew out his phone. The screen cast the small space in an eerie blue light. "Christ, this is humiliating."
"Erm, well, yes?" She gave him a hopeful, pained sort of smile. "I did sort of think we had potential. As friends?"
"Sherlock," John had said, stopping in the door, looking back over his shoulder. His voice was gravelly, deeper than usual. "I'll be—just—"
A startlingly attractive woman stood against the wall, just to the left of a potted plant. She had dark hair that framed her face in soft waves. Her eyes were fixed on a phone in her hand.
Would he be here, now, by Sherlock's side? Would he have laughed at Sherlock's response to Lestrade, and said
There was a man standing behind his desk, bending over to examine the computer. He straightened as the door creaked open, offered a large smile.
"Yeah," John said. He offered a bland smile. They seemed to find the bland smiles reassuring. Less so when he showed too many teeth. "Come on in."
Janine, caught up in a crescendo of righteous fury, stalked out the door without looking and crashed face-first into a man in a black wool coat on his way in.
She had taken the majority of her personal effects with her to university. The books left behind on the tall shelf by the wall were old, the few clothes remaining in her wardrobe were ill-fitting.
"I'm afraid I'll be complete rubbish at this," Sherlock said, blinking and utterly guileless. "She wants me to learn for our wedding, but—" he let out a nervous giggle, "—I'm afraid I've got two left feet. Oh, I'll be just
"In other words, you need to get out of there," John said quietly, thinking about the kind of interrogation that led to lacerations on the back and upper arms. "And it's becoming more urgent every day."
"No," John said. He was pressing gently at Sherlock's shoulders, trying to get him to sit down. "It stings, I'll grant you that. But it's not fatal."
"The plane," he sighed. He could lie, of course, spin some sort of fiction to make himself sound a bit less pathetic, but he thought that might be, somehow, even worse. "Right before takeoff."
He does not have to go far. There is a figure—Joe Straker, he assumes—sprawled face-down in the tall grass. Blood has flattened his hair, spread out in a wet dark halo around his head.
"The greatest detective in the world, so all the papers say," Pete said. He kept the gun trained on Sherlock. "But you had no idea."
John shifted in the back seat of the taxi, unzipped his coat, leaned his head back against the seat. It was warm. The cabbie had the heat blasting, and that coupled with the jerking stop-start motion of the car in heavy traffic was vaguely nauseating.
"I thought. Erm. The time might come, eventually, that Rosie would want—well. There might be a school trip, or a birthday party, or an invitation from a friend. And. Um."
"Hey," John says again, and holds up the stack of papers in Sherlock's line of sight. "You forgot to sign this page."
"Sorry," he said, voice low, as Sherlock stirred under the blanket, raised himself up on an elbow. "I didn't mean to wake you." He winced at the words, shook his head. "No. God no. That—came out. A lot creepier than I intended. I wanted—um. My—my jumper. Thought I'd left it. I didn't know that you—what are you doing up here, anyway?"
John looked down at the knees of his jeans, ruined now. Then he looked across the counter at his sister.
She looked back at him, her eyes hard. "What you are to him? I could never be that. I wanted to. I used to want that. But."
Sherlock was standing at the mantel, frowning down at the skull. He turned at the sound of John's voice.
"Oh, right," John said. He handed it back. Their fingers brushed. Sherlock's hands were cool, like he'd been outside without gloves.
He could not see Harry's face, but her frustrated exhalation over the phone told him all he needed to know.
"If you had—if I—" John presses the back of his hand against his mouth for a moment, steadies himself. "I might have done things differently. I might not have married—I might not have married Mary." Even now, he finds it difficult to say her name. It is a wound that will not quite heal.
"Temporarily," she'd admitted. "I've got a friend moving into a new place in about two weeks. We're planning on sharing."
"Are you all right?" John asked, his voice a low, harsh whisper against Sherlock's ear. He did not take his hand away from Sherlock's mouth.
It was cosy, in Sherlock's odd little flat. He liked the way the rain made shadows play against the patterned wallpaper. It was the sort of place he'd like to come home to. And the sort of place Sherlock deserved to come home to.
The fire cast a warm glow over the sitting room. It was cosy. He watched the flames dance well into the night and did not get up.
"I'd thought you didn't—how long have you—?" John cut himself off, dipped to press a hard kiss against Sherlock's lips. His voice cracked as he continued, something in his tone strained and trying for humour. "Just don't—don't tell me you've been in love with me this whole time. Because I—that would—that would—"
By then his tea had grown cold. And so he'd carried his mug into the kitchen and set it on the counter. He'd refilled the kettle and turned it on, stood tapping his fingers impatiently against the countertop while it boiled.
Two days after that, Mycroft texted him with travel arrangements and details of his first assignment. He put on his coat, found himself hesitating at the door.
"Oh," Sherlock said. He kept his voice mild, polite. Best not to let John see that he was nearly vibrating out of his own skin. "Good."
"I wanted to feel as close to the city as possible," she says. "Flat on Baker Street. James Bond's car. Do you understand?"
And it did not make it better that everything was now back to some semblance of normal. That Sherlock was clean again, that he'd dragged himself up from rock bottom and had recovered without any serious long-term damage. That John seemed capable of smiling again, was able to care for himself and his daughter. That the two of them had stitched up yet another terrible gaping wound between them.
Allie went on crumbling her scone, an absent motion. "Um. About two years now, I suppose. Since he and his father moved in."
He lifted the peas from his nose, shot her an incredulous look. "I presume you're referring to yourself? I'm hardly a pensioner."
"I—" John says. He shakes his head, looks down at the ground. When he looks back at Sherlock, it is as if some spell has broken. Sherlock's face is bland, impassive. "No. That's all right. You go ahead. This isn't my life anymore."
"Shit," John said. He took a hesitant step forward, hand clenching and unclenching. "Shit—Sherlock—I'm—"
They ran together down the alley, shoes slapping against wet pavement. Blood roared in John's ears, his heart pounding, veins singing with the thrill of the chase.
But florist shops, though lovely, seemed to uniformly possess a humid, oppressive air that quickly grew suffocating. His eyes watered. He sniffled and snuffled and struggled to draw breath through his nose.
Sherlock shook his head, not knowing exactly what John was asking. He was out of his depth. He'd been out of his depth since John appeared in the doorway. Hell, he'd been out of his depth for the majority of recent memory. A year, at least. More than a year. Since that day in the aquarium when John had first turned away from him, Mary's blood still wet on his hands.
John shifted uncomfortably in his chair, fixed his gaze on the wall, tried not to notice all of the empty spaces Mary no longer inhabited. "It wasn't—" he started, and then stopped. His hand twitched.
"Exactly," Sherlock said. It came out clipped, rushed, as if he were eager to return the conversation to familiar territory.
"—says you took a detour to Regent's Park. Why Regent's Park? Close proximity to Baker Street. So! What can we deduce from that? You set out with the intention of seeking my help, yet found yourself reluctant to follow through once you'd arrived. Instead you elected to stop off for a cup of coffee and a croissant you did not want in an effort to buy yourself additional time to consider your options, and
Baker Street had been thoroughly cleaned and dusted. The bulbs in all of the lamps had been replaced. They were brighter, reached farther. The distant corners of the flat were no longer entirely mysterious.
"But his priorities changed when he realized that a large chunk of it was under your name, out of his reach," Sherlock said. "So he came up with a new plan."
John turned away, scanned the audience again. He saw amusement, and impatience, and confusion. Lestrade had his head in his hands. His shoulders were shaking with suppressed laughter. Molly was staring up at the ceiling. Mrs Hudson was crying.
It just seemed unnecessary. All of it. Bringing Janine in all the way from Sussex to collaborate on a case, after everything that had happened between them. John hadn't even known that they'd kept in touch. Why should they have? Sherlock had used her—rather heartlessly, in his opinion—and she had soothed her broken heart by airing all of his dirty secrets in public.
Sherlock swept his coat up and over them both. The hem was wet, and John hissed as cold wool brushed against his bare leg. He tucked his feet up, pulled the thin blanket closer around himself.
Sherlock had said. And John had believed him. He'd believed him entirely, without hesitation. The idea of Sherlock, brilliant, confident Sherlock, using at all had been incomprehensible.
John turned off the tap, braced his hands on the sink. Stared hard at himself in the mirror. He looked tired, and old, lines etched in his skin by years of sorrow and anger. His eyes were sunken, shadowed, haunted.
John thought of the many times that the faces of the dead had haunted his sleep over the years. The twisted guilt and remorse and longing that had dogged him since the war.
"Um," John said. He looked down at his hands. "You remember what I—what I—told you. A few weeks ago. About—um. Texting that woman. On the bus."
"All right, all right just—just hold on," John said, holding out his hands as if he expected pandemonium to erupt.
He blinked once, hard, struggled to focus. The room was very bright. There were clouds behind Sherlock, grey clouds, thick and rolling along the far wall.
Sherlock's mouth clicks shut. His weakly flickering train of thought sputters, dies. For a moment there is nothing, no sound, not even his own heartbeat.
"Oh, I wish he'd said something! Did you know all of this was going on? Hello, dear," Mrs Hudson added, pausing to smile at Rosie.
But he does have new and interesting things to write about. Doesn't he? His life did not end when Sherlock's did. Even if it sometimes felt that way, at first.
Sherlock hesitates. Briefly considers the viability of their bathtub for piranha containment. Shakes his head, refocuses. "Vivid though your imagination may be, I highly doubt that piranhas will come into play this evening."
John had pushed aside the awkwardness of their last meeting. He'd swallowed his pride and he'd squared his shoulders and he'd come to
The hallway was poorly lit and smelled vaguely of mold. Through thin walls he could hear the faint sounds of a baby crying, an endless, whooping squall. He curled his lip in distaste, thought of John returning to this place after work, night after night after night.
"I'm not interested in Pete," John said. He smiled tightly, wanting the conversation to end, unable to bear Sherlock's eyes on him, Janine's bewildered smile.
"Molly Hooper," John said, conscious of the eyes on him, the musicians still quietly and obliviously setting up in the corner, the woman at the desk who had stood from her chair to watch him proceed into the room. He had begun to sweat, his earlier bravado deserting him.
The stretcher halts. Someone touches his shoulder, feather-light, fleeting. It is meant as comfort, he supposes, but it is unnecessary. He is beyond comfort now.
John turned away, closed his suitcase with more force than strictly necessary. "We should get going. Catch that next train back to London, yeah?"
He'd shut up. Held her gaze evenly over the little table. Sunlight filtered through the little window against the far wall.
"We should go inside," John says, and he turns back to the door. This time he manages to turn the key.
He had arrived home from Belarus. John had not left yet. They'd exchanged words, and John had left for work at the surgery. Sherlock had been bored, and irritated, and—
"Yeah, she headed up to the concert about twenty minutes ago. Is this about the results? Dr Bell should be here—"
The shirtsleeve on his left arm has been cut away, a thick bandage wrapped around his bicep. There is a scrape on his right temple (struck the pavement when he fell). His shirt is damp, his hair rumpled and unkempt. He has lost his coat.
Sherlock thought all of this might have been a good deal easier if he simply had died. But he found himself unwilling to disagree.
John went up the stairs, phone tucked against his ear, and pushed through the door into the comfortable sitting room of Sherlock's flat.
It occurred to him that his first Christmas in the Baker Street flat, the one he thought back on most fondly, was likely not such a fond memory for her. He'd treated her badly.
John groaned, his head lolling to the side. There were hands on his face, the palms cold and chapped and unfamiliar.
John sent at midnight. He kissed Rosie on the head, carried her off to bed. Spent a few moments looking down at her, quietly promising her a better year than the last.
"I shouldn't have said 'fuck'," Wiggins said, glancing guiltily out at the crowd. "Sorry. That was rude."
Sherlock catches her, lifts her up. She is holding a lolly and she wastes no time in pressing it against his shirt. He peels it away, looks at the sticky red smear it has left in its wake.
"Rosie and I can't share forever. It's already—it's already not good, and it's only going to get worse. I know that I'll have to. I
John nudged and Sherlock fell backwards willingly, his hands grasping, pulling John down to join him. John kissed him, one hand in Sherlock's hair and the other still stroking along the side of Sherlock's heaving ribs.
"I expect you'll come to love them in time," Sherlock said. He offered her another one of those bland smiles. "They'll remind you of our wedding day."
"I always assumed—" Sherlock stood up, went to the window. His fingers twitched and he longed for something to occupy them. His violin. A cigarette. "I always assumed I'd end up here eventually. But I'd never imagined the circumstances could be happy ones."
There had been other joyful moments in the subsequent years, of course. But nothing that even approached the prolonged sense of happiness and belonging that he'd felt in that all-too-brief time. He thought he could have stayed there forever, had circumstances allowed.
"He got so much more than he'd asked for," Sherlock said. "Instead of a quick laugh at a romantic rival's expense, he got to play the hero, rescuing the damsel from the cruel tyrant." He paused, smiled. It was a sharp smile, predatory. "And then he got a taste for it."
"All right, all right, Jesus, I heard you the first time you don't need to keep ringing it—" John's voice, grumpy and familiar and
My deepest thanks to everyone who has been reading along and commenting. I've got a good head start on the next chapter, so my hope is that there will not be quite as long of a wait as there was this time around. My best guess is that the completed story will run somewhere around 9 chapters in total.
He threw the baggie at the wall. It landed with a halfhearted thud, slid to the ground without even giving him the satisfaction of splitting open. He wanted quite badly to be angry, but did not have the energy.
Rosie cooed and babbled and tried to chew on his shirt collar. He shut his eyes and rocked his daughter to the music and tried not to think of Sherlock, of that wide genuine smile. Sherlock had shut his eyes and John had fled, had gone striding off down the corridor like a coward. He did not want to think about what had happened to that smile when Sherlock had opened his eyes to find him gone.
angry, of course. Disappointed. But I'm not the focus. Or at least, not directly. You're disappointed in yourself. For—" he faltered, an unpleasant chill creeping down his spine, at odds with the warmth rising in his face, "—for caring about someone incapable of—"
Eurus had been allowed to continue painting. She'd done quite a lot of it, over the years. There had been no withholding of supplies in exchange for work, no trades for information, no special treats in return for favours granted. She'd simply been permitted to do what she liked.
Instead it left him feeling strangely bereft. He looked down at the ground. Wondered when it had stopped, and what had been the thing to stop it.
He gestured helplessly towards Rosie, who had fallen asleep against Sherlock's neck, her face slack and peaceful.
John taps his fingers against the wood surface of the kitchen table, a staccato rhythm. He seems unaware that he is doing it. His gaze is distant.
Camera batteries drained, car engines stalling at inopportune moments. Faulty hard drives. Lost data.
He shut his eyes for a moment, breathed in through his nose to steady himself. She had, he knew, never really been there at all. It did not make the loss sting any less.
Henry growled, low in the back of his throat. Sherlock reached out, stroked a soothing hand along his back. He quieted.
"More or less," Sherlock said, abruptly, shattering the quiet that had fallen between them. It took John a moment to reason out that Sherlock was answering his earlier question.
He picks up dinner and carries it back to 221B. The hallway is warm and sweet-smelling as he shuts the door behind them—Mrs Hudson has been baking again.
He ignored her, went through the door and out onto the street. Thought about coincidences and chance meetings and impossible circumstances. His heart beat unsteadily against his ribs, even as he told himself it was crazy, that he was wrong, that he was seeing things, imagining things, that it simply
John wanted to kiss him, and so he did. Their lips slid together, comfortable and warm, like they'd been doing it for years.
Sherlock looks at him for a moment longer. There is a strange tension in him. He is nearly vibrating, as volatile as the sky above.
It was a bad idea, coming here. He should not have done it. He should have hired a lawyer to make sure Sherlock received the papers and then washed his hands of the whole mess.
Sherlock hissed as John's chilled hand met sleep-warm skin. John dragged his hand up, his palm splaying open to cradle the rise of Sherlock's ribs.
John took the phone away from his ear, stared at it. His face was hot. His fist was clenched at his side.
"Are you all right?" she asked, and then she winced, looked away. "Well. No. I mean. Of course you're not all right. You were shot. You're lucky you even—no—just—" she stopped, blew out a frustrated breath.
John put his head in his hands, the pleasant fantasy he'd indulged dissipating like smoke. There would be no week in bed with Sherlock, giddily exploring one another like teenagers in love, taking breaks only to fetch takeaway and—well, it was Sherlock, so he was sure that solving crimes would factor in at some point, but—
Sherlock frowns. "Why not? I doubt you'd be able to find more reasonable accommodations in central London—"
Sherlock, who smelled of cigarettes and wool, whose cheeks were ruddy from the cold, his hair slightly mussed from the wind.
"Oh, you didn't think Irene was actually helping, did you?" Moriarty gave a little giggle, stepped further into the room.
"And so do I," John said, his voice so low he doubted Sherlock had even heard over the beep of the machines. He cleared his throat, stood up.
"No," John said. He smiled tightly, aware that Sherlock could not see his expression. "I mean—not—I know
She stood up, smoothed her dress with the palms of her hands. Stared at him for a moment with an inscrutable expression.
He supposed he ought to have known that. There had been a party. Pink streamers and such. Little cakes. He'd tuned most of it out.
"I—" She blinked at him, her eyes wide, looking flustered. She did not let go of the door. "Can you lower that? I don't—I—"
He hadn't been able to see past his (useless, distracting) emotions to solve the puzzle that was right in front of his face—
He digs the bottle out of the bag and opens it without any fanfare. He takes a sip, swallows, shuts his eyes against the burn. He takes a second, larger sip.
Ah. So they're meant to have this conversation now after all. Here, in the street, mere steps from home.
"You appreciate nothing because you understand nothing," Sherlock snaps. "Shut up. I'm trying to tell you something."
Sherlock stood looking down at him. He was not quite smiling, but the corners of his eyes crinkled. John found himself unable to look away.
"TELL ME!" Sherlock shouted, and his voice echoed through the quiet streets. He looked down at the ground, suddenly exhausted beyond measure.
Sherlock wrenched John's jeans open with a triumphant cry, reached for him with trembling, inexpert fingers. He wanted—he wanted—
She went down the hall into her little office, retrieved a black duffel bag. Went back through the doors into the morgue, set the bag on the table.
He lets himself sink against the wall. Puts his head in his hands, listens to the burble of the tanks.
He stood up, went into the kitchen. Started a pot of coffee. Tried not to think of Sherlock's quiet, resigned voice shaping the words
After a moment, Sherlock took a tentative step forward. He sat down at the table, facing John. He was conscious of everything—the squeak of the chair on the lino, the slow drip from the faucet pattering into the sink. The sound of his own breathing.
The heat rising off of the keyboard is too much to ignore. There is a faint, growing smell of melting plastic.
"No," he said. "Not pissed. At least, I don't think so. Just—I don't know. There was something about him."
"You also mentioned that you're dead," John said. "Funny. I find myself talking to a lot of dead people these days."
John bounced his knee, stared out the window. It would have been easier to go home first, to unload his packages and unpack his bags, to settle Rosie before trying to make contact with Sherlock. But he'd given the cabbie the Baker Street address without hesitation.
"Alone is all that I have," Sherlock said, desperate now, his voice quiet and hoarse. John's palm was warm against his cheek, his thumb stroking gentle circles. "Alone protects me."
he'd redirected his attention back to Rosie because it was safe, it was easy, a classic retreat. "No dangerous chemicals. No knives. No—no professionally bound book pointing out why all of the children in her play group are actually secret members of a—a—toddler murder club."
Sherlock glanced back over at John, who appeared to have closed his eyes in an effort to avoid meeting his gaze. His lips threatened a smile.
The guests took their seats. John took his place next to Sherlock at the altar, shoulders straight, muscles tensed. He very determinedly did not look at Wiggins, dark-eyed and somber in his vicar's robes.
Well, if you've paid attention at all over the last few years, you already know all about Janine Hawkins. Last time was a bit of a disaster, but she and Sherlock have made up and have decided to give it another go. They're very excited to begin wedding planning, and I suppose as the best man I'll be along for the ride. Stay tuned here for updates!
Sherlock shakes his head slowly. He feels as though he is still underwater, as though he is miles behind with no hope of catching up.
He could not recall the last time, if ever, the symbolic start of a new year had filled him with—what exactly
John, who had stomped on the spider with a definitive motion. He moved forward, caught Sherlock by the shoulders, held him firmly.
"Well. It seemed a hell of a lot like you were trying to set us up. Except I can't, exactly, think of any reason why you'd want to do that."
He considered that. Opened his eyes. John was standing very close, his expression warm and concerned. He felt some of the tension go out of his shoulders.
He thought of Sherlock as he'd last seen him, sitting in his chair with the late afternoon sunlight slanting through the windows. Thought of his bloodied eye, the ugly black stitches marring the fair skin above his brow. Thought of the expression on his face as John had moved towards the door, pained and confused and achingly hopeful all at once.
He rode the tube home, shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, lips pressed together, rigid and tense and filled with anxious rising dread, because Sherlock had been home in their flat all day, and by now he must know that John had been in his room, and—
He pressed the palm of his hand against his pocket, against the hard case of the phone. Hesitated. Drew it out again. Looked at it.
John was close. His expression had changed. He looked, once more, like he had something he wanted to say, something he was fighting to either hold in or blurt out.
"Oh, are we using euphemisms now? That's not like you. Always thought you favoured a more direct approach," John said.
He had arrived home from Belarus. John had been at the surgery. He'd been bored, and irritated, and had spray-painted the wall, and then he'd gone upstairs to fetch John's gun for a bit of target practice—
She'd waxed rhapsodic about her husband-to-be and complained about his attitude towards wedding planning in turn.
John shifted where he stood, feeling strangely hollow. He thought about how Sherlock had stood from his chair and embraced him, once, had held him quietly while he shook himself apart.
John's phone buzzed in his pocket as he walked, hunched against the chill damp air, his duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He stopped, earned a dirty look from two passerby who had to swerve to avoid walking into him.
John had said nothing. He'd pressed a kiss to Sherlock's shoulder, his stubble rasping against pale skin.
Sherlock did not contact him about further appointments. It was possible, of course, that he'd got it all arranged. That there were no further appointments to be had.
When he opens his eyes again, he is mud-spattered and plastered against Sherlock's back, his arms locked tightly around Sherlock's waist. It takes a moment to release his grip, his hands and forearms cramping. His heart jackhammers against his ribs.
"So. The head was in the gift shop the whole time," John says. He steps further into the room, clicks on a lamp. The soft light is disorienting after the hours spent in darkness.
Instead he went up the next flight of stairs on wooden legs, towards his old room. He couldn't show up at Mrs Hudson's door looking and feeling like this. He needed to get himself under control, and he needed to do it somewhere that was not mere steps away from Sherlock's (closed, closed, closed) bedroom door.
John no longer lived at Baker Street. The bland little house they pulled up in front of was puzzling and troubling and entirely unexpected.
"You know why I'm here," Sherlock had said, as soon as Rosie was comfortably distracted by her assignment.
"Mm," Sherlock said. "Think I'll be taking a break from the spy business for a while. Not really my area."
John had half expected Sherlock to come up with some astoundingly elaborate reason to force him to miss his interview, but he'd done nothing of the sort. He'd sat at the kitchen table with his microscope and had wished John a polite
"Sherlock," John says, and he steps up close, very close, so that they are breathing the same air. His brow is pinched tight with stress. His eyes are sad. "I know," he says. "I
He doubted he even had much to worry about from Moriarty. If Irene was right (and Sherlock certainly seemed to be betting his life that she was), Moriarty was likely now leaning on his second leak, his backup plan. John had delivered his information to MI6, and had therefore served his use. There would be no point pursuing him, unless Moriarty fancied himself the vindictive type.
"Jesus," John said. A laugh threatened to bubble up in his chest. He tipped his head back, looked up at the ceiling.
Sherlock said, circling around, skirting ever closer but not touching. His voice was flat, his face expressionless.
Sherlock blinked. Paused. Blinked again. His grip tightened, released. Life crept back into his face, his eyelids fluttering. He drew a breath.
"I know. But that's what children do, is it not?" Mycroft looked back at Sherlock. There was something strangely sad in his expression. "They grow up and leave you behind."
"The story checks out," Sherlock said. "Bride and groom on horseback, in full formal attire—begs the question of
He allowed himself to be steered into the sitting room, nudged into his chair. He tilted his head back, pressed the bag of peas against his face. He closed his eyes.
The streets had been clogged with traffic that seemed to originate from a minor fender bender, and he'd arrived at Paddington Station just in time to see his second train depart.
He turns towards the door, where the first officer is already approaching. He does not bother to smile.
It had been mad and beautiful and Rosie would have loved it, he knew, he'd seen the way she reacted to bright colours and busy patterns and there was so much,
"Looks like another delay," the woman seated across the aisle said. She rustled her newspaper, set it down in her lap. Sighed.
John swallowed. His mouth had gone dry. There was no going back now. They were going to see this through.
"Sorry to disappoint you," Mary said. She cleared her throat. "John? Maybe you'd like to reconsider where you're pointing that gun?"
"Oi, Sherlock, finish that drink!" Lestrade said, emerging from the crowd somewhere behind them and thumping Sherlock hard on the back. "Anderson's got another round. And I've got something good planned."
"He was going to come back," Bell said. "That's what he told me. He was going to go—he was going to go
"Yes," Sherlock agreed. He pushed open the door. The hinges did not squeak. He'd paid a caretaker a significant sum over the years to keep things tidy and well-maintained.
John had flattened his palm against Sherlock's chest, right over his heart. They'd stayed like that for what felt like hours, sweat cooling on sticky skin. Sherlock's breathing was slow and even.
"—and so here I am. And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy at all. But I think it was the right choice."
He cut himself off, crouched down. His shoes squelched in the mud. He stared at the tyre, waiting for it to reveal its secrets.
Sherlock settled her onto his hip without comment, continued his sweep through the flat as if he'd never been interrupted in the first place.
"There seems to be some mistake," he said. He smiled, the most charming one in his arsenal, leaned in. Dropped his voice low. "Dr Hooper. Molly Hooper. Do you know who she is?"
"Look," John said. He clenched his hand. His palm was clammy. "Do you have anything on? A case, or—"
Janine had hailed a taxi, stood waiting for them with the door open and a rather smug smile on her face.
He breathed out through his nose, let his hand drop to his side. The gun was heavy and warm against his sweat-slicked skin. His palms had gone damp. His face burned hot. He averted his gaze.
John looked at them, thought about the nightmarish day spent picking them out. The heavy floral aroma in the air, Sherlock's arm around Janine's waist. The endless sniping, the fighting, the making up.
It is on a Monday morning, standing sleep-deprived and mildly delirious in the cluttered kitchen, that Sherlock realises he does not need to let go. That he can hold on, and keep holding on, and that John will hold him back.
But he would not have chosen Sherlock over Mary. Not that night in the Landmark, and not any of the nights that had come after. If Mary had elected to force the issue, John Watson would have severed himself from Sherlock's life cleanly, with surgical precision.
She moved towards him again, and he shrank back from her touch, shaking his head. He straightened up and went out of the room without looking back, his hand clenching at his side. She listened to his retreating footsteps as they echoed through the corridor.
It was, he thought, what John had done to him. Sliced and sawed through his armor, turned him inside out, left him unzipped and exposed, raw and ruined. The pitiable, pathetic soft core of him spilled out for all the world to see.
He could see police lights through the swirling snow as the taxi drew close, and he thumped his fist on the seat in front of him.
He looked down at the bar, traced his finger through a bit of condensation that had beaded against the wood. She was pretty. Once, a long time ago, he might have tried to flirt with her. She would have been just his type.
"Well, I—" Lestrade said. He hesitated, looked at Molly, then at Sherlock, seemed to rally. "I already cancelled my date. So there's no need for me to rush off."
The stitching where the strap met the bag had begun to fray. John threw himself backwards, the bag giving way, tearing as he toppled, the laptop firm in his grasp.
It is early, so John walks slowly. It is a nice day, not quite warm enough yet to go without a coat, but there is a pleasing hint of spring in the air.
It had been a lovely spring day when they'd left Dartmoor. But now John could see clouds gathering on the horizon. The wind had picked up.
The plane waits on the runway. He looks at it, and is struck with a wave of déjà vu, overwhelming, nauseating. Behind him, the driver has turned off the car. The engine clicks in the cold air.
He shut his eyes, breathed in through his nose. When he opened his eyes, the figure in the corner of the room was still there, but it had taken on a more familiar form.
He felt, rather than heard, Sherlock swallow behind him. The proximity was terribly intimate. If this had happened—before—he supposed he'd have been cracking all sorts of jokes to break the tension.
he thought but did not say. Instead he shifted Rosie on his lap again, cleared his throat. "All set with the paperwork?"
"Um," Sherlock said, and then he was climbing over the console, awkwardly clambering into the back seat with his too-long limbs. His knee cracked against John's.
"You can't approach them as yourself, you'll give the whole thing away. No one's going to attempt to murder me if they think I'm in the middle of an investigation."
"Every moment that I waste explaining things to you is time that could be spent coming up with a solution," he snapped. "Time is of the essence, now stop burdening me with your presence so I can
It is not that he's refusing to sign them, John tells himself. He certainly hadn't objected when John had walked away. It is far more likely that it has simply escaped his attention, that he is knee-deep in field work and research and has not spared a second thought for John or pesky legalities.
John's head feels better when he's emerged from the shower, though his stomach is tender and reminds him, none too gently, that he'd consumed a great deal of alcohol the night before.
on that very first day, and has spent the years stretched between that moment and this one carefully shielding his heart. He has not always been successful.
Sherlock shut his eyes, attempted to banish John from his head. "Did you tell her you weren't keen when you cancelled? Otherwise you'll get her hopes up and she'll just keep trying to reschedule."
and Greg was right in that he'd spent two years wishing he'd done things differently and had then promptly and viciously turned away from his miracle. He'd turned away and Sherlock hadn't pursued, but why had he ever expected such a thing in the first place? Sherlock didn't
"Will you just—" John says. He shakes the bag in Sherlock's direction. "I've only been wandering around this bloody place for the past hour, looking for you."
"Don't even bother," Sherlock said, shooing her back in. He turned towards the attendant, snapped his fingers briskly. "We'll need something else."
John watched the cameras click as passerby stopped to watch them argue and make up. And argue and make up. And argue and make up.
John leans down and kisses him, and it takes a bit of maneuvering to get the angle just right—for a moment they are all noses and chins—but then it is perfect. John's lips are warm and soft and he tastes a bit like the tea he's been drinking and his morning stubble rasps against Sherlock's chin.
The dressing room door creaked open. Sherlock emerged, looking ruffled and mildly guilty, but guilty in a way that suggested he was only
John scrolled through her pictures, paged through her old posts. She had a tendency to overshare. She and Reginald Teller had split and reconciled several times over the years leading to their ill-fated wedding, and she had documented each and every disagreement IN ALL CAPS. He dutifully read the details, noted the comments.
Well. People sometimes got tactile when they were high. And as much as he seemed loathe to admit it, Sherlock was human.
"Come on," he said, deciding without realizing there was a decision to make. "Let's go see Sherlock."
"You know what I'm talking about. Don't pretend that you don't," she spoke quickly, quiet yet vehement, as if the words were difficult to force out. Something twisted in her expression and she breathed in sharply, took a sip of her wine. "And don't. Don't make fun. It's just—you're so unhappy. Both of you. Everyone thinks that I can't see it, but I do. I do see it. And—"
"This is a racehorse, John. His only value is on the track. You can't run a stolen horse in the Wexell Cup."
That had earned him sharp and disapproving looks from both Donovan and Lestrade, expressions that vanished entirely when they, too, looked down at their phones and similarly began to laugh.
He touched the sign, ran his fingertips along the print. The neatly lettered hours flaked away, crumbling and drifting towards the ground, leaving nothing in their wake but an expanse of smooth red.
Within fifteen minutes, his phone had begun buzzing with text messages. Updates. Photos. Rosie, small and fierce and tear-streaked and furious, making her way through the shadows.
Sherlock starts, looks at him. For a moment he thinks John means the flat (not just a place, wasn't he only just thinking that? It's not just a place, it's their
There he found Sherlock, keyed-up beyond belief, petulant and manic, surrounded by bullet holes (the wall had it coming, indeed!) There was also a severed head in the fridge, its mouth gone slack, its eyes glassy and droopy, and oh, Christ that was—that was—
Sherlock did not speak. He stared hard at John, a furrow appearing between his brows. John had the uncomfortable sensation that the entirety of the last year had been written on his skin, neatly printed in dark ink, easily legible even under the dim pub lights.
His father's voice. His father's hand on his shoulder. His father's face, pinched with sorrow. That was the way it had ended.
"I was worried we might not get to chat," Mary said, still smiling. "You sort of rushed right by me on your way in."
"So you'll be looking for something to do to pass the time, I suppose," she said. She tossed the towel behind her, gave him another easy smile.
"Shit," John said. "I'll shut up now. Sorry. I shouldn't have—I shouldn't have assumed. None of my business, really."
Mary did not even glance in his direction. "We meet at last," she said, her voice cold, her gaze fixed on Smallwood.
And then it crashes in on him anew, his reason for being here in this plain little room out on the moors. It has been a year and four days since Sherlock's death, and John is no closer to moving on than he was the day after it happened.
There was some relief in it, he thought. He'd been drawing breath without really living for a long time now. The choice had been taken out of his hands. All he had to do now was wait.
When the window and its view of Baker Street below had grown stale, he'd gone rummaging through the flat, overturning boxes, kicking up clouds of dust and paging absently through books he'd not looked at in years. He'd discovered two cigarettes (stale, slightly crushed) tucked away in a teacup in the back of a kitchen cabinet, and had smoked them one right after another, perched nervously at the edge of his chair. He'd stood. He'd paced. The floorboards had creaked relentlessly underfoot.
They have set up in the parking lot of a cafe across the street from the repair shop; a fleet of sleek black vehicles and one enormous RV. The fact that they have come here, the closest town to the accident, and that they have set up directly across from the repair shop, cannot
He hesitated at the door. Even after all this time, after everything that had happened, it felt wrong to simply ring the bell. He used his key instead, ignoring the little tingle of guilt the action prompted, and stepped inside. He closed the door quietly and carefully behind him.
Sherlock's grip tightened on him. He slipped his hand from John's pulse point to brace against his back, helped him to sit up. The room righted itself with some reluctance.
His browsing history indicated he'd been reading up on the area, familiarising himself with nearby shops and restaurants and even hospitals.
He finds a half-empty bakery box of scones in the tiny kitchen, clearly left over from the day before. He eats two of them while standing over the box, not minding at all that they are stale.
He had no doubt that Mycroft could have forced her hand, could have revoked privileges in exchange for cooperation on the days when she refused. But as far as Sherlock knew, ever since that long-ago day in his office when they'd first clashed on the subject, Mycroft never had.
"All right," John says. He looks at Sherlock. His eyes are damp. "You don't need to show off, I already know you're a bloody genius."
"Whatever I have to," John said. "Whatever you need. You know that." He took a breath, squared his shoulders, met Sherlock's gaze. "I know you've got a plan."
John is wrapped in a dressing gown. His hair is wet and spiky, his skin shiny with moisture. He looks warm, and relaxed, and soft in a way that Sherlock rarely sees anymore. (Hasn't seen in years, not since they'd last lived together.) The hot water has clearly done its part in soothing his aching shoulder, much as Sherlock had expected.
He thought of Mary, all of the reasons he'd given, all of the reasons she'd supported. They were true. They made sense. In a way, there was a certain kinship. He, too, would shoot, would kill, for John Watson.
"Nothing to be sorry for," Sherlock said. "You saved my life. And not for the first time. I'm in your debt."
His stomach drops. He sits for a moment, quiet and still in the little hard-backed chair in front of Sarah's desk while the world rearranges around him.
"Very subtle flavour. Just a hint of it, really. Honey in the buttercream for a bit of sweetness. Ideal for a spring wedding."
"Look," John said. He licked his lips, looked away. "I'm not—if I'm—if this is. Um. Not something you want to hear, then I swear I'll never mention it again. But this wedding is fucked anyway, and I just—"
He had made the regrettable error of assuming that all Detective Inspectors possessed Lestrade's ability to endure the occasional insult in service of the greater good.
) had been poorly received. Too glib, perhaps. Or perhaps John had not wanted reciprocation at all. There had been a certain degree of self-loathing in those words, after all, and even in his limited experience Sherlock was given to understand that one did not generally woo a partner by appearing despondent about the whole thing.
He’d pictured his homecoming, had calculated a number of ways it might have gone. None of those ways had involved John being anything less than happy. None of those ways had involved John asking for someone else’s hand in marriage. None of those ways had involved John walking away.
It had been a blow to the ego, he supposed. But a mild one. The flirting had been little more than a reflex. He wasn't interested in—he hadn't thought seriously about—not since Mary, not since everything that had happened.
Sherlock smiles at him, a quick insincere flash of teeth. He turns his attention to Mary, looking her up and down. To her credit, she does not wilt under his scrutiny.
he'd thought, years ago, his blood spilling out under the unforgiving Afghan sun. He'd not make the mistake of begging again.
"Of course, you're just the type," the man said. He did something with his brows that made him appear, somehow, even more smug.
He'd risked a glance over at Rosie, who had clambered up on top of a filing cabinet and was examining an old chess set with much interest.
He hoists Rosie into his arms, because it still makes him nervous to see her on those narrow steep stairs. They've timed it perfectly, are stepping out onto Baker Street just as Sherlock is stepping up to the door.
Plot-wise, at this point in the story Mary is meant to have killed Moriarty. Her actions bring her to the attention of the authorities, and her identity is compromised. Mycroft pulls some strings, and Mary and John are offered placement in a witness protection program. Sherlock has come to see them off.
John looked. There was a dark patch on the ceiling, sagging and dripping. The floorboards creaked and groaned in protest beneath Bell's feet. There was a crumbling stone fireplace in the corner, cold and dark and cobwebbed.
"It never occurred to me, really," John says. "And that's my fault. I should have known. I should have noticed. It—it bothered you, being back there. It bothered you more than it bothered me."
"John, I realize that my—vows are worthless to you," Sherlock said. "But please believe me when I tell you that I will always want—I will always want you by my side."
"So what's the verdict?" John asked, looking at him with his brows raised, a smug little smile on those lips (and he'd tasted those lips, now, and very much wanted to do so again.)
Sherlock gave a frustrated huff. "What more do you want? A formal invitation? A rental agreement? Champagne?"
"I—" Sherlock pauses, clears his throat. His fingers find the edge of his jacket and tug at it. "I am not often given to flights of fancy. But. Being here, it—"
That made John think of the laboratory at Barts, of Sherlock lifting his head and meeting John's gaze for the first time, the air between them alive with promise. That was most decidedly not something he wanted to be thinking about.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and he set Rosie down on the ground so he could answer it, taking her hand and maneuvering her over towards the dairy.
"That was one of the longest nights of my life," John said, his voice cutting into Sherlock's thoughts. He kept his gaze fixed on the window.
"That can't be—you can't mean that. Not the way I—" John stops, licks his lips. Sherlock can nearly taste it. "Not the way I want you to."
