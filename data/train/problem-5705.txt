“You’re distracting me on purpose! I expected better of you Mr. America.” He turns away, feigning disappointment and crossing to the floor to ceiling windows at the back of the room.
The one thing Steve never wants to do is scare the people he loves, so he backed off. He’s still in the past. This is how things are today, fighting it is selfish. I get control because I deserve it she reminds him, you don’t. And she’s right.
Sometimes control is breakfast, or packing lunch. Sometimes Steve gets a schedule for the week, things neatly planned out for him. Sometimes it’s a too tight grip on his hand if he lingers talking to Natasha or Pepper.
Steve swallows hard, shifting the towel and trying to hide his reaction. “Tony?” The roaming eyes snap up to meet his own, tongue darting out to wet his lips. “What- what do you..?”
“Okay.” Tony says hoarsely, nodding. “You’re right.” Steve sways back with relief, already feeling Sharon’s hold on him lessen.
Trembling legs nearly send him to the ground three times as they cross the living room, giving out just as he goes to sit on the couch. Hot chocolate splashes up his arms and into his lap, but he can’t bring himself to care. “She’s been cheating.”
“Sweetheart no, you are absolutely good enough, far too good for me.” He pulls her in close, feeling her shoulder shake and rocking himself back and forth.
“I love you.” Steve murmurs, leaning up to kiss Tony gently. Humming softly, Tony’s arms come up around Steve’s neck, pulling himself closer. Steve laughs “fuckin’ octopus,” quietly, but he loops one arm loosely around the brunette’s waist and brings him closer.
Tony looks around, checking for company before leaning closer. “Steve got with Sharon-“ Bucky wrinkles his nose “-I know. She’s a manipulative bitch. She’s been fucking with Cap’s brain for months, he won’t listen to me- us. He won’t listen to us.”
When Steve wakes, he’s alone, but the bed is still warm so Tony can’t have gone far. Sun streaming through the windows tells him he slept through his morning run, but he’s pretty sure he’d earned a day off.Slowly, Steve gets out of bed, making his way into the hallway.
Dropping his gaze and turning away, he apologizes again. “Really Tony, I’m sorry for waking you, I’ll just....” He gestures behind him and turns to leave. Tony grabs his wrist and, even though he’s gentler then need be, Steve flinches.
———————————
Pain. Hurt. Shock. Steve reels back, “O-Of, of course-“ he shakes his head. “Tony you’re not trapped here.” Slowly moving back, giving his wide-eyed, petrified partner a clear path to the door and when Tony scrambles to shaky legs and stumbles out of the bedroom he doesn’t follow. Chasing someone who was scared and angry was a sure-fire way to make sure they stayed both ways.
“I don’t cheat.” Tony jumps, spinning around and throwing a wrench at whoever or whatever managed to get into his lab. Steve ducks, narrowly avoiding having his head taken off.
He looks to the floor, “leave me alone?” He starts in a shaking voice “stop, stop...” he struggles for the words under Tony’s patient stare “propositioning me?” He finishes lamely.
But then, the genius relaxes, a seductive smirk quirking at the corner of his lips. He holds one hand out for Steve to take.
Steve fumbles for the phone, shaking swiping and holding it to his ear. He can hear himself gasping into the receiver.
He’s on the ground now, Steve braced over him. It’s almost comical, considering they were in almost the same position last week, under drastically different circumstances. Looking up at him now, there’s no trace of the gentle touches, deep kisses and kind praises found there before.
He cannot stop himself from reaching out and squeezing one of her hands. “I’m not but this is important. I’ll be back. I promise.”
“We’ll enroll her in one of the schools nearby and get her into a science club or something. I don’t know. But I don’t want her to grow up like I did.”
“…….thiiiiiiiiii-,” She slowly starts to raise her right hand. Tony subtly points to her other one and she puts that one up instead. “-iis one!
A shiver runs down Tony’s spine. “Because you seem adamant on ignoring the existence of certain machines designed to make our lives easier.”
“I’ll be on your team,” Sam says as he tries to clean off a spot on the table big enough to continue his breakfast.
so I can have more time for you darlings!
The tech spins around on him. “Well next time you want to kill someone in their dreams, DON’T PICK AN INSOMNIAC!”
“In those trees,” she mumbles still avoiding eye contact.
Tony moves up and down the thick length in gradual quickening movements. Steve lays back and lets him take control but makes sure to grind against him every time their flesh slaps together. Soon Tony is hunched forward and moaning into his husband’s eager mouth, bouncing up and down. Bursts of color flash behind his eyelids every time Steve’s dick slams into his prostate. Steve wraps his arms around him to hold him close. Then Tony is groaning and jerking against him as hot cum spirts between them. As the inventor goes limp Steve rolls them and starts pistonning into the pliant body below him, watching Tony’s blissed out face for any discomfort. When Tony sneaks a hand around and pops a finger past Steve’s puckered hole, he starts a deep grind, pressing Tony into the mattress. As a shiver runs down his spine and settles at the base, Steve has just enough time to bury his face in the mattress beside Tony’s head to shout his release. He shivers and jerks as he comes down from his high.
Tony could be lying about his intentions; this could be an ambush.
Steve is working late in his office. Maria tells him that even Fury took breaks, but Steve doubts Maria believes that herself.
Inside is an Iron Man hoodie pajama set, printed with colors and shapes corresponding to Tony’s full armor. There’s even a glow-in-the-dark arc reactor in the middle of the chest, and the hood has an extra bit of mesh printed with the faceplate hanging from it to pull down. Tony grins and puts it on over his tee, leaving it unzipped so his arc reactor glows through.
And Steve still left to carry on without him.
A SHIELD team, the Mighty Avengers, and the Secret Avengers converge on a Skrull ship that’s crashed in the Savage Land. It’s an eerie echo of when the New Avengers came here; they’re even close to where Tony landed the Quinjet that day, only for it to get smashed by a Tyrannosaurus rex. Steve wouldn’t have expected the memory to be one he’d look back on with fondness.
Steve wouldn't leave him somewhere with no one to look after him. Not if there was any choice. Even if Steve hated him, he wouldn't deny anyone medical care. And whatever Tony's done, whatever Steve thinks of him, he was here, and he was speaking to Tony, and he promised he'd be back. That's more than when Tony woke up in Oklahoma.
or scary librarian like Madame Pince in Harry Potter?

An hour into the film, Sam excused himself to take a phone call. Vision went to make more popcorn. Wanda followed him, the two chatting about Sokovian street gangs. Rhodes was not in attendance; he was on a date with Captain Carol Danvers, the Avengers’ Air Force liaison.

He accepts the bottle and takes a long pull of it. It tastes faintly of white tea and ginger. Carol watches him, then nods, her mouth twisting. “Okay,” she says. “We don’t have to talk.”
He almost doesn't hear Doom's careful footsteps across the sand. He manages to snatch the book from the ground before he reaches them. When he does, Doom stands over them, observing through his unreadable mask.

“Yeah, and it took
“Are you?”
He doesn’t even have to shower. He could stay like this all day.
“Sure it does.”
His body is Tony’s to have and to hurt. If Steve’s heart is broken, too, that’s his own doing, and when Tony grabs Steve’s collar, forcing his head back and cutting off his airway, the pain nearly matches inside and out.
He follows Steve to the door, and watches out of his peripheral vision as Steve punches a code into a keypad by the door. The sequence is just nine characters long, but there are both letters and numbers; there’s a lot of room for error, and without concentrating on it, Tony can’t be sure he has all of it right.
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” Tony says, and he could be talking about the war. He could be talking about Steve holding him. “I knew you’d hate the Act, I knew we’d—argue—but I didn’t think it would be a war.”
- One of the more polite words for a queer man in the late 19th century
“I just.” Steve closes his eyes. Now that Tony’s here, it’s overwhelming to look at him. The reality of seeing him and speaking to him is staggering. “You’re back, and I thought I’d never—I won’t mention it again. I can’t lose you again. But I haven’t stopped thinking. Since you were gone. Would you—have you ever wanted me?”
“Did Dr. Suresh retire?”
After a dozen rounds of that, vivid, solid-looking holograms fill the entire room, the gravity falls, and they’re swimming in an alien ocean. There are shipwrecks with quartzes growing out of their prows, pods of almost-whales trailing tresses of tails like seadragons, glittering fish that dart between and nip at their fingers, treasure chests containing bioluminescent jellyfish-esque creatures that spiral around them like synchronized swimmers. They swim through forests of seaweed that rise taller than redwoods, ride on the back of a chartreuse half-frog half-alligator, wind through labyrinthine caves with walls of undulating coral and budding geodes.
Wormseed is getting into a rip-snorting row with old Virgle Groslin, a trader in fine and unusual goods who’s in and out of Timely every fortnight with new trinkets to peddle. They’re getting into it, Virgle raising a ruckus and Wormseed holding himself stiller than molasses in January.
“But.” Steve doesn’t actually have a follow-up. He swallows.
This is his home. This is what Steve has left: his world, his fury, and his teammates. A thrum of rage beats just out of sync with his pulse. This is his advantage.
“Well, you won’t do it again, will you?”
The grip on Tony’s chin tightens. Steve leans in and smiles. “Yes, you will.”
The knife is not a large one, and quite narrow, but it’s sharper than obsidian and it’s pressed against Wormseed’s neck before the sentence is all the way out of his mouth. “You care to repeat that?” Tony hisses.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist and nods into Tony’s chest.
“Won’t last long.”
The next morning he sits at his usual spot at the inn’s attached diner, watching people walk their dogs, wait for the bus, and listen to music on their headphones. He thinks a woman across the street might be walking a potbellied pig on a leash.
“Tiberius Stone, billionaire, head of Viastone, one of the biggest media companies on the
He has to say it, all of it. “I’m
“That right?” Stark's eyes return to the bottle of whiskey. “Dunno as I’ve seen much here I ain’t seen a thousand times over.”
“Steve?” Friday says.
After their conversation, Tony takes to following Wormseed around town. It doesn’t take a bloodhound to sniff out that something’s awry about the man and his associates.
He has no idea what Tony’s going to do to him.
creepy
“Neither do I.” Steve’s voice is so quiet. Anger packed up into a quiet, tidy little package.
Steve takes Tony’s hand as they step, together, toward it, and thinks that this time, they really do feel the same way about things.
In which Steve enjoys his new toy and Tony... also enjoys Steve's new toy? In a manner of speaking? Also featuring: the role of Captain America; Friday attempting to be helpful; and improvements to Tony's prosthetic arm, but not the improvements to the nanite network he really needs.
He keeps the cookies on his lap while he opens the presents. Amora’s is a homemade liqueur—or so she claims. Stephen’s gift is a charm that he promises will protect Tony from whatever’s really in the so-called liqueur. Amora pouts. After a few more gifts—a 22-pound wheel of Monterey Jack from Carol, a box of roasted acorns from Doreen, and a growler of artisan beer from Thor Odinson—she leaves.
“No one,” Tony says. What does Steve want from him? Why is he dragging this out?
about what your relationship means for the world. They’re just eating you up.”
It’s barely five feet, but Steve lands hard. Too hard. He lands twisted up wrong, one knee bruised through his jeans, a scrape on his face, winded.
Steve squints. “How’re they supposed to come ‘n get their book if it turns up?”
and we thought we saw this, idk, faceless being behind some of the shelves so we went to the reception desk to talk to a librarian and I rang the little bell on the desk
“I know doll, that’s what I’ve got you for, right?” He almost doesn’t see her hand move before it clips the back of his head with enough force to send ringing through his ear for a second.
Steve just nods, pressing his knuckles hard into his thighs to stop his hands from shaking. The bed is soft and warm, nothing like the cold snow or the metal arm wrapped around his throat. Tony scoots back, dimming the lights again and reaches out. “C’mon honey, I dunno about you but I could use a few more hours.”
She doesn’t come into the living room, so Steve cautiously wanders into the bedroom. He pushes the door open slowly only to have it slammed in his face.
“Now why would I do that when I have you?” Steve watched in fond amusement as Tony checks their plane. While watching Tony do anything is a treat watching him work when he knows exactly what he’s doing is a goddamn gift.
The apartment is lonely on its own, but Steve fiddles with his phone until something new and loud starts playing. His shoulders feel heavy, his feet dragging. Maybe an early night will make whatever dark cloud hanging over his head disappear.
“O-Kay...?” Steve drawls slowly, not quite understanding. Tony says a lot, and a lot of it isn’t understandable, most of it comes out wrong. It’s his unique brand of charm.
“Not always a bad thing Cap, if you need some time to think, or just, be, I’ve got an old movie we can watch, you don’t havfta pay attention or anything.”
Tony locks his fingers around Steve’s side, stroking his thumb back and forth, leaving a tingling trail of warmth. “I’ll be okay,” Steve mutters, both to Tony and himself. Tony drops his cheek to Steve’s hair and plants a soft kiss to the top of his head.
“On second thought, maybe I’ll just.... put these back.” Steve’s head snaps up at Tony’s strange tone. He freezes at the heated expression his friend wears, roaming eyes nearly black as he stares openly.
——————————
It should be weird, he knows that. But then manicured nails stroke down his cheek, Sharon tells him that it’s fine, so he believes her.
The movie is old, and bad, and Tony plays on his phone instead of paying attention. But it reminds Steve of home, his old home in old Brooklyn and warmth he hasn’t felt in months settles his aching body and lulls him slowly into contentment.
“Makes her uncomfortable when people touch me.” He quietly explains trying to ease her wounded expression. It doesn’t work and Sam inhales sharply on his other side.
The lights flash bright and die out, leaving him alone in the dark. Ice water seeping in, the plane slowly sinking. Icy water soaks his boots, creeping up his calves, over his knees. He may have survived the crash, but looking around, Steve realizes there’s no way out of this plane. He’s going to die.
Steve went into the ice as one person, and came out as another, that used to be a bad thing. But now? With a team that trusts him, and the smartest, bravest and kindest man passed out on his chest? The ice might actually have been the best thing that ever happened to him.
Sharon sniffs and pulls back, taking a moment to fix her makeup before turning dry eyes back to him. “Damn right. You’re a selfish asshole Steve.” She flowers and he ignores the chest pangs to nod along.
Sam steps up, pulling Tony back a step. “Easy man, take a breath.” He leans to murmur something in the genius’s ear and Tony turns on his heel, disappearing from the room. “He’s right. It’s not your fault, but she’s getting away with some pretty bad shit Cap.”
”, Steve struggles away from The Soldier, desperate to keep the one person he can’t live without, alive. The Soldier grabs his shoulder, keeping him from getting to Tony. Throwing back an elbow that connects with nothing, Steve pushes through thick snow.
Tony glances around, still nothing. “Look, can we get out of here? This place gives me the heebie jeebies.” His voice comes out strong, but Steve frowns, holding a hand out and stepping closer. Tony glances around again, something on the rooftop to his right glints.
“Dumbass.”
Despite that, when the bill came it was inevitably placed in front of Steve, who bit back laughter at Tony’s face and not-so-quietly muttered ‘motherfucker.’ When Tony reaches for the bill, somewhat grumpily, Steve stops him.
“There is nothing wrong with you Steve.” Tony murmurs into his ear, pressing Steve’s face gently into his shoulder and clinging hard. “You’re just too good. People take advantage of that.” They’re not talking about the past anymore, but Steve can’t bring himself to feel defensive, his cheek still burns, the claw marks across his shoulders and arms still sting. He’s too raw to handle anything else.
———————————
Slowly, things will get better, just because it’s hard right now doesn’t mean it will be hard forever. One day you will wake up happy, completely happy beside someone you love and who loves you and you will realize that every bloody, sweaty, tear-filled breakdown was worth it. Suddenly, things won’t seem so hard anymore.
Steve does that a lot, he’s accepted he doesn’t really understand today, and Sharon does, she’s right. She’s always right and he always listens, accepts her superiority, smiles and doesn’t let it bug him. It shouldn’t, times have changed and he hasn’t caught up. Won’t catch up, she reminds him, that’s why you have me.
Sharon carefully puts in her earrings, dressed far too nicely to be going in for a briefing. “Where are you going?” Steve tries not to let desperation into his tone, but he’s barely seen her in the past few weeks and when he has they’ve just been arguing.
Steve didn’t get it before, the obsession with sex and love, how couples seem to practically glow in each other’s presence.
Stomach twisting, Steve opens his mouth to reply, his face starting to heat up. A knock on the door saves them both from an argument. Tony is up in a second, scrambling for pants. Steve isn’t far behind, ignoring dull pains to pull a pair of sweatpants up his hips.
“Got them all?” Steve asks into his com set, affirmations echo from his teammates. Tony does a final sweep, clear. Something feels off. Dread crawling up his spine, sending goosebumps across his skin. He scans again, still clear.
Steve chews at his lower lip, reaching for the door twice before pulling it open. “Uh, thanks Tony.” He mutters, keeping his eyes low.
“Sorry honey, what was that?”
She stands gracefully to kiss his cheek. “Look after yourself first, Steve, anyone else can wait.” And she walks out.
Unjustified anger surges. “What about what I want!? huh?! I’m so goddamn sick of hearing about what I need and don’t need, what about what I want Tony? Don’t I deserve that?” With his outburst done, Steve wants to crawl back into the bathroom and hide, Tony looks shattered, brown eyes glassy, lips drawn into a tight line as he nods.
He shrugs in an awkward display of nonchalance, “uh, yeah, sure Mr. Stark.” His voice is squeaky and confused but Tony just flashes a grin and grabs a set of keys, leaving Peter to follow him dazedly out of the lab.
Licking his lips, Tony shifts to face Steve more, keeping his eyes downcast. “Steve, Honey, I want to, believe me,” his eyes flicker up, and then back down. “But you’re not in the right state of mind to be getting into a-a, another relationship.”
“Shuddup and kiss me, Soldier.”
From: Iced Cap: Will u be home 4 dinner?
He doesn’t know if he’d even make it to the door, Steve’s big, fast and strong. “please.” He pleads in a shaking, broken voice. His vision blurred enough that Steve nearly disappears.
It’s easier to recover with people who love you. People who congratulate you on every success and hold you through ever failure. People who remind you that failure is a part of progress and it doesn’t mean you can’t continue. People who hold you tight and promise to keep trying, promise to help you keep trying.
“Nah,” Tony brushes him off, sitting up slowly. “I’m Iron Man, takes a lot more than a bad dream to hurt me. Take a minute, catch your breath Spangles.” His voice goes soft, slowly signalling for JARVIS to dimly illuminate the room.
Suddenly self conscious, Steve wraps an arm around his stomach. “Gotta watch my figure.” He goes for the joke, which flops. Bucky arches an eyebrow disbelieving.
“Steve!” Tony cries out, reaching a shaking hand out for Steve, pleading for help. The Soldier wraps flesh arm around Steve’s chest, holding him tight. “Steve! Stop!” Tony’s voice comes from The Soldier, freezing Steve where he kneels.
“It was an
“I know that, I mean you’re not a rebound for me, I- I don’t want you to be a rebound.” He swallows hard, mouth dry. Tony stops, frowning down at the sheets. Steve squeezes his hand harder, afraid that if he lets go this will be it for them.
The door reopens again half an hour later and Sharon stalks out, not even glancing over at Steve. “I’m sorry honey, really.” He stands slowly, keeping himself hunched in when Sharon spins on her toes to glare.
“No, nonononono Steve, fuck, no don’t do this. Don’t do this to me.” He’s talking, hands fluttering uselessly around the lifeless body of his Captain. They’re trembling worse than leaves. He’s dimly aware of hands on his shoulders, fingers wiping blood,
He tries to articulate how he feels, how he wants to crawl out of his own skin, back into Brooklyn, back into his 5ft Nothing skinny ass where people didn’t know who he was. Sharon tells him that it’s in the past he needs to be in the now.
“You’re still on about that? Jesus Tony get over yourself! No one cares about what you do in bed!” Maybe too loud, if the staring and whispering us anything to go by. But Steve focuses on the slow, wry grin taking over his partner’s face.
Steve doesn’t understand. It’s not about him. Why don’t they understand his needs aren’t always important? Other people have needs too.
“Remember who you’re talking to!” Sharon sharply reprimands. As if he could forget. Looking down for the first time Steve can tell that the too long shirt knotted at her stomach isn’t his. But the shoulders are ill fitted and the sleeves dangle too low to be hers. “That’s what I came to ask you.”
“I’m so sorry, you’re so good to me and I’ve been a selfish asshole-“ again, Tony cuts him off with a hand over his mouth, gentle, nothing like the hot scratches of manicured fingernails.
“I need to borrow you.” He looks up from the still blank page on his sketchbook to Tony fidgeting in front of him. He looks like hell, dark circles under his eyes, skin drawn and tired.
His lungs give out, when did he get across the room? Back pressed against a wall, Steve crouching in front of him, hands held out placatingly. “Tony, I need you to breathe doll, slow and steady.” Tony pulls his knees to his chest, trying to get his legs under him steady enough to make it to the door.
“Motherfucker.” Tony curses sympathetically and sits beside him, dabbing at the hot liquid on his arms so they don’t blister. “How’d you find out?” He asks softly.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “This? The talking? Or do you mean the cuddling on the couch? Or is it the dinner dates? Or the Waffle House? How could I ever get the wrong idea.” He scoffs, shaking his head. “I don’t know who you think I am Captain, but I’m not a home wrecker. Don’t worry, your shitty relationship isn’t in danger. Well..... at least not from me.”
Steve sends back a heart and Tony rolls his eyes. He reassures Peter that, yes Steve would love to help him out and no, he wouldn’t be a burden, and after that, Peter seems to perk up again. The ice cream disappears far too fast, and Peter starts picking at Tony’s when he thinks the genius isn’t looking.
“Don’t want me to what?” Tony asks slowly, eyes narrowing to watch Steve with laser precision. Steve shifts in place, chewing his bottom lip again.
Steve resumes rubbing his back, tracing his fingertips in casual patterns. “We were cleaning up after, something, something was wrong, you, uhm-“ Steve can feel Tony shudder and threads his fingers through his partner’s hair, crooning encouragements. Tony mumbles something unintelligible, fingers digging into the skin of Steve’s sides.
“Just once can you not embarrass me by flirting with the first whore who looks your way?”
Slowly casting his blank page aside, Steve stands. “Of course.” He keeps his voice low and gentle, not just to keep from waking Sharon, who’s asleep on the other side of the couch, but because the genius gets jumpy when he doesn’t sleep.
Stomach in knots, Tony lands the suit six feet away from Steve, mask flipping back and muggy air replacing air conditioning. No wonder Steve is coated in sweat. With a lopsided grin reminiscent of a puppy Steve pulls his helmet off and shakes his hair out.
The white cotton threads have off white stains that don’t fit the pattern, and pink lipstick stains on the collar. His stomach revolts, she wouldn’t, it’s just, from an undercover stint, it has to be.
Tony huffs “yeah and I promised to stop eating dairy, but Ben and Jerry’s named a flavour after me so-“ he shrugs “- promises get broken sometimes.”
It’s not an excuse, simply an explanation. In most cases, those needs are physical and not needs so much as wants. Sometimes, people seek out deeper emotional attachments, because they’re not getting the intimacy they need.
—————————
She’s new there’s no denying that. Latest fashions, latest devices, always up to date with everything. Whenever he mentions it, she smiles and tells him that one of them has to be and it’s not going to be him. But she’s old too. The way her lips quirk up into a smirk when she’s right is so undeniably Peggy, it makes his chest hurt.
“You’re the one with the reputation.” Hurt flickers across Tony’s mask, he reels backwards and flicks his tongue across his lips.
Tony blinks for a minute before shrugging and flopping onto the couch beside Steve, curling up under his arm immediately and humming contentedly. “‘Kay.” He mumbles in a delayed response.
“Honey I’d be taking advantage of you, I’m not what you need right now.” Tony looks down, shoulder slumping. What he needs? Flashes of Sharon telling him what he needs, what she needs and what he doesn’t need disorient him.
“Captain Rogers, Agent Carter requires your presence upstairs.” Even FRIDAY sounds pissy in a way an AI shouldn’t. He’s on his feet automatically, wincing at the lights. Natasha makes the same face Tony did in the elevator.
“You’re something else Stark.” When Tony comes back he grins, leaning up to kiss Steve’s cheeks chastely.
Steve works his jaw, “I need m’stuff” He mumbles, thinking of the sketchbooks and photo albums he has on the coffee table. Tony tugs gently at Steve’s hair, humming in agreement.
“Shit, sorry Tasha.” His voice trembles as he drops his eyes to the luxuriously threaded blanket draped over him. Tony must have moved him to the couch at some point. Steve fidgets with the edge, fingers shaking while he focuses on anything other than the redhead perching on the arm of the couch beside him.
“Please let me go, let me leave, please.” He can’t even recognize his own voice, blood roaring through his ears, throat constricting, heart desperately trying to escape his heavy chest. Steve’s expression morphs and for a second Tony can’t move, unable to look away from the changing expression, terrified of what it’s going to become.
————————
“Yeah we did a social experiment on it last week.” Peter looks mindlessly over the ice cream in the freezers, like he’s commented on the weather and not gay sex. The girl behind the counter giggles as Tony sputters, suddenly remembering his date on Monday night when the waiter had placed the cheque down in front of Steve, despite the fact that Tony is the known billionaire.
He falters forward a step. “Buck, you know I tried.” His voice is small, a scared kid from Brooklyn all over again. The shield feels too big, the uniform doesn’t fit, he doesn’t belong here.
“Honey, I’d be crazy to say no.”
She rocks back on her heels, chin snapping back. “What did you say?” Low and meant to intimidate him, it’s her ‘you’re in shit’ voice and it has Steve swallowing convulsively.
They sit for a long while in silence, absorbing contact from one another. At some point, the elevator dings and Tony shuffles in, sleep deprived and rumpled. “Don’t mind me.” He mumbles out, stumbling across the living room.
“Oh fuck.” Things fall into place, all those midnights sneaking in, with Sharon whispering that she’s sorry for being late again. The way they haven’t had sex in months, haven’t even shared more than a kiss in three weeks.
Closing in on Steve’s location he breaks out in a cold sweat. Something is
Steve gets the gut deep feeling that he’s fucked up when Tony turns on his heel, waves a hand in the air, cuing the music to blare louder than before.
“Doll is old.” Sharon snaps, rolling her eyes. “and you’re never going to catch up if you keep yourself in the past. Come on, let’s get lunch.” She hates when he says old things, says they keep him in the past. She reaches out, beckoning for him and risking as his shaking hand takes hers. “Hiding won’t help you catch up.”
When she gets more dressed up than usual to go out at night he can’t question it, it’s always confidential, she’s a spy what does he expect? Jealousy has no place in SHIELD and Steve knows that.
Steve frowns, rebound? Equal parts panic and shame twist in his stomach, of course that’s what Tony thinks, if the situation was reversed Steve would think the same thing.
————————————
He turns his back on Tony, leaving the workshop with his tail tucked and shame building in his chest.
Steve lifts his hands to let his genius settle in and fondly smiles to himself as Tony flips around to stare at him. He hasn’t been sleeping enough, Steve notes, poorly concealed dark rings under his eyes and wrinkles that seem to get worse the less he sleeps. Faint smudges of black that could be motor oil, or grease, that he tried to wipe away speak to what the genius does while Steve sleeps.
“Did you know that people assume you’re the top?” His voice is almost accusatory, Steve doesn’t flinch. He simply places his finger down on the page to hold his place and looks up with squinty eyed confusion.
“Sharon, sweetheart, there is no one else. I promise you. It was a mistake. I’m sorry.” He reaches for her, trying not to let the hurt show when she smacks his hand away.
In this century women don’t like being pushed around. Steve didn’t know they were pushed around before, Peggy certainly wasn’t. Today, women get to be in control.
Steve slowly maneuvers them back horizontal on the bed, rubbing one hand up and down Tony’s back despite the drying sweat. “Wanna talk ‘bout it?” He’s quiet and soothing, not serious or demanding and he doesn’t react when Tony shakes his head. “Alright honey, go back to sleep, I’ve gotcha.” He murmurs as he pulls the blankets back up over them, rolling onto his back and pulling Tony on top of him.
Even as he steps out he can feel her marks, branding him, keeping him pinned under her like a dragon hoarding its treasure. His muscles and skin and bones feeling weirdly like they don’t really belong to him after all.
Steve hates how the events make him jumpy for days, stuck in oversensitive skin. He doesn’t want to hold hands, or hug, let alone have sex. But events do the opposite for Sharon. She hates sharing, needs the reassurance that Steve is hers. So, he deals with scratches that feel like gashes, bite marks far too painful to even be considered pleasurable. Hot skin against his, like he’s being burned. It can’t always be about you she tells him I have needs too.
“Clingy” before leaving again.
Steve doesn’t respond. He just leaves, stalking right past Tony braced against a wall in the hallway, breathing hard and wheezing pitiful whimpers. They just don’t understand.
“You don’t need to thank me.” Tony stares where the blankets barely cover his hips. “Trust me.” And then, like he shakes himself mentally, his eyes snap up, face suddenly serious. “Lots of people need a good rebound after shit like that, I was more than happy to help out.” The barest hint of a lewd smile on his lips.
Dirt and fire explode to his left, someone yells. He can’t tell who, he doesn’t know if they’re hurt, dead, captured. He can’t even tell if they’re on the same side or not. He can barely get the shield up in time when someone shoots at him, the ringing echos into his ears.
Steve pulls the towel up higher and swallows hard against his embarrassment. “I mean, I want every fucking trace of her gone.” He shudders at the ghost of nails over his shoulders. “And, and I’ve seen how you look at me, and-“ he looks Tony over again. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the same.” He tastes blood when he bites down particularly hard on his lip, although it heals immediately.
Tony slowly pulls his hand back. “Stop. That’s her talking, not you. You haven’t done anything wrong. Understand?” Steve nods, stunned into silence for probably the first time ever. Tony’s expression softens even more, “you don’t have a clue what she’s done to you, do you?” The compassion in his voice brings tears to the corners of Steve’s eyes as he shakes his head.
“Classified. I probably won’t be home until late, don’t be so nosy.” She admonishes, fluffing her hair and double checking her lipstick before strutting over to slide on heels.
Tony’s eyes widen “Shit, Steve I’m sorry, you’re here having the worst day of your life, and here I am, propositioning you.” He shakes his head and thrusts the clothes out. “Here, I’ll leave you alone now, you know where I am if you need anything.”
“Steve, honey, can you let me go?” A soft voice asks from under him. Steve looks around frantically, where did Bucky go? Where did The Soldier go? He looks down, staring into wide, startled eyes.
Tony frowns slightly, glancing around at nothing. “Unless, unless you were joking, I mean, I’ll just-“ Steve reaches for the clothes in Tony’s hand, and the genius yanks them back without looking away from some hideous painting.
It is possible to live a happy life in the wake of abuse, and it is worth every second of work.
The shield doesn’t hit his face, lodging itself deep in the reactor, and thank god it isn’t powering his heart anymore. In a blur, Steve and Bucky are gone, leaving Tony alone in the dropping temperatures. The suit is dead, he’s going to die here. Alone, the only good thing left in his life gone, leaving behind the shield that reminds him how he’ll never be as good as his father. It’s fitting.
Tony waits until they’re in the hallway to speak. “What I said earlier came out wrong.” He doesn’t look up when he talks, staring at his shoe scuffing the floor.
“Tones.” Steve calls softly, holding an arm out when the genius looks at him. “C’mere.” A moment of bravery invites him into their space.
“Just because I’m dating you doesn’t mean you get to be a perv about it.” Steve flinches but nods, bad call on his part. Not that he was trying to be a perv, but clearly that’s how he came across.
————————————-
He picks up her shirt and a tangy cologne wafts up from it, far too cheap to be Steve’s own, his is a gift from Tony. Tony, whose name sends lightning bolts through Steve’s chest.
“Wha’s goin’ on with’im?” Bucky asks, watching Steve all but bolt from the room at one word from FRIDAY.
“Yeah, you’re gonna be okay.”
Steve sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose and pressing outwards. “People talk Honey, that’s what they do. What they say has no impact on who I am or what I do.”
Hushed voices slowly bring Steve back to consciousness, he didn’t even notice himself drifting off. “What did she do to you?” Sympathetic and gentle, gentle like the pointed nails scrapping gently across his scalp. Anticipating the pain of fingers gripping his hair or nails digging deep into his scalp, Steve bolts up.
Both men freeze, a look of cautious hope taking over Tony’s face while Steve nearly trembles with nerves, looking all too ready to bolt.
Even with Steve’s arms around his waist, his strong heartbeat keeping time, it takes a long time for Tony to be able to close his eyes without seeing the hollow blue green eyes lifeless and spattered with blood.
Sam touches his arm, capturing his sole attention with the gentleness of the touch. “You’ve been pretty depressed man, something’s going on.”
Flat On The Floor
“Watch your fucking mouth Stark, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Steve! come on. You’re done here.” She glares daggers over Tony’s shoulder, and Tony jerks his head up, squaring his shoulders.
“Ready to go back to bed?” Steve nods after a moment, waiting for the question to process. Tony turns off the water and steps out of the shower, drying himself quickly before turning his attention back to Steve. He drops slowly to one knee, down his legs gently.
Now that she’s gone, every muscle in his body shakes, he’s freezing, it’s like an out of body experience, on one level, he’s freaking out, terrified of retaliation and terrified of not being with her, he doesn’t think he knows how to live without her. On another level, he’s already compartmentalizing.
Those clever fingers trial down his jaw, lifting until Steve looks up. “Your nightmares aren’t going to scare me away Steve. I’m not going anywhere.” He smiles gently, thumb swiping across Steve’s lower lip. Steve can’t fight the fond smile, and he doesn’t want to.
Steve shakes his head, but lets Tony talk. “I said, he’s not going anywhere with you.” Murderously low, Tony’s voice fills the room. “Get out of my apartment.” Short and commanding, there’s no room for argument and Steve feels the knot in his chest unravel slightly.
Tony straightens, taking Steve’s face between his hands and forcing the soldier to look him in the eyes. “None of this was your fault. She’s a manipulative, lying, cheating bitch.” Steve lets out a crazed, hysterical giggle and nods.
Tony gently places his hand over Steve’s mouth. “We can deal with that all later. You need to shower, get warm, and get some sleep. I’ll take care of your things and get someone to fix up your old room.” Steve slumps into him again, guilty and thankful at the same time. He remembers just how mean he’s been to Tony lately, and how kind Tony has been in response.
“I’m tired Steve. I can talk to you later but right now I need sleep. So just, shh, for a bit, please?” He shuts up with a short nod, telling her about Bucky’s homecoming can wait. She heads to their bedroom, and strips, curling under the blankets and falling asleep.
Tony gives a short, humourless laugh. “And where were you last night, Miss Carter?” Steve had nearly forgotten he was here, so focused on keeping his hands from shaking and his knees from giving out.
Morning light filters through tinted windows, warming burgundy sheets. Steve definitely missed his morning run, but with Tony tracing abstract patterns across his chest, he can’t find it in himself to mind.
It pours rain the whole jog to the tower, just like in a cliche rom-com, and Steve is drenched by the time the elevator reaches the top floor. Tony is waiting in front of the doors tp has suite, probably informed by FRIDAY, with a towel and a mug of hot chocolate.
Realization doesn’t dawn on him, it hits him like a dump truck after lunch. Tony made an appearance, grabbed a mug of coffee and accepted a plate of sliced fruits from Natasha. When he turned back around, entirely ignoring Steve, he nearly walks right into Bucky’s chest.
Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders, “Nat brought over everything she could find, did you keep anything hidden?” Steve forces himself to relax as soon as he tenses up, but Tony picks up on it anyways. “It’s alright Honey, you’re not gonna be in trouble or anything we just wanna make sure we’ve got everything.”
Sharp nails in his arm startle him enough that he hits the wall, but Sharon doesn’t apologize. “What did Stark want?” She demands, glaring at the closed elevator doors.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me.” He whimpers like a broken record, giving voice to the words circling his brain. Tony takes his hand, leading him towards the massive bathroom beside his bedroom.
Bucky raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment on the slip up. “Dumbass.” He mutters, downing the rest of the whiskey and setting the cup gently on the coffee table.
Nails dig into his forearm, tearing into the skin as Sharon pulls him away.
“I’m not like that. I don’t cheat.” Tony relaxes and observes his Captain. Steve is tense, fidgeting and visibly anxious.
—————————-
“No, Steve. I’m the asshole here okay? I’ll stop. You just-“ Tony gestures to him. “Get some sleep.”
“You don’t have to apologize.” Natasha pulls her hand back and slips off of the arm of the couch to tuck in beside him. “None of this is your fault Steve.” Steve shifts over to give her space, only to bump into Tony. He hadn’t even noticed the genius sit down.
She rests her hand gingerly on his shoulder, ready to yank back if Steve responds negatively. It takes too much effort to hide his flinch as manicured nails drop onto his bare skin. He knows, rationally, that it’s Natasha and there’s nothing she would do to hurt him, but on some level, Sharon is back, and those nails are about to dig into his skin until he does what she wants.
“What are you doing to yourself Cap?” Tony asks quietly before excusing himself.
Monday nights are date nights, Tony’s way of combatting the Monday blues. He had texted Steve earlier saying: Pizza tonight, authentic Italian place, I’ll pick you up. And Steve had been excited, there’s nothing authentically anything in New York other than American and sometimes it can be exhausting.
Motherfucker. “You know what-“ Tony cuts himself off when he catches the mischief in Peter’s eyes. “That’s conjecturing! That’s what that is.” Tony lets himself trail off, grumbling about unfair stereotypes the whole way back out to the car. Peter quickly changes the subject, getting distracted and rambling on.
He chews his lip, swallowing hard around the lump in his throat. “Is that a yes?” For a question that hasn’t really been asked, it hangs heavily in the air between them. For second, Steve thinks Tony might actually bolt.
Sharon is dedicated to her job and Steve admires that. He can’t be the most important thing in her life when she’s got a promising career.
Tony glares. “Jesus Christ Cap warn a man!” He sounds amused instead of annoyed, so Steve presses on.
Steve blinks, stunned. He didn’t think he was flirting, she was practically a kid, a brand new shield recruit, bright eyed and curious about everything. “I’m sorry.” He murmurs, staring at the ground.
“I’ve got you, you’re alright.” Tony murmurs, wrapping an arm around Steve’s shoulders and pulling him tightly against his side. Steve reaches out with shaking hands, wrapping his arms around familiar and warm and safe, burying his nose into Tony’s shoulder.
——————————————
Like a switch, as soon as he rinses his mouth out, the world snaps back into place, dull and colourless and utterly clear. Sharon doesn’t love him, she never did. She’s been using him, hurting him, manipulating him, for her own benefit or simply because she can, Steve isn’t sure. What he does know, is that that he needs to leave. And he knows exactly where to go.
Steve spends the next two hours on the couch sketching, she’s going to want him here when she wakes up and she hates any noises while she’s sleeping, so he draws in silence, barely noticing the way his sketches take on a hazel eyed brunette instead of a blue eyed blonde.
Lightbulb. “Yeah, that guy sucks.” Tony agrees, spooning more ice cream into his mouth. “Good thing you’ve got Mr. Walking History Textbook on speed dial.” Peter’s eyes go wide, his mouth falling open into a small ‘o’ shape.
The corners of Tony’s eyes soften when he looks at Steve, though his jaw clenches when he looks back to Sharon. “Nope.” He agrees, popping the p “but it is his.” He jerks a thumb in Steve’s direction. Steve, who swallows hard and jerks his chin up, with shaking hands buried in his pockets, he’s sure he looks more confident than he feels.
He doesn’t want to die. He’s barely done anything with his life, there’s so much left to do. Beeping bomb alerts finalize his fate. “I gotta put’er in the water.” Peggy begs him not to, says there’s other options. If he doesn’t people will die. He was meant for more that dancing in tights. Maybe this is it.
He gives a weak half-shrug, not admitting she’s right. Three press events in three days, and a gala. Every nerve ending is on fire. “I’ll be fine after some sleep.” Natasha doesn’t call him on his lie, but he can feel her eyes following the mostly faded bite-marks on his neck and collarbone.
He holds his hands out in a mockery of a placating gesture. “Hey, how about you stop bringing it up then? You came to me Rogers.” Tony’s voice is venomous as he stalks forwards to shove a finger in Steve’s chest.
“Defrost?” Tony frowns “Honey you’re not frozen anymore, is that what this was all about?” Steve shivers as the temperature drops, looking around. Pants are drenched and heavy, hanging low on his hips and curled around his feet are half of the bedsheets, trailing from the shower into the bathroom.
“Now that’s fucked up.”
Another warm hand on his shoulder this time, he turns to face Tony. “Cap, this isn’t okay.” He doesn’t know what this is, what’s happening, why they’re so close. Sharon isn’t going to like this. Natasha reaches for his knee, he jerks away.
Steve falls back, not even wincing when the wooden bed-frame smashes against his spine. His hearing hollows, vision tunnelling while he gasps for a solid breath.
Tony turns and holds a hand out for Steve to take. “You’re lucky I love you.” Again, his words contradict his face, voice and actions. Steve takes his hand and lets himself get pulled lovingly onto the plane.
Instantly guilty, Steve offers the snatched blanket back. “Sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to wake you up, I’m sorry.” He stumbles over his words in a rush to go back upstairs. Tony scrambles out of his blanket burrito to catch him.
“I’m changing! Where did your fucking manners go!?” Steve stumbles back, tripping over his words in a hasty apology. He retreats to the couch, heart racing while he waits. She’s never cared about privacy before, why now?
She stalks back towards the party, barely looking back. “Just… try to not be a complete embarrassment.”
“No, they really can’t.” He says to an empty room.
Steve smiles down at his lap, nodding. “I’d like that.”
“Yeah, I guess they only got it half right. You’re like a mostly-bottom” Steve agrees, wrapping an arm around Tony, who smirks, waving at a guy across the street who is staring and not at all subtly taking a photo. Steve also smile and waves, like he’s not talking about their sex life on the streets of Italy.
“You couldn’t save me, and you can’t save him.” Bucky calls Steve’s attention away. Tony kneels in the snow, trembling with a blade pressed to his throat. Steve’s blood turns to ice, the air suddenly gone from his lungs.
“STEVE!?!” Tony stumbles out of the suit, collapsing to the ground beside the motionless soldier. Blonde hair staining crimson. The others are yelling, Tony’s hearing fuzzes to white noise, someone screams, it could have been him.
“That’s not your business, Stark.” Is Sharon’s cool response, not even glancing away from Steve, leaving him pinned under her gaze. He looks to Tony for help, pleading with his eyes to get her out of here before his body betrays him.
He goes far enough to turn on the taps and adjust the temperature before talking. “There’s nothing wrong with you Steve. This is good for you, it’s all going to make more sense in the morning.” He casts one glance back at the shower before walking to the door. “Let me know if you need anything ba- buddy.” He coughs and escapes the bathroom in a flash.
“Morning golden boy.” Tony rasps in a voice thick with sleep. Steve tries, and fails, to hide his smile as he turns his head to look.
“You never loved me.” Steve chokes out the words before Tony can shove her through the doorway. Sharon stops in her tracks, schooling her expression into a cruel smile.
Steve melts into each touch, his brain fuzzing until his only thought is
Steve shakes his head. “No But’s, if you want to, what’s stopping you?” He wants to wrap his arms around himself, but he needs to hold the towel up, leaving him cold and exposed.
Steve kicks his ass into gear at Tony’s screech, nearly colliding with the brunette when he forgets about super serum speed. Tony stands rigid, hand frozen on the doorknob, half holding it open and half keeping it closed. “Tones, who is it?”
Tony crawls in first, grabbing the comforter from where it hit the ground in Steve’s haste to escape. Steve slides in beside him, pulling him close immediately. “I thought I was the clingy one here.” Tony laughs quietly, but allows himself to be manhandled into the super soldier’s lap.
“I am not-!” Steve arches an eyebrow “… They’re strangers! How does it not bother you!?” Tony switches tactics but squawks again at Steve’s nonchalant shrug.
He finds himself melting into the gentle embrace, curling up impossibly tight and drinking in warmth and affection. “Doesn’t feel like nothin’s wrong with me.” Tony squeezes tighter, surprisingly not coming at him with a joke or a comment about his relationship. Instead, he lets out a strangled, choked laugh.
Steve hits the ground before he’s fully awake, yanking away from the ice, it clings to him, tripping him as he bolts for the en suite bathroom. Too cold, limbs numb and frozen. He fumbles for the taps, there’s ice in his chest, clogging his lungs, making each breath agony.
To: Iced Cap: yeah, took Pete for ice cream. See you soon.
He doesn’t wait for a response, and Steve isn’t going to give one. Tony slips into the shower, still in his sleep pants, and hisses when he steps under the spray. “Shit Steve, you’re gonna melt your damn skin off.” Steve just frowns, watching Tony turn down the heat. How else is he supposed to defrost?
“Do you feel like ice cream? I feel like ice cream.” Peter freezes in place, bag dangling from his fingers
Tony stares down at him with a wide grin and a strange expression. “Uh, good, better than I have in awhile.” Then, with a wince, Steve tacks on: “thanks.” And tries to ignore how his body aches when he pushes himself up.
Tony slowly pushes himself up so he’s sitting against the headboard. “I, I get nervous and shut down, and I don’t talk, really, Steve, honey I’m a mess. I overreact and run away instead of dealing. I should have stayed, I know you won’t, do, anything, I do, but I didn’t and that’s not fair to you-“
“All that serum and you still couldn’t save me?” A smirk doesn’t fit on his face, not with what he’s saying but he smirks anyways. Steve’s heart drops, nausea swirling through his stomach.
Steve doesn’t want to sleep, he’s terrified of it, but with a needy genius curling up on his chest, how could he not?
“There’s nothing wrong with reminiscing. It’s your life, it’s not the past for you.” Tony says after nearly an hour of quiet. Steve doesn’t know how he found out about that particular argument, but the quiet acceptance brings tears back to the corner of his eyes.
“Really Steve, it’s fine. I don’t mind. Come sit.” Tony lets him go, but keeps his voice strict, no room for argument and suddenly Steve doesn’t have the energy to fight. He settles back into the couch, trying to ignore just how close Tony is when he sits down again.
“You failed, you’ve never been good enough.” The Brooklyn drawl makes it worse, and Steve is so focused on Bucky he almost misses the sense of ‘right behind you’ raising the hair on the back of his neck. He whips around, shield barely coming up in time to block the metal arm.
Steve stills, the air sucked from his lungs. “Jesus Tony.” A breathless gasp and he’s crushing Tony tight to his chest. “It wasn’t real sweetheart, I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.” Grasping at skin, Tony clings tight, fighting against hot, stinging tears.
“Fuck Steve, baby don’t ever do that to me okay? Please.” His voice cracks. Steve gathers him impossibly tighter.
When two people connect, really connect, the details of how and where and why don’t seem to matter anymore. With Sharon, it was always work, doing what made her happy to keep her happy. When the person is wrong, everything else has to be perfect for it to work.
Twenty minutes later there’s two bowls filled too high with ice cream, one bowl cookie dough fudge; the other, dark chocolate cherry. “Rough day?” Tony asks, sneaking a spoonful of Peter’s cookie dough. The younger boy squawks and steals a spoon of cherry in retaliation. It’s painfully domestic and Tony wouldn’t have it any other way.
“If I didn’t think I could handle you,
“Oh Steve,” She squeezes his hand, pushing the elevator button with her other hand. “You won’t, that’s why you have me.” Steve tries to ignore the ice in his veins, the wind that isn’t really there, the way his stomach clamps in on itself and his heart seems to freeze.
“…right…” Steve nods slowly, like he understands “Tony-“ Tony’s head snaps up and he freezes in place, letting out a little ‘hm?’ “Is this, some sort of… sex thing?”
“Holy mother of shitfucker!” Steve startles off of the couch at the loud cursing. On his feet and ready to fight, he looks down at a rumpled genius with spectacular bags under his eyes.
“Please what sweetheart? What do you need?” His voice is low and gentle, but brings the nightmare back full force. The Steve in front of him contorting into one from his dream and when he rocks forward Tony flinches back, smacking his head hard against the wall.
Sharon backs towards the door. “You’re worthless without me.” She tells him over Tony’s shoulder. “I wasted my time trying to fix you, clearly. You’re broken Steve. No one else is ever going to love you.”
Tony reaches out, carding his fingers through short, blonde hair and humming. “Besides, your wrists were
Tony slides closer, wrapping an arm around Steve’s shoulders and he leans into the embrace for a moment before remembering to pull away. “No. You’re the one not understanding. Cap, what she’s doing isn’t okay.”
“I should be asking you.” He pushes himself up to lean against the headboard. The sheets slip dangerously low and Steve aborts his eyes, pink colouring up his throat into his cheeks.
———————————————————————————————————
“Does she not notice?” Steve tenses even though Natasha never mentions who she is.
Sensing eyes on him, Tony looks up, pausing and smiling up at Steve. “What?” Steve smiles fondly down, reaching out to thread his fingers through the damp hair.
——————————————
Turns out Tony does know a great little place. Brick oven, real cheese, homemade sauce. Cute little tables outside on stone slabbed roads. Serving pizza since 1783. In Italy. Their eight hour flight landed at 9pm Italy time, ‘just in time’ according to Tony, even though Steve is mostly certain he had a reservation and was paying the whole staff extra to stay late.
“I got it Tony, thanks.” Tony stops his actions and, in a flash, flips back to being annoyed.
The thing is, people have needs. When those needs aren’t met, people go elsewhere. That’s why people cheat, they’re not getting what they need, or what they think they need, from their partner.
“Who the fuck…” Tony grumbles as he stumbles over to the door.
Tony hums in the kitchen, swaying gently to music only he can hear while eggs sizzle in a pan. Hickies dot their way up his neck and chest. “Ain’t you a sight for sore eyes.” Steve drawls, leaning against the doorway. Tony turns, grinning widely and holding a hand out.
Wind roars, nearly drowning out Steve’s heartbeat. The plane beeps warning signals, flashing red lights taking over dash, Steve doesn’t know what any of them mean. He flips switches at random, trying desperately to disarm the bombs. He’s talking, but he doesn’t know what he’s saying.
“Don’t lose him Punk, he’s good for you.” Bucky mutters some time later, once Tony is snoring softly into Steve’s shoulder. smiling down at his genius, Steve can’t help but agree.
Steve ends the call, half crawling half scrambling to the bathroom to throw up. The world tilts, spinning and changing every time his eyes flicker.
Tony hushes softly, running his fingers through the short hairs on the back of Steve’s neck. “Just breathe, she’s gone, you’re safe, just breathe.” He repeats like a mantra, bringing his other hand up to rub along Steve’s spine.
Steve turns a self deprecating smile to floor instead of facing her disappointment. “Sometimes’t feels like I’m not gonna catch up.”
Laughing, Steve throws his hands up. “What do you want me to say! Why does it matter if strangers assume, correctly might I add, that you’re a- a-“ He struggles for a second, “- a bottom!” Tony whips around, mouth agape and glaring with the force of a thousand angry men.
“What about ‘Aliens?’ Should we reschedule?”
“What do you think you’re going to do? You’ll let me take anything I want.”
“What, us?”
(it was mostly luck and that doctor guy but thanks steve)
“You and Steve were Pleasant Hill married,” Sam says.

why do you think that’s a good thing?
The man using the cane now is less precise than the others. He wants the pain to last. A strike lands on the balls of Tony’s feet, then another across his heels, and Tony hears bones cracking. The next blow lands millimeters from the last, as if to ensure the bone is fractured.
All of the people in the room are Tony. All of their bodies, Tony’s. Tony becomes an infinite being, every feature and surface of him dedicated to Steve.
the other cap was like “mr stark why are you wearing an iron man gauntlet”
Alt: Finish It
“Please,” Tony sneers. “Like you didn’t know.” All bragging aside, Tony’s sure he wouldn’t be seeing the inside of any of Hardison’s systems unless he was allowed there.

“Halt,” says the not-horse. How it does so without looking absurd is anyone’s guess, but it manages.
So they’re in L-space
While the Skrull’s arms are occupied, Steve slams his shield down across its throat.
Sorry, there’s not going to be any hot tub cuddling in this fic. In case you were getting your hopes up. (There will be clothed cuddling!)
“I’m not—” Not a celebrity, he’d been about to say.
This, also, was a lie.
For the first time since Tony's woken, Steve's eyes leave his. "I don't know if I should tell you."
“Keep us posted,” Tony says.
It was beautiful. The whole thing reminded me of the nave of a Gothic cathedral. The windows were foliated arches with cinquefoils and really lovely stone tracery, too.
"How much time am I missing?" He doesn't say
A wall panel—apparently a door—slides open. Just, disappears into the wall behind the person who has just walked through. She’s wearing a strange jumpsuit, not quite a superhero outfit, or not one Steve’s familiar with. Insignia and pins in neat lines suggest it’s a uniform, though Steve doesn’t recognize any of the symbols or markings.
“No,” Steve says, panicking, before he realizes that Tony’s made no move to leave, or even stand up. “I—can we start over?”
“No, nothing new,” Steve said.
I hate magic
Increases Protect Strength to 90.
More than enough.
“Of course,” Tony says, tipping his teacup across the table as if this is an ordinary reply. Jessica Jones had called it the Book of Sins, though it doesn’t look big enough to hold all of Tony’s.
“Those are the names of my associates.”
It could be nothing. Everything could be just as Steve’s said. Except Tony thinks he might remember what the smell of ammonia reminds him of.
Apparently, they are.
A throat clears on the other end of the line.
And in what Steve’s come to regard as his present—his
James turned back toward the horizon. “Dunno if it’s a good idea.” The low sun cast glaring beams of light that wreathed his long dark hair in a halo of light, like a painted icon. Natasha thought the image both ironic and apt.
He can’t stop the sob that escapes him. He can barely regret it, either; Steve liked the sounds he made, before. Maybe it’ll be over quicker this time.
"I trust you, Steve Rogers," Tony says, and Steve draws them together and kisses him.
The fighting and shooting crawls on into dawn. A fair few men are happy to accept Fisk’s promises of money in return for killing Tony and Red Wolf, though they’re outnumbered by the widows with their rocks and pitchforks.
“What can I do to help?” Tony asks when the conversation gives him an opening. “You don’t have to give me details, but there must be something I can do, for the survivors of Vegas, or—”
Tony makes a short, choked-off sob. “Thank you. For saying it.”
The video winks out, leaving the room in near complete darkness. Of course, Steve can see in complete darkness. For him there’s plenty of light now to gaze down at Tony—his sleeping form, the speck of glitter that’s stuck in his eyelashes—and panic.
Steve shakes his head. “I’m glad you don’t.” His voice is quiet. “I almost killed you then.” He swallows; songbirds call out in Tony’s mind. “I don’t want you to remember that. It’s like—doesn’t it feel like we’re getting another chance?”
and you think I would do something like that?
Up next: a special bonus epilogue to this story.
Tony gets to work.
They can’t agree on even the most basic facts. Steve’s going to fight Tony on this, too.
because it’s
“Don’t be a dick, Tony,” Steve says, and when Tony glances up, Steve’s smirking, tentative and playful at once.
Tony checks his fuel canisters and packs his bag. He fills his flask with water, as well another he’d found in the kitchens. Fire and water, both tucked away in his pack. He snags some fresh apples and fluffy, white bread from the pantry on his way to the front gate.
“It’s happening again,” Steve breathes, tugging Tony in closer. “I hear voices, sometimes. Voices I’m supposed to know. Then the ground shakes and there’s snow everywhere—always snow—like back on the front.”
on his own power. Whatever the reason, it feels fitting. Iron Man and Captain America, just like they were when they met.
of course
“Okay,” Steve huffs softly, “that’s not what I thought you’d ask. Well." He chews on a lip. "I think it depends on what changed, and who changed it.”
He stops trying it after he catches sight of Steve. Steve meets his eyes placidly.
“What?”
“He has,” Steve insists, turning to snag the condiments tray from the table behind him. “This one has the hot sauce you like and a full thing of sugar,” he says by way of explanation, trading out the containers before returning the tray where he found it.
“And plenty of guests with smartphones,” Hardison agrees proudly. “There’s no way he and Hammer can say any of
“Indeed there is something broken here,” the man says, “but not your automaton.”
Tony lets go first. He turns away and gets to his feet, his face flushed. It’s adorable, and Steve doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony embarrassed before. “I’m gonna go get dressed. I guess I’ll see you in the shuttlebay in a bit?” It’s a question, but Tony walks to the door without waiting for an answer.
Steve stifles a sigh and approaches the bar.
“Wish I could tell you more.”
Outside of cattle season, Timely’s small enough that Steve can, for the most part, keep track of who comes and goes by train. This morning there’s some of Danny Rand’s family, a couple legal associates of Murdoch’s, and new hands for Black Bolt Ranch. The trains also bring the usual bevy of businessmen and travelers, there to stay the night at the hotel before the next train out to Antelope Wells or Deming.
Three episodes, two tubs of popcorn, and several grilled cheese sandwiches later—the sandwiches are fancy, of course, prepared by robots, made with provolone, mozzarella, and fresh pesto—Steve gathers the courage to ask something he’s been thinking about since Tony first visited him while he was de-serumed.
a MOMENT moment you know?
“How come for you this spell just sounds like you’re being your regular, sarcastic self?”
“Don't rightly know,” Steve replies, rage simmering in the back of his mind and near fit to boiling over. “But we'll find out.”
hey doreen it’s clint from the dog park
trusting—Steve to wield this power over him. For standing there and telling Steve to kill him. How dare he demand this? How dare he goad Steve to do this?
“Bring him to me.”
Tony and I have been watching it! I really like Zuko’s character arc.
man why do you keep trying this
“You could call me Steve.”
“Seen stranger things in this valley than that, I reckon.”
to each other—”
“We’re trapped,” Steve says. Maria is back in her SHIELD uniform, Hyperion and Zemo in their costumes, and—oh god—Whitney, Dr. Selvig, Elektra, Crossbones, Graviton, the latest Whiplash—
It’s the day after Tony’s funeral. Steve would be surprised by how quickly time has gone by, if he had the capacity to do so.
At first, Tony can only think of lewd or grotesque replies, which suggests to him that the correct answer is neither. The swelling and rising of the walls around him are of no help, nor the fact that he and his adversary are tied and he doesn't know where a wrong answer will lead him. Finally, he thinks of meals at Victor’s grand dining table, and smiles. “Dough,” he says triumphantly.
This puzzles the gatekeeper to the point that he twists his waist like he’s wringing dry a wet rag, his head rolling so far to one wasted shoulder it should mean a broken neck. A single human eye surfaces onto the smooth expanse of his head like oil floating to the top of a bowl of batter. The eye is pointed at Tony, perhaps looking for clues or signs of deception on his person.
This is the third date he’s had with Steve—Tony thinks it’s a date, anyway. They share onion rings and fries, Steve with a little white paper tub of mayonnaise, Tony with a perfect blend of ketchup and hot sauce on his now-empty salad plate, the two of them arguing over the other’s condiment choices even as they reach across the table to use them. Steve inhales the second basket of fries, licking mayo, ketchup, and hot sauce off the fingers of one hand as he uses the other to show Tony photos of Edward Hopper paintings on his smartphone.
“Didn't look like me.”
He reminds himself of this as Steve’s fingers skirt down his ass. Steve’s taking his time. Whatever he’s going to do, Tony wishes he would do it already, but that’s the point, isn’t it. That, and Steve is enjoying this. When he startles a reaction from Tony, he hums in satisfaction. His breath grows shorter. He digs his nails into the flesh of Tony’s ass, kneading at it, uncaring of the damage left from the cane.
Steve, who had not extended an invitation to Sharon, said, “She had a work thing. And Pepper?”
Tony grins, and Steve can’t quite picture how his real smile looks. “You know, I’m so glad you brought that up.”
“You sure know how to charm a crowd, Stark,” Hardison agrees.
and words were said and anyway
Steve smiled and took Tony’s hand. “Hey, you know how in fairy tales, true love’s kiss will break a witch’s spell?”
The little girl is there, the night sky dark around her, her pale pigtails the same color as the snow. She’s holding something in her hands, a toy—a snowglobe—and something inside it glitters, tiny golden dots of light like lit windows, sparks of neon curling and refracting along the surface of the glass—
Three: Black Bolt is a Super-Skrull.
Tony spends the flight reading about the development of faster-than-light travel. Steve spends it watching Tony.
For all that one wall is nothing but windows from edge to edge, Steve hasn’t noticed the view. In the absence of curtains and furniture, it’s the most prominent part of the room.
“The computer has a bunch of holographic games in it,” Tony continues. “Tabletop games, like, chess, except, you know, alien chess, and in 3D. And regular chess too probably. And stuff that’s basically just two-person video games, building sims, racing, strategy, all that stuff. Wanna play?”
– A laugh or smile to the full extent on the jaws
Tony smiles wider, and Steve can’t quite picture how his real smile used to look. “Not
(See the end of the chapter for
they did tell us that the library we’re in right now is an entire planet btw
which was awesome btw no one knock the secret door
Tony’s words echo Steve’s own thoughts so closely he doesn’t know whether to be impressed or unnerved. “I was wrong.”
He should say something. He’s dumbstruck.
“‘Let’s hear it for Captain America,’” Steve says.
“How’s Parker?” Tony asks. “She got her hands on that
“We should just ask him,” Tony hisses under his breath.
Steve looks at him with an unnameable intensity. His eyes search Tony's face and his grip tightens on Tony's hand. A spike of fear shoots up Tony's spine, though what he's frightened of, he can't say. "Do you mean that?"
“I love you,” Steve says. He hasn’t said it yet. He hopes he’s saying it right, hopes he doesn’t sound like this is something he hates about himself.
“Are you—”
I’m gonna add some to the tower and not tell any of you naysayers *cough*janandrhodey*cough* where they are or where they go
They’re still for a beat. Steve might be holding his breath.
10 AP
The sky is a tangle of canopy, energy blasts, lightning, and arrows. Pairs break off, some mirrored—the two Spider-Men swing toward each other—others chronologically askew—Iron Fist ducking the claws of a Wolverine wearing a uniform the X-Men haven’t worn in years. The cannonade of thunder harmonizes with the barrage of explosions.
He tried to be happy that Tony invited him at all. If only Steve hadn’t had such unrealistic expectations.
“Funny.” Steve slaps him across the face, rattling his jaw together. Before Tony can prepare himself, Steve hits him again, knocking his head in the opposite direction. “I don’t need your participation.”
Steve disagrees.
When James said he remembered everything and Natasha said she had moved on from James shooting her, they each knew the other was lying.
, that’s the whole point—”
"Gonna make it worth my while?"
Sure enough, there’s a new sound coming from behind Tony now, one that Tony realizes with leaden dread is Steve unzipping his fly. The soft noises of Steve taking out his cock reach Tony over the pounding of his blood in his ears. He hears the flesh-slapping sounds of Steve jerking himself and Tony’s trembling turns to full-body shudders, wracking his shoulders and setting off the pain in his side all over again. Stars burst against his eyelids. Maybe he’ll black out again. Maybe he’ll pass out entirely.
Steve watches Tony’s hands fidget in his lap, one red, one sunkissed golden skin—not that Steve can tell right now. Tony lost his hand and built a new one, a stronger one, that shoots repulsors out of the palm. Tony didn't stop at making a prosthetic that gave him the same abilities as a healthy, able-bodied person, no more than Steve would have chosen a serum that made him healthy if he could have one that gave him superhuman strength and resilience too. Everyone here is exceptional in some way, and they're here because they
He hasn’t yet managed to get to his feet, and cranes his neck to watch Tony’s approach. His movements are impossibly fluid, entirely effortless. He grabs Steve by the hair and holds him, forcing their gazes to meet—not that it occurred to Steve to look anywhere else.
“It’s.” Tony swallows. He’s not sure which is more disorienting; Pepper’s politeness in the face of his wild disassociation, or the fact that he can
Once he realizes he’s doing this, he snaps his head up and goes inside.
“You don’t look like you need iron shoes hammered into your hooves,” Tony observes, wondering how fast he can get in his armor if he has to.
“Did you know your old war buddy killed my mom?”
“I know,” Tony snapped, glaring at Rhodes. “I’m in shock, I’m traumatized, okay, I’m having a speech glitch.”
it’s almost like :) :) :) :) :)
“Nah,” Steve says.
“I was watching them,” Steve says, his mouth centimeters from Tony’s ear. “Tony. The sounds you made.”
them to do so.
“I’ll try to disregard that if we need to communicate while we’re still under the spell. Can I ask you a yes or no question?”
He squeezes his eyes shut, biting his lip to keep his mouth shut. He tries to focus on breathing, on every point of his body that screams out in pain, but all it does is force his breath out in harsh pants. Steve finds a bead of dried blood on Tony’s back. His finger follows it up to the still-raw stripe it bled from, and this time it’s his blunt fingernail that drags languidly across the mark. Tony groans before he can stop himself. He can’t shake the feeling that he’s giving Steve exactly what he wants.
but he can't bring himself to make Steve say it. It should be self-evident that Steve wanted him back. Steve's here, Steve's the only one here, and Tony doesn't want to dwell too much on why there's no one else, but he's getting the idea that Steve oversaw whatever it was that woke Tony up.
“Thanks,” Steve says, plucking it out of Tony’s fingers instead.
“No, of course not. Hmm. When the spell makes you say you like me, are you trying to say that you don’t like me?”
Tony’s the one who pulls away first. Steve’s face is hot, and no doubt bright red.
yeah and I don’t care for that “probably” bit
“Sub-director Maria Hill is what. She’s in charge of keeping an eye on you.”
right of course not
Carol is the first to fall asleep, facilitated, no doubt, by Jen’s massage. Pepper, Jan, and Rhodes are still chatting and watching videos, despite the dimmed lights and late hour. Jen and T’Challa try to keep their eyes open, but only a couple clips later they’re each sprawled out, unconscious on one couch each. Nat’s on a couch by herself too, situated so she could, if she wanted, be part of any conversation in the room without having to move or yell. She seems alert, spine straight, eyes roving over the room as she absorbs the conversation in silence.
“Might not be a good one, though,” Spencer puts in.
Steve gets through the first day by operating his body like a puppet. He should hate this. He should refuse to take part in any of this. But he just feels empty. No, he’d feel empty if he were capable of feeling. He
kind of
This is when Tony realizes he’s been staring into space for two minutes and thirty-eight seconds.
, he could have said. But he thought he knew best.
“He loved you, you know. Even when you fought.”
Anytime
i hadn’t actually asked yet but thanks
Steve steps through the rubble with his shield up. In the more intact areas of the mansion, the glare of the sun casts near-black shadows.
Tony’s stomach flips and they aren’t walking away from the cafe, they’re standing in front of the town museum, and Mayor Hill is chatting pleasantly with Steve.
“Not a chance,” Tony replies. The tea is jasmine, and better than he would’ve thought would be available this far west.
“Hammer to his fingers,” the man suggests. “I want to see him take
They’re sitting at a table—a simple, wooden table, as far as Steve can tell, so that’s familiar at least—in a vast recreation room filled with tables, chairs, couches, and screens. There are crew members spread all over, in singles, couples, and groups, mostly a table or two apart from other parties. Surveying them, Steve can see why Lieutenant Gonzales was the one sent to meet them; as far as he can tell, she appears more human than anyone else in the crew. Early in the tour she’d listed all the different peoples who are part of United Space: mutants, mutates, Inhumans, Asgardians, Atlanteans, and plenty of alien species Steve’s never heard of. A few yards away, a pale green, scaled person with a face like an iguana is playing what looks to Steve like some form of holographic basketball with a woman glowing like burning coals, several humanoid people with green or fuchsia skin, someone with stretching powers like Reed’s, a gynoid with visible circuitry, and what looks to Steve like a four-foot-tall tropical bird.
“Steve?” Tony’s gone tense in Steve’s arms. Steve pulls back so he can see Tony’s face. “Are you—”
it’s only been *how* many hours since you got locked out of the archives?
There’s a dragonfly on his head and two damselflies on one arm. Their wings flutter and tickle through his clothes. A bone-white hand bobs out the mud near one boot. Another step. Wet grass brushes slippery tendrils over one knee. His other is entangled in long strands of hair from the floating body of a redheaded woman in a chiffon dress. He walks on. Another damselfly alights by one ear. The next body skimming the surface of the mud wears a Union uniform.
and there are these mutated creatures living in the other ones
Tony stops at the bank of the Kirby for some rest and repast. It’s quick work to get a fire started. His supper of beans, maize, and pork belly is accompanied by an apple he shares with Apple and a watery cup of coffee. He prefers his coffee to be strong enough to float a colt, but will be the first to admit he doesn’t know much about packing or preparing food and drink for an overnight journey.
“Because,” Steve says, like Tony hasn’t spoken, “I was hoping we could—I mean. In Asgard—look. Did you mean what you said?”
“Parker has to be on call as Agent Hagen or McSweeten will spook. Gotta be something Hardison can pull. Like the Geneva Paso Doble.”
“Tech genius
that?” Hardison complains. “Next time we work together, you’re sharing your tech.”

A week after being cleared by the compound’s medical team and given federal permission to stay on the grounds for the time being, James joined the team to eat pizza and watch “West Side Story.”
“No.”
For a moment the only sound on the line is Barnes’ faint—and slightly staticky, stupid iPhone—breathing. “Why are you calling me?”
“I don’t suppose you’re in need of a farrier?”
I’ll forgive you someday
“An’ what were you old pals discussin’, then?”
and then this teenager ran in
He exhales and leans in, closing the scant distance between their faces. Tony’s eyes fall shut. He tilts his head and lets Steve’s lips find his.
you were about to
Tony's not missing memories at all. He was in a coma because of the fight with Carol, not because of anything he did to himself.
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Steve says again. “I committed
“No. Us. You and me,” Steve says, decisive and matter-of-fact. “We’ll stop. Just until we figure out what to do.”
But he came here. Steve can figure this out. Tony came out here, risking his own freedom and reputation, to make sure Steve was safe. He’s angry, of course he’s angry, but he wanted to see Steve. Steve needs to find the right thing to say, for once, or when Tony leaves this time, Steve will never see him again.
. Still, it was reassuring to hear it. To know that he was confident he remembered enough to pass off that he remembered the same kinds of things everyone else did.
“It was her idea. Apparently, Nick Fury’s shoes are hard to fill.”
Tony scoffs and holds his arms out beside him, palms open in a
except she also said that it’s a network connecting libraries and bookshops and you’re not either of those
The bulk of the remaining guests depart in the half-hour after Tony finishes opening his presents, leaving only a handful people more than had been there to set up—Natasha, T’Challa, Jen, and Carol. The energy level has slowed further. Even Jan has mellowed out.
