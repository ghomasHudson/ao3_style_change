But Cas just shook his head. “Almost all of the angels have returned home. Hannah and I worked for several weeks to round up most of the remaining ones.”
The cherry on top was that Cas had the gall to actually sound confused. “You won’t save yourself. You won’t take me out. We’re just spinning our wheels. There’s no way this won’t end badly. You’ll burn out or blow up or whatever, I’ll still have this damn Mark and turn into a demon, and Sam won’t have anyone to help take me out.”
. He’d been at thousands of these places and eaten burgers with his brother, but sitting next to Cas and stealing his food and just talking -- it had felt miles different, comfortable and awesome and terrifyingly easy. So yeah, on some level, he wasn’t really surprised that it made his greatest hits. Reliving it while standing next to Cas, though; that was what was making his stomach churn.
Dean will blame himself for it later, ashamed and self-loathing and terrified beyond belief, but he doesn't think anything of it when Cas doesn't show up at the bunker for hours.
“Looked?” She was more perceptive than he thought teenage girls were supposed to be. “So does that mean he’s
The mall’s all but deserted at this time of night. A few kids are huddled outside under one of the flickering street lights, and Dean narrows his eyes at them as he and Cas stride by. Once they go through the huge set of doors, Cas takes a short glance around, and then makes a bee-line for one of the stores.
“No. The Axis Mundi leads inward, to the Garden. We need to go out. Ramiel should be near the Gates.” With one last, brief look at memory-Dean, Cas headed for the entrance to the diner.
“No,” he lied, but made no effort to raise his voice. “Yes. Shut up. Cas is asleep.” He could just picture the face Sam must have been making, complete with a smirk and raised eyebrows, so he plowed on, unwilling to hear the smug comment that was sure to follow. “I figured I already have to deal with your whining, no sense in waking him up to bitch at me, too.”
Sam refuses to rise to the bait, quiet but steady. There's a glimmer of steel in his expression when he tells Dean they'll find another avenue.
He knew this was the perfect opportunity to add ‘for everything,’ to say goodbye. Unlike with Sam, he’d never had to really, truly say goodbye to Cas before; if there’d one thing that’d been constant, it was that Cas had always left before they’d had to. Dean didn’t know how to even begin to put into words the pain and relief and pure sorrow building in his chest at the thought of this being the last chance to say and do all the things he’d always tried so hard not to think about -- so he didn’t. He bit back the confessions and just said, “Let’s get this thing over with.”
. Threw himself onto the altar. Guess he was really that desperate to be a Winchester, hmm? It's pathetic." The mockery in his voice cuts like a knife. "He's nothing but a tool to you, but still he finds ways to fall even further. Letting little old me in, of all things. All to save you."
Dawn was just beginning to break when they pulled up to the bunker, the sky lightening from black to grey and streaking with pinks and blues as Dean pulled the parking brake and killed the engine. In the passenger seat, Cas startled awake. “What -- I fell asleep. How long was I out?” he asked, rubbing at his eyes.
not Cas, but he refuses to accept the only other possibility he can think of -- gives up the pretense. "Cas" finally leans back, but even with the rush of air, Dean's lungs refuse to cooperate. "And yet, all you have to do is crook your finger and he trips over himself to be your lapdog until you kick him to the curb again." The laugh he punctuates that with raises goosebumps along every part of Dean's body. "I mean, it'd be hilarious if it wasn't so
Castiel ignores him, he is clearly mortified by this story and just wants to tell it and get it over with as quickly as possible.  “So he ordered them all to call me ‘Highness,’ and nothing else.  They can’t disobey him, if he orders them, because of his mandate.  He ordered them to call me that and now they have to.  They can’t even call me ‘he’, or ‘him’; when I punish them it’s ‘Mercy, Highness,” like you just heard, if Dean asks them who they are going to obey when he is away it’s “Highness, Master,” if Crowley asks them who sent them out to interrupt one of his contracts it’s, ‘Highness, Highness.’  That annoys Crowley exceptionally, which I suspect is part of why Dean picked it, though if I insinuate as much he just smirks and says ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about, Cas.’ It’s unbelievably aggravating, I almost prefer ‘fucktoy’.”  Cas’ eyes are closed by the time he finishes this recitation.
“But eventually it just hurt too much.  So I went to check on him.  Just only to make sure he was OK!” This last with more emotion, delivered with Castiel's eyes wide, head raised from his knees, imploring his brothers to understand some nuance of this part of the confession that they did not.
“Cas!  Cas,” The hand on Cas’ shoulder grips tighter now.  Dean yells Castlel’s name, but his voice is a whisper when he tries: “What if I mess it up?”  He sounds so serious.  Completely heartbroken, like he has already messed it up a million times in his head and now he thinks he ‘can’t’ even try.
He paused for a moment, at the end, breathing heavily, not from the exertion of reciting the poem but from the intensity of emotions it summoned. “Always, Dean.” He said, a little shyly.  “Want you to know that.  Always.”
Dean raises it up to face level, and then kisses it as carefully and gently as he can on the forehead.  “Kisses,” he says.  “Chu.”
His breath catches sharply, ragged on the inhale, and he tips over forward, choking on the fiery ice that fills him to overflowing in a single, immediate, burst.  A hand goes to his heart, which has not stopped beating like the dead, but is instead crescendoing like the roll of a tympani, so fast he can barely tell one beat from the next, so deep it feels like it is driving through his body and into the floor, the walls, and shaking them, too.
“Castiel.  Angel of Thursday.”  He bites the soft flesh at the top of Castiel's thigh.  “Tender meat, to be caught by a fiend like me.” He lets his horns grow out, with a ragged crackle, and bites beneath Castiel's navel.   “Tender and sweet.”
The sun has set on the cliff's edge.  Night insects buzz and chatter in the darkness, and the moon shines down, silver and gracious, on Dean and Castiel.  They lay still in the moss, naked and pale, covered by Dean's heavy wing, and Dean runs his fingers through Castiel's hair, soft and black in the night.  It is getting cold.
“We will go to an… Empty place,” Castiel says, voice almost lost in the wind.  “But it will be empty only for a moment. Then I will fill it, with… myself.”
He adjusted his hard hat tighter on his head, though he already had a headache, and he went back to work.  Subdued and silent, for the rest of the day, not answering the jokes and requests of his crew members with more than a nod until they left him to his melancholy and the air horn sounded again for the end of the shift.
Let a second wave of demons come, and a third, and a fourth, while he looks into those eyes.  He will slay them all.
Castiel didn’t wait a year before he went to Dean again.  He couldn’t have, if he had wanted to.  Anael was right.  His heart was showing him the way.
He lies in the bathtub counting for two days, and he does not fall asleep again.  The boredom, and the repetition, and the concentration wash into him, three warm breezes on the frozen core of his heart.  He breathes.  He counts.  He prays Dean's name.  This is all he asks of himself, and he finds he can do it.  He is strong enough, for this.  Maybe he can be strong enough, for more.  When he reaches a million, he is tired of counting.  He is tired of the bathtub, and the ache in his body that only grows.  He is tired of the way the light glints off of the shower fixtures, into his eyes.  He is ready for more.  He is ready to be Castiel again, or at least to try.
He doesn't want to tell Dean about Lucifer.  He doesn't want to tell Dean about Michael. He doesn't want Dean to have to know that the Final Battle is coming, and will rest on his shoulders; that he may have to kill his brother or see him become the devil.  Dean may have been strong in the past, and he may be strong again in the future, but he is not strong now; now he cannot come out of his blanket, because he is afraid. This is the time of healing, not the time of hard truths.  Those will come later, sure as the sun sets, so Castiel will spare Dean of them now, while he still can.
down every nerve ending his finger passes, into Dean’s spine, into his brain, carrying that intent, hungry.
The souls on the racks are ugly, each ugly in a unique and grotesque manner.  They are oily and black, like night soil, or rancid and putrified, sprouting malignant growths; they are sharp and cruel and static, or they boil and shift nauseatingly at the edges of vision.  Dean's soul shone when Castiel raised him, this he knows, but that was after he had been on the rack for thirty years.  When he got here, it was black with soot and murder and pride and failure, and it swallowed light, instead of shining it out, this is what he believes.  This is what he knows.  Castiel does not agree.
I’m failing you, and I don’t know… I don’t know how to be better.” his voice sounds like it is about to break.
He stands.  Castiel whines and ruts at the cold air, where Dean has left him, but only for a second, before his breath is knocked away by Dean picking him up and slamming him down into a new position.  He gasps to try to get oxygen into his lungs as Dean presses his face and chest back against the throne, spreads his knees roughly on the unforgiving seat.  But he can’t, his breath can’t catch up with his heaving, because Dean doesn’t give him time.  First, because he pushes his fingers into Castiel’s mouth, filling him up and making him lightheaded, choking on Dean, choking on desire that flares hot all through him.  And then because as soon as Dean’s fingers are gone from his mouth, one is slipped inside him, crooking and working him open and taking his breath away again.
The Pit Lords, on their pedestals, rushed the angel and were slain in the ecstasy of his light.  His sword like a river; effortless, swift and silver tipped.  He did not even seem to fight them, only end them.  Like they were

Sam's anger is too potent to be stopped, now that it has been set free on a real target, instead of only spinning inside his head.  He continues.  “The last I see of Cas, he's losing his mind, telling me you're hurt, you're scared.   He pulls some mystery angel crap, and all of a sudden he's got angel eyes--
If Dean Winchester really was the protagonist of a love story, really was the brooding hero so many girls on the internet seem to think he is, the moment the last vamp’s head hit the floor, he’d drop his machete and run to Castiel. He’d hold him and tenderly run a thumb across the still-bleeding bite on Cas’s neck. He’d say something like, “Fuck, man, you gotta stop almost dying on me. I can’t lose you.”
Ramiel nodded. “Indeed. The deal with Lucifer had left a brand upon his soul. Even if I had been permitted to intercede on Cain’s behalf, that kind of binding magic… it would have been beyond my abilities to remove.”
there. Cas shakes his head. “Even having all of the context, I’m still struggling to keep up, so perhaps you should give him a break.”
“Because it’s Sam, man.” It wasn’t much of an explanation, but it was the only one he’d ever needed, and he knew Cas knew that. “You know I couldn’t.”
“Cas, hey. You okay?” Evidently Dean wasn’t the only one to notice how run down the angel looked. Sam leaned across the table, face full of the same concern Dean had spent the last week doing his best to avoid. “You’re not looking so good.”
these tiny creatures were so enthralling, but with an ever-growing amount of reverence as the years have passed. But there's an edge to it now, something harsh that sends all sorts of alarms screaming in Dean's head.
There’s… something about the way Cas grins, something about how they’re both looking at each other with – are those
. Either way, the question is out of his mouth before he can think better of it. “And you? What about your happy ending?”
“Yeah, everything’s good,” Sam confirmed, his voice tearing Dean away from his once-over of Cas. He stood up, his broad smile turning into something far closer to a smirk as he added, “Uh, actually, I’m going to grab Dean some grub. Anything for you?”
“There it is,” Dean says, still too fucking gleeful, and heads out, tugging Cas along right behind him.
The sun had set by the time Cas directed them off the interstate and onto some county road. Of all the places Dean would have imagined a portal up to Heaven being, the pretty generic playground Cas led them to would not have been one of them. “The stairway to Heaven is through some monkey bars?” he asked skeptically as they pulled in, surveying the scene before them. It was almost fully dark by now, the meager light casting tall shadows that made it look more like a set to some C grade horror movie than any holy portal or whatever.
It’s going to take some time, to recontextualize a million things, not the least of which all the times Sam never quite understood why Dean took things with Cas so much harder, because
All of Dean’s posturing just evaporated, leaving nothing to cover up the bone-deep weariness. “No,” he said, pinning the phone between his ear and his shoulder to free his hand long enough to swipe it over his eyes. “He’s not.”
“It’s -- I’m just-- fuck.” He’d like to blame the coffee for why his tongue feels so thick and clumsy, but that’d be a blatant lie. Chickening out, he just finishes lamely, “It’s fine, never mind. Don’t worry about it. I’ll try to be less of a dick from now on.”
There were too many worst case scenarios for Dean to have any confidence in an outcome where he’d see Sam again. Which meant this was it. He’d had to say goodbye to his brother more times than he could count, but it didn’t mean it had ever gotten any easier. He just watched as Sam visibly fought tears, smiling through the tightness in his own chest. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he decided, screw it. Everything he had to say, Sam already knew. “I’m thinking burgers tonight,” he said instead, aiming for casual and probably missing the mark by a mile. “What do you think?”
When he turns around and holds the machete out handle-first for Cas to take, he sees the deep frown on Cas’s face. “Don’t give me that look.”
turn out to be much further, Cas would end up running himself into the ground, and Dean had no idea where they’d be able to go from there. But arguing would only slow them down.
“Why not?” Sam asked, all traces of humor or eagerness gone. “Dean, this could be it. This could save you.
“You literally told me I’d have my happy ending with Eileen and you’d have yours with Cas,” Sam says, groaning.
He looked up, meeting Cas’s gaze as he said, “If this doesn’t work, and by some miracle we both survive, you take me out.” Sure enough, there was no flicker of surprise on Cas’s face. “Right then. I mean it. I was willing to try this, but if it doesn’t work, that’s it. I can’t take that chance. You can tell Sam it was the transfer if you want.”
Before either of them could comment, though, Sam continued, an exhilarated grin slowly creeping onto his face. “I didn’t think a deal like Aaron made would be the right way to go, but I figured it was somewhere to start, right? So I went back to that section on Grace that we found last year. It was where we found that spell we used to try and track Gadreel,” he said with a nod in Cas’s direction. “Anyways, there were a whole bunch of spells and theories and whatnot there about how else Grace could be used. And I found this.” He picked up a file that had been resting near his elbow, beaming now, and tossed it across the table.
All throughout dinner, Dean tried his hardest not to think of the last time he’d had a “family dinner”, and how quickly things had gone downhill. He wanted to scoff at the notion -- eating a home-cooked meal and sitting around a table like a normal family when they were anything but. They were two hunters, a cop-slash-hunter, an ex-vampire, and a girl who’d once briefly housed an angel, and just three hours ago they’d all been covered in blood and brandishing weapons. Playing house like this should feel like a sham, like Victor Rogers’ operation a few years back. But instead it felt real, almost comfortable, even if he was truly on the outside looking in. They had a good thing going here, and for once, Dean was optimistic.
Dean’s come a long way from the fidgety twenty-something who couldn’t keep still if his life depended on it, but he’s still not good at being still. Even after long drives and longer hunts, when he’s in a good mood, the Impala is filled with little movements: a thumb casually tapping out the beat of a cassette that’s so worn, Sam has memories set to the squeaks and crackles where the tape wore thin decades ago. The sounds of the road passing by, and the wind rushing through the open window as they take in the fresh air and sunlight. Little, contented sighs that are far too rare. Even the looks he’ll shoot Sam’s way every now and then, as if to check that Sam’s just as content as he is, are warm and treasured enough to almost hear.
Dean can’t help feeling as if he missed a step somewhere. “Uh, yeah?” He figured Cas would hem and haw a little bit but then accept the apology and they’d move on, but for whatever reason, it’s very clearly not what Cas wanted at all.
Laughter probably wasn’t what Cas was going for, but hearing what can only be called a line come from his mouth was just too damn much. Luckily, he doesn’t look offended in the least, but fond as he watches Dean fight to get his giggles under control.
When Dean Winchester appears, black eyed, hellhounds baying at his feet, they do not care about that either.  He tells them why he has come.  They hear him, but they do not listen.  He threatens them.  With death, with breaking.  They do not react, why would they.  They cannot die.  They cannot be broken.
“But you weren’t, before?”  Dean’s eyes are tearing up now.  It hurts so much, to think that Cas could have been with him, but not really with him.  That what he used to feel when he looked at Cas was

He has not decided what he is going to do with them yet, and that is why he is listening.  That is why he doesn’t have one of their necks under the First Blade, already.  He’d rather not kill them, if he doesn’t have to.  They are human, and they haven’t actually done anything evil yet.  Yes, probably, trying to summon Lucifer is most often not motivated by reasons that are pure of heart, but they also haven’t actually
They lead the human and its pets to a balcony, that looks out on the setting sun, and the far-reaching icewhite.  They have a mouth, but they never say a word.  They still ignore the human as it continues to talk, and instead stare out at the colors that are painted on the horizon.  All of these colors have names.  All of these colors are different, from the crystal shine of the palace.  Ishkar looks at them every day, and every day they are not the same as the day before.  They try to name them, silently, while the human still talks.
“He brought me their leader, he is waiting in the plane of fire for me to return, and teach him.” He pauses.  “No one else knows.  He may tell his brother, but he has not yet.  This is my secret.”
Dean does not answer immediately, and the stars freeze and dim again, while they wait for his answer (they are sad because they think he will say no).
Dean's eyes take on a faraway look.  “He'd be so beautiful with your blade, Smith.  He's so bright, and sharp, already.  He would become… You'd see him with it, and you'd fall in love with him.  You'd have to.”
Castiel doesn’t know how to answer this question.  It is such a simple question, but the answer is impossible.  Because there are two answers, and he can’t open his mouth to say either of them with the other clanging like a fire alarm in the back of his head.  One answer is:
They do send Baal to watch for Sam, and he is stupid, so Sam does see him when he leaves the bunker on his way to Nebraska, and Sam does kill him, but it's worth it because when Baal calls out to Dean, for help, that's when they know that Sam is outside of the bunker's wards and Dean is able to summon him to the place that Castiel has prepared for him in the Pit. Castiel meets him there.
Cas seems to look off into the far distance.  He doesn’t seem to see Dean, right in front of him.  “If someone is to end her… I want it to be me.  I want to do it.  I saw her fight, once, a long time ago.  I wanted to…”  He snaps out of it, and looks at Dean again.  “I would want it to be me.”
A candle lights inside Castiel, small and soft and warm.  “Tell me.” There has never been anything Castiel has wanted to know this badly.  He clenches his fingers in Dean's shirt again, to keep himself from floating away.
“They call to me.  My brethren.” Castiel is holding Dean at the level of his eyes.  Dean’s legs are buried in Castiel’s feathers, like a blanket, and his hands are twined into them, twisted up and scratching lightly.
Five minutes later, all three of them were seated around the table in the library, holding huge, steaming cups of coffee. “Okay,” Dean said once he’d taken a few long swigs from his mug. “Lay it on us.”
Cas’s scowl deepened, but it was Dean’s turn to interrupt. “Look, so there’s no Magic Eraser. I wasn’t expecting one. But come on, man, you gotta give us something, anything, to work with. About the Mark or how the binding magic works or… whatever?”
It was Cas. Dean watched, half-fascinated, half-horrified as Cas flickered in and out, a tall, unbearably bright amalgamation of light taking the place of his body. “Dean,” the thing --
, but those three words are somehow not as terrifying as they might’ve been even a year ago. “Yeah.” His voice is hoarse, but Cas must hear something in it to show that he’s not freaking out, for his smile returns. It’s enough to give Dean the courage to say, “Yeah, uh. Me too. Just so you’re aware.”
“A few of the Men of Letters apparently thought that the key to curing a demon was with angelic Grace,” Sam continued, leaning forward in his chair, eyes alight. “They said that since a demon is just a human soul that’s been twisted by the claim on it from Hell that counteracting that claim with something so heavenly and pure would essentially cure it.”
“When this is over,” Cas said instead, and that was definitely both eagerness and apprehension that rose in him at that, “perhaps then.” It was a statement, but there was an undeniable question in it.
Reassuring. “And there, uh, won’t be any issue with the thing on my arm?” The angels had never exactly been his biggest fans, and he couldn’t imagine bearing the father of murder’s brand would endear him to them in any way.
Sam made the ten hour drive back to the bunker in a little over eight, shoulders hunched and eyes hard, silent but for the occasional sharp exhale of breath. The moment they made it back, he took it as his personal mission to find a cure, ASAP.
that the visions could have come from someone other than God. That last one is particularly grating -- why would
Cas finally dragged his stare away from Dean, sighing once more. “No one is taking vessels anymore,” he explained. “With everything that’s happened in the last several years, their priority --
“It’s Claire’s birthday.” The answer is so befuddling that Dean just ends up staring for a good thirty seconds. “I’ll only be a few minutes,” he adds, and the set of his jaw tells Dean that there’ll be no talking him out of this.
The awe and gratitude in Cas’s smile makes him briefly wish he’d had the guts to actually say the word, but it’s enough for now. Someday soon he’ll say it. He’ll murmur it into every inch of Cas’s skin and watch as his eyes light up. He’ll cry it while Cas presses him into the mattress. He’ll say it while they’re wrapped up together, hands entwined. But for now, he just takes Cas’s hand and says, “Come on,” and leads him back to Dean’s room.
They’d been walking in silence for a few minutes when there was a sudden intake of breath and a flash of something beside him. Dean startled, automatically reaching for the gun tucked in the small of his back. It wouldn’t do any good against anything up here, but he’d brought it nonetheless, unable to stomach being completely unarmed. Its familiar weight in his hand was a small comfort as he whirled around to see a huge explosion of light.
By the time Sam shuffles off to his room, leaving the bunker silent but for the humming of ancient machinery, Dean's about ready to call it a night, himself. He's still reeling from the pace of the day. The incident with Amara and the smiting sickness left him feeling empty and exhausted, and everything with Lucifer was so full and frantic. Frankly, he's fucking tired of being constantly pulled between extremes. Just once, he wants to find some middle ground.
But every time he looks over to see if Dean’s struggling with even a fraction of the same things, it’s… he’s blank. Exhaustion is written on every line of his face, perhaps more starkly than Sam’s ever seen before, but that’s it. There’s no visible grief making his breaths uneven, no anger narrowing his eyes, no determination in the way his hands are gripping the wheel, no contentment or peace anywhere to be found. The silence isn’t even weighty, just never-ending, and Sam finds he can’t even open his mouth to see what words would fall out.
Cas grimaced. “By itself, maybe not. But I’ve had to exert more than I anticipated keeping you here as well, seeing as separating your soul from your body wasn’t an option.”
Dean laughs again, and this final time it actually sounds like laughter, something lighter and warmer than the jagged scoffs he usually scrapes out. “I have no fucking clue, except that I
Dean’s bewilderment was quickly eclipsed by anger. “So you’re just gonna sit there, wasting what little time you have left on this last-ditch effort at finding information instead of trying to find some kind of solution.”
An echo of the same smile Cas had given him just before doing the spell appeared on his face once more. “Hello, Dean.”
“Your Grace.” He could practically hear the frown Cas directed his way. “Sam was right, you look terrible.” When he turned his head to look at Cas in the passenger seat, sure enough, there was a frown creasing his forehead, though there was less confusion and more defeat than he’d been picturing in his head. “So? How bad we talking?”
Dean was forcibly reminded of earlier, how Cas had referred to the angels as ‘them’ and not ‘us’. “Maybe. But most angels aren’t resurrected a bunch of times, either,” he said lightly. “Or have a vessel without a human riding alongside. You’re different, Cas.”
Cas’s face twisted into a grimace. “I’m fine.” Apparently, he still hadn’t learned how to lie convincingly. “It’s nothing that can’t wait.”
about this. Cas has never spoken of humanity with anything less than affection -- curious, at first, as though he couldn't understand
They’re ten minutes away from the motel when Cas makes a sharp noise, then immediately starts digging in his coat pockets and pulls out his phone.
Ramiel’s eyes darted from Dean to Cas. It was possible he realized just what Dean was referring to, as he ducked his head and said, “Ah, yes. Well,” before continuing on his spiel. “The Mark leeches from the soul, borrowing power and feeding back aggression and violence. The more power drawn, the more volatile the bearer will become.”
at channeling any other emotion into anger, are the rough drives. The cassette player will be silent, almost mockingly so, but the thrum of the engines’ rev in unison with the latest clench of Dean’s jaw have just as much a familiar place in the soundtrack of Sam’s life. The seats creak and moan with every huffed breath and Dean’s knuckles go so white-tight around the steering wheel the leather audibly complains, and Sam’s teeth will ache from biting down something he can’t take back. Whether it’s cold fury or the heat of a worn-out, ongoing battle, their disagreements are loud without ever having to say a word.
Even to Sam, it’s weak, and he can’t blame Cas for the way his face falls, just a little, just for a moment. It’s replaced almost as quickly with something fierce and familiar, Castiel the soldier making his reappearance. “What do
He watches somewhat warily as Cas makes his way to one wall, peering at the various t-shirts and armbands and creepy big-headed dolls that line the shelves. “You don’t think this place is a little… I don’t know, uh. Much?” he asks, unsure of the word he’s looking for. And yeah, okay, the tats on the girl’s arm are pretty cool. And wait is that a sunshade with the Millennium Falcon on it? That’s actually pretty freaking–
Sam cleared his throat, some of the happiness fading from his smile to be replaced with hesitancy as he looked down for a moment. “And, uh, what about you?”
"So, uh," he says, and clears his throat, more as a distraction than any real desire to make conversation. "You did good today. Thanks. For tagging along, I mean. Even if it wasn't really your choice to get beamed down."
Cas has moved closer, closer than even the meager distance they usually inhabit, and the wry twist to his smile and the unreadable gleam in his eyes sends Dean's pulse through the roof. "Uh, Cas?" The angel's got him all but pressed up to the side of the table. And yes, he wants this, has wanted it for years, but what's always seemed barely possible in dreams is excruciating now.
. He didn’t feel anything besides the pain from his forearm. No clawing aggression, no disconnect, no emptiness digging its way out of his chest. “I think it worked, Sammy,” he said, and was astonished by the immediate onslaught of feeling that sentence brought. Guilt and horror and regret crashed upon him like a tsunami, filling the holes in him in waves. Damn, it felt like it’d been years since he’d
Dean opened it, leafing through the first few pages. “Any chance I could get the cliff notes?” he asked, grimacing. He was too tired for the English in the file, much less the shorthand, Latin, and Enochian notes scattered throughout.
“Hey, wait a sec, hang on,” Dean interrupts, reaching out to grab the sleeve of Cas’s sweatshirt. “What’s going on?”
Being talked about like he’s not in the room is annoying as hell, and while it’s not enough to puncture the contentment Sam feels at how things have turned out, it’s still enough to make him scowl a bit. “Mind filling me in?”
And his brain reboots. It stutters, made dizzy and scattered by the thickness of the air, but there's something
His nerves are still humming from seven hours on the road, but still he strips down to his boxers and shirt and flops down onto his bed. The memory foam is a godsend beneath his aching muscles, but sleep doesn’t seem to want to come. Two hours later, he’s sick of staring at the cracks in the ceiling above his bed. There’s no way he’s sleeping anytime soon.
. It does, and it’s not what Sam wants at all. But this is a new beginning for all of them, and it’s not just Dean who needs to learn to let go.
“Yeah, well, you’re buying me new ones tomorrow,” Dean says, too happy and overwhelmed to even fake grumpiness.
He meant it to be reassuring, but Cas seemed anything but. “Perhaps.” He cleared his throat, maybe to diffuse the tension, but it rapidly turned to a series of coughs that sounded far too real and painful to be a distraction.
Sam just shrugged. “One way to find out, I guess?” he said, sounding so damn optimistic that Dean didn’t have the heart to get pissed. He’d seen how frantic Sam had been, how willing he’d been to believe Dean when he’d insisted for weeks that he was fine, how desperately he’d begged Dean to tell him that he’d had had no other choice. He knew his brother was just as, if not more, terrified of what happened next as he was.
It’s so stupid, how Sam can feel his cheeks heating up, but he can also feel a real, honest-to-God (and okay, there’s a bunch of phrases that are going to feel weird for a good while) smile growing, too, and he ducks his head. It’s happiness, he thinks, and it’s as unfamiliar and terrifying as it is exciting. There’s still so much to deal with – starting with the fact that he doesn’t even know what his ‘happy ending’ looks like, only that, yeah, okay, starting it out with Eileen is as good an idea as any – but for once, maybe he can look at the unknown as a good thing instead of looking for ways it might come back to bite him in the ass. Maybe he can let himself be happy. Huh. The urge to fight back his smile is still there, but he scratches his jaw and forces himself to let it be. When he looks back up, he half-expects Dean to tease him, but the smile on his brother’s face is genuine, if a little tired.
He turned, hoping he didn’t look nearly as exposed and embarrassed as he felt, and opened his mouth, a half-assed joke and an apology on the tip of his tongue. Cas was completely frozen but for how his eyes were darting from one table to the next. It stung a little, seeing the obvious discomfort and alarm in his friend’s eyes, and the words died in his mouth. Dean floundered for a long, painful moment -- and then he noticed it. The other occupants of the room were still chattering and eating, stuck in the memory’s time loop. But they were all crisp and clean, none of the details muddled or ambiguous, even those Dean couldn’t recall noticing before. And there was something… He peered closer at the couple nearest to where he was standing, and once it clicked, his jaw dropped. What he was seeing, the flickering lights everywhere at the edges of his vision: they were
Cas shuts the book in front of him and looks up to give Dean a tight smile. “I wasn’t angry about earlier, Dean,” he says, then swings his knees out from under the table and gets to his feet. “I’m well aware that you don’t always express your concern in the most effective ways.” He grabs his mug and starts walking towards the sink. “But I appreciate the apology. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going t--”
Sam doesn’t know what Jack means by help, but his heart aches. Jack saved the world. Faith is something that’s hard to come by these days: it’s been whittled away, chopped and hacked to bits, leaving behind hurt that’s become nothing but knotted scar tissue, and the idea of anything divine pulling the shots is enough to make Sam uneasy. But if there’s anyone he can put his faith in, it’s Jack, Jack who sees the world with such innocence and hope and
Dean wasn’t exactly sure what portal they were talking about, but neither did he particularly care. “Wouldn’t it be easier for him to just grab a meatsuit?” Sure, sucked for the vessels, but trying to find a way into Heaven sounded a hell of a lot more of a pain in the ass.
Dean can't do anything but watch, the emptiness he'd been feeling suddenly full and screaming with grief and anger and panic, a steady mantra of
Cas finally turns to look at him, and the fierceness in his eyes makes Dean falter a moment. “It’s her birthday, Dean.” His voice is low and clear and no-nonsense. “I know you said that I’m nothing to her, that she’s better off alone, but.” He sighs. “She deserves just a little bit of happiness.”
She hesitated, then carefully set the plate and towel both down. “Has something happened to Castiel?”
Dean swallows. He knows, has known it for years, but hearing the words, hearing how blatant and damning they sound coming out of Cas's mouth is something else entirely. "Yep," he manages, and tries to ignore how choked and alarmed it sounds. He stands, turns, and lets his eyes frantically search the opposite wall, about ready to make his excuses and flee. This is straying too close to territory he's not ready to wade into. "So, uh, glad you're okay, buddy," he starts, but when he turns around to continue his feeble goodnight, the words die on his tongue.
Alarm bells were ringing by the dozen in his ears. Shit, if Cas was going downhill this fast, they had even less time than they’d been counting on. The worry that there’d be no one to take him out was undeniably fresh in Dean’s mind, but it had been wholly eclipsed by panic and fear for Cas himself. He wanted to call the whole thing off, to go back to Earth and switch gears, sending Sammy looking for possible solutions to Cas’s predicament instead of his own. Hell, chances were they’d have a lot better luck with the Grace situation than the Mark. He knew, though, that there’d be no convincing Cas to turn back now. The stubborn son of a bitch was as bad as he and Sam that way. So if leaving wasn’t an option, they needed to get to Ramiel, and preferably soon. “Are you gonna be able to hold out long enough to even get to Ramiel?”
He’d always thought Cas would kiss like a storm. It’d be lightning, electric and frantic and sharp and bright and lighting up every nerve in his body. But while there’s a deep, slow rumbling of contentment rising in his chest, it’s less thunder and more the earth beneath them finally settling. It’s more like the sun has finally come out, warm and steady and real. He can taste the cinnamon of Cas’s tea and-- chocolate? The sudden laugh that bubbles up makes it hard to keep kissing. “You ate my stash of cookies, didn’t you,” he mumbles against Cas’s lips, more of a statement than a question.
So now Sam’s left with… whatever is going on here. Some of his bewilderment must show on his face, because Dean tears his gaze away from Cas to look at Sam, and whatever he sees there makes him grin, glee replacing the almost shy look there. “See, and Sammy still has no goddamn idea what just happened, does he?”
Yeah, this was going to be fan-frigging-tastic. They all waited, sitting in silence for a moment before Dean cleared his throat. “Care to elaborate?”
The only thing that threatens the grin on Sam’s face is when Jack’s own smile falters for a moment and he turns to him with big, sad eyes. “I wasn’t sure,” he admits, and it’s hard to hear him over the clatter of Dean running around, gathering what Jack said he needed to open a doorway into the Empty. “If it was the right thing, to get Castiel. He can help, I know he can, but… is this wrong? Or selfish? Am I starting down the same path as Chuck?”
Cas’s hands have moved to Dean’s hips, pressing him even more insistently into the counter. He would complain about the way the edge of it is digging into his lower back, but then Cas’s leg shifts, pressing their hips flush against one another and holy shit, he’s not complaining about anything digging anywhere, nope, he’s totally good. “Fuck,” he manages, breath coming fast when he drops his head against Cas’s shoulder.
“And if it was Sam in your place? Could you do it?” Cas asked, as though he didn’t know the answer. As though it hadn’t
Gone is the comfortable quiet, and in its place is something awful, tense and panicky. “Go?” Sam asks, at the same time that Dean stands and says, louder, “What?”
He tried to ignore how watery Sam’s usual bark of laughter sounded. “Yeah, Dean,” Sam said, a wobbly grin taking over his face. “Sounds like a plan.”
“Uh, yeah, that’s great,” Dean said, barely stopping himself from rolling his eyes. Frigging fascinating. “But what does this have to do with the Mark?”
-- said, its voice completely unlike the usual gravel-rough one Dean was used to, but somehow familiar at the same time. It was like looking at the sun from underwater, the light wavering and refracting, twisting into shapes completely unrecognizable. Dean could just make out a figure that looked like a bird in the vaguest sense of the word, and caught glimpse of something that reminded him of lightning, and then the sound of metal clashing, the flutter of wings, the unbearable heat of a fire… His eyes were burning, but he couldn’t look away, rooted to the spot as the pillar of light flashed a few more times, then turned back into Cas.
Gabriel picks a glass up off the table nearest to where he paces and throws it at the wall, where it shatters.  Balthazar jumps at the sound, but Castiel is too far gone to even react.
As Castiel decides this, they arrive, finally, at the entrance to the library.  Crowley places his hand on a golden plate, located where a doorknob should be, and it faintly smokes red before clicking open.  “It will open for you too,” he explains, and then gives Castiel a significant look “but NOT for any of the other demons.  Not while you are inside.  That was the deal.”
He goes in to the gas station to pay, and he buys a bottle of water and a bag of gummy bears for Cas.  Fuckin’ angel loves gummy bears, though he would never admit it.  They go missing, when Castiel is around.
A dozen rituals, a dozen spells, come unbidden, lining up in his head to answer, magic that needs a blood sacrifice, and he sorts them automatically, trying to understand what is going on, but none of them fit.  Wrong number of people. Wrong shaped knives.  Wrong robes; Latin, not Sumerian.  None of the rituals he calls to mind need Lucifer.  None need him, Dean or Righteous Man or Master, for that matter, and that seems to be important since all these suicidal fucks keep saying “For you” as their last fucking words.
He thinks he's going to die.  He wishes he still had Raphael’s grace inside him, to help him weather this.  He cannot bear it, only a mortal, with a weak, mortal heart.  A heart that is too weak for this, too weak by far.  It will stop.  And then he will still not move.  He will die like this.
Tears leak out of the corners of both of Castiel’s closed eyes, simultaneously.  They drip down his temples and pool on his pillow.  “You mean, ‘don’t.”  He doesn’t try to hide that he is crying.
Dean wakes up on his back, on his couch, with Castiel still curled around his shoulder, little arms still wrapped around his neck, head rested against his jaw, still snoozing and huffing little coo-snores.  Their nap was sleepy and sweet, and Dean doesn’t want to wake back up, stumble around with bony feet on hard floors making dinner in the too bright, buzzing light before getting to go back to that sleep again.  Being awake now only feels sharp and cotton mouthed and exhausting. It’s Saturday evening, and Dean wants to skip trying to wake back up to listlessly make hamburger helper and just as listlessly eat it just to make time before he can go back to sleep.  He just wants to snuggle Castiel to his chest and climb the stairs to his bedroom and slip under the covers and drift down into that perfect sleep feeling again. Mmmm. His eyes slip closed, and his right hand strays up to stroke one of Castiel’s tentacles.  It is still so soft and smooth, and now it is warm from the sun, and Castiel’s coos turn to little gurgles as he strokes.
Castiel can feel it, through the bond.  The fear, oozing black and cold through the hot shame.  Castiel squeezes Dean's hand.  He will clean away that fear, black and oily, throughout the eons, until there is nothing left.  He thinks it is a little less now, than it was before the cliff, a little melted by the sun they called together.
He knows how to be strong, for Castiel, how to be steel.  His cock grows fuller, heavier, with every movement against Castiel's body, and he starts to fuck against him longer, harder.  He cages Castiel's body in with strong arms, unnaturally strong.  Inescapable.  Steel.  Castiel's exhales become soft, high, little “uh”s, released on every thrust.  It's sweet and it pierces right into Dean, his cock, his heart, the ache in his lungs.  “Need more, Cas.  Need you,” he pleads.
But Dean wouldn’t move away.  His lips would be right there, to meet Castiel’s, and they would be soft and smooth and a little cold from the blood loss, the alcohol.  Castiel would kiss them.  He didn’t really know how, but he would kiss Dean’s lips with his own until he couldn’t breathe, anymore.
“Crowley wouldn't fucking dare,” Dean feels his eyes go black, thinking about Crowley there in his room with Cas.  “I'll kill him,” he snarls.  Sam looks mildly shocked at the ferocity of this, although Dean knows that in general Sam is not averse to putting Crowley out of his misery.
widening, and darkening with lust.  That the moment was endangering Castiel's rule.  Because Castiel felt Dean's pulse of
Dean looks down at Cas.  “Cas?” Castiel looks up at him.  “Cas.” He says again, pointing at Cas, then “Dean,” he says, pointing at himself.
Sam smiles too, though his eyes are grim.  “I probably wouldn’t have killed him.  Sometimes,” he pauses as they reach the door to the library, and Castiel holds a suddenly glowing hand up to unlock it.  “Sometimes I feel kind of sorry for him, you know?”
, Castiel; that what Dean needs more than anything right now is something that Castiel can give him.  He would give Dean anything.  He has given himself:  his rebellion against Heaven, his death, his fall from Grace.  He would give more.  Name it, he would kill it.  He would conquer the stars.  He would destroy the sun.  He would sunder the moon and end the tides, forever.  He would empty the sea.  He can give Dean this.  He can give Dean softness, and sweetness.
But Castiel is watching him too closely.  “Hello, Dean,” he says. “Do you feel rested?”  like it is such an important question, and he asks it so solemnly into the quiet night, like he is a news anchor and Dean a dictator and Castiel is asking him when he will set his people free.
“Wings,” Cas says, joyfully, a tear leaking down his cheek, high out of his mind on Dean and the water and the soft moss, and so, so, delighted.  Dean's wings are so beautiful.  He loves them so much.  And Dean has brought them out for him, to protect him. This is what he wants.  Dean understands.  Dean loves him so well.  His heart grows so large it aches inside him.
It feels strange, being so pressed up against Cas’s mouth when he grins, but Dean wouldn’t trade the feeling for anything in the world. “I was annoyed at you and wanted something sweet. It seemed the best course of action.”
He was expecting to see that barren field and a young Sammy staring up at him, or maybe his mom smiling down at him and offering him a piece of pie, or even some white expanse of nothing closer to what he’d first imagined Heaven would be like. Once his eyes adjusted, though, he saw it was none of the above.
“It’s suicide,” he seethed, his grip on the wheel tightening. He knew, rationally, that perhaps he shouldn’t be getting this angry: he’d do the same, had done the same plenty of times. But it was too familiar and too infuriating, this back-and-forth, hypocritical-as-fuck dance of ‘my life isn’t worth as much as yours’ that they’d been playing for years, and he was sick of it, especially now, when there was really only one option.
, you dumbass,” he’d say, and then finally grow a pair and kiss him like he’s dreamed about for way too fucking long. And they’d all live happily ever after.
Something too nervous to be a smile lights on Dean’s face and he laughs, thin and reedy, and says, “See, here was me thinking everyone saw past all my bullshit, but hell, even Sam’s got no fucking clue.”
That made two of them. Dean could feel his face beginning to burn. He itched to turn back to the sink and be done with this.
Cas was silent for a long moment. He probably knew what was coming and was figuring out how best to answer, Dean figured, which was why he was a bit surprised when Cas then said, “Anything.”
“You’re looking better,” he said, and then was struck with the oddest sense of déjà vu. It felt like it’d been a million years since the last time they were here having a similar conversation.
“Human bodies aren’t meant to be in Heaven.” He stopped, sucked in a deep, unsteady breath, and then began moving again with a small nod in Dean’s direction. “Obviously it’s not impossible for them to enter, or any angels on Earth would need to vacate their vessels before returning,” he said as they walked on, and Dean frowned, remembering the whole mess with Jimmy Novak. It had been a bloody, messy catastrophe, from beginning to end, and he could definitely understand how it would be something the angels would avoid at all cost. “It only requires a small amount of Grace to tie the body to our true form.”
There’s this thing that Cas has become good at: he’ll find someplace to sit, usually at the kitchen table or in one of the chairs in the war room, crack open a book or something with a mug of coffee or tea, and just… exude this aura of indifference. He somehow manages to make his disapproval of whatever it is Dean’s done recently very clear without doing a damn thing. It’d be impressive if it wasn’t so annoyingly efficient. So when Dean shuffles into the brightly-lit kitchen to find Cas in the corner with a book and a mug of spicy-smelling tea, he just sighs and heads over to the coffee machine.
“Hot Topic?” Dean reads, casting a skeptical look at the storefront. It’s decorated in reds and blacks and looks like an emo kid’s wet dream. “What the hell?”
“The whole trip.” Dean tried to say it teasingly, to keep things light, but he could hear the worry that came through of its own volition. He faked a cough and reached for the door to try and cover it, unsure if he could handle another iteration of ‘I’m fine’ from Cas at the moment. “Sam said he’d try to find stuff in the Men of Letters archive about soul magic when I called him. Who knows, maybe he’s found something.”
And that’s… not what Sam expected at all. But beyond the knee-jerk ‘wait what?’ reaction that has his mouth dropping it makes sense. Still sad, and still awful, and still makes that little throb of pity in his chest known, but of course. Of course Dean wouldn’t be able to sit still long enough to figure out what he wants out of life while Cas is still in the Empty. His guilt has always run deeper than Sam’s – and that’s saying something – and while of course Sam is grieving, and of course Sam is horrified that Cas is doomed to an eternal sleep at best, and of course Sam is going to miss him, already misses him something fierce, it’s always been different for Dean. It was what started the whole path of dominoes that led to Cas coming into their lives in the first place: he’d never been able to say goodbye.
The fistful of cotton relaxes as Cas sighs and droops, like all the fight goes out of him at once. Except, no, that isn’t quite right, Dean realizes, it’s more like he’s accepted the loss of one battle and is steeling up for another. “I believed, or rather hoped,” Cas says, the words deliberate and weary, “that we were finally going to discuss what’s been going on the past few weeks. But I… it’s fine, Dean. Thank you for the apology, even if it wasn’t necessary.”
And when the night comes on Earth and Dean slips into dreams, Castiel does not wait, he spirals down out of the sky, golden banded, dressed in white again, arms overflowing with flowers, and lands at Dean’s side.  He sits cross-legged with his knees against Dean’s, and drops his load of flowers on Dean's chest, and says “I’m going to make you a crown.”
Castiel's shirt is loose on his body and Dean pushes it up easily.  Cas raises his arms and ducks his head and he is free.
When Castiel woke again, world fading in to his awareness through a cloud of green,  it hurt a little less.  Just a little bit.  He was still freezing.  His blood still felt like poison.  His shoulders were still aching and raw, where his wings had been sliced away.  He was exhausted, though he had been sleeping, from the trauma.  But it hurt a little less.  He was laid out on his stomach, sweat-damp sheets twisted around his legs.  Dean’s hand rested heavy and warm in the center of his back.  Dean.  Warm.  He began to drift back to sleep.
Dean was obeyed, after that.  Castiel was obeyed, after that.  The demons thought they were lucky that they hadn't all been killed.  They were right.  Dean had considered killing them all, or letting Castiel do it.  After Yeteriel, after he realized he could.  But if there were no demons, then there would be no one else to put souls on the rack but Dean and Cas.  And Dean didn't think they could do that.  He didn't think they could be the only ones.  He didn't want that to be all that they had or could have in their lives, just pain and blood and the rack for eternity.  It would keep the Mark quiet, but it would be no kind of life.  He didn't want that for himself.  And he wanted it even less for Cas.  So he let them live.  The weak ones, the stupid ones, the ones that hadn't challenged him and wouldn't.
He thinks a bunny might be a good idea, but he learns from the little card on the side of the bunny cages that they don’t like to be snuggled.  Snuggling is job 1 for a pet, in Dean’s book.  And also jobs 2 and 3.
Dean’s eyes narrow against the sun, looking up at Castiel.  Dubious, he asks:  “You gonna stay with me, Cas?”  The last thing Dean said to him yesterday, the first thing today. The most important thing.  Always.  Crown or sword or iron or salt.
He must have fallen asleep while he was counting.  He doesn't quite remember exactly how far he got, but he does remember reaching 579,331, because it is a prime.  He decides he will start there again, because he is not calm, he is not rested, he is not ready to get out of the tub and make a plan.  But he has to be.  He has to get there.  For Dean.  For himself, and his sanity. He inhales, shaky, and winds his fingers into his blankets, and starts to count, to the beat of his heart.  579,332.  Dean.  579,333.  Dean.  He will count Dean's name a million times.  He will count a million heartbeats, pulsing ice from his heart through his veins, and all of them will have Dean's name.
“News flash, Cas.  I don’t give a shit what she likes and doesn’t like.  She doesn’t get to just come in here, and drop a corpse on my floor, and call you… call you…” he blushes and gets too flustered to actually say it.  “Does she not know I can follow her, wherever she goes?  That I SHOULD follow her, and end her miserable…”
This garage is someone's mom’s garage, he’s sure of it; most of it's been cleared out to make room for the devil's trap, but there are oils stains on the floor, there's a Schwinn 10 speed hanging from a hook in the corner, and if that isn't the spare tire of a Honda Civic rolled over against the back wall then Dean never worked in a salvage yard.  There are no posters of The Crow or pewter statues of Cthulhu or black velvet curtains or waxy sandalwood candles or whatever it is Goths these days are in to, like Dean would even know, and the six cultists huddling in front of Dean are all 100% absent of eyeliner, hair dye, or face piercings.  Just regular dudes, a little on the scrawny side, in red robes belted by coarse rope.  So.  Not Goths.  Not what Dean expected
Dean starts to feel nauseas, and then dizzy, and within three steps he is down on his knees.  The air is so heavy. Being alive, is so heavy. He has forgotten how to breathe. He has forgotten how to walk.  He has forgotten how to eat anything that isn't poison. He has forgotten how not to be afraid.
“Dean,” he said, just one word, and it quavered.  “He… I can feel him.  He needs me… He calls to me.  My charge, he calls.”  He was shaking.
But this is what makes the scales unbalance, and allows Castiel to choose one state of the two that are pulling him apart:  Castiel knows that as soon as Dean is off the phone, and Cas can’t hear him any more, and there is no honey voice dripping over him, the cold will come back, and the fear, and the spinning in his mind.  And he knows that he can’t bear it.  He knows this, he has learned it over the last three days.  He
So instead of summarizing his book, he asks Castiel, “Did you really want it?”  His mouth closes sharply, taken aback by what has come out of it.
,” Castiel hissed in response.  “You shouldn’t have killed him so quickly.  You shouldn’t have bothered with him at all.  You should have let me have him.  I would have shown him the wrath of the Lord.”  Castiel's hand was locked tight around his angel blade, and his eyes were on fire.  Dean wanted him, entirely, then, the bloodlust of his fight with Belial turned into something else, something softer and warmer that crashed against his heart just the same.
“NO?!” Uriel roars, enraged that this lump of meat has defied him, even this long.  He crushes Dean's head between his two hands and holds their foreheads together for a moment before calm returns to him, and he smiles his horrible smile again.
He had wondered, when he was in Sam’s room, whether being in Dean’s room without Dean would be comfortable or uncomfortable.  It is neither of those, he realizes now.  Being in this room, and not being able to touch Dean, to hold him, to whisper to him that he is loved and that he will never be alone again:  it only makes him sad.  Not comfortable or uncomfortable.  Only sad.  He can’t go back into the past, and comfort those lonely Deans that stitched themselves up on this bed.  He can’t pull them close.  They are lost to him, like his wings, and his grace, and all else that dwells in the past.
Sam barely hears him.  “Some of these titles I’ve read, some of them I only recognize, and some of them I’ve never even heard of.  This is… thanks Cas.  Thanks.”  He pulls a stack of scrap papers over towards him, quarters of several different colored sheets that at one time were flyers on their printed sides:  advertisements for adult education classes, lost dog announcements, coloring book pages.  He picks up one of the golf pencils that sits in a box beside them, and starts writing down Dewey decimal notations.
He chose to ignore it, when Dean’s heart called out to his.  He wasn’t selfish.  He let Dean have his life.  His safe, comfortable life.  He didn’t ruin it.  He was sure, so sure, convinced, that that was the truest way to show his devotion.
Dean emerges from the cabin’s bedroom, ready to confront the messengers of Heaven with a baseball bat from the hall closet.  Old, sticky tape crosshatches its grip, and his knuckles are white around it.
He paused for a moment, at the end, breathing heavily, not from the exertion of reciting the poem but from the intensity of emotions it summoned. “Always, Dean.” He said, a little shyly.  “Want you to know that.  Always.”
He is wrong.  The pain slices through Dean, the pain and the claim and the fire and the golden light and the feeling of belonging to this deity, this god, for all of eternity, and it is too much for him.  He cannot control himself, no matter what he has been asked.  He comes.  He comes in fountains, on his stomach, his chest, on Castiel and Castiel’s other hand, still on his hip.
“Fuck ‘shouldn’t,” Dean says easily, eyes still closed.  “I’m right here with you, sweetheart.  You ain’t doin’ no wrong.”
“Me too, Cas, “ Dean murmurs, against Cas’ chest.  “But not anymore, right?  We’re gonna be together now.  We’re gonna make up for it.”
Castiel is silent, and only holds on to Dean, and stares into the blackness of the Pit with eyes hard as stone, searching, waiting.  They should be going, he knows, he should spread his wings, he should pick up his charge and hold him to his heart--
“No.”  Castiel interrupts him with a command, absolute.  Lightning strikes and hits a tree, it cracks and groans as it crashes to the ground.  Castiel withdraws his tongue.  He withdraws his head from between Dean’s legs.  He withdraws the touch of his body, except for where he holds Dean down.  “No.  Not yet.”  He’s not done with Dean.  There is so much more, that he has imagined.  The wind is barely more than a breeze, but he lets it pass over Dean, cooling down his skin, banking the fire there.  “Not yet.”
So Uriel is able to remain smug when he touches Dean's crumpled body, and returns it to its sun bleached tomb.
“Nope, not really.  I’ve already got a Blade that came with a price.  Been there.  Done that.  Not interested.  Definitely not interested for Cas.”
Dean pauses.  He turns his head and tries to look down at Castiel, though it is hard to do without crossing his eyes with Castiel right up against his neck.
It doesn't matter.  Less than if a draft had blown out a candle.  Less than if a speck of dust had flickered in the torchlight.  It doesn't matter at all, this portent of blood and fire.
Castiel's cheeks warm up, and he holds Dean closer, sitting back on the floor instead of on his knees so he can pull Dean into his lap.  Dean doesn't resist.  He's so pliant, now, drained.  He wraps his arms around Castiel's waist loosely, and rests his head against Castiel's chest.  His wings cocoon tiredly around them.
“Fuck ‘shouldn’t,” Dean says easily, eyes still closed.  “I’m right here with you, sweetheart.  You ain’t doin’ no wrong.”
“Hey, Cas, Cas, no, Hey.  Hey, look at me.”  This is wrong.  This is all wrong.  He’s not making it better.  Cas isn’t warm against him.  Cas is shaking and being torn apart on his jagged scars.
Dean rolled the daffodil stem over in his mouth, eyes hooded, dangerous.  “Will you kiss my neck, too, Castiel?  Will you kiss my shoulders, and my hands, and my chest?”
Castiel whines.  He wants more, too, he wants to feel Dean’s entire body naked beneath him, but this feels so
He moves over Cas, covering him with his body, hiding him away with his arms.  “Never again,” Dean breathes over him, “No one is going to hurt you like that ever again, Cas.” He brings out his wings, to hide Cas better.  Hide him and treasure him, his sweet, precious angel, and keep him only for his own.  Hide him from everything in the world that might hurt him.  This is how he should take care of Cas.  This is what he promised.  This is what Cas wants.  Not Dean striding through a burning forest.  Not the madness that comes with owning a world.  He wants this.  Dean, above him, around him.  This is what Dean should give.  Will give.
“A halo.”  Castiel's mind races again.  Unlinked to an angel’s grace, they're just bracelets, aren't they?  Sure, gold, but certainly not valuable enough to matter to Crowley for their material worth.  Dean wears Castiel's own, but for Castiel that is purely symbolic, a gesture with no power whatsoever.  It doesn't bind them, it doesn't give Dean any angelic powers, or any powers over Castiel.  But then, they've never really researched what it might do... He's never heard of… he doesn't know…
.  He feels Castiel like Castiel is an electrical field and he is dispersed everywhere, all around, on Dean’s skin, stimulating every cell, in the air, electrifying Dean’s lungs, on the ground, zapping into Dean’s legs and making them weak like water, streaming into his brain and filling it with zig zags and static and the sound of screeching metal, vibrating across his hips, his cock, making it so hard it hurts where it is trapped in his pants..
“No,” Dean says, though the mention of food makes his stomach growl.  He doesn’t know how to be hungry, any more, he thinks, or he shouldn’t.  He thinks it would hurt, to eat; his stomach grown shriveled and small and cut apart so many times.  He thinks that food would taste like ash, and burn through his veins like poison, since it is black smoke that pulses there, not blood.  He thinks about cutting himself open, to see it. To let the smoke just float away until he is empty, empty. His eyes hood over, and his right hand scratches lightly at his left wrist.  It would feel so good, to be empty. To just not feel anything at all.
“Mmm.”  Castiel kisses Dean on his forehead, as lightly as he can, then each of his cheekbones, the top of his chin.  “Like that?” He asks, breathlessly.
Sam crosses the room and picks up his bag.  He’s subtle when he feels for the secret pocket, subtle in his disappointment that the knife inside is gone, but Castiel notices anyway.  Sam opens the bag up and pulls out a clean plaid shirt.  He has been wearing the one he has on, burnt orange and red, for days, since Dean and Castiel summoned him to the Pit.  “You mind?” he says, as he pulls out a clean pair of jeans and starts to unbutton his dirty shirt.  His new one is black and green.
Charlie said 3, but they arrive at 1.  Dean thinks that the lakefront might be a lot for Castiel to handle, with the sun and the sounds of all the other people and the scents of frying catfish, and Charlie might
, into a kind of red-tinted euphoria where nothing hurt and he couldn’t imagine anything ever hurting him again.  He roared in the Impala down empty midwestern interstates at 100 MPH, banging his hand on the roof and singing along with his tapes at the top of his lungs.  When he stopped at night he drank tequila and picked fights and beat up assholes and felt even better.   He was unstoppable, he was invincible, he was alive and howling at the moon and he didn’t
Castiel closes his eyes, and leans his face into Dean’s chest.  A tear drips down his face, onto Dean, and he thinks it might fall there on true-Dean, in their bed, as well.  The tear drips down because he knows this is not how true-Dean would answer him.  He knows that true-Dean would deny that he is a hero at all, that he has only ever done what had to be done and that he did not gleam when he did it but fumed and smoked.  He knows that true-Dean only feels anxiety that Castiel feels also, through the bond, whenever Castiel calls him ‘hero’.  True-Dean does not feel pride, not righteousness, he does not feel that he is the only one that could carry the flag.  He feels only anxiety, every time, that he will not live up to the name.
“We could take his brother,” wheezes Scylla, entering the conversation for the first time.  “We could take his brother, then he would let us go.  His brother is his weakness.  His only weakness.  That is what is whispered, from the Cage.”
Castiel touches him gently, thumbs under his eyelids, swiping and turning his freckles to gold, more gold, more shining, warmth, heat, beauty.  “Are you ready for me now, hero?”  He asks.  But he knows.  Every question he has asked, all night, he has known.  God in this field, in this valley.  A lightning strike.
secrets.  This one is bloody, it tastes like copper, it lets her savor the Master’s blood, spilled, a hurt that surely healed before anyone else got to see it.  This one is sweet, the Master was lured, he was injured, he does not know all, he does not see all.  He is not the perfect warrior that the rest of the Pit believes him to be.  This one fills her heart:  the Master is weak, he is human, he probably felt bad watching the other humans kill themselves and pray his name.  This one is dangerous:  who might these cultists be, who might be behind them, to find a way to hurt the Master?  Mmmmmm.
Just before the tip of the pen touches his skin, Sam reaches out, toward him.  “Woah!  Right now?  Just like that?  What about Dean?”
“Cas.”  Dean says again, more certain.  His hand stretches out, and the First Blade appears.  He holds it hilt first towards Castiel.  “Anything.”
“OK, Cas, it’s OK,” he says.  “Just gotta take care of you. Don’t want to scare you.  Just want you to have everything you need and be comfy and feel safe, OK?  OK, Cas?”
He doesn’t understand.  This is not the way an adversary should act.  This blade is powerful, ancient, priceless.  Why would she want to give it, to Castiel.  “You want to give this to--”
Castiel squints again.  “You don’t like ‘fresh air’” (air quotes).  “You think it is for ‘hippies’ and ‘girls named Sam’”
Watch, and touch.  It will be enough.  It is so much more than he thought he would ever… It means so much.  It will be enough.
He obeys, slowly, and one degree at at time, he lifts his head to meet Dean’s gaze with his own.  His breath catches in his chest, and then he stops breathing entirely.  He is seeing Dean’s eyes for the first time.  Without cosmic radiation overlain on them, without the light of his soul leaking out from behind them, golden and blinding.  He is seeing them for the first time, and they have never been this beautiful.  They are green.  So green.  He has never seen green before.  And they are flecked with little specks of gold, a million of them, a pattern like Dean’s freckles but brighter, more complicated.  His lips part and he is lost in trying to see all the details in that pattern.  His left hand rises, of its own volition, and holds Dean’s face, gently, a thumb passing lightly over Dean’s cheekbone.
.   He remembers what beauty is.  He remembers that things can be beautiful, instead of at best only functional, or not-sharp, or not-burning.
it.  He loves it that Dean wants him, like this.  He loves that it is hard, and sharp, and that it is going to hurt him sweetly tomorrow.
He drove home, ate dinner, washed the dishes, watched TV too late, all like a zombie, Lisa pretending that she didn't notice, that everything was fine, carrying the weight of conversation for two, while Dean was barely present, his heart and his mind already back in that field, or still there, never having left the night before.  And in bed, when Lisa lay already sleeping sweetly beside him, breath soft and unburdened, Dean stared mute up at the ceiling, detached, so unsure about what the night would bring, or even what he wanted it to bring.
“Yeah Cas, I summoned him, though I’m not convinced this is actually him.  But, yeah, whatever is wearing his body, yes, it’s here with me in the bunker.”
I will mark you here,” Castiel says, suddenly, breaking the long silence that has built up between them.  His voice is certain, strong.  His first two fingers rest behind Dean's left ear.
Dean only stares into his eyes, in answer.  Green flashing, pupils wide.  He tilts his chin down a fraction, and then back up.
Dean does not consider anything but that Castiel’s body is slashed open.  He only heals the cut on Castiel's wrist, and thumbs over the seam, to ease it; he does not ask himself questions about what it might mean.  He only raises the healed wrist to his mouth, and kisses, it, to make sure it is sealed and whole again.  Castiel is Dean’s angel, always, and Dean will heal all his hurts and ease them, always, no matter whether he bleeds red or black or blue or not at all.
Crowley is too slick, for that.  He doesn’t even look up at Castiel while he speaks, his eyes fixed on the halo.  “Sorry, Feathers, ‘spilling my guts while I braid your hair’ wasn’t part of the deal.  My reasons are my own.  Now.  My halo.”   He holds his hand out, expectantly.
Castiel watched over him, and did for him what he could.  For Dean’s body, he would expel wisps of grace, dim and fragile in the night’s dark.  He would not heal Dean completely, because if he did Dean would wake surly and resentful, and tell Cas that he should not waste his grace on his worthless bones, since they were just going to get broke again anyway.  As if that could ever be a waste.  As if there was any cause on Heaven or Earth Castiel would rather expend his grace on than healing Dean’s weary body.
Maybe he won't call Crowley ‘Serpent ’ anymore .  At least not for a while.  At least not until Crowley tries to deal again for a kiss from Dean.
Castiel frowns at him.  “There is no stairway to Heaven, Dean.  There are only a small number of interdimensional portals.”
Gabriel was such an asshole, Ana did not want want to believe he was right, about anything.  Though maybe he was, just this once..  Maybe he understood
And then he flies.  The corpse is still smoking, still slumping to the ground when Castiel turns and takes wing.  Dean watches him rise above the rack, rise up into the smoke and ash of the Pit, a bright firefly in the darkness, and just when Dean can’t see him anymore, just when he flies too high and vanishes, the dream changes.  Zoom, zoom.
Her eyes narrow.  “And what do you want in exchange?” Secrets about the Master are valuable, in the Pit.
“Yeah, but--” Castiel knows what Dean would argue:  that it was only a scratch, that it was an accident, that it's already healed.  Besides the point.  Castiel doesn't need to hear it.
Dean takes a deep breath and his eyes flick to green again.  “‘K, Cas.  Ok.  I'm working on it.  I will.  I'll be with you again in no time.  Promise.”  The burning in his blood flares 10 degrees hotter and then subsides when he says this, so he says it again.  “Promise.”
“Can’t live forever without what’s right, Cas.  Can’t live forever without you.  Don't  wanna. I can deal with a lot of shit, but never that.  Promise me.”
It feels like they could stay sitting this way, just this way, forever.  It feels like nothing else matters.  The calamity that always surrounds them is fading away to a low, dim, buzz.  Sam’s anger, the busted bunker, the demons let loose there:  unimportant.  Far away, when Dean's thumbs test the edge of Castiel's hip bones and feel the skin shift over them.
Charon, ghostly, face obscured by wisps of white hair, fingers long and thin and knobby-knuckled, pale eyes bulging.  Cerebrus, black, gleaming, large as a horse, three-headed, one head snapping in mindless rage, one swivelling with eyes narrowed and ears back, one baring its fangs in a snarl.  Heimdall, martial, unmoving, fully armored and eyes closed, leaning against his two-handed sword.
Castiel sniffled, and tried to take a brave breath, make his voice strong when it tried to only whisper.  “Then he dies.  With no evil threatening him.  With no angels trying to force themselves into his body.  He dies without having to be party to Heaven’s schemes, and Hell’s destruction.  He dies free.”  Castiel did not sound brave.  He sounded like he was  asking a question.
He doesn’t think he will die, first because he can’t and second because that would not fulfill the promise.  So he's not sure what can happen, that is worse than this, but he's sure it isn't good.  And not being able to imagine anything worse has never saved him before. “Sammy,” he bangs his bloody hand on the ground.  “Goddammit Sammy,”
, Dean’s stomach is hard and soft against his cock and the denim of his jeans is so rough and he smells so good, and Castiel’s arms fit perfectly around his neck, and Cas’ rhythm is so easy, and sweet, and he’s getting so close, so hot, and--
Dean hides his reaction to this by kissing again on the tops of Castiel's feet, and then on the arches.  He traces a finger over the left arch, gently, like he is trying to memorize the angle of its rise so he can recreate it in a perfect monument.  Of marble, or ivory.  He smooths his hands up Castiel's legs, over his abdomen, his chest, following with his body until he finds Castiel's wrists.  He spends a long time on these, healing them with careful trickles of his power, making the skin anew, washing and kissing and washing again.  Castiel's fingers start to tingle.
If he scratches a little harder, he knows, it makes Castiel shiver, every light, even his eyes.  But he does not scratch now. His hands freeze. A hot spurt of fear injects itself into his neck, behind his eyes.  Castiel doesn’t make idle conversation. What is this call? Is now the time, when they have to leave this place? When Dean has to go back to being afraid and heavy and hurt?
Dean experiences it as a cloud dispersing, so that all of a sudden he can see all the stars in the sky.  So many stars, and the night doesn’t even seem dark, any more.  It is violet, amethyst, moon-bright.  It is the whole universe, and it is alive.
It is a moment before Castiel appears.  A moment that feels so quiet, so still, so heavy, in the cache.  Dean feels like he is on the edge of a high cliff, and is tipping over, and this is the last moment before gravity presses down and makes the fall inevitable.  Dean is not sure how he could possibly fall even further than his current depths, but he feels the vertigo, and spreads his wings against it just the same.
In their room it is small, and close; unlike the vastness of the throne room. In their room there are no doors, no exits to the outside, unlike the throne room, where Dean can't see all the exits at once, no matter how he sits.  Dean has brought Castiel here, where it smells like them; Dean and Castiel, leather and starlight.  Not the fire and ash of the Pit.  Where the light is golden and warm and flickers on candle tops, not hazy and smoked through.  Where their bed is soft and giving and will cradle Castiel, not hard and sharp like the throne that bruised his back.  This is where Dean can care for Castiel. This is where he will.
Does he have any other allies?  The other humans that might help him:  Bobby Singer, Kevin Tran, Charlie Bradbury, they are all dead, and in Heaven where he cannot reach them.  Almost all of the angels are dead too, against Dean’s blade.  Anael is dead.  Balthazar is dead, at Castiel’s own hand.  Gabriel is dead.  Hannah is alive, but will not leave Heaven for any reason, certainly not to come to the aid of an archdemon.
Knight of Hell, didn't even believe in demons 10 years ago, got this shit on my arm,” he raises the Mark, “Gonna live forever.  You're telling me, it's hard to take.”  He sits down on Sam's ledge, and the expression on his face is almost wry.   “But I don’t know what to do to help you understand, Sam.  You gotta tell me.  Help me figure it out.  You asked Cas for something, and he gave it to you, though it didn’t turn out how you expected.  I’d do the same.”
He thinks he might get a sunburn now, if he doesn’t go retrieve his sunblock before it floats out to sea, but he just can’t find it in himself to care.  Besides, Charlie will probably bring forty-five tubes with forty-five different use cases and be happy to share.
“I would not have asked them any questions.  Dean wanted to ask them questions.  He wanted to find out if they needed killing or just ‘scaring straight,’ find out what they were really up to.  There were some… inconsistencies in their rituals, he wanted to investigate.”
“Want to,” Dean whispers in reply, and gently lays them on their sides.  He gathers Cas in close to him, heat burning off his bare, feverish, chest, and wraps the bed’s blankets up around them carefully, to warm them and hold in the heat of their flushed bodies.  Cas’ skin is so hot, against his own.  He's been running hot, in the final fever of the last of his dying grace burning itself from his body.  Dean thinks he might be seared by it.  Hopes he will be.
That’s not what happens.  If Crowley left any of his creatures, witches or hellhounds or other, spying on Castiel in the armory, they are dead now.  Because a flash of holy light explodes off of Castiel’s wrist, where Raphael’s halo sits, so bright that it seems like it should sear shadows permanently into the walls.  So bright it would blind Castiel, if it didn’t also invade his eyes and change them, make them more and better than they ever had been before.  So bright it would burn him, if it didn't soak into his skin and make it enduring and hard like platinum.
“Sometimes, I thought you might be like rain.  Long wet drops, on my face, on my neck.  Your mouth would be open and you’d press it to me and taste my skin.  Your tongue would be covered in it, in my taste.  It would be all you could think about.”
So instead he replied to Dean.  “You sounded distressed.  I should have asked you.  May I cover your body with mine, Dean?  May I thread my fingers into your hair?” Then, softer, looking away.  “I want to be closer, to you.”
He could have appeared to Dean, then, and given him the kiss they both wished for; he could have held Dean in his arms and kissed him on his lips and they could have floated a hundred feet in the air, heady, dizzy, risen on Castiel’s wings until the sun was too hot on their skin.
For the angel wrapped around him.  Boiling in his blood, the desire to hold on to the dominance of the demon kill and
Castiel does not spiral down out of the sky tonight.  Lightning cracks at Dean’s feet again, and sparks shower over him, and it is so bright that he has to throw his free arm over his eyes.
Dean puts a finger over Castiel’s lips to shush him.  Castiel looks down at it with crossed eyes.  “Then you have to ask.  And I probably won’t tell you.  So then… then, will you hold me Cas?”
As far as Cas knows, the halos are pretty jewelry, nothing more.  And he has been an angel, and had one, for a very long time.  He wouldn't have let Dean keep them ‘piled up on his nightstand’ if they were dangerous.
-- Say return, if he wants to return, hear his name, but only if he wants to hear it, be held, but only if he wants to be held.  He remembers Castiel watching over him. He remembers feeling safe.
been fucked like this.  Never by someone so strong, never by someone that loved him this much.  Never by someone who touched him like he was precious as blown glass but fucked him like he was unbreakable.  Never by a cock so wide and thick and hard that he could feel it in his
Dean hurts.  He hurts.  His fingers are cracked and bleeding, because he is cutting them as he tries to dig down through the corner of his cell with his fingernails.  They tear off and heal and tear off again.  It hurts, it hurts over and over, it hurts every time.  But it hurts less than doing nothing.  He has to get to Castiel.  He has to at least get closer.  His blood is burning him.  He doesn’t know how long it has been since Sam left him, after the phone call, it seems like it has been forever.  Has it been hours?  Days?  Weeks?  And how long has it been in Hell?  A month, a Year?  How long has Castiel been cold, and alone?  He doesn't know.  He doesn’t know and he can’t think about it, because it hurts too much, it spikes through his brain and makes his vision black.
He cannot voice these answers, each so sharp and jagged that they would slice him in half, into pieces that could not put themselves back together.  But Dean is on the other side of the phone, and he can hear Dean’s breath, and he doesn’t know when he will hear it again.  So his mouth opens, and bypasses the whirling of his brain, and tells Dean about his body.  Tells Dean what he needs.  “I’m… Dean, I’m cold.  Without you.  Come back to me.”  He is cold, he realizes.  He dropped his blankets from his body when he knelt to pray to Gabriel and they are still puddled around his knees.  He shivers.
When he is fully seated Dean relaxes back onto his bed of flowers, and shows Castiel his eyes again.  They are flecked with gold, but rimmed with shimmering tears.
The man’s eyes don’t look away when they should, when it would be polite, and they swallow Dean down, down, towards a fall.
“Cas.”  He tries to take Castiel’s hand, wet and sticky though it is.  Cas wipes it off on the blankets and lets him.  He lays down next to Dean so he can hold his hand and look into his eyes, and say, again, “You’re so beautiful,” and when Dean casts his eyes down he keeps talking.  “I didn’t know you needed that, Dean.  I didn’t know that’s what you wanted.  I should have. I should have seen it...That no one ever touches you that way, that no one ever has, no one but me.  I should have remembered, what you were like, our first time.  How gentle, how sweet.  But now I know.  Now, I can give that to you.”
is completely unremarkable.  He feeds it a handful of clover, petting its head gently, smoothing its mane down with reverence and care.  “There there, Dean,” he sings to it in his most angelic voice.  “I’ll take care of you, don’t worry.”  The unicorn nuzzles him, and he nuzzles back.
Why did he settle for enduring?  We can ask this now, in this time, when the universe has bent so far away from his time of banishment.  It is safe, to ask, and not fear the whip.  Why did he let himself be numb, instead of a flame?  He, the hero, the bright one?  For forty years, why?  Where was his plan?  He still had his blood, his brain, his heart; he was still breathing, he had assets-- screwdriver, pliers, box cutter, Alistair’s favor--even if they were meager, and unwanted, so where was his plan?  Even if it was terrible, a one in a million shot, he was already dead, he was already in Hell, how could it get worse?  How did he become so
For three nights after Castiel visited he dreamt of the field, but he was alone there.  Each night he lay with his hands laced behind his head, a piece of grass in his mouth, waiting for an angel to appear in the corona of the sun, and come to him.  Each night wishing that he had never told Castiel not to watch over him.  That he had never said it was creepy.  That he had let Castiel watch over him every single night.  Because now Castiel couldn’t watch over him, any more.  Now, only in dreams.
Dean dresses again.  He kisses Castiel on the forehead, again.  Again, he tells him:  "You stay here.  Just like this," and again Castiel answers, "Of course, Dean."  It hurts, when he leaves, this time.  Not in his heart, it hurts him in his body.  It is a sharp ache, in his chest.  He never wants to leave Castiel again.  Not even for a minute.  Not now that he has him.  All of him.
BUT I WILL BRING THEM ALL because as we have established you are a barbarian and probably let that sweet bab sleep in a stock pot with no toys in it AT ALL AM I WRONG.
“Fuckin’ angel,” Dean growls, as he snaps the last manacle in place, on Cas’ left ankle, and spiders his fingers over Cas’ lean calf.  “Perfect.  How are you always so goddamned good for me?”
And Ana, for her part, thought much the same as she held her brother’s head in her lap.  That here was an angel as they all should have been, an angel that made her proud.  Here was an angel who knew how to love, to be made of love, to show devotion.  She hoped that she could learn, to be like Castiel.  And she hoped that he could find happiness, that he would follow his perfect heart, and that it would lead him to what he deserved with his charge.
"Where do you think Chuck got the unicorn?”  Castiel replies, as if this were obvious, starting to become a little frustrated with Dean’s obtuseness and apparent fixation with the least remarkable part of this entire episode-- he got his
Even less does Dean understand how he could want, so much, what the angel offers:  to be kept here, just like this. He didn’t think he would ever want anything that much, ever again.
his love.  So good.  So true.  His sinking heart turns to stone.  This is what Gary said.  This is why Gary and his cult had lured Dean, drawn his blood, died at his feet.  Not because they hated him.  Not because they wanted to bring forth Lucifer, and destroy the world.
“My sun, my hero,” Castiel mumbles back, as they both fall down into the sleep under the drifted snow on the mountain.  Blackness, closeness, silence.
“Write it in his language then.  In English.  Not in Enochian.  That belongs to you.  That belongs to the firmament.  Give him what already belongs to him, and it will not harm him, it cannot.”
”You are.  Dean.  You’re the only one.  Always,” and he takes Dean’s hand again, and holds it to his heart.
Castiel is not touching him.  They are close, very close, but not touching.  Deliberately not touching.  Castiel’s hands are limp at his sides, his eyes are closed, lids dark, and tears are still streaming down his face.
Instead he wraps one of the blankets tight around his shoulders, over his sweater, and walks to face himself against Dean's nightstand.  The pile of halos is tumbled across its surface and Castiel eyes it thoughtfully.  He picks out the smallest, palest, band from the pile:
The angel was not smiling, hard one, hateful one.  “You survived.”  Disappointed.  “I did not call you here.  Or your… creature.”  His eyes did not leave Scylla’s.  “You know what happened, to Mammon, Belial, Andariel, Duriel, Yeteriel.  They too came when the hadn't been called.”  Yeteriel’s head was not spiked on the throne, anymore, but Scylla remembered.  He had gone to the Cage for the first time, after that.  He did not want to end up a head on a spike.
“Undecided,” Dean answers.  “Depends on if they're up to anything else besides being shitty at Latin; depends on whether I think I can scare ‘em straight.”
He picks up the golden fluffball-- Gabe.  He raises it towards his chest, to see how it would feel snuggled in the cradle of his arm.
Castiel imagines that the argument might take half an hour.  He has witnessed many arguments between the brothers.  30 minutes on Earth.  300 minutes in Heaven.  Eighteen thousand seconds.  The counting grounded him before, gave him something to focus on, gave him an immediate purpose that he could achieve.  So he will count again, he thinks.  He will count again to help him master the panic.  He leans back against the headboard of the bed and closes his eyes, and listens until he can hear the beat of his heart.  He counts its beat eighteen thousand times.  Eighteen thousand times, and when it is over, Dean has not returned to him.  He thinks maybe he counted too fast, maybe his heart is beating double time, because he is so afraid.  So he counts to eighteen thousand again, just to be sure.
“Cas,” Dean’s voice, crackly and breaking and and far away from the phone, but there.  It tears into Castiel’s strong front, a little.  Like the tiny feet of moss that bring down cliff walls.  Just Dean’s voice, just saying his name, undoing him.  “Cas, I’m here.  I’m ok.  Sasquatch just has me pent up in the dungeon, but he’s harmless.”  Dean’s words are light, but it’s a false lightness.  It’s a balloon that can’t float away because it is tied to a cement block.  Dean is trying to be strong, for Cas, and Cas does not know if he can do the same.
“...Then, when I tattoo you with it, it uses my blood as the ink.  And I don’t have to ‘poke’ you a million times.
“I didn't give him what he asked for, at first, though I think I did give him exactly what he wanted.”
Loooonnggg chapter with too much plot and not enough porn, but, shucks, I LOVE BAMF!Cas.  I love sweet, innocent, Cas, the Cas that Dean held and kissed and whispered "I need you," to, but man do I also love it when he raises that dom!eyebrow and BAMFs out.  I guess that's part of what is so amazing, for me, about Castiel's character, that he has both of those aspects.
Sekhmet is nodding, through this, tapping her long fingernails against her desk to the cadence of Castiel's speech.  She does not interrupt.
A reminder, as if any of the demons in the line needed it with Yeteriel’s head still spiked there in front of them:  I killed them, the angels of Heaven.  It was easy.  I could kill you too.  I will, if you hurt my angel.  If you look at him too long.  If you call him with words I don’t like.  Capital M.
And deciding this, his eyes finally track to the coffee table next to him, finally allow him to see that someone is sitting there.
But he didn’t.  He didn’t.  That would be too rash, that would be too much, that would be too soon.  He had only come here to see, for himself.  To see, and hope maybe that he would see that Dean was happy, that Anael was wrong, that Dean was doing fine and that his
“Dean,” he said, just one word, and it quavered.  “He… I can feel him.  He needs me… He calls to me.  My charge, he calls.”  He was shaking.
Only one day, before Castiel will spiral down out of the sky of Dean's dream, again.  This time carrying flowers.  Roses, and peonies, sunflowers, daffodils.  He will spend  all day in the Garden choosing them, choosing the most beautiful, the most fragrant blooms.  Ana will help him in the morning, and smile at him when he hums a sweet song.  It doesn't have words, but she recognizes it.  It sounds like “I love him.”
“I’m sorry, Dean.  This is for the best.”  He takes his right hand out of his pocket, his first two fingers pointed out, reaching for Dean’s forehead.
Castiel’s mouth is red and wet from Dean's kiss, his lips parted around breaths already grown heavy, and Dean wants to be, has to be, inside.  He drives in, tongue deep, and, God, Castiel’s mouth is so hot around him.  Castiel has been ruling in the Pit, and he tastes like fire, and salt.  He is so hot against Dean, clinging to him, wrapping around him, legs around his waist, arms around his shoulders, pulling him in closer, deeper, instinctively, like all his body’s reflexes exist only to pull Dean inside.  Dean has to have him, have him
Dean kisses back, with his hands in Castiel's hair.  When he runs out of breath he leans back, and looks at Cas with tears streaming down his face, and whispers “My angel.” He cradles Castiel closer to him, aligning their bodies on the boulder from ankle to hip to shoulder with the flat width of his wing.  “Forever.  No matter what.”
“Dean,” Castiel says his name, too, and tears are leaking out of his eyes, streaming down his face.  “Is it always like this?”
“You will transport me from my chamber to the Pit’s armory in five minutes.  You will ensure there are no demons there, or in the library, for as long as I stay there.  I will bring you one halo, in return.”
from Dean, and if he didn’t tell Dean now there was an even chance that Sam would tell him (if he was feeling suicidal), or at least confront him with the information gleaned during the test.
3)  I have been working on this fic for a whole year!  I have loved it.  Thank you so much to everyone who has made it with me this far. <3
to long for Dean.  He didn’t know how to want something that he didn’t have.  He didn’t know how to think about living differently than he was living.  In Heaven.  Waiting for orders.  Waiting for the next feint, the inevitable next volley to arise of of Hell and need to be vanquished.
“I'm not sure.  The last time I was human the sensations were so overwhelming.  I never quite learned to separate them all.”
When he arrives in Sam's cell, this fevered beast has hold of him, and he is thinking so hard about turning back and finding Cas again, holding him and breathing in his scent, that he does not even step out of the devil's trap.  He just stares at the stone wall in front of him with black eyes.  His skin is cold.  It's so cold.  He wants Castiel.  He just… He wants Castiel.  In his arms.  Now.  Always.  Why do they ever have to part?
from just this touch, the repetition too much over nerves already stripped and raw, and Cas’ other hand reaches out to his shoulder, to steady him.  Sparks explode from the new grip, like a spinning saw with monster teeth clashing on hot steel.  Dean imagines the sound of that saw, that collision, and he hears it rising in his brain, drowning out the quiet.  Making him crazy, unsteady on his feet, overwhelmed with sensation.
He looks around the garage, checking again for similar that he missed, clues to what is going on here.  But the walls are white and bare, and the concrete floor is marked only with oil stains, and the wobbly devil's trap.  All of the cultists are now either passed out or dead.  The dead are crumpled on top of each other, the pool of blood spreading and blackening beneath them.
Lucifer, and now they are panicking (rightly) that he is going to kill them before they decide what they want to wish for.  That’s what it seems like they think this is:  they sell their souls, and they get a wish.  They
His octopus lowers its tentacle uncertainly, and tilts its head to the side, ready to try to understand again.
Dean nods too.  “That's right, I did.  Fuck those guys.”  He rests his head back, again. “I'd rather have you.”
No use denying it.  Castiel can feel the evidence of how much Dean wants it, grinding up against him, he can see it in the black depths of his dilated eyes.  He can hear it, the air on Dean's breath when he pants “Yes, angel,” and moves against Castiel, moves in rhythm, hands rising and falling on hips that rise and fall, too. “Yes.”
Two:  he took Dean's mouth for his pleasure, fingers fucking his face and trying to make Dean cry out, and he came in his angel’s garment like a wild dog in rut.  He did not cherish, did not worship, did not lay holy hands unto Dean's body as his angel should.
When he did stand, he noticed that his body had not been lying flush with the ground.  Instead, he had been lying in a crater.  A body-shaped crater.  A Dean's body-shaped crater.  He closed his eyes again.
“You stood, reeking, on the dias, in the Pit, Hydra, though you know the throne does not belong to you.  Did you stand there because you wanted to be the first, to offer your service to the Master?  Did you offer him… These ones--” Castiel gestures with disgust at Hydra's followers, “as a sign of your fealty?”
Dean’s eyes open all the way.  His cock hardens again.  His body tenses, out of its laxness.  He sits up, and grabs Castiel’s hair, kisses him like he owns him.
Words pour out of Gary like he cannot control them.  Maybe he cannot.  “You love him, and you should love him, because he is so beautiful, so fiercesome, he is true, and fair, he is everything.  We lo--” Gary stops himself, before completing this word, remembering what it felt like, to speak the word that is forbidden him, to receive all of his pain.  He continues with more careful phrasing. “He is... perfect.  You are perfect, Lord.  Your love is perfect.  It calls to us, through the void, across the veils.  It calls us to gather, it calls us to action.  You are bound to him forever.  We give you our blood to strengthen the binding.  We give and we are joyful.  All for you.”
. Dean, Dean, Dean. After all the fun we had," he drawls, "you and me and Mike and Sammy, did you really forget the most crucial element?"
“Yeah. He said there’s no way he knows of to remove it, but that maybe we can, uh, ‘corrupt its form’ to mess with its power. Kind of like how we can spray paint through warding sigils to break them.”
He crouches down to pick up his blade, then goes to get Cas’s where it’d been thrown across the barn, so he doesn’t see Cas’s expression when Cas says, “You’re not angry because of the bite, so what is it?”
For whatever reason, something in what he said must get through to Dean, because it’s the first smile that reaches even halfway to his eyes. “Now we drink,” he says, pushing himself off the edge of the table, hooking a foot around one of the chairs, and settling in, “and we shoot the shit, and if we’re lucky, we get a good night’s sleep for the first time in our sorry lives.” He takes a long pull of his beer, as if to demonstrate, and when he swallows, he looks at the table for a moment that stretches just a little too long. “And then tomorrow you’re gonna get in one of the dozen cars we have in the garage and drive to Eileen’s house, and you’re gonna get your happy ending.”
, something so old and so unknowable and, ultimately, so far from human that Dean couldn’t begin to wrap his head around it. “Okay, seriously,” he asked, strangely hoarse, once Cas looked like himself once more. “What the hell is going on?”
And what could he possibly say in response to that? The silence reigned for several long moments, the air almost thick with some electric tension. It went on for just a beat too long to warrant a response, so Dean just let his jaw click shut, gripped the wheel until his knuckles turned white, and reached for the radio.
And they end up turning into the parking lot of a somewhat rundown outlet mall. Whatever he’d thought the “stop” would turn out to be, it sure as hell wasn’t that. “Uh, Cas?”
“Like my arm’s gone a couple rounds with a hot iron,” he said, moving to sit up against the headboard.
Before Dean could begin to put his thoughts into words, Cas interrupted. “That’s not good enough.” Going by the tone to his words and the crease forming between his eyebrows, he was losing patience just as rapidly as Dean. “Ramiel, there must be something. I was told that if anyone could help, it would be you.”
been Dean doing everything in his power to save Sam from whatever curveball they’d been thrown that year -- freaky visions, demon blood, Lucifer, his wall, the trials.
Jack, to his credit, doesn’t look disappointed or upset at all. Nor does he look surprised, really. He looks at Cas, then Dean, the expression on his face almost like
The thought of them seeing Jack hurts, but in the best way. Sam hopes that they see past the new-God thing to the kid underneath, to see how
They were quiet for a minute or two, the only noise filling the kitchen the clink of plates and the sounds of the sponge and the water, but there was an expectant edge to it. Sure enough, when he glanced over in Claire’s direction, she had that look on her face again, the one she’d been unsuccessfully smothering since she and Jody had found the Impala in their driveway. “All right,” he said as he passed her another plate, “spill. I know there’s something you’ve been dying to talk about.”
The smile Cas gives him now isn't quite that, a bit more relaxed and less intimate, and Dean is grateful for it. "Good," he says, and then strips out of his coat and reaches for his tie. It's something he's taken to doing more and more often, but Dean's still not used to it, still can't help the way his eyes are drawn to the skin of Cas's neck as it's bared. Cas never notices -- or if he does, he graciously doesn't acknowledge it -- but the way the corner of his smile quirks now makes Dean wonder if he's finally been caught out.
He’d worried that the Jack they knew would be changed, gone somehow, but despite the different way he carries himself, power all but visible in his body, his face is the same as ever, childish and understanding as he says goodbye and disappears in a blink.
Instead, he focuses on Sam, chews him out for being so stupid as to have jumped headfirst into things, to have trusted Rowena,
Cas looked up then, catching and holding Dean’s gaze for a moment before breaking it with a frustrated exhale. “I don’t know,” he said. “I had duties elsewhere and my memories of that time are… unreliable.”
“I’m fine,” Cas said with a shake of his head, though his voice sounded even rawer than usual. “We should get moving.”
The buzz he always got from long drives was already beginning to wear off, and the events of the past twelve hours hit him like a freight truck. He’d been hoping to catch at least a couple hours’ sleep before starting in on this again, but he knew the likelihood of them letting him crash now was slim to none. “Right. Jesus. Okay, let me at least get some caffeine first.”
The gurgle and hiss of the machine seem obscenely loud in the silence that follows. Well, Dean thinks, a bit hysterically, at least that got that damn look off Cas’s face. The only thing there now is genuine surprise, and perhaps a little nervousness. “You’re sorry?” he repeats, the words rolling off his tongue like he’s tasting them.
No question.  “If that's what you wanted, Cas, I would have given you that. Like building.  Like the mountains.” He elbows Cas and smiles again.  “You anglin’ for a ring sweetheart?”
Dean rests his head back against their headboard as Castiel touches him, and sighs.  It feels good, so good, Cas in his lap, narrow hips held under broad, veined, hands, just touching, holding.  It's not the thunderclap that shook them before, it's not the avalanche, the forest fire, racing through him, setting his brain on fire and making his fingers numb.  It's not that, but it feels so good.  So easy.  So
“Ssshhh, Ok Cas, Ok.  I’m not going anywhere.  I’ll get them later.  I promise you that.  Even if it’s all of Heaven, I’ll get them.  For this.”  He swore it to Castiel and he swore it to himself.  There would be war, for this.  He would break down the gates of Heaven and bring fire to the sky, for this.  The clouds would bleed.  Wings would be burned into the earth.  For this.  Because Castiel was burning, and freezing, and there were tears in his crystal eyes.
“I mean like, which one is really you?  The tax accountant, or the holy badass, or the lonely star?”
“Sam, wait, no--” Dean reaches out towards him.  He presses his face up to the bars.  Sam pauses, but doesn’t turn back around.
“If they tried, I ran away.  Fucked off to some cloud, in Heaven.  Though, usually, mine had a bar.  I’m not a barbarian.”  He looks pointedly at Castiel, though Castiel’s wings are still covering his face and he doesn’t see it.  Gabriel chuckles.
“The primary condition of his service to me will be absolute obedience to you and repentance for the harm he did to your body.” Cas doesn't even pause to think about it.
