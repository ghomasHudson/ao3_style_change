“Now you must direct me in any way you see fit, and correct all my mistakes,” I insisted, before bending to my task.
I was overheated with exertion and pleasure, and slowly removed the dildo and set it aside before sitting up in bed and stripping off my nightshirt. Then I eyed the larger dildo, which still lay at my side. It made me think of Watson again, and I longed to feel something I could pretend was a part of him. Taking it up, I greased it, laid myself down, and tried to insert it.
Watson only chuckled at my ire. “I know you’re embarrassed. That is precisely the point. Holmes, I am prepared to give you everything you want. I would make a seven-course meal of you every night, if you’ll permit me. But before I do, you must show me that you can make yourself vulnerable before me. You are a prideful man, and I won’t be satisfied with you giving me only a sliver of yourself because you fear the loss of your precious dignity.”
I have always prided myself on being a quick study, but Watson’s kisses were so disarming, I could do nothing but accept them, opening my mouth and allowing him to do as he wished, languishing on the far side of being able to reciprocate properly. He didn’t seem to mind, focused as he was on handling my body with keen confidence.
When morning came, Sherlock was slowly beginning to wake up before John, grumbling softly in his semi-asleep state. “Mmmm...” He hummed, squirming around a little until he found John's arms, nestling up against him. Sherlock smiled to himself, not really awake, but not really fully asleep either. John let out a deep breath, turning around towards Sherlock. He frowned though when he felt something laying so close, and his eyes slowly opened. He blushed. Had Sherlock moved closer? Well, he definitely had, he could see it of course. And feel it too. John tilted his head, yawning. “Sherlock?” He murmured quietly. Sherlock didn't respond, but what he did was slowly wrapping his arms around John's middle, humming softly. John blushed deeply. Christ. This was... different. Different, yes, very much so. He swallowed a little, biting his lip. “Sherlock, are you awake?” He asked softly once more, not wanting to wake up the taller man, but also wondering if Sherlock was doing this in his awake state. Sherlock stirred a little, squeezing John tighter. “Hmm?” He said and eventually cracked open his eyes. He smiled. “Good morning John-” Sherlock froze, realising he was nestled up like a- like a- like a needy /something/. He shouldn't be doing this. He quickly untangled himself and backed away, smiling shyly. “I... Sorry...” Sherlock muttered. “Not... Not used to having someone sleeping beside me... I guess I... I get a bit... cuddly... I didn't know...” Sherlock rambled, sighing softly to himself. John blushed and smiled back. “Nah, it's alright.” He said and shrugged. “If I moved about in my sleep then I'm sure I would've done the same. It's probably just uhm... natural instinct or something like that. Like... Like cavemen probably did, to keep warm and... stuff.” John murmured and rubbed his neck. “We don't have to get up yet, we can sleep in if you'd like, it's Sunday morning after all.” John said and curled up a bit more. Sherlock nodded, still quite mortified about waking up all snuggled up like that. But John... John didn't seem angry. He didn't seem angry at all. Had something... changed?
“They're here, they're here!” Mrs. Holmes shouted to Mr. Holmes as she rushed to the door. She opened it up, the slightly plump woman beaming as she saw the two boys on the doorstep. “Oh! Hello! You must be John then, it's so nice to meet you!” She beamed and took John's hand, shaking it first before tutting at herself and pulling John into a big hug. John's eyes widened but he quickly hugged Mrs. Holmes back. Sherlock was right. He was surprised indeed. “Mrs.- Mrs. Holmes. Thank you so much for your kindness and for having me over.” John groaned out softly as he was being squeezed by Sherlock's mother. “Mother please...” Sherlock muttered and Mrs. Holmes let go reluctantly. “Oh, sorry, there there.” She said and corrected John's shirt. Soon enough, Mr. Holmes appeared behind his wife, putting a hand on her shoulder. “John Watson.” He said and reached forward, shaking John's hand with a warm smile. John blushed a little and nodded. “Mr. Holmes, nice to meet you.” He said, even bowing a little, not sure what to do. In his eyes, the father was an authority, after how he had been treated at home. Mr. Holmes beamed. “Well come inside then, no use standing out here.” He said and wrapped his arm around John's shoulders to help him inside. John flinched quickly, fear setting in with the close touch. Sherlock noticed it too and bit his lip. Mr. Holmes moved his arm away equally as fast. “Sorry.” He said, and tilted his head, smiling at John. John nodded. “No. It's fine. I'm sorry too.” John said and looked over at Sherlock. Only then he first realised his face must still look quite messed up and that he owed Sherlock's parents an explanation. “I- I don't always look like this. In the face I mean. I'm not one to get into fights. This was not really even because of I fight I was- uhm- I fell down and hit my eye on a branch.” John said, biting his lip a little. God that must've been the worst lie ever. Mr. Holmes nodded. “I see.” He said, keeping his soft smile. “Those pesky branches.” He said knowingly as he began walking towards the living room. John sighed in relief, even though he felt like Mr. Holmes hadn't bought it at all. He removed his shoes and followed Sherlock into the living room.
I lowered my newspaper. “My dear Watson, I fear I cannot reveal to you the contents, on the grounds that I do not know, myself. When the British Museum requested my services in recovering the stolen trunk, they would not tell me what was inside – they promised to pay me whether they found the contents still within or not, but they sternly warned me that the payment would not be rendered if I opened the trunk after recovering it. I’m counting on the fee to finance a season’s worth of operas at Covent Garden, so I dare not investigate further.”
masturbating; I was just playing with my prick a little, whilst I returned to thinking about the event as it had actually occurred, that is, with Watson fully dressed. Perhaps his extended struggle with the burglar would leave him fatigued. Surely he would appreciate having someone to help him undress afterward, just getting out of his confining collar and cuffs, and then perhaps his tie, waistcoat, shirt, and vest, not then and there but in the privacy of our rooms. With that done he would without doubt benefit from having his sore muscles rubbed.
. The way his body trembled atop mine was immensely satisfying, and when at last he calmed and sank into the cradle of my limbs, I felt contentment unlike any I had experienced before. I felt that Watson was mine, and I his, and whilst I had entertained an inkling of this feeling before, I knew now that no one could sever that bond.
Upon reaching the cottage, I was forced to curse that sensibility I so valued in Watson, for once he’d got the door locked behind us, rather than throw me to the floor and ravish me then and there, he asked me to lay the fire in the bedroom whilst he put the remainder of our picnic in the larder. He was wise, though, to assign me this chore, for as soon as he came into the bedroom, approached me, and slipped my coat from my shoulders, I knew I would want the room to be warm, for I would soon be wearing nothing.
“Do it just as you like,” he said. “Don’t put on a show. Do what you would do if I were not here. It will be a lesson for me; I can learn how you prefer it.”
He snorted. “That is an easy one. You recognised the set of spare clothes I keep at the office in case of a mishap.”
I was almost in danger of giving Watson the impression that I was moribund, with how I struggled to hide my glee at the prospect of inciting his passions far from home: steepling my fingers, I sighed and closed my eyes. “Very well. I cannot predict what machinations of the criminal class I might be called upon to investigate between now and then, but we shall depart on the first day after the tenth that I have all my affairs in order here in London.”
Watson broke away from our embrace just long enough to roll to the side of the bed and take something from the nightstand. He showed it to me: a tin of Vaseline he’d found in the bathroom. “This will ease the way,” he said. He nuzzled my neck, and promised, “I will go slowly, and treat you with the utmost care.”
“How?” Despite my apprehension, I felt I could not be more ready to receive his love in the most intimate manner than I was at this moment, and I thought if I could get him to explain, I might lure him into demonstrating.
“Hmm.” I tried again, waiting until he looked at me, then dragging my gaze up his outstretched legs, across his body and over his limbs, and up to meet his eyes.
A very strange thrill had run through me when I watched Watson’s graceful tackle, and the burglar’s futile struggle against his hold. I quashed this feeling immediately out of habit, though with a shiver that told me I would be tempted to dwell on it later. It had electrified me to witness Watson’s physical prowess – and one would think that would be nothing to be ashamed of, being a boxer and fencer myself, and therefore naturally an admirer of any feat of athleticism. That evening, however, after I had performed my nighttime routine and slipped into bed, I lay awake for quite some time, playing the scene over in my head in a way which had little to do with sporting technique.
Within an hour, all had become clear: before the boy had awoken in the morning, his mother had risen to accept the coal delivery, which is when the dog had darted out through the open door. Likely it had given chase to a mouse or rat, following its quarry up the ramp and into the coal wagon. When the ramp was shut, the dog was trapped, and was then carted all over town, unseen by the delivery man due to its colour matching that of his usual cargo. (This was all discovered after our having no luck with the milk cart and the butcher.)
At last, I heard two distinct sets of snores, and determined that the two men had fallen into a contented sleep, and so it was safe to move from behind the screen. It was only then, when I stood up, that I realized how wet and tingly I was between my legs. It was not an entirely new feeling, but so much more intense than I’d ever experienced before. I wished I’d had a place to go where I felt secure in addressing the situation, but I did not. I had to get out of the house as quickly as possible, and leave no indication that I had been there. I silently extricated myself from the narrow space behind the screen, tiptoed past the sleeping men, and crept down the stairs. Holmes had inadvertently taught me a valuable lesson that day, about the importance of being judicious when it came to playing practical jokes.
When he passed over that exquisite spot inside me, my whole body seized with pleasure, and as I arched my back and lifted my hips, I fully seated him inside me. He was still, but my hips were restless, and their churning kept him moving gently inside me.
It was Watson who moved to make the evening a passionate one – and thank God, for I was still little more than a bundle of confused excitements, in need of guidance. When he knelt down in front of my chair, right between my legs, I thought I might faint from an all-day anticipation that was now spiking.
Watson had brought along a couple of Clark Russell novels, which he set on the bedside table, and as I got under the covers, I asked if he would read aloud to me.
It occurred to me then that I still held my cigarette, and was about to drop my ash onto my client’s furniture. I tapped the cigarette over the ashtray, then after considering it a moment, decided to indulge in a deep drag, then a swig of brandy as well. Gorging my senses still further whilst Watson pampered my prick felt fantastically sordid, in a way that nothing ever had before.
Between that discovery and my reaching for the hygiene books on the shelf, I had collected a few other details, owing mainly to a knowledgeable boy who lived on a farm a few miles down the road. He would thrill and repulse and fascinate the other children with tales of things he’d seen, but descriptions of the genitals of various livestock was his most popular material.
I opened my eyes, and my mouth twisted in contemplation. The truth was, I had no idea if it would feel good for me, and cared so little whether it did that I had not given much thought to it. It seemed as though such an act ought to be painful, or at the very least uncomfortable, but then again, men risked the gallows for it, so there must have been something to it. Really, my only desire had been to give every part of myself to Watson, to prove that I was holding back nothing from him. I did not want to say this, so instead, I replied, “Am I not allowed to think only of you and your pleasure?”
Dozens of pages were devoted to the exact physical dimensions of a suitable wife, some specifications of which also depended on the man in question. For example:
I spent abruptly onto my nightshirt after lingering on this thought for some minutes. It happened so suddenly, I was too startled to feel ashamed. I changed into a clean nightshirt and laid back down to ponder what had just happened. It seemed that I might be in danger of developing a habit that, for the first time, it would be best to hide from Watson.
I was sore where he had serviced me, and still a-flutter in my belly when he looked into my eyes. “What a marvel you are,” he remarked. “So delightfully greedy for a nice prick. One would never guess.”
But I think that I wanted to feel small just then; these past days I had come to believe that the whole world had changed, but soon it would be time to return to normal life, and I needed to reorient myself, and to once more think of the world as big and myself as small.
It came to a point where I accepted that this activity was taking up valuable time and energy, and that I must find a way to manage these cravings for Watson so that I might get on with my life unhindered by yearning. If only putting an end to infatuation was as simple as understanding that it was unproductive! But just as I had trained hunger and thirst out of my body, I was resolved to do away with lust.
But this stimulation made me dizzy as the last of my inhibitions dissolved, and I could remain silent no longer. I broke the kiss to beg, “Watson, listen to me.”
Despite this growing understanding that having a libido need not be disastrous, that vice was not only routine, but more often than not downright banal, I continued to avoid sexual matters, due to an utter lack of interest in either the incentives or the inevitable results. Twice or thrice I found myself entertaining soft emotions for another at university, but such fleeting thoughts were as nothing before my iron determination. I crumpled those urges up like a blotted sheet of foolscap, treating them like the mistakes, the
I felt very strange and sort of full, with only just half of it in me. I tried sitting up, to see if that would give me more leverage to push; it did not, so again I laid flat on my back, trying to relax. Then I tilted my pelvis to get a better angle to manipulate the dildo, and my heels lifted off the mattress as well. I pushed the thing in and out, slow and deliberate, feeling every sensation. The texture of it, especially the prominent ridge of the crown, was giving me unfamiliar and delightful stimulation, mostly right at my entrance. I pushed it back and forth for some time, amusing myself, and then when I thought myself brave again, I thrust it decidedly deeper.
I did not need to say anything more. Watson withdrew, then draped himself over me, holding me tightly and kissing me all over my face. “I was too rough with you, I’m sorry.”
There was one that I was more drawn to than any other. It was one of the more recently-crafted specimens, solid, seamless, and smooth, made of Bristol glass, and very realistic. This one that I favoured was slightly bigger than my own was when at a full stand, and it had a subtle upward sweep which mine lacked. After some consideration, I determined that this one must be closest to Watson’s.
At last, he implored: “Holmes, you must tell me what is in that box. I’ve been waiting all day. I assumed that your delay in telling me was owed to your flair for the dramatic, but the hour has long come and gone for a memorable reveal.”
He also did not shy away from performing upon me that same peculiar act he had performed in the bath – he explained it was to help train my body to not shy away from him. So it was not a pleasureless few days, but at the same time, it was a torment, until he finally determined it was time to give me what I fervently craved.
Watson took off his own coat, and I moved to unfasten his shirt cuffs, but he stayed my hands. Instead, he bid me be still and allow him to loosen my tie and slip it from around my throat. He unfastened my collar, then my cuffs, setting everything aside with care. He unbuttoned my waistcoat and did away with it, then unfastened my braces. He unbuttoned my shirt with maddening fastidiousness, pushing it from my shoulders and draping it neatly over the back of a chair. I sat on the bed when he nudged me to do so, and despite my protests that it was entirely unnecessary, he knelt down to remove my shoes and socks. Then went my undershirt, over my raised arms, and finally he had me stand again so that he could unbutton and tug away my trousers and drawers.
I laid my hand over his, as if to steady the box, which was of course completely unnecessary. With my other hand I took up one of the morsels, and looked at him as I popped it into my mouth. He smiled at me.
. I imagined my parents at some long-distant time measuring each other’s necks, and thus determining that their courtship was an appropriate one. It seemed as ridiculous as the idea of their being affectionate with each other.
“Oh, it’s so close, I can feel it.” Holmes squirmed and tugged at himself for a minute or so more until he coaxed out a few thin pulses of milky fluid. While this happened, he seemed to become delirious with the pleasure of it; he lifted his legs straight up in the air, and his toes curled, and he made so much noise that I was embarrassed for him.
Reveling in Watson’s adulation, Holmes tilted his head back and rode him at a leisurely pace, placing his hands over Watson’s, touching and being touched. He had not been lying, though, when he’d warned about the brevity of their coupling this way. He begged for another change, lying on his side while Watson cradled him bodily from behind, and they continued at it.
In the darkness, I let my arm brush my coat noisily as I moved it, so Watson could detect that I was placing my hand between him and myself. He placed his atop mine; it was pleasantly warm, in contrast to the cool night air.
I then forced myself to stop this new line of thinking as well, for it was no more productive than the one about Watson. I stood up and went into my bedroom to begin my evening routine. I changed into my nightshirt and dressing gown, poured some water into the basin on the table...
And it was not as if, once a person chose a suitable partner and entered into the sacrament of marriage, their troubles were over. Consummating a marriage was only the beginning of new complications to fret over.
“I need to take lots of time to prepare you very carefully, don’t I?” Watson said, as his fingers slid leisurely in and out.
Baker Street became a haven for both of us; certainly for myself, and I think for him as well, it felt like our first true home. Bounced about as we both had been by the circumstances of our very different lives, we were happy to fall in together, neither demanding anything from the other that did not come naturally. Sitting around our little hearth, we could relax and be our idiosyncratic selves, caring not for the opinions of society as regarded our temperaments and our ambitions.
an exquisite length of cock. I must have convinced him, for he at last set the tin aside so he could come forward on his knees. His cockstand swayed to and fro, and he caught me watching it raptly. He held it at the root, and said, “You like this?”
As we continued on our way to the grocer’s, Watson remarked. “I must say, that was very kind of you, to take so much time for such a trivial mystery.”
Unable to resist the temptation, I immediately made the silliest face I could come up with, which made him laugh, though he admonished me, “If you’re going to be a menace, you’ll get nothing at all.”
“Perhaps,” he said, and his tone was light. “For one thing, you’ll have to learn to hold your noise.” At this, I laughed with embarrassment through my tears, and he gave me a little squeeze. “But when the criminal element cannot find it in themselves to offer you a real challenge, it will be much more fun for us to do this together, than for you to sulk in a torpor, will it not?”
I thought then of Watson – because I always thought of Watson when confronted with the erotic. Watson was the only person who had ever provoked such feelings in me. He did not know this, of course, for to reveal these sentiments would be to compromise everything – my work, my reputation, our friendship. But in quiet moments, I indulged in them. And this I did now. I held the phalluses in my hand, examined the craftsmanship, and wondered if perhaps this one, or perhaps that one, more closely resembled the noble and virile instrument that my Watson undoubtedly possessed.
One might think that I would be anxious about stepping out and having to be presentable and unassuming about what had happened the night before, but it was quite the opposite. Going out gave me the opportunity to indulge in a different inclination of mine: you see, I have been dreadfully miscast as an ascetic – the truth is, I am a sensualist. I love a hot bath, beautiful music, a good wine. The reason for this mistaken assumption is that despite all of that, nothing feels as good to me as self-discipline; nothing gratifies me like keeping my weaknesses concealed. And at this moment, my weakness was my newly requited and consummated passion for Watson, and the idea of going out in the streets with him, where we would need to act as though nothing untoward had happened in the last half-a-day, gave me an exquisite thrill. The people we passed had not a clue about the truth of me, the truth of what Watson had done to me, and it was indescribably satisfying.
I have no idea what I’m doing, you’re right. And there’s bound to be some hiccups. I was never informed that this would be a one strike and you're out sort of deal, and-”
Hello! I know this is late, and short, and not really all that good. I'm trying to find an exciting direction to take this story in, and I'm really working on it. I want to make it even better, and I'm sure I'll come up with something in the end. I hope everyone has had a nice holiday, and I'm kind of glad it's over lol. Not that it was too bad, but soon, season four of Sherlock is upon us!!! The hype!! And season four, this is chapter fourty, four four, I don't know I thought it was fitting lol. Either way, with everything going on that is so dark in season four, I just wanted to post a quick fluffy chapter to relieve us from the anxiety of the impending new season of Sherlock, and I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling like this. I think my next update with this story will come next year, so if I don't update until then, have a happy new year, and let's get through the first episode of Sherlock season four together! /NightOfFanfics
my meeting with Ella that we would do something together. It’s just an hour Sherlock. You have patience to wait that don’t you? And she really doesn’t deserve to be glared at. You wouldn’t even
Sherlock hummed, looking down at the covers that were draped over him. He placed his hand over the soft fabric, sliding his long fingers over it. It was nice. Warm. Much more comfortable. “Thank you Dr Watson,” Sherlock said to himself with a soft smile, laying back down on his pillow. “Now, loading,” his monotone voice sounded, yet now rung more comfortably and content than before.
John could see how Sherlock adamantly kept looking into the mirror, only glancing at him from time to time. He sighed fondly. “Sherlock, you can look you know? I'm your boyfriend, remember?” John said finally, thinking they should be able to do this by now. He was eighteen years old and Sherlock was soon that age as well. Sure, it was still a bit new and giddy and wonderful, but that's what was making it so special and amazing. Sherlock blushed deeper and nodded, turning to face John instead, still brushing his teeth. “Sorry.” He mumbled around the toothbrush, smiling sheepishly. John shrugged. “It's alright.” He said and went to the sink to spit the foam out, rinsing his mouth and then wiping it on his own arm, not sure what towel he was allowed to use. “What do I do with this then?” He asked, holding up the toothbrush. Sherlock smiled and spit into the sink as well before taking it from John. “You can have it here besides mine.” He said and blushed shyly, putting it in the cup beside his own before going back to rinse his mouth. John smiled and nodded. “Good.” He chuckled and then watched Sherlock gently. “I... I uhm, need to use the loo if that's alright?” John said and pointed awkwardly to it and Sherlock quickly jumped and nodded. “Yes! Yes of course I'll- I'll wait in the bedroom-” He said and rushed out, leaving John in the bathroom to take care of... whatever he needed to take care of.
What John didn't see though, was that Sherlock was positively grinning from ear to ear now, trying to keep his breathing relaxed so that John would think he was already fast asleep. This was what he wanted. This was what he needed. He needed John and he needed his strong arm around him. He needed to feel John's chest slowly rising and falling. Well, it wasn't really that slow right now, and he could certainly hear John's heart beating quickly in his chest. But Sherlock knew it was because of the right thing, even though it would be hard for him to get John to admit it. But he would try his best. Slowly. Slowly he would coax the rugby player to understand what was happening, and maybe with a bit of Harry's help, that wouldn't be too difficult.
I'm sorry this took a little bit longer! I hope it will be a fun read though :) And thank you so so much for over a thousand hits!! I don't know if people think that's a lot, but to me it's huge!! I'm so grateful, so thank you to all of you reading and embarking on this journey with me!!/NightOfFanfics
“H-Hello, Sherlock is it?” A young woman's voice suddenly said. Sherlock frowned and looked to the side. “Perhaps, who's asking?” He said and narrowed his eyes a bit. “Oh- Oh it's Molly, from your class?” She tried and held her book tightly to her chest. “I... I spotted you and- well I didn't think you would even be here and-” She sat down nervously. Sherlock frowned. He hadn't invited her to sit down, whoever she was. “Molly.” He said softly and she nodded quickly. “Y-Yes-” She stuttered, nodding with an awkward smile. “Nope. Don't remember you. Are you sure you're in my class?” Sherlock said, directing his gaze back to the field. Molly looked down and swallowed heavily. “Oh... Yes... Quite sure... We have advanced biology together, we sat at the same table earlier today in class...” She muttered. “Mmm. Fancy that.” Sherlock responded, not really paying attention at all. Molly turned her head to look out onto the field as well, biting her lip. “I... I really hope we win tonight. It's very likely though, with John Watson as captain.” She said and Sherlock's head quickly snapped back to face Molly. “John. What do you know about him?” He said quickly, making Molly flinch. “I- Oh- Uhm- Not a whole lot really. He tends to keep a lot to himself.” She said and shrugged a little and shook her head. “He mostly spends time with Mike, and a few others from the team. He's very kind and caring, but he can be a bit loud as well, depending on the situation.” She said and smiled quirkily. “It's his birthday this weekend. I'm sure he's preparing something for it, only a few days left.” She said and smiled. Sherlock nodded at the information. John was celebrating his birthday soon. Interesting. “Anything else?” He said and Molly blushed. “I... I don't think so? Is there something special you're wondering?” She asked and Sherlock's cheeks went a bit red. He quickly shook his head, looking back onto the field. “No. Nothing. I... I suppose his... Girlfriend must be sitting here somewhere... To cheer him on.” He said, trying to head in the right direction to get the information he truly wanted. Molly chuckled. “Him? Girlfriend? He can't keep a girl for a week!” She said and giggled. “I don't know why, he seems very gentle and caring, but somehow he always ends up dumped.” She said and looked down at her feet, brushing some dust off her shoe. “Or well, he would never admit he had been dumped though.” Molly said, tilting her head a little and rubbing her shoe more vigorously.
Ella watched curiously as John scanned over the file. There was an enclosed, slightly awkward picture, and his past experiences and ‘flaws’ were all recorded for complete transparency. John tilted his head after a moment, scratching the back of his neck.
Sherlock’s eyes slipped closed and he leant his head against John’s chest, taking a deep breath, the sound of various mechanical and digital noises emitting from Sherlock’s body as he settled in John’s arms.
It was to be expected, but Sherlock still wished him complimenting John had gone a bit better than that. Sherlock flopped over to his back, still smiling though from the compliments he had recieved, but he was indeed a little upset that John had just got up and left when he was trying to do the same. But in all fairness, John probably wasn't used to a man complementing him on such thing, other than just banter between him and his friends. Sherlock looked around the room, wondering if John would want him to leave or if he could stay longer. Perhaps the whole day. He began thinking about what they could do, looking around the room for ideas. There was a few board games, one of them being Cluedo. Silly game, stupid rules, but if John wanted to play it, he definitely would. John seemed to also have some sort of video game console tucked on the shelf under his rather old telly. It looked quite old as well, so it was probably none of the new consoles that Sherlock had seen commercials about. He didn't really know much about video games since he had never bothered with searching or remembering information about it, but again, if John wanted to play some video games, he definitely would do it too.
“I don’t think this is a good idea, but, I’ll watch over him okay? But if something happens, you’re responsible yeah?” Mike said sternly with a finger pointed in the air at John who nodded swiftly.
“Ready to go?” John said as he ran up to Sherlock. Sherlock smiled, pocketing his phone which he had been reading on. “Mhm, yes, ready.” He said and stood up, smiling at John. He was very nervous though, not sure how to behave. “Great, let's go.” John said and began walking towards where he knew his team was waiting. Sherlock nodded,  biting his lip as he started following John. “John... I... I'm not sure... how to act.” He said softly and walked up beside him. John frowned. “How to /act/? What do you mean?” He asked, confused, carrying his duffel bag on his shoulder. Sherlock blushed. “Well... I've... I've never been invited to this sort of thing... I'm not quite sure what to do.” Sherlock admitted, even though it sounded so very silly. John looked at Sherlock. He had never been invited out with friends? John felt a bit bad, but at the same time happy that he had asked Sherlock to come with him if that was the case. John chuckled a little. “Relax okay? We are going to the pizzeria, people will be laughing and having fun, we're going to have a bite to eat and then we'll  head home. That's all there is to it okay? You'll be fine. I promise. And if something feels wrong just tell me. You are my guest and I want you to have fun as well.” John promised and Sherlock nodded, feeling a bit reassured.
“Good, I’m glad to hear that… And Sherlock? You know I’m really really sorry right? I hope you can forgive me?” John nearly whispered, his voice as soft as it could be. Sherlock hummed softly before nodding.
John furrowed his brows though when his phone was suddenly buzzing, and he pulled it up quickly and looked at the screen. Molly? “Hang on,” he told Sherlock and answered the phone. John squinted as Molly started to frantically speak on the other side of the phone. “Molly- Molls- Calm- Calm down- It takes more than that for the flat to overflow-” John sighed. “I’ll be right over okay? Just, stay calm and grab a mop yeah?” John muttered before hanging up. He sighed again and pocketed his phone before looking up at Sherlock who was practically glaring at him.
Sherlock sat outside the classroom, waiting for the class to begin. The teacher seemed to be late and there was already quite a buzz going on, all the students hopeful of skipping a class today. John spotted Sherlock on the way to his class and moved to sit down beside him. “Good morning.” He said, Sherlock tilting his head to look at him. “Morning.” Sherlock said with a yawn, his curls messy. John smiled. “Not a morning person are you?” He asked and Sherlock shook his head. “Nope.” He said simply and closed his book. “Are you coming to see the game tonight?” John asked Sherlock, leaning back against the wall. Sherlock frowned. “Game?” He asked, tilting his head. “Yeah, me and my team are up against another school later tonight. It's kind of a big deal.” John said with a proud smirk. Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “Don't care a lot for sports, I thought I made that clear.” Sherlock murmured and looked at John. John nodded, trying to hide his slight disappointment. “Ah, right. Yeah I remember now...” He said and looked up as Mike walked over. “Morning John.” Mike said with a big yawn, stretching his arms out. “Sherlock, is it? I'm Mike.” He said and reached out to shake Sherlock's hand. Sherlock looked at his hand and then up at Mike's face. “Pleasure.” He said but didn't reach to shake it. Mike retracted his hand with a soft smile, sitting down beside John. “So, are you ready for the big game huh? You need to get yourself riled up. We'll never win otherwise. The team needs you.” Mike smiled. Sherlock looked at John curiously. John was needed for this game? It seemed quite important indeed, and John seemed even more important for it to go well. John sighed. “I know... Just... Have a lot on my mind... Last night wasn't too good.” He said, looking at Mike who understood since he knew of John's family issues.
“Look, Sherlock, listen to me alright? She’s a friend of mine, and she’s in a bit of a panic because her bathroom pipe busted open and she needs my help. I’m close by and so is Mike’s office, and I don’t- I don’t want you to be near all that water. I know you said you’re waterproof but-” John sighed as Sherlock seemed to look more and more upset. “Sherlock, why don’t you go visit Mike? You can visit him and his… Android… Friends… Yeah? You said you liked him, and I won’t be gone for long, I know what to do to stop it momentarily and then I’ll come back and get you and we can go have lunch at the café yes?” John tried desperately. Sherlock shifted a bit on his feet. He didn’t want John to go. He was supposed to follow him everywhere especially to new places and it seemed he hadn’t met this friend in a while and… And Sherlock was equally as worried about John but John would never understand that.
It was true that he wasn’t the most android friendly human around. He might have been to a few protests or two at the start when they were first introduced, but he would never
“Sherlock!?” Mike called as he rushed into the room, dropping both his coffee cup and the papers he was holding in a hurry.
It was still hot outside, and he much preferred the winter. Then he could wear his favourite thick coat and his navy scarf, something he felt rather safe in. Like... A shield of sorts. But right now all he could bear to have on was merely his black dress shirt, keeping it as buttoned up as possible of course. He glanced around, waiting for the car, spotting... someone at the bus stop. He squinted his eyes, and then huffed. It was that young man from earlier. What was he playing at anyway? Touching his books, smirking. Sherlock decided that he was probably just playing with him, toying with him like all the other bullies had done. Though, he didn't really look like someone that would bully a person. He was probably an idiot anyway. Who played sports in this heat? Sherlock quickly turned his head when he saw the other man looking his way. He didn't even know his name. He hopped into the car rather quickly, very ready to get home.
John whispered but let out a soft sudden grunt as he hit his foot on- He frowned as he looked at the white box connected to the wall. “What is that…” John muttered as he held his foot, rubbing the top where he had banged it into the box.
Soon all their pizzas arrived to the table and John's were definitely a large one. He smiled up at Peter, thanking him softly. Suddenly, a gasp was heard from Sherlock. “Sorry!” The person sitting across from Sherlock said quickly, a friend of someone from the team. John turned his head quickly, seeing the large glass of coke spilled all over the table and all over Sherlock's shirt. Sherlock was frozen in place, ready for someone to laugh, clap, or point. “Jesus Christ.” John said and glared at the other person quickly. “What happened? Are you an idiot mate?” He said and moved closer to Sherlock. He quickly shook his head. “N-No there were just so- so many things on the table and my plate nudged it and-” He tried apologising. John sighed and caught eyes with Peter who waved at him. “Come, follow me.” John said, somehow managing to get Sherlock to stand up and follow him to the private toilet in the back.
Sherlock gently slipped out of his shirt and trousers, slipping slowly into the pyjamas. His skin was pale, some beauty marks here and there adorning his skin. He had been designed to be quite beautiful, not ordinary or day-to-day looking as some androids were. Maybe Mr Holmes had been a bit old fashioned when designing Sherlock. Androids were supposed to blend in with the general population,
The second his head hit the pillow, he fell into a deep sleep. All the tension was gone after talking to his sister, even though he was still confused about a lot of things. Or, well, perhaps not confused, but he felt like his world has been turned upside down. But even though he felt that way, he felt... calm. Relieved in a way. Perhaps his body responded naturally, and his brain was just too slow to follow. Before he fell asleep though, he glanced over at Sherlock, smiling. Maybe Harry was right. Just maybe.
“Here's your tooth---- brush-” Sherlock breathed as he suddenly came out of the en suite, John flinching and crossing his arms in an attempt to cover his chest. Sherlock were frozen in place, holding the toothbrush, staring at John with wide eyes. John blushed heavily. “I- Uh- Yeah- Thanks-” He said and pulled the toothbrush from Sherlock's hand. “I... ehm... Let's brush our teeth then?” John suggested quickly and rushed past Sherlock and back into the bathroom. Sherlock was still standing in the same place, trying to sort out what he had just seen into his mind castle. John, almost completely naked, wearing the most garish... /sexy/ red boxers he'd ever seen. He let out a soft pant, the mere thought of that making his cheeks heat up. Except... He didn't have to think about it, he could just go back into the bathroom and look at John. His John. Suddenly he spun around and practically rushed back into the en suit, John already brushing his teeth, smiling a little as Sherlock hurried inside. “Forgot something?” He asked with a soft smirk, chuckling a little. Sherlock blushed and shook his head. “No... Just... I have very bad breath.” Sherlock said as an excuse, quickly rushing to the sink to start brushing his teeth as well. John didn't believe that one bit, but he didn't say anything about it.
the same, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft straightened up a bit. “And furthermore, it says that Sherlock should not be left alone for long periods of time, especially with people he isn’t that familiar with. Is this a joking matter to you? I handpicked you Dr. Watson because I believe in your ability to rehabilitate Sherlock just as much as he’s supposed to rehabilitate
So, I'm a bit late again, but I will try to post either Tuesdays or Sundays, just so you have some sort of schedule in mind! I tried to make this chapter a bit longer, hence why I'm a bit late, but I hope you like it a lot :D!
Sherlock closed his eyes as he rested, his breathing becoming more and more even, along with his heartbeat. The touches to his hair helped immensely, and so did John's steady chest rising and falling underneath him. This was perfect really, and even though the way he got here had been very traumatic, he was happy that he was laying in John's arms right now. John was very happy as well. He was happy he had managed to protect Sherlock in the end, that he had scared that Victor guy off and that he had managed to show off a bit in front of Sherlock. He wished he had been there sooner still, but he tried to let that go and focus on what they were doing now. Which, quite frankly, was cuddling. Cuddling in bed. John was cuddling in bed with a man. With Sherlock. John could feel his cheeks getting a dark pink shade as he thought about it, but... it didn't /bother/ him. He was cuddling in bed with another man and it /didn't bother him/. John thought back to his sister's teasing last night, and blushed even deeper. John quickly cleared his throat. “Do- Do you want some cake and tea?” He asked Sherlock, trying to think about something else. Sherlock perked up a bit at that and looked up at John. “Yes, I'd love some cake-... Why are you so red in the face?” Sherlock asked with a frown and John let out a nervous laugh. “Oh, nothing, uhm,” John stuttered, rubbing his neck. Sherlock couldn't help but smile. John was blushing, likely because of him, and it was adorable. Utterly adorable. “Good. Then we shall have cake.” Sherlock said, deciding not to focus on the obvious blushing to make John embarrassed or uncomfortable. Sherlock reluctantly sat up a bit better, fluffing up a pillow beside John so that he could sit up easier and enjoy his cake. John smiled and took the large plate which had two pieces on it. “Now, you keep to your piece and don't steal a bite of mine okay? Otherwise we will have a little domestic.” John teased and grabbed one of the spoons, handing the other to Sherlock. Sherlock corrected his curl behind his ear and giggled a little. “Alright, deal, as long as you don't steal a bite of mine.” He said and grinned back at John, feeling a little better already.
He made no attempt to keep his prick away from my mouth, however, nor did he keep himself from mine. We both found a particular and wicked amusement in sucking each other when one of us was engaged – or pretending to be – in some other pastime: He would sneak between my thighs whilst I was absorbed in the morning paper, or I would ask him to read aloud to me once again from one of his novels, only this time seeing how long he could recite coherently whilst I was devoting myself to applying the most tantalising lingual pressure.
Watson held the envelope by the corners between his fingertips, then sat at the desk and said, “Allow me to attempt once more to employ your methods.”
I was lost in a bliss so intense I ached with it, but then Watson retreated from me, and perched himself on the edge of the bed, at my feet. I once again felt silly, naked and splayed whilst he was still mostly dressed, and I demanded, “Where are you going?”
I ignored my desires and treated his suggestion like an order of the highest urgency. He watched me as I attempted to arrange myself in an artfully sprawled manner – his affectionate expression told me that perhaps I was being a bit awkward. But he kneeled over me, covering my body with his own, and I momentarily forgot about my self-consciousness, gasping in anticipation of being shown every pleasure whilst under his capable hands. I should have guessed that Watson would throw himself into this just as he threw himself into everything we did together, and I was grateful for it; I would never have been confident enough in what we were doing to pursue it with such ferocity as he was now.
It didn't take long until a sleek black car pulled up by the street, Sherlock moving to the door and opening it up for John. The driver quickly stepped out, looking rather well dressed and butler-y. “May I take your bag sir?” He said and John frowned. Sir? He was as far away from a sir as he possibly could be. “Oh, uhm, I suppose.” John said and gave the driver the duffle bag, the man quickly grabbing it and walking over to put it in the trunk. Sherlock nodded to the door he was holding up and John gently got inside. It was, without a doubt, the nicest car he had ever been in, and he looked around himself in awe. Sherlock walked to the other side and got inside as well, instantly putting on his seat belt. “We're going to drop John Watson off first Daniel.” Sherlock said, motioning for John to put his seat belt on too. John nodded and quickly scrambled to get it on. The last car he was in didn't even have functioning seat belts in the back of the car. Daniel nodded and John gave him his adress before looking over at Sherlock with a shy smile. “This... This is nice.” John said and nodded. “I can see why you would prefer a ride home in this rather than the bus...” John murmured shyly and looked out the tinted window, gazing out into the bright lights shining through the London night. While John was busy looking out the window, Sherlock was busy looking at John. The rugby shirt was snug around John's muscles, and it showed him off in the most incredibly way. Sherlock shivered pleasantly, thinking back to how stupid he had been leaning his head onto John's shoulder. At least John hadn't been upset about it or pushed him away or anything. That was a plus. Suddenly John looked back and caught Sherlock looking at him. He smiled. “Are you staring at me?” He said softly with a chuckle. Sherlock quickly shook his head. “No- I- I thought I saw a-... a fly. Or something. Just wanted to make sure it wasn't a bee.” Sherlock said quickly and bit his lip. John frowned, though a smile was still playing on his lips. “I'm sure it was just a fly.” John said, but knew that Sherlock most likely had lied about that. “A bee would've been worse though.” He said with a nod. Sherlock shrugged. “I quite like bees. They are fascinating creatures. And some make honey and I do like honey as well.” Sherlock said and smiled up at John. John chuckled. “I don't think I've ever met a bloke fascinated with bees before.” He said and shook his head fondly. Sherlock blushed and looked down a bit. John reached over and put a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. “But, I'm glad to have met one now.” He said and Sherlock looked up quickly, a smile reappearing on his lips. “Want to hear some fun facts about bees?” Sherlock said eagerly and John nodded. “Go ahead, make me just as fascinated as you are.” John said and smiled.
Mrs. Holmes suddenly burst into the room. “Sherlock did you do- Oh- Oh!” She exclaimed and John's cheeks were impossibly red by now. “Mummy!” Sherlock complained, sitting up and running a hand through his hair. Mrs. Holmes was blushing too, but smiling brightly. “Sorry sweetie, I didn't think- I- I didn't know-” She stuttered and Sherlock grumbled to himself. Mycroft. Mycroft could've bloody told her but no, this was of course much more fun for the older brother. “It's okay mother...” Sherlock said and sighed softly. She smiled and nodded. “Hello John.” She said softly and John quickly smiled up at her. “Hello Mrs. Holmes, it's nice to meet you again.” He said awkwardly and cleared his throat, playing with the covers a bit to distract himself. “Did you two eat something yet?” She asked, concerned of course. Sherlock nodded. “We did mother, we had some left over Chinese food.” Sherlock said and Mrs. Holmes tutted with a smile. “Oh dear, sorry John.” She said and sighed fondly. John smiled and shook his head. “No, no don't be sorry. It's quite alright. Chinese is my favourite food actually, so don't worry about it.” John said and looked up at Mrs. Holmes. She nodded and clasped her hands, far to curious about all of this. “Mother, please?” Sherlock said and nodded to the door. “Oh... Oh! Of course I'll- I'll leave you two boys alone now.” She said quickly and winked at Sherlock, exiting the room and closing the door behind her.
He hurried quickly back to John, trying to make the blush go away. “Great, all done.” Sherlock said, holding the two cups of tea. “Let's bring everything up to your bedroom yeah? And we can get started watching a film.” John suggested and smiled, starting to head up the stairs. Sherlock quickly followed him, trying not to glance too much at John's behind as he walked before him up the stairs. Dammit. Sherlock Holmes. You are not interested in looking at people's bums! It's highly illogical and it's not even that- Sherlock bit his lip. Sexy. Of course it was sexy. When it was John's bum. He was lost in thought and almost tripped on the last step up to his room. He gasped but just about stopped himself from falling, John quickly turning around. “Are you alright?” He asked worriedly, looking down at Sherlock. Sherlock nodded sheepishly. “I am, just fine. Just tripped a little.” He said with a crooked smile. No way he was telling John the truth. Not right now at least.
“”Home, the bus seat made my bum a bit sore, but other than that I'm fine. Hope you're safe and home as well. JW””
those. There were those who reprogrammed androids to their needs, which is not even legal, for starters. Nor was it very moral since androids had evolved much quicker and were more human-like than people had first thought they would be. For better and for worse. Since they were so expensive, they were used in many establishments monitored by the government, such as hospitals, schools, laboratories etc. They were also used as personal assistants, and support for those suffering mentally. John was a clear candidate, and Ella had some pressure from above her, someone anonymous who kept suggesting a specific android that would be a perfect match for Dr Watson’s recovery.
“Repairs? Who do you think you are to suggest such a thing? Repairs? I’m not broken, are you? You seem like you have no emotions whatsoever. Emotionless, sad, nobody needs you in reality. What do you do, serve coffee?” Sherlock huffed, taking a step closer. The android’s face stiffened and his face turned meaner.
“I heard that you agreed to accept the android… How’s that working out?” Ella asked and John put down his cup.
Frankly, I’m starting to doubt my choice in this matter. Greatly,” Mycroft hissed at the end and tapped his umbrella firmly on the cold glassy floors underneath them. John squirmed and sat up a bit better.
The only thing that mattered now was the flustered phone call from Mike. John trying to understand what had happened. John feeling his heart sink when all he could think of was if Sherlock was alright. John grabbing his coat and rushing out in such a speed he forgot his cane at Molly’s on the way out.
“I’m alright, John,” Sherlock said, his tinny voice softer and more like he was used to now. John smiled and nodded, his cheeks flushed all the way down to his neck.
“I… Sorry I’ll only be a moment… Sorry…” John apologised as he took Sherlock’s hand, leading him towards the upstairs bedroom where Sherlock’s loading unit was. He sighed as he closed the door, looking at a grumpy looking Sherlock, crossing his arms. “What’s all this about hmm? I know you don’t need my help to load, and you were glaring at Ella as if she had commited murder. Ella, is helping me, do you understand?” John said firmly and Sherlock lowered his head slightly, squirming shyly.
They headed to the joined tables, John picking out a spot on the far edge so that Sherlock wouldn't be in the middle of things. A member of the team smirked at John. “Oh come on mate! You are the star! Leading us to victory! You need to sit on the honorary seat!” He said, patting a chair in the middle of everything. John looked to Sherlock, seeing him staring shyly down at his feet. John looked back at his team mate. “I'm fine here, cheers.” John said and the other frowned, sitting down at the place he had been patting for John. He looked at John for a while, before resuming to chat with the person next to him. Sherlock was positively blushing at that, but he started to feel more like a burden than John's guest. “Maybe I should go...” He murmured quietly to John, still looking down at the table. John frowned and shook his head. “What? No, no don't go. I mean, of course you can, if that's what you want. I won't keep you here but, I mean, I wanted you to come otherwise I would've never asked you to.” John rambled, rubbing his neck awkwardly. Sherlock's cheeks heated up a bit more. “O-Okay then... I'll stay.” He said softly and looked up at John with a shy little smile. John smiled brightly back. “Good. Good.” He said and handed Sherlock one of the menus. “So what are you having then? Most things here are nice so you can pick anything really and I think you would be satisfied.” John said and eyed the menu himself, even though he knew very well what was on it. Sherlock bit his lip again, looking through the menu briefly before looking at John. “I... I don't really eat...” Sherlock said quietly. God. Here he goes again. Burden. A burden for John. Beautiful John... John that was just trying to be sweet. This was going downhill fast. John chuckled. “You don't really /eat/? What's that supposed to mean-” John said but stopped himself. Maybe... Maybe Sherlock had an eating disorder of sorts, and he definitely shouldn't laugh at that. “You know what.” John said and took Sherlock's menu. “You don't have to eat if you don't want to. It would be nice since everyone else is eating, but I'm not gonna force you.” John promised. “If you want, you can have some of my pizza.” John suggested. “I'm just going to have a regular pepperoni pizza, is that something you like when you do eat?” John asked carefully. Sherlock was flabbergasted. John would allow him not to eat? The thought only was almost unreal. He wouldn't classify himself as having an eating disorder, eating just usually slowed him down and he didn't like that. Sherlock wasn't sure what he liked, he hadn't had a pizza in ages, but what John had suggested sounded good. He nodded. “Yes, yes that sounds good.” He agreed with a soft smile.
“Actually Sherlock, I need to just finish up here with John and then you’ll have him all to yourself alright?” She said with a soft voice and Sherlock nodded, getting up in an instant.
John chuckled a little and began moving with Sherlock to the bed. “Come here. I really am sorry okay? Of course you feel like you can't talk with me when I react this way...” John murmured shyly and sat down on the bed, pulling Sherlock into his arms, much like they had been laying at Mike's after the mishap at the party. Sherlock nodded, his face still buried in John's chest. “I forgive you.” He murmured quietly, gripping John's shirt tightly. John nodded. “Thank you...” He murmured back and wrapped a blanket around them, nuzzling Sherlock's unruly morning curls. “Some morning this was then.” He said and snorted softly. Sherlock smiled a little. “I wouldn't change it for the world.” He promised dearly.
“Curious? Curious about what? A tin can loading…” John trailed off and Sherlock suddenly sat up a bit better and lifted his shirt without a word. “Woah hey- what are you- uhm- Sherlock-” John’s eyes widened and he reached forward, trying to pull Sherlock’s pyjama shirt down. Sherlock frowned.
“Wow...” John gasped to himself, seeing the large living room, a huge lit fireplace and a big chandelier in the ceiling. God he didn't belong here, not one bit. Mrs. Holmes giggled a little. “Come, come sit down.” She encouraged, helping John to the sofa and then plopping Sherlock down beside his new found friend. “Tea?” She asked and John nodded. “Yes, please, thank you.” John said and smiled a little, looking over at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled a little at John, leaning back onto the sofa. This was going splendid so far, in Sherlock's mind. Especially since- “Hello, John Watson.” Another voice said and Sherlock groaned softly, squeezing his eyes shut. There he was. The brother. John quickly looked to the side and smiled, standing up politely. “Yes, hello, you must be Sherlock's brother Mycroft.” John said and shook his hand. Mycroft smiled. “Correct.” He said and then looked at Sherlock. Sherlock gave him a look saying 'if you ruin this I will kill you with my very own hands', and hoped that that would be enough. Mycroft looked back at John and sat down into another arm chair, humming gently as he made himself a cup of tea. “Captain of the rugby team, am I right?” Mycroft said and John swallowed. “Captain of a rugby team hmm? That's quite impressive. My sons have never been much for sports.” Mr. Holmes smiled. John blushed. “Well... Thank you. And I think Sherlock did brilliantly cheering me on at the game last night. Don't think we would've won otherwise.” John smiled. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I doubt my cheering helped you win John.” Sherlock said and John chuckled a little. “It was supposed to be a compliment, not facts.” John said, making Mrs. Holmes giggle a little once again as she handed the cup of tea to John. Sherlock blushed heavily. “Oh...” He said and smiled a little to himself. Mycroft rolled his eyes at his brothers behaviour. Mr. Holmes smiled. “I hear it's your birthday tomorrow John, and that you've invited Sherlock. I trust you will be keeping an eye on him.” Mr. Holmes said softly. “Father. I don't need anyone to keep an eye on me I can handle myself fine.” Sherlock objected. Mr. Holmes smiled. “Of course you can. And happy birthday a day in advance John.” Mr. Holmes said with another warm smile directed at John. John blushed, lowering his head and looking down into his teacup. “Actually... It's not a day in advance.” John said and shrugged. “It's... It's actually today.” John said and glanced back up shyly. Mrs. Holmes frowned. “Today? Oh... Oh! Why on earth did come to visit us then! You should be with your family luv. Oh happy birthday!” Mrs. Holmes said, moving to give John another hug. Sherlock sat, rather dumbfounded and looked at John. But... But Mike hadn't said anything. Neither had Molly. Maybe they had already congratulated him before Sherlock met John today. Mr. Holmes was frowning softly, and Mycroft was looking down at his cup, trying to keep his mouth shut. Once Mrs. Holmes was seated once more, John noticed all the upset and confused faces. “I'm... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything...” John sighed. Sherlock shook his head. “Of course you should've. And I'm glad you did. Happy birthday John.” Sherlock said and placed a hand on John's. John swallowed and glanced up at Sherlock shyly. “Thanks.” He nodded. “You didn't bother going home because no one remembers your birthday there anyway.” Mycroft said when he couldn't keep himself from it any longer, his eyes directed towards John. “Mycroft!” Sherlock hissed, looking at his brother. Mrs. Holmes frowned. “Myc! What on earth are you saying! Don't be rude to our guest! It's not like you at all!” Mrs. Holmes said, slapping Mycroft on the knee. John sighed and squeezed his eyes shut. “It's fine, Mrs. Holmes. Really, it's fine. And well, he's right.” John murmured quietly. Both Mrs. and Mr. Holmes turned to look at John. Neither of them said anything for a short but agonizing moment for John, and he didn't know what to say either. Mrs. Holmes looked at her husband knowingly, and he nodded back. “Right.” Mr. Holmes said and stood up. “If it is your birthday, tea and biscuits won't do. We're going out for a birthday dinner.” Mr. Holmes smiled and smoothed a hand through his hair. Mrs. Holmes beamed and stood up as well. “Right.” She agreed with a nod. Sherlock smiled brightly at John, and even Mycroft did too, but John looked petrified. “What? No. Oh no, no no, you don't have to please I-” John said, standing up so quickly he managed to spill his tea all over himself. Sherlock stood up as well, putting a hand on John's shoulder. “Looks like I might have to lend you your shirt back.” Sherlock said with a soft smile. John groaned. “I can't! Alright? I can't let you take me out anywhere, I don't- I can't afford to go anywhere I don't have the money to-” “Well of course we would pay for you John, you don't have to pay yourself.” Mr. Holmes interrupted. John was panting now, quite worked up and upset. “No! No I can't allow you to pay for me it's not right I'm not worth it I'm-” John stuttered. Sherlock took matter in his own hands, and John's hand too for that matter. “We'll be back down in a little bit.” Sherlock said and began dragging John upstairs to his room.
John rolled over in the bed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock. He groaned a little, pressing close. Sherlock smiled in his sleep, pressing back into John. “Mmmm...” He hummed in his sleep, John smiling as well now, pressing closer. “Sherlock...” He murmured quietly, nuzzling what he realised was Sherlock's neck. John blushed a little, slowly waking up, realising he was actually spooning Sherlock, completely pressed flush against the back of his body. “Sherlock?” He said, this time sounding a bit more awake. Though Sherlock was still fast asleep, smiling to himself. “Mmmm... John.... John.... /More/....” Sherlock breathed, making John's cheeks heat up into a bright red colour. “Uhm, Sherlock?” He said and gently shook the detective. “Hmm? John?” Sherlock frowned, cracking open his eyes. “Oh... You're awake...” Sherlock said with a yawn, stretching a little, blushing when he realised he was spooned by John. John smiled a little. “Yeah, I'm awake.” He said and placed his head back down on the pillow. “Did you sleep well?” John asked and Sherlock couldn't help but smile bigger. “Best sleep I've ever had.” He said and even though he wanted nothing else than to continue being spooned by John, he turned around to face him, smiling lovingly at him. “You?” Sherlock said and placed a hand on John's naked chest, blushing. John nodded. “Yeah, yeah, best sleep I've ever had too...” John agreed, leaning forward gently to press a shy kiss to Sherlock's cheek, minding his bad morning breath. “We should probably get ready for school...” John murmured when he spotted Sherlock's clock on the nightstand, yawning softly. Sherlock pouted. “What if we skipped school... And just snuggled like this all day?” Sherlock suggested happily. John chuckled. “Yeah, I'd love that, don't know if our parents would love that as much.” John smiled and kissed Sherlock's cheek once more, wrapping his arm around Sherlock's waist and pulling him close. “It's a rather short day today. I just have a bit of rugby practice afterwards, and after that, maybe we could go on a date or something?” John suggested carefully.
“Sherlock turned himself off. He decided to do an emergency shutdown. Why he did so, we’re not as certain as his speech is still buffering. So is his ability to walk, as you can see. It takes a while from a sudden shutdown to recover. He might not even remember you right now but the further he gets into his reboot he will,” Mycroft explained as Sherlock got closer to John’s bed. John swallowed heavily. Regret washed over him from all of the decisions he had made that had led up to this point, and he quickly held out his hand for Sherlock to take, if he wanted to.
Sherlock did just that, dropping his clothes on the floor and quickly pulling on the new ones he had received. They were very soft, very comfy, and they smelled like John. Perfect. He smiled and curled up cutely under the covers once more. John glanced back before quickly stripping out of his own clothes,  his bright red boxers shining with the vibrant colour. Sherlock couldn't help but peek, smiling a little at that choice of underwear. Daring. Bold. Interesting. He noted it down before quickly closing his eyes to make sure John didn't know he had been peeking. John turned around when he was fully dressed, finding Sherlock curled up under the covers once more. He wondered for a split second if he should find a way to sleep on the floor, not sure if Sherlock would be okay with sharing a bed. “Are you coming?” Sherlock asked carefully after a little bit, able to deduce what John was pondering about. John nodded quickly. “Yeah, yeah of course. Just, was checking so that I hadn't forgotten anything.” He said quickly as an excuse and moved to the bed, quickly cuddling underneath the covers, closing the telly and looking gently at Sherlock. He looked so peaceful and sleepy, and very calm. It made John's heart warm to witness such a thing. “I can move around quite a bit in my sleep just so you know, in case I bump into you or slap you in the face or something. I shouldn't but- just in case.” John rambled a little and sighed softly with a smile. Sherlock nodded. “Very well. If I get smacked in my face I know it's you.” Sherlock grinned and chuckled. John chuckled as well. “Yup, that's right.” He said and closed his eyes, trying to sleep. Though, he found himself less relaxed than Sherlock was and less sleepy than Sherlock was. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, or what he could do. He liked... He liked being cozy like this in the bed with Sherlock, so that wasn't an issue at all. That thought was curious to him, but he accepted it fully. “Sherlock, I can't sleep.” He said softly, getting straight to the point. Sherlock opened his eyes lazily and smiled. “Poor poor John.” He teased at first with a grin but he knew how hard it could be to have troubles falling asleep. “I'm joking John. Just, try to relax. If you relax, you'll at least get some well deserved rest, even if it's not sleep.” Sherlock encouraged, smiling at John. John nodded. He was a bit selfish really. He should let Sherlock get his rest, regardless of his own struggles. “Thank you, I'll give it a try.” John promised and Sherlock settled once more.
The car was waiting already of course, and John climbed in, nodding to the driver who recognised him now. Sherlock climbed in the back as well, more eager than nervous. He was a bit nervous too of course, but mostly about Mycroft. He would probably become nosey and would try to find out all sorts about John. He looked over at John shyly. No, he wouldn't tell him about his brother, perhaps John would change his mind about coming over then. He wanted to do something to calm John, he could tell how nervous he was. But he couldn't do much, could he? Perhaps a gentle hand on John's on the seat... He let his hand gently graze John's, just to see what would happen. John quickly looked up at Sherlock and blushed, but a little smile appeared on his lips. He quickly looked to the window, and left his hand right where it was, underneath Sherlock's. Sherlock could barely believe that the gentle touch had worked and he blushed deeply and looked outside the other window, keeping his hand in place over John's for the whole ride home.
They all headed out to the biggest car, Mr. Holmes getting in the driver's seat, Mrs. Holmes sitting in the passenger seat, and the two Holmes brothers and John nestled in the back with John in the middle. It was a little awkward, to say the least, but John smiled gently to Sherlock, reassuring him that it was okay. Sherlock smiled back at John, blushing a little. He knew he would have to tell his father about everything he knew about John. About his abusive father, and the neglect of the rest of his family members. Sherlock didn't know too much about that, yet, of course. But the first priority was to tell his father about John's. John hummed a little to himself, oblivious about what Sherlock was thinking about right now. “So... John. Eighteen. Big birthday party tomorrow with friends. Sherlock's invited as well to my knowledge.” Mycroft began softly. John smiled up at him and nodded. “Mhm, my mate Mike is fixing the party at his place.” John explained and Mycroft nodded. “I would suppose there will be... drinks... women...” “Mycroft!” Sherlock hissed. John blushed. “Sherlock, it's okay. And yes, there will be both. But I assure you Sherlock will not have to drink a thing, I will keep an eye on him the entire party, and I won't get hammered.” John promised dearly, Mr. Holmes smiling to himself, glad to hear that. Mycroft nodded, sighing at his brother. “Alright. I suppose that will do.” He said and looked out the window. “But if something were to happen to my little brother-” “Mycroft! I don't need a babysitter!” Sherlock complained and Mycroft rolled his eyes. John couldn't help but smile and chuckle a little. He wished Harry was that protective of him, and he envied the brothers' relationship, even though he knew that Sherlock would do anything to shut Mycroft up for good. “Sherlock, it's okay. He's just protective of you. That's fine. And Mycroft, I will try my very best. Sherlock is still his own person and he should be able to enjoy the party in whatever way he likes, but I will constantly keep an eye on him to make sure he's alright. Will that be enough?” John said and Mycroft nodded after a moment of thought. “Yes. That will be enough.” He decided with a nod.
I'm sorry this is a little late, and I might be taking a trip these coming days, so I might be a bit slow as well! Don't worry though, I haven't abandoned this :)/NightOfFanfics
“P-Person? N-Not a… Tin can anymore?” Sherlock’s voice trembled and stuttered slightly. John felt his cheeks heating up again and he rubbed his neck shyly before meeting Sherlock’s eyes once more.
“I know. And I forgive you, John,” Sherlock said before closing his eyes, soft breaths leaving him, a slight metallic cracking noise coming from his body. John wondered if Sherlock was truly hurt, but he was relieved as well at being forgiven. If something had been wrong with Sherlock’s body, he was certain that that Mycroft bloke had taken care of it.
Sherlock cleared his throat and pressed out a smile. “She’s welcome, then,” Sherlock said before looking down into his tea, taking a big sip. It was sweet, he could tell, John had made it just how he liked it.
watching you both. This is just as much about Sherlock, as it is about you. It is what you signed up for… Had you read everything…” Mycroft muttered before turning to leave the room.
“Here, have some crisps.” John said and put a bowl down, sitting down beside Sherlock for a moment. “I think we're done with most of the preparations now. We're ready for the guests. God knows how many Mike has invited. I don't even know half of them.” John sighed and looked tiredly at Molly. Molly giggled. “Well, you might know more of them by the end of the evening.” She said smartly and then smiled at Sherlock. “I just remembered, I had something to ask Mike. Excuse me.” She said and gave Sherlock a smile and a wink and hurried off to Mike, leaving the two on the sofa alone. John smiled and took a crisp, popping it in his mouth. He looked at Sherlock, feeling some awkward tension in the air that he wasn't sure how to cope with. “Uhm... You look good. I mean, the shirt looks good. On you. The shirt. Nice and... purple. Dark purple.” John stuttered out awkwardly, rubbing his neck, quickly putting another crisp in his mouth to shut himself up. Sherlock blushed deeply and squirmed a bit on the sofa. “Thank you... You look good too, with the shirt on you, of course.” He said and tried not to grin from the way John had stumbled on his words. John smiled. “Thanks.” He said and licked his lips. “So uhm... Maybe I should open the gift before more people arrive and everything becomes a bit more... loud.” John suggested and Sherlock nodded. “Oh- Okay.” Sherlock stuttered, slightly mortified by the prospect of John opening his gift. What if he hated it? Thought it was silly? Sherlock felt a knot form in his stomach but he kept his smile on as John headed to get the gift from the bedroom.
“William! William!” Mrs. Holmes called out to her husband as she rushed downstairs to the kitchen where Mr. Holmes were sorting out all the groceries. Mr. Holmes frowned. “Is something wrong?” He asked quickly, concerned. Mrs. Holmes beamed and shook her head. “No- No-” She said, trying to catch her breath. “No, nothing's wrong. It's just, our boy, our little boy-” She stuttered and gasped, clasping her hands together. Mr. Holmes frowned deeper. “Sweetheart, what's going on?” He said calmly, taking her hands. She let out a soft noise of joy. “It's Sherlock, and John, /in bed/, cuddling!” She said and made another happy noise, taking Mr. Holmes's hands and holding them tightly. William's frown turned into a big smile and he nodded his head. “Mmm, wonderful.” He said and gave her a loving hug. Mrs. Holmes sniffed a bit. “I- I know I shouldn't be like this and- but it's Sherlock's first boyfriend and- and it's so special and I didn't think he would let someone in like that and-” She started rambling and William wrapped his arms around her tighter. “Shh, shh it's okay, calm down dearest. I know, you've been worried about this before, but now you see, there's nothing to worry about, just like I told you.” He said softly and stroke her hair. Mycroft walked into the kitchen, looking for a snack when he saw his mother in tears. “What's wrong mummy?” He asked worriedly and his father shook his head. “Everything is fine, your mother has just happily discovered that John and Sherlock might very well be in a relationship together.” William beamed. Mycroft made an 'ugh'-noise and rolled his eyes. “Oh, /that/. Yes, very well, and yes, they are in a relationship, for your information.” He said and grabbed a bag of crisps. “Myc!” Mrs. Holmes scolded. “How long have you known this for?!” She exclaimed and Mycroft blushed. “Only a few hours mummy, promise.” The older brother reassured her. Mrs. Holmes calmed down a little and nodded. “Good, good... Because I need to know these things alright? Is that understood?” She said and Mycroft nodded before quickly leaving the kitchen, no use in staying when his mother was this emotional.
I'm sorry this has taken longer than usual! I'm starting to work again but I will continue writing, but sometimes it might take another day or two than my usual posting times! I hope you understand and that you are all enjoying this as much as I do :)! /NightOfFanfics
John skipped down the stairs, his steps light and airy as he headed down to the kitchen to heat up their cups of tea. Mrs. Holmes smiled at him and tilted her head. “Oh, did the tea get cold?” She asked, trying not to have a curious tone in her voice. John nodded and blushed. “Yeah- Yeah it did. The cake was so great that... That we forgot to drink the tea with it.” John said and did a nervous laugh to try to be convincing. But he also rubbed his neck sheepishly, which usually gave him away when he was lying. Mrs. Holmes nodded. “I see, well, that's a very easy thing to do. The cake was quite delicious after all. But me and William are still feeling a bit peckish, and I think Mycroft is too. Would you and Sherlock like something more to eat? Oh and John, are you staying the night?” She asked, trying to throw it in casually to not make a big deal about it in case John was shy about it, which she could bet he was. John froze and looked at Mrs. Holmes. “Oh, uh, I'd, yeah, I'd love to stay for the night... If I'm allowed.” He said and nodded quickly. Mrs. Holmes smiled. “Of course you're allowed. Do you need some help to tell your parents you won't be home until tomorrow?” She asked and John squirmed a bit. Right. His parents. He sighed. “I'll... I'll just tell them I'm staying at Mike's... Sorry...” He mumbled. “It's not- It's not Sherlock's fault it's just... When my father found out I was hanging out with Sherlock he... He didn't want me to see him anymore.” John explained. “And well... You saw the aftermath of our conversation too...” He said and stroke his face a little, even though his wounds had healed. Mrs. Holmes bit her lip a little and nodded. “Alright dear... This once, you can tell this lie, but I think we should all meet one evening and talk everything out. It would be so much easier if we just all got along, wouldn't it?” She said and smiled kindly. John nodded. “Yeah... Yeah it would. I want nothing else. But just... Not tonight. I want... I want to stay without something bad happening.” John admitted and swallowed hard. Mrs. Holmes got up from her seat with a smile and walked over to John, cupping his cheek kindly. “Nothing bad will happen. Both me and my husband will make sure of that, alright?” She said and John felt tears starting to bubble in his eyes. He nodded meekly. “Alright.” He agreed and sniffed a little. Mrs. Holmes sighed. “Oh come here-” She sighed fondly and took John into his arms, holding him gently. “You're such a strong and wonderful man, but you need protecting sometimes too, and there's nothing wrong with that. And we are all here for you now, always.” She hummed thoughtfully and smiled, John letting out a soft little sob. “Thank- Thank you-” He stuttered. “John?” Sherlock said as he suddenly reached the kitchen. “What- What's wrong-” He said and rushed to him, practically pushing his mother away to take John in his own arms instead. “John?” He said, his voice almost like a whimper. John nodded. “I'm fine Sherlock, promise.” John said and sniffled. Mrs. Holmes nodded, stroking her sons curls a little. “He's fine love, we just had a little moment, but it's all fine. It's happy tears.” She explained and John nodded agreeingly. Sherlock sighed softly and held John tighter. “Okay... If you promise...” He said and John nodded. “Promise.” He whispered and pressed a shy kiss to Sherlock's cheek. “I'm staying the night, your mother said I could.” John murmured and Sherlock smiled at his mother. “Brilliant.” Sherlock grinned and kissed the top of John's head. “And I also asked if you two wanted a snack. We were feeling a bit hungry.” Mrs. Holmes added and Sherlock nodded. “I'd love some, John?” He asked and John nodded too. “Yeah, yeah I'd like some too.” John said and pulled back to smile at Mrs. Holmes kindly and to rub his eyes. Mrs. Holmes beamed, unused to her son keeping up with them and actually eating. “Then we'll make some snacks for all of us!” She cooed and clasped her hands happily.
In short, with Watson I enjoyed, for the first time, the inexpressible joy of feeling secure with the company we kept. And despite my failure to bestow the gratitude he deserved for his friendship, I am confident that Watson enjoyed this confederacy as much as I, needing that same security but also relishing in particular those moments when my investigations attained some of the excitement of battle. Though he did not like sudden loud noises, and suffered from the occasional night terror, whenever I suggested that he should bring along his old service revolver on an errand, his eyes would light up, and many was the time he drew close to me when my well-being was threatened, even going so far as to stand between me and a brandished weapon. This shows that Watson too had his vice, an addiction with which he had a conflicted relationship, just as I had my own.
I approached the kitchen entrance to the cottage, and through the door, I could hear two male voices. I paused, then decided I would not let myself in, not there. Instead, I would play a little game, seeing if I could enter through the French doors into the main room, sneak upstairs, and then give them both a surprise by announcing my presence as I bounded down the stairs. I wondered if I could even convince Holmes that I’d come in through the upstairs window – a feat I don’t think I could have actually managed, as there was nothing under the upstairs windows to climb up on; a ladder at least would be in order, though a grappling hook would be more exciting.
Funnily enough, his soft reassurance made me randy as be damned, and wishing he would instead use all his strength to take me swiftly and roughly. I grasped his shoulder and pulled him halfway onto me, and soon found that convincing him to show me what he intended to do to me would not require as much patience or persistence as I’d initially assumed. He put first one knee, then the other between my legs, compelling me to spread them. Again, I felt so vulnerable, but I trusted him completely.
But I didn’t want to stop entirely. I was full of coiled energy and now that he was not in me I felt empty inside once again. I didn’t know how to articulate my desires, but my helpless groans and whimpers seemed to give Watson an idea. “How about if you ride a Saint George upon me,” he suggested, “and then you can set the pace.”
, I have touched myself enough for a lifetime in the last several months. I have sinned most grievously and am certainly going to Damnation, and I will take you with me this minute if you don’t come back here and have me. To begin with, I’m very embarrassed that I am naked whilst you are not.”
I will hold forever the memory of his sharp, helpless cry as he spent inside me, but the moment I heard it, I also knew that I would not be satisfied with that memory, but would soon demand to hear the sound again and again, like the melody of Mendelssohn's
It was only when I moaned softly, my first unambiguous noise of contentment, that he moved his finger inside me, in a particular way that delivered a bizarre, indescribable, but undeniable sensation of sharp pleasure deep inside. Each successive brush against it sent thrills through every fibre of my being, and I began to pant and groan in a most undignified manner. Luscious bolts of pleasure were shooting straight down my limbs, and that was in addition to the unearthly pulsing in the centre of me, as though my prick were being stroked from the inside.
My parents bestowed enough affection for me to thrive, as evidenced by my being here to write these words, but not much more. I believe they raised me and my brother to be, from the youngest age possible, as self-sufficient as anyone from our class of society could be, to not need anything from anyone else (especially from them), to find everything we needed to lead full and productive lives inside ourselves. They aimed to make us into autodidacts who could fill in the gaps in our worldliness for ourselves when our tutors’ duties were over. Although Mycroft and I fulfilled this wish, each in our own way, neither of us turned out how I suspect our parents envisioned, which is why we do not speak of them, and why I suspect they paid us the same courtesy in the years between our leaving home and their leaving this world.
“We're ready to go.” Sherlock declared with a smile as he walked into the hallway with John, the other Holmes' already dressed and ready. John blushed a little and began putting his jacket and his shoes on. “Wonderful.” Mr. Holmes said and nodded. “And please John, don't you worry about a thing alright? I can promise you that your family will be oblivious to our outing and that everything will go well.” Mr. Holmes promised and John nodded, smiling softly. “Thank you Mr. Holmes... You have no idea how much this means to me...” John murmured and sighed contently.
Sherlock rushed inside of the Holmes' residence, darting upstairs quickly. Mycroft frowned from the sofa in the living room, standing up and following Sherlock slowly. Sherlock quickly entered his room, going to his wardrobe and started picking out clothes. Too big. Too small. Not the right colour. Why did this matter so much? He almost ripped off the shirt he was having on now, still trying to find the right new clean shirt to put on. “What are you doing little brother?” Mycroft said with a raised eyebrow, entering the bedroom. Sherlock huffed. “It's none of your business, /big brother/.” Sherlock hissed back and finally settled on a perfectly sized dark purple shirt, pulling it on over his head. Mycroft hummed in thought as he watched his brother frantically look for a pair of trousers. “Heading somewhere?” He said, picking up a discarded shirt from the floor, holding it up against himself. Ugh, how was his brother so thin? Mycroft sighed softly. “Still, none of your business Myc.” Sherlock huffed, buttoning the shirt. Mycroft sighed. “You're going to the school rugby game aren't you?” He said softly. Sherlock froze a little but quickly continued his buttoning. “So what if I am?” Sherlock said, blushing a bit.
“Sod it,” John gruffed and got out of bed, hurrying up the stairs and knocking on the door. “Sherlock? Are you… Alright? Asleep? Uh, loading?” John asked through the door. No reply. John tilted his head. “I can’t believe this…” He sighed and gently opened the door just a little to start off with. He frowned. Sherlock had changed clothes, he noticed. Why… Was he laying on top of the covers instead of under it? John tiptoed inside, glancing around the bed. “
Sherlock couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day. He was worried, upset, and constantly aware of where John was. He didn't want to bump into him, knowing that would probably end very badly indeed. He was debating if he should go to the game or not. Maybe if he went, John would see that he did care about him. But if he went and John saw him and got upset, maybe he would be blamed if they lost. He closed his eyes, trying to think of what the better option was. Somewhere in his mind though, he was wondering why he cared so much. He usually didn't care what other people thought about him, as long as they didn't hurt him or bully him of course. But John was... different. He had never been annoyed or hostile towards him, well, until now that is, and no one had even bothered to talk with him yet from his own class. But John had, for some odd reason. After some thought, he decided to go to the game. He needed to apologise to John, and he needed to set things right. If he had a chance of having a friend, a person that he actually found bearable to be around, then he would take that chance and hope for the best.
Mrs. Holmes quickly prepared some sandwiches and more tea, placing everything out on the living room table neatly. “Can I help with something?” John asked, feeling like he wasn't much use. Mrs. Holmes smiled and cupped his cheek. “No luv, it's quite alright, I've got it.” She said and continued to get everything together. Mycroft came downstairs, yawning and stretching, raising a curious eyebrow when he realised John was still there. “You're still here, Watson?” He said and tilted his head. John cleared his throat and blushed. “Y-Yeah, yeah I'm still here. I'm... staying the night. Mrs. Holmes said I could.” He said and looked up at Mycroft. Mycroft smirked. “Mhm, interesting.” He said and sat down in one of the comfy armchairs. “So... staying the night, Watson.” He hummed and crossed his arms over his chest. “What will you tell your parents then?” He asked as John took a seat in the sofa to wait for Sherlock who had slipped away to get into something more comfortable. John had tried not to blush at that, because for Sherlock it probably didn't mean the same as what it did for John. “I will tell them I'm at Mike's for the night. They won't bother checking up on me, they rarely do. And if they do Mike knows and his parents does too so they will cover up for me.” John said, looking at Mycroft with a firm gaze. Mycroft kept smirking. “Oh I see. Quite clever.” He said and nodded. “So, I assume you will be sleeping in the same bed-” “Mycroft!” Sherlock scolded as he came into the living room, tying his robe tightly around his waist. “It's none of your business!” Sherlock huffed and sat down quickly beside John, giving him a smile before glaring back at his brother. Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Forgive me for trying to protect my little brother, so innocent and so... oblivious.” He said and snorted. Sherlock blushed. “I'm not either of those! I- I- John! Tell him!” He said, looking at John. John blushed and his eyes widened. “I, uh,” He began but quickly sat up straight and took Sherlock's hand, holding it in his own. “He is not innocent, and even if he was, I find that a good trait, something endearing, so it really doesn't matter. So jokes on you. And he's not oblivious, he's the best kiss I've ever had!” John argued and then paled. “I- Sorry-” He said and looked at Sherlock, the pale face soon red from his blush. Sherlock's jaw had dropped, and so had Mycroft's and the older brother was showing signs of a blush as well. “Well then.” He said and cleared his throat, quickly smiling as their parents entered the room.
“Do you like being alone, sir?” Sherlock asked with a tilt of his head. John tilted his head back at Sherlock.
“Look, I know you’re excited, but I’m worried about you getting hurt. If you slow down a little, we’ll be able to go out more times after this, and you’ll have time to see everything. Just keep to my side right now okay?” John explained and Sherlock nodded, staying close and wrapping his arm tightly around John’s.
much better really…” John hummed to himself quietly before taking his jacket, throwing it on, rolling and stuffing the file carelessly in his inside pocket before he headed out the door.
Things got a bit quiet. John held Sherlock to his chest and Sherlock was slowly working on calming down, his sobbing slowly fading into deep breaths. Even though they hadn't said anything to each other, it wasn't an uncomfortable silence. It was just a silence that they both needed. John looked down at Sherlock, carefully reaching up to start stroking his curls. He had said it now. Their relationship. Relationship. What would everyone think at school? His rugby team? Mike? Molly? John shook his head with a sigh, trying not to think about that. All of that shouldn't matter anyway, what matters was that he wanted this with Sherlock, screw what everyone else thought. But... But what if he would be refused to be captain of the team by his other team mates, or worse, the trainer himself? Or maybe he would even get kicked out of the rugby team altogether? No. No they couldn't do that, could they? John bit his lip a little, looking up at his rugby posters.
strikes then. Two. You usually get three. I don’t- I don’t understand what is happening right now and I just want to know if Sherlock is okay,” John said firmly and Mycroft raised his eyebrow. The doctor seemed quite adamant, he would give him that at least.
“”How did you know? You barely know me. You've just called me a ball chasing baboon and then minded your own business. JW”” John sent back with a soft smirk.
Sherlock could feel tears starting to prickle in his eyes. He was just so stupid, so weak, so... unlovable. Harry slowly walked back to the living room, listening in to the conversation of course. She sighed and sat down beside Sherlock on the sofa. “Hey... He'll be okay, don't worry about it Sherlock.” She encouraged with a soft smiled. Sherlock sniffled, starting to rub at his eyes. “I just- I just- I just didn't want to say something wrong and yet I made it all wrong and I'm- I'm so sad-” Sherlock stuttered and sniffled. Harry sighed. “My brother can be such an idiot sometimes.” She said, getting quite frustrated. “Nope, this is not how it's going to end.” She said and stood up, taking  Sherlock's hand as he sniffled. “N- No- No I'm crying John can't see me crying he-” Sherlock tried but Harry didn't listen, instead she started pulling him upstairs and storming into John's bedroom. John quickly looked up from his hands. “Hey you can't just-” “Oh I can.” Harry interrupted. “Look at him! He's bawling his eyes out about you! Why are you so bloody thick little brother? You want to talk? No, you need to listen. You fancy Sherlock. Sherlock fancies you. You don't have to label yourself gay or whatever in case that makes you nervous right now, but this-” She pointed to Sherlock. “-this is not okay. You are messing with his feelings and not taking into consideration what he thinks is difficult. You need to think about Sherlock's feelings more, even though you're confused as all hell.” Harry snapped. Sherlock was shaking, not at all sure how this would end and not liking the raised and angry voice of John's sister. John looked up at the two, his throat thick as he tried to swallow. “I- I'm sorry I-” “'I'm sorry' is not enough John.” Harry interrupted him once again. “It's not rocket science John. I know it's different, and I know it's new. And eventually, maybe Sherlock will be able to talk, but he will only be able to talk if you show him you're not going to just explode at every single little misstep.” She sighed deeply. John nodded. Harry was right. God... He hated when Harry was right. “I... I understand. And you're right... I'm sorry Sherlock, even though that's not enough, but I promise I'll try to not explode like that...” John mumbled and stood up, moving to Sherlock and pulling him into a big warm hug. Sherlock sobbed, leaning into the embrace with his whole body, sobbing some more. “It's- It's okay- Sorry- Sorry that I can't talk or- or give you the- the answers you need-” Sherlock sobbed and stuttered. John sighed and looked up at his sister. “I can wait with the talking until you feel more comfortable talking with me about... about our relationship, and I don't need all the answers right now. That would probably take the fun out of it, wouldn't it?” John said, trying to joke a little to lighten the mood. Sherlock was blushing. /Their relationship/. He felt his heart skip a beat, suddenly so incredibly happy in the middle of his sadness. He nodded. “It would take the fun out of it-” Sherlock sniffled and nodded, burying his face in John's chest. John sighed fondly. “Thanks Harry...” John murmured but was very sincere. Harry nodded, ruffling John's hair. “You're welcome. Maybe I'm the brilliant one.” She said and winked with a smile, leaving the bedroom.
John woke from his phone buzzing, and he quickly answered it so it wouldn’t wake up Sherlock who was now even more closely nestled to his body.
.” Having Watson do it was so much better, because each stroke was slightly unexpected but still precise and perfect.
I wished to nuzzle him, to bury my face in his scent, but I had not shaved since that morning, and so to avoid abrasion, restricted myself to lightly nosing and tonguing at him whilst I explored. At last, the head of his prick, red as claret, slipped between my lips, and I lashed it with my tongue, back and forth, over the fraenulum and across the slit, tasting the brackish fluid that had collected there.
“You’ve got a...” he half-explained, pointing first at me and then at his own upper lip. He continued to giggle as he tugged his handkerchief from his pocket and attempted to wipe away the pale, thin imitation of a moustache which marred my visage. “Oh, dear,” he said as he did so, but bent down and kissed me all the same when I was tidy again.
Watson planted little kisses along my bicep and shoulder, inquiring in the spaces in between, “And what happens if the British Museum finds out? And doesn’t give you the money for your Covent Garden tickets?”
At first, Holmes moved more than Watson did, pushing himself back and forth on Watson’s great instrument, crying, “Yes, oh, at last, yes.” Soon, however, Watson latched onto his rhythm, and began to rock and thrust in perfect synchronization, and once he was doing this with some force and speed, Holmes lowered himself so his head was resting on his arms, and simply basked in it, grunting and humming with the enjoyment of being very thoroughly plowed. Watson was mostly quiet, but occasionally his jaw would fall open as he delivered three or five particularly forceful thrusts in a row.
No talent or skill was needed to observe this. Nonetheless my pulse was quickening with being under his scrutiny. “I like to draw it out,” I explained. “I like to think about you and I don’t like to stop.”
Keeping busy was my best respite from prurient thoughts, so I buried myself in work. I took on cases I found less than interesting, just to have something to occupy me. And when nothing was on, my meticulousness in the maintenance of my commonplace books increased dramatically. With this strict regimen, I laboured to keep my impertinent body under control, until such time as my affection for Watson settled into an unremarkable habit, a feeling I could acknowledge and then simply ignore, as I did with fatigue or cold.
That’s when I felt the most astonishingly intense pleasure. It was like a sudden spark had ignited at the center of me, sending arrows of fire down my thighs and deep into my prick. I repeated my thrust, and it happened again. I rotated and manipulated the dildo, searching for the best way to give myself that sensation over and over. All the while, I gritted my teeth and twisted this way and that, fighting the urge to cry out.
Watson lifted himself just enough to say, “I’ll do nothing of the kind, until I feel I’m invited.” He then returned to both his tasks, sucking me and working his fingertip around my entrance.
With his other hand, he lightly hefted his bollocks. “What about these? Do you want me to put my prick in you so deep that you feel these bouncing against your arse?”
I picked up the handkerchief he had discarded and burdened it once more with a copious mess. Watson took it from me and cast it aside, then got himself and myself arranged beneath the blankets, where he invited me to be enfolded in his arms. Holding me, he breathed across my ear, “I hope this was not too odd or unceremonious an initiation into the ways of love.”
“Good night,” I said, and shook my newspaper in such a way as to make it seem that I was going back to reading it, though in actuality I was watching Watson clap his book shut, rise from his chair, and make his way to the door. Sometimes at this time of night, I liked to imagine Watson sauntering towards my bedroom instead, turning back once to give me a profligate glance, inviting me to follow him. Or I pictured myself accompanying him up to his room. Of course, I would never dare take the slightest action toward making such a thing a reality. Watson was a soldier, and if that were not enough, middle-class; there was no doubt that he found such inclinations as mine to be dishonourable.
I ended the ruse by leaping from my chair and greeting her like an old friend, by her stage name. From there the whole thing unraveled without delay; the actress admitted that she had been hired by the son of the woman she was impersonating, to appeal to Miss Hayes’ sentimental nature in order that she might see fit to share her recent inheritance with her cousin.
“I promise to do so,” I breathed, trying to appear calm despite how hard I was clutching the arm of the chair, “if my own eagerness permits me to stay your hand.”
“Not a one. I saved everything for you, which is why I’m as pent up as I am, and ready to give you what-for.”
I looked away as my face heated up. What Watson had just been doing to me was not nearly so embarrassing as how effortlessly he had dismantled my mistaken assumptions. “Thank you,” I whispered, “I appreciate your teaching me.”
I thought of how, with this facsimile of Watson, I could experience something I’d desired but had never thought possible: I could learn what it felt like to have one inside me. I had long wondered how it felt, and saw now that I had an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity.
Watson applied the Vaseline to himself, unhurried, drawing it out because he knew I was watching in torment. At last he got his thighs underneath mine, snaking one arm under my knee to lift it higher and using the other to aim himself.
“God, yes,” I panted, and lifted my legs to give him a better view of where I wanted him to be. The cool air touched my slickened entrance. “Please give it to me now.”
Taking his time, he freed the last button, then shifted aside his drawers, and his cockstand tumbled into view. It was thick and flushed and beautiful, and I kept my eyes open to admire it even as I was provoked to a crisis. I spent onto my belly whilst uttering the most embarrassing groans. I saw Watson’s prick twitch and jerk while I was spending; he liked what he was seeing as well.
“It’s perfectly alright,” he said, and laid his hand over mine, just the briefest gesture of tenderness to show that there truly were no hard feelings. Nonetheless, I nearly jumped from my skin to feel the warmth of it, and silently cursed the loss the moment he took it away again. “He’s not the first to labour under that delusion. Anyway, he has included all the pertinent details here, and says we may arrive any day after the tenth. He will be returning at the end of the month.”
I continued to extend my tongue as I took him deeper, beginning to struggle when my lips were halfway down his shaft. I did not think to use my hand to make up the difference; I simply fought my way down until I gagged.
Not too long after this atrocious attempt at wooing, Watson was helping me carry some newspapers and documents to my little archive in the lumber-room, and after returning to the sitting room he noticed an opened envelope teetering at the corner of my desk. He asked if it belonged with the other old papers.
By the time they stumbled into the bedroom, both men were partially undressed, jackets and waistcoats nowhere to be seen, braces loose at their sides, ties discarded and collars askew. No wonder they had taken so long to ascend the stairs; still they were fumbling at each other, unbuttoning each other’s shirts in a most inefficient way.
But then he did something that seemed incongruous, considering his reaction to my proposal. He gave me some polite direction:
“I do want it. I want to make you feel good.” I slid down, and rested my head on his chest, shy about what I was about to say but needing to say it. “I want you to take me, to
“Not a whit,” I assured him, and watched, utterly rapt, as he undressed at the foot of the bed. By the time he was stripping out of his underclothes, I’d crawled halfway down the mattress reaching for him. He laughed. “No need to work as hard as that; I’m coming to you.” He laid himself down, and I was upon him in an instant. Now that the fog of my arousal had cleared, I could indulge in my most natural and instinctive obsession: curiosity. Determined to examine him closely and learn everything there was to know about his body, I crawled all over him, memorising every important detail. I catalogued every mole and scar. I squeezed his muscles. I caressed the finest hairs on his skin with just my fingertips, then played more boldly with the thick fur on his chest. I did extensive research into whether he preferred to have his nipples lightly pinched or firmly sucked. He found it funny how I sniffed all over him like a bloodhound, but his odour was intoxicating, and I longed to bury my nose in the places where it was strongest.
So a few days following, during the hours in which I was least likely to be sought out for tutoring or meals, I returned to the library, climbed up onto the chair, and took down the books again.
“Things will be very different when we return to London,” I said, wishing for reassurance, pressing my face against his chest.
My prick, untouched and still at only a half-stand, was now drooling a continuous strand of fluid as I gave myself the most wonderful stimulation. I did it so much, I began to lose control of my lungs and throat, and a few grunts turned into a joyous cry. I silenced myself at the instant I was able, but not soon enough. I was utterly still for a moment, listening for the footsteps of an inquisitive person come to investigate, but heard nothing.
It did not all happen at once. To begin with, I had not every hour of the day to myself, and these books were vast, one of them running to seven hundred pages. I dared not look at them when anyone else was in the library, or might suddenly appear. Additionally, even in my unscheduled hours, I had other interests, and continued to learn all there was to know about chemistry, geology, music, and certain languages, sometimes from books, sometimes from outdoors exploration, sometimes from knowledgeable (and patient) adults. And if the family went on holiday, our library was of course left behind entirely.
Settling into my lap, Watson squeezed his elbows in between my legs and the arms of the chair, bending over my prick to give a soft, open mouthed kiss to the tip. The shock sent a wave of pleasure up my spine and down my thighs; it was not just the warmth and wetness of it, but the
He continued to frig me until I felt a shiver of inevitability, and I cried out shamelessly as I reached my crisis with a prick inside me, feeling so full and helpless and radiant as white-hot pleasure cascaded over me. He milked abundant, uneven jets of spunk from my jerking prick as I clenched around him, and just as I was beginning to settle down, he grabbed me around the waist with both hands, which sent a final orgasmic jolt through me. He shuddered beneath me as he spent up inside me, grunting with the effort of it.
Once I had decided that I would seek an answer, the next step was to determine how to seek it in the most definitive yet deniable way. The obvious answer seemed to me to be the way that all great romances begin – with a look.
It was a warm day, and the breeze was not so strong up here as it was closer to the shore, making it uncomfortable to wear our coats. We checked for anyone else who might be strolling or picnicking, but it would seem that we had the little hill to ourselves, so we cast our coats aside. It was very intimate indeed, to be outdoors with Watson in my shirtsleeves. I felt emboldened, and desperate to know once and for all if he might share the tender affections I harboured for him.
“My dear,” he whimpered, dropping his head to rest on my shoulder, and tucking his arms beneath me so that he could hold me. “You must know that I adore you like no other.” He laughed a little and said, “You must know it, if for no other reason than you have read my effusive prose in the
To think of my years of reticence pains me now; he deserved better than my diffidence in this matter. I hope that he could discern my devotion all along, even if I never expressed it in words. After all, there was never anything secret about me. Oh, I could keep a hunch or a suspicion to myself, until such time as I could substantiate it, but in personal matters I was no Sphinx. My every moment of delight and disdain was painstakingly recorded in his chronicles.
It was difficult to think, which was always distressing to me, and compounded my nerves. But I took deep breaths, and concentrated on releasing the tension from every muscle in my body, and when Watson felt me relax there, he dipped his finger in to the first knuckle. I uttered only a little gasp, but then he slid it all the way up inside, and I cried out with how strange it felt. My naive body squeezed fitfully around this intruder, but Watson held his hand still, which allowed me to get accustomed to his presence. He continued to suck me, and the odd new sensation mingled with the familiar one.
It was messy work, though; we were both in shambles now, to say nothing of the bedclothes. Red-faced and glowing with perspiration, Watson slumped beside me, just as he remarked, “We must get up. The day has only just begun.”
It did not seem so much bigger to my eyes, but to my body it was enormous, and again I resisted involuntarily. I cannot say that I persevered because I was courageous; rather, I was overwhelmed by my curiosity, my determination to capture an inkling of what Watson might feel like. After some struggle, I got the tip of it inside me, and groaned again with fullness and relief. Once I rediscovered that most gratifying spot, I moved the dildo with short strokes, keeping it close to where it felt best, rubbing more than thrusting.
According to the boy, the dog was a mottled grey-and-black terrier, and it had been perfectly healthy and safe the night before, when it had laid itself down at the foot of the boy’s bed. He had awoken to find the dog absent, and had called to it all over the neighborhood, to no avail. I suggested to Watson that a brief exploration of the surrounding streets was in order, to familiarise ourselves with them.
