‘Good luck, then.’
Sherlock dashes into the kitchen and finds his husband sitting at the table with glassy eyes.
‘No. Maybe, they could show me.’
Nice indeed. ‘Yes, yes. I’m going home, Mycroft.’
John walks back to Sherlock and kisses him quickly on his delicious mouth. Sherlock is ready to deepen the kiss, but John pulls away.
‘It’s nothing, he just looked familiar. I’m probably wrong.’
‘You’re quite right. But I would have thought you’d have better things to do.’
‘Of course, I want you to. You did hear my wedding speech, right?’
“No, he started watching when I was in Manchester. We’ve just started the first episode of season 4. Want to join us?”
“I’ve already seen it, I’m making the tea.”
“I would never do this to you.”
“I have everything I need to know. I’ll tell you who did it tomorrow. Now, let me go home and watch the last episodes.”
John isn’t amused, ‘Oh, that’s what I was?’
it, but he never truly loved her. He liked her because she was nice to him, and she helped him through the worst times. He proposed to her after a few months of their relationship. The world expected it from him. That’s what they all expect, getting married and having kids. When Sherlock returned, John was ready to go with him to Baker Street and never look back. But it wasn’t right.
“Don’t tell me, it’s some eyes or a head?”
‘Exactly. I couldn’t admit that relationship to my dad. That day, I pretended I went out with my friends, stole the document and gave it to Mr. Lucas.’
And then they’re kissing. A person would think you can get used to be kissed like this, but Sherlock always feels like it’s their first time. They’ve been together 7 years and John still can make him week in his knees.
‘Okay, Evans. I can excuse it this time because nothing got taken. But please, no civilians at crime scenes!’
‘You can believe us, Miss Hope. Or, may I call you Hilda?’ She nods. ‘Okay… Your father is a very honest man, I know him from my work, and he lost something very important. Can you imagine what all of that could cause? I believe you are smart. Mr. Holmes and I can promise you that no one except the three of us will find out the truth.’
“Always.”
‘I promise. I bet I’ll have enough adrenaline with you.’
They are already leaving, but the DI stops them.
‘And my real name is Watson. John Watson.’
“I’m glad my John isn’t that stupid.”
“I called you and you told me you couldn’t come because of watching  TV.”
And he does.
“You’ll see. But, I must agree. Mike is still so satisfied with himself for introducing us to each other. And Harry? She would have beat me up, if I had married someone but you. She adores you.”
‘Maybe I did. But can you tell me why are you here?’
“I was bored, so I’ve started an experiment. I watched all 3 seasons of Sherlock.”
“It’s completely your fault. I will never have enough of you.”
‘Sherlock, please.’
Sherlock is talking too much. He doesn’t dare to look at John and pretends to examine something very interesting on the carpet. That’s why he doesn’t see John moving and sitting before him on the floor. He puts his hand on Sherlock’s knee. Sherlock is startled and keeps checking the floor.
‘Come tomorrow. I want you to take the credit.’
“You left me behind and look what happened!”
‘I never doubted you, Brother Mine. Can you tell me the story behind everything?’
“You’re probably right. And there is another answer. It’s from Molly now.”
“Who? And I’m not everyone, John!”
“I need to know how this ends.”
“It’s definitely intriguing, but I got annoyed. In the show, you married Mary. The man who is supposed to be me knew who she was and let you do it anyway. This is impossible behaviour.”
THE END
“Yes and yes. Are you aware you said his actual name?”
“Really? Friday.”
“Is it possible that you convinced him to watch Sherlock?”
‘No, no. It’s fine. Actually, more than fine!’
‘The pleasure is mine.’
“I can post our wedding photo with some text.”
‘What’s our next step?’ John asks when they’re back in the car.
“A secret sister? How? I can’t believe Sherlock would be so stupid. I don’t know if I’m able to continue.”
‘Yes, well. Okay, I guess. Can we sit?’
‘It depends on the person.’
“I had thought this show was dumb, then I quite liked it, but this? It’s beyond everything. The whole concept is absolutely different from the other episodes. And that scene with Molly? Even I recognized it was all wrong and I’m not an expert when emotions are involved. They should be happy my brother didn’t see it. He would get them arrested, because they made a clown of him.”
John and Molly just look at each other without saying anything.
‘The Sign of Three’ is the title of the next episode. The whole thing is about a wedding. John and Mary’s wedding. Fortunately, the real John never got to an actual ceremony.
Sherlock can’t believe his ears. He tries to hide his blushing. Fortunately, John doesn’t notice, but Mycroft does. He always does, but he says nothing.
‘We were always so cautious. I don’t think the baby is mine. I’ll undergo a paternity test as soon as possible. And don’t bring thoughts of my bloody wife into this moment, please.’
‘Is there one?’, Sherlock finds the piece of paper and reads:-
‘You don’t need to. I know I have no right to demand the truth from you, your work is secret.’
‘I guess this is it. You’ve saved the country again, Sherlock. But before you leave, we have something else to tell you.’
John actually laughs at this and Sherlock joins him.
Sherlock feels on edge because John is sitting right next to him. Their arms are almost touching.
“This is another dream, right? It reminds me of the previous episode with the bride, except now it¨s John’s dream. It cannot be real.”
‘I think Mycroft was talking about him once during dinner. He told me the previous doctor had to move, so they hired a new one. I remember something about him serving in Afghanistan. Then everything else got blurry when Myc licked my ear.’
‘I thought I was helping you.’
“This is really ridiculous, John. I can’t sleep well, you can’t sleep well. What’s the point of this?”
He isn’t sure how many days he stays lying on that sofa without moving or eating a thing. One morning (or is it an afternoon?) his phones rings. It’s Mycroft. He doesn’t want to speak with him, but he’s persistent. Sherlock answers the call simply because if he doesn’t, his brother would come here. That would be much worse.
‘Oh no!! I don’t want to know anything about what you and my brother do at home. It makes me feel sick.’
So, he’s back with Mary. He sometimes visits Sherlock but not as often as he’d like to. They still solve cases together but something stands between them. He discussed it with Greg last week. He told him there has been a bet on their relationship in Scotland Yard for years. John wasn’t surprised. Anyway, Lestrade advised him to tell everything to Sherlock. Maybe with a bottle of wine and a bouquet of flowers. But that’s ridiculous. He can’t march into 221B like that. He decides for the emails.
After a few long minutes where Sherlock doesn’t know where to position himself, he hears two voices downstairs. It’s Mrs. Hudson and the second one is… John. Then there are the steps and a soft knock on the door.
During endless wandering around the flat, something catches his attention. The DVDs. The DVDs of that dumb show everyone talks about. John and Mrs. Hudson love it, even Lestrade has seen it. Molly is definitely a big fan, she’s met some of the actors a few times. Dull. But, he could see it as an experiment. He’ll be able to have a long and satisfying discussion about how bad the show is, with the others later. Let’s try it then!
‘Exactly. They are so boring.’
The next day, he visits Scotland Yard. Maybe Lestrade can help him locate those three men.
John doesn’t bother going to his own bed. He lays on a sofa, so he can be closer to Sherlock. He’d do anything for him. He was a little bit disappointed Sherlock’s reply was ‘my flatmate’ rather than ‘my friend’. John would hope for something more, but friend would do.
“I suppose you didn’t sleep much when I was gone. And also, we were quite exhausted after our night’s ‘activities’. You’re insatiable.”
‘Quite so.’ Sherlock sends a message and puts his phone away.
“No lecture is more important than my husband. Will you tell me what’s going on?”
Sherlock is more than impressed.
“How do you like it anyway?” grins Greg.
Sherlock freezes. John is going to see the flowers and him getting ready to go out. He could understand all of this wrong. Sherlock leaves his bedroom and enters the sitting room. John is standing in the middle. He’s hiding something behind his back and Sherlock can deduce he’s nervous.
“Well...”
‘That speech was good.’
This day started quite well. They had breakfast together; there was chatting, smiling and an easy atmosphere between them. It isn’t like this all the time, that’s why John was enjoying it. But, then Lestrade called with a case. It was slightly a six.
He hangs up and Sherlock starts panicking. Is John coming here? What does he want from me? Mocking me, or does he really care about me? He isn’t quite sure why, but when he catches his image in a mirror, he decides to make himself looking good for his guest. After he showers, he dresses in a black shirt with his suit and fixes his curls. Another look into the mirror; he’s more satisfied now.
“Maybe, I am. Meet me in our bedroom and you’ll find out.”
Mr. Hope is on the edge of his chair. ‘Did you find it? You brother told me you knew something.’
‘Ask him what happened here this morning.’
‘It was… quite… good. I mean. It didn’t make you older at all.’
‘I think it was Gregson. He asked me for a date yesterday.’
‘Of course, he does. When we are...’
‘You can send him a message and apologise. We’ll explain it to him later. Together, I promise. I have a feeling he’ll understand. Satisfied?’
. There is also a sign below:-
‘That’s exactly what happened.’
John tenses, but he is determined to continue, ‘Oh, am I interrupting anything?’
’He did.’
“Good night, John. And thank you again for looking after me.”
The first rays of sunshine can be already seen through the window when the alarm clock goes off next time. John wakes up and is disoriented for a while. He’s not in his own bed. He doesn’t remember having a date last night. He chuckles. He hasn’t had a date for a long time. He’s in his best friend’s bed. He’s getting quite aware of his delicious smell. Sherlock is still asleep, facing John now. He can’t help but stare at him. How he loves these dark curls. And the lips. Oh, those lips! He can imagine kissing them. Only now he notices they are holding hands. He panics.
“Sherlock?”
‘I’m sorry, I have a lot of paperwork in my office. But I’d like to accompany you when you tell Mr. Hope.’
‘I apologise for him. He often has problems with his behaviour.’
‘And your men aren’t able to solve it? Even you can’t?’
He feels so awkward suddenly. But he finds he can’t lie to him, ‘No’, he immediately turns red.
‘Would you like to have one?’
And then he’s gone. Sherlock misses his presence, but then he tells himself how stupid that is. He hails a cab and spends the whole ride home imagining the doctor’s smile in his mind palace.
John is ready to react to this, but he changes his mind. ‘I’m glad. But I suppose those poisonous ones were better, right?’
And then, there is Mary, Sherlock’s return and John’s reaction to it. Sherlock wonders what made the writers change the story so much. Well, Mary Morstan was very real, unfortunately. But it never happened as it is pictured in the bloody show.
‘The next step is to return the document back to where it belongs, without Mr. Hope noticing. I’m afraid that will involve talking to my brother.’
John sighs and changes the subject.
He can see Sherlock speaking with Gregson and John doesn’t like it at all. He is actually jealous. When Sherlock sees him, he lights up and turns his attention to him. That makes John feel special. They look for some valuable clues and discuss them with Greg after.
“Has anything happened?”
“Yes, yes. I’m okay, only a little sore. Have you called him already?”
“Good boy, now excuse me.”
John smiles for the first time during this day.
His thinking is disturbed by knock on the door. It’s a delivery guy. He brought him a big bouquet of roses. Sherlock searches it for a note, but there is none. He is sure it is from the detective sergeant. He saw the flowers for Mummy and assumed Sherlock liked them. He can’t say it’s his thing. Everyone buys roses, they are quite ordinary, and Sherlock isn’t fan of ordinary.
‘I remember someone told me he liked that.’
‘It was nice to work with you, Mr. Holmes.’
‘You need me? I thought you didn’t need anyone. You’re the clever one.’
“Do it!”
He grins and Sherlock heart skips a beat.
It’s getting dark outside and Sherlock takes season 2 from the shelf. It’s quite addictive. The cases are exciting, even if they are a little bit changed from those they really solved. But, it’s Jim Moriarty who makes him nervous about what happens next. The suspicion is definitely there. Sherlock shivers when he sees the other him standing on the roof of Bart’s. There are no changes from their actual lives in this situation. It happened exactly like that. It’s disturbing. He has to admit those two actors are brilliant. They are able to capture all the raw emotions. Although this is odd. Sherlock has been told, there are some adjustments, but this much?
“Well, I was. I think I still am, but some things disappointed me. I guess I can stay for one episode.”
“To be certain everything is okay with you?”
“I suppose so.”
‘I don’t think so.’
I’d love to share the best moment of my life with you. It happened five years ago. On that day, I married my best friend and the love of my life, Mr. William Sherlock Scott Holmes. #HappilyEverAfter #Johnlock
“Definitely. We have nothing to do anyway.”
“I know his name well, John. You’ve known me for a long time, so you should have noticed it’s a joke.”
‘I’ll bring it to you. Wait a second.’ She leaves them alone.
“You’re never hungry, but you have to eat! Promise me we’ll order something for dinner later at least.”
John takes a few steps forward until he’s only a few centimetres from the other man.
‘Definitely not anything, but he doesn’t see a reason to not trust me, and I assume he can’t send another politician with you. Something’s telling me this is a secret mission, right? And I’m just the doctor.’
“Yes, yes. I think I’ve found everything I can.”
Sherlock has never been good with relationships; they involve talking and caring about others. Awful. But he finds himself enjoying John’s company a lot. And that beard does things to him.
Mycroft decides to keep quiet; he needs Sherlock sharp. This case might be really significant for his career, that’s why he is terrified Sherlock’s got only the sheet on. He doesn’t want to ask if he has something underneath it.
‘I don’t think so. But anyway, I appreciate you made everything clear to me.’
“Only one episode remains.”
“And it’s done. Look!”
“My best friend John Hamish Watson.”
‘Evans. Why?’
“Do you want me to come?”
‘Okay, then. Could you guarantee no one but you and your brother will find out the truth?’
It’s Mummy’s birthday soon and Sherlock is going to spend a weekend with his family. He’d like to skip all of that but Mycroft forced him. He always does that. His Mum invited John and Mary too,  but they refused with an apology which made it quite easier for Sherlock. He really doesn’t want to watch them happy together. He’s been avoiding Mary for a long time. She fortunately thinks it is because of the thing with Magnussen and the shooting.
‘I did promise that.’
But there is no answer. Sherlock doesn’t know why John is acting so weird, but then it happens. The scene in a morgue. John beating Sherlock and calling him a monster.
When John pulls away, because he needs some air, Sherlock lets go reluctantly and whimpers, ‘Hmmm.’
“It’s more practical. You needn’t to stand up every three hours to come here checking on me. And the bed is more comfortable.”
John smirks and shifts his hand a little bit higher. He leans closer and whispers into Sherlock’s ear. ‘What would you think about an old army doctor?’
“You know I’m not a big fan of this season.”
“Wait! Are there any other reasons why you don’t like it?”
‘When did he confront you again?’
‘Come on, John’, Sherlock rolls his eyes, ‘I thought you knew me better. He sent me the flowers, so I thought the dinner would be a nice thing for me to do.’
Mycroft wants to go with Sherlock, because another pair of ears could be useful, but he is busy, so he sends Doctor Bellinger instead. His shift has just ended, and he’s free for the afternoon. The thought of spending time with him is making Sherlock nervous.
‘Theoretically, yes, but you did well back there.’
‘See Sherlock, this one was quite simple. Nothing for you to do. I know you have a more interesting case right now. Myc hasn’t told me everything yet, but I can see from his behaviour that he’s nervous, and he mostly isn’t like that. It must be very important.’
“I see the people are quite clever. They also don’t agree I am that stupid to not remember my sister and forget my dog was actually my best friend. And his parents didn’t look for him. Hmm interesting.”
Sherlock is lying on the sofa.. He is trying to occupy his twisting mind, because he is lonely. This day has been boring so far. He could go outside and bring down some criminals, but he’s too lazy even for that. He gets up, he needs to find something to do before he starts to shoot the walls; Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t be happy. He has to admit, he’s sometimes scared of her. She might be old, but she still has it in her. Her husband was a drug dealer though, so she’s had to deal with worse than Sherlock.
“The actress who played Mary.”
“Here is your tea. Have you got a headache? And don’t lie to me!”
this time. A magnificent choice. Sherlock likes this person whoever it is.
‘He was in the corridor before; small, blond hair, doctor’s uniform. He has a limp.’
“I am asking, if you’re okay, Sherlock!!”
“You know, I was thinking about the wedding earlier. I mean yours and Mary’s. Stamford and your sister weren’t around. There was no way, you wouldn’t have invited them. I guess the writers wanted to show the audience they didn’t agree with you marrying her. It’s all leading to the other us becoming a couple, right?”
The other two laugh.
“So, you like it that much you don’t answer my calls.” John can’t help but laugh.
John smiles softly and winks at her, but Sherlock doesn’t seem to pay attention.
‘Then call me John.’
‘I know where you man Lucas is. But I’m afraid you won’t be able to speak with him. He’s dead. Murdered three days ago. I’ve already solved the case.’
“Okay, I’ll stay with you if you insist.”
“They? So, you know the man?”
‘That’s not what I meant. You’ll need luck if you expect to put up with my horrible brother!’
‘They were perfect! How you do..? Wait… were those from you?’
“Twitter is full of their opinions.”
John tries to keep a straight face.
‘This isn’t good. I genuinely believed you had better news.’ He turns to Mycroft; he’s terrified. ‘What are we going to do? You know what could follow. You don’t seem to be too bothered.’
Suddenly, Mrs. Hudson appears in the flat, and she’s not alone. The young lady with her looks both scared and determined.
‘I’d like to see the crime scene.’
this time. When he’s typing
It’s almost noon when Sherlock wakes up. He showers and heads into the kitchen, hoping John had left him something for breakfast. He always takes care of his eating habits, even more since he’s been recovering from Mary’s gunshot. He actually moved back to Baker Street. Mary tried to preserve a straight face, but Sherlock recognised she was angry. But he couldn’t care less. He had John, and it was all her fault anyway.
‘That’s it, I guess. When are you planning to reveal it to him?’
‘You know, when I came back from Afghanistan, I had no friends and no job. The army pension was so low, I needed money. No one was looking for a doctor. One day, I met a soldier I took care of back in the army. He told me about the work for the government he was doing. He gave me a contact number, so I tried it. I had nothing to lose. And they assigned me to Mycroft. I’ve been his eyes and ears.’
“All people are idiots, except me of course.”
“Maybe I know, but I can¨t tell you. They want to tell you themselves.”
Sherlock is brought back from his memories by his phone. Lestrade. He needs a new case so much, but now he’s determined to watch the whole show.
Sherlock laughs inside. The man seems to notice that. He’s good. Sherlock should be more careful around him.
‘He wanted the document.’
“It appears I have. Please John, don’t ask me about my name again.”
It all happened so quickly. The wedding, the best man speech. John knew he was marrying the wrong person at that moment, but he was too much of a coward to change anything. When Mary shot Sherlock, he was so angry and wanted to leave her. He actually did. He moved back to Baker Street to take care of him. He was enjoying their time together and he hadn’t seen Mary for weeks. He thought Sherlock was happy too; he was probably wrong. After a few months, Sherlock told him to get back with Mary. He could handle it himself from there, and they were expecting a baby. John was hurt. He had started to believe Sherlock returned his feelings, but it was probably not the case. It was only wishful thinking.
“Please, don’t” he whispers softly. It makes John’s heart skip.
‘Of course, I do. You know I love sunflowers. They’re gorgeous.’
At first the doctor tenses a little, but then he starts laughing. And Sherlock joins him. He feels so relieved even though he doesn’t know why.
Sherlock can’t resist and asks Greg if he knows anything about Doctor Bellinger. But he doesn’t have much information about the mysterious man.
‘This is Dr. John Bellinger. He works with your father. I’d like someone to hear your story with me.’
It’s Molly.
“Not hungry, and yes it’s late.”
John starts crying. Sherlock kneels down in front of him and wipes his tears.
‘I hope you’ll take some clothes!’
He hates him. He hated him even when they were kids. Mycroft always acted like he was smarter than Sherlock.  He’s standing in his flat and demanding that he goes somewhere with him. He interrupted him during an experiment; he’ll have to throw all these nails away and ask Molly for some new ones.
‘I think you should read the note hidden in the flowers.’
‘Mycroft probably assumed I would be disrespectful, so he sent a babysitter with me.’
Sherlock blushes and turns back to John, ‘I love you too, John.’
‘Please, promise me you won’t say anything to my dad, I don’t want to worry him. I need to know why he spoke with you? Wait… don’t say anything. He lost something important, am I right?’
‘I think you’ve learned from this. Goodbye, Miss Hope.’
“Good. I need to see the rest. I can’t see how they can make them a couple now. And there were all those clues! All for nothing.”
“Sherlock Holmes”
“I’ve been for a while now. I didn’t want to disturb you when you were watching me.”
He takes a disc with a title Sherlock Season 1 and puts in the recorder. He sits in his chair and waits for the inevitably stupid series. It is based on their most thrilling cases; the authors took inspiration from John’s blog. It’s quite weird and funny to watch someone who should be you, but isn’t actually you.
‘How can I help you, Miss...?’
‘I will never change how I feel about you, but what about the baby, John?’
‘May I ask a question?’ Sherlock nods. ‘Are you wearing anything under the sheet?’
Sherlock likes the Twitter thing a lot. He spends the next hour reading through it.
‘That would be lovely. Thank you. May I sit down here?’
“You bet! We’ve already got over 100 likes.  And Amanda Abbington has replied to us.”
‘The roses? Really? You can’t fool me. I know you hate them, you’d never buy them, except for your Mum. But she already had her birthday. So?’
‘You told me earlier you lived alone. I can’t believe there is no Mrs. Watson.’ Sherlock is getting into a very dangerous area, but he isn’t able to stop himself.
‘Of course. Here it is.’
In a couple hours procedure repeats;
John is jealous. That new young detective is annoying. He always smiles at Sherlock, and the worst part is Sherlock seems to be flattered by that. Awful. He clicks the send button. Fuck you, Gregson!!
, he’s actually imagining kissing Sherlock. He suddenly feels a strong urge to be close to him.
‘You can always rely on Sherlock Holmes. I’ve known him for only a few days, but I can tell you he’s a genius.’
It’s been three months since John was back with her again. He sometimes comes to check on Sherlock but it’s different, Sherlock understands that; Mary is his wife, and they’re expecting a baby. He simply can’t compete with her.
‘So, you’re suggesting to put the thing back in the box without telling Mr. Hope.’
“You’ve noticed?”
‘Good. I think we need to talk, Sherlock.’
This one makes John smile.
“I’m so happy you married me instead of Mary.”
John moves restlessly, Sherlock sees that, but Mycroft continues talking.
“Starving.”
“Sherlock!!”
‘I don’t know what you want to hear from me. I have nothing to say to you.’
Sherlock kisses him softly and then hugs him. They stay like this for a long moment.
“Yes, I know and I’m grateful, but you slept on the sofa. I can tell from your posture. Your back is hurting. Maybe more than my head.”
“I thought you were a big fan.”
“I agree. I thought Greg was well described there, but one moment ruined it. Enjoy your afternoon, boys! And don’t forget to call me tomorrow!”
‘Oh god, yes!’
“I think you are good... I’ll keep doing this just to be sure.”
‘Are you going to him right now?’
‘Okay, but one more thing. What about Gregson? He’s waiting for me.’
John is desperate. He adores his crazy flatmate. Well, ex-flatmate. He realised his feelings before The Fall. He was always attracted to his brilliant mind, and he also found him good-looking. Actually, who wouldn’t, with those dark unruly curls, gorgeous eyes, and a cupid bow mouth? And that perfect body. John was often fantasising about Sherlock’s long arms and legs. But it became something more. He simply enjoyed their domesticity. He fell for his best friend completely. Then that bastard died.
‘And this is Doctor John Bellinger.’
“Okay, okay. Everything seems to be fine. See you in a few!”
John has been quiet until now, ‘Mr. Hope, bring the box here, give it one more try!’
Another lonely night it is. He sits at his laptop with a glass. There is another message from that address. A picture with
“I mean in the bed. With me. It’s quite large, if you’re worried.”
They don¨t take a cab on the way home, John decides they need a walk considering they will spend the rest of the day sitting or lying on the sofa.
“Really, Sherlock? It’s a platform where people share their thoughts and opinions with each other.”
‘How do you know anyone sent them to me? I could buy them myself.’
John takes a shower and tries to finish his book. But, he can’t focus on anything what isn’t Sherlock. He looks okay and healthy, but you never know with concussion. Time to check on him. He’s deep in his dreams and looks beautiful like this. So peaceful.
“Have you? Since when?”
‘You think? He’s smarter than most of the yarders, yes, but I haven’t noticed the other thing. And you’re stalling. I thought you wanted to talk.’
“I’m glad I can make you eat something without complaining.”
‘John Bellinger is a false name. And he isn’t a doctor here, he works for me. You deserve to know the truth, and if I’m right, you had a suspicion anyway.’
“What?”
‘Who lives with you, Mr. Hope?’
Sherlock focuses on the case; there are three possible men who know what to do with those kinds of documents; he’ll talk to them tomorrow.
John is excited. Solving cases is a lot better than his boring job. Of course, he helps people, but it doesn’t bring him that much-needed adrenaline. And he is also going to see Sherlock again. He hasn’t seen him for five days. It’s ridiculously small amount of time compared to the time after he got married. He hadn’t seen him for weeks back then, and he still feels guilty about it. But that time is gone, now he should focus on this new murder.
‘Please, don’t make this worse, I want to solve this quietly. We can still do something about it, but if you’re not honest with me, I’ll have to share my conclusions with your father.’
John has never been good at deductions, not as good as him, but now he is trying to identify Sherlock’s expression. He looks vulnerable? Sad? Lonely? This has to stop now!
“It was Lestrade. They haven’t solved their case yet...”
Johns looks happy to see Sherlock, but he’s definitely imagining that. When they’re done, they talk with Lestrade about the possible perpetrator and then take a cab to Baker Street. They’re having tea and chatting about what has happened since they saw each other last time. John, however, doesn’t talk much, he’d rather hear everything about Sherlock’s time. Then they have dinner at Angelo’s and take a walk back home. Before Sherlock steps into the doorway, John hesitates but decides to go home instead. Sherlock hides his painful expression and enters.
“It’s a shame you didn’t call me sooner. I didn’t see the first one and that makes it much more difficult.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
‘I can send someone to put it there. He left a few minutes before you came back.’
Something was wrong with him. Of course, there is the fact that John is a very good-looking man with bright eyes and a charming smile, but Sherlock is certain there is more. He needs to speak with Mycroft! But first, he tries to search for some information by himself. He finds three men named John Bellinger, but none of them is the hot guy who Sherlock met an hour ago.
“Where? In your bedroom? On the floor you mean? It will be worse than the sofa.”
‘I had several girlfriends and boyfriends before Afghanistan but not since my deployment.’
He arrives to His Highness office.
"You did it again!”
#JohnlockForever
“Who is she?”
‘I no longer want to speak about your… about whatever it is with Lestrade.’
A winning smile appears on John’s face. He takes Sherlock’s hand and leads them back to Baker Street.
Sherlock’s ears turn pink. Only John is able to do this to him.
Sherlock lets him go with the promise. He lies back and starts thinking about Magnussen. Sherlock from the show killed him. He would have happily shot him in the head also, that bastard was a horrible person. But there wasn¨t Mary or a baby to protect, and he knew John was absolutely capable of taking care of himself. Sherlock realized it was better to let Mycroft solve the problem. He had different work to do. He was about to marry his best friend. It’s incredible it’s already been five years since their wedding. And John still doesn’t want to run away from him.
“No, no, just checking on you. Tell me your name?”
She sits on Sherlock’s chair and they watch silently for some minutes.
‘A young lady came here this morning, she was walking around and we started chatting. She wanted to see the room, because she read about the murder in the newspapers. I didn’t see a problem with it, she was polite and didn’t seem dangerous, so I took her inside. She saw the blood stain and fainted. I ran to a pub around the corner for a little brandy and when I came back, she was gone.’
“Come on!! Redbeard was actually a friend? Molly was right.”
John notices a heartbroken expression on Sherlock’s face. This has to stop right now!
‘Tell Mr. Holmes what you’ve just said to me.’
‘Yes, I want this to be over. Will you join me?’
Detective Gregson is also at the crime scene, staring at Sherlock from time to time when he thinks Sherlock doesn’t notice. But he does and finds himself not caring much. He is examining a dead body when the young sergeant approaches him with an invitation for dinner. Sherlock is dazed and doesn’t know how to respond. When he sees John arriving, he replies with a quick apology that he promised to have dinner with John this evening. He’ll let him know if he’s free tomorrow.
“The episodes based on John’s blog were quite good, I have to admit it. But, when they came up with their own plots, it started getting worse. I’m not impressed.”
And then there is a big revelation in the end.
‘Come on, Sherlock! I need you. Put your clothes on!’
When Mary is in bed, John writes another email. The last one. He will talk with Sherlock about his feelings in person after that. He has to tell him everything. Even if Sherlock doesn’t feel the same, John can’t lie to himself and pretend he lives in a happy marriage. He is wondering what Sherlock thinks about all of this; he might think it’s all a joke. He couldn’t be more wrong; John means it. The poisonous plants were his own idea. He chooses
Before they enter one of the rooms, Sherlock catches a glimpse of someone. It’s a man walking down the corridor. Sherlock is convinced the man was looking at them but trying to hide that. It’s suspicious.
Mrs. Holmes invited them for her birthday weekend. John always enjoys time with Sherlock’s family. They are nothing like his own one with an abusive father, a weak mother, and almost always gone sister. He adores Sherlock’s mother. But Mary doesn’t feel well and the doctor recommended that she stay at home. John sent a birthday card with an apology.
“Yes, love?”
‘Thank you, Mr. Holmes. That’s everything I need to know. And once again, please don’t tell my dad about my visit.’ And then she disappears.
Sherlock shifts more to his side and John lies next to him.
He shouts again and again at TV during watching. After it ended, he sits quiet for a few minutes.
Sherlock is so distracted by John’s beard and his proximity in the cab, he doesn’t know what to say anymore; he just keeps watching out of the window. Fortunately, they arrive at the mansion which belongs to Hope’s family. Miss Hope is the only person there, and that’s exactly what they need.
Despite himself, Sherlock couldn’t help but have a good time. They were all laughing good naturedly at Greg’s misfortunates, Greg had taken it surprisingly well. Sherlock suspected it had a lot to do with the fact that Greg was about a bottle of wine down and had got progressively more giggly as the evening went on, the sadness on his face diminishing with every sip. Harry happily filled Sherlock in stories from John’s youth – much to John’s embarrassment. “His nickname at school was Three-Continents Watson!”
“Mr Holmes, the journalist is here. We’ve booked off a section of the bar for you to speak to him and we’re all ready to go.” She glared around impatiently.
“Do you masturbate?” He heard Harry groan with disgust when Clara asked the question.
John snorted humourlessly. “So are you telling me not only are you shagging his brother, you are also spying on me?”
“For god’s sake Mycroft, what do you want?” Sherlock growled down the phone “I haven’t even had a chance to read the seventeen, oh no it’s probably nearer nineteen now, text messages you sent me yesterday”.
He didn’t mean to yell it. He didn’t mean for the people sitting nearby to stop their conversations and turn to look at them, stunned.
John groaned but he was smiling, his cheeks rosy from good wine and good friends. “Sixth form, not school let’s be clear about that. For god’s sake Harry why did you have to bring this up?”  Harry was now shaking with laughter, pleased at how she had managed to embarrass her brother. “This makes me sound like some sort of lothario. Pathetic as it sounds, I have only slept with three people in my whole life and they just happened to be from three different continents. One of them was a girl in my class, her family were originally from Japan but she was born in Essex so I’m not entirely sure that counts as another continent. There was an American I met in a club I had gotten into with fake id, she was much older than me, I was drunk and she took me back to her flat. I was so pissed I didn’t know what I was doing. She ate me alive, it was terrifying.” He laughed a bit at the memory. “And then there was… “ he trailed off.
John bumps into Sherlock. Literally.
“No thank you” the man said, still not taking his eyes off his mobile, but walking round the back of a bookshelf to browse.
John didn’t just let people into his life that easily, that was now painstakingly clear to him. Sherlock had known him two days and Sherlock had messed him around already in that time and John had given him a chance and invited him into his circle. This realisation that John had broken down his guarded barriers, invited Sherlock into his closest circle and they had accepted him without question. Thrilled for John that he had finally, finally found someone he might be willing to trust again. Sherlock had never felt so humbled and so fond of anyone in his life.  The feeling was consuming and he found that he was beginning to crave it.
“John! John! You’ve got a visitor” John’s landlady, Mrs Hudson, was shouting from outside his flat. He thought for a mad second that it would be Mary. She had text him again this afternoon, but he hadn’t replied.
“The man who kidnapped you this morning is my manager, and less importantly my brother, Mycroft. He is extremely, ah, sensitive where I am concerned. I had a rough time when I was in my early twenties and he hasn’t exactly got past that. He was worried that you might be tempted to drag my name into the mud with the press, rehash old rumours about me.” Sherlock explained.
He smelled her as soon as he walked through the door to the suite. Her perfume permeated the rooms, rose and jasmine with a hint of spice. She had been there no more than an hour. He pushed John sharply away from him as he heard her walk from the bedroom into the living space of the huge suite, her stilettos clattering on the shiny wooden floor.
“Don’t play stupid. Why did you spent approximately 36 minutes at an address in Baker Street yesterday in the company of one” Sherlock heard Mycroft flick over a page “Doctor John Watson?”
“You’ve actually got quite big feet.” Sherlock remarked.
“You are overreacting Mycroft, I don’t know what story you think he has to sell. I pecked the man on the lips. It’s not like I had a drug fuelled gay orgy with him at his flat” Sherlock said stubbornly.
“About that, John you have to understand-“ Sherlock began but John interrupted.
“Why don’t you take a seat?” John didn’t know why he was being so polite to him after what he had put him through. Perhaps it was the look of complete helplessness on Sherlock’s usually arrogant looking face.
He looked up the second that John and Sherlock walked into the room.  “John!” he said getting to his feet. John’s sister Harry and Clara both looked round at the sound of Johns’ name.
“Do you have any idea what some of these books are worth?” He looked incredulous at the casualness of John’s tone and yanked his phone out of his pocket to start typing away on it. “John, look – this is a first edition Hobbit! Worth at least £2,000 for that one book alone. And those ones there, are signed Ian Fleming’s. I’ve only been through three of these boxes… who knows what’s in the others.”
“Films? Blimey good for you. The pay though, some of my old friends from school been in the business longer than you, they are scraping by on next to nothing. How’s the pay in films? Your last film for example, what did you get paid?’
He hung up the phone and threw it onto the bed next to him, burying his head into his pillow to try and forget the feeling of John’s mouth against his.
Greg’s head was bowed, he did look guilty.
“I don’t care what you say, you look like shit and you clearly haven’t had a good meal in days. If you are staying until my roof, you obey my rules. Rule number one is that you eat dinner. You go and shower and put some proper clothes on. Then, I will order the food and you will eat it.”
“Pleasure to meet you Molly” Sherlock smiled at Molly, the kind of shy smile he knew endeared him to a certain type woman. “Thinking woman’s crumpet” was a label that often got thrown around in the press when referring to him, stupid expression that made no sense, but he could tell from the way that Molly had reacted to him on her doorstep that she was one of those women. She couldn’t take her eyes off him, it was a bit disconcerting. To break the ice, he passed her the bottle of wine that John had thrust into his hands before they rang the doorbell. He wasn’t accustomed to all these social niceties, thought them pointless worth of effort, but he found that John was willing to help him, and surprisingly for John he was willing to try.
Either way, he had to be sure that his instinct was right. Had to be sure that he wasn’t too inherently selfish, that he was capable of thinking about someone else.
“Come on now John, we haven’t got time for your inane questions. Your frankly awful taste in coffee has offended me enough, who drinks an espresso at this time of day?” Sherlock replied, brushing John aside “I guess I should be grateful it was only a small cup”.
is that on your neck?
“Erm… This is Sherlock. I hope you don’t mind me bringing someone Molly” John said, leaning forward to press his cheek to Molly’s, when he pulled away Sherlock saw his tongue darting out to lick his dry bottom lip nervously.
“He’s also Sherlock’s brother.”
“My hotel has been surrounded by press, they are all camped outside the door. The hotel asked if there was someplace else I could go, the other guests of the hotel had been complaining about it.”
Once the food had been ordered, John was busying himself in the kitchen, grabbing two wine glasses and pouring a substantial quantity of Sauvignon Blanc into each when he heard Sherlock calling him from the front room.
He backed into the room, still wrapped around Sherlock when he felt his legs hit the side of his bed. He made to turn around so that he could throw Sherlock onto the bed, but Sherlock was quicker. Before John had even had a chance to move, Sherlock had pushed him so that he was sitting on the edge of the bed, his bare feet still on the floor. John saw Sherlock sink to his knees in front of him. Sherlock suddenly leaned back, his eyes on John’s lap and his face looking alarmed. John felt immediately self-conscious.
Tonight Sherlock had a game plan. Throwing himself into the deep end, he was going to prove to himself that he wasn’t cut out for a normal life with a normal relationship and that he would be bored by it. He would go to this dinner with John’s dull friends and he would look back ashamedly at these two days of weakness. Mycroft would sneer and tell him that he had always told Sherlock that this was beneath them.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock spat through his gritted teeth. His body, which had been quivering with arousal, was now shaking with anger and panic.
Sherlock raised his eyebrow at this and couldn’t stop a small grin reaching his face “at school? Should I be worried about that?”
John woke suddenly the next morning. He could tell by Sherlock’s tone of voice something was wrong.
“You sound surprised,” John giggled.
He could hear Molly, Clara, Harry and John giggling loudly in the kitchen. He suspected they didn’t realise how thin the walls were.
(See the end of the chapter for
had turned up on her doorstep. That said a lot about his ego. It clouded his judgment from seeing what the expression on her face really said. He could see it now though. She was surprised that he had turned up on her doorstep
If he could have picked a moment to bump into his ex-wife, it wouldn’t be drinking alone in the pub looking worse for wear and like he hadn’t slept for a month, which he hadn’t. She herself had had a bit too much to drink, she was leaning her head towards him and her eyes were glinting.
When he came back, pints in hand he took a deep breath before speaking.  “To tell you the truth, I’ve been going back and forth about whether I should tell you John. I really don’t want to hurt your feelings in anyway.” John’s face obviously displayed his confusion because Greg pressed on. “His name is Mycroft and he’s… well he’s Sherlock Holmes’ manager.”
“They are using one of the smaller conference rooms next door as my dressing room. Perhaps we should talk in there.”
"You have to stop" John laughed weakly, his breathing heavy.
Sherlock smiled to himself, it wasn’t a question he was used to. His face was always on a billboard, a gossip column or on the television. He wasn’t used to people not knowing who he was – it was oddly refreshing.
“He told me to piss off.”
“Greg, you knew what he did to me, he wormed his way into my life and he had a girlfriend. A fucking girlfriend. It’s public knowledge that he has a girlfriend but I’m such an idiot I didn’t even realise. I think about how at Clara’s birthday the rest of you must have been looking at me like a fucking fool. Wondering how I couldn’t know that he was involved with someone else. He made me look like an absolute idiot in front of the only people I care about. He ripped me to pieces in just two days and I am doing my utmost to forget it and you are dragging all this back up again by getting involved with his fucking brother.”
“Well it’s getting late. You can sleep in my room, I’m happy to kip on the sofa.”
“It seems like a cause for concern when I have to pay my brother to care about my welfare” Sherlock retorted.
“This is Sherlock, Sherlock this is Harry, my sister, that’s Clara and Greg” John said pointing everyone out. Sherlock saw Harry exchange a significant look with Clara. Clara immediately jumped up from the table, beaming.
“Hello” John said feigning confidence, trying to take attention away from the heat he could feel reddening his ears “anything I can do for you?”
The sound of his mobile ringing woke Sherlock up. He rolled over, his eyes adjusting to the morning light streaming in through the curtains he forgot to draw last night. He reached out for it but his mobile rang off. He looked down at his bare chest, the angry looking red mark from yesterday had faded but was still visible. This would mean longer in the make-up chair this morning before his photoshoot trying to disguise it.
“Fine, fine. I’ll text Greg.” He had said it to shut her up, but she probably had a point. He couldn’t mope around for the rest of his life.
Greg went red and his hand flew up to cover the mark on his throat. “Oh God... well I’ve been seeing someone actually. It’s a relatively recent thing and I haven’t seen you for ages, which is why I haven’t said anything.”
“I do know” Mycroft replied. “I’ve done a full background check on him. £37.31 in his bank account currently, shares a flat with one Clara Campbell”. He paused, then added “Girlfriend?”
“I was terrified. This was all so new to me, I didn’t want someone else to be there and ruin what we had. Irene was angry; her publicist had insisted that she fly to London to attend certain publicity events with me. It was her anniversary with her girlfriend and instead of the weekend she had planned she had to spend a weekend with me pretending to be loved up. We both had people we’d rather have been with. If she couldn’t have what she wanted, I couldn’t have what I wanted.  Her idea of a fair exchange.”
“Below the belt Mycroft” Sherlock snarled back, jaw clenched.
Her red lips broke into a devious smile as she said “Can’t a girl just turn up at her boyfriend’s hotel room unannounced anymore?”
It was getting close to five o’clock, he had already sent his only employee home as it seemed pointless to have more staff in the shop than they had had customers, and he was thinking about shutting up for the day when the bell tinkled and the door flung open. A tall man in a well-tailored crisp white shirt and black jeans walked in, texting on his mobile. His eyes were obscured by a pair of aviator Raybans but his high cheekbones and plump lips made the man instantly recognisable, even to John who had never been much into films. John cleared his throat.
“Hello!” A young woman said cheerfully as she opened the door to John. Early 30s, single, with a cat – it had moulted a bit on her cardigan, scientist of some sort but not immediately obvious which specific field. It was clear she wasn’t expecting John to bring someone because her eyes lingered on Sherlock for a while before they widened in recognition. She looked quickly over to John, her face paling in shock.
“Thanks for inviting me” John replied bluntly.
“Listen, I’ve got a contact that could go through these boxes and the books in your shop and give you a really good idea of what you actually have. Please, John, I certainly owe you a favour for letting me stay.”
John felt his heart plummet. He wanted to be sick. How could his perfect day yesterday turn so terribly wrong?
He couldn’t stop his heart seeping out and infecting his brain. He had worked so hard to pretend he didn’t have one; it was all coming as quite a shock to him.
The sound of John’s laugh filled Sherlock’s heart with warmth. His smile made his eyes crinkle at the side. Sherlock, for the second time in over ten years, was seized with the uncontrollable urge to feel lips move against his, John’s lips. To let John kiss back this time and break down every restraint that Sherlock had put in place for so long. He leaned forward and gently ran his hand up John’s neck and then stroked along his jaw line. John took a miniscule step towards him and then Sherlock couldn’t help himself, not even caring if anyone saw them despite his brother’s warning this morning that every pocket now housed a camera. He grabbed John by the lapels of his jacket and yanked him towards him. Pressing his lips roughly against John’s, a surge of heat rushed through his veins as he heard John moan into his mouth. It was exhilarating; he knew he was awakening the beast that had hibernated within him.
“Well if you don’t mind. If your friend won’t mind you bringing along a date..?” Sherlock couldn’t believe he was letting the words come out of his mouth. He had spent the whole morning chastising himself for getting distracted from the work, but now everything seemed to come second to getting the man in front of him to beam at him like he was now. Every instinct in his body was telling him this was dangerous, that he could end up regretting this for the rest of his life but then again he had always been addicted to danger.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, completely astounded. “John, how could you not see..? If I am sure of one thing it is that Clara is definitely a lesbian. It’s so blatantly, to use your word, obvious that she is extremely attracted to your sister. Her pupils dilate when she looks at her, she leans forward to speak to her as if she’s the only one in the room and frankly she looks down far too often at your sister’s lips for someone with no interest in kissing her. I am deeply concerned if you think that is in anyway platonic...”
“Sorry” John said feeling embarrassed. Had he misread the situation? No that was ridiculous, he’d felt how hard Sherlock had been. But what if this was another example of Sherlock’s confusing mixed signals. “You don’t have to… you know” he nodded down to his crotch.
The laughter from the kitchen drowned out the resulting awkward silence.
The door flung open and a woman with a headset and a clipboard walked in.
Greg took a long sip of his beer and then wiped the foam off his upper lip. “It’s a he actually.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him and said “I have a photo shoot tomorrow. I was hoping not to have third degree burns on my chest, doesn’t make for the most attractive image, but since you were a doctor when you were in… Iraq? Afghanistan? Still not sure.  Perhaps you could take a look and we might be able to avoid any permanent damage.”
“Greg, I don’t want you to stop seeing him. I was just shocked.” John looked down at his watch. “It’s getting late, I might head home.”
"They can be washed" John chuckled as he wrapped Sherlock up in a cuddle and they lay there together. Sherlock eventually got up and went to the bathroom, and John took the opportunity to pull back the covers and climb under the duvet. He thought he might have been too presumptuous to assume they would be sleeping in the same bed together after what had just happened because Sherlock just stood next to the bed for a while before eventually climbing in next to him. John kissed him lightly on the lips and was just drifting off to sleep when he heard Sherlock whisper into the darkness.
Also trigger warning for abusive relationships, dubcon and drug use.
“Roommate” Sherlock had heard the accusation in Mycroft’s voice and rebutted with defiance. He was so confused about why he had jumped to his defence. What did it matter if John had a girlfriend? Nothing to do with him, he didn’t care.
“Oh, Sherlock. You didn’t” He didn’t have to tell Mycroft. Mycroft always knew. “We are going to have to do some damage control here, Sherlock. We have worked so hard to build up your public persona. Worked so hard to repair the mess you created last time you got involved with someone. You know how lucky you are that your career even managed to take off after what happened.”
Sherlock pushed John's pants down before taking John in one hand and licking a stripe up the length of him, swirling his tongue around the top and then finally, finally taking him in his mouth.
Or if his gut reaction was right, and it was rarely wrong these days, it would turn his world upside down. He would be so deeply drawn in, so consumed and charmed by John and his dysfunctional, ordinary life that he wouldn’t be able to tear himself away.
"I try and maintain a safe distance from humanity. I draw away, never letting anyone in or close to me. I couldn't risk it. I developed a way to observe human behaviour and replicate it in my acting. I haven't ever really felt like the character I'm playing- I've never empathised, I can't bring myself to feel things too keenly. I’ve become really good at mimicking it. I can tell so much about a person from the smallest movements, my observations have got so accurate. You, for example, I could read military in the way you stood and held yourself. Your leg injury, clearly psychosomatic, you stood at the bookshelf for ages pondering books without even thinking about your leg. Psychosomatic implies you were injured under traumatic circumstances. Military man. There obviously must have been a real injury, because you are too young to retire so I assumed you had been invalidated out. The only thing I couldn't tell was whether you had been invalidated from Afghanistan or Iraq. The front I present to the public - it keeps me distant. I've proved already that when I fall in love I do it without any consideration for my self-preservation. It’s dangerous for me. But sex was always a means to an end and a way to show Jim that I loved him. I never enjoyed it, it's something I've avoided since then, I didn't see the point...I don't know why you are different. Sharing a bed, you saying that you wanted it not to be one-sided. You have to understand that is alien to me, I've never been in a scenario where the person I was with wanted me to enjoy it, cared just as much or more about that than their own pleasure. I knew Jim would be biding his time, waiting to make an impact with his story. He's the jealous type, he wants to be the only person to ever impact me that way. He gets a sense of ownership when it comes to me. I saw him recently, accidentally bumped into him at a party- he's still in the industry though hasn't quite broken through yet - I could tell that he knew I was pining over someone. He wanted to send a message to me that he still holds all the power over me. That he can make and break me in a matter of hours, if I don't want him then I can't have anyone. I know it was him that sold the stories to the papers. Only he has the photographic evidence that they published…. John, I understand if after everything I've told you if you never want to see me again. I'm repulsed by myself, so I can't expect you to feel any differently."
SLEAZY SHERLOCK HOLMES IN DRUG FUELLED GAY ROMPS
“No it doesn’t!”
“John… do you know what is in these boxes?”
John was having a hard time stringing a sentence together, but he managed to stammer out “and how do they look on me?”
What was wrong with him? He’d always prided himself on his ability to keep his emotions under control, not to fall pray to the cancer that struck down everyone in its path. Sentiment, he told himself, was a chemical defect found on the losing side. But there was something about this man, this otherwise ordinary man, that made him want to impale himself on his sword, to snatch the apple off the forbidden tree and bite into its juicy flesh. He mentally slapped himself for being so ridiculous, for succumbing to the mundaneness of everyday life.  This man could be the destruction of his career, he just couldn’t let that happen. He walked over to John, trying to act lofty and distant.
John smiled, picked up his walking stick that had been resting against the wall and hobbled over to the history section. He stood in front of the shelf for a moment, pondering the choices before picking out two volumes that might be of interest. He could feel Sherlock eyes following him across the room, his gaze felt like a red hot laser on his back.
“What would you have me do?” Sherlock whispered down the phone.
"Well as you know, I've never done this... well I have done this before... just never with a man."
John sighed deeply, he could feel the anger that had been so close to the surface the last month rising up within him, furious that Greg had betrayed him in this way.
‘I’m confused. Was it just for fun, then?’
They’re deep down in a case for next three days. Sherlock doesn’t think about the mail, and John doesn’t mention Mary, which Sherlock is grateful for. There is a chase through the London streets. The adrenaline is high like before everything went wrong. When they finally catch the murderer, Sherlock proposes a glass of whiskey back at Baker Street, but John can’t come, he promised Mary he would visit the doctor with her.
“Call Gavin, he’ll find him in Rosemary’s florist shop.”
“Which day is it?”
‘Sure’
“I’d like to see it.”
‘Thank you?’
‘No, I won’t. If you want me to go, just stop speaking.’
Mycroft rolls his eyes, ‘I promise you’ll like it.’
. Could John actually feel the same way about him?
‘I did. And I hope you’ll be smarter this time – he seems to be fond of you. Remember, brother mine, caring could sometimes be a big advantage.’
“Oh really? I don’t remember that. Have you examined the body, John? Can we go home?”
‘Well, yes. I think. Um…’, John pulled out a bunch of flowers from behind his back, ‘These are for you, Sherlock.’
But suddenly, John heard a heavy noise. He sped up a little. Then he saw him. Sherlock was lying on the pavement.
“Don’t worry, John. Thank you, Molly. Put it down on a table, please.”
‘I’m so relieved. Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I don’t know how you did it and why you didn’t tell me but everything is okay. It’s safe and that’s all that actually matters.’
‘Who was that man?’
Sherlock’s phone rings and saves John.
“I have to go, guys. I need to do something at work and then...” she blushes “I have a date.”
“Stay, please!” wakes him Sherlock from his mind.
“I think so. I suppose I have nothing broken. He just hit me with something.”
‘John, do you remember what you said in your last message?’
‘I did a lot of research, Mr. Hope, but I’m sorry to say I wasn’t able to locate it.’
“Yes, but I’m your idiot. Dinner?”
“Why? We’ve known each other for years. I doubt there is something what could surprise us.”
‘Once again, gentlemen, I’m very grateful to all of you.’ With these words, Mr. Hope stands and disappears into his office.
‘I’ve heard Greg brought you a few cold ones.’
Mycroft sighs; it’s always difficult with Sherlock. He’s so stubborn and rude to people, even to Greg. They had originally met in Sherlock’s apartment when Mycroft was visiting and Lestrade come by with a case.
“Many people also don’t like it.”
“Well, I should have been, but you didn’t answer your phone, and then Greg called me and said you hadn’t taken the case. I was worried. Aren’t you happy I am back?”
‘Is it really fine?’
‘You’ve shaved.’ Sherlock answers almost inaudibly and John laughs, but immediately realises they’re not alone and stops.
, and
“Probably since you shot that cabbie. But, I realized when I was away. I missed you terribly. And you?”
“No, no. Breakfast first. We have our whole lives for the other things.”
“Oh god, what happened? Are you alright?”
‘What do you want?’
“Stay here.”
He also wanted to end his life after Sherlock’s suicide. Mary saved him from doing
The gentleman leaves to go to his office and comes back with his document box. He opens it and goes through all of the sections again. ‘Oh my goodness!! I can’t believe it. It’s right here. Look!’
Sherlock wants to explain to him the flowers are for his Mum but Mycroft is here, demanding their quick departure. Gregson promises to stay in touch and keep Sherlock updated with his progress.
‘Tea?’
‘I don’t know who you’re talking about.’
“I know, sweetheart. This is the most stupid thing I’ve ever seen. Even John Watson from the show could never do this. He was always so protective of Sherlock.”
‘Nice to meet you, Mr. Holmes.’
“The sister doesn’t just appear out of nowhere, she even has the magical skills! She makes a dummy of Moriarty. Ha ha. Real Moriarty wouldn’t have let this happen. He was a criminal mastermind.”
“It’s quite weird, don’t you think?”
‘Not yet, why?’
Sherlock finally looks into his eyes. He doesn’t need his deduction skills to recognize an attraction in them. He clears his throat. ‘I’d love that. A lot.’
“Sherlock!! What about the suspect?”
“I’d love to show the whole world that I have the gorgeous detective as my husband. If you don’t have a problem with it.”
‘The interesting thing is he died because of your presence there. Anyway, the morning after your visit to my flat, you went back to his house, faked the nausea and got the document back. Am I right?’
‘I’m not allowed to tell you more, but if the document got to the wrong people, it could be dangerous for our country.’
So he does.
“Yes, yes. Drink the tea and rest a little. I’ll check you in a couple of hours.”
At Baker Street, Sherlock rushes into his room, not even looking at John.
‘This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, he’s my brother. He’s visiting one of my colleagues and helping with an important… issue.’
’Your deduction skills have been always good. Not as good as mine though.’
“How can a police officer even justify this? Now I understand what Lestrade was talking about.”
‘Detective Inspector Lestrade, but you are aware of his name. Don’t forget I know you very well, brother mine.’
“I’m watching Sherlock and I want to finish it. I don’t have time for your cases. You’ll have to solve this one without me, Graham. Bye!”
‘Okay, okay. You’re lucky I haven’t had a proper case for ages.’
‘You haven’t read the newspapers?’
“Just a little. And thank you for taking care of me by the way.”
‘What was it you didn’t tell me?’
“Of course, John, I’d be lost without my blogger.”
Sherlock keeps standing in the middle of his sitting room. ‘Come in, the door is open.’
There was a second stain on the floor, and to Sherlock’s delight the stains have the same shape. He smiles. ‘Who was on duty here?’
“I didn’t know what to say or how to say it, how to act on the feelings inside me. I lack  previous experiences in these things.”
‘Have you solved it?’
‘What are you telling me, John.?’
John always forgets about all his troubles when he’s with Sherlock. The detective deduces every person in the restaurant only to make John smile. It’s nice weather outside, so they decide for a walk after meal. He wishes to go inside with Sherlock, but he can’t. Not yet. When he comes home and lays next to his wife, he feels this is not right. This is not what he wants. He is prepared to change everything tomorrow.
The Holmes brothers look over everything without a word.
He can’t help himself and continues with ‘experimenting’. He doesn’t need to sleep and he is curious what else will be different. He’s so focused he ignores his phone ringing a few times.
John touches his cheek and Sherlock’s ears turn immediately pink.
Sherlock nods.
He turns his laptop on and goes through his emails to see if there is something interesting for him. But most of the supposed cases are dull. He would solve them without leaving a flat. One message, however, catches his attention.
“I told you I wasn’t a fan of this season.” Molly replies.
“Yes for watching, however sleeping is boring.”
“That sounds nice.”
‘Sherlock, I’ve come here to apologise and explain everything...’
“I think you need to find out by yourself. And that’s enough for now.” John turns the TV off.
‘I can imagine.’
‘I know I messed up. I was always trying to convince you that a relationship would be bad for you. But I’ve changed my mind a lot since I met Greg, and –’
‘John!’
“And it appears you don’t know who. Don’t forget I recognize when you lie to me.”
“Of course, I am. More than happy. Come here!” smiles Sherlock.
Sherlock feels he’s getting red. Fortunately (or not?), Miss Hope is back with the list.
“Are you suggesting anything better then?”
‘She confessed to everything. She said she came home and a young lady was talking with her husband. She thought the lady was his mistress and got jealous. They got into a fight and the young lady ran away. Mrs. Lucas was still mad, so she hit him with a vase and killed him. I know it’s boring for you, but I have something that could interest you. Can you see this blood stain? Well, the body was found here, not on the place where the stain is. We took the carpet away and look what we found there.’
‘I met poor Mr. Lucas at one of the parties around the town. We were talking, he was very nice to me. My friends warned me because, like they said, he wasn’t a good man. But I fancied him a lot. I wrote him a few love letters. He never wrote me back, and soon became quite cold towards me. I was desperate; however, when I found out he had a wife, I got angry and tried to forget him.’
“I’ve always wanted this.”
“Where are you? It’s getting exciting!”
“You’re awake.”
“Hey, boys!  I’ve brought you the things, you asked for, Sherlock.”
‘Poor you, my brother is horrible.’
John can’t hold himself anymore. He has to kiss that git. He leans in and lets Sherlock to make the final move. And then their mouths finally crash together. It’s better than he ever imagined. They stop only to take a breath, but stay close. John is smiling.
“Hey, wake up!!”
“What can there possibly be about a dog,that would make you dislike a show?”
‘Sure. But I want some answers first. And please, be honest with me. It’s important.’
“I know, darling. My apologies, I’m so exhausted from the flight now, I’ll take a shower and  go to sleep. We can watch the last season together tomorrow, if you’re amenable.”
‘I’ve searched it properly!’
‘I don’t want to hear anything more.’ He has to get away from this place. He feels betrayed.  He thought John was different to the others and now he isn’t even sure if his actual name is John.
‘Those flowers. Do you know who sent them to you?’
“Is it better now?”
‘Only my daughter, Hilda, and our maid. My wife died  five years ago. But the maid was free that evening, and my daughter was with her friends in the theatre when it happened, two days ago.’
The ambulance took them to the nearest hospital. Fortunately, no bone was broken, he had only a few bruises. The doctor was concerned about concussion though. But Sherlock was absolutely against staying for observation there.
‘Yes, why not.’
‘Then Mary appeared, and she saved me from the darkest of places. I was grateful. And I didn’t see any better solution than marrying her. Even when you came back, I still did it. I soon realised it was a mistake, but I wasn’t brave enough to do something.’
“Friday. Or maybe Saturday already?”
‘Hello Mr. Holmes… I mean Sherlock. I suppose your brother told you about my possible visit?’
‘It appears you’d do anything for my dear brother.’
‘You liked that? Everyone said it made me look older.’
‘What? You mean having a boyfriend? Of course,… it is fine.’
“What’s Twitter?”
John stands up and brings his face inches from Sherlock’s. After a few seconds, where they just share their breaths, he finally kisses him. It’s a slight touch of the lips at first but soon it becomes something more.
“But this. Us. You’ve never said anything.”
“Making tea doesn’t take so long, John!”
Back at Baker Street, he lies on the sofa and tries to forget about everything that has happened during last week. How could he believe him? He thought they may have been friends. Sherlock would even consider something more, but that wasn’t the point. Even though he deduced John, or whatever his name is, was bisexual, he couldn’t possibly have an interest in him.
“So, another one?”
“Okay, I’ll show you.”
“No. No. No. This isn’t possible!”
“Everyone makes mistakes. And I’m sure Greg will catch him.”
He turns his computer on as soon as he arrives back home. He needs to know everything about him. He isn’t sure what’s happening to him. He should pay attention to the document disappearance, but he seems not to be able to push the doctor out of his mind.
Yes, John is horrified, but from different reasons.
“You still don’t have a suspect? Really Gavin, your men are useless. Yes, yes I’ll be there in a few.”
“John! I’m here. I have him.” replied Sherlock from a distance.
‘Have I impressed the great Sherlock Holmes?’
“I’ve called the ambulance and now I’m calling him. Can you stand up?”
“Only reason, I’m not keeping you here over the night is that your friend is a doctor. He’ll keep an eye on you, Mr. Holmes.”
“You what?” Sherlock turns his attention to her.
“Is Molly really dating someone?”
“Sherlock Holmes is blushing. And I am the reason for it. Am I dreaming?”
Sherlock’s out of the office before the minister can say goodbye.
‘What? I hope you haven’t changed your mind!’
‘You still haven’t told me what document we are talking about.’
John gives up and goes to make them tea. A cuppa always helps.
‘Talking to the politicians isn’t easy, right?’
Mycroft says his goodbyes and turns to leave. But Sherlock is rooted to the spot. He’s drowning in those gorgeous eyes. He doesn’t know what to say or how to act, but John saves him.
“Can we watch the other episode? It’s supposed to be a special between seasons.”
The headsetted woman looked pointedly down at her watch and waved at Sherlock to follow her as she walked out the room.
Begrudgingly, he got up, worried about what he was going to say to her and opened the door to his flat. It wasn’t Mary that was standing next to Mrs Hudson, it was Sherlock. He was even more devastatingly handsome that he remembered even though he was scruffily dressed in tracksuit bottoms and an old t-shirt. His hair looked unwashed and stood up at the back and he was holding a large sports bag over his shoulder.
manager? Why would you get involved with anybody associated with that man. His brother? For fuck’s sake Greg” John spat.
“Twenty million dollars.”
“Twenty one actually. Are you still in your hotel room?” Mycroft asked casually.
Sherlock sat down while John went into the kitchen. He came back out holding two mugs in his hand, handing one over to Sherlock, their fingers brushed briefly as the cup was passed.
“Well… most of the books in those are from donations and a couple from my granddad’s collection. They are overflow from the bookshop to be honest. Haven’t had a chance to look at them properly.”
“How could you possibly know that I was a doctor?” John exclaimed, bewildered.
John opened his eyes, but didn’t move or speak, choosing to let Sherlock speak uninterrupted.
“Yes” Sherlock was caught off guard by John’s question. “’I’m supposed to be attending an industry party later.”
“I’m not sure red is your colour John” Sherlock muttered, his eyes lingering on the nail varnish on the coffee table.
Note that the rating has increased...
John looked guiltily down at Sherlock’s sodden and stained shirt and fumbled in his pocket for his keys to open the front door directly next to Speedy’s. He pushed it open with his good shoulder and heard Sherlock follow and close the door behind them. John climbed the stairs up to his flat, praying that his flatmate wasn’t in. He could see her now in his head, tilting her head back and roaring with laughter at his bad luck, how only he could manage to scald an A-list celebratory and ruin a shirt that probably cost more than he earnt in a month.
Finally, the lift door opened and they walked out the lift before their lips smashed together again and stumbled down the corridor blindly heading towards the hotel room. Sherlock pulled his key out of his pocket frantically and fumbled a bit with the door before managing to open it. He was now sucking gently at John’s neck and trying to kick his shoes off at the same time as they made their way through the door.
Something clicked in Sherlock’s chest. Fuck Mycroft and what he wanted.
“You want…. You mean you want to come with me?” John asked, surprised.
And then Sherlock suddenly realised. He was stupid not to have put two and two together from the moment he had arrived at Molly’s house. John had only ever slept with three people. This indicated that either John had been celibate longer than even he had been, or there had been a long term relationship that had broken up in bad circumstances. The latter seemed likely given the awkward silence that followed John’s unfinished sentence. Long term, most likely a marriage, John seemed the marrying type. Then there was the look on Molly’s face when she had opened the door to them. He had assumed at the time that the shock on her face was down to the fact that
John shook his head, thinking he must have imagined it and busied himself with taking his jacket off so he had an excuse to turn his back and hide the red that was surely flushing his cheeks.
“Alright Sherlock, I think we’re just about done here, you’ve got ten minutes and then we need you back for a short interview with the magazine.”
Greg looked gobsmacked. “That’s erm… that’s pretty good then, isn’t it?” He picked up his glass and gulped down half his wine.
The four of them came back into the room rosy cheeked with mischievous smiles and carrying plates of food. Even if he hadn’t overheard, their eyes all glancing over at Sherlock made it obvious they had been talking about him.
"Is this ok?" John asked as reached down to Sherlock's underwear, when Sherlock nodded he pulled them down and Sherlock kicked them off. John moved his hand between them and took them both in his spit slicked fist. This was new, having another man hard and smooth pressed up against him- it felt ridiculously good. Sherlock groaned and thrust up into John's hand as John picked up the pace, his were eyes closed, his black curls wild, a few strands stuck to his sweaty forehead - in that moment of complete lack of control, John thought he had never seen him look more beautiful. With his spare hand, John grabbed hold of Sherlock's hand and held it tightly. Their lips met again, not really kissing, just breathing heavily into each other's mouths. John slowed his hand down, adding a twist of his wrist as he reached the heads of their cocks- he has always liked it like that. John felt Sherlock suddenly tense and shudder before he spilt over John's hand. Sherlock rolled onto his back, while John used Sherlock's come as lube to finish himself off. It only took John a couple more strokes before he orgasmed too, making his vision go white and his body shake. Once he had come back to himself he picked up the discarded red pants and wiped down his hand and both of their stomachs.
“Well it was nice to see you John. Surreal… but nice.”
“I’ll walk you out. The front door can be a bit stiff and difficult to open sometimes” John put down his cup of tea. He heard the words leave his mouth before he had a chance to regulate them. “It was nice to meet you. Surreal… but nice.” John groaned inwardly at the stupidity and cheesiness of what he had just said. He saw Sherlock’s lips quirk up in a small smirk.
“I’m not, I’m really not. I am so pleased for you that you have found someone who makes you happy, I just might need some time to get used to the idea of you with his brother. Listen, you’re still in the honeymoon period by the look of it,” John nodded towards Greg’s neck “you should go and find him, make the most of it.”
"What?" John said, confused and still half asleep. "Tell who?"
“I get nightmares sometimes” Sherlock admitted, standing up and taking a miniscule step closer to John. “Might help if I have a bit of company.”
Greg perked up a bit, his conversation flowing a bit easier at the revelation. “Oh, good for you. I did a bit of acting in my school days before I joined the force”. Police officer then, senior most likely. Long hours would allow wife opportunity to carry on with an affair without much difficulty. “Have you been in anything I might of heard of? Soap operas, is it? Or are you a west-end type?”
“Oh my god John… How on earth did you pull Sherlock bloody Holmes?” Harry screeched.
“Well, I might see you around then…” his eyes flickered briefly down to the name on John’s lanyard, a naughty grin playing around his mouth “John”.
She groaned and shook her head, trying to lighten the mood. “Oh how do you know about that? That’s was over ages ago! Listen-” she put her hand on his thigh “I’m out with some girlfriends tonight, but it would be really nice to catch up over some dinner or something? My number’s still the same – text me.”  She kissed him lightly on his cheek and then ran off to her group of friends.
John leaned back in his armchair. This was so much to take in.
“I am so sorry” John repeated, following Sherlock as he backed out the shop onto the street. “I live literally just up there” He said pointing to the windows of the flat above the coffee shop. “I’m sure I have a spare shirt or something that you can have”.
“Listen Sherlock, I really don’t want to know about the details of your relationship.”
Sherlock smiled a bit at the good humour in John’s voice. Greg fumbled around pouring himself and Sherlock a glass of wine, the conversation they could overhear clearly making him awkward. He pressed on with his line of questioning to Sherlock doing his best to pretend they couldn’t hear every word from the four in the kitchen.
Sherlock opened his mouth, looking like he was going to object when John said quickly “I’ve tried but beauty sleep unfortunately doesn’t have much effect on me… I look this tired and grumpy wherever I sleep, the bed’s wasted on me. You take it.”
But it wasn’t just that, he was having a hard time believing this was real, he couldn’t bare his flatmate to be there and ruin the fantasy and bring him back down to earth by telling him this was all a dream. Didn’t want her reminding him that film stars didn’t go back to the houses of penniless nobodies like John.
“I’m surprised you haven’t already picked him up and tried to bribe him into silence.” The silence on the end of the line caught Sherlock by surprise. “Ooh. You already did do that, didn’t you?” He thought about it for a moment. “What happened?”
He had never heard Sherlock swear before, something about it caused the animal instinct in John to slide his fingers through Sherlock's hair and push his cock closer to Sherlock's face.
“Greg!” John actually started laughing, he hadn’t laughed for so long. It made his cheeks hurt. “Who is she?”
John suddenly felt ashamed at himself. From what he had heard from Clara, Greg had literally just signed the papers on his messy divorce and had finally found something that made him happy and he had said that he would sacrifice that to stop causing any further hurt to John. He felt selfish and pathetic. Greg was right, he had only known Sherlock for two days. It was just something about him that had drawn him in, made him feel things he hadn't since he had been a newlywed. He knew he should try and be a good friend to Greg.  He just couldn’t get past the fact that everyone was happy except for him. He supposed he’d always have Molly to fall back on when he needed a friend. She, like him, seemed to be eternally single. Maybe they'd end up being live-in friends who never had sex and had a bunch of cats. Most marriages turn out like that eventually anyway right? He wasn't missing out on anything. Greg’s phone beeped, he looked down at it and John noticed the small smile that Greg couldn’t hide in time. He straightened his face quickly when he looked up at John.
John couldn’t tell why Greg had sounded so defensive - the last thing he knew Greg was still mourning the loss of his marriage. He felt happy for him that he was finally getting some – about bloody time.
“Roommate?”  John thought he had heard a note of interest in his voice “Not girlfriend?”
“Greg. What on
John didn’t understand, it wasn’t like Sherlock to state the obvious. Sherlock leaned forward and kissed lightly just above the waistband.
“Well I don’t think it’s going to blister, it would have started to by now if it was going to.” John said quietly “I do think you should probably cool it down under some cold water for a while. Perhaps you should go and have a cold shower”
Sherlock yanked John’s hand and almost ran to the lift in the hotel lobby, pretty sure they had knocked several people flying in their haste. The lift up to the twelfth floor was unbearable, other people had got in with them on the ground floor and the lift was stopping at every floor. They stood there next to each other in the enclosed space, the tension radiating off them so strongly Sherlock was surprised you couldn’t see it in the air around them. It was excruciating, Sherlock felt as if he had a literal itch that he couldn’t wait to scratch.
He heard anger there, could see it bubbling under the surface on John’s face.
The light atmosphere suddenly tensed.
John tries to move on and Greg has some news.
Sherlock pulled off and looked up inquisitively. His lips were wet with saliva.
Feels like it's been ages since I've posted... Work has been crazy busy and I've had hardly any writing time. Due some holiday soon so will try and make some progress!
“I offered him a very persuasive sum of money in the hope that he might keep quiet about your… indiscretions.”
“Yes. John… I just wanted to say thank you for this evening. I actually had a good time.”
“Sherlock, listen- there’s a lot I have to get my head round. Let me order us a takeaway-”
After putting a now very drunk Greg into a cab and kissing Molly, Harry and Clara goodbye, Sherlock found himself walking with John in companionable silence. It was a nice change to be with someone who let him have time with his thoughts. Occasionally their hands brushed past each other as they walked.
“I never hypothesize without all the facts” Sherlock replied.
"That's a shame I like those pants." Sherlock mumbled.
“No you’re right” Sherlock paused and then added “Do you want to come up?”
“Ah yes, two bedroom flat, makes sense. The fact that he refused my money concerns me.  I suspect that he could be biding his time, waiting for the opportune moment to sell his story and make the biggest bang, so to speak. Sherlock, you know you can’t just go to a stranger’s house and within 30 minutes have your tongue down their throat.” Mycroft reprimanded.
