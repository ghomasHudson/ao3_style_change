She finally turned to face him head on, a determined look on her face. “Yeah, okay. I can help you. Come on, you and I need to talk over our options.” She stood and waited for Cas to follow her. As they were walking, she suddenly turned and stuck out her hand. “Sorry, I forgot – I’m Charlie.”
Claire was enjoying breakfast with the Winchester family – again, there was plenty of food and cheerful conversation, Kaia was finally starting to open up again, they were going to start over at a new school…she started to let herself hope.
He and Dean were soon thick as thieves. He was the reason Dean at least tried ice skating, even if said try went *horribly* – ending with Dean sprawled out on the ice, soaking wet, and having been in danger of losing his fingers a couple times. Instead, Lee introduced Dean to street hockey between his continued shifts at the garage (which Dean quickly picked up and enjoyed playing), and soon Lee was stopping by after hockey practice – sometimes for games, sometimes just to hang out.
Cas just stared at him. “No way.”
Sammy was happy, and Cas was too after Dean checked in a little more nervously. Good, they were good. Which meant that, even though he felt a little guilty about it, Dean hightailed it back downstairs to talk to Bobby.
“I know, I know, and – ”
“Technically the term is asexual,” Cas explained as he fought a smile, “but arguably that is one way to describe asexuality, yes.”
“Ouch!” She mimed getting stabbed in the chest. “Right in the heart!”
Mary and Irene exchanged glances before Mary turned back to Dean. “And you’re sure you won’t get bored seeing them again?”
She grinned at him. “Thanks, Cas! Now, here’s what I’m thinking…”
She sighed. “I do, I do. You’ll…you’ll make sure she’s safe?”
He was interrupted by banging on the bathroom door. Cas fumbled open the lock, to see Sam’s grouchy face. “Cas, what the hell were you doing in there at this hour?”
Cas flushed a deep red and swatted at him. “Shameless flatterer,” he groaned.
Dean stood up a little straighter. “I – I know you’ve already met Cas, but. This time I wanted you to meet him as – as my boyfriend.”
Sam smirked. “Bet you can’t beat his score.”
Dean shook his head, frustrated with his stupidly optimistic heart. He was lucky enough to be Cas’ friend; it was time to bury his feelings as deep as he could and just be happy with what he had.
Sammy, the little shit, thought that was the funniest thing he had ever heard.
(It was entirely Cas’ fault that Dean developed a bubble tea addiction after that. Sam and his mom followed not long after, and even if his dad teased the rest of them about their habit, he drank his fair share as well.)
Cas just sighed. “How much longer were you going to ignore me without her intervention?”
Cas clambered out of his desk, and gestured for Dean to do the same. After Dean had obeyed, the slighter shorter man held out his arms in invitation, and Dean – Dean was going to just give Cas a brief hug, but…he hadn’t realized how bad he needed one until he started practically melting into Cas’ embrace. Cas made soothing noises as Dean tightened his grip and buried his head into Cas’ shoulder. This…this was nice. Dean definitely wanted to do this again, as many times as Cas would let him.
After dinner, while Dean was helping Bobby and Mary clean up, Cas pulled Sam aside. “Is everything okay?” he whispered.
Bobby knew Sam was coming over that night, since Mary was having one of her girl’s night things and she always asked Bobby if he’d be willing to take her boy(s). After years of saying yes to Mary’s questioning phone calls, Bobby had taken to just grunting “You know I will” into the phone after seeing her name on the caller ID. (That habit had committed him to a number of other unpleasant things over the years, but having the boys over was always worth it.)
When he did, he saw he had a text from Sam: ‘Cas just asked me about the box you have under your bed. I have a strong suspicion about what’s inside, please please please do not make me explain to YOUR BOYFRIEND about your…collection. Please.’
Dean ran a hand through his hair. “It just – it was something I was keeping to myself for a while. No one knows yet outside of Cornell, Cas – not Sammy, not Mom, not anyone. You’re the first one here I’ve told. You’re the one I wanted to tell the most, but…I wasn’t sure how you’d react.”
Cas cleared his throat. “Right. So. Obviously, we’re both interested in your wearing panties – I figured I’d use that as a bit of a starting point, and see what else people with…similar interests also like.”
“I – um. This should not be this hard,” Sam whispered to himself before straightening his shoulders. “Okay. Dean is bi, because he’s attracted to multiple genders. Straight, gay and lesbian people are attracted to one gender. But…there’s also people who aren’t attracted to anyone.”
“Hi!” Sam greeted brightly. “I’m Sam.”
Dean nodded slowly, thinking through what his mom had said. “He…already knows a lot about me,” he started slowly, “but…I guess I haven’t asked some of the questions I should. He may not know…that I want to know.”
Mary nodded in agreement and the two women followed after their boys.
He went to the cast afterparty, getting to know some of the actors behind the characters a little better. He even saw Lee getting a *very* friendly hug from Seaweed and Penny’s actors – Jake Talley he recognized, but he wasn’t so sure about the girl; Alice something, maybe? He silently toasted them and wished them luck.
“I mean I’ve been there. I was thinking about asking out a couple of other people in the play before I figured out they were dating each other. I…might not have been as subtle as I thought, and they suggested maybe trying to date both of them – or, I guess, all three of us together. We’re still…talking it out, but…yeah.”
…Or maybe he would regret it later.
Dean squirmed. “Well, I mean, I…I liked to before Lee, but…” He waved a hand at the box. “These are all the ones he got for me.”
He heard Dean’s embarrassed cough, but kept his eyes on the prize in his hands.
Oh really.
Cas put down the mugs of tea and bowled Dean over in a hug.
Ellen hmphed. “Guess I can’t ask for more than that.”
“Really?” Dean asked lightly – too lightly.
Claire blushed before squaring her shoulders and nodding. “Yeah. Another date,” she replied.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, mind starting to whir through some pretty horrible possibilities.
Mary smiled at her. “You’re a good friend, honey.”
“Castiel, why is Holy Spirit calling us and asking about our daughter transferring to a public high school?” his aunt rapped out – but Cas could hear the fear underneath it.
While Dean was in the middle of packing, John knocked on his door. “You got a minute?”
Claire waited for Cassie to drink a couple cups of coffee and eat some of the food Dean had placed in front of him before asking, “So, Cassie. Did Uncle Zach call you today?”
“Son, I know you had planned to spend Christmas with your cousin, but – spending your time with this entire other family? Neglecting the Lord on his birthday? Why?” Zachariah asked.
Dean nodded slowly.
Charlie hummed noncommittally. “I feel like the problem was that you were too good of a boyfriend, just to the wrong person.”
So Charlie and Cas met up at Cas’ usual library study spot (Cas knew Dean would avoid it like the plague if he was avoiding Cas, no need to worry about their plotting being discovered) and they started brainstorming. Most of Charlie’s ideas were too outlandish, in Cas’ opinion; they mostly involved locking doors and trapping Dean. Cas did remember what Charlie had threatened at the D&D session, but he also remembered how angry Dean had been at being cornered; it didn’t seem the best tactic, even if it probably would be effective once Dean stopped being angry.
Claire’s phone buzzed and she saved the contact. “Done,” she smiled. “I’ll let you know how far I get tonight.”
It was almost like Cas was a dirty secret he was hiding from everyone besides Sam, which wasn’t true, or at least, shouldn’t have been, but every time he tried to talk to Charlie about Cas...the words just wouldn’t come out. His time spent with Cas was still something only he and his brother knew, even if Dean’s entire friend group was starting to suspect and/or tease that Dean was secretly dating someone. (Which...of course Dean wasn’t. That would be crazy. No matter how cute, and smart, and funny, and amazing Dean found Cas...no.)
Bobby snorted. “Boy has a one-track mind, has ever since he was little. Sorry that he decided to focus on you – ”
But even so, there was a goal to be achieved, and while violence was often used to achieve progress towards that goal – well, there was in RISK as well. Supernatural and roleplaying elements aside, there wasn’t enough difference in the two games to justify his father’s deep-seated hatred for one and love of the other – D&D was nowhere near the “devil worship” that his father ranted about.
Bobby just chuckled. “Maybe you’re just too young to see it, kid,” he started, ruffling Sam’s mop of hair, “but Dean is looking at Cas almost exactly the way he looked at Lee. If your brother isn’t nursing some sort of feelings for Cas, I’ll eat my hat.”
Dean snorted, he couldn’t help himself. “We’re in college, dude. It’s not like I was going to be proposing in the next couple days or anything.”
“Sammy’s the best.”
Bobby looked up at the ceiling as he thought. “When was early summer after senior year, boy was mopey enough, but as to why or how…I got no clue.”
“But Castiel – ”
“I guess I kinda deserved that.” He sighed. “Look, honest truth? My little brother, he figured out he was ace recently, but he’s a sophomore in high school and...it’s been rough for him. I just...you're the only other ace person I know, and I thought...I thought you might be able to help him. You know, if you don't mind, of course." Dean finished quickly.
After the movie ended (sadly, Cas admitted, but Dean soothed his worries by promising that Cap found more equilibrium over the next couple movies), Sam yawned and headed off to bed; Dean started to do the same, dragging Cas to the stairs along with him, until Mary poked her head out of the kitchen. “You boys better not get up to anything up there,” she warned, “I don’t want to be hearing anything tonight. Neither do Bobby and Sam.”
Dean gave advice mostly on autopilot, vaguely registering Sammy’s happy tone at the conclusion of their conversation and that he must have done a good job; but most of his brain was processing that ace people did date. Maybe…maybe he and Cas weren’t quite as bad of an idea as he had originally thought?
what’s this i hear about you joining the musical??
Finally, on the last day of school, one of the guys got Lee in a headlock and wouldn’t let him out until he told them *something.*
“Exactly. Dirty pool or not, it’s time. Sam has been trying to get you to talk to either me or him since we left, but he can’t do much to convince you from where he is. And you do need to talk, Dean, no matter what you think – Sam believes that it’s been eating you up inside, and Charlie has definitely noticed something is going on. Just…please? I just want to help you, Dean.”
“Oh my god, Mom, I was just here last weekend – but fine,” Dean grumped as he backtracked.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” she laughed as he picked up the phone. “Just give me a minute.”
Cas stared at his boyfriend, realizing exactly what had been coming out of his mouth and cringed. Slowly, he walked to where Dean was now crouching, and sat down cross-legged. “I’m sorry,” he apologized softly, “I think I may have overstepped a bit.”
“So,” Dean continued, deciding to change the subject before Claire got any more ideas, “don’t suppose you’d be willing to tell us why you two are here and not home?”
Cas placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Coming out is scary, especially to people you love and are afraid to lose. They don’t know about me, either – and the idea of telling them is…frightening,” Cas admitted. “Maybe…maybe I could come out to them first, see how they react?” he mused.
Mills glanced at Bobby. “Admittedly, I was surprised to hear that you two ended up here, of all places,” she slowly replied.
“Right,” Cas had replied quietly, “right. I, uh, I should go. But - I’ll see you soon?”
“A little,” Dean admitted slowly. “Mostly that the idea of us dating got such a firm no.”
Donna gasped. “Dean Winchester, do you have a crush on your understudy??”
i already have a pretty good idea of links lines and songs and stuff
Dean was entranced with the Roadhouse’s newest regular, Cas.
Then Cas had to keep talking. “I think they’d look even better on you.”
“She is.”
[middle finger emoji]
Claire ducked her head, and sighed in relief when the rest of the introductions started back up. When she did finally stop doodling on some scrap paper and looked up, Krissy was looking at her. They nodded and smiled, and Claire smiled back.
Mary would always check in with him after she finished in a room, ready to head to the concourse whenever Dean lost interest in the galleries, but Dean continually shook his head and said he wanted to see more. He lasted for almost the entire first floor before finally starting to show signs of boredom, and even then it took another few exhibits on the second floor before Mary’s question was met with upraised hands and a request to see the lights. Mary was quick to pick her son up and start walking towards the concourse as promised.
So Cas and Sam ran upstairs, texting Dean the all clear and deciding to pass the time until his return playing (and learning, in Cas’ case) some card games.
And after a couple months...it wasn’t that Dean and Cas (he had finally allowed the nickname after a couple weeks) weren’t friends. They spent a lot of time together, had inside jokes, were starting to learn quite a bit about each other – but...they also didn’t spend much time together with other people. It was always just them and whatever movie or TV show Dean had decided was next. Sometimes they brought food, but they never ate together in the cafeteria or hung out at GSA meetings; Dean never invited Cas to play D&D with Charlie’s group, as much as he was starting to suspect that Cas would love it.
“You must be really proud of him...”
But before he could decide, Dean’s phone chimed with a text from Lee Webb – a decent friend, even if they had fallen somewhat off of each other’s radars when Lee left the baseball team.
But then, during one of his library study sessions, Castiel noticed there was somebody hovering in his general area. He looked up to see – Dean? How – ?
Not that he would *ever* say it that way himself, but his asshole little brother wouldn’t stop saying it like that. And it wasn’t nearly that sappy.
oh? whats it like then?
Kaia sighed. “Well, it’s not like I have much waiting for me here. Where’s your cousin?”
Cas jumped at his abrupt inclusion in the conversation. “Uh, lunch tomorrow would be fine, if that works for your schedule, Dean?”
“Hey, Cassie,” came her exhausted-sounding reply.
Lee ran a hand through his hair, sighing. “I know, I know. I just – your friend Cas? Don’t know if you pay attention too much when you talk about him, but…sometimes you sound like you’re – well. Like you’re in love with him. And as great as you’ve been with me…I don’t think it’s love for you. Not really, not the same way it is for this guy. And I…I don’t deserve feeling like second-best for the rest of this relationship.”
And as he got up to help Charlie wrangle all her dice and set-up, Charlie frowned. “Hard to do it by yourself – DEAN! Dean, why don’t you come over here and help Cas, make sure he doesn’t pack anything wrong, ‘kay?”
Cas shrugged. “Here in town, maybe. But you could attract out-of-towners much more easily with a proper web presence.”
(Donna watched him go, frowning. Obviously, Dean would need a reality check – but who from? She’d have to think about that – but later.)
Dean could always tell when his anxiety was starting to get out of hand and distracted him with a movie night, or an evening out with Charlie to discuss character ideas for the next D&D campaign. Cas always made sure Dean knew how grateful he was for the quiet intervention afterwards.
“Shut up, jerk! This is not why I called,” Sammy growled back.
“Have it your way,” Cas shrugged and headed up to the front to order; Dean following close behind.
At that, Lee let out a moan of his own and stopped Dean’s grinding to yank Dean’s jeans down and spin Dean to face him. “Did my good girl secretly wear her panties all day long at school?” Lee panted out, attacking Dean’s mouth before he could answer.
Dean immediately snapped to attention. “Sammy, are you okay?”
“I *knew* Cas was hiding something!” Sam yelped triumphantly, before going quiet. “But Dean, Cas is – Cas is so happy, even if he wouldn’t tell me why; I can tell. And I know *you’re* pretty happy too, otherwise you’d never even think about doing this, so…Dean, what are you so nervous about?”
Dean felt Cas (gently, so gently) cup his face and turn it to face his grave expression. “Dean Winchester. Based on what you have told me about the situation with…with Lee,” Cas paused before spitting out the name and then barreled on, “absolutely *none* of that was your fault. He was the only one who was at fault. He took advantage of you in your grief and disappeared without any warning, breaking your heart and destroying the progress you had made – Dean. You cannot possibly think that his leaving was your fault.”
When she finally sent the apologetic text, Dean grumbled to himself. “Damn. What do I do now?”
Claire bit her lip. “And…just for a little while…you promise you won’t tell anyone where we are?”
…But as he suspected, his silence was enough of an answer for Cas, as he felt Cas’ hands leave his face. This was it, this was going to be the moment Cas finally –
Midway into the semester, Dean had set up a date in the DC area; the girl swore by some fancy restaurant nearby a park, and Dean had winced a little at the prices but agreed. Except then some family emergency had come up and she had to call it off – but not until he was already at the restaurant and wondering where the hell she was.
“How intense?” Bobby interrupted.
“Just because you can’t roll as well as I can doesn’t mean I’m cheating,” Dorothy shot back with a smirk.
“Got into it recently? So you’re not done? And – manga, first anime or second one?”
Donna hesitated before speaking, but finally sighed. “Dean. I’m sorry, but I really can’t. I need the choreo practice time myself. And it won’t be that much weirder practicing with Castiel – you two have been getting along, right?”
“I won’t be able to sleep if I’m worrying about you, so you damn well better not forget to text me when you’re back in your dorm,” Castiel snapped before motioning for the phone again.
And after hearing that, how could Cas not go?
Cas paused as he thought. “The only one I can think of had a bunch of colored squares and fake money...and something to do with business?”
“Don’t even worry about it, Cas, those two are welcome to stay as long as they need to, no need for alternate accommodations – you’re family, so they’re family,” Mary finished sternly, pointing a spatula threateningly in his direction.
…Meaning the next chance Dean created. He went grocery shopping with Mary that afternoon, claiming that she wasn’t getting enough snacks for movie night – or was it the right snacks? In any case, he got Mary out of the house and promised to text them at the start of the return trip.
“Castiel, may I speak to you for a moment?” came the stern request.
He stuck close to Cas during art class – he didn’t really know anyone else (aside from the vague recognition of other people who he’d gone to school with for years but never really interacted with) and that was a bit of a first for him. Cas introduced him to a couple of other students – Anna and Inias – and Dean soon became friendly enough with them, quickly followed by others in the class. And while Dean wouldn’t say that he made the best of friends in his art classes, at least he didn’t feel like such an outsider when he wasn’t glued to Cas anymore.
“Whether or not that is true isn’t the point, Castiel,” Zachariah hissed menacingly. “The *point* is why you lied to me, decided to spend your holiday, the holiday that should be spent in prayer, with these – these random people!”
Castiel’s smile softened. “After the play then, Dean. I promise we’ll talk then, and I promise we’re good now.”
“Claire. Kaia. You girls want to tell me anything?”
“Nope,” Dean replied as he locked the car doors.
Cas grinned darkly. “I don’t need luck when I have determination. Thank you for your help, I may text you for Dean-wrangling tips later,” he waved Sam off distractedly, already composing his first text.
And then, it was time for Charlie’s bi-weekly D&D session – and Dean was so very ready to be someone else, even if it was only for a few hours. He was going to get to escape thoughts about Cas, if only for a little while.
He wiggled closer, hands outstretched, until his fingers went from barely brushing the object to firmly grasping it and dragging it out. It was a box, a white one, that sounded full of…something when he shook it, but still had very little weight.
“True,” Dean chuckled. “Alright, let’s go get something to eat.”
“I was just wondering…whether Aunt Amelia knows that you’ve been hiding that in the back of your closet,” Cas replied delicately.
“G’night Castiel!” Dean responded before going on his way.
Dean felt the tension start to leave his body as the familiar bedroom came on screen. He focused on watching the movie and enjoying Cas’ reactions; he knew Cas would love this movie, and he was so glad he got to share it with him.
Growling again, great, that shut Dean up for way too long, but he finally got himself together again long enough to drop his hands and get a look at Cas. “Please stop – saying stuff! I don’t – ”
“I – I don’t think it is either, Dean, but you have to admit – ”  Sam started before Dean couldn’t stand to hear any more.
“Claire, I swear, I didn’t tell him – ” her cousin pleaded before she interrupted.
Cas turned to face him, frowning. “Didn’t you say that you had a date today?”
“Um. The idea of Cas dating is…terrifying. Because I know that whoever Cas decides to date is going to be amazing, so much better than I could ever be, and…I don’t want to get in the way of Cas finding that person, I really don’t. I’m okay with being left behind – ”
Cas patted him softly on the shoulder.
“I don’t think you staying in my dorm room would be acceptable to either the school or my roommate,” Cas gently cut her off, “but one of my friends happens to have family in the area; I’m sure they could clear out a room for you.”
“And to think that my own son refuses to hug me,” she wailed melodramatically into Cas’ shoulder as Dean tried to pass by her.
Cas frowned, and Dean immediately barreled on. “Not that you owe me, that there’s some equivalent exchange thing – I told you mine, now you have to tell me yours – but. I just…I want to know so I don’t hurt you accidentally. I want to help you the way you helped me,” Dean continued almost helplessly. “Just…promise me you’ll think about it?”
Cas shook his head rapidly. “Yes, definitely different rooms, you distraction you,” he replied, flapping his hands in Dean’s general direction. “Now shoo.”
Cas went without protest. He had a lot to think about, and a lot of time to figure out what to do with the information that had fallen in his lap.
“That – that is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard!” he finally burst out.
“So, you two – freaking – Sam bet against me telling you??” Dean finally spluttered.
Cas frowned. “When did I tell you that?”
Dean just raised an eyebrow. “Nope. Why?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Actually, yeah. My mom’s been taking me here since I was pretty little.” He smiled as he remembered. “In fact, my absolute favorite from back then is still down there, if you want to – “
Dean would be fine, Cas would find his datemate and then they would all be happy.
Dean heard Cas make a sound behind him and made a slashing motion in his general direction; if he didn’t get this out now, he never would.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand closest to him and squeezed. “This is so awesome, Cas!”
His father hummed. “And she’s safe, right now?”
Cas just shrugged. “You were enjoying yourself, and I was fine. I didn’t want to interrupt. But…” he glanced at Mary. “…I do remember that the gift shop is stocked with Arcimboldo prints, if you want to be able to enjoy his work outside of the museum?”
But when he got into Sam’s room, he wasn’t there. Dean hung around for a few minutes, waiting for his brother to reappear, but when he didn’t, Dean just sighed and sat down at Sam’s desk. He pulled out his phone and started halfheartedly doing some research, figuring that Sam would show up at some point. But before he knew it, Dean was much farther down the rabbit hole than he had intended, and jumped when Sam suddenly asked from behind him, “What’re you doing?”
“I’m fine,” Claire replied gruffly. “Now go cuddle your boyfriend, you rebel.”
Cas snorted.
Dean took a deep breath.
Dean didn’t respond, but he did plop down on the floor next to where Cas was standing, and didn’t move when Cas slowly sat down.
Dean Winchester was not looking forward to attending his first GSA meeting. But he had promised both Sammy, his pain-in-the-ass-“it’ll-be-good-for-you-Dean” little brother, and Charlie, his crazy and amazing new friend from the engineering department. Charlie had been president of her high school’s GSA, so she was excited; Dean, on the other hand, had only recently come out of the closet – if it even counted if you were only out to your brother, one friend and an ex?
“I just…” Sam sighed. “It’s really nice that you and Dean don’t have to hide your relationship, that Dean doesn’t have to hide who he is. And I guess…I’m wondering if it’s time for me to do the same.”
“That is a lie, I can’t help it if I roll really well,” Dean retorted as he set up the board – red in front of Sammy, blue in front of him, and yellow in front of Cas. Sam started to explain the rules, but pretty soon Cas started frowning in confusion.
When they arrived at the house, laden with groceries, Bobby was alone in the kitchen. He didn’t seem upset or deep in his own thoughts, so Dean was guessing that everything went well. Good. He got more confirmation when he checked his phone – he had missed a text from Sammy that gave the all-clear for their return, so it had definitely happened, even if Sammy didn’t say how the talk went one way or the other.
But he was not left to stew for long; his mom came in laden with groceries pretty soon after Cas’ fifth win. Dean and Sam both raced over to help her; Sam took the lion’s share of the bags as Dean got an extra-long hug and a whispered reminder that she loved him, no matter what. Dean squeezed her back before taking a fairer share of the grocery bags and running back into the kitchen to unpack them.
At first, Dean seemed surprised by Cas’ sudden touchiness – which, to be fair, Cas was not usually one to initiate physical contact, since so many took it to mean something far different than he intended. But…this was Dean. Dean wasn’t interested in Cas, he wouldn’t take it the wrong way, so Cas was happy to open his personal boundaries to include one Dean Winchester.
Sammy was getting more and more insistent that Dean should say something to Cas about his feelings, that Cas kept coming back for a reason - and it wasn’t the food.
Dean squirmed at the sudden onslaught of memories. “Well, I mean, I…I liked to before Lee, but…” He waved a hand at the box. “These are all the ones he got for me.”
Claire sighed. “Apparently, it was. The sheriff was here earlier.”
“Shit, Sammy, no, I – I’m sorry. Just...did you know that Bobby knew about me and Lee?”
Cas bit his lip. Had he done something? Said something? Maybe –
“But Deeeeeean – without Link, there’s no play!” Donna clasped her hands together. “And I’ve wanted to play this part since the first time I saw it, Dean, please please please?” she begged, eyes wide and glistening.
Donna beamed at Jody when she caught on. “Thank yoooou,” she sang as she scooped some up.
Dean frowned. “Why did you call? I thought ace people weren’t interested in dating.”
And where was Dean? Bobby had pulled him aside and was trying to humiliate him to death with one simple question. “You two boys are being safe, right?”
“What’re little brothers for?” Sammy replied with a shit-eating grin so potent Dean swore he could hear it through the phone. “Hey, wait, don’t – ”  Sam hung up. “…say anything weird to Bobby,” Dean finished weakly. Sam probably wouldn’t do or say anything too bad…or at least that was the lie Dean was sticking with until he could question (and properly punish) Sam in person.
The two met on the front steps, Dean sweeping Cas into a bear hug the second he was in reach. “I missed you,” he murmured quietly into Cas’ shoulder.
Someone Castiel assumed to be the head of the club called everyone to attention before he and Meg could continue their conversation. “Alright all, welcome to the first Gender and Sexuality Alliance meeting of the year – although you’re far more likely to hear us call it the GSA. My name is Wren, I go by they/them pronouns. We’ve got a big group this time, so we’re going to start by going around and introducing ourselves – let’s start with name, year, pronouns, major and orientation, if you feel comfortable telling us. No pressure either way. Let’s start with you, to my right.”
“So between that, grieving Dad and recovering from Lee’s bullshit, I…I took a gap year. Worked at Bobby’s garage, tried to figure out what my future should look like…and finally decided I liked working with cars enough to make it a career, and I knew I wanted to stay close to home, so – here I am. Still healing, I guess, if Bobby mentioning Lee was able to make me tailspin like that.”
Bobby grunted. “Depends how well Cas handles it.”
He immediately wondered what it would be like, to see Dean wearing underwear the color of his eyes – and the mental image caused a wave of heat to sweep through him. That…that would be a sight.
“Right,” Dean replied a little breathlessly, licking his lips.
Then he put his head in his hands. That was dumb, now Sam was going to be all suspicious, but…he just couldn’t handle the tiny hope Sam was starting to give him. He wasn’t going to fall for it again, dammit; dating male friends led to nothing but trouble, and adding Cas’ asexuality into the mix was not going to help.
“Bubble tea. Try it, and if you really hate it I’ll finish it, but I doubt that will be the case,” Cas said smugly as he placed the cup in front of Dean.
“My friend told me about the koi pond down here,” Cas told Dean quietly. “It’s a lovely touch.”
Cas didn’t answer, turning to Sammy instead, who took a deep breath, before hesitantly confessing, “I…I think it’s time I came out to Mom and Bobby.”
Dean bit his lip. “Cas, how would you feel about going out on a date? You and me?”
Dean thought his skin was going to catch fire, his face was so hot. “I – you can’t – you can’t just stay stuff like that, Cas!” Dean responded (not squeaked, of course not).
“That was very thoughtful of him,” Cas smiled as he emerged from his second cup of coffee. “I’ll have to thank him later.”
That sounded more like it. “It’s not…it’s not a problem, exactly,” Dean hedged.
“If you had asked me, I would have told you that,” Bobby added gruffly. The sheriff turned to glare at him.
Dean had suggested, in order to save himself some stress, that he and Cas meet at the Galleries; giving him some extra Cas-free time to steel himself to say what he needed to say.
Claire wrinkled her nose. “And you two will be…decent?”
“If you insist,” Cas replied.
So he decided to enlist Sam’s help.
“I…wh-why wouldn’t I?” Dean stuttered.
“I think that’s a wonderful idea,” Mary agreed, opening her own phone. “Here, give me yours…”
Then Cas mentioned…dating. And if Cas was thinking about dating, something Dean hadn’t even considered somehow…Cas was going to be touching someone else. Cas was going to be touching someone else like this, not Dean, and so Dean…Dean had to start learning to live without Cas’ constant touches.
His brother was (predictably) horrified that Dean had basically stalked Castiel, even as he thanked Dean for finding him someone to talk to. ‘Not that talking to Dean wasn’t helpful and great,’ he quickly added in another text, ‘but...it would help to talk to someone who got it.’
While he gave Cas some looks at first, Dean soon adjusted to the new normal and started initiating his own platonic touches, to the point that even in public, the two were almost constantly touching.
Sam stared at him suspiciously. “…Do I want to know why?”
“Serves you right, you wanted Cas to play, and now he’s broken your oh-so-great winning streak – Cas, you are more than welcome to play anytime. Anytime,” Sam smirked.
Mary quickly swept him into a bone-cracking hug. “Maybe so, but as your mother, I have the right to request hugs. I carried you for nine months, kiddo, not to mention – ”
“Dean, your favorite customer’s here!”
And it shattered what was left of his heart.
Then his eyes landed on Cas, in the corner talking with Rowena about – something, and his legs started moving without his permission. “Hey, Cas.”
“Dean?”
“Okay, I can see you working yourself up from here,” Sam interrupted, “and you shouldn’t be. Dean can be weird sometimes, just – let’s play something else.” Sam looked around before lighting up. “Oooh, Boggle! I forgot about Boggle, no one else in the house will play with me anymore – and it’s easy, come on!”
“Mother, enough. I am his father, and – ”
Dean sucked in a breath. Right after high school ended? But –
The next morning, while Dean was occupied helping Bobby make bacon (“the most important breakfast food, Cas!”), Cas sidled up to Sam.
“Of course!” Dean snapped. “I’m the fuck-up, I’m the reason people leave or – or I push them away, it’s…it’s always my fault, and I don’t want to do that to you, Cas, but I don’t know how to not!”
Cas shook his head.
His expression must have been worse than he expected, because Cas immediately looked worried. “Dean? Are you okay?”
Bobby squinted at him for a second before sighing. “Fair enough. Still, had to buy ‘em, so you have to take ‘em.”
They were two guy friends who just…happened to enjoy each other’s…touch. Oh god that sounded dirty, but...it just felt so good – and oh no that just made it worse.
“No,” Dean interrupted, “don’t feel bad. It’s not – I should tell you, now. I probably shouldn’t have buried it for so long as it is.” He went quiet for a minute. “I, uh. You remember Lee?”
In the car, Dean closed his eyes and let the memories wash over him.
The blue was almost the same color as Cas’ eyes, and Dean felt warm all over as he imagined wearing them for Cas, and he let out an embarrassed cough.
And Cas had to admit, it was a fantastic movie. He chuckled at all the jokes, gasped at the dramatic reveals, sighed at the romantic moments…it was the perfect movie to get his mind off of Dean’s mystery.
“You would say that this is a beautiful work, right?”
It became a pattern, Lee dragging him into corners and kissing him senseless, but neither boy ever really talked about it. It just kept happening.
“And why do you say so?” came Cas’ smug reply as Dean felt himself back into a wall. His brain whited out a bit at the realization that Cas had trapped him, and when he could think again, all he could think to say was – “Cas, please.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Ah, so you’re taking something I told someone I thought was stalking me as entirely truthful?”
They quickly settled with Cas and Sam, talking about their past years. “Yeah, Mom doesn’t like that I haven’t even looked at colleges, but – I’ve been running the Roadhouse with her! I don’t need to waste time and money on some fancy-ass degree when I’m already getting the experience I *really* need, right?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Remember when we were talking outside the library?”
Bobby was right, as much as Dean hated to admit it. Better to talk to Cas now, get it all out and – well, see what Cas thought about it all. Dean just had to force himself to say everything he wanted to say…and maybe ask Cas not to say anything until he had forced out everything he wanted to say. Yeah.
Bobby saw Dean’s slight nod out of the corner of his eye, so he stepped out of Mary’s way, turning to watch what happened next. She ran right up to the boys, only paused for a slight frown at their clasped hands before throwing her arms around both of them. “But seriously, what brings you both down here?”
But Dean was abruptly jerked out of his train of thought when Bobby called them down to dinner. Immediately, Dean yanked the panties out of Cas’ hands, shoved them in the box and the box under his bed and dragged Cas downstairs.
“I will,” Claire promised.
Sam looked as confused as Cas. “That…was definitely weird.”
“Basically – it looks like you have submissive tendencies, and I’ve got dominant ones. And everyone seems to have different ideas of what that means…” Cas paused. “Which sounds like we get to decide what it means to us.”
Bobby smirked at the girls and Sam behind both women’s backs as Mary immediately folded. “No, no, you came all the way out here, you should have something to eat.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “In any case, I can’t imagine you two having any trouble while you’re there.”
…Well, Cas hadn’t been all that interested in knowing, but now that it was so firmly denied he was burning with curiosity. But he could bide his time until tomorrow, when he could ask Sam. For now, he was willing to let Dean put an end to that conversation.
“Cassie wouldn’t have told,” Claire gritted out, eyes starting to burn. No way Cassie would have sold her out, he never had before –
“Yes, yes, you showed me,” Castiel waved a hand absentmindedly at Dean as he thought. “We have some time before the play, so I think first up is making sure you have the lines down, then we can worry about choreography. So, for the rest of tonight, lines. Tomorrow, we’ll see how much you absorbed today and work on choreography.”
“I’m sure he didn’t,” Cas replied in a comforting voice, rubbing a hand up and down Dean’s arm. Dean focused on the soothing sensation, grounding himself in the here and now instead of his memories, and was not doing such a great job – until Cas reached into the box.
He was tired enough to drift off almost immediately after getting under the covers, no stressing or worrying about sharing a bed with Dean for the first time like he had feared.
Dean held up his hands in surrender and left; but somehow Castiel knew this wouldn’t be the end of it.
Dean met Cas’ gaze for only a second before gesturing for Cas to follow him and heading out the door. Cas looked back at Sam, who gave him a thumbs-up and a mouthed, “Good luck,” before following his boyfriend to his room.
Dean immediately froze, a chill running down his spine. “Dad – Dad can’t ever know,” he forced out through numb lips.
“Indeed,” Rowena drawled, startling Dean (who had half-forgotten she was there). “Any chance I could convince you to continue performing, handsome?”
She gave his shoulders a squeeze. “Yeah it did, hon. C’mon, let’s go sit down and you can introduce me to your boyfriend.”
And like Dean had thought, it was great to have Cas at D&D. He was definitely a convert, too, if the excitement in his eyes as the session progressed was any indication. Charlie and Dean’s sneaky plan to get Cas into D&D to secretly extend his friend group, because Cas was awesome and deserved more friends, was progressing very well.
Claire blushed more. “Well. Um. I…try. It’s kinda my fault we’re here, anyway.”
“…Something like that. But – can I – ”
As his mom had promised, three weekends passed faster than Dean had thought – and he had even gotten to see Cas on the second weekend, which was awesome! It sucked that he and Cas couldn’t go to the same school, but it was fun getting to show Cas some of the cool things he’d been learning (how was it possible no one had shown Cas how to make a fortune teller yet?).
“These are very nice, Dean,” Cas suddenly rumbled in a surprisingly low timbre, snapping Dean’s attention to the blue panties he was carefully rubbing between his fingers.
Mary ruffled his hair. “Time’ll fly by faster than you think – and hey, if it’ll make you feel better, maybe you and Cas can have playdate between now and then?”
Cas sat up slowly, keeping steady eye contact. “Dean. I am serious. This…while the idea is new to me, I would be honored to be someone you decided to date. You already know that I am asexual, and I know that can be a…problem, for some people. So – you should take some time to think about it. But either way you decide, I’m your friend first and foremost. Okay?”
She sighed. “Guess Lee finally talked to you. Yeah, Dean – I do.”
Cas rubbed at his forehead. “I did talk to her, yes.”
Cas tilted his head. “Why not?”
Castiel put his head in his hands. Maybe he was tired, maybe he was just a soft touch, but he found himself deciding to agree to talk to Dean’s little brother about being ace in high school, which – oof. Whether you knew or not, being ace in high school was not easy and Castiel figured that even if he wasn’t certain he would be all that helpful, at least the kid would have someone to talk with who got it.
Cas’ brow furrowed. “What’s left of what?”
“So?” Dean asked breathlessly.
His father grunted. “I don’t know how your mother will feel about that…”
“Okay, but even if that’s true – “
“Wrangling my brother is a full-time job; it’s easier the more of us wranglers there are,” Sam responded cheekily. “Good luck Cas.”
Dean nodded before turning to the food they had ordered. It smelled amazing, even if he couldn’t quite figure out what the smells were. They dug in, and Dean barely held back a loud moan. “This is *amazing*!” he whispered to Cas.
Cas turned to face him and gave a single nod.
It took another hour, but finally Dean chose a print that he could hang in his room and they were leaving the museum, Dean placated with promises that they’d be back soon.
Or worst of all, humming The Who’s Behind Blue Eyes when Cas walked in. That never failed to set Dean’s face on fire.
“No, and I won’t. Claire trusts me right now, and I don’t want her running off – ”
“No, no, I like it. I’ll remember that. Cas. Yes,” Cas smiled. “Much better than what Gabriel used to call me.” Dean opened his mouth to ask, but Cas just kept talking. “Story for another time, you’re almost on, go! Break a leg!”
“I think…to explain Lee, you have to know – the summer before I met him, my father died. And…not that my dad didn’t have his issues, because he did, there’s a reason Mom divorced the bastard – but. Sammy had just come out to me as ace, and all I could think was how much easier he would have it if Dad never came home. And then, of course, he didn’t.”
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Of course, father,” he replied, squeezing Claire’s hand before following Zachariah out of the room.
“Still,” Kim smiled at her.
“Research, dammit, that’s you and Sammy’s department,” Dean grumbled halfheartedly.
But at least he would have tried.
Cas shrugged. “I think that art is important enough to you that anyone who doubts its worth…is not going to be someone you stay with for long. I suspected Lisa was not going to be it for you, Dean; that doesn’t mean she wasn’t special or important to you.”
Claire swallowed. She knew her uncle was incredibly homophobic – part of why she had tried so hard to keep her budding interest in other girls under wraps before now; but…she couldn’t – wouldn’t – dismiss Kaia like that. She was opening her mouth to say something when Kaia jumped in first. “What explanation would she need? It’s none of your business,” she sneered.
“Please what, Dean?” was Cas’ growled reply.
“Thank you, Cassie, I owe you huge,” she breathed.
Dean pulled out his phone and dialed Sammy.
He was starting to lose the battle again as he made his way up the stairs, but he was quickly distracted by Cas and Sam’s worried faces peeking out of the door of Sam’s room. Immediately he barged in, and Cas closed the door behind him. “You guys okay?”
Mary put a hand to her chest and gasped theatrically. “I’m wounded! How dare you doubt your incredibly insightful and intelligent mother!”
“I – but – ugh, whatever, Hanscum,” Dean stuttered before storming off.
To: Cas
Cas just opened his mouth, to reassure Dean that he was about to put it back, but Dean continued talking. “Not talking about that, Cas. Period.”
Dean couldn’t help smiling at Cas’ eager beaver status when he reached the cafeteria, even as his stomach twisted at the thought of eating; but still, he gathered some soup, crackers and bread, figuring a lighter meal would be easier to force down during this conversation.
Zachariah’s shoulders stiffened. “And I suppose, Mother, that you would prefer to stay instead of returning with me?” he asked calmly.
Bobby snapped out of that train of thought as Sam frowned at him. “And Dean doesn’t want me – or you, probably – trying to hint at anything to Mom, see what she might think beforehand.” Bobby chuckled – Sam was good at a lot of things, but subtlety of any kind was a long way down on the list; of course Dean didn’t want Sam blundering into that thorny conversation like the awkward, gangly baby moose he was. Whether Bobby should stick his nose into it or not was a very different matter – *he* knew how to subtly change Mary’s train of thought (the boys had begged him to change their mom’s mind on enough things both big and small over the years, and Bobby had become quite adept at it) but he wouldn’t, if Sam said so.
Claire winced as her uncle’s slimy grin became an aggressive glare. “Really? None of my business? That’s your tactic?” he taunted. “All it would take is a word from me, letting them know that their little girl was *unnatural,* and her parents would not only toss her out on the street, they’d thank me for letting them know.” He lowered his voice to a sibilant hiss. “So tell me, you ugly little bitch, are you sure it isn’t any of my business?”
Cas noticed that Dorothy winked at Charlie behind Dean’s back, and Charlie had to clear her throat before fiddling with something behind the screen she had set up.
Cas moaned as Dean got out of bed. “You’re letting out all the waaarmth.”
(Cas was the one who gifted Dean with the gigantic coffee-table book of the full collection of Arcimboldo’s prints in one volume that was his absolute favorite of them all.)
“See you soon, boy,” Bobby called after him.
Dean rubbed a hand over his mouth. “Okay…so what’s the plan?”
And Cas had started showing up even more often - but he never asked about Sammy again. Dean figured Cas had just heard enough the first time.
“Nevertheless, it is true. You’re important to me, Dean. And secondly, as much as this may come as a surprise to you, I think that you are a very worthy candidate for dating…if you’re comfortable with that.”
“I know, cuz, I know you wouldn’t. Jody thought that when he called, it was to check if your phone was on and if you were in the same place as I was. If both of those were true, he could ping your phone and get the address.”
In any case, shifting worldview or not, Cas truly enjoyed getting to watch Dean and his friends play this fascinating game, reveling in their victories and bemoaning their defeats; unable to fully follow the plot of their adventure, as he was entering mid-campaign, but he was quickly sucked into the chaotic energy nonetheless, and when the session began to wrap up, Cas was shocked to see that it had been over four hours since he had walked in the door – and even more shocked to find that he was disappointed that it was over.
Not that he and Sam didn’t talk about Dean, but Cas acted like they were back to their original normal, with not much having changed other than Cas starting to attend D&D sessions –  nothing about Dean’s new attendance of his study sessions or hanging out in his room after their pop culture nights came to a close. Cas just didn’t want anything to change.
“Oh no, baby girl, did you make a mess in your panties?” Lee smirked and reached into the biggest pocket of his cargoes. “Luckily for you, I came prepared,” he continued as he pulled out another pair of panties, black silk ones in a little baggie.
Dean seemed to be staying still long enough that Mary felt comfortable opening some of the informational pamphlets she had picked up at a number of the exhibits they had visited already. When she next looked up, Dean wasn’t alone anymore – he was waving his hands around excitedly as he talked to a quietly nodding boy who looked to be around his age. “Excuse me? Are you Dean’s mother?” suddenly came from behind her, and Mary turned to face a kindly looking older woman. “I apologize if I startled you, dear. Dean pointed you out when he started talking to my grandson, and I thought I should come over and introduce myself.”
“I’m told the food is worth it,” Cas whispered, taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders. He briefly glanced at the menu before passing it to Dean. “I’m getting a salmon bento and matcha.”
“Dean baked three different kinds of pie, Donna; there’s a lot of food to enjoy here and you’re going to want to save room for those,” Jody reminded her.
Castiel was...not who he had expected. Of course, being tired could have been a large part of it...but Dean hadn’t expected to be called a stalker nor actually get Cas’ number after the fuss the guy had put up about giving it to him. And just to make sure Dean got home safely? That was...surprisingly thoughtful. Something Sammy would do.
Cas smiled back. “Bobby reacted well to my coming out as well; we’re all good.”
“Yeah, he…he thinks he did something wrong.”
Claire pressed her lips together. Damn, she hadn’t meant to say that.
Dean was horrified that his boyfriend had not only never heard of Parcheesi, but had only ever played Monopoly before. It was time for Cas to get *educated.*
Cas was quiet for the rest of lunch, trying to figure out what he had missed, because a reaction like that from Dean definitely meant he was missing something.
Cas threw his hands up. “I honestly don’t know, Dean. Claire has definitely made a number of…unsanctioned trips before this, but – she’s never been this…scared, before.” Cas bit his lip. “I think this might be more than just some teenage rebellion.”
So Dean stretched, making sure Cas got an eyeful as he did so. Cas’ stare was hot and achieved his revenge for making him do research on his break – win-win.
While he was a little worried about sharing a bed with Cas, by the time he got out of the shower he had mostly calmed down; of course, when he got to his room, Cas had somehow found his box of…Lee’s gifts.
“…That accent is *very* French,” Cas commented as the opening song played.
“I bet not,” Dean grumbled as he sent another text telling Sam to back off, Cas had accidentally told him and he didn’t need Sam making Cas feel guilty – it was done, he was coming, end of story. A lightbulb went off as he was typing and he sent one last text: ‘How were you even going to explain how you knew Cas without Cas and I being friends first? Mom and Bobby don’t know about you being ace.’
“Right. But how did you learn all of Link’s lines and songs? Not by me telling them to you – by watching the movie over and over again. Did you ask Castiel to actually show you how the moves should go – or even better, find someone to walk you through them?”
Dean pouted, but brightened when Cas promised to make them to the best of his ability in the dorm kitchen at a later date.
Dean took a deep breath. “Thanks, Cas.”
But with Cas…Dean was surprised to find himself always wanting to spend *more* time with Cas, not less. Cas was equally as interested to talk about Sam as Dean was, and outside of that, had an uncanny intuition for when Dean needed someone to listen, to distract him or to leave him alone.
Cas just tilted his head confusedly as Dean blushed. “I promise, Mom, nothing’s going to happen, can we please go now?”
“That’s not funny, Sam,” Dean snapped back.
He was lost in thought when he suddenly heard someone say, “ – and I’m asexual.”
The girl Claire recognized earlier – Christina? Christy? Something like that – was getting visibly more nervous as it gets closer and closer to her turn.
But Claire’s favorite part of the night was getting to spend time talking with Charlie and Dorothy – about college, joining their school’s GSA, D&D (which Kaia was very interested in, and Claire remained a little skeptical but willing to give it a try) and just…life. There weren’t that many years between the two couples, but Claire could so easily see how the older two were so much more comfortable in their own skins, in their relationship...
Claire offered him a shy smile. “Thanks, Cassie. And – this is Kaia.” She gestures to the girl next to her.
Mary’s eyes sharpened. “Oh? Is it?”
After the meeting wrapped up, Krissy was quick to come up to Claire. “Thanks again, for that,” they started. “I knew Rebecca wasn’t my biggest fan, but…I hadn’t expected anything like that. Don’t know what the rest of the group would have done if you hadn’t said anything, so…yeah. Thanks.”
Cas hugged her back, tears prickling at his eyes. “I…yes, that sounds wonderful,” he replied after clearing his throat.
Claire shook her head. “Nah, only got to Ed fighting the scar guy.”
“Fine,” Rowena huffed, “technically there *is* an understudy but he absolutely refuses to go on stage. He has agreed to help you learn your lines and choreography, however.”
“He does realize they’ll DIE if he does that, right?” Cas burst out angrily.
Sam blew out a sigh. “Well, Dean’s definitely gone into martyr mode.”
Dean smiled gratefully at his brother. “Thanks. And, uh – Bobby’s talking to Mom, so maybe…y’know. Stay up here and out of the way for now?”
He spent most of the car ride there chattering about his D&D group and what had been happening to their characters; it was a good group, and there were plenty of hilarious shenanigans to share – especially about Gabriel and his bard character.
“To be fair, he bet you wouldn’t say anything before we were parked at your house. I knew you would end up saying something before that,” Cas explained smugly.
By the end of dinner, Cas was too tired to do much; he gave Dean a quick kiss, gave Claire a hug, wished everyone else a good night, and went to bed early.
Mary was the “more the merrier” type and always had been, but even she was a little taken aback by how large their expected guest list had grown in such a short time. Luckily, Ellen was used to cooking for far more than fifteen people at a time and promised that she could whip up a big enough feast no problem – she’d just need use of their kitchen for longer than she had expected. Mary had no problem with that, and so the Harvelle family descended on the Winchester home early in the morning of Thanksgiving day. Ash quickly disappeared next door, to Bobby’s garage with the man himself, but Jo and Dean quickly got roped into kitchen duty.
“That little bitch!” Dean growled.
Krissy frowned. “Tell me you’re reading the manga.”
“Boy, you think after I learned about Dean, that I didn’t do my research? There’s all sorts in this world, and just knowing about a few of them is no way to go through life. I may not know everything, but I know what not being attracted to people means. So – asexual or aromantic?”
“Please,” Cas asked quietly. “This has been...very aggravating. I just want to know how to fix it,” he whispered.
But before Dean could finish berating himself that that was a *terrible* line and Cas probably wasn’t even interested -
Castiel couldn’t help it; he burst out laughing. The creepy mental image he had of Dean melted away in the face of this – this absolute *dork* who couldn’t even finish a sentence.
“…Sarah,” Sammy finally muttered. “She’s in my art history class.”
Cas took a deep breath. “So. Like I said before, this is not only about me. If there’s something you’re interested in that I haven’t thought of, or something I’ve thought of that makes you uncomfortable, you have to tell me.”
Dean balked a little. “But – ”
Claire was happy to tell him all about her classes, her new friends, Kaia’s awesome language skills…anything and everything. She was happy, really happy, and she wanted Cassie to know that. She thought he got the message, after all the smiling and listening he did.
Dean caught up quickly. “Fair enough. But since my dorm’s the same direction, I’m just going to make sure you get there safely, alright?”
His aunt made an offended noise. “I – I wouldn’t say that, exactly – ”
The next morning, Dean woke up first. He carefully got up and got dressed, tiptoeing down the hall to the bathroom. He hadn’t beat Sam, unfortunately, who always took way too long dealing with his L’Oreal mop, so Dean knocked hard on the door to let Sam know he was waiting and sat down in the hallway.
“Probably should have guessed that. Well, I did know, Dean made it pretty clear, but – he also said that their – their thing was helping him get over Dad, so. He asked me not to interfere, and like an idiot, I promised him I wouldn’t. They got…more intense – ”
“Promise,” Cas chuckled as he started to unpack his travel bag. He did look around at all the posters and knick-knacks around the room while Dean was occupied – of course Dean had a vast collection, some featuring characters or images he recognized, but many of them still unfamiliar to him. There was a poster that had the now-familiar Captain America along with a number of other characters; Cas figured he would be introduced to them in subsequent Marvel movies.
But no, that was Dean with pizza boxes in the doorway and…Charlie was there too? Why –
Dean shot fully upright, staring at Cas. “That’s – that’s for whips and shit, not for – ”  Dean gestured. “Stuff like this.”
It wasn’t hard to find Bobby, after Mary left. He was sitting in the kitchen, reading a book.
The two women made their way into the kitchen, followed by Ellen ejecting Dean and Jo.
Sam groaned. “Please don’t make me describe Dean’s sex life. You really don’t want to know, and I wish I hadn’t found out. They weren’t doing anything unsafe, just…intense.”
Cas eventually cleared his throat. “Dean, may I ask you something?”
“True,” Sam agreed. “We won’t do anything until we talk to Dean.”
Lee definitely liked the panties. After Dean mentioned he had only bought the one pair and didn’t have any more, Lee – got more. Somehow.
Dean whipped around to face Cas, face contorted into a snarl, but Cas raised his hands in the universal gesture for peace. “I swear, I had no idea she was still stuck on doing that, I thought I had talked her out of it.”
Cas, still flushed from the compliment, stuttered on the next part of his order - but it’s not like Dean needed to hear it, Cas ordered pretty much the same thing every time. Instead, Dean couldn’t help interrupting Cas and blurting out, “Cas, I am so sorry for my stupid little brother, I have no idea where he even - “
Dean couldn’t help kissing Cas’ hand that he still held in his grasp. “More than worth it to date you, to be at your side where I belong.”
Dean hesitated, but – Cas wouldn’t lead him astray. “Alright, alright. But nothing too fancy, please?”
Dean hunched his shoulders. “Oops. You could have let me know I was taking too long,” he muttered, lightly bumping shoulders with Cas.
(And if Dean’s birthday and Christmas presents almost entirely revolved around Arcimboldo-themed books and prints for the next two years? Well, Dean was the determined kind; if he’d been much older, Mary was certain he’d have been scraping together money from odd jobs to buy as many Arcimboldo prints and books he could get his hands on. As it was, by the time he was old enough to be earning his own money, the Arcimboldo fever had mostly been sated; and minimum twice a month visits to the National Galleries quickly petered out after the Arcimboldo exhibit left.)
Just then, Mary walked by the entryway. Bobby tried to step in front of the boys – block her view, since he knew that Dean was not expecting to face Mary this quickly – but it was too late.
Meg had found him later and let him know that the other student – Dean, apparently – had been pretty insistent about finding Castiel, even if he wouldn’t tell Meg why. “I will say, Clarence, he didn’t strike me as the type to be afraid of. Charlie’s the one who scooped him up, and she’s usually a good judge of character. Maybe just talk to him?”
Cas had thought about asking Sam about it, but for now, he was enjoying it too much. He left Sam in the dark, afraid that Sam might say something to his brother and bring it all crashing down around him.
He groaned loudly. “Really? You? Now?”
Dean sighed. “Yeah, Bobby, but – can you send Cas up?”
Sam’s musing was interrupted by Bobby coming up behind him. “Is there anything I should know about Dean’s senior year?” Bobby rumbled. “Dean…wasn’t forthcoming.”
When Dean still hadn’t heard from Lee three days later, he called one of Lee’s hockey buddies. He told Dean that Lee had volunteered for the army months ago and told everyone else that he didn’t plan to keep in contact, was going to change his phone number. Everyone knew, aside from Dean.
He did try a couple more (less dignified) tactics as the milkshakes came to the table and were slowly sucked down, but eventually Cas shut him up: “You wouldn’t want me to disappoint Bobby would you, Dean?”
Jo scowled. “Don’t need to,” she muttered rebelliously.
It did get him kicked out of his own room, but it was so worth it. He could procrastinate on his research by going to check in with Sammy.
A couple of days later, right as Dean was about to get into bed, Sammy showed up in his doorway. “Can I talk to you?” he mumbled, wringing his hands.
“Because?” Cas asked, stepping a little closer to Dean.
Dean flushed. “I know that! I just – I don’t know how to start it, or – or say what I want to say without scaring him off or hurting his feelings.”
Dean inched closer to where Cas was standing. “And I’m not saying that it’s going to be perfect, or easy, but…I want to at least try. Don’t you?”
When they ended up in front of a selection of the Greek and Roman statuary in the museum in the hall between exhibits, Cas paused in front of one of the female statues and took a deep breath. “Dean?”
“My brother’s name is Sam, that’s his phone number. And if there’s anything you want to ask me, or anything you think I should know about Sam, that’s my phone number.” Dean held up a hand before Castiel could say anything. “You don’t have to use it if you really don’t want to, but...just in case. For my peace of mind?”
“Wait, what? What do you mean you’ve been there?” Dean interrupted.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Of course he did, the nerd,” he replied fondly.
So he bought all the same snacks he had purchased last time, as they had gone over well, and walked over to the meeting room with Dean. He knew Charlie was happy he was coming, as he had checked in with her to make absolutely sure he was welcome, but he was *not* expecting the rest of the group’s enthusiastic welcome. This time they all introduced themselves – Gabriel was the group’s bard as well as the group’s comedic relief, always cracking jokes and eating his body weight in sugar; Kevin played a cleric, often healing the other characters’ injuries and serving as the voice of reason in opposition to Gabriel’s chaos; Dorothy played a ranger whose fantastic luck when rolling her bow attacks made her character quite the sharpshooter. “She’s definitely cheating, I just haven’t figured out how yet,” Dean groused.
Sam stood at the window and watched Cas and Dean drive off, brow furrowed as he worried. Dean had been pretty affected by Lee’s disappearing act after their…relationship, to the point that he had barely even mentioned the name again. Sam wasn’t sure why Bobby had decided to say something, but…Sam was going to have to try and keep an eye on Dean over the next couple weeks. Cas would probably help him, and maybe he could make a quick trip out to the school by the end of the month…
For now, he should get to his research, like he had told Dean.
After Ellen disappeared back into the kitchen, it wasn’t long before the D&D group showed up – they had carpooled from campus together. Cas and Dean were happy to see their friends, but Dean was surprised to see Charlie and Dorothy holding hands. He stared for a minute before shooting Charlie a raised eyebrow.
He had made it most of the way down the hall when Lee caught up with him. “Dean, I – I’m sorry, I – I got carried away – ” Lee started before Dean held up a hand.
Dean and Sam sighed, while Cas frowned. “I don’t know, Jo – even if you only went part-time and worked at the Roadhouse to help pay for it, you could probably learn at least something in a couple business or economics classes. Learn some tricks for making the restaurant even more successful than it already is – do you have a website or any social media pages to help grow your customer base?”
Dean’s jaw dropped. “I – ”
In any case, Claire loved it there and – as she hoped – Kaia loved it too. The interior of the shop was always bustling, so Claire and Kaia took their goods outside, where it was much more quiet.
Sam enjoyed his victories at first, but once Cas learned the rules of each game, he quickly started steamrolling the younger boy. Once Sam grew tired of losing, he would introduce Cas to a new game – and the cycle started again. Sam was starting to run out of new games when he heard his mom and Dean enter the house.
Cas hadn’t realized how bad off the girls were at Holy Spirit, if transferring was such a relief to Kaia; he was glad they were getting the chance to start over.
Sammy groaned. “Yes, I promise I’m not in any physical distress.”
Charlie raised an eyebrow at Dean. “I – yeah, yeah that’s fine,” Dean grumbled.
Dean immediately faced her head-on, mouth gaping a little. How –
Dean nodded firmly. “Okay. So, first things, I know – I know I told you a lot about my…background. A lot of the stuff that’s been messing me up. And you’ve been amazing, really – but. It kinda feels weird to know that you know so much about me and I know…basically nothing about you?”
“I know you think I’m ancient, but I was your age once, Dean. Not to mention psychic mom powers,” she nodded seriously, tapping her temple.
“Not that I can think of, have at it boys,” was Bobby’s smirked reply.
Dean stared back at Sam, mind whirring. As much as their dad had spewed his hatred of “unnatural” people and his belief that they all needed to be “fixed” or wiped out...Dean believed, deeper than anything else, that Sam? Sam was part of what was good in this world. And if Sam wasn’t straight, if he fell into John’s definition of “unnatural” – then John was wrong. It was that simple.
“Cas! Dean! Any luggage in the car?”
And then there wasn’t any time to think, with the whirlwind of costume fittings, performing on stage for the first time – performing with fellow actors instead of just Cas – but Dean took it one day at a time and the next thing he knew, it was opening night. Sammy and his mom were in the audience, hopefully his team had been joking about showing up too, and Cas – Cas was backstage with him, helping ease the last-minute nerves. “You’ve got this,” Cas reassured as he smoothed the collar of Dean’s shirt. “You can perform your part backwards and forwards, you’re going to go out there and absolutely kill it.”
Cas stayed silent, sensing that Sam still had more to say.
Dean gasped at the friction, starting to grind into it as Lee slowly increased the pressure. While one hand was in front, the other was slowly working its way under Dean’s pants – and found smooth silk instead of the expected cotton.
Dean smiled when he got those texts; he knew that he alone wasn’t enough for his brother, but he was glad he had found someone else better.
Dean’s gaze wandered as he felt his face heat up. “Um. Almost definitely not.”
“Stars an angel with a much more pronounceable name, and it’s also your nickname from now on, Clarence,” she continued gleefully.
“I am definitely coming,” Dean gritted out as he sent Sam multiple texts about what a dirty traitor he was, how Dean would get his revenge and would see him next week, bitch.
Cas did as ordered, crawling back into bed with Dean and passing back out.
By this point Sam had drifted up behind Cas, and frowned at Dean. “You’re voluntarily giving up the chance to drive? That’s more than just you being tired, Dean, what’s – ”
The rest of the room chuckled as Cas rolled his eyes. “Alright, Claire-Bear, two can play at that game,” he threatened.
Claire smiled back and gave him a quick hug. “Thanks, Cassie.”
Perhaps…perhaps this was something Cas would want to try, when they started their next – what had Charlie called it? Ah yes, their next campaign.
“And??” Dean asked eagerly.
Dean shrugged uncomfortably.
…well
Lisa paused at that. “So…if Cassie asked you out today, what would you say?”
…Especially knowing that Cas…didn’t have context. Cas had never met Lee, never met his father, hadn’t had the chance to form…opinions the way Sammy had. No prejudice or preconceived notions clouding his judgment, just Dean telling his side of the story to a blank slate.
“Okay, a childhood without Disney movies is cruel enough, but – no Parcheesi? Did you play *any* board games growing up?” Dean interrupted.
The two girls spent most of the afternoon talking and laughing, enjoying their time together. Finally Claire worked up the courage to ask Kaia if she might want to meet up like this again, soon?
Dean chuckled. “Nah, she’s way out of my league. Tried to ask her out a while ago, she turned me down flat.”
Of all the times Bobby had had her back, this one time that he didn’t had left Mary reeling. Dean…wasn’t who she thought he was. Her boy had a boyfriend, not a girlfriend. And not just any boyfriend, but Castiel. The poor boy she had welcomed into her family like a son…was now dating her actual son.
Cas smiled to himself, pretending he hadn’t seen anything, as he unpacked the snacks, thanked everyone, and wished them a good session.
And of course, just as Dean was wrapping up his plans for the month, Sammy called.
“Is it that obvious I’m new?” he asked as they sat down.
He flirted with a couple others – Michael, Aaron, other names he knew he was forgetting – but then he met Lee. They clicked together incredibly well: trading off cooking meals, learning to accept being taken care of instead of always being the caretaker, understanding each other’s vulnerabilities and weak spots and how to counter them – not to mention practically perfect chemistry in the bedroom. Dean even took Lee to a couple local art museums and had a damn good time – his first positive museum dates, with a fantastic guy he was lucky enough to be dating. Dean was pretty damn happy.
To neither boys’ surprise, Mary was happy to take the two girls in; she started tidying up the guest room as she continued to talk with them on their walk to meet Claire and Kaia, asking about their studies and what had been going on in their lives. Cas cut Dean off in the middle of his moaning over a test that he worried he did horribly on (but Cas knew he almost certainly did perfectly well on). “Look, there she is.”
It didn’t take long for him to call Charlie. “Do *you* think I’m in love with Cas?” he blurted when she picked up.
After everyone was seated and served, Cas groaned happily into the first bite of his burger. “These make me very happy,” he couldn’t help moaning, ignoring Dean’s blush and smiling at Bobby’s subtle preening. After Cas had demolished his burger and was left with only a few fries to pick at, Dean immediately started in on the whining and bargaining Bobby had warned him about, but Cas stood firm.
(And if he was also mitigating his own slight touch-starvation…well, no one needed to know that.)
“How dare he? More like how dare *you,* you – you cretin!” Grandma Irene walked up behind Cas and wrapped her arms around his shoulders as she glared at her hateful son. “You’ve mistreated your son for long enough – now that he’s finally found happiness, you want to take it away? For shame!”
“No,” Cas mumbled guiltily, “no, you wouldn’t. I’m sorry. But – you never told me?”
“Merry Christmas,” Cas replied before hanging up.
“That would be awesome, Cas,” she breathed in relief. “Who should I – ”
But before he could, he had to think long and hard about what he wanted to do about his family. He knew that Sammy and Bobby both knew and would probably be ecstatic that he was dating Cas – they would welcome the news with either excited hugs (Sam) or gruff congratulations (Bobby).
“Hey!” Claire retorted indignantly.
Dean couldn’t help the instinctive grimace that came over his face at the thought of that. “Ew, no.” But - if Cas thought that Sammy was his boyfriend, then - then maybe -
Dean growled and threw his hands up; his boyfriend was a monster.
Cas grabbed it and Dean didn’t let go, the two walking to the classroom hand in hand.
“Did you uncover anything in your ‘recon’ that makes you worry I’ll misuse the phone number?” Castiel interrupted.
Cas was about to suggest the three of them try some other game when he heard the front door open.
“Dean, there’s more to identity than just straight or gay. Bi and pan people feel attraction to multiple genders – that doesn’t mean they’re gay. They’re queer, yes, but being gay is only a small part of that umbrella,” Lee explained.
“N-nothing,” Dean stuttered, shoving his phone in his pocket. “Where have you been?”
Last night…definitely could have gone worse, Dean admitted to himself, but he had not expected Cas to find his panty collection. That was not something Dean had expected to deal with so soon – and he knew Cas. Just because his boyfriend had been distracted by The Princess Bride and his own fatigue did not mean that Cas was going to let Dean’s immediate shutdown of the topic go. Dean was going to get badgered for information, sooner rather than later, and he had better have a plan when it happened.
One particularly rough tussle in the garage led to Lee pinning Dean on the floor, faces almost close enough to touch. Dean still didn’t know who had moved first, but all of a sudden they were kissing. After a pretty swoon-worthy kiss, if Dean said so himself, they both stared at each other – Dean confused, Lee looking almost…scared? But before Dean could say anything, Lee had grabbed his stuff and run off.
And that's a wrap! Hope you enjoyed :)
Cas smiled softly; Charlie may have locked them in, but at least she did so after making sure that they would both be able to eat the pizza. She and Dean both knew he hated an overload of toppings on his pizza; at most places, he preferred to stick with just cheese.
She was silent for a beat. “Oh, there definitely is. Let me guess – something about Cas?”
“Cas?”
As Cas suspected, Dean was definitely avoiding him – again. Cas only let him cancel pop culture night on him once before getting Charlie involved this time. But they had to be sneakier than Cas crashing D&D again; Dean would be expecting that.
John and Sam waved goodbye as they exited, and Mary carried Dean to the car. They exchanged grins as they drove off.
But now it was the Arcimboldo exhibit weekend, and Dean was wriggling excitedly in the backseat of the car, his mom laughing at him from the front seat. “We’re almost there, Dean, relax.”
“I’m Kim, she/her, and I’m pan. And – let’s keep it going, to my right?”
Dean frowned at him. “Yeah? I know. You made it pretty clear when you came out to me – you think I didn’t do my homework after that? Look into what it’s like for an allosexual person to date an ace one?”
Dean bit his lip. “Yeah, at the time I didn’t really think about it, but it was weird that he could keep getting his hands on so many…” He stiffened. “I hope he didn’t steal them.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re welcome – but you better not complain when you don’t have room for pie!” Jody warned.
“Sammy, stop for a sec,” Dean groaned as he gestured as Cas’ expression.
“No, I’m fine just watching,” Bobby smirked as he pulled up a chair. “And watch out for Dean, he cheats.”
Or that’s what he thought, until Claire came back from checking on Kaia. “Cassie…did – did you talk to my parents? At all?”
Sammy nodded, blinking back tears, before throwing his arms around Dean and burying his face in his neck. Dean hugged him back, eyes feeling a little misty himself.
By the end of the movie, Cas was barely awake and Dean put everything away as Cas crawled under the covers and immediately passed out. Dean chuckled to himself; guess he was worried for no reason. He drifted off to sleep pretty quickly himself after that.
“Yup.”
The two girls settled in, Kaia far more used to sharing a bed than Claire but – despite Claire’s original misgivings – it wasn’t long until both of them were deeply asleep.
“And Claire! Might not be mine by blood but you look like you need a hug anyway, c’mere!”
…But maybe he could tell someone else. If he could just pretend that Cas wasn’t in the room long enough to tell someone else over the phone…
But Claire was going to give it the benefit of the doubt. She sat in one of the chairs nearest the door, farther away from the clustered cliques.
He eyed it carefully before taking a sip. It was…surprisingly good. Thick, milky and sweet. He took a longer sip and sucked up a sphere – which was chewy and sweet. “Okay, this is pretty great,” Dean admitted, taking an ever longer sip.
“…But what if?” Sam finished for him. “Yeah. Okay, totally fair. Um. Do you want me to test her out first, maybe make some subtle hints – ”
Sam sighed. “If this is what I think it is…I can’t actually tell you, not without betraying Dean’s trust,” the younger Winchester admitted. “But I can try and talk to him, see if I can get him to talk to you?”
Once they were inside and the door was closed, Dean led them towards a pair of desks facing each other.
pick a time and place
“Cas,” Dean responded croakily before clearing his throat. “Gimme a sec,” he continued as he placed the box down (carefully) and got up to unlock the door. He opened it to let Cas in, but quickly closed and locked it again. He saw Cas zero in on the box before focusing on Dean’s face.
In any case, he hadn’t seen Sam so excited to come over in – well, too many years. (He should’ve known better than to think it was over getting to spend some time in his company.) Sam burst through the door and barely gave Bobby a second to say hello before shouting one of the last things Bobby had expected to hear: “Dean and Cas are getting married!”
He gestured at Dean’s defensive position, feeling slightly sick to his stomach. “Look what I’ve done already.”
“Um. Me and Kaia. She’s a friend of mine…she needs somewhere to crash too.”
Dean sunk deeply into his grief and guilt, buried to the point that he felt like he would never escape it.
Dean smiled and ruffled Sam’s hair. “That’s awesome, Sammy!”
Dean just growled incoherently before turning over to glare at his annoying little brother. “This is all your fault. I told them I would suck at choreography.”
Sam and Bobby could tell that Dean was panicking, but then Bobby had the brilliant suggestion of pulling out Parcheesi – a game that Dean and Sam had hundreds of hours of fond memories from playing.
After stuffing themselves at dinner, Cas offered to help clean up but Mary shooed him out of the kitchen with Sam and Dean. The three boys started to watch Captain America: The First Avenger. Cas had never seen the Marvel movies, and Sam finally convinced Dean that if they were only watching one movie, to ease Cas into the whole saga, this was the best move. Full, cozied up next to Dean (his boyfriend!) on the couch and watching an amazing movie about the power of a “little guy” – Cas was overwhelmed with how happy he felt, in this moment. He was so, so lucky.
Dean sighed and smiled reassuringly. “Cas. If sex is not something you want, then I’m not going to pressure you about it. I mean, I might end up getting to know my right hand a lot better, but – I want to make you happy the way you make me happy. You, not any specific thing we do together. As for messing up with we have together - if it helps, I’ve now dated two of my friends and gone back to friendship afterwards pretty easily. On the off chance we break up, it’s not going to be enough for me to lose having you in my life.”
“Sam. This joke isn’t funny.”
“Look at you, such a good girl,” Lee crooned as Dean stumbled back towards him. He plucked the bag from Dean’s listless fingers and stuffed it back in his cargo pocket before snaking an arm around Dean’s waist. “Keeping ‘em for later,” he winked before planting one last bruising kiss. “Bye, Dean,” he waved as he walked out, Dean left a blushing mess.
Dean grumbled a little, but Castiel could see he was smiling as his own laughter petered out.
In which case, Mary needed to get over this and accept it as the new normal sooner rather than later; she was not losing her boys over something so silly as her own ingrained prejudice – she was better than that, and it was time for her to step up and act like it.
And Cas’ eyes immediately met his.
And as the year wore on, Dean and Lee’s friends got more and more curious about the girls that were clearly keeping the two so busy outside of school. Really, the group was more interested in Lee’s mystery girl – Dean claimed that his missing time went to work…which wasn’t exactly a lie. Lee, on the other hand, couldn’t come up with an excuse but also refused to say anything about the girl, so the group just got more and more curious.
To Sam’s credit, Dean immediately perked up. “Alright, you even got my favorite brand!” he cheered. “Charlie always forgets and asks for the wrong kind.”
Unfortunately, Lisa clearly didn’t share the sentiment. After only one exhibit – Pop art! Who didn’t love pop art, it was an obvious crowd-pleaser, that’s why Dean had been so careful to start in that exhibit – Lisa had started yawning and not-so-subtly staring at the exit.
With that, Lee walked out, and Dean was left with his whole worldview crumbling.
Cas chuckled at the Breakfast Club reference; they had watched that movie recently. “Not sure how accurate that is, but yeah – let me just text Claire.”
“I warned you, Winchester!” Charlie yelled as she pushed Dean inside the room, slammed the door and locked it. “Now start talking, I’ll be back in two hours to check on you!” Her shout was only slightly muffled through the door, but her footsteps walking away sent the message pretty clearly: they were stuck here.
Dean just sat there, open-mouthed, mind spinning. But – but Cas was his best friend!
Mary sighed. “I…you’re right. I’ll go.” She knelt down to face Dean. “Do you still want to come, baby? Or do you want to stay here with your brother and your dad?”
Cas groaned. His boyfriend was going to be the death of him – but what a way to go.
“Okay, son. Good job.” And with that, his father hung up. Cas just stared at the silent phone in his hand, wondering what on earth that had been about.
Claire rolled her eyes and slowly, sarcastically gave him a spin. “Go on, say it.”
Dean threw his arms around Cas in a celebratory hug. “This is going to be awesome,” he laughed.
He never pushed anyone’s boundaries, accepting brush-offs as easily as more positive responses (because neither his mother nor Charlie would stand for anything less) but he could feel some judgmental stares from around the room, which – understandable.
When they got there, Dean couldn’t help beaming at the lit-up walkways – exactly the same as he remembered. Some things really didn’t change, and he found comfort in that familiarity. So he took a deep breath and started to talk.
Both girls nodded.
He must have said that out loud, because Charlie scoffed in reply. “I mean, probably. But you’re also in love with him. I’m your best friend that you’re *not* in love with.”
Dean growled at her halfheartedly. They both knew she was right, that Dean was being ridiculous. Before Dean could say anything else, Charlie just sighed. “Come on, let’s go meet some people. No one’s going to bite.”
“Right! I’ve only ever dated girls. But…I mean…I don’t know, there are some pretty hot male celebrities out there, y’know? Like Harrison Ford, Dr. Sexy, Gene Kelly, James Marsden, Aaron Tveit, Hugh Jackman - but, like, just thinking they’re hot doesn’t mean I’m gay!”
Dean scarfed his lunch in record time and asked to be excused, running straight to his room and locking the door behind him before pulling the box back out from under his bed.
Dean opened his mouth, looking – surprisingly nervous – but Castiel held up a hand, pointed at his large stack of books, and made a shooing motion.
“Fine,” she grumbled, “Bobby was worrying about how quickly you and Cas had gotten together a couple nights ago, surprised you boys hadn’t had more issues – said that you were probably due for some soon and I should be keeping an eye out.”
Cas smiled back. Dean could protest all he wanted, but he was definitely a soft touch under all that bluster.
Dean nodded. “Be careful, right side takes me over there and left takes me back here.”
And it was so worth it. His parents visited rarely, he was able to fob off most of his aunt and uncle’s attention with weekly phone calls, Claire had a sympathetic ear in town, and – and now he had Dean and the Winchester family in his life.
“Why would we need any of that?” Jo scoffed. “We’ve got a Yelp page – four point nine stars out of five, thank you very much – and word of mouth does the rest.”
Dean didn’t reply.
Almost immediately after arriving, Dean was backing out of the room. “Glad you two are great, just wanted to check in, but I, uh, forgot to ask Bobby something!” And he practically fled out the door, closing it quickly behind him.
“We’ll see, jerk,” his brother smirked as he dealt the cards.
Cas had to admit that D&D was far more fun up close rather than observing from afar. Next to Dean, Cas understood the holding-your-breath tension of specific dice rolls, the important distinction between player and character knowledge, the thrill of triumphantly winning a long battle or solving a frustrating puzzle, the hilarious shenanigans certain players enacted and got others sucked into, the delight of stumping Charlie with certain choices; the simple pleasure of watching a story develop and unfold in real time.
Cas couldn’t help laughing too; it was going to be awesome.
Sam couldn’t help letting out a bitter laugh at the understatement. “I don’t know the full story,” he warned as he turned to face the man who was, for all intents and purposes, his father. John be damned.
“I know, it’s a little over-the-top, but it was the 70s – and you have to admit it’s catchy.”
Dean easily settled into planning mode, thoughts of Cas and panties pushed far, far away…for now.
The week wore on and Dean grew even more worried about what the next year would hold. Now he not only had to worry about being shipped off to the Naval Academy – or defying his dad’s “my way or the highway” style of parenting – but what might happen to Sam after Dean left, whether for the Academy or just away from his father’s wrath. Sam wasn’t straight, and if his father found out? Absolutely nothing good could come of it, and for once Dean wouldn’t be there to protect him.
Cas beamed.
Cas blew out a sigh, and Dean shivered. “Like I said, we have to do some research.”
And a pretty decent place at that, Claire commented to herself as she took in the nice bathroom and different hair and soap products cluttering the ledges. It was strange to have choices what to put in her hair or on her body; but nice, she decided as she sniffed some of the bottles, stopping when she found a lovely vanilla scented shampoo-conditioner set and a lavender body soap. She wrapped herself in the thick, warm towel, enjoying the feeling for a few minutes before hanging it up and getting dressed in the pajamas Mary had given her.
Cas nodded in agreement, clearly savoring his mouthful of salmon. He swallowed and smirked at Dean. “It’d be even better with a proper drink to go with it.”
“No, no, I’m not disagreeing with you. Just find it interesting, that’s all. And what did Cas have to say?”
Dean nodded more confidently. “Cool. Is that why the dating thing - ?”
So Jody joined the family at the table for a quick breakfast before heading back out. “And don’t you two worry,” she reassured the two girls, “now that I know, I can warn the rest of the department and keep them off your back as much as possible.”
And if it wasn’t for Bobby, maybe he never would have. Sam’s logic and his mom’s attempts at understanding fell flat because – as much as they loved him and really tried to see where he was coming from, Dean was at a point where he just couldn’t explain anything properly and didn’t have the energy to try and meet his family halfway, no matter how much he needed to. Sam and Mary needed Dean to reach out to them to help him; Bobby came up with a different solution.
Castiel blinked at him. “You’re lying, and now I’m going to be worrying about you.” He sighed before holding out a hand, gesturing for Dean to come closer. “Gimme your phone.”
Claire snickered but obliged, raising her hands in surrender. “Got it, Cassie. How much farther to this car?”
Cas pointedly ignored Dean’s gaping, instead turning to Charlie and raising an eyebrow. “…Is there a reason for the title?”
Off he went, slamming the door on his way out.
And to Castiel’s surprise, Dean proceeded to sing, almost perfectly, every single song Link sang in – including the ones where he only sang parts of them.
Dean’s handle on the choreography was, of course, terrible, but Castiel could work with that. “So the focus is the few lines you *don’t* know and the choreography. Plus some of the smaller details, where to be on stage, practicing with the other cast members on stage…” Castiel smiled. “I admit, Dean, this is not going to be as difficult as I had thought.”
Cas’ phone dinged soon after, and he frowned at what he read there. “Oh, I wasn’t supposed to tell you.”
“All good, I just tripped,” Cas called back. From this vantage point, there was something Cas could almost see, hidden at an awkward angle under the bed…
Cas wasn’t surprised that Bobby showed up not long after they left. “Guess there’s a full house here now, huh?” the older man asked.
“Yeah,” Claire nodded in reply, looking a little shell-shocked – and Kaia’s responding beam spoke for itself.
Cas groaned as Claire smirked. “Toddler me had a very hard time with Castiel, and thus – Cassie! And now it’s just habit – not to mention it annoys him so much,” she finished in a stage whisper.
Mary beamed at her. “Wonderful! Here, the bathroom’s this way,” and she led Claire to the door. “If you need anything else, just call – I’ll be up for a while longer!”
The summer between Dean’s junior and senior year of high school was...turbulent, to say the least.
“…Do I really have to?” Dean whined. “Can’t we just…not talk about this?”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah. Sorry, again. Um. Do you want first shower, or…?”
Cas patted him gently on the shoulder. “Thank you Dean, for telling me. I appreciate it – and now, Sam owes me lunch,” Cas finished with a smugly satisfied voice.
Dean laughed loudly at that. “Okay, okay. I just wanna know you’ll be alive to talk to Sammy later.”
“Okay,” Bobby replied before Dean heard him thump back downstairs.
“Hell of a lot more than that, from what I’ve heard,” came Claire’s cheeky reply from behind them.
Cas barely had the chance to look at Sam before he was shooing the both of them off. “Yes, go! I’ve got other things I can do in here.”
Cas and Sam both squirmed. “Harass is not *exactly* the word I’d use…” Cas hedged.
The table was quiet for only a little while, Cassie stumbling in not long after Jody left with a more-awake Dean watching his every move like a hawk. “Coffeeee,” her cousin moaned. Dean chuckled but made sure Cassie had a cupful before he got anything for himself.
Sammy always appeared soon afterward and wanted help with his homework, got all up in Dean’s space while asking his questions. Even though Dean would have usually grumbled about chick flick moments, after Lee’s brusque exits…it felt nice to be needed, to be cuddled a little, so he never said a word.
So Dean sat.
Dean turned to face him. “I – sure?”
Sam opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
“Thank you, Jody,” Kaia breathed gratefully, Claire nodding beside her.
“Sammy was pretty upset when he found out, mostly worried that Lee wasn’t treating me right – which, in retrospect, of course, Sammy was totally right, but, right then…Lee made me forget,” Dean confessed quietly. “He made me forget about my guilt, about my grief, about – about the future. He grounded me in the moment, that was all I could think about when I was with him, and it felt so good. I mean, looking back, Lee was more like an addiction than anything healthy, but…at the time, it felt like he was all that was keeping me together, and if Sammy had ruined that…well. I don’t want to even think about what could have happened, but luckily Sammy backed off and just…let me enjoy my horrible coping mechanism in peace,” Dean chuckled bitterly.
‘I’m going to be an only child soon,’ Dean thought angrily to himself as he took a deep breath. “Thank you for that stunning observation, Sammy,” he gritted out. “Leave now.”
This year, both Dean and Cas were taking art history. They both loved it, even if Cas had to help Dean memorize all the dates and years and names that they covered.
Claire shook herself out of the memory. No point dwelling on the past – she was right, and Cas had made sure she and Kaia had a safe place to stay for the foreseeable future.
“Oh my god, y’all’re way too invested in my love life,” Lee groaned.
Bobby, however, stayed and watched as Mary grabbed her coat and purse. “You want any company?” He asked as she rushed toward the door. She stopped, took a deep breath. “I – I have a lot to think about,” she sighed. “And since you don’t seem nearly as surprised as I am, I would have appreciated a heads-up, Bobby Singer!” she growled.
