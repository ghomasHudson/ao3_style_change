"There is no glass." He raised his hands to his head, getting slowly to his feet. He felt like he was standing off in the desert night, his knuckles eaten pink with cold. "Eurus."
he said, wonder turning his voice delicate. Someone had entered the room and was shifting his hand off John's face; his surprise intensified as he recognized the white uniform. He relocated his grip to John's hip, feeling blood throb through his femoral artery; he would have to be grounded somehow. His realization had become a physical presence now that John was safe, the truth grown large and violent between them. "You told me so yourself.
John looks uncomfortable. Sherlock takes this as his cue to leave. He doesn’t want to look at John anymore.
The memories grow closer together. Sometimes Sherlock sits primly in a small seat and realizes that this is not who he was before. Speaking with Irene is sharper and quicker; he notices more, the fall of her hair and how it was washed and the weird inflections she uses when she wants to switch course, none of which are as wonderfully clear as he somewhat recalls them being, but they exist. He realizes that he is missing something, a phantom body in itself, and is so overwhelmed with the missing-something at times that he can only fold himself into a square of limbs and stay like that, with his hands steepled at his forehead. Once, when Mycroft sees him doing so, something falls in his eyes like glass. Sherlock asks him about it then, and Mycroft responds, slowly, that it looks very familiar. It feels familiar to Sherlock as well. He spends time with the abrasions in his brain, which is an ugly process: He just wants to see him again.
The world grew large as a fist in Sherlock's eyes. The memory overwhelmed him suddenly, the little woods turning real and dusky, his body loose as a toddler. Yellowbeard and Redbeard, a plastic sword heavy in his chubby grip, fighting through a solemn afternoon; Victor had never been quiet for long.
“Then give me something to do!” Sherlock yells, losing all semblance of composure. Things are popping up behind his eyes. John is startled, and realizes that Sherlock looks utterly deconstructed.
“Sherlock,” John says in mild confusion, “Sherlock, I don’t hate you.” It is obvious that he is saying this because he thinks it is one of Sherlock’s dumb delusions. He may have had many of these, but Sherlock likes to think that while he is blunted, he is not inaccurate, as he was not at the worst of times – he was just slow, and insulated, and interested in nice tactile things. This is plain fact, written clearly on John’s features – contempt, and pity, and a delicate effort to be as firmly accomodating as possible.
It was not a jest. John's chin had stiffened under Sherlock's hand where it still lay, and he gripped back with fear. Sherlock had meant every word of what he had said, but Mycroft was quiet, and Eurus was just beginning to speak.
Mycroft's face was taut, the gun dangling from his hand almost innocuous. They stood in silence until he lay the weapon on the floor, almost like an afterthought. "You should let go of her now."
“Because I knew,” John says with difficulty, “that each day I saw you I would remember Sherlock Holmes as he was, and each day I would know that that Sherlock Holmes loved me and I never did anything, I never reached out to him, and then he tried to die for me. And I couldn’t even blame this Sherlock Holmes, because I would love you too, and see you knowing what you used to be, and not being able to be that person again, and I thought seeing that would kill me because I loved you.”
But – what? He's doing that thing again, making me think we're talking about something when we really, really aren't. How did we come to this again, John? Don't you
“Because it’s wrong,” he insists. “It’s like you’re, you know,” he struggles to find the right words. “It feels predatory. I feel wrong when I think about it.”
"I don't know. It's new." Sherlock goes quiet again. Irene gathers her things after a while spent talking aimlessly with John, which they have become grudgingly adept at, and leaves.
“The case – ” John seems to regret having brought it up. “The case,” he says finally, “made me go quiet.”
of it, which means I probably knew all along that she was alive and still didn't indicate in any way that I'd known, which makes him look like a fool. There are two things he can take from this: One, that I had such low regard for him and his dignity that I wouldn't bother to address an issue he'd put forth out of concern for my well-being and Two, that I was letting him believe the lie because it would mean he'd no longer have the only romantic rival he's ever thought he had with me. As much as I'd like to skew things one way, my deductive habit leans towards the first – damn her bloody timing, he need never have known, but then we wouldn't be having this conversation so I guess it's still favorable. But
“I’m not asking you to,” Sherlock says, thoroughly confused. “Why would I want you to approve of it?”
“You think this is a good idea?” John feels as if he has been sectioned and scrambled and each fissure is now dry and terrible. “What if he’s overwhelmed, being in here? What if he sees me and remembers how he used to be? What if – ”
When Sherlock first meets John he knows that if they start living together John will want to tell him
“You were remembering a man,” he answers, in the careful style that Mycroft always answers. Sherlock doesn’t say anything back because Mycroft would have asked a question if he wanted that. But apparently Mycroft does want that, because he goes on tiredly afterwards: “How did you feel about it?”
“I always felt for you. Now it’s unbearable.” John wants to transmit his love to Sherlock’s supine bone-marrow through thermal radiation, to make Sherlock’s innards boil until soft touchable things are left over. He loves Sherlock. He loves him. He does not think this will ever, ever change.
“Lock the door after me, will you, Sherlock?” she reminds him patiently when enough has been said about her various dealings and disasters. Quiet and hedonistic, the man only mutters, and Irene leaves him picking idly at his fine sleeve, silhouetted beautifully against the wash of light from his large living-room window.
“I saw a gray man,” he says carefully, which is not enough to go on with that look in Irene’s eyes. “He was short and I lay on top of him before my head exploded. I also spoke to him before. I know I did and he looked up at me like I was very precious. Then on some other occasion we were together in a windowed room with nice dark wallpaper and he was angry, but I don’t know why. Who was this man.”
“To go quiet,” he replies, and knows John recognizes the words. “I need to take something – no, not like that,” he snaps, when John’s eyebrows shoot up. “I’ve got to let something inside. I need a case to declutter my head, understand? I need it to be sterile.” There’s been no other time that Sherlock’s spoken like this to another person. He’s saying most of it so John talks back to him, he wants to hear if this is what John means as well, but John seems to be rather loath to go on so Sherlock doesn’t push anything, just speaks until an interruption becomes likely. “Sometimes,” he says, “it feels like things inside my brain are rubbing against together. Small abrasions. I want to spill out all over something else as if I were very full and very cold.”
“I want to be invaded,” John hears himself say, and almost at the same time Sherlock mutters “I know.”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock says. Love for Mycroft is distant interference. Irene doesn’t love him, but her parcels of intimacy are good and gentle. It is difficult to reconcile this data with John’s tight-jawed avoidance, which is so perfectly categorical that Sherlock has taken it for contempt, or with his obvious pain.
, of me telling him we're not involved, would be that John drops the matter, disillusioned and irritated by my banality, and exits with further evidence that I am an Incurable Sociopath. This outcome could convince him finally that I am not interested in women, or that I've never felt any hidden love for Irene, but it would definitely work against the purpose of this conversation (namely, becoming tolerable to John Watson) and is therefore openly Negative. (It might not even achieve the first result, since he'd still have Janine as a Very Heterosexual example.) The second outcome would be that John becomes even more curious and pressures me further, in which case I'd either lie or repeat the truth – the first would carry me back to the beginning of the deductive cycle and into a new realm of possibilities, the second only to the previous step, which leads to the outcomes I am already listing: This one is Neutral, as far as Neutral goes. Still not worth the risk. The third, and most devastating, is that John becomes even more angry with me because he thinks I'm lying to his face in a transparent attempt to conceal an affair that he believes he's already worked out, and that he thinks I know he knows about; it would make him feel both insulted and rejected that I would still be trying so feebly to hide the existence of a lover from him: He would believe it to either be a lack of trust, a lack of affection, or an underestimation of his perceptiveness. Or maybe he'd attribute it to my being an Incurable Sociopath. In any case, this outcome is dangerously Negative. Conclusion: I will not tell John Watson the truth.
“You’ve bought the wrong kind,” he whines, his voice so unnatural in the room that for a second he stops and thinks about what his life was like before this. The walls are also white. They’re as white as glass, really, which Sherlock remembers having cut himself on once, looking at the soft round face of a small small man –
So he takes Sherlock one night and it's not the same night: Sherlock's Belstaff kisses the upholstery and his feet tap all over the flooring, and his elbow's in the window and his finger at his mouth, tapping and tapping the bruising of John's face. John's face is bruised because he did something a little unreasonable with a man in a suit in a pub in a fight, and came out with the wings of his jaw blotted with purple. The man had been reluctant to do anything but John was very tired, and he feels that after the two initial punches something bad left him through the ruptured veins of his cheek and mandible. This is why he now drives Sherlock out of the streets and out into the country and promises to buy Mrs. Hudson some gas, as his friend watches the nocturnal slip of the prairie, the bit-small parts in the grass, as they rush past him in a mute blur. John is very glad this is new Sherlock and wants to kiss him again, they haven't kissed since that original kiss and god he wants to kiss new Sherlock again, because he's watching it all with some sort of mild awe that old Sherlock could never have mustered for something like this. John has always been one for unassuming beauty. Sherlock's nose is flushed rose with cold.
“I don’t know,” John finds himself laughing. “You would look at my sleeves or collar or the mud on my shoes, or something, and tell me I would be developing a cold and that my third patient had heart disease.”
The screen went dark. Sherlock's gaze shot to Mycroft for the barest second, looking to see how he was standing; he caught a glimpse of his brother's eyes, wished for a glimpse of John's.
you, and she’s alive.” Oh, he's very angry. It's got to do with Mary, the whole conversation has been about her. I'm disappointed, this is not something I'd factored in his possible motivations but it seems I really should have, it's the only one that makes sense. He's past the physical catharsis stage and must now show himself in no unclear terms how little I care for love; this whole ordeal is making me appear as if I know nothing of the value of a lover, and this perceived coldness will make it even easier for him to hate me for what I've done, because he'll think I didn't understand the weight of my vows in the first place. Christ, John, you're exhausting. “Do you have the first idea how lucky you are?” Right, here we go, I didn't want to have seen that one coming but there it is. “Yes, she’s a lunatic, she’s a criminal, she’s
“You keep thinking about it,” Sherlock says, eyes light as grass on John’s. “It’s clogging everything up.”
"Can we trust her?" he insists to Mycroft, who looks increasingly bored. Mycroft now shows some emotions to John, although John suspects them to be cleverly-manufactured expressions that indicate to him what Mycroft tires of stating.
John's response was swallowed by Mycroft's reappearance, a few guards with him carrying a stretcher. He motioned for Sherlock to place Eurus on the white cotton. The woman's fingers had tightened on his clothes with death; painstakingly he freed them, laying her out as carefully as possible. He didn't know why this had suddenly become so different, or his actions so tender. It bothered him.
The mild heat of his sister's fingers. Her gaze had been magnetic as he'd asked her how she'd left; they had spoken a dead language, Sherlock was always weak for cleverness, she had once made him scream all night and greeted morning with a smile. He could feel John's smallest movements through the stretch of his carpal bone, Eurus' eyelids fluttering in slow motion. He wanted John to disappear. The strings of Eurus' instrument thrummed beautifully in flesh memory, her skin gentle and damp on Sherlock's neck as she choked him.
“If he’s worse than what you’ve imagined him to be? Or better?” Mycroft raises an eyebrow. “What if he expects you to understand him? You will cope, John.”
She was quiet as Sherlock waited for her. His mind slouched slowly into thought, almost involuntarily, old senses crowding his head in quick succession. He recalled the slide of Eurus' violin under his fingers, Irene Adler's theme rising thinly into the stillness.
“You’re part of the silence,” Sherlock says, which is repetitive but John feels rabid. “We’ve – I have –” There’s a pause. “I’ll guess it’s still deliberate.”
There's a good boy. I think he's curious, it's always best when John's curious, he tries things I'd never imagine. Well, that's not true, I would imagine quite a bit, but the way he tries them is nothing short of masterful. I'll keep my eyes lowered just so he doesn't sense what I'm thinking, which is a probable accident – I'm not in very good shape after all. “Talk about what?” Yes, there we go, let's draw it out.
"That was before you gave her a promise," John said, looking like he would very much like to rub a hand over his face, forcefully, taking off much of his skin.
“I know,” he says. He is looking at John in minor consternation. “Try if you like. I don’t need for you to show me affection, like Irene says you should. Not if it’s not honest.”
he deduced that I had a hand in her rescue? It'd be just like John to think it, to think of me as that white knight, but perhaps not in light of recent events – Bad thought, moving on, this is not the time or place to deal with that again. I'm here right now to puzzle over John Watson and the responses and emotions that always hit me where I won't see them. I wasn't expecting him to punch me that first night I returned from the dead, but so he did: I still cherish the memory. It was less harrowing than when he beat me in the mortuary, which I think was one of the very worst things we've done together. It was still better than silence.
John keeps staring, then catches himself and looks away. “That,” he says, “is exactly what you would have said.”
"It's far safer than love," Sherlock says, and John's mouth looks unpleasant, "but I like that too, that's good too, I understand this is love."
His time with Sherlock is trying, but not bad. The infatuation has washed off his interactions with him, leaving behind a solid, burning understanding that John suspects is very likely to turn to affection. He is no longer treated to Sherlock's old, glazed facade, and must contend with the rest of him now opened to his hands, warm and solid like a stone. Sherlock's extremities are warm and solid but John feels the rest to be fragile and young, so he does his utter best to be delicate, but he has grown very rusty. This is not a love he is familiar with.
Irene is placing little touches on his wrists. Sherlock knows that this should be unfamiliar, all this physicality, but he is no longer the same person and understands simple gestures of affection. He also knows that this is not just affection, but neutrality, and their existence together with Irene is more of a mutual toleration in which he is treated and petted like a cat, an arrangement of surprising dullness that he vaguely enjoys. He likes feeling so obviously appreciated.
“I have never loved anyone like you,” John says, looking into Sherlock’s eyes for what seems like the first time in ages. “You gave up the most precious thing in the world for me, but I loved you before that. I loved you enough to kill for you, to die for you, to endure exasperating solitude because that was who you were. And then,” he grits his teeth, un-grits his teeth, looks at the floor, looks at his face, “then you did me one better and actually got yourself shot for me, protecting me.” He lifts his gaze from a nearby clock and fixes it onto Sherlock’s, and Sherlock sees with some surprise that John is livid, his hands trembling with thinning control. “How could you do it, Sherlock?” he asks terribly. “How could you do this – for me? You thought it was for me, but Sherlock,” he looks at the wall, “I would rather be dead a thousand times over if it meant you were still here like you were, like you used to be here. Not because you were brilliant, although that was part of it – not only because you’re a genius, and you help people, and are a better – a better thing than I ever was, or could ever be. No, Sherlock, I wanted you to live because I love you, and I would give up suns and nights for you so you would go on doing what you did. I would go back and change things so I’d never have met you if it meant you would’ve survived it all. And yes, I know you did survive.” He makes an effort to look at Sherlock. Sherlock feels weird. “But I loved you so much I didn’t want you to, like this. I loved you then and I love you now. I was terribly afraid that I’d love you now. And God, Sherlock, I do.”
"I'm not going to give you one. I'm sorry I said that, I'm bad with endearments. I just – come here."
“I want you to make me feel myself,” Sherlock announces one day as John’s making coffee against another counter. They seem to have so many counters. John stops what he’s doing.
“I thought you were out,” John snarls, almost to himself, banging things down in a way that wreaks havoc with Sherlock’s brain-shell. “With one of whomever doing god-knows-what, but
“Power?” Keen understanding flashes over Sherlock’s face. “Is that what you find in – John,” he says, “you’re afraid you won’t know which one of us is doing what, aren’t you? You’re afraid that you’ll be pitying me, or I’ll be pitying you, or that I’ll be vulnerable –”
“You’re delightful,” John says abruptly. “There you are. You’re delightful and I’m very afraid, and that’s what’s making me quiet.”
"Did I use to live here?" Sherlock's fingers trail over the wall, then he clasps his hands primly in front of him. "You were angry with me here. You were sitting against a hard screen, except it wasn't the screen but the light that was sort of hard, it shone right into your face and sometimes mine and I ate something here. And I had my dressing gown."
"This island?" she said dangerously. Sherlock had the sense that she had watched him interact with John in predatory detail. "As thrilling as your offer is, little brother, I think I've gone a ways past this island by now." Her eyes took on a sharp, vulgar glint. "Wouldn't you like John to get some medical attention?"
They obeyed without question. Sherlock wondered where she would be buried, absently, before letting the event wash away in the knowledge that now he would have to face John once again.
Sherlock is quiet for so long that John thinks he's sleeping. At last, he says, "You should tell me about him."
“How does what work?” Still playing it safe. Will he get bored now? Can't look up yet, but – oh, he smiled, now that's just odd. Watson, you're completely mad. That was a flicker of a smile but it was a smile right there, I think I can risk looking at him now – no, nope, not when he's said “You and the Woman?” like that. That line calls for theatrics, a sigh and drop of the eyes is what I'll need. This is just too fascinating, seeing John's psyche like this; is he really so interested in what I think of her, or is it my availability that troubles him? Can't be that one, there's an utter lack of motivation there: He knew me to be perfectly available for two years and still went and married Mary Morstan. Granted, I was decidedly unavailable when that whole thing got started, but I did manage to reappear just as sprucey and fuckable before they tied the knot. Granted, I must not have seemed as fuckable when I'd just put him through so much emotional pain, but there was a bit of time for recovery between that and the wedding – I helped plan it. And
"Sh," he says. "It's alright." His doctorliness overrides everything else. Sherlock is stretched flat on his stomach on his bed, manouevred there by John from his slouch on the sofa, a move that was very awkward and has left them very stilted. Sherlock seems to suspect something very undesirable on the horizon, which John wishes he could say he never has brought around, but it would be a rather big lie, he thinks.
,” John whispers, looking agonized. His fingers on the tabletop go still. “I’m so sorry you had to see that.”
makes his eyelid stutter, for instance, and when Sherlock first said his name John had tensed jaw-to-hip with indefinable terror. He doesn’t do that as often now, because Sherlock loves saying his name so much, and he realizes he has become bland and soft and dull, really, but John is willing to ignore this all the time. Sometimes he feels a keening sorrow at the distant understanding that he has lost something spectacular. He sees that this is what keeps John from looking into his eyes.
He knows John won’t say it forty seconds after meeting him, and by the end of that night he’s sure neither of them will ever sleep again. They order too much food and the light is very dim, and Sherlock imagines for a second that John is going to say something
“You know what I mean.” John turns to face him. “You are not obliged to be anything other than Sherlock, now, and hang Sherlock Holmes if he’s simply not around. It’s frankly ridiculous that I’m mourning him when he’s right in front of me,” he says quietly. “Sherlock, it’s alright. Just do whatever you like. This is my problem that I’m dealing with – I don’t expect anything.”
John turns around with a peculiar frown, letting his weight sag onto one elbow on the table. “What?”
Sherlock, for his part, is home. He is perceiving things in a very new way, a keen sense of past awareness pervading his tunnel vision. He stands straight-backed and lonely close to the door, looking as if he has forgotten to sit down.
There are no cases for a few days and they’re catatonic. Sherlock’s catatonic and John still moves. And then Sherlock sits up and does things with his body, and John comes up to him and makes him speak a few words.
Time slowed down. The world shattered into sharp crystals, John's face staring up at him through the crush like an animal. It took a crazed moment for him to locate the wound and another to press a cold palm to John's cheek.
“So this is usual,” John mutters as they push into the ravaged flat, and Sherlock’s skin tingles because this finally sounds interesting. He can feel the boredom creeping up over the outer ridges of his skull, and knows that in a few hours, a few days, it will take over like the plague. He hates this about cases – the morning-after of it, the slug of apathy that will turn his brain to lead
“Just text her back.” John, give me more to work with. I'll have to produce another inane prompt now. “Why?”
“I think about it, yes,” John says, deciding not to avoid the obvious. “But I – you have to know, I’d never – ”
“Do use your imagination,” he bites out, irritated beyond reason. All he’s said looks to have been in vain, and what Sherlock wants now is to get away from John again. “I’d been hoping you’d at least make an effort to understand.”
Not Available. Observation Three: On both occasions, Sherlock Holmes regains his mental and corporal strength only after John Watson has returned and then guaranteed both his continued presence and his forgiveness. Conclusion: John Watson is the aforementioned romantic interest. It's child's play, John has to have understood it by now. My contrariness has produced stellar results, so I'll continue with that until he finally gets it. “That doesn't even mean anything.” Do go on and contradict me, I'll never be more glad to be proven wrong.
"She wasn't a part of Moriarty," John said incredulously. "She wasn't a tool, the way Mycroft thought her to be. She was human."
“Yes.” Sherlock’s cheeks are beautiful. His chin is sharp and that’s beautiful, the weird jut of his collarbones are beautiful, his nose and ears and slight tilt of head are all so beautiful that John just says it, John will never not say it after this mad, mad day. John will say it every second until he bursts, and he won’t say it ever again if it makes him burn out of his skin like this.
"You killed my best friend," he said. The realization tore through him; he felt fractured and desensitized with what had fallen into place. "John -"
“Yes, you do,” he says, hating how stupid it sounds. “You hate me because I’m not like I was. It’s okay, I understand,” he adds. “I hate me too.”
"Do I?" Sherlock wonders. John's face is lit out with deep gold light. It has seeped through the rafters and the shutters and is now kissing his face very, very gently. "Yes, I do, I think."
“He remembers getting shot.” Mycroft, usually so tactful, is now sparing John no detail, and the rawness of it all makes him want to capsize again. “He thinks he died. I asked him why he thought so, and he said it was like burning the inside of his head, ‘with something really hot that made me go hot too.’”
He's chuckling. I don't know whether to be alarmed or pleased with myself. Does it mean he's happy that I don't care for her romantically? That he's amused by the extent of my Incurable Sociopathy? Has he gone completely off his rocker? I thought we were having a serious conversation. Or maybe these chuckles are building up to something violent, I think that's most likely. I'll tuck in my limbs a little as a precaution in case he starts to hit me again. “Why not?” He's pacing, and now he's stopped and is looking at me with a
I can't be optimistic enough to think he's pleased I'm Available. “You bloody moron!” Definitely not pleased. Should stare at him now, give him some validation – it would also help to see exactly when he decides to punch me, bracing for impact and all that. “She's out there, she
“That is how you see it.” Sherlock’s tone brooks no argument, and John can’t get around to making any. “I will not have sex with you if you see it that way.”
to be.” That was beautiful, and he's beautiful, and there's nothing I want to do more than make him stop feeling like this. He's crying now. Should I comfort him? For once I don't want to deduce my way through this. If I calculate the risks there's no way I'll do what I intuitively know is the right thing. Well, perhaps that's also a part of deduction, seeing that intuition is only what I perceive in limited consciousness; John's stance, his vulnerability, the knowledge of his suffering have coupled with my primal instinct to touch. He might reject me, but I'll take it. His face is getting closer, he smells so familiar, I'll have to fight not to cry as well if I smell this for long. I'm moving quite slowly so it must seem very alien, but I don't think he's in a position to make assumptions about this. I just don't want to startle him.
“Sherlock,” John says, and stops. This is going to be difficult. “Sherlock,” he tries again. “Sherlock, I’m not interesting.”
They break apart when it becomes weird not to think. Sherlock might like quiet, but he doesn't much like silent, so when he extends a long wrist a short distance into John he feels he should really stop, because it was far too automatic to be comfortable. He could slowly, slowly shake John off but he doesn't want to do that, so instead he speaks into his mouth
He pushes his fingers right into John’s cheeks, feeling the warmth, and then smushes one thumb against John’s temple to see if he can sense some sort of blood. John is perfectly still and perfectly silent. Sherlock wants to form a cage around his eyelids so he does, he slots his fingerpads all over John’s jaw and browline and squeezes, at first tenderly, an odd possessiveness creeping through him. It occurs to him in some basement floor of his brain that this is dangerous, and John could be hurt if he presses any harder. But he doesn’t stop until the thought really pulses, and John is still not moving so he only regretfully slides his hands off him.
Another time, rather more advisably, they discuss the possibility of John spending another night over. John has recently been confined to a bedsit much like the first, Mycroft not having felt particularly lavish with his living arrangements, which suits him just fine. But time with Sherlock is getting more comfortable; they don’t just orbit each other like foreigners, they eat and watch television and even chat with Mrs. Hudson sometimes, who has understood that things are transforming in the flat above her and very rarely drops in. It is Sherlock who makes the overture, and John stomps up the stairs to find fresh sheets for his bed, and he eats breakfast the next day in the presence of large, white ex-detective idling in the chair opposite. The thick, stinking fog in John’s movements slowly clears away as he has his toast under a morning that crawls in through the shutters and crawls into the seams of his coarse coarse mouth, his body going softer and softer as the night fades out. He associates a lot of things with light, he knows, he watches Sherlock very often and in various shades of darkness. He likes how it fills out Sherlock’s face, when the dark is water-thin and only just smeared around a fleshed-out halo of golden light. He loves his friend so dearly that it plays down onto his heart-strings when the sun flashes into his eyes like this. He knows as he eats his toast that he loves his friend all the time, but this love is difficult to distill properly from all the other good things in his life. Like Sherlock being alive. When he realizes this, he puts his toast down and plants a kiss on Sherlock’s clearwater forehead, bending down in benediction as the man closes his eyes in trust.
“Not as intensely. I –” John isn’t looking at him back. “I’m actually wondering if this affection, all this affection, is for you – or which you it’s for – I’m not very clever, emotions overwhelm me.”
“What is?” he remembers to add. His voice sounds deeper than usual, and John turns sharply to face Sherlock where he’s still standing by the door.
Sherlock did not have the necessary will to talk about this. The room had once again grown very quiet. Eurus, it seemed, was listening now; it was just as well, there could be no doubt now of his feelings for John. There remained only one thing to say, and Sherlock's anger tumbled out from between his hard teeth.
, of course. Should've been very odd in that house with Mycroft looking after things. But lonely? Sherlock, it would take more than Victor Trevor for something like
really, it's painfully obvious now, I hate the lag in my reasoning today. All his Irene Adler anger was his own guilt and suffering, reflected in commands and admonishments – I really have failed to read this man. It's still best to let him talk, but I do hope my face hasn't betrayed shock: He'll definitely misread that and think I'm judging him. Come to think of it, I haven't thought a moment about the actual content of what he's said; it was slightly interesting, yes, now that I think about it, but he looks like he's in too much pain for me to really have that morbid interest coming on. I'd just as soon he didn't tell me if he'll suffer because of it.
“Do you want to go home yet?” Sherlock twists over himself to drink, brow furrowed. His legs are long and terrifically white against the dark lining of the sofa.
John pauses. He pauses. "Sherlock," he whispers. His chest and diaphragm hum into Sherlock's web of ribs, and Sherlock thinks every cell of his sacral skin is now attuned to the particular pitch of John's voice as he says the name, and addresses Sherlock as he is for the first time in eons.
"Babe," he says. It sounds weird and inappropriate to Sherlock being Sherlock, so he stops. "Sherlock," he tries again. "Come here."
“I’d never seen that man before,” Sherlock explains patiently, “but I felt like I knew him.” He considers. “He felt very warm and very painful.”
“Perhaps tender isn’t the right word,” John reflects. “Stolidly caring is better. I am spindly sometimes, you know – although nowhere as spindly as you could be – but I am, and I’m irritable, and self-indulgent. I’m a bad writer. You told me that, and I sort of resented it. I’m sorry that everything I’m saying right now is about me, but I don’t know how else to go on, and I guess you would have said that it’s because I think of myself too often. But that’s something you’d never have said. Back then I wasn’t like this, I wasn’t so – cloistered, and wrong in the head. You would have called me dependable.”
“But it was wrong,” John goes on. “I don’t hate you, Sherlock. I love you. I – love you, more than I can bear under the circumstances.”
Mycroft is neither pleased nor displeased and moves Sherlock's meager inventory in without comment. Irene, it is decided, will visit them at the flat sometimes, and Sherlock will putter off to hers when he wants to, and for this arrangement she and John suffer a tense introduction during which John wonders whether this woman has had sex with Sherlock, and Irene knows what he's wondering. Irritated and overwhelmed with all the people and changes he must now endure after such a long hiatus, John confronts Mycroft as to her presence and background; Mycroft rebuffs him with a few cool remarks about her importance as an "extragovernmental figure", which John takes to mean "state Moriarty". Later, he searches her name, and the images he finds convince him that the British government is completely and utterly deranged.
John gets up. He sits back down. He stares. Sherlock has walked in and is now surveying the blinds with interest, John has installed weird blinds instead of his good curtains, Sherlock is watching the room with such idleness that John itches. His eyes meet John's, and he smiles a soft, vague smile, replaced quickly by a shadow of his old, intent look.
"Say you're all right," he heard himself mutter, his hands grazed over John chest and chin, terrified suddenly of touching the squish of a bullet in his shoulder. "John, say you're not hurt." The clanging had stopped; Mycroft was lingering once again in the background, and Sherlock could sense his quiet assessments as they waited for John's voice to waft up from the floor.
“None of this is about you,” Mycroft says smoothly, so John can hear the edges of each word. “Do what you like, John. He’s – improving. And it means that – one day – he’ll know.”
is the question, but it won’t ever really have an answer, because in love for Sherlock is not in love for John is not for people outside their little huddle. John finds he doesn’t mind.
John looks away at Sherlock's groaning ineloquence. "Yes," he says again. It occurs to him that he is being less luculent than Sherlock is, but Sherlock was a genius, so he supposes he would be higher-functioning anyway. He realizes for the first time that he does not actually know what Sherlock's problem is. A bullet has eaten through part of his brain, and this has happened because he wanted to protect John from bad people, and before his brother could intervene he was shot in the head. Now he is slowly improving after a long drought, but John has not taken the time to consider the real nature of this drought, and even now curses his hands for itching to take parts of Sherlock home with him.
The shot rocked Eurus in his arms, her jaw digging into his collarbones with the force of the bullet. John jerked in place with shock. Blood trickled down onto Sherlock's fingers, warm and terrible; he would not stop holding her.
. Their evasions have been horribly dull so all Sherlock’s said has been true; John has deflected and eaten and deflected and Sherlock’s just watched him out the corner of his eye, uncertain. John sometimes looks very young, he thinks. But his flatmate won’t
"You got what you wanted," he told her. "You've seen what I think of him. You've stopped me from dying. But John is still here, which is just as well - " He stared right into Eurus' inexplicable eyes. "If he had died, you would never have left this island alive."
and nothing more. In fact, I think he's still going on about the treasures of romantic living – do shut up, John, it's always tiring to listen to a lecture over again. “And that’s how this works. That’s what you’re missing.” He looks quite nice in that light, I wish he was saying something interesting. “She taught me to be the man she already thought I was. Get yourself a piece of that.”
John is staring. John is leaving the room. John is coming back. John is kissing him, and kissing him, and feeling like he is violating the privacy of an invalid, which hurts Sherlock. John is feeling like he is taking advantage of Sherlock, which is very disturbing, so Sherlock does his best to respond although it’s difficult because he hasn’t kissed anyone that he remembers and he doesn’t remember ever really liking semisexual touches.
"Are you alright?" John says finally, pushing Sherlock away. His fingers are working at Sherlock's collar. It's a stupid question so he drops to his knees, he loves the slight blankness of John's stare, and when he blows soft air all over John's crotch that stare becomes positively feral. He wants to acquaint John's penis very closely with his mouth, and trails lip and tongue all over the harsh denim as John's thumbs dig into his jaw. He's looking up at John and John's looking down at him, expression checkered with wonder, so he undoes the button and undoes his flies and finally dips down to love John's liver, except what he's loving is not a liver but his cock. John's good for it and at the end pushes Sherlock down, flat onto the ground, penis slipping out of Sherlock's mouth with a pop and coming to burn on Sherlock's thigh as he peels each article of clothing off him. Sherlock understands something primeval when John starts to suck his nipple. He understands a whole field of pain when John's palm straggles over his erection. When John's cock slots against his, turned bare, Sherlock understands why this is an act of love. John's panting. Sherlock feels the tightness in his scrotum and runs a thin hand over them together, quickly, pumping and stroking until John comes onto his shirt, groans through the semidarkness and bites the place where Sherlock's neck meets his shoulder. Sherlock shouts. His voice is very rich and loud and John kisses the shit out of it.
“I don’t know,” John answers honestly. It’s been about forty minutes, and he’s gotten warm and drowsy with so much limb on his body. “Like I said, you were always rather unpredictable. I think you might have, but only extremely urgently, if you’d thought I’d never manage anything on my own, or if we were dying together.” He scratches the back of his hand. “But then it wouldn’t have been so casual. You were always cold, but I think if it had been that dire it would have been more passionate and invasive than – what you just did. Maybe you would’ve done it in a really ordinary way, one evening when we were sitting like this together, and you would have met my eyes in your unusual manner of looking, I think, and I wouldn’t have been able to say anything. I would have loved you then, but been angry as well. We would never have spoken about it like we are now. But yes, I think you would have done it. Although I would never know why. I never knew what was going on in your head at any time.”
"I'm never going to forget it," he told John. "It will never have been easy for me. Not for Mycroft, either."
John smiles a little and nuzzles his head against Sherlock's temples. They both know Sherlock's mad, and might never be able to mean love in the common, obdurate way. They know John would never ask for it, and that Sherlock's fascination is love enough, and perhaps one day his packaged affection will be just enough to drown in. John thinks this and Sherlock feels he's thinking it, and instead of biting they lie together. It's as good as ever possible. John thinks it's too good for the world.
Oh, shit. Did he just say that? It must be the drugs, but that's not possible, it's been long enough since my last dose. Well, it could be possible, it's happened before, there was that bride mystery that went on in the plane before John came to get me; maybe I've completely lost it and this whole scene's just an elaborate self-construction for quiet comfort. That is a possibility I cannot reject, but for the sake of sanity I'll have to disregard it for the moment: If I begin to analyze all my past and present actions in this manner I'll never be certain of anything. I could've sunk into this self-controlled mind game at any point in my life. And who's to say such delusions wouldn't be as real as anything else? I do feel everything after all. My senses are quite adept and I can think just as clearly. I could kiss John right now, get up and do it and feel his heart rate stutter, and that would feel real and that's enough. I don't have time at the moment to further analyze the nature of reality, but I don't think I'll reach any new conclusions: The existence of any one thing, event, moment or conversation cannot be proven by any method of deduction as it would by default involve all the deductive tools of the thinker in question, and the deduction would only be valid for the frame in which it was made, which would make it impossible to work out the qualities of the frame itself. But I'm diverging painfully from the actual issue here, which is that John Watson has just told me in no harsh terms that I need a lover to be whole; I'm waiting for the inevitable deductive leap here – he
The next few days are ordinary enough to make Sherlock crawl out of his skin, but there’s a new mystery at hand so he doesn’t mind as much as he should have. John’s words have been carefully shelved away, and sometimes Sherlock thumbs over them, trying to make sense of it all. It’s not that they’re inexplicable; he’s devised six different explanations for them out of hand, each in some way connected to his PTSD, or the spliced chaos of war, or the hard moral streak that gets more and more obvious in John as time passes – the looks he gives strangers, his expression when writing up cases, all conducive to whatever theory Sherlock would like to carry further – vigilante-image-fulfillment, comfort-in-righteousness, pleasure-of-the-hunt, familiar-memories, and so on until he exhausts the list and starts repeating himself. Sherlock hates when he does that. He doesn’t like the conversation because it’s surprising in content, but in presence: John has articulated a very specific feeling, very much like what Sherlock craves in each new puzzle. He wants to go quiet, wants that detachment to pulse through him, mind sharp and shoulders sharp and turned in over the mystery so his neurons stop rubbing together. Sherlock wonders if this is what John really means, and it’s enough to coast him over a couple of the worst hours to watch his flatmate do normal things, like eating and sleeping and talking to Mrs. Hudson. John doesn’t know much about the sleeping, but Sherlock doesn’t take pains to hide it – he has a feeling John would only protest to have protested, and once they were over the perfunctory sensitivities Sherlock suspects he might be rather alright with the whole thing. So he watches for a good time to ask him about it again, but it doesn’t come until another two days and four hours have passed and the John issue isn’t enough to hold Sherlock together anymore. He’s been folded into a corner of his room for a long time, as far away from the outer noises as possible, finding ways to scratch out the contents of his skull with whatever rudimentary tools he has – old cases, crammed into a nook of the brain, and incomplete deductions, but it all burns through his cells like wax and he can’t help but want to take something apart. John notices two days and fifteen hours into his seclusion and tears the place up with his loudness, which Sherlock wants him to stop, so he shouts as John wrestles him into the kitchen and into a chair and some toast where the light is too white and too sharp, and won’t eat any of the hateful things John plies him with. He feels gorgeously incorporeal, and knows that food will force him to feel that he has a body, and that the body is so intensely out of himself.
“As in my head. The whorls of my head. We talk a lot about head but I think you have it. I want you to tell me something good.”
“That’s surprising,” he says. It feels like they’re going through the motions, as always, because when Irene finishes her one glass of dry red she’ll worry her teeth through her mouth. The man’s beautiful, she thinks, but he’s
There was a moment's hesitation, and then Mycroft nodded. Sherlock had no patience left; he shoved the weapon into his brother's hands. "And the others."
That's me, John, you're describing me in this obnoxious wilderness, it's you who's made me into the creature I am now – all gentle and virile – I folded
“God, Sherlock – I am, I do.” John’s tone has changed; he sounds agitated. “But what do you want me to say? I can’t condone something that hurts you like this.”
"I did my best, John." He knew he must seem absurdly emotional, the night closing down around him and his myriad outbursts, his demonstrations of love.
"I think you excuse it by wheedling on about how miserable you are, and how irrevocable Sherlock's condition is, and how you should have died or he should have died, and it's tiring. Sherlock is here to be loved, and after what has been taken from him – what he gave up, for love – he has not much else to do. He cannot handle too much, as he could not before, but he will focus much more directly on expressions of affection, and finds it wonderful to be acknowledged."
“What were you thinking about?” It’s not something he’d usually ask, but this time Sherlock’s silence has been far too familiar, almost inclusive, as if he were coating John as well in a thin, unobtrusive veil against the various ups and downs of the world; a delicate tether that John still feels between them, weighing down the air between sofa and window.
It felt like a weak bargain. Sherlock was guessing, pure and simple; his focus was distorted, he felt John's breath against his thumb. He had no leverage, no plan, and the terrible disadvantage of being only the third cleverest person in the room. Eurus would see through him like water.
“What about me?” Excitement, the likes of which he has not felt in eons, pounds through his thoracic cavity. It is also unusual but not as unsettling as Mycroft and his modes of love.
“Because you were my friend,” John says painstakingly. “And you weren’t interested. And now you’re my friend and you can’t be interested, you understand, you can’t just – and then there’s the balance of power –”
Irene Adler. He's talking to me about Irene Adler. Should've known, always messy, John's never had a knack for making the best of a situation. He thinks I love her, always has and always will, and I've never moved to correct him so I believe the fault is mine. Can't resent her for sending that damn text, though – made him stay when I couldn't, bless her timing. I don't even care what she's said, it's probably something about one man or the other she's scared half to death, it's usually those stories that she likes to share. It's a special occasion, she will have found something appropriate – I'm sure, actually, that I'd enjoy reading it sometime. But it wouldn't be now, not when John's like this, so I don't understand why he won't let off about it – does he actually want Irene and I to be together? I sit a little more loosely in the chair, he'll pick up on that and think I'm opening to the conversation so I can learn what he wants from me. Pull a shoulder back very softly, that's right, his reaction will be intuitive if I know my Watson at all.
John presses his mouth together, and suddenly looks very, very old. He turns and leaves Sherlock in the semidarkness, to wonder at his wild luck as the boredom seeps slowly out of him.
“Painful?” Mycroft looks very interested, and Sherlock sees that this interest isn’t pleasurable mild interest, or encouraging teacherlike interest, but hard and tense and focused.
At least his voice has grown softer. But what does that even mean? Is he alluding to the many stresses of marital life? The difficulty of maintaning a meaningful bond with another person under the weight of a commitment that compels you to reconsider any attempt you might have made to break with them over newly-revealed aspects of their personality, however shocking or life-changing those aspects may be? Is this his way of joking about Irene's colorful background? What an enigma this man is. I'll have to consider this reply carefully. I don't want to offend him by rejecting Irene any further, which is a strange turn after all my precious efforts to make him think exactly that, that I want to reject Irene but not the idea of a lover. Maybe if I do the exact opposite he'll think something else. It'll be a calculated risk; it's unlikely he'll walk away now, he's so heated up over the matter, and if I say something incendiary there's a real chance he'll betray some hidden emotion. Let's see how this plays out. “As I think I have explained to you
“I would have known either way. I would have known the same way I knew you existed before I knew your name. You itched like a separate lost person.” Sherlock rattles this off very quickly and knows it doesn’t make sense, but he is a shell of what he once was and is therefore entitled to questionable logic bridges.
That is in many ways both what I was and was not expecting. At least I had the sense to deduce who you were thinking of before you said this, so I can ask the right question. “Mary? How so?”
“Don’t be obtuse. You’re rather fascinating.” Sherlock’s focused each cell, the small luminescent edges of each cell into John, razor-sharp and glimmering with life. John suddenly feels stripped down to the marrow of the thinnest and most delicate of his bones, which he hopes Sherlock will some day take into his mouth out of love.
John nods as if this is natural and leaves, but he pulls a little on Sherlock's hair as he does so. Wondering slightly, Sherlock stays where he is. He thinks that if he liked John before and he likes him now, John – he doesn't know what has happened. John is not pretty, except when Sherlock gets used to his face, whereupon it becomes rather nice-looking in a homey, old-timey sort of way. John, as a person, is not pretty either: Sherlock supposes he used to be kind and good or something, but now he's self-absorbed and erratic with a weird, infernal resentment. Sherlock realizes for the first time that John might not actually be completely sane.
He expresses this opinion to Irene, someday. It pops out without warning. Irene has taken to being present around the flat, in no small part due to the fact that John and his benign smiles are abhorrent in the role of caretaker. She fixes him with the most intense stare he's experienced since Mycroft told him Sherlock was coming back, and he realizes he misses this force-field of intelligence incredibly.
His body was too close to Sherlock. He must have been moving right before, coming towards him with ill purpose. Sherlock turned, head hot and wild, to see where the bullet should have come from to hit John like that. There was a slot in the wall, he saw, angled just so against his friend's small body; the anger built up inside him, shuddering hard through the inner shell of his white skin. Distantly he knew that it had only been John's final move - a lunging step towards Sherlock, taken upon split-second decision - that had saved his life. He felt the strong urge to shoot the slot, but that would be terrible strategy; he would have to get John out of here alive, no matter how furious he was, and it called for better thinking than this. Sherlock moved quickly to the wall, knowing that from his position on the ground John would be safe at the present moment, and held out the gun to Mycroft. "Disable it."
When Mycroft comes again it is Monday, the twelfth of February, as he makes a point to tell John each time. John stopped keeping track after the second of January, last year, and does not appreciate the reminder that he has been perfectly insulated from the world for thirteen months. When Mycroft comes this time, however, he leans heavily on a highbacked chair and says “He’s started to remember.”
Now that sounds cheery. Well, maybe not cheery, but it's a far cry from offended, disgusted or betrayed, so I'll just respond in kind. Or perhaps not, I think it's time to move on with the conversation, I'll signal to him my utter disinterest in her while making it clear we're still in some form of contact. Life is, after all, just a really large compromise. “Oh, for God’s sakes. I don’t text her back.”
while there’s still a chance, because that chance doesn’t last forever. Trust me, Sherlock: it’s gone before you know it.” I'm going to kill myself. Dear God, John, don't be so daft – why are we back to square one again? I thought we were past this. Maybe I should be listening for other hints in what you're saying – no, right now you're repeating your last four words, but with more emphasis – I guess this is a reflection of how much you still suffer because of Mary. Well, I'm being very selfish, I see that now – you're in such emotional pain and I'm only thinking of myself. That's typical but I wasn't doing it on purpose; I want to comfort you now but I don't know how to. I'll just let you talk some stuff out, and then we'll see how I can be useful. I'm sorry for being an arsehole but it's difficult to think when you've a fixed conclusion – I've made a deductive mistake and I can only attribute that to your involvement in the situation.
“Will he be alright?” John can’t help asking. John is all parceled out and cannot tell anything from anything else, he has not set foot outside the flat for months. He still carries parts of Sherlock draped over him.
"Yes," John lies. Mycroft will handle it, he's sure. If not, he thinks the streets will be a good change. He thinks of gravel. It could bite into his cheeks and crawl into his jumpers as he scrubs and scrubs his skin over the walls, leaving traces of himself scattered through London, London carried onto his rawline body. He knows these thoughts are utterly unwholesome and stops because he feels them to be undoctorly.
“Somewhere in the head.” He’s stripping off his jacket, looking vaguely unsettled. Sherlock rather likes this expression, it’s good and startling, John’s neck short and vivid in the dusky light. He’s still looking at Sherlock, and Sherlock’s looking back, and John’s eyes have grown almost luculent.
“What do you need?” he asks. Sherlock swirls around in his mind before it hits him that he might just get some answers now, and part of the havoc clears.
Sherlock nods, used to Mycroft’s helping prompts. This time, however, Mycroft doesn’t answer as quickly as he has when supplying Sherlock with all his other crucial bits of information. He stares at Sherlock’s face, then turns back to his other affairs with a queer stillness to his mouth. “I am certain,” he says, “that you know.”
"It is as I informed you that night, and twice after. He is now a nonentity." Mycroft seems to have lost all his tolerance for John now that he has to face Sherlock continuously, and John understands this is his due and does not stop Mycroft from leaving.
"Comfortable?" he asks. When Sherlock nods, he slots a hand around the back of his neck and presses, humming slightly. It is unfamiliar, but correct, and he is humming out of pleasantness. Sherlock also seems to be feeling the same, because he shifts in bed to give John better access and rubs his curls over John's chest in a form of closeness. John is relieved he hasn't tried this before, lest he have ruined something so startlingly companionable.
Mycroft tipped his head at him. Sherlock knew he was right, but something stopped him from doing as he should; it felt obscene, unthinkable to simply stretch her out like a child. He didn't want to place her next to John, and didn't want her head to rest on the floor. Mycroft's chin tightened. He walked slowly in his untried steps to the exit Eurus had used; his right hand was trailing the wall, as quiet and deliberate as Eurus had been in her movements only minutes before.
