“Well than Mycroft will enjoy it.”
John nodded enthusiastically choking out a yes past his tears and blinding smile. Sherlock slipped the metal around his finger and kissed him breathless and hugged him softly. John laughed slightly as he looked at the ring of metal around his finger over Sherlock's shoulder.
A silhouette -that Sherlock could only hope was John- stood right before all the papers, frozen there before all the many photographs suspended from the ceiling.
“But John-“
John nods quietly rubbing at his eyes and slumping against Sherlocks chest on the verge of collapsing right there. Sherlock puts an arm under John's legs holding him to himself and stands carefully cradling him to his shoulder. He walks to their bedroom and pulls back the duvet on the bed and lays John down onto it. Sherlock’s about to stand when he realizes John hasn't let go of his shirt.
Sherlock tries to call John as he gets into his car and pulls out his laptop form under the seat. He checks the news and finds John is on BBC News with his band. He curses himself again as he gets out onto the road it'll take an hour or so but Sherlock could meet him at the ferry.
looking down at his body both eyes open now.
Sorry for late chapter, as I explained in the last one I have been traveling long distances by car and haven’t had much time. But here it is enjoy!
"For the syringe."
"How did you even get them?" John asked exasperatedly.
"That's not what people usually say." Sherlock said a bit oddly looking down.
“I used to help you work. Remember? Just you and me against the rest of the world..” John looked up at him and Sherlock noticed his skull on the mantle the wallpaper change that of the one of Baker Street. No, not now.
John looked as if in shock, his hands on his mouth and tears in his eyes where they were stuck to the window as he continued to cry out. Sherlock rushed to John falling to his knees, grabbing him and pulling him against his chest shielding him from the window which seemed to be the problem. John held to his shirt and sobbed in anguish as Sherlock held him close with a hand on the back of his head.
His body half dragging across the floor and walls trying to stay upright.
"No, absolutely not. She didn't do anything when she wasn't at bars she was going around and spending money Dad and I brought in. He was working hours and hours at the hospital and I was getting any job I could get, it hardly mattered what it was. Then I got into music and got discovered. The only time she did work was when- -from what I'm told- -I was two and Harry was 6. She used to work at a motor company I think, fixing and selling anything really. I'm pretty sure Dad told her she didn't have to work, that he'd do it all."
“What, with what. From the marks on John’s forearm a needle what was in it we couldn’t know without extensive bloodwork.” Sherlock says already not liking the idea.
He didn’t understand things like Sherlock did, nor did he have to. An example would be this situation, he knew that Sherlock knew what he was doing to some extent anyway and sometimes he just had to trust him and follow afterwards. He didn’t understand this Moriarty character although he knew that Sherlock did and could very well explain it if he had to even though he refused to.
Sherlock walked in and looked around he had been through John's room before but only just to get to the balcony. He hardly had the chance to look around. Now that he had the chance to Sherlock saw that the walls were practically bare and it seemed like nobody had ever moved in.
There was a loud noise, too quick and too slow, John watched as a bullet went through Moriarty barely a foot in front of himself and before he even saw what happened he was running to Sherlock. Because he was falling and the very short distance it would take for him to reach the rope around his neck and cut off oxygen and John knew every second would count from there.
“Yeah we were in different schools but they had the same campus. He was a bit like Sherlock actually, at the time helping the police out with mysterious cases and things. Anyway, I hadn’t actually met him yet but at the end of one term the day before we were to switch flatmates I remember I went to a party with my friend. There was all kinds of crap there ranging from alcohol to hard core drugs I never drank or took a thing knowing getting caught like that would destroy my future career as a cop. We were leaving so I drove and my friend was shaking I didn’t realize in time and he started to have a seizure in the car and I was freaking out and pulled over to try to figure out what was wrong while calling the police. When suddenly he went still and foam started coming out of his mouth, he died that night in my arms on the side of the road.” Greg took a moment to collect himself. John listened in half fascination and half sadness for his basically parent to have to go through that. “Then the police got there, they somehow thought I had poisoned him and I got framed for his murder. That’s when Mycroft showed up deduced the whole ruddy thing and got into his car and drove away. I was released and the killer was caught. I was astonished honestly underneath the grief and the police brought back to
“How did you find this out?” He grabs the remote and fiddles with the controls until it turns on. “What channel?”
“It’s none of them, you couldn’t have possibly caught him.”
Absolutely.
"Sherlock!" John yells as he rushes down the stairs still tugging on his jacket. Sherlock is in the street hailing a cab not having bothered to close the door. "Where the hell are you going?"
Sebastian was Jim’s anchor, keeping him steady and not letting him drift off into the sea of his father’s madness. But Sebastian was gone. Murdered, they said drive by but Jim knew better. His father had him killed, had him killed so Jim had to stay with John. Make John's life a living hell and he would.
“Sherlock that’s not true.” John protested annoyed that he was being a jerk for no reason, again.
Mycroft came off and on when his work schedule allowed, John knew that Mycroft was hurting a great deal himself having to see Sherlock this way. He’d told him that he would wake, Sherlock was strong and he would come back. Mycroft hadn’t replied then but he told himself that often, Sherlock was strong. He would wake up.
“What’s that noise?” Molly voice pulled him from his head. He listened to see what she was talking about and heard the distinct sound of an acoustic guitar coming from the wall beside his bed.
“Everything’s okay now.” Sherlock says softly rubbing John’s back gently holding him close offering what comfort that he could. He rests his head lightly atop Johns own, feeling him slowly relax in his arms.
He was a monster.
It was years into it when the spell broke. He knew it would happen eventually, knew the confines of this place couldn’t hold him forever, all it took was three words.
“Of course it will.” Sherlock said unconvincingly. “Alright, here we go.” He took a breath, opened Johns door and walked into his room slowly with the IV stand and the door shut behind him with a click leaving the two alone.
“Yes, just like always.” Sebastian says with a smile of his own.
“Not.. really.” Sherlock says uncertainly rubbing John’s back lightly. “It’s difficult to explain.”
“Hmm. Don’t have a ring.” Sherlock snips back.
I don’t have a beta so there may be mistakes, enjoy!
“I love you too, I love you....” Sherlock whispered into the linoleum his voice cracking and breaking off. Tears roll down his cheeks, the pain of not being able to tell John that was worse, that’s what would kill him.
He curses himself in every language he knows as he drives back. The whole ordeal is ridiculous and could be resolved with a phone call but John still won't pick up. He wishes more than anything he hadn't left maybe he would have more time to think and would have been able to talk to John sooner.
“Molly, if you could refrain from-“
“Yes, John?” Sherlock answers in question looking down at the sleepy child inquiringly.
He was afraid, afraid of what was to come, what Jim had to toture him with this time. He wished he could remember more, about what happened when his uncle died then they wouldn’t have to do this.
“I said I would and I did. Now you need to get up and put these on so we can leave, I can’t stand this place.” The man said quickly slightly irritated motioning to a pile of clothes on the foot of the bed. He made a move to leave and John quickly grabbed the man's wrist.
They were at the rugby tryouts now. John was trying out and completely owning the sport. He was definitely getting in, and looking amazing doing it.
John could hardly comprehend what he had heard. Sherlock had made breakfast and put paracetamol out in case his shoulder was hurting. How oddly considerate. That definitely wasn't Sherlock.
He’d change from Jim, a fun loving, exotic person with life and love, a smile on his face and witty remark on his tongue. A flirt by nature and risk taker for the thrill of it. To James, hardened by loss and after revenge of any kind, suave and cool in nature, a loss of spirit in the empty hallows of his eyes, the suit and dress shoes having others do his dirty work. All the way to Moriarty, one might think he’d be a reimagined version of his father but don’t let him hear you say such a thing or you might not live to say it again. Moriarty was the insane, quick to bring a gun to a knife fight type, he’d tear you to pieces in an instant and had actually done so on multiple people. He felt no remorse and would do what he wanted anytime, no one questioning it or they’d be a number added to the kill count.
Something in John's chest did a flip and for a moment he felt he was dreaming, he blinked twice and discreetly pinched his arm. Pain. “Have you talked to the doctors?”
"John, I'm going to go talk to Lestrade." Sherlock looked to where his brother was standing by the detective inspector and beckoned him over with a look. "Mycroft will come sit with you alright?"
"Always a pleasure." Even through the phone he sounded smuggly proud of himself and it made Sherlock want to throw his phone at the wall. He hung up without another word and dropped his phone back into his pocket.
He didn't mean it but it was just easier to think this way.
“Isn’t that the question we’re all asking. It shouldn’t be possible.” Sherlock growls dropping the marker and turning around to run his fingers through his hair
Idk what the perspectives are doing I wrote this from 1-4 a.m. So yeah...
“Look around you, John. Look at where you are and who you are with. We’re in a hospital for goodness sake, look at the pieces of everyone around you, watch as they fall apart in front of your eyes. Why do you think I’m here, John, if not to be put back together again.” John didn’t understand, he couldn’t. For some reason he never asked why Sherlock was at the hospital, it never occurred to him. He really was an idiot, an idiot that could only think to say one thing..
Greg sighed to himself and pressed the gas pedal closer to the floor, rushing as quickly as he could to the location Sherlock had provided. John’s last contact before whatever had happened. CCTV was down, Mycroft had only been gone for a moment before chaos had ensued. He knew that he would blame himself.
He moved slowly into the kitchen taking in the mess he’d neglected to clean up in the first place, both from his cooking adventure with John to his accidental explosion beforehand. He carefully picked through the mess for the important bits he'd need or want to keep and set them aside before getting some strong cleaner and cleaning the entire area.
"Sherlock..? You said you explain." John says quietly as he puts his phone away again. Sherlock rubs as the back of his head for a minute before coming to sit by John.
"Just face it, John. Your a smitten kitten who's in love with Sherlock."
“But?” He taunted watching Sherlock, stretched out over a chair in the grass, lounging as if he was watching the telly. He was entertained, it had been such a long time and Sherlock could tell he was enjoying every second of it. He couldn’t hold on forever and he was wearing thin and thinner every moment that passed.
"It may soften the blow on the public." Sherlock says actually finishing his food before speaking.
“That is the point.”
“Yes, I will.” Sherlock assures him about the fifteenth time that day as he sits at his desk doing his work. The door opens and Molly comes in, they still haven’t told her that her boyfriend was the reason John no longer had a band. They’d tell her eventually, maybe.
“Sherlock.” John said to get his attention and his head snapped up toward him. John came over to him and handed him tea glancing at the map on the wall with many pins sticking out of it. “Anything new?”
Christmas Eve night: Baker Street.
“Looking for these?” Sherlock said in a tone he didn’t think he’d be able to manage if he was thinking with his conscious brain that wasn’t too active at the moment.
"Come here." Sherlock said quickly pulling John into an alley as the blinking picked up speed he looked around.
The pieces were coming together as if they wanted to be together, longing to be connected. Pressing into each other to click into place till only three pieces were missing.
"I mean c'mon John, I walk in on 'that' and it raises questions especially after the Landers case. You can't blame me with the evidence that's been put in front of me." Lestrade defended putting his hands up.
"I'll tell you when we get home." He said dismissively as he pulled John along and walked quickly as possible without seeming suspicious.
"Oh my god! Your a popstar, How could you possibly not know what a third wheel is." She asked exasperatedly.
“I like to watch you dance, you’re such a good dancer.” He seemed to purr and Sherlock felt something in his stomach turn, for all the genius he knew Moriarty to be capable of he had the ability to also be truly sickening on the most simple levels really. Maybe that was his problem but he was inclined to blame the criminal nonetheless for the current predicament was certainly his doing.
“Really?” John asked interestedly pulling his legs from Greg’s loose grasp to crisscross them and lean forward.
Moriarty hadn’t advanced according to the tracker though it’s steady blinking was starting to seem like a bomb slowly ticking down. Sherlock watched it everyday between working periods or while he was waiting for samples to process. He dreaded the day it sped up if even just for a moment, not ready for it.
“Oh, screw your promise. Come on live a little.”
“Of course I did.” Sherlock says amiably smiling at him just glad that he was okay. “I always keep my promises and you don’t forget that, alright?”
"I would show you the world. We could go anywhere you want. France, Spain maybe Italy. Perhaps Canada or America, anywhere." Johns smile was blinding and their were tears in his eyes Sherlock realized he probably looks the same.
“Oh, alright.” John replied still not entirely understanding when an idea came to mind. “You know you could come with me?” He said quietly looking out to the snow.
The air was warm a soft breeze blew over him as he rested. His eyes closed he savored the softness of his surroundings the ruffling of leaves could be heard in a soothing manner. Not a sound but those of nature around him as the scene unfolds slowly.
“No way, I’m not leaving you.” John said stern on that matter, there was no way that was happening.
“What..?” Lestrade asked in disbelief as he stared at the last picture. Mycroft looked at it curiously as if it wasn’t like John was getting progressively younger but specimen under a microscope.
“What else is there to think? That is the only explanation and using your way of thinking-“ Shelrock said as he stood and walked to the whiteboard grabbing and marker he wrote ‘who, what, when, how, why.’ “-we must fill in these blanks.”
“Okay, if someone doesn’t tell me what’s going on..”
“No it’s not nothing. It’s definitely something just tell me.” John said glaring up at him hoping to gain information from the ridiculous man in front of him. He wasn’t angry at him he was just fed up with not knowing.
“Sherlock..” John said with an exasperated sigh rubbing a hand over his face.
"No offense or anything Sherlock but you never do anything nice." A bitter laugh came from Sherlock and John studied his expression in more depth.
“You.. like me..?” John asked his eyes wide looking at Sherlock like he was crazy.
“You could say thank you.” He said coming to stand next to Mycroft. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“You know I’ve been thinking.” John said as he dangled from a tree Sherlock was sitting under. It was cold and snow was everywhere and each time John moved on his branch it caused snow to fall on Sherlock and his homework. It was annoying, to say the least.
“I’m still going to prove you wrong and take your money.”
"Oddly enough I do." John's soft smile turned into a small grin. "Though I can't imagine why." They took jibes at each other for a while completely content to just sit together.
"Sherlock finally made you some breakfast, hmm?" John almost choked in surprise.
A screen clicked on beside that, another security camera of a dark room and just barely John could make out the crumpled form of Greg.
"Sherlock how and why do you have my phone?" John asks completely confused.
They forced the doors with anything they could find laying around but they wouldn’t open even a crack. Mycroft had called someone in to open it for them but it would take too long they all already knew. There was a silence around the area, the city was a long ways away and the bustle of it was absent from the background, leaving them in an uneasy silence in a race against time.
Sherlock emerged with a gasp sitting up quickly and shaking off the corners of the dream, he pulled the needle out of his arm and his partner pulled the one out of their subject and together they left the building.
“Fine, I have no musical experience.” Molly admits and sits back annoyed crossing her arms over her chest. “You don’t have to be such an ass about it.” Before Sherlock can retort John steps in.
“No, not at all, I’d love to.” Sherlock said quickly, almost frantic to stay by his side. John smiled reassured and Sherlock smiled tentatively back.
John was dressed in a dark oversized hoodie and the smallest pair of pants Sherlock could find. Which were khakis and John was boiling in the heat and unrelenting sun. Sherlock glared at everyone he saw to get them out of the way and John stumbled behind him almost to the point of being dragged as Sherlock picked up his pace.
“Did it work?” Sherlock asked sitting up somewhat and regretting it with a light groan laying back down again, momentarily forgetting about the ribs.
John was slightly wobbly on his feet, still unsteady on his own but made his way to the bed and sat next to Sherlock. He looked as though he was sleeping though in an odd position. John has read about what Sherlock did as far as deduction but had no idea of what this was.
‘And you wonder why it’s hard for me to stay clean.’
"That.. was amazing." Sherlock looked to him in surprise and took a moment to compose himself.
John and Molly have complained on more than one occasion though Molly is much more vocal.
“So what?”
"I'm forgetting my manners. Who have you come with?" She asked as she sits across from them in a plushy brown chair.
He walked down to where the windows were on his right, his mind flashed an image of a sniper aiming for his head. He turned quickly to look out at the peaceful scene. Outside was dark but the sky was clear and lit the ground by the moon. John didn't notice at first comforted by the tranquil scene until he noticed a tree.
“Yes and you’ll suffer through it here. You forget you still have to recover yourself, little brother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"That didn't go too well then?" Greg asked tentatively as they started to walk towards the parking lot.
“John!” Sherlock called grabbing John’s arm and pulling him away from the stove before getting a towel and smothering the small flame and charred food. After the fire was put out he placed the pan in the sink and opened the windows to air the place out before coming back to John. “Are you okay?”
"Why, why would he be there?" Sherlock demands looking at her intensely.
"What..?" John was taken aback by the sudden change of subject. Sherlock was truly a whirlwind and could go from one thing to the next in an instant his mind thinking far too fast for lengthy conversation. He was a wonder in John's mind something to be praised and glorified, brilliant in every aspect but social norms. But who ever liked normal.
In the dark of the night, the sun having just set not too many minutes ago. It would hardly be considered a tranquil environment with harsh winds and rain, hail starting to fall outside. One of the worst storms that the area had experienced in quite a while.
"Why are you so interested with what I have to say?" John asks back turning so he's facing Sherlock enitirely.
“I didn’t mean to snap.” He said in a much calmer tone. “I just have seen worse, people who couldn’t be saved. You can though, John. I know you don’t believe so, but just trust me, that I will pick up the pieces and put them back in their places. I promise.”
"You may be angry now and won't admit it but you are in fact happy. It's been far too long since you were genuinely happy." Sherlock replied taking John hands into his own and bringing them to his lips.
That was something that wouldn't fade away, the image of what Sherlock was before he’d dragged him into all this. When he was just another patient next door to him and in the time he had spent with Sherlock now immobile, he’d often wished he could have fixed his mistakes and not brought Sherlock into this. Just stayed in the hospital.
“Of course I do.” John says admiring the watch in awe of how it looked almost identical to before and yet it seemed to have more detail. “You did all this yourself?”
“Did you just use the term ‘kick ass’ in a serious sentence?” John giggles unable to keep the smile off his face as he looks over at Sherlock.
“Why are you apologizing? We weren’t together then, you were allowed to sleep with whoever you wanted. Although I’d prefer if you didn’t now.” Sherlock says moving back to sit against the wall with him, joking slightly to lighten the mood.
"You are astonishing, as always." John praises just before lightning struck, the power goes off and thunder crashes as darkness surrounds them. As the thunder hits a scream comes from the wall behind them and Sherlock shoots up though John can only hear him with the lights out.
He’d sit with headphones on, music up all the way still able to hear the noises through the thin walls.  Feeling utterly and helplessly alone.
Sherlock bounces lightly in an attempt to calm the crying child that hardly even resembled John anymore. He was so much smaller than before, just a toddler it seemed and Sherlock would put his age at three or maybe four as John seemed to be older than he looked but it was a stretch. He was just so incredibly young.
“It seemed like the right thing to do and it made him happy so..”
John woke up and Sherlock was gone, he’s not sure what else he expected. There was a problem to be solved -of course- Sherlock was already up and thinking about it. John himself was nervous as to where Jim was and what he was planning but he knew as long as he stayed with Greg and Sherlock he’d be safe.
His limbs didn’t hurt from being suspended any longer, his head didn’t hurt from having to hold it high to avoid the ropes that threatened to end him. His feet didn't ache from holding his own weight up for hours on end, he lost the sight of despair of the dark hospital in his mind. He knew that when he opened his eyes that wouldn't be what was waiting for him.
John felt tears trickle down his cheeks at the thought of simply forgetting something so important. He couldn’t bear this any longer. “I’m sorry..” John choked on his words as his throat closed up. The man lifted his head and John’s hand fell to the side lifelessly as he looked into those ever changing eyes. The man moved closer to the bed and sat up looking at John questionably as tears fell from his eyes.
“I should be in there with him. He needs to know I’m not going to leave, that I’m not actually angry at him just the situation.” John argued still fuming from when he had been kicked out before Sherlock had even woken up.
“So it seems.” John murmurs quietly, thinking. “I’m happy he’s here with Sherlock, he needs him. He’s a good guy.”
John joined him in the mound and they just sat in comfortable silence watching the fire burn. After a while John leaned his head on Sherlock's shoulder tired of holding himself upright. Apparently Sherlock was as well, as he laid his own head on John's but not before pulling John's chair over to use as a backrest first.
“Sherlock. Sherlock.” John whispered trying not to panic as the sound got closer, he shook a bit harder in vain. “Come on.. wake up. Please.” He begged shaking him desperately, it was the only way.
"To make you happy." Sherlock stops in the middle of the almost empty street as he turns to look Johnn in the eye.
“All right fine. You stay Mycroft and I will go.” Sherlock compromises to Lestrade as he heads for the door. John makes a move to follow but think better of it at the two men block the door so he stays put.
“It doesn’t matter, because this time I’ll be right beside you. I won’t let anything happen to you.” Sherlock said soft but firm on the matter, leaning back a bit to look into John eyes. “That, I promise and will never break.”
“I’m sorry John.” Sherlock says quietly, hating himself for doing this but lifts John up again and starts walking up the stairs to his old bedroom.
John disappeared in front of his eyes, he felt his soul break into pieces. Emptiness flooded him and he had no idea if it would be enough but he didn’t want to live anymore. He was alone. John’s dogtags heavy in his pocket as he stood on another rooftop.
"Has that ever happened before?" John asked quietly trying not to disturb Sherlock's apparent thinking.
It pushed him forward, made him strive to make things right. To fix his mistakes although his body protested every move.
“John.” Sherlock risked calling out in a hushed whisper. As there’s no movement from the shadowy figure he creeps forward quietly coming up beside the figure. The room was silent his words echoed in an unpleasant way every tiny noise seeming so impossibly loud.
The Game is on.
"That was nothing." John says coming to stand in front of him with his hands on his hips.
“Because you both were fighting like children.” John said throwing a glare at Sherlock, arriving at the door pulling at the handle finding it to be locked. “Great. Of course we’re locked in, I should’ve never brought you here.” He fumed.
"Sherlock, how is this not be my fault?" John said his voice raising on the verge of yelling. He stood angrily and started pacing back and forth. "I was the one to let him in the band in the first place, I didn't even put any of them on a contract because we were 'friends'. I was the one who stood on the sidelines as he corrupted all of them and didn't do a damn thing to stop them leaving. So tell me how could this possibly not be my fault?"
“Well he’s a kid so I talked to him. He’s the same kid I met in uni twenty years ago, it wasn’t that hard.” Lestrade explained with a smile while Sherlock scowled and got up. “Sherlock, quite being an overbearing mother and just be his friend.”
“Don’t! Speak his name!” James shouted and John took a step back. That's when he saw this was Moriarty, he was no longer James. “Don’t, even speak his name. You’re lucky I’m letting you live to save one.”
"Yes, as always, goodbye." Mycroft sighed irritated then left. Sherlock waited until he was around the hall before running across the hall to the boys room. He was strapped to his bed, looking drowsy( in comfortable clothes though so probably here for a while)and had a breathing tube down his throat, which was inconvenient as he wouldn't be able to speak. The room was colder than his own smaller and missing the large wall wide window like his own on the back wall, instead leaving it blank.
“He wouldn’t trust anyone else with it only his number two.” Sherlock said already writing the name on the board.
“Where did you even get this stuff anyway? I don’t think they give out cigarettes and lighters to recovering patients.”
"There's nothing to be gained from it, so I have no use for it. Just a ploy." Sherlock was already walking away, taking off the gloves and dropping them to the ground.
“Greg. Come on, get up.” John called tapping Greg’s cheek and checking his pulse. He had to get him out of this room and away from whatever was in the air. His pulse was slow, so slow he had a hard time finding it.
"What..?" Sherlock gets ready to insult him for interrupting his thoughts when John points to his arm. Sherlock goes quiet at the sight taking John's hand and wrist into his hands to assess the blinking. "When did this start?"
Meanwhile Sherlock was suffering, watching from the sidelines as John went around dating anything that breathed. He could practically feel his life force slowly being sucked away with every new person John brought back to his room.
“Alright, alright. Don’t get your nickers in a twist.” Lestrade sighs and puts his hands up walking back into the room a bit as Sherlock leaves. He comes to stand by Mycroft muttering a few words before he’s gone as well and it’s just the two of them.
They came to stand at the tree where at the best now lit with big industrial lights a message. Scratched into the base and laced with blood it said- 'Johnny boy I've become bored without your company. Send your dog to entertain me. Or I could just collect you myself. Your move. -Jim Moriarty.'
“Thank goodness, me too.” John smiles kissing Sherlock softly before pulling away lightly with a small grin. “You never told me if you were a virgin.”
"Oh forget her, she's already dead isn't she?" Sherlock said irritated, closing a small case of blood cover bark.
That's when John remembered Sherlock picked the dinner.
“Sit up.” The women said and Shelrock obliged hiding a wince when it pulled uncomfortably at his stomach and throat. She was trying to determine if there were any side effects but Sherlock already assessed himself and he didn’t have any.
“You can’t possibly know that. You will most likely leave within the year but I’ve already been here for four years now and nothing has changed. I’m incurable, And when I turn eighteen I lose my childcare funding and won’t be able to stay here for a week. How can you possibly think you could fix that?”
John turned and left afterwards, he tried his best to leave Sherlocks ghost behind but it followed him all the way back to the hospital. Mycroft had suggested John spend some time away from Sherlock at the beginning of this when he refused to leave his bedside and wasn’t that funny now. It didn’t matter if he was away from him or not he was always with him in some capacity.
They slip into bed and curl up into each other's arms they both let out content sighs as they settle. The weight of the day finally hitting their minds and bodies as they lay together. They comfort and console each other away from erratic thoughts and eventually drift to sleep.
Moriartys words echoed in Sherlock's brain, pushing him to hit the door harder ignoring all pain and bruising forming in his shoulder. If he didn’t find John in time he’d lose him and he rammed himself into the door harder.
“John?” He asked looking up to Mycroft once he was done making sure he did in fact have all of his appendages intact.
"Okay, one, you know his name. Two, what's wrong with the magazine?" Molly asked turning in her seat at the desk to stare at him incredulously.
They were quiet for a while as they walked eventually making their way to the roof. They sat on the edge and John was quite while Sherlock was thinking hands pressed to his lips. It was a long while before either of them spoke until Sherlock broke the silence.
"Your fine." Sherlock says as he goes through his phone. John does a double take, that's his phone.
“Sherlock this isn’t rational nor realistic, he would be-“
"No."
Grass. Being dragged against the grass, it imitated the sound of water. Rustling as he was moving against it, body pressed to the ground the blades of grass sliding across the shells of his ears. Choppily he moved, short bursts of movement before he stopped and then another one would follow in uneven intervals.
“Please John.. I’m sorry.” He begged him, meeting his eyes desperately, not here. “Please..”
“Uh huh, I’m so sure.” John grinned and pulled him down into a kiss. “You’re so bloody tall.” He complained without any heat as they broke apart once more.
When he entered he was bombarded by Molly and bearded in while she talked his ear off. He pointedly stayed quite not following at all as she got it out of her system. When she did calm down he looked at her questionably.
The night before had brought a fitful sleep for the young detective his conversation with John haunted him. He never meant to snap or yell at John but he couldn’t take self deprecation. It is a stupid way to get compliments and he knew John wasn’t doing that and he genuinely believed that but Sherlock couldn’t control himself. John shouldn’t feel that way he shouldn’t have to and Sherlock shouldn’t be yelling at him but at his terrible excuse for a uncle.
"What happened?" Sherlock asked quietly into the silence. John laughed bitterly that turned into a sigh as he pushed off the wall coming to sit across from Sherlock.
“You should be used to it by now.” Sherlock grumbles angrily feeling Johns hands grip at his shirt from behind him quiet whimpering noises following. “Go away now, we’ll come out when we’re ready.” He waves him off.
Soon cars were driving by and they could get a cab but they didn't want one anymore. Walking seemed like a better idea. They probably needed the exercise anyway.
Greg made his way over to Sherlock and helped to extract him from the paramedics and bring him back to his car without a word. They both sat in the car for a moment just watching the mess that was in front of their eyes. He wasn't sure what to think of it all but he was sure that Sherlock was already ten steps ahead of him on this entire thing. Although really he should be chiding the man for not telling him what a mess it was here, demanding that he explain immediately but he couldn’t seem to find the strength to do so.
Sherlock looked at John confused trying to think of what he meant and moved over to the wardrobe to find something for each of them to wear. He was thinking of what John was trying to say when he realized what he meant. Whoops.
He wasn’t staring at her butt or boobs (which were both threatened to fall out) or anything just looking at Sherlock. John had khaki shorts on and a stupid t-shirt that said ‘I speak fluent broadway and sarcasm.’ He too had concern in his expression but also curiosity and something Sherlock couldn’t place.
“Why’d you call him?” John complained, it wasn’t that he didn’t like Mycroft he was fine and a good brother he just wished he didn’t kick him out. After a small pause Greg spoke.
“I’ll explain it in the morning.” He says quickly regretting even starting this topic in the first place before standing to put in pajamas.
"So you do have a private, personal life then?" Lestrade pestered with a shit-eating grin.
"Hmm?" Sherlock was cleaning. Well he was cleaning to make a place for his microscope but he was still cleaning not just through things around like he usually did.
Molly and Sherlock shared a room in the center building on campus. They don’t usually let a male and female room together but the receptionist looked at Sherlock said ‘gay’ and let them room together. He couldn’t fathom how she knew with her job and IQ level of a squirrel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, look who can’t play hero anymore.” James drawled his gleaming white daggers of teeth shining in the darkness. “I was excited to meet you. The great Sherlock Holmes, leaves such an impression for just a child.” His voice was of silk with dark black hair slicked back to show his superiority as well as a gold watch that could be heard ticking away in the quite hallway.
His aunt was looking at him so fondly with a smile on her face and even though Sherlock wasn't smiling his eyes were. Nobody else could pick it out but Sherlock did it so often John could find it easily.
Like the fact that Sherlock's voice is so deep it makes him shiver and his laugh so sweet he can't help but smile. Sherlock's smile is soft and tentative as if he was afraid we had doing something wrong. His sentences were precise and thought out carefully, each word perfectly pronounced -unlike John's sentences where some of his words would mix into others when he spoke too fast- as if afraid to be judged. He walked and dressed with perfection and wore a mask to hide behind. John wanted more than anything to be let into Sherlock's mind so he could witness the brilliance that lies beneath.
"I need to go out." Sherlock said grabbing his coat he wasn't actually dressed properly but he didn't seem to care. John couldn't find it in him to reprimand him, he was far too happy.
"I did, very much actually." The relief in Sherlock's eyes was evident and John found it odd that he suddenly cared about another's opinion. "Just wondering, why? Not that I mind or anything but you usually avoid cooking like the plague. What changed?"
John looked over at the noise of it hitting the ground surprised to see Sherlock with his hands over his face. He was rubbing his hand over his face and hair as if trying to wash something off.
"John. Wake up, it's important." John mumbled some nonsense cracking open an eye to watch him warily.
“How?” Lestrade asked wishing they knew.
"Fix it." Sherlock said glaring at the wall in replacement of his brother.
“Did I do something bad..?” John asked hesitantly, confused to why he was being sent away.
It burned and ached, indescribable agony eating his body with every ragged breath pulling himself forward. He had to get to John. It was all he needed to keep going.
“That what I told him. Though you can’t exactly blame him, it’s all people have done in his life, just walk away.” They became quite again as the elevator stopped on a floor and someone walked in. They didn’t speak again until they got outside.
"Why- ugh just tell me!" John whines annoyed that Sherlock was being so petty. Sherlock smirked to himself, he got an odd sort of satisfaction getting under his skin, it took a lot more work when he was older. He tried to ignore that fact.
“One more thing.” Sherlock made a vague hand gesture to continue as he took a bit of chicken. “Why him? Nothing intrigues or interests you, except for a body, so? Why John?” Sherlock looked thoughtful as he placed the- thankfully empty -container on the nightstand.
It seemed a long time that it took for him to find the entrance to the building although he was moving at a rapid pace it felt much longer. Time slowed at a pace that he felt the shifts in the air around him, death carried away in a downhill spiral and he breathed fresh air for a moment. The tall grass rustled at his ankles and for a moment he felt everything stopped as he found his way to the building's door.
"Doctor." Sherlock announces with a tone of finality.
“I feel happy.”
“He went into the other room.” Sherlock pointed back to the door on the other side of the room.
“Alright.” Sherlock gathered his things in one hand and reached out and grasped John’s with his other and was pulled up. They headed back to the dorms in quiet just listening to their surroundings.
"Still recovering keep that in mind, yeah?"
“Boy or girl? Or both?” John asks scooching back to lean against the thin walls that were supposed to be their divide and had now brought them together. He didn’t care much if Sherlock was a virgin or not, it didn’t affect their relationship or how he viewed him but he was just a tiny bit glad he wasn’t, it would make it easier when the time came.
"You are so oblivious. Whatever the point is you're always with him." She points out.
“Which one?” Sherlock actually almost laughed at that, he grinned and let out a small snort stiffening the probably full throated laugh he would have let out if he had any less self control. It was a rare occurrence that Lestrade witnessed a genuine smile that hadn’t come about because of a body and even more so because he caused it, it was oddly rewarding and he found himself grinning back even when Sherlock looked away abashedly.
Irrevocably.
“You don’t see it? Perhaps I put too much faith in you. Go on, we have time.”
He couldn’t quite find it in himself to care, so tranquil in the moment despite the urgency of the form above him.
“And here I thought you’d done something nice.”
“I’d make due with an explanation.” Sherlock replies watching Moriarty from his place on the floor, observing him. Picking out what he could from his expression and body language, in all honesty he didn’t know much on the situation. Not that it mattered, he’d accepted that this was the end for him, perhaps he was just buying what little time he had left. Pulling out his suffering just a bit longer to bring an end to this case, at least let him have a conclusion before whatever came next.
"What?! Why didn't you call me in? Did you say yes? Please tell me you said yes!" She yelled in excitement jumping and grabbing his shoulders.
‘The case, John. All that matters is the work.’
“He’s gone you know, precious lover boy. The DI chosen over you.” Moriarty tutted, standing and idly walking around Sherlocks prone body.
Like puppets on strings the papers moved as the wind blew through the sky light. Carried away with the wind, a choked sob and a mangled laugh.
It was too much at once, he couldn’t handle it. The emotions and keeping track of the mission and John was there in front of him. He had a gun and so did Sherlock and all he wanted was to hold him.
“What is that?”Sherlock asked cautiously, eyeing the machine with equal interest and skepticism.
“Call Mycroft to hold them there.” With that Sherlock hung up and dropped his phone on the table before falling onto the sofa.
An hour or two later Sherlock was back in his room yelling at Mycroft through his phone receiver trying to get answers on his progress. He was also trying to get him to come earlier than that night, or at least he was until he heard a sharp cry from the living room.
"How? How could you possibly..?" John asked in wonder looking at Sherlock in amazement.
Moriarty came closer and tapped the box with his foot Sherlock was balancing on with careful precision, the box was on its side, his feet on the edges of it. Any wrong move and the box would fold in on itself or he could slip into it, to which his feet would not reach the ground before a noose would be cutting off his oxygen. He shifted to accommodate but the cheap cardboard box still crumpled slightly under him, the rope pressed into his neck.
“Sherlock! Get your ass over where now!” She screamed and he pulled the phone away from his ear in shock. Molly didn’t swear she hardly ever raised her voice unless she was fan-girling which brought all this to a startling clarity for Sherlock.
"If anything I believe you are the bad influence on me." Shelrock said and John mock gasped making Sherlock smile. They both knew John was the reckless one, the do now think about injuries later one, especially if it was to help someone else. They also both knew that Sherlock was the impulsive one, he was rational in his thinking and logic of course but he could still make rash decisions and he did when it came to something he got too excited about. But they both knew probably too well that they could get the other to do anything so they were both the bad influence and occasionally the good one.
"You made me breakfast." Sherlock looked up at him then.
"We?" John asked probably a little too hopefully. Sherlock's argument died in his mouth when he realized what he had just said.
Sherlock looked over to John as they walked out closer to the wall. He looked enraptured with his surroundings, completely in awe and Sherlock made sure to file the look away.
They went down quickly, after passing through the door they came to a halt. Two open doors stood on both sides of them and they turned to each other.
"Should we make it official?" John asked as his hand hovered over the enter button. As confirmation Sherlock placed his own over Johns and hit enter they kissed again as they looked at the screen. Soon enough people would be blowing up his inbox asking hundreds of questions but for now it was peaceful and they were together.
He was buzzing with energy, finally something fun to do.
John giggles in his arms holding onto his shoulder for balance. “He’s not a giwl.”
"It's a surprise and not until tonight but you'll take ages to get ready." John practically screamed in happiness and hugged Sherlock again. They both smiled like lunatics and were laughing in happiness.
“Wait, you’re not going home?” John asked interrupting Sherlock and moving to sit in front of him to talk to him face to face.
“And why’s that, dear?” Sherlock pondered this for a moment he knew why but it was a bit odd to say I’m happy because someone else is happy.
"I'm not sure. Whatever he put in you we will fix though, I promise." Sherlock said stroking lightly at the bandage on John's inner elbow.
“Yes, I want to know.” John probed for answers. He had been curious as to why they had been on a first name basis from when he first called him and the way he talks about him they must be close. Greg just sighed again though more good naturedly.
He knew he had hidden the pieces in a box locked up with a key long gone. He couldn't remember why he put them in there but he remembered it was important.
"No, I'm not leaving you alone." John said adamantly not letting Sherlock go off alone now, the only reference he had for this sort of thing was don't split up or you'll get caught.
“Sherlock..?”
“Just a bit.” Sherlock tells him quietly, watching him curiously. It justified it a bit he supposed although he still didn’t like the idea much.
He reaches across his bed to grab his phone and dialed Lestrade, perhaps he had John’s case.
They stayed like that for a few moments longer until there was nothing else to do but let each other go. Sherlock lifted John up to carry him grabbing his bags as he went and brought him over to the car awaiting them, carefully tucking him inside with his belongings. They were both quiet as the dark haired detective strapped his small doctor into the seat and stepped back. “I'll see you as soon as I can, okay?” John nodded silently and the door closed with a dull thud, the vehicle driver pulled out and the car drove away.
“So, I make you stupid, and mundane?” John asked in disbelief and slight disgust.
“Jim, be quiet. He’ll hear you.” Sebastian whispered, practically scandalized by it, sliding his hand overtop Jim’s own loosening his grip.
“You left him alone?” John asked shocked and sighed moving over to the door again, quickly navigating through the papers hoping he wasn’t in danger.
“Stay here.” Sherlock said to John as he pushed him into a couch in the office.
“I’ll take that as Sherlock for ‘yes, your right.’” They continued to watch on. “I bet you he’s gay.”
"It's supposed to mean anyone with clues has conveniently forgotten is dead or missing. This person who ever they are they're smart covered their tracks yet flaunted it so beautifully, an artist more like a graffiti artist specifically. Spreading the paint leaving the masterpiece yet never signing the work. Ingenious."
"Sherlock, it's better this way. He can help us." John tried to persuade him, tugging at his arm insistently.
“What are you so excited about?” Sherlock asks smiling fondly as John reaches him. He closes his laptop and stands taking a few of John’s bags he catches his breath.
“It’s Greg, listen-”
“The second group had found him- thank god- I don’t think I’d be able to see him in the state Fletcher had described to me, he was in some field out of town beaten to crap with severe burns passed out on the ground. I got to the scene after he had been carted away to the hospital and the place was. I don’t really have words for it. It was how you would expect a crime scene to be a bloody massacre, body parts thrown about blood everywhere but what was most terrifying was the actual decapitated head sitting upon a rock which overlooked where John was on the ground. I went to the hospital he had large circular electrical burns on his temples and wrists along with a long list of injures. I stayed, oversaw his treatment made the decisions figured out where to put him the government paid for his treatment as he was underaged. I couldn’t stay though as much as I wanted to, I didn’t think he trusted me anymore let alone would want to be in my presence. Three days later he woke up and I got a call he was asking for me so I went, he didn’t bring it up so I assume he lost the memory along with what happened when he got taken. I visited randomly here and there but I felt too guilty so I slowly stopped coming together, probably not the best option but I didn’t know what to do a.” He trailed off. “That’s all I really know, the case was open and investigated for a year, nothing was found.”
“You could always just ask him.” Lestrade murmured after they had stared at the file for an unidentifiable amount of time. “Though I’m not sure what or if he remembers.”
John sleeps upstairs in his room that night while Sherlock is in his own. He doesn't sleep his mind too active with all the possibilities of tomorrow. He knows that Mycroft's people will keep his secret but he still doesn't have the most faith in them for that and possibly messing up.
Sherlock breathed out, a feeling of tranquility falling over him as he seemed to float aimlessly in the white void. Circling and floating through the bright light he feels at peace and with a smile it all fades away.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Molly asks confused realizing that Sherlock was being serious and starting to act the same.
“You wanted to guilt John. He didn’t kill him.”
“Mycroft.” Sherlock replies in a loathing tone.
“It only started at the hospital, so the day we found him. March eighteenth.” Sherlock relays the information filling in each piece in the board.
"Impressive.." John says faintly as he rounds the counter to look at a purple bubbling substance.
“Actually I think it’s blood.” Sherlock said lifting his hand -with Johns still attached to his wrist- up a bit for better lighting.
“I can see things other people can’t. You could give me the before and after of an event and I could be able to tell what happened in between.”
"Yes, yes of course. Leave now, Mycroft." The younger-Sherlock- grumbled rolling his eyes. The tall man-Mycroft- sighed annoyed turning away from Sherlock to the door when he noticed the boy staring at them through the open door across the hall. Even Sherlock looked over to see what caused his brother to pause. They both stared at the boy strapped to the bed across the hall with a questioning stare. The boy did nothing just kept staring at his vacant stare at Sherlock, it made him fidget with unease. "Do be on your way." He forced out past his discomfort.
“I would hardly call that unscathed.” Sherlock muttered, shifting some taking stock of himself, not feeling much yet because of the painkillers.
As much as he was glad for Sherlock and Greg's help it was no longer helpful. His heart hammered in his chest as he pointed the torch down into the room, coming up to the door. As far as he could see it was just another hallway, he glanced back at Greg and Sherlock, they were still too absorbed in their fight to notice he left.
“Doin’ what?” John asks pushing himself up on Sherlock chest to sit upright atop of him and Sherlock puts his arms on John’s sides to hold him up.
‘Still thinking about me?’ Sherlock asked from the window sill staring at John cooly as the wind drifted through him from the open window. The white curtains billowed around him in a heavenly way.
It had been three months since the case of Johns absent mother. A report of the incident and a small hint at where the gang would be was given to the police. ‘El Toro De Fuego’ was dismantled in a night, sixty-seven men and women were found and put up for trial, fifty-three were placed in jail and ten went to the hospitals proven to be hostages. Unfortunately Johns mother was among the jail group.
“You need to.” Sherlock insisted, trying to push him away.
“Come back..” John said sluggishly, hoping his familiar constant would stay constant. John didn’t want him to leave at all the mysterious stranger with a large coat was so comforting and grounding, John was drawn to him immediately. He wondered if he was the first time they met as well.
The second John laid eyes on Sherlock he broke down, choking out sobs which wracked his small frame as fat tears rolled down his chubby cheeks and he cried out in despair. At this point he should be used to it but Sherlock was still shocked as he rushed to the small child and scooped him up into his arms, cradling him to his chest.
“Oh nothing to worry about. It’s just the W.A.Y. It’s an acronym you see stands for Wave Assessor Yellow, its yellow because of the small piece of tape on the back we have a few so it's easier to keep track by color. We also have W.A.R.,W.A.G. and W.A.P. We make sure to give John W.A.Y. everytime.” John cracks a small smile, before going back to concentrating. ”It's a simple device really but very effective for specific cases, it asses brain waves and so with John we can guess how his body will react through out almost the whole day. All John has to do is concentrate on one thing and it buzzes to life.”
He was driving, yes he could drive. Driving was a calming method of trying to stay away from past addictions. Currently he wanted a cigarette.
“I don’t know. What do you think?” Johns asks brushing hair out of his face that was getting too long and into his eyes.
“I may have..” Sherlock said quietly mumbling so much that most of what he said was just noise in the mattress.
"Examine the body, Dr Watson." Sherlock snipped back. Arse. So John got down on his knees onto freezing icy ground and went through the motions of looking over the body mechanically. Muscle memory helping him throughout the process as his legs started losing feeling.
“No, this is my problem I should deal with it.” John replied immediately, he knew he had to face his demons and not just let others fight his battle any longer.
Sherlock knelt to examine the carving. The name Moriarty belonged to Johns deceased uncle but his name was Roger Moriarty, so who was this?
He didn’t have long to think about it because John’s door opened a minute later and there stood John, perfect in every way. His John that paused in his stride to look up at him and Sherlock met his perfect blue eyes, just the perfect height. There was a pause as they both just stared before a surge of emotion caught up and they were hugging within an instant and there were hands and arms and lips and perfection.
“Get up Greg, come on. Please get up. Dad, please.” He pleaded sitting on his knees beside Greg’s form, tugging at his shoulders. There was guilt building in his throat that he attempted to push away. A useless battle.
“I’m bettew now.” John protests leaning into Sherlocks chest heavily. “I don’t need to.” He whines pulling at Sherlock's shirt lightly.
“No, that actually happened.” Lestrade says as he laughs as well.
“We have to get you help and I can’t carry you, come on Sherlock, please get up.” John begged, glancing down the hall as he heard the footsteps getting closer.
He texted Lestrade back and forth about what had been happening since he had seen him last and convinced him to talk to Mycroft. A few moments later he was getting a call from Mycroft, he glanced at John momentarily.
Sherlock jumped out of the car as soon as it was stopped and headed inside of Baker Street, climbing the stairs two at a time and ignoring whatever it was Lestrade had said. He wasn’t focused on anything else but John and he didn’t want any interruptions, he had to do this alone.
“I’m just.. I’m afraid Sherlock.” John said quietly squeezing his eyes shut and breathing in Sherlock’s comforting scent. “Jim he tortured me as a child in any way he could and I didn’t even know why. What is he going to do this time?”
Kisses on foreheads, hands in hair, heads on shoulders, hands in hands, food fed to each other and long snogging sessions followed by nights entangled together in Sherlock's large bed. Never really going that far but just content with being in each other's presence.
He was lightheaded and his fingers were raw from trying to pull himself towards the exit. He was out of breath and bleeding out. Hope was leaking out of his body and flowing away just as quick as the blood was.
“I don’t!” Sherlock defended trying to ignore the conversation laying back down and pulling the blankets up to his chin.
Nowhere near perfect but they fit which was all that mattered. Yet there were still missing pieces the center ones. Most important ones.
“The only thing I couldn’t figure out.” He began unpacking and she resumed as well.
