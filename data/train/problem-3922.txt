“You do not need me to speak for you, Dior,” Castiel tells him easily.
in a carriage. Headed..somewhere.
Dior knew enough about noble interaction to see the Prince’s reply for what it was: a command for Alastair to depart on his own. He had never seen someone command the alpha like this before, so confidently and with no remorse. He could feel Alastair wanting to snap but then realising who it is he’s dealing with before bowing and leaving with the proverbial tail between his legs. It was incredible.
, but has only ever bought him for his time and not his body. The first few times it happened, he had been apprehensive because - not to blow his own horn - he was not a cheap prostitute, being the most sought after omega at his establishment, and nobody spends that amount of money to just
He sits on his knees instead of haunches, and as if she was expecting him to, Lisa turns her head sideways and down, revealing her neck and scent gland to him willingly. It’s not submission, but permission - her eyes not leaving him as he drags his nose along her skin.
“I see. Very well, I will send a letter, if that is what you would prefer.”
at him to back away. He can’t because he
Jack, now finished with his bottle, Castiel returns it to the bag and hooks the infant over his shoulder, gently patting his back trying to coax a burp out. When it doesn’t come out a minute later, Castiel places Jack back into the stroller.
“Cas-?” he asks softly, voice rough with sleep. Castiel feels his face split into an enormous smile that Dior squints at.
The room remains quiet.
. He can feel it in the tightness of the ropes, in the slow movements of her silver butterfly knife, in the way there is no longer any reprieve from the whip on his soles. In the way the sweetness of liquorice gets disgusting in her arousal.
Balthazar as my best friend,” he says, rubbing at his eye tiredly.
“Your Majesty, King Azazel of France and your Highnesses, Crown Princess Abbadon, Princess Lilith and Princess Margot. Prince Castiel James the First and His Grace Lord Balthazar of the Roché Duchy greet you. We thank you for your benevolent welcome to your country and home. God bless the Royal Family.” Castiel greeted, his head bowed low, one hand gently touching the floor, one touching his chest. Formal greetings to the Royals in their own countries were always complicated and had to be tip-toed around. A small price to pay for peace, really.
“We were just happy to hear she gets to go to the market. W-we made her promise to come back with interesting stories,” one of the younger girls says, Marjorie, voice meek as if she was in the wrong to be excited about being told a story of the outside world.
“Of course. We will go to my library and you can have a look around and choose a few you like the look of,” Cain said.
Maybe it’s the lingering, full scent of the lavender wafting in the room from the still-hot water, maybe it’s the fact that Dior’s distracted and annoyed, but he doesn’t realise there’s someone in his room until they speak out.
Unfortunately, he still has no idea what those ‘
He also thinks that this debilitating, wretched, extraordinary feeling he has been carrying around must be love.
The alpha straightens out quickly enough to give himself whiplash when he remembers what he has been carrying all day.
. He imagines how scared he must have been to go through his first heat alone, without the aid of another familiar face bringing him water, food and changing his beddings when needed.

Hi everyone!
, he was planning on finishing his bath, then talking to Crowley about Lisa, and now it’s looking like he’ll have to delay that to deal with this shit.
,” he vowed. If this is how he could repay his kindness, he was ready to jump at the opportunity.
The prince’s breath seizes when the carriage starts going past this group and his gut is confirmed to be right; that lithe arms, endearing bow legs, and glinting strands belong to the one being on this planet archangels prophet about.
“Why are you s-so generous?” he asks. “What’re you after? Why are you being
“Seven for the necklace and two for the rest,” he haggles, not breaking eye contact.
painful. She grabs him by the bicep, nails scratching right over a blister, not quite opening it, but it causes a cry to die at the back of Dior’s throat.
“A cold,” he tells her, giving a half-hearted cough that even he doesn’t believe. “I’ve been careless.”
He leaves feather-like traces of his lips over Cas’ earlobe and purrs louder when the alpha’s breath stutters, big hands flying over the omega’s ribs, digging the bones of his corset further into his ribs. God, he’s so close to his scent gland he could swear it’s
wake up very relaxed. It would have been difficult otherwise, I imagine.”
“Yes,” he replies, not telling Dior that his mother no longer calls him ‘Cassie’, stopped inviting him to share an afternoon tea or that he never sees her hair down anymore.
“I-I…” he starts, trying to say something, anything, ready to beg if needed. Cold sweat trickles down his temple, leaving behind a cold track that’s discomforting in the welcoming warmth of the foyer. “I don’t- Could I-”
“You have?” he asks, unable to conceal the joy he feels.
“Awesome!” Dior exclaimed, took his feet off Crowley’s lap and leapt down from the desk, quickly taking off upstairs. This was amazing news. Cain had promised to call on him this week but he couldn’t help the worry that maybe he won’t, in the end. He loved spending time at the alpha’s estate, especially since he wouldn’t be restricted to the inside of the man’s bedroom. Dior was pleased that he decided to not use the herbs in the bath this morning since Cain had made it clear he hated it and asked him not to wear it when with him, if at all possible.
Hello everyone - I'm sorry, from the bottom of my heart about the delay.
Otherwise, how else would he still be allowed to savour honey, read a good book by the fire
Secondary genders: male/female/non-binary/gender-fluid/intersex
The prince looks over everyone at the table and they’re staring right back at him, some are annoyed, but most seem surprised - as if Castiel is in the wrong here for becoming disquieted.
Castiel takes his hand off the back of the sofa, “Forgive me. I do not mean to be such a bad guest.”
“She would probably force Gabriel to marry this person if only because it would mean finally washing her hands off of him,” the prince says matter-of-factly. It is no secret that his mother finds Gabriel’s actions distasteful and downright disgraceful. Of course, seeing as she had dismissed her son as soon as he failed to present as an alpha or omega after showering him with the same devotion as her first two sons… Well, Castiel will not say it is his mother’s fault - however, he is also not saying it is
The beta throws him a weird look that Cas cannot interpret before asking them to take a seat. The alpha takes the blanket off the omega’s shoulders and keeps hold of his hand as he takes a seat. Cas makes sure to replace the blanket over his knees immediately.
His brows furrow. From the moment he woke up on the monastery’s steps, confused and frightened at the unknown place, language,
you are willing to give me.”
Dior stares at the alpha in front of him - stares at the submissive way he hangs his head, putting his long neck on display, the way he averts his eyes. Dior starts shaking, unsure why he feels like he wants to rip his skin off his own flesh.
To his benefit, the alpha doesn’t bat an eyelid when he turns down the hallway and yells back for them, “I’ll go. You - all of you - get a move on. The physician charges hourly
“Y’know, the usual. Getting ready to have my brain plowed by Dick Roman, which is - you know - ironic.” She snickered.
Castiel was the first to get out, followed immediately by Balthazar. They made their way to the imposing arch in front of them, side by side. Four main figures could be spotted amongst what could’ve easily been a small army of knights, maids and butlers. King Azazel of France stood with a straight back, tall, imposing and radiating Alpha pheromones. His crown was gleaming in the winter sun, gems of all colours sparkled genuinely, even with no movement, atop intricate gold designs. Next to him were three slender figures of differing heights who could be no one else but his three daughters and only children. Castiel had received portraits of the whole French Royal family so it would be impossible to mistake them for anyone else. Nobody, not even Britain, could live with the embarrassment of their Prince being unable to recognise the leaders of one of their allies.
Cas hears Dior cough and mutters something that sounds suspiciously like ‘
. The Prince was funny, and kind, and warm, smelled amazing and… And was under the impression he could ever do anything to upset a prostitute. That
Perhaps the most heart-stopping detail are the ear coverings. They are two circles with fur on the outside but the inside is sewn with a smooth piece of fabric of the same colour as the embroidery. When Dior turns his head to exchange another smile with Caesar, Castiel notices a single, big snowflake sewn onto one of the circles and there is a piece of braided fabric going around the whole top of his head, too rigid to not be covering a sturdier material - a metal band, maybe?
Dior is thankful at that moment that she is a beta because if this is her reaction just seeing Dior, he doesn’t want to know what she’d look like if she could smell him.
Dior’s stomach clenches, those very words hitting too close to home for his comfort. He privately wonders if glass shards dull with every stab at his life force or if words will always hurt this much in the right context. He swallows.
“Crowley,” he says more confidently than he feels, fists tightening next to his hips, “Lisa’s not down yet. I was going to check on her and ask her to come down.”
“Of course, Monsieur Cain. I would be overjoyed to help you. You have been nothing but kind to me, how could I ever refuse this of you? Please, do not fret. I will do my best to provide you with
!” one of the girls chipped in, coming quickly to rest her elbows on the edge next to him. She was a wispy thing with a mop of brown hair. “Adrien had a client today that -” before she could finish the sentence the rest of them erupted in giggles again and one of the boys submerged himself completely under the water, groaning.
“Princess Abbadon, I see you have found my wayward prince. I am deeply indebted to you,” Balt bowed low and kissed one of the princess’ hands. “I will take this troublemaker off your hands so you can return to the table. Your sisters have been anxiously awaiting your return.”
Cain had been generous enough to lend him was filled with at-home remedies for small ailments. Dior remembers one of them explained how to heat camomile water, brace someone’s head over the steam from it with a towel on top of their head to keep it in a confined space. This is supposed to be almost always effective in unblocking a snotty nose.
Those absolutely heavenly, vibrating notes start for the second time tonight. Only this time he is feeling it directly against the sensitive skin of his neck. Feeling every single purr start and stop seamlessly into the next one.
There is a buzz thrumming under the alpha’s skin, restlessness taking over his entire body, fueled by the excitement of knowing he is mere hours away from spending the evening in Dior’s presence. He smiles at his friend, unable to stop his mouth from doing so even if he wanted - an impossible feat when he thinks of the omega’s quick wit, kind, verdant eyes and the lilt of his voice.
“However, it appears being awarded these countless privileges has made them reckless and, dare I say…
Everything hurts, everything’s
in the history of fuck you’s. If he had thought his heart had taken a beating when the Prince didn’t seem to be interested in him earlier, then the way his skin seemed to want to peel away from his bones and the searing pain in his ribcage was nothing short of a death row.
Castiel couldn’t help but chuckle in response. Charlie had been the first person to try to befriend him, all spark and wit. He’d been taken aback by her crass way of talking at first but quickly realised it meant she was comfortable around him, a detail he appreciated. He was glad that Charlie had spotted him and deemed him appropriate for a friendship.
His musings are cut short by Jesse straightening and grabbing his own, refilled cup and encouraging Cas to do the same.
“You’d think you all were the impatient omegas here, not the whore, Alastair!” Uriel snapped back to the man across from him. “I’ll fold.”
For the love of all fucks please shut up!
,” she murmurs so low, Dior is half-hoping he’s heard her wrong.
He goes over and kneels in front of her. “I know you’re tired, and I don’t blame you, but I need you to listen to me for a second,” he instructs.
He does not linger on it. He cannot - despite wanting to reciprocate right away. He does not allow himself to think about how the man would look with drooping eyelids, breathing softly, body pliant-
Looking at Dior, at his undressed state, at his exquisite soul surrounded by filth and dying sun rays-
The hand muff is made from the same fur as the cape, decorated with the same blue snowflakes on the hems.
“I have many visits to make today. It will have to be plain soap. Please do make Alfie aware I am awake and will require his assistance after I have bathed.”
The woman makes some short calculations on the border of her page and taps the graphite of the pencil once before she says “That’ll be a total of ten francs, sweetheart. Seven for the board and three for food.”
Once Dior is well and truly gone, only then does Castiel allow himself to tell the carriage driver to make his way back to the palace. He then settles back onto the seat, in the space the omega had occupied only a few minutes past, but which feels like an eternity already.
Castiel hears a high whimper which he believes to be from his counterpart at first, but realises soon enough that it was actually Dior, who has now dropped his head in the crook of his neck, nose tenderly pressing behind his ear.
“Was that a- was that a
“No - nothing of the sort. Jack’s getting into the phase of putting everything in his mouth and he’s going to start crawling soon,” he says, this time confident in his answer.
“Saying
The prince and the omega turn their heads sharply - both surprised by the sound, having forgotten where they were. Jesse places the tray on the coffee table in front of them.
This time, Caesar is the one that coughs and when the prince looks towards the couple, neither are looking at them, both very interested in either their drinks - which Castiel swears must be gone by now.
“I can honestly say I have never felt such irritation before! And I have
pooling into his blood, pulsing with every heartbeat. The touches were innocent enough - Dior being used to a lot more - but he was still surprised to feel his arousal build up, aware he should be afraid of what could happen if slick started slipping in his undergarments and yet not finding it in himself to care.
“It appears a carriage has lost part of its wheel and is obstructing the way, my Lord,” he says.
Listening to the low growl in his mind and letting the wisps of worry flow in his veins - he is grateful. He and his counterpart have always been at odds, not a lot of that harmonious coexistence books speak about - but this is one thing they are in unanimous agreement.
,” he whispers, in lieu of a greeting.
. Castiel clutched at his heart willing it to slow down, to give him a reprieve. His knees felt weak, making standing up painful and his balance was off, staggering when he turned around toward exit.
His thumb never stops stroking. The purring never ceases. A cold hand finds its home atop Castiel’s, its pressure an embrace. Fingers do not intertwine, simply cradle, never slipping away from each other even as Dior’s head finds its way to the alpha’s shoulder - smoothly, like the path was predetermined. Like this was always the only thing that could have ever happened.
Dior takes another step, grabbing his outwear from his arms with hasty grace, “Thank you,” he says and puts them on a clothes rack next to the door.
And so he sits outside the room, head a mess, wondering where the conversation had gone wrong - why the man had reacted so. Was it the present? Was it Castiel’s inability to flirt back? It would not be the first time his inadequacy would cause discomfort to the people in his vicinity. He turns every possibility every which way in his head - but is unable to come to a conclusion. Each one seems just as likely to be the cause as not.
There were a couple of lords and ladies that were smoking on the adjacent balcony, a few people were hovering around the pool table, holding glasses that appeared to contain hard spirits, and others were playing darts. Something - or rather someones - that stood out to him, were a very handsome pair of omegas dressed in matching, stark white and feathered outfits moving amongst the patrons fluidly. Amongst the black and dark coloured outfits, Castiel dared to say they were quite blinding. His gaze followed them moving around the room, inhaling a sharp breath when the woman leaned on one of the sitting patron’s back, her deeply exposed bosom evidently pushing against the man’s neck and shoulder. He realised he must have been staring for far longer than he thought since he felt Balthazar’s hand clasp on one of his shoulders.
“I find myself forced to agree with you, Cassie. England has its own charm, but the French just have a way with artistry.” his friend hummed in reply, apparently pleased with Castiel’s approval.
, but this is one of those times. The box is full to the brim with trinkets, toiletries, and accessories he’s gotten over the years from his clients. They’re not all expensive or luxury items but they’re all untouched, due to varying reasons, and thus could fetch a pretty price to the right buyer.
Hoping to disengage himself quickly from this shit-show, he clears his throat and continues walking towards the back of the house. “No secret. You should take another look at the books, Crowley,” he says, quickly ducking through the door behind the alpha’s desk, a loud, frustrated, and high-pitched groan resounding behind him.
“Possibly by seeing the top of it coming through it?”
Dumbfounded, Dior places both of his palms on her soft, blonde curls and caresses her softly, “Hey, now. None of that. I’m fine,” he reassures her, placing a kiss at the top of her head and then looks at everyone else. “A migraine. Nothing a lavender bath won’t be able to fix, yeah?”
“Your Highness, Prince Castiel, Lord Balthazar has arrived,” their butler announced as he was finishing his tea.
And so, he pushes himself to start the fire in order to heat up the water. He’s barely managed to put the first pail on top of the fire when he comes to the realisation that his sense of smell is completely gone. Dior’s sense of smell has always been acute so finding himself without it is a shock to his system, panic seeping in slowly but surely.
By some miracle he makes it to his room in one, sweaty, heavy breathing piece, brings up the water on the dumbwaiter and fills his bath. He rummages desperately through one of his desk drawers, the box of scent-neutralising herbs almost slipping from his grasp. Fuck, he can’t
They all said ‘ewww’ in unison and had all degrees of disgust on their faces. He cared a great deal about these kids. He knew what it was like to be discarded by society and be regarded as useless. Having a roof over their heads, even if they were giving something so precious in return, was a blessing. At least they were all registered with the government, which meant they were protected against being arrested or in danger of being raped whilst trying to survive on the streets. He gave Lorette, the brown-haired girl, a kiss on the forehead and told them to quit the gossip and finish washing. Dior then took care of his own bath, filling a pail with water and sending it up using the dumbwaiter.
“Are we ready, gentlemen?” He asked around the table, looking at each of the players, locking eyes for no more than a second, giving them a playful smile.
There are also lone figures standing under the sparsely spaced lampposts. Some have small floating embers from cigarettes accompanying them, others are inspecting their fingernails. One is even rotating around one of the poles suggestively.
“Does this mean I’m in the clear this week?” he asks, slipping into his nightshirt.
Lisa’s chocolate eyes meet his and it feels like they’re on a peaceful warpath - a true oxymoron. Dior shuts up. He’s been witness to this Lisa before and he knows she’s walked the same path as him, knows that were he to say anything further, he’d only hurt both himself and her.
He wrote down the address, turned the laptop off, and got ready for some shut-eye before Jack woke up for his bottle in a few hours.
The Prince got him
Dior leaves the room and breaks into a half-run down the stairs to the second floor, heading straight to Lisa’s room, grabbing a change of clothes and her toiletries. It’s barely two minutes he’s been gone but he’s still expecting to find her crying again or, worse, gone.
They sit in comfortable silence, their breaths and water lapping softly the only sounds in the room. It’s when he takes her other arm that Lisa speaks again, “I’m in a lot of trouble,” she says, voice wavering slightly but not taking on that distinct wetness.
"So, are we ready for our upcoming journey to one of my home countries?" Balthazar said, waking Castiel out of his reverie.
= a semi-permanent transfer of scent pheromones to another person; needs to be done through skin contact of the scent gland and/or scent points; won’t wash out with water contact, but gradually disappears with the passage of time (anywhere between 24h to 72h, depending on how many scent points have been interacted with and length of exposure); parents will do it to their children to provide comfort and (depending on environment) to protect them from unsavoury characters; if done between unmated and unrelated individuals, it is usually a sign of being spoken for romantically/a warning for other unmated individuals to not approach the person in hopes of romantic/sexual involvement; again, scents only mingle for very compatible individuals.
is your favourite flower, Dior?”
Castiel wished it had been that simple and that he didn’t have to go to bed tonight without being absolutely smothered by that smell.
, she had been older than most omegas, her personality more than halfway formed, making it hard for her to adjust. It took a while for her to stop looking like she’d consider doing something… something stupid.
The thought alone makes Castiel’s skin itchy with anger, grief and hopelessness. Logically, he knows he could not have helped, because they did not know of the other’s existence - but the feeling of having failed yet another person permeates him.
However, there is only one that could possibly begin to encompass this.
Dior’s head starts throbbing, reminding him he is, in fact, feeling like shit. God, he just wants a break.
Castiel does not feel as though he is in his right mind… which is probably why the next thing he says is, “You can call me a liar - call me anything under the sun - if it will make you smell like sunshine again.”
There’s an echo of
Castiel nods and they make their way through the paths, admiring the multitude of trees on their every side. Dean was right - their selection was very wide and Castiel briefly wondered how hard it was to keep track of all of them and if the upkeep was worth the profit. The land, from what he could see, was actually quite impressive in size, having walked for maybe five minutes and not yet arrived at their destination.
Lisa simply shrugs, “I’m about three months along, seems like a perfect time as any.”
Dior does not reply, seemingly concentrated on becoming aware of his breathing and state of wakefulness. The moment he comes to the conclusion that Castiel is not wrong, he shuts his eyes and groans.
“Ours,” Castiel is quick to correct him. Dior turns to him only to raise a suspicious eyebrow. “No need for that look, now. I rented it for the next month solely for the purpose of seeing you.”
Castiel sighed and put him back into the baby carrier basket, making sure he had his bee sleep aid turned on. The boy clung to it immediately, burying his little head into the material and looking at his uncle with the most miserable eyes.
“Would you like to join me on this side of the carriage?” Dior asks again, and slides to one side in one fluid movement. Castiel would be admiring his poise if only his brain was in working order and not flooded with images of shared body heat and brief touches. The
He bites the inside of his cheek, mind reeling at the information it’s trying to process. He hadn’t expected to get a lot out of this jewelry, fifteen francs being what he had hoped for. If the book was to be believed, then he’s sure the silver necklace itself would be worth at least eight livres.
“Really.”
was the smell getting ever stronger the closer he got to the ballroom. A horrible yet wondrous feeling set in his stomach. He stopped walking as realisation hit him.
to him. Dior could just- he could-
“I do not care,” he tells Dior, not looking up and repeating the process with his other glove now. “You must be freezing! I apologise profusely - if only I had realised it earlier-”
Dior watches her move back behind her own table. He looks down at his feet, takes a deep breath, and starts yelling.
“Phenomenal!” the alpha beamed, looking close to ecstatic. “Tell me how this works, I have never called upon such an institution. Would an appointment be appropriate?”
There are no more chilly droplets, trickling - there are only warm rivulets of sins painted in red.
“I am afraid this will be the first time I will have played poker.” Prince Castiel said, looking slightly abashed at the cards in front of him.
Castiel is frozen to his seat.
“I can’t hide in your room forever, Dior. You have clients,” she tells him, looking at him like he’s lost his mind.
“That is correct. A truly remarkable flower indeed.”
They are halfway through the journey back to the palace so Castiel rationalizes that although there will be nobody to open the door anymore, he can simply put it in the letterbox, thus not breaking any of the institution’s rules.
Concubine - a person who cohabits with another person to whom they are not legally married/mated, especially one regarded as socially or sexually subservient; mistress, a secondary spouse, usually of inferior rank.
“If I may ask - how long have you two been together?”
He closed his eyes and listened to the soft wind pushing against the glass of the windows, the crackling of flames in the fireplace across from his bed, and how his breathing seemed to echo in his muscles on every exhale. He will have to attend as many social functions and balls as possible, now. He was expected to form business relationships, build lasting friendships, praise his Kingdom and not be a disappointment, of course. Nevertheless, between them, there would be plenty of time for him to explore Paris - and maybe even neighboring cities - with Balthazar or just on his own.
afterward.” Alastair whispered, giving Dior’s tightly clad rear another slap.
Castiel brings his hand up to one of the ear coverings and traces the delicate handiwork, then brings the tips of his fingers down the slope of Dior’s jaw before falling back to his side. There are many words he could use to describe what an image he paints right now - exquisite, marvelous, celestial, supernatural.
Sleep takes over without allowing him to come to terms with this devastating rejection.
Dior looked at his client whilst he spoke of his mate. He was aware that the alpha had been mated for many years and his wife had only recently passed away. The love he bore her was unmistakable. It was no wonder he became a recluse after her death. It seemed his wife had been
It doesn’t feel like a dream. They feel as real as the warmth under the blanket, as real as the alpha sitting on the floor of what has to be an inn or hotel, like he’s not a prince that could probably buy at least fifty of these establishments.
Finally, he finds a small spot next to a woman that is selling combs on a little folding table. He approaches her, dread pooling in his abdomen. The woman’s voice becomes clearer the closer he gets, her voice hoarse from shouting.
Dior blinks once, slowly, and Castiel is lost to do anything but follow the path of his eyelashes, how they touch cheekbones before returning to their initial position. “Where are we heading, Castiel?”
Dior’s pulse beats and beats and beats. Life is being breathed back into his deformed existence.
“Ruby was on a warpath again this morning,” Aiden moans, slumping down in his chair and leaning his head against the backrest. “She started pacing aggressively before the sun rose. I’ve told her it makes it sound like the walls are falling apart when she does that. Did she care, though? Of course not,” he gripes with a dramatic rise of both his arms, then letting them flop lifelessly on his lap. “I’m so tired.”
“After we are finished in the library, I thought we might enjoy today by visiting the Louvre. It has been a while since I have been,” the alpha said.
“Yes - just the once. A reply to my second letter pertaining to a detailed recounting of the meetings and mingling we have partaken in,” he says, tone flat.
“Goodness me, Your Highness! I came as soon as the servants left me. I was worried about your virtue!” he exclaimed.
“My family, country and I welcome you. You can raise yourselves.” and so Castiel and Balt did, meeting the King’s eyes. “And thank you. For being here and solidifying our budding friendship. We hope you enjoy your stay.”
“Ah, you’re too much, Lisa. I enjoy it so it’s not completely selfless, you know,” he teases back.
He does not have the capacity to focus anymore on the wonderful piece. Instead, he cannot help but notice that if he were to push his fingers in with a little more force, he would be touching the man’s chest - and were he a worthier man, perhaps even his heart.
“I can’t deny that. But I am still fine. Besides…” he trails off, taking his other hand out of the muff and cradles it loosely in front of him.
? Shall we stop the game for now and return to the main room? A group of such esteemed and handsome Alphas should not be hidden away from the main activities.” He purred, shivering inwardly. God, he hated all of them so much and wanted to gag at the scent of arousal coming from Alastair. He could feel his hand snaking up his arse, groping him.
It’s been years since he’s been to a market of any sort, but he passes them by regularly whilst in clients’ carriages. With a vague idea of where he needs to go, Dior keeps a steady pace and burrows his face into his coat lapels, the wind chipping at his face, turning his skin pink. He jostles the bag higher up on his shoulder and shoves his hands inside his pockets in an attempt to keep his fingers from locking up.
You have eased the worries of this old man,” Cain replied. He already did appear in better spirits. “I know I don’t have to worry about you, but you ought to know there will be the most distinguished guests in attendance. The other duke, viscounts, marquises, etcetera. I have also invited the foreign representatives the Royals are currently hosting. The Royal family itself as well, of course. But they never make an appearance, the invitation was just a courtesy.”
needs to take you a peg or two - or four - down, no?” Castiel replies, stopping in front of a tree when movement catches his eye.
As if he’s never been home. As if he suddenly knew what a true home feels like and his heart threatens to barrage out of his ribcage in revenge for denying it this feeling for the last twenty-four years of his life.
What he knew is that he will most certainly never be the same after…
After she looks satisfied that he hasn’t caught dog mange or anything as morbid, she pulls on gloves and drags his knees up and apart, exposing him in a very similar - yet awfully different - way to the position he takes on for his clients.
“No, I- What?”, he stutters. “I’m really not.”
“Okay… why American?”
?” Crowley snaps. The bawd looks over to Dior, a malicious glint appearing in his eyes. Great - now he’s getting dragged into this fight. “Why don’t you ask the omega of the hour what his secret is?” he says, waving an unconcerned hand towards Dior’s general direction.
jumping around erratically in his head.
The prince is taken by surprise, an undignified grunt escaping him as he stares at where his hand disappears alongside Dior’s, unable to tear his eyes away from the source of warmth currently bleeding into his fingers.
Everything is red.
I've decided to upload this chapter and the next one together so I hope it makes up for the wait!
Castiel smiled. To everyone that bothered to ask, he’d told them Jack was his son and not his nephew. Maybe it was the cowardly thing to do, but it was better to have them assume he was a single dad rather than having them awkwardly shuffle off after being offered the truth.
“No, make sure everyone baths properly,” he grunts, not turning back.
The cover is nondescript, a simple pink background with a silver border. Dior opens it and is greeted by rows and rows of baby names, followed by their pronunciation and their meanings.
They stop admiring the Arc de Triomphe and continue down the boulevard that heads through Champs-Élysées, toward Jardin des Tuileries. The winter foliage is as verdant as its warm-climate counterparts, tens upon tens of gas street lights illuminating the walkways weaving around it, creating soft, warm shadows. It makes the thick layer of snow appear bronze and inviting. If you paid close attention to the immediate vicinity of one such intricate metal lamp, you could see the slight drizzle of snow that was falling.
To his surprise, everyone managed a chuckle at his expense, and breakfast continues without further heaviness. Gabriel never does show his face and Castiel wonders if he ate with the stable boys.
The funny thing about taking care of a baby, time seems to both flow rapidly and screech to a halt at the same time. It feels both like a lifetime and barely a minute since they’ve moved to Sioux Falls at the end of October. Now, November was almost over and Christmas was a looming worry.
It was very unbecoming, he knew, but he felt the need to feel the stretch of his limbs in a way that wasn’t straight and stiff.
Cas cannot help but smirk at that reply, “So I am told on a frequent basis by Balthazar.”
“Hush now - I thought we were in agreement that you are the odd one in this case-”
“Is that why you- why you were gone today?”
refused Royalty unless they had a death wish. That night - and every night she had come since then - he had wondered whether death would be so bad, worse than the burning pains and humiliation.
Cas looks dismayed, “Surely, that is illegal? It is preposterous!”
“You may all stand,” Crown Princess Abbadon demanded, and so they all did. “Do not let our presence keep you from enjoying the festivities. My sisters and I are here to show our support in our father - your King’s - stead to Grand Duke Cain.”
Lisa stares, taking everything in as if she can’t believe Dior is in possession of such things. “You’re not actually going to sell these? They’re yours, Dior. They were
He knots his belt with more force than strictly necessary, walking towards the door. With his hand on the knob, he turns towards the other two and throws them his perfected smile, the one that never fails to relax even the more aggravated alphas.
,” he starts, hand freeing the bag strings slightly, “I’m here for a friend. Do you have any rooms available?”
“Your Highness, you must not! I will be severely berated if the head maid ever found out I let you light the fire with your precious hands.” the maid frantically said, hurrying to Castiel’s side.
“We can, my Lord, but that will add time to our journey.”
A small bucket appears out of nowhere and no sooner than it does, Dior leans over it and brings up his breakfast along with what feels to be the entirety of his stomach contents. It’s bitter and disgusting, the taste sticking to his teeth and provoking another wave of nausea. He watches as the bucket slowly fills with his waste and he dazedly wonders if one can die from such a thing.
“I loved it,” Dior says, expression soft, thankful - smell repulsive. “It was - it was the best thing I have ever received, Castiel.”
Typically, this is when Jack started fussing. “Oh no, buddy.” Castiel said, stopping and going around to the front of the stroller. He quickly checked his nappy - clean - then checked his temperature - seemed normal. “He must be hungry. I’m so sorry about this - he usually goes longer without a bottle-” he starts explaining but Jack’s muffled sniffs have evolved into crying.
King Azazel talked of his many concubines and of his dreams of having as many alpha children as possible, to assure that his bloodline remained on the throne. He did not wish to take another wife. Castiel kept quiet through most of that topic as he was not knowledgeable about how legitimacy worked in France. By God’s grace, Balthazar was well-informed where he wasn’t, not allowing a stall in conversation or silence to permeate the room.
Dior does not move his hands from where they are sitting bent at the elbows, expression serene, “He can’t know I told you about him not keeping the presents, Cas. I’m the one who will bear the repercussions, and once he realises that you-” he swallows, “-that you care enough to give me gifts
This isn’t what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. But he didn’t know anyone who had tried leaving it and had neither ended back in or dead somewhere on the streets. There was also no way of him saving up any money. Seventy percent of his earnings went to taxes for being registered and the rest went to Crowley for his food and shelter. He didn’t even buy his own clothes. That, again, was done by Crowley and his secretary. There wasn’t anything he owned in this world. Not his furniture, not the clothes on his back, not even his own damn name. How fucking depressing was that?
Meg laughed a pretty laugh, very much unlike her usual ones - the ones she gave Balt and Castiel in her waiting room back at the palace. “It is true my sisters and I prefer to do the inviting rather than be invited. However, the King thought it appropriate to show his support to his oldest ally on his return.”
! Can I interest you in one of our lovely pieces?” she asks him, hand resting on her throat.
“If I have slighted you, I suppose it is only right for me to repay you,” he says and Dior nods very seriously, his mouth turning up even more. “But, alas, I believe there is nowhere to purchase such an item at this hour. There is no time, either.”
“You’re sick,” she says.
is fine - I quite like it. And yes, I am aware, thank you.”
Cas watches bemused as Dior groans before he catches sight of his hands in Cas’ and the new scent in the carriage. The prince has the good manners to look abashed when the other man asks, “Did you - Castiel did you
. The wrist is one of a body’s scent points and there is still fucking NOTHING!
“Yes. I had to- I had to be
The omega whips his head around immediately, heart hammering in his chest, wide eyes staring at the shape in front of his door - Lisa. His body is close to sagging in relief at seeing her in his vicinity, but when he takes a closer look, the relief flies out of the window.
“What? How are you going to do that? Dior-” she starts saying, confusion obvious.
“Your Highness,
“I won’t keep you. I just have something for you and then you can go, alright?”
Heart pounding, Dior makes his way to the kitchen door, “I’ll check. Clean up for me, please?”
It takes merely six steps to reach Dior physically, but he feels miles apart. It truly is - misery.
“Novak,” he replies.
. Please do join us before long.”
He makes his way over, crouching next to the tub and grabbing a clean cloth, using Lisa’s own soap to create suds. He scoops one of her arms out of the water and starts cleaning her tenderly.
Castiel wants to weep. His wolf does it for him.
for it,” he tells Castiel, voice now a disturbed whisper.
.” Castiel sighed. “I’m aware he won’t remember anything but- but maybe…” he trails off, throat suddenly tight. Castiel is ashamed to say his eyes prick.
. I simply wish to help.”
Castiel turned towards his friend with his whole body and leaned in, patting his friend's knee fondly. "Thank you. I know. You must know there is no one I hold in higher regard than you, except for my blood family. I vow you, I shall try my best to be a most congenial companion."
Dior’s grip on him loosens and the prince can smell roasted pecans giving away the beginnings of his irritation.
There is silence after that. It is deeply, crushingly, beautifully expectant.
“Very well. And afterwards, we will be dining for lunch in a town restaurant, if you’re agreeable,” Cain said. At this point, Dior would be willing to do anything the alpha wanted. Today was going to be one he’d remember for the rest of his life, he knew.
go away with my bath tonight.”
“Why?” Cas asks him, simply and straightforward.
“How clever! And warm on top of that,” he says, then quickly takes one his hands out and grabs one of Castiel’s, pushing both of them inside together.
. That thought alone made it worth it for Castiel. He wanted the people to feel protected and secure in their peace. It had been a long time coming and they all deserved this.
“An appointment would ensure that I am otherwise not… preoccupied.” Dior informed him, grimacing. “I reside at
The carriage has been parked in front of the building for twenty minutes and Castiel is both drunk on honeyed pecans and despairing over the passing of time.
about it?
It’s easy to miss when the shadow retreats and the sun descends.
“France and its Royal Family are honoured to welcome Castiel James the First, third Prince of England and His Grace Balthazar Sebastian of the Roché Duchy, arriving as foreign dignitaries, a sign of goodwill between two great Kingdoms.” they heard a servant announce, moments before their door was opened.
Both Cas and Jesse are taken out of their respective reveries when the sound of a door creaking open fills the room. The beta does not move from his laid-back position on the chair but the alpha puts down his cup hastily and straightens his back in anticipation. He wants this to be a good experience for Dior. He wants him to look back on their time together and think of it - of
Castiel opted not to worry his friend further. He did not know how Balthazar would react to finding out his stiff and always-put-together friend had had some sort of mental-slash-alpha breakdown in the middle of Paris. He told Balt he had just been distracted by the art and had lost track of time, which was plausible, further proved by the fact his friend readily accepted that excuse.
Thankfully, the herbs do their job and Dior’s clients are none the wiser once he’s applied some synthetic cinnamon pheromone perfume to his scent points.
“That. Just. Will. Not. Do.”
It’s a completely valid concern and rule, but when he thinks of Castiel’s honest gaze and trembling hands... He finds that he appears to have suddenly grown reckless.
If at all possible, Dean’s face changes shades completely, going from pink to bright red. If this was one of Jack’s cartoons, Castiel thinks he might have had smoke coming out of his ears. He found it ridiculously endearing and so much harder to take his eyes away from him. If anything, Dean’s flustered reaction has given Castiel a confidence boost.
The young man doesn’t turn back, so he’s not aware of the eyes fixed on his back, a head shaking in disbelief whilst a small fistful of coins is stored in a skirt pocket. No - he doesn’t see the warmth he leaves behind.
. They shook hands and the alpha promised to be in contact with Crowley tomorrow in order to book the required days. Dior heads inside with a smile on his face, a bunch of books under his arm, anxious but happy. And, of course, that would be when Crowley had to open his pie hole and ruin it for him.
And so he does, after they fall into each other, hug tight, eyelashes damp. Dior doesn’t feel like he deserves the honour; wishes he didn’t feel like the whole world is keen to see him become dust.
It’s a busy day, people walking up and down the streets, everyone looking like they’re on a mission. Dior wonders if he looks like that once he starts making his way towards the market.
“Thrilled,” he finally answers.
When Castiel returns inside the carriage, Dior is still shivering, but has, at the very least, found his voice again.
“I need to leave,” Lisa speaks up, dragging Dior away from his spiraling thoughts.
“Dior, you have my word- I’m not going anywhere.”
Dior remains silent but he takes not his gaze away from Castiel’s. Instead, both of the omega’s hands wrap around his wrist abruptly, tightly enough it might have made him flinch in a different setting. The hand muff falls to his lap with a thud.
His hands tremble where they’re tight around the Prince’s bicep and forearm. His fingers turn pale with the force he presses into hard, straining muscle and thick cashmere.
“That won’t be necessary-” the omega attempts again.
He doesn’t say anything.
He all but started running to take another corner when he collided with a sturdy body, causing him to stumble like a pup that had not yet learned to walk. For a split second, he was afraid he might actually hit the ground but a strong and comforting arm caught him round the waist and steadied him with a hand on his shoulder.
Dior gets up and runs out of the room.
“But I suppose it won’t hurt to share a bit of my days with you,” he finishes, not minding the prince’s answer.
“Thank you, Hannah. You may leave me to bathe on my own today as well.” he told her, not looking up from his work.
Before anyone can answer, the kitchen door swings open and Crowley looks at Dior then past him, addressing them as a collective unit. “Glad to see we’re all ready. Doctor Sunders is here,” he says and turns his gaze to Dior, this time explicitly talking to him. “Ruby’s done you her usual courtesy of taking your place of being first in line.”
“You have a lovely marriage,” he states.
And Castiel means it. If Dior asked, he would take him to the end of the world a thousand times over, only asking that the omega take him with and allow him to worship his every action, offering him prayers like a sinner on their deathbed.
Dior encourages his scent to blanket the other man, to soothe him, to assure him there is no threat here. That there never was one, that Dior is-
Dior thought he was doing a great job. Even fantastic, really. It seemed like everyone he interacted with was sucked into his game and left reeling with arousal. He knew he was now trickling slick into his bottoms, unable to do anything about it or care that much. Nobody would dare touch him when his alpha was
“Well - I mean, of course.” Dior started, confused as to why an alpha of the Prince’s status would even contemplate stepping into a
“Joseph, bring out a full breakfast spread for our guest,” the alpha asked of his butler, and the man made his way toward the kitchen.
“What are
“What about your sister? Or perhaps your father? I am eager to listen,” the omega says, looping their arms together again and tactfully steering him down the pathways once again. The snow is falling a bit heavier now, the crowd of people thinner than before, their steps crunching underneath.
He didn’t mean to sound so fucking desperate, despite actually being more than fucking desperate. He can’t leave Lisa stranded, can’t let her succumb to the same fate so many others before her have. He will protect her and her pup even if it costs him his life, as little value as it has.
never be, either.”
“Maybe they’ve retired for the night -” Dior says but is interrupted by the brusque opening of the wooden door.
Castiel could feel himself bristling at the words, anger trickling up his neck. The impertinence and coarseness of the older alpha were unbelievable. Insulting not only their host in his own home but also attacking his late mate, whom he seemed to have loved immensely. Alastair was the type of alpha the Prince hated most and he has had just about enough of letting them get away with their attitude.
use rut helpers!” Balt almost shouts, nose flaring and scent amplifying, making it obvious the alpha isn’t pleased - quite livid, actually.
“That is…” Cas whispers but doesn’t finish his thoughts.
His eyes began to burn. No. He can’t think about this now. At least not right before going to work. Maybe tonight, after Jack is in bed and he can wallow on the sofa for a few hours before the boy needs to be fed again.
“How did you get in without anyone noticing, Lisa?” he asks her.
His breath hiccups when he feels a feeble reverberation, as soft as a bee’s buzz, through his fingers, travelling from the omega’s chest, up his throat and singing a hymn into the jaw.
A beat, two.
“Did you - I must have imagined it, but did you just
“No. But it stopped as it began - swiftly,” Dior shakes his head and rolls his neck experimentally. He feels oddly hollow as if he’s missing a very important piece of information. He tries to remember what it was that went through his head at the time but he’s coming up blank. It feels like something happened, a shadow billowing behind him begging to be looked at - but when he turns around to do so it disappears and he’s unable to gaze upon it.
It does not feel deserved when his dull words are rewarded with Dior’s pleased smile. The prince carefully extracts his hand, as to not let on the storm brewing in his heart. Dior returns his other hand inside and turns back to the spouses.
At this Dior looks up, food now finished. “Wait, he still hasn’t sent someone on the errand?” he asks, voice taking on a tone of urgency. “Shit - Millie’s almost out of neutralising herbs and Chrissie needs a new nightshirt - not to mention both the rubber and skin condoms are running out,” he curses.
“No - It is just a scent blanket, I promise,” the prince hurries to explain. “I had hoped it would wake you up gently and relaxed - you were dreadfully tight in the shoulders.”
Castiel fit jack in the crook of his neck, gave him a dummy, gathered up his blanket, sleep aid, and teething ring - just in case - and then his own laptop. He laid down in his bed, back to the headboard, baby on his chest and laptop in his lap.
“Oh, yes,
“My late wife,” Cain started, “she was an artist. She enjoyed art as much as she enjoyed life. It would not be far-fetched to say that she lived and breathed art. We spent much of our free time together; but when I was gone, art was her lover.”
“You need to go,” he hears the beta man say. “I’m not going to be able to keep her back any longer.”
He hasn’t opened it yet. Will it disappear afterward? The same way a mirage caused by dehydration in the desert disappears once you’ve managed to find some water - some relief.
“What would
“Yes,” Cas replies, unsure what exactly Dior is referring to, but knowing he has meant every single thing that he has let out into the world today.
“You flatter us with such companionship, Meg. Please do address us as Castiel and Balthazar. A courtesy of this magnitude must be offered back,” Balthazar said.
Dior laughed. “You guys will find that people have all sorts of fetishes. They might even ask you to let them lick your
It didn’t take long for him to realise that this was not an invitation he could refuse. Being invited to a private gathering during a ball of such grandeur, away from prying ears, meant that he was being shown favoritism by the Royal Family. Whether that was a positive or negative development, he would have to see.
A smirk fights its way onto the doc’s usually-stoic face. “Are you, perhaps, glad I didn’t assault your genitals first this time?”
It’s like ice water being doused on him and the omega reels back, snatching his hand away.
Dior stares, bewildered. The working omegas are
“Brilliant. We are looking for a full winter outfit,” the prince says and he can see Dior turning his head sharply in his periphery. “A three-piece suit, coat and winter accessories - to take away right now.”
Berating himself for forgetting to leave such an important document with the man at the desk today, he looks out of the window to discern where he is. But it is too dark and the prince does not know the area well enough, and so he asks his driver.
Lisa?”
: I have no clue how selling couture pieces worked in the 1800s but I decided that couturiers had to protect their art somehow. If you read this and happen to know, please do tell me and I will be your fan 5ever <3
Castiel turns to him almost sharply, eyebrows slanted in disapproval, “Absolutely not.”. And just to prove how serious he is to the omega he- “We’re taking this. I trust you have his measurements now?”
Dior doesn’t hesitate before grabbing the coins and exiting the pawnshop. He thinks he hears ‘fucking cock slut’ in his wake. He almost smiles - now, that’s more familiar.
The snow lays thickly on the ground, glinting daintily in the sun, footprints littered everywhere - glimpses into the lives of the people that have trudged through it. Castiel imagines the people they belong to and where they might be headed. It does not cease to amaze him how every single person on this planet has their own story, struggles, joys and loves.
like, monsieur?” Caesar asks Dior directly.
?” he asks, voice gruff.
short of presenting himself. All for one incredibly mouth-watering alpha, with eyes blue enough that made Dior wonder if he’d ever even known the colour before, black hair so wild it looked like he’d just come back from a tryst - a thought which filled him with senseless jealousy.
They arrived at the palace shortly after midday struck. This time, there was a grand reception, many people gathering before the gates, colourful paper confetti thrown around, cheers being heard from every angle, French royal guards riding in a march in front and behind their carriage (an ostentatious thing that bore his family’s insignia but so very French in its design). He and Balthazar waved to the masses, making sure they didn't lean out the windows too much. Castiel might have been able to prevent a commotion with their arrival at the port, but he knew this display was necessary for their arrival at the capital. It was there for the people’s benefit. They needed to see, to have visual evidence, that the relationship between their countries is good, solid,
“You have my word,” he says. “I simply wanted to repay you for earlier - for when you did the same to me. I- are you mad?”
Later that afternoon, he had arrived back at the palace via a private carriage, since he had missed the servants’ one on its way back. He had sat down on a public bench, lost to the world. By the time he truly came to, the sun had started its descent and he knew he had to go back before Balthazar split open from worry and confessed everything to the King, demanding a search party.
Dean grunted and dragged his hand over his face a few times. “It’s really not that. I don’t have anything against it, I’m just very old school. But things like these-” he gestures towards the baby bottle and warmer “- they’re pretty cool and super useful. I ain’t got nothing against those.”
Castiel has never been a man for light colours. He much prefers darker hues, black being the shade he has an affinity to - regardless of how much he has been told blue suits him better. If given a choice, white would not be high on his list of preferences.
There was a moment of hesitation from his maid before she decided against reminding him that a man of his position should let his maids assist him. Hannah knew him better than that. “As you wish, Your Highness. I will let Alfie know to join you soon.”
"Yes, I know. Forgive me, Balt. I did not mean to raise my voice. I know you mean only good and I should not lose my temper for that," Castiel said, feeling dreadfully guilty for treating his friend like anything less than the wonderful person he was. "Besides, you

= the gland where scent pheromones are created; most potent ‘scent point’ of the body; located on the neck at the same level as the mating gland but towards the front, rather than the back; betas do not possess this.
The prince takes his hand away from the man’s face, leaving behind warmth and a small grumble of dissatisfaction from the omega which ties the alpha’s stomach in adoring knots. He gathers both of Dior’s lithe hands in his.
Not a lower-class noble. Not middle or upper-class, not even a Duke. The messy haired, walking fantasy of an alpha was the third Alpha Prince of England. Dior wanted to laugh. He felt positively hysterical, his life had become even more of a joke than it already was. It was one big farce after another. And this...? This must’ve been the biggest

Castiel heard Alastair and Uriel give small sounds of displeasure.
“What a shame, Your Highness. You are a very attentive pupil. I can only wish everyone was as eager as you to learn.”
Cain, as he rode the carriage to the
Dior collected all of the money and jewelry pooled in the middle of the poker table and deposited them in front of Alastair, before dropping himself slowly in his lap, snaking one hand around his shoulder and stroking his jaw whilst looking at the rest of the table. “What do we all say,
“The honour would be ours, Your Highness, the Crown Princess.” Balthazar replied, giving her what Castiel would class as his ‘killer smile’. It seemed to work as the Princess gave him a small smirk.

,” he says.
Castiel looked at his friend, eyes growing wide and more scandalised by the second. “Altercations? Over omega dominance? Dear Lord, surely we have evolved enough as a society not to fall prey to those animalistic instincts?” he frowned.
At Lisa’s weak nod, Dior resumes getting her cleaned, still as carefully as earlier but hastier. He makes sure he rubs his scent and the lavender into all of her vital scent points, disregarding Lisa’s toiletries (the generic ones Crowley provides all of his omegas) and using his ones instead (the ones Crowley buys only him and Ruby).
. A prince that allegedly wanted to give him something
The alpha doesn’t move for a while and Dior would sigh in relief if only the fucking pain would
“Would you mind giving me your coat yourself, my Prince?” he asks, still unmoving.
“Good morning, mother and father, brothers. I hope you have all rested well.” Castiel greeted, taking his seat next to Michael, who was sitting to the right of their mother. They all greeted him back and settled into casual conversation, his younger sister following him very shortly after and taking a seat next to him.
. The only ones to ever call him anything but
are courting,” Castiel counters, pushing his purpling fingers in his pockets and his chin inside the scarf he has on. He feels like a petulant child trying to get himself out of trouble. He also feels like there are a hundred needles pricking at his heart when he denies it.
He clenches his teeth and snatches the box from his pocket before the beta can say anything in response. He unties the bow hastily and almost slams it on the wooden desk with a frantic look in his eyes. The woman looks at him, concern marring her docile features but Dior pays her no heed.
what he’s doing, he’s thought this
As if this emotional whiplash hadn’t been enough,
“Yes. I will send Crowley a note requesting your presence at my residence in about a week.” Cain replied, turning back towards the stairs of the mansion, catching sight of his carriage. “I will be leaving you now, Dior. Good luck.” he greeted, giving a low bow and tipping his tophat towards Dior.
. What, did God decide he’d had enough of ugly humans and poured a few hundred years worth of beauty into this one man? High cheekbones that rolled into a perfectly sculpted jaw, chin that dipped in the middle ever so slightly - it looked like the perfect spot to pepper with kisses. Thick, pink lips perched atop the chin, sculpted to perfection as if to mock everyone else’s of their inadequacy. The alpha’s eyes were nothing short of terrifying. Dior shivered when he let himself sink into those depths. He’d seen his fair share of bright, almost icy blue eyes. But these? These radiated warmth and still managed to look the exact shade of blue you’d find at the bottom of a clear lake on a cloudy, early morning. With a rising heat in his gut, Dior wondered what they’d look like when the alpha climaxed, whether they’d brighten up or darken and whether he’d be allowed to watch them when it happened.
“I-I’ve never actually given it any thought-” Dior says but Castiel is quick to interrupt.
The prince’s lifted mood diminishes when he recalls his mother's ever so eloquent words, her underhanded comments and passive-aggressive way of reminding him to
, he thinks.
By the time they’re back at the greenhouse, the night was truly ruling over Sioux Falls. There wasn’t anyone left in the shop and Sam was just turning around the sign that said ‘Closed’.
The alpha is left in the room on his own, the crowded space suddenly seeming so much bigger, the quiet much heavier. He moves to the side of the sofa where he is in easy reach of the scarf he took off Dior. His fingers start caressing the material, with each passing brush the urge to lift it and keep it close to his chest growing stronger.
No, he didn’t own a damn, single, fucking thing. And it made him so mad. He was livid. Who was he? How did he end up here? Why was this his life? He just wanted answers, damn it all!
Castiel did not add anything to that. Instead, he started drinking his liquor a bit faster.
“Good morning,
Dior’s never had whiskey.
“Would you part with any right now for the right price?”
They get settled inside but it takes Dior no time at all to pick up the conversation again.
His friend only sighs in response, scent calming down from lighting and thunderstorms to a midsummer rain. “Nevermind. You are simply incorrigible.”
“Is that so? I have not noticed anyone being sparse with their timber or coal,” Cas replies.
“There’s an omega street-walker that- that deals with
“It’s okay - it’s okay, Jack.” he cooed, gently petting his head.
There is a short pause as Caesar seems to take this in. He sips his drink and makes an acknowledging noise whilst his husband starts chewing audibly on a biscuit.
,” Caesar confirms before he has a chance to finish his sentence and Castiel squints his eyes before continuing.
“Thank you for doing this, I won’t forget your kindness,” Cas says.
“And thank you, for teaching me poker. You saved me from humiliating myself in front of my… unlikeable peers.” Prince Castiel said, a mischievous glint in his eyes. Dior almost choked on air in his haste to keep a laugh in. For some weird reason, the Prince’s scent started turning slightly sweeter and Dior could swear he was smelling
“I am willing to become a funny, local myth if it helps Caesar,” he says. Jesse’s smile is soft and gentle whenever his husband’s name passes his lips. Cas wonders if Jesse knows that.
“You’re very charming this morning, ain’t you?” he asks her, rolling his eyes. He makes for his laundry basket but is too slow and she easily swipes it out of his grasp.
“Pardon me for my rudeness, Dior,” he says hastily.
Castiel took an amused look at his friend's face and gave him a small, encouraging smile. Yes, if he would have his way, that was how he intended to come back. Lighter in soul and soft-footed, ready to tackle responsibilities that came with being Third Alpha Price of England.
“Well, that can’t be good,” Lorette says, low enough for Dior to barely be able to hear her.
He thinks of how cold and alone the omega must have been on the streets after he had been abandoned by yet another group of people - and what a dastardly thing to do! Especially by an institution that thrives on the tax and benevolence of the people - and especially to a
“You honour me, Your Highness. It would do me great pleasure to join you,” Castiel replied, giving her his most charming smile. Or at least, he thought it was.
“I wish I did not have to leave you, that you would stuff me in a box under your bed and extract me to use as you see fit.”
“Oh, man! You’re a hoot, Castiel.” she said, “You’re here on time today. I’m impressed.”
“Obsolete, then,” the prince says.
“Yes, but I have condoms at my disposal, something most don’t. If all else fails, I still get my weekly check-up at the
The longer they walked arm in arm, the stronger the scent of delight became. Castiel thought it was him being so elated he had started smelling himself, but soon realised it was coming from the omega at his side.
Castiel confirmed and Sam continued. “Okay, so, it’s a few acres of land, full to the brim with different sorts of trees. Dean’ll know more about types and their specifics so ask him for any pointers - I’m no good with plants. You’ll walk around and see which one you like the look of, let Dean know and he’ll mark it up for you then come back here to pay and arrange a delivery-slash-collection day. We prefer selling them potted but we can cut them if that’s what you want.” he explains then takes a look down at Jack and gives his nephew a little wave. “And don’t worry about the little guy. There are paths all throughout so pushing the stroller will be easy.”
life, just like art had been hers. He spoke of her as if she was a piece of art herself, a perfect creation of God, even her faults beautiful beyond reproach.
Standing in the doorway was the most stunning man Castiel has ever seen - or could have possibly imagined. He watched as the man cursed under his breath and shook a light layer of snow off of his shoulders and hair, the drowning sun right behind him, engulfing his whole body and accentuating a perfect silhouette and - and Castiel suddenly forgot how to breathe.
The prince finds himself relocating to Dior’s bench, the omega quickly spreading the blanket across his lap as well, making sure it is tucked snugly to his side. There is a mortifying moment when Castiel thinks he will blurt out
They pass many bars and the prince has a private laugh to himself whenever groups of elder gentlemen or younger lasses come out holding onto each other and singing dubiously pitched songs, giggling like children or, in the case of a couple of them, even sobbing.
Dior maps out the bottom floor’s outline in his mind, being able to clearly imagine the sash window. Opening it from the outside shouldn’t be possible- unless, of course, you unlock it from the inside first. A small surge of pride at his friend’s sneakiness makes its way into his heart and he gives Lisa a shit-eating grin. She smiles back bashfully.
“I’m so sorry,” Cas bursts out, desperation edging in his voice. Dior stares at him uncomprehendingly. “I never meant to get in the way of- of your clients or perturb you to the point of such a severe migraine. I have no excuse for the way I acted. Please believe me when I say this has never happened before. I have… I have never even come close to initiating a feral altercation.”
“May I?”, he asks before the omega nods and he carefully places the big, soft blanket over Dior’s legs.
soon,” the alpha explained, his composure seemingly getting stiffer and scent more bitter by the second. He was now puffing his chest up and was paying minute attention to their surroundings.
“I need to go,” he tells them and turns to the bubbling pail of water. He only barely manages to remember not to grab it with his bare hands and brings it over to the dumbwaiter, dumping it inside hastily.
Slightly flummoxed by this unexpected request, Castiel scrambles to take his coat off and then his hat, holding them awkwardly on his forearm, unsure how to proceed. Should he apologise? He cannot think what else he could do - the scent is cloying, heady, stirring the wolf within that Castiel had managed to placate.
“Hey there! Can I help?” the man - Sam, his tag said - greeted. He had his hair up in a bun, dandelio-yellow apron stained with green, and a kind smile on his face.
Dior hadn’t thought that blue could catch fire.
when there had been close to no rights for anyone that wasn’t an alpha. Castiel had tried to steer the conversation towards a less destructive topic, to no avail. They hadn’t outright disrespected his opinions - which would not have gone well for someone of his status - but neither have they acknowledged his undeniably perfect replies and facts.
Suddenly, he wasn’t excited about having true independence for the first time in his life anymore. He was suffocating with overwhelming homesickness, as if…
“No, It’s very pleasant in here,” Dior replies, demeanor softening, turning slightly to face Cas better.
The nameless alpha female is baring her fangs, refusing to let herself be calmed down by her beta companion. The beta smells sweaty - Dior understands.
They stopped in front of the French royals and kneeled in perfect sync.
“That is a lie.”
“No - absolutely not. I would never.”
The coachman takes his top hat off and gives his scalp a brief scratch, “Not a lot will be open at this time of the night, my Lord”. Castiel’s heart sinks. “Although I hear there is a new couturier - Caesar Cuevas - that arrived in Paris but a month ago. Been gossip that he’s eager to get exposure.”
His whole body screams, feeling as if there are heavy weights pinning him to his bed. His mind is sluggish, warm with what must be a fever, the tell-tale pounding ache not leaving his head. Why is his head so painful lately? He would really like a break.
To stay and never leave. To drown himself in gold and bronze and come up weightless. He wants to bury himself in-between bones, carve himself like a seal, grow roots and become a dandelion and a bee both - to heal, to balm, to give and give
Dior’s brain stutters at the last word and he flinches at a phantom pain. The omega suddenly feels much too vulnerable and scrutinised under their gazes. He is perfectly fine. Dior’s not sure what that intense pain was about but it’s gone now and there’s no need to dwell on it. Especially not at the risk of missing a day’s work and losing time with his clients. It would be disastrous for his earnings and he can’t- Dior
Yet, he can’t find it in himself to care. He turns on his heel and makes his way out of the room as Princess Margot yells after him “Castiel!”, but he does not turn around.
“How are you, Dr. Sunders?” he asks, starting to undo his dressing-gown, “You look as lovely as always,” he winks, still finding it harder to breathe than normal.
Everyone at the table is eerily quiet and Adrien sets the plates suspiciously soft in the sink. This doesn’t bode well.
“Cas - you can’t be serious,” Dior speaks up, fingers brushing the side of his sleeve to get his attention. “That isn’t how couturiers
Castiel squints at him, “You want me to gamble on whether one of my siblings is hiding a child being conceived out of wedlock or mating?”
There is nothing about this man being Castiel’s, and no matter how much his primal instincts are saying otherwise, he refuses to let any improper thoughts invade.
! But - yeah - okay, I’ll shut up now.” Dean groans into his hand, obviously flustered.
her away-
“I will write up the contract and receipt. Please bear with me,” he says before he retreats to the room him and Dior were in previously, taking his husband with him.
“I have no family,” he starts, easy as anything, not much different from how an actor would read from the script in rehearsals. “I was in a monastery orphanage until I was around fourteen - or fifteen. The nuns kicked me out because I refused to go to Sunday mass and pray every day. Though… it might have also been my stubbornness. And causing them problems daily.”
“Apologies for the wait,” he says instead, climbing into the carriage and closing the door quickly, not wishing to let too much cold air in.
Dean purses his lips and looks in the general direction of the trees, lost in thought. He turns back to Castiel once he seems to have come to a decision. “I think you might do best with a fir tree. They’re pretty classic and sturdy. The Fraser fir has good needle retention. D’you wanna head over and you can have a look?”
He takes a leap of faith and turns his whole body inwards, coming chest to chest with Cas, his thumbs immediately sliding down to his wrists, under his gloves and pressing, pressing,
She nods her head once, briskly and Dior notices that even though her shoulders are not shaking with her sobs anymore, she’s still shivering. A brief touch to her bare neck confirms what her hands had hinted at - she’s freezing. He slips into his bathrobe quickly and returns to the other omega’s side immediately.
He shivers and gives her a decisive nod when she raises an eyebrow in question.
I will ever have to offer, Your Highness.”
Castiel takes both of the omega’s slender wrists in one hand - horrified to see that his index and thumb are close to making a neat, uninterrupted circle around them. Had Dior always been so thin? Keeping hold of them gently in one palm, he uses his front teeth to bite down on the end of a gloved finger, swiftly taking it off and promptly sliding it on one beautiful hand. Again - the glove is big and loose around it.
It is easier to respond when he is no longer distracted by the smell of baking pies, “Would you like the truth or a lie?”
’ are and tells Dior as much, earning him a suspicious glare. He smiles at the display, “If I do not know what these ‘things’ are, does that mean I can keep doing them?
He will start throwing up the shattered pieces of his peace, of bile and toxic overflow of anguish.
“This is Caesar - my husband,” he introduces.
“How have you been, Castiel?” Dior asks him with genuine interest, scent back to normal.
And so, without wanting or meaning to, he whimpers and meowls in pain with every thrust or too-tight grope, client after client is spurred on, thinking they’re providing him with any sort of pleasure, thinking he’s exactly what they’re after - a needy whore.
is so wrong with that?”
“Now, I know you are not blind. A bit naive, yes. But most definitely not blind. If they hadn’t been wearing so much perfume, I’m pretty sure we could’ve smelled slick, my friend.”
Castiel had to raise his voice in order for Alfie to hear him all the way to his main doors. “Yes, please do come in! I was just about finished.”
. The sound of the suitcase opening. Dior closes his eyes and tries to morph his face with his blanket, hands fisting in the bedding.
“Is there a shorter way?” he asks.
To his delight, she smiles at him - his raised voice forgotten. He looks around the kitchen and comes to a startling realisation.
“You said a doctor came to see me?” Dior asks, unwilling to let the silence stretch any further. Cas’ piercing gaze isn't much help to his crumbling nerves. He kind of wants to hide in a ditch.
Being so close to Cas ignites Dior and he thinks he might be the one to combust next. All his nerves light up, goosebumps raising with every vocal roll of the possessive growl. His eyes slip closed when Cas buries his nose and mouth further into the crook of his neck, right between his scent and mating glands. The alpha never once averts his eyes from the intruders.
The moment they reached the bottom of the stairs, they were offered a drink from one of the waiters, and Castiel couldn’t help but notice a peculiar detail. “I can’t smell them,” he said and continued making their way further down the room.
Dior thanks her and slips to the kitchen where the cook and the rest of the staff have retreated to their own homes for the night, the only person remaining being Lisa, standing bent over a sink and scrubbing at crockery.
Both Cas and Jesse turn to look at Dior expectantly, but Dior only appears confused and throws a meaningful glance to Castiel. Understanding dawns on both the alpha and the beta. Jesse looks at Cas and Cas simply shakes his head once.
It was later, in the safety of his bedroom, that he came to the wonderful realisation that those instincts were not his, not completely. Castiel had wept with joy under his covers, ecstatic and dizzy with the reassuring, almost imperceptible purr resonating in his mind. For so long, there was nothing but the crushing reality that he was broken. Then, suddenly, he was
It was hard to enjoy one’s self when the company was nothing short of mortifying. Their speech was polite and formal, and yet their ideals and opinions were nothing if not ancient and repulsive. He had been under the impression the Great Powers had been united in a joint effort to evolve into more progressive societies, try to be more understanding towards the less fortunate and anything in between that was supposed to be
The two do not waste any time in making their way downstairs. Castiel lets Dior lead them, head swimming with joy, scent dancing with it. There is a distant, paltry thought at the back of his mind in regards to Dior’s attire, but he is too stricken with admiration to give it too much attention - or even remember what the thought was to begin with.
“That’s not true -
- a sigh of resignation finding permanent residence on his lips.
like the sun.
“Let me accompany you, Your Highness.” Uriel said and followed the Princess to the exit.
He thought he was doing all this because he cares about the man sitting across from him. He wants to pluck the stars from the weave of the sky and lay them before him. Only yearned to expose the sun-touched flesh of his heart to him.
