Dean reluctantly pulled away from Cas’s lips. “I’m kissing the love of my life, what’s it look like I’m doing?”
“I can be very good, Dean. I’ll show you just how good I can be...if you are good for me.” Castiel wrapped his hand around Dean and started to stroke him. Dean groaned with relief at the angel’s warm, firm grip. “I am the one who rescued you from the Pit,
Dean began to weep, holding Cas tighter.
“That’s not Uriel,” Cas growled, shielding Dean with his body. “You followed us from the bunker.”
The last thing he gave Castiel was a model car, of a 1967 Chevy Impala. “This is what Dean’s car looks like. It’s his pride and joy.”
“What, didn’t Billie fill you up enough when you ate her? Now you gotta come after Cas for dessert? Well, too bad.
“That’s more like it,” Dean said with a smirk. “I’m gonna blow you now.”
fun before dinner, then save the grand finale for after our bellies are full.” Dean waggled his eyebrows. “Whaddya say, sweetheart? You up for it?”
“I’m Castiel,” he said, taking the proffered hand. “And I’m...Dean’s soulmate.”
“Wait. Are you sure you don’t want to call Mom or something?” Sam asked.
“What is it?”
“Nah, all that was in there was some ratchets and socket wrenches, and maybe a few loose lugnuts. It’s all good.”
“Want...you...” Castiel gasped between kisses.
Sam nodded, and Cas handed over the pearl. Dean gave him a weak smile and then looked at the pearl. “...okay,” he said after a tense moment. “So, what do I—?”
There went the fingers again.
Gabriel’s stomach twisted guiltily. Having no wings, that was the one angel job Castiel could
“Of course you didn’t,” Dean chuckled tearfully. “How could you?...so tell me something, Cas.” And oh, there was
Cas smiled shyly, gesturing to the table. “Dinner. I thought it might be nice to eat together. As a family.”
“So you do
“I just can’t believe it,” Cas said. “I...I thought I was
“I’m telling you guys, I am
“If I had ingested
“Mmm, I might need one too,” Cas purred, looking suggestively at Dean’s crotch.
“Mind-altering...not that you had much competition,” Castiel said, offering a weak laugh.
Cas smiled back mischievously. “You know I do.”
to have started until I rescued you from Hell.” Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s.
“Hey,” Dean murmured, cupping Cas’s chin and coaxing him to look at him. “I ain’t laughing.”
“I...yes. I would die for you, Dean,” Cas answered solemnly.
Cas laughed gently. “It was. But in that moment, when you told me you loved me...”
Castiel covered his mouth. He felt ill.
As Castiel worked, people came in and out of the shop. One man, a burly older gentleman with a gruff voice, barged in to, as he put it, “take a leak” in the small bathroom connected to Dean’s office. He turned out to be Dean’s honorary uncle, Bobby Singer, the previous owner of the garage. He gave Castiel the stink-eye when he found out he was “the taxman”, but Dean quellingly pulled him out of the office so Castiel could work in peace. So Dean’s surrogate father hated him. Wonderful. Another point against Castiel.
Dean slowly opened him up with one finger, then two, then three. He stroked over Cas’s sweet spot and the tax auditor shivered. “Oh...th-there again, please.”
Dean was hard in his pajama pants. He fisted the bedsheet nervously. “Are we really...doin’ this?” he asked.
“Uh...no, actually. I smelled something kind of...zesty? Almost like...lemon.”
“No, dumbass, that the narrator isn’t pushing your actions;
Sam studied it and clicked his tongue. “Looks pretty identical, Dean.”
Castiel touched his featherless shoulder in shame and sighed softly.
“Well...I’m glad I finally wrote an ending you’ll actually like, then.”
“What do you mean by, ‘sort of?’” Castiel did air quotes.
“Sounds like the one for me,” said Castiel with a weak laugh.
Castiel needed to hurry if he wanted to get to work on time. In a panic, Castiel checked his watch and saw that he was indeed one minute and 14 seconds behind schedule. Castiel quickly rinsed his mouth out and hurried to his closet, neglecting to comb down his hair as he usually did directly after brushing his teeth.
“But you
Dean hugged him tightly. “You’re the realest thing I’ve ever known,” he whispered fiercely.
Castiel felt close to tears. (
Castiel stepped around Dean. “I haven’t forgotten our deal. You want to take me away, I’m ready.”
Cas surged forward and kissed him. Dean’s arms around his waist tightened to pull him in closer as their lips met over and over, desperately trying to make up for all the time they’d wasted keeping the same secret.
Cas nodded. “Every word. And...it’s beautiful. I loved it.”
Cas sighed, putting down his book. “You didn’t have to come and find me. I was going to come back to the Bunker eventually.”
Dean smiled back bashfully, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Anything yet?” Sam asked.
Dr. Bradbury jumped up, pacing excitedly. “Okay. I’m in. I’ll be your Yoda.”
Angels, like I said, are very efficient at their jobs. A single Christmas angel can assemble on average 500 Etch-N-Sketches a day, or 1100 Funko Pop figurines, or 300 pairs of roller skates (that’s 600 skates in total). But Castiel wasn’t an angel, so he was a little less productive than his winged coworkers.
“Relax, I’m just messin’ with ya,” Dr. Bradbury said, plopping down at her desk and throwing her checkered Converse up on the desk. “People are always surprised by my age. Truth is I’m older than I look, I just look young because I have incredible skin and I buy all my clothes from Hot Topic.”
Dean crossed his arms, grumbling softly and refusing to look either of them in the eye.
“What...what do you mean,
“I don’t think scars are ugly at all. How did you get these? Was there an accident of some kind?”
“Okay.” With a light hearted shrug, Jack left the room.
Dean took Cas deep and swallowed around him, his throat gently constricting and drawing a gasp out of him. Dean hummed contently with Cas deep inside him, the vibration only serving to drive Cas even wilder.
, Castirl thought glumly. “I, um...I’m sort of a beginner. And by beginner, I mean I’ve never so much as touched a guitar,” he admitted.
“Where the fuck did you get that?!” Dean squawked.
Dean sniffled, quickly wiped his eyes. “No, no! It’s just...no one’s sung that song to me since I was five years old.”
I had resigned myself to my fate—I thought it was a worthy death, if it meant saving you...I was ready.”
“That’s what I thought. I’m all for it when my taxes go to shit that will actually help the community, like better roads and schools, and hopefully someday universal healthcare. I did the math and figured that 73% of what the government was asking me for was more than fair, and that’s what I paid. Until shit changes, you and the rest of your government goons can take the rest of what I owe and shove it up your ass.”
“So a potion fell on Cas?” Jack said. “How did that happen?”
Cas raised an eyebrow at him. “How do
“Mmm, you feel nice and big, baby,” Dean growled against Cas’s neck. “Gonna make you feel so good.”
Castiel turned to Inias. “Inias...I believe I’m cracking up.”
when you’ve experienced your happiest moment. And you’re pretty damn happy in Green Eyes’s arms over there.”
Suddenly there was a buzz from Dean’s pocket between them. “Oh Jesus, Sam! I totally forgot about everything else!” Dean gasped, grabbing his phone. He touched the screen and brought it to his ear. “Sam, Billie’s been taken care of. We-...
Cas and Jack were already waiting by the Impala. “Cas, are you sure Jack should be coming? This nest sounds like no joke,” Sam fretted.
“My apologies,” said Castiel awkwardly. “Um, Sam said I could sleep here?”
cherry pie. If he made me, wouldn’t he know important stuff like that?”
“Thank you,” said Castiel, packing it in his bindle gently, alongside his toy soldier with the green eyes. He gave Gabriel a smile. “I’ll never forget you.”
But all Dean could muster in a weak voice was...
“Oh, I wouldn’t want to impose...”
who’s in charge here.”
“Well, I have good news.”
“What did you mean by
Amazingly, it
Dean obediently rubbed his prostate and Cas gasped, seeing stars. “Fuck! I’m ready, I’m ready for you, Dean...”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Jack’s the one who got injured, not me.”
This drew a laugh from the audience. Edlund grinned. “
Charlie sighed. “Look, you wanna live or not?”
He swirled his finger inside himself like he knew he liked and Cas sighed, dropping his head to press his forehead against Dean’s. Then Dean slid in further and brushed over his own prostate, and Cas gasped, keening, and Dean grinned.
“You sure got a thing for my freckles,” Dean chuckled.
” the talk show host was asking. “
“Where do you live?” Eileen asked.
Dean was stunned, at a loss for words. Something inside him was
Castiel was still standing on the front stoop in shock. His soulmate
“No, Dean. You’re going to fuck me.”
Castiel stood in front of the building for the College of Arts and Media on the campus of University of Kansas Lebanon. He took a deep breath and pushed inside.
He rounded the corner of the convenience store and ran into someone in black. “My apologies—
“Sam said the silver stakes were back here,” Dean grunted as he pawed through the various items on the wooden bookcase. They had received word of a large vampire nest a few towns over and Sam wanted to be extra prepared. Dean didn’t see why the old-fashioned wooden stakes wouldn’t suffice—if it was good enough for Buffy...

He wanted to say something smooth or romantic but he was totally tongue-tied. “But you left the oven on,” he blurted out.
on the front of her cardigan and the Gryffindor barrette in her hair
“I have lived for an eternity, have watched the first sunrise, the first butterfly unfurl its new wings for the first time, every nebula and galaxy in the cosmos, and they all pale in comparison to you, Dean. Your soul permeates your mortal flesh and reflects the beauty within. You truly are God’s greatest masterpiece.”
“I’m assuming you’re asking if I’m okay. Yes. I believe I’m done with the initial assessment.”
“No, but Cas got a huge dose of it. It soaked right into his skin.”
Dean thought for a second. “Nope. Don’t think so.”
Dean was staring at him, mouth slightly agape, totally speechless.
Dean laughed. “Nothing, babe, nothing at all. I just like to mix it up occasionally, you know?”
“Yep. I’m Dr. Mills, I’ve been overseeing your recovery. It was touch and go there for awhile, but you managed to pull through. We weren’t sure you were going to make it.”
“Yes, the woman who raised me. Your
“Are-are you busy?” Castiel gasped, sniffling.
Dean blushed, looking away.
“Castiel, that wasn’t your aunt,” Chuck said, tears streaming down his face. “...that was a
“Okay, you caught me, I read every single one! They’re garbage, but they’re my garbage.”
“It was worth it, Castiel. But nevertheless, I should’ve told you years ago about your origins. You have human family, a twin brother named James Novak, who’s a tax accountant, and he has a wife named Amelia and a daughter named Claire. And also...you have a soulmate.”
“Cas, this stuff could kill you for all we know! Don’t you get that?” Dean groused.
, for the love of God,
“You said you were my Yoda.”
Dean snorted derisively. “Isn’t that against the rules or something too? Gettin’ too familiar?”
knows that
All the animals too.”
Castiel shed his trenchcoat, then his suit jacket that Jimmy had lent him (“You’ll want to look sharp when you meet your soulmate!”), then finally unbuttoned his sleeve and rolled it up to show his mark.
Dean was groaning in earnest at Cas’s words and his hand slowly stroking his cock, twitching with pleasure at his touch. “Cas, I’m n-not gonna last long,” he panted.
“Chuck, I...can’t speak for those other instances, but as for me, I...if I have to die...it’s how I’d want to go. It’s...a good ending. It’s okay. I’ve accepted it.” Cas gently pushed the papers toward Chuck. “You have to finish it.”
Castiel felt his heart skip a beat and his entire body heated up—and it had nothing to do with his trenchcoat. He’d never known a sensation like this before. He’d never gazed into a face so beautiful as this man’s. Despite the hard, annoyed set of his jaw and eyebrows, his intense green eyes seemed to shine with a light that all that outward anger couldn’t dim. Looking into them was like getting hit in the face with a snowball; they left him out of breath.
him, angel body warmth all pressed up against him, arms entwined around him like they always were in the mornings.
...oh!
him,” Naomi muttered, giving Castiel a disdainful look.
”Dean, how does she know we’ve been to Purgatory?” Cas whispered as they were shooed out.
“We were adopted into separate homes, it’s unlikely he knows I exist. I didn’t know myself until a short time ago.” Castiel dug out his wallet with his new ID inside of it and showed it to her.

.” Sam laughed in amazement.
Dean laughed. “I see that now.”
“But seriously though, Cas, if you’d have done
Castiel heard a rustle of papers beside his ear and he tearfully turned to look. Chuck was holding the first page of his manuscript in front of Cas’s face. He was pointing to the very first line.
. “Oh, wow,” Cas said quietly in amazement. “You’re so turned on.”
Suddenly he came without warning, like a goddamn fifteen year old getting an over-the-pants job for the first time, hips bucking and Dean crying out and holy Toledo he hoped to high Heaven that there was no one in the nearby vicinity to hear his screams. Castiel refused to let up, stroking over that sweet spot and drawing out his climax into a ceaseless cadenza of pleasure. At some point Dean’s arms buckled and he collapsed onto his chest, panting. “Cas...please...” he moaned, almost a sob.
“I love you too.”
Cas held his hand out. “Dean. Come here, please.”
“Your toaster oven breaking the day after its warranty runs out is a coincidence. Being bequeathed a spooky old mansion by a distant relative is plot. A wrecking ball is...something else entirely.”
“He’s at the library,” a voice piped up. Dean and Sam turned to see Jack standing in the doorway. “It’s where he goes to take his mind off things.”
“Will we be filling our quota today?”
“He wants Anna to get her coat back, too,” Dean said, glancing back at the door. “He’d probably risk himself to save her.”
“What?” Cas asked, head snapping to Dean.
There is an arm wrapped around his waist and Castiel’s cheek is pressed flat to his back, quick puffs of breath ghosting across his skin.
“What comes next, Dean?” Castiel finally asks, his hands working up Dean’s polo.
Dean targeted Sarah next, cause she was too quiet and innocent for anyone’s good. She chose truth.
Castiel’s laugh this time was bitter. “That is the very definition of a Cupid, Dean,” he said. “But I believe humanity should have the right to choose.”
Dean dug into his eggs before speaking. “Relax Sam,” he said. “We spent almost the entire night watching Lord of the Rings.”
“Cas,” Dean whispered just a second before he closed the distance and pressed their lips together.
“You can die a thousand deaths.”
“For fuck’s sakes, guys, you live together. You can do that all the freaking time, as much as you want, and no one will care. Can you please try to keep mom’s house to a family appropriate level?”
Castiel raised an eyebrow.
from Lion King. Dean barely noticed. Castiel was pulling him tight, licking into his mouth, and the heat from earlier was rapidly returning.
“Inconceivable!” she cried. “Faster, Sam!”
“He’s a civilian, Sam!” Dean hissed back in a low breath, as if Cas couldn’t totally hear them anyway.
“I’ll call Charlie and get her on the ship’s manifest, try to find a connection between the victims. Beyond being rich and men. And I’ll send her a pic of the hair. She has more resources than us, maybe she can figure out something.” Dean let out a breath. “Going to cost a buttload with all the charges.”
Castiel crossed back over to the door and there, there was Dean. Dressed as Rocky Horror, the sexy, muscled god from the same movie Castiel’s character was from. The same character Castiel had specifically mentioned being his favorite just a few weeks ago.
“I got you,” Dean whispered, pressing a kiss just below his belly button. He worked his finger over Castiel's thighs, pushing up until the cloth began to bend around a sizable erection.
The ghost flickered back into sight and Dean raised his shotgun. He hesitated as Castiel began shouting next to him in a language that sounded familiar.
Castiel’s heart had been pounding in his ribcage for a while now. He knew, the second he was called, he was going to have to pick dare. After seeing Dean walk out of the bathroom with his jeans hung low enough on his hips that he could just make out the pink satin beneath, there was no way he could ever pick truth. There was too much he could reveal.
They broke for lunch at midday, but otherwise continued straight North without pause. Around mid-afternoon, they came to a clearing, the sun’s rays warmer without the canopy of the forest, and in the middle of the well-kept clearing sat one, large, gray tombstone.
Strange encounters with Becky Rosen were not enough to dampen Dean's spirits. He rode up the elevator, entered his apartment, and whistled some Led Zeppelin as he stripped off his clothes and headed for his one bedroom apartment's ugly green shower.
A hand fell gently on his shoulder. “The beast was always aiming for you, she just happened to be in between you and it.”
His charge was answered by a dive from an owl that Dean recognized immediately. Norbert pulled off one of the beasts while Dean plunged in.
Castiel would not be so lucky. He needed to die. Now.
After they’d presented their ID’s, Ava gave them each one of the smallest Dixie cups Dean had ever seen and started explaining their moonshine. Because the place had been so dead, she had time to kill and gave them the full explanation of each flavor. How they made it, what it would taste like, the best ways to drink it, and so forth. She also explained that normally in the evening they limited the samples to two or three flavors, but since they were cute –this time Ava winked at Cas- she’d let them sample all of them.
The hint of a smile grew. “And what if I'm meeting someone?”
Charlie rolled her eyes. “The term is bisexual, Dean.”
Ava squeaked. “Oh dear God, please leave before I do something that will cost me this job.”
Dad could never, ever know. He’d begrudgingly accepted Sam’s Thespian side. He would never accept both of them being theatre nuts.
“That’s not my name Dean,” Castiel growls as he pounds even harder, faster.
“I haven’t had that much fun in years, Cas,” Dean said.
Dean looked up with a start. Castiel was perched on an overturned plaster bucket not five feet away.
He looked away sharply.
As Sam was asking what was going on, Dean ignored him and threw his chair back. He walked as fast as he could across the dining hall without running and drawing attention, and he could feel Sam following behind him.
“Well it certainly was for me,” Castiel replied. “I had no intention of coming so soon in the evening.”
Dean did recall. He also assumed the knife back at Castiel’s camp was similarly treated.
“I think it suits him,” Castiel said.
Castiel's lips parted and his eyes traced the curve of Dean's.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, his face stern. “He probably interrupted him.”
“No!” He shouted it much too loudly and much too quickly, but there was nothing he could do to change that now. “It’s perfect. I’ll get a tie, it’ll be fine.”
“True love! He said true love, clear as day,” Charlie said, continuing to lovingly—Kevin hoped—hit her partner. “You're just scared.”
He hummed in response, watching Dean intently.
“Nothing,” Castiel replied. “They invited me to a costume party, that’s all.”
“We should get back to the party,” he said. He watched Dean lick his lips. Did he look disappointed?
He fully intended to leave by sun up. Sneak out, leave Castiel sleeping peacefully in bed, no awkward goodbyes. But when the time came, he found he couldn’t untangle himself from Castiel’s limbs.  And when Castiel awoke and slid down to suck his brains out through his dick, he couldn’t say it was a bad decision.
“She was nice,” Cas said, as they walked away. “Much more friendly than my own mother.”
“You ready to leave now?” he asked with a steady voice.
“Aw, fuck!” Dean cursed. He thrust up and Castiel coughed a little, backing off. “Sorry, sorry.”
They were content for a while, Castiel's fingers idly brushing across Dean's back as their heart rates calmed. It was Castiel who broke the silence.
It was dark and he couldn't breathe and the sand worked into every hole he had with quick efficiency. He was going to have to be very fast if he was to save Dean. And himself.
Sam nodded in agreement.
“Few days, at most,” Sam answered. “How far away are we?”
Sam’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, but at least he didn’t look shocked or horrified. “Oh, wow. When did that happen?”
“Take a seat,” Castiel ordered. “Dean, I assume you have something to secure him with?”
“Shit!” Dean cursed loudly as one of the damned winged beasts dived for his head. At least he assumed it was a beast. The sun was down and the rain was blocking moonlight and starlight, obscuring his vision.
Castiel quirked an eyebrow. Which, with his head held in a grip, looked ironic. “Marvin Gaye?”
“Darling,” Crowley crooned. “You look a mess.”
Dean wiggled his hips twice before cautiously picking himself up and sinking back down.
“Does...” Castiel began. “Does this make things weird?”
Dean stared at his phone for a moment before looking up to Sam, who was waiting patiently. “Cas says Daniel Ogle may be next. Like, tonight, next.”
The moon was high overhead, shining light onto them. It was both peaceful and eerie. Here they were, standing in the middle of the woods on a gorgeous night, nature going on as it always would, and it was all oblivious to the life shaking revelations of the last 12 hours.
here?”
“I have a quest for us,” Dean started.
“Sure,” he says with a squeak, standing up and stepping back. It’s not like Castiel is going to remember he ever said any of this. “Yeah, okay. Uh. Glad you’re feeling better. I’m just going to… go.”
That had shut Sam up. He threw his hands in the air and walked away muttering how Dean was damn lucky Sam was happy for him and that he should be grateful and not a heathen, and a whole bunch of things Dean didn’t catch.
“S’okay,” Dean rasps out. He stands up, wobbly legs barely working. He’s about ready to collapse into the chair behind him when a hand grips his erection tight.
“Castiel Milton.”
“You’re going to have to explain that one at some point.”
“Yes sir, it’s nice to meet you Mr. Winchester,” Castiel said, offering his hand.
Dean blinked. “That’s all kinds of hot,” Dean told him.
Dean sat up so he could look at Castiel more closely and meet his gaze. There was hardly any light in the room, but Castiel’s dark blue eyes still seemed to shine somehow. He wanted to do something huge and meaningful. He settled instead for squeezing Castiel’s folded hands, mumbling, “Good for you,” and laying back down.
As a few fingers pound in and out with a rhythm Cas had yet to give Dean, he hears a zipper being undone. Suddenly Cas is gone. Completely gone, and Dean whimpers hard.
Castiel, Dean’s roommate, friend, and object of his continued sexual frustration, shuffled into their shared living room with a horrible case of bed head. He scratched at his tummy, just above his PJ’s waistband, and Dean got a glimpse of hip bone and toned tummy. He tamped down on the urge to get up, go over, and lick it.
He was disgusting. A ruthless, brutal, violent killing machine, and there was no way he ever deserved a moment of Castiel’s time.
The brightness was so intense that even with an arm thrown over his eyes and his lids shut tight, it hurt. It only lasted a second, but Dean would be seeing spots for days.
Castiel parked and, when Dean didn’t follow him to the door, cocked his head to the side. Before he could approach, Dean scrambled for his cell phone, and quickly called home. He held a finger up, indicating that Cas should wait. It rang twice and a gruff voice answered.
Castiel sucked in a deep breath. “Are you sure? You kinda froze on me there.”
He stepped out of the stables looking a mess. His hair was tousled and knotted with bits of hay, his hands were dirty, his clothes covered in stains from working with animals on a constant basis. The young man on the verge of adulthood looked how he always looked, but as the Duchess's eye combed over his frame, a funny feeling settled in Dean's stomach.
The day was no less hot than the previous and Dean was silently grateful Sam had squashed the idea of fed-ing up to talk to the cops.  A suit would have made the humidity nearly unbearable. He cranked his environment killing AC as the Impala rumbled to the closest victim’s house.  It was a little cottage off of the main drag, and once again, Dean was reminded that maybe his Baby wasn’t the best choice of vehicle for the mountains.
“I will.”
more exciting than the reputation.
. The ghost was barely keeping up with him. Only the supernatural could run as fast as, well, the supernatural.
Heaven's Gate
At least until the man smiled at him.
“What’s with this Ogle guy?” Dean asked.
“Ah,” Dean said, though he still looked more than a little confused.
This Friday, thankfully, they were in the choir room.
“I still can’t believe how beautiful this place is,” Castiel said as they walked in. The place was empty. Their show had also ended two hours ago, and much to Dean’s delight, there was still a couch on stage. It was set for a living room.
“Um. Hi. I’m Castiel.”
“I have no idea what I’m supposed to do next,” Castiel went on. “Where I’m supposed to go, what I’m supposed to do. I’m not even sure heaven wants me back, if it’s true, what Omiel said about-“
“Hmm.”
He walked towards the party, a smile beginning on his lips, faltering just as quickly. “What happened?”
“Fuck you, Dean,” Castiel spat. “Don’t make this about me. I’m not making you anything.”
But as the source of years of frustration and anguish stood gloating above him, Kevin simply decided that today was not that day. At least, not until he finished what he had come here to do. And so, with shaky legs and a great deal of pain, he made to stand.
“And what a uniform,” the guy continues, completely ignoring Dean. “God, look at you. Do you have any idea how incredibly hot you are in that?”
He looked to Cas, who was swiping a finger along the top of the dresser.
“Good boy.”
Dean left feeling as if he'd been manipulated, and was wholly dissatisfied with the whole thing. But with so many guards following him, all he could do was wait. Well. Wait and plot and plan, maybe. There had to be other ways out of this.
Sure enough, Kevin was frowning. “Dean, I was having a good night. This hardly sounds like our kind of case.”
“What? No,” Dean said. He took a twitchy step back from Castiel. “I like
“We didn’t find a body today.”
Castiel made a sound in his throat that sounded something like a growl and slid closer. His lips attached themselves to Dean’s neck and it was Dean’s turn to let out a primal sound.
Dean saw a deer at the side of the road and let it cross the street. As Dean watched the young doe scamper into the woods, his thoughts turned to the other possibility. Maybe Castiel had meant it would have unleashed a part of him that he resisted every day.
Dean had never understood how people were able to get up at the ass crack of dawn, rising with the sun. But Castiel was clearly one of those people and it was time to head back to town.
He buried himself as far into Dean as he could and wrapped his arms around Dean’s torso. With impressive dexterity and grace, he rocked backward and Dean went with him, adjusting limbs, until Castiel was on his back and Dean was kneeling over him. They never broke contact.
“Does he hear himself?” Kevin whispered to Castiel.
Dean leaned over. “People using the quarantine as an excuse to confess their crush to their best friends?”
Dean snorted. “Depends on how many beers he’s had.”
The small group stared. Pamela actually rolled her eyes at him. “Very informative. Look kiddo, let me give you some advice. This group is going to be your family for the next month. We all know each other. Now I don’t know why I haven’t seen you before or where you’ve been hiding, but your next month will be a lot more fun if we knew more than your name.”
Dean, most fortunately, was also smart and quick witted, and once he caught on to the fact that he was being rescued, moved his arms through the grit and around Castiel's waist. This gave Castiel two free hands to work at the vine and pull them both out of the pit.
“Saturday at 8.”
“You under charge, dear boy,” he said as he turned for the door. “I know it’s made you popular with the locals, but you need to eat.”
“I can take it.”
important.
No, Dean spent his days as unconcerned as a boy should be. He was busy playing in the fields, helping with the farm, and barking orders to their stable boy.
The other man shook his head, as if shaking off the daze, and stepped forward. “I apologize,” he said, his voice just as low as before.
“You just surprised me,” Castiel said.
For once, Cas was the one rendered speechless. After dropping that not-even-remotely-subtle hint, Dean headed straight back out to the dance floor, moving his ass as much as humanly possible. Castiel followed him, but it was at a pause.
“This is fucking hot,” Charlie mumbled with a smirk.
The kitchen was blessedly dark and empty. Dean let their hands slide apart as he opened the fridge for a beer. He offered one to Cas, who shook his head.
Dean was sprawled in the seats, watching the cast make asses of themselves. Castiel looked for Dean and was surprised to find him already looking back. When he met Dean’s gaze, he blushed and looked away sharply.
Castiel had dark hair and was quiet and serious. He did his work and earned his keep with a sort of stoicism that Dean lacked completely. He didn't quite get Dean's jokes and was often spotted shaking his head at Dean's antics. Dean didn't quite understand him, and so, as a child on the verge of taking over the homestead, Dean took it upon himself to tell Castiel what to do.
“That was futile,” the boss lady said. “I suppose you think you're brave.”
Only he wasn’t just marble. He had life. He had a heart. He’d taken care of Cas when he was still a nearly complete stranger, and he’d stepped up to help without him even needing to ask. Thanks to Dean Winchester, Castiel was going to be on stage in one week, living a dream he never thought he’d be able to see through.
“I'm working on it,” Dean replied, rubbing the pre-come down his own cock, mixing it with his own. It was more slick than spit alone.
Sam took a swig of his coffee before carefully putting the coffee down. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad you’re exploring-“
“He's been like that since the swamps,” Crowley had said to his right-hand man Metatron at dinner one night. He likely did not know Dean could still hear him from where he was slinking away. “It's my mother's failing health that troubles him.”
Castiel laughed. “Nope. We’re all good there.”
“You little piece of shit,” Dean grumbled at him. He held up his arm, fighting the attacks off as best he could while his other arm scrambled for anything he could use as a weapon. His hand wrapped around a rock, this one heavier than the first, and he raised it sharply, aiming for the demon’s head. At least, he hoped he was aiming for the head. Though the excitement had taken the edge off, the world was still spinning slightly. Fortunately, with a crack, the rock made contact.
Crowley scoffed. “Who gives a toss about the loser. The prince is what matters. We must retrieve Dean from what is clearly the work of Guilder.”
Castiel gave him a level look, not impressed. Dean wasn't the type you could threaten in to anything.
“La Vie Boheme. But that would put you doing most of the cast’s parts. It’s a huge number.”
But then again, he didn’t want them to ever truly know what it was like anyway.
Dean flips himself over and rips his cheeks open so fast, the room spins.
“Cas,” Dean said, sitting up, “Why on Earth would I have a problem with that?”
Sam sighed from in front of them. He was silhouetted in the trees, the sun getting low in the sky. They’d have to stop for the night soon. “It
“I’ve spent the night with a lot of strangers while working a case,” he said. Which didn’t make him sound all that great, but still, the point remained.
“What happened?” Sam asked. “What did you do to Cas?”
“It's not remotely little.”
“You’re a wizard,” Dean said in awe. The relief was more than welcome.
Dean had just started to sip his martini, and even if it hadn't tasted like ass, he would have sputtered at the question.
“If you had said dare, and I had dared you to kiss me, would you have done so?” Castiel asked.
The feeling of lips wrapping around his cock and sucking hard pulled Dean out of his worship around Castiel’s own length. He pulled off with a shout. Castiel’s hands urged him to thrust faster, thrust deeper, into his mouth, so he stopped holding back. He raised himself back up onto his hands for better leverage and pushed his cock deep into Castiel’s throat.
Dean thrashed, helplessly aroused, and, with his hands pinned, utterly powerless to do anything about it. Which only added to the arousal.
“Yeah, good idea,” Dean agreed.
Dean remained more alert on the trek down the mountain. It wasn’t needed, they made it back to the Impala without further incident, but Dean was still on guard. What were the odds that the tree that fell, one amongst millions, would crash right on top of Dean?
“You've been mostly dead all day,” Sam explained, like his words made sense.
There, Castiel paused, staring down at Dean’s form, panting hard. His eyes strayed to Dean’s handprint.
Castiel’s apartment complex was simple, and like most things in the small area, a little outdated, but fully functional. The hallway smelled a little musty, like carpet that had been in the humidity for too long, and the elevator’s air was a bit stale, but it didn’t smell of cat pee and the elevator moved fairly quickly to the top floor. Overall, Dean liked it. It wasn’t pretentious.
The tavern was mostly empty, it being too early in the day for many people to be drinking or relaxing. Everyone was working, except, Dean noted, an elderly man at a table, and his own father, passed out over a tankard in the corner.
“Please, Dean. I’m feeling silly and vulnerable. Humor me. What are you afraid of? Dying? Ghosts?”
Castiel hummed contentedly before shifting in Dean’s arms to stare up at him. “Those attitudes reflect how human I am,” Castiel told him, like it wasn’t a big deal. “And how human I am is tied directly to my love for you. The closer we become to each other, the more I fall. I was nearly fully human when we first parted and it took a long time for that to change.”
Castiel smiled back, pleased with the answer. He gave Dean another quick peck before getting up and moving to the bedside table. He blew out the only lamp, bathing them in nothing but the moonlight. Carefully, he removed the top of the lamp and poured some oil into his hand, returning to his position between Dean’s legs.
“Uh,” Dean finally said, “You’re not taking me into a crypt or something, are you?”
“You'll have to forgive him,” Sam explained with his charming smile, patting Dean on the back as his eyes began to stream. The beer had gone down the wrong windpipe. “We're just brothers.”
“Hello,” Kevin called down to the man, “Slow going?”
“Sleep, Dean,” Castiel said, stroking the back of his hand back and forth gently on Dean’s skin. “We will find him. Sooner or later he will pause too long and we will catch up with him. Until then, you still need sleep.”
“Cas,” Dean said, sitting forward and nudging his knee. “Breathe. I don’t care.”
The news article lay in the same spot on his bureau as it had the day Dean first read it two weeks earlier. He'd barely moved since then, staring at the ceiling for hours on end, unable to move past the words it contained.
Dean’s body was on fire, he couldn’t wait any more. He moved a hand from Castiel legs to his cock and began to pump himself.
“I promise not to kill you until you reach the top?” Kevin said, making it sound like a question. Unsurprisingly, the Man in Black did not agree.
Going down on a man was something Dean had never done before, but he learned quickly he loved the heat of Castiel’s cock in his mouth, the silky slide of the rigid flesh. Experimentally, as Castiel became fully erect and his foreskin fully retracted, Dean tongued at the slit. Castiel moaned and thrashed, pushing at Dean’s shoulder to pull him off.
“Oh, and hey! This is Victor, Benny’s roommate.” Dean said, completely oblivious to Cas’ inner monologue. “Man, we’re gonna have so much fun!”
Dean decided that as parties go, this one definitely was weird. It was affecting him strangely, too. Did he just flirt with this guy? What happened to being straight?
With every swipe of his tongue, Dean moves deeper and deeper into the center of Cas’ being. These past few minutes have convinced him that there’s nowhere he’d rather be than right here. Right here, making good on a promise long overdue.
Dean licked the top hem of Cas’ boxers where they met skin. He tentatively put two fingers inside the waistband, asking for permission.
“Oh come on, Cassie. You only come to these parties to hook up, but as soon as the mission’s accomplished, you disappear from my life. Am I that horrible to be around?”
It isn’t long before Cas is fully hard, thanks to Dean’s unrelenting assault of moving against his ass. Cas loves how rough to the touch Dean’s hand is, made that way from all the work he’s done on cars over the years. With every new stroke, Dean’s hand lights up a different nerve ending on Cas’ cock. His own breath shaky, Cas rocks back against Dean. A few more strokes and Cas is gasping his release, come dripping down both of their hands. Suddenly, Dean freezes behind him, apparently fully awake now.
He sent it to his best friend Jo, who replied
“You’ll like most of the guys. Gabe can be a bit much, but he’ll grow on you.”
Dean honestly hadn’t gotten that far. He just came in to pee, dammit! He still had his dick hanging out of his pants, for God’s sake.
“Huh? Where are we? What time is it?”
Okay, apparently that wasn’t what he was supposed to say, because Cas’ scowl was back and he looked angry. Sexy just turned scary, and Dean couldn’t help but think he liked that even better.
It was at that moment that Cas chose to lean close to the cashier and stage-whisper in her ear, “I happen to know for a fact that he isn’t wearing
Cas fumbles for the bottle of lube, thrusting it into Dean’s hand. “Remember to warm it up between your fingers first,” he manages to say.
Dean hated how much he loved this – the thrill of being caught, how his dick reacted so quickly to orders given, the eventual angry sex and enemies-to-lovers aspect that he had only seen in movies… it created one hell of a build-up for a bomb waiting to go off inside him.
Dean typed back:
For a long while, Dean was mesmerized by Cas’ cock slipping in and out of his hole. It looked almost as if Cas’ hole was pulling it back in, asking for more, more, more. Pulling and clenching and opening beautifully for Dean. Yes, beautifully. It wasn’t a word Dean used often, because it was a bit too flowery for him. Only women were called beautiful, and yet… here? In this moment? With a slight sheen of sweat on Cas’ back, him meeting Dean thrust for thrust and breathing shakily, trying to maintain as much eye contact as possible despite closing his eyes during an especially good grind that made him see stars? Yeah, Cas was beautiful.
kind of fun he should have, though…
“Let go of me, Cas. You don’t get to touch me anymore. You’re getting married…or have you forgotten?” he sneered. Dean went towards the bar and chatted up their waitress, who had breasts as big as his face.
“What do you know about being kind? You didn’t even –“
Dean was hopelessly falling in love with this nerd who showers with his pet bird, and sings off-key in the car, and trips over his own shoelaces (Dean bought him an elastic pair and Velcro ones after that fiasco happening too many times), and reuses dildos, and told Dean’s niece a bedtime story over the phone because Dean was babysitting one night and was at his wit’s end (no one knows that Dean almost fell asleep that night, too).
“That would be Cygnus, also known as the Northern Cross.”
“That map won’t tell you anything useful. Plus, wouldn’t you like a specially-curated tour from yours truly?”
“Sounds like something stupid we would do.”
“Michael Novak. Why, you know him?”
Immediately, she hurried off and was lost in the crowd before Dean could blink. He wasn’t sure what just happened, but that raised eyebrow was doing things to him.
I did grow up eventually, and I learned why she hated guns. I spent most of my life trying to save things that were already dead. I both started and stopped wars, and many people died along the way.
“No. I mean, what’s going to happen to you and me? What if we don’t get placed in the same dorm? What if we have opposite schedules? What if…” he trailed off. “What if you find new friends to hang out with?”
“Yes, please. More, Dean” he gasps, holding Dean’s head firmly in place as he continues his assault on Cas’ chest.
“Right? I saw this girl come out of the dining hall earlier and... whew!” Benny whistled low. “Legs for miles, soft curves, and hair long enough to really grab hold of. I wanted to sink my teeth into her right there! There’s nothing better than the warm wet heat of a willing female.”
--------------
“I guess I’ll just… wait here then,” he muttered to an empty room.
“Cas, you’re a genius! You always were the smartest in the group.” Dean grabbed Cas’ cheek and kissed him.
There was one guy in the corner that looked to be around Dean’s age. His tie hung loose around his neck and his hair was mussed up as if he had been pulling at it all day in frustration at his desk job. The guy stood out like a sore thumb, and his resting bitch face made it seem like he didn’t even want to be there. But need and want were two different things, and maybe the man came here needing an escape from reality. Perhaps he wasn’t all that different from the other clubgoers after all.
Dean pulls out of Cas entirely and looks him straight in the eye. “I might not be an expert on gay sex but that is probably not the intended reaction.”
“Dean.”
Dean opens and closes his mouth several times before asking: “Did you happen to plan this?”
“Sure, Dean. Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
Dean finished up and washed his hands before turning around to face him.
“Are you sure he’s not gay? Or the rest of the football team, for that matter? All your tips come from them.”
“You’re going down, Dean.” There’s a glint in Cas’ eye, and yes, this is what Dean wanted. He wanted Cas to get excited by something. They had both been working so hard this semester that it sometimes seemed like they were roommates-with-benefits, instead of actual friends or significant others. Dean couldn’t remember the last time they did something that wasn’t scheduled three weeks in advance, only to be canceled at the last minute.
Dean smiled at his new friend’s enthusiasm. He met Benny only a few days ago at the Student Life and Activities Fair. Both he and Benny were here at KU on a football scholarship – Benny from Louisiana and Dean from good ol’ Texas.
Apparently, Cas had zoned out for a minute because he was suddenly in front of two strangers.
Castiel ripped off his shirt and collapsed on the bed.
“It feels weird.”
At least the guy was enjoying himself. Dean heard muffled grunts every so often, and the man held tight to Dean’s shoulder, enough for Dean to feel the heat of him searing through the fabric. However, he could also tell that the man was holding back, which could only mean that he wasn’t planning on coming down Dean’s throat any time soon. Dean gave a few more sucks before popping off and standing up.
- - -
“There’s nothing wrong with you. We just have to try something different, that’s all.”
“I’m close, Dean” Cas grounds out.
“Hey Dean?”
Cas was about to say “all of them are interesting, Dean,” but held back. He knew that not everyone shared his obsession.
“I’m telling you man, the top three things in life are beer, babes, and bacon. If I get two out of the three tonight, I’ll be happy.”
“I am, too. Why can’t we have fun together? I’ll go easy on him.”
Dean wrapped his hand around both of their cocks and started stroking. God, the friction felt amazing! He almost forgot what it felt like to touch another man’s penis, it had been that long.
“Go lay down in the back. I’ll drive us home and wake you up later.”
“What, the pet store doesn’t sell bird perches anymore? You had to sink low enough – no pun intended – and visit a sex shop? Or did you already have this just lying around?” Dean prayed it was the former option and not the latter, because that would be gross.
It wasn’t until they made eye contact that they burst out in laughter. “You bet your sweet ass I am. Now go! I have to get ready,” Dean said, shoving his new friend towards the parking lot.
“Well, I lost my shoe. Maybe we could help each other?”
“Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
“Anyone would be lucky to have you, okay? Boy or girl. You’re a catch, Cas. I’ve known it all my life, and now it’s time for the rest of the world to see how awesome you are. These are just pre-college nerves you’re experiencing right now. Everybody has them at some point.”
“Oh, you’d like it to be!”
“Would you mind if I left you alone for a minute and take a look?”
“I’m sorry, what was that?”
He chose to walk the short block to his friend’s house instead of driving, because it gave his body something else to do besides getting hard for his best friend. Dean tried to explain the physiological response as naturally caused by teenage hormones, but this was Cas – his best friend who was a dude. A dude who was very much gay and currently asking a seemingly straight Dean to… what? Touch his cock? His asshole? Make him come?
Dean caresses Cas’ cheek, brushing a stray hair out of his face. He sees nothing but trust and pure love reflected in Cas’ eyes.
A symphony of sounds drowns out any silence that previously existed. Dean stays inside of Cas for possibly too long, but neither one wanted to let go. They’ve done enough of that tonight.
Taking a risk, Dean cleared his throat and said: “Next time.”
Dean lifts his head to say: “I wish you could see how beautiful you are right now,” before continuing his ministrations.
“Not in the slightest. I won the water-balloon fight, and that means I get to choose your punishment. I’ve been hot and tired all day. The only thing I’ve wanted since I woke up this morning was to sleep in peace. With the air conditioner inside and you outside, all my current problems will be solved.”
“Ladies, and…
Perhaps miracles do exist. They seem to anyway, when Dean was in his friend’s presence. It’s how he earned the nickname ‘angel.’ Tonight was no different.
“Of course I did! I’m always thinking of you.”
“However –“ Dean talked over Cas’ whines. “– that won’t happen today.”
“How was that?” he tentatively asks, thinking he knows the answer.
Dean scoffed. “What? No, bitch. You’re just jealous that you don’t look this hot.”
“No, assbutt. I’m hot because of the sun, not because of you.”
Catching up, Castiel asked, “This is your car? She’s a beauty.” He ran his fingers over the fender in admiration.
, he thought.
“You really believe in ghost stories?”
Cas nods his head and Dean tentatively rubs the pad of his thumb over the rim, loving how it stretches. On one swirl, though, his finger catches, causing Cas to gasp and arch his back. Dean takes this as a good sign and drizzles lube on his thumb before properly inching in again.
“Fine. I’ll just wait here then.”
“I hope I will be. We’ll hear at the end of the week.”
eyebrow, as Dean called it now – and said: “Don’t challenge my authority, Winchester. Who’s attended school here longer, you or me?”
“First time?”
“I like you, Dean. That proposal was meant for you. Sam was just helping me practice it because I was nervous.”
For better or worse, Dean had inevitably rubbed off on Cas. He ended up learning how to drive (but hating it), and he actually did use swear words every so often – which Dean got a secret thrill out of every time it happened.
“Oh, I have my eye on a few.” Cas scanned the room, finding the boy from earlier. His brother tracked the movement and hummed in agreement.
“Thanks. I’m a bit out of my element here.”
– near dying here, Cas. Seeing you do that to yourself… might just do me in.”
The words “I don't wake up this pretty, Cas" float around Cas’ mind. They’re a total lie because it's Dean, of course he's that pretty, even while he's sleeping (not that Cas has ever watched him sleep, oh no).
Dean laughed, which probably wasn’t the best choice of reaction because Cas was now definitely scowling at him.
- - -
Dean tightens his grip on the arm wrapping around Cas’ stomach, the other continuing its exploration of his chest. Dean starts to work Cas up again, rolling a nipple between two fingers, moving down to rub his thigh. Dean strokes Cas a couple times before he says, “Isn’t this better? I can touch you freely and you can feel me against the entire length of you.”
Dean jogged ahead to the parking lot, needing some fresh air.
“You look like him. You wear sandals and have long hair and a beard. My daddy has a beard but he’s not Jesus.”
“What?” comes Dean’s ever-so-eloquent reply.
And with that, Cas sealed his promise with a kiss.
“Like this,” Dean answers suddenly as he pushes Cas back down on the hood, moving over him and claiming his lips possessively. Cas’ mouth is like a drug to Dean. He can’t get enough, and has no intention to stop tasting, licking, sucking, biting – especially when Cas seems to be just as affected (and addicted) as Dean.
In Dean’s mind, everything before could be described as just ‘bros helping bros.’ But as Cas surged up to claim Dean’s lips, that all changed. Cas plundered Dean’s mouth, taking everything Dean offered and more. Dean tasted Cas on his tongue, and went hurtling head- (or cock-) first towards near-certain death of who he thought he once was, and who he never would be again.
“Then
Castiel paused as her shadow fell over him, his fist wrist-deep in puppy guts. “Hello, Naomi,” he said nervously.
Castiel began to bounce gently on his lap. “The way you just take me, Dean, like your little hole is hungry for it, so desperate to filled. But only by me, of course. No one could satisfy you like I do.”

Charlie rolled her eyes. “Dude. What kind of mentor would I be if I let you just throw away true love? Besides, you owe Dean the full story.”
“Dude, no!” Dean gasped.
Still half crying, Castiel dialed another number. “Hello?” Charlie said when she picked up.
“God,
“I finished all my documentation last night, Dean. Because unlike you, I don’t procrastinate.”
“Uh oh? What do you
Dean blushed for the nth time that night. “Just let us work, Cas,” he mumbled.
, Dean thought to himself with an inward chuckle. His questing fingers strayed along the angel’s jaw, into Cas’s dark hair...
Castiel Novak had never been particularly religious. He did, of course, ponder over what happened after humans shuffled off their mortal coil, like everyone did. He obviously had heard the old adage about seeing a white light at the end of a long tunnel...and as he slowly opened his eyes, that’s exactly what he saw.
Dean harrumphed softly, then licked the pad of his thumb, glaring at Castiel. He took a hold of his wrist and ran his spit-moistened thumb down his arm, sweeping over the mark.
“It’s...well, there’s a guy named Nathan, and he goes camping in the woods...”
. I am a Seraph, the captain of a whole legion of angels. You will show me the respect I deserve.”
“Want this inside me,” Dean said huskily. “Wanna feel you fill me up, Cas.”
Dean wasn’t sure what threw him more, the blatant innuendo, or the heartfelt cheesy crap. It was like dating a very horny Hallmark card.
It’s worth noting that North Pole hot chocolate is
“Yeah, Sammy. Deal with it.” Dean didn’t see the big deal. Why had he stopped himself from flirting with Cas before? It just made sense.
The door swung open, opened by a girl with blonde hair and heavy eyeliner. “What’s the matter, Dad, you lost your key?” she snorted.
As Castiel rolled the mop bucket back toward the hot chocolate station, he heard Michael and Naomi’s voices and hid around the corner. If his bosses were going to talk about him, he’d like to know
“Am I...in the hospital?” Cas asked.
“I am not lying to you, Dean,” Castiel said angrily.
“Dean, I...” Castiel closed his eyes, leaning his forehead against the other man’s. “Take me to bed, please.”
“In the book!” Cas clarified. “You said,
“Jesus H. Christ, Cas,” Dean gasped, covering his mouth. “Where do you learn that kind of language?”
“Perish the thought, dear. Nothing like that.” Rowena giggled, wrinkling her nose. “But Dean still has to deal with

The Empty twisted Uriel’s face into a look of rage. “Fine.
“Right there,” Dean whispered. “Y-yeah, like that. Fuck, that feels nice.”
“Believe me,
Castiel heard Dean yell from upstairs.

”Damn, they’re really good for teenagers!” Dean shouted over the music and the cheering audience, which was small yet vocal, and nodded his head along. “How’d you discover these guys?”
“Aren’t you a little tall to be an elf?” Dean laughed, sitting down across from Castiel and propping his hands behind his head.
Cas reached Dean’s other hand down to cradle his balls, rolling and squeezing them gently, only heightening Dean’s pleasure.
“It’s 4:05,” someone replied.
What was he
“No. I won’t let you!” Cas exclaimed.

Cas averted his gaze again and closed his eyes. “Then I assume you’ve jumped to the obvious conclusion.”
Lazarus?” He looked at his clipboard, his face turning pale. “Uh oh.”
Raphael raised an eyebrow at him.
Dean, just admit it! You finally found your soulmate,” said Sam triumphantly.
“Shut up, Samantha. Keep reading,” Dean snapped.
of love potion it was,” Sam said. “It might need an antidote, or it might go away on its own. Let me see if there’s any more up here.” The jolly flannel giant grabbed a chair and climbed on it to look at the very top shelf.
“Are...are you sure that’s where you think I belong?” Castiel said, heart sinking. The
Dean’s heart swelled at that, and he kissed the angel again. And again. And again.
words we can find to use instead?”
Dean took a few deep breaths and climbed back into his seat. “Y’know what I think, Cas? I think you were raised by some sort of fringe religious cult in Canada that worships Santa Claus and somehow they let you escape the commune.”
Castiel would’ve made the Deal under any terms. To save Jack, no price would’ve been too high.
Suddenly behind Dean, the wall erupted in a geyser of black goo. At the same time, Billie burst through the door, scythe clenched in her hands.
A cold pit was forming in Dean’s stomach, the sharp cut snapping him back to reality. He looked at the remains of the broken bottle lying behind Cas on the floor, remembering how the mystery liquid inside it had been soaked up by Cas’s skin, like a sponge. Dean stared into Cas’s dilated blue eyes and groaned, this time in distress.
“Seriously, even
Castiel thought for a second. “...no,” he finally replied.
So that afternoon, Gabriel told the human about his birth parents’ tragic death, him being left alone in the orphanage, and about how Gabriel had decided to raise him here in the North Pole. “You mean you gave up a position as a guardian for me?” Castiel said, eyes widening.
Dean smiled, lying back on his pillows. “Yeah? Care to elaborate, sweetheart?” He was glad Miracle had decided to sleep in Sam’s room tonight.
They’re screaming and jumping around the kitchen XDDDDDDD
“I would love to do that,” Castiel said wistfully as they sipped their post-dinner eggnog on the couch. “But unfortunately I am on a mission. I’ve recently discovered that my soulmate resides in Lebanon, Kansas, and I’m going to meet him.”
“I thought angels were supposed to be

preferred Dean Winchester’s brand of pillow talk. Almost as much as he loved being cuddled in the mechanic’s strong arms.
It was easier to convince James (“please, call me Jimmy”) of Castiel’s identity than Amelia and Claire. Jimmy seemed to trust Castiel immediately, and was thrilled with the idea of having a brother. “We may have separated at infancy, but the Lord brought us back together,” said Jimmy tearfully, after hugging Castiel tightly. “Please, say you’ll spend the holidays with us.”
“Loverboy’s fine, thanks to you. He’s right over there.” Dr. Mills used the remote control to raise the back of Cas’s hospital bed so that he could see that Dean was fast asleep on a chair in the corner of the room, snoring up a storm.
you I wasn’t worth all the worry.”
Dean licked his lips, heart racing. “...Cas?” he whispered, daring to hope.
“That’s my buddy Charlie. She’s a great artist.” Dean looked over his shoulder to see which book Cas was looking at. “Stupid friggin’ Disney Channel totally ripped off
”Gotta admit,” Dean said softly, resting his chin on his folded arms on the back of the couch to look over Cas’s shoulder at the phone, “we do kinda make a cute couple.”
, and yet... “Do you see how gorgeous your lips look stretched around my cock, Dean?”
“But you didn’t write it down yet, did you?” Charlie said, looking at Chuck’s typewriter. “I mean, that’s the rule, right? It’s not a part of the story yet if you don’t write it down.”
“I love you, Cas.”

“Yes...but first I want to turn you over and watch you touch yourself.”
Santa sighed. “This is a
This made Cas freeze. Wait, what? “His...son?” he said softly.
“The law says you can’t give me anything. There’s nothing that says I can’t give you something,” Castiel teased back.
,” Cas said insistently. “The guest!”
Cas just laid the pages aside so he could comfort Dean properly. He only wished he could spare Dean this pain.
But Cas figured, if he was to die soon, it wouldn’t really matter, would it.
With nothing left to say, Castiel walked out of the small dwelling, to live out the rest of his life.
Sam was giving a smug look. Dean sighed in defeat, setting the mug down. “Alright. Fine. So we’re both a pair of lovestruck idiots. What do you want me to do about it? Cas has gone off to who knows where to bury his head in the sand.”
“Yeah. It is.” Dean sniffled. “I...I never thought I could
Well that was impossible. It had to be 3 in the afternoon at least. That strange glitching in Joshua’s office—it must’ve reset his watch or something. “Does anyone have the time?” he asked the group he was standing with as they waited to cross. He would’ve checked his phone, but it had run out of battery somewhere between his meltdown outside of Winchester’s Garage and his uncomfortable HR meeting.
“What do you mean?” Sam asked.
Cas’s stomach clenched as Dean came into the kitchen in his grey robe. “Mornin’,” Dean grunted, helping himself to a cup of coffee.
“Actually...I had the weirdest dream. I can’t quite remember it. I remember...Italian food...and soap bubbles?”
“I...I don’t feel well.” It wasn’t a lie. Cas was feeling sick to his stomach.
The pearl hadn’t just given Cas Dean’s love. It had given him, both of them,
“How can I refuse when you beg like that?” Castiel unzipped his black slacks and pulled his hard cock out of his boxer briefs. “Open your mouth, Dean.”
“Cas!” Dean protested.
Cas.” Cas pulled out of Dean so he could flip over. Cas slid a pillow underneath Dean’s hips and slowly slid back inside. The angle was different now but still good, especially since he look into Dean’s eyes. He resumed thrusting into him but slowed down a bit, wanting to really feel Dean enveloping each inch of him.
“That’s me. I’m a simp.”
Dean gestured toward himself with a smirk. “Come at me, Edward.”
“What? What is it?”
Finally, Cas wrapped Dean’s arms around himself like a post-coital cuddle.
But what about Dean?”
“Where is Dean? Is he okay? Can I see him?” pleaded Cas weakly.
Dean licked his lips, his heart beating nervously. “And why exactly would an angel rescue
“I’d like that.” Castiel had recently lost his front tooth, so there was a gap in his smile. “There’s never anyone for me to play with. Except the reindeer, but Uriel won’t let me go in the stables.”
Dean stood there, mulling over that for a second. “Could be a tattoo,” he finally said. “Or henna.”
. Be right back.” Dean hopped off the couch to go back into the kitchen.
“I’m...I’m not very good,” Castiel muttered.
“Way too thin, plus it’s the wrong smell.”
Dean laughed again, and then murmured huskily, “Is that something you wanna see, sweetheart? Wanna watch me touch myself? Wanna feel me get off to the thought of you?”
“Well, technically, it’s supposed to give you ‘what your heart desires.’” Sam looked significantly at Cas.
Cas smiled at him, exhausted. “Hello, Dean.”
Chuck finally came to, blinking blearily. His eyes focused on Castiel. “Oh God, he
Cas’s fingers were wet from Dean’s release. Curious, he raised his fingers to his mouth and licked. Hmm. Interesting. Not quite the same as semen...certainly not terrible. “I think next time I might like to try cunnilingus, if you would consent to that.”
Dean gave him a bewildered look.
“What’s so complicated? You want me, I want you...what else do we need?”
about the sound of his first name on Dean’s breath that made Cas go weak. “Why of all songs to learn on guitar...did you pick that one?” He smiled, green eyes sparkling as if he already knew.
Uriel/The Empty hummed bemusedly. “We had a deal, Castiel. I leave the child alone, I get

“Not the
“Yeah?”
“It’s sort of a hobby I’ve recently picked up,” Castiel admitted. “I always wanted to learn to play, so I finally decided to just...do it.”
“Your shoes? They’re alright, I guess.”
”What, ‘Cas?’”
Dean could still feel the sensations against his own skin, but his bones and muscles moved of their own accord, or rather, by Cas’s will, as the angel took control. Cas ran Dean’s thumb over his lips, rubbing gently.
Dean blinked. “It...wasn’t?”
“Oh. Okay.” Castiel clutched his briefcase, practically feeling the other man’s annoyance pushing at him. “I’ve...I’ve messed this up...haven’t I. You were just...trying to be nice to me and give me another chance and I...I messed it up, like I always do.”
“Best not poke the bear,” Sam said nervously, coaxing the witch away from Dean by her shoulders. “Come on, I’ve got you set up in the war room.”
Cas held up two spoons. “Shall we dig in?”
“That’s fine,” Eileen said. “Let’s not argue about it.”
“Oh, I couldn’t impose...”
Cas realized it was Saturday. He pulled out his phone and checked something on his calendar...then smiled. “Would you like to go on a date with me? To a rock concert?”
from that one. Sandover tried to sue for intellectual theft but the judge tossed the case out. Too bad too, I’d be rolling in royalties if we’d won that one.”
to me as if I’m not gonna get the reference.”
“Interesting...and after you left the garage, the narrator said
Castiel remembered what Gabriel had told him about Dean’s father and put that book aside too, picking up another. “What about this one?” he asked, holding up
“This is very bad,” Castiel said.
“Whatchya find?” Dean asked as Castiel approached, heading for the exit. He was looking at the tip of this finger.
“If it helps, I really don’t think he’s a bad guy,” Sam said. “He’s beating himself up because he can’t save everyone.”
There was a sigh. “C’mon Dean, don’t do this to me. You’re on roaming in international waters, remember? If you need to go freak out, hang up first.”
Charlie smirked.
It wasn't his fault he was fast at getting ready.
“Or someone,” he whispered.
“Yeah, just stay there for a sec,” Dean said. His voice had gone a little wonky and his heart was beating faster. Maybe it would have been easier if Castiel had left, but he really, for some strange reason, did not want that to happen.
Their apartment was small and only a fraction bigger than their dorm rooms had been. But it was theirs and theirs alone, making senior year much more enjoyable. Benny and Garth still dropped by from time to time, missing that quad life together, but overall, it had been nice to make the break and get his best friend all to himself.
“Let Roberts die,” Dean mumbled into his shoulder. “It will make me feel better.”
They stopped when a cheery whistle, completely incongruent with the earlier wail, came from their left, and then a white skinned, fat little man rounded a tree and came into view pushing a wheelbarrow.
The rest of the meal was nothing but an erotic foreplay. The fact that they were being nourished was a secondary bonus that meant little.
“No,” Castiel said coldly. “You manipulated me and killed innocents with such ease. You are not my brother. You didn’t deserve God’s punishment, but you deserve this.”
“Oh my fuck,” Dean mumbled, a hand tightening in Castiel’s hair, the other gripping the bedspread tight, feeling his nipple tighten as the texture of Castiel’s tongue continually swirled over it. “Shit Cas, how’d you learn all my buttons?” Castiel chuckled before biting gently.
The moment was shattered by an ear piercing scream.
It ended when Dean’s focus slid to Cas’s hand on his arm. “Alright, but only on one condition.”
John agreed and led the way to the stables where Castiel was sure to be tending the horses at this time of day.
“Bitch.”
Dean was a prisoner and he knew it. Sure, the guards outside his room, the ones that followed him to the dining hall and the few places he was allowed to roam, were placed there under the pretense of protecting him, but he was no fool. They were there to keep him from leaving. Whatever Crowley wanted him for, it certainly wasn't for a loving and healthy relationship.
“She’s busy. Guess I’ll try Jo.”
“You dick,” Dean said. Utterly unhelpful, but the snark made him feel better.
Dean swallowed. “You tell me-”
Dean was laughing by the time she cut herself off. “Sorry Charlie, the biologist is a dude. And I’d go into detail about how hot he is, but you aren’t interested.”
Castiel sighed. He grabbed the closest chair and pulled up to Dean, sitting so close to Dean, they were sharing air. A slim finger tilted Dean’s up, forcing him to meet Castiel’s eyes. They were warm and understanding, with a trace of uncertainty in the pools of blue. Castiel kissed him gently, breaking the kiss just as softly.
And more than once, when the comedy was in a slow spot, Dean was positive he could feel Castiel’s eyes on his profile. But he was too scared to turn and confirm it.
“I want my mother back, you son of a bitch.”
“You first.”
Kevin looked at her sharply, his eyes holding no fear. “Then I will duel him left-handed,” he stated. Abaddon blinked at him several times in question, her face getting every more scrunched as she waited for an explanation. Eventually, Kevin elaborated. “It's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right, it would be over too quickly.”
, he spoke.
“God you are so screwed up,” Sam said, standing up. He walked to the door and paused. He waited so long to speak that Dean tensed with the tension. Finally, he said, “You’ve let your fear of Dad’s and other’s opinions control you for long enough, don’t you think? Figure yourself out.”
Then there was the part about carving souls in hell that he really could have done without the reminder of. Dean couldn’t remember being rescued, but he knows when it must have happened, because he doesn’t remember carving anyone up. But he sure as heaven remembers contemplating it. He didn’t think he could have taken one more day of being flayed before he would have agreed. One more day and Dean would have been the one ripping people apart.
It didn’t move, so he pulled again. And again, until he nearly face planted with the counter force. Behind him, Charlie, Kevin and Sam were beginning to laugh. He turned to tell Cas that he was wrong when suddenly, Cas was beside him.
“Ugh,” Kevin bemoaned, looking at his burger. “They forgot to take the onion off.”
“You wouldn’t.”
They grabbed their bags and Dean followed Cas out of the theater and to the student parking lot. His jaw dropped when Castiel walked over to an old, gold Lincoln Continental. It looked like a freaking pimpmobile. Not that his was much better, nothing like his dad’s badass ’67 Impala, but at least he wasn’t going to attract any prostitutes with it.
“I will,” Castiel assured him. “But as I need less than you, I will keep watch for most of the night.” He looked to Dean, his blue eyes dancing in the moonlight. “Get some rest, Dean.”
“CAS!” he cried, falling on him carelessly. Castiel grunted in pain. “Oh thank god, I thought I'd killed you!” Dean kissed him hard on the lips. Castiel grunted again, though it had a happy note to it this time.
“Okay. Good point.”
“What?” Dean said, turning to look.
Cas stabbed a fry with a fork. Honestly. With a fork. “It’s 73.”
Charlie shrugged. “If the couple is happy, who cares where it comes from?”
Castiel kisses his shoulder before collapsing onto the bed next to Dean.
He yelps as a firm hand smacks his ass hard.
It was sort of moot when he got to class a second before the bell rung and had no time to approach him. They sat on opposite sides of the room in assigned seating that rotated quarterly, so whispering was out, even if he was willing to risk it in Mrs. Beranger’s class. Similarly, there was no way in hell he was going to start passing notes. Mrs. B. was terrifying.
The coat was folded gently, but as it was bigger than the drawer it was in, it was stuffed to the brim and crunched. At first glance, it looked like a large furry animal had crawled in and gotten stuck.
Castiel sucked in a loud, deep breath. He was staring at Dean’s left shoulder. Dean was so used to living with it, he’d nearly forgotten about the handprint fried into his flesh. Of course Cas would be thrown by that.
You don’t hit on your roommates. Ever. It was rule number one.
“This is a California roll, it has crab, avocado, and cucumber. Crab is always cooked, if that was a concern,” Castiel explained. “Try it.”
Castiel liked it, if his moan was anything to go by. The vibrations sent another pulse through Dean’s body and, without his conscious command, his grip in Castiel’s hair was forcing him to stop.
“You worried?”
He briefly wonders what all he was screaming as he tried desperately hard to reach his own prostate.
That night, Dean discovered how Castiel was able to walk around in the cold without a tunic, why he didn’t need a blanket. The guy radiated heat like his veins were made of liquid blue coals. Dean started to sweat under the blanket and was finally forced to kick it off. He was still melting though, all of that heat trapped in the wooden walls, so he pulled off his tunic.
“What, you aren’t happy to see me?” Dean asked, partly a tease, partly a jibe.
“How kind of you,” the man responded. This time, he did sound a little sarcastic.
Cas glanced at the bit of exposed neck where Dean had intentionally left the first two buttons open. His voice was about two octaves deeper when he spoke. “Why mess with perfection?” He blushed violently, and hope sprung in Dean’s chest. Could you date your roommate if he wanted it too? Maybe that was okay?
Crowley said it in such a way that Dean gathered he was supposed to be impressed.
“Yeah,” Dean confirmed.
“Fuck, yes,” Dean said. “Harder, Cas. I know you can.”
It seemed as if the sun rising was what chased off the mist, but Dean knew it was more about the distance. Somehow the mist was permanent around Castiel’s tent, and Dean was willing to just let that mystery go.
Slowly, teasingly, he rubbed his cock against Dean, using his grip to guide it, smearing it through puddles of Dean’s come. Dean could barely breathe with how intensely erotic it was. Who would have guessed he had a thing for come play?
“Of course I’m happy, Dean,” Castiel answered, his gaze sweeping over Dean. “But you would have come alone if this was a social visit. So what happened?”
“He's going to catch up,” the Asian noted.
It must have been working for Castiel too, cause he moaned into Dean’s mouth.
“Cool,” Sam said, bouncing on his feet. “Not quite what I had in mind, but if it gets you to relax, I'm all in. What do you want to hit first? Slots? Roulette?”
He escaped dinner early. He made an excuse about seasickness and headed out. He didn't go to his room however. The halls were quiet, with everyone, or almost everyone, down at dinner, and Dean soaked in the peacefulness. When he made it outside, he discovered that the sun was low in the sky. If he headed to his right, he'd probably have a great view of the sun setting. Somehow, a part of him was excited about that.
Castiel felt a little piece of himself, a piece that he didn’t even know he had, come loose and lodge itself in his throat. He had no words, so he gave a curt jerk of his head to indicate that he understood.
Though Donahue was being a bit absurd with the theatrics, Dean had to admit that he must have been hit pretty hard and he was lucky he didn’t need serious medical attention. He’d been hit in the head with a heavy souvenir of Chichen Itza he’d picked up in town. Gauze was tapped to the side of forehead, and another hunk was tapped to his arm.
She had the audacity to contemplate it for a minute before nodding.
Castiel’s eyes flickered shut and he swallowed hard. He didn’t want to say what he was about to say. “I know of a weapon,” he finally said. “It’s too late to set out now, but tomorrow, I will take you to it.”
“But you are.”
“Dude, I think we’re married now.”
“You had me at
Omiel looked at the blade in shock. The entire dance had happened in a second.  He didn’t die right away, nor did he seem to be shrugging it off.
It had only been one week since they started running lines together, and with Castiel’s busy rehearsal schedule, that meant they’d only met up twice since the first night. Dean was definitely loosening up about it, and Castiel was starting to remember his lines more easily. And when he didn’t have to think as hard about his lines, practice went smoother.
a little intimidating though.
Dean was pretty distracted during the movie and even jumped when Castiel’s hand brushed his.
He was interrupted by a coughing fit, and the sound of a spoon clattering into a cereal bowl.
“That looks worse,” he stated, once Castiel was on his feet. His face was full of worry.
“Uh. Yeah, um. Sam left the TV on one night and I heard a name…” he palmed the back of his neck. That was really cute. “I should go. To lunch. I should. Yep.”
“Good for you, Dean,” Castiel purred. “Get in here. Mr. Bond would like to bring you to your knees.”
“I’m going to teach you how to fight,” Castiel said casually.
“Cas. You’re right. Let the world know, and let me finish my book.”
“As you wish.”
Omiel ignored him. “So I raised Gatlin’s spirit, targeted him on his old enemies, ones that came to the shop so I’d know you’d notice. And sure enough, you started to manifest more and more abilities. It’s coming back now, isn’t it?” Omiel paused, didn’t need Castiel to answer, and licked his lips. “Then this man showed up and everything fell into place. That wasn’t even part of the plan, you reuniting with the soul you rushed to save. But it helped.”
Dean settled into the couch and would soon discover the movies were as good as he remembered. The company was even better. They made out a few times, but Castiel always pulled back before things got too heavy. Between the movie, the whiskey, and the man next to him, Dean was more content than he could remember being in a long time. It was unsettlingly sappy and far too adorable for two grown men, but he wasn’t going to let that get in the way.
“I give my word as an Asian.”
It took Dean a moment to realize he was cleaning up Dean’s come.
And if Dean thought the first half of the night had been brutal, the rest of it was even worse. Now they weren’t pretending to be a couple, so much as trying to hide the fake that they
“Oh yes,” Cas said, sitting back. The pressure was back at Dean’s hole as Castiel lined himself up. “I’m going to make you see stars.”
Once the door was shut and the storm door was banging against the frame behind them, Dean took a deep, cleansing breath of the warm, moist air. The temperature had gone up at least five degrees while they were inside. He was going to have to start peeling layers off.
Still, Dean was tired, hot, and hungry, so he decided the fire had gone long enough and turned to start filling the pit back in. That’s when it happened.
Castiel opened his mouth to reply, but Ash was waving his arm violently from the wing, trying to get Dean off the stage. Cas nodded instead, mouthing, “We’ll talk.”
“Not to interrupt whatever that was, but no, we’re not leaving,” Sam said. “We hit a snag. Hoped you could help.”
“What?” Dean asked, finding enough strength to stand without the support of the pillar. “Do I honestly look like a guy that would enjoy a trip to a spa?”
“I always wondered about that,” Victor said, chiming in. Everyone looked at him. “I mean, with Maureen, in the play. She was with Mark, and then Joanne. Wouldn’t that make her bisexual? Why did Mrs. Moseley call her a lesbian?”
Dean whirled in his computer chair and stared at Cas. “How dare you.”
“In nomine deleo virtutes universi positivum!"
Castiel nodded his understanding. Then, “Did you sleep with him?” he asked, trying to sound casual, but Dean could hear the tension in his tone.
“My secret wasn’t holding back vital information to solving the crimes happening on this boat.”
Sam's lifelong dreams weren't riding on this man's help, and even his shoulders sank.
And Dean, Dean definitely loved him.
Dean barked out a laugh. He grabbed Cas’s phone, hit the stop button on the video, and tossed it to the empty cushion behind them. “Later. We have some time to make up for.” He twitched an eyebrow up and nodded towards the hallway where their bedrooms were. The only times he’d seen Cas naked were by accident and the memories were blurry.
Kevin snorted from nearby. “Charlie has issues,” he stated. “Don’t listen to her, man, I think it’s sweet.”
Castiel grinned. “Maybe, but for right now…” He let the sentence hang as he unbuttoned his pants, popped the button on his boxers, and slid his hand inside the fabric. Dean watched with hungry eyes as he guided his cock through the slit of the material.
‘I’m not that good. My acting was terrible. Probably didn’t make it. Find yourself another star.’
“It’s barbaric,” Gabriel spit from the corner.
“Dean!” Sam said. “For fuck’s sakes,” he mumbled as he grabbed the box from Dean’s hands, lit the match on the first try and tossed it in.
Fortunately, the topic of his crush on Dean did not come back up for the rest of practice. It did, however, come up again after practice.
The blue eyed sex god looked up, confused.
for the first time when he was 13 had made him feel a little less strange for liking theatre so much. Everyone was weird, right?
Metatron nodded. His fingers were tracing over the trunk of the tree they had just arrived at. “I can never find the knot,” he mumbled. Then his fingers traced over the trigger and he pressed it. The panel in the tree slid open. “Coming? Castiel has his strength back. I'll be starting him on The Machine.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, cutting him off his frenzied thoughts, “I assure you, this is exactly what I want. To grow old with you, to return to heaven with you. One day in the far, far distant future of course.” He brought Dean’s palm to his lips and kissed it.
either.” Dean assumed he meant the bar hookup. He gave a tiny shake of his head. “There’s something about you.”
Dean grinned. “Thought you’d never get out of there.”
The way he added on the last part sounded forced and pointed, and a part of Dean knew what Cas was trying to say, but he didn’t really want to think about it.
Dimly, Dean heard a familiar caw and knew that Norbert had found them and would help Castiel by pulling the beasts off of him. So maybe the owl wasn’t so bad at all.
Cas resisted a second sigh. He should be used to Dean’s hedonistic ways by now, and the obsession with naked, lewd, hedonistic women. But he wasn’t. It grated. Every single time. So perhaps he sounded a little annoyed when he said,  “I suppose I could strip if that’s what you really want.”
Dean moaned, and his protest died in his throat, as Castiel’s orders nearly pushed him over the edge.
All in all, the basics ended up being one of the hardest lessons Dean had ever had in anything. He didn’t even know how to hold the sword right at first, how to stand. Sparring was a joke the first time he attempted it. But after an hour had passed, he thought he might be getting the hang of it.
Outwardly, Dean was not impressed. Inwardly, on some level not boiling with anger, he appreciated Castiel’s sass.
He huffed a laugh. “I don’t know, the tie was pretty awful.”
“Well whatever your dad is, at least he’s conscious.”
Dean didn’t notice Cas’ change in his demeanor, so he barreled ahead with conversation.
They headed towards the direction of Dean’s dorm. First-years weren’t allowed to move into the frat house, so Dean shared a room with a guy named Andy. He had a weird sleep schedule and always complained of headaches, but other than that, he mostly kept to himself.
Ever since that day, Dean would mysteriously find a different pair of underwear hanging in his locker. Once it happened two days in a row, another time it was three weeks before a pair came to him. He didn’t check to see if they had been worn or used, he didn’t stop to wonder if that punk Cas copied his idea and was taking the girls’ panties to give to Dean, and he definitely did not think of Cas wearing these panties… and nothing else.
They watched in pity as Dean got slapped by a woman. Sam cringed. Dean headed towards the bathroom. He never returned to their table.
“Exactly!” The cashier perked up. “It’s like the junk drawer of America. Random things that you may not use on a regular basis, but when you need them, the dollar store is the only place that sells it.”
“Maybe try it again? At a different angle? Or it might be the speed.”
Tonight, though, was the first night that Cas had invited Dean back to his place after their date. It was a big step in their relationship, at least as far as Dean was concerned. Maybe nothing would happen, or maybe something would, and Dean didn’t know which choice he was favoring. He was sure of one thing though: his nerves were getting the best of him. He could feel the sweat trickle down his neck and under his shirt, and his stomach was in knots.
“Hey!” Dean yelled again, stopping the man in his tracks. “Have fun with Charlie and Jo, okay? Be safe. Call me if you need to.”
He did a quick lap around the room, scanning for potential hook-ups. Her? No, she was too drunk. Him? Nah. Once the guy turned around, Dean saw how low his pants hung – next! Hmm… everyone seemed so young.
- Castiel
Cas gave Dean a look of jaded disbelief.
“It seems that a Congratulations is in order! Look at you guys.”
“You think seeing your own fingers in my ass will honestly be any better?”
“Once. Rhonda Hurley used her finger when we had sex. She didn’t even make it up to the first knuckle before I was coming. I guess I liked it then? I tried several times after that, but the angle was never quite right.”
“You could say that. Has he been giving you a hard time lately?”
“As much as that sounds –
Dean groaned. “Fuck Cas, do you know how long I’ve wanted this? You? Feels like a lifetime since we had sex.”
“Thank you?”
“You’re not?”
Cas catches his breath before replying: “Amazing… do it again.” And so Dean complies, causing Cas to become someone he doesn’t recognize, moaning with abandon and fucking Dean’s fingers as if his life depends on it.
The boy next to him nods.
, perhaps. Did you ever stop to think how I felt in all of this?”
That all made sense to Dean, and but did the guy have to be so rude?
“Yeah, let me just grab my jacket.”
After putting each arm in its respective hole (and Dean did not want to dwell on the sexual implication of that), he faced his friend. The man ran his fingers over Dean’s shoulders and smoothed out his lapel.
“Man, I hope so, or else I have no idea what these bruises on my back are from!”
It was true that Cas usually ended up with a guy or girl in his bed after every party, and that was one of his motivations for tonight. With Dean in the picture, it seemed he might get his wish after all. Speaking of… where was that boy? Seems he had left, too. Well, what’s one more person to add to the shitpile that was his life? Everybody always left. That’s why he came to these parties. Enjoy the fun while it lasted.
“Come soon. I’m close.” Cas reached for his dick again, and Dean forced himself to close the computer.
“No, I did not.” He took Dean’s map and threw it in the nearby trash.
, Dean thought.
The front door opened, but neither of them noticed.
The man hesitated for a moment only, and then stepped backwards. Dean awkwardly pushed past him and speed-walked towards the urinals.
He quickly found out that the water was too cold for swimming. He hung his underwear on a tree branch to dry, hoping no one would notice.
chesters.”
A schoolgirl hurried past them, snickering.
“My assumptions?” he asked.
Dean looked up from the map in his hands, trying to figure out which buildings held his classes. KU was a huge school, and there weren’t any signs pointing in the right direction.
Stepping back, he yelled “Bottoms up!” The room erupted in cheers, but only half of the people chugged their beers.
Benny groaned. “Why do you have to make everything so gay?”
Dean was 95% sure Cas was joking – which, thank Chuck he was finally picking up on sarcasm! – and was completely convinced once he saw the twinkle in Cas’ eye and his small smirk pulling at those lips. Dean stared a bit too long before remembering he had to say a witty comeback.
“I came here to pee, and unless you’re into watersports, I suggest you let me go.”
This should be good....
“Of course, Dean. It’s the first door on the left in the hallway.”
Cas can’t help but smile at how Dean babbles when he’s nervous.
Charlie was scrolling through Dean’s phone while he was in the bathroom during one of their monthly lunches. Her original excuse was to search for photos of Sam to blackmail him with later on, like the time Dean stuck a spoon in Sam’s mouth while he was asleep in the Impala on a cross-country road trip. But Dean was taking far too long today, and what harm could possibly come from a little snooping? She was deep into the folder of notes on the phone when he finally came outside again.
“No, we have to go to the store to buy a battery-operated fan. I am NOT going a whole summer without sex because it's too damn hot outside, Cas. A man has needs!"
“Of course, Dean.”
The stranger grabbed Dean’s chin with his hand. “Did I say you could talk? You think you can just run that pretty mouth of yours whenever you want? No. No names, no ‘what’s your sign or favorite flower’ bullshit. No exchanging information. This is a quick and dirty fuck, a one-time only offer. Think you can follow those rules?”
“Good?” he asked, looking Cas in the eye. His friend returned the gaze, nodding. “Mhm. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean grabbed a beer from the back, knowing Cas wouldn’t want any. He remembered what Cas used to say:
“I want this to be perfect for Dean.”
“Correct. Besides, children shouldn’t play with dead things.”
Dean threw his head back in pleasure, baring his neck. Cas took the opportunity and latched on, sucking and biting marks into the skin. Raising a hand to hold Cas in place, Dean said: “Don’t – don’t stop. Whatever you do -ohhh – don’t stop.”
The man slung his arm around Dean’s shoulders and guided him to their next destination.
The cashier shook her head in amazement. “What they don’t have these days. Did you buy it at the dollar store? I saw some women yesterday fighting over the last can of it.”
“Yes, Dean. Anything you say.”
The party was in full swing by the time they arrived. Dean offered to get them drinks. He thought it was a bit odd that there were different colored cups, but he grabbed two at random.
He leans their foreheads together. Breaths intermingling but lips not quite touching, Dean says: “You’re safe with me, Cas.”
“I think you’ve heard them all by now, Dean. Aren’t you bored with them yet?”
“You’re right. I don’t like chick-flick moments. They’re gross and make me want to hurl.”
Cas gives him a sad half-smile.
Cas was laid bare face-down on his bed, writhing and grinding against the pillow propped under his hips. As soon as the door to his room opened, Cas looked at Dean with wild eyes.
“Thanks for using a condom, dude.” Dean said in between groans. He couldn’t hear much of anything except their skin slapping together or pants of breath and grunts interspersed. The man behind him mumbled something, which Dean didn’t catch.
Upon hearing the name of his first love and the reminder of what could never be, Sam became visibly uncomfortable. He grabbed his brother’s almost-empty glass, saying “Okay, Dean. I think you’ve had enough to drink.”
“That may be, but you wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Cas’ head whipped up in surprise, his eyes shining with a little more than hope. Dean cupped his cheek and Cas smiled.
Oh, that sound. The video chat’s audio quality was nothing compared to hearing it in real life. It went straight to Dean’s groin, sending electricity through his bones. Feeling hot, he peeled off his flannel layer, leaving him in a tshirt that hugged his biceps. Cas’ gaze grew hungry, and it felt good to be wanted. Needed. Desired.
A mixture of shock, hurt, betrayal, jealousy, and anger could be seen on Dean’s face. That is, if anyone bothered to look. He quickly schooled his expression into a smile before asking: “What’d I miss?”
Imagine Cas’ first time with Dean. He’s a little nervous and overwhelmed, so Dean is gentle.
was too long in my opinion.
“Don’t you dare prolong this any further! Come on, Dean. We both want this,” Cas says as he kisses Dean passionately. Cas moves his hands down to push his friend’s pants and underwear off. Dean’s eyelids close as Cas strokes him a couple times, causing both boys to shudder.
Dean stumbles over the carpet and Castiel tisks. “You’re both tired, which means you’re unproductive and of no use to the case in this state.”
“Just do it!”
Dean can see that Cas is truly scared that it might not - to stay like this forever would be… well, Dean’s the last person who wants that, all jokes aside.
Castiel watches him go to the kitchen and grab a beer from the fridge.
“Jesse, that antichrist kid? The one who turned you into an action-figure?” Sam now asks, as Dean stares at the small angel.
Indeed, Sam takes out a green and a blue Hawaiian t-shirt from the bag slouched over his shoulder, tossing the blue one to Cas, who catches it, smirking, but slightly confused.
Castiel’s eyes go over the walls here, a yellow paint with black stick figures dancing on it. He can recognize many of the stories depicted here.
His hand goes to Cas’, grabbing it and the other moves to the shoulder. Cas’ other hand just stays to his side and he looks at Dean dumbfounded.
Dean’s not the history geek, though, that’s Sammy’s job.
So Cas tells him.
The constant fear of losing him, before he can actually confess how he truly feels is even worse.
He almost forgets Cas is there, when he slices the head clean off, but is reminded of the angel as he gets surrounded by three vamps while Sam gets the girl out of the building.
“Jack, you’re still trying to get control over your powers. Don’t worry, though.” He pats the kid on the shoulder compassionately, “if something comes up and Cas is back to his ‘Big as a Chrysler building’ size, we can split and make the hunts in pairs.”
“Um, so,” he starts, when she doesn’t stop staring, batting her eyelashes at him, “Any other incidents like this happen here?”
He pulls back a little and Castiel’s hand draws back. His eyes look sad, he averts them and Dean instantly feels bad, again. It’s not like he wants to walk away. But.
“Gods.” Castiel replies and when Dean opens his mouth, Cas goes on “I mean, Greek mythology. Norse Mythology. Like Loki. You remember Gabriel, right?”
Dean hums, content, and stretches his legs so they get buried in the sand, half-way.
Cas looks over Dean’s shoulder, being shorter than him means his mouth and nose both touch Dean’s jacket he’s wearing, eyes roaming over him down to the squared, thin boxes that contain Dean’s favorite songs.
Dean’s hands cradle his, the one with the cut, and carefully wipe at the blood there. He doesn’t hesitate, takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wraps it clumsily but gently around Castiel’s finger.
“Would you get down here? I can’t imagine kissing something like a bucket-full of sunlight can be healthy or even possible. And that’s what I wanna do now.”
“Who?” Castiel asks from where he is sitting on the dashboard, back to the road and his eyes on Sam, legs dangling over the edge.
Dean gets up, just to stretch, because the letters are literally floating in front of his eyes now, and gets a glass of water. He almost asks Cas if he wants one, but remember he’s a god-damn celestial being who doesn’t need to drink or eat.
The hunter puts the bottle down on the bedside table but doesn’t reply, just stares at the angel like he’s got absolutely no clue what’s going on.
He widens his eyes and stares at Castiel like he’s just uncovered his deepest, darkest secrets.
Dean glances towards them and stifles a laugh when he sees what’s got Sam in a pickle.
“If you have to leave it behind, can I see it? One more time? As… Like this.” Dean says, his  voice is carried out almost as if in a void, it’s soft and low and his fingers curl into Castiel’s arm even more, strong grip as if afraid they might fall away from each other.
Dean bites his lip. “Look, he’s like a tiny flashlight.”
Dean holds up his finger.
Castiel is holding back a smile but Dean notices and refuses to co-clean with him for the rest of the day.
That face, the lines drawn there more visible than ever, etched by the cruel mistress called time, but to Cas they make the man even more endearing.
He smiles, and takes up the plate of nachos with a side of warm, cheesy sauce and raises it towards Dean, “Nachos?”
’, but Dean’s dumb enough to ignore it, “In Lord of the Rings, dwarves weren’t that much smaller than a kid. You’re more like, the size of a Pez dispenser.”
Just next to the payphone, a dark figure, with the painfully familiar outline of a trenchcoat.
All of it, and Dean knows this well, is probably laying some guilt on Cas, but it is also making him think of himself as a part of this family. Their family.
Dean’s blushing was as evident to him as it was to Sam.
“‘M fine.” Dean mumbles, pulling up a large, thick book on Norse mythology. Sammy really has everything in here.
Dean’s head turns and Cas blinks, caught staring. “Lost something, cowboy?” Dean asks him in a smooth tone, winking at him and Cas’ heart does a somersault.
“That is awesome!” Dean exclaims, like a small child and Castiel smirks at him reluctantly.
He lays on his chest, Dean breathing steadily and then he hears it.
“I’m sorry, what?” Dean asks again.
Dean squints at him and his arm goes to Cas’, squeezing it gently and making eye-contact with him.
There’s a shuffling sound when Dean moves on the chair and Cas looks over, seeing Dean angling himself towards the angel now. “I don’t care.”
Cas laughs, and Dean’s mouth curls into a smile as he does, making the angel feel warm inside again.
“Your standard for genius must be so low-”
“You’re blocking the sun, Sunshine.” Dean’s voice brings him out of his reverie and back to the impossible mission of getting his man into the water.
They don’t address it, but Cas has heard Dean talk in his sleep many times and some of those words are things Dean would never, ever admit to saying.
