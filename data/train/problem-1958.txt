“No, no, nothing like that,” Sherlock laughed and squeezed John’s knee affectionately. John tried not to tense under his touch, despite the tingle that went through his veins. “We’re detectives – we would like to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind.”
“Yes, of course. Julia.” They were quiet for a moment as they clambered into the newly-arrived taxi.
“Oh ‒ her name’s Sarah Sawyer.” Plain. Simple. Boring. “She’s training as a midwife. I actually met her the day of the explosion down at the Barley Mow. She was having lunch with a friend, who I am glad not to have run into again, I have to say.”
The words hung heavy in the space between them and, for a moment, John thought he had upset Sherlock. Perhaps he had worked harder than John had realized to get the words into his mouth and now he had been cut short. The truth was that John
"Oh, no, don't," Sherlock said at once, actually looking up from his work. "I quite like this song."
John petted Sherlock's ruined hair and licked away a dribbled of cum from the corner of his mouth before saying, "Let's go home." Sherlock nodded weakly and finally opened his eyes. His gaze landed on the remote, discarded casually on the sofa, then he looked questioningly up at John. "Oh, no," John said, an evil grin taking over his face before he kissed Sherlock again. "It stays on."
“Alright, alright,” Sherlock muttered, finally breaking their kiss. “The game is still on and apparently the game is impatient.” He slithered out of the chair and made for the door. But as he passed, he dropped a hand onto John’s shoulder and squeezed very briefly.
It took a moment, but John finally took a deep breath through his nose and looked back at Mary’s body. Without another glance at either Sherlock or Lestrade, he stepped forward and began his examination.
John felt very much as if his chest might burst as he stared down at the sweet, odd, ridiculous man in front of him. It
Breaking the stunned silence, John said to Anderson, “I think you’d better go.” Anderson nodded – as much as he did not care for Sherlock, he had developed a certain amount of respect that Donovan did not yet share. Taking up the small box of photos and notes they had already collected, Anderson took Donovan by the elbow and led her out into the stairwell. He shot John a slightly-apologetic look before Sherlock slammed the door in his face.
“The, ah…” John looked back at Sherlock from under his own furrowed brows and his mouth screwed up as he struggled to vocalize his feelings. “Julia, she… she told me her real name is Mary.”
"If I may, Captain?" Sherlock brought one hand from where he was gripping John's thighs and gestured toward his trouser pocket. John nodded and he slipped his fingers into the fabric. Sherlock produced something small and black and held it up for John's inspection between his long fingers.
John’s grin grew and he stretched out his arms to run his fingers lightly down the sides of Sherlock’s thighs. “I know you’ve got a terrible sweet tooth, and that if I can’t get you to eat anything of substance, I can always get you to eat cake and biscuits.” John swept up Sherlock’s left hand and brought it to his lips in a swift kiss. “I know you take your coffee with no milk and two sugars and you take your tea
“Yes she has.” John rocked back on his heels with obvious satisfaction before tucking the card into the breast pocket of his tweed jacket. “Wants to have dinner.”
The evening before, Sherlock had been puttering around the flat with a dressing gown over his (admittedly looser) clothes, and he had looked every inch the eccentric genius John was beginning to suspect he truly was. And the pyjamas he’d tried to pass as jogging pants had clung deliciously to his hips as they made their way around the park.
"I know," Sherlock said, putting up a hand to quiet him. John reached out and took it before wrapping the fingers of his other hand around the back of Sherlock's neck. He brought their foreheads together and he waited until he felt Sherlock's brow un-furrow against his own.
A cold shiver went from the back of John’s neck all the way to his knees. How dare Sherlock say that –
“If you’ve quite finished,” Sherlock interrupted curtly and John and Lestrade stifled their giggles.
, John – not since you and Rosie moved in.” His grey eyes were filled with panic and John squeezed his arm reassuringly.
“Bloody hell,” he muttered, catching sight of the price tags. His eye flew open as he stared at a miniscule pair of earrings that cost the same as a car. They
A pain rippled through his stomach and Sherlock realized that he was on his side again, his face pressed into the dirty pillow there.
daughter? Rosie seemed to think so. She would never know Mary and would have a perfectly amazing and fulfilling hodgepodge family, but John would never forget her. Would never forget what Rosie was missing without even knowing it.
“Daddy! Papa!” Rosie bounded back into the room, Lestrade not far behind. He had taken her to get a juice from the special little Rosie-sized refrigerator in the break room while John calmed Sherlock down. “Officer Greg took me to have my picture drawn by the… uh…”
John took in a breath through his nose and nodded. “Alright – I’m off.” Sherlock did not move, merely turned back to his phone and began typing at a blinding pace. “Sherlock?”
“I like Officer Greg,” Rosie interjected, watching as Sherlock moved his token around the board. “Are you going to help him catch a
“Hello, Rosie-girl!” He stepped swiftly over to her and kissed her on the head. Spotting the Cluedo board, he said, “Ah – or should I say, ‘Hello, Miss Scarlett’?” She beamed and he kissed her again, petting her blonde curls affectionately. To Sherlock, he greeted, “Professor Plum. Ankle up.” Sherlock sighed and raised his wrapped foot onto the corner of the coffee table as instructed.
“It’s a gambit,” Sherlock answered, his eyebrows set with thought. “Putting someone away to make the police complacent.” He ran his fingers over his cheeks, pinching his lips like a fish. Rosie laughed, but he didn’t hear it. “You need to find every single one of Jack’s girls, put them in protective custody until this whole thing is done.”
“Sherlock? You alright?” John’s voice drew his gaze up and he blinked against the burning in his eyes.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John nearly whined, pressing backward and down against those slim fingers. “Now, I’m good, just -”
John shook the uncomfortable feeling away and returned to his examination. There was a faint chemical odour around her face – something he couldn’t place, but could have been a sedative. “I’m not sure – we’ll have to wait for Molly’s final opinion – but it is possible that she was still alive at the time of the uterine extraction.” Lestrade started pacing then, breathing through his mouth, but John pressed on. Looking down the rest of her body, strangely unmarred by knife or other assault, he noticed a tattoo inside her left elbow. “A barcode?”
“– but I will not be subject to any further time-wasting interrogations.” John’s eyebrows were nearly in his hair as he glanced between the detective and the Detective Inspector.
Sherlock stepped in first and pocketed his mobile. He turned to stare at John as he shut the door and hung up his jacket. “Do you want to talk about it?”
A faint click sounded from downstairs and Sherlock darted to his chair, the better to appear uninterested in John’s whereabouts. He placed his feet flat on the floor, then changed his mind and crossed one leg, steepled his fingertips, then gave that up in favour of a discarded newspaper. That was better. Utterly casual.
“That’ll be the concussion ‒ not to worry. I’m heading to Bart’s now to meet an old friend. Come with me and I’ll tidy that wound up. You shouldn’t be left alone until you’re a bit steadier on your feet.”
A large portion of this chapter was taken pretty much verbatim from the episode (ASIP) and many thanks go out to Ariane DeVere for their painstaking transcript on LJ. All my love! <3 Diana
“Can’t risk being seen collecting her,” Sherlock replied matter-of-factly. “Just get her into the car and we’ll all talk together.”
John would come to several interesting conclusions during the course of this experiment, the first of which was this: Sherlock was
“And you thought it appropriate to take Rosie with you?” John could feel that he was being irrational, but he hadn’t slept well since he had shot that man – he never did for a few days after – and things between him and Sherlock were so…
He had dropped the crop onto the couch, but he found it again as his arousal spiraled in his abdomen. Running the tongue of the crop down Sherlock's twitching spine, John continued down until the shaft slid between his arse cheeks. Sherlock's hips rolled upward, begging for more, and John obliged. As he pressed as hard as he could on the plug, Sherlock cried out around John's cock and buried his nose at the base. That was it - John came so hard and so long that he thought he might black out. But he focused on the feeling of his cum filling Sherlock's throat, spilling from the corners of his mouth, his tongue writhing against the underside of his shaft and John shouted violently, "
But he was also dancing with another man and John felt his temper beginning to rise. Sherlock was speaking into the man’s ear over the loud club remix of… yes, that
“Yeah,” Lestrade said, pulling a notebook from his pocket and reading out details. “Deceased is one Thomas Crewe, forty-seven. Arrived here last night with his co-worker, Frank Dodds, around midnight. Sometime around two AM, Dodds saw Crewe pass out, but thought it was from drink. Which was odd, because he’d only had one glass of whiskey to Dodds’ three. But, you know, high-stress job, exhaustion ‒ he just wrote it off.”
Don't think I've mentioned before, but, as always, I get my direct quotes from Ariane DeVere's lovingly-captured episode transcripts. Can't thank you enough, Ariane! https://arianedevere.livejournal.com/
“It was on that ‒ that card with your photograph on it in your billfold,” John replied. “January sixth, nineteen-hundred and seventy-seven.”
“I’ve got people out looking for them but, Sherlock, I can’t house them all. We haven’t got the resources to -”
The song had already elicited a toe-tap from John, who pretended to be reading, but Sherlock made quite an uncomfortable face.
Sherlock's cheek lifted in that beautiful, smug, smile and he said no more about it. "John, would you  change the radio station? I can't stand to listen to
love Sherlock – he felt it in bottom of his heart. He also felt very stupid for not having admitted it to himself before now. But it was too soon to say – it would make things too intense too fast. And John wanted things to be as comfortable and familial as it had always been.
“Yeah! Look at it!” She practically leapt into John’s arms, the portrait in her hand, and waved it under Sherlock’s nose. He examined the paper closely.
So Sherlock didn’t care one way or the other about classic rock. And John may have ruined this particular trial in his overall experiment.
Sherlock cleared his throat and took a calming breath. “You’re right. Of course you’re right.” With that, he reached out and wrapped the collar around the neck of the Scottish Terrier puppy in John’s arms. He couldn’t help but give his soft chin a little scratch. Sherlock arranged the little silver tag so that the name shone in the soft glow of the Christmas lights strung about the flat. “Arthur.”
“And she left you her calling card?” Glancing down, Sherlock saw the woman’s name and address printed on the paper in John’s hand.
“Four-twenty-five.” Sherlock gave an imperious wave over his shoulder at such trivialities as the time.
“Nothing,” John agreed. “But if he hasn’t had a heart attack or something, I can’t think what else it might be.” Sherlock gave a deep, contemplative
Sherlock’s eyes were so wide, so soft and questioning; his mouth was slightly agape in that way it only was when he was well and truly shocked. He was terrified that John would be so upset that he would take Rosie away. But he could never do that. Not now. Not after all they had moved passed.
, breathing deeply of John's scent. John couldn’t help the soft moan that escaped his lips. Sherlock mouthed wetly at John's erection for a moment before shucking his pants as well.
“Yes, yes. I love you, too,” Sherlock replied and despite his impatient tone, John knew he meant it. He smiled at the great softie disguised as an aloof detective and stood, his heart warming.
“No worries, we still have time.” Sherlock was on his mobile when John returned to the car. As he slid into the back seat, the detective continued, “Because that woman’s already dead, Lestrade, and so far we have no reason to suspect he will kill again right away. Now, listen, you know I don’t –” Sherlock’s voice cut off suddenly and John looked over to see those mercurial grey eyes studying him. “Lestrade, I’ll text you later.” He abruptly hung up and stared intently at John. “You’re upset.”
Man, has it been a while since I updated. Sorry everyone. :/ Life, you know? I've been submitting book queries and preparing for a job interview, so cross your fingers and send all the good thoughts. In order to sublimate my anxiety while I wait to hear about the job, I shall dive right back into writing. Huzzah!
They remained in that configuration, silent in the backseat of the towncar, until they arrived back at Baker Street. Then Sherlock removed his hand from John’s leg and the skin there felt suddenly cold. Sherlock was already texting as he reached the front door and paused, waiting for John to come around and open it. Annoyed again, John took his time coming up the stoop. In they went, up the stairs, and John unlocked the door to their flat.
“That’s because you’re almost wilfully-ignorant of style, John. Now, let’s go! The game is on!” Sherlock took the stairs three at a time as John pulled a new jumper over Rosie’s head, this one blue with pink polka-dots which did not elicit a tantrum. He picked her up and headed down the stairs himself to find Sherlock waiting at the door of the flat with John and Rosie’s coats in hand, waiting impatiently.
Making rather a show of it, John stretched out his arm and took his time selecting a dumpling from the plate in the center. Finally, Sherlock did a little double-take as John’s unnecessarily fancy chopsticks closed around one and transferred it to his mouth. At the sight of the utensils in John’s hand, Sherlock’s eyes widened fractionally and the slightest trace of a smile pulled at his lips. He said nothing, merely retrieved his food and visibly relaxed.
"Yes. It's rather catchy." Sherlock put away the final slide and made to change tasks - John's failed soil analysis. John turned the volume back up and went to stand beside his husband.
"I do what I have to do to-" John very abruptly cut him off by slapping him across this face. Not very hard, but enough to shut him right up. And hard enough to cause his eyes to darken with what John instantly recognized as lust.
“It’s alright, they’ve gone,” John said, but Sherlock continued to move backward and forth in the room so hurriedly that John worried he might wear through the carpet. Grabbing the taller man by the elbow, John finally got him to stop walking. “Sherlock – it’s alright.”
by David Bowie, his torso responded in kind, and his slim body practically undulated as he moved from table to table with his magnifier. Interesting.
"A remote?" It was a single button, no larger than John's thumb, and suddenly he remembered what it was for. "Ooh, you
His fingers pressed into the soft-hard flesh of Sherlock’s shaft as if he were finding notes on the fretboard. Dancing up and down, the digits pressed and released in rhythm with the radio, eliciting a deep groan from the detective. With one last strong, cheek-hollowing suck, John pulled off and replaced his left hand with his right. He dropped his left hand down to Sherlock’s warm balls, pulsing with arousal, and tickled.
“Don’t patronize me, John. And don’t say ‘clue’ as if we’re characters in a mystery novel.” Sherlock’s elegant hands fluttered around in annoyance before he literally flopped onto the ground.
wanted to step on your toes, to get in the way of your raising Rosie.” Sherlock ducked his gaze and took a shaky breath. “I love her – really, I do – and I love being here for her, but if she ascribes such importance to me then it is inevitable that at some point, I am going to…” He trailed off and John’s chest tightened. He truly was scared.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock mumbled. Dr. Watson put a gentle hand on his elbow and nodded knowingly.
not enjoyed it a little. Trying to look calm, casual, and relaxed, John walked through the fine jewellery department until he saw the Cartier display.
John turned to stare unabashedly at the back of Sherlock's head. He was murmuring the lyrics as he adjusted the sight on the microscope, completely unaware of the absurdity of his behaviour. Sherlock - Mister "what beetles" - was singing along with Ellie Goulding. John wanted to laugh so badly, but he swallowed it down.
John was achingly hard and he knew Sherlock would be too. So he knew that when he brought back the riding crop and snapped it forward on Sherlock's erection, his reaction would be exquisite. And he was right. Sherlock's entire body tightened as he arched backward with a deep, loud, indulgent moan.
He took in another deep breath and sat up. This was something Sherlock didn’t understand and that was part of John’s job as Sherlock’s friend – to help him understand. “Because life partners is something else, its… not just mates. They’re…
He was already late for the surgery and had been struggling to corral Rosie for more than thirty minutes before he finally shouted in exasperation, "Sherlock! A little help, please!"
“It’s the only way I have of getting in touch with Brook,” Sherlock replied. “His letter didn’t exactly include a return address.”
, half-lidded eyes and a teasing smile, and John couldn’t help the shiver that ran through him. Despite the corpse.
“John, I’ve been flirting with you at crime scenes since the first day we met,” Sherlock replied matter-of-factly, his eyebrows raised as though to indicate that John really was being very thick. After a moment, John made that adorable face he always made – eyes wide, eyebrows up, mouth open but smiling. It always made Sherlock’s chest tighten.
Through the ground floor of the townhome and into the walled garden, Sherlock and John met Lestrade where he stood over the young woman’s body, covered with a sheet. “Gents,” Lestrade greeted. When he spotted Sherlock’s cane, he said, “What happened to you?”
"Wassamatter?" John hadn't intended to slur quite so badly that time. But his arousal was intensifying the mottling of his intoxicated tongue and it was the most pleasant floating feeling. Orgasm would be better, though. Why was Sherlock upset?
the danger and the adventure Sherlock offered him. But Sherlock knew, didn’t he? He’d always seen John as so good, so strong, so kind. And Sherlock
“Listen, I know thinking about Redbeard is hard for you,” he said gently. “But I think this is going to be good for you.” John shifted the bundle in his arms and gave Sherlock’s elbow a light, reassuring squeeze. “And Rosie is going to love it.”
“I was planning on it,” John answered as Sherlock dashed across the road and took a running leap over the wrought-iron fencing of the park using a parking meter for leverage. This daredevil-ish action elicited a squeal of delight from Rosie and John couldn’t help but smile at the sight of Sherlock, so excited and energized. He landed in the shrubbery and ducked down until John lost sight of him. That made John uneasy – he liked to always have eyes on Sherlock, just in case. But with Rosie in-hand, he could hardly go running after him.
Rosie crossed her arms and stomped her foot and John was almost disappointed at how cliché she was being. She gripped her space printed quilt in a vice grip and scrunched up her face until more angry tears started to fall. Despite his frustration, John felt his will beginning to weaken.
"That she's been a fan for years, didn't believe I was dead, was thrilled when we got together, that sort of thing." Sherlock turned onto his side so that he was murmuring against John's abdomen, eyes closed, ready for sleep. "Apparently there are people all over who are very invested in our relationship."
“We’ve only just met ‒ the poor chap’s gone and split his head.” Watson put his hand on Sherlock’s arm again ‒ that was pleasant. Steadying. He urged him onto a stool and quickly but calmly gathered a few tools while Sherlock removed his soiled coat. Armed with a needle and tread, a small basin of hot water, and a bottle of alcohol, Watson gently pushed back Sherlock’s hair. He took to cleansing the wound there, which was larger than Sherlock had initially determined. When Watson pressed an alcohol-soaked cloth to the cut, Sherlock hissed with pain. “Apologies, sir.”
Sherlock threw out a hand and a cab appeared from out of nowhere. He climbed in ahead of John ‒ who did his best not to stare at Sherlock’s arse, though it was practically in his face ‒ and gave the address to the cabbie. They pulled away from the curb and Sherlock immediately began talking. “Why did you let the room upstairs? Why not stay with your brother?”
“Well, I don’t particularly care for it, either, but it is what it is.” John sat forward with a stiff groan and rubbed at his eyes. “We can’t let her roam about the city unaccompanied while people are trying to kill her.”
Ugh. When are they going to kiss again?! Probably in the next chapter, if I had to guess. And I should know, right?
“Jesus,” John murmured, frustratingly amazed by Sherlock’s very existence. He had absorbed the music like a sponge, the lyrics certainly passing through his mind without notice and implanting this morning’s mood on his brain. And, apparently, selecting a different language option on the way through.
“You’re going home to ice and elevate that ankle,” John replied. When Sherlock made to argue, he pressed on with full military authority. “Now.”
He didn’t know how, but he made it back to Baker Street. Damn it. He hadn’t been paying attention to his route, hadn’t been taking note of the nuances of the streets. All of his walking had been for naught. And now the sole of his right shoe was beginning to wear through.
“I’ve never heard you refuse work before.” John nipped at the delicate skin just behind his ear, drawing out a stuttering sigh.
“I don’t like it,” he repeated. Sherlock was sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the sofa, his face absurdly close to John’s where he
“I know.” He hadn’t known until just then. He’d wondered, but never asked. It had been obvious to John that Sherlock had not used since his last relapse, but he had honestly always suspected that he had kept a little bit – a security blanket – somewhere in the flat. Apparently not. “I know,” he said again, and Sherlock relaxed a little.
Sherlock hummed as John’s lips traced their way up to that painfully-sharp jawbone and said, “It’ll keep.”
“And just what in the hell were you thinking, dancing on some strange bloke like that?” John demanded, turning his full authority on Sherlock.
: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You’re looking for cheap accommodation, but you’re not going to your brother for help: that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you
Sherlock had learned several years ago to obey John’s medical orders, so he took up the cane without any further protest. He hobbled as quickly as possible and John remained a step behind to preserve his fragile ego as they approached the cordoned building where Donovan had established the crime scene.
Sherlock looked rather pleased with himself. “Spot on, then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.”
John worked his way through the crowd, occasionally showing the photo to someone who wasn't tied up or engaged in some other sexual activity. But the drink in his hand and the heavy bass of the club music made it hard to concentrate. From every side, people were bumping up against him as they writhed and rutted and fucked. His cock was hardening and his head was buzzing. He was quite enjoying this club.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to fix John with an intimidating stare. He smiled, slow and sinister, as he brought the details he had taken in about Sarah Sawyer to the front of his mind. Nice clothes, but at least two years old; repaired twice at the hem and once at the elbow. Traces of greying hair at the temple, minimal makeup. Letter in hand stamped from Norwich, likely family.
“Jesus…” John looked nearly ready to be ill. “I can’t send you packing because then you’ll just be gone, won’t you? You’ll be gone forever soon enough and it is killing me, Sherlock!” He was shouting, but Sherlock suspected that anger was no longer John’s most prevalent emotion.
“We can’t do this,” he panted, taking another step back and extending a hand to maintain distance between them. “I can’t do this, this back and forth, on and off business.” Sherlock heaved a massively inconvenienced sigh and rolled his eyes.
Both of John’s hands were clasped in a fist around the handle of his revolver and he brought them down swiftly over the second man’s extended forearm. The man grunted in pain and John punched him in the side of the head with his left hand. Spinning against the wall, the man dropped his own gun from his unprepared hand and John dragged him to the ground by his collar.
He fumbled for the bit of leather around his arm and took it loosely in his grasp. It took much more effort than it should have, but Sherlock managed to undo the buckle and a strangled gasp clawed its way out of his throat as heat spread through his veins. He flexed his fingers and felt a warm tingle start at the base of his neck and spread down his spine, thrilling and familiar. Another deep sigh and the collar slipped from his limp grasp.
One thing about Sherlock – when he was honest, you could tell. There was a very distinct difference in Sherlock’s mind between acting and lying. He would act as anything or anyone to get information or even to help someone, but he would never lie. At the moment, John almost hated his earnestness. He wanted so badly to be allowed to be angry with Sherlock – to be angry with anyone. Truly, he was just afraid. He had endured war, and injury, and tragic loss, but he was afraid of losing Sherlock again.
“Oh, you do?” Sherlock replied in a mocking tone, eliciting a grin from the little girl across from him.
“Sherlock,” John warned. The detective sighed, exhausted at always having to accommodate the laypeople around him.
“I know you do, love, but you can’t. Not today.” John pulled her tight against him and kissed her head. “Now, I won’t see you at bedtime, so give me my kisses now so I can go to sleep later.” She pouted up at him, but he continued, “You
, Sherlock thought. The answer was clear – Jack’s hired gunmen had done this. Thompson, the one John had shot and held for the police, was obviously just one of many killers on Jack’s payroll – a rotating roster of hired guns to ensure that no one of them would have too much information.
. When Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, it was to plop himself down in his desk chair with a scowl on his face as John took to making Rosie's lunch before he took her to day-care.
“Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.” Sherlock handed the mobile back over and his face fell the moment their fingers touched. He looked very much like he’d just realised that he had been speaking at all and instantly regretted it.
Sherlock moaned and strained against the confines of the drivers seat, stretching his long legs as far as he could and flexing his hips. There wasn’t enough room for Sherlock to spread his thighs like he so clearly wanted, no room for John to dance his fingers back against his perineum and press into his tight hole. John reached back as far as he could, rolling Sherlock’s balls in his palm as his other hand worked furiously on his shaft. Sherlock looked absolutely  gorgeous, chest heaving against his silk dress shirt, tongue flicking out to wet his dry lips, cheeks flushed with arousal. John’s hips twitched at the decadent sight before him.
“Right. Okay. You’re unattached. Like me.” John schooled his expression into one which was incredibly casual. He rolled his neck and shoulders in a stretch, dropping his left arm onto the back of the seat as he did so, and shifted his hips as though extending the stretch. John’s right hand fell to his thigh and he let his fingers drape towards his groin.
"Fuck off." But John did not leave Sherlock to fuck off. Instead, he pulled Sherlock firmer against his chest, away from the counter, and took a larger step backward. The song had a good, bouncy rhythm - easy to dance to if, like John, you didn’t actually know how to dance.
Don't know why it took me so long to write this chapter. Maybe because things are getting a little more emotional? I love writing this story so much, but sometimes I get distracted by my own feels. <3 Diana
“What?” Sherlock snapped and John thrilled a little to see the slight flush rising in Sherlock’s cheeks.
“Thompson, right.” Sherlock rocked back on his heels and glanced around the flat. “Well, Thompson, since you’re not actually going to shoot me, why not put that gun down and tell me about Danielle?”
you!” Sherlock replied, advancing on her. “How dare you insinuate that I would keep drugs in this flat!”
"Know a lot about cocks, d'you?" John slurred around another chuckle. Sherlock crossed his arms and his pouty mouth curved into a very serious frown. "Alright, alright," John waved his hands apologetically, "tell me about the -
It was years ago, now. Three? Four years? John had lost count. After discovering that Sherlock had never, not once, in his entire life seen a James Bond film, John had taken it upon himself to rectify the situation. He’d always been partial to
. John took a deep breath through his nose and stood slowly, glad that he wasn’t quite hard enough to show yet, but seriously regretting that he hadn’t just gone ahead and had that wank in the shower earlier. Their run had rather worked him up ‒ the blood pumping through his veins, the friction of his pants against his cock, Sherlock covered in sweat and barely-hanging on cotton trousers had nearly done him in, but he didn’t want to hog the shower. Now, he wished he had because contrary to everything John had ever known about sexual attraction, Sherlock somehow looked immensely better with
John laughed. "No - the Beatles - the band." Sherlock stared blankly at him. "The Beatles, Sherlock, the most famous British band of all time?"
True to his nature, John felt guilty that he was so distrusting of Sherlock’s mood. He was happy – he was happy with Rosie and with John. Why shouldn’t John feel happy? Perhaps because it likely wouldn’t last and just when he’d get used to the idea of Sherlock cheerfully making burnt toast every morning, he would crash back into one of his sulks and that would be that. Or possibly, just maybe, because John had no right to be so happy to see Sherlock so happy with his daughter.
So now that we've started to get a bit of a routine (and I've figured out ways to hold a baby and still use my hands), hopefully, some more updates will be on the horizon. I beg for patience, but also for constructive criticism.
As every piece of music which had been composed after 1895 was new Sherlock, there was ample material for the experiment. Nothing which was not suited perfectly for his violin was, in Sherlock's opinion, a complete waste of time. John vehemently disagreed, but that was usual for the two of them. But when Sherlock was working, he hardly heard what John was playing about the flat, it merely washed over him like the passing of daylight or the need for sustenance. But the reason John was conducting this experiment in the first place was that he had noticed something a long time ago about Sherlock that had kept him looking for years, even through his strictly "not gay" phase.
“And this Jack character – he’s clearly got more than one killer on call,” continued Lestrade. “We’ve got the other one in custody.”
“Wait just a moment,” he insisted. “There are still three other suspects to consider, not to mention their weapons and locations of choice.”
“Completely brilliant.” He ran his tongue over his smiling lips and saw Sherlock’s eyes dart down to his mouth at the motion. Lestrade said something before turning back to his team, but John couldn’t be arsed to listen. Instead, he stared up at Sherlock and pulled his bottom lip between his teeth, wishing it were Sherlock’s unreal mouth against his own. Little else occupied his mind at that moment other than running his tongue over that sharp Cupid’s bow, his plush bottom lip, that witty tongue swirling around in John’s mouth‒
She turned and gave John a strained smile as she wiped away the few glistening tears on her cheeks. “Of course – I’m just so torn up about Danielle. But I don’t want what happened to her to happen to anyone else.” John wished he had a hankie, but they weren’t very hygienic so he never carried one.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and John smirked. It made Sherlock happy when John was clever. Luckily for Sherlock, John was often clever - more clever than people assumed, which was ridiculous on their parts. John was quite possibly one of the cleverest men Sherlock had ever had the pleasure to know.
“John – I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…” Sherlock fumbled about for the right words, his large hand resting comfortingly on Rosie’s head. Then, almost meekly, he said, “I forgot.”
and let out a whimper before resting his forehead against the inside of John's knee. Sherlock's eyes were clenched tightly shut as he struggled not to grind his hips too hard into his own hand.
John almost laughed. “Of course it was. It was extraordinary ‒ quite extraordinary.” His heart was racing a bit as he stared at Sherlock in awe.
John was a little surprised. Sherlock usually wasn't quite this subdued. He wasn't tapping his fingers or talking incessantly. He was merely staring out at the road ahead of him, his jaw set with determination and thought. Odd. Oh well. They couldn't all be winners. John turned his gaze back out to the passing countryside.
That made John’s heart constrict. “No – no. It wasn’t you – that was… fine.” More than fine, but he wasn’t going to say that.
“Here it is,” he said without trying to hide the smugness in his voice. Sherlock flicked the bank record in John’s direction and he took it without looking up. John had been behaving strangely. For the past fourteen hours, ever since he had awoken so suddenly from his accidental nap on the couch, John had barely made eye-contact with Sherlock. He had been curt and quick to anger and his brow had gained an extra furrow. Odd, Sherlock thought, glancing at the other man from the corner of his eye. Perhaps it has something to do with the obviously erotic dream he was having. Sherlock had the presence of mind to pretend to be deep inside his Mind Palace when John went up to his own bedroom, presumably to take care of his obvious erection and sleep some more. Sherlock fastidiously ignored the pang in his chest at the thought of John alone upstairs.
“Well, you don’t have to,” he replied flippantly. Sherlock stood from the armchair he had taken up by the fireplace and buttoned his suit jacket. He had been waiting for quite some time. The man’s eyebrows lowered. “Where’s Jack?”
“The train should be leaving in two hours, but I still have no idea what is the importance of this particular journey. ‘Save the world’, indeed,” he scoffed.

“God, yes,” Sherlock groaned and the deep timbre of his voice sent a shock straight to John’s prick.
“I believe so,” Lestrade confirmed. “Why?” Sherlock held out the glass for John to smell and he did so.
“I’ve heard enough – this ends now.” John’s eyebrows were high and stern on his face as he held up a warning finger to his daughter. “You are staying here with Aunt Molly until Sherlock and I come collect you tomorrow morning.”
“But why cut her throat? Why not just shoot her?” Sherlock pressed on. “Taking the baby, I understand – evidence – but why go through the trouble of mutilating her that way?”
The shore was swimming a little in Sherlock’s field of vision ‒ there was too much to take in at once. There was not a single officer that he recognised, no medical examiner, no crime tape, no nosey crowd. Wrong ‒ the only word for it was wrong.
“You think this is easy for me?” John’s expression was vacillating between fury and self-loathing. “I haven’t stopped wanting you, Sherlock, but I can’t have you, so what good is it to just sit around pining after you? Traipsing around like a trained puppy. I deserve better than that!”
“Must’ve been the bartender,” John put in. “If Dodds was with him all the time and doesn’t remember anyone tampering with Crewe’s glass.” Sherlock stared at him until John started to feel uncomfortable. “Right?”
He had mixed them up for a while - Victor and Redbeard. But after months of trying to suss out what was real and in what order it had happened, he was beginning to put the pieces back together. With no help from Mycroft, of course. Mostly because Sherlock refused to ask him for help.
“One more gunman,” Lestrade answered, “and just this woman. For now. We’re on our way to pick up the last assassin now.”
Sherlock swooped down and took John’s mouth in a searing kiss. Long legs folded onto the sofa on either side of John and Sherlock buried his fingers in his short blond hair. John let out a little
“Mycroft,” John answered. “He never uses it. Except in emergencies.” John gave Lestrade a short nod, which he returned with one of amazement, and he and Rosie left.
“About a year ago, St. Clair lost most of his money in what seems to be a railroad scheme and had to mortgage the family home in Essex.” He paused and looked down at the papers in confusion. “But how did Janus Enterprises come into it? He didn’t start it up, did he?”
- another decadent moan. "And then he kissed me - he shoved his tongue down my throat because I am a unmitigated slut.
“I’ll stop patronizing you when you stop acting like a child.” Securing the bandage, John replaced Sherlock’s sock and shoe. Holding the long foot against his thigh as he tied Sherlock’s shoe reminded him so strongly of Rosie that he smiled a little wistfully. She was just moving into laced shoes and he and Sherlock had argued at length about the validity of the “bunny ears” method.
Hands pushing Sherlock's trousers to the floor, John licked and nipped at the skin of his chest, pulling slightly at the pale ginger hairs with his teeth. "John," Sherlock sighed, "you are magnificent -
Phew! This chapter got long because I had to lift so much from the script. I'm going to bed now, but tomorrow there will be sex. Stay tuned, lovelies!
He glanced back down at the covered corpse and a hideous though occurred to him. “She was pregnant.” When he caught Sherlock’s eye again, the detective nodded solemnly.
“Yes, in my time it’s referred to as a shell corporation,” he confirmed. “It only exists on paper ‒ no employees, no office ‒ used only to move money from one person or enterprise to another without any direct contact between the two. The name Janus should have been a dead giveaway, honestly.”
“Gladly.” John dropped the mysterious pieces of vinyl or wood or whatever they were in a pile on the floor and determined to have the damned thing put together tomorrow or not at all. Standing in the kitchen, Mary’s hands were indeed full as she was opening a few tins of vegetables for the dish on the range. John turned down the burner and stirred the rice in the pan before it burned. “What are we having?”
“Sends a better message. She was getting mouthy.” Thompson’s thumb released the safety mechanism and his pointer finger curled around the trigger. “Rather like you.”
“Asphyxiated – her spine appears intact, so it took a while.” He cleared his throat, but soldiered on. “Tongue removed with a short, serrated blade just after death.” John glanced around behind her, taking in the whole picture. “Hands bound – she couldn’t fight back. I’d say, since her clothes all seem to be in place, that there is little chance of sexual assault.” Dark blue eyes finally met Sherlock’s and he nodded slightly, handing the investigation over. He cared so much – how could he do that? He had only met this woman once and yet he was incredibly moved and angered by her death.
“Rosie, listen to your father,” Sherlock said, remarkably calm, standing over John where he knelt in front of the little girl. “You’re going to have a lovely time with Molly and we are going to work.” Sherlock bent down and placed a surprisingly tender kiss on Rosie’s forehead.
. “At the very least, I doubt that the sort of man who keeps careful inventory of his prostitutes is the sort of man who gets his hands dirty.”
He stepped forward and started looking closer, taking a proffered pair of nitrile gloves from D.I. Lestrade. “Dead… five hours, give or take. No signs of injury ‒ no blood or bruising. Poison?” John carefully lifted the glass from the man’s stiff fingers and gave it a bit of a sniff. He shook his head and offered it to Sherlock.
John tried not to laugh. Truly. But he was unsuccessful. An undignified giggle bubbled up from his throat, causing Sherlock's eyebrows to furrow.
“Oh, of course.” Sherlock reached into the inside pocket of his suit jacket and produced a reasonable facsimile of a police badge. John had one, as well – they had been a very secret gift from Greg last Christmas, who was tired of having his own badge stolen and Sherlock throwing his name around like confetti.
It was such a small amount of blood, really, but enough to affirm that Sherlock was really and truly still there. Not a figment of his own imagination.
Sherlock flipped the mobile in the air and caught it with the same hand so that the back was facing upward. “The engraving,” John said.
John laughed. Laughed, a sharp, rude bark of a laugh that bore little humour. “‘Less-than-honourable intentions’?” With another little huff, John dropped his shoes unceremoniously by the door and put his hands on his waist. “You’re concerned for my honour now? Wouldn’t it be a bit more traditional to worry about Miss Sawyer’s honour?”
. He tucked in to his food with gusto and bit back a smirk as Sherlock slowly, almost tentatively, reached for a container of Kung Pao chicken ‒ his favourite. He was being so cautious, no doubt still confused by John’s abrupt appearance at 221B. Good. John liked when Sherlock was surprised, especially by him.
John felt some of Sherlock's hair pop out of their roots, he was gripping so tightly. It felt so marvelous that he was inclined to make Sherlock do it again. So he whipped the crop through the air and brought it down on each of Sherlock's buttocks with unforgiving force. Sherlock groaned harshly before closing his lips and swallowing again, twice.
Sherlock looked as though he were considering one more word, but licked his lips and nodded instead. Turning on his heel, he stalked toward the sofas, found a relatively unoccupied stretch of furniture, and tossed his jacket onto the seat. He held out his hand to take John's coat and when it was carefully deposited on the sofa, Sherlock faced John and placed his hands obediently behind his back.
“The game is on!” Rosie cried out from Sherlock’s arms as they bounded down the stairs and out onto the sidewalk.
It had started in the kitchen. Two days into being Papa, Sherlock was practically high on fatherhood. He carried Rosie everywhere, despite her ability to walk for more than two years. He hummed that frustrating song John had learned in grade seven that listed all the elements (John preferred the original
“I’m a very intelligent man, John.” Sherlock sat in his own chair, elbows on his knees, leaning forward and staring intently at John. “Try me.” The low timbre of his voice made John’s eyes fall shut.
"Sink," Sherlock nodded quickly toward the wash station by the door. Immediately, John spotted a bottle of hand lotion - a necessity when one washed their hands as often as doctors and scientists - and grabbed it up. Dropping the lotion onto the table next to Sherlock, John whipped his belt free from its loops and started on his fly.
The carriage jerked into motion and Watson’s voice drew Sherlock out of his reverie. “That’s quite the interesting suit, Mister Holmes.” Sherlock looked down and quickly compared his own ensemble to Watson’s. He was dressed in his usual clothes ‒ bespoke trousers and suit jacket, his favorite plum-colored shirt, Oxford shoes, and his Belstaff coat. Practically a uniform. Armour.
“I know, love,” John said, putting up a hand. Sherlock fell silent as John straightened his shoulders and drew himself up to his fullest height. Despite his smaller stature, John could be very imposing when he wanted to. Tightening his jaw and narrowing his eyes, John put on his Captain voice. “If you so much as look at my husband again, I will make you regret having drawn breath this morning.” The man took a moment to size John up, then decided against an altercation. He put up his hands in surrender and walked away.
"John?" He blinked and realised that Sherlock had been saying his name several times in an attempt to get his attention. "How long have those soil samples been in with the chemical compound?"
It took longer than usual to get home - it seemed as if the traffic was also enjoying Sherlock's torture. He spent most of the ride with his hand gripped tightly around his jaw, breathing heavily into his palm, his leg bouncing impatiently. Twice, John reached into Sherlock's lap and grasped viciously at his cock, causing him to groan loud enough to make the cabbie blush.
“I suppose that’s when our friend Brook got involved,” Sherlock said. “The fireman said it was Brook who paid him to move the dead body and ‒” he paused for dramatic effect as he reached across the table to grab an official-looking packet of papers, “Brook is on the list of founding members of Janus Enterprises.” He plopped the business formation paperwork in front of John with a satisfied grin.”
Sherlock was instantly incensed, but heard only a blank sort of static in his mind as he attempted to determine why. He and John weren’t… anything. Not anymore. Not ever, really. Just friends with benefits, wasn’t that what young people in his time called it?
John leaned up and planted a kiss at the juncture of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder before saying against his skin, “Should we get back to the case?”
“Hello, brother,” Sherlock slurred. He felt a placid smile roll over his face, but Mycroft did not return it.
“Language,” Rosie chided in perfect Mrs. Hudson intonation and Sherlock huffed in annoyance. Taking up the dice in both of her chubby hands, Rosie tossed them onto the board and moved her token into the billiard room. “Ok! I think it was
John huffed. “You did.” Sherlock’s laugh rumbled through him and soon they were giggling ridiculously, a pile of half-dressed limbs in the drivers seat of a rental car.
“I think you are,” he said softly, placing both hands on Sherlock’s upper arms. His touch had a much-needed grounding effect and Sherlock sighed. Staring wide-eyed into Sherlock’s face, John continued, “I think I’m ‘Daddy’ and you’re –”
“How can I trust you?” Sherlock leaned forward slowly and placed his elbows on his knees, resting his fingertips against his lips in contemplation of his opponent. “One person is already dead and I have yet to determine that
!" He gasped as John wrapped his hand around his erection and gave a firm tug. He swirled his thumb over the head, spreading Sherlock's pre-cum along his shaft. John couldn't help the grin that spread over his face as he reduced Sherlock Holmes to a moaning, gasping, knot of arousal. All for John.
“We’d better get back to work,” John murmured. Sherlock nodded, his forehead brushing against John’s.
Sherlock took a deep breath, uncomfortable and unsure, so John answered for him. “Come by this evening – after the little madam’s gone to bed – and we’ll be happy to share what we know.” With that, he stood and took Rosie’s other hand. Swinging the little girl between them, Sherlock and John left Lestrade’s office and headed out of the police station. Molly had set up a special tea service and medical examination for Rosie and they were on their way to being late.
He’d seen dead bodies before. Plenty of them. More than enough. But it shook him to his core every time.
This left John curious as to which types of music would elicit which types of dancing. So he put together a playlist of songs he liked and songs he thought Sherlock would like and he set about testing Sherlock's hips.
“What?” Sherlock was beyond confused. John’s arousal was evident; pupils dilated, cheeks flushed, erection pressing insistently into Sherlock’s upper thigh.
After about two blocks, a sleek black towncar slowed to a halt and Sherlock threw the door open. He held it and waited for John to get in before sliding in himself. “Mycroft?” John asked, looking about the car’s nondescript interior.
John's own orgasm was building again and he marveled at Sherlock's self-control - he was about to orgasm for the second time in an hour and Sherlock was still holding back. His long, slender length was leaking onto his muscled stomach as John pounded rhythmically into him. At long last, John reached forward to grasp Sherlock's erection in his fist, eliciting a desperate cry, before whispering harshly, "Cum for me, Sherlock. Now."
funny, John,” Sherlock put in, hanging up their coats. He was answered by a stern look from the doctor that definitely told him to
John stopped, now on the stair above Sherlock. His face went through several expressions in rapid sequence, Sherlock soaking up each one.
Sorry, guys! I interviewed for a job I *really* want last week and was supposed to hear a result a few days ago. When I didn't get any word, my anxiety obviously spiraled out of control and I ended up stress-cleaning my house between bouts of crying in my bed and crying in the shower. I've calmed down now - still waiting on a result, but was at least contacted by the powers-that-be so I'm not left hanging. I'll let you guys know if I get the job. I'm sure that's why you come to AO3, right? Job updates?
"Mmm… I did," John mumbled. Then, he laughed when something floated back to the front of his mind. "Some girl convinced Greg to dance with her - Sam Cooke came over the radio - and he was so pissed he tried to give her a twirl and threw her right into the bar!" John devolved into a fit of giggles, bouncing against Sherlock's chest with the force of it.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic, of course you will,” he said. Turning to John, he said, “I imagine Lestrade is on the way.”
“Will that be all?” Sherlock stood impatiently from the chair in front of Lestrade’s desk. The little wobble on his still-sore ankle diminished the effect of this gesture, but Rosie reached up to take his hand and he steadied. “We have places to be.”
. This woman isn’t the guest, she’s a prostitute. John?” Sherlock turned his expectant gaze on the doctor and nodded toward the body. Taking his cue, John knelt down to take a closer look, pulling on a pair of nitrile gloves.
A short chapter, I know, especially given that it's been so long since I've updated. But teaching really takes it out of a person! *Phew* Christmas hols are coming up, though, so hopefully I'll get a chance to write a lot more. Maybe even finish. *fingers crossed* As always, all my love. <3 Diana
Loud, distracting voices shouted from the corridor and Sherlock turned his drowsy gaze toward the sound.
The wet heat of Sherlock's mouth was almost too much - it always was. Sherlock used his mouth for such magnificent deductions and such cutting insults and often for such haughty condescension. It aroused John to no end for Sherlock to expertly use his mouth to suck John's cock. And expertly he did. He hollowed his cheeks and sucked
Running the crop against the other cheek and down to trace Sherlock's full lips, John watched as that long, pale throat swallowed excitedly. With a sharper
Despite the anger that was always simmering just below the surface of Sherlock’s skin, something about Mycroft’s face, familiar and lined with worry, made Sherlock’s heart swell. Mycroft wouldn’t be there if Sherlock weren’t real. If he didn’t care.
His teeth sank into Sherlock's shoulder as he arched impossibly further back into John's embrace. John twisted his firm grip on Sherlock's erection and ran his thumb over the swollen head just before Sherlock came with surprising force. John did not relent, milking Sherlock's erection for all he was worth as his own orgasm bulleted through his body and into his husband.
, Lestrade!” Sherlock snapped. He whipped out his wallet and handed over his Coutts Silk Card. Lestrade’s eyes widened at the sight of it and he reached out as if for the Holy Grail. “Put them all up in a hotel - high security - until the case is settled.”
Father was allergic, but an exception simply had to be made. Sherlock was not coping. And besides, he was going away to boarding school - Father would suffer through holidays and breaks. He was the more sentimental parent, after all. Against Mummy’s wishes and Mycroft’s protestations, along came Redbeard.
Sherlock did not pull away - he had not been instructed to. But he was pressing hard against his straining erection with one hand, fighting his own orgasm with all his might. He had not been instructed to cum, either. John let out a shaky sigh at the sight of him, so obedient, and finally tapped weakly at Sherlock's head. He came away with a filthy wet
Up the stairs to their flat, Sherlock remained as composed as possible, even when John slapped his rear end so hard that it stung his hand. John hung up their coats and gestured casually toward Sherlock's bedroom, keeping his cool despite the fact that the cab ride had revived his erection. Sherlock was trying to keep his head upright, to retain some of his dignity. But when John surreptitiously pressed the remote button once more, sending the vibrations into a rapid and unrelenting pulsation, Sherlock actually fell to his knees.
The next sigh was one of utter annoyance - the nerve of him. But he poured off the couch and onto his feet. Still in his pajamas, he pulled on his peacoat and took Rosie's hand. "
Sherlock wasn’t in the lounge area, so John found a seat that was free of bodies and committed to finishing his drink. Next to him on the sofa was a woman in nothing but a black latex bra, sprawled out with her hands in the hair of a man knelt between her knees. His body was crossed with several leather straps all converging at his cock, which was trapped in a metal cage. He was lapping at the woman’s vagina like a dog, his cock leaking and untouched.
The word sent a jolt straight to John's groin. He breathed heavily through his nose as Sherlock sank to his knees in front of John, keeping their gaze locked. God, this man. John could never find the right word for him. Fantastic. Genius. Incredible. Gorgeous. Miraculous. His.
“I said,” Sherlock repeated firmly, “he’s with me.” A shiver ran down John’s spine at Sherlock’s commanding tone.
A small smile returned to John’s face and Sherlock relaxed at his softened expression. “I believe you will.” He tied off his final stitch and stood back to look Sherlock directly in the eye. “Have you any headache? Any blurry vision or dizziness?”
“Now,” said Sherlock, following the other two men inside, “we establish a social network – other girls in the ring, see if we can find out who the pimp is.”
a clever boy, aren't you?" John ran the pad of his thumb tantalizingly over the button and Sherlock's eyes followed his movements. "You just walk around with a vibrating plug up your arse now, do you?"
“Harry Watson. Clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father; this is a young man’s gadget.
“I fell in the pursuit of an accomplice, an action which need not frighten your foot soldiers as I have yet to see a single one of them give chase.” Sherlock knelt over the body and whipped out his magnifier.
“I’ve got to get out of here,” Sherlock said with a heavy sigh. He couldn’t look at John anymore, couldn’t stand to be in the same space or breathing the same air.
Instead, he stood up, tossing the paper aside and facing off with John from across the sitting room. “I can’t imagine that the sort of woman who practically begs to go out with a man, especially these days, has much in the way of honour about her.”
“Yes.” The answer flew from John’s lips without thought, but as soon as the word escaped him, he knew it was true. “Yes. I need you, too.”
, he thought with a little shake of his head. Somehow, he just knew. Sherlock had slipped these into the drawer, as slick as a thief, on one of his visits.
“That’s quite alright, really,” Sherlock waved away her shock and took his badge back. “Do you mind if we ask you some questions about a co-worker of yours?”
to people like that and not expect them to respond. Look at you!" He gestured up and down Sherlock's body - his sweat-soaked shirt was almost completely transparent against his muscular chest and his trousers were always about a size too small, showing off his magnificent arse and thighs. With his cheeks flushed and his hair even more tousled than usual, John thought he looked ready to be thoroughly debauched.
“He knows our missing person, John. I was just trying to get information out of him - you know how people always respond better when I’m ‘nice’,” Sherlock said this last with an air of disdain.
John grabbed Sherlock roughly by the lapels and threw him against the narrow stretch of wall beside the door with a snarl. “I am so tired of hearing about the bloody Work!” He gave the taller man a violent shake and Sherlock shoved him back, but John’s grip was relentless. “The case is over, Sherlock! What’s your excuse now?”
He placed the tongue of the crop against Sherlock's cheekbone and said, "On your knees." With a sharp
Sherlock's hands were shaking as he undressed as swiftly as possible. John followed suit, watching as Sherlock slipped out of his trousers and pants before crawling onto the bed. He knelt on the duvet, his face down and arse in the air, his hands already digging into the blankets. Now completely naked himself, John ambled onto the bed behind Sherlock and gave the perfect globes of his backside a firm squeeze. John traced his finger from between Sherlock's balls and up to his hole, beautifully stretched by the plug, and pinched the toy between his fingers. With his free hand, he finally relented, pressing the button a fourth and final time, stilling the vibrations and Sherlock nearly sobbed as John slowly removed the plug.
“Excuse me?” It was Captain Watson now, straight-backed and glowering. And if Sherlock were a fool, he would think it laughable that such a small, plain man would be trying to intimidate him. If he were smarter, he would stop.
With a relaxed groan, John leaned back on the sofa, container of lo mein in hand, and pressed play on
). He made breakfast, albeit the toast was a little uneven after being scorched on the Bunsen burner gauze. Generally speaking, Sherlock had been a bouncier, more considerate version of himself than John had ever seen. It was almost unnerving.
started, perched on a barstool and typing at lightening speed on his blog - a post about the different residues left behind by the soles of several popular types of trainers - and his head and shoulders immediately began to sway to the easy piano rhythm. He did type a smidge faster, but other than that, there was no real reaction.
“Michael Stamford,” the man said, drawing Sherlock back from his dangerous thoughts. “Are you a friend of Watson’s?”
of the leather against his cheekbone, John added, "And the correct form of address is 'Captain'." Sherlock's eyes slipped closed; John knew how much it aroused Sherlock when he pulled rank.
“John…” Sherlock moaned as John reached his hands up and twisted his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. He pulled John hard against him and but down on his shoulder, burying his cock impossibly deeper as he came into John’s willing body. As he rode out his own orgasm, Sherlock reached down and took a firm grip on John’s dripping erection. He came with an obscene shout before relaxing his entire body against Sherlock’s.
They were driving when John decided to test Sherlock on classic rock - a personal favorite of John's. He plugged his phone into the auxiliary port in the car's radio as Sherlock merged onto the M4 on their way to Plymouth. Someone had contacted Sherlock from the Royal Citadel when they had found a severed head in one of the cannons and it was at least an Eight.
has decided to refuse her clothes this morning.” Rosie groaned, a temper building on her round face.
Leaning upward, John ran his tongue along Sherlock’s neck, tracing the jumping tendons of his throat. With a heady breath in Sherlock’s ear, he said, “Pull over. Now.”
“No. Air B&B rental – just checked in today.” Sherlock continued his inspection, pulling at the dead woman’s clothing and prodding gently at the deep slash at her throat. His ministrations revealed a second deep gash in her lower abdomen, which he left undisturbed.
“I’d say the killer is left-handed, going by the angle of the slashes on her throat and stomach.” He pulled back the sheet and Lestrade took an awkward step backward as John gently placed his fingers just inside the edge of the wound. “Serrated blade, I think. Rather long, too, but very deliberate cuts…” John trailed off when he noticed something – or rather, something missing. “They’ve removed her uterus.” His eyes met Sherlock’s in disgust. A cold wave of unease washed over John, but Sherlock was as composed as ever, his long fingers drumming the cane as he nodded along with John’s assessment.
“Yes,” Sherlock concurred. “I remember a nearly-identical tattoo on a different woman who also had her throat cut about a year ago, but I chalked it up to the bizarre need that young people feel to be ‘unique’.” He pointed down at the tattoo under John’s thumb and continued, “But they have different numbers – the first girl’s ended in ‘zero-nine’. This one is ends in ‘two-one’.”
“Er…” Sherlock floundered and refused to let his cheeks flush, “wouldn’t you like to get some lunch or something?”
John pressed the crop into Sherlock's shoulder and he came away so that John could sit. He arranged himself on the couch and gave Sherlock an encouraging little tap on the cheek. Sherlock took the hint and practically dove on John's throbbing erection.
each other and share everything and stay with one another no matter how hard it gets because they love one another.” John finally stopped avoiding Sherlock’s gaze and was surprised by how confused he looked.
“John,” he said softly and John’s skin tingled at the almost tender sound of his name on Sherlock’s deep voice. “You have to know that I would never purposefully do anything to harm Rosie. Or you.” This last he said making the most open and sincere eye contact with John he had ever seen on that slim, sharp face. He had a sudden urge to put his hand on Sherlock’s pained face, but he shook it off.
Sherlock made a whining sound as John presses harder against him, their still-clothed cocks brushing against one another. But he protested no more. In fact, he lifted his hips slightly so that John could hook his fingers in the band of his trousers and pants and free his cock completely. “What if someone comes in?” Sherlock breathed out.
"Cocktease." Another bubbling laugh fell from his lips, but Sherlock waved it off as he spun around the cabinets.
been attractive, until her killer had sliced out her tongue and tucked it into the top pocket of her blouse. It was lucky for Lestrade and his investigators that Sherlock not only had a good memory for faces, but enough of an imagination to recognise the woman, even after her features had bloated and swollen with the affects of asphyxiation and burst capillaries. It was Julia – or, as she had confided to John, Mary.
"How dare you?" the detective accused with absolutely no more annoyance in his voice. John grinned and took hold of the steaming mug in Sherlock's hand. Placing the cup on the table behind him, John took up Sherlock's warm hand in his own and stood up straight. He began to move his feet ever-so-slightly, forcing Sherlock to sway with him in the kitchen. "What are you doing?"
Got to be friends first, came that snide inner voice that he had not heard in several weeks. Sherlock realised he was sneering at the woman’s back and swallowed his expression, affecting an air of curious nonchalance as John looked up and saw him.
“Jealous?” Indignation dripped from Sherlock’s voice and his expression twisted into a sneer. He strode forward and came between John and the hallway. “Jealous of you?”
"I thought you might enjoy it, Captain," Sherlock purred, a grin starting to slide over his face. "I knew we'd be coming here."
! You must know him - his music, I mean." Finally managing to find his music app, John pulled up an old favourite. "He's
As he observed, Sherlock noticed Watson rest his cane against a cabinet and move unencumbered around the room.
“Hey, he came on to me - he wanted it,” the man said forcefully, stepping closer to tower over John. He did not back down.
!" John was disgusted. Outright affronted. He rolled his eyes and pulled his phone from his pocket with some difficulty, it seeming to have become very attached to the lining. "How can you be so smart and so dumb all at once?"
“Good. Then I can resume my pursuit.” Sherlock put a hand on the ground and made to get up, but John would not release his ankle.
Sherlock instantly took a step behind John as he faced off with the stranger. “What the fuck are you doing?”
John heaved a heavy sigh and turned back toward the stairs. “I wish she’d stop doing that,” he muttered.
It was a struggle to get his eyes to focus - they were moving out of rhythm with his thoughts. But finally, Sherlock’s head lolled drunkenly to the side and Mycroft swam into view. He was upside down.
"Whiskey neat," John shouted over the thumping music. She smiled and proceeded to pour his drink and John placed the photo on the counter. "Tell me, have you seen this man anytime recently?"
by Led Zeppelin began to play, the heavy bass and rough guitar notes vibrated through the car. Sherlock’s long fingers reached up and under John’s shirt, nails grazing his nipples and extracting a moan from the doctor in his lap. He gripped John’s shoulders and pulled him backward to lay back to chest.
“Oh, please. This isn’t about what you deserve. This is about you wanting something warm to stick your cock into. And now that I’m not a sure thing anymore, you’ll go out and find the first cunt that smiles at you.”
So many thanks to Anyawen for their genius suggestion of wooden chopsticks and Bond movie nights. I doubt I would have been able to move forward with this little story for quite some time without Anyawen's help. All my love! <3 Diana

-ed and he fished it from the pocket of his jacket, which was hanging by the door. "I agree. Whole-heartedly." He glanced down and read the text from Molly.
Eurus had said that they never had a dog, but that wasn’t exactly true. She was already gone - she hadn’t known Redbeard. And Sherlock had been all-too-keen to forget her after what she did. Truly, he hadn’t intended to forget her so entirely, but Mycroft had latched onto the notion and ensured it “for Sherlock’s own good”. He had done the same when Redbeard had fallen ill.
kissing Sherlock. Sherlock, whose hands made their way just inside the collar of John’s plaid shirt and were teasing at his buttons…
"Oh, for-" Sherlock bit off an oath of frustration and suddenly changed their grip. He took up John's right hand and put his other arm around the doctor's waist and took the lead. This caused John to giggle again as Sherlock began to dance John toward the sitting room where there was more space.
“F-fuck,” Sherlock hissed, his head lolling back against the wallpaper before he dragged John’s mouth back up to meet his again. He took John’s bottom lip between his teeth, let John’s tongue slide into his mouth before hollowing his cheeks and sucking. Sherlock was rapidly forming a plan: drop to his knees, get John’s cock into his mouth, finger himself while he was down there so John could get inside him as soon as possible. Against the wall, or over the arm of the sofa ‒ yes, that would be better…
"What's this we're doing?" John asked, his head feeling pleasantly swimmy again as Sherlock led him in the steps. Back with the right, back with the left, step to the right, together.
Over an hour later, the car pulled to a stop in Whitechapel and Julia slid out onto the sidewalk. No sooner had she exited the vehicle did Sherlock retract his hand and his affectionate behaviour. John got out behind Julia to speak to her before she got too far down the street. “Hey – thanks so much for your help.”
“’Partners’?” John chuffed, pushing past Sherlock to exit the small foyer. “You don’t usually call me your partner. Your blogger. Occasionally your friend. And since you started watching
Sherlock took Rosie for himself and wrapped her in her dark blue peacoat – a remarkable likeness to his own – as John slipped into his favourite green jacket. Grabbing up his rucksack with medical and toddler supplies, John said, “Alright, let’s go.”
“You’ve done it before.” Her eyebrows arched defiantly as she crossed her arms, not backing down from Sherlock’s growing fury.
Laying her down on the soft mattress and wrapping her blankets around her, Sherlock leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. She was already so close to sleep, her eyes having drooped shut as the bouncing of his steps lulled her, but she opened her mouth and said around a yawn, “Good night, Papa.”
“Close your mouth, John,” Sherlock said casually over the thumping music. “You look like a surprised carp.”
"What is it?" John stilled his grinding hips and reaching fingers, but continued nuzzling Sherlock's neck in a way they both liked.
The man standing opposite the well-decorated flat had a very casual affect as he pointed a gun at Sherlock.
“Somewhere else,” he said curtly. “Don’t follow me.” The door slammed violently behind him as he fled the place that had once been such a comfort.
“Watch it,” John cut off Sherlock’s insult as he dropped his rucksack from his shoulder, still keeping a hold on the swelling ankle in his hand. He pulled open the drawstring bag and extracted a wrapping bandage. After – well, after Mary – John had started carrying basic medical supplies on their cases. Sherlock was very accident prone and John couldn’t believe how long it had taken him to start being prepared.
"Sorry - no classical today," John said, grabbing up a textbook from a shelf and flipping through, looking for anything new in the world of medical science.
“Isn’t it, just?” The look on John’s face clearly indicated that he hoped she would be far more brazen in the future. “I told her I’d call on her this evening, actually. There’s a dancehall in Clerkenwell that’s meant to be a great time ‒ I wonder if she’d like that…”
Also, I should probably mention the unbelievable inspiration that is illwick's "Unwind" series here on AO3. While nothing I write is an intense in regard to a BDSM relationship, I am constantly enthralled by their deep, inward characterisation of John and Sherlock both. I couldn't recommend this series any more highly. The detail involved regarding John's journey to come to terms with his sexuality, as well as Sherlock's storied past, is definitely in the back of my mind when I write this story. I hope that if illwick ever reads this comment, they will regard this as the compliment for which it is intended.
But Watson was far more formal by comparison. His tweed suit included a vest into which his necktie was neatly tucked. The chain of his pocket watch was pinned to one of his vest buttons and Sherlock even noticed a pocket square which coordinated in color with his tie. His heavy wool coat was several inches longer than Sherlock’s and the Derby hat he now held in his gloved hand even had a small arrangement of feathers in the band. The ensemble suited him, but was far more elaborate and far less fitted than Sherlock’s own.
“Watson, my good man!” A portly man in a brown suit ‒ simpler than Dr. Watson’s but still more elaborate than Sherlock’s ‒ greeted them warmly. He had a rosey face and thin, round glasses that only accentuated the spherical shape of his face. “And who’s this, then?” The man held out a hand to Sherlock, who took it briefly.
“Obviously.” There was such pain on his face – it was a rare sight, but John of all people could recognize it. John adjusted his grip on Sherlock’s arms, giving him a quick, comforting brush of the sleeves and nodded slightly, asking him to continue. “
“John,” he said, his tone very insistent, “you are the best father – the best man – Rosie could ever ask for.” John hated when people said things like that to him. If only they knew – knew how angry he felt sometimes, that Mary was gone, what she had done; how the world looked at him and saw such a small, quiet doctor; how much he
Later that evening, when Sherlock was spread out on the sofa in his classic thinking pose - head barely propped up, fingers steepled under his chin, lips pursed - John decided to test Sherlock's liking of David Bowie again. On a low volume, he queued up
“Well of course she has, John,” Sherlock replied impatiently. “You’ve got the mouse jumper with the elephant leggings. Rodents and pachyderms do not mix – or don’t you watch cartoons?” At his matter-of-fact tone, John turned his gaze slowly on Sherlock in awe. The detective was nearly bouncing with energy, anxious to get a move on, oblivious to the absurdity of this revelation.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, jumping on the thought, “yes it is. What sort of ethnic food is available around here?”
John grinned crookedly at his husband, so cool and collected, as he redid his own trousers and grabbed his jumper from the floor. "Sorry about your experiment," John said. "And your shirt."
“No, no – just a, ah, a sale at Waterstone’s. Much more my speed.” John pocketed his mobile and resumed leading the way. “I’ve got a car waiting on the corner.”
“She threw herself at you!” Sherlock said indignantly. “Asking you to take her out to dinner on the same day that you run into each other.”
at the head before dancing his tongue down the shaft. His tongue slipped out to lap at John's balls, pressing between his testicles to apply a divinely-sinful pressure at the very base of John's erection.
Silently, Sherlock reached out and slammed the door shut before John even had time to be embarrassed. Taking a steadying breath, John squared his shoulders and marched into the store. He had
, Sherlock." Then, as Sherlock licked his way back up his cock, John found his grip on the handle of the crop again. He raised it up and brought it swiftly down on Sherlock's left arse cheek with a satisfying
Sherlock spoke in that “you’re an idiot tone” as he continued to inspect the body before him, “People like you have no imagination.”
"Of course." Sherlock stopped set down his kitchen timer (ensuring that his second batch of soil samples wouldn't be ruined) and looked sincerely up at John from his perch on the metal stool. "'You're the fear, I don't care, 'cause I've never been so high'," he recited. "'I'll let you set the pace 'cause I'm not thinking straight'. That's me for you, John."
“Sherlock?” Lestrade’s voice interrupted John’s steadily-dirtying thoughts and they both turned to look at the Detective Inspector with thinly-veiled annoyance.
He leaned back on the sofa and brought Sherlock's mouth back down onto his cock. Sherlock relaxed his throat until John's unforgiving length was fully-seated in that wet heat again. John held him down for a moment until Sherlock's throat began to convulse and his spit fell languidly around John's shaft. Vibrations from Sherlock's moans, the plug, the heavy music, all converged on John's erection and it was glorious. His grip tightened in Sherlock's hair and he began to thrust.
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open. His pulse was accelerated and his eyes were blown wide in the semi-darkness. She called John ‘Daddy’ – always had, never varied.
“Course not – upstanding military gent, in my opinion.” John tickled Rosie, eliciting a stream of loud giggles. Sherlock
They weren’t the cheap, peeling bamboo that came with a takeaway order. Instead, the bottom was made of a darker, sturdier wood ‒ cherry, maybe? And the wider tips were made of some sort of metal. Probably titanium. They were encased in a sleek leather sleeve and felt completely, unnecessarily, luxurious. The most notable feature, however, was that the metal handles had been engraved.
I won’t be able to sleep without them.” Rosie nodded and bent her head forward obediently. He kissed her on the forehead, then tilted so she could do the same to him, before he kissed her little pink lips. “I love you. Have fun with Aunt Molly.”
"I don't think I will," said Sherlock pompously. He spun around and made toward the kitchen, no doubt intent on making an angry cup of tea.
“Oh, I get the fancy treatment, then?” They smiled together and John was amazed at the ease he felt around her. But then, he supposed, that was her job. She was rather… well, rather classier than he had expected. He’d never solicited a prostitute before but he had encountered his fair share working with Sherlock and the Yard and they were never so sweet and healthy-looking. They reached the car and John opened the door for Julia and she slid smoothly inside before John heard her exclaim at the sight of Sherlock in the car. “What’s going on? Who are you?”
“No,” he answered. “Identical drinks, identical poisons. One killer, two targets, only one victim,” Sherlock recited. “The ice. The ice was poisoned and set aside for these two men. Dodds had three drinks, went through them rather quickly, too, I’d imagine. No time for the ice to melt. Crewe, however, nursed his one drink for a couple of hours and drank not only the whiskey, but the poisoned ice water mixed in. Dodds left the ice in his glass, which has since melted, and now presents a slight scent of garlic where Crewe’s does not.”
Standing with a slight grimace, Sherlock redressed and ran his fingers through his hair, smoothing out his appearance. He licked his lips, swallowed slowly, and blew out a breath through pursed lips. The Detective was back.
So, I know you guys are all *dying* to know (wishful thinking, much?) -- but I GOT THE JOB!! I'm so excited and now that my anxiety has lifted, I can write again! I'm so relieved! I've just been typing like crazy and have even outlined my next novel-length fic. Johnlock, obviously. Johnlock + Exit to Eden = smutty, smut smut. Woo!
“I come home from the surgery to an empty house – Mrs. Hudson doesn’t have Rosie, you’re not here, what am I supposed to do but panic?” John rationalised. Of course, it was ridiculous. He was supposed to assume that Sherlock would take care of her.
, but neither did he reject it as he had the earlier music of the Beatles. John let it play out, nodding his head and singing under his breath. God, what a great song. He continued to drive in relative stillness through
“Don’t sell yourself so short.” John carefully removed Sherlock’s leather Oxford shoe and dress sock before beginning to wrap his ankle tightly. “You’ll find another clue in no time.”
I'm so sorry this chapter is late -- or maybe it isn't, at this point. I always have an aim of posting on Sundays, but I have a feeling it's been more Mondays and Tuesdays than I've realised. But, we got some news yesterday that could potentially be completely life-changing and absolutely AMAZING, so I've been a little distracted. Can't say more about it, but keep your fingers crossed and if it all goes off according to plan, I'll gladly share the news.
She was already in her pyjamas after her bath – it was Thursday, so that meant the whale-print jammies – so Sherlock put her straight in her crib. She was getting a little big for it now; soon she’d have to move into a toddler bed. Sherlock had actually found one online that would expand into a full-sized twin as she grew, which seemed the most practical option. But he had ordered the one shaped like a pirate ship. It was only one size, but Rosie would prefer it. And so would Sherlock.
"Sherlock, I don't care about your ridiculous French laziness right now. I need you to get Rosie to school," he said firmly.
John was left staring at the open doorway, his own coat in his hand. What on earth…? Sherlock only occasionally spoke French when he wasn't speaking to a French person. Sometimes he did it when they were having sex and John found it incredibly erotic. But this was different - as if he couldn't be bothered to speak English today.
“Let’s be quick about it. I’ll take the left, you go around the right and we’ll meet back up at those sofas in the back.” Sherlock straightened his shoulders and his suit jacket before taking off into the crowd.
“We’re from the War Office,” the second man ground out, his cheek pressed against the floor and John’s revolver pressed against the back of his head. “We’re looking for Irene Adler.”
“We were at the Yard,” he answered slowly. “Lestrade phoned about the case and we went to see him about it.”
of laughter against Sherlock’s mouth, but slid his arms up Sherlock’s sides to wrap around his back and deepened their kiss. Tongues swirling and teeth clashing, the two of them surged closer to one another, breathing heavily through their noses. John ran his left hand down over Sherlock’s hip to grip his buttock and leaned them to the side, pressing Sherlock onto his back on the sofa.
“The truth is, Sherlock,” he said softly, “that I haven’t done anything to earn you, either. But I will.” He nodded gently at Sherlock, trying to reassure him that this was, in fact, a momentary aberration. John reached forward and squeezed Sherlock’s long, bony fingers in his own before saying, “Just… text me next time. Okay?” Sherlock nodded.
John’s eyebrows climbed nearly up to his hairline as he stared at the darkened neon signs which read, “Adult Video ‒ Peep Show.”
"Jesus, Sherlock," John slurred as he swiftly shucked his jumper. He pressed his trousers down around his thighs and took a handful of lotion for himself. Wrapping a hand around his erection, John's head lolled back at the sensation, the anticipation. He forced his gaze back to Sherlock and choked out a grunt when he saw that he had added a third finger.
“Well, I have no evidence to suggest otherwise.” Sherlock gestured blandly down at his cards and Rosie stood in John’s chair to see them better across the coffee table. There lie Colonel Mustard, the dagger, and the conservatory.
He was too loud, so John clapped his free hand over Sherlock's mouth, stifling his eager cries. "Sshh," John hissed into his ear, "someone will hear you." Sherlock's lips fell open at the thought and he greedily sucked John's fingers into his mouth. John delved his fingers deeper as he took his first thrust, hard and deep, and had to bite down on Sherlock's shoulder to silence his own shouts of pleasure.
The morning had started pleasantly enough. He'd risen before anyone else, gotten a shower while the water was still hot, and put on some bouncy music at a low volume while he folded bath towels. Then all Hell had broken loose.
“Not since Rosie came here.” Sherlock’s voice was so firm and clipped that John actually jumped a little. Not in all that time? Truly? Not even a little?
They didn’t seem to hear him. The girl on the mattress opposite him stretched and her foot nudged against Sherlock’s. She was crying.
Phew! I hate that I missed a week, but better late than never. I really wanted this chapter to get dirty, but it takes a lot of story space to set up the next "episode". Maybe I'll get two chapters this week...
“Very good, John,” Sherlock nodded, his smile returning. John tried not to beam. He spun around to say to Lestrade, “We need to speak with the bartender.” Sherlock snatched up the second glass and sniffed at its meagre contents. “Was this Dodds’ glass?”
Leaning down, John started with one small lick, barely a brush of his tongue against Sherlock’s tip, and was rewarded with a stuttering breath from above him. His eyes were fixed ahead of him, but Sherlock was struggling to focus. John smirked and took him in even further, his hand working at the base.
him move like that, when they were naked and in bed, but had never watched from a distance.  Sherlock was practically straddling the stranger's muscular thigh as his hips rolled in rhythm with the music. He had removed his jacket and his crisp white dress shirt was clinging to his muscular chest with sweat. He was gorgeous and completely enthralling. In all of John's days he would never have imagined seeing Sherlock Holmes, the poshest man he knew, grinding in a dark nightclub.
"I don't really play. Not anymore," John answered. "Clarinet wasn't cool enough for the girls in grade eight, so I started learning the guitar."
John’s entire body tensed as he listened. Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly as he observed John before their gazes met in the pale silver light of the moon.
The dramatic detective was, by this time, spread full-length on the sofa, his nicotine-free electronic cigarette drooping listlessly between two of his long fingers. He was staring up at the ceiling, sighing heavily, and did not look at John when he spoke.
So, given that this chapter is a few days late, I wish that it were longer. But it's Christmas and family is crazy so it's a miracle I've been able to complete a chapter at all. That being said, I still managed to write another little something-something just for Christmas, but that's ADHD for you. Just can't stick to one thing at a time.
"You're welcome," John replied, finding himself staring at Sherlock. He had put on weight - that was funny. Just a pound or two, but right in the tummy. That would be the result of Rosie's baking lessons with Molly. Sherlock was always eager to critique her latest creation, which made John happy because parenthood had not repaired Sherlock's incredibly uneven eating schedule and food was food.
