it. I know it sounds pathetic, dull even… stupid sentiment. But that’s how I feel, John. When you were dying in my arms, I was dying along with you, because I thought I am going to lose you forever and I simply can’t imagine my life without you, John, I-“
, just please... please don’t pursue me, John,“ he requested, disappearing before giving John another chance to stop him.
“Relax. We’re doing fine,” Sherlock replies, pressing the button with the number twelve on it. “I think.”
“How-how am I supposed to live with this memory of you almost dying because of me?“ he asked under his breath. “John… I still don’t understand, God, why did you do it?“
Whenever he wore a shirt unbuttoned almost half the way down, exposing his pale, milky-skinned neck, John couldn’t help but
“You can’t be serious,“ John gasped, crossing his arms. Sherlock could hear him approaching but he remained standing still, paralysed in one spot, almost as if he was too afraid to turn around and look John in the eyes. But then John uttered his name, once, twice, a mere whisper, his warm, sooth voice piercing through the ice cold façade Sherlock wore in order to give away none of his true emotions. Sherlock had hoped that this time they’d manage to avoid leading such intimate, tedious conversations but judging from how John hesitated to speak, shuffling his feet and clearing his throat so awkwardly, it was quite obvious where all of it was going.
There Sherlock saw himself, vividly, like a hallucination. A little boy with an eye-patch and his brother, both laughing heartily as they’d ran through a golden wheat field, poking each other with their wooden swords. Mycroft’s voice resounded in Sherlock’s head, a voice that hadn’t belonged to either of those boys. A voice that had warned him, but Sherlock hadn’t been listening.
John sighs at those words, realising there might as well be no use in keeping up a facade, not when Sherlock sees right through him. “I just thought I was doing fine already,“ he runs a hand down his face. “I mean, as soon as we left the flat at least... I felt much less afraid I had thought I would. I thought it was going to be easier.“
“W-well,“ Sherlock cleared his throat, nearly out of breath by the time John shortened the distance between their faces, leaving only a couple of inches between their lips. Sherlock felt his cheeks burning, he was glad for the light in the room being so dim so John couldn’t notice. At least he thought John couldn’t.
my whole life to prove me wrong. What I’ve realised is… loving you has never made me weaker, it made me stronger, John. It took me years, but I understand now, thanks to you. Falling in love with you, that wasn’t a mistake, I know now, but being afraid of accepting it, that
, John, is the most cunning enemy,“ Sherlock added, ignoring John's stunned face. “It’s able to control you, to exploit you, making you do and say things you’d never commit otherwise. Never
There's robotic-like screeching coming from the other side then after a few seconds, a distorted, creepy version of a nursery rhyme plays.
John, gazing up at him, profoundly worried. Sherlock's pale, looks troubled, almost upset, failing to hide it.
to help that baby as much as I can, just not the way you expect me to. It’s for her own good, she doesn’t deserve such an awful life, at all. First of all, this little girl needs her
“John, I am sure you have questions,“ Sherlock said in his desperate attempt to have the old curious John back. “I am willing to answer
However, the consequences, the realisation of what they both actually admitted to feel, all weighted heavily on him with a ridiculous delay. It wasn’t until days later, now in the moment Sherlock offered him his own bedroom, it wasn’t until now that John’s mind finally clicked. It was a sluggish, tedious process but he had to admit it in the end. They were moving further, in yet undiscovered direction. The mere possibility turned John’s brain into mush. He tried to put the rest of the puzzle pieces together, but soon Sherlock’s voice once again pulled him out of this sort of emotional trance.
Walks to the kitchen, puts the bags on the table. Seems distracted, his eyes keep going to Sherlock's empty armchair.
, his own actions and the words he willingly said. Never before he so carelessly worn his heart on his sleeve. Reminding himself of the fact that he reached for Sherlock’s hand in public hit him all of a sudden, with full devastating force, mentally kicking out the breath of his lungs. Then again, Sherlock was the first one to take this step, he would now probably deny it, but it was
He dithers for a split second, then bends over Sherlock, grabs the duvet and ever so gingerly pulls it over him again. And just like that, a small loving smile starts to spread across his lips. He can't help it. Nor he can help brushing the few errant strands of curls off Sherlock's forehead.
John quirks an eyebrow. Is Sherlock teasing him now? Better make sure, John decides. Mirroring Sherlock, he leans across the table, his voice descending into a husky whisper. “Are you
“Did you just-“ Sherlock gasped, blinking and opening his mouth like a confused little boy who’s just seen a magic trick for the very first time.
don’t want to do this, then I’ll put this thing back into the drawer and we can just forget about it. Just tell me what you want, okay?“
“You’re right, I don’t feel like it.“ John’s voice was a little harsh. He turned his face away from Sherlock and for a couple of seconds he was just glaring up at the ceiling.
“Do you... want to stop?” Sherlock asks after a moment of heavy silence, but his voice cracks at the last word, refusing to cooperate any further. Seeking hope and reassurance, he gazes deep into John's eyes, begging not to be rejected. Begging to be kissed again.
John striding down the empty hospital corridor. At the door, that lead to Sherlock's ward, he barely comes to a halt. Throws open the door, practically hurtles inside...
Instead on the obnoxious buzzing, that’s been pestering the man for a couple of minutes already, he tried to focus on the stain of liquor he’s been analysing, but the noises were rather difficult to ignore, it was actually impossible to concentrate under such circumstances. Sherlock couldn’t even properly adjust the microscope while his phone was so annoyingly vibrating on the table, peeping every few seconds. Phone Sherlock so recklessly placed in the bosom of ampoules, tubes, pipettes and flasks full of undefinable chemical compounds.
“Wha-what are you talking about, John? She’s the mother of your child, your wife, she’s... she’s - you
“To be fair, it’s not even a question per se. I am just a little bewildered to be honest. John, when Mary asked you to choose between the two of us…
, where their love was born and resides ever since, it’s where John, finally, after all this time, locks their lips for the very first time. The first touch of his lips comes tender, like a petal floating on the top of the water, silky soft and playful like the snowflakes fluttering from the sky. John's lips are pliant and delicate, treating Sherlock's with utmost love and care. Sherlock’s whole body shivers as he melts into the kiss, a moment such beautiful and magical he knows he will remember the feeling forever. It shall be his most precious memory, he decides, a gem that needs to be protected at all cost. He will remember John’s fingers curling around his hips, their hearts syncing to beat in unison, but above all he will remember the first taste of John’s lips. Taste like no other, sweet like honey, enticing, clouding all of Sherlock’s senses. This must be how true love tastes like, Sherlock, feels.
John shakes his head, but he allows himself a smile and a giggle. It would be so much easier if Sherlock simply deduced that John's in love with him, but for some inexplicable reason, Sherlock either can't or doesn't want to see it. John doesn't dare to hope anymore that Sherlock could reciprocate his love, but he's reached the point when he
“Well, John,“ Sherlock started, his cheeks turning pink again. He spoke slowly, carefully picking out each single word. “Since you’ve already confessed to me, I think it’s time to ask ourselves -oh God, this is difficult-where are we… heading with our relationship?“
“Well, she’s your wife, she’s got every right to know why you haven’t spent a night at home,“ Sherlock pointed out. “What if it’s important?“
, please, you are extremely good at it. Even if you would finally find her one day, what would happen? You think she wouldn’t be prepared? You said she knows that you are trying to get to her. Sherlock, please, I am asking you one last time - give up on pursuing her, forget about this… revenge or whatever it is that’s driving you right into the devil’s snare, hm?“
,“ he yawned, sitting up so he could stretch and relax his muscles. Whether he realised that his feet had been pressed against the small of Sherlock’s back or not, he didn’t shuffle away.
John's eyebrows fly impossibly high. He blinks at Sherlock, lost for words... Clearly, he misunderstood. “Oh,
-“ Sherlock let out another growl, rough and husky, sneaking his arms around John’s shoulders so he could pull him into another messy, passionate kiss.
“We need your help,“ John uttered quickly, noticing how Sherlock opened is mouth to deliver another witty line. Besides, it would take him forever to admit that he was in need of his brother’s helping hand again.
.“ John finally brought himself to clasp a hand over Sherlock’s keep jabbering mouth. Sherlock kept on staring at the other man, blinking in rapid motion as if he couldn’t quite comprehend why John decided to shush him like this.
On the door, as it opens. Sherlock enters the room, John right behind him. Neither of them is wearing a coat anymore.
“Slower?“ John tilted his head, releasing Sherlock’s fingers with a sloppy pop, proceeding to leave small chaste kisses over each of his knuckles instead.
On Lestrade sitting behind his desk, his face buried in his hands, looking extremely worn out. He lets out a heavy sigh.
“It-it feels good, you know, saying that out loud. Finally,“ John sighed contentedly. “Bloody hell, Sherlock, I couldn’t be happier right now. I am so proud of both of us, I love you and you, my God, love
“If I did… I-I wouldn’t let you,“ Sherlock gasped once John pressed his body against him, holding him steadily by his hips.
then, I - It wasn’t particularly difficult to get the dates right,“ John admitted, crumpling the edge of the blanket. “I’ve had my doubts ever since the beginning, I haven’t been paying much attention to them at first, but - but then… then it turned out that my wife was in fact a cold-blooded assassin and quite a malicious liar so I couldn’t just let go off those suspicions. I am almost sure that I can in
He reaches for another strawberry, drawing it across the seam of Sherlock’s lips, leaning in, in the same time so to lick a stripe down and back up Sherlock’s neck and across his jawline, kissing and nipping the pale skin as gently and cautiously as possible.
. Beautiful.“ With that John lifted his eyes, gazing at Sherlock so intently, so fondly so Sherlock’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest, hammering hard, louder than the music itself.
“That doesn’t count,“ Sherlock objected, sadly shaking his head, knowing exactly what John was about to remind him of. “No kiss I’ve ever received or gave ever counted, not least any I’ve received from
Yes. No more crime-solving. No more people pointing their guns at you. We can buy a cottage somewhere in the country, have a dog, perhaps. Lead a mundane, ordinary life. I could keep bees, you could write a book.
like,“ John growled, leaning closer so no pedestrian could overhear what he was about to say. “Not sure what you’ve heard about him, but I can assure you that none of it is true. He’s neither a prick, nor arrogant, nor my-“ John’s voice halted all of a sudden, as if the words refused to leave his throat despite being absolutely true. It was simple: he
Several minutes later, however, John kind of begins to regret that he has. Just the thought of Sherlock all by himself somewhere nice and hot with swimming pools and cocktails, surrounded by dozens of scarcely dressed, tanned people, every day for a whole damn week, people that will undoubtedly
Once fully perceiving, Sherlock realised that John was now standing close and glaring a little worryingly at him. He certainly didn’t want to burden the man with anymore troubles, so rather than admitting that his mind has been toying with him, Sherlock quickly turned the question against him.
“Al-alright then.“ The nurse seemed anything but over the moon that she had to retreat like this but then she finally let them pass, eyes sternly pierced upon them when she walked away.
“Well, err... we’re in Spain. Staying at the hotel the whole time would be like going to Paris and not visiting the Eiffel Tower.”
exactly,“ Sherlock breathed out, his head falling back so John had even a better access. The sensation of John’s lips, teeth and tongue against his skin was simply ecstatic. Sherlock was slowly losing his inhibitions, starting the moment when John moaned quietly and buried both his hands into Sherlock’s hair so he could get a grip of those locks. It was a gentle tug yet Sherlock groaned out loud, a sound so painfully hot, yet the only notion crossing John’s mind was if it didn’t hurt.
Sherlock didn’t, of course he didn’t. He had already learnt his lesson. At the moment, however, chasing John away sounded like the best possible decision he could make. Sherlock yearned to allow John in, allow him to help, he craved for John the way he’d never craved for anyone, not even a drug, but admitting it in that very moment would be a ridiculously foolish move, Sherlock thought. He wished he could pour his heart out and recount the entire truth but the truth was horrendous, mortifying, tying Sherlock’s hands. Breaking everything to John, admitting how weak and hopeless he in fact was Sherlock considered a failure he still couldn’t risk to undergo. And yet he didn’t say those words aloud again, he loathed the lie they represented so he stayed quiet in hope that John would eventually decide to leave on his own. All in vain. Because John was persistent, he seemed to be determined to take care of Sherlock, even if it had to be the last thing he’d ever do.
. But I am not afraid of confessing any more. Love is... strength, it is, it’s beautiful, it’s pure, it’s the force that pushes you forward no matter what, it’s something... something I thought I didn’t deserve, but… it wasn’t true. People were wrong,
He was gazing at the phone in his hands, his fingers hovering haltingly in the air as he wondered what words to type. Sherlock hasn’t seen Mary for about a month, not since the day the plane he was sitting in turned around and landed back on the ground, the day Sherlock escaped what should’ve been his last flight. Once Sherlock walked down the stairs they exchanged few glances and fake glittering smiles, but then he got into the car along with Mycroft and hasn’t talk to her ever since, for until now at least.
“Thank you,“ he whispers, sheepishly, trying hard to not think about how their fingers brushed the moment Sherlock handed him the cup.
John smiles again, failing at hiding how much Sherlock's words affect him. “As flattering as that sounds, Sherlock,“ he says, blushing faintly, “you’re already doing more than enough. A cup of tea whenever you deduce I need one, breakfast each morning, keeping an eye on me each night to make sure I sleep well - yes, I know you do that, don’t give me that
Mrs. Merrilow leads Sherlock and John upstairs, then down a tight, narrow corridor. They stop in front of an old, vintage looking door.
“What are you doing? It’s not very nice to keep me waiting here when my pants are getting so uncomfortable, John.“
But then he felt a touch. Gentle, tender brush of someone’s thumb over his hand and all of a sudden the room around him was filled with no blackness but bright almost blinding light. Sherlock’s eyes were shut as soon as he opened them, pulsating pain in his head has returned and with such force that leaving his eyes open hurt in a really no negligible way. He still couldn’t even orientate himself in the space, for a second he thought he was at Baker Street but no, this room smelled too much of cleanliness, medicines and infirmary.
Sherlock seemed to froze upon hearing those words, his eyes glassy, full of tears and lips wobbling in shock. The mere sight sent shivers down John’s spine. He was convinced that he had just made the biggest mistake of his life, his left fist clenching and unclenching frantically as the result.
Sherlock’s stomach tied in knots upon remembering those words. Why would John say that? Sherlock couldn’t quite comprehend the meaning behind those simple syllables, not even after scrutinizing each of them to detail. Not even the notion of John sacrificing himself made it any clearer, not the open love in his eyes, Sherlock saw it, but couldn’t understand it. He was still groping in the dark like a blind man, like there was nothing to read in between the lines.
. I can’t let anyone stop me from living my life the way I want to. And the truth is, what I want... is to move on from hiding like a coward,“ John admits, his voice somewhat hoarse with emotion. “I’ve spent far too much time crying and complaining. I can’t spend the rest of my life like that, can I?“
Give you a chance? You harmed Sherlock, you've lied to me about who you were. You faked pregnancy, for God's sake, you worked for the man who'd made Sherlock fake his death... What do you expect from me? Forgiveness?
“Yes, I want you, John, I want you-“ Sherlock rolled his hips again, moaning into John’s open mouth, too preoccupied to notice that John withdrew both his hands, rushing to pick one of the bottles from the shelf.
, Sherlock?“ John purred, murmuring the words against Sherlock’s neck. He licked up across Sherlock’s jawline and up toward his ear, suckling ever so gently beneath it before locking their lips again, chaste pecks that soon turned into a lingering, naughty kiss, punctuated with needy moans and filthy profanities.
The silence that just fell into the space was too heavy for both of them to handle it calmly. Sherlock wanted to spit out the truth but it was just a huff of shaky breath he let out of his mouth instead of words. And John’s been raging. Just an idea of him being left out of everything again was making him want to punch the wall so hard his knuckles would bleed.
John starts slowly, giving Sherlock a couple of long, firm strokes at first, sucking and lapping only at the head of his cock. Sherlock would usually guide him, urge him, but this time he’s allowing John to choose the pace so he can fully indulge in the feeling, so each swirl of John’s tongue, each brush of his lips he can savour in a completely new, different way. If he could look he would not pay attention to anything but the mere sight in front of him, it would be over fast but now he can only listen and feel and God, how he’s getting lost in the cacophony of noises John’s making. Gravelly, raw moans vibrating almost roughly around Sherlock’s cock, utterly in contrast with how softly is John stroking Sherlock’s thigh, how gently he’s massaging his balls to achieve maximum pleasure.
This time it should be a tad more needy and passionate - John grabs Sherlock by his waist and pulls him closer; Sherlock walks them closer to the bed-
I ruined it,“ John sighed at last, shutting the door behind him with much more force he had intended to.
John can feel his heart skipping a beat. It’s all he needs to hear. Still smiling, he lifts Sherlock’s hand to his lips and ever so tenderly kisses his knuckles.
But John’s frown only deepens in his confusion. “How can you possibly upset me if I have no idea what you’re talking about, hm?“
reject him despite everything that's just happened terrifies him. He has to be one hundred percent sure that it meant more than a shag to him.
“Yes, but this is not what I-“ Sherlock sighed, exasperated, having no actual arguments to use. John was right after all. Sherlock needed to wash away the pain of losing Mycroft and memories of what had happened at the cemetery as soon as possible.
uncomfortable couch or-“ Sherlock’s voice dropped low below almost inaudible volume,“ slither into your bed at worst.“
Mary scoffed. “Oh, please, acting like a clueless idiot serves no purpose, Sherlock, you’re insulting not only your own intelligence but also mine.“
Sometimes, in that one moment particularly, it felt just like a dream. For a split second, Sherlock panicked that this was just another one of his hallucinations, that John was not in fact there, that he never came back to Baker Street and he was definitely not in Sherlock’s bedroom now, placing his own clothes next to Sherlock’s. But these vexatious thoughts were fortunately gone before they managed to scare Sherlock further.
Sherlock hasn't said a word ever since the client arrived but his expression speaks for himself. He'd rather be anywhere else. The young man sitting opposite him appears to be every bit of dull and dreary and to make it even worse, the story he's come to tell couldn't be less entertaining...
, John. I've just reached the conclusion that Harrington is too dumb to engage in illegal activity. Sounds good to me. You can put that on your blog.”
“Are you sure?“ John drawls, taking a deep breath before reaching to intertwine their fingers yet again.
… he truly... cares about me, would you believe that? You've always claimed that once you let someone so close you're destined to fail in everything because that person now owns your heart and you're no longer able to do anything without prioritising
“We can go to the park.“ Sherlock emerges from behind, his hands folded behind his back. “Since you miss the walks so much,“ he adds, such a heart-warming smile on his lips that John somehow immediately forgets about feeling cold. For a moment at least.
more than the five excruciating hours of waddling at Harrington's heels. And besides...” Sherlock crosses his arms, “we haven't been exactly cautious enough. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already noticed that we're on to him.”
way I would have let you go with me. Why do you think I didn’t let you know in the first place? It was
“Of course not,“ John shook his head. “I am just surprised you brought this up. Wouldn’t it be easier if we simply crawled into the bed and dozed off without having to talk about it?“
Sherlock at first didn’t seem to comprehend what was John asking for. Once John called upon him the second time however, he stepped forward, faltering as he let the other man to take a hold of both of his wrists. Sherlock had gone weak at his knees as soon as John’s thumbs rubbed circles over the back of his hands. Small, appeasing circles that made Sherlock’s heart flutter. John pulled him back down on the couch, not letting go off Sherlock’s hands even once they were seated next to each other again.
“Y-yes, my choice,“ John nodded, continuing even though his tongue was dry and heavy in his mouth. But John wasn't going to waste another opportunity, not this time. Not when Sherlock finally managed to look him in the eyes without turning away.
John's brow furrows as he takes a moment to contemplate Sherlock's plan. “So... we get to spend a whole week in Spain
A beat on John. Wavers for another second, then he gives a nod. Takes a seat in his chair. Eyes still on Sherlock.
“I don’t know,“ Sherlock sighed, shutting the laptop. “Seems like Mary decided to toy with me in a very childish way… if I do say so myself. She knows I am after her but she’s also aware of that I
there, in body and soul, Sherlock silently watched him from across the corridor through wide open door. The man was shuttling between the wardrobe and his bag placed on Sherlock’s bed, putting his neatly folded clothes into one of Sherlock’s half-empty drawers. Even from that far could Sherlock notice that soft, beautiful smile upon John’s lips as he shuffled from one place to another. This sight made Sherlock’s heart flutter, a warm, cosy feeling overtook his body. He now understood what ordinary people meant when they talked about butterflies in their stomachs. Sherlock definitely felt that way in that moment. John Watson was back in his life, back at Baker Street and Sherlock couldn’t even remember the last time he felt so blissfully happy.
? There's no doubt in his mind... Sherlock have just read the yet unfinished entry that John had scribbled last night.
for his ingeniousness, John showers him with praises and words of endearment. It’s a pleasure to watch as his cheeks turn even redder and certainly not from the frost alone.
cause I am a freak, am I not?“ Sherlock smiled sadly. “No one wanted to date me. And having sex with someone I didn’t know and trust… someone I didn’t
Yes, recounting those events have certainly helped to change my perspective. But it won't be easy to forget. Scars are scars. Doesn't matter whether caused by a bullet or an utterly bizarre, coma-induced nightmare.
. Fortunately enough, Sherlock comprehends, easily switches to Spanish and places the order. With a smile, the waitress takes a few notes but it's only after she walks away that John collects himself again.
John throws a couple of furtive glances at him, at first simply smiling, because the crinkle that appears above Sherlock’s nose when he’s ruminating is just plain
Why would anyone not do that for you knowing you loved them? Why else I’d let her anywhere near you if I didn’t believe that she was no longer dangerous, that you still loved one another?“
“Now hold on a second,” John cuts him off, lifting a finger and almost pressing it to Sherlock’s lips as if to shush him. The mere thought of someone other than himself playing Sherlock’s partner is all the incentive he needs to skip the part where he attempts to teach Sherlock about polite manners and moves on to just saying yes to whatever he proposes.
“Never underestimate Mrs Hudson, John, she is much smarter she looks like,“ Sherlock replied, leaning back against the cushion. “But I am sure she is not aware of the real reason behind your break up, don’t worry, no one told her.“
“I am sorry, sir, but due to the delicacy of the situation, we are not allowed to let anyone near the patient unless you identify yourself as a relative.“
told you that’s not going to happen. Look, I know what you said about me not owing you anything, but I won’t ever be at peace until she gets what she deserves.“
John's eyes widen in sheer disbelief. Sherlock, on the other hand, looks only mildly intrigued. Still... intrigued nonetheless. And it's not like he can argue with the look that John's just given him.
“Yes you can…,“ Sherlock sighed, whipping around, “stay here, John, it’s for your own good. Trust me.“
“I know,“ Sherlock gasped. “I am aware of what she is capable of, John. I am not going to underestimate her ever again, don’t worry.“
John’s knees almost betrayed him, shaking beneath him for what felt like eternity, his orgasm overwhelming and lasting for so long so even once he finally regained some control he was still barely able to catch his breath. He was at least present enough to pull back and help Sherlock back on the floor before they both slid down the wall, holding each other in their arms, speechless for only a little while.
Why, yes. I know what you're thinking, but I've always liked bloodhounds. Long before the incident we've agreed to never speak of again.
And yet there was nothing near perfect about their dance. Sherlock still couldn’t bring himself to meet John’s eyes, he stared down at their moving feet instead. But he couldn’t hide his face completely. John could swear there were tears glimmering in his gloomy eyes. The mere notion of Sherlock fighting an urge to cry broke his heart, he felt as if he was about to combust if neither of them were about to say anything.
, he feels. The occasion couldn't be more fitting. Uttering those three words comes natural, as if he was meant to say them decades ago already. In another time, another life maybe. The long lost truth to be finally revealed.
Close on his face: Brooding, tired. Weary eyes suggests that he hasn't slept much lately. He's been through a lot.
“Who knows,“ he shrugged, staring off into the distance with a sad smile. “Maybe not permanently. Maybe you will soon find someone else and-“ Sherlock’s voice faded into a tiny surprised squeak once he felt a cold touch of fingers, lingering over the back of his hand.
. Both you and I needed some air, sore feet or not. Besides, I don't know about you, but I didn't feel like going straight home. After what happened earlier.
. You haven’t left the flat for over three months, another four you spent in the hospital, so-“ Sherlock’s voice suddenly falters as he realises how insensitive that was of him.
Sherlock immediately turned to face his brother with a plain resentment behind his reddish glassy eyes.
Panning from him to a laboratory flask in the middle of the table. A single flower in it. Sherlock's staring down at it. We're watching all of this from John's POV. Sherlock picks up the flower, frowns at it, then puts it back into the flask and repeats the same process twice more before finally deciding to leave the flower in there.
brother I am,“ Sherlock yelped, running a hand down his face as if he tried to hide, as if he was ashamed of not being able to open up the way he’d strived to.
“Yes. Because you're too goddamn pretty when you're blushing,” John giggles but Sherlock instantly bends down and shushes him with another kiss.
Mycroft frowned, Sherlock could tell from the bitter tone of his voice. “Good luck believing that. Sherlock, Mary is a trained assassin, a truly skilful one. If she wants to meet you in privacy, I have no doubt there will be guns involved and I bet that she will gratefully paint the walls with your blood the second she sees your face. You are sending yourself to a death trap, brother.“
For the first time in forever, John allowed himself a laugh. “Of course I didn't, no. But I guess she
“Too many questions at once, John,“ Sherlock sighed, circling around John so he could sink down on the couch. John followed him, determined to receive answers.
I’d like do to you afterwards, Sherlock,“ John giggles, shuffling further below so he can straddle Sherlock’s lap, his fingers gently stroking up and down Sherlock’s bare abdomen. “It’s all up to you. But if you
I know what he did to you. That beast. I want to see him rot in the jail as much as you, but first I must find him. You're the only one who can give us a clue. Ms. Ronder, please.
Confused, John turns to look at Sherlock, only to realise that he was so buried in his thoughts he completely forgot to watch where he was going.
“I am fine.“ There were more lies behind this simple sentence than Sherlock ever uttered out loud, but he refused to admit how miserable he truly feels so he just decided to fib.
“Anyway,“ Sherlock cleared his throat. “I am quite frankly glad that you’re not really delighted with what I’ve done to the place,“ he glanced around the room, hands wildly gesticulating in the air.
Harrington turns red, anger blazing in his eyes but he can't bring himself to say anything. He throws one more resentful look at the manager and stomps off. John suspects they haven't seen the last of him yet.
Just as the thought crosses his mind, Sherlock breaks the silence that has descended. “The bed's big enough, you won't even notice you’re lying next to me. In case you were wondering. Then again,” he purses his lips, a bit anxiously it seems. “I might as well sleep on the sofa if the idea of sharing a bed with me... bothers you.”
“But I think,” he continues, cupping John's cheek with his right hand, his thumb tenderly brushing along the seam of John's lips. “It's time to admit that neither me nor you were... well,
“Sure,“ John lowered his eyes, this time taking one long gulp after another until his mug was half-empty. Fake or not, the sight of Sherlock kissing someone else had been quite queasy-worthy, John had to admit. He could hardly erase the memory of it, albeit feeling like an utter hypocrite since he had so often used to promenade around the flat in the company of his girlfriend, sometimes in a desperate hope of spurring a jealous reaction from Sherlock. And yet he so irrationally held grudge against basically everyone who had merely breathed in Sherlock’s presence. John might have as well turned green on the outside, it would at least explain Sherlock’s puzzled expression.
A sudden noise however roused him before he was even able to drift off to sleep. Sherlock concluded that it could have been no one but Mrs Hudson, that distinctive gait, feeble steps, breathing with difficult while climbing those steep stairs, he had no idea how he could have mistaken John for her the evening before. But then again, his mind had been preoccupied with Mary and his own judgement was proved to be clouded that day.
You didn't end up working at my clinic by an accident, did you? That wasn't your job. You were never supposed to be a nurse. You were just keeping an eye... on me.
“Shut up you bastard.“ For the first time Mary let her voice raise a little, but Sherlock didn’t seem to be startled by it. At least he didn’t let it to be shown. He kept standing there with hands in his pockets and a false smug face that would turn anyone else furious, but Mary got used to his manners long ago.
The day John was meant to leave the hospital they had however even more important topics to discuss. John might have been allowed to go home, but neither of them gave much thought to
On Sherlock - at this, he slowly turns to look at the door, almost regretfully. Finally, he allows himself to cry again.
She hides her face behind a veil, never leaves the flat. Only rarely lets me in. The worst are the noises. She often cries at night. Sometimes I hear her shouting.
“I am not going anywhere,“ Sherlock exclaimed, not even realising that people that surrounded him were there to help John and not harm them.
John's gazing at Sherlock, enamoured, but he looks a bit nervous too. He's got something on his mind.
Sherlock delivers his monologue with such serious face, John has troubles resisting an urge to kiss the tiny crinkle above his nose.
“As a matter of fact, yes, I do,“ Sherlock retorted. “And I understand that this must’ve been a huge leap for you. I just-I am not sure how to react.“
“No, you’re not,“ John objected, taking one more step to shorten the gap between them. “Not even right now, you’re not even being honest with
“For me?“ John arched an eyebrow but didn’t think twice before accepting what Sherlock had offered. “Shouldn’t it be the other way around?
“Morning,” John gives a lopsided smile, fighting against the urge to stare at Sherlock's mouth. Which is anything but easy, considering that Sherlock's incredibly voluptuous lips are
but innocent, John, “ Sherlock snorted, lightly offended. “I hope you won’t treat me like a weakling from now on,“ he raised an eyebrow. “Just because I have gave you my entire heart and told you such intimate and embarrassing things? For your information, I am still the same nerve wrecking and obnoxious bastard like before, John,“ Sherlock smirked cheekily, pulling John down back into a little rough, hasty kiss to prove it but it all backfired the moment John took the lead again.
“Hm,” Sherlock pouts. “Fair enough... I suppose you were right, more than I was willing to admit. What you said in the elevator. We really haven’t been a very convincing couple so far.”
off,“ he chuckles, taking John’s hand into his own but before rolling off the bed his gaze falls upon the disused scarf laying atop the sheets. He reaches for it with a smirk, tossing it in John’s direction afterwards.
Fortunately, they arrive at their destination before John definitely loses it. Still, the tension in the air is palpable and John's steps are nothing short of hesitant as he and Sherlock walk down the hallway. There's but a few dozens of metres separating them and their suite and John can't for the love of him imagine what happens once they reach it.
If he took this cigarette in this situation, it would mean that sooner or later there would come another one and then Sherlock would reach for something worse, something far more dangerous that could permanently damage him. There was still a pack of sterile syringes, after all, hidden behind sacks of pastries and cookies in one of the kitchen cabinets and even though he had no supplements at home, it was anything but an issue to obtain whatever drug Sherlock craved for.
“That I'd miss you?” John's voice quivered but the words were as sharp as a knife cutting through the air and pierced right through Sherlock's heart, shattering it into billions of pieces. He was staring right into Sherlock's eyes now, his whole body shivering.
Sherlock watches him for a brief moment, angry at himself for allowing the fear to get in the way yet again. But the time has come to beat that beast for good. John’s right. There’s no use trying to pretend, trying to escape from their feelings, not any longer, not after today, Sherlock concludes. Taking a deep breath, he ever so gently grasps John’s wrist. It’s like he’s watching himself from outside his body, his actions, commanded by his heart rather than mind.
is perhaps a bit too strong word, Sherlock and… mountaineering? Really? You should stop overreacting, it’s just a couple of bloody stairs. I’ll be one hundred percent fit in no time, I am just a tiny bit
? You know you can’t have both. Not even after murdering me, I am far from being the only one who is aware of all what you’re still hiding. John
When I look at these two men in front of me, I see pure, infinite love. I see two souls, old and eternal as the love itself, whose bond is stronger than any force of the nature, two souls that never have and never will exist without each other. There is no doubt in my mind, these two men, have been brought together by fate-
“John, you should bear in mind that Mary is currently under the influence of very strong emotions. Just look at the two of us. You-you said you
, not because of lack of criminals in his life. And then, after sacrificing his own life for him and pouring his heart out, John freaked out just because Sherlock was about to do something not even remotely dangerous. Sherlock was clueless, he had to admit. This situation he found himself in was so new and strange that not even a mind of such genius could comprehend it.
whatever it was and John most certainly did need to hear an explanation but if Sherlock wasn't going to bring himself to talk, he surely wasn't going to try and make him. Instead, he gave a tense nod and turned toward the door. He needed air, or else he was going to combust. “By the way, you're not invited to the wedding,” he quickly added and with that, stormed out of the room.
Sherlock sighed in annoyance. He hoped he wouldn’t have to demonstrate but John left him no choice. Sherlock had been pressed against John’s side for the entire night and he didn’t move an inch in the morning, so once he carefully wiggled his hips against him, John could finally catch on. Which is to say, he actually gasped out loud, a noise such close to a moan that Sherlock had to bit his tongue in order to not let out a similar sound.
Sherlock didn’t even need to say a word, John knew exactly what he wanted. He seized Sherlock’s waist, dipping his nails into Sherlock’s skin before he pulled the man even closer and thrust faster, leaning forward to claim Sherlock’s lips once again. He sucked and kissed with such voracity so Sherlock melted into a gibbering mess,sliding up and down the wall quite roughly but he couldn’t care less at the moment.
John opens his mouth to reply but all in vain, Sherlock has managed to kick all the air out of his lungs. He's spent years assuming that all and every emotion is abhorrent to Sherlock. God, the biggest mistake of his life. The man standing in front of him loves
But then John averted his eyes all of a sudden, nodding slightly as if in support, before disappearing behind the curtain once again. He seemed to finally understand that what Sherlock needed so desperately was
“Ever since I returned, these words were on the tip of my tongue. I wanted to tell you... how lost I had been without you, how much I had been missing you. How empty my life without you is. How much I need you… I- I
Sherlock’s hands freeze mid-act. Trying to think of an appropriate response, he zones out for a moment, perceiving only after realising that John is tying a scarf around his neck.
?“ John stared agape at him, he’d rather brush off the notion that just crossed his mind but much to the terror, it was unfortunately making far too much sense. “Sherlock, you
true.“ Taking a deep breath, Sherlock lifts his hands to cradle John’s face, his trembling fingers sliding down John’s crimson cheeks, caressing ever so tenderly. John can feel his heart beating fast and vigorous. He could as well melt beneath Sherlock's fingers, were it not for the struggle to believe his words.
That being said, he and Sherlock quickly and surprisingly effortlessly become immersed in, not only the most delicious food but also in an extremely flirty conversation and fail to notice that the man they were supposed to be keeping an eye on has already left. John doesn’t even realise that they’ve essentially botched up their job until he and Sherlock retreat to their room...
“Sherlock, please,“ John hissed through his teeth, “if what you are about to do, has anything to do with Mary… you
He turns to walk where the sound is coming from - sitting room, coffee table. He grabs the phone, cancels the call.
This memory was however still one that was always worth remembering. Especially now, once Sherlock finally spotted that tall, lurid building he was supposed to enter. Its grey, somewhat blurred silhouette has been surmounting above the rest of the district like a mountain soaring above the forest. It seemed that Mary had a thing for such eerie, florid places. Sherlock was sure that this particular house must be one of those already abandoned mansions that maybe belonged to one of her many ancestors decades ago. She apparently decided to confront Sherlock in the most pompous fashion.
“Yes. Yes, we will,” he murmurs and kisses Sherlock as softly as though his lips were but a fragile petal. But then Sherlock shifts and John extremely quickly realises what a bad idea it would be to cuddle immediately after the kind of messy sex they've just had.
“What have I done?“ Sherlock sobbed once the illusion faded away and he found himself kneeling in the grass again, clutching at his own jacket so tightly he could tear it apart. “This - this wasn’t meant to happen again, Mycroft, I should’ve
are you doing all this? You’re still not able to let go of the life you’ve always led so why you simply won’t let go of
That was until John changed the angle, hitting his prostate. Sherlock’s voice cracked, he arched his back, allowing John to pound into him so deep so he was being furiously driven against the wall. One of John’s hands flew to get a grip of Sherlock’s hair, tugging and pulling, the other one roamed round Sherlock’s body, stroking the moist skin for a brief moment before he sped up one more time. There was only one thought on Sherlock’s mind, he had never experienced anything that he’d consider more erotic. John holding him so tightly but still carefully enough, craving for his lips and body like one craves for his drug, kissing and sucking hungrily, each patch of Sherlock’s skin he could reach, bringing him close, so close with his cock and tongue and filthy praises uttered between open-mouthed kisses.
“Come on, you have to eat. Doctor's orders. Angelo evidently has the same opinion,“ John snickers, pointing at the second fork on the plate that was put there on purpose, Sherlock figures, rather than accidentally.
Wouldn't you miss it? The thrill, the action. I know I would. Solving crimes is what we do, it's our life, Sherlock. We can't simply leave it behind and hide away in a forest. You'd be bored within five minutes.
“Oh, so-“ he wetted his dry lips, ignoring the heat building up in his groin and his own hardening cock. “That’s-that’s alright, Sherlock, no need to be ashamed. It’s pretty normal. Morning erection-actually proper term should be nocturnal penile-“
On John's laptop screen - his blog, the front page, focusing on the title of the latest entry ''The Sign of Three''.
The next few seconds are blurry, John can only remember himself pounding into Sherlock’s mouth so roughly so the bed creaks and bends beneath them and then Sherlock’s grip on his thighs, pulling him even closer somehow, swallowing each and every single drop of come spilled down his throat. John perceives soon enough to pull back and finish himself over Sherlock’s flushed face and chin and between his swollen grinning lips and even the scarf still wrapped around his eyes.
his John, emerged from the shadows and casually leaned against the door-frame. Clean-shaven, sharp-dressed, and sporting a slightly longer haircut, he looked
“Why should I be-“ Sherlock’s voice halted mid-sentence once his mind clicked, his eyes flew wide open, his trembling hand reaching immediately for the phone in his pocket. Blank, unresponsive screen of his phone made his heart race wild and frantic upon realising what that means. The battery ran dry and he didn’t even notice, it could’ve been hours.
What Sherlock needed was time and he was prepared to steal himself enough to survive this or at least to delay the moment of him taking a bath in his own blood.
“Shh,“ John left another peck, this time over Sherlock’s shoulder. “Come now. Lie down and don’t think about it anymore. I don’t want from you to relive those dark moments, so please, try to forget about it now and gets some sleep. You desperately need it and don’t you dare to protest. For how long have you’ve been neglecting sleep?“
At the last minute Sherlock decides against uttering the whole truth. This is neither the right time nor occasion to confess the vastness of his love for John.
“I-I mean once we-once we lie down again. Could you hold me in your arms tonight, John? I need to-I need to feel you beside me.“
What I am saying... is that I want to spend the rest of my life by your side and no matter what, Sherlock, I won't let anyone ever harm you again.
“ Sherlock took a moment to nod, sort of delirious albeit tired grin hanging upon his lips. He found himself so numb so he failed in his attempt to turn off the water so he rather snuggled closer to John instead, gently bumping their noses.
Quickly, he tries to pacify Sherlock, talking to him, calm, sensitive, in spite of Sherlock panicking.
Sherlock's head falls backward, he moans and gasps, letting the warm water pour over his face and down his body. Instinctively, he drags his fingers across John's scalp, grips his damp hair and thrusts into his mouth, once, twice, craving more friction. He can feel John swallowing around his cock, his tongue rubbing vigorously against the hot flesh, and God, he is already
. My left eye doesn't even resemble an eye any longer, an inch to the left and I'd lose it completely. Admit it, Sherlock, I am an ugly, broken man now, no need to fake kindness to make me feel better.” John allows himself to cry some more, loudly and shamelessly, tears streaming down his face.
He puts the mug away, pulls out the phone from his pocket. Acting nonchalantly, but in fact, he's trying to conceal how worried he's getting.
It seemed to be useless trying to reason with Sherlock but John was having none of that. “I am not entirely sure I believe you, Sherlock,“ John admitted, risking a small step forward. “You’re exceptionally quiet. You didn’t even make a speech at the funeral. You-you
“And you... are a marvel,” Sherlock pants, searching for John's mouth with his own. There's but an innocent stroke of lips at first, but as Sherlock lets his tongue swirl over John's, things take a whole new turn.
, John thinks. He has to keep his true feelings at bay, carefully hidden from Sherlock. And even though he did have the tiniest glimmer of hope that their relationship could bloom into something much deeper, it’s most definitely lost by now. Six more days and they’ll be back at Baker Street and this whole game of playing a couple will be over anyway. A mere thing of the past that they’ll most likely never mention again.
“I really do believe it’s time to stop pretending, Sherlock.“ John drops his voice, deep and husky, making Sherlock’s body respond in hundreds of different ways.
“What about the fact that there’ll be no one to disturb us?“ John pointed out with a suggestive smile. “Mrs Hudson had walked in on us
“Why, it was… good, John,“ Sherlock clears his throat, acting as nonchalantly as he’s capable of, still refusing to confess that he’d definitely wouldn’t mind some more. “Really, nothing particularly… special.“
John gaped like a carp as soon as letting the words out, his heart hammering so fiercely against his ribs it must had been audible. There went his attempts to approach the subject carefully, step by step, or better yet, not at all yet, so Sherlock would not be exposed to such an overwhelming emotional impact after everything he had been through in the past few days. Despite being so eager to finally discuss it, John still deemed it quite impertinent to talk with Sherlock about his feelings for him so openly so soon after what had happened to Mycroft. No amount of apologies were enough to make him feel less remorseful for even starting such an intimate conversation.
John stares, Mary doesn't even turn to look at the person who's now stepped from the darkness, turning out to be-
“John, I’ve already agreed on that I won’t be trying to get closer to Mary anymore,“ Sherlock reminded him, acting as if he’s just made a some sort of a horrible sacrifice. “I’ve dealt with far worse criminals than Mary. Never before I had to hide like a rat and trust me, Mary is not the first person who’d ever threatened me. So don’t you dare to insist that we should leave our home just because that…
. And yet, despite initially considering to bolt and never look Sherlock in the eye again, John cannot help but laugh. Laugh at the sheer absurdity of the past few minutes.
John waits, but Sherlock ignores him. Giving a small sigh, he takes another step forward, pulls up a chair, sits down next to Sherlock's bed. He looks worried, almost anxious, not knowing what to expect from Sherlock.
... or something,“ Sherlock stutters as if too shy to finish the sentence. His whole face now as red as a cherry.
This time John didn’t break the kiss, this time Sherlock closed his eyes and kissed back, the most ecstatic feeling he had ever experienced. John’s lips were pliant and soft and gentle, guiding Sherlock’s until Sherlock got used to the rhythm. A moment later Sherlock found John’s fingers rushing through his hair and his other hand caressing down his cheek and jaw and neck, and his lips kissing Sherlock much more passionately, deepening the kiss. His tongue rubbed slowly across Sherlock’s bottom lip, before slipping in and teasing playfully, making Sherlock grin and laugh so much so after a couple of moments he had to pull back.
Contrary to popular belief, Mrs. Hudson, I do not know everything. You have to be more precise. What are you talking about?
?” John frowns, pointing at Sherlock’s shirt, unbuttoned halfway down and thus exposing an obscenely large patch of his skin.
Sherlock threw him only a brief glance, however, almost as if he was afraid of staring for far too long and giving away something he had no intention to yet. But even after he retreated to gazing at the fire he could sense that John just furrowed his brow, he was perplexed and perhaps even a little more worried than before.
“Where the bloody hell did you pullthose number from?“ John giggles, tapping Sherlock's chin ever so lovingly.
“Average human body maybe,“ Mycroft nodded, his voice drooping low as he shifted closer to Sherlock and grabbed him by his forearm, “but the body of a man who’s already been at a risk of malnutrition should be taken proper care of. You’re hazarding with your own health you bloody idiot.“
, I can’t take it on my own anymore. I want to tell him, I do, but how? I don’t think he would understand
“We've taken it a bit too seriously, don't you think? The whole fake relationship thing,” he chuckles as if to test the waters and pokes Sherlock's arm with his elbow.
It was already past dusk when Sherlock finally returned home. He staggered across the entryway as if he’d been completely drained of energy, not even able to walk the stairs without clinging to the railway.
He grabs his phone from the nightstand, thinking he might as well try to call Sherlock, but just as he puts the phone to his ear, he notices the balcony door is slightly ajar, and the curtains are half-closed, almost like purposefully obscuring the view through the window. It doesn’t take Sherlock himself to figure out. That must be where he’s... hiding? Looks like he
Sherlock bit his lip, gazing down shyly. “That piece… it’s so perfect because, well, when I was composing it, I was thinking of…
John’s hand clenched around the gun as his eyes darted over Sherlock. Sherlock, who’s not been glaring back at him, Sherlock who was convinced that John would rather die than make such a decision, it didn’t matter that the odds have changed. Either that or he would naturally choose his wife over his best friend. But how wrong the detective’s been.
“There’s nothing you can do,“ John growls to cut him off. “I told you million times already. Why don’t you just listen? This is my life,
Sherlock blinked up at him, his own body betraying him. He was aware of how stupidly he must have looked but for a couple of moments he was capable of no more but staring petrified in shock at John. It wasn’t until John nearly gave up that he finally gathered up enough courage to reach for his hand, trying not to thinking about what reasons either of them had. He was drawn to John, like a moth to the flame.
“I will wait for as long as there’s a need, Sherlock,“ John said once breaking the kiss. “I asked just because I wasn’t entirely sure- with you I can never know,“ he tittered. “Yes, I admit that you’re driving me crazy and I often think about you in the way I am sincerely ashamed of-“
“Well,“ Sherlock turned off the water, leaving the rest of the dishes lying untouched in the sink. “You do realise that tonight we’re about to sleep by each other’s side, right?“ he turned to John with a suggestive, yet still a shy smile. “
Sherlock whimpers and writhes beneath John, arching his back, desperate for more contact but John gives him the opposite of what he wants. He breaks the kiss, grasping his waist so he can keep him steady in one place instead.
It's been a while since Sherlock was in such a surly mood. John quickly comes to realise that if he doesn't attempt to make that frown disappear he'll be dealing with a very grumpy Sherlock for a very long time.
in the first place. He'd seen him die. He'd seen him jump off the roof with his very own eyes. He'd seen the pool of blood, he'd tried to take Sherlock's pulse but his heart had been beating no more. He'd been to the funeral, mourned his death, for
“I-I…I don’t think so,“ Sherlock sighed heavily, his voice hoarse and raw. “Can you-John, can you hold me, please?“
“See the man on the far right? Sherlock pipes up, but his voice is barely above a whisper. “Blue shirt, hideous beard, coquetting with the tall blonde. That is our man.”
“Did you forget which way the bedroom is?” John snickers, hoping to goad Sherlock. There's no telling how long he can last and he'd very much prefer their first time
“We don’t have to do this but… fine, as you wish.“ John took a deep breath as to steel himself up. “First of all, Mycroft refused to tell me, he wanted
true,“ Sherlock protested, raising his voice out of nowhere as if that statement had personally offended him, catching John completely off guard. “You’re going to be a great father, John, You’re the most loyal, the most caring and considerate person I have the fortune of knowing. I am sure Mary thinks the same. She has changed. Which is why I-I don't think she meant any of
“Wait, what, why? Are you in pain? Is it your leg? Your scar? Or is it- is it my bed, are you not comfortable? Are my pillows not soft enough? I can-“
it, Sherlock,“ John clarifies, throwing somewhat a bashful look at the man kneeling in front of him. Trying to push him away must have been one of the worst decisions he has ever made, he has to admit. Whatever reasons he had.
Sherlock didn’t even have to ask. As soon as he said those words, John’s face turned pale, his jaw clenching. “But those are-those are Moriarty’s words, Sherlock,“ he breathed out disbelievingly.
instead. It’s suspicious enough that Sherlock doesn’t mind to be disturbed in the middle of an experiment but the fact he hasn’t been interested in taking cases for months now John considers somewhat worrisome even.
“So... what exactly is your plan?” John asks once after the car finally moves down the road and toward Heathrow.
“Excuse me?“ John’s fist clenched at such insolent words, he was seething and yet his voice was perfectly steady. His eyes, however, his eyes were blazing dangerously with sheer resent and anger. If the conditions were any different John wouldn’t hesitated breaking the guy’s nose but the last thing Sherlock needed that day was John being taken to jail because of protecting his dignity.
What he just said rendered Sherlock bewildered but as it seemed, John wasn’t even about to make a big deal out of it. Sherlock wondered if this is how their relationship’s going to look like from then on and if that was the case, then what impact it was going to have on them. He had always been absolutely convinced that John didn’t think of them as anything more than best friends and colleagues. Sherlock even used to think that John stayed around
“I told you I have plenty of work to do,“ Sherlock lazily waved his hand. “I will hardly even mull over the idea of sleeping in the course of the next few days.
“Are you mad now?“ Sherlock peered at the other man from under his lashes, his voice merely above a whisper.
“I’ve never been gentler,“ John chuckled once he was finally done applying patches over Sherlock’s face.
it. I am sure you didn’t plan on dying here tonight… without revealing your true feelings for John, yet here you are.“
John did open his mouth to answer but he simply couldn't bring himself to utter a word. He but licked his lips, gazing at Sherlock ever so lovingly for a few moments before finally gathering enough courage to do what he should have done ages ago. With a little sniff, he strode toward Sherlock, bent down to cup his cheeks and pulled him into the most desperate kiss.
Despite John not even being able to look at Sherlock after he let those words out, he could hear him uttering his name, silently, his voice filled with unveiled shock. He circled around Mary and took a few steps forward to claim his place besides Sherlock. He felt a need to guard him, serve as his shield,
“You’re being so stolid, Sherlock,“ Mary chuckled. “Almost as if you were already used to dying. Well, naturally, it must be getting quite boring already.“
and seriously? Glowing foxes? No, not anything like that. Besides, I doubt you are any ready for chasing criminals yet.“
he's planning, but whatever it is, I'd wager he means to ruin everything me and my father worked so hard to achieve. Take a moment to imagine what a disaster that would be. I cannot let that happen.”
, John,“ Sherlock remarked. “And Mrs Hudson might not be around, but that big bulky bull with barely any neck is still downstairs, John and I don’t
“But still… I am going to give you an answer you deserve,“ he added after a while, still not facing the other man.
, stop chasing the people that were in contact with her, stop trying to gather information by interrogating dangerous thugs or whoever are those people. It leads nowhere. She either runs away or she has such a good cover that you’re never going to find her anyway. You know very well that I’ve never liked this idea of you trying to get to Mary on your own. I’ve agreed only because you promised me to be careful and that was before I’ve learnt about those threats. Sherlock, what if you simply accepted that-“
“No, John,“ Sherlock  cut him short, gently rubbing his thumb over the back of John’s hand. “Didn’t you say we should forget about the past? We have all the time in the world, don’t we? We have the present, the future, it’s all ours. You were right, we should bury the past forever and simply enjoy what we have together now.“
“For a case. Of course. It’s all for a... case,” Sherlock forces a smile that appears to be almost wistful but John decides to brush it off and pretend it’s just his mind playing tricks at him.
Smiling through the tears, John pulls Sherlock into a hug, holding him tight for such a long time so once they draw back it’s nearly pitch dark already, only the lamp post above them casting soft, dim light upon their faces.
Then suddenly he felt a touch, a real, warm touch against his cold skin, but instead of feeling relieved he screamed, not realising if out loud or not. Now there was no doubt in his mind that he was locked up in the Serbian basement again, with a minimal chance of surviving. And this time there was no brother to save his life.
“A pretty terrible one, I imagine,“ John titters, his voice rather tense, as if he was impatient for Angelo to leave already, but Sherlock can notice a hint of amusement in his tone as well. He could swear that Angelo winked before dashing away again, but he’s far too focused on John’s little innocent smile to tell for sure.
and solve my problems, that's out of the question, Sherlock. I would never ask for anything such selfish and ignorant. You don't have to deal with
“I’ve never said he does,“ Mary snorted. “All I wanted to was to see that face of yours in the moment your own weapon turns against you.
to. I am… exhausted. Is that what people usually say once they’re no longer able to cope?“ Sherlock scowled, talking directly to Mycroft’s name engraved into the stone.
“Sherlock?” John peeps at once, clenching his left fist. Startled, Sherlock nearly chokes on the smoke, looking awfully abashed.
“Jesus, how-how does any of it matter, Sherlock?” John scowls, failing to comprehend. “It doesn’t matter any more. Nobody cares. I noticed all the scornful looks people were giving me back in the hospital. The moment they look at my face they avert their eyes and walk away, repulsed, no doubt and you know why? Because they find me
Sherlock's quickly leading the woman through the door, when suddenly she stops, much to his disappointment. She turns around. Instinctively, her eyes go to John.
needs to flee the scene. Having said that, he reaches for the handle and quickly shuts the door behind him, trying to avoid Sherlock's gaze at all cost. Sherlock makes no further attempt to stop him, for the truth is, even if he did, he wouldn't know what to say afterward.
With an irritated sigh, Sherlock finished his cigarette and lazily dragged himself off the couch but only to go and grab another one from his stash. He kept grumbling to himself as he shuffled across the dimly lit flat but couldn't be bothered to turn on the lights, not when he planned to return to sulking on the couch anyway.
notice and found it weird that Sherlock didn’t take a seat in front of John. Instead, he stood idly next to the arm of John’s chair, sipping from his mug and silently glaring down at the other man as if he still couldn’t believe that he’s real.
,“ John licked his lips, flashing Sherlock quite a devastatingly seductive smirk. Sherlock leaned forward to kiss it off John’s lips but stopped mid-air upon noticing that John was actually carrying him away and into the shower where he pinned him up against the wall tiles.
,“ he brooded, slipping his phone into the pocket. “Let’s just hope there aren’t any ghosts around. The ones that are used to feed upon the darkest souls, it wouldn’t end up well for either of us.“
He sank down into the chair, leaving out a heavy, shaky sigh afterwards. Sherlock nestled himself but felt anything but comfortable in the chair that belonged to the man whose life was at stake in those moments. Ignoring the tears that moistened his cheeks again, he ran his fingers across the arm of the chair, taking deep breaths, one after another in hopes of composing himself but it brought no calm upon the sharp pain in his chest.
lips,“ John’s voice dipped low into a rough half-whisper as he gripped Sherlock’s neck from behind and slowly leaned in for a kiss. Rather a desperate whimper escaped Sherlock’s throat once John attempted to deepen the kiss despite knowing that Sherlock had no idea what to do.
I do have a theory, but you won't like it. I assume Ms. Ronder's face... has been horribly mangled. It's why she's covering it.
John lets out but a sigh, gazing at Sherlock for long ten seconds before finally offering a reply. He couldn’t say no to those puppy eyes even if he wanted to and he really,
“Don’t ‘Sherl’ on me, John. I am going to track Mary down and she will pay for everything she’s done. Especially for this.“ Sherlock made a vague gesture in the air, pointing toward John in hopes he was going to catch on. Suddenly he didn’t feel like talking so openly about how his, hopefully soon to be ex-wife, marked him for the rest of the life.
“Well, it would seem so.“ John flashed him an uncertain smile, drawing up in his coat when a chilly gust blew around. “Not gonna lie, Sherlock, I thought I was never going to come back,“ he added, “not permanently.“
you even more John and I just can't let that happen again. I won't. Not after making you believe that I cared more about her reasons than you. I-I am sorry, John, truly, for making you believe in something so absurdly inaccurate,“ Sherlock yelped, swallowing dryly before continuing.
Leisurely, Sherlock walks up to him, hands in his pockets, stone cold face but beneath that mask he is seething.
With that thought on his mind, he sheds his gown and steps into the shower. John doesn't turn to look at him and continues to wash himself but when Sherlock approaches him and presses his naked body against his back, he can no longer feign ignorance. He shuts his eyes tight, a desperate, husky moan fleeing his mouth.
John has heard it though. He takes a swift step back, freezes, raising an eyebrow. Stares at Sherlock. What did he just say?
Sherlock deemed it highly unlikely. He tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, listening intently but the creaking had already stopped in the meantime. Must have been Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock thought to himself and decided to brush it off.
“John...” Sherlock's voice trembled, barely a soft whisper but the other man was quiet and the look in his eyes strict. And Sherlock knew exactly why.
“Hm?“ For a moment he was sure that he must have imagined that, he had got used to that, but once Sherlock lifted his head, he could tell he wasn’t just dreaming. John was standing there in the doorway, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and a slightly concerned expression on his face. From what Sherlock could deduce, John couldn’t sleep again, nor he really tried to since he hadn’t even bothered to change into sleepwear. He was still wearing the same navy blue jumper he had worn for the entire day, his hair was still slicked back and bags under his eyes even more prominent than usually.
“No, it’s not,“ John shook his head, taking Sherlock’s hand again, pressing it against his lips so to plant tiny butterfly kisses over his knuckles. “For a hundredth time – it’s not your fault. Come here, kiss me.“ Sherlock didn’t quite agree with that statement but he gave in in the end, just because it was useless quarrelling over the same old stuff over and over again.
“W-what is that supposed to mean?“ John stepped in, crossing arms over his chest in a passive-aggressive stance.
“If I mind that you wanted to make me laugh?“ Sherlock’s eyebrow quirked upwards. “What kind of a question is that, John-“ he snickered derisively, locking their lips in a languid kiss.
“Turn over,“ John requested once Sherlock settled himself on the mattress. His eyes welled up as soon as he could see those hideous scars from that close. It was a devastating sight. John wasn’t even sure if he wanted to know what tools were used to mark Sherlock like this.
“All right, then. You check the rest of the suite, while I change into something more comfortable. And I suggest you do the same. We can’t walk around wearing three layers of clothes and whatnot. Remember, we have to
“Didn’t you say you have plenty of work to do?“ John teased, not even wavering to shorten the distance between them again.
“I am not sure,“ she wavered, eyes flicking from one Holmes back to another, “I have my instructions-“
On Sherlock: anxious; bewildered. Cautiously, he steps forward and heads to the sitting room, trying to ignore the bizarre noise. Then, comes to a halt as if something caught his eye. Slowly, he turns his head to the right, his eyes going to-
John shrugs, smiling innocently. Any other time he’d make the effort to backtrack but not this time. And turns out he's made the right choice. Because one innuendo leads to another and just like that, they accidentally spend half the night giggling and fooling around like a couple of teenagers.
“Sherlock, we’ve already discussed this. You don’t have to sleep on the sofa... Come to bed. It’s fine,” John smiles softly despite feeling perhaps just a tiny bit nervous. Okay,
John tried, he really did try to suppress a smile, anxious that he might look like an idiot if he stares at Sherlock with such a smitten grin plastered on his face, but damn
He was doing it on purpose, John was very well aware, but it wasn't his place to give him lessons. God knows what was going through Sherlock Holmes' mind, especially now that they hadn't seen each other for so long. Speaking of which, Sherlock seemed to have changed more than his habits...
I might not be the brightest person under the Sun, Sherlock, but I did find it a tad suspicious that she had disappeared the very night you'd got shot. And besides... She's always been wearing too much perfume.
Sherlock didn’t notice the moment rest of the medics lifted John’s body up on the stretcher or when they put an oxygen mask on his face. He ignored each of the useless attempts to stop him from getting to as close to John as possible and refused to leave him even after a couple of men tried to pull him away. So when they finally manage to head for the exit, it was while Sherlock was running alongside them, squeezing John’s hand so tight his knuckles turned white.
“It’s been worth the wait, John,“ Sherlock murmurs, words trapped between their parted lips. John suddenly finds it a lot harder to think of anything but kissing Sherlock, breathing in the air Sherlock exhales.
, Sherlock should be the one asking questions but somewhat ironically, once John finally leaves the bathroom, it’s Sherlock who has some explaining to do.
why you are so stubborn,“ Sherlock drawled all of a sudden, flashing John a forced but rueful smile as he turned to face him. It was rather a heart-breaking sight, watching Sherlock as he tried so hard to pretend he was completely unaffected. “You’d feel bad for not fulfilling my brother’s last wish. Is that why you’re so eager to stay?“ he conjectured, an assumption even Sherlock himself didn’t actually believe. His eyes glinted with abashment before he turned back toward the window, his head hanging down and lips pursed. The ever so distinctive taste of shame and guilt was intoxicating.
“Sherlock, I think it would be for the best if you’d let me speak from now,“ Mycroft flashed him a crooked, rather forced smile and then he turned toward the nurse.
. Your favourite, by the way,“ he smiles softly as he returns back to his microscope to inspect a drop of something John doesn’t dare to identify.
,“ John growls, letting out another little dirty chuckle before lowering himself onto Sherlock, kissing him only slowly, leisurely, certainly not minding that he is now wallowing in the mess of chocolate and vanilla cream too. Sherlock takes his time, stroking John’s back at first, raking his nails, up and down his spine before tucking his hands beneath John’s pants, drawing a soft moan out of his mouth once stripping them down.
As soon as they enter the little (and rather minimalist) bar on the first floor, Sherlock orders two glasses of tequila and leads John toward a small table with two bar stools. To their relief, the music isn't too loud and most people are busy dancing, so the two of them can enjoy their drinks relatively in peace.
Last night... You knew I didn't want to talk about it. You know what those nightmares are about, don't you?
“Sher-Sherlock?” No response. John swallows dryly, his voice still a bit too rough this early in the morning. He gives the room another once-over, then returns to the bedroom, worries creeping in but he’s trying his best to ignore them.
pushing me into anything, John,“ Sherlock insisted. “I have already made it quite clear that I’ve completely changed my mind about this subject. I don’t want to be afraid of it anymore. B-but fine,“ he shrugged his shoulders, “if you think we shouldn’t discuss it just yet, we won’t. I just want you to know that it’s all fine, thanks to
“Oh-“ Sherlock’s face at first lightened up as bright as if he just stumbled upon the most interesting case in the history but that spark was gone in an instant his mind reminded him of details he should’ve remembered in the first place. “Well, obviously,“ he gasped, “you were in army. I reckon you’ve already slept with men so you must be quite used to it-“ Sherlock wished he phrased that sentence differently, but once he already let the words slip out it was too late to take them back.
“Agreed,“ Sherlock nodded in approval. “We should just concentrate on the fact that we’re going to be living together again.“
And then there was that moment that made him want to shriek in agony, the moment the bullet was fired up into the air, hitting John who fell into Sherlock’s arms, the moment Sherlock’s entire world has crumbled down into billions of pieces without a chance of being built anew.
being confronted by him in the first place,” John laments. “Damn it, no way I am risking running into him again. We're not leaving this room until Sunday.”
“No, of course not,“ Sherlock shakes his head, his tone, however, mock serious. “I did so only because we’re getting free food here.“
It wasn’t until he heard that voice again, now close and real, almost palpable, that Sherlock realised where he in fact was. Memories started flowing back all at once, loading his brain with a ton of information.
“ John growled, not missing a beat. He squeezed Sherlock’s thigh before carefully pressing his finger inside him, preparing him slowly, taking his time before adding the second one. Sherlock hissed softly at the contact, so quietly so it was barely audible because of the water that was roaring so loudly.
“You shouldn’t be exerting yourself, remember? Besides, your psychosomatic limp has partially returned from what I can gather.“
Caught between a rock and a hard place. Sherlock now understood what people meant when uttering those words. He did feel like trapped after all. The longer he pondered about it, about the past, the future, trying to come up with the best possible solution, trying to decide what step to take next, the louder his thoughts were, shouting at him, burning him from inside. Sherlock would have maybe collapsed right then and there under such enormous weight of hopelessness if it wasn’t for a sudden shrill croak of crows echoing somewhere in the distance that snapped him out of it. It wasn’t until then that he perceived, realising he’d already reached Mycroft’s grave.
“I had a very personal reason for going after Mary by myself this time,“ Sherlock uttered, shoving hands into his pockets. “And I would gladly finish what I had started if it wasn’t for that she began sending me threats. I am not so scared of her but since John is
John gives a strained laugh. The prospect of him and Sherlock visiting the most romantic city on Earth is definitely not what he wants to be discussing right now.
“Hey, w-wait-“ Sherlock panted, breaking the kiss which resulted in a disappointed groan leaving John’s throat. “I just realised… Is that-is that my shirt you’re wearing?“
“221 B Baker Street,“ he ordered and then slouched back in his seat, fastening his belt without even glancing at John.
“I thought we agreed to never speak of that night again,” Sherlock's face is all but deadpan for a brief moment before he finally decides to give up on trying to deduce John's thoughts and pulls up a smirk. “We weren't even dressed for the occasion. I
John felt terribly guilty. He demanded honesty from Sherlock yet he kept on fibbing and hiding the truth from him. Only a coward would act this way, John thought to himself. Sherlock would disagree but John considered himself being a one in that moment.
I told you. I'll take everything from you, Sherlock. I'll make you suffer. I want to see, your face wither... Whatever the cost.
!“ Sherlock was up on his feet again, vigorously thudding his shaking fists against the opposite wall while another drop of tear rolled down his cheek.
Mary was about to raise another objection but John snapped her, taking a small heedful step forward. “Shut up, both of you, I am not an idiot. I figured it out by
of regret,“ John sighs, his voice full of contempt for the person he once thought he loved. “And then nothing. Nothing but infinite darkness. I thought it was over. But no, I survived, I woke up, alive in a hospital bed and believe me or not, I
“Then enlighten me.“ John crossed his arms, risking stepping toward Sherlock again. Sherlock mirrored his position but remained standing in the spot.
, you don’t have to restrain from saying it, Sherlock.“ John ignored the shivers crawling down his spine upon uttering the word. He was more concerned about the fact that Sherlock, who was constantly swallowing in nervousness, might faint any second. John wasn’t sure how he was supposed to soothe him without crossing a barrier Sherlock wasn’t prepared for yet, but leaving him to deal with this situation on his own was out of the question. So John stretched out his hands, his voice soft and smooth as he reached for Sherlock.
“Pfff,“ John snorted. “Bad morning breath is hardly a thing that will stop me from kissing you,“ he snickered, locking their lips in a languish kiss. Once John realised that Sherlock was really trying to get better this time, he pulled back an inch, murmuring against his lips.
him even and although he did agree to move back to Baker Street, he did so only very reluctantly. Too stubborn, too
“How come you can let those words out of your mouth and still act as if everything was alright,“ John gasped in disbelief. “Did you really think I am going to stay with you for any longer? After all this?“
That was the plan. But plans change, John. I had not expected to fall in love, but I did and I... I wanted to quit, I swear. Magnussen was supposed to be my last kill. He knew too much. All I wanted, was to free myself from my past and have a family.
John's features instantly soften. “Oh...” His heart must be drumming louder than the music, but he doesn't care. He's noticed that Sherlock's breathing faster than usual, his pupils are dilated and his cheeks are coloured dark red.
“What I meant,“ he said, stepping forward so the distance between them had been shortened again, “is that if you’re so
So far there’d been a subtle, barely noticeable smile on John’s lips that very quickly morphed into a bright, wide grin, one that John couldn’t fight even if he wanted. He opened his mouth to reply but Sherlock beat him to it.
On Dr. Mason, she throws a look full of bewilderment at Sherlock, accidentally dropping her pen to the floor. She crouches to pick it up, stuttering through her reply.
and there was nothing else John could do but gave it to him. And yet Sherlock hesitated for a moment, reconsidering the choice he’d made. He didn’t actually think of any particular place he'd go to, he'd fled in the heat of a moment, making one hasty decision after another. But once he was sure that John was not about to show again he turned around as he'd initially intended, plodding down the empty drenched street, lost in the vortex of his own thoughts.
Sherlock blinks, once, thrice, contemplating. He couldn’t care less about food, not when John’s behaving so strangely, drowning Sherlock in his own confusion. And yet, seeing as how John decided to enjoy his meal instead of leading a conversation, he proceeds to do just the same, having to accept he might as well have to wait a tad longer to receive a satisfying explanation.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,“ John’s smile widens. He must be teasing, Sherlock thinks. Ever so nonchalantly John picks the bottle and pours two glasses, taking a small sip of wine before he retreats to eating. In spite of Sherlock’s dazed expression, he offers no word to clarify.
You know you had no choice. Lying to him wouldn't make it any easier, sooner or later he'd learn the truth anyway.
“Oh, that's very generous of you.” Another burst of laughter escapes John's throat and as for Sherlock... he can't quite restrain himself either.
He walks over to John's bed, folds his arms behind his back. His face says it all - he feels guilty, heart breaking at the sight of John in a hospital bed.
“Go?“ John frowned, his brow furrowing, almost as if he didn’t understand what exactly Sherlock was proposing. “You want me to…
John doesn't let him finish and instead kisses him fiercely, swallowing his moan. It shouldn't be that hot, but hearing Sherlock curse (which he only very rarely does) somehow arouses him even more and makes him pick up the pace. Sherlock joins in an instant, wrapping his arms around John's back more tightly and rocking his pelvis even faster. John can feel himself shiver as Sherlock rakes his nails down his spine and reaches between their legs to take both their cocks in his large hand.
But as soon as he finally spotted John in the doorway, he stiffened in one place in utter confusion. Almost as if Sherlock forgot that John had moved back in.
Mary seemed to be caught off by the fact that John learnt the truth. Yet there was no sign of remorse on her stone cold gloomy face, nothing but sheer contempt.
you can say or do that would prevent me from doing so. You won’t push me away, never again, Sherlock.“
“Then we should probably contact Mycroft,“ John suggested, speaking over Sherlock. “What if she’s plotting against you? What if she set her goal to kill you?“
“I don’t mind you taking my things into your own possession. You can do whatever you want with this room since it’s now
“B-before I leave, however... I know I am just making it worse for both of us, but there is still one more thing I need to tell you Mycroft,“ he pursed his quavering lips, his fingers twitching to touch the stone but he caught himself not being bold enough so he simply let the words to be heard instead.
At once, we hear a doorbell, putting an abrupt end to the awkward situation. Sherlock seems to be grateful for the distraction.
“Oh- t-tonight already?“ John rubbed the back of his neck. “I thought-I thought you were going to spend a night working on Mary’s case.“
“Well, there had been no need before,“ Sherlock shrugged, murmuring under his breath. “We used to live together.“
“I know, I am sorry, John, I shouldn’t have asked you about that,“ Sherlock apologised, panic in his eyes as clear as in his breathy voice.
“Isn’t it crazy?“ Sherlock uttered once they were sitting on the couch in the evening, finishing their dinner.
Sherlock squirms in his seat. “I am doing... nothing special. You’d do the same for me. As a matter of fact you’ve been taking care of me since the very beginning. From that very first day, from that very afternoon on January twenty nine, you’ve been…
Three. God, how much John wants to kiss him now. The crinkle between his eyebrows, the tip of his nose, his pinkish cheeks, his
“Fine, then,“ Sherlock pouted, giving a surrendering nod. “But let me have a question, last one, people do that, don’t they?
“You think I didn’t learn anything?“ John growled, not drifting his gaze away from his wife. “I’ve been following you since you left Baker Street.“
“Yes, of course. And I am sorry again,” Lidia gives a small nervous nod and turns to leave. Only once after her footsteps die down Sherlock shuts the door and with a heavy sigh turns to John.
, we're not supposed to check out for another five days, so... We might as well... I thought we could perhaps, you know, make the best of the situation and... er... take a break from stalking people and solving crimes and whatnot and simply... enjoy Spain like regular people do?”
Sherlock’s cheeks practically burn from embarrassment. He gapes like a carp for an achingly long while before uttering another word.
Sherlock is quite certain he must be blushing embarrassingly hard at the moment but he tries to ignore it. Fortunately enough, John’s tender hand on his back helps so he can collect himself, turning each of his insecurities into dust.
“Fuck, Sherlock, look at you, look at you, beautiful, so beautiful and - my God, you feel so good, so wonderful-“
Sherlock utters no words but John suspects that if it wasn’t for the cloth covering his eyes, he would be giving him the filthiest look right now. It’s hypnotising, watching Sherlock’s mouth closing around his fingers, tongue briskly twisting around each one of them, each such a contact making John crave for those luscious lips more and more until Sherlock’s moans turn so needy so it gets impossible trying to keep their mouths apart.
For the first time John avoided Sherlock’s eyes, simply because the brief mention of what happened between them. But instead of changing the subject he rather combed Sherlock’s curls off his forehead so he could sterilize the last remaining wound on his face.
Much to Sherlock and Mary’s astonishment, John Watson stepped out of the shadows from behind Mary’s back, with a gun in his left hand, gun which has been left pointing at his wife. He paid no attention to Sherlock but it was just to make sure that Mary won’t make any wrong move.
Sherlock seemed to succeed in shielding his heart so no signs of hurt or grief emerged upon the surface. He was so determined to not expose any kind of weakness that he appeared to be emotionless, a trick that fortunately didn’t work on John anymore. Had it been someone else they would look upon Sherlock with contempt but John knew very well that underneath that sharp, pale mask there was a small, fragile man with a broken heart who needed help even though he so vehemently refused to admit it. No amount of bitter remarks could convince John about the opposite.
“Oh my, boys,“ she giggled, seemingly not even surprised by John’s presence nor Sherlock’s face covered in plasters. “You should’ve locked the doors if you were-“
As far as he can tell, Sherlock doesn't seem to be exactly composed either. Might be for a whole different reason though...
John opened his mouth a few times but he couldn’t come up with any words to contradict Mycroft’s. He’d love to stop denying that he and Sherlock were now a couple but in the same he still didn’t feel like coming out in front of everyone at once. He needed much more time to take that step. So in order to not accidentally hurt Sherlock he rather stayed quiet. Mycroft seemed to be well aware of the truth anyway.
And as he does, we hear a ring - John's phone, lying atop the table, next to the newspapers. He throws a glance at the device, but ignores it.
Funny you say that, because I've been wondering. If by any chance, you'd like to... get married... again.
“Oh, God, you-“ John shakes his head, laughing before kissing Sherlock yet again, yet again so slowly so they can both savour the contact but Sherlock pulls back after a short moment, tittering quietly against John’s lips.
Sherlock’s moan echoed loudly in the small bathroom, once, twice and then again when John grabbed his hair and pulled his head backwards, exposing his neck so to leave another purple mark in the pale skin. His other hand was still roaming dangerously close toward Sherlock’s erection, drawing circles over his inner thigh but still far enough so Sherlock had to beg for more in order to get it, unwilling to stay patient any longer.
“No, I am fine, more than fine,“ John smiles, grinning from ear to ear. Sherlock can hear it in his voice rather than see, feigning interest in the tree in front of him instead of looking at John, for he fears that the moment their eyes meet again he might do something entirely ludicrous.
“You say the same thing about eating,” John murmurs, closing his eyes, feeling so tired he can barely keep them open. “And the Solar System. And singing... Come to think of it, is there
“Oh, shush,” John snorts and gently smacks Sherlock's chest. “You're just... fucking perfect, okay?”
-slowly, the door opens, only ever so slightly. Through the gap we see a silhouette of a woman, wearing a thin black veil. Ms. Ronder.
“John? John, you okay?“ Sherlock had the other man safely in his arms sooner John even managed to ask for help. “God, why do you have to act like-“
gently, reducing John's vocabulary to a cacophony of whimpers and groans. At this rate, they're not even going to make it to the bed...
Sherlock could barely swallow through lump in this throat. He heard the shrill of the gun firing, John shouting his name, over and over again, like a broken gramophone, streams of blood sloping through his fingers again and then there was
!“ Sherlock gasped, hesitating no more to close the gap between them. He couldn’t bear to listen to John diminishing his own importance like that for any longer.
torturing me this way. Once he returned with them in the afternoon- God, John. I can’t even believe I’ve agreed on that one of them is going to stay. What is the purpose? Even if Mary
“Yeah, it was quite a day,“ John sighed in bliss, staring off into the empty space as if he was replaying the memories in his head.
“All right, then,” he breathes out at last, trying to pay no attention to all the ways his body is responding to the fact that he is about to
“Sherlock, whatever it is you’ve been through, if you have told me what you were planning to do, I would’ve gone with you, I would’ve protected you-“
together again,“ John stuttered, ignoring the cold sweat that had flushed his face. All the courage gone, indeed.
“God, you’re so naive, Sherlock,“ Mary hissed, grip around her gun tightening. “You expect I am not going to shoot you?“
And he was right. John just shook his head again and shut his eyes for a second as if to stop the tears at all cost. He didn't want to break down in front of Sherlock.
On John's face again, contemplative, wondering what might have caused such a sudden change in Sherlock's behaviour...
John, walking down the hallway. Once in the sitting room, he puts the phone next to his ear. He's keeping his voice down, a tad anxious.
“If you wanted to have a chat we could’ve gone and have a cup of coffee, sit down or whatever people do while chatting,“ Sherlock uttered, mock seriously. “What is this charade good for?“
Instinctively, he looks around the room, expecting to find John. Much to his confusion... he's alone.
Sherlock isn't of a much different opinion. Once he emerges from the bedroom again, he's carrying not only a small bag in his hand but a sour expression upon his face. As he walks by John, he scowls even more as if discontent with something, then gives John a confused look. “Why are you not packed yet?”
“Don’t look at me like that, Sherlock, you are the genius here,“ she grumbled, stomping off the flat.
“Fine, as you wish,“ John shrugged in capitulation. “If you don’t want to talk about it,then I have no right pushing you. Do you want me to leave you alone?“
“Then maybe we should stop talking, don’t you think?“ John smirked, angling his face so he could lock their lips again. Sherlock smiled into the kiss, this time reaching up to cup John’s cheeks instead of leaving his hands lie idle. John could only hardly mind that Sherlock appeared to be such an unpractised kisser. Maybe he was a little clumsy, not opening his mouth enough and he definitely didn’t know how to use his tongue properly but he was kissing back with such unbelievable passion and love that John simply had no heart breaking the kiss to teach him how to do it better. Besides, he didn’t even care actually. He was kissing Sherlock; Sherlock who’s just told him he loves him, Sherlock whose lips John yearned to taste since the moment he laid his eyes upon them for the first time.
“Yeah, yeah, s-sure,“ Sherlock stuttered, taking a brief moment to come back to himself. “What – what was I saying?“
“Well, but that’s why we called upon your brother, didn’t we?“ John smiled, relieved that Sherlock finally decided to listen to him. He turned around toward Mycroft who was purposefully looking the other way.
Just as their lips touched, Sherlock plain froze for a second there but quickly enough perceived again and immediately started kissing back. They could have been kissing for half an hour and wouldn't realise, completely immersed in the moment. John gently wiped Sherlock's tears away as they kissed, while Sherlock grabbed the lapels of John's shirt and pulled him down on the sofa. It wasn't until much later that they broke the kiss but even once after they did, they couldn't stop brushing their lips and noses.
want you to kiss me, John,“ Sherlock tittered sheepishly. “I told you, it’s all right. More than all right. I’ve been waiting for years for my first real kiss. Hoping, wishing.“
“Don’t feel obliged to say that you love me just because I’ve already confessed my love to you,“ Sherlock cut him off. “I know how difficult it must be for you. As you said once, we don’t need to hurry anywhere.“
“Well, sure you didn’t. I did my best to hide my obsession with you,“ John tittered but Sherlock didn’t find any of that funny, not at all.
A smile that morphed into a wry crook as soon as John shifted again, the moment he noticed that someone had been occupying the spot on the further side of the sofa. At first he was disoriented, blinking to open his eyes only slowly, Sherlock’s pale face being the first thing he recognised. Sherlock looked nowhere near as haggard as the day before but there was no spark in his eyes but sorrow, hidden behind the thin layers of blue.
Sherlock seemed to be so convinced of the trueness of that statement, so much so John actually had to decide not keeping his thoughts and feelings for himself only anymore, despite being so unsure whether it was right to give away anything just yet.
Sherlock takes a moment to savour that smile, then smirks, leaning forward in his seat. “Such a shame. I would
Having Sherlock so close, the voice inside John’s head practically begs him to close the remaining gap between them and lock their lips. No matter how alluring the temptation though, John refuses to give into it just yet, not under such circumstances.
Needless to say, I had to pull a few strings. Typically, the annulment process takes months, you insisted the matter was resolved within a few days. Not to mention, in the absence of the spouse.
Sherlock’s heart was beating so fast that if he was the one being monitored, all those funny machines would most likely explode due to overheating. And John didn’t even say anything that cataclysmal yet.
“Sherlock-“ John rubbed his forehead, glancing down at the carpet for a moment before meeting Sherlock's eyes again. “I
“Fine… if I must,“ Sherlock rolled his eyes, leaving out another tiny whimper. “First of all, it’s hardly my fault there was a window in my way.“
“Why would I?” Sherlock giggles again, a bit breathlessly still, then strokes his hand up John's shaft, rubs his thumb over the tip and then down again to fold and massage his balls.
Sherlock’s mind goes blank for a second time already that evening, refusing to cooperate. He's having a difficult time comprehending why is John doing what he’s doing, but risking no awkward conversations in public he decides to not question John about it.
“Well then,“ John cleared his throat, still not over the sudden loss of proximity. “I should rather… go upstairs and unpack or something.“
Lestrade stares with his mouth wide open, hopelessly flicking his eyes between John and Sherlock, who have seemed to forgot that they are in public.
“Mhm, I am sure there are quite a few other things you'd like me to do, though...” Sherlock lowers his eyes and licks his lips but before he is able to finish his sentence, John shifts around in his arms and pushes him against the tiled wall. Never breaking the eye contact, he drops to his knees, leans in and lets the tip of Sherlock's cock slip between his parted lips. Just a taste of what is about to come.
He can't help it, he doesn't even pause to think of the consequences. In the heat of the moment, John reaches to grab Sherlock by the back of his neck and pulls him into another, a far more spontaneous kiss. Stunned, Sherlock forgets to close his eyes for a second but once his mind clicks and he fully perceives, his eyes flutter shut and he begins to kiss back with as much fervor as John.
The moment John turned over to settle into a more comfortable position, the bathroom door were opened in front of his eyes and Sherlock stepped into the room, nothing but a towel loosely wrapped around his waist, his skin glistening in the dim light. John forgot how to breathe for a second. He had seen Sherlock like this before, half-naked, bare chested, his hair ruffled but never before it was Sherlock fresh out of the shower, droplets of water still dripping down his marble-like body. John had to admit that he looked even more beautiful than before.
“Yes. But first-“ Sherlock pursed his lip as he leaned in for a peck. “I feel like I should make up for leaving you alone in the bed this morning,“ he muttered under his breath. “Let’s hope ten minutes of kissing won’t cost us our lives,“ he tittered, raising up from the chair and putting his hands on John’s waist as he gently pushed him further into the room.
“No. I just…I am keep making two, you know, just in case,“ Sherlock smiled softly. He mirrored John’s position and slouched down into his chair in front of that of John’s own. Their eyes met, but neither of them said a word. John took a sip from his mug, not leaving Sherlock’s eyes and so Sherlock had a chance to spot that shimmer of surprise and flattery when John realised it is his favourite tea he’s drinking - earl grey green, no sugar, right amount of cream and a light touch of a cinnamon.
“All right, fine,” Sherlock mutters with a resigned sigh, the look that John has just given him enough to persuade him. He gives John a peck, climbs out of the bed and rushes to answer the door but John's little startled gasp thwarts him again before he manages to reach the hallway.
But then John reaches to spray some cream over Sherlock’s chest and Sherlock’s gleeful giggles once again morph into deep, raspy growls. John’s mouth closes around one of Sherlock’s nipples, sucking off the foam and teasing with the tip of his tongue, his hands now caressing up and down Sherlock’s torso, smearing the chocolate and cream all over his smooth skin. Until finally John kisses up Sherlock’s neck, cradling his face and giving him one of the longest, messiest kisses that leave them both breathless but even more greedy.
“I apologise for this completely inappropriate behaviour of my younger brother. However, I just spoke to the doctors and they see no problem in Sherlock paying his friend a short visit. I can assure you that this man here poses no threat for the man behind this door.“
But John wasn’t mad at Sherlock, there was no reason at all. He was stupendously flattered and in that single moment feeling more contented he ever felt during those past months he spent with Mary. More contented than ever before actually. Even though, despite all the odds, he had to admit that he’d prefer the flat in its good old fashion.
feel about you. I was keeping it for myself, safely locked inside, just because I thought you wouldn’t be able to feel the same, John. But then you told me the entire truth, you came out and yeah, I freaked out because … what I thought was never meant to happen was suddenly very close and possible from becoming reality and frankly, I can only hardly believe it. “
“That’s-that's not the answer to what I asked you.“ Sherlock mirrored John's stance, trying desperately to ignore how frantically his heart was pounding.
“Oh, I hated that scarf, John-“ Sherlock utters, silly smile on his lips so John would stop feeling so guilty. “Until of course you put it into a much better use. It’s such a shame we’ll have to use a different one next time.“
“You’re not going to keep them on for much longer, don’t worry,“ John snickers, finally climbing over Sherlock’s body before settling himself on his stomach, rocking his hips a little so Sherlock very quickly realises that he is not the only one feeling so tight in his pants.
“Besides, another good news is that we will have plenty of time for ourselves, Sherlock. Now that you gave up on chasing…
No one has ever mattered for me more than you. I can’t believe I am going to say this out loud but… if-if I had known how important I was for you, if I knew how deeply you care about, me I would have never, baby or not, I would have
Sherlock was a mere disruption, John. Magnussen... He was the target. Must have had an awful lot of dirt on your ex-wife, possibly attempted to blackmail her... I assume her plan was to get rid of him that night... Unfortunately, my brother happened to be in a wrong place at a wrong time.
Under any other circumstances, John wouldn’t worry that bad. Sherlock used to disappear from time to time, without a word and sometimes even for hours. But considering that Mary was still out there, free and extremely dangerous, John would feel more at peace if Sherlock at least informed him what he was up to.
“Sorry,“ John chuckled, his voice breathy and filled with impatience. “I sort of… ran out of clean shirts of mine.“
“I see you've been refurnishing too,” John remarked once after noticing the empty spot in front of the fireplace. His heart broke at the notion that Sherlock had decided to remove his chair but on the other hand, he should have prepared to expect unexpected.
Closer on John as he reaches the door, comes to a halt. He's still listening, his face somewhat saddens, his voice drops.
Sherlock’s smile happens to be so insufferably lovely, John can’t help but lean closer and kiss his cheek once again, this time letting his lips to linger for a little while before he pulls back.
He heads towards Sherlock's bed, his steps unsure, when suddenly there is a phone ring. Fumbling, John reaches for his phone.
Jerking his head toward the other side of the room, John points at the bearded man who seems to be indulged in a conversation with two younger women. Sherlock throws a glance over his shoulder, then quickly turns back to John, visibly agitated.
“No, that’s not what I - not at all,“ John blinked in confusion. “I-I just think that it’s not – it’s not right, it’s not
Sherlock automatically parts his lips, allowing John to put one another piece of food between his teeth, ready to immediately make the right guess, but he’s rendered speechless as soon as he takes the bite. And not even because his mouth is now full of honey. He’s positive he’s never before tasted a sweeter chunk of apple in his life, not admitting it aloud naturally but John can tell anyway, thanks to the teeny pleased noises Sherlock’s currently making.
With a shy little chuckle John tackles him down on the mattress again and settles himself on top, their lips several inches apart and limbs tangled. There's but one thing they're both yearning for. Ever so slowly, John begins to roll his hips, rubbing their cocks and making Sherlock moan and writhe uncontrollably beneath him.
It’s like Sherlock expects to be rejected any second now. Once their eyes meet again, John can see that he’s got the faintest blush upon his cheeks.
“I am not sure what kind of a move you expected me to make, John,“ Sherlock frowned, eyes fixed on the floor at first as if he couldn’t bear to look directly in John’s eyes just yet, feeling ashamed and guilty. “I didn’t think you needed to be
“There’s no use lying to me, Sherlock, I know you better than yourself. You claim your heart is not important, yet when it comes to John you-“
“In the sea? No.” Sherlock makes a disgruntled grimace, the mere concept seems to be repulsing him. “Salt water makes my skin itch. I’d be happy to have a swim in the ginormous swimming pool outside the hotel and if the opportunity arises, I will. But today, the plan is to lie on the shore and do nothing at all.”
“I’ve always knew you two had a thing for each other,“ she giggled, her eyes filled with glee. “Oh, John, I am sorry your marriage didn’t work out, but you do have to admit that Sherlock is the one you belong to,“ she addressed the older of the men but despite the words she said, she sounded like she wasn’t sorry at all. In fact Mrs Hudson seemed to be glad that John and Mary parted ways, even though she had no idea what horrible events preceded this separation.
Sherlock stiffened, not even because John has seen him sleeping, which was embarrassing enough itself, but what Sherlock considered much more awkward was the fact that his hand was still laid over John’s. Maybe John didn’t notice until then, maybe what Sherlock felt before was just a dream and John never stroked his hand but then again, he didn’t brush it off either and so Sherlock just stared helplessly at their now entwined fingers.
Once he finally reached the first floor he was surprised to find Sherlock in the sitting room, turned away so he seemed to be gazing through the window again.
Under perfectly normal circumstances, John would agree to that without a missing a beat. But these are clearly not perfectly normal circumstances.
Sherlock has made dozens attempts to reach out to him in the past few months but each one of them was vehemently ignored. John hasn’t been the same man lately, not ever since the incident that has so irrevocably changed his life. He has shut himself off from Sherlock, seeking loneliness, convinced that the fight he has to endure he has to endure all by himself. But as it turns out, it’s a fight he’s slowly losing, failing at beating the demons that have been tormenting him for such a long time. Much to Sherlock’s horror.
“Arrogant little prick, your boyfriend,“ the man in the front seat grumbled, staring scornfully at Sherlock’s receding silhouette. At first he thought he must’ve misheard but the quite repulsed look on the driver’s face was enough to prove that John had indeed heard everything right and clear.
“When were you planning on to tell John?“ Mary asked, turning Sherlock’s concentration back to herself.
“You took your time,“ she proceeded to say, pointing at Sherlock’s phone then. “Oh, you won’t need that anymore.“ She reached for a little switch on the wall and turn on the little flash bulb above her head, filling the little space around them with more vivid light.
The client chair - An eccentric man in his 40s sitting in it. John and Sherlock sitting in their respective armchairs.
Fifteen minutes later they’re sitting at the wicker table on the balcony, a tray of neatly arranged breakfast and two still steaming cups of coffee between them. But while John has already loaded his plate with food, Sherlock seems to be having a hard time deciding whether to put jam or cheese on his toast.
“John is happy, Sherlock,“ Mary uttered as if she wasn’t even listening to him, as it was a fact. “Why would you try to destroy it by infecting his mind with things he could live on his life without even knowing? If I am not going to stop you and you tell him the truth, it will be
“Well, I certainly didn't expect you to get engaged to somebody else,” Sherlock retorted but just as the words escaped his mouth, he instantly regretted it. He couldn't have failed more miserably if he tried. John's eyes widened at that but he could all but gawk at Sherlock, speechless and profoundly perplexed.
On Sherlock's face, as he falls to the floor. Zooming out - we realise he is lying on the floor of 221B. Bleeding out - similar to the opening scene.
Sherlock froze in the doorway, he expected John would ask questions, but he had nothing convincing enough to say, at least nothing that wouldn’t raise any suspicions.
Sherlock stops typing. Looks at her, gazing intently, as he does when trying to make a deduction. Noticing this, Dr. Mason freaks a little.
“Why of course,“ John nodded affirmatively, trotting back with a handful of blankets he’d brought from Sherlock’s bedroom. “If I’d left just as you asked me you wouldn’t go – wherever it is you were – you wouldn’t be in such an awful condition. Look at you, you –“
“We don't have to go anywhere, you know,” he remarks, talking to the carpet for a moment before he meets John's eyes again. “If you don't want to.”
“What? Rushed? Look, it’s been barely sixteen hours since I was shot and here I am, leading a conversation with you.“
“I can’t complain, had worse in my life,“ John shrugged before passing by Sherlock and leaving the room.
The water streaming down their bodies was so hot so the entire room has been almost immediately filled with thick, heavy steam, temperature rising so high so it made their hearts race. Sherlock tilted his head, stretching his neck and so letting John suck and lick, letting the water pour down his face, string of euphoric moans fleeing from his throat. Noises almost as passionate as his movements that soon turned so wild and frantic so John was sure that he would come any second if he didn’t grasp his thighs, putting an abrupt end to it.
John blinked at Sherlock, then gave a mock-serious nod as though in agreement. “Of course, of course, I almost forgot. I am just your dumb, little friend – sorry, cardboard cut-out - that occasionally takes notes. I could never comprehend the secrets of your ingenious mind.”
“Will you have another dance with me now, please?“ John asked once breaking their lips, sparks twinkling in his eyes.
Sherlock seemed to be quite concerned, noticing how John tensed up all of a sudden, but he smiled nevertheless, deciding to not dwell upon the subject. “I know you will. Thank you, John. But don’t you dare to not sleep yourself,“ he added. “You don’t have to patrol the whole night.“
Sherlock knew he should look John in the eyes and admit what he’s been feeling since as long as he can remember, but what would be the purpose? Sherlock was still pretty sure that John would laugh him off if he learnt about his feelings. When he thought that he was losing John forever he would do it without hesitating but right now when the time has come and he had a chance to confess, it suddenly didn’t seem like the wisest idea. But telling John that what he said in front of Mary, not even being aware of his presence, was all just a farce, that wasn’t an option either. So here he was, Sherlock had to lay all the cards on the table.
Sherlock flashed him a grin, making no other sound but a high pitched moan, clinging to John’s shoulders so hard he was leaving marks in his skin. He opened his mouth to goad John a little but John was already drawing back, quickly coating his cock before lifting Sherlock’s legs and thrusting into him for the first time.
, Sherlock,“ he explains. “I don’t think I am fully prepared yet but will I ever really be? How does one prepare to face the world, looking like I do?“
“Yeah? I bet they didn’t suffer as much as I would make them, Sherlock. Why didn’t you tell me sooner?“
Calm down John. I am going to spare you the sight of your boyfriend writhing in agony when I paint these walls with his blood.
“I told you he’d be here,” Sherlock nods toward the couple that’s just showed up strolling down the beach.
That horrid weather had actually reminded him of the night that happened so long as if it was during a past, different life they lived those days. It was a night they spent with John on the couch, tangled in blankets, laughing and eating leftovers of meal that could have been left in the fridge for days, but neither of them seemed to mind. There was a massive black out, it’s been cold and raining for days but Sherlock was in the middle of a case, first big one after solving the case of the Baskerville Hound and so he naturally refused to take a break even though all the odds were against him.
“See? She’s got a personal motive now, a couple of ones in fact. And besides, she’s nothing like Moriarty or Magnussen, they had plans how to destroy innocent masses of people, through one way or another. They’ve tormented but they were never willing to get their own hands dirty with blood. Mary is far worse,“ John said in a broken voice, a voice that was filled with so much worry and even fear that Sherlock’s eyes welled up for a second.
Angelo's restaurant, from A STUDY IN PINK. Sherlock and John seated at a table. Enjoying a romantic dinner - italian, two glasses of wine, candle burning in between them.
A desperate scream escaped his throat, he was crying for help until his throat was sore and every uttered word hurt and he could barely draw a breath. But nothing hurt as much as the sight of John’s life slipping in between his fingers. Nothing could cause him more pain than a possibility of John Watson being gone forever.  So he was keep going, trying to bring him back to earth, but his body betrayed him. It was shaking, quivering, Sherlock could merely control the movement of his hands, not least stop the tears that were flowing down his cheeks in streams.
think, John. Now,“ Sherlock clapped his hands. “What if you stopped whining and had a tea with me instead?“
decision. Sooner or later, I’d have to leave this place anyway. Postponing the moment will make it only more difficult. I have to
Mary ran away right after the gun slipped out of her hand in horror. From what Sherlock could conclude, she apparently decided to go for his heart as she intended to, but her aim must’ve stray out of the focus when John so unawares jumped in front of her target. The gun she used was also the same one that fired a bullet at Magnussen’s office, that was clear, but not any helpful at all.
“But I-“ Sherlock was about to raise an objection but in the end he’d rather admit that what John proposed was actually a much better idea. “Fine, as you wish,“ he exhaled, leaning in for another kiss. “Just-just hold me,
much, John. The reason why I didn’t want to talk about our future even once you were already home was that I was just so scared, yes, I
“I told you, you don’t have to be embarrassed, Sherlock,“ John uttered in rather a serious tone, but then suddenly he found the whole situation so amusingly bizarre that he couldn’t prevent a snigger from escaping his throat.
He was so lost in his thoughts so he didn’t even notice that he wasn’t alone any longer. He didn’t perceive until John piped up, his soft albeit exhausted voice snapping him out of brooding.
“That’s a mail, John,“ Sherlock replied but avoided John’s eyes, since feeling a little guilty for disrupting the atmosphere. “Three mails in fact. She’s not done yet as it seems.“
“Your-your shirt?“ Sherlock blinked and swallowed then opened his mouth but asked no more questions. They slowed down all of a sudden, as if they weren’t even about to devour each other’s faces few moments earlier. John let Sherlock grip and strip off the cloth, chuckling shyly once Sherlock seemed like he forgot how to breathe as his eyes glided over John’s bare chest. Not that he’d never before seen John shirtless, but it happened just a few times and it was a short, barely a glimpse of moment. John used to be insecure about his body and whenever Sherlock accidentally seen him half-naked he’d rather quickly stormed out or kicked Sherlock out of the room but since they were now together there was naturally no reason. John didn’t even mind that they acted as teenagers who were experiencing this kind of contact for the very first time. He wanted to enjoy each moment with Sherlock, take it slowly so he could remember every second of them kissing and touching each other.
Sherlock had to admit that there was indeed something pretty fishy about all of this, but he had no intentions of showcasing a doubt in front of his brother who seemed to be rather determined to stop him from doing anything stupid again.
“I've never wanted a relationship, I deemed it all but a meaningless distraction. And frankly, I've never met anyone that I'd like to be particularly intimate with anyway. But then I met
how you want to cope?“ he made a vague gesture with his hand to put an emphasis on his words. “Sherlock, I just want to help you. I am – I am worried about you, please-“
“Enough to say that this person I no longer consider my wife,“ John groaned, looking daggers at the woman. “I
“And I bought milk,“ Sherlock grinned so proudly it made John chuckle. “There’s also a bottle or two of your favourite beer,“ he added, his brow furrowing upon trying to remember the contents of the purchase he made earlier that morning.
You are so much more than your brain. You've always been and I've always known. Sherlock, you... You have the kindest of hearts. You're caring, you're tender even though you scarcely show it. You help people who deserve to be helped and never ask for anything in return. See, these thoughts... these nightmares that invade your mind, do not define you. Don't trust anything they say, it's all lies.
Sherlock predicted that Mary must be already there. Maybe hiding behind one of the corners, ready to kill without Sherlock even noticing where did the bullet come from. In that case, John would have to make another speech at his grave but this time Sherlock wouldn’t have a chance to grant another miracle for him.
Sherlock opens his mouth only to shut it tight, absently fiddling with the hem of his coat. John insisted he should keep it this time and for once Sherlock’s glad he listened. And not because of cold. Without his coat, his armour he wears to protect his vulnerable self, his heart that beats so fast now, so close to John, he’d feel almost naked.
,“ Sherlock nodded, barely able to pronounce the word because of the knot in his throat. The room had been filled with a heavy silence for a couple of minutes before Sherlock was able to continue talking about himself in such an open way. What he’s just revealed were basically his most treasured secrets, something he thought he would never be able to share with anyone else. This side of him he had tried to keep hidden for years, not even in front of John he’d ever shown his softer self even though John was well aware of its existence, he knew there must be a warm open face hiding somewhere beneath that thick cold mask. He wasn’t wrong, yet whenever Sherlock uncovered this face he needed a little time to process what was happening. Sentiment wasn’t Sherlock’s cup of coffee after all.
“Anyway... I thought of ordering breakfast to the room,“ he says, never mind that he, in fact, didn't think of it until he needed an excuse to change the subject yet again. “Anything special on your mind?”
Oh, John, don't be silly. Of course he will. He'll be ecstatic to marry you. Remember how excited he was to plan your first wedding? And he wasn't even the one you were getting married to!
Sherlock, however, didn’t blame John for being so curious. Sherlock himself had gone to great lengths just so he’d dug information about John’s past. But such an atrocious, ugly, so excruciatingly painful truth
“I am sorry, okay? I am just not sure if you’re prepared to hear the worst about her,“ Sherlock said.
On John. Still hesitating. It takes him a few seconds of struggling to compose himself and reply. Finally, he looks back at Sherlock. Takes a deep breath, as if to brace himself. Clearly, it pains him, talking about this.
“Well, I am here to take care of you,“ John smiled fondly. “But if you think that’s too weak of me-“
Sherlock is scrambling up to his feet. He steps toward Lestrade and John. Lifts his hand to show them - something almost invisible he's holding in between his index finger and his thumb.
Drawing a shaky breath, full of untamed emotions, he at first peered over the wall on his left. The wall they leaned against and giggled hard, for what was one of the very first times. Then his sight fell upon the staircase and John couldn’t help but smile shyly, absorbing himself in the memory that just unfolded itself before his eyes. He and Sherlock, a little tipsy, falling asleep, lying in that anything but comfortable position side by side. John couldn’t remember how the hell they ended up like that, but he did his best to never forget that moment. Even though they were drunk and later that night they got arrested. John didn’t even mind.
“Are you by any chance practicing flirting with me?” Sherlock smiles, a hint of playfulness in his voice.
Sherlock shifted even closer, slowly, warily lifting up his left hand and then putting it down on the mattress next to John’s. He wasn’t even sure what on Earth he was doing right now but he was certain of that it was something he desired to do for ages, ever since the first night they spent together chasing criminals.
“Of course. Oh, and by the way, no one will find your body, don’t worry,“ she added with a crooked grin. “Poor you,“ she laughed. “You thought you can outsmart me?“
“Did I mention you're beautiful?” John smiles, unable to tear his eyes off Sherlock's gorgeous naked body. He is a masterpiece, the highest form of art. Being allowed to touch him, to kiss him, to make love to him... it's a privilege John couldn't ever dream of having.
Wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders, he immediately leans in for another kiss, which, however, results in mere bumping of lips, for neither of them can seem to be able to stop smiling.
John didn’t notice when Sherlock got up from the couch but once he snapped out of daydreaming he realised that the other man was no longer sitting beside him. Sherlock had grabbed the plates and cutlery and took them to the kitchen so he could clean them. John followed him, not even considering maintaining a reasonable distance between them as he stepped closer. He put a hand on Sherlock’s upper waist and stroked gently while Sherlock was busy rinsing his plate.
,” John groaned, throwing his arms in the air. That was the last straw. Heartbroken and exasperated, he started to head toward the stairs, determined to leave but just before reaching the door, he turned on his heels again and pointed his shaking finger at Sherlock.
because of what I have put on my blog, are you?” he finally utters after a moment, but the red in his cheek doesn't fade.
“Sherlock, just because you’re done making your way into a trap… God, that doesn’t mean you’re safe,“ John uttered. “Think about all those messages. She clearly wants you dead, whatever the cost.“
... John can't but giggle at that question. Turning to face Sherlock, he steals a single kiss from his lips, then takes his left hand and brings it slowly towards his crotch. The mere contact sends a wave of raw pleasure throughout his body, it's almost too much and still not nearly enough at the same time.
Sherlock only very reluctantly sank back down on the chair. He kept his eyes locked firmly on John’s face from then on, ready to intervene if there was any need. But John seemed to be fine enough and determined to keep on asking questions as Sherlock proposed.
Sherlock snapped at the lady who answered him sooner she managed to ask a question, but despite him trying to cool down right after, he could barely explain what happened, his voice cracked more than just once and on the verge of tears it was anything but easy to offer only the truly important information.
They arrive at the beach shortly before noon and quickly find just the right spot to lay a blanket, relatively far from where the rest of the people are sunbathing. John, however, notices that Harrington himself doesn’t seem to be among them.
