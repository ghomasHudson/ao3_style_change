Cas sighed. “The others had billions of years to get their power under control before they ever had to try to fit themselves in a human vessel. Jack kept this one safe for me, because—well, I suppose I got used to it. But it was a long time before I could wear it without ripping it apart.”
He’d found it again, usually in the thrill of the hunt, but that excitement never quite matched the pure joy of that first drive. It was always tempered by fear, or anger, or disgust at whatever it was he had to do.
“God, I love a repair shop,” he said, leaning against the wall next to Cas, so close that their arms nearly touched. “I tell you, man, if I wasn’t hunter? This’d be the life for me.”
Dean smiled tightly, then looked down at their grasped hands. “I like your tattoo,” he said, his voice impossible to read. The tattoo on his forearm was of a massive, black anchor, with the name ‘Sarah’ spelled in cursive down the middle. Cas thought it was ugly as hell.
With a quick nod to Cas—Bill’s first acknowledgement that he was even there—he went off to see to Baby. Dean walked over to the register and let Chris check him out, but at no point did he take his eye off Bill, who had ducked under her hood, had his hands in her engine. There was something in the narrowing of Dean’s eyes, the twist of his mouth. Cas thought it might be revulsion.
Cas set his jaw. He knew how he looked, in Jimmy Novak’s body. Sam had once said he looked like a substitute teacher. Fine. That didn’t bother him, because he knew what he really was, even if Sam and Dean insisted on forgetting.
Cas watched him for a minute or two, before starting, realizing he’d never really responded to Dean. But when he turned back to him, he saw that Dean was watching the boss mechanic too. Cas couldn’t see the look on his face, but there was something off about his stillness. He kept his eyes on Dean as the boss came over to them and held out his hand to shake Dean’s. Dean took it.
Sam was standing at the edge of the trees, at the head of a path Cas hadn’t noticed the day before, clearly out for a morning run. He caught sight of Cas.
Cas would walk up to him quietly, place his hand on his shoulder, feel the shoulder tense, then relax, beneath his touch.
part of Cas’ body that was usually covered in all those layers. He slid his hands up, then down, running his thumbs along the panes of his chest. He let his eyes stray downward, to where he could see Cas straining against the front of his slacks.
He led the way into the house, flipping on the lights and grabbing two more beers as he passed through the kitchen and into the dining room. He sat at the head of the table and gestured to Cas to sit right next to him. The angel looked troubled.
Dean felt those words ring out in his soul the way they always did. The way they did when he went to sleep, when he swung his axe, when he drove his car. It never left him alone, the memory of that gravelly, beloved voice saying what Dean had never even admitted to himself that he wanted to hear.
loved in return? To have unfettered love pouring out of Dean’s eyes, and know that it was all for Cas? Cas knew he could spend the rest of his long, long life trying to catalogue, to define this feeling, and he never could. He didn’t even try. He breathed it in. Basked in it. Felt the tears lining his eyes and let them come.
Next time. Dean swallowed. So maybe this wouldn’t be a final goodbye then. He’d wondered, the longer Cas stayed away, whether the angel had been glad to be rid of him—whether he would come back, as he always did, but only to say goodbye for good. Whether his new life at Jack’s right hand had made him realize that whatever feelings he thought he’d had for some messed-up human were really just the confusion and adrenaline of all the battles they’d fought together, building up until it seemed like there was something there that wasn’t.
“Wait, are you telling me that good monsters can come to Heaven now? And be cured of their… monsteriness?”
The knife in Dean’s hand would flash, mutilating his victims further, but the blood that coated him wasn’t just theirs. With every word they said to him, a fresh cut would open up on Dean’s own body, oozing blood down his arms, his legs, his face. Soon the only clean skin to be found on him was in the tracks his tears made through the blood on his cheeks.
“Somehow, those breaks weren’t long enough for you to pop in and let me know you were ok. That you were alive. That you even fucking gave a damn.”
He wanted to believe those words were still true. But it had been so long. Dean knew how he still felt, but Cas? He was something new now. He’d been ‘reforged.’ What if the love he’d felt for Dean had been burned right out of him during his long shift into archangel? What if that’s what he’d come to tell him—that a powerful cosmic entity like him couldn’t be expected to waste his time with a washed-up former hunter.
Cas waited for Dean to appear in the opposite door. In the meantime, he scanned the den and the rest of the house that he could see for any sign of anyone else, but all signs pointed to Bill living alone. Good. Cas hoped he was lonely. His eyes flicked back again and again to the beefy forearm and hand he could see resting on the arm of the recliner, the barest glimpse of that tattoo peaking from beneath his rolled-up sleeve.
Ever since he’d met the Winchesters and begun his long fall away from Heaven, feelings had been sparking into life with greater and greater frequency and power. Cas was too often at a loss for how to interpret them.
Dean looked, and his face went blank for a moment in shock. Pooling out from the house, stretching to the edge of the ridge and around the sides of the house for as far as they could see, were waves of flowers in full bloom. Sunflowers and daisies and pansies and tulips and roses and irises and bluebells and flowers that Cas couldn’t even name. They climbed and twined atop one another, seeking the sun. Rose bushes snaked up the columns of the porch. The breeze coming up from the valley ruffled the flowers, bringing with it a heavenly smell.
Cas knew that he was no expert in human emotions, but he had the distinct impression that these tears were
Dean smiled. “Good. Sam and Eileen have got a house on the next ridge over—maybe a ten-minute walk. They didn’t build theirs though. Would have taken their attention away from reading all the lost lore books they can find and talking to ancient hunters about how they managed to kill werewolves before bullets were a thing.”
Dean kept walking, breathing hard, but with clear eyes at last. The wildness that had set in as he watched Bill put his hands in Baby back in the shop had gone out of them now, and he simply looked tired. Bill continued his ravings as they made their way through the kitchen. Cas had just made it to the door, when Dean stopped, looking at something on the table.
There was nothing to fight here, no new traumas to heap on top of all the other bullshit that festered inside him. There was just time and space to take each old hurt out, one by one, remember it, deal with it, and let it go. It had taken time, but he had plenty of that, and no other ways to avoid doing the work.
He walked with them over to the sink, feeling the tension rising up between him and the angel he left behind him. Dean clenched his jaw and rinsed the plates, hardly seeing what he was doing. It was coming. Whatever moment of truth there was destined to be between them, it was coming.
,” Dean repeated. Bill obeyed. “You’re going to fight me. And I’m going to win. That’s how this is going to go.”
Oh yes, Cas knew what it was to love, though it had taken him years to work out that that’s what all those confusing sensations added up to.
Cas smiled, but obligingly fell silent. He still watched Dean though. Dean imagined he could feel Cas’ gaze sliding over him like silk—or, hell, maybe it wasn’t his imagination. God only knew what an archangel could do.
His hand was still on Dean’s knee, with Dean’s still resting on top of it. Cas shifted his hand, turned it face-up, and laced his fingers with Dean’s. He smiled. “I’m not freaking out,” he said. “And I’m not going anywhere.”
He found his shirt—ripped and mangled—in the kitchen. He smiled and mended it with a thought. He put it on, but left it half-buttoned. His coats he left on the floor. No sense getting entirely dressed when he had every intention of taking everything off again the moment Dean woke up.
He heard the angel walking toward him from across the room, but he didn’t turn. “I told you,” Cas said. “It was a long transition.”
“You know what else you have in common with them?” Dean asked, his voice calm and measured. He was standing in the door to the den now, silhouetted in the flickering light of the TV.
But in Heaven, there were no monsters to chase. No heads to lop off. Most of the time, he didn’t mind that, but then there would be days when a bubble of restlessness would rise and expand within him, driving him to find some way to get his heart pounding and his breath coming short. He never thought he’d have missed that part.
Light flared from his extended hand, and Bill howled in agony. Too soon, it was over, and Cas rose, leaving Bill a huddled mass on the floor. He turned to Dean.
Castiel leaned against the wall of the garage, wishing he could just leave. Hot and cold didn’t bother him the way the humans felt it, so he wasn’t pouring sweat the way everyone else in the garage was. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t feel the stuffiness of the air—the way it felt stale and thick and tepid against his skin.
Dean looked down at the man, at the fear in his eyes, and nodded. Bill moved now, scrambling backwards across the floor, until he hit the wall. With a thought, Cas reached out with his power and held him there. He approached the man slowly, making his face the stoic, holy terror it always used to be. He crouched in front of him.
The point was, as overwhelmingly complicated as this whole encounter would undoubtedly be, Dean wasn’t really the brawling kind anymore.
But then… then Bill would still walk this Earth. He would remain unpunished for what he had done to Dean and to all the others. He wouldn’t be, at this moment, stretched out on some demon’s slab, undergoing an eon of torment for each of his sins. A world where Bill was still free couldn’t be better than this.
Cas stepped forward, into Bill’s line of sight. Bill met his eye, and Cas let him see—in the set of his jaw, the ice-blue of his eyes—that this angel had no mercy to offer him. To his credit, there was a spark of fear in Bill’s muddy brown eyes. Then they flicked to Dean, then back to Cas, then back to Dean again. A cruel grin stretched across his face.
He groaned, leaning against the column, shaking his head to try to clear away the light and the impact. By the time he could see reasonably well again, he looked up to find Cas, back in his vessel, charging at him from across the room.
Cas blushed again, and Dean decided there wasn’t a better feeling in Earth or Heaven than making the third-most-powerful being in the universe blush. He eyed him, drumming his fingers on the table.
“No, you won’t do whatever you want?” Dean asked sarcastically, straightening and slipping the sheathed knife into the waistband of his jeans. “Alright, do what I want then, and shut the hell up.”
Cas nodded, still looking worried, but he averted his eyes and looked around the vaulted living room instead. Dean walked across the living room to the kitchen, watching Cas take it all in.
“God, no. Hunters I knew in life are great. Sam’s kid, mini Dean, he’s alright too. But everyone who came before and after just wants to talk about all those apocalypses we averted over and over and over again. Looking at the both of us like the sun shines out of our bunker.” Dean smiled. “Nah. No new friends for me.”
Cas was looking back at him, concerned. And fair enough. Dean had frozen in the doorway, eyes in a glazed panic. He shook his head, scattering away all the
Dean laughed too. He tried to think of something clever to say, but his mind felt scrambled. He felt Cas’ stubbly cheek nestle between his shoulder blades, and sighed. They lay there for a long time, listening to the rain pounding against the windows. Dean hadn’t even noticed when it started.
“Then I’ll stop you. Because I don’t think you’d be able to forgive yourself for killing an innocent.”
Cas watched the sky begin to lighten through the wall of windows in Dean’s bedroom. They were facing west, over the valley, so he couldn’t see the sun breaking over the horizon, but he could see the stars winking out and the sky shifting from black to indigo to blue.
“You want to hear about these damn scars, or not?” Cas nodded, looking relieved. “So, one time, when we were kids, Sam ran away when I was supposed to be watching him. Dad came back from the hunt and—I’d never seen him so mad. He was a little drunk too, and he had me pushed up against the wall. He was hollering in my face about me letting him down. Then he threw me down on the ground. He’d already broken a lamp, and the pieces were scattered all over the floor, and this huge piece jammed right up in my thigh.” Dean shuddered. “Had that scar the rest of my life. Ugly thing. Anyway, the night I finally forgave him for all that and everything else—I came home and was undressing for bed and the scar was gone. That’s when I realized the scars would disappear the more I managed to deal with my heaping pile of shit. Symbolic as hell, I know.”
Cas had backed away from the onslaught of attention, but Dean had come alive. He leaned against Baby, watching the man under her hood like a hawk until he was satisfied the mechanic knew what he was doing. But then he’d started making a rotation of all the other cars, offering his help and talking shop with the mechanics.
“Too. Many. Clothes,” he growled again, practically ripping off Cas’ belt, fingers fumbling at his zipper. He had no idea what he meant to do once they were off. He’d fantasized, sure—almost constantly sometimes. But, for all that, he’d never actually acted on any of those fantasies.
Cas’ hands slid up Dean’s chest and clasped the back of his neck—fingers threading through his hair, thumbs stroking the stubble on his jaw. The way he’d imagined a thousand, thousand times. Dean’s arms snaked around Cas’ back, holding him tight against his body until Cas could feel exactly how much Dean desired him pressing into his hip.
Dean looked away, clenching his jaw against the wound he could feel opening up in his chest. “You said you loved me, Cas. If you didn’t mean it, or if you were wrong, or… or if you changed your mind, I can understand that. But we’ve been through too much together for you not to have the balls to come tell me to my face.”
He didn’t turn right away. He just closed his eyes and hoped. A smile stretched across his face when he heard the voice come from behind him,
His release welled up within him to fill the cracks between these feelings, until there was nothing left. No more room inside him. All the shame and doubt and self-hatred of his life was crowded out by these more perfect feelings, until he thought he would burst.
Cas’ hands slid down Dean’s back to grip his shoulders, as he thrust in again, slower this time. One more thrust, and Cas shuddered, spent. Without even pulling himself out of Dean, Cas collapsed on top of him. Dean obligingly fell forward onto the bed. Both of them gasped like they’d just found the air again after drowning. Dean drew cool gusts into his lungs, letting the weight of the angel on top of him press it out again.
feel better. But the restlessness was still there. It always was. He was happy here—he truly was. He’d gotten his chance to rest and live a quiet life with his family at last, and it was
I had a mountain of shit to work through, Cas, and I needed you there for it. Where the hell were you?”
He looked at Cas and found the angel was watching him. Again, that shock went through him. Again, Cas looked away.
Cas started, pushed away from the column and raced to the far end of the porch, but not before Sam could yell, “Dean! What the hell did you do?”
“I won’t, Dean. Not until you tell me why.” He took a breath. “If I like your reason, I’ll let you go.”
“You used to be,” Dean continued. “Been having this dream ever since I came back from the pit—used to be, I’d cut you up almost as often as Sam. The things you’d say…” Dean closed his eyes, took a breath. When he opened them again, he kept them fixed on the ceiling.
,” Dean spat. “Was the last of the three. He found me at the dark end of the parking lot of that truck stop outside Saginaw, and he was just as friendly and just as chatty as he was today. Made me think he was an ok guy—for a pervert. A safer choice than some of the others I’d seen. But as soon as he had me in the back of his cab…” Dean didn’t go on, but the look in his eyes, the muscle ticking in his jaw, said enough. “After him, I knew I’d sooner starve than do it again.”
Still, though, he couldn’t help but feel a jolt that might have been triumph when Dean pulled away from the mechanics and walked over to Cas, grinning.
“He always left me in charge, so he’d leave the money with me. Sometimes—sometimes I’d lose the money. Or get mugged. Or dad would be gone longer than I’d thought he would be, and we’d run out. Usually, it was fine. I’d steal us food or clothes, when we needed them. When I got older, I’d pick up odd jobs in whatever town we were in. It was fine,” he repeated, as though reassuring himself that he’d always been able to find a way to take care of his brother.
“I would float there, burning—drowning in the power. Melting into it. Everything that had been me just… melting away. Becoming something new. And the whole time, I was terrified that… that the crack in my chassis wouldn’t be there on the other side. That I’d become just like they’d been—another standard-issue archangel. Cold and distant and too damn powerful for their own good or anyone else’s.”
Cas reached his door to the den first—it was dim, lit only by a floor lamp and the flickering of the TV. Bill was in a recliner facing towards the TV and away from Cas. Cas scowled when he saw the old spaghetti Western he was watching. Dean loved Westerns. Bill didn’t deserve them.
Dean ignored how happy it made him to hear that. “Alright, then. Your other form. It isn’t right that I’ve never seen it.”
He knew it was juvenile, and probably came from all that toxic masculinity Sam was always warning him about but—he felt a raw pleasure at being the first. He ran his thumb hard up the underside of the shaft while he sucked on the head, then wrapped his fingers around the shaft—God, they barely touched—and gripped, pumping hard.
His fingers curled just at the thought, but he held himself back. This wasn’t his kill. Right then, Dean loomed out of the darkness of the opposite doorway, gun cocked but pointed at the floor. He glanced at Bill, then at Cas—he signaled that Bill was sleeping.
But he was at peace with the not-knowing. For once, his mind and the searing new currents of power that coursed through him were quiet and still, spent by the night’s activities.
“But that doesn’t explain why you’re never on the slab anymore, does it? No reason you couldn’t come into the dream to find me cutting you up.”
He would tighten his grip on Dean’s shoulder, and the scene would begin to disintegrate. Sometimes a new dreamscape would rise up to take its place, but more often, Dean would just float off into the dreamless dark. Cas would step away, return to himself. He’d pick up his book again, but wouldn’t read it for a little while. He would be too busy watching, waiting to make sure that the dream didn’t take him again.
Cas wanted to ask what had happened three times, but he held himself silent. It was a common mistake people made with Dean—not giving him the space to speak the hard truths. That always took him more time than it took others, as though he had pushed some things down so deep that they had further to journey to find daylight. Cas was determined to give him that time.
Cas sighed. The feeling of Dean’s lips against his skin…he could have died from it and been grateful. He forced himself to push him away until their eyes could meet.
Dean breathed deep again, and nodded. He looked down at the carpet again, and his eyes took on a faraway cast—like he was seeing something that Cas couldn’t.
Dean felt his belly clench, desire coursing through him. All his life—all those women he fucked—he’d had to gentle himself, keep himself leashed, so he wouldn’t hurt them.
“I got a neighbor up there who’s a trucker. He says everyone on the Midwest route knows coming through Saginaw is a plum deal, because of the diner at that truck stop on 46—”
Castiel had always loved nighttime in the bunker. Life with the Winchesters was always so noisy, so overwhelming, that the few hours that Dean and Sam were asleep were the only moments of quiet Cas could realistically expect out of a day.
Cas surged forward, grasping the sides of Dean’s face in a grip that hurt. He crushed his lips into Dean’s, drinking deep after millennia of thirst. He drove Dean back across the kitchen to crash into the counter, and Dean let him.
Cas went a little pale at that, but he nodded. “Twice now, you’ve looked at me and it’s felt like licking a flag pole in a lightning storm. Are you doing that?”
He turned off the water and braced his hands on either side of the sink, breathing deeply, hating the tension in his shoulders. It felt like he was bracing for a fight.
for her. I built her with my own two hands. And Sam’s, sometimes, but he kept getting messing it up. Bobby was better. Figured if this is where I’m gonna spend eternity, I couldn’t leave this cabin up to some cosmic energy wave workin’ from a kit. This needed to be
Dean laughed and pulled on Cas’ fist, drawing him closer. There were a scant few inches separating them now, and Cas felt his breath catch in his throat.
Cas kept his eyes trained on his knees. “When Jack brought me back from the Empty, he brought me back as an archangel.”
Well, Cas was tireless. He smiled down at the sleeping human in his arms, resisting the temptation to wake him and start all over again. He’d already done it once. Dean had grumbled for a moment at the interruption, until Cas had taken him in his mouth, trying to emulate and match all the techniques that Dean had used on him earlier—moves that had sent him to his knees. The grumbles had turned into gasps and moans, and then they were off to round three.
archangels.” Dean heard a note of old frustration in Cas’ voice. “See, the archangels—Chuck brought them into being during the Big Bang. Four creatures, formed out of the power and heat and creative energy of the beginning of creation itself. It’s why they could do more—
He didn’t say anything as Dean began to follow him through the little mountain town, until he saw Bill pull into the driveway of a little house a few blocks away.
,” he leaned his head back and declared into the air. Within a moment, a pair of Ray Bans appeared on his face. “Ready,” he said, grinning.
“Because, I knew that one day, I wouldn’t be a desperate kid anymore. One day, I would be big, and strong, and scary. I’d turn into the thing that monsters run from. And I swore if I ever found one of them again, I’d kill them. I’d stop them from doing to anyone else what they did to me.”
All he knew was that he wanted to fucking brand himself on this creature before him. He wanted to make him burn and melt and shatter and become something new all over again. And when Cas came out on the other side, Dean wanted to have left marks on his body, he wanted his smell to be laced through his, he wanted what he’d done to him to play on a constant loop in Cas’ mind, making him blush when other people were watching. He wanted anyone who saw the angel to know that he was Dean’s.
But Bill wouldn’t, and all at once, Cas saw what he was doing. He knew he was going to die. He even welcomed it. But he was going to try to break Dean in the process. He knew, somehow, in the way that monsters always know how to cut the deepest, that Dean would add the act of killing a man lying prone at his feet to a long list of sins he felt he had to atone for. And in that small way, Bill was going to win this fight.
Cas smiled a little. “When you stop acting like one, maybe I will. You are my glitch. The chink in my stupid, angel armor, and even exploding like a damn supernova for decades couldn’t burn you out of me. You think I stayed away because I
“That fear, I could logic my way out of usually. Being gay, or… bi, or whatever. It’s not contagious. I know that. But the other fear was worse. I’d want a man and start to think… start to wonder if maybe I’d really, on some level, wanted it. That all those years ago, I’d had these thoughts and these desires, and I didn’t know what to do with them because God knows I couldn’t have talked to my dad about it, and so I went down to those truck stops, because I wanted it. That’s what they’d said, what all three of them said again and again while they were… They all told me I wanted it. That I liked it. But I
He stopped when the music stopped—he’d reached the end of the album already. How long had he been out here? He propped the axe head-down on the stump and leaned against the handle, chest expanding and contracting.
He didn’t know how to cope with all he was feeling. His true form was vast—far larger and more complex than the compressed form he’d shown Dean the night before—but somehow there was simply no room within him for the happiness he felt now. It had taken over control of his body, this happiness. He didn’t know how to make his lips stop smiling, to banish the butterflies from his stomach. To shake the sensation that he’d changed more in the last twelve hours of his life than he had in the millennia that came before.
He narrowed his eyes. Thought. Cas couldn’t interpret emotions as easily as humans could. Humans learned from birth how to understand all the confusing cues that their bodies gave them. They knew on instinct how they felt about something the moment it happened. Cas had spent a very, very long lifetime pushing away every spark of emotion he ever felt. Except wrath. Wrath could be useful. But mostly, for all those millennia, he had not let himself feel anything at all.
He raised his eyes slowly to meet Cas’. He could have laughed at the panic in the angel’s face, but just at this moment nothing seemed funny. He smiled, though. Because everything in this whole world was good tonight.
For the life of him, he didn’t know how to stop touching Dean, who was now sprawled half on top of him, snoring lightly. Every few seconds, Cas would smooth down his hair, run a finger down the groove of his spine, kiss the fingertips that rested on Cas’ collarbones, trace the faint outline of his own handprint on his shoulder. If Dean were still the light, angry sleeper that he’d once been, he’d have growled at Cas repeatedly for disturbing his sleep. Luckily, there was that new peace within Dean. Cas marveled at the beauty of Dean Winchester at peace.
. Again. Again. Without quite meaning to, Dean was keeping rhythm with the ACDC blaring from the speakers on his porch. The day was mild, but sweat was pouring down his chest—tanned from all the days he spent out in the sun working on and around his cabin. Whether it was the sweat or the exhaustion, the handprint scar on his shoulder—faded after all these years—seemed redder and more livid than it usually did.
Dean took a breath. “Good,” he said. “Now. For a while it wasn’t so good. I worked out all my shit with Mom before she died the second time, you know, but Dad…” He trailed off.
He turned then, and looked at Cas, a light in his eyes that Cas had only ever caught bare glimpses of before, when he’d turn to find Dean watching him. Whenever it happened, Dean would turn away before Cas could try to decipher it, and Cas would be left to wonder what the look had meant, and if he had imagined it, and why it had made his heart pound in his throat.
It was easy to let themselves in. Dean picked the lock of the front door, and Cas slipped a trace of his power into the lock of the back kitchen door, until it quietly unlatched.
“Ok,” Cas said, feeling Dean relax against him. “Maybe it’ll take a while. In the meantime… I’ll watch over you.”
Cas hesitated only a moment, then climbed out of the car. He needed to see him, to have eyes on him if nothing else. He never could bear the thought of Dean being alone.
“You left me alone with Gadreel. You fed me to him like bait. I bet you were relieved when he murdered me…”
Cas smiled absently, eyes still roving over the shaded porch, and the wide windows looking into the house.
But then… it would probably just crop up again tomorrow night. Cas leaned his forehead against a column, smiling wider. His cheeks hurt. He couldn’t remember smiling this much… well, ever.
Cas’ face went slack with something like shock. “You think—you actually think that I don’t still love you?” Dean went very still, his eyes snapping to Cas. “Dean. From the day I put that scar on your shoulder until this day, there hasn’t been one moment that I haven’t loved you. Even when I didn’t know it was love I was feeling. Even when you made me so fucking furious I could have wrung your neck with a goddamn smile on my face—even then, I loved you.
“None taken,” Cas said easily, climbing the stairs and leaning against the rail close to Dean. “Angels don’t eat food on Earth, so it’s hard for us to know what it’s supposed to taste like. We get lots of complaints.”
—full of understanding and compassion and love. His eyes glowed with a white light, but it was a light of warmth and comfort. Like coming home after too long away and flipping on the light switch in your house.
He did so now, watching carefully as Dean descended into silence for one minute… two… three, and this time, it worked.
. He consisted of branching veins and arteries of silver-blue light, swirling and flashing and braiding in and out of one another. The currents were in constant movement, making him almost dizzying to look at.
Dean shuddered, pressing himself hard into Cas’ hand. His fingers gripped Cas’ sides so hard his knuckles went white. Cas’ other hand floated up and threaded itself through Dean’s hair. He closed his eyes and bit his lip, fighting for control. He opened them again—he felt just as feral as Cas looked.
“It’s going to rain,” Cas said, peering up at the sky and the clouds beginning to scuttle in from the south. He began to make his way back to the porch, his eyes finding Dean at the grill. “I guess there’s no point in telling you that you could just
again—not that that would make much of a difference. Do you still value yourself so little that you’d be so careless with yourself? You’d put yourself at risk and make me live with having hurt you? You fucking
He was smiling more freely now, watching the angel more freely. Thank God for beer. Everything felt a little less terrifying with a couple in him. Cas smiled back at him, and Dean felt his heart pick up in tempo.
The car skidded to a halt, and Dean turned it off and vaulted out of it, slamming the door behind him. From inside the car, Cas heard him let loose a bellow that echoed off the surrounding mountains. His body bent nearly in half with the force of the scream. It went on and on, fed by decades of helpless rage, until all at once, it petered out. Dean straightened, staggered a step or two as though off-balance without the weight of that scream holding him down, and then sank down to the ground, his back against Baby.
Right at that moment, a gigantic man with ripped jeans and a shaggy gray beard came out of the office set into the side of the garage. Cas watched the man make the rounds of the garage, checking in with the mechanics. Something about the way he moved and the wariness of the men he talked to told Cas he was in charge here.
Cas stumbled forward a step, two steps. For years now, he’d forced himself to keep his distance, to let Dean grieve in the solitude he craved. But not tonight. Cas couldn’t let him feel this pain alone, not when Dean’s pain was like a blade cutting through Cas’ own chest.
He felt Cas’ fingers digging into his hips as he thrust in and out, gasping and moaning. Dean grinned at the way he was making his angel moan. His thighs trembled, and his cock ached for attention. He reached back and grabbed Cas’ hand, pulled it to his cock and wrapped his fingers around it.
He picked up what looked like a laminated badge hanging from a lanyard. It was too dark, and Cas was too far away to read what was on it.
The mechanic working on Baby chose that moment to look up and give Dean that chin-jerk greeting some human men seemed to be so fond of. Cas couldn’t pull it off, but Dean gave it right back to him. Another twist in Cas’ stomach.
“—wonderful and the best friend I ever had. You’re the same as you always were, Cas, and thank God for that.”
For a long time, the only sound was the purr of Baby’s engine. Cas let that comforting rhythm soak into him as Dean sent them hurtling down dark, twisting mountain roads.
Without thinking, Dean leaned forward and put his hand on top of Cas’. Cas froze, eyes trained on Dean’s hand. “Thank you, Cas. I think you might be the first archangel I ever met who deserved the title.”
Cas scowled. “I’m going to try as much as I can to dampen the light and energy, but it still may be too much. If it starts to hurt, close your eyes and put your head down right away and I’ll come back into my body. I won’t be able to speak to you without hurting you.”
“Don’t worry,” he said, his voice like two stones grating against one another. “I can make this painless.” He paused. Gave a tiny smile. “But I won’t.”
Until one night, when he emerged from a particularly gruesome version of the dream. It had been Jack on the slab this time, screaming about all the various cruelties Dean had shown him through his life. Dean had been weeping—violently sobbing as he cut into the boy. Cas knew full well the guilt Dean held onto for how he’d treated Jack. Both Jack and Cas had forgiven him for it a long time ago, but Dean couldn’t forgive himself.
It wasn’t the excruciating sort of silence that had festered between the two of them from time to time, when they were fighting. That silence was frigid and brittle, prone to shattering into an explosive fight at the tiniest provocation. Cas had come across no other power in his long life that could make him feel as wretched, as desperately sad, as when Dean pulled away from him in anger.
Bill had finally sputtered into silence. Dean’s voice rang out to fill it. “You know what else you have in common with those monsters, Bill? You’re clever. You’re determined. And you’ll always find a way to follow your nature.”
Cas kept his silence as they drove to a motel outside of town, but he took the lead in asking the man behind the front desk for a room. If Dean couldn’t be trusted to talk to Cas, God only knew what he’d say to a stranger.
Those words again, but this time there were no tears in Cas’ eyes, no Death at the door. They struck at Dean, like a hammer on a bell. He felt them reverberate through him, trailing music where they touched. He could feel every atom in his body ring out with them.
He shook his head. “You told be enough stories for me to be of the opinion that a punch was just the start of what he deserved.”
Bill looked down and laughed. “Glad somebody does. I was nineteen and stupid, and figured this would be a good way of convincing Sarah to marry me. Didn’t work.”
Dean’s hands scraped down Cas’ sides, gripped the angel’s hips, and ground them into his own. He loosed a groan—God, it may as well have been a growl—when he felt the hard length of Cas pressing into him. Cas moved against him, his tongue probing deep into Dean’s mouth. Dean pushed back, taking Cas’ lower lip in his mouth and sucking, biting.
“Anyway, I see Sam and Eileen most days. Bobby’s nearby too, and Jody, Donna, Claire and all the others come by all the time. Mom and Dad live over by Bobby.”
Dean shrugged. “Not me. I had every scar I ever earned when I got here, and for a while after, too. At some point, they started disappearing. Couldn’t figure out why, until after Dad and I finally patched things up. See, he’d apologized for everything before, a bunch of times, but I never could forgive him. ‘Til one night, we were all sitting around his and Mom’s fire pit, and he made some stupid joke, and I just looked at him and realized—he’s just a person. Even then, after all that time, I still expected him to be a superhero. To be able to do and be
“Damn right. Listen, you go get checked out with Chris. I’ll look over your girl myself to make sure he did her right.”
He led the way up the path to the cabin and heard Cas trailing behind. He tried to gather his wits as he went. He’d known this day would come—even as the years had stretched on in that weird-ass time warp way of Heaven, he’d known Cas would come back. Cas always came back.
Other times, Cas would look at Dean and inspiration would strike. It would be like looking through a window—he’d see a truth that Dean was trying to hide spelled out clear as day. It had happened that night in the barn, the first time they’d spoken. He’d seen the set of his face, the way he turned away from the being who had given him salvation, and realized all at once.
“I think you don’t see me on the slab anymore because I forgave you for all those things you felt guilty for.”
With a grunt of frustration, Dean backed away and lowered his gun, tucking it into his waistband. Bill’s eyes opened in surprise.
He approached Cas, who was again running his fingers along one of the carved columns that marched in a line down the center of the house, between the living room and the kitchen and dining area. Each column was crowded with carvings of every monster and beast that Dean had ever encountered. For most people, it made the columns fearsome, even horrible to look at. But for Dean, and the other hunters that came to visit, they just evoked memories and laughter and stories.
It was easy to see where the agony came from. The person on the table was different every time, but always someone that Dean loved. Sometimes it was Sam, sometimes Bobby, sometimes Jody, or John, or Claire, or Kevin, or Lisa. Sometimes it was a person that Cas didn’t know—like a beautiful young Black woman, or a short man with shaggy brown hair, or a little boy with a ring hanging on a chain around his neck. Sometimes it was Benny.
“Couldn’t help but notice,” he said, those twin spots appearing in his cheeks again. “All those scars you used to have from hunts are gone. All that’s left…”
This was another kind—this was the sort of silence that Dean descended into when tragedy struck. When he’d grit his teeth and bear the company of others only as long as he had to, waiting for the earliest opportunity to slip away to rage and throw things and punish himself in peace.
For all Dean knew, Cas was just another part of the dream—the same deliverer that had come to draw him from Hell the first time. Cas saw no reason to tell him otherwise. He didn’t think Dean would thank him for intruding on his worst traumas, his worst fears about himself. So Cas kept it to himself.
Dean didn’t know, of course, that Cas followed him on those nights, whenever they’d suffered a terrible loss, when Dean charged out of the bunker on some made-up errand, only to trek off into the woods and punch a tree or let out a scream, muffled by his fist pressed against his mouth. Cas knew better to approach him, but he could never bear the thought of Dean being truly alone when he grieved.
,” he spat out the word, “so hard that he’d keep hurting them just for spite. Or for fun. I wouldn’t risk that.”
It was slow and soft, the kiss. A whisper of a touch that stood in stark contrast to the thunder rolling through Dean’s whole body. But he held himself still, not wanting to go too fast, to frighten away this doofus he’d only just found again.
He added up all these feelings, noticing another twist in his gut when he saw Dean clap a mechanic on his shoulder and burst out laughing at something he’d said.
“True. But maybe you believe it now in a way you didn’t then. Now, you know I love you, now—you know how I see you. If you heard me saying horrible things from the slab, you’d know it was a lie. You’d stop believing the dream. So you stopped seeing me there.”
He heard Cas take a breath to say something, then let it out again. He watched the angel out of the corner of his eye. His eyes were flicking around, as though searching for something to say. They landed on the pile of wood.
“Yeah, man, I was pretty messed up. You know how I was with Jack at first—I think I blamed him for you dying. I couldn’t bear that he got to be alive and you didn’t I just. God, I was so mad and lost and I just couldn’t figure out how to climb my way out of it. Came across Billie during a hunt and asked her to just end it. She said no, and good thing because I found out you were back that same day.”
The dread was all-consuming now. Cas could feel that molten pool in the pit of his stomach sending icy tendrils through the rest of his body, leaving him cold and keeping him still.
Dean blinked at the effect of Cas’ eyes, feeling something buzz through him like he’d brushed up against a live wire. Cas looked away again. Dean shook his head clear and walked over to hand the angel a beer.
Dean nodded. “I don’t know if those will ever leave, but I don’t mind. It’s been decades since I last hunted, but a hunter is just what I
“You’re weak, boy. Soft. You think I don’t know what you are? You’re gonna get yourself killed—get Sammy killed—and for what? You’re weak…”
Running footsteps coming closer from the tree line to his right, then a familiar voice saying, “…the fuck?”
Dean nodded. Cas leaned back in his chair, resting his head against the back. He closed his eyes, and within a moment, his body began to glow. Ribbons of silver arced out of the body and then back in, coalescing and rising up to form something resembling a human shape. The figure stood, leaving the vessel behind and stepping a few steps away.
The night that Cas had joined Dean along a lakeside in Dean’s dream was a long, long time ago. Before the Leviathans had hijacked Cas’ mind and body to do unspeakable things. Before Lucifer had leashed him, kept him quiet and sedate while he set about raising hell on earth and in heaven. Before Cas had wandered among the shattered pieces of his own mind, unable and unwilling to piece them back together for fear of what he would have to face when he did. Before he’d learned of all the times that Naomi had broken and brainwashed him—before she’d nearly forced him to kill the man he loved more than he had ever loved himself.
“You know what the worst part was? Well… one of the worst parts. Even then, I could’ve killed any one of them. Big as they were, strong as they were, scary as they were…I’d already taken down bigger, and stronger, and scarier. That was how I kept myself sane, while it was happening. I’d be lying there, counting out how many moves it’d take for me to get the knife out of my shoe and into their windpipe. But I couldn’t. Because Sam was sick and the last thing I needed was to bring the cops knocking at our motel room, asking about a trucker found dead with my fingerprints all over him. And even if they’d let me off, they’d have told Dad and Sam what I’d done, and… I couldn’t handle them knowing.
Dean instinctively looked down at his chest, but he’d finally relented and put on a t-shirt against the cooling air. He raised an eyebrow at Cas, who shrugged.
Dean slammed on the brakes, swerving across the deserted road towards the edge. For a wild moment, Cas thought he was taking them over and into the abyss, but then he caught sight of a sign for a scenic overlook and realized Dean was whipping into a tiny parking lot clinging to the side of the mountain.
He felt Cas smile through his own lips. Cas’ tongue flicked, running a shivering line across Dean’s upper lip.
His body tensed, his muscles flexed. He pressed back into Cas, who was pounding out a frantic rhythm now, and reached back to find Cas’ free hand braced in the covers. He laced his fingers with his and gripped tight as the release crashed over him, racing out from his core to each far corner of his body. He roared, rolling his eyes back as Cas’ hand grew slippery on his cock.
He’d go up to the garage, run his fingers along Baby. He’d sift through the various treasures gathered by the Men of Letters, cataloguing them diligently in Sam’s database. He’d kick his feet up in the library, reading an old diary of a Man of Letters or, more likely, a book from the local library.
Dean moaned in his sleep and there, again, was the wash of desire. Cas shook his head, chuckling silently.
Cas sighed. “Dean,” he said softly. But Dean shook his head sharply, and Cas lost his nerve. The silence gathered and intensified for another hour, as Dean barreled down the mountain roads as though he was being pursued by something he was desperate to outrun.
. That made all the ways he failed seem so much bigger, so much more—I don’t know—disappointing. Because in my head, he was supposed to be the best man in the world.
Cas beamed. “I know,” he said. “That part never gets old. The creating.” Cas raised his bottle in a cheers and drank deep. Dean lapsed into silence, watching his new crop of sunflowers slowly shift and turn to face the sinking sun.
He fell silent. Cas had long since released the pressure holding Dean into his seat, but Dean didn’t move, lost in thought and memory. Cas, too, had gone quiet. It wasn’t that he didn’t feel anything, because he did. He felt so many things. He felt a vast, echoing sorrow for Dean. For the child he’d been and for what those men had taken from him. He felt a boiling anger for John, and even—unfairly, he knew—for Sam, for the parts they had played in driving Dean to believe he’d had to do this. For giving him no one else to turn to. He felt that old, familiar need to reach out and hold Dean and to tell him he wasn’t alone, though even Cas knew that now would be the worst of all possible times to make that move.
“Cas, you—” he reached out a hand to touch him, and Cas flung out a hand, a stream of his power whipping out and launching Dean across the room to crash against one of the columns.
Dean ignored him, checking the bullet chamber of his gun. He sighed and reached back into his bag, pulling out a box of ammo. He started to reload.
Cas wanted to say something, anything, to make that haunted look leave Dean’s eyes. But the roaring in his ears made it completely impossible to find anything of use to say. Dean didn’t seem to notice. He went on.
Bill’s broken voice came from behind them. “You wouldn’t have been there that night if you hadn’t wanted it. You could have raked some old lady’s leaves if all you wanted was money. What you wanted was
Dean let out a low whistle. “I know the life, man. I was just saying that opening up a place like this would be a hell of a way to end up.”
He chewed, rolling his eyes back in pleasure. “Never gets old,” he said, his mouth full. “I mean maybe this isn’t real food or whatever, but you can’t tell me it ain’t delicious.”
“Dean,” Cas replied, voice muffled by the kisses he was trailing between Dean’s shoulder blades. He pressed his forehead onto Dean’s back, pumping faster and deeper into Dean, his breath coming short.
Cas got Dean’s jeans undone, and Dean tried to crawl off him so he could shimmy them off. Cas was faster. Stronger. He shot up, until they were kneeling face to face, slid his hands into Dean’s jeans and gripped his ass. He kissed him deeply, letting one hand—one finger—dip lower.
Dean mumbled in his sleep, stirring. His hand shifted down Cas’ chest, coming to rest near his navel. A thoughtless, casual movement—but it was enough to send desire streaking through Cas all over again.
The living room area took up the front half of the house—the ceiling here sloped upwards to the peak two stories up, bolstered by massive wooden rafters. The back half of the ground floor consisted of a huge kitchen to the left, and a dining area to the right. Huge windows lined the back wall, but the curtains were covering them now, since the sunset was about to send light streaming into the house.
A sound came from behind him that nearly stopped his still-pounding heart. It was a sound he hadn’t heard since long before he died.
Dean rolled his eyes as he laid slices of cheese over the burgers. “That’s all you got from that whole speech?”
Cas was happy for him—he and Sam so rarely gave Dean the chance to talk like this. But he felt something else, too, watching Dean connecting with all these men in a way that Cas couldn’t.
He dropped the badge on the table and walked slowly back towards the den. Cas followed, stopping at the table to pick up the badge. It was an ID tag, marking Bill as a bus driver for the town’s middle school. It had just been issued the month before.
No, Cas thought he might be afraid of whatever it was Cas was asking him to say. As though the words had been locked in the dark for so long that they had transformed into something more frightening than the real-life monsters Dean faced every day without flinching.
Without hesitation, Dean fell sideways into the V between Cas’ propped-up knees and his chest. On pure instinct, Cas wrapped his arms around him—his right arm gripping tight to Dean’s chest and the crook of his left elbow cradling his head. He could feel the force of Dean’s crying against his own chest now, and he could only hope that Dean couldn’t feel the frantic pounding of Cas’ heart.
“What makes you think I sleep at night? You think I like being what I am? You think I don’t wish I could stop? If I’d had any guts at all, I’d have put a gun in my mouth the day I realized I couldn’t.” Cas raised an eyebrow at the self-loathing in the man’s voice.
Still stretching, he made his way out onto the back porch, wanting to see the morning mists swirling through the valley from the top of the ridge he’d designed specifically for Dean.
“I’m going out, Cas,” he said, throwing his bag on one of the beds and digging around in it for something. Cas swallowed when Dean pulled out a massive knife.
Cas felt the plunging in his stomach that he’d gotten to know well over the years—guilt. He hated the thought that something he could ask of Dean could make him so afraid. But there was another feeling too. That chill streaked down his spine again and settled in the pit of his stomach, molten and black.
Cas cocked an eyebrow. “Couldn’t have put it better myself,” he said. Then a shy smile spread across his face. “Garth and his wife volunteered to be guinea pigs for the spell. It was hard on them but… they’ll be ready soon. They’re coming to Heaven, Dean.”
Dean blinked at him, then down at the man who had just, for the first time all night, gone white as a sheet. Dean looked back at Cas. “You can?”
That molten pit inside Cas shifted, expanded. “I’ll never tell,” he said, and he meant it. Nothing was worth losing them. Him.
He’d imagined how it would go a million times, at least. There were days when he was so furious at the angel for staying away so long that he imagined their reunion as an all-out brawl. On some level, that was still a tempting option, but so much of Dean’s anger had abated over the years. A lifetime of seeing so much of the worst of the world had given his temper a hair trigger for all his life, but towards the end of his time on Earth—ever since a dying angel had told him that he wasn’t defined by his anger—he’d begun to try to get it under control. He’d kept that work up in Heaven.
He bent his chin and kissed the crown of Dean’s head softly. No. He would never know how to put all that he felt now into any kind of sense or order.
Cas shot up. He hadn’t realized Dean was awake. Then the implication of what he’d said set in. He blanched. “Dean—Dean, I—”
Cas shrugged, running his finger in an idle circle on the table. “Remember what Chuck said? And Naomi? That I was the angel who came off the line with—”
This one was hard to write, and may be hard to read if you've experienced sexual trauma. It's tough to strike the balance between the satisfaction of a revenge fantasy and the reality that revenge doesn't actually fix everything. Still, I wrote like five different drafts of it, and just had to decide to go for it and post. I hope you like it!
Dean bellowed and charged, ramming Bill’s abdomen with his shoulder, sending the man careening up and over the back of his recliner. He stalked around the toppled chair and stood over Bill. “Stand up. Stand up, and fight.”
Cas’ mind flashed to the ugly anchor tattoo on Bill’s arm, and that molten pit inside him began to curdle.
They kicked off their shoes, while Dean wrapped the tie once around his hand and pulled Cas hard against his chest. He kissed him deep while his other hand tugged at Cas’ shirt. Cas shed his suit coat, then helped Dean with the shirt. Buttons flew as he ripped it open. Dean’s hand drifted up and pulled off the tie.
Dean came up behind Cas, wrapped his arms around him, and kissed his neck. There it was again—another overwhelming flood of happiness.
He breathed out sharply through his nose, resisting. He gritted his teeth as the urge began to subside. Is this how it would be from now on? His desire for Dean a short leash that tugged him to attention at the slightest look or touch?
Dean thought a moment. “Every time I’d want a man, I’d think one of two things. Sometimes, I’d worry that those nights, what those men did to me—that it had changed me. Warped me. Like I was meant to be straight, but some part of them had rubbed off on me, and I’d become what they were.” Cas opened his mouth, but Dean put up a hand. “I know, I know, there’s a hell of a gap between wanting to be with a man and being a fucking child molester. They’re not the same thing. I know that, logically. But this wasn’t logical. This was… it was primal. A fear that the first time I climbed into one of their trucks I’d changed in a way I couldn’t take back.
Dean pulled away just a hair, and met Cas’ eye. Cas could feel the smile break and stretch across his face, and Dean gave an answering smile, like something important had just been confirmed. As though on cue, they surged together once more, but this time neither of them was still.
“But right then I realized—he was barely done being a kid when Mom died. She was the most important thing he’d ever had in his life, and it broke him when he lost her. The same way it broke me when Sam died, and I went and sold my soul. Same way I fell apart after you died, tried to get Billie to kill me. He was just broken. It doesn’t justify any of it, really. And yeah, I can sit here and wish he’d been better, and so can he. But I finally understood. He wasn’t a superhero—just another broken person who didn’t know how to be better. And I forgave him.”
He forced himself to hold Cas’ gaze while the angel processed all that. Cas swallowed, smiled a little, looked away. Dean grinned and dug into his hamburger.
I stayed away because I love you with every wasted part of me. With my grace and my mind, and God knows I would love you with my body too if you’d give me half a chance. I stayed away, because I thought if I came, you might send me away again. And I couldn’t—” He faltered, putting a hand to his abdomen as though to steady himself. “I didn’t change my mind, Dean. I couldn’t if I tried. I love you.”
Cas could barely wrap his mind around that idea, but whenever his confusion would mount, he would just look at Dean, his profile limned in the pinks and purples of the sunrise, and he’d let it go.
he’d choose this spot, of course. He’d designed a few different places for him. A Kansas-like prairie. A quiet, wooded lake. The beach he’d always talked about retiring to. He’d put them near the various places where the people Dean loved had set up their homes, hoping that would make it more likely he’d find them.
“Wasn’t too long after that last time, that I started chasing girls. I’d sleep with any woman who would have me, for
“Good,” Cas said. Dean sighed, looking just the tiniest bit more at peace. Cas asked, “Do you—I don’t know—feel better? Maybe that’s a stupid question, sorry.”
Cas blinked out at the yard surrounding the house, smiling sheepishly. No need to wonder what had made him lose control of his power last night. He wondered if he should fix it before Dean woke up—he might not appreciate Cas leaving his mark on his piece of land without asking.
The rest of whatever he was trying to say was lost in a moan of pleasure as Dean arched his back and let Cas go deeper still. Dean felt tremors racing through his body at every noise he elicited from Cas. He’d never in his life gotten so much pleasure from giving pleasure to someone else.
Dean moaned. Cas. Cas was touching him. Cas was inside him. Cas wanted him, had been longing for Dean as long as Dean had been longing for him. Cas was—
“And then we got you back. You started to,” he rolled his eyes, “watch over me, every night. And all of a sudden, whenever the dream would start to get really bad, you were there beside me, telling me I don’t belong there. That hadn’t ever happened in the dream before.” His eyes shot to Cas’ and he gave a wry smile. “Didn’t take a genius to figure it out, Cas. That it was actually you.”
He breathed deep, letting it crackle through his body until he felt wide awake, ready for battle. He realized that Dean was watching him warily. Unsure, maybe, how Cas would react to this news—unsure if Cas would see him differently. It would be just like Dean to think this story might have reflected poorly on him.
The house was small, but Cas was surprised at how clean it was. It didn’t feel right that someone like Bill should be living in a clean place. Cas wanted him in filth and squalor. Something to match the evils he’d done.
Dean did look at him, then, and gave a wry smile. “Hell, Cas, killing ourselves for each other? That’s kind of our thing. Funny, isn’t it? Always so willing to give something the other one would never want.”
When Baby had broken down in western Colorado, Cas had thought Dean’s grumpiness at not having the parts to fix her would be the worst he’d have to deal with. Dean objected on principle to having to call a tow truck for the Impala.
Cas nodded, smiling, but his face turned somber. “Dean. I couldn’t find Benny. You know he got killed while he was in Purgatory, and… well, his soul has to still exist somewhere, and I’m looking. I’ll find him if I can. He should—” He paused, swallowing like it hurt him to admit it. “He should be here too.”
“Damn right.” He took another bite and washed it down with a swig of beer. “So, tell me: what the hell have you been up to out there all this time? You know, when you weren’t exploding.”
Cas stopped himself when he started to stroke the bridge of his nose back and forth through Dean’s hair, going cold at the thought of the mocking remarks Dean would make at his
Cas hand gripped tighter around his cock, and Dean groaned at the friction of his palm and the press of his fingers. He felt
Cas watched him now, white-knuckling on the steering wheel as he drove them up a steep incline, and wondered if he’d let his own wrath get the better of him. He’d come a long way since he’d found the Winchesters, but sometimes Cas still found himself falling back on old habits—and he’d been taught from his earliest days that, when an angel is wronged, the proper response is to smite the one who wronged them.
Bill doubled over, clutching his stomach and wheezing from his bruised and broken mouth. But still he didn’t move.
Cas pressed a soft kiss to the back of his neck. He ran his fingers up Dean’s arms and along his sides. He gripped the small of his back and lifted himself up and to the side. He turned Dean to face him.
Cas paused, face still flushed with anger, but something softer now, too. Something uncertain. He dropped his hands from Dean’s chest like they’d been burned and stepped away, blinking in confusion.
Dean grinned. “Not hard enough, apparently. An explosion was kind of what I was going for—would’ve done wonders for my ego.”
Cas let him go but mourned the loss of him. He felt cold where the heat of Dean had been. But at least he didn’t go far. Dean’s arm and thigh still pressed unapologetically against his. Dean leaned his head back against the car and rubbed at his eyes.
“Hell, when you knew me, I couldn’t. Took me years to get good enough to start on these columns. There are still some spots I wish I could have another go at,” he said, scowling at an image of werewolf that had given him a hell of a time.
He went quiet, bending to the work of putting the burgers on the buns he’d laid out on plates on the railing, already fully dressed. He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing his work, then took an onion from his burger and put it on Cas’, and moved a single leaf of lettuce from Cas’ to his. He narrowed his eyes again, then nodded.
“Well, shit, this is embarrassing,” Dean whispered, blushing to hear his voice crack. “I’m just—I’m just glad. I’ve missed you, Cas.”
“Don’t worry Cas—lots of boys find they can’t control themselves when they go through the Big Change.”
“Exactly,” Cas managed to answer, while Dean slammed him flat on the bed. Dean straddled Cas, grinding his hips against his cock while he unbuckled his own jeans. He felt Cas’ fingers against his and left him to the task. Dean leaned forward and kissed the angel hard, digging his fingers into the hard muscle of his shoulders.
He felt better. He’d never really been into exercise before, in life. He hadn’t needed to be. Who needed to go try to out-douche the bros at the gym, when there were monsters to chase, buildings to break into, and vampire heads to be lopped off? Sam was the one who felt like he needed to run and do that yoga crap on
Dean smiled. “He did deserve it. Took me a while before I really understood all the reasons why. Took him a while too. But we kept at it. I’ve been trying to reckon, see, with all the things I tried to push away and not think about when I was alive. All those things that were making me miserable, and so fucking angry all the time, because I never bothered to
“Dean,” Cas murmured, his voice a broken plea. “Dean.” He reached down and gripped Dean’s hair so tight it hurt. Dean hummed in pleasure, and Cas moaned against the vibration of the hum.
He circled the car, steps nearly sputtering out when he heard it: Dean was crying. Not the press-lipped, single tear that Dean usually limited himself to. These were heaving, shuddering sobs. Cas rounded the trunk and felt an ache open in his chest at what he saw. Dean’s head had sunk between his knees, his hands gripped his own hair, he shoulders shook with every sob that broke loose.
. It was beyond description, beyond anything Dean had ever imagined. No wonder all those angels had always been so desperate to follow him, if they could see his true face. It was
Cas would kiss his forehead and hold him late into the night. At some point, he would get up, stretch his legs, pull a chair up to the bedside, and read his poetry. Keeping his watch.
Cas stared. All Dean’s easiness of the last half hour was gone—replaced by something like wariness. Cas turned narrow eyes to the boss, but couldn’t see any sign that he might be more than he seemed. Dean had better instincts on a hunt than any of the warriors Cas had never known, though.  He knew what to look for better than Cas did, so Cas kept wary eyes on the mechanic too.
“You know,” he said, that long-remembered rumble of a voice unlocking something inside Dean’s chest. “You don’t have to make your own firewood. It’s Heaven—you can just wish for it, and it’ll show up.”
Dean asked him once why Cas never joined him in his dreams anymore, the way he’d done once before. Cas said something about the danger of interrupting REM cycles, and how Dean got little enough sleep as it was. But that was only half the truth.
Cas narrowed his eyes, but grinned. “You’d have liked Joseph. Daniel? You’d have punched him after five minutes.”
, and on some level the tattoo shows that. Can’t separate myself from that one without becoming someone I don’t want to be. Suppose that’s true of the handprint too.”
He stopped short. Cas watched as Sam took in his half-dressed state and his rumpled hair. He looked again at the yard, then up at the window to Dean’s bedroom, and a smile began to stretch across his face.
, as you put it, that made me different from the rest of them. I think it was that crack that let the bits of humanness in. Let me become more, I don’t know, compassionate than other angels were. More independent. More… more stupid and chaotic, sometimes. But it let me feel… everything. Everything an angel wasn’t supposed to feel.”
Dean set his jaw, looked away. His breath came heavy in his chest. Cas settled on the bed across from him, watching, trying his best to decipher what he saw.
“Yeah, Cas, I kind of figured that out in the last—what? Eighty years?” Cas looked away again. Dean rested his calloused hand on the axe handle. “It wasn’t firewood I wanted, genius. I have central heating.”
Dean took a deep breath. And another one. Then, staring into the worn motel carpet, he said, “If I tell you this… if I tell you this, you have to swear to me you won’t tell Sam.” He met Cas’ eye, then. He still looked afraid, but that fear was now locked in an ironclad determination. “If you tell him, you’re done with us—me and Sam. I mean it, Cas, I’ll never speak to you again, I swear to God. Never even look at you. Understand?”
“You knew how I felt about you. But I was only ever some tool to you—something to help you save your precious angel and your precious brother…”
Dean flicked the bullet chamber closed and faced Cas then. Cas almost had to take a step back at the look in Dean’s eyes. There was a bleakness there that Cas hadn’t seen in a long, long time. He’d first seen it when he’d broken into Hell and found a blood-soaked Dean looming over a poor soul stretched out on a slab. He’d seen it since, but not often. Not like this.
“Archangeling?” Dean shrugged. Cas said, “I’ve actually been spending a lot of time in Purgatory, since you mention it.”
Cas smiled. He opened a path for Sam through the flowers, and began the first day of eternity with his family.
His grin widened, remembering those activities that had lasted almost the whole of the night. The fierce passion of their first time had eased into a slow exploration of each other. Hands, lips, tongues touching everywhere that could be touched. Every urge and fantasy Cas had ever entertained fulfilled by those hours and hours of tireless pleasure.
Dean set his jaw, cocked his gun, and took a breath. Bill closed his eyes. Cas waited—they all did—for the gunshot to ring out, but it never came. Dean just stood there, breathing heavily, wild eyes fixed on Bill. But he didn’t pull the trigger. He looked like he wanted to, badly. But he didn’t.
“Anyway, you didn’t answer my question. What is it you’ve been doing while you’ve been out there archangeling around.”
“Do you have any idea,” the angel said in his ear, in a whisper so close it raised goosebumps. “How hard it was not to explode just then?”
Other tears had piled on top of them through the years, every time Dean hadn’t allowed himself to feel his own pain. So now all those tears—all those decades of tears—were being dredged up too.
now that he’d loved this nerdy angel with all he had, ever since Cas had turned from Heaven just to help him. Maybe before. Admitting it to himself was more than he’d been able to manage for a long, long time—until the day his whole heart had stood before him with shining eyes and spent his last minutes alive telling Dean that he was good and loving, before plunging into a void that, for all he’d tried until the day he died, Dean didn’t have the power to pull him out of.
“After…” he stopped, swallowed. “After the Empty took you, I had the dream every night. Always you. For weeks. Listing all the shitty things I’d done and said. All the ways I’d pushed you away, just ‘cause I was too chickenshit to tell you I loved you. Hell, to tell myself I loved you.”
But here it was again. Pure and uncut, pouring liquid fire into his body through the fingertips that traced the line of Cas’ jaw, the palms that slid down his neck, the lips that pressed so softly against his.
Cas said nothing. Gave him the space, in the way he knew instinctively how to do, to speak the hard truths.
Then, when Dean was nearly done, both Cas’ hands disappeared and gripped Dean’s hips again, hard. Cas grunted, thrusting into the hilt once. Twice. On the third thrust, he cried out, pressing so deep that a fresh wave of release came over Dean just as it had seemed to be subsiding.
“Absolutely not,” Dean agreed proudly. “I don’t understand why so many people here just stop doing things for themselves as soon as they get here. I
He wasn’t clothed, and Dean couldn’t help but notice that his body’s resemblance to a man’s extended… far. His mouth went a little dry, and he hoped Cas couldn’t see where he was looking through the sunglasses.
“Nah, not trucks. But I live out on the road. Based out of Saginaw though—you ever make your way through there?”
Cas blushed, looking shyly at Dean. Dean’s green eyes were twinkling, and then he burst out laughing. He buried his face in Cas’ shoulder, shaking with laughter. Sam laughed too.
Cas smiled. “For me too. Anyway, I guess some power was spilling out. Now that I know it’s happening, I’ve got it under control. See?”
Cas put his head in his hand, laughing softly. “Thank you, Dean. Always so helpful at putting things in perspective.”
After he and Dean finally came clean to each other about how they felt, nights in the bunker became even better. There was less solitude. Much less quiet.
Dean couldn’t help it. He stopped, looked down at the naked torso in his arms. Cas let him look, leaning forward to lick and nibble at Dean’s ear while he looked his fill. Cas had seen Dean shirtless plenty, but Dean could count on one hand the number of times he’d seen
Something tore in Cas’ chest, broken loose by the look in Dean’s eyes. He had come so far. He’d just started to believe in his own goodness. Killing a human would send him right back to where he’d been when he’d first crawled out of the pit.
Dean was watching him, almost wary. “Oh God, did I freak you out? Are you gonna run off to buy a pack of cigarettes or something and disappear forever?” There was a forced lightness in his voice, like he was joking, but Cas heard the note of fear beneath.
Dean smiled, let that little comment soak into him, warming him. “I figure Hell wouldn’t have been so bad the second time around. Rowena would’ve gone easy on me, for sure. Well… maybe not for sure. But I’d have had a shot at sweet-talking her at least. But Purgatory? Wouldn’t’ve been the same without you.”
Cas would have smiled at the nobility of this stupid human he loved if the look on Dean’s face didn’t break his heart.
Cas could feel the man flinch. “Yeah, I think I do. Saginaw? Thirty some-odd years ago? Maybe longer? Yeah. You were a pretty little thing. I remember—you were wearing an ugly-ass necklace. Wouldn’t let me touch you ‘til you took it off and put it in your pocket.”
“Look, Cas, that was part of the appeal for these guys, ok? I was a kid, desperate enough to do what they wanted. They were willing to shell out, so I—like I said, I did what I had to.”
The fresh air through the wide-open garage doors looked preferable by far—but there was Dean to look after.
Once, when Dean was fourteen and out on a hunt with his father, John was injured. He sent Dean back to the car to drive into town for help.
He pushed himself upright, raising his eyes up to the leafy canopy above him. He was just below the tree line behind his cabin. The dappled green light played across his face. He closed his eyes and sighed.
He felt scared for his father, sure. But that fear was crowded out by another feeling, shaken into life by the rhythm of the motor. Dean felt alive, unfettered. He felt his heart pounding out a tattoo in his chest, but rather than being afraid, he was
