Sherlock had already taken his scarf and coat, climbing down the stairs with visible enthusiasm. John was left to follow with a small sigh.

you. I hope it is enough.”
After a few seconds he pulled out his phone and texted the client, inquiring about his assistant's ears, whether they were pierced or not.
Sherlock was quiet, her breathing still a bit irregular. "Jo?" she asked, after a minute or two.
Sherlock shook her head. “Not wrong, no. I just – I was wondering…” she hesitated again, took a deep breath. Tried again. “Have you thought at all about. Um. Have you thought about… trying again? Maybe?”
"Mm, John. He had a nightmare. He was asking for you, but..."
Sherlock didn’t answer. She was sitting at the kitchen table, staring down at the colourful array of tests in front of her.
Jo grinned at her, enchanted. “You don't fool me, Sherlock Holmes. You're a sentimental sod under all that.”
fault, because I was selfish and stupid in uni.”
“Detective Inspector,” Sherlock nodded. “I trust you haven’t moved the bodies?”
Sherlock didn’t answer. She wriggled and refused to meet Jo’s eyes.
Jo’s heart broke. Clearly Sherlock was taking the loss of the pregnancy much harder than Jo had realised. “I’m sorry, love,” she said again. She lifted Sherlock’s head and shoulders gently off the couch, slid into the space underneath, and lay Sherlock’s head down in her lap. “I had no idea you were feeling so badly. I should have taken better care of you.”
“I’m so sorry, sweetheart,” Jo said after a long moment of silence. “I know how much you wanted this.”
“Sherlock…”
Mrs Hudson looked surprised. “Of course not, dear. Why would she be?”
"…yes."
“You’re sure? Because I wouldn’t mind. If you did want to talk about it, that is.”
The first two times Sherlock came home to find Jo curled up on the sofa, crying and listening to something through her earbuds, she wasn’t sure what to do. Would Jo want Sherlock there with her? Or were the earbuds meant to signal a desire for privacy? She’d been so closed off about the rest of her grief that Sherlock was uncertain of her welcome in this. Instead of saying anything, she made Jo a cup of tea, left it within arm’s reach, and made herself scarce.
Jo smiled a little. They were silent for a while.
When the taxi pulled on to Baker Street, Sherlock wiped her cheeks and nudged Jo awake. She paid the fare, then jumped out to open Jo’s door for her. She wrapped an arm around her waist, helping her out of the taxi and up to their flat. “Do you want anything? I can make tea, if you want?”
“Oh! Johanna, dear, I wasn’t expecting you home. I made a pot of soup, I thought you and Sherlock might like it.”
“Say it anyway? Please?” Jo’s voice was small.
she doubted she ever would have -- but in practice it left Jo leaning awkwardly against Sherlock, who still hadn’t kissed her back, her lips completely still and unresponsive against Jo’s.
“Jo? It’s Mrs Hudson, dear. Can I come in?”
“Sherlock,” Jo said, her voice taking on the deadly calm tone it had when she was at the end of her patience. “If I need or want something, I will ask you. But my answer hasn’t changed in the ten minutes since you last asked.”
“Thank you for being there tonight. I wouldn’t have been able to get through that without you.”
“Oh, pish. If I didn’t look after the two of you, who would? Now, why don’t you go have a shower and then come downstairs for a cup of tea?” Her smile turned mischievous. “Or maybe something stronger, if you’d like to share one of my herbal soothers with me?”
Again, no answer. The only sound in the room was Jo's breathing, harsh and uneven, too loud in the silence between bursts of thunder. Sherlock crossed the threshold into the room carefully, edging around the foot of the bed and letting the old floorboards creak under her shifting weight. The last thing she needed was to startle Jo and make things worse.
Jo boggled at her. “Wait – Greg and
Some more details get hammered out.
Jo shook her head. “No, it’s not that. Sherlock and I - no, this was our first pregnancy. I -” she took a deep breath, exhaling shakily. “I had an abortion, in uni. Sherlock doesn’t know.”
The puppy whimpers at the disturbance before noticing Sherlock and wriggling out of Jo’s hands to crawl over and snuffle at her face. Sherlock gasps, her eyes immediately filling with tears, and sits up, scooping the tiny, wrinkly puppy into her arms. “She’s
“And,” said Jo, walking over to Sherlock and taking her hands, “I think if you’re really serious about wanting to start a family, then… I think it’s a great idea.”
you were in the army. But a slit throat was too much for you?” She was teasing, but still looked worried.
Time passed strangely, each day seeming endless; and yet it seemed like Jo had barely blinked and two weeks had passed. The bleeding from the miscarriage had stopped, and then it was almost like she hadn’t been pregnant.
“No, it’s just… When you were -- when I was -- I didn’t know how to help, how to make you feel better. So I did some research. And it said… it said that sometimes, after losing a child, couples can fall apart. The grief and resentment and… everything, it’s too much, and they separate.”
The rest of the dinner passed amicably, with the difficult bits out of the way. The two couples chatted easily – as easily as the Holmes siblings ever chat, anyway – about logistics and timelines over pudding and more wine. By the time they had everything more or less worked out, Greg and Jo were both pleasantly pissed and Sherlock and Mycroft were sick of socialising, but amused by their respective intoxicated loves.
“Jo?” she asked shyly, after a moment.
“I think you’re right,” Sherlock said one evening a week or so later, apropos of nothing.
“Hey, sweetheart. Sorry I woke you.”

When Jo crawled into bed after her shower, Sherlock was sleeping soundly, a deep frown on her beautiful face. Despite not feeling like talking and having told Sherlock to get some sleep, Jo couldn’t help but feel slightly put out. She had both wanted and
Greg looked startled, but grinned at her. “That’s fantastic, you two! Congratulations!”
“Not really, no. Do - do you have time to talk?”
“And I need to.. To check on the

"They're fine, Jo. I don't have time to sit around and let you mollycoddle me. I need to practice."
“I’m alright with it if you are,” Jo replied, kissing her head. “You’re sure it’s not too soon, sweetheart? It’s okay if you want to wait a bit longer.”

"Yes. Goodnight, Hamish"
“I hadn’t thought about the abortion in -- god, in years. But now it’s all I can think about. I feel like -- like I’ve done something terrible. I know -- part of me, the part doctor part, knows that that’s ridiculous. I haven’t done anything wrong. But I almost…” Jo laughed humourlessly. “I almost want to go to Confession, as ridiculous as it sounds. I’m not religious, not since I was a child and didn’t have a choice about going to Sunday school. But I almost do.”
"Yes, well, you interrupted my experiment. I had to make sure there wasn't a break-in or something equally tedious." From anyone else it would seem dismissive or uncaring, but Sherlock's teasing tone took the sting out of the words, and her smile made them affectionate.
After they had both kissed Hamish goodnight, John offered Sherlock his hand. Sherlock took it, and allowed John to lead him back downstairs to their bedroom.
"You mean to sit with Jo," Molly teased.
Jo, tired of Sherlock's constant complaints, had impulsively leaned over and pressed her mouth against Sherlock’s, effectively shutting her up.
[14:15] I hear congratulations are in order - JWH
“No, you go to bed. I’d really, really like to be by myself for a few minutes.”
Sherlock huffed and mimed zipping her lips. Jo grinned cheekily at her.
“Wake up, Jo.” Sherlock fiddled with a tangle in her hair, tugging gently, her voice slightly more insistent now.
Jo pulled back, almost afraid to see what Sherlock’s reaction would be, but Sherlock was just sort of sitting there, her grey eyes wide and slightly unfocused and her cheeks flushed pink. It was endearing as hell, and Jo kicked herself mentally for possibly having ruined her chance with her.
“Oh, I don’t mind,” the nurse - Sherlock really should have asked her name - said warmly. “It’s understandable for you to be concerned. Her poor body’s going through quite the upheaval, at the moment.”
Jo rolled her eyes. “Alright, drama queen. My point
“Yes. You were devastated, and wouldn’t let me help. I wish you had.”
“I know how badly you wanted it to work, sweetheart, and I'm sorry you're disappointed. But we'll try again next month, okay?”
Sherlock Holmes, twenty, had been rehearsing for approximately six and a half hours and was, at this point, pushing herself far past the limit of even her (in Jo's opinion) ridiculous endurance. She had a competition in five weeks, an audition for the Royal Ballet Company in ten, and an interview/audition with the English National Ballet in twelve. Jo had barely seen her for the last couple of weeks despite sharing a flat (and a bed) and was, frankly, starting to worry.
, one that we created, together. I just - I think that would be sort of amazing, don’t you?”
Jo frowned, seeming to realise she’d been a bit abrupt. She reached up and tucked a loose curl behind Sherlock’s ear. “Hey,” she said. Sherlock refused to meet her eyes. Jo put a finger under her chin. “Look at me. I love you.”
“Do you want to listen to it?” Jo asked hesitantly.
Jo shook her head again, cutting her off with a gesture. “No, it’s – it’s fine. I’m fine.”
Jo hummed sleepily and snuggled closer to Sherlock. She was asleep almost instantly, and didn’t wake up until the cab pulled up in front of 221.
Sherlock pressed her lips to her forehead, checking for a fever as much as offering comfort. “It’s not your fault. And like you said, there's always next month, right?”
She still wasn’t looking at Sherlock, having buried her face in Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock kissed her head  again, not entirely sure what to say to comfort her. “You’re going to be an amazing mother some day. Any little girl would be lucky to have you.”
want to be able to take care of you,” Sherlock said, snuggling impossibly closer. “So I guess that’s settled. We really are having a baby.”
Sherlock nodded tersely. “Pleasure. Now, could you tell me why, exactly, my wife is in a hospital bed rather than doing her job?”
"I know, love, and I know how important this competition is to you, but you've got to take better care of yourself. You'll burn yourself out."

Thunder roared again as Sherlock crossed the kitchen to the stairs, took them two at a time, and poked her head around the slightly-ajar door to the second bedroom.
Still without saying anything, Sherlock and Jo accepted the cups of tea Mycroft handed them. There was another long, uncomfortable silence while the three of them sipped at their tea.

“Don’t fret, lovey,” the nurse said soothingly, having noticed Sherlock’s distraction. “I’ll let you go back to your sweetheart soon. I just wanted to check in with you. Are you alright?”
“Sherlock?”

“I said, the entire concept of sexual selection and parental investment theory is heteronormative, outdated, and vaguely sexist. It doesn’t take into account the existence of gay or bisexual people.”
"Well, I hope you enjoy the conference anyway," the woman tells John, smiling at him again before turning back to her book.
“Sit down, dear. It’s alright, just sit down,” Mrs Hudson said, her voice stern but soothing.
“I will, thank you. Can you let her know I'm on my way?”
levels – can only work in our favour in this situation.”
Mrs Hudson nodded. “Sherlock said you two had a bit of a spat. Did you want to talk about it? Might make you feel better.”
Miraculously, Thursday arrived without any cases or, in Mycroft’s case, international crises, to prevent the double dinner date. Jo, more nervous than she’d expected to be, had spent the early evening preparing an absurd amount of food and attempting to tidy the flat – a waste of time, in Sherlock’s opinion, since both Lestrade and her brother had seen the flat in worse shape than it was currently.
Something tickled at the back of Sherlock’s mind, like something he’d deleted but shouldn’t have.
Rodriguez’s eyebrows went up. “That didn’t come up in the investigation.”
The memory made John smile a little. The waiter arrived and presented them with menus.  “I recommend the fish,” Mycroft informed John, sweeping his gaze down the page.
Mars must be the general, John thought, and resistance groups in the mountains: surely those were the Islamic militants? Malinowski did not hesitate. “Jupiter may proceed.”
“Faster to use pencil,” Yeboah objected.
The negotiations were quick and amiable--”That’s as high as ye’ll get from him, I c’n promise you”--and ended with John and Sherlock passing a dozen bottles down into the boat, where Greaves carefully wrapped them in burlap sacks and lay them in a straw-lined crate.
“Oh,” John said. He still wasn’t processing at full speed, but he thought he could see what Mycroft was up to. “That’s…that’s pretty good. Yeah. If you can pull it off, anyway.”
“Did you delete Michelangelo?”
Sherlock hadn’t realized he was thirsty until the water touched his lips. He gulped it down, trying not to spill but too uncoordinated to make much of a job of it. The second the bottle was empty he threw it aside, frantic to have John inside him again. Even lying down seemed too much of a bother. John evidently felt the same way, because as Sherlock straddled him he groaned, braced his hands and shoved up.
“Of course not,” Sherlock said, slightly offended. “Endocarditis.”
John peered at the computer on which Sherlock was typing furiously. “You’re a seventeen year old boy who attends Harrow and plays the alto sax?”
“Oh no. God, no. Is that why he—because I texted you that night? Sherlock, is that why?”
“You know I can’t tell you that,” Agra said primly.
“Sherlock.” John put a little snap into it this time. “Did you hear me? Go on and shower and get some sleep.”
“I don’t know, I never had much schooling--”
Sherlock frowned at the screen. “I don’t get it. Where’s the dreadful pun?”
“I’ll pass. Wait a minute.” Lestrade set down his pint. “So that means—have you been a clean a whole month?”
The shepherd returned and proffered the skin again but the prince shook his head, slightly embarrassed at having gulped like a child. “So,” the shepherd said, settling himself against his tree again and smiling that slight smile. “What brings you to the grazing lands of Jesse of Bethlehem? Have you lost your way…” a slight ironic glance at Sherlock’s fine linen tunic “…my lord?”
Then Sally Donovan turned up.
“Ah. Um, I’m not entirely straight…especially back then, I was rather, ah, experimental, I suppose you could say.”
Sherlock must have stirred, because there was a sudden pressure on his fingers—a hand holding his tightened—and he jerked reflexively, thinking
“Nope. I’m back on the rota tomorrow, waiting to hear just like you two.”
“Next week then?”
Sherlock crunched meditatively for a moment and then asked, “How’s John?”
“No stop, stop, stop, I’m sorry,” John said, controlling his laughter with some difficulty. “I had crazy ideas too. I’d learnt girls had another hole down there but I knew what my cock looked like at full size and I thought the hole had to be that big—that they were all walking around with this great gaping cave between their legs—and I had no idea what I was looking at the first time, I couldn’t make out where it was! I was a bloody embarrassment.”
“John,” Sherlock said in exasperation. “You lack confidence, not intelligence. There’s no reason you couldn’t read medicine under him.”
mean it?”
Sherlock stared at him. He understood what Moriarty was saying, intellectually, but the enormity of it overwhelmed and sickened him: now that he was bonded himself, felt John as a part of his own body, the thought of that being ripped away left him feeling physically ill. He remembered the omega he’d seen at Easter, Brendan, with his blank empty eyes. “From what I’ve seen you wouldn’t really enjoy what’s left,” he said, amazed at the steadiness of his own voice.
John swallowed around his dry throat. “What do you suggest?”
Sherlock followed his gaze. “Oh. That’s just Indian burns, it’s nothing. Sebastian wouldn’t really hurt me, even he’s not that stupid.”
Mycroft sighed, got up, and walked out toward the cloakroom again. John ate the rest of his food. The St. Cecilia piece was five minutes long and Mycroft had been gone for ten, what was he doing?
“That’s better.”
Callie took hold of him quite briskly, saving him from any embarrassing fumbling, and OH, all right, yes, that was exciting indeed, he could see now what the fuss was about. John was just drunk enough to be unselfconscious but not too drunk to find this far more pleasurable than he had expected, which was lucky. “Oh God, oh God,” he gasped.
There really is an "Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez" in ACD canon, although it bears no resemblance to this particular crime--but it does feature a secret passage!
Violet was a nanny. The boss in question was a photographer named Jessica Rucastle, who was married to a rock star of fading fame and glory called Davy Dreadful. Sherlock had never heard of him, but John had practically fallen out of his seat when Violet mentioned him—he’d apparently been a fan of either the man’s music or his looks at some point; Sherlock rather thought the latter from the way he blushed when Sherlock stared at him.
“Sherlock,” John said, leaning over Sherlock where he lay sprawled on the sofa. “Why do I have a message from a woman from the Borealis String Quartet on my blog? About a rehearsal?”
“Mmm,” Sherlock said, distracted by John’s thumbs rubbing tantalizingly around his nipples. He was fully hard now, cock pinned where John was straddling him and feeling every nerve ending straining for more touch, more sensation, more
the OK Corral? Was he going the right way? Never mind, he’d find it later.
Sherlock came out of the kitchen carrying two beers, one of which he handed to Lestrade before bringing the other to John.
So when his phone rang and he returned it to his pocket without answering even as his face hardened, she almost didn’t ask. But it was after noon and they’d been avoiding the six-foot incarcerated elephant in the room all morning, and it was just never her way to duck a fight.
Well, he’d thought so too, hadn’t he? That night of the party at least. But John had cut him off and, when Sherlock had been practically handed to him on a platter, had walked away. He might as well have hired a skywriter and proclaimed his disinterest to all London.
“John, do you even speak Norwegian?”
“All right,” he said. He held out a folded note, but the man shook his head.
well. Whatever he needs, I want to give it to him.”
“Have you read it?”
“We’ll have to join a swim club, or something, once you graduate,” John said, smiling down at Sherlock in the water. “Then I’ll swim too.”
And he walked out.
“Well…give it a go.” She nodded toward the carrier. “My…my husband, Paul, he’s terribly excited. Already came over to see her and he’s getting everything ready for when we return.” There was a notable absence of enthusiasm in her voice.
Mrs. Hudson turned up at this point with a large tray, clearly chosen more with an eye toward providing Hobbes with a healthy snack than pleasing Sherlock: fruit and little sandwiches. This did not bother Sherlock in the least. He ate three bananas and so many of the cucumber sandwiches that Mrs. Hudson actually pulled the plate away from him, relenting only when Hobbes admitted that she did not really like cucumber, but found the chicken delicious.
John could not help smiling back. “Maybe a bit of water first,” he said. He helped her sit, wincing and hissing, and brought her a cup of water, which she drank thirstily, and then the wine. He was aware of her considering eyes on him.
Gregson led John back to the cluster of buildings and through a low door into a long, cheerful room, with a fireplace at one end and a stove at the other. A woman and a girl a year or so younger than John sat at a large table, peeling potatoes.
Somehow, in spite of the obliterating intensity, Sherlock did not pass out. But as the overwhelming force began to gradually recede his consciousness followed it out, and he slipped into sleep.
“No. Why would he be?”
“They’re fine, I’m sure the train’s just delayed by the snow,” Mr. Gregson.
Sherlock’s unblinking dark gaze held his. “One of those girls hanging around the door should do. They’re all screaming your name.”
Sherlock shivered a little and his fingers twitched against John’s chest, apparently seeking clothing to clutch. John stroked his hair and Sherlock actually wrapped his arms around him. “Oxytocin,” Sherlock murmured sleepily.
nonsense.”
“Emmy. She was only just four when she died. She had the winter fever. I was seven.”
“Be glad about that. It was a right mess before they reduced it, I saw the before-and-after films,” John told him. “The splint stays on for a week to allow for swelling. You’ll get a nice waterproof cast when we get back…want some more paracetemol?”
“Well, tell him the bit where you fancied him but thought he was off limits, but now that you know he’s all man you can’t sleep for thinking about his big, hot, throbbing…”
“A what?”
The man in Exeter was a hot-headed idiot with a lust to kill and poor impulse control.  After he had spent a week trailing Victoria Trevor, he was so annoyed at being called off that he killed her anyway, just for the fun of it. Moriarty had to keep him around for a few more years because there was a shortage of good assassins in England, but eventually he was able to replace him with Agra, who was an enormous improvement. No one continued Trevor’s research, but in the end, it didn’t matter. Entropy triumphed anyway.
“They organize the militias, I suppose. They’ll go to the landing site, or maybe take on the army here in Scotland…I don’t really know. We’ll find out today.”
“We could go to a bar and get drunk,” Roz said. “I mean, I’m still hung over, but I can’t even begin to think of what I’m going to say to the Hernandezes. I talked to them on Christmas and they were so hopeful when they heard we were making progress…”
The door closed downstairs.
The Lucasville prison was far enough away that Aronsen rode with them this time. She was already ensconced in the front seat when McGinty picked up Sherlock the next morning, deep into what Sherlock assumed was paperwork for some other case. He got in behind her—she had obligingly pulled the seat all the way up—and settled in for the ride. The scenery was pretty enough, mostly rolling countryside, but the day was dull and overcast and Sherlock soon dozed off. He’d been up most of the night before.
The prince slipped away in the hottest part of the day. He left everyone else drowsing at the inn; they had had quite a lot of wine at the midday meal, and it would be some time before he was missed. On his way out the prince filched a cloak—he would give it back along his return, of course, along with a coin ten times its worth.
“Well, no doubt Mrs. Hudson will be up any minute with the tea tray. No dinner today though—I’ve no detective work to be done and you’ve already got all the shopping. Next week for the flowers and errands unless I text.” Sherlock was in a vile enough mood to take a small mean satisfaction at disappointing her, but Hobbes merely nodded, stoically blank. She was wearing her hair in a sort of exploding ponytail today, a style so hideous it actually hurt Sherlock’s eyes, emphasizing her frizzy hair and round face.
John looked back. Sherlock had hung up his coat and was now unbuttoning his jacket, which he draped over a chair. “Draw the curtains.”
Boffin Bill had decided that he, like Galileo, was being persecuted for his misunderstood genius. He had been transferred to a secure psychiatric facility after ranting at the judge in Latin.
“That’s vile,” John managed. He felt sick.
Sherlock smiled radiantly, enchanted to be John’s love. “Merry Christmas.”
Sherlock’s throat closed. He placed his mug carefully on the table, before it could slosh in the cup. So that was what this was about.  Last week had been a mistake, a
“You have a lovely smile,” John said promptly. “It’s universally flattering and impossible to argue with, unless his teeth are crap, and they aren’t.”
“You don’t even know what I was going to say.”
For a minute Sherlock felt the longing flare up like a spark in him, wanting that bright yummy bonbon of a serial-killer case, but even as he reached for it the little flame flickered and died. It was hopeless. He couldn’t even manage the Tube these days, let alone a transatlantic flight.
“Stop thinking. You’ll pull a muscle, looking over your shoulder at the beds like that. You’ll worried I don’t want to sleep with you.”
—in one box, so to speak, and this sex experiment in another. They weren’t even in the same wing of his mind palace. But now it was as though a secret passage had opened between them. He hadn’t wondered, not yet; hadn’t tried to imagine what sex with John might be like, but now he could feel his mind
Sherlock felt a little hurt. He’d been clean for ten days, after all, and rather felt he deserved to be told he looked marvelous, whether or not that was strictly true. Anyway, what could he say?
—and then one of the men was saying in drunken irritation, “Shit, it’s too tight.”
That night, dozing off on the sofa, Sherlock had dreamed. It was not one of his usual nightmares but a good dream, in which it had been Sherlock at whom John smiled with that joyous smile. “You’re beautiful,” John said and in the dream he was, his body strong and healthy and unmarked, and he reached both arms for John and John had laid him down gently as though he were precious. John traced his fingers down Sherlock’s face and neck and over his chest, his touch warm, and Sherlock arched his back and opened for him.
Sherlock was in such a hurry that he forgot to keep an eye out, and he ran right into three other boys from his year, who hated him. This was not unusual. Everyone in Sherlock's year hated him.
“Well, that was a metaphor and of course the physical—“
“Trevor, I tried to have you killed,” Sherlock said. He was trying to sound exasperated, but the thought of what he had been contemplating still made his throat tight.
“Well, fantastic,” Jeff said, drawing him in closer. “That does call for a celebration. Let’s go back to my place and fuck.”
“Sherlock, dear, Sergeant Donovan was here. I told her you’d likely be back quite soon, so she said to tell you she was going to eat and she’d bring you back dinner.” She frowned up at him. “You’d better change out of those things or she’ll think you’re a burglar.”
“I came up to help but he said he was fine getting in the bath on his own, so I went back down to make some hot milk with a bit of brandy, as he wanted. When I came back he was in the bath and said to leave the milk on the little table. I came back and called through the door, but he said he wanted to stay in the bath a bit longer and he’d see himself to bed. So I locked up and went to bed.” Mrs. Reilly looked down, clearly trying to look sorrowful. “It was the last time I ever spoke to him.”
“Sir,” John said, utterly overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I…thank you, sir.”
sake. “Well, come take a look and see if there’s anything in the fridge you fancy, then. I’m not a short-order cook.”
“I want to with you.”
and then dropped it back on the bed. He retrieved his gun and thumbed the safety off.
Sherlock would have let him do anything, but Rowan only showed him how to use his hands, that weekend. For the first time Sherlock wrapped his long, thin fingers round a cock that wasn’t his own and brought another person to orgasm, an accomplishment that left him almost breathless: if he got good at this, Rowan might keep bringing him back! He learned how to stroke them both together, Rowan’s hand sliding over his as they thrust against each other; he understood what Rowan meant about the dancing now. He tried to pay attention and learn what Rowan liked, but it was so hard with the siren song of his own adolescent hormones driving him to orgasm so rapidly.
He was meant to be doing something about Hobbes, but that could wait. At the moment Sherlock felt too drained and exhausted to think about any of this any longer. He nodded and let his eyes fall closed.
“What are you—“
“Five pounds says he gets her to talk, if only to tell him to sod off,” Lestrade said to Mycroft.
Trevor looked up, her smile so faint John was not sure he wasn’t imagining it. “I did,” she said. “When I turned thirty. But I couldn’t be bothered to get it trimmed and it grew right into my eyes. I had to put a hairpin in it all the time; it drove me mad.”
, which he took to rationing, but finally ended up finishing in an unstoppable binge very late Sunday night. He immediately took to the internet to order
“I wouldn’t know,” Sherlock said shortly. It came out more bitter than he’d intended and he took a drink to busy himself.
“It’s Violet, you washed-up wanker!”
“So you, what? You used to work for the police?”
“Help me with the menu? I’m watching my cholesterol,” John said to Rodriguez.
“No. No, she doesn’t, we talked about it once, that’s why she didn’t…”
sweet tea (Sherlock).
“Do it,” Sherlock said. “Come on me,” and Michael did, liberally spattering Sherlock’s taut abdomen and chest.
John took the book back and read, “’I did not lose my heart in summer’s even…I lost it to a soldier’-- aw.” He leaned over to press a quick kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. “And people think you aren’t romantic.”
A brief pause and then John took an audible breath. “I miss you.”
“There’s a swing. Mycroft can push me on the swing.”
“Already done,” Mycroft said. “Sherlock…please be careful.”
“Not yet. We’re stuck on Anthea until she makes a move. But I’m working another case—I’m stuck on that one too, until I get more information—and it gave me the idea that if we go through the phone records and can find more clients…”
Agra sucked the salt from her greasy fingers, thinking hard, and finally decided to wait it out. She already had everything ready—had done for months—so if she got the slightest whiff of anyone coming after her, she’d be gone.
Mycroft pulled out a file—completely for show, Sherlock thought fondly—and read out, “Lily Catherine Watson, born February the first, mother and child both well. At her four month check she was healthy and thriving, albeit on the low end of the range for length. Well, she comes by that honestly, I suppose.” Mycroft put the file aside and looked at Sherlock. “I hope you understand,” he said without his usual archness, “that the fact that this room is not presently crowded with well-wishers and balloons and other horrors is not due to any overprotectiveness on my part. Your doctors believe you need time to acclimatize yourself to your return. They feel you should ‘set the pace’.”
he texted.
Sherlock just nodded. His throat was sore, as though he’d been screaming, and every muscle ached.
“John was my partner, not my assistant. And he’s returned to his former profession. At any rate she’s short-term; I just have her going to the shops and running errands whilst I’m on house arrest.”
“What’s his name?”
Trevor’s flat was small and sunny, surprisingly pleasant, with a kind of barely-lived in tidiness. Sherlock had never seen her rooms at Oxford and he prowled around curiously, but there wasn’t a lot of information to be gleaned: she’d played the piano as a child, apparently did some yoga with DVDs, and ate a lot of frozen dinners. There were books everywhere, but the cozy little window seat seemed never ever to have been sat on. The place needed a cat, Sherlock found himself thinking.
John waited a full count of three hundred after the last breath before he reached for the cold wrist and felt for the pulse he knew he would not find. Then he crossed Robin’s hands gently on his chest, whispered words of heaven and peaceful rest that he desperately wished to be true, and pulled the blanket over his face.
John grinned at him, still feeling enormously pleased with himself. He crossed over and perched on the edge of the coffee table. “So let’s see if I can work this out. You get captured by the pirates…”
“Why didn’t Miss Lewis call the police?” Sherlock asked.
“Our secret,” his father agreed conspiratorially.
A third finger opened him further and he arched up against the pressure of John’s hand.
“Of course you’re right,” he said, taking another drag off his cigarette. “But I’d need to spend a bit of time with her first, see what would be the best fit and so on. Ordinarily I’d be far too busy but as it happens I’ve extra time on my hands right now as well as a fortuitous need for someone to run a few errands.”
“Okay,” he said finally and Sherlock turned back to him. “You’re going to hurt like hell for at least a week, but you’re going to be all right.” He tapped Sherlock’s thigh through his trousers. “Anything under here I need to see?”
“No.“ If John’s voice had been sharp before, now it cracked like a whip. “We are not discussing that. It never happened, it meant nothing, it will never happen again. Do you understand?”
“Hmmm. So how was he killed?”
Then Sherlock came down with an awful hacking cough that resisted all John’s efforts: honey, pastilles, extra pillows. He agreed to see Sarah only after John, worn down by Sherlock coughing all night, threatened to move upstairs to get some sleep.
“Why?” Sherlock groaned, letting his head fall back. “You said no at Bart’s but there’s no one here to hear us, that’s why we’re at the top of this wretched building.”
“Yes.”
AmandaDBone:
They took the men into the studio, where they unzipped the body bag and dumped out a partially frozen corpse of a light-haired woman.
“I did too,” Sherlock whispered and John smiled, understanding.
“That
Molly considered that a moment. “I don’t know about that. What about you? Have you and Captain Watson…”
Ryan might have lacked the courage to take a stand on a suspect, but she was not backing down from Sherlock. She drew herself up to her full height and said coldly, “Get out of my crime scene.”
“With that,” Rowan said, nodding at the wet goop in Sherlock’s cupped hand.
When they had finished the shepherd took a wineskin, drank, and passed it to the prince. The wine was poor stuff compared to what he was used to, but went down easily, easing the last of the ache in the prince’s legs. He handed it back but the shepherd waved it aside: “You have it. Unlike the king, I can’t afford to sleep deeply.”
been planning to sit there—he was done in—but now he realized he’d have to sit all the way forward and then he’d have Sherlock’s cock basically in his face. No thanks. “Take your trousers all the way off. Go on, you heard me…pants too.”
Sebastian was on Sherlock as soon as they stepped into his flat. His big hands gripped Sherlock’s upper arms and pushed him against the wall, pinning Sherlock with his weight as he brought his mouth down. Sherlock tilted his head back and let Sebastian take his mouth, rough and plunging. He was effectively trapped like this, arms immobilized and Sebastian’s much greater weight bearing down on him. He struggled for a minute, experimentally, but he had no hope of getting free. A cold trickle of actual fear sharpened his arousal and he arched his body into Sebastian’s.
“Shit, I just started my sandwich,” Julie said. “Did you lock the doors?”
More days passed. Sherlock looked at his violin, but did not play. His inbox piled up. Mrs. Hudson brought food and every few days he ate a little of it. He slept, when he could no longer avoid it, with the lights on. He waited.
“I could get used to this,” John said happily, wandering out of the enormous en suite. He sat down next to Sherlock, who was propped up with pillows on the bed, staring at a guidebook. “Fancy seeing a few sights when you’re feeling a bit stronger? We’ve got to remember to get a load of chocolates for everyone back home.” He looked over Sherlock’s shoulder. “The Large Hadron Collider facility? I was thinking about the Flower Clock.”
“Every one,” Rodriguez said. “Get started on that warrant request. We want the judge to be able to read the request, so better you do it. They’ll be ready for us?”
John looked up. Sherlock was staring at the notebook in his hand, eyes flickering frantically. “Oh.
the person I was meant to be—in more ways than one, because I wasn’t even sure I wanted to carry on being a detective until I did this case. We’re even now. No one owes anyone anything, we’re friends.”
“Who?”
When the phone rang that night Sherlock almost didn’t register it, thinking illogically
“Good that he enjoyed it. I was glad of the company,” John said, smiling.
“Nice, but you know I can tell when you’re fibbing,” Mary said absently, perusing the menu. “It’s only young women that glow. I look like something the cat wouldn’t bother to drag in.”
Sherlock replaced the tablecloth in the basket and began reassembling the false bottom. Kate came in the door behind him and said, “Car’s ready,” to John.
“Well, let’s get you warmed up then,” John said, relieved at having something practical to do. He crossed to the chest of drawers and found the Siberian Husky jumper by its heft in the second drawer. He ran his fingers over the socks to find the warmest pair, careful not to disorder them, and pulled out a thick wad of wool. It was very soft. Did Sherlock actually have cashmere socks? He took a second pair that felt more ordinary, just in case the first turned out to be a scarf or something.
“Oh good, I’ll read it tonight,” Molly said. “When’s your friend back then?”
“Aren’t you worried your mustache will come off if you kiss her too much?” John asked drily.
As he rode Sherlock worked on the new wing of his mind palace. He was beginning to get a feel for what he liked now: the Sioux man, for example, had been a bit too young and pretty, and Sherlock thought that perhaps he was not much interested in young and pretty. Besides, he smoked. Sherlock had had to take another shower when he got back to his motel just to get the smell of the truck out of his hair; at this rate he was going to run out of shampoo, and where would he get more of his shampoo out here?
“Brother dearest, you're mind has been slipping more and more lately and I'm beginning to get worried.”
John chuckles softly, eyes wrinkling. Having this space kitty as a companion would be quite enjoyable. Even if this charming being stayed only a few more days John would be fine with it, happy that it even lasted so long.
“What?” he said, coming to full alertness again. “You can’t be away in three weeks, that’s a home weekend.” He could not possibly stay at school for an uninterrupted six weeks! The very thought filled him with horror.
“We’ll have three days’ head start,” John finished. “That’s rather good. My sister pulled the same stunt when she was at school; said she was spending the Easter hols with a friend and the two of them buggered off to Amsterdam.”
“So is my sister,” Sherlock said. “Since the age of five. And my brother once started a war on purpose. I’m the underachiever.”
“An utterly ridiculous measure of clinical competence.”
John looked up. Sherlock’s face had gone soft and wistful, and John held the book out to him. “
-- I want to be the
“Sorry, it’s just… it’s all we have of her, and I just… I don’t want to forget.”
I've never really written a scene that's just Greg and Mycroft by themselves, so if any of the characterization or dialogue seems wonky please let me know!!
Sherlock hesitated. “I… I’m okay. Can we go to bed? I just want to be with you.”
Greg should know better by now, working with you.”
“I’d hoped she would look like you. And have your ridiculous cleverness.”
After a few minutes, Hamish's cries slowed and he looked up at Sherlock. "Daddy? Wh - where's Papa?"
The professor took a step forward, frowning thunderously at the continued interruption. “Holmes, you have yet to demonstrate why any of your leftist idealism is relevant to my lecture today. I must insist you stop interrupting, or I will have to ask you to leave.”
“I’ve tried, I really have. It’s difficult, though. I -- I had a nightmare, that first night, do you remember?”
Sherlock huffed and curled in on herself. “It’s a conversation with
"Yep."
then?”
“I… not always, no. When I was younger, I did. But I never thought, after university and -” Sherlock cut herself off and sighed. “I just never thought I could. Between the drugs and being gay, I just… I never thought it was something I could have.”
Sherlock blinked again, surprised. She had been trying to put the pregnancy out of her mind, avoided thinking about the baby they had lost because it was painful, and because Jo needed her. But Jo’s suggestion that she do the opposite, and that she
“Oh. Well, okay then. Great.”
By the time they had showered, brushed their teeth, and curled up in bed, Sherlock was no longer warm and pliant and relaxed. Instead, there was tension lingering in her face, in the way she held herself just slightly too carefully away from Jo.
"Of course, love." Jo cupped her hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and kissed her warmly, nipping at her bottom lip before pulling away. "Go on, then. I'll see you after."
“Ah, right… Um. Will you use Mycroft as your donor, then? Seems like the obvious choice.”
Jo laughed, stunned, and her hands moved almost unconsciously to her stomach. “I can’t believe it. It worked! We’re going to have a baby!”
Jo was washing dishes and humming along to the radio when Sherlock snuck up behind her, winding her long arms around Jo's waist and pulling her close. “Hello, you,” she giggled. “Finished reorganizing your mind palace, then?”
The soup was, of course, delicious, and Sherlock managed to eat most of a bowl before complaining that she wasn't hungry. Jo decided to take what she could get and tidied away the dishes and leftovers while Sherlock stretched out on the sofa.
"You're alright now." He pressed a kiss to the top of the boy's head. "Try and go back to sleep. You're safe now, it's alright."
Sherlock grinned and kissed her. “Sounds good to me.”
Sherlock called for a cab and rattled off her preliminary deductions to Donovan, who jotted them down and then shooed them away, saying, “Try peppermint tea for your stomach, Watson, it always settles mine. Feel better.”
One warm arm wrapped around Sherlock’s shoulders, the nurse guided her to her feet, then out the door and to the nurses’ station. “There, now, let’s get you sorted out here.” She bustled around behind the desk, fixing two cups of tea and fussing with the paperwork.
Jo sort of shrugged. “Well, we’re not sure there’s anything wrong, yet, bee. It’s just a precaution for now, okay?”
“Uh huh. And I’ve been doing some research -” Jo gestured to the papers and notes scattered on the table “- and asking around, and…”
She felt a little as if she was still on the stage performing: confident, untouchable, and a tiny bit light-headed. Part of her wanted to scoff at the ridiculous sentimentality of it -- she had placed well in competitions before, obviously, but this felt different, somehow. After the crisis of confidence she had had a few weeks before Sherlock had been pushing herself, re-choreographing her solo and striving to perfect it in such a short time, and the plaque in her hands proved that she had succeeded, and that it was worth it.
, then pecked her on the forehead and disengaged herself gently to find pyjamas, ending up in just pants and an old cotton t-shirt.
"S'not... not like you... Being helpful." The worst of the attack had passed by then, leaving Jo shaking and exhausted and out of breath, wiping embarrassedly at the tears on her cheeks.
“Come on, love, bedtime,” Jo said. She kissed the top of Sherlock’s head and jostled her gently, waking her enough to stand up off her lap.
“You don’t have to talk, then, you just have to eat something.” Mrs Hudson replied sternly.
"All right, then." Jo turned off the shower and stepped out, wrapping a towel around herself before turning back to her girlfriend. Jo draped one towel around Sherlock's shoulders, then used another to pat some of the water from her nearly-waist-length-hair. Once it stopped dripping, Jo used a third towel to gently dry the rest of her, pressing chaste little kisses to whichever bits of skin were close enough.
The professor cleared his throat loudly and cut off the threatening argument, resuming his lecture as though nothing had happened. Hardly any of the students were listening at that point – most of them were talking quietly, or texting, or staring at Sherlock like they didn’t quite know what to think of her. The professor pointedly ignored them and raised his voice just slightly over the noise.
Luckily, the house wasn't very big; Jo made it outside and around the corner from the crowd of police and nosey neighbours before throwing up. She stumbled on - something? A tree root? - and fell, still gagging. When her stomach finally stopped heaving Jo rolled away from the mess and curled up on her side, determined to lay there and sulk until she felt a little bit better. Or at least until her head stopped spinning.
me, remember.”
The day of the competition, Sherlock had commanded attention onstage in a sequined black leotard, black platter tutu, and a tight, black mesh veil over her face. Her pointe shoes had been dyed black for the occasion, and she wore long, elegant black gloves with sharp feathers along the outside edge. The new choreography was as harsh as it was beautiful, all dramatic leaps, sharp, precise movements, and graceful, sensual transitions. She was hauntingly beautiful, ethereal under the harsh stage lights. The audience adored her.
"Of course, sweetheart. Got all the conditioner out of your hair?"
"I'm not hungry."
, and Sherlock could hear it faintly. It didn’t sound like music, it sounded like...
Sherlock made a disgruntled sound, but seemed to wake up enough to stuff her feet unceremoniously into her shoes. "You're a terrible bully, did you know?"
Dr Singh gave Sherlock a slightly indulgent smile,  then turned to Jo. “Did you want to tell her, or shall I?”
, Sherlock.
“Sweetheart, could you – Sherlock, why aren’t you dressed?” Jo’s voice was fondly exasperated when she caught sight of Sherlock, curled up on the couch in her favourite blue silk dressing gown and little else.
to coddle you and do everything for you. It doesn’t make you useless. Miscarriage --” Sherlock broke off again and sniffled, holding back fresh tears. “Losing a baby is -- I can’t even imagine how that feels, Jo. She would have been mine too, yes, but it’s not my body. And all I can do is try to make it easier for you. But we’ve hardly spoken for the past
Sherlock giggled. “Don’t make me laugh when I’m sulking at you, that’s not fair!”
For once, Sherlock did as she was told. She took several deep breaths, calming herself slightly. “A few nights ago,” she began slowly, “I got a phonecall. From - from the A&E where Jo works. She’d been admitted.”
“Nightmare,” Jo said shortly. As much as she appreciated Sherlock being there, she didn’t much feel like talking. “I’m fine.”
though! You’re losing blood and clearly uncomfortable and at risk for any number of infections and complications! Is it such a bad thing that I want to take care of you?”
Jo squeezed her closer. “Thank you, love.” She sounded much more relieved than Sherlock had been expecting. “Any suggestions?”
Jo lifted Sherlock’s hands to her mouth and kissed them. “It’s a big decision, love. But we’ll talk about it, alright? I’m not saying no.”
“You don’t want to?”
“Yeah,” Sherlock agreed, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Happy birthday, love,” Jo replies, kissing a stray tear off her cheek.
"A bit, maybe," Sherlock admitted. "But Irene Adler is in my category again this year, and she beat me by half a point last year because the judges liked her music better, and --"
Eventually they both dozed off, curled up together on the sofa.
, to watch such a tiny creature develop into a person with opinions and ideas. A brand new mind, a new
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” Jo said gratefully, taking the pot from her and setting it on the counter. "Did you want to stay and eat with us?"
as the donor last time. I didn’t think you were overly picky,” she said as she settled into bed next to Jo.
"Of course, sweetheart." Jo kissed her again, hard and quick and full of promise for
Johanna.” her voice softened. “You’re hyperventilating. You need to try and slow your breathing down.”
“Jo?” Sherlock asked sleepily, shifting closer and wrapping long arms around her. “Are you alright?”
“I’m not hungry, Mrs H, but thanks anyway.”
“No. I'm cooking breakfast.” Sherlock sounded indignant.
Jo dried out the shower with her own towel and hung it over the rack with Sherlock's, then brushed her teeth and headed through to the bedroom.
“Mmm, so I see. Unfortunately, I'm a bit busy at the moment…” Jo trailed off, teasing, and felt Sherlock mock-pout where her lips were pressed against Jo's neck.
Jo took a deep breath through her mouth, trying to ignore the smell, then held her breath and looked more closely. She immediately regretted it, gagged, and rushed out of the bathroom.
Jo’s already pale face went paler. “How low is low?”
With that thought in mind, Sherlock set herself to the task of boxing up and shoving aside everything she was feeling: her residual anxiety and fear and panic; her grief and sorrow and loss; her disappointment and anger and bitterness. All of it, set aside to be dealt with later, if at all. She focused instead on Jo, on
Moving slowly, Sherlock sat cross-legged by the foot of the bed, in Jo's immediate line of sight but not in her space, present but non-threatening. "Johanna? It's Sherlock. Do you know where you are, Jo?"
There was a long, uncomfortable pause. Then:
After several long moments of uncomfortable silence, Sherlock cleared her throat. “Is… did she - um. Is she - Is the…?”
“There’s no need to be political, Holmes. I’m sure all of that is irrelevant to our discussion today…” the prof – who, Jo noted, was one of the oldest in the department and staunchly heterosexual (not to mention more than a little homophobic) – trailed off awkwardly. “Now, as I was saying –”
“No, I'm not. Did you - nng. Ouch!”
Jo hesitated. She was tired and achey and needed a shower - and probably a good cry. “Thanks, but I doubt you actually want to listen to me whinge any longer. I think I’ll just take a quick shower and go to bed.”
This morning though, with her mouth feeling foul from having forgotten to brush her teeth and her stiff body complaining at her, Jo felt decidedly less relaxed. The room was still dark; it was far too early for her to have woken on her own, especially after having stayed up so late the night before. For a few moments Jo lay very still, trying to figure out what had woken her.
“Well, it’s starting to burn.” Jo unplugged the toaster, making the toast pop. She'd been right - the toast was just barely light enough for Sherlock, who flatly refused to eat it if it was even the slightest bit burnt.
Jo tugged Sherlock up on the bed with her, wrapping her in a hug. Sherlock was shaking. “Shh, I’m alright. I’m alright, sweetheart, shh, it’s okay. I’m okay.”
Sherlock stepped back, frowning thunderously. “Jo. I barely touched you. If you're not interested, you could have just -”
“Shut up, Sherlock, one bowl of soup isn’t going to hurt you, no matter how many calories are in it.” It wasn't often that Sherlock got fussy about what she would and wouldn't eat to keep from gaining weight -- she had an absolutely enormous sweet tooth -- but it happened occasionally before a competition. Jo suspected that it was nerves, but didn't dare bring it up.
Ahh Hello again and thank you for making it till the end <3
“I can’t believe him sometimes.” Sherlock pouts, remembering all the other times Mycroft wouldn’t leave him alone until he had gotten what he wanted. Frustrated, it takes awhile to continue his research. Looking down at the chubby creature, Sherlock finds similarities between it and another species on Earth, visible to everyone who isn’t completely blind. However, Sherlock doesn’t want to classify these monsters with animals from earth since they are obviously different, it might become confusing. However, this little thing seems different than the rest, definitely smarter in Sherlock’s opinion. Its small paws have a layering of intricate spikes that ride in a line up to its shoulders  and hide behind its quills. A perfect design that had Sherlock wanting to look at it for hours on end.
Ordering Sherlock downstairs to eat, Mycroft is extremely surprised by how quickly he shows up. Sherlock finishes eating rather quickly before rushing back into his room, bidding Mycroft goodbye.
A few minutes after they part ways, John’s little buddy begins to wake, his formerly invisible mouth showing as it yawns and stretches out its limbs. It jumps off and begins to walk beside John, floating at his eye level. He decides to get a cabbie and after a few tries he gives up and waits at a bus station. He did have somewhere to go other than the grocery store today. Some others stand around.
I am deeply sorry for the 50 years it took me to write this chapter. Lots of stuff has been happening.
He’s sitting on the grass, with a sketchbook. John and Galax are luckily situated behind this man, and John is really testing his luck as he sneaks out of the bushes to get closer to the man.
“The...I saw you drawing...the, um, the creature that was in front of you. I, uh, saw...I thought you could see them too?” John cringes at his words, the crack in his voice in the last sentence. John immediately starts regretting ever following Galax.
In front of him is another unearthly creature, roughly resembling a platypus. Bright orange colors most of its features. Its mouth and tail showing a dark brown. It’s lazily on its back, absorbing the sun and making a noise similar to loud snoring; its chest heaving up and down in a peaceful cycle. A tongue-like structure slips from the side of its mouth.
Galax was still with them as they sipped from their cups, John taking a bite out of the cinnamon bun he ordered. Sherlock stares intensely at John, causing him to feel flustered, but John realizes that it is not he who Sherlock’s attention is on, but Galax. He chuckles at the thought which causes Sherlock’s assessing gaze to focus on him. John looks up from his cup and locks eyes with Sherlock, smirking. Galax lays down, curling around Johns neck, its vantablack eyes closing, leaving its galaxy themed fur to show in its place. Sherlock looks back down as it does this and then sharply back to John in a questioning manner. John smirk turns into a smile as he continues eating his cinnamon bun and silently sipping his tea.
Jolting awake, Sherlock’s brain realizes it’s morning as the brightness of the day shines smugly into his eyes. Trying not to go blind, Sherlock maneuvers his hands until they find the drapes, throwing them to the right, effectively blocking the rays of destruction from hitting his abused pupils.

Sherlock looked down at John’s hands, then back into his eyes as he shakes it firmly.
“Sherlock plea--”
From: marymorstan42
John didn’t even realize he had fallen. He looks at his hands before scrubbing off whatever was on his face where Galax had pressed its “tongue” to. He feels exposed and hurt for what the thing did, but John doesn’t understand fully what in the hell just happened. He just looks at Galax in disbelieve, not feeling strong enough to move.
“Beginning to get worried?” Sherlock turns around, though he leaves his right hand on the desk so the orange being wouldn't leave him. “You’ve been pestering me like mother for the past 10 years. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when you kept at it even when I moved out.” Sherlock’s glare cut into his brother, but he showed no sign of falter at what Sherlock spit at him.
Galax is still going crazy when John finally finds the canvases he was searching for, grabbing a few and trying to fit them in the cart. He suddenly feels his phone buzz in his pocket. Checking it, he sees Mary’s email and clicks.
The two share a moment together, the creature getting comfortable on Sherlock’s hand, the silence soothing to Sherlock’s loud mind as he admires it.
Warning: slight sadness in the beginning of this chapter.
Sherlock looks away, back at the sleeping donut laying on his hand. “Mycroft, please go.” Sherlock murmurs, trying his best to make it sound confident, but Mycroft knew he didn’t mean it this time. Mycroft leaves the room, but he heads to the kitchen collecting dust, and begins to cook Sherlock a meal with whatever his men had placed in the fridge the week before.
John H. Watson wakes up to the smell of freshly cut grass and the obnoxious roar of Mrs. Hudson’s lawn mower across the street from his cramped flat. Popping an eye open, only to quickly shut it close once more with a wince. The sheer brightness of the sun shining straight into his eyes causes him to groan and turn over. Huffing in exhaustion as his face hits the pillow. He lazily opens his eye again, only to be greeted by a small cat.
John didn’t know what to think of it. Galax just kept spinning and zooming around like a psycho. It kept going even as John browsed the store. He tried multiple times whispering to Galax what was wrong, but they just kept flying around in between John’s legs at super speed. John sighed in defeat, there was no way of telling what had Galax so excited about.
From: marymorstan42
John feels like this sudden rush of adrenaline was the only thing making him do this, but for once, he chased after one of these strange creatures. He quickly found Galax, but they run so fast it was extremely hard to keep up.
“Coming with me, yeah?” Galax rubs his cheek against John’s in response. He sighs. “Alright then. It’s not like anyone will be able to see you anyways.” He adds quietly, stepping out into the hallway.
Motivation found, Sherlock hurries, packing all his stuff and quickly running out the door; his little companion stuffed into his shirt pocket, bouncing slightly as Sherlock jogs towards John house. Sherlock sends a short text to inform John of his arrival, mentioning a huge discovery he's made.
Making his breakfast like usual, he’d occasionally look out and spot Galax still sitting prettily upon his bed, the sheets circling around it. When Galax spotted him, its tail twitched before swishing side to side seductively, as if trying to get John to walk over and pet its divine fur. It works immensely, John is powerless against the pull of its cuteness.
Checking his phone as he left, he found a new message in his inbox:
“Bless you,” someone says offhandedly after John lets loose a sneeze. Galax looks up at the interaction for a few seconds, looking to and from the lady and John before alerting John that the bus was almost there by jumping about and pointing to the left with its tail. On the bus, John looks out the window, watching the buildings go passed him and feeling the slight rumble of the road as its driven on. He huddles his bag closer and looks over at Galax, they’re staring intently out the window, as if it was something it’s never experienced before. Maybe it hasn’t, but the stillness it kept, minus the moments the bus shook, was surprisingly stunning and make John smile. Its weight on John’s right knee comforting and light.
John suddenly feels a little twinge of regret at not trying what Sherlock did, but he doesn’t feel it for long because Sherlock’s antics were probably more annoying than Sherlock described and it was most likely the reason the creatures didn’t fancy the only other person who they could interact with. John sighs. “I never really felt I had to find out. When they would hang around with me for a couple of days and then leave, I didn’t chase after them like some crazy ex--” at this Sherlock scowls rather cutely, “--they can leave whenever they want to, I don’t own them. Although, I have always wondered where they came from and what they are, I’d rather imagine because I’ve already come to terms for quite a while now about the fact that I’m probably never going to find out any real answers since for so many years I thought I was the only one who could see them.”
“You’ve been trying to figure out why there are creatures roaming around our ‘plane of existence’ since you were ten.” John repeats dumbly. Sherlock nods his head, taking a sip of his tea. They’ve been here for nearly 20 minutes, time going by as they chat about numerous things. John ends up ordering something else in embarrassment because the waitresses kept giving the two men looks, waiting for one to get something other than two teas and a cinnamon bun.
“Really, John, it’s not that weird to want to discover the origin of these creatures. Surely you’ve tried to find out, haven’t you? They are extremely fascinating and they seem to not only visit areas such as this world,” Sherlock explains. John gives what he said a thought.
Muttering swears under his breath, John continued on his way. Rushing a little bit faster so he could get home earlier and hopefully never have to leave the house until work called for him.
It sneezes all over Sherlock’s face.
“I also shared those thoughts of believing I was the only one. However, now that I know there isn’t any medical reasons as to why I see these exotic organisms, we can both work together--” Sherlock surprises John by grabbing his left hand, but Sherlock just as quickly lets go before John can react, “-- to find out the truth. I’ve been trying to find out whether or not it’s possible to communicate through words with these creatures, but as you know, they don’t seem to like me. But you, John, have a talent for attracting them. And that thing on you is the evidence.” Sherlock points at the still napping cat splayed over John’s shoulders.
“Just get the groceries and leave. That’s all you have to do.” John said quietly. He continued to tell himself just that as he quickly bought everything on his shopping list, waited a thousand years in the checkout line, until he finally was able to leave.
The creatures that would sometimes visit him in his room in his younger years never stayed. They always disappeared sooner or later, and John never let himself feel that sad about it, always reminding himself that they weren’t his. He learned to enjoy their random appearances rather than wish it lasted longer.
Ha ha. Very funny, Marie.
In a few strides John is already leaning over it, he brushes his fingers through its surprisingly thick fur and nuzzles its small nose. Its fur is endless, John realizes. He’s sure to not bury his hands in too far, they soon just graze the top. Roughing it up before smoothing it out again.
John rolls his eyes and puts his phone away, grabbing a couple other supplies before heading to the checkout.
Something about these...things always hinted to John that they were something that leaked from another plane of existence into his. He never knew why he seemed to be the only person who could see these beings, but it’s not like he asks everyone he meets if they can see the alien-like creatures drifting about the city too. Even to himself he can admit he sounds like a screw got loose in his brain.
Mycroft knew better than to believe his little brother when he pleaded and swore they were real, that they were just as clear to him as Mycroft was.  It seemed hopeless, trying to convince Sherlock he was hallucinating, but now as he tried again, Sherlock seemed different, more confident that nothing was wrong with him. Mycroft tried his best to pry into the new delusion that had Sherlock convinced to maybe help him, but no such luck came.
The man’s mouth opens, then closes. His eyes seem to bore into John. He finally speaks. Clearing his throat first. “Sherlock Holmes,” he states. “It has been quite interesting, this past minute.” He pauses to look John up and down, eyes squinting in concentration. “You can see these little monsters as well?”
30 minutes go by in a flash when the orange gets bored and prepares its chubby body before it jumps into the air and begins to float towards Sherlock’s closed eyes. It whimpers until sherlock’s eyes swiftly open, widening in surprise by the monster floating an inch away from the tip of his nose.
A young girl even spilled some of her hot coffee on him! John isn’t worried the stain. No,  the thing that pissed him off the most was the fact that it was boiling hot. How she was even taking sips from her cup was a mystery to him. She barely whispered an apology before running to wherever she was heading, John listened to the clicking of her heels mesh into the noise of the city.
Sherlock barely notices the huffs and annoyed grunts coming from the creature, too busy writing every little detail about the events that just transpired. However, what the little thing did next truly captured Sherlock’s attention; it did a couple of pushups on the side of Sherlock’s bony right leg before gathering enough momentum to jump off and start lazily floating upwards until he landed on top of Sherlock’s hand, its plump body a comfortable weight. Sherlock, for once, allows himself the luxury of letting out a smile of amazement. Of course he knew these creatures could fly, but never has it been to get closer to him.
Hope you guys enjoy!
If John had known that following these creatures would lead him to another person able to see them, he’d have done it much sooner. Mr. Holmes, or Sherlock like he always insists (says ‘Mr. Holmes’ reminds him of his brother), was a rather strange man. However, with his strangeness excitement followed closely behind. The two had went out for tea that day, after John had dropped off his groceries of course. Sherlock’s snide remarks about his apartment based off what he could view from the entrance way weren’t subtle, but John’s glare at Sherlock caused him to shut his trap and walk out into the hallway as John was putting away the last item that needed to be refrigerated.
John snickers at the word ‘monsters’. Galax, and all the other creatures didn’t seem like monsters at all to John. “My name is John Watson. A pleasure, Mr. Holmes. I’ve...never met someone else who could also see these beings.” John nervously holds out his hand for Sherlock to take. Sherlock didn’t really look like someone you could just approach and shake hands with. Looked more like a statue that was well respected.
It wiggles around some more before getting comfy on Sherlock’s lap and continues its previous nap that got rudely interrupted by Mycroft.. Its little quills moving in beat with its snores.
Hi y'all. How ya been?
“Oh? Why should I tell you about that? It’s pretty personal.” John teases, his smirk returning full force. Sherlock rolls his eyes dramatically, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed. He then sits up, and begins to explain what he’s been doing for the past twelve years.
“Out. Leave. Now. I’m perfectly fine.” Sherlock announces, turning back to his desk, looking out through the window.
Don’t forget the extra supplies has been moved to room 303, John. Don’t want a repeat of last time, do you? LOL
“Sherlock...” At this, Sherlock glances slightly over his shoulder. His brother’s voice, scarily enough, was brimming with emotions. Hurt, genuine worry, and something else Sherlock wouldn’t like to acknowledge. “I just want...you to be okay.” At this the brothers stay still, no words passed between them. Something that hasn’t happened in years.
A few beats pass before either of them say anything.
“But how do you know they don’t just travel here? It’s not like you have a written copy of their schedules. You said yourself they don’t like you much. And I sure haven’t been able to communicate with them even with my several encounters.” Sherlock looks extremely annoyed, though John thinks if he wasn’t paying attention he would’ve missed it the slight change in his companion’s face.
The orange stray wiggles awake and Sherlock watches as it squirms back onto his lap, flopping off the edge of Sherlock’s desk and making an “oomf” sound as it hits the ruffled blanket. Sherlock pauses so he doesn’t bother its quest for a comfortable seat.
Sherlock gulps nervously, these stunning monsters have never ever come to him before and stayed with him for longer than 5 seconds. He hoped this time he wouldn’t misstep and scare it away like he’s accidently done to other creatures who’ve shown slight interest in him. He slowly picks up the 2-pounder and brings it to his face, looking it in the eyes and waiting for something to happen.
“I’m rarely ever able to get close to these creatures. They always run away and I only ever see them outside my house. I thought they treated everyone like this since they never bothered the other people in the city. However, I see now that I was mistaken.” Sherlock pauses for a second looking back at Galax before continuing. “I’d like to hear about your other experiencing with these creatures.”
If John’s gasp of surprise didn’t alert the man of his presence, then Galax’s very loud meow certainly did.
Galax is extremely enthusiastic about being pet. It isn’t that surprising, John thinks. It’s not like these creatures are constantly showed affection by, well, anything on this planet. It continues to make John feel like he really is the only one who can even interact with them! John wonders for a second whether or not these creatures can interact with each other. Surely there are more than just one cat-like creature roaming around, and what about all the other creatures he sees? He’s never been alone with more than two surprisingly, but when he goes out into the fresh, more accurately polluted, air of the city, he sees a literal highway of creatures above him. A lot of the creatures swooping down and flying into the different shops. Some even ride on the huge creatures in the sky, looking down at the people below as they rock side to side with the movements of the ship sized creatures. It’s truly fantastic to look at which causes John to usually bump into people because he’s too busy admiring the system going on up above him. The creatures seem so different from each other that John starts to think they’re from separated dimensions but he absolutely loves the idea that they’re all from the same place. It inspires him to paint what their world might look like, their space, their planets or planet. Maybe they have their own cities and history similar to humans, but he accepts that he’ll most likely never find out the real answer to that.
I had gotten halfway through this before I remembered I had responsibilities to take of
Feeling like he was being judged by some space cat, he begins to push himself out of the warmth of his sheets. Galax, which John decides to refer to it as, doesn’t seem to mind, but continues to watch John from its spot on his bed.
As John gets closer he can see what the man’s drawing. Or should he say painting. The man’s art tools come into view. Yet what catches John’s eye is not the many greens in the man’s painting, but the bright orange center.

Sherlock looks up in a hurry, he had curled up on himself unknowingly. The orange circle was still in Sherlock’s home, on his weathered coffee table, slipping on the papers, causing them all the glide to the floor. Sherlock sat up and restarted his mind. Wiping away the sleep from his eyes, he began focusing on more sensible explanations.
Being slightly distracted that morning, his usual routine took longer as he goes over everything from last night for the millionth time. However, he forces himself to stop after he spends 10 minutes brushing his teeth. After getting dressed, he opens the door to his room quietly and looks over at his desk where he suspects the cheese ball to be sleeping. His guess is faultless as his eyes note the orange ball climbing his computer screen, causing his little green feet to type random letters onto Sherlock’s word document. Sherlock quickly walks over and tentatively picks it up, then erases its paragraph of “6”s and “8”’s.
He looks in awe as the monster nudges its face against his nose before diving for his hands. Sherlock worriedly watches as the monster gets comfortable in his palm, hoping he wouldn’t cause another attack. Sherlock’s mind went into full reverse, it couldn’t be him… The little thing looked so calm, seemingly drifting back to sleep. Maybe these monsters were more intelligent than other animals on Earth. They could be just as advanced as humans, but have extremely different ways of life. So much was to be discovered and it makes sherlock’s heart race the more he looks at the one… creature that has cooperated with Sherlock.
It seems to purr as it spins effortlessly in circles, standing neatly on its tiny toes as it stares into John’s eyes. John finds that its eyes seemingly blend right into its exquisite coat.
Getting dressed doesn’t take long, and soon enough he’s opening his door when Galax jumped onto his shoulder.
John rolled his eyes and sent his reply:
Eventually Galax stops behind a bush. John collapses rather loudly beside it and begins to catch his breath as he looks at Galax. John follows its intense gaze and sees a dark haired man.
They continue to talk the hours away, sharing stories of their encounters with the creatures during their childhood. The conversation heads off onto different topics, and John’s even able to make Sherlock laugh (it was more of a small chuckle) when telling him when he was passing by a chemistry class in college, he witnessed an explosion right in a guy’s face. The bloke’s name was Jake or James, John can’t remember it too well since it’s been quite a while since his school days.
The man spins around fast. Wide eyes looking into John’s equally, if not wider, eyes. John feels his heart to a flip. Unsure of what to do, he continues to gawk at the man and sputter. Galax jumps onto John’s head, frightening John and making him flinch and backup. In less than 1 second the man is already standing and still staring as he takes a few steps towards John.
Sherlock decides to move some of his stuff out of the way, and rests his head against his arm, the desk stable beneath him as he allows himself to catch up on all the sleep he’s been missing.
This chapter is a little bit shorter than the last one, but I have a lil surprise in store for chapter 3 and I can't wait to get it finished and publish it for ya'll!
Then I couldn't think about anything for a while, bU T  I did get this done without taking 5 months so -- success, definitely.
A nearly gray slime floating in the air rather than staying on Sherlock’s nose and cheeks. He loosens his hold on the creature as he watches the gray bubbles slowly climbing upwards into his roof before disappearing. It takes Sherlock a minute to fully come back to his senses and he starts typing even hastily than before, accidently dropping his little squeaker onto the faded blanket he had put over his legs to save money on the heating bill once the chill had started to really bite at him.
It continues its staring.
The cameras Mycroft had installed had shown Sherlock hadn’t eaten at all. He only came out of his room and left, leaving everything else alone as he rushed off with his paint bag and canvas. Mycroft got the hang of cooking at quite a young age after a while of having to deal with sherlock’s damaging behavior. He always talked about monsters glowing in his room and zooming through Mother’s garden. Mycroft tried to get rid of these ideas from sherlock’s head, but as the years went on, Sherlock’s condition seemed to stay the same, Mycroft was the only one who knew about Sherlock’s visions.
Inside, Sherlock has paused--faltered if you will. His entire body frozen in motion as he looks wide-eyed at the thing that just squeezed itself through his dull, blue wall. A small prickly animal, grunting cutely as it waddles passive-aggressively towards the center of Sherlock’s desk. Sherlock still doesn’t move a muscle as it squeaks in front of him and rolls all over Sherlock’s papers, sniffing everything in its path.
The nurse knocked on the open door to Jo's room and poked her head in. “Someone here to see you, hon.”
Molly smirked, but let it go. "Well, I was looking for you, anyway, they want the dancers to start gathering for adjudication."
Sherlock squinted sleepily at her. “It’s the middle of the afternoon.”
Neither woman spoke for several more minutes. Mrs Hudson nudged Jo gently off of her shoulder and towards  the abandoned bowl of soup, which Jo picked at listlessly.
"You're worrying me."
Sherlock, slightly more awake now, becomes aware of how awkwardly Jo is holding herself and the soft, quick sound of panting breath - not Jo’s - and looks up.
“Sherlock? Are you alright?”
They fell silent, Jo stroking Sherlock’s back and hair until they were both calm again.
“Alright, genius, of course you did,” Jo said, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “Tell me how you knew, then, go on.”
"You've already danced, love. Whatever happens, happens, yeah?"
“Sorry. I’m – more anxious about this than I thought I would be,” Sherlock admitted.
“Mmm, ’course it wasn’t. They love you, you know.”
Sherlock woke, hours later, to the feeling of John's hand in his hair. (Of course he knew it was John - obvious.) "Sherlock?"
your fault. Sherlock knows that. She adores you.” A pause. “In fact, she asked me come check on you, she’s terribly worried about you. You’re not eating enough, she said.”
“I've been home all day, sweetheart. Everything okay?”
Sherlock very rarely takes off her wedding ring, but now she does, slipping it off to touch her fingertip to the tiny engraving along the inside.
"G'night, little one. C'mon, you. I'm knackered"
The two sat in comfortable silence until Jo finished the braid. She pressed her lips to the crown of Sherlock's head as she looped a hair elastic around the end. "There. Gorgeous."
"But there's no way that --
“You’re welcome, sweetheart. Happy birthday.” Jo kisses her again, then scoops the wiggly puppy out of Sherlock’s arms and uses her paw to bop Sherlock on the nose gently. The pup protests the manhandling squeakily, so Sherlock steals her back, laughing, and cuddles her close.
"Of course I do, sweetheart. Especially when you blush. You turn the prettiest shade of pink." Jo went over to the bed and cupped Sherlock's face gently in both of her hands, then pressed quick, soft kisses to her forehead, her cheeks, her nose, and finally her mouth.
Sherlock sighed and pulled her closer. “I know. I love you.” She kissed the top of Jo’s head and closed her eyes.
Let me know what you think! And thanks for reading :)
Sherlock hummed but didn’t answer. She snuggled even closer, pulling the duvet up to her chin. “I still think using a sperm bank is a good option,” she said after a few moments. “Just to keep in mind. I mean, people adopt all the time – you don’t need a biological link to be a ‘real’ family.”
"Almost immediately. Is everything settled at the hospital?"
"She's been admitted, actually."
“Goodnight.”
“She told me everything,” Mrs Hudson replied after a long moment, “I’m so sorry, dear.”
Sherlock kissed her back, but didn’t answer verbally. They sat there in the quiet for long minutes, wrapped up in each other. Healing. Together, finally.
“I talked to Mrs Hudson, and she said she’d be able to watch her when we’re busy on cases, so it shouldn’t be a problem. She was so excited when I told her what I was planning for your birthday,” Jo tells her, grinning. She looks so happy, so proud of herself for having surprised Sherlock, that Sherlock can’t help but to lean forward and press her mouth to her smile.
wanted Sherlock to be awake, to pull her close and comfort her before they fell asleep together. Scowling, Jo curled up away from Sherlock and tried hard not to think of anything until she fell asleep.
"Thank you."
“Coffee first,” Sherlock grumbles sleepily, pressing her face into Jo’s stomach. “Missed you.”
"Will come and kiss you goodnight as soon as she gets home. Sleep now." Sherlock gently carded her hand through Callum's hair and dropped another kiss on his forehead. Shifting so that they were laying down, she cradled the small boy in her arms. Callum hummed sleepily and snuggled into his mother's chest. He was asleep almost instantly.
Jo looked up. “Hi Dr Singh. Thanks for coming in to see me so quickly, I know you were on your lunch break.” Her voice took on a falsely cheerful tone. “And please, call me Jo. I’m a patient tonight, after all. And this is my wife, Sherlock. I don’t think you’ve met?”
[09:16]
“Ha, ha. Real funny, make fun of your poor wife when she’s got a stomach bug.”
The cab pulled up and Sherlock bundled Jo into it, tucking her protectively under her arm.
days was if she came downstairs to use the loo or make herself a cup of tea - which wasn’t often. She had tried knocking on Jo’s bedroom door each day at breakfast time to offer tea and toast, and again before she went to bed, but after two days of stoney silence Sherlock gave up. She had been giving Jo space, mostly because she had no idea what else to do, but now she was worried. Jo wasn’t eating enough, was isolating herself, clearly wasn’t doing well, and Sherlock
“If Doctor Singh isn't with her, and if she has it on her, then yes. She's going to be fine, but she wants you here. Oh, and if you could bring her a change of clothes, I'm sure she would appreciate it. Something comfortable.”
[09:15]
Sherlock nearly sagged with relief. “Thank you. I love you too.” She paused, then said, “And I’m glad we’re not shutting each other out anymore. I didn’t like that.”
“Oh, Jo,” Sherlock’s voice was soft and sad. “I’m so sorry, I forgot it was still in your email. I’m so sorry, love.”
“I’m not sure,” Jo replied, her voice quiet and sad again. “I hadn’t really thought about it. I always sort of liked Grace, though. Or Katherine, maybe.”
and he could map out everything and nothing about John.
“Something on your mind? You've been unusually quiet.”

“Angelo's. But first, to the pawn shop!”
He had always seen a bit more than his father and, later, than his mother, a bit less than his brother, but the difference was more like a step or two on an imaginary stairway. When he went to school, he found it quite peculiar that the other children failed to notice what was right in front of them. It was

They had finished their meal, so he stood up abruptly and signalled a taxi. The ride back was quiet, and as soon as they got home John retired to his room upstairs. Sherlock let his attention drift back to the case,
back to how their kiss felt, the softness and curves of lips, the feeling of victory and his elevated pulse. He pulled a piece of paper and left John a note.
“Not right now. You'll see. Now hurry, criminals don't wait up!”

After reflecting deeply, he decided that what he and John Watson had, felt like a friendship, that is to say, felt like something he'd never had before.

And the thing is, Sherlock
“Oh, so you’re the only one who can make the rules?” Sherlock said furiously. There were two bright spots of color high on his pale cheekbones. “You get to decide when, where, how? Don’t I get a say in this at all?”
“Well, I didn’t say…wait. Are you serious?”
Actually Sherlock had spent several happy years learning ballet before deciding on his arrival at Eton that his enemies had enough ammunition, but he was not about to admit it. “Do you have a problem with waltzing?”
“Who?”
“And jam.”
“Not the same,” Sherlock said, hitting the pause button. Then he picked up the French horn, lifted it to his lips, and blew. A horrible squawk issued.
“And I’ve even got sugar for you. But I need you to make me a promise, and before we sleep tonight.” Sherlock looked up quizzically and John said, “I know how clever you are at planning escapes. I want your word you won’t try to give me the slip.”
When he was quite young, Housman fell so passionately in love with his (straight) roommate that he failed his exams. He remained devoted to this friend, Moses Jackson, for the rest of his life, rushing publication of his second volume of poetry so that Jackson could read it before his death. He even wrote a poem for Jackson’s wedding (to which he was not invited) that echoes Sherlock’s toast in TSOT, describing himself as the friend who yields “you o’er/To her that hardly loves you more”.
After that was finished, and Mrs. Hudson had been calmed down and packed back off downstairs, John filled the kettle in the bathroom—the kitchen, now in the last stages of demolition, was completely unusable—and they shoved all the furniture back into place. John plunked down in his new chair with a contented sigh. “I think you’ve got this too close to the bookshelf,” he said to Sherlock.
John drained his cup of coffee. He was going to need more. Maybe a whole pot. With whiskey.
The scene in John's bedroom = Sherlock's dream at the end of Chapter 6.
“I like your smell,” Sherlock said decisively. “You smell like laundry soap and shave cream and sweat and tea. And a bit like sex, which is all right as it’s with me.”  He someone managed to nestle even closer, which John wouldn’t have thought possible. “Mine,” he murmured.
“Kitchen knife.”
“What is…what?”
Sherlock lowered his head to John’s and said in a deep, velvety rumble, “To make you jealous.”
“I heard from Molly today.” John was gazing meditatively into the fire, holding his own mug loosely. “She said your tox screen was clear--that’s, what, two and a half weeks? Is that....”
John rolled his head toward Sherlock. “Let me ask you something. If it had been you that night in Magnussen’s office, if you were the one with the gun and the secret—would you have shot Mary?”
The tall one made a disgusted noise. “Is no Nadia,” she said. “English men all say Nadia, Nadia, Nadia. Is Ruslana.” She pointed to herself. “Yulia.”
John clenched his jaw but stayed quiet. They were all motionless, staring tensely at the screen, where a small knot of icons moved slowly, then quickly, then went still. If John were there he could have helped, could have taken care of this Neptune so that the others could get on with
“Come to bed with me,” he said softly when they reached home.
Molly and Sherlock exchanged another glance and finally one of the other abbesses said, “He’s in the cells, Abbess.” It was the euphemism for being in heat.
“He’ll be all right,” Alfred said comfortingly. “Dr. Woodcourt’s a good doctor, he’ll soon get him sorted.”
Harry met them at the door. She was clear-eyed and smiling, but John thought he detected a slightly desperate edge to her voice. “Oh my God, you must be Molly! Are you really as nice as John makes you sound? Stay here, I’ve someone I want you to meet.” She kissed John’s cheek.
“Wrong.”
He could hear the warmth in John’s voice. “I miss you too. Be careful.”
Only John knew that wasn’t it. The upheaval of his life that had occurred on 29 January was due not to the birth of his daughter but to Mycroft’s words. Up until then John had always assumed that Sherlock cared for him as much as he was capable of caring for anyone—which was more than most people would believe—but still nothing to build a life around. But now he spent hours staring into the dark, wondering. What if. What if. What if.
When Sherlock had drunk half the cup, John took a deep breath and said, “Okay. It’s obvious you’re ten steps ahead of me here, have been for ages, and I’m not going to pretend I’m happy about that. But this isn’t the time or the place. So just go ahead and fill me in on what happens now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You don’t?” John said, bewildered.
Of course. “You said Brother Hosea had been cleared to get out of bed? Had he seen the midwife or the doctor, some sort of postpartum check?”
Lord Sherlock agreed to a break without fuss, so John led the horses around to the far side of the pond and took off their bridles, wiping them down and replacing them with rope halters. He took them down to the pond and let them drink, idly watching Lord Sherlock on the other shore; he now appeared to be tipping mud into a glass vial. John shook his head, thinking
Sherlock opened his yes. “Sorry, what?”
,” Dr. Woodcourt said.
There. He opened his eyes. Better than “Please God let me live”, anyway. He slid the needle home.
In the kitchen, John poured himself two fingers of whisky whilst he ran over ideas in his head. He’d had several after the first time, but there was no need to use them all at once. And now he found himself a little fixated on the image of Sherlock on his knees…he collected what he wanted and made his way to the bedroom.
This made John a little nervous, but he supposed it did not really matter. Once Irene received Sherlock’s letter she would return to Blastburn and arrange accommodations, and they would simply escape the hospital before Sherlock’s return to school. As Tank had pointed out, it was far easier than escaping Bart’s.
Julie stuck her head into the breakfast nook where her stepsons were still gobbling cereal. “Guys, I have to call my work,” she said. “If you keep it down and clean up your stuff I’ll drive you to school.”
Sherlock took a cab to his hotel and checked in under his
Sherlock stared. “No.”
“Where to now? Lestrade?”

, including whole villages in the mountains, and he was caught up in the sweep. I don’t know more details than that; my contact was able to ascertain only that his name—well, that of his alter identity—was among those arrested.”
Sherlock melted against him in relief. John had not thought it possible for his heart to break more tonight, but it was aching now. There was a great deal he still didn’t know—the path from “rough” to viciously raped and beaten was fairly murky, for one—but this was enough for one night. One thing was clear, and that was that Sherlock’s injuries were not the only reason they were going to be taking things extremely slowly. Sherlock’s heart was a guarded, fragile thing, and John had no intention of treating it carelessly.
“Fair enough.” Sherlock crouched, wincing, and started untying the shoelace binding Nicholl’s feet. After a moment Meg knelt next to him and went to work on his wrists.
Greedy little prat, John thought affectionately. Lucky for him he was such a terrific shag. And that John loved him, of course. Not that he would be letting Sherlock know
Sherlock, meanwhile, was having a fine time in the storerooms.
“Are they sure it’s him?” Roz demanded.
“That was meant to point up the lack of—“
"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force," said my companion gravely.
“Dr. Watson, I’m Simon Fallows.”
“I’ve got it, thanks.” John had put Mrs. Hudson’s insulated carrier in with his shopping. It had been nice to be in a proper grocery for once—he’d finally be able to make the thing with the peas. “And thanks for the ride and the lunch. I’m glad we had a chance to meet.”
Sherlock scoffed. “I told you—

“Well, of course. I don’t want
Apparently they had resolved the names issue. “I can’t even get myself into trouble right now. If any comes by I’m keeping it for myself.”
“It isn’t the same for you,” Sherlock went on. “And it shouldn’t be. If something happens to me it will hurt you terribly, but you’ll survive and one day you’ll even be happy. I
Agra checked the angle and moved the body a bit to her left as Holmes continued. “Ricoletti took advantage of your distraction and shot you.”
“Hey,” John said, surprised. “I thought you were still out of the country. Is that for me?”
Sherlock didn’t realize he’d gone over his time until Ella followed him out to the waiting area, where a thin young woman perched anxiously on the edge of a sofa (eating disorder, abused by her gymnastics coach as a girl). He heard the murmur of their voices (Ella apologizing, the girl nervously reassuring) as he ducked into the toilet, where he planted himself on the closed lid and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and John knew with a sinking feeling that he wasn’t fooled in the least. “Anyway,” he said quickly, “it’s your turn now anyway. You have to tell me another of yours.”
could probably manage it. All I have to do is get them out of the way.”
“Come on,” Sherlock said and threw himself in, peering at his phone’s screen to see the map coordinates showing where Mycroft’s people had traced Mary’s car. “Go south and pick up the main road.”
“Yeah. It was really long…here.” Violet held out her phone and Sherlock studied it. The screen showed Violet in what was evidently a selfie, a long mane of glossy, red-brown hair flowing over one shoulder.
“I’ll forge it for you,” John interceded, swinging the camera around toward his face in a vertigo-inducing swoop. “I’ve gotten pretty good at your signature over the years.”
But if course, it didn’t work out that way. Because when the summer came it brought the Woman, and Mr. Brocklehurst, and everything changed.
“Oh, I heard you.” Sherlock’s clear voice cut across Mr. Brocklehurst’s angry snarl. “I was merely wondering if you were asking a rhetorical question, or if you actually did not understand what you were seeing.”
“Of course.” Sherlock limped to the little organ. “I apologize, I’m not very proficient at the organ yet, but it approximates plainsong better than the violin.” He settled himself painfully on the stool and began to pick out a mournful little melody. “This isn’t mine, it’s a twelfth century piece by Hildegard of Bingen, but it will give you an idea…”
Twenty-four days. Twenty-four days of nausea, tremors, insomnia, craving, burning, itching. Five hundred and seventy-six hours, give or take, and every one of them felt as though it lasted years. Was he really going to let it all go to waste?
This section has one remaining chapter, and after that the next section is much less grim. Pinky promise.
John looked to Mrs. Gregson, who smiled, and said, “Of course, if you’d like me to.”
“Yes!” Sherlock was frustrated enough to get angry himself now. “Of course I did! Were you not even
“Here, I’m here,” John said, and he was, crossing the cold floor swiftly and kneeling beside Sherlock. He pulled Sherlock into his arms and pressed an open water bottle to his mouth. “Drink this.”
“No, go on,” John said without opening his eyes. “You’re the one who needs sleep. I’ll go when you’ve finished.”
especially not before…
“Oh, I’m not going to kill you.” James’ eyes lit with malicious glee. “I’m going to burn you. I’m going to burn the
The week had been as relentlessly gloomy and dreary as a week in November could be, but the weather forecast had called for clear skies again Saturday. John had decided to take an earlier bus out and hike around the dales a bit, so he’d packed a rucksack instead of his overnight bag and threw in his boots.
“Oh Christ,” John whispered. He slid off the sofa to kneel in front of Sherlock, but Sherlock had bent forward again and was curled over his knees, his fingers clenched tightly on top of his head. He was horribly afraid of saying the wrong thing, of being unable to make Sherlock believe him, but he had to try. “Sherlock, please listen to me. There is nothing you could do to make me hate you, nothing. That you had to—that you were put in that situation, where you had to, because of me—Jesus. Jesus.” He was afraid he would be sick and clenched his jaw, trying to steady his voice. ”Please, Sherlock, please, tell me if you can forgive me, tell me I can still make this okay.”
John’s vision went white with incandescent fury. Sebastian Moran was in Sherlock’s bedroom—
Sherlock straightened, smacked his head on the low ceiling, and cursed in German. “Nothing happened. It never even came up, Father had rather other things on his mind.”
