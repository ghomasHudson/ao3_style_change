"That’s the point!" Sherlock snarled but John shook his head and drove forward again, Sherlock wasn’t having this, he knew John had a rough night but he needed
, to share John’s heat and make them one. Sherlock had risen from his seat, tea forgotten and ignoring the strange look Henry had given him as he retrieved an ointment from the first aid kit below Henry’s sink and then proceed to the bathroom when his Omega was.
"There’s one just down the hall." John thanked him and dismounted the stool he was sitting on to shuffle off, unaware of the eyes following his every move. Once he was secured in the bathroom, John slipped of his jacket and jumper, then unbuttoned the red shirt beneath to slip that off too so he could get a look at the marks on his shoulders in the mirror behind the sink. They had already turned a painful looking purple and the bullet wound scar on his left shoulder was lit up a bright red.
’, you should know that our rooms have special sealing in the walls that prevent any pheromones from attracting any unwanted visitors." John blushed and cleared his throat.
"I’m waiting for an explanation, Inspector.
leave. It was better if Sherlock let John wake up properly and gather his thoughts before speaking to him about anything, besides Sherlock had to go to Henry’s and pick up some of his drugged sugar, which was the only possible solution he had managed to come up with the night before. Narcotics.
"Look, as long as we solve this case quickly and get back home, I'll still be able to call ‘round Harry's, well actually... I may head to Sarah's this month since my last three heats I’ve been on my own and I'm gagging for it to be honest." John's eyes got a little glassy there at the thought of spending his heat with a real Alpha, even if it was only Sarah. Sherlock noticed the change in John’s scent and pupil dilation and growled under his breath, the possessive sound brought John out of his little hormone induced fantasy and he shrugged apologetically at Sherlock.
’ he breathed a sigh of relief, if John was only going to a park then he would be safe, thank God.
. Please." John begged and Sherlock started to run.
"Yes."
"NO! Cold turkey, we agreed no matter what. Anyway you paid everyone off remember? No one in a two mile radius will sell you any." Sherlock growled again but finally huffed in partial defeat, he hated it when John was right, true it wasn't often but he still hated it.
"Yes, sorry, yes, excuse me." He said before blowing his nose on the train napkin he had clutched in his hand. Sherlock saw John smile from the corner of his eye and his face relaxed from the slightly irritated expression it had been displaying.
"You know you never let me touch your things. Oh! Chance'd be a fine thing." She snorted and Sherlock turned to her, glaring and barely supressing a growl.
“I’ll be outside if you need me Sherlock.” Molly told him and closed the door gently behind him but he didn’t hear her, his eyes were locked onto the blonde man on the bed who was fast asleep and breathing gently, a sight Sherlock never thought he’d see again. Sherlock took a deep breath and inhaled the Omega’s scent that filled the room and almost crashed to his knees in relief, instead he took quiet steps over to the bed and slid a hand gently through John’s soft greying hair.
“Sherlock wait, I need to make sure John’s still asleep remember?!” Molly whisper shouted at him and he gave her a pleading look, all he wanted was to be with his family. Molly’s gaze softened at the look on his face and she gave a tentative smile.
"YOU JUST SOLVED ONE BY HARPOOING A DEAD PIG!" John screamed back, though to be honest he still hadn't gotten the full story on that yet but he did get the gist… he hoped.
“You should be fine to just go in, I checked in on them when Mycroft text me to tell me you were on your way, the nurses and midwifes pretty much stay at the main desk area and in the nursery at this time of night and John was sound asleep with the baby, but I still think you should let me have another quick look before you head in, ok?” Molly asked and Sherlock growled at the thought of any more time passing before he got to see his mate and child.
"Here to see the queen?" John asked just as Mycroft turned a corner.
"A bit. It won’t happen again." This seemed to mollify John but then a worried expression crossed his face and he gestured to his abdomen.
"I called Henry-" John started but Sherlock interrupted him, trying really hard not to tackle the Alpha scenting the air above them for John.
them as a matter of fact so John was sure that him being pregnant would put Sherlock off, maybe even make the man leave him despite the newness of their bond but now... John wasn’t sure he was right. Sherlock was acting like John would leave
"Yes but they were-." Sherlock was having none of it though and just dismissed him before standing up to head into his room to retrieve his dressing gown that he had needlessly abandoned for this pointless exercise.
looking forward to telling Sherlock the good news.
Now back to Sherlock’s original point, Omega’s were sensitive to emotion before, during and after a heat so if one got it into their head that they wanted to bond with a specific Alpha, well, that’s what they’d do. Of course that’s taking into consideration the fact that most Alpha’s would consent to a bond, Sherlock on the other hand had no interest,
"Nice scary inspector from Scotland Yard who can put in a few calls might come in very handy." John concluded and Sherlock looked at him, as ideas go, that was bloody brilliant. Hand it to John to come up with something so simple yet so
"I'm not." She replied and Sherlock snarled and jumped up to grab his harpoon again, Mrs. Hudson looked back to John for help and he gestured she suggest a cup of tea.
." John replied and then gave Sherlock a gentle kiss, Sherlock kissed back but was clearly a little uncomfortable at his secret being found out by the one person he was trying to keep it from and of the endearment so he pulled back with the excuse of phoning Angelo’s to order their dinner.
Speaking of John, the little Omega finally ambled into the room just as the kettle finished boiling and Sherlock smirked at the flushed, satisfied look he was wearing, he looked beautiful, Sherlock couldn’t wait to see what that look would translate into during a heat. John gave him a quick smile and then turned his attention over to the table where the three men sat, Sherlock felt the pull of jealousy that John’s attention wasn’t on him anymore but pushed it away, it was for the best that John’s attention wasn’t completely focused on him right now so he could get his task done.
. Nothing overly complicated just
." John rolled his head towards Sherlock in question.
bring more Holmes’ into the world for a while? Two is quite enough for me at present, ta." Sherlock smirked and John blushed a bright red and looked away.
"Sherlock, I’m fine, promise." Sherlock pulled back gently to look at John and determine if he was being truthful but what he saw there must’ve satisfied him because he nodded at John however he still dropped to his knees and lifted John’s clothes out of the way so he could nose around his stomach. John’s eyes softened along with his smile as he carded a hand through Sherlock’s hair and let his mate nuzzle and sniff at his belly for as long as he needed, Sherlock did this multiple times a day now and it always made John feel warm inside.
"John, where did you get such a ridiculous idea?" Sherlock asked, tipping up John’s chin to look him in the eye, John frowned.
"Putting the bags in the car, John. Really I thought that was obvious." He drawled smugly and John narrowed his eyes and gabbed his finger towards the detective.
It was just so...
"Oh! Apparently so." Sherlock quipped, gesturing towards his brother and they both burst into laughter. Hm, this had been a good day so far, maybe when Mycroft insisted he put on the clothes that had remained unnoticed on the table between the couches, he could con John into another quickie.
." John managed to march a little further in front of Sherlock who was only just managing to keep his tongue in his mouth.
John looked up at the Alpha gazing down at him, pupils blown, face and chest flushed and John’s lubricant still dripping from his chin, he looked magnificent and after tonight John was going to belong to him. The Omega lifted his head to the side, presenting his neck in submission to the Alpha and Sherlock surged down to sink his teeth into the soft tan flesh, breaking the skin so John’s blood would run down to mix on the already come and lube soaked sheets before surging back up to kiss John hard.
"Ok, I've looked there twice now and I can't see it! So ... Where is it John?" Sherlock growled and John smirked, happy to notice something that Sherlock didn’t for a change and strode lazily over to the open wardrobe in Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock wasn't far behind and appeared just in time to see John pull out the folded, purple Shirt from the shelf at the bottom.
his friend and he’d just basically told him to his face that it was all a lie, that’d he never
"You don’t even know what I was going to ask you." Sherlock pouted and John scoffed and crossed his arms.
As it turned out, it proved to be easier than he expected since Henry had somewhat of a sleeping ailment the night before, which was odd because Sherlock was sure that John had told him he’d given Henry something to help him sleep. Sherlock did notice that Henry seemed a little antsier today though, still, it was no concern of his how the moron was feeling, he’d got what he wanted and made his way out and back towards the pub. He had bigger things to worry about than Henry Knight’s mood swings.
"But what if it’s not a word? What if it is individual letters?" He answered and showed the edited page to his partner and just like that, John caught on to what Sherlock was getting at.
"Sherlock, what are the chances of the bathroom being just as destroyed as this room?" John asked, dreading the answer.
Sherlock never knew he had a hair pulling kink before but when John tugged his head back to lay kisses and licks on the long expanse of pale flesh he called a neck, he almost came.
." Then there was a click and Sherlock shoved his phone in his pocket and turned so John’s back was pressed against their car before reattaching his lips to the wanton little Omega. They kissed, sucked, licked and moaned for the ten minutes that Mycroft had said it would take for arrangements to be made before the detective pulled back from John’s lips, not far though, just a breath away from touching him.
"It was perfect." He whispered but John still looked worried.
Sherlock was about to ask directions to this park when he caught sight of Henry’s therapist, sitting up at the bar with a large glass of white wine in her hand, clearly this would be a golden opportunity to get some information of Henry’s situation. The only thing was, he was rubbish at interviewing people, it was John who was the master charmer, not him, somehow he didn’t think that John would be up to doing him a favour though, still he had to try and when John was finished talking to her, he and John could talk and he could tell John about
"This better not be another one of your crazy mood swings, Sherlock." John huffed, Sherlock winced and felt an immense amount of guilt fill up his chest, he hadn’t meant to muck John about, he just had a hard time dealing with his emotions and instincts, and he
“How Long?” He asked.
"I meant what I said, John." He said suddenly serious but John was already dozing off.
"Always rely on John to send me the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself." Sherlock smirked and nearly rubbed his hands together in glee as John started to panic and get defensive.
"Yeah, sorry about that... I may have spent a bit more than you assumed as well, it came to-" John started guilty but stopped when Sherlock held up a hand.
Poor bastard.
"Would you put these away?" He asked, Mrs. Hudson’s eyes narrowed.
"What’s that?" Sherlock asked pointing to a fenced up area between the Hollow and Baskerville, John looked through the binoculars and blinked a few times, was that a...
and no one would be able to stop him because John was
"No." John stopped eating again, his fingers gripping tightly at his knife and fork.
"John..." The man just cut him off and strode forward to warp his arms around Sherlock and buried his head in the man’s coat.
"Yes, well, I just thought that I should at least get one thing for the baby, it was only polite." Sherlock sniffed, John’s grin softened. If this was Sherlock’s way of contributing then he wasn’t going to make fun of him for that, this tiny scarf was the beginning of Sherlock proving just what a fantastic father he would be.
"It's
. John’s eyes widened and he screamed, his arm snapping around to grab Sherlock’s hair and press the man’s face against him hard whilst his tongue and fingers fucked him over and over again ‘til his arse was gushing and fluid was running in streams down his thighs and Sherlock’s chin.
"Who’s
"Er. We did say fifty?" John had to hold in the smile that threatened to break free as Sherlock twitched and handed him a fifty pound note before jumping up to stalk off in a mood. John sighed happily and finished off his drink before he stood to follow, he would need to stop off at a bathroom after he’d caught up to Sherlock though, pre-heat erections were such a bitch.
"Grab that map and those binoculars; you’ll need them." Then he was out of the car and climbing up the largest rock to get a look around, leaving John sitting for a moment wondering what just happened. The truth was John wasn’t the only one uncomfortable with the silence, Sherlock was demented with it, don’t misread the situation though; he did like quiet, it let him think uninterrupted but after what happened... Sherlock was feeling a little
coming down then?" He asked completely baffled and Sherlock strode back in for a moment, excited.
"What?"
"A hound, out there in the Hollow. A gigantic
." Lestrade knew he’d been rumbled but still tried to stick to his story.
He spent most of his morning driving but stopped back at that rock formation he and John had been around at the start of their trip, he mimicked his pose atop it again and stared into Baskerville, he’d have to think up a way of getting back in there so he could test his theory about the bloody sugar, perhaps, just this once mind, he could lower himself to call...
"Nothing?" Sherlock asked and John knew immediately what he was asking, of course Sherlock would assume that the reason John was reading the paper was to look for possible cases for Sherlock and not just because John wanted to read the paper, still, John started flicking through the papers for anything interesting for the detective.
"He’ll be fine John; he just needs time and quiet to think. Now I don’t know about you but I’m hungry and knackered so what do you say we head back now before we both drop?" Sherlock asked impatiently and climbed into the car, John raised an eyebrow at him and hopped in the other side.
"Okay, Sherlock, okay... Remember yesterday when you pinned me down and clamped your teeth to the back of my neck? How I just gave in and submitted myself to you?" John asked seductively and watched pleased as the anger left Sherlock’s eyes and was replace by burning lust and satisfaction.
Then they went to the Hollow and everything had fallen apart, it was all that stupid bloody Hounds fault! None of that mattered at the moment though as Sherlock finally managed to get his arse in gear and jog back down to the bar. Sherlock made a quick sweep of the pub on the off chance that John had returned but was disappointed when he saw no sign of his gorgeous little Omega, Billy saw him looking around and called him over.
"No." John said bitterly.
There goes his appetite.
! Before the man did something he would regret. Sherlock, sensing the Omega beneath him was distressed instinctively tried to soothe him by running his tongue along the underside of John’s jaw, unfortunately it had the opposite effect and John nearly jumped a foot in the air.
." John gritted out and Sherlock had a feeling that if he didn’t concede at least a little bit, he wouldn’t be able to indulge in his new found fondness for sex for a
"Stop it!" He pressed John harder against the wood, snarling in John’s face and sinking his fingers into John’s shoulder. The smaller man whimpered in pain and pressed his chin to his chest, breaking any eye contact and hiding his neck to avoid further angering the furious Alpha. Sherlock didn’t seem to care though, the display only made him angrier and he pulled John forward to slam him back against the jam.
Sherlock swallowed at the end of his speech, never having voiced so much emotion in his life, he was well aware that it was entirely out of character for him but he didn’t care, his relationship with John and their child was on the line here and he wouldn’t lose them because of something so trivial as a misunderstanding. He couldn’t bear to look at John throughout his speech though lest he lost his bottle so when John slid a hand across his cheek to guide his eyes back to his own Sherlock was shocked to see tear tracks painted across John’s face and the man sniffling.
"That’s Grimpen Village." John said and again pointing behind him, making Sherlock’s gaze shift again and then John glanced back to the map.
"Sounds like a good place to start." The detective confirmed John's fears and bit back a chuckle at the
"Mr Holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!" Henry called desperately and Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks, something about the way he said that was just.... Sherlock stalked back over to Henry who had his full attention now.
"So where are we off to anyway? It’s still a ways to Dartmoor, shall we call a cab." John asked when they walked out onto the street, Sherlock just huffed and started walking towards the car park.
’ murders, Greg caught a whiff of me and as he’d just split up with his misses again, offered to help me through it. I agreed." John said calmly but Sherlock’s eyes were still flashing, he was going to have to go down a different route.
"Say that again." Henry looked relieved.
"We need to get you back to the pub, back to our room so you can be somewhere warm and comfortable." Sherlock explained when John whined at the loss of his Alpha’s body, John whimpered again when Sherlock pulled back to sit properly in his seat and followed Sherlock over so he could rub his cheek on the man’s shoulder whilst the detective started the car and began the trip back to ‘
"Envious?" John asked sarcastically and leaned back in his chair, this he had to hear.
Although that thought would make the next part of his plan slightly easier to go through with; part of John’s punishment for letting that useless lump inside his lovely body. When Sherlock finally entered the room where Lestrade was interrogating Gary and Billy, he had steeled himself to go through with his plan, he really didn’t want to do anything to harm John and he’d make sure no physical harm would befall him but still... no, he had to do this. Lestrade was flicking through a book of sales records when he strode in but looked up at Sherlock nervously when he heard the man enter, Sherlock just gave him a smug grin and padded over to the little mini kitchen off to the side to prepare some coffee for John.
John jumped at the loud noise so close to him and nearly slammed his head against the roof of the car, panting from fright, John threw a look over his Shoulder to see Sherlock standing outside the car again, bags at his feet and a clean pair of trousers on.
"H-how long do we have before you’re...?" John had to squeeze his eyes shut in concentration.
"I don’t think no’s and option right now John." Sherlock husked and ground his erection forward into John’s soft Jumper, all the while moaning like a porn star, John swallowed and felt a twitch under his trousers. Sherlock must’ve felt something too, if the smug look on his face was anything to go by, the consulting detective started pressing his arse back into John’s crotch and rolling his hips slowly against the man,firming John's arousal, John who started panting and whose arms had uncrossed so he could reach down to stop Sherlock’s gyrations.
"I promise you, John, this is no mood swing. I’m sorry about...
"Henry, whatever did happen to your father it was twenty years ago, why come to us now?" John voiced trying to ease the situation but it was no use, Henry wasn't listening.
"Mmm. You were wrong. It wasn’t in the sugar. You got it
?" Sherlock rolled his eyes fondly at his mate.
"Sherlock, let me go, please. My shoulders hurt and I need to treat them." John said lowly and shifted his head back against Sherlock’s shoulder so he could nuzzle at the big Alpha’s neck hesitantly, after all he didn’t want another repeat of what happened earlier. Sherlock purred appreciatively though and in turn, shifted so he could nuzzle at John’s hair. John let the mutual nuzzling continue, he knew Sherlock needed to do this even if the idiot didn’t know
"Are you quite alright, John?" He asked and John smiled at him.
"Won’t be a minute. Gotta see a man about a dog." Sherlock told him before dipping to give John a kiss and a nuzzle on the cheek. He felt he owed it to the owner to at least let him know that the dog he had been caring for was dead; John nodded in understanding when Sherlock pulled back and continued eating.
to accept that.
"How’d that get there?" John asked whilst Sherlock shuffled back to sit on the edge of John’s knees.
"Look John, there are plenty of other things in here for you to buy for our child... I’m sorry I snapped at you, I’m just not used to all this...
That was when Sherlock spotted ‘The Cross Keys’ and turned to go down towards it, as they drove down to the car park around the back of the cottagey looking B&B, they noticed a large group of people crowded around a young man, John looked curiously at them but Sherlock only flicked his eyes to them for a second.
"U.M.Q.R.A. Does that mean... anything...?" That was when John noticed something wasn’t right, Sherlock hadn’t said a word and he was all twitchy and breathing deep, John just kept going though in an effort to bring Sherlock out of whatever crazy he’d sank into now.
“Around two and a half hours, weather conditions permitting.” Willis replied looking quite proud but Sherlock was in a hurry so he just ignored the man and jumped in his side of the Helicopter, going through all the normal preparations before Willis could tell him what to do.
Well folks that’s the end of this story, I wanted to go out on a sweet moment before the very end and I hope I accomplished that ^^; and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this as much as I have had writing it.
"Naah. Wonder why?" Slipped out softly as John stood up and rushed away, shoving past someone in his haste to get out of this place, so much for the hope that little kiss on John’s shoulder had given him, it was obviously just one of Sherlock’s Alpha mood swings. John fell to his knees in agony once he’d made it outside, the cramping in his belly that had started earlier only getting worse due to the emotional distress he was under, he was wrong, there was a good chance his heat was due in the next twenty-four hours and if he didn’t find some way of dealing with it then who knows what could happen. John doubled over when his stomach gave a particularly violent twist, he rocked back and forth on his knees for a time until the pains past and took deep breaths and straightened up.
Fortunately for the consulting detective Baskerville had just come into view and he had to drag himself out of his confusing thoughts, he’d need to be firing on all cylinders for this one or risk getting them shot, something told him that, that would make John just a
"Yeah. No choice. So it’s over." Billy finished and Gary sighed beside him once more trying to get Lestrade to see the lightness of the crime.
"Clearly." Sherlock drawled and stared for a few moments before making his way back down the rocks, by the time he reached the bottom, John was already back in the car, he looked upset. Sherlock sighed in resignation at what he was about to do and strode over to the car, got in and sat for a moment.
! Will you just spit it out already?" Sherlock growled and Greg twitched, looking between the consulting detective and John.
locked me in that bloody lab." Sherlock caved and thought it would be best to tell the truth at this point.
Sherlock hadn’t meant to doze off and yet he clearly had since the last time he checked the water was hot but was now luke-warm, bordering on cold. He wondered for a moment what had woken him but then his eyes flashed open and he glanced down to see John shivering against his chest, sweat darkening his hair and giving his supposedly dry skin a dewy look.
"Told you I spent more than you assumed and we’ll be converting my old room into the baby’s room."
, and right now Sherlock was pissed that Lestrade had been inside
"You mean John hasn’t told you?"
"Why do you want that shirt specifically? It's in your wardrobe, Mrs Hudson ironed it yesterday." Sherlock just snapped his fingers and shot off towards his bedroom again, John counted to three before Sherlock came sliding back in.
"Okay fine, you can buy all the mini jumpers you like, in fact why don’t you just have a look around here for a bit and I’ll take the shopping home and ask Mrs. Hudson to put it away, we’ll just order something in tonight from Angelo’s so you can spend as much time as you want shopping in this...
"All right, I’ll find you. Keep talking."
"Is it always like that?" Sherlock whispered when they broke apart and John smiled sleepily.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
when he was reacting to Fletcher, as far as John knew, Sherlock’s irritation had been because of the young Alpha’s taunting. Then again he did assume that Sherlock was infertile so he wouldn’t really have been looking for signs.

, he had no time for them. Once parked they jumped out of the car and started walking past the group of people.
real and no longer that forbidden dream he’d pushed to the back of his mind, John was so busy thinking about how much his life had changed that he lost track of time and was surprised when the receptionist came to call on him.
! It seemed analysing his own mind wasn’t going to help much either, John sighed, closing his eyes and breathed deep.
"I think... I think if you said, specifically, what you wanted, this ‘
of the chest of drawers being tipped over. Not to mention the state of the carpet which was covered in various bodily fluids, even the bloody bed hadn’t survived because of Sherlock’s instincts guiding him to drag the mattress to the empty corner of the room and make a nest of pillows and blankets for John to rest on after he caught an odd, but not unpleasant, scent on the man.
"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It's very promising." That was the moment John lost his temper a little bit, he hated it when Sherlock was like this.
"Sherlock! That wasn’t very friendly; that kid’s world has just been blown apart... no pun intended." John cringed at his own poor choice of words and smacked Sherlock on the back of the head when the man snorted.
"Actually, why don’t you two just head back and get some rest, I need some time to clear my head anyway so I don’t mind the walk." John looked at him surprised and was about to insist they give him a lift but Sherlock was already tugging him in the direction of the 4x4 before he could open his mouth.
"John, you have nothing to be ashamed of, it’s perfectly natural for you to-" Sherlock tried but John interrupted him.
was that?" John still had his head ducked so he flicked his eyes up at the detective who was now glaring at John over his shoulder.
you like tonight." Sherlock swallowed, he really liked the
"Since you’ve been so very good to me today love, I’ll do that
"Yes please, full English with extra bacon, a cup of tea, white, no sugar for John and a coffee for me, black, two sugars." Sherlock was about the stride out of the place when John jumped in again.
opens doors." He mumbled, Sherlock smirked.
Another possessive growl escaped Sherlock's throat and he cursed his stupid biology, this was another reason he hated Mycroft, why did that tubby arse get to be a Beta whilst Sherlock was born Alpha. Uh! He hated everything... except John, John was nice. Whether he was in heat or not, perhaps Sherlock should tell him that sometime, it might make him happy.
"Why not?"
"Of course not, it’s not like you bought bags of stuff, just a little baby scarf and I love you for it. It’s cute." Sherlock’s body flopped a little bit in relief.
"You were
“Mr. Watson, My name is Willis and I’ve been instructed to take you to an area outside of London where you will be escorted by car into the city.” Sherlock just nodded, he didn’t care about that and he already knew where he was going.
"Will that stop me from reacting to this,
"Sherlock’s got a plan?" He asked and cringed when it came out more of a question. He looked over to Sherlock who was lowering his tea mug and smiling strangely.
"Yeah, well I fancied another one." And in that one sentence not only had he confirmed Sherlock’s deduction but also the tone of voice the man used, gave Sherlock the reason for his sudden appearance.
“Mycroft, I meant what I said at our last meeting, the moment it starts, you contact me.”
John snapped out of his daze when he sensed Sherlock’s unhappiness, he gazed at the man kneeling next to him, he looked like a deflated balloon and the look in his eyes was just...
"What’s that, John?"
later. Sherlock took one last glance at Baskerville and then made his way down the rock and back to the car, he had to get over to Henry’s and actually sneak off with some of the man’s sugar, Sherlock hoped that wasn’t as strange as it sounded but still as easy as it sounded.
"It's nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren't listening. Baskerville: Ever heard of it?" Sherlock asked and John pouted a little at the change of subject, Sherlock had to hold back the smile that was threatening to break free at the cuteness of the whole affair. My, my, wasn't he just full of John related responses today, how
"That’s not the bloody same, you idiot! You can’t drive a car by just reading a bloody book! It requires practical know how as well as theoretical!" John snarled and jumped back out of Sherlock’s reach.
pregnant with your child that I’ll be over the moon." John assured the Alpha who perked up when he heard this but gave John a confused look.
"I told you; I saw the hound." John huffed, snuggling Sherlock and making the man smile and rub his chin against the top of John’s head.
"You’re not going to have a dig about it." The Alpha asked nervously.
When Sherlock came to, it was to the sensation of John’s tongue licking his stomach clean of sweat and come and warm hand stroking his thighs, he hummed happily and lifted a heavy hand to stroke through John’s sweat soaked hair, John tipped his head up and rested his chin on Sherlocks hip, smiling up at the detective.

"Sherlock-"
"That’s not a plan." He replied weakly, Sherlock sighed.
“I was not lurking, I just wanted to make sure he was ok… to see him once more before I…” Sherlock choked and trailed off causing Mycroft’s sneering expression to soften. The elder Holmes placed an awkward hand over his younger brother’s shoulder and squeezed gently.
"Bets off John, sorry." He said instead.
people, so you see, I
"Do you want sauce with that?" He tried to distract John but the man was too busy analysing the situation, he really wished he hadn’t showed him how to do that sometimes, still at least their child wouldn’t be able to pull a fast one on them when they grew up into natures nut kickers;
"Don’t you... don’t you want children John? Or is it because it’s
the thought of John leaving him for anything; it was hell just watching John go to the bathroom let alone take a cab journey across London to an unfamiliar surgery followed by God knows how long fiddling with a chip and pin machine in the supermarket.
is shopping." Sherlock gritted out, using John’s name pointedly and then turned to shout for Mrs. Hudson as he grabbed the shopping and headed for the kitchen, Mycroft raised an eyebrow at the bags and used his umbrella to gesture towards them.
"About what?" He asked, eyes narrowed, challenging.
surprise and holding a pint of beer he had just swigged I between John and Sherlock’s little exchange.
"We’ll take you back out onto the moor..." Sherlock began.
"Mind if I join you?" Sherlock drawled and Fletcher looked up at him and gestured for him to do so before turning his back to Sherlock again.
"John, I didn’t say I didn’t want children I said I didn’t like them and by that I meant
pregnant. Why? I’ve already told you that you are in fact carrying my child." Sherlock asked confused, John wasn’t usually this unobservant, the doctor scoffed at him at swatted him on the back of the head gently.
"What the bloody hell was all that about?" He asked but Sherlock just started rocking back and forth restlessly.
Perhaps watching John so closely was not such a good idea, although he did want to keep an eye on the situation he was also aware of the fact he had some serious thinking to do, once he had calmed down somewhat, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that John was right, there was no such thing a monster mutant Hounds, however he did see it so there must be
John and the baby was enough to get him through it and bring him back to them.
"Sherlock, I tire of these games, would you just tell me what is going on?" Mycroft gritted out and a crash came from the kitchen where Mrs. Hudson had retreated to, to make some tea.
“Really Mycroft? Who am I supposed to be? James Bond?” Sherlock asked incredulously when he caught sight of the silver sports car. Mycroft gave a haughty chuckle and came to stand behind his brother.

"You went on the tube like
Hmm...
"Aye! Billy’ll bring your meal out to you." He said and John scarpered out before Sherlock could somehow con him into paying for everything again. There were only two free benches left and John headed over to the one furthest away from the pub to wait for his meal, he didn’t have to wait long though, Billy came out after a few minutes with his plate and a glass of orange juice to place in front of the ravenous doctor.
"Mmhm." John nodded and Sherlock sighed as if John was a child that couldn’t comprehend something simple.
just pissed Sherlock off and he sat down moodily, glaring at the back of the other Alpha’s head, he composed himself enough to force a smile on his face.
’ when I last saw ‘im, must’ve gotten curious." Billy told him and although Sherlock didn’t understand why the man had put emphasis on ‘
"Now, now little brother is that any way to treat you guests?" Mycroft drawled from the comfort of Sherlock’s chair, cup of tea in one hand, umbrella balanced like a cane in the other. Sherlock’s growl didn’t let up; it only got louder, a step away from him frothing at the mouth.
"Why? We’re nearly there." He asked confused but Sherlock was already pulling up next to a large rock formation.
started yet, if it had started then you wouldn't have been able to take a flying leap across the bed and insult me! Secondly you've been feeling strange because my body is preparing itself for heat and that puts a change in my scent that you have unconsciously, as an Alpha, picked up on; that means that your body is preparing itself for my heat and your instincts are telling you to look after me and lastly I didn't tell you because I didn't know we would be taking a merry jaunt to bloody Devon!" John screamed, anger taking over from hurt with every word, bloody hormones, bloody Sherlock!
bit more unhappy than he was now. Speaking of the doctor, John looked over at him curiously when he noticed where they were heading and Sherlock did a little backflip in his head, it was nice to feel the man’s eyes on him again, he would’ve glanced back but he was too busy rolling down the window to meet the soldier approaching.
"You think it’s an acronym?" He surmised and Sherlock shoved his notebook back in his pocket.
"John - bed - NOW!" Sherlock growled  in between kisses and then shoved John hard so he landed on the bed amongst the pillows, the doctor grunted from the force and from Sherlock grabbing hold of his boxers and pulling the right off with his trousers, the pair went flying through the air shortly followed by Sherlock’s and who knows when they landed because Sherlock only had eyes for John’s gorgeous body. The doctor was perfect from the spidery bullet wound on his left shoulder to the soles of his feet and Sherlock had to reach down and wrap a hand around the base of his cock to stop himself coming, it didn’t stop the moisture dripping off the tip and on to John’s belly when he straddled the man though.
"Perhaps..." He mumbled looking away and thought about the way John had gone down on him earlier to let a blush stain his cheeks. John smiled at him and took the offered coffee, taking a sip, Sherlock looked on pleased but then John winced and pulled back.
was it, Sherlock couldn’t take much more of this, anymore Alpha/Omega bonding crap and he’d snap! If he couldn’t forget about that afternoon then he’d do the next best thing, ignore it, it was the only logical thing to do and as long as John contained himself there should be no problem.
." Henry burst into laughter.
, John." Sherlock said disgusted and immediately regretted it when he saw the sad look cross John’s face.
"Ta. I’ll just get your change." Gary chirped and turned back to the till, as he waited John glanced down at a pile of receipts on the counter distractedly, he frowned when he noticed there was one for a large order of meat, far too much for a vegetarian restaurant. John looked up to make sure Gary was still distracted, then he quickly tore the receipt from the pin it was under and stuffed it in his pocket. When Gary turned to give him his change, he smiled and started making small talk, Sherlock strode back into view just as Gary had walked around the bar to stand close to John.
." John whined lowly when Sherlock’s head shot up and he grabbed the phone out of John’s hand.
, lying beneath the quiet and it was starting to piss Sherlock off. Since they’d left Baskerville and John’s little confession behind, the Omega had been acting completely normal and how he could do that after dropping a bombshell like that? Sherlock had no idea,
Omega who was trying so very hard not to look at the tiny fluffy jumpers to their left and it made Sherlock smile, John clearly wanted to go on a little shopping spree in here despite his words to the contrary but Sherlock knew he couldn’t handle any more so he came up with a compromise, even if it would probably come back to bite him in the arse later.
Sherlock wouldn’t have thought anything of it if John wasn’t on the verge of a heat, well, that and the fact he seemed to have grown a quick attachment to Sherlock’s scent. Oh yeah, Sherlock had seen John rubbing his face against the seats in the back, it was why he had ran back inside the pub to grab the air freshener, John was also unconsciously sniffing the air every two minutes to try and get another pull of the detective’s scent but then wrinkling his nose when all he got was a waft of artificial plum. Sherlock had also noticed that although John made sure the mark on the back of his neck was covered up, John hadn’t washed off Sherlock’s... uh ‘
John had the urge to slip his hand into Sherlock’s or wrap an arm around his Alpha’s waist but refrained, it was one thing for Sherlock to want to bond them together behind closed doors in the throes of a powerful heat and share a kiss in the heat of the moment when they were alone, it was another matter entirely for Sherlock to be affectionate in front of other people or so he thought anyway. Poor John nearly jumped out of his skin when Sherlock stopped dead, eyes going wide in realization and then turned to John to plant a great, soppy kiss on lips.
"I want to flip you over and fill you up right now but I can smell that your heat is close and I don’t want to spoil you. You do, after all, still need to be punished for letting Lestrade have you." John dropped his head against Sherlock’s left thigh and rubbed his face against it.
"It’s dead?"
"Hush." The dipped back down to start nipping, licking and sucking on John’s neck causing the Omega to bite his lip so as not to make any more embarrassing noises. When Sherlock nipped at a particularly sensitive bit of skin near John’s ear, the smaller man gave up all resistance and lifted his free hand up to scratch through Sherlock’s hair, making the big Alpha growl low in appreciation. It was such an odd thing to experience for John because of how unexpected Sherlock’s affection was, one day Sherlock was fighting against everything Alpha/Omega and today he’s kissing John in front of people and necking in the car park.
hated about Omega heat cycles, it was the bloody scenting thing!
"In your own time." John said kindly and Sherlock raised an eyebrow and chipped in.
Or maybe even seeing his heavily pregnant mate being knocked to the ground as he fell, thankfully in a way that no damage would come to their child, but no. Nor was it when John had clambered over to his body to check for a pulse and seeing the broken look in his eyes when he realized there was none. No, none of that was the hardest part, don’t misunderstand, all of the above were hard, so
.’ and then giggled a bit more.
Sherlock could have slapped himself, he was one step away from letting out a girly sigh, clasping his hands to the side of his face and batting his eyelashes, just because he had finally admitted to himself that he wanted John and was prepared to do something about it did not mean he was going to turn into a sentimental fool or worse;
"Oh God! What just happened? THAT BASTARD!" He snarled and then slid down to the floor to palm himself as quickly as possible, it was nice to take time out and have a little fun with his new Alpha but he really needed to get back to being serious about this case and maybe kick Sherlock’s arse for making his situation worse.
place." Sherlock tried not to sound so agitated at the thought of being separated from John for what was most likely going to be several but John could see right through him and even though he gave Sherlock a concerned look, his eyes brightened immediately.
it?" Sherlock asked as he approached the cage John was hiding in and paused when he saw John move forward to peek out the crack, he heard John start to deny it but then he trailed off.
"What did you see?" John frowned and pressed himself as tightly to Sherlock as humanly possible.
"So they didn’t have it put down then; the dog?" Sherlock asked John taking a drink of his coffee; John did an internal eye roll, back to the case then, still the reprieve was nice while it lasted.
"Hmm. Red eyes, coal-black fur, enormous: Dog? Wolf?" He asked seriously and Sherlock snorted.
." Sherlock was looking around for the cages but it was a little different down here than looking at an overview monitor.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
"Thank you from both of us then,
"Is that it? Nothing else? Footprints. That's all?" Henry looked distressed and tried to appeal.
Sherlock was obviously very displeased with the situation and because of his rising boredom and dwindling patience, his inner Alpha was becoming very agitated which of course lead to more bullet holes in the wall and a few extra nasty surprises hidden around the kitchen for poor, unsuspecting, jam loving flat mates to come across much to their horror and displeasure.
"John? John?" He called when there was no sound for a second.
one that had soothed John’s discomfort.
"The first round during a heat is always some form of violent, the rest will be a lot less violent and more desperate. Honestly Sherlock! I wouldn’t survive four days of
" Sherlock’s eyebrows shot up.
"No, no, shush, don’t be sorry. Like I said John, I’ll protect you; you’re mine." and Sherlock tipped John’s head back and pressed his lips desperately against the shocked doctors, it was lovely, John’s lips were soft and warm and Oh! He never wanted to pull away from this, except that John was pulling away from
"I just did. Don’t you want it?" He gave John a pleading look.
’ leaving John sweaty and stinking of sex in the back of the 4x4. Wonderful, now things were going to get awkward again and this time John didn’t know how they could fix it.
." When the detective didn't move away, John looked up and his eyes nearly popped out of his head. Sherlock was covered head to toe in blood, after a subtle sniff to make sure that none of the blood was Sherlock’s own he asked the only question that seemed to come to mind at that point.
." Sherlock tried to drawl but it came out broken and breathy.
"What?"

“It’s alright. I didn’t mean to scare you baby. Hush now, daddy’s sorry.” He whispered against the side of her head and slowly but surely she started to calm down. Sherlock kept on rocking his body back and forth slowly until he was sure she was fine before he decided he should probably leave now and let John and the baby get some sleep.
, unfortunately for John’s sanity, always began with a pregnancy test, regardless of the fact they knew he was pregnant or not. Sherlock had told John to just see to his own care since he was, in fact, a Doctor himself and John remembered spending hours trying to explain to his lover that treating and prescribing for himself would be
"Drugged?" John asked and screwed up his face.
"Cigarettes? What've you done with them? Where are they?" He asked impatiently as he continued to rummage around the fire place.

"I saw it too." Sherlock said trembling, okay now he was frightening John, Sherlock Holmes never trembled.
"Be with you in a minute!" Was called back, bringing John back from his musing’s. Greg was looking decidedly uncomfortable now after Sherlock’s little PDA, he looked as if he wanted to say something but wasn’t sure how.
"It was just a joke, y’know?" Oddly enough the DI failed to see the funny side and stood up looking down at the pair angrily.
"It's my heat Sherlock!" Sherlock's eyes went wide in shock at John’s exclamation and dove over the bed so it was firmly between him and the Doctor, John would’ve laughed if it wasn't so insulting.
"No, no don’t apologize. I’ve went a bit mad today, I know you don’t like the Doctors or shopping let alone this kind of shopping. We can just go home now, besides it’s probably too early to buy anything like this and I need to get dinner on anyway." John smiled at him but it was more reserved and less bright than the other smiles Sherlock had gotten used to over the last six weeks and he felt so very guilty for taking such a simple pleasure away from his little love, John shouldn’t have to be so apologetic about this, this was exactly the sort of thing normal couples did, in fact Sherlock could see many couples in this shop right now cooing over the miniature clothes, toys, cribs and all the other baby things. It was just instinct for expecting Omegas to start providing for their child before birth, it was called
, John. There will be a human being in the world with all my genius and your unyielding heart, a human being that will be a blend of the best of us both and that is more precious to me than any case, experiment or drug could ever be. Understand?"
So much for his changing luck theory
John was deep in thought as he climbed the stairs back up into the flat, ever since he had moved in to 221B, Sherlock had told him he didn't want to know anything about his '
“Take good care of your papa for me. Daddy will come back when he’s sure you’re safe. I promise.” Wiping the tears from his eyes Sherlock straightened and took one last look at his daughter before turning to make his way out of the room. He was stopped by a hand griping his coat sleeve and all the blood drained from his face.
John’s eyes popped open and he flipped over to his hands and knees again, face pressed against the seat fabric.
"Oh.My.God! Sherlock!?
Sherlock immediately moved towards the bed to lay John down, he thought he’d have another fight on his hands with detaching the needy Omega but John’s heat heightened senses drew him to his and Sherlock’s mixed scent still clinging to the bed sheets from that morning and he rolled over away from Sherlock to rub his face into the sheets. Sherlock didn’t know whether to be relived or disappointed about it.

stood and started prowling towards them but Sherlock bared his teeth in a violent, inhuman snarl to warn them off; the other Alphas simply snarled back. Billy and Gary who were stood behind the bar both shot around to help the two men; Gary marched forward and stood between Sherlock and the other Alphas growling lowly as if daring them to challenge his Alpha status in his own home whilst Billy made use of the distraction and steered Sherlock through the back way to the stairs and opened their room door when they got there.
saw or what
Hi folks, been a while right ^^' yeah sorry about that but stuffs been going on and times been an issue but look I'm back and stuff :D
Sherlock? An Alpha who would sink his teeth into John’s soft neck and bond with him? An Alpha who would take John away from him...
"Where are you?" He really didn’t want to ask since he knew when John was anyway but he had to if he wanted to keep this a secret form John.
"I’m. Sorry." He gritted out between clenched teeth and John smiled, he’d heard him the first time, he was just enjoying the rarity of Sherlock apologising to him.
"You said a quickie but you stopped us finishing the first time." Sherlock lifted his head to grin at John and chuckled when the man snorted at his pleased expression. They sat there gathering their bearings for a moment before shifting around to make themselves presentable again, John pulled his jacket over the cum stain on his his jumped and smoothed out his hair, Sherlock just wrapped his sheet back around his person and shuffled up close to John who was looking around again.
"John, what is it? Are you alright?" John jumped a foot in the air when Sherlock’s concerned tone came from right behind him; he spun around with both the bag and his almost untouched packet of birth control hiding behind his back.
." John was asleep by the time Sherlock had whispered the last two words against his cheek. He knew that both he and John weren’t quite ready for those special three words yet but John was still
“No, it’s just a dream John, close your eyes.” Sherlock whispered and sat down on the edge of the bed beside John, wishing he’d been more careful.
"But it wasn’t
Speaking of those things, Sherlock was startled when he noticed John sitting in the local cemetery all by himself, it was only 8:15am and John should still be asleep right now or at least having breakfast. Sherlock stared at John for a bit and suddenly all the words he had planned to say to the man left him in a rush, all the words he’s thought about suddenly became unworthy and Sherlock had no idea what to say but he knew he couldn’t just leave, he had to do something and he had to do it now or he may lose any chance of ever making John his. Sherlock swallowed down the dryness in his throat, opening the squeaky gate and proceeding up the path to where John was sat flipping through his notebook.
"How long will you boys be staying?" Gary prodded.
’ John’s mind supplied, this is what an Alpha did to an Omega to mark his territory; this is what an Alpha did when he had chosen a mate. John’s panic was rising, he had to get Sherlock off him
Sherlock swallowed nervously and made his way carefully around to where his daughter lay sleeping and stopped breathing at the sight that awaited him, his daughter was dressed in a white onesie with a matching hat and mittens but there was also a little blue scarf wrapped gently around her neck. Tears ran down Sherlock’s cheeks at the sight and he leaned down to pick up his daughter to have a closer look at her. She was so tiny, barely the length of his forearm and light as a feather, she had healthy, soft pink skin that Sherlock could already see was going to go pale like his own and he caught a glimpse of soft, wavy dark hair sticking out of the cap on her head. He could clearly see that it was his own features that dominated her facial structure but she also had John’s lips, chin and ears, she was beautiful.
"No reason not to." Sherlock answered and looked John up and down from the corner of his eye to make sure he was okay and hadn’t been handled. Lestrade seeing that his little diversionary tactic wasn’t working decided to bow out gracefully and took a couple of steps back to show Sherlock he was leaving.
"Hmm. Yes we need to have a little chat about that." John drawled, a little amused at the Alpha's display of affection and Sherlock stopped moving to look over his shoulder.
"Don’t be silly, as long as you pay for the extra night’s I’ll be a happy man. My brother’ll fix up the room for free anyway and as I said this isn’t the first time this has happened. Now can I get you boys some breakfast?" He said clapping his hands together and rubbing them, grinning the whole time. John was going to protest not paying for the damages but Sherlock sensing his mate was going to make them poor for a while jumped in.
John smiled when he caught sight of ‘The Cross Keys’, he wanted to find out of Sherlock had deduced anything yet from their little outing, usually the man would’ve started rattling off ideas as soon as he had seen what he had to see but the Alpha had been in a bit of an odd mood when John caught up to him and Henry and he just took off in the direction of the pub. John just assumed he was thinking hard and needed some peace.
"If you have what you say you have, I’ll make you rich. If you don’t I’ll make you into
He could’ve leaped for joy as they left ASDA stocked up with enough Shopping to last a month and he was just about to flag down a cab so he could finally,
He soon got his answer when his eyes focused on the destruction that littered the room and realization dawned when a memory from the past few days flashed brightly in his mind.
"You don’t punish yourself and let me take care of this." Sherlock nodded fiercely making John smile and then he helped the doctor open his trousers to pull his cock out and my
"It’s just, we don’t get inspected here, sir, it just doesn't happen." and Sherlock didn’t know what to say to that, lucky for him, John did.
"Okay."
John for his part was blown away, there was no way Sherlock was saying what he thought Sherlock was saying, all the same though, he slowly made his way back over to Sherlock and tilted his head to the side, contemplating for a brief second.
The story was that just as they had pulled into a familiar street about twenty minutes form 221B Sherlock had instructed Lestrade, who had made good on his word of a lift in spite of the shock the poor man had back at Grimpen, to take them to a little registry office a few streets away from 221B, of course John hadn’t known about this since he was asleep and curled up against Sherlock’s side in the back of the DI’s car but apparently Sherlock had contacted Mycroft on the drive back up to inform him about his bonding with John, though he omitted the part about John being pregnant, and asked if his brother could arrange a small ceremony for them to make it
What if he was getting torn apart right this moment by large fangs?
"What?" He squeaked, Sherlock blushed and looked out the window.
"I wish we could stay here and rest right now but I think Greg will get suspicious if we don’t make an appearance soon." Sherlock whined but nodded in agreement, he nudged John to get off him and stood to right himself. It took Sherlock five minutes but he managed to disguise the fact he’d just had a blowjob, wouldn’t do for Lestrade to start asking questions and pestering John. Speaking of which, the Omega was adjusting himself uncomfortably by the door as he waited for Sherlock.
Ah! who was he kidding, of course he could.
"Gary." The man replied and smiled before turning to the little cubbies of keys behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
?" Mycroft drawled and Sherlock grinned.
"Okay, okay." Sherlock soothed and moved so he could unbuckle John’s belt and remove his jeans, by the time Billy had returned from the bathroom there was a pile of clothes on the floor by the bed and John was down to his white rimmed, red boxer briefs. The little ginger chef just nodded at Sherlock and gave him a thumbs up before making his way out of the room and back to his own mate. Once Sherlock was sure he was gone he removed the last item of John’s clothing and jumped up to lock the door, he gulped when he turned back to see a completely nude John undulating against the bed Sheets, half hard but not lubricating yet, Sherlock’s eyes shifted from the gorgeous sight to the bathroom and then back to John before he nodded and started removing his own clothes and dumping them to join John’s in the floor pile.
"Really? Are you sure? What about the..?" John made a gesture between them.
Omega.
who had just finished his phone call and was sitting at one of the bench's.
was it, he couldn’t take anymore, he pulled back from John’s hold on his body, making the doctor whimper at the loss but Sherlock shushed him and pecked his lips.
"Yes, yes, I’m fine, I just... can I use your bathroom?" Henry blinked at him and nodded.
"Hurry up, John! We’ve got somewhere to be!" Sherlock growled before going back to his desperate task, John sighed resigned and walked quickly inside. After all he’d invaded Afghanistan and survived, he could survive this too,
"John, I know you two are mated now but is there any chance you could
"Humph! So you can get something for my discomfort but I get threatened with homicide for offering to get you pain killers?"
"God, I sound like an idiot." Sherlock growled at himself and then stood up to finish his packing so he could get outside to hail a cab.
Sherlock really was trying not to be so snippy with John because he knew he was upsetting and stressing out his beautiful little Omega but things like putting others needs first didn’t come naturally to Sherlock so once again the Alpha was struck by his ‘
"No, I’m being punished remember." Sherlock smirked and tugged John into him by his belt making John giggle and wrap his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
"Virgin? You mean that was your first time? Oh God, Sherlock If I’d known I woul-" Sherlock silenced his panicked rant with a kiss.
"Okay. I’ll take your punishment without protest but only under
"You being all mysterious with your cheekbones and turning your coat collar up so you look cool." John grumbled as he jumped into the car, Sherlock’s mouth moved with no sound for a moment completely speechless.
There was no reply which either meant Sherlock was ignoring him or was too zoned into his case that he didn't notice the reply. It was only 7:45AM and John could’ve cried, he was so used to waking up after ten these days that quarter to eight seemed more like three in the morning, still if Sherlock was out on a case then that gave John plenty of time to shower and have breakfast in peace for a change without Sherlock having an Alpha temper tantrum ‘til John paid attention to his moaning, he only hoped the jam wasn't poisoned... again.
You would think it was the moment he had let himself fall over the roof edge of Bart’s that was the hardest to bear.
John smirked as he thought about all the naughty things he and Sherlock had been up to since their wedding night and his fingers toyed with the platinum band that adorned his finger, it was decidedly more feminine than the slightly larger ring on Sherlock’s finger but John didn’t really care because the sight of that ring on Sherlock’s finger was both unbelievably reassuring and a
"We couldn’t control the bloody thing! It was vicious! And then, a month ago, Billy took him to the vet and, er ... you know." The man softened his voice near the end when he caught sight of his Omega’s distressed look but John needed clarification.
"No, no, no, your exact words, repeat you exact words form a moment ago, exactly as you said them." Sherlock said impatiently.
"Sorry, you shouldn't've had see that." He croaked and Sherlock frowned and sat up on his knees beside John.
Sherlock let the memory fade reluctantly and trailed his eyes over the broken room. In addition to the damage near the window area, there was also the chest of drawers which had been tipped over and was cracked along the back and the mirror that had sat on the vanity table was smashed to pieces
"Just a quickie, c’mon John. You can’t actually tell me you don’t find the thought of fucking me hard in Buckingham, completely
. What are you seeing?" Sherlock insisted and quietly pushed his way into the lab.
"John Watson, Would you do me the honour of letting me share your heat and bond with you, love?" The endearment came as a bit of shock to them both but Sherlock got his answer when John closed the gap between him, wrapping his arms around the Alpha’s neck and kissing him deeply and as he slid his own arms around John’s waist to pulling him on his tiptoes to press as close as possible, Sherlock wondered why he had ever protested something that felt this good in first place.
