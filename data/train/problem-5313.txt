"Cas?" The voice calls again, and now he can tell for sure, it's Jack.
Not that he wants to be -just- friends again, but it's better than nothing.
“Just answer the question Sammy”
He couldn't be more wrong.
," and, "
"We're kinda friends now," and he adds after Castiel raises an eyebrow in confusion, "I helped it go back to sleep and it gave you back to me."
"Dinner is ready" Eileen announces, bringing the burgers and fries Cas and her just cooked to the table.
So much angst :(
"Wait," Dean speaks, his confusion suddenly replaced by a borderline-fearful emotion, "you're leaving?"
It feels like deja vu of some sorts, though Castiel can’t remember why, which is not really a surprise to him. He can’t remember much nowadays. He blames the torture, or maybe his mind is slowly giving up, erasing all the good things he has been through, stopping him from composing a single positive thought or thinking this could get better.
"I'm better," he says instead, "though it still hurts."
Sam is in front of him now, he says something but Dean can only make up the words, "
“What about a t-shirt?” He asks, clearing his throat and picking up a black t-shirt from the pile of clothes on Castiel’s bed “it’s simple, versatile and stylish” he throws it and Cas grabs it “put this on, I’ll grab a jacket for you” Dean gives him one last -very weird- look before walking past him “meet me in the library! “ he shouts from the hallway.
are worried about you."
Cas glances at him, and for a long moment they just stay like that, staring at each other, barely moving. It reminds Dean of the old times, when they would just stare, like they could read each other’s mind. And maybe they can.
It's like Jack somehow reset his mind, for a moment he can't remember anything, not even his own name, and then
“Wait Dean”
Cas seems to sense his rage because he slides his hand down Dean's arm until it reaches his own. Dean doesn't usually hold hands, it's too personal, but it feels good with Cas, natural even, like it's something they've been doing their whole lives.
Cas collapses on the floor once the wound is closed, Sam is calling for him though he's too dizzy to understand.
"Hello," he waves
he begs
His name is Reece and in my head he looks like Dev Patel (I blame Modern Love for that) but feel free to imagine him however you like :)
Cas is desperate to ask why, why he's avoiding him, why he's annoyed, why they can't just go back to normal, but he can't bring himself to do it, so he waits instead, waits for Dean to tell him what's wrong and then, hopefully, Castiel can't fix it and they can be friends again.
This one is no different, they find the "Vamp-mimes,” as Dean had playfully nicknamed them, rather quickly, and everything was peachy until they got to the barn.
Dean has never felt so much pain in his entire life, not even when Chuck, God himself, was beating him up. Every cell, every atom of his body hurts, it hurts to move it hurts to breathe, even keeping himself awake hurts.
Castiel hesites for a moment, scanning the room with his blue eyes, probably searching for Dean in the crowd, but he can't seem to find him, he grabs his phone and types something and Dean feels his own cellphone buzz when he receives the message.
As soon as he leaves the bar - bumping into two girls on his way out- he picks up his phone and dials Sam’s number.
“Stop it you’re not helping!” Dean cuts him off “I don’t even know why I called you in the first place”
, it says.
“I’m Reece” he sticks his hand out
"I was telling Cas about that new bar downtown" he goes on "maybe you two should go there sometime"
"Did you like it, Dean?" Castiel asks and Dean nearly swallows his own tongue.
Running a hand through his hair, Dean turns around and goes back to the bar. He doesn’t get in though, frozen in place when his eyes find Cas.
"Cas, what's taking you so long?" Dean calls, knocking on his door.
Today is no different, he's having breakfast with Sam and Eileen, eating pancakes while secretly giving Miracle some bacon and watching Sam look at Eileen with the biggest heart eyes he has ever seen now and then.
“Jack," he cuts his son mid sentence and the boy frowns
In the back of his head, a voice tells him not to go with Jack, it says he's in hell, this is just another way of torturing him, he can never escape, but then he thinks of Dean, of his family and the life he had, he misses it - oh how he misses it- and if there's even a small chance that he can have that back, he's taking it.
Dean should cancel the whole thing, he knows he should, but what’s he going to say?
Castiel may not be a professional on human interactions, but that was definitely weird.
The man next to him shifts on the chair, waking up and yawning quietly
"I-" Dean starts, scanning his mind for an excuse not to go, but he doesn't have any. He stopped hunting after Cas became human - wanting to be there for him if he needed- so nowadays his life comes down to visits to the grocery store, training and occasional nights out with Sam.
"What? Why?"
“No, no, it’s okay” Dean grabs his arm, pulling him back “just a misunderstanding” he forces out a laugh and Reece does the same “I gotta make a call, I’ll be right back”
It’s dark when Dean wakes up.
Cas wants to go out. With him. He wants to go on a date - even if he doesn't
"It's a story for another day," he slides his hand all the way up to Dean’s shoulder, examining it so carefully Dean can barely feel his touch, "how are you feeling?"
"I would very much like that" Castiel cuts him off and Dean's heart skips a beat.
know what that means- with Dean.
"Of course I am-" Jack cuts himself off, midsentense, and his whole posture changes, as if he has just seen, just realized something, "what's wrong with you?" He slightly tilts his head
looking at how his lips close around the mouth of the bottle or how he tilts his head back…
, and, of course, what does that ‘
As if that would work out.
He's not avoiding Cas, he's not. He's… giving him space. Yeah, that's what Dean's doing. He pushed Castiel away, and now he's giving Cas time to come back.
"Uh- it's great- the- the burgers are great" he stammers, cleaning his throat.
"Look, Sammy," he starts, "I know you care about me, but the fact that I enjoy hunting and don't smile like a fool every five seconds does not make me any less okay than you two are," he points at them, and then adds when he sees Sam is not nearly as satisfied with his answer than he hoped he would be, "I'm okay, I'll swear on the damn Bible if you want, I'm alright, peachy."
Castiel doesn't understand what he's doing wrong.
Sure, he could try, but, based on his former relationships, the chances of Dean having a healthy and durable relationship with Cas are almost negligible.
The first person he sees is Eileen, her clothes covered in blood, who stares at him in shock for a rather long moment before pointing.
But then there’s Cas. Reece is clearly into him, and if Dean leaves them alone right now the two of them are gonna have a lot of fun together and, who knows, maybe Castiel will even get his number.
He clenches his jaw and closes his eyes, he has to heal Dean, he has to save him.
“Castiel” Cas says, shaking the guys, Reece, hand and
"Yeah, but they're back now."
Could this be possible?
"Whatever" Dean waves his brother's accusations away.
“I,uh” he scratches the back of his neck awkwardly “you know what? I’m just gonna go back there and...” he trails off, already walking backwards towards where he came from
Dean is miserable, and it's not just sadness, it's not just grief. It's that feeling, that certainty, that it won't get better, it can't get better. He lost Cas, he lost his person, how is he supposed to move on from that? How are you supposed to keep going when a part of you is missing and you know you can't never replace it?
?!” Dean screams at his phone
, he tells himself, even though he doesn’t believe it.
Anyways, here we are, chapter five, and as I said today we'll be meeting Castiel's new love interest.
Castiel stops all of a sudden, he was definitely not expecting to hear that voice in a very long time, in fact, he is even a little bit scared of that voice at this moment, however, the moment he hears it he’s hit with a wave of joy and love and a feeling he hasn’t felt in a while and
And sure, he's very aware that he sabotaged himself by telling Cas to leave -
"You won't believe it," Dean starts. "You remember that case Dad worked on but couldn't finish? The one with the vamps with masks?"
. The happiest Dean has seen him since he became human.
"Cas? Cas is that you?" he asks, even though he already knows the answer
He’s laughing, probably at some joke Reece told him, but it’s not a normal laugh, the ‘
"What do you mean?"
He knows that's wrong, Castiel deserves to be happy and Dean wants that for him, but there's a part of him that wants Cas to be happy
You can't.
“It’s okay, I think I made a mistake here” Reece admits, apologetically “I didn’t realize you two were together”
Sometimes Dean hears him scream at night, now that he has to sleep, Castiel has been having nightmares and Dean is pretty sure they have something to do with The Empty and what happened while he was there. For all he knows, The Empty is like hell for angels and demons and, as someone who has spent some time in hell himself, Dean knows first hand the nightmares it can cause.
"I do, I just don't want to mess it up"
"I have the next three days off of training."
"All you alright Dean?"
Cas was only partially awake "..- Dean it hurts,
gay people trying to debunk bisexuality and push the narrative that you had to chose one or the other.
"Well..I know our history isn't great but we've both grown up and I like this you- not that I didn't like you then just-..I enjoy being around you."
Dean shook his head calmly and took another sip of his beer, "Just an observation."
"Oh then-as much as I..
"It doesn't matter what do you want?"
"Thank you."
Sam gulped, ducking his head but not before sharing an uncomfortable side eyed look with Dean, "We broke up Mom."
"Reservation?"
He moved his hands up and pushed up on Cas' belly right where his cock was hitting knowing it'd make himself feel much larger inside of Cas
He didn't get to see Cas' smile as the angel's grip tightened, the rest of the drive was spent in a comfortable silence until they arrived at their destination
Castiel gave permission for Dean to remove his boxers and Dean did, taking his time and not just yanking them off impatiently, Castiel immediately felt exposed, and it didn't help that Dean was staring at him like a certain cartoon character stared at a pie cooling on a window scill.
Cas blushed "Thank you" Dean kissed him on the cheek "We should get going" Sam had apparently made plans for them at some fancy restaurant
"I did not have high hopes for that movie but it was actually pretty awesome."
Castiel noticed how tense Dean looked but didn't say anything not knowing if it was his place. Dean on the other hand was trying to keep cool as not to ruin the night for everyone. He could make it through his parents' comments.
"My brother just got here, him and Sammy are outside talking." He jerked his head towards the door as he pulled some ice from the freezer, "He's early." Dean commented, "Quick question- anything I should know so I don't embarrass myself?"
smart, funny, caring
"I don't really understand what happened between the two of you but if you feel there's something there just..go for it, who knows it might turn out alright."
Yeah that one threw Gabriel for a loop but when he brought it up with Sam the next day Sam just gave a lazy excuse,
Dean screamed at himself not to cry at Sam's unwavering love, "Yeah love you too Sammy- just graduate fast so I can see you again"
"That was interesting" Cas said after the ride as Dean way overpaid the driver and gave him a wave as he drove away "I've never been in a cab before" Cas admitted, he'd grown up with a personal driver, never once needing a taxi, the experience both scared and excited Castiel so much that Dean noticed and took his hand during the ride, warming Castiel's heart.
"I'll be quiet I promise, and it's not like we haven't snuck out before." It was true when you had parents like Castiel's who had to approve your friend list and  Dean didn't make the cut- not after he started causing fights and skipping school, so they started to get creative at around age thirteen.
Stay tuned, next chapter Dean and Cas will be going on their first hunt by themselves and A LOT of crazy stuff is going to happen.
"What?" Sam asks
Sorry for the late update, I had some stuff going on but I’m back now :)
"Jack, you know I can't leave."
"I'm too weak to fully heal you," Cas tells him, "I haven't recovered from The Empty yet," he goes on, "I was only able to close the wound, but I'm afraid there might be more, an infection perhaps," then adds, "but Sam said he can handle that."
It looks amazing, and Dean's stomach roars at the smell.
"I don't know what you're talking about" Dean shrugs, giving them one last glance before facing Sam.
He knows he should, they sacrificed so much for this life, but, right now, he feels worse than before, worse than when Chuck was controlling everything and making them go through hell every day.
So Dean drinks, he drinks until he forgets everything, until he can't even remember his name, until he passed out because apparently that's the only way he can fall asleep, and he throws himself into his job, he goes on hunts non stop, even when he's so tired can barely stand, because he needs a distraction, he can't let his mind wonder off, because everytime it does he thinks about Cas, and all the things he wanted to say to him, and Dean knows he can't take that much pain, he just can't.
“We didn’t order that”
"Holy shit!" He exclaims, and both Sam and Eileen raise their heads, almost simultaneously, to look at him.
One name.
and he slightly turns his head around only to see that he’s about to hit a huge and really rusty rebar.
He types a quick excuse why he has to leave in a hurry and tell Castiel to enjoy the rest of the night.
Cas looks really happy when he's with her and that makes Dean incredibly jealous.
," and his mind is halfway through processing what that means when Sam abruptly pulls him away from the rebar, he hears himself scream, a terrified shout of despair, and his little brother begins to carry him back to the impala.
"Jealous green does not look good on you Dean" Sam points out one day at dinner, when Dean is not so discreetly watching Cas and Eileen.
Sam keeps telling that if he keeps going like this, it's most likely for him to die of cirrhosis or cancer than on a hunt, but honestly, Dean doesn't really care.
He always thought he would face death fearlessly, that he wouldn’t cry or panic, that he would accept it.
No, this was a bad idea.
” It’s Sam’s time to scream “someone is flirting with Cas?” There’s a muffled sound and Dean’s pretty sure Sam’s telling Eileen all about this fiasco
He had come back before, more than once, maybe Jack brought him back?
“I’ll be right back”
Dean feels the need to hug him - like he does every time Cas seems hurt- he wants to so badly, but a voice in the back of his head tells him moving that much is not a good idea so he settles to just squeeze Cas' hand, which earns him a soft smile from Castiel.
"Dude, you've been watching them like a hawk all week" Sam says quietly so only Dean can listen "I don't get why you don't just go there and talk to them"
Yeah, tonight is gonna be peachy.
Not that he's insecure, he can heal Dean.
But Dean is okay for now, and that’s all that matters.
“I don’t know Dean” Sam says “you two just have this chemistry I don't know how to explain… wait, why are you even asking me that?”
Cas is a train wreck, he barely leaves his room and is apparently having the identity crisis of the century. Dean wants more than anything to help him, he hates seeing Castiel like that, all beaten down and broken, but the truth is he has no idea what to do, how to fix it, make Cas feel better.
He gives Castiel one last look, he's closer to Reece now, and Dean swears he can see the other man's hand over Cas'.
Castiel feels his mind drifting away, he should stop, but the skin is almost closing he just needs to keep going a little bit longer…
Dean fidgets with the need to ask more questions, he wants to know everything, how Cas got out of The Empty, why he’s in the bunker -
“I’ll explain later," Castiel cuts him off, "what happened?”
"You're avoiding each other" Sam corrects
Dean wishes he could say something, tell Sam it's okay, that they're going to be alright, but he's too weak, he can't barely keep his eyes open let alone talk.
Dean can tell he's hiding something, and he tries to figure it out - unsuccessfully- as he watches Cas stand up and walk towards the door.
Could Cas be alive?
"Dean, are you listening?" Sam's voice snaps him back to reality
- Eileen seems to be talking about taking him to a hospital but their voices are so far away… it's like Dean it's drifting off, like his mind, his soul, is leaving his body.
It’s all that matters.
He really hopes the dim lights can hide the red on his cheeks.
"What about..." Dean trails off, should he really bring that up? Is he ready to talk about it? The love confession, Cas' sacrifice… he hasn't even been able to process all that, to say it all loud, let alone talk about it.
He feels a hand on his shoulder, turning him around, and there he is, Jack, his son, smiling so brightly he could easily light up all of the empty's darkness.
"Great," Sam says and then, just because he loves to piss off his older brother, adds "it's a
"You can now," he tells him, "The Shadow is letting you go."
And then it all went to shit.
It is then that Dean hears Eileen shout, "
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean spots a machete near them and, silently picking it up, Eileen mouths
Sam and Eileen exchange a concerned look.
I hope y'all survived Misha's cameos this week and are okay, sorry for the delay (again) I have a lot of work rn so I can't write as often as I did before.
"Just like that?" Castiel asks, suspicious
“Wait
waving at
"Goodnight Dean," Castiel says, stealing one more look before closing the door.
Dean thinks his liver might hate him. Actually, scratch that, he knows his liver hates him.
Castiel meets him at the library, just as Dean told him to and they drive together to the bar, Cas, surprisingly, rides in the back, which leaves Dean half relieved, half insulted, but he decides to take it on the bright side.
Something is wrong with him, something is
"What did you do to me?" Castiel asks baffled
Something comes to mind, the first time he came to The Empty , when Jack’s voice woke him up, though he can't quite understand how that could be part of one of his regrets.
“Uh, I think?”
"So?"
It’s weird, having Eileen with them every hunt, Sam no longer rides shotgun - he sits in the back with her like the cute couple they are, and they have to improvise with the whole FBI thing -one of them, usually Sam, stays behind in the motel room researching while Dean and Eileen pretend to be officers, but Dean can’t complain, specially because hunting has become 10 times easier and even faster with her help and, until today, none of them has gotten hurt, just some scratches and bruises that fade away quickly.
"I'm glad you liked it" Cas says, taking a sip of his beer - Dean is
Dean stares at the bright screen for a moment and then back at Cas.
“Dean-“ Castiel starts but he cuts him off
He searches in the deeps of his mind for who that man could be, the only ones who used to be in the bunker are Sam, Jack and Cas. However Sam is already off the list and Jack is probably too busy being God, which leaves us with Cas.
"Dean," he begins, "there's nothing left for me to do, I was only here to help you, which I did, so now it's time for me to go."
“I need you to take me to the bunker," Castiel commands him. "Now.”
"Just like that."
"How?"
They remain in silence for a while, Cas still by the door, like he’s waiting for Dean to say something, or hoping he would.
moans.
kind of laugh, it’s that type of laugh that makes you lose your breath, that puts tears in your eyes and gives you a boost of serotonin.
Using all the strength he has left, Dean moves to his left and nearly screams as the rebar goes straight through his shoulder.
That would make Cas happy, and Dean wants him to be happy.
, he misses it.
"So we have to go after them, finish what Dad started!"
Reece whispers something to Castiel's ear and they both chuckle, he then elbows Cas and jerks his head towards the bar's other exit.
"I thought you were dead!"
, says a little voice in the back of his head.
He has always been a fan of alcohol, but lately he has been borderline alcoholic to say the least.
Dean finally feels the tension inside of him snap and it is with eyes that are blinded by the emotion he feels that he turns around abruptly, brushing away the hand that is still awkwardly hovering over his shoulder. Finally, the dam breaking and the levee overflowing, he lets the emotion he’s been carrying for literal centuries loose.
A few moments passed before Cas got up. Dean looked up at him with his broken bloodshot eyes, following him as he went around the table to sit beside Dean. Cautiously, slowly, Cas put his hand on Dean’s back, too unsure to do anything else but knowing he had to do something.
Still, even as his mouth opens and his throat and vocal cords move, lips forming a word that is so deeply ingrained in his soul that he could never hope to forget it, doubt flashes through him. He’s flying too high right now and he’s terrified of the fall. But he can’t help it, and before he can stop it, the word is out, hanging in the charged, pregnant air, floating like a butterfly on the breeze.
“Well, Dean. I don’t know. I never... I never expected this. I never expected you. I never have. For all the millennia I’ve lived, for all the eons I’ve encountered, you have always managed to surprise me, endlessly. And I have no idea what is going to happen next. So... I guess this all depends on you, Dean. On what you want. So... tell me, Dean. What do you want? What do you, truly, want?”
~XoxoxoxoxoxoX~
It’s like the entire world turns grey. The endless, eternal sunlight darkens and the world that was once so happy and peaceful and bright is not so bright anymore. He shudders as a cold wind billows around him, the glassy lake rippling for the first time. He can feel the energy growing behind him, impossibly hot and cold and powerful, and he knows that this is Cas.
“So. This is, uh. Well. Something. I mean... Fuck. What... what the hell happens now?”
Dean smiles slowly at the request, nodding as he looks back at Baby, her glory splendid.
And as they drive back on the endless road, miles and miles of nothing ahead of them, with only a destination in heart, no words are exchanged.
“That- that’s why... that’s why I stayed away, Dean,” Cas rasps, his voice more broken and wretched than he’s ever heard it before. It makes him ache. “That’s why... I... I’m so sorry. Y-you were... you were supposed to move on, Dean. To forget about me. To just... you were supposed to move on, Dean. Why didn’t you- Dean. Why didn’t you move on? Why... Dean, why-”
“H-Heya, Cas,” he somehow manages to get out, throat so tight he knows that if he were alive, he’d soon not be anymore. He feels more than hears the laughter, the energy pulsating around him, engulfing him completely. He doesn’t feel the rain, doesn’t hear the thunder, doesn’t notice anything at all, really. Only Cas.
And then he hears it.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean whispers, eyes closed, and nose buried in a bare neck that tastes like sunshine and honey. A hand trails up his back, caressing every bump and notch, and stops at the junction of his shoulder blades, more warmth radiating through him than he’s ever felt before.
“I don’t understand, Dean. Isn’t... I mean, heaven... what do you mean?”
It’s as he is reeling back, his hand aching in a way that it hasn’t since he was alive, that he remembers how good pain could feel, at times. He can’t say he truly misses the sensation, but there’s something heart-wrenchingly familiar about the bruising ache that radiates through his busted fist, the finally ruffled face before him causing a dark satisfaction to rush through him. God. It’s been ages since he’d last felt like this. Figures Cas would be the one to bring it out of him. Cas has always been the one who got under his skin the most.
The pause that Cas takes before speaking feels endless, infinite, everlasting, and yet all too short, all at once. He’s long since come to accept that everything with Cas will feel like that. Even back when he’d been alive.
“So… are you… okay?” Cas questioned hesitantly after a moment, not sure if Dean would want him to ask. But he felt that he should.
“So, I was wondering… Sammy’s going to be spending the next week here, and I wanted you two to meet. I told him about us, during our road trip.” Dean said, looking at Cas hesitantly. Cas felt his heart fill with elation, knowing that Dean had felt hesitant to tell his brother about them.
(He ignores the pain that the thought causes him and just clenches his fists tight. So much for pain not existing here.)
“Whatever, jerk. And I... I don’t know. Maybe... well. I’d like to see Bobby. Maybe we can start there?”
He knows that if he were human, if he had his mortal body, that his voice would be wrecked from the volume and force of the words he screams. Even still, his chest is heaving, and his eyes are blurry, and he can’t quite breathe, even though he knows he doesn’t need to breathe anymore. All the pain and rage and heartbreak he’s kept inside for millennia comes bursting out and he has no idea how to deal with it. After so long of pretending that everything was perfect, that he was happy and content like his family, that everything is fine and normal and good… he doesn’t know how to handle the rage that once was his most familiar companion.
He looks over at his brother, sees the furrow in his brow, the confused frown that makes him look so much like a puppy. And for a minute, he’s a teenager again, ruffling his little (back when he actually was little) brother’s hair, cracking a crude joke about some odd girl he’d spent the night with, Sam’s confused look quickly turning disgusted. It only lasts a second (or maybe a decade, who knows), but it feels good to remember it, for once. Not tinged with even a hint of sadness. It’s incredible.
The silence becomes deafening as the minutes pass, hours and days and weeks spanning this single second of time. He doesn’t know how long it’s been when he feels Cas stand, his lithe body flitting around the table as he takes cautious but measured steps closer to where Dean is standing. He doesn’t turn around. He can’t. If he does... he can feel his fists clench tighter, the pressure building within him like dynamite. He knows that if he turns around now, he’ll do something he knows he will regret. He’s just not quite sure which
The pained gasp he hears behind him makes him want to turn around, to close the distance, to run his fingers along stubbled cheeks, to comfort and soothe and console, like he has always wanted to do, but he can’t. He can’t, like he never has been able to. He stays rooted to his position and just listens as Cas breathes equally unneeded breaths, heaving like a man suffocating.
He hears Cas gasp, something caught between a sob and a laugh, and it’s all Dean can do to bury his head in a warm shoulder, feathers wrapping firmly around him, hiding his bare frame from view. Not that anyone is watching.
The angel who fell for him.
“I didn’t know. That he’d fallen off the wagon, that he was drinking again. I had thought… God, I don’t know what I thought. That he would get better. But the old man just had to prove me wrong, huh? I should’ve been there for him, but instead I abandoned him. It’d been months since I’d even spoken to him last, what kind of son does that, huh Cas?” Dean looked up, eyes filled with suppressed tears and anger and pain, breaking Cas just by looking. Just as he was about to speak, Dean continued.
“Hello, Dean. The usual?” Cas asked, trying his hardest to not stare at the man before him, finding it nearly impossible. It was just something about him, about the way he focused intently on the menu, even though he ordered the same thing every day. Or how he always smiled at Cas, so unlike many people who ordered. It always amazed him, how brightly this gruff looking man could smile.
And eventually, they will have to deal with being apart, even though they want nothing more than to be together forever, while Cas does his work for Heaven and for Jack and for the world. And eventually, Dean will wait patiently by a lake, skipping stones and listening to Zeppelin as he waits for the other half of his heart to return, time passing in its strange, beautiful way.
~XoxoxoxoxoxoX~
“Cas? Cas is alive? Wow, Dean, I... just. Wow. Have you seen him?”
Now, he will let himself love the angel that had, despite all the odds, claimed the entirety of the heart that he didn’t even know he still had, and he will accept the love that he never could have accepted when he was still alive.
With a casual twist of his hips, Dean saunters over to the table, keeping his gaze carefully ahead of him, even as his body longs to turn towards Cas and never turn away again. Best to not make a total fool of himself. Not yet at least. He feels more than hears Cas follow behind him, the ever-present energy that Cas gives off making his spine shiver not quite unpleasantly.
“When he drained God’s power, when he took Amara into himself and became all powerful, I felt him. It, uh. It’s hard to explain, since I couldn’t technically feel anything at the time, but I remember feeling such pride at him and how he’d grown. But I thought that would be it. My story was over. It had ended. That was the plan.”
Castiel sat in the booth in his brother’s coffee shop, hands cradling a warm cup of coffee. He had just gotten off work, the shop having closed for the night an hour beforehand. Even Gabriel had left, telling Cas to lock up when he left. But still he sat, thinking about everything and nothing, waiting. The clock had just passed 9 PM when he heard the telltale sound of a bell ringing, followed by footsteps coming closer to his booth. He let out a small smile as he looked up into amused green eyes.
), content and satiated and glowing. He feels Cas move against him, the warmth that fills him swelling impossibly larger, the legs tangled with his pressing tightly back as a rumbling hum radiates up and down his body so beautifully that he wants to cry again. He doesn’t and lets the hand that is lazily running through silky black strands tighten and pull that beautiful face closer.
. He pushes it down, though. Cas is talking again, and he doesn’t have time to get lost. Not now.
“I’m sure I’ll be able to take the time off.” Cas replied, grinning now. Dean glared at him without heat, before getting up.
However, the time for deep contemplation will come. Once he reaches the end of this road he’s driving on, once he gets to the place that he’s racing towards... then, and only then will he stop and try to compartmentalize a lifetime of pain and sorrow. But for now...
“Wow. That, uh. That’s a neat story there, Cas. And, uh. How long did that take? A month? A year? ‘Cause, uh. I think it’s been quite a bit longer than that, don’t you?”
“Yeah, that uh, that might be best. Come on, Cas. Let’s settle in. Something tells me this is gonna be one hell of a tale.”
“Not yet. Only Bobby. But like I’ve said. We’ve got time. We’ll see him again. I know it.”
~XoxoxoxoxoxoX~
“I’m glad, Dean. I was… worried, about you.” Cas confessed lowly, looking down slightly. He felt Dean shift in the booth, before feeling warm hands tilting his head up, forcing him to look into bright green eyes.
And he’s sure, once this drive is over, once he finally takes a minute to pause, the memories will return to the forefront of his mind. The memories of his pain and his loss and his fear. The memories of all he has lost and all he has failed. After all, if someone only ever felt happiness and joy, how could they ever truly appreciate it? So, he knows the feelings will return eventually, knows that nothing lasts forever, not truly.
Castiel doesn’t look any different from what he remembers, and yet he can instantly tell something has changed. It doesn’t hit him at first what exactly that is. His eyes rove over the timeless face he could never manage to forget, the pale pink lips that haunt his memories, the oceanic eyes that drown him every moment of every day. He takes so much time just staring at a face he’d long lost hope of ever seeing again that by the time he finally realizes what is different, he thinks decades have passed. Or maybe only seconds. Or maybe even lifetimes, like the lifetimes that have always passed whenever he stares into eyes so blue that he feels like he’s drowning.
“Yes, I... I suppose you deserve the truth. Where to begin...” Cas mutters, a soft frown on his face as he looks out across the still lake, the endless sunshine radiating off his skin. Man. He truly is glowing, isn’t he? He’s distracted from his thoughts when Cas sighs again, giving himself a private little nod. Guess he’s come to some sort of conclusion, then.
The pair are sitting side by side before the lake again, the eternal sunshine back, the water still as marble once more. There is no sound in the air, not even the tweeting of birds, and it feels so fake that Dean doesn’t even know what to do. What to think. Cas is so close beside him that if he wanted, he could reach out and touch him, but he doesn’t. He stays on his side of the lake and he wonders how many miles those inches between them truly are.
He took his place behind the register and waited for the rush of customers.
“Perhaps I should start at the beginning,” Cas continues, his words only slightly clipped with the annoyance the angel never could fully hide. Dean wants to press the matter, to rile the angel up like he always had loved to do in life, but he suppresses the sensation and looks around the lakeshore, spotting a picnic table he was positive hadn’t been there a moment earlier. He doesn’t question it, used to Heaven’s tricks by now, and just nods his head over to the newly minted table.
Only Cas.
- “what did you think?”
“Alright, bitch. Enough sap. Let’s get going, eh? We’ve got our unlives ahead of us, now. Where do you want to go first?”
The shaking intensifies and Dean doesn’t know how long they stand there pressed together, the brothers reunited at long last. For once, it doesn’t make him uncomfortable to show such affection. It seems his fear at showing emotions and affection had faded with his pain and rage. Finally.
His love.
Still, there’s always a niggling at the back of his mind that tells him to not get too comfy. To not get too used to it. That it’s not as perfect as it all seems and that the moment that he lets his guard down, it all will fall apart. He supposes a lifetime of pain and heartache can’t be erased just like that. He doubts, no matter how long he stays in this place, that the feeling will ever truly go away.
However, Cas knew that the past couple weeks would not have been easy for Dean, since it was the anniversary of his father’s death. He had wanted to be there for Dean during that time, but when Dean had told him of his plans to spend the time with his brother, alone, Cas understood.
Dean trails off as he looks out at Heaven, the vast space open before him filled with souls of the ones he loves most. It’s beautiful here, in a way that he could never hope to explain. So, he doesn’t even bother to try and just allows himself to exist in a way he never could while alive. He can feel Sam relax beside him, some mild confusion still there, but the tension rapidly fading and a soft smile rising on his now timeless face.
“What, Cas?” Dean rasps, cutting off the rambling words, heart clenching at the way Cas’s eyes are radiating sorrow and heartbreak and
Psyching himself up, Dean manages to look up at Cas with his trademarked cocksure grin, the look feeling only the tiniest bit strained, as he spreads out along his side of the table. He pushes down the wave of emotion that passes through him at the tiny smirk Cas gives at his display and instead nods, giving his dearest friend a significant look.
“I, uh… got you something.” Dean said a few minutes later, after they had finally pulled away from one another.
Cas hums, pressing his hand further to his shoulder blade, his other hand drifting down to his right hip.
And if anyone is confused as to why it took Cas so long to return to Dean, the way I see it, he was, well... afraid. I hope it made sense in context of the story, but I'm not quite sure I nailed that part of this story. Also, he decided to show up at that moment because Dean called it his "punishment," and Cas fully realized then just how upsetting it all was to Dean. Or something.
Despite the fact that he was the one to start this whole conversation, he starts when he hears that familiar rumble, no longer wretched and unrecognizable, but as warm and familiar as life. He craves it.
Time passes strangely again, minutes passing into centuries passing into milliseconds. Everything and nothing happens, and he doesn’t know what to do. That cursed and blessed energy behind him is frozen in space and he can feel it radiating behind him, threatening to consume him, but he doesn’t turn around. He can’t turn around. Because turning around means acknowledging that this is real. And he’s far too much of a coward to face this kind of rejection. He can face down monsters and demons and hell hounds and leviathans and angels and the devil and God himself, but he can’t face down his own emotions. He never could.
One day, an undetermined amount of time later, a young man arrives in their heaven and he watches as his baby brother cries as he holds his son, the nephew Dean never had the chance to meet in life. The nephew he’d never gotten to see grow up.
“I… I don’t know what to tell you, Dean.” Cas began in his deep, gravelly voice. “My… my father, uh, left. When I was younger. I barely even remember him, to be honest. So I’m not really one to judge what it means, to be a good son or not. I don’t know what your relationship with your father was like, but what I do know is that you are a good man, Dean Winchester. I know that you do everything you can for other people, and that you never take for yourself. I know that you try your hardest, even when you want to stop, just because it is what you feel you must do. I know that… that you make a room brighter just by walking into it. That anyone who meets you is blessed to spend even a moment in your presence. And I know that your father would be proud of you, that he’d never blame you. And if he would, then he doesn’t deserve to have a son as amazing as you.” Cas finished, not quite sure if what he said would help, but knowing that each word he spoke was the truth.
“I got a late start, forgive me Gabriel. I’m not even ten minutes late.”
“How’s Sam doing?” Cas inquired, as he handed the coffee and scone over. If there was one thing in Dean’s life that Cas knew the most about, it was Dean’s little brother, Sam. Usually Dean didn’t like talking much about his life, even though they’d known each other for just over a year. But Dean would talk about Sam like a proud father talking about their child, and from what Cas could tell, that was pretty much how it was.
The sight he sees is one that he can’t describe, and he won’t even fucking try. All he knows is that it’s bright, and beautiful, and blinding, and
If there was one thing Cas appreciated about himself, it was that whenever something truly bad happened, he didn’t go mindless with panic. Instead, he channeled his fear into something productive, letting it clear his mind instead of clouding it.
And his universe shatters.
It’s when his hand twitches at the last second, causing his stone to sink in the water with a silent splash, a spasm caused by the pain within his chest squeezing tight and refusing to let go, that he lets the facade drop. It’s only for a moment, one second (if seconds exist anymore), a breath of time that he doesn’t need or experience anymore. But it’s enough to make him gasp for unneeded breath, squeezing his eyes tight as a flash of vivid blue dances in his mind, liquid and shining as a smiling mouth says words that he’d not had any time to process or respond to before it was too late. Bright blue eyes that haunt him endlessly, ceaselessly, the one thing missing from paradise that spoils the whole set.
That had been three months ago, and even though they still had problems, they were happy. When they had told Gabriel, he had just rolled his eyes and stated that ‘it was about time’ before hugging Cas, telling him how happy he was for him.
What does he want, eh? Isn’t that the million-dollar question. He shakes his head and runs his hands through his hair. He laughs. He cries. He looks up and smiles and speaks.
“Cut the crap, Cas,” Dean interjects, his body standing without his brain telling it to. The wide-eyed look the angel gives him makes a shot of satisfaction rush through him, that age old anger and heartache finally rearing its ugly head. Such feelings shouldn’t exist here, he knows that. Figures he’d be the one to beat the odds. With a twisted scowl, Dean turns away from the table, scrambling off the bench and stalking over to the lakeside once more. He feels too restless to be cooped up on a too small bench with an endless ocean of space between him and the angel he once would have gladly died for.
The words cut him deeply and he can’t help the ragged breath he takes as he turns and marches further along the lakeshore, body shaking so badly he doesn’t know how he’s even able to stay upright. He stops a few meters away. Far enough to have space, but not too far that he can’t feel that blessed, cursed energy. A bitter laugh escapes his lips, and he doesn’t know what he’s even laughing at. The situation, maybe. After all. It’s so funny. Isn’t it? After centuries he finally gets to see his angel (
“Yes, Dean?” Cas whispers back, voice blissed out and reverent and so raw he curses his past self for never taking this when he was alive. For almost not taking it when he was dead. Now he knows that never having this? That would be the true Hell.
The words hang in the air with a charged energy, and suddenly he can’t take it. Can’t take this, can’t take the pain, can’t take the suffering he still feels even in this supposed paradise. It’s too much. With strength he thought he’d lost long ago, Dean rips himself away from Cas’s touch, mourning it instantly but knowing he can’t take it back. That’s the rub about broken things. You can’t ever fix them again. Not truly.
“I should go. Sammy’s expecting me to call him soon, to let him know that I’m okay.” Dean said, his eyes glazing over with sadness once more. Cas knew that he’d never truly get over his father’s death, but he could only hope that one day it would be easier for him to handle. And as he watched Dean smile softly at him one last time before leaving the shop, he hoped that maybe, just maybe, he’d be able to help him.
Eventually Dean clears his throat, blinking as he realizes he’s been staring for far longer than he likely should be. He looks away at last, though it’s a lot harder than it has any right to be. But that’s nothing new, now, is it?
The silence stretches between them, no words needed as they stare off the bridge, seconds passing into years passing into eons as they allow themselves to finally exist together in a way they never seemed to be able to when they’d been alive. Dean can feel the years melting off Sam as they stand together, the same tension that had taken Dean decades to shake finally starting to wane in his baby brother. Maybe if they stand there for another thousand years, that tension will finally be gone for good. For both of them.
“Glad to see you finally made it, Bro. Thought you’d gotten lost or something.” A too familiar voice said to his left. Cas turned and glared mildly at his brother.
“It isn’t. A memory, that is. This is, it’s... it’s real, Sammy. A heaven of our own. What a concept, huh?”
Dean grinned at this, a brief flash of teeth that warmed Cas’s heart, even though it was gone a second later.
“Ah, no. It, uh. It wasn’t, well. It didn’t, um. Didn’t take long. After. But... I...” Cas sighs, shaking his head and looking down at the hands he’s folded on the table, his fingers interlaced. “I had things to do. After. See, while Jack had brought me back partially due to our familial bond, there was another thing he needed, something he said he could trust only me to do. Jack, well. He didn’t want to be hands on with Earth or Heaven. Not like Chuck. He wants to be a better guardian, a silent but loving observer. Helping only when utterly necessary. But there are certain aspects of life that do need constant care to work. Heaven is one of them.
He feels the laughter vibrate against his lips, and it’s all he can do to chase the sound back to the source, pushing down at the lithe and powerful body beneath his, until he feels that age old heat fill his stomach and he wants to stake claim to the body beneath him again, and again, and again, over and over for the rest of eternity. That’s the best part of Heaven, he’s come to find. No refractory period. He’s almost completely forgotten his question when Cas pulls back, a teasing smile on his heavenly lips, his eyes shining brighter than any jewel known to man.
“Dean. D-Dean. Dean... Dean, look at me. Please, Dean, please. Look at me, D-Dean.
As he drives, he doesn’t let any thoughts enter his head. He doesn’t allow any feelings into his heart. For once, rage and anger aren’t dominating through him. Neither is sorrow and pain. For once, he feels nothing but the simple joy of riding in his car, his Home, with nothing to worry about anymore. No pressing issues he has to worry about, no Big Bad looming over his head, no Monster of the Week lurking around the next corner. All he has to worry about now is the road and the feel of his Baby beneath him, nothing more.
Silence blooms between them again as they stand along the lakeside, the air still and perfect like always. Dean misses the breeze. He’d never truly appreciated it while he’d had it. Funny, how life works. Or, well. Unlife.
The only sound that follows his declaration is the sound of rain and the distant thunder, rolling ever closer. He can feel the energy behind him vibrating, can see the glow behind him growing brighter and brighter and he knows. He knows what he’ll see if he turns around. But he can’t. He can’t. He won’t.
"Woah, this is highschool level break up stuff huh?" He said remembering the time Sam had broken up with his highschool girlfriend Sarah at sixteen and Dean had to come home from work at the autoshop to his brother in his room with his special lactose free icecream and tissue boxes.
John's eyes turned hard "Dean-"
Maybe he’s just tired.
“I know, Sammy. I know. But I’m here. And so are you. My heaven is finally complete and now we can finally see everyone again. Together. It’s over. We’re done. We can finally rest, Sammy. We can finally rest.”
“But yeah. That was it. I was... finished. Done. Forever. Or, well. So I thought. Barely any time at all passed before I felt something. A niggling at the back of my head. It grew stronger and stronger until it was almost deafening. It wasn’t until later that I realized that it was Jack. His power growing, calling out to me.
He felt immense relief when he finally spotted his brother’s coffee shop, thoroughly regretting his decision to not own a car. As it was a Sunday, he knew that Gabriel would not be there until at least 11, determined to get the most out of his “day of rest”.  As he took the keys to the shop out of his trench coat’s pocket, he saw a person waiting out front, hunched over with cold.
“Hello, Dean. Hello.”
“I fucking love you, Cas. And I want this. This; you and me. I want this. Forever.”
He doesn’t know what he’s saying, doesn’t know where the words come from or what they mean. Not really. His brain isn’t working, his mind is blank and broken and as dead as he is, and everything he’s saying is coming from somewhere far more dangerous and deadly. Far more fragile and painful and aching. He can feel his heart open on display, bleeding and raw and yearning in ways he’s never felt before, everything he’d held in and hidden in life and death out on display for the only being that has ever been allowed to see so deep under the surface, besides maybe his brother. He’s drowning in the emotions swirling within him and if he weren’t already dead, he’s sure he’d die from this feeling. Maybe he’ll just cease to be, instead. That would be fitting, wouldn’t it?
let’s go... he smiles. It’s not a good smile, not at all. But, damn it all, he smiles.
“Y-you... you can’t... you can’t mean that. Dean. You-“
Dean finds that he can’t finish his rambling words, his head fuzzy as he slams his eyes shut, running desperate fingers through his hair, pulling the short strands tightly. Pain doesn’t exist here, in this place, but he swears that he can feel the phantom of old twinges as he roughly grabs the hair as tight as he can. He’d do anything to feel pain right about now. How fucked up is that? Here he is, in a land of eternal happiness, and he can’t even be happy.
He doesn’t quite know how they had gotten to this moment. He, uh. He thinks he kind of blacked out for a moment there, because one moment he was there and suddenly he is here. Cas is as still as a statue, the angel not even taking in the unneeded breaths he had always partaken in while on Earth. He doesn’t know what any of this means. Doesn’t know why Cas hasn’t just flown off again. Clearly, if he still felt the way he said he did... clearly, if he were still in lo- clearly, he would have said something by now. Clearly. So, he... well. Dean is used to disappointment by now. But he doesn’t know why Cas is still here. He wishes he knew why.
, and I wasn’t, and what the fuck was I supposed to do, huh?! Tell me! What the
And yet. Despite that knowledge, that concession, he can’t help the bitterness that fills him at the thought. The pang of ugliness that takes over his useless heart at the realization that Cas has been there all along, watching over his domain like a king watches his kingdom. Or like a mother watches her child. Cas hadn’t said it, but Dean knows the angel. Better than he knows himself, probably. Cas would have taken Jack’s task with the same solemnity he once did everything with, ever the disciplined solider. But this time, with love and affection for the souls he was watching over, the loving and caring guardian humans had always wanted to exist in God. He knows this is important to Cas, he knows it with everything he has in him.
It’s funny, he thinks, staring into the endless water of the glossy lake before him, skipping stones as he’s taken to doing when he finds himself alone. It’s so very funny. There’s no one left to wait for now that Sam’s son has arrived. Their family is all caught up, the whole gang back together again, so there’s no one left to be missing so keenly, so entirely, so... desperately.
Thanks for all the feedback on this story!! I'm really glad that y'all liked it as much as y'all have. :-D
“Shit, I have to go or else my boss is gonna kill me. See ya tomorrow, Cas.” Dean said before leaving with a smile and a wave.
that is.
And so, for the first time, he doesn’t hold back, doesn’t listen to the voice that tries to tell him he can’t have it, can’t have this. With a slow smile that brightens as the centuries pass, a strange relief entering his heart even as terror wars with it, Dean slowly lifts his hand and bridges the miles between them and clasps Cas’s cheek so tenderly in his palm that he wants to cry, but he doesn’t. Instead, he just smiles, shrugging his careless shrug and hopes that the panic and preliminary regret isn’t visible.
He wants to cry.
“Yes. I, uh... suppose I am. Well, you’re in heaven now, so I guess you can better perceive my true self. I, uh. Thought that coming to you in this form would be easier, though. Familiar. I’ve not used Jimmy’s visage in... a long time. But it’s good to see you, Dean. I...” Cas trails off and clears his throat then, before looking awkwardly off to the side, breaking their endless staring contest. He doesn’t know if he should feel relieved or not.
was I supposed to do?!
) move, but Cas had. He must have. Because there he is, his eyes an ocean of blue, blue that is currently drowning Dean. Blue that has been drowning Dean since the dawn of time. He knows he is being dramatic, but with everything he’s feeling, all at once, endlessly, ceaselessly... he thinks he can be allowed this one, singular moment. After all he’s sacrificed. All he’s lost. Heaven is about getting whatever you want, right? Well, right now, he wants to break apart into teeny, tiny pieces. Is that so bad?
“Dean... Dean, I’m sorry. I-I’m sorry, I should have- but I didn’t know- I didn’t know if you would... if you’d want... when I- I left you looked- dammit. I don’t know, Dean. I don’t-“
“Alright. I guess I’ll start where you left off. After the Empty took me, I was placed back into that endless sleep. No confrontation, no final words. Just... nothing but my memories, my regrets, and fears, played on endless repeat. It, uh... really sucked,” Cas explains, the corners of his mouth tilting up despite the serious words. Part of Dean wants to smile too, but his face feels frozen in time, so he just continues to stare as the angel continues his tale.
“W-wh-what?” Cas croaks, the words barely recognizable. Something about it makes his smile widen. He doesn’t know why. “What do- what do you- don’t you- don’t you dare
The startled laugh Cas gives is as incredible as it’s always been, and he would lean up to chase the sound, but that means moving from this spot, and he never wants to do that. Ever.
“It’s, uh, stupid. I know, but I thought that since we, you know… Met because of coffee, it would be appropriate. Especially today. Because, if you remember it was-“
The words strike something within Dean, and he can’t help but see that moment in his mind’s eye, see the bright blue eyes drowning him with their sorrow and joy and
“Not just him, Sammy,” Dean remarks, a soft chuckle lacing his words, “Cas too. Bobby told me.”
“You know what? Why not. Let’s pay the old bastard a visit.”
. It... it’s Cas. Not Jimmy, not a vessel, not a fake visage. But... but
) again, centuries in which he’d imagined this meeting, the way it would go and what he would say, and this is how it goes. Funny. So very, very funny.
“I know, Dean. I understand.” Cas murmured, leaning into Dean’s hand, eyes closing slowly.
While it doesn’t feel like it, he knows somehow instinctively that decades have passed before he finally stops Baby at the bridge. It is a nondescript bridge, but it feels familiar somehow. It holds a power to it, a special aura that resonates deep within him. And he knows without knowing that when he turns, he will see a face that is more familiar to him than his own, at this point. And he smiles, truly smiles, as the last piece of his Heaven slots into place.
And still, he yearns.
So maybe that was why he broke the silence, his words faulting and halting and false and wrong. He wants to know what happens now. Where they go from here. Where they can possibly go from here. If there is anywhere for them to go, together, anymore.
“I suppose, Dean, that that is up to you. What do you want, Dean Winchester? Because I... I really want to know. What do you
“Well, you’re in luck, Dean. Because I fucking love you, too. And nothing would make me happier than having this. You and me. Forever.”
. His Cas. His Castiel. His fallen Angel, his last lifeline.
His angel.
In the end, it’s almost anticlimactic to turn around and see a face that is so familiar to him that it doesn’t feel like infinity has passed since he saw that face last. The eons between then and now melt away and suddenly, he’s human again, staring across the space that has always been too much and too little at the exact same time. He can almost pretend he can feel the chill autumn air cause a shiver to run down his spine, even though the cold doesn’t exist in this timeless place.
It’s a feeling that lingers within him as eternity drags on, waxing and waning in intensity and ferocity seemingly at random, but always ever present, under his skin, growing and growing each time it appears, vanishing for shorter and shorter periods of not-time. Like an itch he cannot scratch, a wound that he keeps on scraping the scab off of. Slowly but surely it grows and grows and grows. And, eventually, not even the drives can help him escape the sensation. The empty yearning for something he can’t even put to words. He knows his family and friends notice it, Charlie and Jo giving him soft, almost pitying looks when they think he’s not looking. Sam giving him those soft, baby brown puppy dog eyes, the look haunting him even in death. Even his dad notices, the once gruff and expressionless man shooting him concerned glances every so often, asking him if he’s alright.
He is truly at peace.
There’s nothing special about the moment in which it happens. Not really. It’s the same as every other moment here, in this endless paradise, an endless reward for a life of heartbreak and sorrow. The lack of day-night cycle still trips him up sometimes, even after all of these decades, the endless expanse seeming too endless at times.
So. Cas is the guardian of Heaven now. It doesn’t surprise him, honestly. What other ending for the once fallen angel was more fitting than this? What better end than to spend eternity watching over the humans that he had loved so deeply that he’d turned his back on everything he ever knew to keep them all safe? He knew it was fitting for Cas and knew that it was important work that Cas would obviously take very seriously. And he was happy for Cas, that he had such an important purpose in life (existence, whatever), truly, he was.
He... it’s good, Dean thinks, grinning and slapping the man with the same name as him on the back heartily. He’d died of natural causes, survived by his own three children and wife, in a world that was normal as normal could be. He’d never became a hunter, though he’d known of the creatures that went bump in the dark, which had made Dean almost want to cry, back when his brother had informed him of that fact, heart so relieved at knowing the cycle had finally ended. The man’s arrival is met with silent joy from his brother, with his mom and dad gathering around the grandson they, too, never got to meet.
“Just unusual, Cassie. You’re usually early, not late. Now, if you’d take the register, I can actually get something done.” Gabriel drawled, his tell-tale smirk on his lips, eyes twinkling with mischief. Cas sighed and traded his favored trench coat with the apron that marked him an employee at “Gabriel’s Coffee; A taste so heavenly you’d think you’d died”
Dean gave Cas a nod of thanks, absentmindedly bringing the cup up to his lips and taking a long sip. Another minute passed in silence as Cas waited before Dean finally spoke.
,” Cas chokes, his voice so strangled that it’s almost unrecognizable. In fact... it actually
“You’re goddamn right, Cas. You’re goddamn right. But we got there in the end, yeah? Just a couple centuries late. But we got there.”
Shivering from the cold, Castiel ducked inside the quaint coffee shop, inhaling the familiar scent of stale coffee and fresh baked goods.
Silence engulfed them, as Dean looked at him with wide eyes, obviously not having expected him to say anything like that. As the minutes passed, Cas started to wonder if he had messed up; if he should try and backtrack when he felt arms wrap around him, a heavy weight pressing against his shoulder. Hesitantly, Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, letting him take whatever it was he needed.
“I don’t need anything Cas. You’ve already given me more than you can know.” Dean replied with a small blush, smiling softly.
The silence deafens him, the only sound he can hear the phantom heartbeat he shouldn’t have but does because it comforts him, and anything he wants he can have here.
He can feel Sam’s eyes on him, though he doesn’t turn to face him. He looks out at the vast expanse before him and contemplates. He’s not ashamed or anything, no. Just... he’s assessing. He’s never told Sam, after all, what Cas had told him before he’d died. Has never told him what the angel professed. That’s a secret that only he can hold. Even here.
so overpowering he can’t believe this is real. This is true.
“I… Yeah. I’m… okay. Not great. But… I’m at peace with it. I guess.”
“I figured that was it, you know. And I didn’t regret it. I still don’t. You... well. I didn’t regret it. And if that was it, if that was my end... I was content. Happy, even. Saving you... that was what mattered to me. If I died, well. At least I died with purpose.”
Eventually, the pair will get up. Eventually, they will put their clothes back on, hands struggling as they fight the desire to take them back off again for the hundredth time. Eventually they will head back to Baby, get into her rumbling warmth (resist the urge to make love in her backseat, which they will fail at only a little), and drive back to the corner of Heaven he shares with his brother and the ones he loves.
Dean smiles as he sees the tears fill his little brother’s eyes, and while he knows they’re tears of relief, he can’t help that age-old desire to take away Sammy’s pain. So, he turns towards his baby brother and pulls him into a hug, a proper one that they never shared often enough when they’d been alive. He can feel his brother shaking, but he doesn’t comment on it; he just lets his brother cry as he holds him and whispers soft words in his ear, like he’d not done since the man was a young child. Maybe not since he’d been a baby.
The same voice that has been constantly saying he should tell Cas how he really feels.
He can hear Sam saying -
“A beautiful name for a beautiful man” Reece smirks.
After Castiel refused to go back to earth - still too afraid to face Dean after what he told him - Jack zapped them to heaven, he told Cas he wanted to make some changes, make it a better place, and Castiel was more than happy to help.
He will come back to Dean. He always does.
Sam raises an eyebrow.
For a moment, Castiel thinks it might be just another one of his regrets coming to haunt him, that's usually how it goes, The Shadow finds a memory, something that hurts him, and makes him relive it over and over again, and when he can't take it anymore, when he finally breaks, he goes back to sleep, only to be awaken not shortly after to do the whole thing again, like an endless circle.
He looks exhausted, drained, his skin awfully pale and his alluring blue eyes aren't as dazzling as they normally are.
Sam has been so happy since she moved in, he hasn't seen his little brother like that since Jessica, and that's pretty much the only reason Dean wakes up in the morning, if there's one thing he accomplished after all this time, is making Sam happy.
He doesn’t have to say another word, in a blink of an eye he’s at the bunkers door, all by himself - which he immediately regrets because he could really use Jack's help with this.
"I'm dead," Dean thinks out loud.
Right now, there's only one thing in his mind.
"Okay" Dean rolls his eyes, sighing "
Enjoy :)
His first thought goes to Sam, but Sammy's hands are bigger, besides, the figure sitting lazily on the chair next to his bed is clearly asleep, and Sam snores, unlike the man next to Dean.
“Uh, Dean” Cas touches his shoulder gently and he realizes he’s been standing there for way longer than he should “you’re kinda in my way”
Sam is currently struggling with two vamps, though Eileen manages to chop one of the guys head off - dear god that woman is incredible - Dean launches himself at another one, instantly regretting his decision because the guy is way bigger than him and pushes him in the opposite direction.
“Down the hall," she says, quickly, as though she read his mind and Cas thanks her before running past her.
Get ready for some angst
It's with that in mind that he opens his computer and begins to look for a case, he hasn't been very lucky these days, the last time he went on a hunt was a week ago and the lack of monster killing is starting to threaten his sanity. He's almost giving up when something catches his eyes. Something huge.
“Hello to you too Dean”
Cas sighs.
-  and Dean might have given him the wrong idea,
. He's not paying any attention to that.
Though Cas never talks to Dean about it - which really hurts to be completely honest- he does talk to Eileen. The two of them have become friends almost instantly, they are always talking and, when Castiel is having a good day, they hang out - they watch tv, or play cards, sometimes they even cook together.
Castiel doesn't answer, his mind still trying to recover from whatever Jack just did.
As he walks back to his car, Dean is struck by an odd feeling of grief, as if he lost something precious to him, although he never really had it in the first place.
So sorry to hurt Cas, but believe me it's for the greater good and everything will work out in the end :)
The last thing he remembers before Jack zaps him out of The Empty is a strange feeling that he might, after all, get what he wants.
Dean opens his mouth to ask what's wrong but is cut off by Cas, who is already twisting the doorknob.
"Now come on," Jack goes on, "I let's get you out of here."
"You're not real," he says, shaking his head as though that would make Jack disappear. It doesn't
- and, following the sound, he finds both Winchester brothers in Dean's room, Dean laying on the bed, half awake and soaking in blood, while Sam sits by the bed, tears in his eyes, holding his brothers hand.
"Goodbye Dean," he says looking back
Cas is supposed to be
Cas waves back and the guy makes his way to them and leans on the bar next to Castiel, completely ignoring Dean’s existence.
“I know” she says and then point at something behind them “he did”
mean.
Castiel can’t help but smile, he’s so proud, he wishes he could talk to Kelly, tell her that they were right, Jack did save the world, and now he’s saving heaven.
“Did you bring the-," Sam starts, probably thinking it was Eileen who entered the room, but once he looks up and recognizes Cas his jaw drops and he stares at Castiel in confusion, "Cas? How-”
Dean thinks about going there, ordering a drink and hanging out with the two of them. Reece seems like a decent guy - regardless of what his jealous brain told him at first - and he’s sure he could get along with the guy just fine.
“Bye Sammy” he hangs up.
He kneels next to Dean’s injured arm, opposite to Sam, and without any hesitation, gently places his hand on the wound. Dean flinches, but says nothing as Castiel’s hand begins to glow. He can feel the wound slowly closing, but something is wrong, his grace is weak somehow and he feels like he won't be able to do this much longer.
Dean doesn't have much time to think about that though, because, the moment his eyes adjust to the darkness in the room, he realizes that there's a hand holding his wrist.
"What-" Castiel starts, but before he can finish Jack's fingers are on his forehead and his mind goes blank.
That's new, isn't it? But again, it wouldn't be the first time The Shadow changes something to make it more
But that can't be, can it? Cas is dead, he couldn't be there, unless…
Enjoy
Castiel is still in the same place Dean left him, Reece by his side, and he looks so…
“Do Cas and I look like a couple?”
wrong.
"Yes" Castiel responds, trying very hard to hide his insecurity from Sam.
However, to his surprise, the moment he opens his eyes he's not in an old house surrounded by holy fire or watching Dean walk away from him covered in blood, he's in The Empty, the actual Empty, dark, cold and deserted.
“What?!” Dean nearly shouts “we’re- we’re not- together- why would you say that?”
"... And I wanted to change that, you know?" Jack is saying as they walk through another one of heaven' newest gardens.
Hey y'all, or should I say "Hey, heller friends"?
"I fixed your brain," Jack says as though it's the most ordinary thing in the world, "I can do that now."
So that’s what they do. They sit at the bar and Dean scans the menu for the least alcoholic thing they have - not usually his style but he doesn’t trust himself enough to be drunk around Cas right now.
“Re-rebar," Sam stammers, "v- very rusty rebar went straight- straight through his shoulder," and then pleads, "can you heal him?”
But he can do this, right? He has healed Dean dozens of times, this won't be any different.
Also, next chapter we will finally meet his new love interest! He's an oc and, though you'll learn a lot about him during the next few chapters, if you guys ever want to know more feel free to comment
"Sure, but you can’t leave like this," Dean cuts him off, "I just got you back."
Though his moment of happiness doesn’t last for long because when that voice calls him again Castiel realizes that something is very,
"Dean, huh," Sam says, carefully, "I was thinking… maybe we should take a break, you know? You haven't stopped hunting since we defeated Chuck, and you're also drinking a lot lately and I," he quickly glances at Eileen, "
and then he’s back with more questions “what is he like? Is he pretty? Is-“
He feels himself drifting away again, but this time is different, the room around him gets colder and darker, he can't hear their voices anymore, he can't even hear he's own shallow breathing.
"About that," Jack goes on, "I was thinking of building a world for them, like another Earth, but this one would have nothing else but happiness and-“
But Cas can't stop, he can't let Dean die.
With that in mind, he unlocks the door and rushes into the bunker.
He looks around, very deliberately avoiding Castiel's eyes, just to check if anyone else noticed it, but Sam and Eileen seem to be too immersed in their own conversation to even notice Cas' existence. so yeah, he's the only one fighting his libido because he cannot, in any circumstance, pop a boner during dinner with his family all around him.
After all, false hope is the last thing he needs.
I am watching them, but it doesn't mean anything, besides, when did looking at your friends become illegal?"
"But if the souls are not in their memories, where would they be?" Cas ask
They finish breakfast quietly, Sam and Eileen looking at each other like they’re talking telepathically and Dean pretending he doesn’t see it, then pack their duffels and hit the road.
"Stay," Dean finally breaks the silence, his voice weaker than he meant, "at least until tomorrow. Please."
” It reads
“It’s just- there’s this guy flirting with Cas and he said-“
His shoulder is sore, though is not nearly as bad as he remembers, which is awfully weird, a wound like that wouldn't have healed so fast, how long has he been out anyway?
"He's avoiding me"
and enough to distract him from his currently problematic life.
then"
Sam and Eileen are arguing again, something about hospitals and infections and too much blood. They're worried, desperate, though no one says anything, it's pretty obvious Dean is about to die, no matter how many times Sam tells him to stay with him, or how tight he grips his hand, they can't stop it now.
Dean seems amused for a second, but then his eyes drop to Cas' bare chest - the part his button up shirt doesn't cover- and they go wide, the green of his iris almost disappearing, being covered by the black of his pupils.
It takes a while, but Sam nods
For a moment, Castiel let's himself believe that this is real, that Jack is actually there, that he's actually okay, but that can't be true, can it?
He avoids Cas, gets all skittish whenever he's around and doesn't even look at Castiel sometimes. It's like Dean is trying to pretend he isn't there.
“Oh, I didn’t see you there” Reece’s smiles flattens a little as his eyes go from Castiel to Dean
"You don't need me anymore," Castiel says quietly.
"Dean, you look like a creep, go talk to Cas"
"Come on Cas," Jack offers him his hand, but Castiel hesites, this is too good to be true, "good things do happen sometimes."
Dean is feeling much better, which should make him really happy, except he can't feel anything but pity and that uncomfortable feeling you get when you don't know how to act around someone.
